I made this to bring to a party and it was a big hit!! Next time I will use provolone or meunster for more flavor. I will also buy a hunk of soppressata/dry salami and cube it. The slices of meat stuck together. I wanted to add marinated mushrooms but my store was out but that would be a good addition. I also added half of a very thinly sliced red onion; pitted halved green olives, Cherub tomatoes, and some parmesan cheese. SOOO good and very colorful!

This is fantastic pasta salad -- a fun side to chicken or pork at a backyard get-together. It is best served at room temperature, just as the recipe says. This is one of the recipes I featured on my blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

All my guests raved about it. I did make some changes. I used tortellini instead of corkscrew pasta. I added some red onion and included the marinade from the artichoke jar. I substituted seasoned rice vinegar instead of red-wine vinegar. I made it the night before and found that it needed a little "doctoring up" before serving by adding some garlic infused olive oil and sea salt.

This pasta salad was quite the hit at the summer dinner party I brought it to. I'm sure it will be frequently requested anytime I need to make a pasta salad.

Quick, simple, and very tasty, as long as you let it sit overnight. You can eat it right away but the red wine vinegar may be a tad strong still.

Added some chopped oregano and basil, used white wine vinegar instead of red. Excellent salad

This recipe pretty much tastes as it should. We made a few changes. Adding red onion provided a little crunch to contrast with the other ingredients. Also, take the time to roast the red peppers yourself. They will taste thirty percent better than jarred, and will make your kitchen smell heavenly. We doubled the oil an vinegar content(not using all of it), and used 12 oz of pasta rather than 16.This yielded about 5 main course servings. The next sunny day we get we will have this starting with dates stuffed with goat cheese wrapped in prosciutto, and a dry rose. Finally, I think Dill would work nicely rather than parsley, but that is a personal preference.

Excellent! Added blanched asparagus too. YUM! Also, very good if you replace the roasted peppers with a jar of sun-dried tomatoes.

I think it is better to substitute the Red Wine Vinegar for Lemon Juice and halve the quantity of the Lemon Juice as I found the mixture far too sharp!

Very easy to make and the perfect recipe for those hot days when you want a cold meal. It's a little oily, though, so I would recommended draining the olives very well or cutting back on the olive oil.

Quick, easy, tasty - what's not to love. Tastes great when made with white balsamic vinegar too!

This made so so much. Everyone who had some gave it a thumbs up. I made it to take on a road trip, and had to feed it to my sister while she was driving 90mph. When it got down to the last bite I thought she might cry. Very salty, not great for road trips.

Very tasty. An alteration that worked well for me: skipped the peppers and instead chopped up a bulb of fennel, briefly microwaved it to soften it up and added it to the mix. I also like more stuff and less pasta, so I used 3/4 the amount of pasta suggested.

This is a staple at our house, everyone loves it just as it's presented here. We've made it many times. And, no, you don't have to have fancy labels to enjoy it. Sargento cheese, jarred peppers and everything else can be had by shopping a regular grocery store aisle. That's part of the beauty of the recipe.

Good salad. I'm not a huge fan of artichokes, so I didn't like the slimy sheets of it all over my portion of the salad, but my husband ADORES them, so he couldn't get enough of it. Overall, very nice flavors though!

I was not a fan of pasta salads til I made this one from Gourmet magazine last summer. A terrific idea--if you use top-quality hard salami, fresh handmade mozzarella, and deli artichoke hearts, roasted peppers and olives--to make this for a buffet I double the recipe and buy the ingredients at an Italian grochery--not in supermarket jars. I like penne better than corkscrew pasta, and added some thinkly sliced celery hearts with leaves. Will serve at a 4th of July buffet with vitello tonnato...

I roasted and marinated the peppers by myself instead of buying the jar... it added to the "wetness" of the dish. The first time I made the dish, I cut up sauteed asparagus instead of artichoke hearts, the second time I roasted mushrooms - a great recipe to practice mix and matching ingredients!

This salad didn't do much for me. After reading the ratings, I thought it would be something special. I found it too dry (even after I added extra dressing), and just not that interesting.

Personally, I don't see any need to modify this recipe. It is very good.

This is really good. I think it would be better with 3/4lb fresh mozzarella (instead of 1/2lb) and orzo instead of the rotini. Maybe a bit more vinegar, too. Delicious!

I prepared the salad exactly as it appears in this recipe. Delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. I was surprised to find soppressata at Publix, where shopping is a challenge, so I did use that instead of salami. It isn't too bad cold the next day, but it is much better when allowed to warm a little to room temperature. Bon appetit, y'all.

My family doesn't like peppers so I omitted them. I made this recipe two days ahead because I took it camping. It is better if you eat shortly after making it. My husband added italian dressing and blue cheese to his bowl after we came home from camping. Whatever works!

Excellent salad, but I do not eat meat priducts, so I subsituted it for baby corn.
