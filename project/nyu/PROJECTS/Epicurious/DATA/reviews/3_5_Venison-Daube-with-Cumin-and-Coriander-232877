Was good, we added more wine. We used axis meat and cooked it much longer to have it reduce down enough. We liked the flavor but it seemed to lack depth of flavor.

I made this last night and it was a hit. The only change I made in the ingredients was using more wine, because the sauce was looking a little scanty--about half a bottle in total. The onions sort of melt into the sauce after all that simmering, and it's really smooth and rich-tasting. I also gave it about another half hour of braising time, as the meat was still a bit chewy after the time stated in the recipe. So if I were to make this again, I think I would assume at least 2 hours of oven time total. Served it with roasted potatoes/carrots/celery, yum!

This is that rare recipe that is simple, elegant and really beyond praise. I changed the basic recipe not at all, just adding some squash for fun. Biggest difference was that I used the much-maligned crock pot for about 5-6 hours on low, then added wine at the end with the crock pot on high for about 35 mins. Highly recommended.

I made this last night, by the letter. It was a great recipe! I preferably would have liked it a little better with maybe some cracked red pepper or something to make it a little spicier. However, I served it over brown rice and it was delicious and filling! I'll definitely make it again.

I made this with some venison roasting meat, substituting home-cured pancetta for bacon, otherwise following the directions. A big success and quite easy.

Wonderful. Do not use a tenderloin, as the meat ends up a bit too dry. Use a shoulder roast. Added 1/4 cup aged balsamic at end. The broth was exceptional served on brown rice.

I have made this a few times, it is a good use for the venison in my freezer. We like the flavors, it is flavorful but not too much so, and the kids eat it too. We serve it over white rice. Easy to make, uses mostly on-hand ingredients (except cilantro).

Regarding a previous review, I thought the cumin and coriander were terrific. I made the recipe with two changes: 1) sauteed the venison without flour first, then added flour a Tbsp at a time to the meat/onion mixture. I think this gets a better sear on the meat with less mess. 2) Added some sliced carrots for the last 40 min of cooking -- nice color, and goes with the spices well.

Fabulous! I used 1.5 lbs leg & neck meat, and added about 3-4 cups of cubed butternut squash. Time was an issue, so I dumped the crisped bacon in with the browned meat, added a cup of wine with the broth, & stuck it in the oven for three hours at 300 degrees. It needed a shot of lemon juice to brighten the flavors at the end. I served it over brown rice, and it was a huge hit!

I've used this recipe several times....but lost it and that was why i came to the website...i've never used venison, but i feel that the vancouver cook got a bit in a hurry....a daube is definitely SLOW take your time...and almost always better the next day

I made this recipe as written and will never make it again. The venison was too chewy and the coriander and cumin, spices which I normally really like, were quite offensive with the venison and red wine. I'll definitely be searching for a better venison recipe.

I'm sorry to be the decenting vote but I did not like this at all. I thought the flour made it too thick even though I patted my venison dry thoroughly before adding to the flour to avoid this and I think it tasted too much of bacon fat. If i made it again I would just fry the venison in olive oil add the rest of the ingredients and crumble some bacon on the top at the end to finish. I'm sure it is just the trauma of my childhood, my father cooked everything, absolutely everything in bacon fat.

A lovely and delicious use of venison. Very simple recipe.

This is an absolute favorite. I use this as a base recipe, sometimes subsituting rosemary, sage and mushrooms for the cumin, coriander and cilanto but bacon is always good. I also use chuck beef. I made this on the first cold wet night of the season this fall and three tired winemakers gobbled it up at the end of a harvest day with a crusty loaf of french bread.

This recipe is easy to prepare and freezes well. It also satisfies both palate and belly.

I made it with venison AND beef, and was so glad to have some left to freeze The bacon and cilantro at the end are not necessary but certainly delicious

This was wonderful! I too used beef, half stew meat and half chuck to see if I could tell the difference, and it was all so tender I would in the future would use whatever was on sale. Also forgot to brown some of the meat but dumped it in anyway, still amazing. Definitely would make again!

For anyone who thinks they don't like venison this will convert them. A wonderful flavorful recipe. I did cook it in the oven about twice the time indicated and I made it a day before serving allowing the flavors to meld.

Made this with venison for an adventurous ladies gourmet luncheon group, and it was terrific! Took my venison-loving neighbor's advice and marinated the meat at least 24 hours in red wine/olive oil/garlic before browning. Two of us were responsible for cooking the meat, and we both added extra spices and a good deal of extra wine (we triped or quadrupled the wine). We also increased the time in the oven -- the resulting dish was wonderfully tender and aromatic!

This is delicious! I used beef chuck as venison wasn't readily available ( do not use bottom round). Great alternative to pot roast.

OOPS! Would really like to try this one but the directions seem to go with another recipe, not the ingredients listed above. Guess I'll check back later.

Excellent recipe, I made it with roast as I didnt have any available venison lastnight, but the minute I do I will be making this recipe with it. My kids really enjoyed it over rice, we ate it alone as we are low carbing...really tasty and very tender! Cilantro is a nice touch.
