I'm curious that no one noticed the error in the ingredients list and instructions - it called for 1/3 cup sugar in the ingredients list, but 2/3 cup in the instructions. I ended up using 2/3 cup because of consistency not being right. But the cake didn't work out any way. So I wouldn't try this again.

I read all the negative reviews, and thought I'd be brave and still give it a try for Easter this year. I'm sorry to say, it was a disappointment. The cake itself I think is what ruins it -- like others have said, it's very bland and dry. Mine rose well, so I thought it would be delish, but alas, it wasn't. I was also sure to toast the hazelnuts to maximize their flavor, but it really didn't do much good. The ganache itself was pretty yummy, but the middle part with the strawberries definitely did not turn out as pictured. My guests liked it, but I wasn't impressed. There are so many good recipes out there in the world, I don't think I'll waste my time with this one again.

The second time I made this I whipped the egg whites separately and it turned out much better...the next time I made it (for a party I catered) the cake turned out HORRIBLE-my customers said it tasted like sawdust or stale wheat bread...don't make this on a rainy humid day-I think it soured. It looks so pretty in the picture, I'll keep trying, but don't bank on this one!

I was hesitant to try this receipe from all the negative feedback, but it looked so beautiful I went ahead. Everything went perfect and it was easy. I used Hazelnut Meal instead of grinding the hazelnuts myself and cake rose beautifully. Everyone raved about it at Easter and it looked gorgeous on the dessert table!

Looks great, but doesn't deliver...the cake was brick-heavy (next time I will whip the egg whites separately before adding them), the strawberry layer makes it fall apart unless you use a lot of granache (I doubled that part of the recipe to have lots for garnish)...I took it to a party and all the chocoholics loved it, but...

Where did you get that picture epicurious.com it certainly was not what I made. I should have taken the advise of the other reviews and not make this. Whatever you do do not waste your time with this one. The cake was like rubber. The ganache like soup. And the recipe should have called for more stawberries. It sounded good on paper but not what I was expecting. yuk

This cake was a lot of work and it didn't look anything like the photograph. First the hazelnut cake was tough and didn't have that marvelous nutty flavor. Perhaps I overprocessed them? Second the ganache was a hassle. I kept the ganache in the refridgerator for more than two hours as it was warm out. While it pulled the cake because it was too cold, it quickly turned drippy and messy once it had that "pudding" consistency. So I had to refridgerate the cake to stop the drippiness. Forget the crushed nut garnish on the outside. Third the strawberries which tasted very good caused the chocolate to lighten into a cocoa color. All in all, you could certainly use these ingredients to prepare a better dessert with less work.

It turned out all right for me, although I changed a few things, using frozen strawberries instead of fresh, but I thawed them first. It actually tasted ten times better if you serve it with a lot of strawberries on top.

I wouldn't make this again. Lots of work, the cake was tough, it looked better than it tasted.

Made this as a birthday cake for my wife; it was very good but imbalanced: while the chocolate and strawberries were terrific, the torte itself was slightly tough and the hazelnut flavor didn't come through very strongly. Could this have been because I ground the nuts a couple of seconds too long, bringing out more oil than I should have? Anyone else have this problem? Perhaps Frangelico in the ganache would help? PS: prepare to let the ganache chill longer than 1.5 hrs, especially on a hot day; it's easier to frost the sides when it's firmer than "pudding."

I also made this for Easter and thought I made a mistake because it was so bland. I ended up throwing out over 1/3 of it. I even bought the pan specified because I didn't have one with the exact measurements. I had good ingredients so I guess I'll try it again at some point, but I was really disappointed. It even looked like the picture.

Made this dessert for Easter and it turned out great. I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate for the ganache and it was delicious. My family really enjoyed it. I would definitely make it again.

This was a very easy and elegant dessert to serve. It is also light and not sticky-sweet, and the hazelnuts, chocolate, and stawberries make for a very fine combination. After several messy tries at decorating as the recipe had dictated, I gave up on that and instead dipped 8 whole strawberries in chocolate and placed them atop the cake, which I had spinkled with leftover chopped hazelnuts, and also put one dipped strawberry in the middle. It made for a perfectly lovely presentation.
