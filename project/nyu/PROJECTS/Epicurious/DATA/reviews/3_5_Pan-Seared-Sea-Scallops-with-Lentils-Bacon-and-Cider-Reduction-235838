We made this dish for the Iron Chef competition last night and it was a hit! We would definitely make this again.

Hmmm. Interesting is the way I'd describe this recipe. Individually, all the components were tasty, but together it was a confusion. The delicate flavor of the scallops was lost among everything else going on. The marscapone cream itself was delicious but it added nothing to the finished dish. The cider reduction was also very tasty but I didn't think it went well with seafood. I think that this recipe would be really great if the scallops were replaced with perhaps some grilled pork tenderloin.

There are things I liked and things I didn't like about this dish. Honestly, I love sea scallops and I felt there was too much going on, which was distracting...and I hate to say this, but for me some of the flavors didn't mesh well. The whole clove,onion, lentil thing was fine, but then adding the lemon cream sauce and the slighty acidic-sweet reduction sauce...it was too many flavors. Not to mention the bacon. Which would have been fine without all the sweetness and acid. I would leave the cloves out of the recipe, and maybe just do the cream sauce over the scallops. Keep it simple.

This was delicious. It's very rich, so it's better as an appetizer - a full serving would be overwhelming I think. The flavors were perfect, except I didn't really notice the cider as much as I'd hoped.

I loved this disk. I used pomegranate cider instead of apple and we LOVED it! This dish has great depth. Really enjoyed playing Top Chef with my husband at lunch :)

I would definately rate this dish higher based on the cider reduction, lentils and sauce which were delicious. However, the scallops were bland, bland, bland. Maybe I did not get great scallops- I don't know. They also needed to cook alot longer than 2 minutes/side to brown. I would try this again using chicken or pork tenderloin on top of the lentils and I think I'd have a 4 fork dish.It would certainly be a good make ahead dish for company.

A most excellent dish! Easy to prepare - even with 4 pots on the stove! I used organic Apple Cider vinegar from Trader Joe's and fresh apple cider, and the reduction was wonderful - definitely not overly acidic. The flavors would lend themselves to almost anything, from chicken to pork loin to just about any fish or seafood. I shall definitely make it again.

I would suggest manewnew revisit the recipe as I've made this dish and had it at the restaurant and it got rave reviews from the entire table both times. The make ahead steps are a gift for someone who is time-challenged.

very disappointing dish. The cider sauce was way too acidic and had no depth. the mascarpone sauce was lovely. All together, it was quite a bit of work for an ok dish. The lentil-scallop combination didn't quite do it for us, either. Lots of fabulous recipes on epicurious, don't waste time on this one.

This was an absolutely fabulous dish. It is nice you can make so much of it ahead of time.
