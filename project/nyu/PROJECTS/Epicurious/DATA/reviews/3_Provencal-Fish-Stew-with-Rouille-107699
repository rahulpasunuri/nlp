I added some heavy cream and dill

Use fish broth (or could use a good bottled clam juice like Bar Harbor and water) and add lots of garlic and hot sauce to the mayo for the rouille. If you do those two things, it will be delicious.

This is a nice base for the fish stew but the rouille in this recipe isn't the best, and strangely there's not enough fennel (and no Pernod/Ricard). I think a good fennel taste and a garlicy thick rouille make the classic fish stew. I tend to make my rouille with mashed potato, olive oil, saffron and a touch of garlic. As for the stew, you just have to have a good amount of fennel, finishing it off with Ricard or your favorite Pernod.

Added tomatoes and vidalia onion. Still found it less then exciting.

Delicious, exquisite, 3+1/2 forks plus. We used cod and added some shrimp too. It was a very delicate, subtle yet assertively flavoured dish, and will become one of my favourite for serving fish (which can so often be boring). Next time I may increase the fennel and leek and add some scallops too but no changes are necessary as written. The rouille-topped baguette dipped into the broth is an absolute must too.

Three things drew me to this soup recipe: 1) Simple and reasonably quick, 2) Enough substance to be called a meal, and 3) it used ingredients I want to be more comfortable with when I'm just throwing a dish together...that being saffron and fennel. I've found both of these ingredients can overpower a dish. First off, with the exception of cutting the fish from 1.5 lb to 1 lb (needed to reduce the calorie & fat counts), I made it exactly as described. This is NOT a dish with assertive flavors. Very delicate. Very tasty. The fennel is mellowed by the saute and long simmer. Just the right amount of saffron. The golden yellow color of the broth and the white chunks of fish was beautiful. We were surprised that salt wasn't needed, but that could be because the chicken broth has salt. Like all dishes, season-cook-season-to-taste. We sliced the baquette at an extreme angle which gives a fairly large slice. And, served additional slices with roasted garlic on the side. A nice wilted spinach salad completed the meal very nicely. (BTW: This could be a great starting base recipe for experimenting with additional/other ingredients.)

I was looking for something different to do with halibut - I'll keep looking. Very easy but boring.

Just to say, I found the much-discussed comments of Ms. Kanter informative and accurate without being disrespectful. Maybe we Montrealers look at things differently, but I'd have to say hanging and quartering seems a tad excessive. I'd like her to come by and cook at my place!

I enjoyed this recipe; it was tasty and easy to prepare. I added paprika and a touch of saffron to the rouille. I added a whole glove of garlic to the bouquet garni. As for the stew, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken (I couldn't find fish broth, and didn't want to make it from scratch), and added prawns and tomato. I also used two toasts per serving. I think I'll try using Pernod instead of white wine next time I make this.

Hang and quarter Gina. She comes across as a miss know it all. I feel sorry for her husband (if she managed to get one) Yes, comments and suggestions are useful, but Gina presents herself as the authority and her manner of writing offended me. It didn't sound like simply offering comments and suggestions, more like, "You stupid clods, this is the way it is suppose to be done." How sad to be so rigid.

This is a very nice dish. I used marlin, and next time will use an assortment of fish for more flavor. Instead of chicken broth I used Trader Joe's canned fish broth, which was very good in this. I ate it without the rouille and found it to be very satisfying. My husband loved the toast with rouille in it. Yes, I know it's not perfectly traditional, but since it's hard to get to Provence, and their fish aren't available here, this makes for a very satisfactory substitute. Don't skimp on the saffron!

Very delicate. Satisfying. I didn't bother with the rouille, but brushed on oil and sprinkled freshly ground pepper onto the bread befor toasting..

I agree with Atlanta. To the Cooks on 3/11 and 2/26: taste is subjective - so someone telling you they thought the recipe was "good" doesn't mean a thing. Gina was offering objective information regarding the recipe based on experience. To me, that is much more useful. I've never understood why people get bent out of shape when other people offer comments and suggestions rather than a simple review. I feel sorry for the cook who decides whether or not to prepare a dish simply on the opinions of strangers. Half the people who are making those comments are probably morons, anyway (statistically speaking).

Uh, Atlanta, because this is supposed to be for critiquing how a recipe comes out when you make it, not what you THINK it will taste like.

To cook on 2/26, get over yourself, fool! Why would Gina have to make a recipe first in order to critique it herself?! Any cook worth their weight and EXPERIENCE can figure out what recipe is worth trying!!

Ok, so it's fish poached in saffron broth, and not authentically Provencal. But it IS good. If you don't like using chicken broth in a fish recipe, and don't have time to make fish stock, try Penzey's Seafood Soup Base. It makes a big difference. There's no salt called for in the recipe. Maybe that's why some thought it bland. You need to add some. I was skeptical about a rouille made with mayonnaise. But it worked. And, I agree that two or three slices of the baguette are called for. Enjoy!

Gina, if you want to rate this recipe, please make it first! Your comments may be accurate, but do not help those of us who simply want to know if this tastes good! It's not the name, but the end result that matters.

This dish is a like a short cut bouillibaise Portions were quite small for four. I couldn't get fresh halibut so used haddock. I would make it again because it was tasty and easy.

This was an excellent recipe. I found the flavours of the stew delicate and fragrant. I used half the amount of halibut because it seemed like an awful lot of fish for the amount of broth called for. I put a generous amount of cayenne in the rouille and found the creaminess and heat a perfect match for the subtle stew. Really really easy and tasty meal-in-a-bowl.

This is simply delicious. If you are looking for a dense rich stew like cioppino or bouillabaisse, this is not the recipe for you. This makes an elegant, light, flavorful broth that shows off a beautiful piece of fish. The golden yellow is just gorgeous and the flavors are very distinct. I certainly did not find it lacking in flavor at all. The best thing about it is its utmost simplicity. It is incredibly easy to prepare with just the leek and fennel to cook. Canned chicken broth makes it even easier, although I did use a lovely homemade one. The rouille with just commercial mayonaise, garlic, and cayenne was delicious. I have beaten it by hand and found this to be just as tasty. Although lovely by itself, I think this would make an incredible 1st course for a more formal dinner. I will admit to two substitutions. I had no fresh halibut in my market and used a beautiful piece of cod. And I did add a handful of shrimp; I included the shells in the herb beau garni. I do agree that one bread toast with the rouille is by no means enough. This is a great dish.

We made this for a dinner that we catered and really enjoyed the flavors in the stew. It is very simple and delicate, but if you truly enjoy fish, you'd appreciate this dish. We found that adding some fish stock and a little smoked fish enhanced the flavors greatly without overpowering it. We will make it again for one of those quick dinner nights or simple entertaining. It really helps to get quality halibut!

It was edible but lacking flavor. The rouille is what makes this dish.

why should you use chicken stock in a fish stew?Isn't it better to use fish stock to make it more authentic?

I totally agree with the comments by Gena Canter from Montreal. This was not what I expected and should have known from having read the ingredients. Yes, the true rouille has different ingredients. All in all, it lacked taste.

well,Im not here to give destructive criticism..I read all the recipes sent by recipe flash..as I am a gourmet enthusiast,and I have spent 10 yrs in provence..so recipes from this part of the world pretty much go under my scrutiny...I havent tried this recipe,I dont need to as I know what the end result will be...this appears to be more like a tasty poached fish than a stew...It also lacked something in the soup base and that is the bones and heads of fish which give it that extra genuine flavour and thickness to call it a soup...when you boil all the trimmings then pass it through a passoir crushing as much as possible the bones..the result is a nice thick soup...now after having adjusted the seasoning and flavour, you place the fish prerably more tha one and poach it in the soup just enough till it is still firm but cooked...also if I remember well saffron and not paprika is added to the aiolli accompagniement and if you have fish roe the flavour is enhanced...hope I didnt offend the chef creator of this recipe..

To the cook from New York - fresh fish doesn't smell fishy - your fish should be nearly odorless when uncooked, and mildly seafood-smelling when cooked. Next time, don't buy it unless it passes a "sniff test".

We loved this recipe. We made the beef carpaccio with orange-olive salsa as the appetizer and had the stew as the main course. I think if we had spent $24 on the fish (we spent $10), we may not have been as happy. This dish is EXTREMELY simple to make and has great flavor. We didn't use the best ingredients we could find, just the run-of-the-mill available at Trader Joe's and the grocery store. I agree with the previous reviewer that more than one piece of bread with the rouille on it is necessary--we used two.

I'm not sure this recipe warranted the $24 I spent on the halibut. It was alright, but it didn't hold a candle to my one-fish bouillabaisse. I used the finest ingredients . . . freshly homemade chicken stock, new saffron from Penzey's, and a very expensive white wine. The fennel blended in, I suppose, but it was lost. The rouille saved the dish, but you need to serve two pieces of toasted bread instead on just one. Next day: I'm rethinking my review. I gently reheated this stew the next night, and it seemed much better. "Gentle" is the key word. Don't overcook the fish! I added three pieces of toasted bread with the rouille this time, and it does add a lot
