Wow, very disappointing. my vegetarian daughter, who is very sodium conscious, added salt to make this better. The parma cheese suggestion by one reviewer helped a lot, but I found it bland and not at all worth the time I took to chop all of the veggies by hand (which I do as my Italian lineage dictates)...I am stunned this got a 100% would make again...

It's the freshness of the vegetables that makes this, for sure. Also a dash of red pepper flakes while cooking, and plenty of salt and pepper on the table. I served it in bowls over wild rice, with good bread on the side. It was so good.

I followed this recipe pretty faithfully. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did add a little bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken, and some cayenne powder for spice. I accompanied the stew with rice and cornbread. My meat eating and vegetarian friends all loved it and I promised to send them this recipe. The meal was simple to make, not that time consuming, AND delicious!!! :)

Excellent recipe....you can put almost any vegatable into this and it will be fine. I also used about 2/3 cup chicken broth, and a little corn starch to thicken. Because I had some hot peppers by accident I put in one hot pepper which made it spicy, but not overly so. I put parmesan over the top. Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent starting point or as is. You can essentially throw in just about any veggies you like, just add a little chicken broth and it is amazing! I even took the suggestion of adding cheese at the end with the basil and it was spectacular. By boyfriend complained the whole time while I was preparing dinner saying how he hated half the veggies in it, then presto! I got an apology! He said it was amazing and had seconds! MMmmmMMMmmm!

We plant a summer vegetable garden and this is the perfect way to use the abundance we always have. I usually add chicken broth and serve it over rice or quinoa and sprinkle shredded cheese (mozzarella or parmesan) on top. This is a weekly staple on our summer menu.

This is one of the best vegetable recipes I have ever made. My five year old son and veggie-phobic husband had multiple helpings (unprompted) of this dish. I'd make it again tomorrow! I didn't have some of the items on hand and substituted green pepper for red and cauliflower for yellow squash and it still all worked out great. The flavors of the veggies was preserved nicely, the texture was great and the simplicity of the seasoning allowed the taste of the garden-fresh veggies to come out.

Very good - I made it with chicken stock and served it with sour cream, and it turned out quite tasty. Great way to use up squash and zucchini.

Very Good and Very Healthy. Adding the mozzarela was a nice touch. I will make this again. This would be a great meal to take to someone's home when they need support.

Made this during the late winter months in California and it was simple and delicious. I used canned corned instead of fresh and it still tasted great. I plan to serve with couscous like I did the last time I made it.

Excellent way of enjoying summer's bounty. Needs a generous amount of salt and pepper.Served it hot with shredded mozzarella stirred in, and it made a delicious main course with some crusty bread.

Surprisingly delicious considering the simplicity! Absolutely agree with other reviewers that the freshness of the veggies is key, especially the corn. A good crusty baguette is essential. Light, healthy and refreshing!

Wonderful and simple. I used all yellow squash (no zucchini) and even omitted the corn...and it was still delicious. Adding a good amount of salt and black pepper is key.

Looking for a way to use up all that summer squash I ran into this and have to say it came out great. I only had Thai Basil though and would not recomend it as a substitute as the flavor was a bit to strong. My kid and all his friends that were visiting gobbled it all up, so it strikes me as a "no leftover" dish...

They all speak the truth. It's surprisingly good with good veggies. I used all yellow squash as zucchini is forbidden in my house and it was great.

This is a good stew using so many fresh vegetables and herbs from the garden. We had lots of leftovers and I made a strudel using phyllo pastry and by adding cracker crumbs, an egg, and grated cheddar cheese to the mixture. This is a versatile recipe, a keeper. Beth

I was skeptical that 100% would make it again because the recipe is so simple. I usually like more complex flavors but this recipe is excellent. I agree that it is important to use only very fresh vegetables. The only modification I would make is to add one more tomato.

Would make again with some modification, which would be to add about a cup of chicken stock to give it much needed flavor and moisture (2 tomatoes doesn't give it enough juice as a stew base). A whole lot of S&P, oregano and basil just didn't give it the kick it needs (ie. red pepper flakes or a few shots of Tabasco). And it took a heck of a lot longer than a few minutes for the veggies to soften. It makes quite a bit though so the time chopping/cooking may be worth its yield. Would be even better with sour cream on top.

I added one small fresh jalapeno pepper. Very very flavorful. One of the best things I have made out my prolific home grown squash.

Lot of prep time but what an incredibly good dish. Everyone loved it and it got better with each day.

This awesome stew is quick and delicious. The fresh corn is wonderful, and the sauce was a hit.

Very Simple yet hearty soup. I pureed about half of the mixture to give a different and more souplike consistency. I also used spaghetti squash cut into cubes for a different texture. I added a dollop of sour cream atop along with the basil. Quite a treat!

Surprisingly good. But only use truly fresh vegetables, epecially the corn. I added some other veggies - like green beans. Great meal for using up the garden's bounty.

Was thinking of ways to use the summer squash from my garden. Saw this recipe and decided to try it. Wow, the melding of fresh flavors really knocked mine and the folks down at works socks off!

We loved this dish! So summery, fresh and delicious. Be sure to scrape the corn a second time after cutting off the kernels...the milky goo that comes out makes the dish slightly sweet and tasty. As a main dish with warm, crusty french bread, my husband and I ate it all!!!

This was just wonderful! The secret to the entire dish is to use only FRESH vegetables. If you decide to take a shortcut and use say, frozen corn or canned tomatoes, that would destroy the dish! The crisp, fresh flavors of this recipe are amazing! I actually didn't cook it down for the last 5 minutes as the recipe suggested. It just wasn't necessary and I was afraid of the vegetables cooking too much if I did. My husband and 10 year old daughter both went wild over this dish also. I served it with some warm, crusty rosemary foccacia rolls which we dipped in a delicious extra virgin olive oil! Fantastic!

I really liked this although I substituted chili peppers for the bell peppers giving it a spicy flavor.
