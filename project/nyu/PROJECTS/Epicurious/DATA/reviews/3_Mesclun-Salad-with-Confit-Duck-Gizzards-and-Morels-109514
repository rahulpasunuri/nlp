I was recently in La Rochelle, France and had this very dish for lunch with the addition of sliced smoked duck breast. It was really very good and I look forward to making it on my own now.

This is absolutely good French comfort food. It would be helpful to let people know how to confit duck gizzards as they are hard to come by in the usual chain groceries. Also, cutting the gizzards in the thinnest slices you can makes the taste and appearance much nicer.

Normally I hate it when people write comments without having tried the recipe, but I could not resist. I found it very amusing that this recipe was listed under the category "Kid Friendly". My children are quite adventurous, yet I do not think that they would be too crazy about confit duck gizzards.
