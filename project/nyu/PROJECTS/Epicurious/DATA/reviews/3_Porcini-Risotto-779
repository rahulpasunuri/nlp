Good, creamy consistency and relatively easy to make. I used a little white wine in place of some of the broth liquid, which I thought gave it a little needed flavor. I also mixed in some other mushrooms (fresh shitake and chanterelles), but I think next time I will stick to just dried poricini, which have a little more earthiness and pungency.

YUMMY! served as a main course with a side salad. hearty and satisfying on a snowy evening. also added about 6 large button mushrooms, coarsely chopped to add texture and used porcini soaking liquid instead of brandy. try adding 1/4-1/2 cup cheese to risotto at the end just before seving and have additional cheese on hand for guests. also good, just a dash of freshly ground black pepper-about 3 turns of your pepper mill. very low stress with great results. my boyfriend was very happy!

Interesting flavor, and fairly easy to make, but there are definitely much tastier risotto dishes for the same effort.

Tastes great and less mork than most risotto recipes (because you do not have to keep the stock warm and add it gradually). I did not have Cognac or Brandy on hand so I left it out and it tasted fine. I just added a little extra soaking liquid to make up for missing liquid.

I used about half of the porcini that the recipe called for and added some sauteed, sliced button mushrooms to give some taste/texture. The amount of porcini that the recipe suggests is quite overpowering. With the changes, however, it is excellent!

This recipe was not only delicious, but also one of the easiest; rather than stirring continuously while it cooks, the risotto can be left to cook on its own. I used portabello mushrooms and my family loved it.
