Afer reading these reviews, I put an extra half cup of full fat sour cream into the mix; and checked the cake at 33 minutes. It was alraady done. I suspect some of the complaints about it being too dry are people who let it cook for the reommended time in the recipe.

This is one of those one-in-a-million great recipe finds. I have made this a dozen times since finding it. I received many raves and requests for it. Results are BEAUTIFUL and as equally delicious. The blueberry's flavor come's through so much better than in muffins! One word description: AWESOME

It was easy to make and tasted terrific. Next time I think I might add a little more butter to the crumbs...they were a little dry, but other than that it was perfect.

I have made this crumb cake on multiple occasions, and it turns out well every time. Typically the blueberries sink to the bottom during the baking process, which I just love, as it creates a fantastic stratificationcrumb topping; moist cake; juicy, fruity bottom. Delicious. The people in my household who have a hard time digesting nuts really appreciate the simple crumb topping. Substituting an array of mixed berries for the blueberries yields an equally delicious, though tarter, cake; add a bit more sugar if preserving the sweetness is important to you. A wonderful midday snack or breakfast.

I just made for our church coffee hour.I added some oatmeal to the crumb topping. Also, possibly too many blueberries, I may reduce a bit next time. Overall, a great crumbcake.

Exceptional! Flavorful, moist and keeps well. Since we picked so many blueberries I made 4 crumb cakes and froze them. Even better! Heated individual pieces in the toaster or microwave oven. Yum!

This was exceptional! I substituted fresh strawberries and it came out great. I sliced them small - almost into cubes - and chilled them in the freezer for about 30 minutes before adding them to the batter. I also let the butter cubes warm up a bit before using them (but not too much!).

I really thought this turned out just OK. The cake was moist, but the flavor was subtle. And, the blueberries weren't as abundant as they appeared in the picture.

I made this recipe twice on vacation at the beach using freshly pick wild blackberries and both times is was devoured in less than a day. The batter is much too dense so both times I had to add additional sour cream and milk. I also added more cinnamon to the topping as I thought it was a bit bland.

Warning to future cooks of this recipe: do not make this cake with frozen blueberries! With them, my cake went into the oven looking perfect, but it turned into a soupy mess because of the extra water in the frozen berries. Can't wait to try this one with fresh blueberries!

The batter was a little dense, so I added about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup of milk and it turned out gorgeous! Really buttery and moist.

Yummy variation: substitute 4 cups of raspberries for the blueberries and add 1 teaspoon of lemon zest.

I've just made this recipe for the third time to serve to guests. Everyone I serve it to, family and friends, love it. I just came back to Epicurious to send a copy to a friend who requested that I do.

I thought this cake was delicious. It is light, not too sweet and full of blueberries. I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely pleased with the results. As the recipe states, it is best eaten on the day it is made.

I took the advice of previous cooks and added 1 tsp lemon zest and 2 tbls fresh lemon juice to the sour cream mixture and this cake came out great. It was super light and fluffy and fabulous. The lemon was a perfect taste with the blueberries. I'd make this again and again.

Not the best cake ever, but it's good for a crumb cake. It's somewhat dry, but the blueberries counteract that. It is good for a coffee cake, so would make it again for that purpose.

This is a wonderfull cake. I subituded 1 c of soy flour and 2 c reg flour. I also diden't have enough bluberry's so I added a cup of rasberrys Great! I agree, It is not as good the next day. I'll make half a receipe next time. No leftover's

BORING is right. Definitely not worth the bother.

BORING at best. Addition of lemon zest as per review recommendations didn't help. Texture is very dense and not too pleasant. Only positive is that it is very easy to make. BUT I wouldn't bother. This is definitely not worthy of epicurious.

This was delicious and easy to make. The fresh nutmeg definately makes the difference. I know the cook's note says best if eaten the same day, but I htink it's even better the next.

I made this as a coffee cake for a special Sunday morning birthday breakfast. It was lovely and moist (I like moist coffee cakes and I wouldn't call it soggy. Everyone liked it and it was finished off with no leftovers. To the reviewer from Montreal - if you look at the instructions, the baking powder is whisked into the dry ingredients not whipped into the recipe.

I made this recipe, by cutting the ingredients in half...substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and a dash of pumpkin pie spice instead of the fresh nutmeg and adding a little oatmeal to the topping. Ran through the dry ingredients with a whisk rather than actually sifting. It was delicious and a little dry, perhaps beacause of the oatmeal addition. I think it was just as good the following morning. Will make it again, topping with additional butter...that should make it 4 forks! Yummy!

this recipe is made complimented for nothing...first mistake I sdaw was that the baking powder is whipped with the ingredients...you should NEVER whip baking powder with ingredients ..your cake would turn out heavy and soggy...baking powder is sifted with the flour and foilded into your wet ingredients

Ooops, should've given the recipe "4 forks"

To the 2 previous reviewers: It is possible that your baking powder is too old and will not have the proper reaction when baked. Test it in some water before you use it again. If it fizzles, it should be OK. That might be the culprit.

Quite disappointing. Consistency was dense, and I didn't care for the nutmeg flavor. "Best eaten on day it is made" is right - it was mediocre (at best) on the day of and awful the next day!

What'd I do wrong? My cake came out soggy and wet, even though it was fully baked. I ran out of sour cream, and had to top it off with buttermilk, but I only needed a few tablespoons. Could that've been the problem?

I thought this recipe was quite moist and delicious. Altered it slightly by adding 2 peeled, chopped peaches with the blueberries.

I found this cake to be light and delicious, though the crumb topping could be sweeter. The next time I thought I'd add some brown sugar to it and then it would be perfect. I also followed the adice of others and added some lemon zest to the sour cream mixture....really good!

Very bland! Ended up throwing the rest in garbage. Needed more sugar or something.

I was in a hurry to use up blueberries and so didn't check the reviews before making this. I liked it well enough, but I do think the lemon zest and/or juice would have added something special. I did like it though and will make it again.

Needing a coffee cake recipe that went together quickly, with readily at-hand ingredients ( no buttermilk, for instance)to use up some very ripe blueberries, I tried this one for the first time this morning.(Under pressure, with guests arriving in one hour! ) It turned out beautifully in a 13 x 9 x 2" ceramic casserole dish. By the time I needed to serve it, it was still very warm from the oven, and all the guests raved about it! I did add one TBS. grated lemon zest and 3 Tbs. fresh lemon juice to the sour cream mixture, as I think lemon helps bring out the sweetness of the berries.

This was really yummy. My children loved it. It would be terrific served at brunch. Next time I might add a little lemon juice or zest.

To Cook from New York City. The difference between an 8x11 pan and a 9x13 pan is 29 square inches, about 1/3 larger, so it's not just a couple of inches. That would make a big difference in the baking time and would account for your problems.

quick, easy, suggests that you eat the same day, I would agree. Might finish next time with a sprinkle of sugar on top while still warm. Very nice coffee cake.

This looks like a great recipe - easy and delicious. However, the recipe called for a baking dish 13 x 9. All I had at the moment (most of my belongings are in packing boxes) was a glass baking dish which was 8 x 11 NOT 9 x 13. I baked it for the 45 minutes and let it sit for about half an hour. Well, imagine how disappointed I was when I poked around INSIDE and noticed that the batter was not completley baked. I guess it had to do with the smaller baking dish - even though it was just a couple of inches it appears that you must bake this dish as a very thin layer - that is why they say 9 x 13. Well, what do you think went wrong? I can only guess that it was too thick and should have been thinner. Otherwise, it should be a really nice dessert. It could use a little more sugar by the way.
