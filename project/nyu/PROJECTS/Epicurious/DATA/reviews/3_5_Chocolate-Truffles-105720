I thought these were very good -- I divided in half and made 2 different kinds -- used 4oz chocolate and 3oz of whipping cream. Put 1.5 tablespoons Grand Marnier in one batch and 2 tablespoons of Chambord in the other. Next time I will add orange zest to the Grand Marnier and possibly some orange extract. And am thinking maybe some raspberry puree to the CHambord ones. I didn't find these particularly messy to make. Rather than chilling the ganache and then rolling balls I lined some silicon molds with plastic and poured the warm ganache in and then chilled. Orange slices for the Grand Marnier ones and roses and little cups for the Chambord one. Oh, and I used 2oz of dark chocolate and 2 oz semi-sweet. Will definitely make these again and play around with different flavors.

Don't run away from this recipe fearing its length. It is simple (boiling cream and good chocolate) and just a little messy (can be helped). Most importantly, truffles are delicious. Suggestions: 1) Divine recipe improvements: a) a pinch of salt; b) Add lots of very finely chopped almonds and orange zest plus Grand Marnier. Best! Can I possibly still be alive to write this? c) Use half the recipe with bittersweet, half with semi-sweet chocolate. d) Experiment with additions inside and outside of the truffles -- almonds, walnuts, peanuts, coconut, various combinations of cocoa and confectioners' sugar; drizzled squiggles of liquid chocolate across the tops. 2) Neatnik help: a) Indent a layer of Glad wrap over tiny tart/candy mold pan; 2) Pour ~T of ganache into each spot. c) Put an almond & piece of orange peal onto tin to identify the the ingredients; d) Cover with second layer of Glad wrap; e) Freeze for 30 minutes while filling another couple of molds. e) Flip molds upside down to reuse molds while plastic-wrapped truffles continue to freeze. f) When finally rolling into balls, drop each on a scale to make all the same size. (About 3/8 oz. is bite-sized.) g) Roll truffles in small bowls of coverings; h) Refrigerate. i) Variety makes a beautiful display.

I took these to a Wine & Chocolate Tasting event. This was my first time making truffles. I used 1 bag (11.5 oz) Ghirardelli (60% cocoa) bittersweet choc chips, 3/4 cup cream, and 2 Tbsp of good port. (It yielded 60 truffles.) I used a mellon-baller to scoop out balls of chocolate, put them on a waxed-paper-lined cookie sheet, and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes. Then I rolled them into balls (putting cocoa powder on my palms before rolling every other ball really helped to keep the chocolate from sticking to my hands) and rolled them in cocoa. Put them on a pretty plate, sifted cocoa and powdered sugar on them, and put them back into the freezer for a couple of hours (took them out 30 minutes before serving). Pretty good!

Nothing special. Made with high quality chocolate first and had a problem with the fat separating out. So I tried again with chocolate chips. Worked fine but not great.

to make easier balls, pour mixture into a plastic wrap lined sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate for an hour, then on another upside down parchment lined sheet pan turn out the chocolate. using a pizza cutter and a ruler cut in one inch squares, roll your squares and your done. Works great.

I split the mixture into two and added two different liqueurs, also cooled one in a large bowl and the other in a small bowl. The mix in the large bowl was just the right consistency. The mix in the small bowl was just to soft. Could someone explain why the difference. I scooped out teaspons and refrigerated again and then used a teaspoon to toss in the cocoa - eliminated messy fingers.

these are delicious! i used 3/4 cup of heavy cream, split the mixture into 2 batches. to one batch i added 1 tbs of kahlua and to the 2nd batch i added 1 tbs of vanilla. i followed another review and used a melon ball scoop to make balls and refrigerated them until firm. it definitely helped to touch my hands with ice and pat dry when rolling the truffles into balls. despite tasting delicious, the truffles softened very quickly at room temperature. perhaps i should have kept them in the fridge longer.

Delicious and easy, but VERY messy, so be prepared for a good cleaning afterward! Like many other reviewers, I dropped dollops of the ganache onto cookie sheets and put in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm them. I found that they were much easier to roll if I coated my hands in cocoa powder. I used Frangelico, and it added a very subtle flavor. Great recipe.

Chilling your hands by holding something frozen for a bit makes rolling the truffles into balls easier. Scooping them and then refrigerating before forming helps too. I use rose or orange blossom water to flavor. Already flavored chocolate bars like crystallized ginger or nutmeg and cocoa nibs make exotic flavors easier and nonalcoholic.

I made this recipe for a buffet and it went over great. There were none left over at the end of the night. I did have trouble making the balls. They were uneven and I got chocolate all over my hands. I ended up using plastic wrap to mold the balls since, even after longer refrigeration, the chocolate still melted all over my hands.

These were such a hit! I'm so glad a reviewer gave the suggestion of scooping out the portions and putting them in the fridge to harden up, then rolling to shape. I put my 'scoops' on two plates, that way you can switch out if one gets too warm. For first timers, when you are rolling into a ball, there shouldn't be much chocolate at all on your hands, if there is, just pop into the fridge for a little longer. If you are doing it right, they will form to a ball in 5 or 6 quick rolls.

I'm a pastry chef, and it drives me NUTS to see recipes for chocolate desserts that don't have SALT! Salt is a MUST whenever chocolate is the main ingredient. It really enhances the flavor. So add a pinch of salt to the recipe, PLEASE!

this recipe is going in my permanent collection! thanks to other cooks for great tips. per suggestions, used 8+ oz of valhrona and e. guittard, a little less than 1 cup cream, 1/2 tbsp. vanilla and 1 1/2 tbsp. kahlua. put in fridge for abot 1.5 hours before rolling and coating in a mix of 2/3 cocoa, 1/3 powdered sugar. DELICIOUS! guests swore the were store bought. this will be my new "go-to recipe" when i need something tasty for guests or hosts. yum!

I have some good quality milk chocolate on hand, but it's not semisweet. It's normal chocolate but not overly sweet, like Hershey's. Can I make these truffles using the chocolate I have?

These are fantastic and a total cinch to make. The first batch I simply used vanilla extract as the accent , the second batch I decided to amp up things by adding a vanilla bean to the cream and a little kahlua and ameretto to the ganache. Be creative, these are virtually impossible to mess up. The previous reviews are correct that the three hour chilling time is much too long - an hour was better for me, and I stirred the ganache a few times while it was in the fridge. A lot of the previous reviews are helpful, my only additional suggestion would be to take them out of the fridge a few minutes before serving - they are a bit too hard otherwise. I also added fifty percent more cream in the second batch to combat this. I used a mix of scharfen berger and much less expensive ghiradelli chocolate to balance quality with price. It worked well.

I'm a truffle novice--here's my review based on never having made any before. I made this recipe with 1 cup of cream and with one tablespoon of alcohol per batch, and I used three kinds of coatings. The cream made for rich and delicious truffles. They were a little on the soft side, needing three hours of chilling. They were still a little too soft to work with for the first shaping. I'd go with a little less cream next time, maybe 3/4 cup. but they were certainly delicious. For the flavoring, I used grand marnier for one batch and kaluha for another. Both turned out with just a very slight hint of the liquor taste; you probably wouldn't even notice it and the coatings overpowered it anyway. The flavorings added depth though, and I'd use them again. For coatings, I used a powdered sugar and cocoa powder blend. Truffles that were later rolled in a crushed coating (crushed toffee and another batch with finely ground coconut macaroons) required only one intial coat. The "pure" sugar/cocoa ones needed two rounds of rolling & coating. They were all delicious and a big hit, and I'm definitely going to make this again next year!

Julia Child's recipe calls for 8 oz. of bitter sweet chocolate and uses one cup of heavy cream. The extra cream really keeps the truffles softer and makes it easier to form. If one cup is too extravagant you could use 3/4 cup of cream.

Wonderful recipe - simple ingredients, easy to follow directions, and the truffles are delicious! Also a great recipe for first-time truffle makers. It's now part of my personal collection. Thank you!

My recommendation is that when making this, simple and rewarding recipe, you get creative. For instance, if it's near the holidays, roll the truffles in crushed candy canes, or as a great finish to an indian meal, add a pinch of cinnamon and cardamon and then roll in pistachios. also delicious when spiked with malibu cocnut rum as your liquer and then rolled in fancy sweetened coconut. I have tried all these variations, and every one of them was a huge success, but the very best was when as a delicate finish to a greek dinner, i dipped each truffle in honey and rolled it in slivered almonds ... food for the gods.

I will definitely make these truffles again, however I would reduce the amount of liquor down to one tablespoon, otherwise the flavors overpower the chocolate.

These were simple to make, and there is lots of room for variety and personalization, but they didn't quite work for me (I felt they were a little too bitter without enough to sweeten out the bittersweet chocolate). I used ghierdelli chocolate and divided this recipe into three different batches - one with baileys rolled in powdered sugar (huge hit), one with hazelnuts and vanilla rolled in unsweetened cocoa (people enjoyed them), and one with kaluha rolled in a mix up powdered sugar and unsweetened cocoab (terrible failure). I think that besides the quality of chocolate, the key to this recipe is deffinately all about which flavoring liquor you use, since everything was the same in mine except for that, and some were gobbled up where others were thrown in the trash.

Work-intensive but worth the effort; used Kahlua as flavoring liqueur, the coffee flavor accentuating the taste of the Valhorna chocolate -- for this sort of recipe, one must use high-end chocolate as it is all about the chocolate! I dipped half of the truffles on melted Callebaut bittersweet chocolate, the other half I dusted with Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder. Guests could not decide which one they liked best.

So simple to prepare, simple to roll and sooo very good!!!! Everyone loved them!!!

easy and versatile recipe. so many variations possible!!! i did lemon (w/ zest and lemon extract.) Boyfriend loved them. about the melting: when you roll the chocolate into balls, dip your hands into ice water for 10 seconds and dry them. repeat every 3 or 4 truffles.

Delicious like an explosion in your mouth. personal trick is not to put it into fridge until it has sat on the counter to firm up and then into fridge only for 5 minutes at a time or it gets to hard. in between you stir the chocolate so that it does not get too hard to handle. use a cookiedipper and drop the choc into choc powder and then roll into balls. i have used framboise, pear brandy, calvados - all with great results. i have used expensive scharfenberger which is the utmost and less expensive Belgian or ghiradelli dark, semi-sweet or bitter sweet choc - all yum yum

I prefer to use bittersweet chocolate and love to add 1/2-1 teas. coffee or espresso powder to the cream. With the espresso a touch of finely chopped lemon zest is also marvelous-but add after you bring cream to a boil and as you add to chocolate.I have also added black and or cayenne pepper--just a smidge to give it an extra (secret)kick.

I have made these several times now, and they always get "ooooohs and ahhhhs" because they are so simple, elegant and absolutely delicious. I agree you must use Valrhona, or another high quality chocolate. I have read the reviews with opposing complaints about the ganache being too hard/cold to scoop or too soft/warm to roll into balls without melting. Since I too have experienced both these problems, I've come up with the perfect system for working with the ganache. I let the ganache cool until it's barely firm, still very pliable, then I use a mellon baller to scoop up the amount I need for the truffles. Then I refrigerate these rough scoops of ganache until they are very cold and very firm, and then I use my hands to roll them into balls. This way I always get smooth, beautiful and uniform truffles, with minimal melting.

The best recipes are the simplest and this one proves no exception. Effortless yet exquisite, there is no question that these chocolate truffles will taste as good or better than the ones found in gourmet shops. Make sure to use the best quality (i.e. highest fat content) cream and chocolate. Since they're only three ingredients, it's important that you don't scrimp.

I made several different kinds of truffles from the various recipes on this site. Let me start by saying I find truffles are a LOT of work. All tasted good, but the caramel ones were really soft and very hard to form. I probably wouldn't make any with candy cane again as people found the minty taste surprising. These are the steps I found worked best: 1) Make the truffle mixture and leave for at least 3 hours to 12 hours in the fridge. 2) Roll the truffles into balls. I dipped my hands into a bowl of cold water with ice cubes between rolls for the softer ones. 3) Place on wax paper and store in the fridge to harden up after rolling. 4) Coat with melted chocolate. I didn't temper the chocolate because it was too hot after tempering and melted the truffle. But it's important to coat them because they look unappealing in their post-roll form; kinda lumpy. Coat by balancing the truffle on a fork and spooning chocolate over. Identify the truffles by putting different garnishes (like a dried cranberry for the cranberry truffles) on top.

This was wonderful! I used 12oz chocolate chips a little extra cream and added grated orange peel. I dusted them with cocoa and sugar. These were good enough to give as a gift. People raved! Wonderful texture, great taste. I'll make them again and again!

Great basic recipe. To personalize it to my taste I like adding cinnamon, cloves, and ginger (basic spices in pumpkin pie). Another favorite is adding peanut butter for gourmet chocolate & PB truffles.

I have made these twice now, learned that the three hour chill is too long, the chocolate is no longer malleable, 1 1/2 to 2 hours worked better for me. Also the second time I added some confectioners sugar to the cocoa for final rolling, family decided they were better. All in all, a simple recipe (other than getting the chill timing just right for consistency/shaping). End result is delicious.
