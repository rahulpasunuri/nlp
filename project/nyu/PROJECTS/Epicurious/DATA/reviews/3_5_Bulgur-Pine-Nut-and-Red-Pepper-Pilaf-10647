Very good recipe. It makes enough for 4 people. I added more veggies than called for and the bulgur needed more chicken broth than called for and took about 10 minutes to cook.

This was a good recipe, not great, but good. Because of the healthiness of the recipe and the fact that it's mild flavor could go well with several main dishes, I will make it again.

yummy! and healthy too. I've made this several times. I didn't have any bulgur so I used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend (Couscous, Orzo, mini Garbanzo Beans and Red Quinoa). I added garlic and used vegetable stock in place of chicken broth. I agree...make extra pine nuts!

Simply yum! Great, high-fiber alternative to rice. Toasted the pine nuts for extra flavor. Definitely makes MORE than 2 servings unless you're only serving it with grilled veggies or a nice salad.

Great! My only complaint is that this makes a lot more than two servings--more like four.

I added extra pinenuts and chives. I'd probably add parsley and garlic, too, next time. We liked it and it was a good change of pace from rice and potatoes.

I didn't have chives, so I used scallions, I also added fresh cooked peas, and a little chopped celery. I sprinkled parmesan on top when serving. Next time I will also add chopped fresh grape tomatoes. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth as I am a vegetarian. Omitted the salt. This dish is awesome. The toasted pine nuts were great, I added extra.

Excellent and easy. I used yellow pepper and red onion since that's what I had. didn't really taste the chives so I used some fresh basil. i also used veg. stock. Bulgur is yummy!

Wow! I was a little aprehensive to try bulgar for the first time (so was my boyfriend), but we loved it! DIfferent alternative to the usual rice or pasta. Added garlic as I can never seem to get enough, but I'm sure the flavour would have been wonderful w/o it.

This pilaf is so good, you could serve it as the main dish. Don't forget the pine nuts.
