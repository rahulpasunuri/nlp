Omit the orange. Replace the nutmeg with cinnamon.

I am from latin america, and as a kid grew up eating this "cosita", and later found the recipe from Bon Appettit, my family loves them, wished my father would have tasted mine ( he passed away last Feb.) Love Teshie

When in Spain I adored the churros. This is not anything like the flavor of the 'real thing'. It is good but a huge disappointment. Too bad; Sometimes you shouldn't divert from a classic recipe.

A vey delicious dessert. I think it could reach a four if there was a little more flavor into it. But overall Excellent!!
