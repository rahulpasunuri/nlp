Good recipe to use up extra squash and potato from the CSA, but next time I'll use hot sausage. I think a spicy sausage with the sweet topping would be a nice mix of flavors. I too needed to use a larger pan.

Surprisingly good! One semantic thing though: There's no lamb. It's not "Shepherd's" pie if there's no lamb. Without lamb it's "Cottage" pie. Sheep-Shepherd ... get it?

Shepherd's pie is a favorite and this is a wonderful variation. The sweetness in the potato topping really brought out the spice in the sweet italian sausage. I wound up with a lot of the potato topping and used it as a side dish another night.

I really love this recipe. I sometimes make it with low-fat turkey sausage. I punched it into a calorie counter and it is a great low-fat, healthy recipe. I love the flavors of the curry and sweet potatoes. I also substitute regular milk or even almond milk for the whipping cream.

A home run! Instead of hot sauce, I used 1/3 hot Italian sausage, 2/3 sweet Italian sausage. Can't wait to make this again.

An unusual dish but very delicious. I too piled on the ingredients to upgrade it to a 9 1/2 x 13 inch pan. It would have been too much work for an 8x8x2 pan. I did not remove the sausage casings and I don't think that matters. I am not sure what the egg offers, but I did include it.

I have made this recipe at least 5 or 6 times, and my family, including my 2 year old and my shepherd's pie hating husband really enjoy it! The only change that I have made (at my husband's request) is to reduce the potato/squash mixture by about 1/3 or increase the sausage meat mixture to use 2 lb of sausage meat as the recipe's ratio is a little too much on the potato side for us. I was skeptical of the combination at first, but it's a real winner!

This was great! Nice and hearty and satisfying for the depths of the cruel New England winter. I lightened it up a bit by using a chicken sausage, and half and half instead of whipping cream. I also swapped out peas and corn for celery and a green pepper because it's what I had on hand. Also swapped out coriander for cumin. Huge success. It tasted great with a little green salad with a lemon/mustard vinaigrette. The acid cut through the sweetness and starchiness of the potatoes. Love!!

Rating: 4
YUM! I added more of everything ( extra potatoes, 2 lbs sausage, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk) so I could make it in a 9 x 13 pan. The veggies made it for us! I added fresh broccoli, zucchini, red pepper, spinach, carrots, and fresh basil. The extra chopping was SO worth it (esp since the food processor helped!) because the taste was hearty and still fresh! I just added them all in with the onions. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Yum. I used garnet yams, "flying saucer" squash, and a russet for the topping, because that's what I had in the house. Halved the curry powder (I'm not a big curry fan) and, at my daughter's request, increased the corn. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
AMAZING. Even though it was a little labor intensive, this is going into regular dinner rotation. I used 1 lb yam / 1.5 lb butternut squash, turkey sausage (not very greasy, so I had to add some olive oil to cook the onions), 1 C sweet yellow onion, and added about 3/4 C carrots (briefly sauted with onions, about 2 minutes), and forgot the hot sauce. I made it for a dinner party, and it was perfect, everyone went back for seconds - and not a single bit left over. The potato mix was also great - and would make a great side dish by itself.

We really enjoyed this recipe. My husband would have liked it with fewer onions (he's not a fan), but I think they were well balanced. It's very moist unlike some versions. I liked the curry and coriander flavours.

Delicious. Used great quality sausage and the potatoes & squash from the farmers market which at this time of year is basically all they have so it is the perfect winter seasonal recipe. The idea of another reviewer to use a box of mixed frozen vegetables instead of the corn & peas was perfect.

My husband and I just finished this wonderful shephard's pie. I was dubious at first, yet intrigued, and the reviews were so positive I thought I'd try it. Yummy. We LOVED it! I used chicken sausages made with spinach, artichokes and mozzarella, and added some lima beans, as this was what I had on hand. Silly me for doubting the role of curry or maple syrup. My honey wants to know when we're having it again. Soon, I can assure you. I did microwave the poatoes and the squash for convenience.

Rating: 2
I skimped on the curry powder, and used a mixture of sausage and ground turkey so it came out a little bland. But it is very pretty with its bright orange "hat" and festive filling. I skipped the white potato, and added some diced red pepper and sliced spinach to up the vegetable quotient. I'm definitely going to try again.

Rating: 4
I've made this for several big family dinners and it's always a hit. It's great for sneaking veggies into my husband's diet. Yes, it takes some time, but the result is worth it and as many reviewers have done, you can adjust the ingredients to suit your needs. I leave out the russet and sometimes use milk instead of cream. I've also used frozen green beans instead of peas or fresh carrots if I need to use some up. Try this recipe!

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of leaving out the frozen peas because I don't like them. Fair amount of work for this, but worth the end result. I would just use squash and sweet potatoes next time for the topping, as the russet potato was completely lost, IMO. And I found that this fit handily into a 3 quart round casserole dish, rather than the 8" square. I think I might try chicken or turkey sausage the next time, and maybe roasting the vegetables rather than boiling, but otherwise wouldn't change anything. Deserves 3.5 forks, honestly, and would be a 4 forker if it weren't quite so labor intensive.

I just made this tasty dish and my husband and I both enjoyed it. I didn't have squash, so I used sweet potatoes and Russets only. I didn't have cream but used the same quantity of real milk, I added extra curry powder and turmeric and it all went down very well. I will make this again.

Made this with sweet potatoes and squash, no russet; used mango chicken sausage and andouille, therefore skipped the hot sauce and didn't need any additional salt. Delicious. Fed 6, not 4.

I lightened this recipe up a bit and added more onions. I always add a couple types of onions, as well as garlic when smashing any potatos, so I gave these my usual with one whole onion and three cloves of garlic in the potatos. I used chicken Italian sausage as well as ground turkey, lightening this some... I also added leeks, to the meat while frying and lightened up the heavy cream by half, replacing with some milk. We loved it. The curry and the sweet potato and squash made this sooo yummy.

Rating: 3
I didn't use the russet potato it calls for, and just added another sweet potato. I didn't use the hot sauce, but used 1 pound sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 pound hot Italian sausage. And rather than find little bags of frozen corn or peas, I bought a pound of frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, lima beans, corn) and used the whole bag. Fantastic!

Rating: 0
I just made this recipe for my family and we all thought it was delicious! The sweet potatoes and squash instead of the usual mashed potatoes was a wonderful exchange and the sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef was a huge hit! Added just the right amount of spicy to the sweet! Would highly recommend to anyone!

Rating: 3
To reduce the number of dishes used, I sautéed the onion and sausage in a 12" cast iron skillet and then assembled everthing in the skillet before putting it in the oven. I could have probably cooked the potatoes and squash in the same skillet too, but didn't think of it until I was done.

Rating: 4
I made a simplified version which I believe was probably just as good...I used a kabocha squash (which tastes like a cross between squash and sweet potato), and just cut it in half & roasted it in some water--much easier than peeling. I also microwaved the potato and just scooped out the flesh & mixed it in with the squash, butter & maple syrup using my immersion blender. I skipped the step of reheating the squash--I think it was dry enough anyway since I had roasted it. I used only a pound of sausage and slowly added it with the onions after sauteing to the remaining ingredients, stirring after each addition, which kept the egg from solidifying too quickly, but it was still warm so it took less time to cook--about 1/2 hour. Extremely flavorful, and not too time- consuming my way!

I was sadly disappointed in this recipe. It sounded so good and the reviews were encouraging. I made it as instructed and I thought it was awful. I couldn't even eat it. We wound up throwing it out. It was a fair amount of work for nothing.

I had a ton of leftover (regular, not sweet potato) mashed potatoes and this dish put them to great use! I used half sweet and half hot Italian sausages, and so did not put in any hot pepper sauce. I used peas/carrots and corn in a can rather than frozen. I really liked the curry powder - it was subtle. My husband and I both enjoyed. I served it with roasted carrots and salad.

This was a big hit at a casual family gathering. Based on some the reviews I read I did subsitute the curry powde and coriander with cumin and chili powder. I also took the quick option and simply roasted the squash and sweet potatoes which saved much time and unecessary effort. I received a number of requests for this recipe!

This was delicious. Had left over sweet potatoes from the holidays used those as the crust instead. Doubled the spices as many had suggested with great results. I would use hot italian sausage next time. I don't understand all the complaints about there being too much. This fit in the 8 x 8 pan perfectly.

Very tasty! I was scared off by the curry powder, so I used cumin and chili powder. Good, but I think the curry powder would go really well. Next time, I'll use it. Roasted the squash and sweet potatoes instead of dealing with peeling them for boiling.

i thought this was good and hearty - low on cash so we made more veggies than sausage - used sour cream instead of cream and some cumin and chilli powder instead of curry - which I was thinknig would be way too strong. tripled it and froze two - nice standard cassarole.

This was good; made the potato topping exactly as written but with a bit more squash. Loved it -- will make again as a side. I wanted more veggies inside, so I cut the sausage back to about a half-pound of hot Italian (don't like sweet), and added to the veggie mix cut up carrots, celery and green beans. Subbed a spoonful of sour cream for the whipping cream, which I beat into the egg before adding it to the veggie mix. I don't like eating a lot of meat, so next time I will remove sausage completely and try a meat substitute of some kind.

Very tasty, nicely simple. Definitely not a typical shepherd's pie, though. Next time I may try some cumin instead of curry powder.

Loved the sweet potato and squash topping, which has more of an Indian influence and less of a "Thanksgiving" flavor. I used chicken and apple maple sausage, which paired nicely with the potatoes and squash. My sausage mixture seemed to be a bit dry without the added fat from a pork sausage, so I added a bit more whipping cream. Also, since the other reviews said the recipe seemed to make too much for an 8 x 8 pan, I purchased foil tart pans and made 8 individual pies. I baked and cooled on rack and froze them for lunches or some evening after work.

Very interesting and different flavors. I used extra hot sauce and extra curry, like other reviewers. Was a little spicy but my husband loved it.

Will make again.

I made this recipe with soy sausage and textured soy protein, adding some fennel, sage, oregano and crushed red pepper to give it an italian sausage flavor. The topping went very nicely with the filling. I even had some extra because the baking dish i used wasn't quite deep enough. Looking forward to leftovers the next few days to see if the flavors blend.

Awesome!! I've made this so many times and there are NEVER any leftovers. What a great combo of flavors and textures. Like other I use hot sausage and a bit more curry and hot sauce. Made a day ahead and served in individual caseroles - UNBELIEVABLE! Out out the 60 or so people I have served this to - all loved it. On the down side - they are usually too busy eating to join in conversation (past an occasional yummy noise)

This is my second review of this dish. It has been a staple for several years now. I don't even need the directions. I now use hot Italian sausage, extra curry and extra hot sauce. I have served this to over 60 people over the years and EVERBODY wants the recipe. It may sound like a bizare combination to some people - but give it a try. Easy to adapt for a vegitatian too - using veggie sausage. This is a recipe that deserves 5 forks!

Great recipe! But, although I'm adventuresome, I don't know about maple syrup and curry in the same dish. I know there ain't a lot of either, but still, I was leery. SO, I make this two different ways: either the filling as printed with just herbed mashed potato topping, or, the topping as printed and no curry in the filling. I may be missing out, but, it's been great for me both ways I mentioned. Good luck!

This is a nice variation on the usual shepherd's pie. The topping is so good I plan to serve it by itself for Thanksgiving and other fall meals. The two potatoes and the squash are just a perfect combination with the maple syrup flavor. When making it again with my sausage I think I would leave out the pepper sauce and maybe even the curry powder. I think it would also be very good with ground beef instead of sausage. In that case I would probably keep at least the curry.

St Patrick's Day 2003 - Enjoyed making this dish despite all the chopping needed. Took about 2 hrs from start to finish. To reduce the fat I used about half the sausage and rinsed it after it had been browned to get the excess grease off. My favorite part was the topping - the flavor of the sweet potatoes and butternut squash mixed with a little maple syrup was yummy.

Rating: 1
This was pretty disappointing, although I can't say that we really disliked it. I eliminated the squash and used instead a combination of yams and white potatoes. The flavor was OK, but because of the small chunks of sausage and little bits of vegetables, it came out looking like hash, and there wasn't enough sauce. I think I'm just stuck on the old standard shepherd's pie, with chunks of tender meat and veggies in a thick rich sauce, topped with buttery mashed potatoes. I still want to try the one with spinach that got rave reviews.

Rating: 3
Made exactly according to the recipe (except maybe a couple extra drops of hot sauce) and it turned out great. The sweet potato really is integral to the dish, but think you could leave out the squash. The aroma while cooking is a bonus. I needed a 9 x13 pan, though. I froze some of the leftovers and it came out a bit drier when I warmed them in the microwave so might eat leftovers next day next time. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. I don't eat red meat, so we substituted chicken sausage, and I had 1/2 & 1/2 on hand, so we used that instead of cream. Other than that, we didn't change a thing. Delicious, nutritious, and a wonderful update to an old standard (_love_ the sweet potatoes!).

I'm a convert. I never particularly cared for shepherd's pies but THIS ONE changed my opinion. It's delicious. The sweet potatoes, in addition to the touch of maple syrup, gave it a nice zip. One thing I did do was, once cooked, to place it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown it. I found that there's far too much mixture for an 8" X 8" pan so I used a 9" X 13" pan which was perfect.

OMG..this is one the most delectable things I've ever put in my mouth. POSTIVELY AWESOME. My husband & I are on Sugarbusters, so I substituted sugar free syrup for the maple syrup, green beans for the corn, and omitted the white potatoe. I have to admit, I had reservations of the "weird combo" of the spicy and the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes. Boy, was I off. This is incredible. I've tried lots of other recipes from gourmet. com and quite frankly, have been disapointed, more than not. Not with this. YUMMY! HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!!

I loved this dish. I made it for some clients (am a personal chef), but was so curious I made a lot of extra for myself and friends. Everyone thought it was excellent. However, I did make some pretty serious modifications, so guess I can't wholly vouch for the recipe as-is. I used 3/4 lb. mild Ital. Sausage and 3/4 lb. Buffalo. I also used a lot more curry, cayenne pepper (didn't have hot sauce) and coriander (at least 2x as much of each). My client also had special dietary requ.s, so I had to use soy milk instead of cream - didn't miss the extra fat at all!

Awesome! I followed the recipe except for the peas, which I left out. In their place, I just put more corn. I made it the day before, put it in the fridge, and had it in the oven for an hour before dinner. My guests were very, very impressed. I had never had shepherd's pie before. By comparison, my guests seemed to be experts on the topic, and loved this recipe -- enough that they begged me to send them the Internet address for it! I also wouldn't be one to eat sweet potatoes or squash -- and these tasted great. I'd definitely make it again and would recommend it to others.

This is great comfort food! Excellent flavors at work here. I cut back on the sausage quantity, and used a more healthy soy based product. In keeping with that theme, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and fat-free half & half, mixed with heavy cream. Very few left-overs on this one.

Wow, this was one of my rare non-pasta successes where my partner had 3 servings and raved about the great flavors. Since my partner is lactose intolerant, for the topping I used Lactaid (instead of cream) and IMO (sour-cream substitute) along with butter, seasonings, a little brown suger, and tumeric for color. Since I didn't have time to buy sweet potatoes, I used the butternut squash and red potatoes that I had handy. I followed the rest of the recipe relatively closely, although I used red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce and skipped the coriander, instead adding worcestershire as one reviewer suggested. This was one of the most delicious meals I've ever made, and I'm taking the leftovers to my sister tomorrow so that she can rave about it, too. Thanks to everyone for the variations!

This recipe GROWS on you! It really benefits from being "left over" until the next day so the flavors can meld even more. We substituted brown sugar for the maple syrup requested, and then less than half of that, and seasoned the potato topping as if it were mashed potatoes: lots of black pepper and salt. It took out the oversweetness and made it perfect. Trust me, try it.

I found this recipe easy to make and darn tasty too! I didn't follow it to the letter however. I combined the squash and the sweet potato, left out the russet. I also substituted Breakfast turkey sausage instead of Italian, it was a great substitute and worked well with the maple syrup taste of the topping. I added oregano, marjoram, chili powder and Paprika and a frozen veggie varity pack, fiesta blend I think. My guests raved about it!! Serve with Red wine like a Syrah or Merlot.

I rarely give a recipe four forks. This oine deserves it. It elevates the humble shepherds pie to a gourmet level. We used polish sausage instead of Italian with good results.

I think I may even try the sausage/beef mixture as a change of pace for beef stroganoff.

The topping was a super variation to Sheppards pie. I didn't enjoy the curry and coriander as the spice with the sausage. I would make it again by changing the recipe quite a bit. No milk or egg. Perhaps liquid such as some dark ale and worchestershire sauce, HP, and add some more savory spices to offset the sweet of the yam, squash, maple syrup sweetness. Definitely a recipe that you can play with and change to your taste buds. Perhaps if I had hot sauce it would have been a catalyst to the curry.
