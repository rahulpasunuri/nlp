I like this with Broccoli stems only. Cut stems in 1/8-1/4" slices, place in boiling water for 6 minutes first then follow as the recipe directs.

We're not big broccoli lovers in my household so I make this recipe with fresh snapped green beans instead and it is wonderful! Always a big hit for a side dish

My husband and I love broccoli. This recipe is simply delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. If you use a 1 1/2 lbs.of the vegetable, the butter and nuts combination is perfect.I served this with honey glazed salmon(found on this site)and the two were wonderful together.Will definitely make this again.

i used broccoli fresh out of the field for thanksgiving dinner and the dish was wonderful. i overcooked the broccoli so it was a bit mushy but still tasted great.

I love broccoli, but I think it is not improved by buttery almond coating.

Great side dish-- even cold as left-overs out of the fridge! Probably will debut this one again with different guests on Christmas Eve.

Made this for the quasi-in-law Thanksgiving dinner where most veggies are boiled 'til they resemble an old kitchen sponge. The toasted almonds and butter made it a rich and incredibly tasty veggie dish - even the broccoli haters had seconds!

There's nothing wrong with some butter if you're cooking at home; restaurant food is where you get the really unhealthy amounts. As for those who would like to cut down on the butter, I find when I make green beans almondine that if I use mostly olive oil and a small pat of butter, the flavor is very buttery because of the bit of butter and the toasted almonds. I started doing that when I was doing the South Beach Diet for a while, and have kept mixing butter and olive oil ever since due to the lack of difference in taste. It's also more economical.

I made this for the first time today. I was a little unsure about the lemon, but it really adds to the dish. The almonds are lovely and the dish is quick and simple to prepare. Did I mention its also very very tasty? I will definitely make this again.

This is a very tasty recipe. The buttery, lemony almonds are wonderful on broccoli!

Quick, easy and tasty! I followed the advice of others and used light butter - worked out just fine and didn't miss the extra fat/calories.

This recipe was easy, delicious, and nutritious. I would make it often as a great stand by.

Very easy, very tasty. I like this for our lighter eating and this is a great way to prepare many vegetables, which I have already. I used Land O Lakes light butter and our whole family loved it.

come on guys! butter is completely healthy! it has essential fatty acids for the brains to use! half a stick is nothing since it's divided in 4-6 servings.

don't fear the butter

It's ridiculous that anything with half a stick of butter would be considered a "healthy" option.

I have not tried this recipe, but I'm sure it would taste good with all that butter. I can't believe that it was in the health section with 7 grams of saturated fat per serving

So quick and easy - a robust recipe too, I substituted 1 tbsp peanut oil for the butter, cashews for the almonds (didn't have any) and forgot about the lemon juice, and it was still delicious. The idea is definitely becoming part of our rotation.

I did cut down the butter a little bit. It was really yummy and will be put in the rotation!

A delicious way to serve broccoli! A family favourite.

I tried this recipe with half the butter because I put on a few pounds over the holidays, and I thought that it was plenty. This is a nice way to elevate a simple side into something more special. It would be especially nice for those meals when you want a rather nice side, but you know that it will ultimately be overshadowed by everything else. Or--it can be good for one of those nights where you want some veggies but can't quite stomach plain old steamed broccoli.

This was so delicious and easy! I used blanched slivered almonds from the bulk foods section of the supermarket and vegan margarine instead of butter.
