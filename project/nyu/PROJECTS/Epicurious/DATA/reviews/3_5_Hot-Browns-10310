Agree with the cook from Louisville no cheddar--Country Ham and Cream--Also I do not believe you would like this samdwich cold-- a friend from Louisville

There was a tiny cafe in Lexington in the 1960's that made its Hot Browns with individual loaves of a brioche- type bread. They were heavenly.

My family loves this dish. I've been making this for years, and it's the first thing they ask for when it's time for Thanksgiving leftovers. So easy to make and so delicious!

It is authentic with 2 exceptions: the Cheddar should be replaced with Parmesan cheese and slice of country ham, preferably from KY, should be added under the sliced turkey. They are sensational.

A bit embarrassing, but we are moving and I had already packed up the flour and cornstarch. I had nothing to thicken this with. I spied a box of white cheddar mac and cheese. Stirred the cheddar packet into the butter and went forward w/ the recipe. It was heaven! I had crumbled bacon added it right to the sauce rather than strips . Family went WILD!

I cheated on this. Made it once per the recipe and like a previous reviewer agreed it needed something. So I topped it with heated Welsh Rarebit (from the freezer section of the market)in lieu of the sauce. Add a couple of shakes of cayenne and presto!

Doubled the recipe so we wouldn't run out and it was a good thing. They all loved it. My husband even took the meger leftovers for lunch the next day so he could enjoy it again. Rich sauce went well with the tomatoes and turkey. My 3,5 & 7 year olds loved it too.

Having lived in Kentucky for several years, I can honestly say I've never had a better Hot Brown than this recipe. Using real cheese is a distinct improvement over the ususal orange, gummy 'cheese food,' and the parmesan and cayenne are good additions.

About the only thing I didn't like about this dish was that it only made four servings. This is a simple recipe, and is better than versions I've had in most KY restaurants. Will definitely make again.

This is such a wonderful comfort food. Certainly not heart healthy but so good. I use half and half instead of milk and do not bother straining the sauce. It's great.

These are sinfully delicious! My husband liked them so much that he was very disappointed to learn that there were none left--had to share half of mine with him!

This recipe took me back.. (more years then I want to remember)when my father would take me into the Brown Hotel in Louisville for a Hot Brown. I though then that this was the most delicious meal I had ever eaten. Still is.

A very tasty way to use up leftover turkey. I will definitely make this again.
