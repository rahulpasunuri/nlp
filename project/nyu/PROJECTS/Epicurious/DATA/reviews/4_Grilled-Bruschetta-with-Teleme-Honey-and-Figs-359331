I wasn't able to find teleme cheese but instead used havarti. It was delicious the first time and so I made it again--both got excellent reviews. Very versatile and goes well as an appetizer or a dish. I will definitely make this again!

we couldn't find teleme and used gruyere instead...it's a fabulous recipe that is great all year round. formal enough for a dinner party, casual enough for lunch. nice with cracked black pepper on top.

Extremely easy and loved the flavors of the cheese, figs and honey complementing each other. Used Havarti and dark honey and of course, fresh figs. Very rich and savory. Great start to a summer meal.
