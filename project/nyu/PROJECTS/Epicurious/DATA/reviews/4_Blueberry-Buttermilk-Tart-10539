This is the best blueberry tart, a staple in my kitchen for about 18 years. The filling sets beautifully if the flour is replaced with corn starch and the baking temperature is increased very slightly. Another suggestion: do make the tart shell as in the recipe, with butter of course; it will make a big difference in taste.

I followed the recipe precisely -- not sure what happened! It didn't set at all. There were so many great reviews too. Disappointed and stumped. Won't make again. :(

This was delicious, and my guests raved and raved. I chilled the crust much longer than an hour, so it was hard to roll out, but worth the extra work. Really yummy!

not going to rate this one, as I think I'm to blame... used a gluten-free frozen pie crust (9" deep dish) instead of making my own. filling didn't set up - not sure why, but read a couple reviews that commented about making two tarts instead of one w/all the custard filling. It was quite full! disappointed, with all the positive reviews it received. not giving up on it yet - try again while blueberries are in season!

An excellent tart. I did substitue my own tart shell recipe. And for the filling, as some others have mentioned, used just a little less lemon and just a little more vanilla. Turned out wonderful.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it a little more quickly by using a purchased pie shell, and then added a topping of mixed berries and peaches glazed with simple syrup and mint. Now I understand what the earlier review meant when she said "It isn't summer at my house until we make this pie."

I can't believe I have made this tart for so many years! It is a winner every time. I use the crust recipe or, to shorten the time needed, I will use a store bought crust. The flavors are fantastic and it is my "go to" summer tart recipe. It isn't summer until this is made in my house!

The perfect tart for summer! I was feeling lazy so I did a thin graham cracker crust with lemon extract and saigon cinnamon instead of the shell. Instead of buttermilk, I used a combo of half cream half sour plain yogurt. Personally, I love lemon so I added extra zest and juice plus an extra tsp vanilla extract per other reviewer's suggestion. I also placed some sliced strawberries on top of the blueberries since I had a few extra ripe ones in the fridge. The entire pie was quick to make and since I did it in the blender, clean up was a snap too. I baked it in a bottomless pie pan and when I popped it out, it looked beautiful. Fruity lemony custard with graham crust...yum. If your fruit is ripe, I would cut back on the sugar in the custard since mine was a tiny bit too sweet. Next time I'm using splenda, fat free cream and yogurt for a healthier tart.

Summer wouldn't be summer without this Blueberry Tart. The only change I make is omitting the lemon juice and zest. We are not big lemon fans. It's perfect every time.

This was so much better than regular buttermilk pie, which I love. The blueberries added a nice texture, and the lemon flavor balanced the sweetness really well. My guests loved it and I wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this tart many times using whatever berries happen to be in season and it always turns out well. I use refrigerated pie dough from the grocery store which doesn't seem to effect the integrity of the tart and makes for a speedy dessert.

FANTABULOUS dessert! I did however adjust a few things that made it so...I added an additional teaspoon of vanilla which is always helpful. I also cut back just a little on the grated lemon zest by approximately 1/2 teaspoon which just gave a wisp of lemon, and finally instead of 2 tablespoons of flour, I used I TBSP of flour and 1.5 TBSP of small pearl Tapioca!!!!! I also served it with whip cream and drizzled blueberry glaze over for presentation. Fantastic, my company thought this was 'out of this world'!

I have made this recipe many times. The first time I had a severe headache and did not set out my items. So that when I was making the filling I forgot not only the butter but the flour as well and it still set up and tasted lovely. I prefer to make my doughs( pie, bisquit, and bread) in the food processor. The way Julia Child taught me and so many others to do on PBS T.V. I also prefer her Flaky Tart Dough( found on page 418 of " Julia And Jacques Cooking At Home") recipe. I live in the Deep South and it rains a lot. I have NEVER had problems with her tart dough. I do however agree with Jacques that the metal blade is best. I also agree that I process very little as want dicernible bits of butter. Since the dough has been handled for only a few seconds there is no need to rest it in the refrigerator. It can be rolled out right away.

The crust is delicious, as is the tart. Even my husband who isn't overly fond of lemon flavor in his desserts likes this. A perfect tart for a hot summer day!

Don't be tempted to use a store-bought crust on this tart; the crust in the recipe is fantastic and really adds to the overall flavor of the dessert. I increased the ingredients by 20% so I could use my 11" tart pan and it came out beautifully. Be sure to leave sufficient time to fully cool the tart before serving. Like other reviewers, I used less lemon zest and juice than called for. Absolutely fantastic - rave reviews from our dinner guests.

Rating: 4
Oh yum! Lemon and blueberry is one of my favorite flavor combos and this is a perfect example of that. I really wanted to make it 3 1/2 forks, because I made one change. I took the four egg whites and made them into a meringue and topped my tart with it. And next time I might up the lemon juice a bit and then it would be a 4. This will definitely become one of the seasonal desserts I wait all year for (rhubarb pie, peach cobbler, pumpkin pie...now blueberry tart!)

I gave this recipe a try since I had buttermilk, frozen blueberries, and a pre-made tart crust in the freezer. The filling was delicious. Mine set-up pretty well after 35 minutes in the oven and a few hours of cooling at room temp.

I was very excited to make this tart after reading the other reviews. Unfortunately it was just ok. Everyone ate it but no one was that excited about it. The buttermilk custard is quick and easy but it does not compare to making a real lemon curd filling. There is a fantastic (and easy) recipe for the real thing in The Pie and Pastry Bible. I would not make this again.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I was in a hurry and used a store bought crust, it was good. BUT the second time I made the crust and it truly is worth the effort. This is a wonderful pie/tart, especially if you can find flavorful fresh blueberries. And don't scrimp on the lemon, I think the pie would be too bland without the lemon. I had to add two more tablespoons of water to the pie crust, and I rolled it out between saran wrap, it was still somewhat crumbly, but I patted in what didn't roll. I also have cooked the pie and extra ten minutes, based on other reviews. I have received nothing but rave reviews. The lemon with the blueberry is to die for!!

Rating: 4
Great recipe, everyone loved it. The proportions are also correct if, like me, you chose to make six 4" tarts. I cut the lemon down to 1t lemon zest and 1.5t lemon juice, which was plenty but I actually think it would have been fine to use all as stated. Next time I will use slightly less blueberries (even though I love them) to balance out the flavor contrast between the custard and berry. The tart tasted better after standing for about 6 hours, and although after several days the blueberries bled a little, the crust and the taste held up well. Best flavor was on day two.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in 1990. Everyone loves it. I also make the blueberry ice cream that was in the same issue. The two of these recipes served together is a knockout.

This is a fabulous recipe. I made six 4 inch tarts instead and did not have enough crust for the 6th one so used leftover pie crust. I found the crust needed a little more cold water, probably 1 to 2 tbsp more but I chilled it well and it rolled out beautifully. What hasn't been said about this filling... it was out of this world. Using the specified ingrediants it was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet and tart. I had extra filling so filled a custard cup and it was devine. Couldn't wait for it to come to room temperature before I ate it. Loved it warm but I can see the custard is a little loose and that's where making individual tarts works well. I am serving after dinner tonight and I know my audience, they will eat it up!!!

Rating: 4
Such a wonderful tart with fresh blueberries! The lemon in the custard was the perfect amount to compliment the berries. Tart dough can be fussy. I never roll out the dough, instead I lightly flour my fingers and press the dough right into the pan-much much easier than rolling it out. The result is the same without the headache.

Rating: 4
GREAT recipe! So bright and refreshing, and relatively easy to make. I made it for Mothers' Day and everyone loved it. I followed the directions to the tee and everything worked out great, except my filling did come out slightly runny. I baked the filling for 35 minutes because it seemed "just set"... but next time I will wait another 5-10 minutes to let it set better. I didn't have a problem with the crust dough being too soft - it was firm and sturdy. When you first try to roll it into a ball, it may seem dry, but if you keep at it, it comes out just right, so I don't see a need to add anything extra to the dough ingredients. I would also grease my tart pan next time, as it was slightly difficult to get the crust off the pan, which led to crumbled pieces a couple of times. In any case, it was DELICIOUS and overall a big hit, will definitely make again!

What a perfect tart to ring in blueberry season up here in Maine! I wasn't quite sure how to tell when the tart was "set," as this is my first effort at a tart, and it ended up quite gooey even after I baked it for almost 40 minutes. Regardless, it was delicious and a big hit after dinner! I followed the recipe to the letter.

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe - and much easier than making a separate lemon curd. The cooked blueberries tasted delightful with the tart lemon and it looked gorgeous with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. Too bad there is no picture! The crust tasted good, but I had to add an extra 2 Tbsp of liquid (milk) to form a dough. It came out a bit soft- but I rolled it between saran wrap and it worked fine. B/C I was in a rush I chilled the dough in the freezer both times. Also didn't cool much before proceeding to adding the berries and baking the filling. Will make again and again!

I can't make pastry and usually purchase all crusts but I dove into this and found the crust was a bit soft - I pressed it into the tart pan anyway and proceeded. From comments in other reviews, I was worried it would be too runny, so I chilled overnight and it was perfect. I usually take it to cook outs and I will try it with a regular pie crust this summer. I love the berry/lemon contrast so this is great for me.

Loved this! My husband does not like cooked fruit (too slimy), custard (same reason), nor lemon-flavored desserts. Obviously, I did not expect him to like this dessert. He LOVED it, and asked me to make another one the very next day. It's a light, frothy buttermilk custard with whole blueberries baked in. Does not need the ice cream, as it is so moist.

Truly delicious -- I give it 3/12 forks. My anorexic cousin who never asks for seconds of anything asked for another piece! It's a perfect summer dessert if you feel like baking, and if you use a purchased crust (which I never do) it would be incredibly easy!

I used my favorite all butter crust, slightly sweetened after trying the specified crust recipe. That is a mess and I am an experienced pastry baker. I was short on lemons when making this but had a bottle of Boyajian Lemon Oil (for food not furniture) and instead of 1 Tbs. zest, I substituted 1.2 tsp. of the oil. The lemon flavor was wonderful and even. I don't think I'd bother with the zest again. I did use frozen blueberries and did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer. The tart was the hit dessert of the evening.

This was absolutely delicious. I had to use a glass pie pan and just made a bit of extra crust and it was perfect. I baked it an extra 10 minutes per the other reviews and chilled it overnight and it set up quite well. I also added a bit of extra flour just to be sure. Just to jazz it up a bit I made a sauce of pureed blueberries, lemon juice and a touch of sugar and simmered it a bit and then spread it over the top and it thickened into a gorgeous blue-purple jelly that covered my less-than-perfectly shaped crust. The lemon zing to this was just right and it received rave reviews. I think it would also be lovely in a conventional piecrust for a slightly less rich dessert, as this packs quite a punch with all that butter :o)

I did not make the crust in this recipe (I used a frozen shell), so I am not rating it. But I do want to add my comments. It was really easy and looked very pretty. I used 2 tsp. zest and the full amount of lemon juice, and I thought it was fine. But it is really a custard, and it seemed strange to me to have a custard in a pie crust. I think it would be much better -- from a presentation standpoint - if it were baked in individual-size tarts or ramekins. Just my two cents!

this tart was delicious! Since I had never made anything like it before practically alone, I really wasn't expecting much. My grandmother gave hme some help while making the crust, and I did the rest. It was delicious! This should be just about the easiest tart recipie I've ever seen. Kids should use this as their first tart recipie.

I made this tart twice this week. It is excellent! I will definitely keep the recipe for an easy, pretty, and delicious dessert. I did not have many fresh berries on hand, so the first time, I used half fresh and half frozen. The second time I used all frozen. It was zangier and significantly better with the fresh berries - a bit non-descript with frozen. I found the "custard" to be a bit too runny at room temperature, even when I baked it longer than directions said. Would be perfect as a chilled, refreshing dessert for a summer dinner party.

This one's a keeper! I bought a "bucket" of blueberries at Sam's Club and couldn't eat them fast enough, so found this recipe. As others have, I used the food processor for the crust. I didn't refrigerate the dough between mixing it and rolling it - I find that rolling it out just after mixing, while still at room temp., is easier. The crust was reasonably easy to handle and tender after baking, but not too crumbly. That's just as it should be for a tart, which, unlike a pie, has to be separated from its side supports to serve. I did refrigerate the dough in the tart pan before baking, for half an hour. The filling was fabulous! The flavor was very intense and I could taste the lemon even though I "only" used a teaspoon. I had no problem with my custard, and I didn't even use "real" buttermilk - I used a powdered buttermilk that's mixed with water. I found it in the baking section years ago and always keep some in the fridge. Thank you, Epicurious!

Tasty & "summer"y, found this recipe just at the height of a bumper blueberry season. For those who are totally lazy (like me!) when it comes to making pie shells, I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, worked just great! A note to the folks whose pies didn't "gel", I gave mine about 10 more minutes than the recipe called for, and it set up just fine.

Based on earlier reviews, I reduced the amount of lemon zest and juice (I used 1 tsp zest, 2 tsp juice) and found it to be delightful. My husband and I ate half of it the first night because it was so darn good. Can't wait to make it again!

Liked the flavor combinations but wouldn't make it again due to it's high fat content - have other desserts I'd rather splurge on. Also had to bake mine additional 10 min and it was still very runny. It did firm up after it cooled but texture was still very soft. Lastly, recommend not keeping this for no more than 2 days as the crust gets soggy and the filling begins to break down.

i wasn't very careful making this recipe, and the results were still quite good. the sweet crust, ripe berries, sprightly lemon, and tangy buttermilk offer a marvelous balance of tart/sweet flavors. a single bite has a lot of flavors and textures to contemplate. i do recommend that you don't substitute this crust recipe with another - its relative sweetness is important to the overall balance, and it also has a wonderfully chompy, buttery taste.

This recipe is DROP DEAD delicious! I was going to short-cut and use a pre-made pastry shell, and I'm glad I didn't. The crust really adds to the overall flavor, and it really went over tremendously at tonight's dinner party. One tip, though, is to make sure your foil completely covers the edges of the tart when you're baking it-- I had one slightly burned spot where I didn't seal it properly.

I didn't rate the recipe because I made what I thought would be a minor change, and I think it changed the texture. I substituted fresh wild blackberries for blueberries, because there is a bumper crop growing at the side of the creek by my house. The tart was absolutely delicious, but it did take a long time for the filling to set. I think my berries released more juice than blueberries would have done. However, my husband and I ate two slices each and he said I outdid myself with this recipe. The crust is definately worth the time to make it - I don't think it would have been nearly as good with a ready made crust (and I am a frequent user of the ready made crust). We had it with whipped cream as another reviewer suggested.

I took the suggestion to do the pastry in the food processor, but rather than rolling it out, I patted it into the pan, then chilled it. (Much easier and less messy--a big deal for me!)

This was beautiful, delicious, and easy - what more could one possibly ask for? The only modification I made was to dust my tart pan with raw sugar (the big sugar crystals) which added a nice crunch to the crust. I had to take a picture of it before we devoured it.

I am no Pastry Queen, but my friends at work think I am now. I saw this and had wanted to try it since I have always found buttermilk to be a secret ingredient and blueberries are on sale. I made the crust before bed and finished the process before work in the morning. It was not at all difficult, but of course the crust shrank and I had some extra filling (delicious baked without the crust.) I think that I will "press the dough into the tart pan" right after mixing it - if that it what some of the other reviewers meant. Two people claimed that they could have eaten the entire thing and several others just had to have the recipe. I will cerainly make this again!

Beautiful, tart, light but luscious and delicious. (Are you convinced yet?) Although I tend to put more lemon zest than recipes ask for, this time I listened to the reviewer who used 1 tsp. instead of the called for 1 tablespoon. It tasted tart and perfect; I was glad that I had, for once, used restraint with the zest (although perhaps it would have been fine with more.) And thanks to the reviewer from Oklahoma City I didn't bother rolling out the dough, but just quickly pressed it into the tart pan with my fingers. So easy, no mess, so why bother doing anything else? I was so in love with the filling that I might try it with a less rich crust (regular pie crust) next time, but making it for guests I would stick with the wonderful crust recipe given here. Any way you slice it, this one is a real keeper.
