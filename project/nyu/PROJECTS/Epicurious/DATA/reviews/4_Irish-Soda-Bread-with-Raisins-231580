Delish! I cut the butter into very small cubes which made cutting it in super easy. I will definitely make this again for breakfast and not just St. Pat's!

Excellent and easy recipe-loved by the kids and the grownups. I did take the suggestions of using unsalted butter and soaking the raisins. I served it with the Corned Beef with Marmalade-Whisky Glaze and Green Onion Potatoes for St. Patricks Day dinner. Will definitely make again and give as gifts for Easter.

Make between 6 and 8 of these each year for our St. Pat's Party. Make them 2 days ahead and wrap good in plastic wrap. They keep well and everyone loves them. I use unsaled butter, for the person saying there was too much salt.

This is just so easy to make and tastes so good. Yes, it has butter and raisins (none of that for the purists) but it's really worth it. Make the slice cut of the cross on the top before sprinkling sugar. Chase the devil out! I did the trick with the chilled butter and cheese shredder. It did speed up the crumbling process. Enjoy.

I made this recipe as stated, and it was OK. I felt there was either too much salt or not enough sugar. I will definitely make it again, with variations: 1. All 5 TBS of sugar in the dough, plus additional sugar on top. 2. Soak the raisins before adding. Depending upon how 1 and 2 go, maybe: 3. Add an egg.

I have made this recipe many times over the years. It has a wonderful crumb and flavor. However, you must eat it the same day you bake it. Unlike other, more authentic Irish soda breads, it goes stale quickly and cannot be "revived" with toasting. I prefer a brown soda bread, but my family likes the sweetness of this one.

Absolutely easy to make. I included caraway seeds because I like them. I have made it with craisins too one time when I was out of raisins. My Irish husband loves it, and it's so easy I can have it on the table in no time. This has become my "go-to" soda bread recipe.

A great soda bread! Although I might be biased because this recipe reminds me so much of the soda breads of my childhood.. The only difference I made was to add a beaten egg to the cup of buttermilk. I am so happy to have found this recipe!

This was VERY good! I've never made Irish Soda Bread, and so, on St. Patrick's Day I thought I'd give it a try. My son has a milk alergy so I made the following adjustments: used margerine instead of butter and added a 1/2 t. of butter flavor and used soy "milk" and added a t. white vinegar instead of buttermilk. The other changes included substituting 1/8 C of wheat germ and rolled oats for 1/4 of the flour. I also had no raisins so I chopped some dried apricots. It baked for about 32 mins and it was ready without being dry. My family enjoyed this bread and I would make it again.

This is *very* good, the first soda bread I've made that I was really happy with. I used currants instead of raisins, soaked in Irish whiskey, then drained. Added about two tsps caraway seeds. Slashed an "x" in the top of the loaf. Used coarse sugar for the 1 tblsp sprinkled on top and baked in an 8" iron skillet. It took the full 40 minutes to bake. Delicious toasted the next morning.

I had this last year, made by someone else, and thought it really good. So today, I thought I would give it a try. I substituted one cup of the all purpose flour with one cup of Spelt flour, and it was even MORE delicious! Not quite so white, a bit more authentic, but still with that tender crumb and hint of sweetness. As another poster suggested, I grated the chilled butter on a box grater and it was such a nice, easy trick! Will make again each year.

I have always wanted to make Irish Soda Bread but have been intimidated. This was very easy and very tasty. I ate almost a third of the loaf myself before my family got any. I will be making this a lot. I can't wait to make this for my in-laws from England.

Great recipe. Try soaking the raisins in Irish whiskey. That'll moisten it up and give it a little kick. I knew this recipe was good when an Irish woman I work with tried it and asked me for the recipe. She's made soda bread all her life, but swears this is better than hers.

Rating: 4
Very good basic recipe that's easy to add your own spin on. Despite having butter in it, I like how simple it is. I took a previous reviewer's advice and made 1.5x the recipe, forming 2 loaves on a cookie sheet. Instead of raisins, I added dried cranberries as well as a few teaspoons of caraway seeds. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, upping the buttermilk b/c of the whole wheat. Oh, and I used a few tablespoons less sugar. With all my modifications, it still came out very tasty! Crunchy outer crust and soft, light center, not too sweet either.

Rating: 3
I think the flavor is good and the crust is nice but mine came out a little dry. I attribute this to living in a higher altitude so next time I'll take it out 5 min earlier. I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour other than that followed the recipe exactly which I recommend b/c it's a good one!

Rating: 4
Very easy and so good!! First attempt was a success - followed the recipe as written. Couple tricks: (1) freeze the butter, then grate using a micro plane - blends easily this way; (2) plump the raisins in hot water; (3)add the drained/dried raisins to the dry ingredients/butter, adding the buttermilk last; (4) after mixing butter milk in with a fork and pulling into a ball, toss some flour on top of the dough, then turn out on your hand and flour the other side, then form a ball. Much easier to work with this way. I used a parchment covered baking sheet (didn't use a pan). Other suggestion: For two nice-sized loaves, I made 1.5 times the recipe and divided dough into 2 loaves; both fit nicely on same baking sheet. I prefer this size loaf, especially when sharing with friends.

Rating: 4
The other reviews said it! This is a great bread. The consistency is really nice, moist but not too heavy. It was a hit and I will be making it again for sure. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just a tad sticky, but nothing a little flour on the hands can't fix!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe two times now and it turned out perfect both times. While not a traditional Irish soda bread, it is more of a traditional Irish American soda bread. I like the sweetness which makes it perfect to accompany a salty meal, breakfast or for snack. Its wetter than a traditional dough, but if you flour up your hands as directed and plop into your greased pan there are no problems.

I made this using cake flour instead of regular AP flour, and was very pleased with the delicate crumb texture. The sweetness level is nice, especially with the extra sugar sprinkled on the top, and goes well with a strong cup of black tea.

To everyone! Being Irish meself, a true Irish Soda Bread contains just soda, flour, sour milk (buttermilk)and salt. NOTHING ELSE. This is why when you buy Soda Bread from a market it is not sweet, moist, etc. If it is, it is not a true traditional Irish Soda Bread. My Gran said if they were lucky enough to fine & afford wheat flour they would add it.Soda bread was a daily bread that didn't keep long and had to be baked every few days. It was s not a festive "cake" and did not contain candied fruit, rum/whisky, seeds, raisins (adding raisins? then it becomes "spotted dog", or any other ingredient. There are recipes for using the above but they are not the traditional soda bread. Most recipes will be Americanized to suit the Amercian "Sweet tooth". As you can see by reading the comments, most of you have taken the basic recipe and altered it to suit you. So have fun and lets celebrate the month of March as "Irish History Month" after all we had an Irish President!

Love this rich moist recipe that I have been making for years. I now make it with my 3 year old daughter whose Irish grandmother always lovingly baked scones and soda breads for all her neighbors. My husband's Irish aunts and uncle thought it was wonderful.

I think I may have rated this before a couple of years ago but I have made it several times since. This is a great recipe. I make with 1 c white flour, 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 c oat flour or rye flour and reduce salt to 3/4 tsp (may need to reduce further to 1/2 tsp, may depend on saltiness of the butter). The dough sometimes pretty sticky but I just dump it out (like a huge drop biscuit) to keep some of the rusticness (I don't want a perfectly smooth top or sides). The secret to this recipe is to cut in the butter until it is a coarse meal (not fine) and to not overmix the dough. I usually make on a cookie sheet and the bread spreads out a bit. I just break off pieces - wonderful tasting! It tastes a lot higher fat than it is, even though there are only 3 Tbsp butter.

This is a great recipe! As a complete klutz in the kitchen, I am impressed! It tastes great, even though I forgot the rasins (I used sultanas) until after I'd placed the tin in the oven. Took it back out, mixed them in right in the tin and crossed my fingers. No worries! I found the dough impossibly gooey - even with floured hands. Did I do something wrong? Maybe a bit less milk? Any feedback would be a big help - I'd like to form the mix into a ball like it says, instead of a messy glob.

This was my first time making soda bread, and I was really impressed! I used 1 c. white flour, 3/4 c. whole- wheat flour, and 1/4 c. old- fashioned oats (soaked in buttermilk). Next time I might try cutting out the white flour altogether. I will also reduce the salt. It was really good - I ate it plain, no need for extra butter or spreads. I will probably be making this year-round. So much better than the standard supermarket St. Pat's soda bread.

Such an easy recipe! I should have left out the raisins (as I don't like them anyways, but thought I'd try them in the bread). I never got the dough to form a ball. I think this was because when I added the raisins they were damp from the OJ I had soaked them in and that gave too much moisture to the dough. Nonetheless, the bread came out delicious - I still can't believe how easy it was!

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper! I had always made mine with only soda but the addition of baking powder gives such a lightness without tasting like a biscuit. The X is a must to also prevent doughiness. I made mine into scones by cutting all the way through 4 times. A great St. Pattie's Day treat!!!

I found this recipe on Epicurious in a moment of desperation -- I had a lot of guests arriving in less than an hour for a corned-beef-and-cabbage dinner and realized I had no bread.

I made this for St. Patty's Day and it was excellent. Used 1 c white, 3/4 c whole wheat and 1/4 c oat flour. Reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp (but I think it would have been fine with the 1 tsp, as called-for). Soaked raisins in rum. This was super fast to make and took less than 35 min to bake. It is really more like a giant scone, rather than the standard dry Irish soda bread and is fun to break into chunks/wedges for serving, instead of cutting into slices. This is my favorite Irish soda bread and I will make again throughout the year. It would be great with dried cranberries or cherries with some walnuts added, too.

It was quick and easy to make, but best of all, the ingredients were all ones that I already had on hand. The one exception was that I had to substiute for the buttermilk--used 1 c non-fat milk mixed with 1 T white vinegar. It all worked beautifully.

fabulous! this is indeed a fool-proof recipe. My bread-butter mixture did not "clump", as a previous reviewer indicated; I used 1 TBSP lemon juice + 1 cup milk in lieu of buttermilk; and I forgot to flour hands and shape dough into ball in the pan, instead just pouring it all in haphazardly. Never mind-- the results (took it out of oven at 27 minutes, bread was browned and crisp at edges and had started to pull away from sides of pan) were addictingly delicious. I'm eager to see how it rewarms for tomorrow's breakfast.

Excellent, and so easy to make! I can't believe how simple it is to prepare, and how good it was!

It was a huge success with everyone, and I'd definitely make this again. It took very little time to make (for once, a recipe which is accurate for preparation time!) and tasted excellent reheated with butter.

Very good: moist, tasty, addictive. I was worried because the butter and flour did not form clumps at all, the combination was still quite fine, but I forged ahead, and the bread turned out perfectly. I baked it in a cast iron skillet, though did not spread it out to the sides, per the directions. I omitted the sugar on top; the bread is sweet enough and I may omit some in the flour the next time. I baked for less than the full time, it was moist, and needed no butter or anything. Terrific and quite easy.

This is delicious and has the unusual advantage of being a very satisfying baked good that does not have a lot of butter in it.

Many of the recipes for Soda Bread on this site merit 4 forks. This one is unique in that it can be eaten before, during or after a meal. Quick and easy to make, it's texture, lightness and slight sweetness are that of a big scone. A great accompaniment to braised, roasted or corned beef that can be pulled apart or sliced, eaten as is or toasted, by itself or with butter or jam. Not essential, but worth noting, are others' suggestion to soak and drain the raisins before adding them to the dough mixture.

Yum! This is very different than the other soda bread I make. This one is light and airy, as others have said, like a biscuit. Would be hard to spread stuff on it (the soda bread I normally make you slice like regular bread into thin slices...this one, no way that would work). Great texture, just sweet enough and good with any dried fruit mixed in. Skipped the sugar on top and that was fine. Needed about 30-35 minutes, 40 would overdo it.

This bread was like a huge biscuit: so tender the crumb would nearly fall apart in one's hand. Delicious. The recipe responded well to my tweaking; I wanted a savory version, so omitted the sugar altogether. I also substituted whole wheat flour for white, and used a loaf pan instead of a round cake one. Made a very small loaf, but a great shape. Lastly, I sprinkled the bottom of the pan with cornmeal for a crunchy element, which was perfect. Lovely with jam and clotted cream.

For the normal dry Irish soda bread, this was a great change! I had to add 1/2-1 cup extra flour, as the dough was too moist, and used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

A wonderful recipe. Delicious, easy and quick. My boyfriend and I just loved it. This will be a staple in our kitchen. Because I can't find buttermilk in Florence, I've tried using regular milk and it still turns out nicely. I leave out the raisins because I rather dislike them. A great recipe to use when the bakery is closed. This is an uncomplicated, yeast-free bread made with ingredients already in the pantry.

this recipe is great. my father has been making it since i was little, and i'm 26 now and this year i wanted to make it. just because i am so used to it, i add cinnamon to it, it adds another dimension. about 1/2 teaspoon. not too much, just a hint of flavor. this recipe is also the bomb with dried cranberries (craisins) or dried blueberries...as a substitute for raisin-haters. this is the most moist, delicious bread i've ever had.

I served this with our annual corned beef and cabbage dinner. Our guests commented on how it was not as dry as other Irish soda breads that they have tried. It was not too sweet and VERY easy to make.

We served this bread with 137 dinners at our local pub's St. Paddy's dinner March 12th. It received rave reviews from all. Patrons who normally don't care for Irish Soda Bread went out of their way to tell us it was the best they have ever had. the bread is rich and moist, and, easy to make. This bread will be an annual tradition for us.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I have made many Irish soda breads over the past 15 years and this one is easy, fast, and has just the right amount of sweetness.
