Very Easy and very delicious. Guests raved. I add a little coconut milk for richness and extra red curry paste. Will make these again!

Made several times with people begging for more. And I suggest plating on a bed of sea salt (keeps shells from falling over). I've seen guests knocking into eachother to get more. Only change - cut vegetables smaller so they fit better on shell. Pair with a glass of dry white wine and you've got a party.

I've made this 3x and each time it's been a huge success. The flavors are incredible...and the leftovers (that don't fit in the shells) are always consumed in minutes...with my guests running into the kitchen with their forks! This is an amazing recipe!

I have made this three times now. Excellent presentation. They go surprisingly fast and it's the perfect make-ahead elegant appy.

A question -- are the mussels served cold or at room temperature? Is the curry mixture gritty?? Sounds like everyone loves this, I'm just having trouble picturing it. Thanks.

My guests loved this. Very easy to make. I would chop the veggies smaller next time.

This knocked um out at my picnic. Didn't bother with shells, substitued baggette. Also steamed mussels in white wine om place of water.

This was great. Give yourself enough time for preparation--its not hard, just time consumer. My guests loved it.

I made this dish and took it to a going away do, and it was the rave of the party. Even the people that were not mussel fans were into them.

I had 20 guests over for a very elegant six-course meal. This was one of eight hors d'oeuvres that I served. Everyone thought they were simply fabulous. I don't like to make any recipe twice, but this one I will definitely do again. When you are making many hors d'oeuvres and need to make some in advance, this is a great candidate. I would serve this in any season as well.

This was a hit during Christmas. My husband does not eat mussels but once he tried this dish, he couldn't stop raving about it. The guests were equally impressed. This is very simple and tasty.

Hmmm, not bad at all. This would also go well with oysters instead of muscles.

An outstanding appetizer for a large party. Big flavors and beautiful presentation with the convenience of make-ahead preparation. Guests slurped them up readily then asked for the recipe!

It was a hit at my wine and appetizer party. Very easy to prepare. Adding 1/2 juice of fresh lime and a little bit of sugar give it extra flavor.

Really delicious, a little spicy and a beautiful presentation. I brought them to an outdoor concert and they were perfect-- we slurped them right off the shells!
