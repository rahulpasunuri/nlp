Love this! The sauce really finishes the dish off. I did not use this recipe for the crepes, used a family staple. Other than that, didn't change anything. Will definitely make it again.

You can boil the rice for up to 2 hours. Blister the peppers, cut them in half, put them in a tupperware container and shake them periodically until the skins loosen. Use lots of mushrooms and cut the salt in half. These are too delicious not to make. Absolutely wonderful!

I made these for a luncheon and they were a huge hit with the ladies. Yes, they are time consuming, but definitely worth doing. I used chantarelles and baby portobellos , which worked beautifully.

This was delicious and not complicated, once a few simplifying steps were taken. Used jarred peppers, bought pre-sliced baby bellas, and used a vegan crepe recipe that only has 5 ingredients (flour, chickpea flour, salt, olive oil, water). If you're not into vegan crepes, then you could just use your regular recipe w/ scallions added and serve rice with or in the crepes (as I did). The flavor was still there and it was SO much easier. I made approximately half of the recipe and it served my husband and I with no leftovers. We only had an antipasto dish before hand and asparagus w/ the entree, so yours might go further w/ more sides. And wine...this meal was too festive not to have wine. Also, I used some of the reserved mushroom liquid instead of water in the red pepper sauce. Try this!! It can be a fun and special weeknight meal.

I am not a vegetarian and this receipe was fantastic and comes across elegant. I made the "Peacable Feast" menu minus dessert this weekend and it was more-ish. Definately worth the effort - the best feature of the menu is almost all of the items are make-ahead and reheat plus all the roasting and reheating is at the same temperature. Just use jarred roasted red peppers rather than messy DIY.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! It was time-consuming to make, but well worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect. I used the left-over mushroom filling in omelets the next morning, and served the leftover red pepper sauce on the side. Delicious!

The presentation of this dish is impressive, but it is lacking in flavor. Overall, the dish was just bland. Maybe adding some cheese, as another reviewer suggests, or cream to the red pepper sauce would give it some more flavor. For the many hours it takes to make this recipe, its just not worth it.

I loved the crepes, sauce, and filling, but I thought that it was unnecessary to bake the filled crepes. Instead, while the fresh crepes were still warm, I heated up the mushroom filling and filled the crepes while everything was hot. I served it immediately instead of baking with unnecessary butter. Also, when I filled the crepes I added some crumbled feta, which added a fresh bite.

So good... super-savory. A wonderfully hearty vegetarian dish that will please meat-eaters. It is time consuming, though. Don't try and cook it from scratch after you get home from work. You'll be eating at ten. Do all the prep you can the day before. I will make this again but next time I'll puree all of the rice except for a half cup for texture. Making the crepe batter as directed makes for a very thick, slightly spongey wrap. I would also recommend chopping the mushrooms into smaller bits after slicing them thin -- just small enough to make for a more spreadable filling once they're all cooked down. The pepper sauce is perfect. It's worth it to roast them over the open flame of the stove top.

A really wonderful recipe. Much better to make the rice, the filling and the sauce ahead of time and finish it up the next day. It's really not hard, just time consuming. No need to slather butter on the crepes before baking (slightly keeps the calories down!).

I made this dish for my roommate and I on a special occasion. She is on a dairy and wheat free diet and I don't eat meat. The reviews made me nervous, but it was too perfect not to try. It was amazing. I used a more varied ammount of mushrooms, and not enough to make up for the ammount of cremini's the recipe calls for. It was a little salty in the end because of that. But delicious. The sauce rocked. More mushrooms would have made it better, but that was totally my fault. I would make this again in a heartbeat. Definitely take advantage of the make-ahead suggestions. Otherwise it takes a wicked ammount of time to prepare. And one thing I would suggest is cutting your peppers in half, broiling them well, and putting them in the largest container you have with a tight cover and shake them every once in a while. It loosens it up better. Don't worry about cooling it too long, within reason. BUT cook the tar out of the rice. I found two hours to be good for mine. Ok, I'll stop blabbing :) Have fun :)

We prepared this as the veggie option for Christmas dinner, and it was a big flop. The crepes were dry and unexciting... disappointing after all the work we put into them.

Made this for vegetarian Thanksgiving entree. Agreed: only need 1/2 the filling, but ate the rest at another meal, but could be because crepes were thicker than normal due to my rushing around. Did not add scallions and rice to crepe batter because I ran out of time. Left out pepper sauce for the same reason. Still was delicious. The meat eaters wanted it, too. Will make it for Christmas Eve.

We cooked this recipe as part of a complete dinner that was featured in the November 2002 Gourmet. It was all excellent and was a dinner to remember. We had the suggested wine (a Columbia Crest Syrah) that matched this dish quite well. Be warned though, it took two of us most of a full day to prepare all of the dishes. It took a number of attempts to get a satifactory crepe because of the amount of solids in the batter. We had a substantial amount of wild rice left over (probably could have cut the amount in half). I made the pepper sauce two nights ahead.

Luckily I tested this recipe ahead of my vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner. It was delicious but I had trouble making the crepes once the wild rice and scallions were stirred into the batter--they all clumped in the middle as I poured the batter into the pan. I had better luck the next time by keeping them out of the batter, then sprinkling a little of each over the crepe as soon as I had spread the batter over the pan. Agree that there is no need for waxed paper separators (and I refrigerated these a day ahead). Also, we found the red pepper sauce uninspiring, so I made a Pinot Noir reduction sauce which was perfect! Saute shallots in some butter or oil, add flour to make a roux, cook a little, add wine and reduce by half, then add stock, rosemary and thyme and reduce again--if not thick enough, add some buerre manie (kneaded butter and flour) at the end. Also, we found that 2 filled crepes per serving was huge, most people only ate one.

Delish! Definitely labor-intensive (it took me 3 hours from boiling the wild rice to the first bite of finished crepe), but worth it. This is a great special occasion vegetarian recipe. I used dried shitake mushrooms instead of the porcini and only 3/4 cup dried wild rice. I thinned the crepe batter with 1/3 cup more milk and I found that it took about 4 tablespoons of batter per crepe. Don't bother with the wax paper either. Don't forget the tasty sauce, it is crucial.

Well, I'm going to blaze ahead and prepare this--hopefully it hasn't been so disappointing for others that no one bothered to review it and say so! It sounds absolutely delicious: I will let everyone know how it turns out.
