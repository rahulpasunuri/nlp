When the frosting was first mixed and still warm I was afraid it would stay too runny. I was wrong -- firmed out and easy to spread. Throughly cooled and it's a perfect, creamy, delicious frosting. Will be a go-to recipe from now on for my cakes.

A resounding 4 forks. This will be my go to chocolate icing from now on. It's superb. I made the recipe exactly as written. I used one Lindt 99% cacao bar and whipped the finished icing using my Kitchenaid with the whisk attachment. The icing was wonderfully smooth and rich. The presence of the sour cream was not discernible by me or my guests who where surprised it was one of the ingredients. The recipe makes enough icing to cover the top and sides of 2 - 9" layer cakes easily.

I used SemiSweet chips and doubled the recipe. Frosting was amazing and the perfect amount for a 2 layer cake w/ 9 inch rounds. Not too sour at all!

I made this recipe tonight exactly as written except I added a couple handfuls of semi-sweet chocolate chips and whisked the cocoa powder in the pan with melted butter and chocolate while on the heat for a few seconds to give it a cooked flavor. I beat with hand mixer till paler in color and very fluffy. Was very pleased with the result on my devils food cake.

Tasty and easy! Freezes well for icecream cake. Also works well in cake balls. Versatile and old-fashioned "mom-made" tasting.

Good. I found I needed to use 3 oz chopped chocolate to give it more body. Oh, and I only used 1/2 cup sour cream, although I think would have been fine w/ using 2/3 cup....just thinner than I wanted it. I can only get about 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups out of it, though! Anyone else get 3 cups?

I liked this, but I did change the recipe to make it more chocolatey, less sweet, and less tangy. I used 2 oz unsweetened plus 2 oz semisweet chocolate, increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup, and decreased the sour cream to 1/2 cup. To me, that gave me just the right balance of flavors. Beautiful color too. Great frosting and far less fattening than most other chocolate frosting recipes on this site.

I had been looking for an easy frosting recipe to go with the Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake that I starting making years ago off of a recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa container. Because of other comments, i left out the cocoa and used a little bit more sugar. It came out silky and smooth. The sour cream gives it just a hint to balance out the sweetness. I might try it with the cocoa next time, but this is a simple and great recipe!

this was delicious and so easy. It did not have the raw taste that a lot of frostings do, the melted butter probably helps. This will be my standard chocolate icing.

YUMMY! I only made a third of this recipe as I only needed a tiny bit for a simple, small cake I had made. Even when "guess-timating" the measurements, it still came out awesome. I love that the ingredients are the kind usually had at hand (well, at least for me) and that the recipe is so simple. If you don't want your frosting too sweet, use less sugar! And if you don't want the slight tang that sour cream is going to give, by all means, don't use this recipe!

My chocolate cake and I loved this frosting. I used my KitchenAid and it was really creamy. I will absolutely use this frosting recipe again.

I loved this frosting. Those who complained about the recipe either didn't whip it long enough or didn't read the recipe well. I wanted something a little different than my usual whipped ganache for some chocolate cupcakes--I made a half batch of this recipe, which is the perfect amount for piping onto a dozen cupcakes. This whipped up (I used a KitchenAid, so maybe I had an advantage there) very smooth and into a very pretty, glossy milk chocolate-looking frosting. Not too sweet, had a nice bittersweet deep chocolate flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again for chocolate frosting!

This is a delicious, easy and inexpensive frosting. My boyfriend loved it. Very smooth--melts in your mouth. Perhaps the people who didn't like it didn't stir it enough after the addition of the sugar. I whisked for about 5 minutes till the frosting was glossy and smooth. Excellent!

I rarely try new frosting recipes, but I was looking for something a little different for my daughter's birthday cake. This worked perfectly. It is wonderfully dark and not too sweet, perfect for the dark chocolate lovers in your crowd. Even my milk chocolate son liked it! It was easier to make than it seemed at first, so I will definitely make it again. It made exactly the right amount for a two-layer 8" cake with a smooth surface, but if you want more fluff, I would suggest increasing the recipe by 50 per cent.

looked very pretty, but the taste! way too sweet, with a weird astringency from the sour cream, and a slightly gritty texture on the tooth. threw it out, what a waste of money.

A very simple recipe; good, old-fashioned fudge flavor. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so I substituted w/semi-sweet chocolate chips and it worked well. I have made this three times already!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if this was just bad. I'm still on my search for the BEST chocolate frosting!

what happened to the other cup of sugar? after adding the first cup, is it just 'to taste' similar to the sour cream?

This is the best chocolate frosting my family has ever tasted. They have requested it repeatedly since I first made it, nearly ten years ago. It's rich and creamy, not too sweet and not gritty.

This recipe is awesome, bye bye old standard too sweet stuff. This is perfect!!!! Has a bit of a bittersweet chocolate flavor, and boy is it easy to make!!! It was the perfect amount too for a double layer cake. Try it.... you'll like it- guaranteed. P.S. any skeptics about the sour cream, you can hardly even detect it there. This is a keeper for sure :-)

I was looking for a creamy - not too sweat - chocolate frosting and this one was perfect. It is nice and dark, very spreadable. Easy to make.
