Although the recipe seemed quite promising to me, the results were a bit disappointing. It tasted quite bland for my opinion. I'll probably stick to a previous recipe of carrot cake that I found on Epicurious: Carrot cake with marmalade cream cheese frosting (and there is no need for the frosting). You can do it in a bundt pan and it tastes much better for my opinion than this cake.

This took a while to put together. Grating all those carrots ...Aaaagghhh ! However, it was worth every bit of the work. Turned out perfectly & cooking time was just right. After sitting for 15 minutes, it turned out of my Bundt pan in one piece (not always the case for me) & sliced beautifully. I used a can of crushed pineapple in its own juice - all I had in the cupboard - & the cake was still quite sweet enough. I might try pineapple in syrup next time, just to see if it makes a difference. Don't omit the brandied whipped cream. It complements this cake pefectly & lifts it WAY over the top ! I shall add this to my list of 'keepers'.

Delicious. My guests all asked for the recipe It was moist and flavorful. Could not find currants, raisins do just as well. Definitely will make again

Note to "Cook from Greece"...you might try using crushed pineapple in light syrup instead of heavy syrup. Also, there is a working link to the Brandied Whipping Cream. I will be glad to forward to you if like.

Very tasty but,too much sugar. Could be just as good with less sugar added as the carrots give a natural sweetness as well as the pinapple and raisens. Couldn't there have been a link to a recipe for the brandied whipped cream?
