This is the bomb diggity! My girlfriend and I loved the fried garlic and toasted pine nuts. Everything is really well balanced. We have made it twice in the past month.. Super easy and delish!

This salad is great! Used a mix of supergreens and Italian spring mix for the greens, and dried cherries since that's what we had on hand. Was a great dinner and had leftovers to bring to work for lunch the next day. We will be making this again and again, and mixing up the ingredients.

This salad has such a wonderful complexity of flavors! One bite a taste of pine nut, the next crispy garlic, another a hint of goat cheese. Delicious! The only change I made was to 1/2 the amount of goat cheese. Which was fine for me. When I make it again I will matchstick cut the beets (to make them more of the size of the other ingredients) and mix all ingredients together except for the lettuce and goat cheese, then pile the mixture on the greens, toss and top with the goat cheese. If you are only serving two or three people this is a good option to save the beet leftovers and enjoy them throughout the week.

I don't agree with the reader who suggested eliminating the butter and frying. Although skeptical, at first, I think it adds a lot of flavor - well worth the additional calories, which actually are not that many. I eliminated the dill, as I don't care for it in salads - only pickles. Also, I substituted 4-5 green onions - white and green parts - sliced, for the onion flakes. Additionally, because it was too hot to turn on the oven (I like to roast beets, for my salads), I substituted jarred pickled beets, well-drained and blotted. I served it on a large platter, as opposed to a bowl, tossing it at the last moment and believe the presentation was more effective. The compliments were effusive and I am still getting requests for the recipe!

Refreshing change! Love the crispy garlic vinaigrette. Used walnuts instead of pine nuts, it's what I had on hand. I found that I didn't need a lot of the dressing, so for me the amount of butter was okay. Terrific.

Excellent, as others have said. The crispy buttery garlic is a keeper and useful for oh so many other things... like last night tossed with steamed yellow beans.

This salad was fantastic! I was in a rush to get it done for company so I omitted the pine nuts and tomatoes and it was still fabulous! This is my "go-to" salad for the rest of the summer.

Really great, sophisticated salad. Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Will be making this again soon.

Very good! I made it for one, so I eyeballed the ingredients. Added sundried tomatoes along with the cherry. Questioned the dill, but it was good. Adding goat cheese made it a rich, satisfying salad.

This was a refreshing summer entree with good color and flavor. I used a dark green kale mix instead of mesclun, walnuts instead of pine nuts, and skipped the dill and dried onion flakes. Once the beets were cooked, this came together quickly.

this recipe could be soooo much better without all of the unnecessary frying. Butter flavored pan spray with a few sprinkles of butter buds gives the same results with 99% less fat. great ingredients, though
