I made this for Easter and it was fabulous. The only modification I made was that I was short on pistachios (1 1/2 c), so I used more walnuts than pistachios. It does take time and patience, but was well worth the effort. This was just as good as any I've had in a restaurant or bakery.

to the last reviewer re: water typically being left out of recipes . . . what?????? have never come across this ever! this was obviously an omission in the ingredients.

Water is typically left out of recipes, unless there is a temperature consideration such as boiling or iced, because it is assumed that you will be cooking within close proximity to a sink.

I just noticed that he calls for 1 cup of water in the directions, but it is not listed in the ingredients. fyi

You are right. i have been making baklava since i married my greek husband, 30+ years ago. the syrup for a baklava is usually thin so it can be absorbed into the pastry during the cool down period. my family recipe for the baklava syrup calls for 2 C sugar, 1/2 C honey, 1 C water, 1 cinnamon stick, and 1 lemon slice. this is boiled down a little but it is still thin. hope this helps.

My self I am doing all kinds of Baklava, by over viewing the recipe I like the filling mix for the lemon rind and the choped dried apple it seems like an intresting addition.For the sweet souce I would make it thiner by adding more water like 1/2 a cup or more,it will be better absorbed by the filling.It's gonna make an excellent Baklava.
