I was very excited about this recipe, it has all of the ingredients I love on their own. I used a pretty strong gorgonzola and I think it ended up overpowering the dish. The bread needed an oil or some sort of moisture--I thought the watercress may release some water during the broiling but it all ended up kind of dry. I would try this again with a milder cheese. Perhaps a thinly sliced gouda or gruyere.

This is so good!! But you have to like the strong flavor of blue cheeses....or simply substitute a milder cheese to your liking (brie works great). You can also make these on a grill pan and weight them down with a heavy pan or a brick (covered in foil) to make a panini. Pears and cheese are a natural together. Nice bottle of wine and a salad and this sandwich...and you're set.

Not great. I'd try the Grilled Cheddar Cheese and Ham Sandwiches based on present reviews there.
