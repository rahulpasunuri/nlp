A great side dish that is a staple for a quick, easy meal. Tasty and always receives compliments from dinner guests (and family too!).

This is a very good side dish. Simple and flexable enough to adapt to any main dish. Switch herbs around to create different flavors is easy.

These potatoes are wonderful. We think of them as a healthier replacement for french fries. I cut the oil by a tablespoon.

The recipe turned out great and was extremely easy to prepare. I did not have an hour to spare, however, and increased the tempature to 450 degrees. The potatoes were done in about 35 minutes and were nice and crispy.

For variation sprinkle some grated parmessan cheeze on top for the last 5 minutes of cooking.
