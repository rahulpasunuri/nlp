Great use of leftover Bourbon-Cranberry Sauce (Garden & Gun 2012).

This is the perfect pie- I have made it at least five times for Thanksgiving. And, as someone who hates making my own crust, it's nice to just have to worry about the filling. I buy organic, trans-fat free frozen pie crusts and use organic ingredients for great tasting results, everytime.

Update to my previous review: I forgot to mention in my original review that I had cut the cranberry sauce down to 8oz. of homemade whole cranberry sauce and increased the amount of apples by one large apple. We liked this pie very much warm and now that we had a chance to try it cooled it was very good that way too. This pie turned out much better than my husband and I had hopes for. After the pie completely cooled I removed the liquid that pools on the bottom of the pie plate after removing the first slice, I remove the excess liquid with a suction type meat baster, I do this so that the bottom of the pie doesn't become overly soggy.Once the excess liquid is removed I had no more problem with sogginess that the other reviewers complained about. My topping stayed pretty crisp and hard even after being refrigerated.

P.S.{continued from the review below} I forgot to mention I used Granny Smith apples, I think the tartness of these is a plus.

I decided to try this recipe because I needed to liberate some whole homemade cranberry sauce from the deep freeze left from thanksgiving {whole cranberry sauce freezes very well by the way!}.I made this recipe as written except for a few minor changes. I added 1 tbls. of Chambord rasberry liquer to the apple mixture and Like others I reduced the sugar. I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup in the filling only. I left the suggested 1/2c brown sugar in the topping. Yes, this does make a lot of apples but apples cook down by about 1/3 so don't be put off by that, just heap everything in.I also used my own homemade sweet pie crust {Pate Sucree}. The pie is tasty when warm, I haven't tasted it cold yet. It's tart but sweet which I like and the crumb topping is very good. I would make this again if I have leftover cranberry sauce in the future.

I did not cut back on the sugar, but I thought the pie wasn't overly sweet. It was wonderful with vanilla ice cream. My only complaint was that it seemed impossible to re-warm the pie because it was so massive. Delicious, though.

I followed previous posters advice & cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was plenty sweet with that. This is a great throw-together recipe. It literally took me 15 minutes tops to get this in the oven. We all really enjoyed this & I will make it again.

Hands down one of the best and easiest pies ever. Everyon raves over this one. As a matter of fact I make them two at a time when I make them. That way we have one to keep and one to give away.

Consistently good. I prefer my apples sliced and it makes a nice contrast to the roundish cranberries. Excellent with whipped cream and caramel sauce as an extra "wow".

DEFINITELY my favorite dessert recipe to make. i make my own cranberry sauce using the basic recipe on this site. i also halve the amount of sugar in the filling, which results in a perfect sweet-tart pie. i've made this as both a pie and a crumble - both are delicious, especially with local Maine cranberries and apples!

Very easy and simple recipe. Once you get the staple ingredients, you only need to buy apples to make it again.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Have made several times as a crisp, omitting the pie crust, and it is a hit. If using juicy apples I would increase cornstarch a bit. Also, next time will try with homemade cranberry sauce, I think that would make it even better. Tart granny smith apples work best.

I was a bit skeptical about using canned cranberries in a pie, but it really turned out to be delicious! It was to-die-for right out of the oven, but doesn't keep so well - leftovers were a bit soupy (I guess that's a good reason to eat the whole pie right away!)

Tops!! Had to make a pie while we were putting up applesauce, so used a Pillsbury 9-inch deep pie shell, omitted raisins and voila, marvelous. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
Simple, easy and delicious! I highly recommend adding 1/4 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts to the topping - makes it extra yummy. You'd be doing a disservice to reduce the topping, like some have recommended, as that's the best part. I only used 1/2 cup sugar for the filling, which was plenty, and addresses the concern that it could be too sweet. Boyfriend says it's the best crumble he's ever had.

My bottom crust was slightly less than crisp at 350, think next time I'll try starting the pie at 425 and then reducing heat to 350. Very good filling and flavour.

Rating: 3
Tasty and easy. Personally I didn't think it was too sweet. There was a little extra of the topping but I did use 3/4 of it (just patted it down.) I think it really added to the pie so I would recommend using most of it. Will definitely keep and make for the Holidays.

While I can't comment on the proportions in this recipe as written--used less sugar in the apples and scaled it down more or less by half to fit in a round aluminum takeout container--I really enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures in this pie. The cranberry sauce turned out to be a good way of adding a little zing to the less-than-ideal Fuji apples I had on hand. I also used a butter crust in place of the frozen. I'll look forward to trying this again with tart apples, and someday, perhaps, even in a real pie dish.

I have made this pie twice now and have been pleased each time. However, the second time I made my own cranberry sauce which improved the pie quite a bit. Though I would suggest straining out excess syrup if you make your own sauce. I actually prefer the pie with the recommended amount of topping, it is a thick crumb crust, but it is delicious and my guests seemed to like it.

I followed this recipe as written and it was well received at our Thanksgiving dinner. I did not have that much "spill over" during baking, but I did use a deep dish pie plate. Still, using a pan to catch any drippings is a good idea. The amount of topping good be decreased by 25 - 33%, but I did find the amount of topping a problem. The tartness of the granny smiths offset the sweetness of the cranberry sauce and additional sugar. I may use different apples (so prehaps I'll decrease the amount of sugar I add next time) because the apples still remained fairly firm.

Rating: 3
Easy to make and has a wonderful flavor, but definitely too sweet for us. Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/2. I followed the tip below to press the topping onto the pie and it was the perfect amount.

100% of the 44 reviewers before me would make this again, so I hate to be the one dissenter, but this pie just doesn't quite do it for me. Although it's easy to put together, it's not that easy to clean up after, and it makes 4 times as much topping as it needs. It's not presentation-worthy, nor will it travel very well. Sorry, but I'd like to keep looking, because I really did like the blend of apple-cranberry flavor.

Made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Too much filling for one pre-made deep dish shell but package came with two, so I made two pies, baked one and froze one unbaked for later. The only thing I added to the recipe was about a tsp. of fresh lemon juice.

I brought this pie to work, and my coworkers told me it was the best pie they had ever had. So, I made it for my family and they also said it was the best pie they ever had. This is a pleaser, and is delicious. When baking make sure to use a cookie sheet, since the cranberries and apple juices bubble over.

the filling is *so sweet* with all that sugar - i forgot that the canned cranberries have sugar too. and the crumb topping - i must have done something wrong - first it came out too powdery, and the next time i added more butter and it was so dense. but since it's so easy, it's definitely worth trying again with li'l variations

Very good pie. When I tried this recipe for the first time, I ended up with a little too much filling and topping for one deep-dish pie. For the second time, I prepared the filling and the topping according to the recipe, and made two regular pies with them. I also baked them at higher temperature.

Delicious and extremely easy pie to make. A friend tried this recipe out for the first time, and my husband and I loved it, so I made it for Thanksgiving. Everyone raved. Definite keeper. Used the "Easy Pie Crust" recipe from Bon Appetit Nov.2000---a lot of positive comments on the crust. You'll get your "oohs" and "ahhs" from this pie.

A very nice change from straight apple pie... and the crumb topping was easy and tasty. I used a Pillsbury All-Ready crust and a standard 9" pan, and had enough filling and topping left to bake a 6oz ramekin "crisp" for myself.... yum.

Made this for a UIUC tailgate party. It was fabulous. Everyone wanted me to share the recipe. Some tailgaters had more than one serving. (I made two recipes!

Thanks to everyone for your reviews. I like to try something knowing there is a good chance of it actually turning out well. You were right. A great pie!

This is a favourite of ours. Everyone who has it at our house requests the recipe. I've even had to translate it for relatives overseas. I would also definetly recommend foil lining the bottom tray, makes for a much easier clean up. Dicing the apples into small dices makes for a much better filling than slicing, I've done both and noticed a huge texture difference.

I made this yesterday and it was finished completely by my guests. It was a little bit runny. I used Gala apples, maybe there were two juicy. Next time, if I use Gala's I might add a little extra corn starch.

I made this pie for a friend's birthday. I have yet to sample this pie for myself, but the reviews were incredible. "The best apple pie ever" seemed to be the norm.

This was easy to make and tasted great. I followed the instructions exactly. One hint - put the pie plate on a cookie sheet lined with foil for baking. It bubbles over with lots of juices that will ruin your uncovered cookie sheet.

I love this pie! The first time I made it I cut down on the cranberry sauce a little, thinking the whole can would overwhelm the apples, but the flavors blended so nicely that I have no qualms about using the full amount next time. I did have quite a bit of filling leftover, which I baked along side the pie and ate for breakfast.

A definite hit!! A new family tradition. I have to go make another one this afternoon. The only change I made was instead of using canned cranberry sauce I made my own, which is just as easy. I used 1 12 oz. bag of berries, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water,although you could use the full cup of water. I let it cook 5-10 minutes, cool, and then used 1 1/2 cups of the cooked sauce for the pie,which is what is in a can. You could even use a little more, if you use more apples. Terrific!!

Delicious!!! I made this pie to bring to our hosts on Thanksgiving day, then made another one the following day to have at home! Great combination of flavors, and the cranberries were not too tart. I think this would also make a yummy cobbler by forgoing the bottom crust.

What a great and easy pie to make. My husband does not like cranberry so I doubled up on the apples (7 apples) instead and it came out great. Great crust! Last night, I caught my husband eating just the crumbs off the top of this pie! I couldn't blame him, so I had some too.

This is an outstanding recipe and very delicious. I did find, however, that when we cut into this pie it was somewhat runny. I baked it for only 1 hour (recipe calls for 1 hour and 10 minutes), so next time I make it I will bake it the full time. I spooned out the excess liquid and it was still wonderful. Next time I may use a little more corn starch. The flavors are incredible, so I will most definitely make it again. My husband loved it, especially the crumb topping. By the way, I used all of it, patting it down to adhere. The crumb topping is awesome on this pie. Yummy!

An absolutely delicious dessert. I substituted flour for cornstarch with same success. I would suggest using about 4 tablespoons of flour. Also used fresh apples from the backyard apple tree...added a little tartness. I plan to make this over and over...probably for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This pie was excellent! A definite repeat recipe. Of course, I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I did about 60% apples and 40% pears. I would also recommend cutting the topping down by about a third. I put as much as possible on the pie and still had a lot left over.

So yummy, and so easy to make. I cut the butter in the topping by half, and it was fine. Wouldn't think of serving it without vanilla ice cream. I bought up extra cans of cranberry sauce during the holidays so I could make it again.
