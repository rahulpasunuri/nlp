I love barley risotto, and have made several recipes from this site. This was very good, but like a few of the other reviewers, we found it a touch bland. I doubled the recipe and the leftovers the next night were enhanced by reheating with the addition of a touch of red pepper flakes. The entire dish also seemed to come together better after sitting overnight.

Made this one exactly as written -- so those "4-forks" are for THIS recipe... Easy (once I found the pearled barley -- thanks Whole Foods clerk!) and REALLY flavorful. Made it on a cold night in November, so it might have been a little too "spring" for the table -- maybe some mushrooms next time and a little less lemon zest? Rave reviews from my guests, nonetheless -- this is a keeper!

I had to chuckle at the first seven reviews beginning with Stevecoffey. All comments were interesting but not about the recipe at hand. It is hard to critique accurately something when you have molded it in your own image to where it bears only a passing resemblance to what originally was at hand. Anyway, I am going to try this as I love asparagus risotto. Thank you all.

This couldn't have been easier. Following the recipe (by which I mean NOT using chicken stock as others have suggested) results in a fresh, spring-y, taste sensation that brightens up any day. I always think of barley as heavy, wintery, mushroomy, and meaty. Here it shows another side. I guess it is the asparagus & lemon that bring it there. I enjoyed this very much.

I did not want to buy so much asparagus since it's expensive this time of year so I bought half that amount but unfortunately neglected to cut the amount of lemon zest I used so the result was a bit perfume-y. Also, I did not bother with the hazelnuts as I didn't want to make a special trip to the Whole Foods just for them. I'm not sure they would have had them anyway. I am not sure if I would make this again anyway because, while I like chewy things, this was a bit too chewy. It wasn't bad but it didn't bowl me over either.

Very tasty and healthy dish. I had only two cups of asparagus stock after cooking both the chopped pieces and reserved tips. Instead of diluting the stock with 2 cups water, I used 2 cups chicken stock for the 4 cups of liquid necessary to cook the barley.

I didn't think this was worth the effort. We especially didn't care for the raw garlic taste. I think there are better uses for good asparagus.

Very nice risotto. I omitted lemon since didn't have any on hand, and instead of wine used dry cooking sherry. Also, I added some sautéed button mushrooms and used baby asparagus. At the end, I added too much water, so the risotto was very watery, but definitely will make it again.

Excellent recipe. A few changes: I added sauteed baby bellas, omitted lemon rind because I didnt have a lemon on hand, and used cider vinegar in lieu of white wine, again because we didnt have any on hand. The mushrooms were a great addition.

Fearing blandness, I used half asparagus-water and half chicken broth, but the result was incredibly rich! Not bad at all, but next time I think I'll try all asparagus water as written. Totally delicious and easy to make, and a great way to use asparagus and spring onions from the farmer's market.

Wow, what a wonderful spring recipe - I was so sad when I came to the last bite! This is definitely going into our repertoire, so if you are looking at the prep and thinking that it's a lot of work, in my opinion it's completely worth it. Make it on a day when you feel like drinking a glass of wine (or whatever is leftover from the recipe) while cooking and thoroughly revel in joining the 'slow food' movement. Also, I love barley, and since this is the first time I've ever made risotto I feel that I have no incentive to even try arborio.

One night I didn't have enough arborio rice for an asparagus/pistachio risotto, so I made a half recipe and made this as the other half in the same pot. It was delicious!!! Very chewy and crunchy with all the nuts, and a distinctive flavor.

If you are not a vegetarian, this dish is improved in flavor with the use of chicken stock for cooking the asparagus and doubling as the risotto liquid. I also used toasted slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts. This makes a lovely light meal on its own.

I agree with the reviewer that said it is missing something. I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be on the bland side.

I liked how this was a change of pace. However, the multiple steps with the asparagus was tedious. And I'm not convinced that the hazelnuts strike the right note. And the dish needs to have the flavor brightened, either with more aggressive salting, buttering, more wine--something!

If you are diabetic or trying to cut down on carbohydrates barley is a great substitute for other starches because it has a very low glycemic index. It is even lower than most beans.

This was great! But then again, I love ALL the ingredients. Made it as written - halved. IMO, half the recipe easily serves 3- 4 as a side dish.

Followed recipe too a tee, except that I don't have a food processor, so I had to use my blender and add a couple of tablespoons of cooking water to blend asparagus. Delicious and satisfying as a main dish. I loved the green, as it brightened a very cold, winter day.

This recipe is very delicious-- comfort food but with a good taste. The article this recipe appeared in has been a goldmine of great vegetarian recipe for us

This dish was exceptional, both in flavor and in consistency. It was inhaled. Great recipe for vegetarians or as a side dish. Will most certainly do it again.

I didn't have asparragus so I used frozen harricots verts, it's delicious. I also presoaked the barley overnight and it turned out less chewy. I love this recipe, and will try to make it with asparragus next time.

This was a yummy recipe. I couldn't find pearl barley here so I used pearl spelt. And the results were quite good! The hazelnuts really round out the flavors very well, so don't forget to use them. I served this for a lactose intolerant person, so I simply deleted the parmegiano from the recipe. The asparagus and the hazelnuts had plenty of flavor, so the cheese was never missed. This went directly into my recipe collection, and will definitely be part of my spring recipe repertoire. Good enough for a casual dinner with friends.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Easy and spring like.

We thought this recipe was delicious and is definitely a keeper. It was relatively easy and very tasty. Although the asparagus I used were thin, I used a veggie peeler for the lower 2/3 of the spears. I used three cloves of garlic which I added to the pureed spear mixture and did not repuree it. Also, I used toasted almonds instead of the hazelnuts. This delicious dish was served to friends for lunch along with a simple salad of sliced oranges, chopped Kalamata olives, red onion and a drizzle of olive oil.

Excellent and relatively quick.

Made according to recipe. A good deal of prep work but it was an interesting change. My son took most of the left-overs back to college with him. That's a good recommendatioln.

Thanks to others' reviews, I managed to assess and fix a few problems with this recipe before making it. I've made regular rice-based asparagus risotto many times, based on a wonderfully simple recipe by Claudia Roden in "The Good Food of Italy." So here are my fixes: 1. Use 3 bundles of asparagus - 1 1/2 lbs. of trimmed asparagus is equal to that. I suspect that some cooks may have skimped on the quantity of asparagus because this wasn't specified in the recipe 2. Peel the lower 2/3s of the spears before you chop them. This removes all that stringy tasteless outer hull. You don't have to remove 100% of the hull, just roughly peel with a potato peel. 3. Use stock -- veg or diluted low-sodium chicken (whichever you prefer). Water is not a good idea. While you're doing all that tedious prep on the asparagus, you could make a quick veggie stock. Or use your favorite store version (there has to be one that you like). I also used 3 extra cloves of garlic, sauteed with the onion, and I eliminated the added salt (since I used stock). Now it's a tasty dish.

Made this recipe as written using my pressure cooker and it was just boring beyond belief and not worth the effort. Needed more garlic, and if you want to keep the vegetarian aspect, the barley needs to be cooked in beer. I'll make it again, just with enough variations to make it taste like something.

I made this with hulled barley, decreasing the amount. I had orange zest instead of lemon. It was delicious.

Made this recipe as it was written. Found it a nice substitute for rice.....the flavors married well, as it was liked by all. In fact I think I liked the left overs even better, cold, with a drizzle of olive oil over. The hazelnuts stay crunchy, not like other nuts that get soggy. Will be a great summer time BBQ side dish. Makes a good amount.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. My husband and I both thought it was mediocre. Risotto is just MUCH better with rice. As well, hazelnuts have a strong flavor and we found that it overwhelmed the other ingredients. There are many wonderful recipes out there that we will make instead of this one.

Didn't change a thing - Easy and delicious! I was thrilled with the way in which a few simple ingredients came together to form such complex levels of flavors...they all married wonderfully; the creamy barley, the hazelnuts and the asparagus. Highly recommend this delightful dish!
