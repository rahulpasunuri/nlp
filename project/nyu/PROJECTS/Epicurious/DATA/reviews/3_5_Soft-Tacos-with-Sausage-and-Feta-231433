Excellent! Made with sweet sausage, still very tasty and not spicy hot.

Very easy to make - ideal for a weeknight. We use mild Italian sausage, though, and one pound of it in bulk -- two sausages are just enough to feed one person! I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Made this last night and it was extremely good. Will definitely make this again. As per other reviewers i served the tacos with sour cream and chopped tomatoes. I also switched out the Italian sausages with regular ground sausage. I was out of cumin so I used ginger instead (it was in the cabinet lol).

Easy dinner. Really great taste combination. Definitely add sour cream and fresh tomatoes with your toppings. Could easily use queso fresco or goat cheese instead of feta.

We use some of the gourmet brats for this (i.e. chicken with garlic and basil) and followed the suggestion to add chopped tomato and sour cream. What I like about charring the corn tortillas is that they don't fall apart as much (which my husband hates) and they satisfy our cravining for junk food.

made this last night and thought it was delicious. only change i made was to add tomatoes and sour cream as suggested by another reviewer. served w/black bean salad and some avocado. the leftovers were even yummy. i highly recommend this. oh, i used sweet turkey sausage (had in the freezer) and just sprinkled red pepper flakes to make it spicy - less fat and tasted great.

not worth the FAT of sausage. it was just ok. I used Turkey sausage then added crushed hot pepper to spice it up along with some regular sweet sausage. i just wasnt impressed. i do feel the onion and cumin was good but i think lean hamburg would have done the trick and saved a zillion calories. maybe i will try it MY way ...???

Tasty and different. I used habenaro chicken sausage, diced, and then browned. The feta was a pleasant surprise. It contrasted nicely with the spice from the sausage and the salsa.

This dish was wonderful. I used regular goat cheese rather than feta, and also added sour cream. This recipe is a keeper.

Very good with the addition of chopped tomatoes and sour cream.

I made these for a birthday party to serve 12. One guest complained saying there was nothing creamy until I found him some sour cream to dab on. Otherwise, they were eaten faster than I could char the tortillas. I did use some chorizo with the italian sausages, which added extra spice, but also extra orange grease. It's a trade-off.
