First made for my vegetarian daughter this got rave reviews (even from the veggie-phobic). I now make as a vegetarian side dish when needed. I add some thyme, 1/4 C chopped pecans and use 1 egg w/2 cups of vegetarian broth.

First made this a few years ago as a side dressing for turkey for vegetarian friends and I loved it so much it has replaced my mother's sausage based recipe- which I have made for 25 years and always thought was the best I had ever had.

I made just the stuffing, and it was promising. But even after cutting down the butter slightly and substituting some chicken broth for moisture, I still found it too rich. If I make it again, I will cut the butter at least in half, probably more.

I have been making this stuffing since 2003. It always gets rave reviews and if I threaten to try a new stuffing I am always voted down. The kale adds wonderful flavor,texture, color and nutrients to the stuffing. I have shared the recipe with many!

I have been using this recipe for years. It is the only one that my husband likes better than his mothers. NOW that's a compliment!

I made the stuffing only. It was very tasty but a little dry. Easy to fix that minor problem. Worth trying.

I made this with two other stuffings- sausage for the meat eaters, oyster for the fish eaters and this for vegetarian friends at Thanksgving last year. This year- this will be the only offering- it was delicious!!!!!!

A hit every time!! The only thing I change is that I cut the amount of kale in half because I feel there needs to me more stuffing per greens. This is a healthier recipe for stuffing, but no one knows it when it is served!

I used the stuffing recipe only and it was outstanding! A competitor with my mom's sage stuffing and that's really saying something. We are vegetarian, so we used the cornbread dressing to stuff portobella mushrooms and roasted acorn squash at Thanksgiving. I made the Portobella Vegetarian Gravy from Gourmet (recipe on this site) to serve with it and it was perfect.

Through a happy accident I replaced the kale with collards. It worked. It was very green, but had a different and decidedly southern flavour. It was served with the brown sugar cured turkey with the wild mushroom gravy. Alot of flavours, but it was a hit.

I felt this was a healthier alternative to traditional stuffings I have made in the past. My family and guests were very impressed. This recipie is a keeper.

I was really excited about this recipe, but it was bland. I'm not sure how to fix the problem so I probably wouldn't make it again.

This has been the favorite stuffing in my family since we first saw it in the pages of Gourmet. It truly dosn't matter how you fix your bird, this stuffing's a hit.
