3 1/2 forks. Terrific for a Sunday night with family. Per other reviews, I added some red pepper flakes, 2 T tomato paste, lemon zest, 1/2 grated carrot, 2 extra garlic cloves and a little more wine. Lots of flavor for such a quick sauce!

Great. I made this for my kids and I as a weekday dinner, so I omitted the wine. It turned out perfectly and the kids (ages 5 & 3) loved it too.

We love this dish although I have to admit making my own changes. Instead of parsley I use fresh cilantro and I agree with the note about using other fresh herbs over the dried stuff, especially the basil. I also add green peppers.

My Mom is from Northern Italy, and the man who raised me is Sicilian, very different styles of sauces, take something from each. This recipe is what we might call a quick everyday sauce. To amp up the flavor, add more fresh garlic, you can smash it with a knife blade or slice it. Add a carrot shredded to the onions, will take the bitterness of canned tomatoes out. Use fresh herbs if you can, good handful sizes, and don't be afraid to add some cheese to your sauce toward the end of cooking, parmesan and romano. For dried herbs, you can use oregano and basil, and you can add crushed rosemary and winter savory, crush them in your hands as you add them. For more flavor, you can add lots of different things, capers, olives, sauteed mushrooms.

I had everything but the onions, but just added onion powder with all the other dried ingredients. Did 3/4th lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork. Good cupboard meat sauce. And I used petite dice tomatoes which worked well.

nice recipe...Here's a really good pasta sauce recipe I stumbled upon. https://sites.google.com/site/leedsdigitalmarketing/course-pages/cooking-like-a-quasi-real-italian

I agree with those who said it was missing something - wishing I had the email from whoever said they'd send me a better one. I used half pork, doubled spices, then added some dried hot pepper flakes, worcesstershire but it just wasn't great ... Next time I'll try mushrooms and maybe other veggies - or another recipe!

This was a great hearty meat sauce. The wine flavor came through a lot, which I loved. Next time I will chop the tomatoes more finely for a little more consistency. Great dish.

I have tried soooooo many recipes for a decent meat sauce over pasta, and this is the one I keep coming back to over and over. In the winter, I use dried spices and canned petite diced tomatoes. In the summer, I make it with home grown spices and any kind of ripe tomatoes. Ahhhhh! Delicious! The only change I make is adding a small can each of tomato paste and tomato sauce. I dislike runny sauce of any kind, and the addition of the tomato paste and sauce is to kick up the tomato flavor and to make it thicker and less watery. Sometimes I add red wine, sometimes I don't. I always get two thumbs up from my hubby no matter what. I've used this recipe for going on three years now, and it's just the *best* recipe for meat sauce anywhere.

This recipe is such a great "base". I also used tomato paste and 2 cans of "Italian style, stewed" tomatoes. I used heaps of fresh herbs which were really tasty and instead of wine (I don't cook with alcohol) I used a bit of red wine vinegar and some worchester sauce. Turned out SO well and was a hit!

I liked this basic meat sauce recipe. The flavors are much better with fresh herbs instead of dry. I felt it needed more olive oil, but didn't want any more fat, so i added some chopped black olives, which improved the flavor. Tomato paste and bay leaves also helped.

this is really easy and pretty darn good. i also added an italian salad dressing package and some sugar. as an addition to the meat i used italian sausage. yum!

This is a good STARTER recipe that you can tweak to your liking. I use tons more garlic, used tomatoe paste instead of sauce, and use more red wine. I also tweak the herbs...more basil, less the others. I like that this let me know the basic ingredients that should go into the sauce which allows me to tailor the sauce to my family's taste. My husband LOVES when I make this sauce. Easy and tastes much better than jarred sauce.

Makes for a perfectly decent but underwhelming sauce. The sauce was fresh and healthy but not particularly tasty. I didn't have fresh herbs, which I'll grant is a factor. I did add some lemon zest and a teaspoon of sugar, as suggested below.

Excellent! and soooooo easy!

Followed other reviewer's advice and used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Also adding mushrooms (cremini and white cap) makes this sauce more interesting and more tasty. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite meat sauce. I do not use the tomato sauce but substitute tomato paste and add more wine!

try it with a little lemon zest. it does wonders. oh and yeah, i found that the flavors did not come through very well, even though i used all fresh ingredients. still good and would eat and cook it again.

I found the recipe to be simple, easy, and delicous. I added mushrooms,red peppers and green peppers. It was delicous. Not the best I have had but I will serve again!

Decent, but there's definitely better out there (or on here) for the time spent. Bland. Even w/ reviewers suggestions of fresh basil, tomato paste, and extra simmering time. Blah.

This is a great basic recipe for a pasta sauce. I add more fresh basil, oregano, some red pepper flakes and 1 tsp sugar to cut to acid. At times I have added either some sliced black olives or mushrooms. Either way it is fantastic. My favorite addition to the meal though is to add a couple of tablespoons of ricotta cheese, and 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley to the pasta, after cooking and draining, then toss. Place the pasta on the plates, then top with the sauce and parmesan. Wow, it adds such a depth of flavor. This is an excellent basic recipe that has been in my files since it was first published in the magazine.

Very easy to make and so tasty. My husband loved it!!! I added a small can of tomato paste as another user suggested and it did make the suace much thicker.

This was nice and easy. We added some green pepper and mushroom as well.

The only changes I made was substituted ground turkey for beef and homemade garden tomato puree for the tomatoes. I simmered it for 30 minutes and added 1 can of tomato paste for richness. Delish!

Made with fresh herbs, added mushrooms, and let it simmer for well over an hour. Added about a 2 tsp of brown sugar too - definitely needed it maybe because I didn't use plum tomatoes. Next time I'll do it in the crockpot so that it has that rich, meaty taste.

We didn't care for this. It was okay but that's it. We much prefer Pasta with Dino's Marinara Sauce on this site. I use that sauce on spaghetti or other pastas, not necessarily tortellini.

I agree with past reviewees- great staple recipe- I also doubled the spices and added one carrot and one stalk of celery plus i used fresh basil

Big disappointment. Sauce was very bland and the dried spices made it taste like . . . well, dried spices. Also, I prefer a slightly sweeter sauce.

This is a great sauce. I added more parsley, 2 cans of mushrooms and lots of extra garlic and basil. I am always searching for a better meat sauce.....but this one is a keeper! Husband loved it! I served it over linguine and added parmesan...wonderful!

This dish is so easy and so good! A great weeknight meal. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and increased the red wine to about 3/4 of a cup and also added more basil than what it called for. Reduced simmering time to about 20 minutes and tossed it with of rotini. Don't forget to season sauce with salt and pepper. Very yummy!!

Adjustment: 2 cans tomato sauce. Leave in fridge over night to allow rehydration of meat with sauce. VERY good for a cook's basic repertoire.

Was a pretty good recipe. My boyfriend loved it... though i did add salt and twice the amount listed for the herbs. Yummy!

I agree that this recipe is a really good base - you can alter it with many different ingredients, but I usually make it as written.

I thought this dish was easy and pretty tasty, my fiance loved it too. I definitely use more fresh herbs versus dry ones, and try different pastas, but it always turns out good. I've definitely saved this in my recipe box!

Quick, easy and delicious. Got rave reviews from a 13 and an 11 year old (very tough critics!). I did add more spice than the recipe calls for but that is a matter of taste.

I would make this recipe again but with modifications. I had to add salt and pepper to the sauce. Without it, the sauce was too bland. Also, next time I am going to double the spices.

I doubled the garlic and herbs and this was still really bland. We all sat around wondering, "Geez, what does it need?" A little less meat would have been fine too. Won't make it again. Life is too short for lousy pasta sauce! :-)

I have made this sauce twice now and loved it both times. It pleased the meat lovers I served it too. I agree that it's better with fresh herbs and is only 4 servings. Very flavourful, but not overpowering. Good quality cheese is a must.

Rating: 3
I've made this a bunch of times and it's a good basic recipe that you can adapt to suit your own tastes with extra herbs or perhaps even different ones ... maybe some veggies. My latest batch is simmering on the stove right now.I used half the amount of ground beef called for and a dollop of tomato paste. My man loves it!

I thought this recipe was very good-- as did my guests--or so they said! I did add tabasco, brandy instead of red wine (more than a cup), and some fresh rosemary. I did not find that it boiled down too much, but I cooked it on very low heat. Served it with garlic/tarragon bread and a watercress salad. V. Good!

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it, I added a red pepper and mushrooms, as well as some black pepper at the simmering stage. I also went light on the paprika. It was absolutely amazing. The second time, I just followed the recipe. It was good, but not as good as with modifications. I'll definitely make it again, but won't forget the veggies next time.

I find that too many meat sauces are too bland; this sauce has great taste and personality. I make a couple of batches and freeze in serving sizes to reheat for a quick, yet good, dinner.

This dish is very good. My husband kept saying "Boy that smells good." I used the dried ingredients plus added fresh basil and oregano and I omitted the parsley. In a basic dish such as this I think using fresh herbs is key as well as high quality parm. I did forget to mix in the parmesan though. I agree that this recipe does not serve 6; it serves 4. I will make this again.

Rating: 1
First of all this recipe does not serve 6, unless your eating fruit bowl portions. Second, Paprika does not belong in Italian Meat sauces. Third, very bland! If you would like a recipe for an easy meatsauce, with much more flavor, E-mail me and I'll send you one.

I made this recipe for my first dinner party and it was a success! The only change I would make would be not simmer for the 30min, like a previous reviewer mentioned.

Rating: 3
We liked this recipe a lot. I don't generally care for meat sauces, but I liked it, and my husband, who loves meat sauces, thought it was as good or better than any meat sauce he has had. It's a keeper. Another time, I might mix the 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese into the sauce and serve the sauce over pasta, rather than mixing the sauce and cheese into the pasta. I personally prefer the presentation done that way.

Rating: 3
Simply delicious. My best meat sauce so far. This one is a keeper. I added red peppers to onions and used stewed tomatoes with green pepers and celery instead of italian ones. Turned out just great.

Rating: 3
All the ingredients complimented each other nicely. I would, however, add a dash of salt and pepper and reduce the simmering time to 15 to 20 minutes. The mixture dried out too much after 30. Before serving, I would melt grated provolone over the top instead of parmesan.
