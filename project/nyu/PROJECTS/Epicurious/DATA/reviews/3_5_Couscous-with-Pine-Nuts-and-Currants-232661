Don't leave out the toasted sesame seeds and pine nuts! They set this recipe apart from other similar couscous salads. I added goat cheese crumbles and two tablespoons of olive oil. If this recipe serves four people, I'd say that the servings must be huge.

I made this almost exactly as written except I put the red pepper flakes in the water as it boiled (not sure that made a difference as I've only made this once!). I probably used more herbs than called for, too. It was fab!

I was missing several ingredients. I left out the chickpeas, substituted celery for cucumber and mixed raisins for currents. I used fresh mint, parsley and chives. It was deeeelish! This will be a frequent go-to dish.

Can't go wrong with these ingredients, but I'm wondering if it could benefit from some oil? The red pepper flakes are a curious addition--not sure how I feel about them here. Make sure you don't oversalt this at the end.
