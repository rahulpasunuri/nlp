This is an excellent preparation. I've made this a number of times and it always comes out great. The salsa can be used for a number of things, but pairs great with the chops. One thing that helps with any thick cut chops is brining them for a bit. Salt, brown sugar, and a little apple juice concentrate + some thyme sprigs, black pepper, etc. work out well. BBQ it, pan fry and roast, you pick the method. This is a good recipe.

This recipe has become one of my standards. Even though there are just two of us, I always make the full recipe of salsa and use it with chips and other meat. The salsa is also good with swordfish and other mild tasting fish.

I love this salsa. To make it even easier than it already is, I roast the oinins along with the tomatillos. A little extra jalapeno for me and my pepperhead friends and a little more garlic make it a winner. Make extra and freeze it!

The salsa worked well with some grilled tenderloin. Needed the cilantro that I didn't have. Needed an additional jalapeno.

I would eat this salsa on cardboard, so when it is paired with pork it is awesome! I did double the recipe and used 2 serrano and 2 aniheim chilis instead of the jalapenos.

Made this for my night of cooking at the beach last summer. On the page again becuase everyone loved it and requested i make it this summer too (even my uncle who thought it sounded horrible when I explained it). I used pork tenderloin and sliced off peices for each person. Worked well and was less expensive than chops when cooking for a big group. Paired it with a warm herb potato salad with cilantro in the dressing and fresh grilled veggies

I really liked this a lot - I have now adopted it for my standard tomatillo salsa recipe.

I really enjoyed this meal. The tomatillo salsa is very good - make plenty and eat it later with chips. I went ahead and brined the pork chops which added to the meal's flavor.

Have made the tomatillo salsa twice - once with pork chops and once with chicken breast. Thought the flavor was great with just the right amount of spice. Will likely make many more times.

This was just okay. I served it to three hungry men and they devoured the pork chops, but the salsa fairly flavorlelss. I added some chopped cilantro to the remaining portion and it gave it more flavor.
