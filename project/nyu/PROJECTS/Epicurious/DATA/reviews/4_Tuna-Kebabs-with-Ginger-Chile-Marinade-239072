Excellent marinade! Just got a request to make it again (second time in two weeks). Yummy with swordfish. Definitely easiest to use a whole piece of fish. Can also pan-sear and then finish in the oven.

Enjoyed the flavors. Would definitely make again. Added 2 Tbs Sriracha chile sauce in lieu of serrano chile, grilled the tuna instead making kebabs.

Rating: 4
As others have said, grill the tuna separately from the veggies and double the recipe so you have extra sauce. I also added 2 Tbs. of Sriracha (chili-garlic sauce) which lifted it to a whole new level (so to speak ;-). My family LOVED it! Definitely a home-run!

Wouldn't make again. The vegetables shouldn't have been on the same kebabs, they were raw...should have been on separate skewers & cooked longer.

Fabulous recipe that I have now made twice in one week. I do not kebab the tuna or the vegetables. We like our tuna rare and our vegetables charred. Grilled baby bok choy and Quinoa make this a meal. YUM.

Delicious!!! Followed some of the other reviewer's comments and grilled as steaks and added garlic to the marinade. My husband and all 3 of my children (aged 3-7) LOVED it which speaks volumes because 2 of the 3 are picky eaters. Have already made it twice and my kids are begging me to have it again.

Fabulous! I added pineapple to the skewers, which turned out to be a great addition. This will be a "go to" recipe for me.

This was a great meal; enjoyed by our family ages 2 to 62! We had really good quality ahi tuna and I doubled the marinade to guarantee a very saucy skewer. I also served mine with grilled asparagus. I think the veggies were fine though I skewered them separately and allowed them to grill longer. I also minced the ginger instead of grating it (just easier). You will not be disappointed!

One word "yummy".

This recipe was great. Very easy to make and delicious. As suggested below, I cooked the vegetables before assembling with uncooked tuna. Since it was winter, I used a grill pan on a stove top. The vegetables could be charred on the grill pan, but to get them cooked I had to put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Worked out great. Also, the would double the sauce next time.

Nice use of tuna steak! I was looking for something different to make tonight, and itching to grill fish. My husband and I split a large-sized steak and I made enough marinade to have plenty to drizzle over the fish, onion, pepper and rice. It was very good even with my makeshift substitutions-peanut butter and oil for peanut oil, dried cilantro, crushed red pepper for the serrano and powdered ginger. Don't skimp on the onion!

Delicious, easy, fast, my 3 under 7 all loved it, added mushrooms and pineapple, left out the chile (for the kiddos). My favorite way to cook tuna so far!

Rating: 3
This was tasty and I will make it again, but even at 4 minutes, the Ahi was still a bit overcooked. Next time, I will cook the Ahi as steaks and then grill the vegies on skewers. I used jalapeno, and less soy (sodium restriction diet) and was very good.

Rating: 4
This was so good! I skewered the vegetables separately. Actually, I didn't think the grilled onion and peppers went very well with this asian-inspired fish. I also grilled asparagus, and this was a better match. The red on the plate was pretty, but the taste was better suited for beef kebabs.

Rating: 3
I made this with tuna steaks instead of the kebabs. Only substitutions were red pepper flakes for the chile, since I didn't have it on hand and no cilantro, which I also didn't have. The marinade/sauce was very light and a very nice compliment to the tuna. Will definitely use it again.

I used this marinade with halibut, and it was EXCELLENT: my modifications were: 1 jalapeno instead of the serrano, leaving in about a third of the seeds ; a little less honey and twice the cilantro. I also grilled the veggies (red pepper, sweet onion, mushrooms) separately, which worked well.

Rating: 3
VERY good & easy. I added some grilled pineapple and served w/couscous. Not a bite left on the platter.

Like a previous reviewer, I cooked these with the marinade in a pan on top of the stove. We enjoyed them tonight, they had nice flavor with a nice little kick (I added red pepper flakes as I didn't have serrano peppers in the house).

This is a fabulous marinade and sauce. I marinated the tuna steaks whole and then pan grilled them to medium rare. I served this as an appetizer and instead of serving kabobs I thinly sliced the tuna and drizzled the sauce on top over a bed of edamame. Delicious!

This gets 4 forks because we carefully grilled the tuna to a sear, less than 2 minutes. Grill the veggies separately. If you are serving to company, add the grilled veggies to the tuna skewers before searing and serve together on the skewers. I served this with Coriander Rice.

This was superb! Definitely double the sauce. I served it over rice with grilled baby bok choy. Be careful of overcooking the tuna which I did - I grilled for six minutes instead of the four they suggest.

Made this tonight to rave reviews. It is a perfect summer dinner - so light and flavorful. The marinade is especially delicious. I used the seasoned rice vinegar because it was all I had and it was still great. We will be adding this to our summer menus for sure.

Absolutely wonderful dish - bursting with flavor! I doubled the marinade - it goes great over rice and soba noodles! I also took the reviews' advice and skewered the veggies separately so that they could cook longer than the tuna - good idea. I used jalapenos just b/c that's what I had on hand. Husband AND kids loved it!

This is truly amazing -- the marinade is out of this world. I doubled the marinade and that was not even enough. Wouldn't change one thing. Definitely will make this simple dish again.

Rating: 4
Super delicious, a great way to cook those frozen ahi steaks that otherwise might not have too much flavor. Solved the dilemma of the different cooking times by skewering the peppers & onions on their own, starting them first & basting with some of the sauce. That way the fish all cooked perfectly on its own skewers. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
My only suggestion is to partially pre- grill the peppers and onions. Then let them cool and now assemble the kebabs. Otherwise, you may end up with over cooked tuna or under cooked vegetables. Recipe also works perfectly with ahi filets - no kebab.

Rating: 4
Excellent Kebabs - I like a bit more heat and will double or triple the serrano chiles next time or leave some seeds in. Definitely a keeper and easy to prepare.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Other reviews commented on onions not being done and so forth. I solved this by partially pre- grilling the onions and red peppers, allowing them to cool and then making the kabobs. Vegetables are done and the ahi is rare. The sauce is delightful and is a flavorful addition but be certain to bring it to boiling before serving - we did just marinate raw fish in it. Side of sushi grade rice is perfect.

We loved this. Next time will make extra sauce...it's a must to drizzle over after they come off the grill.

I have made this time and time again. I have not always been able to find fresh tuna so I've experimented and made it with swordfish and dolphin (mahi- mahi). I also had a time when the serranos and jalepenos were banned so I used red pepper flakes instead. Just as good and much easier to find.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe to make. I followed this to the letter with the exception of using a jalapeno instead of a serrano chile. I wouldn't change anything. Just check the tuna to make sure it doesn't overcook. For those who are squeamish or don't like rare in the middle, I would cook a minute or two longer.

Excellent! I did not have peanut oil or white pepper and I substituted jalapeno for serrano, but it still turned out great. I served this with mango spring rolls and sesame brocolli and was happy with the results!

I made these for a party of six last night and they were a huge hit! I used 2 pounds of tuna and doubled the sauce and we had more than enough. I made a few with just vegetables and served couscous on the side. Can't think of what I would do differently...perfect as is!

This is so delicious. I only cooked 3 min. altogether. I served it on top of Chinese egg noodles and asparagus that I put some soy sauce and sesame seed oil. I did not add the onion to the kebabs. I can't wait to make this again.

WOW- all the flavors together were wonderful. I also added fresh lime juice that other recommended. Made Haitian coleslaw and coconut basmati rice that were found on this site. Finally, I made pumpkin strudel as a side dish. It was super simple and a wonderful complement to the spicy kebabs and coleslaw. Pumpkin strudel is a Joan Nathan recipe. My guests loved it all!

Excellent recipe - next time I will double or triple the serrano chiles (or leave the seeds in) - it could use more bite! I also made half of the fish and half of the veggies separately - started with the veggies and than the last minute seared the tuna sushi style. On the skewers I mixed fish and veggies, I added an orange bell pepper with the red bell pepper - they photograph wonderfully. This definitely rates a four.

These were super good and easy. Didn't have any metal skewers so put them on bamboo skewers that I soaked in water beforehand. Sooo good, even my 26 year old son raved about them. Had 2 skewers leftover and put one each onto a bed of salad greens the next day for a light lunch.

Wow! This is a most exceptional marinade! Used lime juice instead of rice vinegar and added some minced garlic. Didn't have any skewers on hand and wasn't able to grill outside, so put tuna steaks and vegetables in a shallow pan under the broiler. Served with coconut basmati and Haitian cole slaw (both also on this site). Moved right to the top of my list and definitely will do again soon!

Very good. Making kebabs takes time that I wish I'd spent doing something else, but it does allow this yummy marinade to soak in. I paired it with a grilled eggplant in sesame and asian spice recipe from the site as well. Make sure your onion sections are small so that it cooks through in the brief time the tuna is on the grill.

I thought this was an excellent dish, although in retrospect, I should have put all of the peppers and onions on their own skewers and grill for a few minutes BEFORE putting the tuna on the grill since we also like ours rare.

I thought this was a very good marinade. I did change the way I cooked it. We like our tuna almost rare so I did the onions and peppers on seperate kebabs so that I could cook them longer. I served it with stir fryed baby bok choy. I am looking forward to making this again.
