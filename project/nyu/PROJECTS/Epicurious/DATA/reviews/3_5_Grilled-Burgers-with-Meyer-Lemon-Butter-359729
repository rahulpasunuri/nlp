I took a lot of liberties with the recipes and just used the ingredients as a starting point. I just mixed all of the ingredients in with the meat, instead of making and waiting for the butter to freeze, then putting them in the patty. I much prefer fresh ground beef, but this recipe helps the pre-packaged variety much more palatable! http://www.dishful-thinking.com/lemon-herb-sliders-home-cooking/

Your burgers may not have had enough fat in them, for a direct high-heat source try an 85% meat :-)

Made these burgers on the Fourth of July, and while they were tasty, they seized up into balls on the grill. they were nice flat discs when put upon the grill, but then they quickly became meat balls - we had to cut them in half to put them on the buns...any ideas as to why this happened fellow chefs? thanks

The burgers were good, but the flavor was subtle. I used left over butter on some grilled veggies the next day, which was good too.

We made these last weekend and thought they were great. I was very generous with the herbs in the butter as we like more flavor. Actually, I was very dubious about the whole thing and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't use the arugula but will next time. Would have complemented the flavors well.

I made this exactly as written and found the burgers to be a bit bland. The butter could have used more flavors to give it a bit more of a flavor-kick when mixed with the meat. I wont be making this again.

The only thing I did differently was cut it down proportionately to fit 1/4 lb. burgers. We found this to be light and delicious - light, despite being 85% ground beef and with patties of butter in the middle. Probably no fatter than when a burger is slathered with mayo and cheese - my boys gamely stuck to the arugula and tomatoes. Would make again - just needs a little prep in advance.
