Great - I used Top Sirloin instead of tenderloin for a little more flavor and peppered it, and used a little heavier mix of mushrooms including Crimini, Shitakke, Oyster. Easy to make, great flavor. Fresh herbs are key, and I also added some green onions I had - I found it to be plenty of sauce.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I only made a slight change - I added the sauce to the empty pan to warm it up so I could dislodge the yummy crusty bits into it, then added back the meat and mushrooms. Next time, I think I'll deglaze the pan with a bit of wine before adding the sauce to it.

We loved it. I would absolutely make this for guests, too. Fairly simple and quick to make. Maybe a bit more that the 35 minutes promised, but the estimate wasn't too far off. I'll make this regularly (maybe sub a less expensive cut of meat, though.)

Rating: 4
Great flavors! I found that it could use more sauce though. I am making it again today and i will try increasing the sauce by 50%. I think that it should be just right.

Fresh dill and dijon mustard make the sauce, and I added sherry to the meat: it was excellent! Definitely will make it again!

Rating: 3
I made this and enjoyed it but I didn't bother with the sauce. Just add the sour cream, dill and mustard directly to the pan at the end and mix with the meat and mushrooms. Saves a bit of effort and probably adds a lot of flavour for those who find it too bland. Oh - and add a tablespoon of brandy to the meat just before you add these ingredients for an extra bit of oomph.

ok I feel like a hypocrit reviewing with out making the recipe but this recipe is all wrong, the REAL way to make it is with good Hungarian Paprika which thickens the sauce without a roux and it takes about 15 min. to make.

Thought it was bland. I would prefer it saucier too. Just ok, which was a disappointment. I usually love the recipes from Epicurious and it got a pretty good rating. Maybe I did something wrong. My husband didn't like it either. I made it exactly as called for and it should have been delicious just based on having used a tenderloin.

I made this dish according to the recipe. It was very good. However, traditional Beef Stroganov does not have mushrooms but does have a small amount of tomato puree. Also to "A Cook on 10/26/06", Stroganov is the correct spelling. The dish was named in the late 19th century after Alexander Stroganov.

I found this dish to be delicious! The other reviews had such good ideas. I doubled the broth and added alittle more sour cream for a saucier sauce and the splash of sherry with the mushroom was such a good idea, I think it added a lot. This is a keeper and I will make again.

Yummy & quick. At the suggestion of other Epicurians, I used a couple hearty shakes of paprika. I also added a splash sherry to the mushrooms & shallots, and a splash of heavy cream along with the sour cream (I like my stroganov saucy!). I served over spetzle with greenbeans and received raves from my finance.

the cook in Australia is right. about the paprika. and one other ingredient i will not mention (having been attacked here before by the 'good cooks'). i never made my stroganov with flour to thicken. it takes a little extra time and a little extra cream, but i never did that thing. this really is a very simple dish, like most traditional dishes. there are things you can use to spice it up, if you wish. to do a regional dish or make it your own, as many folks do here. but the simple dish is the best. beef. cream. mushrooms. some unsalted butter. some salt and pepper. maybe a little onion or shallot if you have it. time. yes. paprika. and one other thing for me. maybe one or two for you. c'mon, folks. this is not the best recipe for it, nor the most traditional, nor the most simple. but not bad. not my way. but not bad. not our way.... not your way, maybe... but that is another recipe....right?

We really enjoyed this dinner and it was quick and easy to make on a week night. For next time around I would double the sauce recipe (the roux, broth and sour cream), but I like my stroganov saucey.

I frequently use this site for inspiration and to find recipes that start from scratch and have a gourmet touch. I always find the user comments really helpful, but I always forget to add my own -- so here it goes! I thought this was great. Made it for a weekday dinner (for two of us with plenty of leftovers) and thought it was pretty easy. Used good quality beef tenderloin (totally important as per other reviewers suggestions) but only 500 grams. I didn't omit the dill or mustard. I thought they added a great dynamic flavour to the sauce. I did however add a splash of sherry to the mushrooms (regular button) and used a brown onion instead of shallots. I also like it to be more 'saucy' so I added an extra half cup of beef stock and a bit more flour to the roux and an additional heaping tablespoon of lite sour cream. Served with fresh egg noodles and beans. Excellent!

Rating: 3
WOW, that's a pretty harsh inditement!! I suggest if you want this to taste like it did when you were growing up, go get that recipe. If you knew you liked paprika in your stroganoff, why did you make it without it? Possibly you do need to stick with Hamburger Helper. Don't go ripping people down when you can't make a sauce thicken. Most people want more recipes on this site, not less. If you want to offer CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, by all means do so, however your current statement offers nothing to this recipe or this site.

Rating: 1
DISGUSTING! This was just awful. A waste of my money, effort and my evening. This tates nothing like the stroganoff I had growing up. One of the previous reviewers is correct - where is the paprika? I did end up adding paprika to try and give it SOME flavor but it was still really bad. I should have just used the recipe from the reviewer in the UK. I think the beef broth is what made it so terrible. It was like soup. I did everything to thicken it. I used more sour cream, more flour, wondra flour, and even some beef gravy mix. I would imagine hamburger helper would have been better than this. A Betty Crocker recipe has to be better than this! This gave me the chills and my 3 year old was afraid of it! Find another stroganoff recipe as this is NOT it!

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this dinner, as did my husband. I served it with just a simple green salad (and noodles, of course). The only change I made to the recipe was to add a little white wine to the mushrooms as they were cooking. This variation was successful, but the sauce is bold enough that I don't think it made a lot of difference. Enjoy!

Rating: 1
You need the REAL recipe for Stroganov ?. I am amazed to see such a wonderful and simple dish overcomplicated beyond belief and lacking its major ingredient .. PAPRIKA ! here is the genuine article to serve 4 750 grams Fillet Steak (approx) 3 medium Onions 2 large handfulls chestnut mushrooms 1 level tablespoon Paprika 1 pint sour cream Salt thinly slice onions and mushrooms and sweat in a large cast iron frying pan with a large knob of butter until onion is just beginining to brown. Add Paprika and stir in. Cook for further 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from pan and reserve. Slice fillet steak into "index finger" sized pieces. Make sure your cast iron frying pan is hot, add a little olive oil then your pieces of fillet. Sear on each side (1 min per side max, no more) remove from heat and reserve. Return your mushrooms and onions to the pan and cook on a medium heat for 1 min, adding the sour cream and a pinch of salt to taste, stirring well. Once the cream has warmed through, add the fillet and cook for a further minute (no more than this). Serve immediatly. The steak should be succulent and slightly pink inside. It will melt in your mouth. There is no need to garnish this dish with chopped parsley or other herbs, as the simple strong flavours do not really need it. I like to serve this with matchstick fries .. just cut the potatoes REALLY thin and double fry them to make sure they are crispy. This dish will take 20 minutes from pan to plate and would not be out of place in a quality resturant.

This is delicious! I've made several times now. Its best with tenderloin but still good with London Broil. The sauce is fantastic, even my low fat version using fat free sour cream and margarine. For two people, I half the meat and keep the other portions the same for the perfect meat/mushroom sauce ratio.

This reminds me of a beef stroganoff that my mother got from a cookbook put out by the Memphis Junior League. The difference--and I plan to try this variation, since I've lost the cookbook--is that the mustard was smeared on the beef, which was then allowed to sit for some time before being cooked. The mustardy taste got added to the meat a little, and it made for the best stroganoff I've ever had.

I doubled the sauce as others suggested and found that it drowned the noodles! Perhaps 1.5 times would be better. I will make this again but use the suggested measurements.

I have made this dish several times - often for company but also just for my husband and I (it makes great leftovers) - and everyone I've served it to has loved it. While I don't neccessarily agree, I can see why one reviewer would think that it didn't make enough sauce. The easy solution is to double it (I often adapt a recipe to serve 2 by cutting the meat/fish in half, but keeping everything else the same - that way I end up with lots of sauce for the noodles or rice or whatever the side is).

I wanted to add to my previous review! This continues to be one of my favorite recipes. Last night I made it with sirloin tip, and it was still so good. I continue to use green onions instead of shallots, and it is wonderful with baby portabellas and shitake mushrooms. I do add red wine to my sauce, and double sauce is perfect. This is not a huge recipe though - It really only serves 4 people. Serve with french bread - it is great to soak up the sauce with! If you use any Pampered Chef products, their dill seasoning is really good in this recipe. old review: I have made this twice in the past week, and I really love it! Everyone that I made it for raved about it. I didn't have shallots, so I used green onion. I also substituted just plain ol' mushrooms, because my grocery didn't have the cremini. It was still wonderful.

My family loves this recipe. I splurge on the best meat I can buy and double the sauce recipe because I mix it directly with the noodles and they tend to absorb a lot of the sauce. This is an excellent dish, especially if you love dill.

This is basically Craig Claiborne's Beef Stroganoff recipe from The New York Times Cookbook (with the addition of mushrooms, which I always added anyway, and dill), and much as I have tried different recipes for stroganoff, this is always the one I return to. It's perfect. One observation, though, which is also true of Mr. Claiborne's recipe (which used 1 /12 pounds of beef): this is not enough to serve six people, unless you intend to serve very small helpings.

I have prepared this dish four times and have ALWAYS tripled or quadrupled the sauce!! Have always added red wine to the sauce as well. Also, I've used leftover sirloin, london broil and brisket -- all have been excellent with exception to the brisket which was just okay. Using leftover meat cuts way back on prep time, making it a nice simple dish.

Perhaps my timing was wrong but the sauce came out just "eh" although the flavor was about right. Not too shabby but I feel like more direction could have been given in the sauce-making process.

This dish was excellent but as others have mentioned labor-intensive with quite a bit of prep work and lots of pots, etc. to wash. I made several changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, but the dish turned out great. I used London Broil instead of beef tenderloin, sliced onion instead of shallots, button mushrooms instead of cremini, fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream (I drained the whey so that the consistency of the yogurt was thick), and 1 tablespoon of dill instead of 2. I also cut back on the butter & oil using only 1-1/2 tablespoons of margarine for the roux and no more than a tablespoon of oil to saute the meat, onions and mushrooms. Despite all of these changes, the final result was GREAT. Everyone loved it - a definite repeater at our house.

Still does not compare with my favorite old stroganoff recipe but very good. My family loved it. I will probably do 1 1/2 times the sauce next time and like the previous reviewer, use about 1/2 the dill. I made 3/4" cubes of the tenderloin and sliced the mushrooms - just an old habit that still worked to keep the mushrooms tender, not mushy and the meat medium rare to med. Definitely worth a repeat.

This was an excellent dish. I substituted portobellas for the criminis, added a splash of red wine to the broth/roux mixture, and was a bit more generous with the sour cream (closer to 4 heaping tablespoons.) I was a bit apprehensive about how the sauce would turn out, given that the roux wasn't very thick, but it was fine. Next time though, I'll cut back on the dill; 1/2 - 1 tablespoon is plenty.

simple and good for a weekday meal. omitted dill b/c didn't like it. used half crimini and half shitake, yum yum. i like the the wild rice but next time i would omitt the flavor packet, it was too salty. i'll make it again for my brother's homecoming.

I was a little nervous using canned beef broth in this recipe, but it turned out to be delicious. I used nonfat sour cream (Knudson brand) as well as 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter rather than all butter, and it worked out very well. Rich yet not overwhelming. I'd make this for guests any time.

As I don't each much red meat, I made a variation of this using turkey tenderloins instead, and it was just wonderful. Also doubled the sauce, and added sherry to the mushrooms as others have done during deglazing, which I highly recommend. One other variation was that since I didn't have fresh dill, I used a little dried tarragon instead and garnished with a few thinly sliced green onions. My boyfriend loved it!

This was very good--but I definitely followed the changes suggested by other reviewers. I made double the sauce, added both white and red wine, used low-fat creme-fraiche, and served the stroganoff over rice. My boyfriend loved it, but we still had plenty of leftovers because it was very filling. Incidentally, I made it with carrots instead of mushrooms, and they absorbed the wine gravy very well.

I found this recipe to be lacking. The meat was tender, as would any recipe calling for tenderloin, but the flavor was not exceptional. I used portabellas and added white wine to the mushroom saute stage. My boyfriend liked it and would eat it again, but I won't be making it for him. I didn't hate it, but didn't find it worthy of more than two forks.

This has become a favorite of mine. The meat came out tough but that was MY fault, not the recipes. The sauce was excellent. From reading the recipe, I thought it would be too much dill for my likings but I didn't think so at all. I may try it without the meat next time and substitute portabellos. Also, I hate to see the review section misused. This isn't a place to post your recipes or for personal attacks - try BHG.com for that. What I appreciate most about Epicurious is the serious responses from serious cooks.

Great recipe. This is the classic version of Beef Stroganov, but why does everyone advocate using it over pasta? Whenever I made this, I most often preferred making some basmati rice (long-grained Indian rice) or any fragrant rice, and topping the rice with the stroganov. It really is quite a delight. The only way I would think of improving this is to make it more wine-based, as it really brings out the flavor. A French friend of mine who is an expert in Chinese cuisine once added aji-no-moto (MSG) to it while it was cooking, and the end result was markedly different. There are so many variations possible. My advice : use it over rice, its really good that way. My Mom once made it with whole peppercorns, but thats just because our family used to throw those into almost every sauce-based dish we made!

Excellent. I did read the reviews and changed the recipe with reviewer's suggestions: splash of sherry in with the mushrooms/shallots saute, low fat sour cream (cannot tell the difference). Super fast and delicious, made in under a half hour. I used dried dill and regular button mushrooms (lots). Only added suggestion would be to cut down on the amount of dijon.

Would have preferred more sauce, as previous reviewers have stated. Easy to make, and rich & comforting. Thanks to those who suggested adding a bit of wine to deglaze/add flavour -- it really enhanced the dish. P.S. - it does NOT feed six people!

Quite good! Like everyone else said already, use good quality meat and don't omit the dill. I used "light" everything and it still came out great. It really satisfied my craving for a creamy pasta without being too fattening. Great weeknight recipe!

This is the best beef stroganov recipe I've ever tried--and it's so easy! It is good enough for company but quick enough for weeknights. The dijon mustard adds just the right flavor kick.

Rating: 3
Delicious recipe, far better than other versions I've had. This one reduces the cloying sour cream and adds the mustard for a welcome zing. I agree with an earlier reviewer: you must use the best meat. I used a pair of fillets mignon and sliced them in 1/4" slices.

Excellent recipe. My husband didn't think he'd like Beef Stroganov but I've made a believer out of him yet. I did use all of the ingredients called for but added a bit of white cooking wine with the mushrooms. However, I did NOT following the cooking directions - it seemed a bit odd for the way I cook. I was wary it wouldn't turn out well but it certainly did! I did make more sauce b/c it seemed a bit dry at first. The mustard MADE the dish for us! We will definitely make this again and again.

Delicious! It was a great recipe for a casual weekday dinner. Double the batch for leftovers. It reheats very well.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I made more sauce than recommended and it turned out great. The tenderloin is a must, don't scrimp on that.

This is a wonderful recipe!!! I had never made Beef Stroganov before but this recipe is quite easy to make. I couldn't find cremini so I used Portobellos instead, and it still came out delicious. Everyone kept raving about how good it was all night long. I am sure I'll find myself making this over and over again.

Beef stroganov is definitly a comfort food for me, I loved it as a kid. This is definitly a step up from that stuff mom made with cream of mushroom soup and round steak! It is awesome! Definitly a keeper.

My family loved this dish! Even my picky 7 yr. old who won't eat anything! He said, "Mommy, you have GOT to make this more often!" Right there, it's a keeper. I had the butcher cut up a tenderloin for me into steaks (on sale, of course) and he sliced up the tail end for the Stroganov for me. This was a delicious dish, and I even used low-fat sour cream, and it was still delicious and undetectable. Try this, it really is good!

This is definitely a keeper. My husband ate two huge helpings and we have enough for 2 more lunches! I doubled the amount of sauce (added even more broth) since I probably had over a 1lb of beef to work with. Delicious!

Loved this recipe! Made it for 6 guys watching Monday night football and it was a big hit. Everyone went back for seconds. Doubled the meat and quadrupled the sauce. Had plenty sauce but could've used a little more meat for six guys. Used domestic mushrooms, white onion, one tablespoon of dried dill, and light sour cream. Perfect taste but next time will use less butter at the end and. Don't substitute the tenderloin, it was the perfect cut of meat.

Rating: 4
I loved this, and so did my husband!! (My little kids ate the pasta and the meat, minus the sauce and the mushrooms, and were also very happy with the dish.) I would omit the salt from the sauce next time - it seemed a little salty. The tenderloin made the dish (don't substitute). We'll definitely have this again - it's the best Stroganov recipe I've found!!

Rating: 3
This dish was excellent and enjoyed by grownups and kids. (I caved to the kids' clamoring and prepared their portions separately with no mushrooms.) I got cold feet at the butcher's and bought sliced sirloin rather than tenderlon which cost twice as much; it was tasty but I think tenderloin would have a more melting texture. My only dissatisfaction with the dish was its appearance; the sauce was a turn-off shade of gray/brown.

Rating: 3
We found this to be very tasty--especially with the reviewers' suggestion of adding a splash of red wine to the mushroom saute step. Using tenderloin absolutely made the dish. And the leftovers were great, too. Only change we'd make is to reduce the quantity of mushrooms to no more than 1/2 pound.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe. I like the idea of doubling it for leftovers! I also used light sour cream and less butter for a healthier version.

I agree with the previous reviewer, I would double the sauce to have enough for leftovers. This recipe stands on its own, no changes necessary, simple to prepare and delicious!

My wife thought that she didnt like stroganov. Well she loved this one! 3 tablespoons of sour cream was more than enough. Next time I will double the recepie, because there werent enough leftovers.

Rating: 3
This is an almost great recipe. I made what I consider to be a more proper roux for the sauce with equal amounts of oil and flour. I also increased the final amount of sour cream to 1 cup. I don't see how 3 tablespoons could be sufficient for serving 6 people. Overall, a wonderful stroganov.

Rating: 3
I have made this twice in the last week, the first time pretty much according to the recipe and the second substituting chicken and chicken broth for the beef. (I think I'll call that Poulet Russe.) I doubled the sauce ingredients because the sauce is so good and there wasn't enough of it the first time. I think a little cognac might be good in the sauce as well. I used dried dill instead of fresh - (1/3 part dried to 1 part fresh)and low fat sour cream. It was really good and so easy!

Rating: 3
I used 1 lb. of rump roast and only 1 tsp. dried dill in the sauce. It turned out great! Next time, I think I'd use more shallots, mushrooms and some red wine like previous comments suggested.

I made this for guests and we all enjoyed it, but it was far better the next day! I also added some red wine, great addition to a good sauce.

So good! As other reviewers suggested, I added a splash of wine (to the onion/mushroom mixture), decreased to 1 tablespoon the dill, and increased to 4 tablespoons the sour cream. I also added an extra teaspoon of flour to the roux to thicken the sauce a bit. This a wonderfully hearty, earthy and rich-tasting dish.

Very good recipe. I used about 1/2 tsp of dried dill, and a tablespoon more of sour cream. This one goes in the file!

I unfortunately thought this was very bland. It really needs a bit of wine added, like most stroganoff recipes I've made in the past. My husband specifically asked that we not do "new recipe night" again for a while because of this recipe. :(

We loved this! I subbed vegetable broth for beef since that's what I had, cut the amount of butter in half, used light sour cream, and whole wheat egg noodles. It turned out fabulous. My husband would eat this once a week!!

Instead of dill and Dijon, try small diced or chopped (not pureed) kosher dill pickles. You want to see the chunks of pickle. When you chop, keep in liquid. Use same amount of pickles as sour cream. You may also substitute shallots and cremini, for red onion and button. Just a cook's thoughts and personal tastes. Enjoy!

I have only recently been looking for a good/easy stroganov recipe; and what to my wondering eyes should appear. . . Trader Joe's is selling a bag of about two dozen frozen soy balls which I have the pleasure to wholeheartedly endorse. I make my own marinara sauce and defrost these little babies during the last few minutes of cooking so that the flavors can meld; all with great results, and no one knows that I'm not serving meat. I can't wait to try this recipe - with sherry- and use Trader Joe's soy balls for a "meatball" stroganov.

I too added wine. I think wine or sherry is needed. Other than that, I thought the recipe was quite tasty, better than the other recipe on this site, which I tried last week.

This was a truly savory dish which goes into my favorites file. I used regular button mushrooms though as the cremini are often hard to find. Also, I added a scant amount of dry sherry for experimemtation. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was very good, although I would have prefered it to be thicker and maybe skip the mustard. I found the mustard to be too strong of a taste.

We used the tail end of the tenderloin which was delicious. The dill was a little overwhelming - I will definitely cut back next time I make this. I would also add a splash of sherry or white wine next time.

Made this last night and my house still smells great this morning! I followed advice from others and cut dill to one tablespoon and increased sour cream slightly. Used two tenderloin filets (total a little over 1 pound) and used regular button mushrooms. Yes, the sauce is thinner than what you might be used to, but we found it enjoyable and a little on the lighter side. Some comments about it being bland I think depend on what you expect from beef stroganov--though we did not feel it was bland at all--generally, beef stronganov is kind of a "quiet" comfort food dish. The dill and mustard add just enought zing to make it interesting but not overwhelming. I would be interested in hearing back from the reader who wanted to try this with ground beef.

Rating: 3
I agree that the sauce was a little thin, but the dish is very tasty overall. Maybe adding more flour to the roux would help. I used sirloin instead of tenderloin and it was fine. There's a lot of sauce--be sure to have some kind of starch on hand to soak it up!

I omitted the dill and mustard and used McCormick's Season All instead. It added a pleasant color and lots of flavor to the sour cream sauce. All that is needed is a green salad and you have a festive meal.

I didn't make it. After reading the recipe and the reviews I decided to stick with the recipe that came in Gourmet Cookbook II. I have been making it for about 42 years. It has great flavor that comes from the missing ingredient, onions cut thinly into rings and sauteed

One of the things I love most about Epicurious.com is reading reviews from cooks who have made its recipes. I made this beef stroganov for that reason. I hate to be a naysayer, but I thought this version was bland, with a thin tasteless sauce. The tenderloin (which set me back $17.00) was tender and flavorful, but it wasn't because of the recipe. I followed other recommendations and increased the sour cream amount, while using less dill. Also, there is no way this recipe would feed six adult people. Umpressive, to say the least.

In a word - delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted regular old button mushrooms for the crimini. I just realized I'm a dill fan! Great Sunday dinner.

It was easy to make and exceeded my expectations. I didn't have any dill on hand but the dish did not miss it a bit. I used about 1 1/2 lbs of tenderloin. The recommended mushroom is "must" as it gives the recipe much more flavor.

Really yummy stroganoff. I used flank steak, quark (low-fat sour cream substitute) and added onions. Great as leftovers!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I left out the mushrooms (I live with a mushroom hater) and put more meat in it. Since tenderloin is so expensive, I substituted flank steak cut against the grain. It worked just fine.

My family loved this. I made this in under a half hour on a week night! I think I might add more mustard next time and I took another reviewers suggestion and added some leftover white wine I had in the fridge. We had no leftovers!

Made this dish last nite (with a few revisions)for my husband and myself and thought it was very good. We used thick, boneless pork chops, in bitesized pieces, sweet-hot mustard (for a lack of dijon), 1 tsp of dried dill, and regular white mushrooms. I can only think the ingredients called for would make it even better.

Just answering the question of omitting the mushrooms - there really isn't a suitable substitute that comes to my mind but my mom's stroganoff recipe does not use mushrooms and is quite delicious. My own recipe does and I enjoy it more but then, I am a mushroom-lover. Based upon the amounts in the recipe, I would also do as other cooks have suggested and increase the amount of sour cream and reduce the dill. You can also use dried mustard (cutting down the amount) instead of prepared and yellow onion instead of the shallot (increasing the amount). Try your own variations and you are sure to come up with a great meal!

I too have improvised making stroganov over the years often using a creamed soup for sauce, this is so much better! I added a little wine to the sauce at the end. Years ago (30) I used a package to make strogonov. Eric Sauces of the World, it was fabulous, but long ago disappeared. I also made it with hamburger, my family loved it.

To the Cook on the question of hamburger, my Mom was the best Cook, and every once in awhile she would serve what we called SOS ("Same Old Stuff"), she just browned the hamburger, added it to a white sauce, some spices, and served it over toast. It was very good, and adding the dill etc of this recipe to hamburger would be the the same SOS. No its not the classic dish, but served with love, it is probably the best meal you will have anywhere in the USA.

This was delicous, and extremely easy to make. I often purchase whole beef terderloins and cut into filet steaks, and this recipe does make good use of the tail end. This is one of those recipes that tastes like it took hours to make, but is quick enough for any weeknight.

I made this with left-over rump roast and it was delicious. It is hard to find things to do with leftovers that aren't boring.
