This shortcake recipe is flawless. I was looking to use up some sour cream and so the recipe was perfect. I made half the batch with orange zest, and I used vanilla extract and lavender buds in the other batch. This can be served with a variety of toppings, including a berry compote made by cooking the berries with a little bit of cornstarch. Delicious!

Excellent biscuits! I also divided the recipe into 3s(1/3 cup of sugar becomes 1.75 tbsp or so) and made 4 biscuits. We used blueberries, strawberries, a fresh peach, and very little sugar on the fruit. No orange zest, but plain was just fine. Could not have been easier to throw together. Definetly one for the box.

I liked this and so did the husband. I substituted strawberries for the blackberries and left them out of the puree to be dotted around the plate. The flavour of the biscuits was lovely. Very subttle and not too sweet. I cut this recipe in thirds and it still worked out beautifully. I'll make this again.

Very good. Nice moist biscuits. I used strawberries (sliced and lightly sugared), raspberries (lightly sugared), and blueberries. I didn't find the dessert very sweet, but my guests said it was perfect. I made the biscuits about 4 hours ahead and they were just fine (didn't bother putting them in an airtight container). I sliced and froze the leftover biscuits for a future occasion.

I made this on Sunday with strawberries and it was very good. My husband and two friends loved it and asked that I make it again on Wednesday, July 4th. However, I will omit the orange zest at their request. I liked the zest, as regular shortcake is rather blah. These do not keep well because they lose their lightness and get spongy (perhaps it was the humidy of a hot summer day. Re-heating does help to revive them somewhat.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared. I absolutely love it - and request it as my birthday dessert instead of a more traditional cake. The shortcake recipe is fast and easy. It is good with the mixed berries, but I usually just use strawberries tossed with a bit of sugar, orange zest and orange liquor.

At last, a perfect shortcake! Not boring, not dry. This is the only shortcake I've ever made which is as delicious on its own as the finished concoction. The sour cream in this recipe makes for very tender and moist crumb, yet the cakes hold up well under the berries. The unexpected addition of orange zest adds a new dimension to the good, but often predictable, berries with shortcake. Caution: this recipe makes twelve LARGE shortcakes. Try to resist having one for breakfast the next day!
