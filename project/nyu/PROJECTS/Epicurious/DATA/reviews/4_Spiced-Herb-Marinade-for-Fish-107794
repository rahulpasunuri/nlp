I love this recipe. It is so tasty and relatively easy to make. It is unfortunate that some people have given it poor reviews when they did not have all the necessary ingredients to make it. I usually make it with salmon but I have tried it with other fish and it is delicious. Give it a try. You won't regret it. Enjoy!

Just love this recipe! I have used it repeatedly with various fish, including salmon, tilapia, char and halibut. It is quick, easy and very tasty. It is now in my personal recipe box.

My Moroccan Jewish husband LOVES this fish. He told me to rate it with 4 forks and to make fish this way all the time. It was a little spicy for my American taste, but it tasted authentic (i.e. like something his mom would make). Prep was quick and easy, I had all the ingredients on hand without preplanning and my honey loved it, so 4 forks it is!

I made this a few yrs ago, and came across it today. I think I need to make it again, nice way to use some of herbs available at the store this time of yr.

Fabulous! I made it as written, except that my cumin wasn't freshly ground and the red pepper may not have been very fragrant. I used steelhead trout, and the only complaint I got was that the delicious marinade overpowered the flavor of the fish, which was probably true, but I didn't mind. I've been trying to figure out how anyone could say the recipe was bland and have concluded that those reviewers must have discarded the marinade, rather than eating the fish with the spices on top. It's like eating beef with chimichurri -- don't discard the "marinade"!

This was really disappointing. The only thing I changed was the use of dried cumin instead of fresh. With all the 4 star reviews I was expecting something exceptional. The salmon turned out very bland and boring. Don't know what happened but I doubt I'll make this again.

Excellent recipe. I used it with Orange Roughy. Everyone raved. However, I left out the pepper flakes b/c I didn't want any heat to it. Added a bit of chili powder instead. Yummy.

Just OK. Dont understand what the fuss is about. Would not make again. It is simple though. That part I liked. But, a better, equally simple dish is the salmon with roasted asparagus and lemon caper sauce from this website. It was excellent!

I also quartered the recipe for just me and my fiance and wish I would've at least done a third for extra marinade to baste. I also just threw everything in the food processor and then heated the mixture before pouring over fish. Not sure exactly what the heat does. Very tasty and I'd go heavy on the herbs next time. Lovely and easy!

Rating: 4
Great fresh herb taste. Used 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes, which was spicy enough to allow the taste of the herbs to shine, while still giving it a little 'edge' of spiciness. Buzzed together all ingredients in food processor and did NOT heat on stove as the recipe directs. Spread over fish (and some chicken breasts also) and let it sit for an hour or so, then baked in oven. Everyone LOVED it!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes, even using inexpensive fish like tilapia. I sometimes adapt the recipe to make as a pesto sauce for pasta. When I do that, I cut the garlic, spices, and oil by half. I rarely give 4 stars, but this is an exceptional recipe.

I made this tonight on a large salmon fillet. I didn't have have any "fragrant dried red pepper" so this was ommitted, otherwise I used all the ingredients as listed in the recipe. I chopped the cilantro, parsley and garlic cloves together in the food processor and then transferred it to a saucepan. It looks similar to a pesto, but smells very unique and exotic. When I tasted the marinade alone, I was uncertain about it. I let it marinate on the salmon at room temp for one hour then baked it for exactly 20 minutes in the oven. It was perfect. AMAZING. Everyone, even my pickiest eaters who only like salt and pepper on fish LOVED it. I will definitely make this again and was very happy to share the recipe with all my guests. A very easy recipe for a very flavorful meal!

I liked this. It took longer than I thought to do the prep work for making the fish. A lot of chopping. It's worth it though - a nice pairing with salmon. Used the leftover fresh parsley for some mashed potatoes which was a nice addition.

This recipe was delicious! So easy to make! I used sweet hot paprika instead of dried red pepper and added a few pinches of sumac and it turned out amazing. Next time might reduce the cumin - but just a little. My husband and I both couldn't stop talking about it! Will make again for sure!

Made this with salmon filets for dinner this evening. Turned out really well. An interesting mix of flavors that really spiced up what can typically be a rather boring meal. This is a keeper.

Made this marinade with tilapia filets and they came out wonderful. I didn't have parsley or paprika so I went without. Also, I added about 4 chopped green onions and some white wine to the mix. Plan to make it again next week.

Made this when looking for a recipe that contained both salmon and cilantro (had a bunch to use up...) and it was great! My husband said this recipe is a "keeper". We didn't have any parsley so just used more cilantro, and it was very tasty. Since I was just cooking for the two of us, I made a quarter-recipe of the marinade and it was just about the right amount for a .5-pound salmon filet.

This recipe is excellent and truly authentic. I recently dined at an African restaurant and surfed to find the blend of spices used in my dish. This was even better. Five+ forks!!!

This really made our orange roughy stand out last night. Easy, fast and very delicious - it displaced harissa fish as my go to fish recipe. Following some reviewers, I made two modifications - I added a dash of dry white wine to the marinade before sauteeing, and I baked the fish on top of a handful of lemon slices.

Rating: 4
This sauce is so delicious! I like to use cumin and coriander seeds, but I don't think I've ever used paprika as it's not something I keep in my kitchen. I also like to slice up a whole lemon and saute that with the sauce instead of just lemon juice.

made this with salmon fillets on the grill and it was wonderful, bold and fragrant. Not wanting to let the leftover marinade go to waste I returned it to the pan, added some half & half and flour to make an excellent cream sauce that went over the fish. Can't wait for leftovers!!

I used this to marinate prawns which my husband grilled for Father's Day. I made the marinade with 6 cloves of garlic, a little less than 1 Tbsp of dried red pepper and no cilantro as I was serving it to a lot of children and finicky adults. Everyone loved it. It reminded me of Tandoori prawns, so I bet this would be great with chicken as well.

made in food processor, warmed slightly and slathered on thick and large ahi and sea bass steaks. baked 20 min. outstanding! trying a 48 hour marinade on whole chickens to rotiseree tonight. i think this would be good on tomatoes with fresh mozzerella too...or just about anything for that matter

This marinade smells and tastes delicious! My boyfriend and I both work late and like to have a quick, but good, meal when we get home. I prepared the marinade before work and let it sit on the salmon for about an hour at room temperature, then refrigerated it for about 8 hours. I brought it (nearly) to room temperature before baking, and it was wonderful! After preparing that marinade I coldn't WAIT to get home to eat it!! My boyfriend even liked it and salmon isn't really his thing.

Very nice, although subtle is not a word I'd use to describe this dish! Had leftovers which I mixed (both fish and marinade) with some rice. Now I'm thinking that some black beans thrown in would give you an "Islands" jambalaya. Hmmn, maybe the leftovers deserve 4 stars.

This recipe couldn't be easier, especially if you use the herb mixture fresh. No need to cook it before spreading on the fish, particularly if you have a few hours for the fish to marinate. Used it on two large (fish-size) filets of salmon and cooked for 20 minutes. It turned out perfectly. Guests loved it.

Truly a wonderful marinade. I added some white wine as other reviewers suggested. I was out of cilantro and lemons (unbelievable!) so I skipped the cilantro and replaced the lemon juice with fresh squeezed orange juice. It still turned out wonderfully. A marinade that is very likely hard to mess up.

I was so surprised when this came out of the oven and tasted great. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I had to use dry ones. I looked up how much to substitute and followed the general guidelines to get the amounts. I heated the spices in a saucepan first, like the recipe says, and added a little vegetable broth to the oil, lemon juice, and spices because it seemed too dry (perhaps because of my dry spices). I also replaced about half of the cilantro with basil because my husband doesn't like cilantro. The sauce I ended up with was very thick with spices so I added about a quarter cup more of vegetable broth. I figured I had ruined the recipe, but when I sat down and tried it, it tasted great! My husband even said he wouldn't mind if I make this dish often. It almost tasted like there was tomato in it, but there wasn't. The salmon was moist and went well with the flavor of the sauce.

I served this for a large dinner party buffet style, and it was a huge hit. I used Mahi Mahi fillets in a large flat casserole dish and layered the fillets over thin slices of lemon, and I added a touch more lemmon juice to the bottom of the dish. I just slipped it into the oven with my veggies. I love recipes I can make ahead.

Wonderful mix of both herbs and spices! We tried this last night and I couldn't wait to rate it. It is easy enough for a simple weekday meal but flavourful and exotic enough to serve to guests. I thought I had chopped up too much herbs but was surprised that it all fit into a cup. I served this with lemon parsley couscous and steamed carrots. Oh, the only thing different about my version was that I could only find the curly leaf parsley instead of the flat leaf and I also reduced the red peppers to about 3/4 of a tablespoon. It still tastes great! I would definitely recommend that anyone try it for themselves! Cheers and have a great day! :)

Very tasty and easy too! I used halibut fillets and reduced the pepper flakes by half and the olive oil to 1/3 cup.

I'm making this for the second time tonight for friends. I use tilapia and it is fantastic. I like the idea of using the food processor because chopping the herbs were the only thing that took any time.

We've made this with salmon and halibut, and both were great. To simplify a bit, I just ground up all the marinade ingredients in the food processor and then left the fish to marinate cold for a few extra hours, instead of cooking the spices. This is an excellent recipe for lower quality or previously frozen fish.

This recipe was GREAT! My husband and I ate the entire dish! Too spicy for my children. I used red snapper fillets insteat of the salmon. I'll bet it would be delicious with halibut as well. This will be a keeper in my household. I can't wait to try it again! Also, I only used 1/2 T of the crushed red pepper and had plenty of spice.

Rating: 4
We loved this! I made a bunch of adjustments, but I don't think it really changed the final outcome. I had tilapia fillets on hand, so I used those. If you can believe it, I was out of garlic! I used 4 pearl onions and 1 shallot, chopped together in place of the garlic. Because my little guys were going to eat this, I used only 1 teaspoon of dried red pepper (would definitely use more next time), and used the lemon juice, not white wine vinegar. Served this with the indian potatoes recipe from this site and a spinach salad. Very good, healthy meal.

This was absolutely wonderful! Not a big fan of cilantro, so just used parsley and a little bit of fresh tarragon. I took the advice of others and used 1 tsp of red pepper which seemed to be just right. I served it over cod with roasted sliced yams and zucchinis. It made for a beautifu color display. My husband adored this dish. Can't wait to make it again!

I used this on trout, and it turned out great; fragrant, slightly tart from the lemon, and different, but subtle enough where you can still taste the fish. I threw in some green onions since I didn't have any parsley on hand. Next time I'll take the advice of the other reviewers and cut down on the crushed red peppers-- it was a little too spicy/hot.

Very nice. I like how different this is from other fish recipes. I served it over catfish (it was on sale) and would do that again or try some other fish. You can definitely play with how much of each thing you put in, just make it to your own taste. Easy, different, and tasty.

Excellent! Will make again. Very flavorful. My husband went back for seconds, always a good sign. I don't own a motal and patel, so I used my mini cuisinart to grind the garlic and salt. Definetly add to my list of new recipes, it does have a good kick!
