My 13-year-old made this herself -- easy & delicious! Turns out right every time.

My pasta was rather chewy, but I have no idea if it's because I over/undercooked it, or if it's the recipe. It really wasn't a bad thing, just interesting. There will definitely be a learning curve with this whole pasta thing. In any case, it tasted great. As I was working with it, I noticed that it smelled like placenta, and I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to eat it (I'm a labor and delivery nurse). I suppose that it was the eggs. Kind of makes sense for eggs to smell like placenta, right? I'll have to do some more experimenting to see how this recipe compares to others.

I've been using this recipe since buying a pasta machine. I have substituted half whole-wheat pastry flour with great success. However, if you've never made pasta dough with a foodprocessor before, and never rolled out pasta dough with a machine, you may need a visual guide- I added too much water with my first batch and made a mess with the folding-rolling process http://thesecondpancake.typepad.com/the_second_pancake/2008/08/fresh-pasta.html Offered a really helpful pictorial guide (originally linked through Saveur). You may also want to find a video of rolling out pasta dough, either on this site or on youtube, before attempting it yourself.

After a few frustrating, messy attempts at making pasta over the years, this is the first time everything went well. The instructions were right on, and I was happy with the end product.

This dough was awful. The dough is not easy to work with at all. I got a pasta maker for Christmas and it has a recipe of 2 C flour and 2 eggs. Just make a well with the flour and add eggs, beat the eggs and incorporate the flour. Then start kneading. It will be dry, add small amounts (1/2t) of lukewarm water and continue kneading. Let the dough rest about 10 minutes. Break into four pieces and continue. This dough is much easier to work with. It tasted great.

I have tried a dozen different combos for processor dough and this one works. I have also used immediately and saved for one day and both are fine. In addition when I did not need the whole batch I have rolled and cut, sprinkled with flour to dry for a few hours and placed in a plastic bag in the fridge.

I pre made it then froze it in little batches. Good friday family dinner was a hit. Very impressive, and easy too. Definately a keeper

This is all I have to do to make pasta? I did it easily by hand. It's not exciting, but it's pasta.

My family loves this pasta dough recipe. I have made it several times, and I have yet to hear any complains from my family. It is easy to roll out with the pasta machine once the dough has been processed in the food processor. The noodles are not too soft or hard once it is cooked. I usually served it with a marinara sauce.
