After reading the list of ingredients I thought this would be divine, but instead I found it to be mediocre. Something is definitely missing. I added some cumin and that was a bit helpful. I also added some rice wine vinegar which added a bit of depth.

This is delicious! A great base recipe for doing other things with. I actually boiled the squash and then put it in the blender and pureed it. I also added red pepper flakes and about 1/4 cup of sea salt. I only used one can of beef broth and no water. I topped the soup with low-fat sour cream and some mozzerella to kick up the flavors. I might even add some fresh avacado and lime to kick it up some more next time.

Delish. Was afraid it would be too heavy for summer but was delicious. Used anasazi beans, soaked overnight, roasted the squash, substituted chicken broth instead of beef broth, doubled using fresh corn (2 ears), followed everything else except skipped pepitas. Added a little salt and dash of rice wine vinegar to each serving and it was amazing. Used a freshly made Salvadorean sausage that was labled mild and it had plenty of flavor. Didn't think it needed any additional spices.

I made this w/ pre-roasted delicate squash and canned beans. By mistake, only bought half the chorizo, but that was fine. And thanks much to LauraER for the topping suggestion: I left out the ground pepitas, and made a paste from a mostly seeded jalapeno, a couple of garlic cloves, some lime juice (on hand), and around 3T of pepitas. It was brilliant! I liked the soup quite well, but will definitely use that paste for lots of things! For liquid I used mostly homemade chicken broth, since finishing it up was the original motivation for this recipe anyway.

Absolutely delicious. Your family will eat it even if they don't like squash. I used home-made beef broth instead of canned, and because of a squash mishap I replaced 2 cups of squash w/pureed pumpkin. I also pre-roasted the squash and added it in along with the bell peppers, corn and chorizo. That way I didn't have chunks, just the thick creamy meat of the squash. To add a kick, a little Sriracha adds the perfect touch.

I've used this recipe for years but had lost the mag. in a move. I use canned black beans rinsed and added with the peppers and ignore the ground pepits. The ground seeds make it taste like some weird porridge. I have annother squash soup recipe which choppes the pepitas with a bit of garlic and hot chile mixed with a bit of oil and lime juice. A teaspoon of that as garnish on top is just right. I also use banana squash as a personal preferance. I find butternut jusrt a bit too pastey

Tried this for the first time last night and it was quite tasty! However, I did deviate from the original recipe, using some other reviewers' suggestions as well as a few changes of my own. Roasting the squash added a nice flavor. I seasoned it with ground cloves, nutmeg, and allspice, though they didn't come out too much in the end. Next time I'll sprinkle a little brown sugar to help the caramelization (side note: caramelization is actually the process by which just sugars turn brown and form flavor compounds; when a protein is also available (squash), it undergoes the Maillard Reaction instead. Because caramels are made with milk, they should really be called maillards.). I used canned canellini beans and they worked great - just add when you put in the chorizo. I decided I wanted to pureé my soup, so I blistered about 3 corn tortillas over high dry heat in a skillet, torn them in pieces, put them in a glass bowl with some chicken stock to cover, and put them in the microwave for a minute. I returned the tortillas to the pot just after the squash simmers but before adding the chorizo, peppers, corn, and beans. I then blended the soup in batches - the last batch will probably be more liquid, so omitting some of this liquid helps control consistency. I then added all the other good stuff back in the pot. The tortillas add some starch that binds everything together nicely. Next time I'll cut back on the peppers and corn a bit - just a bit too much stuff that covered up the butternut squash flavors.

Wowwy, zowwy, here's a keeper. Instead of chorizo, I used Andouille sausage. Like several previous reviewers, I preroasted the squash cubes. Andouille goes so exceptionally well with the sweet butternut squash. Yum!

I was so looking forward to this recipe and contrary to other reviewers I just found it blah. One mistake I definately made was cooking the soup in the cast iron dutch oven I had used for the chorizo and onions and I guess it is not fully cured because the soup/stew had a metallic taste. I used very good chorizo from a Mexican market and pre-roasted the squash. What a disappointment!

This recipe was incredibly easy and very flavorful..I followed the reviews of others and omitted the red/green peppers, added roasted potatoes with roasted butternut squashm and substituted canellini for kidney beans as a matter of preference. Also, I used a 32oz. box of Swanson beef broth and cut back on the water a bit (2-1/2 cups). I prepared this for book club the night before and reheated it night of.. there were sadly no leftovers.

This soup has potential, but it needs something more. The broth diluted with 3 cups of water makes for a very watery, tasteless base. The ground pepitas add nothing--it looks like specks of chewed-up peanuts, I wouldn't bother with them next time. Maybe tomato paste, or pureeing part of the soup and stirring it back in would help. Any ideas would be welcome, I have a gallon of this stuff left in my fridge :-) .

It has a great flavor whether you make it as a soup or a stew. Though I left out the pumpkin seeds since I didn't have any.

I made this soup as a main course & it is just wonderful. I too roasted the squash in hopes that the sugars would carmelize & develop more depth. Boy, did it ever! I'll try canned beans next time--dried beans didn't seem worth the fuss. Omit Chorizo? Soy Chorizo? In Texas we believe that on the 8th day of creation, God made Chorizo. Silly northerners.

I agree with the last reviewer that this recipe stands on its own as a true vegetarian recipe without the chorizo and beef broth. I've made this recipe several times now and here are my changes: Increase the kdney beans to 1 cup and cook them in a pressure cooker for 25 minutes; use homemade vegetable broth; split the squash (any type you like) lengthwise and season with nutmeg, allspice, mace and ground cloves the bake it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Brown the peppers, onion and garlic in a large skillet using plenty of olive oil and deglaze the pan with white wine before adding to the broth. Pepitas are available in my local grocery but if you can find them just brown up the salted seeds from the squash in the oven. Sometime I use chorizo and other times I don't -- it's up to you.

I made this as written and I thought it was very good. I do think it would be better as a vegetarian soup. The chorizo didn't add much for me and I think a sweeter vegetable broth would work with the vegetables better than the beef broth. The next time I make it I will omit the chorizo, use 2 tbl of olive oil and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes when I saute the onions and garlic. I will double the kidney beans to 1 1/2 cups and substitute 4 cups of vegetable broth for the beef broth.

Used canned beans. Peeled squash with vegetable peeler. Cubed and roasted the squash before adding to the soup. This gave it more depth.

This is a wonderful soup -- and it freezes well also. I use pork chorizo - it's great!

Excellent! I made it with Soy chorizo, which cut the fat and actually improved the taste!! It is called Soyrizo.

Pepitas are shelled pumpkin seeds, not sunflower seeds

This is a lovely, hearty, chilly day soup. The butternut squash develops a lovely texture during the cooking. For the uninitiated, pepitas are shelled sunflower seeds; look for them in the bulk foods section.

great recipie! This is a very adaptable recipie. I used chicken broth instead of the beef broth in one pot... just as good.

I have made this soup twice as it is delicious. The blend of ingredients is wonderful. Both times I have made this recipe I have used canned kidney beans with great results. Just add the beans when adding the peppers, corn and chorizo.

I didn't know what to expect with this soup and I was surprised at how yummy it was. I roasted the split squash the day before (I hate peeling raw squash) and used fresh corn. The beans took a lot longer to cook even though I soaked them for 24hrs. Use canned if you are in a hurry. The spicyness of the sausage really made the recipe and the ground pepitas thickens it. Restaurant quality soup that I'll make again and again!

I served this soup with dry rub pork ribs and jalapeno corn bread for New Years Eve dinner. The soup was a success, although I had to be cautious with the chorizo. I limited the amount of chorizo that I put in based my concern that the soup could become too oily. Additionally, I added more butternut squash than the recipe called for, and I would probably add more the next time I make it.
