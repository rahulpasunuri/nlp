I make this Trifle at least a couple of times each summer. It always is a hit with my guests. Make it exactly as written and you will have a home run every time.

I followed the suggestion and cut the sugar in half for the curd and reduced to taste for everything else. Still pretty sweet, I can't imagine if I had used what the recipe calls for. I also used raspberries for the puree and it looked and tasted fab! I personally didn't get the point of the syrup and probably won't make that again. All in all I would make this again even though it is labor intensive. It looks good and is a crowd pleaser when you dig in.

Basically, after reading everyone,s review and trying it on my own, I think the trick is to cut the sugar in half every step of the way. Surprisingly, it remains very sweet!

While this a great dessert for company (quantity, presentation when tarted up with toasted almonds and fresh mint sprigs), I found it far too sweet. It did get eaten up but I dunno if I'd make it again. Think I prefer the traditional take on trifle (i.e. raspberries and jelly roll and Bird's custard). Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

I've never seen my husband this excited about a dessert. It was a total hit! I disagree with the user that said to use coolwhip. It wouldn't be the same. It's fantastic!

I was dubious about this after assembling it but it turned out to be a hit. Next time I will use my usual lemon pie filling instead of the curd, which was sickeningly sweet, even with less sugar. I also used frozen blueberries, which worked well. I used the citrus pound cake recipe (used about 2/3 of the cake), which was also good. I did not leave the curd over night, just refrigerated it in a cool bowl for 2-3 hours, no problem. I was not sure what size of bowl to use so I went with a large one and although not completely full it still looked great after piping on some extra whipped cream (recipe was not enough to finish it nicely) and topping with toasted almonds as recommended previously.

This was my first trifle ever and it was a wonderful way to ring in the new year. It's winter, so I had to use frozen blueberries and it worked beautifully. I also toasted and sugared some sliced almonds and threw them on top. Delicious!

Yum! Great dessert! Next time I will definitely cut the amount of sugar-- it was very sweet, but everyone loved it. Other reviews said this was an easy dessert, but I disagree-- it was pretty time consuming (not hard, just time consuming). Make sure you give yourself enough time (note that the lemon curd chills overnight!). I didn't puree the blueberries-- just mashed them with the lemon syrup, and it was great. No need to wash your food processor! Will definitely save this recipe (I especially loved the cream cheese/whipped cream combo)

Really good. My first time making a truffle so the presentation could have been better.. Light, tart, and fresh. Not too sweet. Used "parve" (tofutti brand) cream cheese & "parve" whipped cream. The bowl was licked clean

Blueberries were $6/half-pint at my market, so I used a 15-oz. bag of frozen wild blueberries, which was just right. Used 8 oz. mascarpone, and the meyer lemon curd from this site (recipe doubled). At the suggestion of other reviewers, I decreased the sugar at each step (esp. since I used meyers, also for the syrup). Once the parts are made (I had a 9 x 5 lemon pound cake left over, which was just the right amount), this goes together quickly. Very delicious, and perfect for kids and other alcohol-avoidant types. I look forward to trying this with fresh berries.

Everyone enjoyed this but I agree that it is very sweet. You could probably cut the sugar in half and not miss it!

THIS DESSERT TAKES SOME TIME TO MAKE BUT WELL WORTH THE EFFORT! I'VE MADE IT MANY TIME WITH RAVE REVIEWS EVERYTIME. I HAVE TO TAKE COPIES OF THE RECIPE WITH ME SINCE EVERYBODY ASKS ME FOR IT. IT ALSO A GREAT WAY TO USE BLUEBERRIES WHEN THEY ARE CHEAP AND IN SEASON. TERRIFIC!!!

Blueberries were not in season the first time I made so I used strawberries instead. Got rave reviews! Now I'm going to do the blueberry version, now that it's summer. Great for big groups!

I simplified this recipe by combining one jar of store-bought curd with the cream cheese mixture. I also combined all of the lemon syrup with the blueberry puree and layered: pound cake, then cream cheese mix, then blueberry puree, then whipped cream & repeat layers. It was tasty and well-received!

The reviews are so helpful. I omitted some sugar at each step and increased the zest. I used blackberries(only 1 pint)and that was OK. Beautiful and delicious.

This dessert was quite good. I used store bought lemon curd (a well-regarded English variety) and extra pound cake (about 1/4 more than stated in recipe), but otherwise I followed the directions as written. This dessert was very sweet (and I really like sweet desserts), so I think I would cut back on the sugar next time. I made this for dessert on Easter and it received rave reviews. A little time-consuming but will make again!

This was my first attempt at making a trifle and it couldn't have been easier. I made my own poundcake - which didn't take that long- and as soon as all the parts were made, it was easy to just whip together. I did read one review suggesting cool whip replace the whipped cream but why on earth would you do that??? If you're that lazy, don't make the trifle to begin with! This was a very pretty dish and I would make it again for sure.

Made this a large Chanukah gathering in December, using frozen blueberries, and it was very well received! I cut down on the sugar marginally since a few people had said it was too sweet, and it was definitely not too sweet. Even my husband who complains about desserts being too sweet on his own commented that this one was not. I think the frozen blueberries probably helped on that score. I also added about 50% more cake than was suggested. Since frozen blueberries don't make a good garnish on the top, I made chocolate leaves (from the tiramasu and eggnog trifle recipe on this site) and piped whipping cream around the edges. It's a nice dessert for the dead of winter- holds out the hope for summer to return.

I didn't enjoy this at all. To make it easier, just use cool whip instead of performing the steps with the whipping cream.

It was good, but seriously sweet.

This was the hit of our large family gathering in honor of my grandmother's 95th birthday last month. I doubled the recipe, using 3 pound cakes instead of 2, but did not use all the lemon syrup (which I used as a lovely base for mixed drinks later on). To give a greater kick, lemoncello would be a good substitute for the syrup.

Delicious and visually dramatic, but very time-consuming (I made my own pound cake). I agree with the reviewer from Dallas - perhaps the lemon syrup could be made with less sugar, since the trifle is a tad too sweet. I had a problem fitting all the layers into my 14 cup capacity trifle bowl, and had to leave out most of the last layer of whipped cream/cream cheese. Perhaps I used too much pound cake...

WOW! This was FANTASTIC! I used more cake than was called for as I found it a bit goopy but with the extra cake (1.5x) it was just AMAZING! One of the best deserts I've ever had.

I made this for my book club's annual luncheon and got lots of compliments. The recipe makes a enough for a lot of people, so I'm glad I have some left over for the family. It is yummy!

I made this for my husband's men's group last summer. They prounounced it the best dessert they ever ate. The best part is this is a trifle without alcohol--no rum or sherry. I find it a little sweet and will, perhaps reduce the sugar in the lemon syrup next time I make it.

This is an absolutely delicious trifle. I made it for our family Christmas dinner. I got rave reviews. Easy to make a day ahead of the party. I agree with one of the other reviewers: This trifle serves easily more than 16 people versus 10 to 12. Let's not overdo it. This is a dessert not a main course. Happily cooking in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.

I felt I had too much berry mixture compared to cream mixture for my tastes. This is a really good base recipe though. Made again with pineapple and rum layers, topped with toasted coconut- excellent variation! Quick to make too.

This was time consuming, but very well worth it!! It got rave revues. However, I disagree with the amount of people it feeds. More like, 20, especially if there are more desserts that are being served. It's a winner!!!
