A very refreshing and attractive salad. And the flavor was outstanding. It couldn't have been simpler to make. There were 5 of us for dinner and everyone had seconds. The only downside was that the host prepared peppered salmon, and the salad was not a flavor match. Oh well. We'll be making this frequently this summer, only not when salmon is served.

This recipe was time consuming to make, but it was worth it. Everybody loved it! And the positive feedback from the crowd means that I'll make it again. Invest in a cherry pitter, it makes it a lot easier.

Delicious fruit salad! Just remember to follow all the easy the directions. I sprinkled the mint sugar on the salad as I was running out to a picnic and didn't stir it in until I got there. Looked a bit like pesto on fruit salad at first! Ugh! Freaked out my grandson. Turned out delicious though and will make frequently. Everyone ended up loving it!

This recipe was so simple, yet incredible! We picked our blackberries from our backyard immediately before preparing, which I think helped with the freshness of the salad. Perfect proportion of mint and sugar--not overwhelming, just fresh and delicious.

Awesome. I make this every time I need to go to a party in the summer. Everyone loves it. Buy a cherry pitter if you don't have one. Pitting cherries is a pain, but so worth it.

Used half cherries, half blackberries and followed the rest of the recipe. Pitting the cherries was time consuming, but the result was gorgeously colorful and delicious -- drew rave reviews from everyone at the BBQ. Will definitely make this again -- it was the hit of the party.

Made this for a family BBQ on Father's Day and it was a total hit! Everybody loved it! The mint added a really refreshing flavor and was perfect for such a warm day. I was using an immersion blender (didn't have a food processor) so I added two tbsp of water to the mint and sugar. It actually was fantastic. We used the leftover mixture to add to our Arnold Palmers and it was DELICIOUS - we named our concoction a Lee Trevino! Will absolutely make this again!

This is my go-to recipe for showers, picnics, parties in the Summertime when asked to bring a dish. It always gets rave reviews. It's very easy to switch out fruits that are less expensive/in season such as strawberries, orange slices, blueberries, etc but the peaches are a must!

I omitted the sugar and simply tossed the mint with the fruit. It was outstanding. Everyone loved it. If the fruit is a bit tart then I will add the sugar.

This was fresh and really easy. I made it twice, the second time with peaches, nectarines, blueberries and cantaloupe. It's definitely better the first day--the mint gets kind of icky after that.

I love this recipe. The mint is fabulous. I made it with raspberries, blackberries, peaches, strawberries, and cherries.

This recipe is easy and I have gotten great reviews from those who try it. I love mint flavor in just about anything - it's a perfect summer salad.

I used watermelon, strawberries, one grapefruit, blackberries, and a small amount of red grapes cut in half. The combination, along with chopped mint and lime juice was a huge barbeque hit, thanks to everyone else's suggestions. Will definitely add mint to my fruit salads again!

Delicious and so gorgeous to serve. We re-named it Mojito Salad b'c it reminds us of the drink. We've made it with both cherries and blackberries. Both are delish... blackberries make it more beautiful.

Made this for a soccer mom party with cherries, green grapes and apricots. It was amazing. I want to think of more uses for mint sugar! My husband thinks it would be great with watermelon.

So simple; made for a family BBQ, people were eating it for dessert, instead of the actual desserts!

Made this salad last year for a cooking class and now that cherries are in season, it's on the menu for tonight's Father's Day get together. A truly beautiful fruit salad that is such a welcoming change of pace from the run-of-the-mill fruit salads. The cherries are a bit labor-intensive with the pitting, etc. but when they are in season, ooooooh...there's nothing better. This is one of my most favorite salads!

Perfect recipe for a summer BBQ - prepared the sugar in advance the day before. At first, the sugar did clump a bit with the mint once blended, but the next day it had hardened and crumbled over the fruit salad without difficulty. Will be making it again on Tuesday!

I made this and you could hardly taste the mint. I don't think it was worth the trouble.

I made this as part of my Mother's Day breakfast, and it was a hit. My Dad went back for seconds, thirds, fourths... I will make this recipe again for sure. So much sure that I went out today and bought a cherry pitter!!!!!!!!!!

I added strawberries and blueberries to this recipe along with some fresh lime juice (1/2 of a lime), it was delicious!

Gee - the first half of my comment (below) didn't post. So, here's the beginning so it all makes sense --- Here's a new twist: I lived in Brazil and this recipe inspired some creative drinks, which became instant hits around our grill with guests - young and old. First, mash the mint leaves with the sugar using morter and pestle (or the back of a wooden spoon in the bottom of a glass for individual servings). Then, you can either...

1. Mix into aqua fresca (esp honeydew and watermelon) or lemonade (can add some ginger to lemonade too) for G-rating and add some liquor for 21-rating 2. Combine with mashed fresh fruit (berries, stone fruits) and then mix into water (plain or with gas) for G-rating or favorite liquor (brazilian cacacha is best, rum and vodka work too) and pour over ice for 21-rating. Hide everyone's car keys. SALUD!

Easy! Great as a light dessert for a lunch or dinner, perfect side for brunch. There are NEVER any leftovers when I make this.

A simple way to turn wonderful summer fruit salad into something extraordinary. Turbinado sugar adds a nice texture contrast to the smoothness of the fruit. This was an excellent addition to a summer brunch, though I imagine it would make dessert something special as well.

Wonderful! If you don't have mint - buy it. Without it, it's just another bowl of fruit. It's definitely something special with it!

I love this salad! I've also done a variation of it with grapefruit and orange segments topped with pomagranite seeds. It is a tradition in my family for Thanksgiving dinner.

I can see this mint sugar in any fresh seasonal fruit combination. Even winter fruit will benefit from it, if fresh mint is available. A delightful light dessert, or brunch dish.

This was simple and scrumptious. The mint is a great addition but not overpowering. I used Splenda to cut back on sugar and still had good results. This is light and perfect for a summer meal.

Fantastic and so easy! I used strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, grapes, and less sugar. Surprisingly, there were leftovers that were so yummy the next day. All my guests raved about this dish! I'm making this again tonight with different fruit.

Delicious and refreshing - I used only nectarines & grapes. My husband likes this even better than Fruit Salad with Ginger Syrup, and just as much as Fresh Fruit with Honey-Yogurt Dip (although he did note that this one is much lighter). I added the mint sugar to taste so the flavor didn't overwhelm.

try a variation of this type of recipe: to 1/4 cup sugar process with 1 cup fresh basil (make sure basil is not damp, as then you would be making pesto.) Sprinkle over fresh cut up pineapple...and serve immediately ....it's unusual and delicious!

I haven't made this recipe yet, However I have made a similiar one with just Watermellon, strawberries and fresh mint. You can use Sugar, Splenda or even a liqiud sugar which is actually lighter. It's just as delicious. Bon Apetite!

Very tasty. Used Splenda (diabetic husband) instead, and so the mint mixture got a little clumpy and weird. But as soon as it mixed with the juices of the fruit, it was fantastic. Used the cherries instead of blackberries but also added blueberries. Very simple, very good.

Simple, tasty, and refreshing. I substituted ripe blueberries and cherries for the blackberries. I also chopped the peaches into small pieces instead of wedges.

This was the hit of the Fourth of July BBQ. Everyone loved it. I plan on making this every weekend while there's great fruit at the farmer's market.

I tossed cut up strawberries with the mint sugar, left in the frig overnight, and served on mango sherbet. Everyone raved. It was outstanding!!! Plus terribly easy. (Use a small processor if you have one.)
