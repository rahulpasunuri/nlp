I've been baking this bread at least monthly since the recipe came out in 1997. I keep buttermilk in the fridge just for this recipe. I've had it written down so long I forgot where it came from, until I came across it on this site. I normally don't bake low-fat items as I'd rather have an occasional splurge with the real thing. However, a few times when I've baked a "regular" banana bread recipe as a treat, I've been disappointed. My family and I actually prefer this version! It's so yummy, and I love not seeing a big blob of oil after I place a slice on a napkin!

Very tasty! Went with other reviews and substituted 3/4 of the flour with whole wheat and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Great staple recipe for ripe bananas! I never buy buttermilk - make it yourself with 1% milk and add lemon juice, let sit 5 minutes. I also add 1 tablespoon cinnamon and choc chips. Enjoy:)

Rating: 4
I make this all the time. I usually substitute yoghurt for the buttermilk since I am more likely to have that on hand. I use 2/3 parts whole wheat flour and 1/3 part almond flour - this denser texture tends to add to the cooking time. I mix 3-4 extra ripe bananas into batter, then throw in 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 just ripe banana cut into chunks, right at the end. I use butter to grease the pan for a nice crust around the bread.

I have made this recipe several times. Kids absolutely love it and request it. I believe that the buttermilk is what makes it. I add mini chocolate morsels which make it mouthwatering. It is a drier variety of banana bread which is what we like, not wet as most are. Pretty fool proof recipe.

Rating: 3
I made this bread vegan by substituting 2 tbsp. flax meal (mixed beforehand with 6 tbsp. water), and soymilk with a splash of vinegar instead of buttermilk. I also only put in half the sugar. It came out denser than I would have liked it and didn't rise much, but I suspect it was because of the substitutions. Still delicious and moist though!

I am watching my fats and sugars so this recipe looked like a great place to start! I tweaked the recipe, so if that bothers you stop reading! I used brown sugar, and less than called for, Greek nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk, doubled the oil and used walnut oil. I added about 1/2 cup of toasted walnuts, 3 bananas which was over 1 cup - but so what-, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and ginger. Could have had more spice. The texture was pretty good - no Martha Stewart recipe, but I was wanting a low fat delicious recipe and that is what I got! Mine figured out to #10 223 calorie servings (3 oz. each! I'll definitely make this one again and try just 1 tbsp of oil and add double cinnamon for sure!

This is a good basic recipe for lowfat banana bread. I made it as is and it turned out well, and then I changed things up while baking with my toddler by adding 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup, replacing 3/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour, adding 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, and baking it as regular and mini-sized muffins. He loved them!!! As did I. They are moist and flavorful. One tip - due to the low fat content, if baking this in mini-muffin form, next time I will coat the muffin paper liners with non-stick spray, since the batter really stuck to the paper and several muffins became muffin tops. :)

Used whole-wheat white flour, added cashews and no-sugar coconut flakes. Ridiculously good. I will be playing with this recipe for a while. :-D

* Deeeelicious ! The chocolate chips and the walnuts are a Fantastic addition; however, today it's the Low- Fat version :) Almond Milk instead of Buttermilk. And I like the Butter replacement of the oil. I always use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" because that's what I always have :)

A very delicious banana bread. We have lactose issues in our house so I used the plain, unsweetened almond milk we have in the fridge with a splash of white vinegar in place of the buttermilk, let it sit to get to room temp. I also used toasted walnut oil for the 1 Tbsp of oil, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and just a sprinkling of semi-sweet chocolate chips. It was a huge hit!

I love this recipe! Usually add a little more banana, add chopped walnuts and I always double it. It has been very well received and enjoyed by all. I think best when chilled first. What a great way to use the brown bananas. I served it to the family as the birthday cake for my grand child's 2nd birthday with a big candle in it! She LOVED it!

Ok, I am a great cook and an ok baker. I got a new emile henery loaf pan for christmas and wanted to try it. I was looking for something low cal and came across this. I didn't have buttermilk in the refrig so substituted the remaining whip cream I had from christmas scallop potatoes and thought...not necessarily low cal but worth a try. My bread turned out excellent and made another loaf to use the remainder of the cream.

I liked this very much - fairly easy once I got the mixer out of the cabinet. I added some toasted, unsweetened, flaked coconut along with some dark chocolate chips...I also substituted agave for 1/2 the sugar...and it came out just fine!

This is great and does NOT taste lowfat. I made this recipe even more heart friendly by using 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour. I also used 1/2 cup of Egg Beaters instead of two eggs and this recipe still came out wonderful. I added in a handful of chopped walnuts too.

Today is the second time i have made this B-bread. The first time I used 4 bananas because that's how many i had that were ripe, it was great. I sliced up half and froze the rest. It was delicious both fresh and from the freezer. Today i added cinnamon, ginger and cloves, a little more kick and still nice and moist.

I have to say I was disappointed ... but I haven't made a lot of low-fat banana breads so maybe this is as good as it gets, when it comes to low-fat? Definitely needs some walnuts and cinnamon. Quite bland

This was one of the best banana breads I've made. I used yogurt instead of buttermilk and 1 Tbsp of butter instead of oil, and I added some walnuts. I also accidentally put in extra baking soda, maybe even twice as much. But the bread turned out great--tasty and light.

I too have made this bread for years. It's a real keeper! To give the bread more zip, I reserve some of the batter, add a little more sugar to it with cinnamon and chopped walnuts. I then swirl the cinnamon/walnut mixture into the batter. I freeze the bread and then slice off a few pieces and toast them or warm them in a toaster oven. Houseguests love it and always ask for the recipe!

Loved this bread. I didn't find that it dried out after a couple of days, as one of the reviews stated. I used Greek yogurt in place of the buttermilk. It worked great. I found that the loaf pan was too small for this recipe, so I'm going to use a 9 x 5 pan next time.

This has good crumb and good banana flavor. It freezes well, too. Within a day or two it becomes a little dry due to its low-fat quality. If you don't need it to be quite so low-fat, you could substitute whole milk soured with a little lemon juice for the buttermilk, and perhaps add one more tablespoon of oil. But overall this is a good everyday recipe.

A little on the rubbery side, yet moist but kind of boring without any nuts or anything otherwise not bad for lowfat banana bread but I will add walnuts and maybe some chocolate chips and use this recipe as a base.

Doubled the recipe -- used a little more than normal of banana. Added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, added golden raisins and walnuts, 1/4 cup more of low-fat buttermilk. The two loaves are baking right now -- can't wait to try it. It's sunny here, low 70's, low humidity. Can't wait.

Low-fat banana breads, especially those that use yogurt, tend to be a bit rubbery. This one uses buttermilk, which I think makes it a bit better, though of course it doesn't have the tender texture of a loaf with more oil. Following previous reviews, I used four bananas instead of three- and since they were previously frozen (my usual response to a bunch of overripe bananas is to toss 'em in the freezer where they stay until I have time to deal with them), I took 1/3 cup of the liquid that they gave off when thawing and used buttermilk powder instead of using 1/3 buttermilk. The result was an intensely banana-ey flavor, which is kind of the purpose of banana bread, I guess! I think this is the best low-fat recipe I've found so far, I'll definitely stick with it from now on. I also added about 1/4 cup wheat germ and decreased the flour a bit, and the texture still came out fine.

I've been using this recipe a *lot* during my stay in Paraguay (beautiful fresh bananas....sold by the dozen, ergo lots of banana bread). I have been using yogurt (as many of the reviewers have). And add a dash of cinnamon (or 'canela' in this neck of the woods). Completely fool-proof! You can guess-timate the proportions of just about any of the ingredients...which is fabulous!

Excellent--I noticed no difference between this and my old full-fat banana bread. I made this with a few minor adjustments--butter instead of oil; 4 medium bananas and 1/8 tsp each of ginger, cardamum, nutmeg and cinnamon.

I thought this was a good banana bread and wouldn't be able to detect it is low fat. It isn't the heavy, dense bread that many of us expect from banana bread. It is lighter (as in less dense) and the texture isn't compromised by the lack of fat. This could be 4 forks if it had some sort of spices/seasoning in it. Next time I will play with the usual suspects (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, etc) and see if I can tweak this a little.

A moist, light bread with intense banana flavor. Like another reviewer, I added a pinch each of cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. I also replaced the Tbsp of oil with a Tbsp of butter. (I'm not sure this still counts as low-fat if you slather butter on afterward, but it's a delicious touch!)

Every time I make this banana bread, I get asked for the recipe. It's so great! Light-tasting, not oily like other recipes. The buttermilk is a great addition, and I've been known to add chocolate chips, nuts, and even M&Ms on occasion.

I love this recipe. I add two tablespoons of vinegar to milk and it'll literally turn it into buttermilk. I do increase the vegetable oil slightly as well as the bananas. I have a tendancy to toss in other fruit that is lurking around my fridge, which often can be blueberries or raspberries. I like pecans because they add a buttery taste as well. My daughter begs me to make this loaf for her when she is leaving to go back to university. Her roomies love it for breakfast food.

Great recipe, my go-to for banana bread. I used 3 large bananas (probably more than 1 cup) and otherwise followed the recipe except used 1/4 c white sugar+1/4 c brown sugar (instead of 3/4 c sugar), walnut oil instead of veg oil, 1 c white whole wheat flour+3/4 c AP flour (instead of all AP flour). I added 1/2 c toasted walnuts and 1/2 c choc chips and some cinnamon. Excellent! Tender, soft, spongy, cake-like texture. Remember that banana bread always tastes better the next day, as was the case here. It is great for a snack, taken from the freezer and warmed in the microwave.

Rating: 4
It's become a regular favorite -- I like it more than the heavier, leave-oil-on-your-fingers banana bread. I halve the amount of sugar, use bananas that are almost black, and use melted butter in place of the vegetable oil. It's wonderful and very easy to make.

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting goat's milk for the buttermilk and the addition of spices (cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg and ginger). The flavor wasn't fantastic, but it was tasty and fairly moist. As some have mentioned, however, the bread was a bit rubbery. I actually didn't mind the texture, because it allows you to slice it very thin without crumbling. If I make it again, I'll try to jazz up the flavor a bit more...maybe more spices?

Great recipe! For healthier version, I used organic whole grain flour, brown rice syrup, extra virgin olive oil,added cinnamon, 1 cup vanilla soymilk with 1/4 cup melted butter, and toasted walnuts - I don't care for overly sweet breads so this came out perfectly moist, with distinct banana flavor (3.5 overripe bananas) - great for breakfast!

This is excellent. But try this to make it healthier and even tastier: Replace all white flour flour with whole wheat flour, significantly reduce the amount of sugar (to less than 1/2 cup), add about 3/4 cup chopped pecans (walnuts would probably be even better, but I didn't have any), and add some dried cranberries (1/2 cup?). Yummmm! I've made this bread several times, every time with a new twist... The latest, with all of the changes I just mentioned, is the best yet.

This recipe makes a decent low-fat banana bread. I can't say that it simply makes good banana bread: the lack of fat is palpable from the first chewy bite. Make this if you're serious about avoiding fat. Don't make it in the hopes of finding a lighter recipe that tastes just like the real (rich) deal.

Really good! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 2 bananas because they added to 1 cup. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips. I sprinkled some brown sugar and chocolate chips on top of the loaf as well to make it extra good! I ended up using a 9 x 13 inch loaf pan since the suggested loaf pan size was way too small. My whole family loved it and it's healthy!

Rating: 4
I used all whole grain flour, 3 bananas, 1/2 c brown sugar. I used my electric KA mixer for the liquids per the recipe and then quickly folded in the dry ingredients. I let the batter sit in the pan for 5 min so that the whole grain flour could absorb liquid. Be sure to watch the bread in the oven because overbaking will result in a dry bread. Version 1: white whole wheat flour, 1/2 c whole toasted pecans. Really good. Slightly dense and firm but not heavy. A bit grainy due to the ww flour but not too obvious. Overbaked but still moist inside. Version 2: 1 c whole wheat flour + 3/4 c oat flour, 1/2 c choc chips, 1 tsp cinnamon, increased to ½ c buttermilk since oat flour tends to absorb liquid and become dry. Really good. It had more of a crumb to it and was slightly moist. Not as sweet as Version 1 (maybe because I used bananas from the freezer or oat flour). Great warm out of the oven with melty chocolate chips! I am rating the recipe 4 forks because in both versions, I could not tell that they used all whole grain flour or that they were low-fat! This is a great recipe that can be made really healthy. This would be fun to try with pumpkin, too.

I just made this banana bread last night and it came out really well. It was very moist and light. Not too sugary which was great. I used half regular sugar and half brown sugar.

This was better than I expected for a lowfat recipe, just not as great as I expected (based on reviews). I'll make it again though.

I made this and, not expecting it to be that good because of my past experience with low-fat baking, added milk chocolate chips at the last minute.

So excellent I made it three times in two days to use up all the bananas we had sitting around the house. I used plain yogurt with lemon juice instead of buttermilk and baking Splenda instead of sugar. One time the bread didn't rise and I think it's because the other two times I beat the other wet ingredients together before adding to the egg-Splenda mixture. I also added spices and chopped walnuts--it is so good it's a sin to waste calories on the recipes which use fat. Moist and tender and plenty of flavor.

I also slightly processed 3/4 c. of rolled oats for part of the flour, added 1 T. cinnamon and lots of chopped walnuts. My girls are having a fit--I have been asked to make them right now!

My oven must be slow because it took nearly one hour for them to bake separately in the oven, but worth the wait!

This is really good. I've made it a number of times now. I think it's also good with 50% whole wheat flour, and with cinnamon and cloves. Also, I feel it's best with 4 bananas.

Delicious! Used whole wheat flour. Added extra 1.4 cup ground flax seed meal for extra fiber. We used 4 bananas since that is what we had. We had to bake ours a bit longer, not sure if it is because we used more bananas or a light/alum 9x5 loaf pan. Easy to make with kids. Next time, I'd like to add lemon zest or juice, and cinnamon.

Don't be daunted by the low-fatness of this recipe.... it tastes great. I (per usual) made changes without ever having made the original: substituted 1/4 c. brown sugar for white, used all whole wheat pastry flour for white flour, and threw in a handfull of wild blackberries I picked yesterday for added flavor, color and texture. I found the baking time to be a little longer, maybe 65-70 min. My high- fat seeking girlfriend just had a second piece. I won't tell her if you don't! Happy baking all.

I made this with 3 bananas and only had 1 egg. Baked for about 50 minutes; it was perfectly golden with no mushy spots. The first day it was rubbery with a "low-fat" texture, but I wrapped it in foil overnight and the next morning it was perfect with a little butter.

This is a good recipe, but is not dazzling right out of the oven. Give it a day or two to mellow. The flavor is very subtle, and benefits from toasting--the banana flavor becomes almost candy-like.

This was a great healthy recipe! I substituted evaporated cane juice for the sugar and used nonfat plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, I also used 2 T applesauce instead of the oil and whole wheat flour. It turned out fluffy, moist and delicious.

I had a lot of bananas, so I doubled the recipe using 6 total. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used skim milk instead. Before cooking, I halved the batter and added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to one loaf. Both loaves turned out fluffy and moist. Tastes great.

Rating: 2
I followed recipe exactly, with the exception of adding an additional banana, that another reviewer had recommended. It did not work out, the bread fell flat and was closer to banana bread pudding after 1:20 cooking time. The buttermilk sub for the oil does not support extra bananas!! Flavor was good though.

This is a great low-fat recipe. I made it even more calorie conscious by substituting the sugar with splenda, the buttermilk with skim milk, and the oil with trans-fat free margarine. It turned out very good!

eh. followed the recipe, making a couple of adjustments to compensate for altitude (7000 ft). It tasted low-fat, and that's not a compliment. Not very flavorful at all, spongy texture, blah. I cook with buttermilk a lot, but it just didn't work here. Won't bother trying again, but adding nuts and spices might help it.

felt guilty after eating it until I reminded myself that it was actually a low fat version. i used plain nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk and 4 bananas. I also added lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg to taste. I had to use a 9x5 pyrex pan at this point. I have made this for dessert adding choc chips and less spice. Not the best banana bread ever, but def the best low fat version! Will try with splenda next time.

Rating: 4
I was very happy with the recipe and it came out perfectly for me (in a 9x5 glass baking pan.) Great texture and flavor. I did add a handful of chopped pecans because I must have nuts in banana bread. I also dotted the top with a handful of chocolate chips i had leftover, and this added the aura of richness with really a very little chocolate. I didn't remember to try to add spice but it really didn't need it in the end. Usually cakes with so low fat don't keep well. I won't get a chance to try that this round as 3 ppl devoured it and we only have an end left for tomorrow. I wasn't necessarily looking for a super lowfat recipe like this and I'm so impressed.

I've made this recipe several times and just haven't been impressed with it, even after tweaking it and adding spices, whole wheat flour, and varying the amount of sugar. I haven't found it to be rubbery, though. Just bland.

I was very impressed by the texture of this low-fat dessert. One problem: it overflowed my pan (I was careful to use the correct size) and burned all over the oven! Next time, I will use a 9X5 pan instead. I made a bunch of changes suggested by other reviewers: I added cinnamon, demarara sugar on top, and used non-fat plain yoghurt instead of buttermilk. Because I like things sweet and I love the taste of butter, I added a bit of honey and a half-tablespoon of butter to replace the fat content of low-fat buttermilk. I will say that I wish my bananas had been fully over the hill, but it was still a delightful texture - very dense and moist compared to most lowfat things. I stored it in a closed container on the table and it was even better three days later when I ate the last of it.

This recipe came out very well with a few additions and substitutions. I used low fat vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and omitted the vanilla extract. I added juice of one lemon and finely chopped lemon rind from half of the same lemon. I also added a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. Very moist and delicious. The lemon and cinnamon gave it a good kick. Will definitely make again.

4 stars for being low fat and tasty! I used splenda, which made this low-calorie too. Instead of buttermilk, I used skim milk + a teaspoon of vinegar. Added loads of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, a dash of almond extract, as well as more banana (maybe 1/2 cup more). Also added 1/2 cup of walnuts. I believe the addition of spices and nuts is necessary to give this a 'richer' taste. Baked for a bit over 1 hour. I can see how some found it gooey as 1 hour (at least in my oven), was not enough to fully bake the cake (still gooey when tested with skewer). After an additional 15 minutes, it seemed well baked. Texture was moist and not dense. Perfect!

Rating: 4
I had a bunch of very brown, aromatic bananas that needed to be used NOW. We were snowed in so I couldn't run out to get ingredients, so I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk and oil, reduced the flour by a half cup, and subbed in half brown sugar. I didn't have high hopes because of all my desperate compromises. Also, I'm usually annoyed by reviewers who make a lot of substitutions, but I have to say, this was (accidentally) the best banana bread I have ever had.

Rating: 3
I made this with sour cream as that is what I had and very little mixing due to previous comments and it was great. The walnuts are a must and pop a slice in the toaster the next day and top with a little butter, after all it is low fat!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. If you like the really heavy, dense buttery style banana bread, you may want to skip this one. However, if you want a delicious banana loaf (or, I usually make muffins) that won't break the calorie bank, you must try this recipe!!

Great recipe, and so easy to adapt to your own whims. Bearing in mind the rubbery texture noted by a couple of readers, I treated the mix gently, like muffin mix, and it came out great. We never have buttermilk in the house, so I used plain non-fat yogurt. I prefer wholemeal, and not too sweet, so I used 1/2 cup sugar (plenty!), 3/4 cup wholemeal flour, and added pecans and walnuts. I couldn't resist putting demarara sugar on top though for that lovely crunchy crust :) The bread is absolutely yummy, and I'll definitely be using the recipe again.

Rating: 3
Great low fat bread overall... I stayed very exact with amounts though I did sub out a very small amount (just over 1/4 cup) of whole wheat bread flour for the all purpose. That amount seemed perfect-I didn't want it being too grainy. My 2 large blackened bananas were wonderful and needed no smashing beyond my fingers pushing them into the measuring cup. I spiced it up with a touch of nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, a tiny bit of ginger powder, and maybe some other things I'm forgetting, and since I had vanilla beans but no extract (backwards, I admit), I scraped some of those into the batter. I also added a generous amount of walnuts just before spooning it in--the batter was thick enough to keep them very evenly distributed so I didn't have a layer of bread and a layer of nuts like some recipes have resulted in (I kept them large-quarters and halves, which helps them stay put, too, especially good for things like this that involve slicing pieces anyway!).

Rating: 3
I'm not a very good or experienced cook (understatement!) so I really appreciate it when the other readers send in their suggestions on ways to improve or substitute ingrediants especially as I can't get buttermilk here (used skim milk instead). So thank you all.

I've made this a few times now and I think it is great as is. Once I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk with great results as well. I tried the suggestion of using half whole wheat flour this last time since I love sneaking it into other baked goods, the taste was unchanged but the texture was kind of grainy when eating, next time I'll stick with regular white flour.

Made muffins with this recipe and was not impressed. I was looking for a lower fat alternative to the excellent "Palace Cafe" recipe in Bon Appetit Sep. 1991. That recipe is not available on this site, but it is almost identical to the Banana-Macadamia Nut Muffins recipe which is available. I'll stick with the high fat recipes that taste good!

I read all the reviews of this recipe and substituted accordingly. I didn't have buttermilk so used a combo of low fat sour cream and french vanilla yogurt. Added walnuts and my husband loved it. It was good, but whoever described the texture as 'rubbery' was dead-on. I didn't like that about it, and I wonder if it had anything to do with the lack of butter?

Very good low fat banana bread! Used sour cream instead of buttermilk, added cinnamon and nutmeg. Will add nuts next time. Yummy! For those getting a bitter taste - it's probably your baking powder. The Calumet brand (red can with Indian)seems bitter to me. I've switched to Clabber girl.

This was a very tasty banana bread -- especially considering the calorie and fat savings (1 cup of vegetable oil has over 1,900 calories vs 30 for 1/3 of a cup of buttermilk. I made this for my cholesterol-conscious husband and banana-loving 21 month old, who upon tasting it, proclaimed "more cake!" I doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt pan. I used organic sugar which has a light brown color to it (and a richer flavor?), low fat organic buttermilk and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Next time, I might add nuts. A dusting of powdered sugar on top of the bundt made this a beauty.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and it is always a winner. Everyone who tries it is amazed that it is lower in fat than traditional banana bread. As other cooks stated, I too used all brown sugar once and mixed brown and white another time- it doesn't matter the taste is the same. Also, I have used spelt flour which is similar to wheat, but completely wheat free and that worked too. The bread is always the perfect texture-not too wet not too dry.

For being the first thing I ever baked, this recipie turned out to be a success. adding a sip of honey, and substituting the flour into whole wheat, adds a welcomed kick. The texture turns out puffier than bread, yet drier than a cake.

I was looking for a delicious banana bread recipe, I was surprised to find one of the best ones was also low fat. I also used brown sugar instead of white, and since I use plain keifer on my granola and fruit everyday, I used this instead of buttermilk. The result was very moist and flavorful. I find that really mashing the bananas almost to a puree gave them a more pronounced banana flavor. Of course adding a handfull of chopped pecans and chocolate chips didn't hurt. Will make this my standard recipe.

YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!! The 300+ reviewers were right! This recipe is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I took the advice of several reviewers and used lowfat sour cream and vanilla yogurt (I made a double recipe); added some nuts, raisins and chocolate chips; went half brown-half white sugar, and used 2 extra bananas. Rave reviews all around! I also used flaxseed meal in place of the oil (3-to-1 ratio). I will NEVER make a banana bread with butter again! Next time I'm going to try egg substitute and blueberries, as some other reviewers suggested. Taste and texture are SUBLIME!

I have been making this for YEARS. Who would not like cutting out all that oil in the usual banana bread recipies. Suggestions - Use one extra banana. Whip the eggs and (substitute 3/4c)brown sugar into a frenzy. They should look light in color and fluffy. Add 3/4 tsp cinnamon. I never seem to have buttermilk on hand and use sour cream instead. Have liquid ingredients mixed throughly before pouring over dry ingredients. MIX BY HAND.

Amazing beyond all description. I took the advice of others and used one cup whole wheat flour and I added a little high gluten flour and flax meal as well as some little pecan pieces. SOOOO yummy. My husband took some to work, and now his co-workers keep asking if I've made more. It's so yummy.

I made this bread following the recipe - no substitutions or additions. The bread does have good banana flavor and isn't dry. However, it does have a strong metallic taste. I'm guessing this comes from the baking soda &/or baking powder. I also found the bread to be a little "spongy" even though I was careful not to overmix the flour mixture.

Ok, typing this with one hand, because I am stuffing my face with the banana bread with the other hand. Took others' advice, and used 1 cup WW flour and 3/4 cup white, 3/4 cup dk. brown sugar, plain lo fat yogurt for the buttermilk, and added pecans (it has to have nuts even though they add fat). Also, used 3 frozen bananas, thawed, and 1 fresh ripe banana. Added the vanilla, but left out the spices, as our family does not typically use them in banana bread. Gotta be the best banana bread on the planet, thanks to Epicurious and all the tweakers who shared their tips!

Amazing banana bread!! Lovely crumb and crust and very aromatic and moist. Not overly oily like most breads of this sort, which I've never cared for. My modifications: added extra banana thawed from the freezer (everyone should try this; freezing brings out the sugars somehow), equal amount fat-free yogurt for buttermilk, used 1C whole wheat flour + 3/4C all purpose, 1t cinnamon, 1/2t nutmeg, and 1C chopped walnuts of which 2T were sprinkled on top. Baked it for 50 minutes, which was perfect. Next time I'll probably sub the sugar with 3/4 amount dk brown instead or maybe add some molasses for a little extra depth of flavor. I would have this time but was out.

I have found that the most reliable banana flavor and texture combination comes from using three mashed, thawed, frozen when ripe bananas, with one barely-mashed fresh ripe banana. You can add the thawed bananas to the mixer, but the last banana should be folded in with a spatula or a spoon. I freeze them in the skin, and then peel them after they have thawed. The freezing process really brings up the natural sugars.

i first followed this exactly - great. then i did it again, extra-healthy style: whole wheat flour and oat flour, no-fat yogurt and a table spoon of lemon juice instead of buttermilk, and made it in muffin tins. great breakfast muffin. don't squish the bananas too much -- MUCH better to have banana chunks in it!

Like some of the other reviewers I added a couple of extra bananas. I also substituted sour cream and lemon juice for the buttermilk and added a cup of toasted pecans. I baked them as muffins and they are delicious, if a little dry. Next time I might add some crystalised ginger, finely chopped and maybe a little some cinnamon and nutmeg. An excellent basic banana bread recipe, made even better with a little tweaking. And even better since it's so low fat! Note: Baked as muffins they only require 30 minutes in the oven.

I can't count the number of times i've made this- every time with slight variations, but every time it came out wonderful. Once as muffins, once with frozen cranberries, once with chocolate chips. Every time I've used plain yogurt (recently I used lebaneh) instead of buttermilk- it turns out fine. Some hints: 1. make sure to NOT overmix your flour- in fact, once I add the dry ingredients i stop using an electric mixer altogether and mix the batter with a wooden spoon until just incorporated- if you mix it too much it becomes rubbery. 2.There is no need to sift all the dry ingredients- i've made it both with that extra step and without and it makes no difference. 3.I always use more bananas then it says, and I don't mash them to a pulp- some nice pockets of moist banana in the bread is a delicious hidden treasure. 4.Although my oven does run hot, I've never baked it more than half hour. 5.Also, as previous reviewers noted, adding cinnamon and nutmeg gives it some extra spice and a delicious aroma.

The key is the beating of the eggs and sugar to keep the batter light. The bananas add the substance.

I've made this 3x now, in loaf, mini-loaf and muffins. Definitely don't make this unless you have bananas that are so ripe they're almost too yucky to touch. The first time I made this my bananas were black but still firm on the inside and I was disappointed. Next time I was patient and waited for really mushy bananas and the result was very good. Not the most decadent banana bread, but adding just a little chocolate will make you forget all about low-fat. I also added 1 T. melted butter for the flavor. Still lowfat enough for me and delicious!!

I've made this about six times, and I really like it. However, it definitely needs some cinnamon. I don't mash the bananas too well; slight chunks give you nice gooey pockets of banana in the finished loaf.I think I am going to up the bananas to four next time. I can't get buttermilk here, so I sour milk with a squirt of lemon juice, and it works fine. The recipe is very forgiving; I play around with sugar levels, and whole wheat flour, and it's just as yummy. Try taking it out of the oven after forty minutes for a moister loaf. Whilst this counteracts the low-fat part, a chopped bar of dark chocolate folded in at the end makes a worthy addition.

Always looking for low fat alternatives. This one is a winner. On a whim, I added a handful of pecans, craisins, and raisins. Changed the vanilla to 2 tsp + 1 tsp almond extract and added twice the bananas. Easily ranks up there with the full fat versions. I think the extra banana added the density it needed.

I'm not doing to rate this recipe just yet. We amde it with yogurt instead of buttermilk, and made it into muffins. It didn't impress me as muffins because they came out too dry. I found this recipe too sweet and lacking flavor. I might make it again for my 3 year old's endless tea party play since it is low fat and I can also make it sugarless by using splenda.

This banana bread is fantastic!! I made it for my husband (ordinarily I don't like banana bread) and I can't stop eating it. I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk and it is light and fluffy and delicious. Oh, also only whipped the eggs for a minute or so with a wisk - no problems at all. I'm making this again as soon as I have some ripe bananas!

Tasty AND low-fat, can't ask for much more than this. This has been my default banana bread recipe for a long time, a family favorite. When we're in a decadent mood, I reserve about 1/4 of the batter, fold in some cocoa (1/3 of a cup or so), and gently fold the chocolatey batter into the mix without incorporating it fully. Tadaaa! Choco-banana marble cake.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and was surprised how tasty this recipe was! I would definitely make it again.

This is a great recipie. It has a lighter texture compared to a full fat recipie. I added an extra banana, and next time will probably add even more to see if i can achieve a denser bread. The taste was great, and honestly i couldn't tell that it was low fat either. I added the full tablespoon of vanilla and noticed a bit of an alcohol/perfume taste, obviously i need to try a higher quality vanilla. I am usually skeptical of low-fat desserts as well, because I generally think you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Although by no means low calorie, this is a much healthier alternative to the regular version. I added a bit of cinnamon, and substituted brown sugar for the white. Also didn't have buttermilk, so i used yogurt and low fat milk instead. A really good recipie, and like all banana bread recipies, you have to use overly-ripe bananas. That may have been the problem with reviewers before who claimed it had no taste.

Very moist and flavorful. Easy to prepare. Next time, I will add some nuts or chocolate chips.

I am working on losing my last 10 pounds after having twin boys, so I have been trying all kinds of reduced calorie recipes. This one is VERY good. I used 75% splenda and 25% real sugar to cut calories and then threw in a handful of chocolate chips for fun. The bread turned out very moist with a nice crust on top. Next time I will try it with 100% splenda.

I make this all the time (well, with changes....) 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup of spelt flour, 1/4 cup wheat bran. Instead of milk, used 1/2 cup fat free yogurt, cinnamon. Less sugar, lots of bananas... yummy and VERY moist. The yogurt is the way to go....

Rating: 4
Always a hit! The last time I made this recipe I used a mini loaf pan and I found I had to reduce the cooking time - 50 minutes should be plenty for 8 mini loaves. Always use bananas that are so ripe that they are 75 per cent black. They give the absolute best flavour and the mushy texture of the overly ripe banana makes it easy to mash!

this isn't bad for one tablespoon of oil! i have made the written recipe and it was ok, but i prefer my version a bit more. i use some honey along with the brown sugar and cut the amounts down a bit, add chopped dates or cranberried, lemon zest, and some lemon juice to the mashed bananas before adding to the mixture. i also use some w.wh. flour and some w.wh. pastry flour for personal taste, and occasionally sprinkle a handful of wheat bran or oats depending on how wet the batter is... but the honey, dates, cranberries and lemon zest are a good combo.

it was very easy to make, since i didn't have buttermilk i used fat-free skim milk which worked out perfectly.

This is a great, easy banana bread! I threw in a few pieces of old fried plantain, subbed brown sugar and threw in walnuts (hey, they're good for you). Also made fake buttermilk with lemon juice and milk up to 1/3 cup. Took a little longer than an hour to bake (my bananas were really runny), but the boyfriend loves it despite the low fat! Try it! This is great!

I did a little experiment with this recipe and used the recommended 1 cup of bananas instead of the usual 3 medium mashed bananas that I usually use and it was much drier than usual. Definitely stick to the 3 bananas! I also added chocolate chips, defeating the low-fatness of this recipe.

Rating: 4
The world needs more recipes like this. EASY to make (love one-bowl recipes!), but it definitely delivers in terms of taste and texture. I recommend this recipe as a family staple. One tip: rather than greasing the pan, I lined it with parchment paper, which peeled off easily once the loaf cooled.

Fabulous....made buttermilk by placing 1 Tbs. of fresh lemon juice in a cup and adding 1% milk until it measured 1 cup, then just mix it and let it sit for a few minutes. (since the recipe calls for only 1/3 cup buttermilk, I should have tried the 1/3 TBS with milk measuring to 1/3 cup) 1 hour at 325 was perfect. The bread was moist and was devoured by my husband and two children. I'd never make the high fat version again.

It was very moist and delicious! I actually had to use egg product from a carton. I also had to make my own buttermilk...1/3 TBS of lemon juice and enough milk to yield 1/3 cup. I don't know if that was right, but it seemed to work! Everyone loved it, because it wasn't dry!

I've made this recipe at least 15 times over the years. Always excellent. I substitute brown sugar for the white sugar as it imparts a marvelous flavor. I also add 1 cup of chopped walnuts. One loaf = 12 slices. About 224 Calories per serving.

Scrumptious. If you love moist, very banana flavored bread this is the way to go. I don't favor nuts and crunch in my banana bread. Husband and I both think it's the best banana bread we've yet tried. And don't agree with reviewer who said to bake for only 50 minutes. Follow the recipe.

I have made this many times, I brought a loaf to work and it was INHALED, although everyone was sceptical that it was low fat. I had to make a dozen copies of the recipe and hand them out. Months later people still come up and say they are making it for their family and everyone loves it! I made no changes to the recipe, I found if I have extra buttermilk I go through the recipe search and find many recipes to use it up in pancakes, muffins, etc. I also usually double the recipe and bake several batches at once as it freezes beautifully and I like to keep it on hand for sunday breakfast or company. Since my original review I have made it numerous times. I now have to cut sugar from my diet due to health reasons, but can have fruit such as bananas, so I have substituted Splenda sugar substitute vey successfully several times for the sugar in the recipe.

I have made banana bread for many years, and I decided to try a different recipe. This one is not as good as the one I have been using (from the Los Angeles Times Cookbook). It is drier and blander. I would up the sugar and bananas in this recipe to give it more flavor. Kind of disappointed.

This is a fantastic and incredibly easy recipe. Great flavor and low-fat? How can you go wrong? Adding fresh berries is a nice touch too. I only wish the recipe called for cinnamon and/or nutmeg... two tasty flavor additions, but I wasn't sure how much to add without overpowering the recipe. Thoughts?

I found this recipe to be very good. I made a few changes. I used egg substitute (Nu-Laid) in place of the eggs and since I do not keep buttermilk in the house, I used the buttermilk powder. I replaced some of the sugar with brown sugar thus the more intense sweet flavour required less total overall sugar. I then added some wheat bran and chopped walnuts and some dried cranberries. This increased the nutritional value including the valuable Omega oils in the walnuts and fibre in the bran.

used light sour cream instead of buttermilk and 1 TB of Smuckers oil replacement (an absolutely awesome product for low fat cooking!) used cooking spray instead of butter to grease pan and the results were so yummy and moist and sweet. 3/4 cup sugar was plenty!! also, you are only beating the eggs and sugar w/ the mixer, after that, do it all gently by hand, takes less than a minute to combine wet and dry, more than that and it is overmixed.

This was a very good basic banana bread recipe. Very easy to make. When I made it the first time, it was slightly rubber-ey which might have been my fault due to overmixing. 5 minutes in an electric mixer seemed a little long.

I was not impressed with this banana bread recipe at all. It didn't have much banana flavor, and the texture was rubbery -- and believe me, I'm careful about avoiding overmixing. It was moist, but not in the right way. I will stick to the banana bread recipe in Fannie Farmer's Baking Book for now.

It does have a spongy texture - but we still really liked it. I made it a second time & accidentally fixed the texture problem. I was out of eggs & only had 1.

I have been making this bread for a while and it is quite good. It does get spongy/rubbery if you do not sift the dry ingedients or if you overmix after adding them. If you follow the recipe and sift the dry ingredients and then stir only until blended it will turn out great.

Like the cook from Maine, I too thought the texture was spongy. Sure it's low fat, but it sure tasted like it. I even added some grated lemon rind for flavor. On the plus side, it looked beautiful and sliced nicely. I think I'll keep looking for a better recipe though.

INCREDIBLE!! This recipe makes me rethink fat's purpose in cooking! I have NEVER tasted a low fat recipe this moist and delicious and so close to the regular full fat version (and I bake extensively). Yes, I did alter just a tad by adding a few toasted walnuts but it would still be incredible without them. Also threw in an additional banana. WW members: a whole loaf as the recipe as written came out to 40 points by my calculation. For those wanting just a great banana bread recipe not concerned about the fat, this is a great base and could be elevated with the addition of coconut, macamadias and/or chocolate chips.

I made a HUGE mistake with this recipe and it still came out great. Instead of the 2 TEASPOONS of baking powder, I wasn't paying attention and put in 2 TABLESPOONS. I knew something wasn't right with that amount but I kept on going anyway! Then as I was putting the bread in the oven, it hit me. OH NO!!!! The only thing I could do was hope for the best. After an hour I took out the bread and prepared for the worst. Well even after my blunder the "bread" was not only edible but was pretty tasty. I suggest adding extra banana's and making sure they're VERY RIPE. I also added some chocolate chip which were a nice addition.

Wow, this is a fantastic low-fat recipe. I substituted 1/3 cup of the flour with a mixture of wheat germ and ground flax seed (for a little health kick) and added some chopped dates.

I can't even tell this is lowfat. It's a very decent banana bread. I did cheat and add some pecans to the batter. Best advice here is to not overmix in the flour at the end. Using a soft wheat flour like White Lily helps. My bread loaf came out light, sweet and moist with lots of banana flavor.

My husband and I thought this was one of the best banana breads I've ever made! I used extremely ripe bananas, added lots of chopped walnuts, and a sprinkling of freshly ground nutmeg. I think next time I'll add some fresh blueberries. A handful of toasted coconut would be a great addition as well. We certainly didn't miss the one cup of butter my other banana bread recipe calls for. The bread was dense, but tender, and certainly not at all gummy. Perhaps people experiencing "gumminess" should check their oven temperature and make sure their ingredients are measured accurately. This will become a family favorit, and it's "heart healthy," too!

I gave this 4 forks because I made a huge error and the bread came out amazing! My daughter was sick and decided that the only way she was going to nap was to sleep on me but I had 18 minutes left on the timer. I turned off the oven and just left the bread in there thinking that it would just be ruined. 4 hours later I took it out and figured it would be a brick or gloppy mess. I couldn't believe what I found. A very moist and perfectly done bread that tasted wonderful. I added 4 bananas, 1/2 Tbsp vanilla (instead of 1 Tbsp) and 1 -2 Tbsp of brown sugar. It couldn't have been better. It was not heavy or sticky like others have said. I don't know if I would recommend that you bake it the way I did but it certainly worked for me!

I have followed every step of the recipe except for adding one extra banana (as suggested by many other reviewers), but my banana bread came out way too sticky.

I agree with many of the positives of other reviewers and I found the combination of taste and low-fat to be attractive enough to experiment. I have now settled with a recipe that I make continually: Reduce the vanilla to 1 t, add 1 t cinnamon, and 1/2 t each of ginger and nutmeg. Increase the banana to 1 2/3 c mashed (about 5 medium) - this is, I think, the best answer to getting more flavor. Keep the sugar at 3/4 c, but split between granulated and golden brown. Do the same with flour (all purpose and whole wheat). Substitute regular fat sour cream for the buttermilk - makes a significant difference in texture and richness without a lot of calories (only about 150). I vary fruit (e.g., figs, dates, raisins) and nuts (e.g., pecans, walnuts). For high altitude, reduce soda & powder and cook for 1 1/4 hrs. Excellent!

For a low fat recipe this is terrific. I added raisins and thought that a good addition.

This is amazing banana bread, especially given it's low fat. (I like it as much as my mom's high fat version.) I think the key is to use really, really ripe bananas. Mine were practically black. I used low fat 1% buttermilk and a little cinnamon and nutmeg per the suggestions. My husband and I almost ate the whole loaf in one sitting the first time we made it.

For low-fat, it was ok, but for banana bread there are better recipes. It didn't have enough banana flavor for me (a TABLESPOON of vanilla??) and the texture was sort of rubbery. Not bad, just not great.

For a LOW-FAT quick bread, it was extremely moist and light. I noticed it tasted a little salty; not sure if this was my measuring or because I substituted low-fat milk and vinegar for the buttermilk. Regardless, I will try it again..maybe with some dried fruit or chocolate chips. I'm calling this a "keeper."

I love that this recipe doesn't call for cups of butter, cream, or shortening. I like to make it with less sugar than it calls for, but then I also add chocolate chips! I also like to sustitute whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour. A great snack before a work-out, and my boyfriend loves it!

The first recipie I found that didn't produce a banana brick, it was wonderful. Whipping the eggs and the sugar for the full 5 minutes at the beginning I think made a huge difference. I substituted the nuts with dried cranberries and dried nectarines and used a little less sugar, it was delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe with a great result. Low-fat foods are so much tastier when made at home! I've made this several times always with 1.5 % milkfat buttermilk and walnuts. The last time I doubled the recipe and used 7 bananas which gave the bread a more intense flavor and moistness.

Rating: 3
My kids loved this! It didn't taste low fat at all. I followed some of the suggestions, used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, and added cinnamon. I thought it was very moist. I am going to make it again soon as the bananas are over ripe again!

This is pretty awesome banana bread - nothing fancy - just what you except from a banana bread when you have bunch of aging banana's - I especially liked to buttermilk component - (I used 2% milk with some white viegar - worked just fine!)This is a keeper and I will most definately make this again and again!

I also used an extra banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. each of ginger and nutmeg and a handfull of chopped pecans. I hand stirred the dry ingedients into wet, so not to overmix. It came out moist and flavorful but could honestly do with more spice and maybe vanilla. Very good basic recipe that needs "doctoring up"

Great ! Though I hope I will not get a reprimand here (as is becoming too common on this site) for rating a recipe I altered a bit -- I followed advice of others who commented and used half white and half brown sugar and added an extra banana. I also mixed white flour with 3 tbls. of soy flour and added mini chocolate chips. Usually everyone's banana bread tastes the same - this one is refreshingly moist and flavorful.

Four forks for low fat and ease of prep; three for taste. Less banana-y than I'm used to. Wish I'd added an extra banana and either chocolate chips or nuts.

Oh, boy! Scrumptious! After reading other reviews, changed the following: used 1/2cup white and 1/4c dark brown sugars; used reduced fat sour cream for the buttermilk; added 1 tsp cinnamon, chopped walnuts, and the remainder of a dark choc. Easter bunny - chopped (had no chips). Also greased pan (with Pam), used parchment paper, then more Pam. My pan was 9 1/2 x 5 1/2. At 325, took 50 minutes.

This was an overall very good low-fat recipe. Came out very moist and light. I was careful not to overmix the batter, and also added chopped pecans and chocolate chips, which made it even better (but no longer low-fat). Didn't feel one bit guilty about having a second slice of this bread because it's less fattening than my original recipe which is made with the real thing----butter!

Outstanding!!! Always gets rave reviews from family and friends!

Rating: 2
I can see how this banana bread could turn out rubbery -- I was careful not to overmix it, and luckily it turned out pretty moist. But it did have a hint of rubbery texture. I folded the bananas into the mix at the very end, added cinnamon, and only baked for 50 mins. As far as lowfat banana breads go, this is ok and will probably make again if I want something lowfat. But the best (full fat) banana bread recipe I've ever come across is in the Joy of Cooking cookbook.

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe for quite awhile. It is a major hit. Some important tips 1) DO NOT OVERMIX. It will be rubbery. 2) 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. 3)Changed sugar to 1/2 sugar & 1/4 brown sugar 4) Used 1TBL butter instead of oil ( creamed it with the sugars). 5) used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (put in the dry ingredients).

Not great. This recipe needed more flavor-- maybe more banana, more vanilla- something. A little rubbery but the main thing is that it needed more flavor.

This was a tasty banana bread. Smelled heavenly when baking. Puts those very-ripe bananas to good use. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/4 tsp cinnamon. The bread came out perfect & very moist, people were fooled that it was low-fat. I would definately make this recipe again.

I read ALL of the rave reviews last night because I couldn't sleep. Made it this morning after the gym. My sister came over after Pilates and we just finished - make that inhaled - our first slices. So good! And she didn't believe it was low-fat! Or lower fat since I did add 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Also used non-fat milk and butter instead of buttermilk and oil. And beat by hand because I don't have an electric mixer - got a good muscle burn! Beautiful. Crisp crust. Perfect density and texture. Wonderful banana aroma and flavour. I love butter but this is just as good - my sister says better - than our old favourite recipe that uses a whole stick!

The low-fat aspect of this recipe looked great, but otherwise it sounded kind of bland, so I made a few changes to jazz up the flavor. I used two-thirds brown sugar and one-third white, whole-wheat pastry flour, added some cinnamon, and folded in a cup of choppecd fresh cranberries. The flavor balance was excellent. I thought the texture much improved the day after I baked it. Also, it keeps really well, staying moist for days. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
Very good! I doubled this recipe using 8 bananas, all whole wheat flour, and skim milk. Needed about 1 hour 15 minutes to bake. Very moist and flavorful on the inside but the crust is a little thick for my taste. Next time I am going to try 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.

Rating: 2
This recipe wasn't bad for a low-fat recipe, but I wasn't as impressed with it as much as some of the previous reviewers. Unfortunately, I misread the recipe and put in 3 eggs instead of 2, so I sort added more of everything to the recipe. I don't think I added enough sugar, I think it could have been sweeter. It still turned out well. My 6 yr. old loved it, and for that reason alone, I'll make it again. I did have to bake it a lot longer than an hour, more like an hour and a half.

I never make low-fat desserts, but I had to try this. It turned out delicious and although it's not quite as good as a banana bread made only with oil, it's definitely worth making again (and I won't feel so guilty eating it!).

I have been making this recipe since it was published in 1997 and I guess I have made it about 50 times. I take my buttermilk and freeze it in 1/3 cup portions just so it's always on hand for this recipe. I have tried to lower the fat content even more, (egg whites, applesauce, etc), but it wasn't worth it. This is by far the best banana bread recipe I have ever made...low fat or otherwise

I have made this recipe three times now and have yet to do it with buttermilk. The first 2 times I did it with 1/3 c of cream of coconut instead of buttermilk and today it is in the oven using "lighter bake". I also use rum in conjunction with the vanilla and throw in some shredded coconut and or nuts if they are in the pantry. Gets raves from even my chocoholic husband. Enjoy everyone!!!

FYI, there is a great recipe for Banana Bread in the Fanny Farmer Cookbook. It contains no oil or butter and uses only simple pantry ingredients. I make it regularly with pecans or walnuts, using whole wheat flour and sucanat in place of the sugar, adding fun things like cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla and sometimes maple syrup. It's moist and dark -- as banana bread should be. Try it if you get the chance -- it's a great basic banana bread. Based on the rave reviews, I'll be sure to try this recipe the next time I have overripe bananas and buttermilk on hand. Cheers!

This bread had great taste without the guilt. It was very moist but a bit sweet. I exchanged 3/4 of a cup of the flour with whole wheat and added some pecans. Next time I'd cut back just a bit on the sugar and maybe add a sprinkle of wheat germ. It is sure to please.

One word...AWESOME! I'm the ultimate banana bread fan, I've tried endless recipes...and this one tops the charts. Plus, it's low fat (the best of both worlds)! I've made it 3 times in two weeks and everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it. It's now the staple of my recipe file. Oh, I also needed to add 10 min. to the cook time.

Rating: 4
This bread was delicious. I made a few modifications: I used 2 Tb of butter (instead of 1 Tb of oil) and creamed it with the sugar before adding the eggs, one at a time. I also threw in a very few chocolate chips. In an effort to use up the 120 bananas that our trees just produced I doubled the amount of banana in the recipe. The bread needed about 10 extra minutes of baking, like the other reviewers said. The result was a definite keeper - moist, flavorful, and good for you. Who needs the 1 stick of butter banana breads when one can have this.

If you have many bananas piling up in your freezer you should try this recipe. It went over really well hit with my husband and friends.

The number of over-ripe bananas had been adding up in my freezer and this looked liked a perfect recipe for them! This recipe turned out really well. I made a double recipe of batter with 9 small to med bananas instead of 6 based on other commments. I also added 1 tbsp of vanilla and 1 tbsp of maple extract. This is the secret ingredient in my zucchini muffins and it was fantastic with the bananas! To one loaf I added some blueberries (can never go wrong with blueberries & bananas together). I added some chocolate chips to the other one. I also added a dash of cinnamon as suggested. Both of these loafs turned out fantastic - Moist and flavorful. Again, I attribute the flavour to the maple extract. As other people commented, the loafs took longer than 1 hour. They needed an extra 10 minutes. This was a great way to use "freezer bananas"!

I've only ever made banana bread from a box, so I wasn't sure how one from scratch would turn out. I thought is was really good, except a little dry.

I did find that I had to cook it a little longer than stated but that could very well be oven temperature variances. It will become an "over and over again" recipe for our family.

And I used whole wheat flour instead of white.... The riper the bananas the better!!!! Also added about 1/2 c. coconut. The bread didn't last us 24 hours. TRY IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT!!

Very tasty for a low fat loaf. If you are on Weight Watchers, cut the loaf into 10 slices (about 1/2" each) and each slice is 4 points. (My calculation) Pretty reasonable point count for a homemade cake!

This is our favorite banana bread recipe! Very moist but not sticky or too sweet.

Delish!! I doubled the recipe, because one loaf doesn't last long! Great with almond butter.

We liked this so much I made it twice in a week. I added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts. Blows the low-fat angle, but it's great.

My ten month old baby loved it!

This is the best bana bread recipe low-fat or otherwise. If you don't have any buttermilk then sour cream will work just as well. I haven't tried freezing it because there is never any left to freze.

This is the only banana bread recipe I use now. I often substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour for a wonderfully rich taste. I have been asked by nearly everyone that tries it for a copy of the recipe!

One of the better banana bread recipes I've tried!! I added walnuts to it and it was terrific. I would cut out the salt, though, next time.

I have substituted 1/3 cup of applesauce (with or without cinammon) for the buttermilk (which I never have) - Delicious!

The rate would be Three forks: Delicious. Someone even suggesting to top it of with whipped cream. The bread is very moist, and the texture light and airy, not dense/heavy like most banana breads. If you don't like the moisture, toast a slice for breakfast. It's still delicious.

Very moist for so little fat. I add some chopped walnuts....
