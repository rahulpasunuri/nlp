This is probably the worst dish I have ever made in my long life of cooking. The dish tastes sour--there is nothing to cut the lemon juice in the sauce and the whole thing looks so unappealing, like a dog's breakfast. What a waste of beef and other ingredients. The fava beans are not the fault here, they could be good, but the fricassée is just disgusting.

I felt that this was a waste of good beef and good fava beans. The flavors didn't combine well, the beef came out tough, and the favas were lost in all that egg and cream.

This dish was amazingly rich and delicious. I would serve it for guests again.

I didn't think there was too much lemon. It goes great with the beef and mint. My major problem is that the sauce a bit too heavy, so I would cut down on the cream next time. As an added bonus, I used half the fava beans and added eggplant. Delicious!

Absolutely the worst dish I've made in 24 years of marriage. The lemon juice overwhelmed the entire dish. None of the flavors melded - truly a waste of good ingredients!

This was incredible! My husband had thrid helpings. I used fresh fava beans, a bit of prep, but worth the time. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I may do next time is cut the lemon juice just a bit, it was a bit strong, but the flavors worked so well together, and don't leave out the mint. I almost did, but it really makes the dish.

OH MY YUM..... We have a place in Bear Valley, California and all of our entire family and friends love this dish. I usually double the sauce. I only have used fresh Fava beans. I serve with Orzo lighly tossed with pesto.

We though the flavors worked; we would make two modifications. The menu suggested crusty bread to "...mop up the sauce." there was no sauce to mop up! If I made this again I would add a broth to the cream/egg mixture to lighten it up, and add some juice. Secondly, we thought it was a bit heavily salted. One teaspoon would have been enough.

blah. the combination has nothing to offer. i used frozen lima beans and they were gross. they needed an overly rich sauce to cover their sins, but the end result was not worth 10 minutes of prep time.

This was good--how could it not be with tenderloin and fava beans?--but we all agreed we'd probably enjoy them more separately. Fresh beans in pod required an incredible amount of prep. Fortunately, my daughter helped. The author starts by saying there are times you can't imagine adorning a fresh fava with anything but sea salt, and I'd agree with that.

I substituted half and half for the heavy cream the second and third time I made it (can you tell we really liked this?!) and tasted no difference. The blend of fresh fava beans, onions and really good beef is really fabulous! I have also made the onion/fava bean mixture and served it with pan-seared Haddock on top- lovely flavors as well!

I used frozen lima beans and this dish was delicious. The lemon flavor gave the right kick to the beans and beef. I'm love this easy, you already have everything in your pantry, everyday, healthy meal!
