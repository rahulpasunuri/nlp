I just used the recipe for the blueberry sauce. Fast, easy, pretty, and good-tasting. I poured the blueberry sauce over over chocolate pound cake and vanilla ice cream. It was a great combination. The sauce keeps for a long time, and it dresses up plain ice cream or cake very well.

Easy and fun -- the sauces were very good.
