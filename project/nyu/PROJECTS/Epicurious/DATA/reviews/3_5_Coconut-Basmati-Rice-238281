I really like how this rice turned out except it did not taste of enough coconut. I would use all coconut milk next time and a tad more sugar, but it was fluffy and perfect. I will make it again. The rinsing thoroughly of the rice made a big difference.

I've made this several times, and is my go-to coconut rice recipe. I usually halve the recipe (I mostly cook for two) and swap the quantities of water and coconut milk so it's a little more "coconutty". I don't think it needs the change, but I do like it.

The next time I make this, I would add more brown sugar. The coconut flavor was nice and subtle, but could have been a little sweeter. I also added some kidney beans and pieces of chopped red peppar. This recipe was surprisingly easy and quick.

Best coconut rice ever. Followed the directions to a "T" and the rice turned out fluffy and cooked to perfection. This was a "dry run" for a dinner party and it made the menu. Can't wait to share this with fellow foodies!

Delicious--although I did substitute and make a few changes. I used brown basmati--and I halved the recipe because 2 cups is too much for me! Used equal parts water and light coconut milk, I had to adjust the cooking time to about 45 minutes. Super delicious--will be taking for lunch tomorrow along with miso glazed salmon.

This was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, using organic coconut milk (less bitter than conventional). Served with tandoori chicken and the cumin roasted carrots from this site, along with a zucchini dish I wouldn't recommend. It'll be a cucumber salad next time.

I made this tonight for guests and served it with Soy-Sake shrimp to guests, one of whom doesn't eat much, and eats slowly. He ate slowly, but ate nearly every grain of rice. As did we, he thought it was fantastic, its lovely flavor enhanced by the Ginger aioli served with Soy-Sake Shrimp. Not having any basmati and only one cup of long grain, I used jasmine for the second cup. Cooking the rice exactly as the recipe said, it turned out beautifully. If a previous reviewer got crispy rice on the bottom, she must have had the heat too high and didn't check it while it cooked. This is most definitely a keeper. Yum!

Light and fresh tasting, a must with thai chicken breasts on the grill. Made it exactly as is...perfect rice!

We are not coconut rice experts... but I will now become one. This was fabulous, especially with the pineapple-chicken. We will definitely use this again.

I've made this rice several times using light coconut milk as a side dish for skewered sweet and sour pork and pineapple. Delicious.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this dish! The flavor was sweet but not overpowering and the texture was great. One user commented on the fact that the rice at the bottom of the pot gets crispy, and this is true, but I've tasted a number of ethnic rice dishes prepared that way on purpose and I think the style fits well with this recipe. Stir up the browned bits on the bottom into the rest of the rice with the toasted coconut for a great combination of textures and flavors! I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Have made a "version" of this several times. Gave 3 forks more for the reviews and feedback -thanks. Main changes: skipped the sugar and flakes and used light coconut milk. Preped the rice by rinsing not soaking.

Great recipe, and a wonderful change for white rice. I made it twice, once with grilled tuna and the other time with an eggplant curry. Family loved it both times.

This is a good basic sweet rice recipe. I served it with southeast asian style grilled sirloin kebabs, and sprinkled with fresh cilantro. It would also be delicious with additions such as raisins, or toasted slivered almonds.

Lovely. I love coconut and it was enjoyable to have it in a different form than a desert. I used normal long grain rice instead of basmati. I would just cook the rice normally (bring liquids to a boil and then cover and cook) because this method produced very crispy rice on the bottom of the pan.

Really creamy and great flavor...almost dessert like, but went really well with a spicy curry.

I made this as a side for the chicken recipe with which it was printed. It was fluffy and had a subtle coconut flavor, however, I did use lite coconut milk, which I am sure made a big difference. We found both recipes to be agreeable.

My family thought the rice dish tasted like soap and had a heavy, thick consistency. The pineapple chicken was delicious, so we were quite disappointed with the side dish. Next time - plain rice.
