I was down in SFO last week and ate at Le Mar a cebicheria Puruana. I had some beutiful shrimp and scallop causas made with purple potatoes. Very delicious, nice texture and very striking presentation. So if you are worried about the gold thing, try those, they are available all over these days.

Until BA can print a deent recipe for Causa Limena, I recommend you Goggle the recipe.Aji Amarillo is sold in every Latin American market. Use Yukon Gold potatoes. NO CELERY Please! chicken should be mixed with chopped red onions and mayonnaise. Tuna fish is the traditional filling but you can use chicken or shrimp. Ans by the way, you MUST use lime juice in the mashed potatoes. If done correctly, this is a delicious recipe that can even be presented as a first course.

I did not follow this recipe, but this is one of the best appetizers you can serve. The cook for somewhre who used sardines--PLEASE! the tradional is with tuna and it is delicious. Chicken ans shrimps are great too! Skip the celery. Agree with other cook-use MUST us lime in your potatoes. AND you don't have to go to Lima to get the potatoes. Use Yukon GOLD! This is a lovely first entre if you use a cylinder mold to layer the recipe. Bon Appetit should get a better recipe...

Maybe this is the old-fashioned way, but to the mashed potato I always add onion which has first been chopped finely, rinsed with hot & then cold water in a colander, then put to soak for an hour in the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, and some yellow aji (either fresh or from a jar). This gives the potatoes some flavor, I think. In the center I use peeled, deveined jumbo shrimp or avocados. It makes a lovely presentation and is delicious.

I used russet potatoes and chipotle chili powder. In this area russets are very dry and yukon gold are creamy. To the cook in LA - 1 cup of fish is called for - not 1 pound.

I used sardines, since it was listed as a substitute for the chicken. It was hideous. I don't imagine tuna would be better, though I could see smoked salmon working here. Even though the recipe advises using the same proportions on substitutions, using 1 lb of any fish overpowers the potatoes. I do advise making extra potatoes, as the potato layers were thin. I have had this dish before, and know its potential, so I may try this with the chicken.

This is NOT the causa I've eaten in anyone's home or restaurant in Lima or elsewhere...a true causa can only be made with a papa amarilla, a dry and vivid yellow (envision canary yellow) potato only grown in the Andes, at best we can substitute the Idaho. For approximately two pounds, mash with 1/4 c key lime or mexican lemon (substitute lime), 1/4 c regular oil, 2 Tbs. aji amarillo and salt to taste. Stuff with tuna fish prepared with lime juice, red onion and more of the aji amarillo. That's the classic recipe...the classic presentation, serve on a bed of green lettuce, with salsa criolla, a roll of corn and a sliced hard boiled egg and a kalamata or two. Enjoy with a cold cerveza.
