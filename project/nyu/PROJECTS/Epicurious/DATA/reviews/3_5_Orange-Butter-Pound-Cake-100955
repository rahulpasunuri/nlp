This cake was wonderful! The only thing I would add is more orange zest. Liked by kids and adults. The cake is very filling and goes a long way so I cut it up in chunks and froze it and it lasted me for months. Toast it and make a "pound cake sandwich" with some semisweet chocolate chips in the middle!

This was the 2nd cake I had ever baked and I love this recipe. The recipe is easy to follow, My wife bought a case of oranges from a school fund raiser. I used 4 oranges that I placed in my Vita Mix blender along with about 1/2 cup of water and 1 tablespoons of sugar. I used 2 tablespoons of this blended juice instead of ornage juice. The remaining orange blend I used to make an ornage sauce to dribble over cut slices of cake. Hit me up if interested in the orange sauce recipe.

I made this receipe in 2000 for my aunt, she mentioned it earlier this year while I was visiting her in PR. She is coming to visit me again tomorrow, I will make it as her birthday cake. Very yummy and easy!

Absolutely awful. Way too eggy and heavy with butter. I was really shocked at how lousy it was.

I adapted this recipe to make cupcakes (much easier to bring to work or eat on the run). I added 1 tsp of baking powder and subsituted the zest for orange oil (William Sonoma). It made 12 delicious cupcakes!

I was looking for an Amaretto pound cake recipe, but couldn't find one so I adapted this one. I substituted 3T Amaretto for the orange juice and peel and added a simple Amaretto and confectioner's sugar glaze. Yummy. The cake was gone in less than 24 hours.

This was very disappointing - I think I expected a little more of a punch from the orange; it was kind of flat (taste-wise). I think I'll stick with "Aunt Rose's Pound Cake." That's one of the best pound cake recipes I've come across, and it can be adapted with different flavorings; I'll do an orange version of that next time.

This pound cake is not as heavy as a traditional pound cake. However it is just as delicious. The orange zest gave it a nice twist.

I have made this cake too many times to keep track. I recently moved and haven't located my box with my old Bon Appetit recipes, so I was looking for this recipe online. I'm so happy I found it. I promised to make it this weekend for a family gathering. I previously made it in a spring form pan with a bundt type insert. It always turned out great! I am going to try it this time with baking powder and soda as someone else suggested. Thank you.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out very dense and not light and fluffy. The taste was appealing but the texture was not. Maybe it needs baking powder and/or soda. Overall a dissapointment it's still sitting on the counter almost untouched!

I made this cake by adding 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda to the recipe. The cake rose very well and was light. It is a delicious cake and I am sure I'll be making it regularly.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for and everytime I want a pound cake this is gonna be it. I like to use cake flour instead, because it adds a little extra rise to it.

This pound cake has become our standard. It's very easy to substitute, thereby completely changing the taste of the recipe. The texture reminds me of my Grandmother's pound cakes...back when they were made with a pound of butter, pound of sugar, pound of flour, etc.

From my experience (I have made this three times), a loaf pan works better. Both times I have attempted to make it in a bundt pan the bottom has burned before it has finished cooking. Turning the oven down did not seem to help. If you can get past the burning the texture and flavor are great.

Phenominal! I bought orange pound cake at the store once (and hated it, but my family loved it). I couldn't find it again to save my life. I got onto the internet and searched and found this recipe. I must say.....This version of orange pound cake was fabulous!!!!

I made two of these cakes for a birthday party. I substituted lemon/lime juice and rind in the second cake. Everyone raved.

Easy - dense but very appealing texture with great flavor

This is a lovely cake with a fine, dense texture. As easy and quick to whip up as this cake is, it's definitely a keeper! The recipe iw great as written, but it is truly beyond compare as a lemon-poppyseed cake. I substituted equal amounts of lemon rind and juice for the orange rind and juice, and replaced about 1/2 of the vanilla extract with lemon extract, added 1/3 cup poppy seed, and drizzled a lemon juice-powdered sugar glaze over. Served it in small pieces (16 to the cake) with a raspberry sauce on the side; and got rave review from all.

This was an excellent variation of plain pound cake. It was light and tasty enough to be served by itself.

Very dense cake, but with a great texture. Very quick to make, and appreciated by kids and adults.

A beautiful and tasty cake! Not too heavy for a pound cake, but definitely rich. It didn't last long enough to test the suggesting about toasting it for breakfast, but I'm sure it would be marvelous.
