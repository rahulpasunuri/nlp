Outstanding and very easy to make. However, far too spicy with 1 tsp. of pepper flakes. Next time I will start with 1/4 tsp. and add to taste.

This recipe was a hit! I added mussels and omitted the crabs. I also added, in addition to the oregano, a teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning, which really added a lot more flavor. I did make the base the day before and that helped set the flavors. I will definitely make this again!

I have made this three times. It's easy to do and always tastes amazing. The following changes were made: 1) I lightly coated the snapper chunks with flour and sauteed them first in the olive oil and set them aside. I added them at the end with the parsley and basil, otherwise the fish just dissolves. 2) I use vinho verde - it gives the broth a lighter more fragrant flavor 3) I ditched the green bell pepper and used 3 or 4 small finely chopped serrano chiles (seeded). This gives the broth a teensy kick which even the "heat averse" can appreciate. This dish is well worth the (minimal) effort and (modest) cost. Enjoy!

didn't work. next time, would use white wine or a light red.

Here are the changes I made, on the suggestions of other reviewers: 1. Used only one onion but added two finely chopped shallots and one finely chopped bulb of fennel. 2. Reduced the pepper flakes to 1/4-1/2 tsp and passed additional pepper flakes at the table for those who like this spicier. 3. Subbed white wine (pinot grigio) for the red. 4. Used a yellow bell pepper in place of the green. 5. Used the following seafood: mahi mahi, clams, mussels, shrimp. Oh, and I just threw those in in the following order, to cook over about 8-10 minutes: clams, mussels, fish, shrimp. Worked out great, no need to remove the shellfish before proceeding with the rest. While we didn't use crab which means I didn't technically make cioppino, this was delicious and I would make it again in a second! The friends I cooked for raved. We are in a gluten-free house so served it over rice with some homemade GF focaccia on the side to soak up the juices. The bread on the side to soak up the juices is necessary! Don't skip it!

This is a great recipe. Like others, I also prefer to substitute white wine and fish stock for the red wine/clam juice/chicken broth, and I add one finely chopped medium fennel bulb with the onions and garlic. I also top each bowl with a couple of slices of grilled croutons made from crusty bread brushed with olive oil. Oh, and a generous drizzle of this rouille: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Rouille-105637 The rouille is more traditional with bouillabaisse, but it makes a really tasty addition to cioppino, too.

read a number of reviews first before making the dish. the changes I made to the recipe were 1. white wine instead of red 2. one onion plus 2 shallots instead of 2 onions 3. made my own stock from shrimp shells and fish scraps in lieu of clam juice and chicken broth 4. 1 lb of lump crab meat instead of crab legs 5. about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of 1 tsp 6. used one yellow pepper instead f green and 7. used the following combination of items: about 1 lbs shrimp, 20 clams, 3/4 lb sea scallops, a small bag of mussels (not sure of weight), about 3/4 lb swordfish, in addition to the crab meat. it was superb and tasted like it was prepared and served in a fine restaurant.

Modified it a bit. Subbed white for red wine, added fennel, doubled garlic. Omitted king crab and fish, but added lobster and mussels. Flavor was amazing! A keeper!

Rating: 4
Read previous reviews and subbed the white wine for the red - good choice... might've been too heavy with the red. Almost doubled the garlic per other reviewers - good call, otherwise, the flavor would have been too muted. Kept the full tsp of hot red pepper flakes (Penzey's very hot crushed red pepper) - probably used a heaping teaspoon, which was not too hot and used anaheim peppers in place of the bell pepper since that's what we had on hand. The seafood additions can be whatever you want... they all work, but I thought that the fish fillet was just filler to a degree. We used rockfish which ended up being a nice firm fish, but was kind of bland on flavor. Everything else (crab claws, scallops, shrimp, and littlenecks) was delicious. Ended up freezing half of the broth and only used enough seafood/broth for two heaping servings. Will have to write back in to see if future use of the frozen broth will be just as tasty as the day it was made.

Rating: 4
Delicious and the broth was amazing!!! Very easy to make. As per others suggestions, I too doubled the amount of garlic ( I'm a garlic lover anyway). Otherwise I stuck to the recipe as stated. I think any combo of fish and shell fish works. I used shrimp, clams, mussels, cod and will add some squid next time I make this. I did not make garlic bread, was short on time, but just buttered some crusty bread and toasted it. I think the extra garlic in the broth helped. Next time I will make my own broth using saved shells from shrimp/fish/lobsters. Can't wait to make this for an up and coming summer party with family and friends!!! Yummmmm!

Rating: 4
This seems to be a very versitile recipe. My variation (thanks to prior reviews): doubled the garlic, used a yellow pepper and white wine, cut the red pepper by half, and used the cod, shrimp, and scallops I had on hand. The broth was delicious, and any combo of fish/shellfish would work, I think. I made a half recipe, just for myself, so instead of adding all the seafood at once, I took a portion of the broth and added enough seafood for one serving. Served toasted garlic bread and a salad as side. The garlic bread was great for dipping in the broth. I'm going to freeze the remaining broth for future use...two more yummy servings.

this was delicious and easy to make....reading the other reviews, i reduced the red pepper flakes in half and it was still a bit spicy but manageable (my husband loves spice and without prompting commented on the kick as his concern was for the rest of us whom are not as daring). next time i will probably try it with white wine as it might make a better presentation. a keeper!

Rating: 4
For the fish I will buy a whole fish and use the head and bones to make fish stock, which I substitute for the bottled clam juice, and cut up the fish for the stew. In a pinch I have used canned clams with the juice. Just about any combination of seafood works. I use half of the red pepper, which seems to suit most of my guests. I would be happy with more but lots of folks would find this too hot.

Looking forward to making it! Last time I had it at Scoma's requested spicy...looked like they dumped half a bottle of chili flakes on top. Amazing! More pepper the better.

Delicious Recipe! The soup is filling but not heavy so it's great anytime! I would go easy with the red pepper flakes at first and you can always add more but I found it to be a little too spicy but it was still manageable. The only substitutions I made was pinot grigio instead of red wine and imitation crab meat but it still tasted great! Also, it didn't take the full 90 minutes to make which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely will continue to make!

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this recipe. Just the right amount of red pepper as we all like some "kick." I used the clam juice from 2 cans of Snow's chopped clams and then turned around and used the clams in the soup. I also threw in a small can of crab meat instead of the legs. Definitely a keeper recipe!

My husband and I made this last night for guests and they all called this morning and asked us to make it again - soon. Very easy to make and not too spicy. Used shrimp, snapper, calamari and rock lobster tails.

Fantastic! The ingredients really shine. I followed some of the suggestions and made my own changes. I cut back on onion, oil and pepper flakes. I switched to yellow bell pepper, white wine, and lobster stock. Skipped on the crab, but added squid and mussels. The seafood cooked perfectly and the basil was a great finish.

Rating: 0
Very good recipe but way, way, way too much crushed red pepper. I'm from San Francisco where crab cioppino is a way of life. Traditionally it is not spicey or biting. The sauce is to compliment the shellfish, not overtake it. I like more garlic in it than this recipe provides but generally a good, serviceable cioppino sauce (so long as you cut the crushed red pepper down to a fourth of that provided in the printed recipe.

we made this with mussels and halibut and it was absolutely fantastic. even better the next day. make sure you have lots of crusty bread for dipping!

LOVED IT! Left out the bell pepper because it's the one thing I don't like. I thought it was a bit spicy for me, but not so much that I couldn't eat it. I only used 1 onion and I still think that was too much. Maybe I didn't soften enough because I just didn't like the texture on my tongue. But the flavor was delicious!

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I wish I had seen the comments about halving the red pepper, as my husband found it a bit too spicey. I loved the heat but can always adjust my portion later! The base is rich and flavorful. This will get added to my short list of great meals to serve guests as so much can be done ahead. I followed the reciped to the letter and served with a tossed salad and corn muffins. Corn muffins were tasty but not the best at soaking up the juices. I will definitely make this again, this time with a nice crusty french bread.

Feel free to experiment with the seafood you include. I haven't always been able to get the crab legs. I have incuded mussles, though. I also tend to add more shrimp since it fills it out more with a less expensive ingredient. I use shrimp stock when I have it instead of clam juice.

I made this recipe, substituting seafood broth for the wine and chicken broths. It turned out fantastically and everyone at the party enjoyed it. It was quick and easy as well! I served it with some grilled bread and rice underneath (to stretch it out a bit). I also took a queue from another Cioppino recipe off epicurious (Grandfather's version) and added some all spice and cinnamon. I thought the cinnamon added such a great contrast to the spice of the hot pepper flakes, and made the broth sweeter, and more balanced in flavour. I'd definitely throw this together again!

Wonderful dish! I live in coastal Georgia and made this with local clams, grouper and wild shrimp. It was delicious. Few modifications...I used red pepper instead of green and roasted it first to remove the skin. I also had some fennel that I chopped and sauteed with the onions. I steamed some Israeli couscous in chicken stock, with parsley and parmesan. Served the stew in large bowls over the couscous. Do NOT forget some crusty french bread to soak up the juice!

This is a favorite family recipe -- we have it Christmas Eve and other special occasions. I add fennel and celery and use 1 onion. I also add chopped clams to the base just before adding the seafood. I mix clams and mussels and add 3 fish types...in addition to shrimp, crab and scallops.

I thought the recipe was well- written, and I followed it pretty closely. Maybe it was the places where I deviated that lead it to a three vs. four fork rating. I thought it was too tomatoey, acidic, and fishy. Next time, I would add a little carrot, use white instead of red wine, add the oregano in the bell-pepper tomato paste step (it eventually burned in the first step) and use fresh tomatoes, or not tomatoes canned with sauce - like I did. That may have been my major mistake. My stew looked the part - but did not have the subtle, intricate flavor of the real thing. A lot of homemade garlic croutons makes it pretty tasty though!

Super deliciousness!!!! You might want to adjust for heat as I did, I like it SPICY! Great dinner for a cold winter night or for LENT! We ran out of bread sopping up the soup! I used seafood stock as I had it laying around and it was awesome! Definitely on my "best" list!

This is a FABULOUS Cioppino. I added some mussels for good measure - the clams took the full 10 minutes to cook - I did not add the crab till the very end with the rest of the seafood. The trick is to cook the seafood as little as possible to maintain the consistency and not have it get rubbery. We just love this dish!!

Having grown up in San Francisco, I know what good cioppino is and I agree with the other reviewer who dubbed this recipe "the real deal." I made this tonight for dinner and all of my childhood memories of eating cioppino Scoma's and Tadich's came flooding back to me! I followed the recipe to the letter and used fresh Alaska spot prawns, king crab legs, scallops and clams. I also threw in some chunks of halibut I happened to have on hand. A really nice showcase for fresh seafood!

This was so hearty and delicious! I made a few adjustments to make it less expensive and tastier! Used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, cayenne peppers to make it hotter, can of white crab meat from a can (awesome!), used cod filets, squid rings, bay scallops YUM YUM YUM! Everyone loved it!

RAVE! I made this as my contribution to a supper club gathering and it got great reviews and demands for the recipe. I tried to stick pretty close to what's here, but since the entire group abstains from alcohol, I obviously had to change the red wine part. Instead I measured a half cup of balsamic and added an extra quarter cup of broth. Then, as the stew (sans seafood) simmered, I added a few more dashes of balsamic to taste. I also threw in a diced carrot and left out the crab. Even with less seafood (I probably used about 1/2 to 2/3 of the amount called for) this stew was very meaty and every bite was full of seafood. I don't know if this is because I wasn't using wine, but the quarter cup of olive oil seemed excessive. I will use about half that the next time. I can't wait to make this again.

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe fairly close yet, I used swordfish (on sale) muscles, and little neck clams. I subbed-with dry white wine as this is what I had on hand. I used fresh parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, I used 1 red bell pepper and two green Anaheim peppers, and we ate this with buttered ciabatta. This was so very delicious! My wife wasn't excited about the dish when I told her what I was making but she was very happy with the results. This is a great formula that will turn many seafood combinations into a great dish.

I made this for New Years Eve. It was delicious. I grew up in the Monterey Bay area, and my Significant other is from San Francisco. We miss this kind of food very much now that we live in Virginia.

Was great with fresh baked sourdough bread (yes we found some real Sourdough on the East Coast)!

For a new cook who likes cioppino and never thought she could make it - it was wonderful, full of flavor and very easy! Another review suggested using shrimp stock instead of clam juice, which was very easy to make as well. A great recipe that made me look like a pro in front of guests!

I am a native San Franciscan and that recipe is the real deal. It has exactly the flavors and consistency that you would find at our heritage seafood restaurants like Taddich Grill or Scoma's. I used only about 2/3 the seafood requested and it was fine with lots of savory broth to sop up with fine sourdough bread. An Oregon Pinot Noir was a fine companion!

As most of said it is an excellent receipe. I used fresh Alaskan spot shrimp, halibut and scallops. I used shrimp stock made from the shrimp shells instead of chicken broth and clam juice. I added sauted leeks and seasoned the seafood with cajun spices. I also used canned diced tomatoes to make it easy. Cooked up great and was a big hit. Really good receipe for throwing any good seafood in. Warm fresh crusty bread is a must as is a nice red pinot or syrah. Great dish for cold Alaskan winter nights.

I LOVE this recipe, and make it all the time. I use a 1/2c more olive oil, sauté the garlic and onion, etc with added shallots. Then drain off about 1/2 cup to use to make a fresh cilantro and basil drizzle when I serve up. The bright green against the red is lush. I skip clam juice and use Fumet de Poisson (fish stock) I add small new potatoes, or potatoes cut up to add some body. Use tomato passata along with tinned chopped tomatoes. Make the base in bulk, freeze it in portions and it is simple to throw together, last minute. You can always just use a bag of frozen mixed seafood and some frozen cod if in a hurry. But to impress, go all the way with fresh!

We loved the Cioppino! It absolutely was a hit and I will definitely make it again! For some other cooks that rated this recipe low, you are missing out! The pleasure cooks get out of basic recipes is to follow it and then improvise and add your own personality and love to your food. I doubled the recipe and added an entire bottle of local Lodi Zinfandel from 100 year old vines, spicy hot links, tilapia and mussels. We enjoyed it the day I made it and also the next day with a different group of friends. They said, "God bless this feast!" Don't forget warming up some crusty bread to soak up the delicious stew. Buen aprovecho!

Ciopinno is Canadian for "kitchen sink" - you can add what you like. The ONLY place to get the seafood ingredients in LA is Santa Monica Seafood. Go Saturday morning and buy the remaining components at the farmer's market. With everything completely fresh, this is even better!

Am an ardent fisherman and have harvested my own seafood my entire life. During existing low tides, managed to have fresh caught Alaska spot prawns, manila clams, and shucked oysters. With all this fresh seafood, decided to try a cioppino. Since crab season is closed and no local scallop fishery, decided to buy some fresh Alaska halibut and go with what I had. Followed the recipe except for fish substitutions. Some were dubious about the oyster addition, but all agreed the oysters were fantastic. Will make it again and oysters will be included.

Delicious! I chose this for a dinner party of 18 after having read the reviews. I tripled the recipe. Used cod, mussels, shrimp,scallops clams and previously blue crab claws from our local seafood merchant. Deleted the greeen pepper, added some carrots, celery and a little sugar. It was an easy dish to make when entertaining a large crown because the base can be made the day before. Served with a salad and crusty bread it was a great meal for a cool winter night.

I made this dish for Christmas Eve. It was very easy and everyone loved it! I bought all of my seafood from Mutual Fish and it was wonderful! I did tweek it a little based on other reviews - here's what I did - in place of the chicken stock and clam juice I used a boxed fish broth, for the whole tomatoes I used crushed, and for the crab leg I added 2 whole crabs, I also added some mussels and squid. The only thing I would do differently is make the base a day or two a head - the leftovers just kept getting better. Really, really good recipe.

This has become our traditional Christmas dinner for three years in a row now. Regardless of the seafood combination I choose, it's always terrific. When cooking for a large crowd, I always make the stock the day before and then add the seafood the night of. To simplify I use canned clams in their juice and omit the clam juice. I also omit the salt because the stock is plenty salty.

Overall tasty, however, I didn't include the bottle of clam juice, instead used a can of chopped clams and added fresh clams. My husband and I felt the diss was on the saltier side. The next time I'll cut back on the salt. This dish was on the more expensive side due to cost of king crab $19.99/lb.and scallops $14/lb. Next time, I'll wait till crab season and use dungeness crab (it be sweeter and alot less)

Amazingly easy and perfect! I skipped the red pepper flake because we don't really care for spicy. I doubled the garlic, and used an amazing Argentinian red with spicy undertones, and very dry. I added 1/2 lb. of squid (just bodies) sliced into rings and added them at the same time as the shrimp. I also added mussels along with the clams. I made one other switch, instead of whole tomatoes I used crushed tomatoes in puree, it just gives a smoother, thicker sauce.

No substitutions necessary. It's fantastic just the way it is, and it practically cooks itself.

I've made this several times and love it. I'm making it right now for a friend who is a non-drinking alcoholic, but after researching exactly how much alcohol cooks out of food, and not wanting to cause problems for my friend, I decided to omit the wine. I substituted a hefty splash of balsamic vinegar, plus extra tomato paste, clam juice, saffron, and fennel. It still tastes pretty darn good, though I have to admit I prefer it with the wine in it, red or white. If anyone has other suggestions on enhancing the flavor sans alcohol, I'd appreciate it!

Very disappointing given the reviews. I made the base the day before and added the seafood just before serving. I used shrimp, scallops, mussels and monk fish. The base, originally very aromatic, turned brown in color and was quite tasteless. What did I do wrong?

I made this recipe last night and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone went for 2nds (my husband went for 3rds!!). I bought a lot of seafood (halibut, clams, prawn, scallops and 2 whole dungeness crabs). I though for sure we would have plenty leftover, but I was wrong! I also half the pepper flakes based on reader's suggestions and I agree, it was perfect. Any more would be too spicy. You can always add more if you desire, at the end. I mistakenly bought a red bell pepper insteado of green, but it worked just as well. Besides the quantity of seafood and the above changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazingly good! I will definitely make this dish again!!

This is a great recipe. I made the full amount of tomato base, but set half aside as there were only two of us. I used approx half the fish: halibut, tiger prawns, scallops, clams. I will get some more fish tomorrow to make another batch. It made 3 generous servings - luckily for us a hungry friend dropped by just as we had finished our portions. A simple salad and some bread completed the meal.

My husband made this this weekend and it was fantastic. It was easy to make and did not take all that long to make. We used canned crab and added it at the very, very end as one user suggested. The fish we found available were clams, scallops, haddock, shrimp and crab. The fresh herbs added at the end were delicious. It was even better the seconds night as left overs. We may make the soup base one night and add the fish on the second night, so the soup flaoris can meld. We made a half recipe since it was only the 2 of us and it made a lot - probably could have served 4. We will make this again with out a doubt

I made this for a Sunday night supper and it was FANTASTIC! I used the Seafood Blend (calamari, shrimp and scallops) from Trader Joe's, plus Tilapia, mussels and a can of crab meat (also from TJ's). Served it with crusty Italian bread from Il Fornaio and a caesar salad. Here's a tip.....I used San Marzano canned tomatoes for the first time. They cost about three times the price of regular tomatoes but were so rich and delicious that they were well worth it.

I rarely- if ever- give a recipe four forks, but this is fantastic. If it looks arduous or complicated at first glance, it absolutely isn't. Delicious, sublime, easy. I took another reviewer's advice and cut back on the red pepper- glad I did; two solid pinches were just right, the recipe lists far too much. I also added the heaping tablespoon of oregano, which was a plus. The rest I left as is; delcious recipe, ideal for entertaining, even better the second (and third!) day. Make it now.

This had great flavor, and was easy to prepare. It was a huge hit with my family, and I will certainly make it again. I used fish that was fresh at my local fish store: squid, striped sea bass, bay scallops, shrimp, manila clams and canned lump crab. If you use canned crab, add it at the very end. I didn't add it late enough, and although it still tasted awesome, the presentation could have been better. The crab fell apart and looked threadlike.

Rating: 4
I dont know what some of the other reviews were talking about"Just okay, had better". This was so good! Maybe its because i live in the SanFrancisco Bay Area and have fantastic seafood year round. But my family couldn't get enough of the broth, i added the mustard from the crab (family secret) for extra richness. For sure make it again!

Made this for my husbands b-day and the family loved it. I had never made cioppino before. This definitely is a fail-proof recipe. I even had to multiply by two and half times to accomodate my large family. Still came out great. I took in a lot of everyones reviews into consideration, and tweaked the recipe accordingly. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. After reading several other reviews, I too added an additional bottle of clam juice; the consistency was nice. I omitted the green bell pepper; I also added a pinch of saffron to the chicken broth before adding it to the cippino. The result was a wonderful depth of flavor. I served this soup at a Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times always with excellent results. The ingredients vary somewhat depending what is in season at the fish market. Last time I tried using Dungeness Crab cut into sections. The flavor was outstanding but too messy for my guests. Next time I'll pick out the crab in advance but still drop some of the larger shells in for flavor and pluck them out before serving. This is an incredibly easy dish to make and is perfect for a dinner party. I prefer red wine in my cioppino, but that's just me.

This was one of the best presentations I have made. It was out of this world. I incorporated some of the suggestions from the other reviewers, ie. fennel bulb, celery and experimented with yellow peppers. Will do it again. Everyone loved it!!

Have used many recipes, but never reviewed. This was outstanding and easy. I added leeks & celery. Also did 1.5x ingredients for 6 people and there was not much left. Everyone raved.

I've made this with great success two different times. It is particularly convenient for entertaining because you can make the broth ahead of time and add the seafood just before serving. I put the broth through a foley food mill before adding the seafood and the resulting texture is very nice. I have also thrown in a can of chopped clams.

Rating: 3
I have made this several times and it is wonderful! I have added leeks and anise and changed the fish around a bit (depending on what looks good at the market). The flavors are great and the base (without the fish) freezes well.

I had never made cioppino before, so I decided to make this exactly according to the recipe. OMG....wonderful!!! I served it to a friend and we both just kept making these grunts of ecstasy. That being said, I would still probably tweak it a bit. I'd drop the pepper flakes a bit and would up the clam juice a bit. That would be all of my modifications at this point. Once I try it with those changes, I'll see what else might help. But I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed by this recipe prepared exactly as stated.

Rating: 4
Outstanding... The best Cioppino ever, and quite easy. I used small sweet red and yellow peppers, a little more garlic than suggested, and fire-roasted tomatoes, and it was superb. Be sure to serve with crusty bread to soak up some of the delicious broth.

Rating: 4
This is an addition to my previous review. I made this for the second time and needed to feed a few more people. Added one additional can of chopped tomatoes and juice and 1/2 more wine. Corrected the seasonings just a bit, not much and it fed everyone comfortably with a couple of seconds. Am going to make a really huge batch for our super bowl party.

Rating: 4
I read all the reviews and incorporated a lot of the ideas like adding celery along with the green pepper. I did use the absolute best canned tomatoes and think that made a difference as one reviewer suggested. Since my family doesn't like clams or mussels, I added about 1 1/2 pounds of lump crab meat along with the crab leg pieces (I used Dungeness instead of King). I'm glad I toned down the red pepper flakes, would have been way too spicy, this way was perfect. We all sopped up the broth with really good bread and my husband and I are now having left overs. Reheats well and with the flavors blending even more, it's wonderful.

I'd like to make some freezer safe soups for my Dad that he can just thaw for an easy meal. Has anyone tried freezing this soup?

Rating: 3
Nice recipe! Since I prefer more of a brothy soup, I strained the tomoatoes and onions etc into a saucepan. I also sauted some fennel till it was soft and put it aside keeping the flavor from in the pan. I added saffron to the broth and then added the seafood. One word of caution...Getting all the seafood to be at its optimal doneness is tough. You may want to cook the seafood on the side (except clams or mussels), then add to the sauce just to warm.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful and one of the few 4 stars I've given out over the years on this website. I incorporated various excellent suggestions by previous reviewers including: adding some diced fennel, celery and leeks (reducing the onion to 1 med-large onion); substituting yellow bell pepper for green; adding a pinch of saffron; adding an extra bottle of clam juice, using combination of red/white wine (although either would be fine); adding a heaping tablespoon of fresh oregano and fresh thyme. For the tomatoes, I used a 28 can of whole tomatoes from San Marzano region (worth every penny), a box of extra sauce (I use Pomi in a box), and a few diced fresh tomatoes I had lying around. For the seafood, I added halibut cheeks, Alaska clams, Blue mussells, scallops, shrimp and 2 pounds of Red King Crab (huge ones available at Costco for $13.99 per pound - biggest I've seen this season). This was very impressive served in large shallow white bowls. Great served with herb/parmesan focaccia bread, tossed salad with butter lettuce and burgandy/herb dressing and a great Oregon Pinot Noir. Make this recipe - it's worth the $$$. Also, I highly recommend making the broth/sauce the day before. The flavors really meld together. YUM!!!

Rating: 4
Very GOOOD!!! Use thyme instead of oregano, 8 garlic cloves, add two red peppers, and use good zinfandel as the red wine. Puree some of the stew base and forget the tomato paste. Remember red pepper adds sweetness so adjust accordingly. Enjoy!!!

Rating: 3
I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, but made a few minor changes. I, too, decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. I added a can of chopped clams and reduced the amount of oil to 2 Tbsp. When the sauce was cooked, I separated it into 6 containers and froze them. I now buy just enough clams, halibut, king crab or lobster, shrimp and scallops for each serving and have a delightful, easy dinner in minutes!

Rating: 4
Excellent cold weather soup. I used Little Neck Clams, Florida Shrimp, Mussels, Scallops & Grouper. Thought maybe next time I'd add Calamari. The base was full of flavor and enjoyed the easy cleanup. The red petter flakes were not overdone for me. Superb!

Rating: 3
I made this for guests, a dangerous enterprise! It was a big hit, however. I had started out to make bouillabaisse, so used sea bass, sea scallops and mussels. I didn't have any tomato paste, but didn't miss it. I used boxed seafood stock by Kitchen Basics--extremely convenient and tasty, if you can find it--Italian frying peppers instead of green bell pepper, and white wine. I never salt in advance, and let people salt to taste. The broth was incredibly good, and all the fish was perfect.

Rating: 3
It's hard not to adore a dish that contains so many yummy ingredients. However, I think this would taste more balanced and subtler, and have more shellfish deliciousness, if celery instead of green bell pepper is used.

Rating: 4
This is a classic-made it for guests last night to accolades and requests for seconds rather than dessert. Being incapable of following a recipe exactly, I added a bulb of fennel and used white wine. To save money axed the crab, used canned clams and frozen shrimp and scallops. Still pricey but worth it. Also made the stew sans seafood early in the day and let it rest to bring up the flavors. Great one dish make ahead easy clean up meal.

Rating: 3
I seesawed between this recipe and the "grandfather's cioppino" on this website and ultimately made this one. It was very, very tasty but I, like so many reviewers, think the quantity of red pepper flakes were a little "over the top." They sidetracked you from the flavor of the sauce; kind of overpowering. The joy of this meal is that you can use pretty much what is on sale (seafood-wise) and it's still an awesome recipe. Do not forget a good crusty break for dipping!

Rating: 4
This was by far the best Cioppino I have ever had. Served it at a dinner party and everyone raved and raved. I also cut back on the red peper flakes and it was just fine for everyone's taste. A great company dish because you can prep. the day before and add fish right before serving. A five fork in my book!

Rating: 4
This was expensive, but outstanding. We used white wine instead of red, as suggested in earlier posts, and omitted the white fish ... it still turned out beautifully. The only suggestion I would make is to cut the red pepper in half. Although we are from Texas, the recipe as is was even a little too spicy for us. ENJOY!

Very, very good. I was worried about the cost (I spent $80 at the store!) but it turned out so wonderful. I used mussels instead of clams and red snapper, which is very pretty. For a special occasion this is really nice, and everyone was impressed. I served it with some french bread to sop up the juice. Bellissimo!

A delicous Fall soup recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, was a bit skeptical about the red wine but it was worth the risk to use it! I would definitely make it again A fresh sourdough loaf sopped up the juice.

This is fabulous! Have made it several times and doubled it for a birthday crowd. It's worth every minute of prep time and expense. You will be forever revered by your guests. Added a simple clean side of pasta - just to allow for more sopping of the sauce. Bravo!

I made this recipe yesterday for my Mom for Mother's Day. In a word~Wow! We tripled the recipe and added saffron to the broth. I made a couple of other minor changes, mussels instead of clams (my market was out of clams)and I used white wine instead of red. I think red wine would have been to overpowering. Try this recipe!! You won't be sorry!

My mom was blown away by this dish! Made it for mother's day dinner. Only change was to add fennel, made the sauce the day before and the red wine was great in the recipe. Served it with a simple Ceasar salad and sour dough bread and a heart red wine. Everyone ate so much that no one had room for my renowned Key Lime Pie. Will definitely be making again. Great meal for seafood loving company as it's so simple to make, especially if you do the sauce in advance. I threw the salad together while the seafood simmered. Awesome! defnitely make this recipe, it's the best one I've found to date on Epicurious

I grew up with Crab Cioppino and have not found a perfect recipe. Well, this is it. I made a batch for 22 people Christmas 2002, and I have more people tell me this was the best cioppino they have ever had. It is extremely easy and basically failproof. I love it and will definitely make it over and over again. Cook from Seattle.

Rating: 4
We live in San Franicsco, where Cioppino is sort of a local dish. This recipe is fantastic. I substitute different seafoods, depending upon what is fresh and it has never failed! Also, whenever we travel to see our families they ask us to make this for them -- so we bring the recipe with us.

Followed the sauce ingredients exactly but substituted lobster for the crab and mussels for the clams. Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

The whole family really liked this dish. I did change a few things due to unavailable items at the store that night. I used lobster instead of crab. I also used 3 cups homemade fish stock instead of the clam and chicken stock. And I cut the wine in half. (Very glad I did so. Anymore would of been to much) Family already asking for it again!! :)

I have made this recipe a few times and it always comes out great. I have used a cleaned whole crab but for this New Years I made it with all the fish listed and 3 halved lobster tails. Wonderful. Served it with lightly toasted garlic sourdough bread. Yum!

We thought it was good but prefer the ones made with white wine. The best is from an old recipe pamphlet that came with a bottle of Courvoisier several years ago. The red wine seemed a little overpowering and I used a light one after reading that remark by someone else. Just my opinion, different strokes and all that...Happy New Year to all.

Received many accolades after making this recipe last night. I added 1/2 of a whole fennel bulb, and used a mix of frozen Trader Joe's mahi mahi, fresh scallops and fresh shrimp. Delicious! One note: a bit spicy, I will reduce red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. next time.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! One of my guests said it was the best meal he's had in ten years.

I left out the green bell pepper and the tomato paste. (just because I didn't have any) I used mussels, halibut, squid, scallops, and shrimp. My family loved it.

I'm not a huge seafood fan, so the task of rating this recipe passed to my seafood-loving husband and our dinner guest. Both gave this a resounding 4 forks, and my husband passed along the additional compliment that "this is as good or better than any cioppino in a restaurant". I didn't make any substitutions...just made it as printed.

I made this for "vegetarian-fish-eating" friends and they really enjoyed it. They all gave it three stars instead of four, but that was my fault. I made a couple of substitutions, like adding sugar, and they thought it was a little sweet.(I thought it was terrific and I would definately make it again. Maybe no substitutions this time).

Don't throw this one back..it's a keeper! Incredibly easy meal to prepare with impressive results for a little-notice supper for company. I used shrimp, scallops, monk fish, halibut and little neck clams...any fish will do as long as you pay attention to the cooking time.

Very repeatable. Used a merlot for the red wine, and added Argentine scallops (from Trader Joes, plus approx 2 tbsp finely chopped cilantro. Accompaniments included an Australian Shiraz and jalapeno corn muffins, made while the cioppino simmered. Quite nice-- this will be a keeper!

Rating: 4
If you have other cioppino recipes, throw them away. THIS is the only one you'll ever need! Couldn't stop "tasting" the stew before I added the seafood, it's amazing. The only deviation from the recipe I made was to add a small fennel bulb and a teaspoon of fennel seed (I think it enhances the flavour of the tomatoes). My cioppino is simmering now, can't wait to eat!

Rating: 3
Perfect for a chilly winter afternoon. The sauce is rich and spicy. It's a good idea to crack the crab legs thoroughly so the meat can slide out easily; otherwise, dining can be a bit messy. Goes very well with the rosemary focaccia described on the adjoining page.

The sauce was exquisite! I used Chateau Ste. Michelle Merlot,and,in place of clams (were were unavailable), mussels. My husband and guests stated; "This is much more than a weekday meal it is a weekend delight!"
