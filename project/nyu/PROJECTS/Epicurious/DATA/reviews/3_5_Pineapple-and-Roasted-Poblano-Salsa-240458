This was missing something. It needed more flavor, maybe some ginger? It was just blah!

I made this recipe as written except with a full bunch of cilantro. It was great and definitely not too sweet.

I made this as an accompaniment to the Curried Sweet Potato Latkes recipe I found on Epicurious. I used one can of crushed pineapple instead of an entire fresh pineapple, which drastically altered the proportions in favor of the poblanos, and it was delicious. I thought it would be too spicy this way, but poblanos are gentle enough that it wound up giving just the right fresh flavorful kick to the greasy latkes. I imagine that if the recipe were made as written, the overabundance of pineapple would result in the salsa tasting too sweet.
