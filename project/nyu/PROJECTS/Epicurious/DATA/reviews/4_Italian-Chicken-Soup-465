I used three sweet Italian sausage, casings removed, meat scrambled and added instead of the chicken and it was delicious and hearty!

This has become our go-to "i'm-sick-and-need-soup" dish. Love the flavor added with the fennel seeds. We vary it based on what we have in the house. We have used carrots, celery, swiss chard, zucchini, onions....any veggie you like in soup will go great in here. We don't always add the chicken, and have never done it with ravioli b/c I'm gluten free. We do make some gluten-free noodles to add in occassionally. The broth is delicious and I definitely would recommend this recipe!

This is absolutely the best combination of spices I have ever tasted in chicken soup. Sometimes I alter ingrediants but never the spices. I make it over and over and I use whole wheat tortollini....yum!

I am committing the cardinal Epicurious sin of both rating and reviewing a recipe that I tweaked. Sorry. I only added a can of white bean, because I wanted to up the protein, and this was a great soup. I gave it 3 forks instead of 4 because it's not THRILLING! But it's a nice quick little soup for a weeknight and I suspect could handle a LOT of tweaking.

This is delicious!!! I have made it the last 3 years with left over Thanksgiving turkey. Increased my usual increases - garlic and carrots. Left out the ravioli since I make it after TG feasting. Oh, and I also make homemade turkey broth.

This is an exceptional soup for how simple it is to make. I stuck w/ the recipe for the most part, with the following additions: prior to adding the broth, I added white wine to the onion/green pepper, & simmered a few minutes--then added the broth. Right before serving, I squeezed juice from 1/2 a lemon into it, to brighten it up w/ a bit of acidity. Delish!

I made this a couple weeks ago and it was SO good! I used Trader Joe's mini cheese ravioli. I used mushrooms and didn't use zucchini. Then yesterday I made it again, this time I made with tortellini with cheese, big mistake, didn't taste like the first time I made it. I'm going to stick with the ravioli. Adding parmesan cheese was a plus! I also doubled the recipe and freezed them, still came out delicious (with the first batch I made)!!

This soup is excellent. I substituted yellow peppers for green. Used celery instead of zuchinni, put a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes and used mini ratonni instead of the ravoli to save the calories. Two chicken bouilon cubes enhances the flavor. I like the idea of putting fresh spinach leaves in the bowl and pouring the soup over it in the bowls. I will try that next time.

So quick and so delicious! I made it with boneless chicken thighs added as recommended during the simmer. I also added two boullion cubes to the broth. The broth is great and it was so easy to make.

With a few tweaks, this went down a treat! We had left-over pheasant instead of chicken, we added celery and used home-made broth and pasta spirals instead of the cheese ravioli. We also omitted the Parmesan cheese. With the amount of crushed red pepper increased to 1/2 teaspoon for a two-people quantity, it made a fabulous winter soup.

Very nice soup. I didn't have ravioli so I broke spaghetti into very small pieces. I added some chopped celery and 2 small chopped fresh roma tomatoes. I also added a small hard rind of a parmesan cheese to the broth which I do often for homemade veg stock which gives a lot of extra flavor. I also added thinly shredded swiss chard because I had so much in the garden.

Fantastic soup - got rave reviews! I doubled the recipe to feed a larger group but did not double the fennel seeds. It was perfect - not too overwhelming. I browned some chicken tenders in garlic olive oil right in my soup pot. Removed the chicken and proceeded with the recipe. Used Trader Joe's broth and cheese tortellini. Leftovers were incredible!

rather tasty but don't make my mistake by using orzo in place of other pastas. it wasn't ever soup! the pasta just got bigger and bigger every time i lifted the lid to add more broth, which totaled 6 ADDITIONAL cups by the time i gave up 2 days later and fed the last bits to the dog. next time, i'll going to find a good mini cheese tortellini!

Included suggestions from other reviewers, as follows: added "better than boullion" to broth; put fresh spinach in bowls before adding soup, excellent idea!; added celery, can of Italian stewed tomatoes (drained and cut smaller) replaced green pepper, which we don't like, with 1/2 each red and yellow; and added chunks of chicken to broth to cook before celery and zucchini. My family loved it!

Great soup - particularly when using a great broth. After making this and it's turkey twin, in my best version you leave out the fennel, use a red pepper and serve into a bowl with a handful of fresh spinach.The spinach cooks perfectly and it looks faaaabulous. Makes it more of an all-season soup too.

Rating: 4
This is excellent! I wanted a chicken soup with lots of flavor (I was feeling a bit congested) and this definitely fit the bill. Best news? It still has great flavor now that my nose is unstuffed again. I added a clove of garlic, left out the pasta completely and followed another reviewer's advice by adding boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into thinner strips) along with the broth during the simmer portion of the recipe, removing, shredding and re-adding toward the end, and it was perfect.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. The first time I made it, all I had was anise seed (instead of fennel) but I crushed them and it worked. I had frozen chopped "trio of bell peppers" (Trader Joes) at home, so used that instead of green bell peppers and used little round soup noodles. This soup is a big hit!

I just made this soup this evening and my family raved over it, so I had to write a review. My 10 year old "liked" it, my 13 year old "LOVED" it, and my husband came back for thirds! The fennel made the soup, so don't skimp on it. It smelled so good simmering that everyone kept lifting the lid to inhale. This is so much more than chicken soup. I served it with a salad and crusty Italian bread and it was hearty enough for a dinner meal. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
The reviews are correct this is a wonderful soup. I concur that the fennel is what makes this soup special.. (I am calling it my secret soup ingredient!) I was skeptical but it really is lovely with the combination of the red pepper. I didn't have zucchini so I used celery and a few other minor changes. The only thing I really changed was that I used rice instead of pasta... I added about a 1/2cup of rice at the end and instead of boiling I simmered for a while with the lid partially covered. This is a very easy, gourmet, full-flavored soup recipe and even good enough for company!

In my never ending search for the perfect chicken soup I tried this with minor variations: added some chopped celery to the onions, used red and orange bell peppers (what I had on hand), green beans in place of zucchini and dried tortellini (Trader Joe's brand) instead of ravioli. I polled my family and asked for their honest (if brutal) opinions. The broth is excellent, I was a little nervous about fennel, not being a huge fan of it, but the flavor was outstanding. The dried tortellini were not the greatest; my son would prefer "regular" noodles in his chicken soup and my husband found them a little more than needed. I will definitely make this again but will tweak the ingredients a bit - mostly the pasta, maybe shells, or "regular" noodles that my son likes (wide egg noodles). I used leftover chicken breasts that I had roasted with pesto a couple days earlier - a great way to use extra chicken, and I will likely roast extra chicken whenever I think it is soup weather!

I have made this soup many times and my family loves it. It has a unique flavor that makes you want to gobble it up. The only change I made is to add skinless boneless chicken breasts while the soup is simmering (before adding carrots and zuchini). I remove them, shred and then continue with the recipe. I also substitute any pasta shape for the tortellini (which I find too filling). Don't forget the parmesan, it adds alot to the soup.

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I came across the recipe when I was doing some random search and I had everything on hand to make it. The only thing I didn't have was zucchini, which I figured would get too mushy, anyway. I used red bell peppers and Bermuda onions (which I was hoping to add more color, but the color faded during cooking). I used cheap bulk dried tortellini, which I cooked and kept separate until serving, since I generally cook soup by the gallon and didn't want the tortellini to take over all the broth. I also drizzled a little pesto on top. I was wary of the fennel after reading a few of the reviews, and after smelling straight fennel, but it turned out great. I'll be making it over and over. Gallons at a time!

A great blend of flavors, especially if you like fennel seeds. It will make your house smell fantastic. It takes a long time overall, but the recipe itself is quick. For the chicken: Take one chicken breast and add pepper and salt to both sides after patting dry. Cook over medium/high heat in a frying pan with a bit of butter, 5 minutes each side or until browned. Throw in a pan in the oven at 350 degree for about 20 minutes. Cut and add with fresh tortellini near end.

This was delicious, I loved the flavor the fennel seeds added. I had some beautiful carrots from my CSA which helped, and unusual for me, stuck to the recipe, using homemade stock. I loved it when my 17 y/o stepson was squinching up his nose trying to identify the fennel -- then had 2 huge bowls.

This soup has become a favourite in my house! I too use red pepper rather than green. I also increased the crushed red pepper to 1/2 tsp (or more if I'm in the mood) for a bit more of a kick and I use mini farfalle instead of cheese ravioli (husband can't have cheese) Delicious and easy - it's also been a real hit for quick and easy dinners with friends.

When my fiancé and I took the first bite, we thought, "Yuck. What did I just spend all my time doing?" By the end, we were licking our bowls and getting seconds. Trust me -- if you have finicky eaters in your house that can't stand something after bite one, make them indulge you and eat more. They'll be lapping it up. BTW: Did not use green bell peppers, used extra red pepper flakes, used additional thyme, used tons of dried basil bits, added freshly cut celery and fresh spinach, marinated the chicken in balsamic vinagertte salad dressing with thyme and rosemary, added some extra ground black pepper, and finally, I completely adhered to the low-salt chicken broth for the sake of our health.

Yummy! Like other posters, I used tortellini as opposed to ravioli. Another slight modification was that I made was that I wound up adding more broth...and then a little water...and then a little white wine. (I wanted more of a soup and less of a stew.) I marinated my boneless chicken breasts in an Old Bay/Italian dressing marinade all day before grilling them and cubing them for the soup. This added a subtle touch to the flavor. I'll definitely make this soup again. Next time, however, I might use only one zucchini and add some celery and mushrooms.

Sooo good. You really can't miss. I added more hot pepper flakes, substituted gemelli pasta for the ravioli, and added some tomatoes. I also made my own stock for this soup, including the 2 tsp fennel with the chicken bones and vegetables and then discarding. This works well because then you get a subtle fennel flavor without having those powerful little seeds in the soup. My husband ate 3 bowls!

I am just beginning to come down with a cold, so this unique and aromatic soup was very soothing to my sore throat and aching muscles. However, in spite of the pungent flavor of the onions, garlic, basil, and fennel, I felt that the soup was missing something to push it over the top from ordinary to extraordinary. I may be biased because I prefer a soup with much more broth and vegetables, but I would not make this soup again "as is." I like the concept behind it, but definitely would "doctor it up." More broth, more vegetables, perhaps some stewed tomatoes, more zuchinni and carrots, or french green beans. The fennel definitely predominates the other flavors; I would advise cutting back on it if you do not care for fennel (or do not know if you do).

Yummy. I taste tested it before I dropped in my tortellini and was worried that it was going to be a little bland. As soon as I added the pasta and cheese, it turned out great!

I cannot get enough of this soup. I substitute the bell pepper for celery, leave out the fennel seeds -- the soup is so much more flavourful and tasty without them -- and use three cheeses ravioli. I have made the soup with chicken mince balls, smoked sausages, no chicken, and even no zucchini. I just throw in three or more carrots. This soup always works. This has become a staple in our home. I make it about once every two weeks and it is always gobbled up with relish by my picky husband.

This is a great recipe. I will never make a chicken soup form a can again. It is very easy. We absolutely loved it. If the recipe is not complicated, I typically adlib a bit. So this is what I did. I changed the bell peppers to celery, substituted "pasta seasoning" (a blend of italian herbs, including basil and oregano) and used leftover herb-roasted chicken. I also added more broth, but I probably simmer on too high heat, so it boils away. I've been "creating" homemade chicken soup since I was 14, this is the perfect base recipe.
