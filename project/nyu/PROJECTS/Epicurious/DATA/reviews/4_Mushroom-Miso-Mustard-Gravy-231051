I think this tasted pretty much the same as some regular gravy I had made before (that stayed in the fridge for a very long time until it finally went into poutine). I was all-too-enthusiastic to make "Better" in order to extend my (expensive!) organic butter. Did not use cooking spray. Why would one do this? You're already using oil anyway. I don't buy cooking spray because it contains things like propane. Blech. Used a homemade veggie stock which actually involved some chicken wing tips in its making, so mine wasn't quite vegetarian. I don't think this affects the taste though. As a teetotaler, I do not buy wine, so I used white wine vinegar and water (about 1/3 vinegar). I think this was too much vinegar because the end result was sour, but ok. Followed the suggestion to add miso at the end. Although this recipe seemed complicated, it really wasn't. I put it on the marinated tempeh also by this user (fantastic, btw), and ended up having them ready at the same time. Served over rice with broccoli cooked with ginger and fish sauce. My meat-loving husband loved the meal.

PLEASE NEVER BOIL OR SIMMER MISO! It completely destroys all the beneficial bacteria that make miso such a great, nutritious, digestion- enhancing food. I was shocked to hear this well-know authority on natural and vegetarian cookery ignoring this well-known rule of thumb. Always add miso at the end, once a dish is off the heat, stirring to dissolve into final product.

Sorry--my earlier review was for another recipe and I don't know how to remove it. I also made this recipe on Christmas and it was delicious. It made a lot of gravy so I would make half a recipe next time but I will use the leftover gravy in a pot pie or freeze it. I will definitely use this recipe again. It's low fat, can easily be made vegan by cooking in wine instead of the butter, and it has a big flavor. We served goose for the meat eaters and they loved the gravy--it was hearty enough to go with the meat without having to deal with getting rid of all the fat in the pan drippings and vegetarians could enjoy it also.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, leaving out the potatoes. I also tossed in finely chopped mushroom stems (from stuffed mushrooms the day before) at the same time as the peas. After roasting the veggies I put the roasting pan across two burners, put in a cup of water and made a stock with the pan drippings. This was my veggie main course at Christmas and also an extra vegetable side for the meat eaters. Everyone loved it. It was rich, though, and I think the potatoes would have made it better. I left them out because I was also serving mashed potatoes, but for a simpler meal in the future I would put them in.

Great recipe! I used dry sherry as I didn't have white wine on hand. Added chicken-style seitan strips to the final sauce, and served it over papardelle alongside roasted brussels sprouts. Mmmmmm!

I made this for Thanksgiving for vegetarian guests. It was very simple and tasted delicious, and even non-vegetarians wanted to try it.

Made it in a vegan format- without the butter substituting coconut oil instead... so good my boyfriend is standing at the stove just eating gravy. We added a bit of molasses and coriander. What about the 90's phenomenon Steve Urkle- this recipe does not relate- but why was he popular?

DELICIOUS! This recipe for gravy that is veggie-friendly has made Thanksgiving that much more enjoyable. I made it last year and have been charged with bringing it every year from now on! My 2 vegetarian sisters and my (meat-loving) husband all loved it. I also only bought one kind of miso and used store-bought vegetable stock (Kitchen Basics - no extra sodium or preservatives). I'm tripling the recipe this year for my big family. Thanks for the tip on using nutrtional yeast on popcorn - I was at a loss for what to do with all the leftovers.

I liked this alot. My guests, though, did not seem enthusiastic. It's a rich, surprisingly lowfat gravy that would go well with just about anything. Try it with Quorn "Roast." It definitely gave life to the lentil croquettes, also found on this website.

This was pretty good, although straight-up mushroom gravy remains my favorite, and is easier. I also used 2 tablespoons of the same kind of miso (barley was all I could find) This might make a difference as the miso seemed to dominate the flavor of the sauce. Suggestion for nutritional yeast: put it on buttered popcorn. It is god's gift to movie-watchers. You'll never go back.

The ingredient list is weird on this one -- but the results are fantastic! I used regular old butter (not "Better"), homemade vegetable stock, and since it was too expensive to buy two different kinds of miso, I used 2 tablespoons of white miso. I did invest in the nutritional yeast, and now I'm looking for new recipes to incorporate it into my cooking.
