How very disappointed. So bland no flavour whatsoever. I shall not cook this again. :-(

Although I love doro wat...this recipe as it is written, cannot be used by muslims, due to the alcohol in it. Sounds yummy otherwise!

So very good! The chicken (obtained to meet Portlandia standards) was very moist (and well educated). The red onions were a bit soggy--I found myself picking them out b/c the texture was...well, gross.

Very easy recipe to make. I purchased pre-made injera which saved me a lot of time and helped the dish taste just like what I had in a restaurant.

The meal was very flavorful, rich broth with tender and moist meat. It was good enough to keep in the recipe box as well as send out to friends/family.

If you live in the DC area or where there are Ethiopian markets. it would make a world of difference if you can purchase the real berebere and spiced butter "kibe". Not sure about the lime that I have to try!

Really delicious but not quite worth all the work... Well, maybe it is. I made the berbere and spiced butter so I didn't have the time to make injera, which I missed. You should buy/make it if you're gonna have this, cause flatbread just isn't the same. Served with lightly sauteed chard and garlic, and aforementioned flatbread. However... I got 2 meals out of it because I used all the leftover broth to make red lentils the next night, which were fabulous. It was fun to experiment with all the spices and have an excuse to go to the ethiopian market (love!) but next time I'm just gonna go out to my fave restaurant.

I made the Spiced Butter and the Berbere from scratch. This recipe turned out amazing! I enjoyed it so much. Anyone who doesn't like it, didn't make it right. I will certainly be serving this to my family on a regular basis.

WEAK! I am a food lover and I thought this recipe would deliver. Alas, even my children were wondering where the flavor was.....AND, they are foodies too! Lacking....
