Ive made this several times and it never disappoints, I generally use rice vinegar instead of cider-because that's what I have. A very clean and elegant salad.

How many times do I have to keep saying "Its Tarragon!" Family loves it though everytime I make it you'd think its the first time, great, light and refreshing

Simple and delicious. It went very well with Easter dinner. Something light to go with all the ham and tarts and potatoes . . .

The dressing for this salad is superb; it really compliments the lettuce well. The tarragon was a big hit with my guests who were intrigued with the taste of the salad but couldn't quite put their finger on what it was. Excellent first course.

I made with walnut oil instead of olive oil and used champagne vinegar instead of apple cider. Was fabulous!

The dressing was light and flavorful. I subsituted a lemon champaign vinegar for the drab cider vinegar. Do it.
