I have tried this recipe once and have so many questions...so many people did it so differently. I halved the tomatoes I used, based on some reviewers' recommendations. I put them in a foil pan on the grill as my house is not air-conditioned and I won't heat the oven to 400 unless it's a national emergency. The tomatoes were from my garden, a mix of heirlooms, some over-ripe. They smelled great while cooking but when I pureed everything (food processor, I have no food mill) they are just kind of 'meh', you know? I have gone easy on the herbs, to keep the sauce versatile, but still, I expected it to be brighter. It's certainly a way to use a surfeit of tomatoes, and certainly better then canned. It's a really good blank slate to have on hand, just not a stand-alone sauce for me.

Have made this four times this summer with all the tomatoes from my garden. Have altered the recipe a bit: used a glass baking pan; liberally coated with olive oil. Cut the tomatoes in half thru the stem end and removed the core. Rubbed the cut side in the olive oil in the pan; flipped them over and used as many tomatoes as would fit comfortably in the pan. Sprinkled them with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Added some balsamic. Did not use the orange juice. Tried baking them at various temperatures and think 350-375 worked best. Added chopped garlic and herbs (liked thyme and rosemary the best) once the tomatoes started to get soft. Followed the recipe the first time and the herbs were bitter. Total baking time was about 45-60 minutes. Peeling them was a breeze. Tossed them in the food processor along with the oil left in the baking pan. Some times they got pureed; some times the sauce was chunky. Either way it was great. Have lots in the freezer for this winter. Think that the batch that was pureed will be make a great base for tomato soup.

A fantastic, easy way to use up lots of tomatoes. I use romas from my garden, change up the herbs, sometimes use the orange juice and sometimes not. It's more about the technique than anything else - much easier to roast them then run them through the food mill than mess around with a big pot on top of the stove. I make big batches, then freeze it in 1 cup portions. Homemade tomato sauce all winter!

I made this sauce using fresh, slightly overripe tomatoes from my garden. It was absolutely delicious. Instead of using fresh rosemary and thyme, I substituted dried herbes de Provence along with dried rosemary. I also used lime juice instead of orange. The result was delicious, though not as thick as I normally like my sauces. The roasted garlic added a nice touch.

This is fantastic. I normally don't take the time to add a rating, but this really was delicious. I threw some big beef tomatoes that were too soft to use for anything else in the oven, omitted the herbs and oj as I didn't have any on hand. Like others suggested, I pureed in the food processor instead of digging out the food mill. A very intense, rich, flavorful sauce- I slathered some on some crusty bread as I was packing it up- and it's low calorie, to boot! has anyone tried doing a batch of these this way on the grill?

I'll admit right up front that I didn't really follow this recipe, just used it as a starting point. Sliced and roasted tomatoes as instructed, but peeled garlic cloves instead of leaving in the paper. Left out the herbs and orange juice and instead used mint, lemon juice, and a touch of sugar. Pureed briefly in my crappy old blender to make a chunky sauce. The roasting process worked very well and gave a nice caramelized flavor to the tomatoes. I think you could use any herbs you want, added after roasting. Used fresh garden tomatoes, about 15 romas. Very delicious. Served over cubed steaks breaded in flour and parmesan and sauteed in oil. Would definitely make again.

This season provided an abundance of golden Heirloom tomatoes that I vowed would not go to waste. Large and meaty they made this recipe easy and the flavor was outrageously good. Very sweet and rich. First thought was to pair it with garlic shrimp and angel hair pasta. Will freeze and smile in December.

The recipe is a nice base to work from if you have great tomatoes. I lightly sauteed some pancetta and put it on the tomatoes to roast. I also didnt have fresh rosemary so I used dried and the sauce was still fantastic.

This recipe is easy to make and very delicious. I love tomatoes and garlic and this recipe is perfect for me. My daughter, who hates most vegetables (particularly tomatoes), likes tomato sauce. She loves this sauce and asks for it on pasta a few times a week. I've used fresh oregano and basil instead of thyme and rosemary and it's just as good. Skip the tomato juice. It's not needed. I used it the first time I made this recipe, and I choked on the sauce since the juice made the taste overpowering. I drizzle a little additional oil on top of the tomatoes before putting them in the oven. This sauce also good on sauteed zucchini. Grate two zucchini and saute them in oil until they're wilted. Add salt and pepper to taste, and throw in a handful of chopped fresh herbs (almost any combination works). Top with this sauce. It's wonderful.

This sauce has a marvelous flavor and came out very thick and rich. I did not add any herbs, as I wanted to be able to use for any and all of my recipes. The next time I make it I will cut my tomatoes in half and cook in the oven in a large roaster or stew pot and squeeze the cooked flesh out of the skins when finished. I will up the time as I am sure it will take longer as the tomato pieces will be larger. I lined my pan with foil and oiled the foil . I sliced tomatoes in 1/2 inch slices, and when they were cooked I squeezed the tomato off the skin. That is why I believe it will be much easier to just cut tomatoes in half and squeeze out the flesh after it is cooked. When flesh was squeezed out I ran through my food processor.

Followed everything, except took out tomatoes at 30 minutes, and they had been reduced to almost nothing. I used San Marzanos from my garden and the resulting sauce came to about 1 cup. The sauce did have an interesting flavor, more sun-dried tomato than anything else. But I'm not sure I would go through the trouble of making it again.

Try Reynolds Release foil. I use this or parchment whenever I roast vegetables.

This recipe is not only easy but exceptional in taste. I made this tonight with no modifications besides I didn't measure the fresh herbs and I forgot about the orange juice. It tastes excellent. I agree with the previous reviewer that if you wanted to spice it up for different occasions you could or you could use "as is". This will be permanent in my file for using fresh tomatos

I love this sauce--it's become part of my summer--my friend brings me tons of tomatoes (I made 4 batches today) and I start roasting. I follow the recipe--although it takes a while longer to cook than the recipe specifies. I just throw it in the processor, use some immediately and freeze the rest to enjoy later. Basil is a great addition, too.

I fail to see the need for the addition of the orange juice, however, to each his own. I use this as a jumping off point for all kinds of dishes, making it in batches to use our wonderful supply of garden tomatoes. I never skin the tomatoes; just put everything into the food processor when they all have a nice carmelized brown to them. Add the roasted garlic, some fresh basil and there is the base for any number of wonderful things. A great thing to have in the freezer to pull out in the dead of a cold February day...thaw, close your eyes, take in the aroma.... you could swear it was high summer again. This is the only way that I make fresh sauce anymore...no need to heat the kitchen up blanching and boiling.

I doubled this to use up some of my seemingly endless supply of garden tomatoes. I used the blender instead of a food mill because I wanted a chunky texture. Next time I'll remove the skins from the tomatoes first since the blender doesn't chop up the skins well and they're stringy after being roasted. I'm going to freeze the sauce and enjoy a little summer in the dead of our New York winter.

I will never buy bottled sauce again!! Covering the pans with foil is a MUST! I also used red wine instead of OJ and just dumped everything into a blender instead of a food mill. Is wonderful on Chicken Parmesean.

Heavenly! So easy and rich tasting. I did add a little roasted hot pepper from my garden. I made three copies of the recipe and disttibuted to my tomato growing neighbors.

We made this when no one had much energy to cook or much money for take-out. Our additions? A hot pepper and two onions, coarsly chopped. The result was a beautiful and delicious sauce with quiet a bite!

I used the surplus of tomatoes from my garden for this sauce and froze all of it to have this winter. After running the tomatoes through the foodmill, the color of the sauce was beautiful, as red as red can be! I did taste before I froze it and it is really good. I did add half the amount of orange juice that the recipe called for, and also added about a tablespoon of sugar. The beauty of this sauce is that putting it through the foodmill eliminates the lengthy chore of peeling and seeding the tomatoes.

Before I set out to pick tomatos for free at a local farm recently I found this recipe. Boy I'm glad I did. Combination of gobs of tomatoes & an easy recipe that my family loved is gratifying. I even went back a couple of days later & gathered another trunk full, just to repeat the process for the freezer. I left out the orange juice & didn't miss it. When I do this again, I'll line the sheets with heavy foil to help on the clean up. I found that my standard sized oven with the racks full would produce about a gallon of sauce. Even though the tomatoes come out looking a little charred, the flavor is great.

Oh my god this is awesome! My in-laws stopped by while I was cooking this and I gave them a tester bite. My Mama-la said that this was the best sauce she had ever tasted! Just don't cut the tomatoes too thick and line those pans with foil. I'm making this for our Soprano's Party in September!

Very flavorful sauce and easy to prepare. It's perfect for using the abundance of tomatoes and herbs in the garden. Thanks to the warnings posted earlier I lined my pans with foil and avoided the clean-up problems.

You won't be able to go back to prepared sauce after this sensory delight. It is so flavorful and has a wonderful texture. My guests kept spooning more over their pasta, so eventually we were eating sauce with pasta on the side. This is a super recipe that is a great use for tomato overload. In fact, I did not even use whole sliced tomatoes. Rather, I used the insides of tomatoes I'd scooped for a stuffed tomato recipe, and I thought it turned out perfectly.

I didn't think this was very flavorful. It seemed too watery and bland - maybe with the orange juice removed it would turn out better. I also made the mistake of not running everything through a food mill and, though I like my sauces chunky, this was a bit over the top.

I first tried this recipe when our garden was bursting with fresh tomatoes. I made several batches the first summer, changing herbs as the mood dictated. My family likes basil and oregano when we don't have fresh rosemary. We leave out the orange juice, sometimes double the garlic, and freeze to put on home made pizzas - a real treat when winter winds blow!

The first reviewer was absolutely right about the pans being a mess when you've made this sauce, and also right about this sauce being worth it. I made a triple batch out of an overabundance of beautiful garden tomatoes and it's wonderful. While it's baking (and well into the next day) my house smelled like I imagine Tuscany must smell! I froze some of my sauce, for use later.

This is a wonderful way to cook down tomatoes to a tomato sauce. I made a mistake and used 2 heads of garlic - very nice sauce. The pan was a cleanup job, but it was worth it. I made 2 batches.
