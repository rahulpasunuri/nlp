Healthy and tasty! I subbed 1 28oz can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes for the fresh and sauce and used swiss chard in place of the zucchini. My tortelini were dried, so I used just 6 oz and added them after the initial 40 min. simmer. The chard went in the last 10 minutes. Thanks, reviewers, for the heads up on the amount of herbs!

I've made this soup twice this week! As others noted, I cut back on the broth, using 4 cups and a cup of water. I also added mushrooms because I had them and took out the zucchini/bell pepper (I was out). You can also substitute a can of tomato soup in place of the the tomato sauce. Chopped bok choy is a nice addition to the end with the pasta if you have it. This will quickly become a winter staple!

So excited - my husband even loved it. We reduced the amount of beef broth and added spinach instead of zucchini and it was really really good. Also reduced the amt of spices per the other comments. This is definitely a keeper.

I have been making this for years. But heads up on this recipe. The basil and oregano amounts are wrong. It is 1/2 teaspoon of each not 2 tablespoons. I made with the 2 Tb and I knew something was off. I then found my original recipe and found the correct amount.

Excellent. Left out green bell pepper, used canned tomatoes, added extra broth and tortellini for my three teenage athletes. They WIPED IT OUT. Double batch next time. Might try it with Chorizo.

I have been making this soup for years as written and this time I used what I had on hand and it still turned out great. Instead of the sausage I used rotisserie chicken cubed, and celery instead of Zucchini and omitted the bell pepper...just as good as written but a variation.

Rating: 4
I have made this soup several times. The only thing I do differently is leave the sausage in the casings and just slice it. It is quick and easy to make and the leftovers are often even better the next day. A good hearty soup any time of the year and pairs nicely with a salad and crusty bread to sop up the leftover broth.

I used 9 baby zucchini from the market, about 2 pounds, instead of a large zucchini. I should have reduced the simmering time to 20-25 minutes for the baby zucchini. I had no tortellini, but gnocchi was a perfect substitute, cooked separately and placed in the bowl before adding soup.

Rating: 4
Agree with another reviewer that the broth should be watered down a bit. I found that a ratio of about 3 cups of broth to 1 cup of water keeps the saltiness at the perfect level. Delicious

I just made this soup for dinner tonight. I used Oktoberfest sausage links that I had on hand. I seared the sausage and set aside until the end. I sauteed all veg except for the zukes left them out until the end and threw them in before the tortellini and the sausage. I used 2 cups of crushed tomatoes which took place for the tomato sauce and fresh tomatoes. This is a hearty, fast, tasty soup.

Rating: 3
My alterations were: 1/2 lb. sweet and 1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage, and using both chicken and beef broth... I also used canned diced tomatoes... 1 can regular and 1 can roasted diced tomatoes. Last, I cut off the hard rind of the fresh parmesan cheese, and floated it on top (removing it before serving). I cooked this all in the crock pot for 4-6 hours. It was so easy and a huge hit!

This is the best soup ever. Almost a stew, actually. I used hot Italian sausages as that is what I had in the freezer, but that is the only change. I could eat this every day! A fantastic, hearty winter soup.

Rating: 3
Great soup overall but found it quite salty despite using one less cup of beef broth (bought the wrong amount so used 4 cups broth and 1 cup water) -- and that's saying a lot as I usually prefer everything on the salty side. Would back off to 3 cups broth and 2 cups water and keep the wine in the recipe. Also heeded other reviewers and used 1 tbsp of dried basil and 1/2 tbsp of ground oregano. Plenty of spice. Inadvertently left out salt and pepper before serving and found that neither was necessary.

So easy and so good. My six year old loved it. Great way to get your veggies. I also used Italian Chicken sausage and reduced the basil and oregano to 1 TBSP. Definite keeper!!

I never make changes before I try the recipe once. Now that I've made it a second time, though, I would suggest cutting the basil and oregano substantially. This time around I used a teaspoon of each and it was plenty. Otherwise, it's a keeper.

Great soup - easy to make with substitutions for what you have on hand. I used canned tomatoes, fresh herbs, chicken stock, broccoli instead of zucchini, and omitted the wine. The flavor of the soup was exceptional regardless! The sausage adds a great flavor base so it is very forgiving no matter what you do.

I used chicken broth and white wine instead of beef broth and red wine, and asparagus instead of green pepper. I also used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and a few tablespoons of tomato paste. I added the rind of a parmegianno cheese to broth and used fresh, chopped herbs instead of dry. I was very happy with the results.

This soup is outstanding! Made a few changes, i.e., used home-made chicken stock instead of canned beef broth. Didn't have canned tomato sauce, sub'd 1 T tomato paste and one 14 oz can of diced tomaotes. (omitted fresh) Sub'd broccoli for zucchini. My herbs included fresh thyme, a little dried oregano, fresh parsley and a little fresh tarragon. Didn't understand why the bell pepper and carrot wasn't sweated out with the onion and garlic, but added to the liquid, but it worked. Delicious!!

I've been making this for years - just found the recipe online again - I had it written down when I lived in Montreal and lost it in move to New Orleans - this dish is easy, easy, easy and great! I make big batches and heat it up in smaller quantities with the tortellini when I want to eat it. Always good, everyone I've ever served it to loved it...freezes well and reheats well (just don't add the tortellini until you're ready to serve it). Don't miss out on this soup - more of a stew - very hearty!

I followed this pretty much to the letter, except for subbing a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes for the chopped fresh & sauce. . . and doubling the garlic. It was tasty and perfect for a cold Philly night, but definitely not 'beyond compare'. It warrants 3 forks for ease of prep tho. I used only 1 1/2 T each of the dried basil and oregano, and thought that was almost too much - - lots of flakes swimming in the soup! Not sure whether this one will see my kitchen again.

Great soup. I substitute canned crushed tomatoes for the chopped tomatoes and I substitute 2 T tomato paste for the tomato sauce. Yields a less acidic, raw flavor I think. I also saute the vegetables and tomato paste and reduce wine by 1/2 before adding the remaining ingredients.

I too substituted a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes for the tomato and sauce, but also tossed in a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste. And I used chicken sausage, sweet Italian; and reduced the dried herbs considerably (something between 1-2 TEAspoons, was plenty.) Oh, and I cooked it all in a slow cooker for about 4-5 hours on low, cooled it overnite, cooked the tortellini separately, and warmed it all up together the next day. My husband LOVED it, I liked it, but am stingy with my stars (4 does mean, "a dish beyond compare", as I recall.) Will certainly make again -

Wonderful, simple soup. I substituted a 28oz can of diced herbed, tomatoes in juice for the sauce and fresh tomatoes, omitted the wine and tortellini, doubled the garlic, fresh basil for dried, and spicy sausage instead of plain. As a result, my soup was more 'soupy' and less stew-like.

Great recipe, will make again! Very hearty soup with great flavors. I read other reviews and used 3 cups chicken stock and 2 cups of beef stock and was definitely salty enough. I forgot to add in the basil and oregano but neither me nor my boyfriend missed it. I'm lactose intolerant, so couldn't eat too many cheese tortellinis, but the soup in and of itself was great. A lot of slicing and chopping but all worth it.

Rating: 3
This was so easy and really tasty. I used 3/4 lb hot italian sausage and 3/4 lb sweet italian sausage (not links, just crumbled, to save time) which gave the soup a little extra kick without being too spicy. For beef stock, I substituted 3 cups chicken broth and 2 cups canned low- sodium beef broth based on previous comments and found the soup just salty enough. Also used three cans of petite diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce. All good suggestions since the soup turned out great and was so easy to put together. I would recommend bringing the soup to a boil after adding all of the veggies, and then to let it simmer for the rest of the cooking time. I also cooked the tortellini separately and poured the hot soup over them in the bowl so they didn't overcook. Didn't need Parmesan. The presentation was attractive and the taste was great. My husband commented that it tasted like a great Italian sauce over the pasta and I agree - it was a very hearty soup in that way. Will definitely make this again - a keeper.

I make this soup often and love it. Beef broth really should be homemade, so if I don't have enough on hand I'll use half chicken broth. Must serve with crusty bread, and when reheating I add a little water, to keep it thin. The soup is so flavorful, it only get better day by day. Just make sure to add tortellini in right before you serve.

There are so many changes that can be made to this soup, that in the end I hardly recognized it. First, I used spicy hotlink sausage (from Evergood) instead of Italian. I omited the bell pepper. I used 1 can crushed tomatos instead of the tomato and sauce combo that the recipe calls for. It ended up being very similar to one of my favorite soups, "spicy sausage and cabbage soup" only without the cabbage. Next time I will leave out the Tortellini (which I didn't think added much to the overall recipe) and add 1 small head of cabbage, finely chopped. It was tasty the way I made it, but I think omiting the tortellini and adding some cabbage would make it even better. Anyway, we all loved it and ate it all!

I use turkey sausage instead of pork to cut down on calories and grease, substitute low sodium chicken broth for the beef, and use a large can of crushed tomatoes with added puree instead of the chopped tomatoes and sauce.

This soup is SO delicious. I doubled the garlic. I substituted one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 2 T. tomato paste for the fresh tomoatoes and can tomato sauce, which I believe toned down the acidic/raw flavor of the soup. After cooking the sausage/onions/garlic, I sauted the vegetables till tender, then briefly cooked the tomato paste, then added the wine and reduced (to get rid of the alcohol flavor), and finally added the tomatoes. Turned out wonderfully. Served alongside Stromboli.

We thought this was great tasting, though a little heavy as others have commented. I kept true to the recipe with the exception of using less oregano and using fresh basil.

This is in regular rotation for me. My "always changes": use hot italian sausage, reduce basil and oregano to 1 tbsp each, increase (veggie) stock to 6 cups, and never use any tortellini. Also, I remove sausages from their casings before browning. I keep their shape during browning, putting them into the soup nicely sliced. So flavorful, so satisfying. So good! Highly recommended.

Easy soup that's great for a cool weather weeknight supper or potluck. I use a large can of plum tomatoes instead of fresh & add fresh basil at the end, also up the garlic by a couple cloves. Improves by adding some brown mushrooms in with the onions. Like a lot of soups, this is a good way to use up the odd veggie you might have in the fridge before they go south. As for soggy tortellini when reheated, that may be, but I've never had enough leftovers to be an issue!

This is a great recipe. I'm a poor college student and I could afford the ingredients pretty reasonably. And as a college student it was great to have something taste homecooked and hearty.

This is an awesome, hearty soup. I've made it over a dozen times - a real winner for pot-luck dinners. Suggestions: the sausage adds a lot of salt - stick with low sodium everything - veg broth, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes. Skim fat after it has simmered a while - more will render off the sausage. I double the zuch & add yellow squash too. A head of escarole, chopped, dropped in at the same time as the tortellini is excellent too. Oh - I use beer instead of wine - it works quite well. A+++ Highly recommend!

Very tasty. I made a few alterations for convenience: For the 5 cups broth, I used 1 aseptic box of beef broth (this is 4 cups) plus 1 can low sodium chicken broth.

There really are many possibilities for a lot of different variations of this soup. Use twice the garlic and 1/2 the herbs. I added mushrooms and green beans. Spinach would be great, as well. I use lean turkey italian sausage...you really don't miss the fat...promise. Just need to add some olive oil because there is a lack of necessary drippings once the sausage is cooked. Beef broth and red wine or chicken broth and white wine...it works both ways. Canned diced tomatoes will work in a pinch.

I made this soup and was blown away by the outcome! It was absolutely incredible! I did tweak it a little, (I used regular sage sausage because I was in a hurry and couldn't find the other)- I just cooked it separately in a pan and then drained the grease. I also added chopped celery, extra carrots and zucchini and cooked those on the stove with olive oil to save cooking time. I simmered the garlic and added that in with the vegetables and onion powered since my husband doesn't care for onions. When the veges were cooked through (about 10 min on med-high) I added the beef broth, sherry and an Italian all-spice to cut cost. Stirred in the cooked tortellini and sausage and simmered for 30 min. It was FABULOUS!! Will def make this again and pass on to friends. I give this 10 stars! North Carolina Cook

This is just wonderful - was making it for the 3rd time for our dinner,when my 8 year old had a few friends over...they couldn't wait to eat it - it became their afternoon snack - haven't found anyone who doesn't like this one - easy to cook and everyone is happy all you need is a salad and some bread!

Very easy to make and a real winner. Every year we have a New Years Dinner for a group of our friends. Last year was based upon Italian cooking. This soup was an overwhelming success. None left and demands for the recipe.

I would probably make this recipe again, but not without a few changes. It appears that other reviewers liked the soup across the board, but I wasn't that wild about it. First, I thought it was very heavy; second it had a few too many flavors going on. The sausage itself is complex, as it is both hot and sweet (from the fennel seeds), and the sausage competes with the tortellini. The pork flavor of the sausage also competes with the flavor of the broth. One reviewer substituted white wine for red and chicken broth for beef (these are pretty big changes); I might try this and additionally substitute bacon for sausage. Of course, at that point it will be a completely new recipe! It gets high marks for ease of preparation, though.

O.K. I almost never review, but this one was a cut above most. Other than subbing Italian hot for sweet, and asparragus for zuchinni, I followed the recipe as written. It's easy, and it has an interesting flavour which reminds me of some of the dishes I experienced in an Italian kitchen while growing up. This is an inexpensive, yet flavourful dish which will now have a place in my regular rotation. HOLD YOUR CARDS.........WE HAVE A WINNER!!!

This was so yummy that I didn't even get a chance to add the tortellini - my 8 year old had friends over while I was making it and they were hungry and each had a bowl - the mom keeps asking for the recipe - this one is easy, kid friendly and tasty! a Keeper.

This reicpe was easy to follow and came out perfect! I was very surprised by this recipe I am not a soup fan and almost never eat soup. I have made this three times now it is so good! Only change I made was removal of garlic due to alergies. 2 Tablespoons of herbs worked great there's so much flavor in the soup they did not over power it at all.

Easy to make and give you a great base to make other similar soups. I usually add mushrooms and a bit of garlic salt- YUM! Everyone who I make this for wants the recipe.

This recipe earned rave reviews around the table -- and it was easy. This will be a repeat. I changed to chicken broth, italian chicken sausage and a dry white wine and, upon the suggestion of another reviewer, reduced the herbs to 1 TBSP each. Be great with some pesto dolloped on top of each serving.

One of the tastiest soups I have ever made & I followed the recipe exactly - not necessary to change anything.

I used chicken sausage with sundried tomato instead of Italian sausage but will try it that way too. Any sausage would give this soup a unique flavor. I also thought 2 tbls of herbs was too much and used one of each and it was fine. Will defintely make this again before winter is over.

This is probably one of my favorite soups. I've made it twice this winter and loved it each time. I always double the recipe and use half hot and half sweet sausage as someone else had recommended - and I'd never make it any other way!

Rating: 3
I made this soup twice. The first time I used Swanson beef broth and canned diced tomatoes as well as the full 2 Tbsp. of oregano and basil. I thought the herbs were a bit overpowering and that the soup lacked depth. The second time I used Campbell's double strength beef broth, fresh diced tomatoes and reduced each herb to 2 tsps. The results weere much more to my taste. However, we still prefer the Italian Sausage Soup recipe submitted by Karen Marshall on the allrecipes.com web site.

Based on the great reviews, I would like to try this soup, but I don't have any red wine, only white. Has anyone substituted the wine, or omitted it altogether?

Rating: 4
The soup is simmering as I type and looks fabulous. I just added the spices w/o even questioning quantity - but when I dumped them and saw the pile there, thought to myself - way too much! Did I ruin it? Tell me no. **Just to update - the soup was wonderful. I was concerned that there was just too many dried herbs floating around, so I took a paper towel and dipped it in the soup, and the herbs stuck to it. I did this several times until I felt I got a good amount out. Didn't add the tortellini as I was making for someone to eat later. Just included it in a separate container and told them to bring soup to simmer and add tortellini for the 8 minutes. I would make again even w/o the tortellini - it is such a hearty soup.

I have made this a few times now and even my hardest to please loved this . Of course I did only use half the spices and I used home made chicken broth instead of beef .

This is a staple recipe for me. I like to use sweet turkey sausage to lighten it up a bit. (You won't miss the fat). I also add a dash of red pepper to give it a little heat. Freshly grated parmesan is a must! Glass of red wine too. Cheers!

Rating: 4
This is a truly wonderful recipe. I doubled it for a dinner party and followed it exactly, except I added leeks, which I have found to enhance the flavor of just about any soup. I used a combination of spinach-and-ricotta and mozzarella-and-pepperoni tortellini along with mini garlic-and-cheese ravioli (my market carries a good variety of Buitoni's specialty pastas.) This was very hearty, very much a meal in itself. One of our neighbors brought over freshly made, still-warm Italian bread. What a treat, especially with my father's homemade chianti, which I also used in the soup.

Rating: 3
Would rate a 2.5 forks when first cooked then elevate to 3 forks when served the day after. Next time will cook the veggies in soup and refrigerate to allow flavors to marry, then continue cooking with the tortellini the day I want to serve it. I used 2.5 c. each of chicken, and beef stock. Added 1 diced potato and fresh basil and oregano from my garden. Made with a spicy, meaty chorizo that gave it the right amount of heat. Served with a home baked thyme and oregano focaccia. A chunky, hearty and filling soup.

This is a regular at our house for Christmas Eve dinner. We serve it with meats, cheeses and crackers. Kids love it. A useful tip is to make only as much tortellini as you will be eating the first time you serve the soup. Make fresh tortellini the next day to add to the soup, otherwise the day old pasta tends to bloat and tastes bland. Enjoy!

I made this for company and as it was a new recipe, I was a little nervous, as soups can be so "iffy". I was pleasantly surprised as the guests raved...especially the men! I served this with crusty homemade oat bread and a huge salad with homemade vinegrette. My husband is still talking about it! I cut the oregano in half, used half hot and half mild Italain sausage and half canned and half fresh tomatoes. I also cut the green pepper and onion in half..EXCELLENT!

I found that it was a bit heavy handed with the oregano and basil - next time I will use less and put herbs into a cheesecloth bag. I also used two small zucchini instead of one large and quartered them lengthwise and cut into 1/2 inch slices - it worked out beautifully. All in all a very tasty and satisfying soup.

I will use less sausage next time - maybe even half of what the recipe calls for. It overpowered the flavor of the veggies and tortellini, and made it far too meaty for my taste. I used turkey "hot" italian sausage with terrific results. A very easy, tasty and hearty soup.

I made this exact recipe using chicken rather than sausage. I browned a 3 large breasts and then broke into pieces, letting it finish cooking in the soap. I pretty much doubled the recipe -- used 6 cups chicken broth and 3 cups beef broth. It was awesome. I will try with sausage as well, but the chicken was just great!

Delicious! The broth is just yummy, and all the ingredients make this a hearty, filling soup. I used a Sangiovese for the broth that also went well with the soup during dinner. I used Italian turkey sausage, which didn't make the required drippings for sauteeing the onions and garlic, so I ended up using a tablespoon of olive oil. Also, I used a pecorino & potato mini ravioli instead of tortellini, and I think it makes a very nice ingredient to this.

If I could give this 3 1/2 forks I would. My husband said it would be 4 forks had I used Hot Italian Sausage rather than Chorizo. I wanted to use up the remainder from another dish and saw this recipe. It still came out wonderfully. I took the advise of others and doubled the garlic and 1/2 the oregano and basil. Looking forward to making this again soon.

Just like most of the previous cooks, I thought this soup was delicious-definitely serve the second day.

Just plain great. It's a meal in inself. I added too much tortellini and everybody liked it that way. More stew-like. I also added more garlic. Too much garlic is never enought. I couldn't find a 14.8 oz can of Italian tomatoes, so I used stewed Italian tomatoes with basil and organo. Still came out good. My husband would like to have more sausage in it. Just a wonderful dish for family and friends. Great dish for Super Bowl cooked in one pot.

I have made this before and loved it .. I do think though that the amount of oregano and basil are way... tooo much .... I cut them back to 1 T. each and I think the next time I will do even less ... Way too much .. I think it must be a mistake .. Char

Wasn't too crazy for this recipie. Found that although I drained the drippings after cooking the sausage, the end result was a little greasy. I will admit I didn't follow the recipie to a T. Didn't have the zucchini so substituted a celery rib instead and also used a 28 oz can of roma tomatoes along with a tablespoon of tomato paste as didn't have the fresh tomatoes called for on hand. I found it OK, but nothing outstanding. Won't bother with it again.

Excellent soup with many variables to personalize to taste. We prefer adding a box of frozen spinach cooked to package specs and a little more good red wine. Also, cooked tortelini in seperate pot of salted water, drained and then added. This saved some of the broth. Even my mother-in-law pretends to to like me when she knows I'm fixing this.
