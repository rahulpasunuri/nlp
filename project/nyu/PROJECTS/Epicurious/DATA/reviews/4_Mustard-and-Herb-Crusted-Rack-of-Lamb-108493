Excellent,used thyme instead of mint, used food processer for herbs and bread crumbs, gave coating nice consistency.

Have been making this recipe for quite some time now but haven't gotten around to rating it. I usually don't bother to sear the lamb, just rub the mustard mix on the rack and let sit in the fridge for 2-4 hrs, then pat on the panko etc and roast. Always turns out terrific and is a requested dish among family and friends. Served this Easter with goat cheese potato gratin also on this site, steamed asparagus, and of course, deviled eggs!

Ok, but I wouldn't make this one again. Too much breadiness seems to overwhelm the delicate flavor of the lamb.

Tried placing rack in 425 oven first, then applied the dressing; saved time and mess of cleaning a different pan. Also bought premium rack of lamb and it makes a difference, so tender.

This was my first time cooking lamb as well. Everyone who liked lamb just raved about it. I would not change the recipe.

Excellent dish! I also used panko crumbs and substituted thyme for the mint as that was what I had in the garden. If you have a Trader Joe's near you, the rack of lamb in the fresh meat zone is wonderful and costs less than most places. The sweet potato oven fries (also from TJ's) were a perfect pairing.

I love when lamb is cooked right, and this was soo good! It was my FIRST TIME EVER cooking lamb, so I was pretty nervous, adding the fact that lamb is so expensive! I studied lamb recipes for a while and decided this was what I wanted, and I also liked Gordon Ramsay's Rack of Lamb how to video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6HDmeMRtI , by the way pretty identical to this recipe. The lamb turned out perfect and couldn't believe how easy it was. I did make sure my lamb was room temperature before I started cooking it. I was interested in moroccan/greek sauces to top it off (not that this recipe needs it all), anyone have any suggestions??? :)

This is my absolute "go to" recipe when I make rack of lamb. It is a family favorite, especially at Easter. Here is a picture and my review: http://www.ajinthekitchen.com/imported-20110212231825/2011/4/26/mustard-and-herb-crusted-rack-of-lamb.html

We have made this recipe about a dozen times and every time we are surprised with how good it is and how easy it is to make. It is like having a 4 star dinner and a 1 star budget from a time perspective. Plus really hard to mess up.

Excellent recipe and pretty easy. It's funny how most people find lamb so mysterious and yet not that hard to cook. Do not omit the mint as this adds great dimension to the flavor.

Rating: 4
Elegant and easy. I seared it in a cast iron pan then transferred to oven. 25 minutes and it was perfect! Tender and flavorful. I used the herbs I had on hand, mint and rosemary and cut the breadcrumbs to 3/4 a cup for 8 ribs. Serve this with Moroccan Styled Carrots, creamed peas, and couscous for a lovely dinner.

so good, really pretty easy, esp if you use one overproof skillet for searing and baking (fewer dishes!) the herbs are pretty interchangeable, though i do like to use fresh  i used parsley, thyme and rosemary because no mint.

This is THE recipe for rack of lamb. I used my own variation of herbs and seasonings, plenty of garlic, celtic sea salt, and I skipped the breadcrumbs and mustard. The results were astounding. Some of my guests even said it was the best meal they had ever had. Wow!

Rating: 4
Classic, simple, and delicious. I used this for date night "in" and used thyme and sage in lieu of the mint and parsley. Cooked 20 minutes for a perfect med-rare.

I don't understand the poor rating from the reviewer from Dallas for a recipe that works and is really tasty. Everyone I've served this lamb to has enjoyed it immensely. I'd disagree with that reviewer that this is a boring recipe. Instead, I call it classic, in the same way that a simply prepared rack of lamb like this and a bottle of Bordeaux is classic - not to mention delicious. This is a solid, basic technique for lamb that turns out well every time, but the recipe is also extremely versatile as any number of wet ingredients could be substituted for the mustard and other seasonings for the herbs.

Used Panko instead of regular breadcrumbs giving it a nice, light crunch. Kept the mustard to a nice thin layer, which kept the mustard from overpowering the flavor. Will definitely make this again.

This was super easy and really tasty. I didn't have plain bread crumbs so I had to use Italian flavored (which actually just added extra flavor). Maybe I didn't add enough mustard, but I found it not overpowering at all, as a few other reviews did, thought it was perfect! Easy and incredibly elegant.

this recipe was so easy and quick to make! I made it for 3 very different but very picky people and they all agreed that this was the BEST lamb that they had ever tasted!!

Wonderful. The mustard and herb crust worked well on the steak that I made for the one non-lamb lover in the group, too.

This is a hit every time I make this. I tend to do it with a boneless leg of lamb instead of the rack.

This is not such a good way to make lamb loin. I would of just rather had it seasoned on the grill. And after all the time it takes to make the sauce it was just there.

Rating: 3
Even though it may be very basic I use this recipe over and over. A simple mixture of Herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, basil, bay leaf, thyme, lavender) with breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne over the seared lamb with mustard is very nice for me. It isn't fancy but very tasty and simple. Use your personal taste to determine how much of what ingredient to use and it will be very nice. I prefer to have mine with a béarnaise or hollandaise if I feel like making a sauce or I enjoy eating it alone with a nice bottle of red and a green salad.

Made this a few times. Really good. Didn't bother with browning first. Just cooked it a tiny bit longer and used a good meat thermometer. Served with a cranberry port sauce. Everyone enjoyed it!

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor and BEAUTIFUL presentation. The only thing I will do next time is cook the rack a tiny bit longer (like 5 to 7 minutes). But everyone loved the meal. I also served it with the Wild Mushroom Potato Gratin which was perfect. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Easy, quick prep and company worthy. Cooking time is longer - 30-35 minutes for medium rare. The Wild Mushroom Potato Gratin is a must.

This is BY FAR my favorite rack of lamb recipe. I always go thru my pantry for the breading and have used combinations of raisin english muffins, hamburger & hotdog buns, heels of bread, bagels....whatever's around and it ALWAYS comes out great! Now I keep the extra bread cruumbs in the freezer to use next time or on a pork tenderloin. YUMMMM!!!!

I have made this dish so many times I just had to write in and rave. I have always just thrown in any and all herbs, not just what is called for, and it always turns out perfect. I have also put this mixture on pork tenderloin and it totally seals in the juices. I LOVE THIS DISH!!!!

Great. Just cooked rack in oven- no need to brown first. Sauteed the crumbs briefly to make more crispy.

Lamb never tasted so good! No overwhelming flavor here. The crust was perfect. I served with haricot verts and whipped sweet potatoes.

Nice recipe, but try the "RACK OF LAMB WITH MUSTARD-THYME CRUST" from this site - much less fuss with equal or better results! Who could ask for more.

Made this recipe for two. Go easy on the mustard, it can overpower the other flavors. Cooked it on top of the stove in a cast iron skillet and then moved it to the oven for 22 minutes. Perfection. Will definitely do this again!

Excellent recipe, but the breadcrumbs detracted from the dish. Would make again with more spices and no breadcrumbs.

yummy although time consuming & slightly messy. while i'd make again, i think there are better lamb recipes unless you are looking for a mustard-based dish.

This dish was excellent! I didn't cut enough of the fat off the top of the racks but otherwise, this dish will be a permanent addition to my recipe collection. The instant read thermometer is a must.

Great way to use fresh herbs and we love Dijon mustard. Not time-consuming but well worth the small effort.

Brilliant! Wonderful and easy. Be careful not to overdo the mustard, a little is all you need, or the oil in the breadcrumb mixture. Great for a small dinner party.

I made this dish for a dinner party. It was a huge hit. It needs to be baked for 30 minutes for med. rare. I did not alter to recipe.

Made this exactly as written except I used panko for the crumbs. THis is a great recipe and I would not make any other changes. Highly recommended.

Easy and Delicious! I too cooked longer than the suggested time. Maybe 35 minutes? My lamb was a pretty fatty though, on the inside. Any advice on how to pick a more lean rack?

I am doing this recipe for my culinary competion team. Fast, easy, and delicious. Frenching the bones is the hardest part of this dish.

Made this for my wife and she ate like I've never seen before. Wonderful flavor. Quick and easy. Needed to cook another 4 min beyond recommended time. Highly recommend!

I made this recipe for my lamb-loving husband for Valentine's Day dinner. I'm not a big lamb person, but it was so good I can't even tell you. I made it with wild mushroom potato gratin and minted pea puree, both recipes also from this site. My husband said it was the best meal he has ever had, at home or in a restaurant. I would have to agree!

I have made several rack of lamb recipes from epicurious and this is by far the best and easiest to make. This time, I took someone else's suggestion and used Panko breadcrumbs and it was even better - you just need to finish off under broiler for a minute to brown before taking out. Made this with two other winter recipes from epicurious: roasted butternut squash with nutmeg & sauteed spinach and pancetta. Both also great

I used Panko. This one is a KEEPER.

Excellent recipe - the coating made with fresh bread crumbs and herbs was easy to prepare in a small food processor and complimented the lamb very well. Cooked for almost 30 minutes for medium rare - medium. Will definitely make again!

this was excellent. It is really easy if you chop all the herbs in a small food processor. we cooked it exactly 20 minutes and it iwas perfectly medium rare to rare. The wild mushroom potato gratin in the same issue is perfect with it as is the rest of the menu in the Gourmet article.

This is an easy and fast recipe, everybody loved it. My husband even liked it better than most restaurants.I made it with mashed potatoes and since it doesn't give you any gravy I made it with brown wine sauce.

Excellent and easy! I served it with pesto sauce and it was a definite hit at our house.
