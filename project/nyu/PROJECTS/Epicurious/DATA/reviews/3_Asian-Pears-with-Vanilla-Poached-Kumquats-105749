It's a wonderful dessert, very light and aromatic, not at all an ordinary fruit salad. It looks presentable on the table - I serve it in a crystal bowl or individual stemmed parfait cups so everyone gets the syrup. I'm making it since 2001 when it first appeared in Gourmet and it always received guests' attention. Extremely easy to make, but you must use all the ingredients, vanilla bean is very important - don't try to substitute with vanilla extract or other subs.

I don't understand what other reviewers see in this dish. It's a very straightforward and fairly boring fruit salad.

a very special and wonderful, aromatic fruit salad. i served it during the holidays and my family absolutely loved it. my son says it tastes like "cologne"...it is sweet and perfumey. that's a good thing!

This is very simple (except for taking seeds out of kumquats, but some people don't mind a few of those seeds)and it is worth it. A really delightful dessert and different. It keeps well, too. 3 times I've made it, and have tried adding a few fresh blueberries to the finished dessert, they blend well, but aren't lost in the flavor mix, if you like a variation.

VERY EASY TO PREPAIR. THE FLAVORS BLEND VERY NICELY. THE LIME JUICE BLENDS NICELY WITH WITH THE CRISPY ASIAN PEARS. THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO A BRUNCH OR THANKSGIVING FEAST.
