This is an absolutely decadent and delicious treat. It's become a Christmas morning tradition in our house, and we look forward to it all year. I have to disagree with the other reviewers though, it is a LOT of work. You basically have to plan around it for an entire day, which to me counts as a difficult recipe even if the labor itself isn't terribly complicated. This is why I save it for one day a year! It's worth doing though, the results are incredible. (Oh - and my springform pan died so I've made this in 2 9" round cake pans with no trouble removing the rings at the end.)

This was fabulous, a huge hit at a coffee I hosted for new neighbors. The croissant dough is a bit time-consuming to make, but not difficult and I found it a fun experience. The finished product is both delicious and impressive!

I made a mistake when I read this recipe and bought the dough in the dairy department of my local supermarket. When I realized my mistake I was sure the entire debacle would end up in the trash, but I persevered. To my surprise, the store bought dough rised while baking and except for a bit of dryness was quite delicious. When I make it next, I will add a bit of butter and raisins and or apples to the sugar mixture before rolling. Then to the steusel topping a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar and only bake it for 30-35 min.

A "three inch stick of cinnamon". That means it is most probably Cassia Cinnamon.I like cassia, especially fresh ground cassia; however, two things, one is that cassia is difficult to grind (you can bust a coffee grinder trying), and two, this great recipe really needs Ceylon Cinnamon.I found an online called Juliet Mae Spices. They sell different kinds of fresh ground cinnamon and they will help you pick according to recipe and personal preference. The world is bigger than cassia.

This is phenomenal!!! I agree with the previous review, this is a lot easier than it sounds. The hardest part was getting up early to take the dough out to rise. :) I can't attest to its freezability for both rings were gone before the coffee cooled. Friends have even requested it as a birthday cake. The second time I increased the spice and added cardamom. Very nice. I'm curious what finely chopped nuts would add. Though I have only made this in Seattle, I trust it will work as well in Denver. I will make this again and again.

Amazingly delicious!, from one who cares. Made with 8% protein pastry flour from gourmet supply, Challenge unsalted butter. I erred the first time by not halving the croissant dough and actually baking one monster of a coffee cake. It rose 2" over the top of the springform pan BEFORE baking. Final was probably 3" over. I added ~50% more streusel because I love that kind of thing. Good thing I put a baking sheet underneath because it oozed lots of butter. Am making second effort now with just regular flour to see if it makes noticeable difference. Have doubled recipe as it disappeared in under 2 days the first time! Will make in abundance for holiday gifts, beautifully wrapped and labeled.

I made this for an afternoon tea baby shower and it was very popular. Everyone loved that cinnamon taste and it was perfect with tea or coffee. Presentation was very nice, as it's a little bit different to other plates of cookies, square cakes etc. The croissant dough is far superior to any bought croissants and most bakery croissants. It was not a hassle to make the dough, I found it quite soothing and relaxing to keep rolling out the dough! You can make more as it freezes well.

Be not afraid! I know when you read this recipie you thik, 17 hours,- no way! But it was not as bad as you think most of the time is spent letting your dough sit in the fridge. This is the one of the best coffee cakes ever, everybody thought that I bought it for the brunch I had. The dough is incredible and makes two princess rings- perfect for Easter brunch or a special gathering. - Tracy B.

I won a blue ribbon for this coffee cake the first time I made it. Getting through the directions is the hardest part of this recipe because it was simple to make. No, really. I am not a beginner, but I think a beginner could handle it. And so good. This is it. The one to impress. The one for everyday. The one you just sit and think about how good it was! Have fun.
