this was great! even tried it with a pork roast - baked acorn squash rings and served the stuffing in the rings. yum!

My family loves stuffing with fruit so this was a hit. I love figs but may try with prunes to eliminate seediness. Replaced chicken with vegetable broth for our vegetarians and it came out great. Added more broth than called for but have found when cooking separately (not in the turkey) that's always needed.

I had high hopes for it, but it came out too bland. Partly this was my own mistake, I live with a person who hates onions so I omitted from recipe and added some garlic, but should have substituted with another savory element. Next time I will add pancetta or a savory chicken sausage. I used 2 loaves of rosemary ciabatta bread, which was quite nice. I had to add 2+ cups of extra broth, and even melted some butter in the broth. Once I got the right moisture content, it baked perfectly.

Even though I used double the amount of broth, it was still way too dry. It needed more flavor and there was way too much left.

This is the best stuffing I have ever had. My family loved it.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Made it with the turkey on Thanksgiving. I used ciabatta rolls rather than a loaf so that there was more crust and texture. The blend of sweet and savory flavors and seasonings was wonderful.

I usually only make the Italian Bread and Sausage Stuffing for Thanksgiving, but had guests this year that don't eat pork. I came across this recipe and gave it a go. It was an absolute hit (even with my guests that don't normally enjoy dried fruit). I did forget to soak the fruit ahead of time (too many recipes going at once), but threw the broth and fruit in the microwave together for 2min and it did the job perfectly. I used fresh panella bread from the bakery cut into large 1-2" chunks, and definitely needed the extra broth to moisten things up. The cut up fruit and herbs made a beautiful presentation (I baked it in an oval casserole dish). My guests asked to take leftovers home, which, to me, is a sign of a good recipe. :) I will definitely keep this in my repertoire.

Sorry to report it was boring. It was fine, just nothing special. It does need much more broth than the recipe states to get it remotely moist.

This was easy assemble and was a nice light alternative to the meat-filled stuffing. Having said that, I prefer stuffing with a little sausage. I will try adding meat next time to give it more flavor and moisture. I did add more broth which helped. The next day it was even better.
