Amazing Kugel have made it over & over for family holidays. My kids love it! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, reduced the sugar a bit & used organic cornflakes. Delish!!!

This kugel is ok, nothing special and I've made it twice. The noodles stay at the bottom of the pan in a layer rather than mixing with the other ingredients. Maybe this is because they are not precooked? Too much butter for my family's taste, so I reduced it to just a couple tablespoons on second try. Added more sugar (wasn't sweet enough first time). This is certainly an easy kugel to make, just not terrific. A little bland.

Fantastic! Truly the easiest kugel I've ever made. I added a little bit of vanilla and almond extracts, as well as a dash of cinnamon. Also, I didn't have Cornflakes so I used Smart Start. It all came together perfectly and everyone loved it. This is an incredibly versatile recipe! I love the idea of adding dried fruits and/or nuts. Will definitely try that next time!

Just took a chance and made it for Passover, with Matzo, broken into pieces instead of noodles and a 2/3 cup of Xylitol, the best sugar substitute. Even like that, it came out great! I added cottage cheese, as I always do and an 1/2 cup of plain yougurt (Xylitol is said to dry things up a little). Also, I was out of butter, so I used vegetable oil instead. With all these changes, still an excellent result.

I made this recipe once at home, and it was pretty good, but not AMAZING. Now away at college, I was in the mood for it again. I read the reviews and made it with 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1/3. I didn't want to get brown sugar and regular corn flakes, since i probably wouldn't use either for anything else, so I decided to try it with frosted flakes, and it turned out great!! I also used barilla plus penne instead of the wide egg noodles it called for. everything else I kept the same. Tastes fantastic, definitely better than the first time. I got vanilla but forgot to add it, if i make it again i'll have to make sure i remember!

So easy and delicious, WITH SOME CHANGES. Made it 3 times, even once with a sugar substitute, which worked out great. Added cottage cheese, vanilla, more sour cream. I don't like things overly sweet, but it does need more sugar than the recipe states. You could use less butter, but then add more sour cream or milk. As to the cottage cheese, just dump it on the dry noodles, after you throw in the raisins. Another good variation - instead of raisins (or in addition to) - throw in a box of pitted prunes - soooo good. I didn't use cornflakes, I had coconut granola, and I just mixed it with very little sugar, and sprinkled it lightly on top, far less than the amount suggested. I think if you use too much on top, it will overwhelm the overall taste. Do cover it, once the top browns and I agree that it needs about 1,25 - 1,5 hours in the oven

This kugel was far from my favorite. I used some of the suggestions of the reviewers but felt that overall, this kugel lacked the lovely delicate flavors that so many other noodle kugels have. I used some apples, but found their flavor and texture blended right in with the noodles and was sorry I put them in. I wished I'd added more raisins and dates like my Mom's has. I'm used to a noodle kugel where each ingredient adds its own unique flavor and each can be tasted equally. Overall, I felt this was bland and had too few flavors to really be very good. Also, since the noodles cooked in the dish, rather than beforehand, they weren't able to crisp on the top like they do if they are cooked beforehand. I will not make this recipe again.

THE EASIEST recipe ever! It was also delicious and a big hit at our family dinner. I did adjust the recipe to try and resemble more like my grandma used to make. I cut the butter in half, and also added two tsp. of vanilla, and 2 tsp. or cinnamon, also added about three tablespoons more of sour cream. It was awsome!!!!

First time eating Kugel. Loved it. Accidentally left out the raisins, still yummy. A little sweeter than I expected and extremely rich (even though I used skim milk instead of whole). Definitely will make again.

Never having made a Kugel, I was skeptical about starting with uncooked noodles but this really works and was delicious. This is on the less sweet side of kugels (which is my preference). Nothing lost by using 1% milk and cutting the butter a bit.

Great recipe, except the top got burned, so I suggest you cover it as soon as the top browns. Made two variations, one with some added cottage cheese, and as others suggested - some vanilla and just a tiny bit of cinnamon, and more sugar. The second one - didn't add the cottage cheese, didn't add the cinnamon, and substituted raisins with mango flavored pineapple chunks. Came out great. I like the one with NO cinnamon better.

I made a recipe and a half to use an entire bag of noodles... I used whole wheat egg noodles and fat free milk and it turned out great. Next time I'll cut down on the butter because I felt it was too much, but I will definitely make this recipe again! My boyfriend and his family decided this recipe was the best they've ever had.... We all recommend it!

Perfect, with changes suggested by other reviewers: -changed butter to 1/2 stick -increased sugar to 1/2 cup -substituted 2 apples chopped and sauteed in butter for raisins -added 2 tsp vanilla -added 2 tsp cinammon & dash nutmeg -used lowfat sour cream -cooked for 1.5 hours My guests said it was the best kugel they ever tasted. Very moist and not too heavy. Flavors were delicate. Served it for brunch and it was heavenly. No more cooking the noodles first for me!

Couldn't be easier or more fool-proof. I substituted dried cranberries (which are a little tarter and get less bloated and mushy than raisins) and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Next time I may try the cottage cheese or yogurt variations. This one's a winner!

This received rave reviews at a New Year's brunch. Following others' suggestions I made the following changes: cut butter to 1/4 cup; left off topping; added 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon; 3/4 t. salt. I used whole milk, but subbed light sour cream. I used dried cranberries I had on hand but any combo of dried fruit would work well. It took almost 1.5 hours to cook. Great lighter version of a kugel and very easy to prepare.

I am Christian, my husband is Jewish. Every year we have a party to celebrate the first night of Hanukah with our friends. This year I wanted to try to cook something special, so I used this recipe. EVERYONE at the party wanted to know how I made it. A friend of ours who is Jewish said "I'm a kugel connisseur and this is great!!" It was the hit of the party. Thanks for making me look good!! It's now my new yearly tradition for our party.

loved this sooo easy and because the noodles are not pre-cooked it does not get mushy. The topping added a little crunch. You could probably get away with less butter though.

I made this for recipe club and it was a big hit! I followed some of the suggestions and increased the sugar to 2/3 cup. I also added 3 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. it was really yummy and not too sweet! I think I baked it a little too long because it wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be so next time I'll decrease the cooking time. will definitely be making it again! even my kids wanted to try it because of a recent episode of the Wizards of Waverly Place (on Disney Channel) where they made kugel!

My Jewish husband loved this dish. I am a gentile so kugel is a new concept to me. This kugel was a big hit in our house. He said it was exactly as his mother used to make it. At first he was not into the cereal crust. I offered to make it again for him without the crust but he told me he now likes the crust and to not change a thing. This recipe is great!

I have to take the minority view on this kugel. I thought it was quite bland. I served it on a buffet table, and everything was gobbled up with the exception of the kugel, which in my opinion was pretty tasteless.

Extremely easy! I mixed all the wet ingredients (including some vanilla, a little extra sugar, some cinnamon and nutmeg) the night before and then just poured over the noodles in the morning (I did not do the topping). I got ready while it baked and it was ready for an early brunch! Everyone loved it.

This was definitely a crowd pleaser on Boxing Day brunch. I substituted dried cherries, blueberries and cranberries for raisins, and plain yogurt for sour cream, reduced butter to 1/4 cup, and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp salt. I kept sugar at 1/3 cup - with the berries, it was sweet enough. I didn't add the topping, and no one was the wiser. If I do add a topping, I think it will be sliced almonds with brown sugar.

This is one of my "regulars" now. I always get rave reviews for this one. I add cinnamon to the sugar and use dried blueberries in place of the raisins and I add slivered almonds to the cornflake and brown sugar topping. It's a real crowd pleaser!

As a shiksa,I made this for the first time for our first Hanukkah Party with lots of Jewish friends in attendance. They actually said it was the best kugel they've tasted! Woohoo! Score one for the gentile! It's easy peasy and I'll definitely make it again and again!

I made this to take to a chanuka party. It was my first time ever making it and it got rave reviews. I followed the suggestions and used 1/2 cup sugar, touch of nutmeg, vanilla and a little cinnamon. Also I dont like raisins so I used dried cranberries. Other than that I followed the recipe. I dont know a good kugel when it comes my way, but I was told this was the creamiest they had ever had and that it was extremely flavorful. This recipe stays in the file. I even liked the crust and in the past I have disliked anything that uses cornflakes. Now I have an exception.

This is simple and amazing! I've never made (or frankly eaten) kugel before today but I'm hooked. This received rave reviews from everyone at the dinner party. I made some of the changes suggested by others - namely adding cinnamon & nutmeg and increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup. I wouldn't go any higher with the sugar, it was plenty sweet. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time) I will probably cut back on the butter as it was a bit too greasy on top. Overall, we LOVED this recipe!

I used golden raisins instead of regular, left off the topping and also added a 1 cup container or cottage cheese. Increasing the sugar to at least 2/3 cup is the way most people like kugel too. But, it is VERY easy to make and really nice and fluffy. I HUGE hit at Yom Kippur, especially with people who don't normally like heavy, thick kugel. This one's light and delicious.

I made this dish without the raisins. It was OK. If you're looking for a sweet kugel, this isn't it. ( I guess the raisins would sweeten it, but my family doesn't like them.) I would try this again, but I would add a little more sugar (maybe 1/3 cup), vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. As far as ease of preparation goes, you can't beat it.

Really EASY to make. I don't even like kugel, but this one was excellent. I didn't have a big enough glass dish, so I scaled down the recipe a bit and it still came out fine. I wasn't crazy about the topping- the cornflakes came out a little stale tasting- any suggestions?

I've made this several times. I brought it to a Rosh Hashanah celebration a few days ago. It was a huge hit and people have been asking me for the recipe. Make sure to use only 8 oz. of noodles. In the past I've been using more and it was not as fluffy and light. It's also great the next day.

This is so easy and so delicious. Now when relatives invite me for the holidays they insist I bring this dish along. It's so sweet that it can almost be used as a desert. I leave out the raisins so my kids will eat it, but other than that no changes.

To make it a bit healthy, I used 2 cups of 1% cottage cheese, 2 cups nonfat milk, added cinnamon and French Vanilla flavor to the custard mix...with a bit of Kosher salt to bring out the flavors. Instead of corn flakes, I had vanilla/almond special K which I coarsely crushed w/brown sugar splenda and a few dashes of cinnamon for the topping...amazing flavor! Got rave reveiws...oh, also I used dried cranberries in place of raisins, I used half a cup of the dried, and in the microwave I put half a cup of cranberries w/a bit of cranberry juice to plump them up...I like the different textures in the kugel. Enjoy!

THE BEST!!! I made two, one exactly as written, the other using Splenda because my husband is diabetic--both were equally delicious, and the my guests all had seconds and even took some home.

I've made a number of different kugel recipes and this one is definitely the easiest and probably the best. (I admit that I like my kugel sweet - this recipe is sweet, but not cloyingly so.)

I just love this recipe as all who eat it. I have made it dozens of times with several variations. My latest favorite is omitting the raisins and adding a large can of drained fruit cocktail. I once grabbed the 'wrong' corn flakes and found I had bought the box with bananas. Not wanting to go back to the store, I figured, what could be bad....it was outstanding.

Super, delicious, and thrilled a Seder crowd of 19. I followed other reviewers' advice and used golden raisens, Vanilla and Cinnamon. I also added an extra 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the corn flakes. My oven runs high and at 325 I let it cook until just set, 40 minutes. Moist and wonderful.

I wasn't sure that this would work because I had always pre-cooked the noodles, but it was great--and so easy. It's also a lot lighter (and less fattening) than a lot of other kugel recipes, and it still got raves at Rosh Hashonah. I added vanilla and used golden raisins with delicious results.

I made the Kugel dish this evening. The aroma is delicate and sweet. I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar for the custard. The result were noodles that were not as sweet as I would have preferred. I will make this again using either more light brown sugar, or try honey.

An easy recipe to make. My only suggestion would be to press down the noodles so they are submerged in the liquid. The few I had left sticking out of the cornflake topping were far too crunchy. Besides that, the uncooked noodles had a perfect consistency.

This is the best kugel I've had. I did make a few modifications: I added a cup of cottage cheese (and reduced the milk by a little bit),I also added cinnamon and vanilla. It was fantastic with dinner and great for breakfast the next morning. I will definitely make this over and over again.

I cut the recipe in half, just in case no one liked it! (Not to worry, they did) I used the full amount of raisins, and plumped them for a while in some water with a smidge each of vanilla extract and rum. I also used light brown sugar for a third of the total sugar in the egg mixture, and light brown also in the topping. Lastly, I subbed fat free sour cream and 1% milk, with no obvious detrimental results. Made healthy, it was a great breakfast. My kids even had seconds. Best of all, "Mama, this is really good!"

I had thirty people show up for the Jewish holidays unexpectedly, so I needed a very simple, basic and good noodle kugel. I tried this recipe and it was the hit of the holidays. Several people from that evening have asked me for the recipe - and they have all had excellent results using the basic recipe. I have made different variations since using the original - dried cherries instead of raisins, added cinamon to the brown sugar, used a combination of cream and milk, omitted the egg yellows and added 2 to three more egg whites, and even used different cereal toppings when I was out of cornflakes. You really can't do anything to this recipe to make it anything but delicious.

This dish is exactly as it is represented--comfort food! Its simplicity of preparation, homey mix of ingredients and satisfying richness really please. My daughter is away at college for the first time and is coming home in two weeks for her first school vacation. She has made a list of things she wants to eat, see and do while she is here, and this recipe is on the list. Perhaps even higher marks, though, were received from our cat, Gage. For some reason, he will not eat "human" food of ANY kind: Not meat, cooked or raw, not milk or cream, not even eggs or tuna fish! The offer of any of these food items elicits a turned-up nose and a haughty exit from the room. The first time I made the noodle kugel, I left it on the counter to cool while I ran an errand. Upon my return I discovered a neatly excised portion of kugel missing from the exact center of the dish! Since no other living creature was present in the house, it had to be Gage! Next day, I tested my theory and sure enough, he ate the smidgen of kugel I put in a dish for him (our veterinarian adamantly claims the 17-lb. Gage SHOULD weigh 12 lbs., so it had to be a smidgen)! Of course, we had to toss the kugel because who knew how many licks occurred twixt the rim and the soft center? Since that day, Gage has demonstrated a willingness to eat ONE other form of "human" food--cured ham! He nibbles daintily and then stalks away as if to say, "You've had your entertainment for the day!"

I have had tasted many noodle kugel dishes in my lifetime and have cooked many. There are two basic types, sweet and plain. This tries to be a mixture of both. The easiest and best is to cook egg noodles (drain) add one egg, and 1 pt. each: cottage cheese and sour cream, salt & pepper. Put in buttered long baking dish, top with butter and bake until brown. The sweet version is not so easy but just as yummy.
