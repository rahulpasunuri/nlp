Easy to make and the entire family really enjoyed it. Added steamed asparagus and broccoli at the end when adding the oranges. Doubled the sauce and added a bit more meat.

Almost 4 stars! Made this with pork loin, doubled the sauce, peeled the clementines and regular bok choy, not baby, also used flour instead of cornstarch. Family really enjoyed it and will go into our regular rotation. Next time I will add the clementines just before the bok choy. Was just a bit spicy, may cut back on chili sauce depending on who is here for dinner. I will also try with additional veggies, peppers, brocolli etc...

I made this as written except had to settle for large bok choy, no baby at my market. There were four of us at the table. Two 'A bit too spicy", one "just right' and one "needs more spice", all a matter of taste. We all agreed the the clementine rinds were not an asset. Served with brown rice.

Very good tasting and exceptionally easy to throw together. Going with what I had in my fridge, I substituted chard for the bok choy and leeks for the green onions. It tasted like something special for no effort.

This is the best stir-fry I've ever made. It's a bit spicy, but the seasonings never overpowered the delicate pork. After reading the comments about the bitterness of the tangerine skins, I opted for canned mandarin oranges. If you use those, wait till the dish is almost done before adding them or they disintegrate. I'm going to try this again and add cashews. And don't forget to made rice (I'll do that next time for sure) to sop up all the delicious sauce.

I found this recipe *after* doing my shopping for the week, so can't rate as I used this recipe as a start rather than following exactly. Still delicious and I will make it again following the recipe more closely. I used ingredients I had on hand: pork chops instead of pork loin, fresh OJ instead of clementines, and added yellow + red bell peppers. Otherwise I made as listed. Served with brown rice and it was delicious.

One of those recipes that's easy to double and freeze for another night. I peeled my clementines. The bok choy in the store was not looking so hot so I steamed some fresh green beans and tossed them in at the end.

This is one of my go-to stir fry recipes, really flavorful and very easy. I make it with little mandarin oranges and leave the peel on.

I really really liked this recipe as did my husband and dinner guest. It was easy..made it after work. I recommend doubling the sauce..also used a large bok choy since the store didn't have any baby. Delish!

For Paris: they are asking for one tenderloin, about 1-1/4 lbs. :*)

I don't understand the quantity of meat required here. What does 1 1 1/4-pound mean? 2 and a quarter pounds? eleven and a quarter pounds?

After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce, zested and peeled three clementines, and subbed parboiled broccoli for the bok choy. Also added onion and red pepper slices, which made for a colorful presentation. Our sweet chile sauce was pleasantly spicy; my husband added some hot sauce, but I thought it was fine as is. Excellent.

This recipe is on easy mode. It was very light and flavourful. The vegetable/meat/crap ratio is great so it must be good for you. I would recommend.

Rating: 1
I cook a lot and we like stir-frys as much as the next family but this was too strong and we thought the fruit with the rind was much too strong. If you want to try this recipe, I recommend only doing a handful of tangerines with the rind and keep the rest peeled unless you're used to the strong taste of the rind.

Rating: 3
this is an easy and solid recipe. I have made it with beef and pork and it is best with pork. I think the key is to not overcook the pork - cooked well it is moist and flavorful and adds to the dish. I think the ratio or tangerine to pork may be a bit off, so if you are worried about cloying or don't like things that sweet, you might want to add a little less. I love tangerine's so it is perfect for me, but my boyfriend isn't as big of a fan and didn't like the fact that the skins were left on. I found it added a nice bitter flavor to compliment the sweetness. It can be a little on the spicy side - so you might want to go easy and add more if you think it needs it. this isn't a sauce dish - so if you want some double it, but I don't think it needs it - it light and flavorful without it being coated in sauce. oh and it is EASY! no marinating, just a bit of chopping and cooks quickly. easy weeknight dish that is interesting!

Rating: 2
Not a huge fan of the sauce. I found that with the tangerines it got a bit cloying. The pork tenderloin was also lost in the sauce's flavor; the meat could have easily been chicken. Maybe this is because I double the sauce - per other reviewers - or because my meat was a little overdone.

Delicious! I will make it again for sure.

It was a waste of pork tenderloin. The sauce was too sweet and my guests picked out the pieces of tangerine.

Rating: 3
For 1 lb. pork (boneless lean chops), I used 1 tangerine (adult-fist-sized, not golfball-sized like a clementine), and that was plenty-- but yes, the pieces were fully edible and delicious! Used supermarket Hoisin sauce insteado of Asian chili sauce 'cause it was what I had, and my own Chinese salt blend instead of 5-spice powder, plus a pepper and some fresh ginger--really excellent. Next time will include some dried Szechuan peppers in the hot oil to complement the tangerine!

Rating: 2
There are better recipes which showcase tenderloin. The tenderloin took forever to stir fry when cut into 1/2" thick pieces. Actually had to put it in the oven to finish it, and it seemed dry in the end. There was way too little sauce. We peeled the tangerines, but they became somewhat dry and not juicy when stir-fried. The bok choy tasted good in this, but I would probably not make it again.

Rating: 2
This recipe is okay. The tangerines had a very bitter taste when I left the skin on. Either needed more soy sauce of more sweetness. Am trying it again with orange juice and mandarins.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so good. I did follow some of the previous suggestions. I doubled the sauce, which I thought was definitely necessary. I also threw in some broccoli and some sugar snap peas. For the tangerines, I peeled them and threw them in at the very end. My boyfriend and I thought this turned out delicious. The only thing is you have to be careful not to overcook the bok choy. It really does only take a minute. Will definitely make this again.

loved it! I used canned tangerines, and they broke down during the cooking, producing a slightly gooey sauce which was delightful. I am going to make this again and again!

Delicious! Made some minor modifications - I didn't use sweet chili sauce, but instead used chili garlic paste and added brown sugar & water to taste so I could have more control over the ingredients. If you do this, be careful because it will end up being pretty damn spicy. I also left out the green onions. Served this over brown rice. Mine ended up looking a lot more wilted and "cooked down" than in the photo, but it was still very pretty and really delicious. All in all, simple and tasty!

Nice recipe! I altered a little to use what I had on hand, but I can tell it would be delicious as written. We didn't have bok choy on hand so added white rice vermicelli at the end. Also used canned mandarines which broke apart and kind of became saucy. I'll try it exactly as written eventually. Great way to use pork tenderloin. So tasty!

Swapped out bok choy for broccoli, served over chow mein noodles. Rocked. One could easily make this veg--and maybe throw in some cashews or peanuts for protein. Done in 30 min. Great weeknight dinner.

Rating: 4
Since 2 out of 3 people in my family do not like anise, which is in the five spice powder, that was left out. I kept the peels on the tangerines, and, according to other reviews, added them in at the end with the baby bok choy. Best to make in either 2 batches or in a REALLY large pot or pan, as it has the tendency to go all over otherwise. Quite easy. This was one of the first recipes I ever made. Really delicious! The tangerines, even though they were added at the end, were spicier than anything else.

Rating: 3
Followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions: doubled the sauce, added sriracha and peeled the tangerines. I also doubled the ginger to give it even more zip. Great flavours and the pork was perfectly cooked. The only thing I didn't like was the texture of the tangerines: they were mushy even though I followed the cooking instructions to the letter. Next time I might saute them and then remove, reserve and add at the end so they hold together better.

Rating: 4
Simple, with great fresh flavors, nice sweet/spicy balance, and good food textures if not overcooked. Another fantastic weeknight rotation meal!

This dish was surprisingly lacking in flavor, given the ingredients. So many better stir fry recipes on this site are worth making.

I love this recipe and have made it a number of times. I do make some alterations though: PEEL the clementines! My boyfriend doesn't mind the peels but I find them really gross to bite through. Also, a little Sriracha will go a long way in helping develop the flavour of this dish....... bitterendive.blogspot.com

This dish was really fantastic. Very tasty and easy to make. I did make a few changes based on prior reviews...I doubled the sauce, added tangerine zest to the sauce, I peeled the tangerines, and added some sciracha for spice. Definitely will be making this one again!!

Rating: 2
I thought this was mediocre....not a ton of flavor, despite the flavorful ingredients. If I make it again, I would make double the sauce. I added quite a bit of red chili flakes to give it some heat (otherwise too mild....the suggestion of adding sriracha is also a good one). I think a squeeze of lime juice would also be a good addition.

Excellent no fuss weeknight meal. I used a spicy garlic chili sauce and it worked perfectly. Served over rice. Yum!

lovely with pork or chicken. I make extra sauce and serve it on basmati rice. I peel the clementines, my preference.

Loved it! Used 2 clementines... think tangerines might work better since they have thinner skins. Cut into bite size pieces, too. Didn't have bok choy, so just cut up a half head of lettuce. The pork was super yummy and the sauce was exactly the right consistency.

This was pretty terrible. Not much flavor and I couldn't get over eating the rind of the clementines. I won't be making this again.

I followed the reviews of others and peeled the tangerines, segmented them and added them with the bok choy at the end. They held together quite well. I used 3T of the sweet chili and 1T sriracha which resulted in a slow-building heat. I also added some pea pods and some peanuts, just because. You can really taste the five spice, even in such a small amount. Overall, a really tasty and visually striking recipe.

I used 2 clementines and I left the peels on them but cut them into about 1/2" pieces. I used Thai style chili sauce (sweet). The 5 spice adds a nice flavor and I would recommend using it. It's a great recipe served over rice. My husband and I both loved it.

Rating: 3
It's definitely a keeper! Like others, I also peeled the tangerines however, next time, I would add the tangerines with the bok choy. Throwing them in there too early will cause them to explode or get really mushy. All in all, a great, simple, and easy dish to make during the week.

so yummy & easy. peeled my manderines and didn't use the Chinese 5 star powder, used leeks instead and served over rice noodles... will make this again!

This recipe is really 5-star. I did use a planner for zest and cut the clementines to size. We just swooned over this dish. Since there are two of us, it was all we could do to not eat the extra two servings. I found it necessary to add a bit of chicken broth to thin the sauce. Also, did not have 5- spice, but it did not miss it.

This is a fairly quick, flavorful recipe that is good for weeknight meals. I peeled half the clementines after reading the reviews, to make sure I could save the dish if the peels were not a hit. I'm glad I did because my husband hated the peels and I was so-so on them. We both left the unpeeled fruit on the plate. Next time, I will serve over rice and peel all the clementines. Also, I will choose seedless fruit if it's an option. I wonder if the reviewers who found this dish too spicy used hot (instead of sweet) chili sauce? I would describe this recipe as only mildly spicy--my 19-month old was fine with it. If it had been truly spicy I probably would have given it four forks.

This is a great weeknight meal. Quick, easy and very flavorful- especially when served over brown rice. I took some other reviewers advice and cut the zest off the tangerines into long thin strips, and then added the tangerine segments seperately. I used asparagus instead of boy choy and it worked great. This is surely going to become a recipe I use often.

Very easy, one skillet meal. Used clementines instead of tangerines, and next time will probably peel half and use some zest. Also, didn't have any 5-star so lacked on the spice - still flavorful, though.

I've made this a few times. The first time I couldn't find tangerines, so I substituted Orange Juice. It was so good, I was stoked to find the tangerines and try it properly. Second time I made it with the tangerines, it didn't give the flavor that I was hoping or looking for. I have since decided that the OJ is the way to go. YUM!

I liked it and will make it again, but with some definite changes. We did not care for the rind on the clementines, but I liked the citrus flavor, so maybe zest and peeled in the future. My boyfriend is a bit picky and didn't care for the bok choy, so I was thinking maybe broccoli or even a mixture of cabbage, shredded carrots and bean sprouts. Put the left over pork with some ramen, shitakes and green onion for lunch the next day----awesome.

I'm a pretty good cook and my fianace is a professional chef and nothing about this really wowed us. It was a LOT of work for a weekday meal and the flavors just didn't really work. It was spicy which wasn't an issue for us, but the pork just really turned out chewy and the vegtables were overpowered by the sauce. LOVED the tangerines with the rinds though - I had on left over so I used the rest of the mae ploy with some shrimp and rice the next day and it was great.

Rating: 4
I made this tonight without any changes or additions and it was excellent! My husband gave it a solid 9 out of 10. I contemplated adding garlic, but I'm glad I didn't. I think it would have taken away from the fresh, clean taste of the tangerines and ginger. Next time I would slice the tangerines into smaller pieces (I enjoyed eating the rinds) so the flavor is a little less intense in each bite.

Did it with beef, tangerines without the rind, and with chinese cabbage instead of the bok choy. Quick, easy, delicious.

the first time i made this, i used the zest and segments from clementines. it got rave reviews from the hubby. the second time i made it, i had some spinach in the fridge, which i threw in with the bok choy, i also added about 4 cloves of garlic. i think the addition of thai basil and cashews would be fab. that will be for the third go around.

After reading other reviews I decided to only use the juice of the tangerines. The meal turned out to be "5 stars in Seattle" hot. My husband loves spicy food and it was even a little much for him. The pork was very tender and juicy and aside from the spice, it was fantastic. I will use 1/2 of the chili sauce next time.

Rating: 4
I couldn't find one tangerine in the store, so I used two oranges, sectioning them and adding to the stir-fry with the bok choy. I added the peel with the pork (used boneless chops, thinly sliced). I couldn't find sweet chili sauce, so I used sweet and sour sauce, along with dried red chili. Served over rice. Very good flavors, especially the sauce. I upped the ginger, too.

Rating: 3
As I am not a big fan of pork, I decided to make this with beef, which came out great. I could not find baby bok choy, so I used two large bok choy instead. These came out tough, so if I did this again with large bok choy, I would steam them ahead of time to soften them up some. I also wasn't crazy about the texture of the clementines (I think it was the rind that bothered me). I think next time I would also peel the clementines. I would still add the rind for the flavor of the oils, but remove the rind before serving. I would make this again with a bit of tweaking.

I made this tonite for my boyfriend and he loved it. The recipe is very good and the tangerines add a good flavor. Next time,however, I would use the juice from the tangerine and some zest. We did not like the texture of the tangerines once cooked. Also, I used only 3 bok choy and that was sufficient. This was a very good meal!

Rating: 3
This was so easy and had great flavor. We did eat the tangerines with the rind on and it was interesting. I only put half the amount of fruit in but squeezed the juice from the rest. The whole family loved this which is rare. Would definitely use beef in this recipe.

This is a keeper. I made the dish as presented. In the future I will use ribbons of the tangerine rind, cooked with the ginger and pork. (1/16 inch or less) Then, just before adding the bok choy, I will add the flesh from the fruit. The subtle flavor from the bitterness of the rind is something that takes the sweetness and heat from the chili sauce to another level.

Rating: 2
rind made the dish bitter.

Very nice flavor--really a 3 1/2. Just a bit of heat, certainly not too spicy with the sweet chili sauce. I thought about adding a some hot chili sauce but my DH said he liked it the way it was. The peels offer a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the fruit. I think I might try this with beef or chicken as I think it would work well with either.

Prepared exactly as the recipe says, except i forgot the chinese 5 spice. My bf raved about this dish, and said that i would have to make it again soon. I, however, couldn't handle the hotness. I will admit that I am a pansy when it comes to spicy dishes, but my nose was running, mouth was on fire (my bf loves spicy food). I will admit that its a mellow spicy not too bad, but next time I will make one without the sweet chili sauce for me, and with the sweet chili sauce for him! Oh and next time I will peel the mandarins.

YUMMMMMMM . . . My family freaked out a little when I told them to eat the mandarin rinds and all, but in the end everyone had seconds. It was awesome.
