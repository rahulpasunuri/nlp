Really did not have enough flavor or sweetness to it. Most of my guests kindly ate their entire dessert, but there were a few that were hardly touched.

Very reminiscent of pumpkin pie due to the spices. I really enjoyed this healthier spin on flan, the use of 1/4 cup maple syrup (as per recipe) sweetened the dish lightly. A great use for the single butternut squash my garden produced this year.
