This is a great recipe, one of the rare ones better than the sum of it's parts. Don't sub plain mushrooms for the portabellas, the meaty flavor is so nice with the wine. You can sub baby spinach for the arugula or French Feta for the Brie in a pinch. I also add sauteed shrimp sometimes.

Great dish. Every one I make it for loves it! I've added some fresh pesto and asparagus tips too for a change. I think the key is to not over cook.

This is an all-right dish: not fantastic, but good enough. One word of caution, however ... I doubled the recipe for all the sauce ingredients, and kept the pasta at 1/2 lb., a la Mark Bittman's suggestion. Doing this left way too much liquid in the sauce. By the time I boiled it down after adding the pasta, the pasta was overcooked. If you do this (which is great if you prefer more "stuff" to pasta and/or are trying to cut down on carbohydrates) I would suggest not doubling the wine as well to keep the liquid-to-pasta ratio about right.

Individually, the ingredients are all delicious albeit pricey. Together they are meh and a waste of money. The flavors just do not mesh. A simple portobello pasta with an arugula salad on the side, and brie with fruit for dessert would have been much better, and easier to prepare.

Bad....just really bad. I made it basically as written adding a bit more garlic and a bit more brie. A set of amazing ingredients that did not produce acceptable results. Next time I will try something entirely different with these great ingredients.

I have been making it since it was published and find myself craving it whenever it's been a while since I've made it. I wouldn't change a thing - it's a perfect blend of flavors. One of my favorite recipes ever.

Easy to make, and the leftovers kept my office-mates drooling for days.

We liked it enough to make it again sometime. It was a good way to use up some brie I had left over in the fridge. I added all I had, which ended up to be a bit too much. If you are going to add more brie, don't overdo it as I did.

I have been making this dish since it came out. It is a huge hit with my family. They tease me about the ingredients being "yuppie", but they really like it. Do keep some of the pasta water on hand to add at the end of the cooking process. It makes the juices in the pan moist and more of a sauce. It's not a dish with a lot of spice and kick, and that's fine. You can really appreciate the flavors of the mushrooms, arugula and brie. And the tomatoes don't turn to mush.

We loved this dish. The arugula and the mushrooms really dominate the flavor. We barely tasted the brie; I guess it was too mild. I think kalamata olives would be a nice addition.

Easy and yummy. Great use for leftover brie from a party.

This is one of the most delicious pasta dishes that I've ver done. It is also very elegant and simple. I just did it again for a dozen people and the sauce came out a little runny. In another time came out creamy and it was much better.

Delicious and easy! Have been using this recipe since first published. Nice comfort food.

I shall resist the trend to rate a recipe "4 forks" after I changed it drastically. This is an example of using a recipe to fit your needs. I had a stray slice of prosciutto I diced and sauteed with the mostly plain ole white mushrooms with a few Cremini thrown in, and garlic. I heeded the other comments and used rotini instead of orrechiette.I opened a 14 oz. can drained, diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh and threw in a tablespoon or so of herb and garlic boursin along with the brie. Yes, I used arugula! I was confused abut the amount because mine came in a bag. Just how big is a "bunch" of arugula? The dish came out great and I was able to serve dinner using up some leftovers in the fridge and without a trip to the market. I would make it again under similar circumstances but wouldn't shop for the ingredients just to make it.

This was a good way to use up some strange ingredients I had left in the fridge after a party. It was a good, quick, filling weeknight supper, but certainly nothing special.

I wasn't really impressed with this recipe. It was just not that exciting to me. I thought it was missing a little kick like olives, prosciutto, capers, fennel or ??

I daresay that the reviewer from NYC used a very strong brie. This dish is best with a mild brie. To prevent the sauce from being too runny, I let the tomato mixture cook a bit longer, so some of the liquid was evaporated. I added the cheese and let the sauce simmer for 2 minutes to fully meld the cheese into the sauce. I then added the arugula and pasta. The sauce is indeed rich, but not overpoweringly so.

The arugula really makes this dish. The brie and portobellos are very rich, and the nutty, peppery flavor of the arugula really helps tone it down. This is an easy, quick dish. I'll make it again, but not with orecchiette. I'd use a pasta shape that holds on to the other ingredients better-- probably farfalle or rotelli.

This recipe is really for the cheese fanatic, the kind of person who thinks of cheese as a condiment that improves everything. Maybe the brie I used was too strong or too soft, but it pretty much liquified and combined with the sauce overwhelming the other textures and flavors. Slimy is not a completely unfair description. If you're someone who likes reading the part of the lasagna recipe where it tells that you get to combine ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan then this dish might be for you.

What a great dinner this made! I substituted baby spinach (Arugula is hard to find in February in Baltimore) It was very easy & delicious, perfect for a weeknight. One tip: have all your ingredients laid out in advacance because it goes quick once you start.

Yum! What a great sauce - I highly recommend this dish!! Unfortunately, I had to use baby spinach in place of arugula (I can't find it where I am). I'm attempting to grow my own and will try again with arugula. Definitely a keeper!

Quite interesting, but like most others I made changes. I used arugula, portabellas, an onion, tomatoes, feta cheese, slivered almonds, and white wine. Very nice flavor, and for those that substituted spinach for arugula . . . you're missing the best part! Try it again.

Probably not fair to rate the recipe as I changed quite a bit. . . used thinly sliced spinach instead of the arugula, as someone had suggested. Also substituted a 14oz can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes and used feta instead of brie. The end result was delicious, sooo easy to prepare, and reminded me of Christmas with the bright red and green components. Will definitely add to my mid- week repertoire.

Made this recipe and loved the Brie in it. It was also delicious re-heated in the oven (covered in foil). I certainly recommend it.

I love this dish and make it often. It's especially good if you can get the arugula from a farmer's market or organic farm--it makes a real difference. I always add the arugula to the tomato mixture and cook it a bit first, so that it wilts more than it would just from being tossed with the pasta and brie. I also find that textured corkscrew or penne-type pasta works better here than orecchiette. A smooth pasta doesn't hold the thin tomato sauce well, which may explain why other reviewers objected to a "slimy" texture.

I made this for the Millenium New Years Eve! I served it with beef tenderloin sandwiches with horseradish sauce and a green bean and roasted garlic salad. I think the suggested serving size (at least for my menu) was a bit ample. Also I put in slightly less brie than called for.

Local chef provided us with some morels and ramps that we used in this recipe and it was excellent.

I am glad I read other reviews before trying this. I sauted two hot italian sausages(links removed), then added more garlic than called for and dried basil. Continued with the recipe--although used spinach instead of arugula--chopped along with fresh basil. Additionally, I melted brie in sauce before adding pasta--the result was excellent--------Do not listen to bad reviews--just make it your own!

A bland, slimey pasta dish. Not a keeper for me.

This recipe was very delicious! The key to this recipe is to season it well to bring ou t the flavor of the mushrooms. I also added chicken sausage and chiffonades of basil.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much. I couldn't find arugula at our grocery store so I also substituted spinach. The flavors all blended nicely together. A great idea for leftover brie after a dinner party.

We tried this recipe for the first time and found it very enjoyable. I used twice the amount of mushrooms called for and our arugula was very mature and from our own garden. I am happy I didn't read the other reviews until after I had tried it. It's worth a try.

I made this dish on June 8 as well. It smelled good while cooking but was very bland. Nothing seemed to help liven the taste. Perhaps goat cheese would give it more character.

Iam always trying new pasta recipes because my husband and I love to eat pasta. This is by far one of the least favorites I have made in awhile. It did not have great appeal either for taste or for visual appeal. I felt it was rather bland, even though I added more garlic and wine rather than pasta water. It was okay at best.

This has turned into my husband's favorite dish. If arugula is not in season, I substitute spinach. Either one, I chop into small pieces before wilting; the pasta mixes better that way.

It was good the first time I made it, but it was not that good leftover.
