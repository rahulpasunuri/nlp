Three days ago, I followed the recipe exactly (using the paprika and crushed red pepper) and got to three hours of marinating, then had a sudden change in dinner plans. I moved everything into a freezer bag. Tonight, I cooked the chicken on a cast iron griddle - - delicious!

I have made this dozens of times. Haven't used Aleppo but add a little smoked paprika to the paste and it is divine. Usually make a little extra for dipping sauce.

I would urge all of you who liked this recipe to try Aleppo pepper. It really changes the taste of this excellent and easy chicken dish. Aleppo pepper is available at Penzey's.

This recipe is a total winner. I cannot emphasize enough how good it is. Since it's set up to serve about 9, I upped the proportions a bit to get up to 12 servings and used 3 lbs of chicken thighs. I don't have a grill (or outdoor space for one for that matter), so I pan-fried the chicken after cubing and marinating it overnight. I also couldn't find Aleppo pepper, so I used crushed red pepper, paprika and a pinch of sugar (read somewhere else on the web that Aleppo pepper has sweetness to it) and followed the rest of the recipe pretty exactly. The chicken came out so flavorful with just enough spice for me (and I love spicy, though it may be too spicy for some I think) and perfectly tender. This is definitely my new favorite chicken recipe. I got tons of compliments when I made it for a work lunch.

Tracy - A pound of meat generally serves 4, you might want to allow more if there are big eaters or lots of men or if this is the only protein. It also depends on how many skewers you use - if you use long skewers and fill them up, then you'll end up with fewer servings, if you use short skewers and fill them up, you'll end up with more servings. Good luck!

PLEASE can someone tell me how many this serves??? I don't see the amount it serves and need to know whether I need to double or triple for 12 people? I will be serving this month September for a dinner party. Thanks, Tracy

YUM! Very simple to make and LOTS of flavor. I used 3 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast so decided to 1.5x marinade. Divine. Only found nonfat Greek yogurt, so that's what I used and as did this last minute, no time to find Aleppo pepper, so substituted w/McCormick Moroccan Seasoning (ras el hanout). Served w/tzatziki; rice; greek salad and pita. Could have easily served 6.

Quite possibly the best chicken skewers I've ever had! I doubled the recipe for our Memorial Day party and it still wasn't enough. I marinated the chicken overnight and they were so flavorful and tender!! Thank you for turning me onto Aleppo pepper! I am a huge fan and I use it on everything now! Found it at a local spice shop. I skewered the lemon slices with the chicken and grilled them together. Just lovely.

Made it tonight for the first time. I used red pepper flakes and the paprika. I only had 6 ounces of greek yogurt, but it still came out fabulous. Great by itself. I am going to serve it with pita and tsatiki. YUMMM!

Excellent and tasty! I could not find the Aleppo pepper, so I used a combo of cayenne pepper, crushed mixed chilies, & Hungarian paprika. I didn't have a chance to marinate overnight, but 2 hours produced loads of flavor. I garnished with cilantro. Super zingy dish, I served it with Greek salad.

So great and flavorful! Used chicken breasts, fat free Greek yogurt and red pepper since I did not have Aleppo. Grilled as kebabs along with red onion and zucchini. A little kick, but not too strong. Looking forward to making this for company!

Wow! This recipe is probably THE best marinated chicken that I have ever made. Seriously, delicious. I did not even look for the Aleppo pepper simply because I had the paprika and red peppers in my spice collection, and it simply rocked with these spices. I would recommend this to anyone! I used non-fat Greek yogurt and did not miss any of the extra fat or calories.

this chicken is a true winner and will be a frequent meal around our house; due to time, I substituted crushed garlic from a jar for the fresh, sprinkled cumin over 2 skewers and additional aleppo on the other 2--both versions enjoyed. Used boneless, skinless chicken breast and it was surprisingly tender and moist. Will try adding shrimp next time.

Wow. Tasted the marinade before I put the chicken in. Tasted a little flat so I put some cumin in to round out flavors. The final product is so much more tasty than I expected. Served with some saffron rice and grilled scallions.

Chiming in here to say I make this again, and again, and again - it is that good a marinade, not just for boneless thighs on kabobs, but for breast on the bone. Having it tonight for about the 30th time since this recipe appeared. I use TJ's goat milk yogurt and a Smoky Paprika Chipotle Seasoning (found it at HomeGoods). Also discovered a while back, when I was out of tomato paste, that organic ketchup stands in very nicely, so now that's what I use.

Rating: 4
Very, very good authentic taste. This was a huge hit with my Lebanese family. I used regular whole milk yoghurt (I didn't want too much of the marinade adhering to the chicken because we use a charcoal grill and it chars) and I will use a little less salt next time as that was the only criticism. Cheers, Musa Dagdeviren!

I've made this three times in the last month and it's a delicious recipe!! It was a big hit at my Turkish dinner party recently. I brought back the red pepper flakes from Istanbul's Spice Market and they really make the dish. It's now one of my favorite ways to cook chicken. I love Turkish cuisine and wish there were more recipes from Musa Dagdeviren.

I just made this last night and it was awesome! I really liked that I could prepare it the night before and then just throw it on the bbq when I was ready (we have an indoor electric one). The meat was moist and I put it on top of yellow rice. It was a great and filling meal.

Wow!!!! I made this for the first time tonight for a very finicky family (mine!) and son's girlfriend. My non-adventrous children and my daughter who doesn't like chicken couldn't stop eating it. It's easy to make, ingredients were on-hand and the results were moist and tasty. I reduced the virgin olive oil to two TBSP and next time I might try one, just to reduce extra fat. I don't think it will diminish the end result. Great marinade for BBQ season.

Super easy and super tasty. On a trip to Istanbul I came back with my bags filled with spices and aleppo pepper was one of them. This is the first recipe I've come across where a can use a big bunch of it at a time! I do add bit of smoked bittersweet paprika and packaged chopped garlic instead of squashed whole ones. Done it with skewers, done it with whole thighs and legs, done it with split breasts. Every time delicious!

So yes, this one has quite a long ingredient list for a quick dinner, but I'd go through the trouble again. Made this for a party that required finger food more than plated food. Did 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb chicken, with one shrimp or one chicken strip per skewer, and it went over very well--rave reviews by all as well as many "what's on there?!" questions...in a good way.

More effort than is warranted for the end result. Tastes too much like falafel-stand chicken -- not as delightful as we'd anticipated; will not repeat. Would be better served by simply skewering veggies and meat without the turkish sauce.

I'm not rating this recipe, since I changed it (though if I were, I'd give it a 4!). This was an amazing marinade! I used it on shrimp, and didn't have Aleppo or any other pepper - I just used paprika which turned out mild but intensely flavorful, the best of both worlds. I also reduced the salt by half. I'd highly recommend, I'll be making this again!

Just can't help myself - I have to review this yet again. Seeing the popularity of this delicious and easy skewered chicken makes me smile. Some have asked about Greek yogurt - I use only plain goat milk yogurt, from either TJ's or Whole Foods, and don't bother with the thicker Greek yogurt. We have this at least once every two weeks in our dinner grilling rotation, and it always pleases.

this is great! I only marinated 90 minutes; it was awesome. I paired it with http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Grilled-Chicken-with-Mint-Orange-and-Chile-Chutney-103712#ixzz1TeR8fGIi but added more lime juice and orange juice so it was more salsa than chutney - awesome

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly but just used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and it was so flavorful and delicious. I wonder if the whole greek yogurt is necessary as I usually have the nonfat around already. I will try that next time. I served it with couscous with harissa and toasted almonds, and grilled onions and zucchini. Also, the recipe doesn't say how many servings, but I halved the recipe and 1.25 lbs. was enough for 4 skewers of chicken, I would say serving about 3-4 people.

Yummmm. Marinated for about 3-4 hours which was plenty. Didn't have Aleppo Pepper, so made may own concoction with what I had (included a little smoked paprika) One of the lemon slices ended up getting grilled on a skewer and was delicious. I love tart. Will add next time. Served with a dollop of just plain yogurt and it did not compete with the flavors of the chicken.

Excellent, though I modified (not having Aleppo pepper) by using a heaping tablespoon of harissa sauce (Mustapha brand). Otherwise followed recipe and it was excellent. As one other reviewed did, I also alternated the chicken with onion chunks on the skewers. Took more than 10-12 minutes over charcoal fire though. Delicious and easy!

This recipe is ever so enticing, but it neglects to mention how much marinade it will yield and how much chicken to use with it. It also neglects to mention anything concerning the preparation of the chicken, other than mounting the "pieces" on flat metal skewers. Pity the guest who has the misfortune to eat grilled chicken kabobs sans this marinade only because our stellar chef neglected to mention to the host(s) the small details noted above!

Outstanding! Did not have the Aleppo pepper so used the substitute (added a bit more) and added some lemon juice along with the lemon slices. Marinated for 4 hours (which I thought might not be long enough since some said they marinated for 24) and the chicken turned out perfectly tender and flavourful. Served with a yogurt sauce similar to the marinade (minus the red pepper flakes and tomato paste plus mint) alongside a lemon mint couscous. Guests raved!

This was AMAZING!!! Some of the reviewers said it was bland, so I added extra crushed red peppers and marinated the chicken for 24 hours. I did not have Aleppo pepper, but I've since ordered some from Penzey's. Instead of cubing the chicken, I used tenders, which skewered up nicely, and Penzey's had sent me a Turkish spice mix as a free sample with a previous order so I used that to sprinkle on the chicken before grilling. As another reviewer suggested, I boiled the marinade and used it as a sauce. That made the dish very spicy, but we love spicy food and the flavor was simply unbelievable. I made Pearl Couscous with Olives and Roasted Tomatoes as a side, which was a perfect accompaniment.

This was very good,moist and tasty. Marinated for 24 hours which is what I feel is the key for full flavor. Cooking on a charcoal grill also imparted additional flavor.

Would definitely make again

I use this site almost daily, and have never posted a review. However, this recipe is outstanding. Can't image why some thought it bland. The key is the length of time you marinate the chicken. I think 4 hours is the minimum. I left mine in for 6...delicious. Needs additional salt before it hits the grill.

Thought this was yummy and very moist. I used the crushed red pepper and paprika combination and marinated the chicken (used breast meat only) for 24 hours. Inspite of my instructions to grease the grill, my hubby didn't and the chicken stuck...so make sure you oil the grill as the recipe states.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe but found the flavor missing something so after reading through the reviews again I made a few changes which made it outstanding. I used a heaping 2 T aleppo pepper, minced garlic cloves instead of just smashed, and the juice of 1/2 lemon with the remaining half sliced and added to the marinade. I also saved a third of the marinade before adding the chicken for a sauce. We sliced the remaining lemon in half and then grilled them along with the chicken. Finally, we served it with herbed quinoa from the Mango Chicken recipe on this site and grilled pizza dough flatbreads brushed with oil and Zaatar spice.

This is a great recipe - really easy, fun ingredients and an interesting way to do summer BBQ. I made it for a crowd, including some children, and everyone loved it. Like some other reviewers have said, it is a little bland for being a Turkish recipe with Allepo pepper. Next time I will use a bit more Allepo pepper as well as add some lemon juice as I am grilling. Also, I served this with some Tzatziki which was great. Will for sure make this again!

This was delicious! I didn't have aleppo pepper, so I just used the suggested combo of sweet paprika and pepper flakes. I thought it was very flavourful and would make it again in a heartbeat. It's a tiny bit out of the ordinary, but not so scary my meat-and-potatoes guests were scared off. :)

Easy weeknight meal, and usually I have most of the ingredients on hand. I substitute regular paprika and crushed red pepper, and it works out great. I thread the chicken onto skewers with onions and green peppers and cook it in the oven, and broil on high for the last 5 minutes.

This recipe was so easy and delicious that I felt compelled to review a recipe for the first time. What I loved about this recipe is that with the exception of Aleppo pepper (I used crushed red pepper instead) I almost always have all of the ingredients which means I can throw it together on a weeknight. I cooked the kebabs on my foreman grill as it was cold and rainy the day I chose to try this. The flavor was phenomenal. The great thing about doing it on the foreman was that I took the extra marinade sauce that was cooked on the grill and spread it on crunchy french bread. Delicious! I will definitely make again.

This was a perfect sunny afternoon grilling dish. Don't be tempted to string the lemon on the skewers- it makes the adjacent chicken soggy instead of crisp. Pairs perfectly with Pearl-Couscous-with-Olives-and-Roasted-Tomatoes on epicurious. The sub for the aleppo pepper is totally fine.

My boyfriend LOVES this dish. Says it's one of my best ever. I used an extra tablespoon of Aleppo to spice it up a bit and some extra tomato paste (which I make using tomato powder....nice not to have to have to open up a can just for a few tablespoons). And, like one of the other reviewers, I broil it in the oven because we don't have a grill. Just make sure to turn the kebobs over once the tops look done. You can order the Aleppo peppers (and tomato powder) from www.thespicehouse.com.

Made as per recipe (used substitutes for Aleppo pepper), only marinated one hour, and it was delicious! Cooked (boiled) the marinade while chicken was on the grill and served it as a side sauce-- will do that again. A definite keeper (can't wait to try it with longer marinade time). I love spicy food and thought this was perfect!

We have made this recipe multiple times this summer and it is always absolutely great. I use sweet pimenton (instead of Hungarian paprika) with the dried red pepper and then add red onion, orange bell pepper, and the lemon rounds to the skewers. The pimenton adds a fantastic smokey flavor. I mix thighs and breast meat and both work. I serve with the Smitten Kitchen/Ina Garten tzaziki and grilled naan and green salad. Lovely!

So I couldn't find any Aleppo pepper and used paprika/crushed red pepper. I thought it could use a bit more spice actually. Only let it chill / marinate for 1 hour.

I am a major griller so I was excited to try this, esp., with all the great reviews. I made it exactly as stated, and I have to say I was underwhelmed. It was just too bland for me.

We really enjoyed this but I made a couple of substitutions and have a serving suggestion.

Also, I used nonfat plain yogurt, which I find very similar to the Greek-style and it worked well. I would recommend also serving some yogurt at the table as a dipping sauce...it adds a nice tang.

This was really good. I tried to use spray-on oil for the grill and these kabobs really stuck. Next time I'll try brushing on the oil as instructed. I didn't have Greek yogurt so I used nonfat plain yogurt instead. I let it strain for about 2 hours and that was just as good as overnight, as they suggest. I started with a little more than was called for to account for the loss of volume. Yum!

My husband and I thought this was very good. I did save some of the marinade for dipping. I used it, but my husband did not. I didn't have sweet paprika, so I used Hungarian Hot Paprika and added a bit of honey. It does stick to the grill pretty badly, so the idea for using a spatula is a good one. I think I'll have the leftovers with naan bread.

Forgot to add in my review: The kabobs did stick to the grill even though we oiled it. You will need a spatula to help turn the kebabs.

Amazing. Chicken was so tender and flavorful. Used pepper and paprika combo. Plan to order Aleppo Pepper with my next Penzeys order. Marinated the chicken in a ziploc for about 2-1/2 hrs. Served over orzo. Had leftovers on pita today topped with some yogurt and finely chopped cucumber. Yum!

Super tender. I also had to use the paprika & red pepper method. Actually, I used regular paprika b/c I couldn't find the smoked or sweet and it was still very tasty. I think I will try it on smoked 1/2 chickens the next time and there will be a next time!!

A new favorite. I did not have the aleppo pepper so I did the paprika-red pepper substitution. I was glad I made the full recipe, even for just two of us. We ate the fantastic leftovers in little pita sandwiches with tzatziki sauce the next day. I would make this for company.

I made this dish with the paprika/red pepper substitution - delicious! Even though the weather wouldn't cooperate and we had to "grill" them in the broiler, this was a great meal. The flavor was full and spicey, but not too strong and the prep was easy. Will definitely make again.

Wow, this was a tasty addition to our dinner party! Marinating for about 9 hours made the chicken so tender. Used smoked paprika and loved it. Served it with garlic yogurt sauce and pita bread. Will definately make this again- any time of the year.

An excellent marinade. Great combination of flavors with the pepper and acidic elements. It will definitely tenderize your proteins. Can't wait to make again next summer. Love the idea of using it for chicken wings as well. Fortunately, the Penzey's kids have a store two blocks from me, so getting the odd spice is never a problem. Get the aleppo; a smoked paprika would be a whole different animal.

Both the hubby and I loved this recipe. Very flavorful without being overwhelming. Like most people I used the substitution recommendation for the Aleppo, but I used smoked paprika instead of sweet paprika. Not sure how much of a difference it would make, but I can vouch that smoked paprika is wonderful in this recipe.

WOW! Loved the lemon and garlic kick to the peppery spice. Marinade created a fabulous crust. Even used this marinade on wings.

I've tried this recipe twice and have used both skewers and a grill pan. The yogurt does stick to the grill, but isn't a problem when cooking outside. We're a family of two, so we usually stuff the left overs in pita pockets with tzatziki for some great sandwiches!

This dish was pretty good. I grilled it indoors in a grill pan, so perhaps some of the intended flavor was lacking, especially because of the way the yogurt marinate congregated (burning) in the bottom of the grill pan. I may be biased, however, in favor of a similar food & wine recipe from earlier this year (June?) that suggests a yogurt/pureed onion/turmeric/cumin approach. I felt this method--I used red pepper/hungarian paprika--was somewhat milder than I would have liked. I suspect it may be a real stunner with the aleppo. Either way, the kebabs were very tender and delectable on whole wheat pita with a similar yogurt sauce and a few veggies. Would make again, with a few improvements in the spicing department.

Delicious, simple, and a real crowd pleaser. The chicken has a nice level of heat and the Greek yogurt (do not skip on this!) makes the chicken incredibly tender. Highly recommended. We served with grilled vegetables and Persian saffron rice. Highly recommended!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but not mind-blowingly so. Perhaps it was because I couldn't find any aleppo pepper? I didn't bother threading these onto kebabs and it was fine. I also forgot to buy tomato paste, so I added some ketchup instead (it worked out okay, though I'd prefer to make it with the paste). Maybe I'll order the aleppo pepper at Penzey's and try it again. I served it with the roasted red pepper with walnuts spread from this site and THAT was truly amazing.

Had this as kabobs at a friend's house and was great. Next day we made it at home but marinated for only 30 min and left the thighs/breasts whole. Was just as tasty (esp the thighs). This is a new house favorite. Was great served w the field bean/tomato recipe from BA July '09 issue. Served w saffron spiced orzo w a squeeze of lemon over.

Rating: 4
Yum. This is so good. Made it exactly as outlined (no Aleppo pepper here so used the paprika and hots) and marinated 24 hours. It was fantastic. Spicy but not a lasting spice. Not great for kids but amazing for adults, even those who are not huge spice fans.

Yum, this was so good!! I used the broiler in my oven (I don't have a BBQ) and used paprika & red pepper flakes and it was still really good.

After reviewing this recipe on 6/18/09, I have used the yogurt marinade again several times to grill chicken breasts, thighs, and drumsticks, making sure to pull back the skin to get the marinade onto the flesh. Also, have been using a Smoky Paprika Chipotle Seasoning which I found at TJ Maxx (Victoria Taylor Seasonings) and it replicates the original seasonings quite nicely.

This recipe wasn't good. The initial taste was smokey and quite nice, but the lemon flavour quickly overpowered the dish. The combination was not complimentary.

This has wonderful flavor. Used Aleppo pepper from Penzey's and made it with chicken breasts, so reduced the grill time accordingly. The lemon flavor came through, surprisingly. Not sure what the tomato paste added. Might skip that next time...and there will be a next time!

Delicious. I couldn't find Aleppo pepper (other than online) and used 1.5 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika. I made kabobs using red peppers and thinly sliced lemons, which made for great taste and presentation

This was wonderful: tender, flavorful, and easy to make. The marinade (and flavor somewhat) reminded me of tandoori chicken, but this was delicious in its own right. Looking forward to making it for friends this week!

Fabulous and delicious. I split the marinade in half. I used half for the marinade and the other half as a dipping sauce.

I will definitely be looking for Aleppo Pepper, but for now I sustituted the red pepper and smoked paprika. YUM. It was very lemoney and very tasty. We wrapped them in a whole wheat naan and ate them that way. I also made Rice with Fennel and Golden Raisins from this site with them and it was very complimentary. The other dish I made with it was a kiwi sorbet and everyone raved about the dinner.

We made this for a group of young newlyweds and it was a great hit! Didn't have the Aleppo but substituted smoked paprika and added 2T of Siracha chile sauce to the marinade - it worked well. Also grilled the lemons and served on the side.

Excellent! I also got my hands on the Aleppo pepper, and I can't wait to use it again. What lovely smokey hot flavor! I used boneless thighs, cooked on a charcoal grill and they stayed moist. Will definitely make again.

Made with the aleppo pepper (from Penzey's). The perfect amount of heat. Moist and delicious.

Absolutely excellent dish. I may add some cumin or gram marsala the next time I make it, but it was fine as is. Served it with a side I found in Men's Health Magazine (July/August2009, page 85) for Lentils.

This made a nice, tender chicken. However, we were expecting a lot more flavor. It was quite bland. I made tzatziki, which was a nice accompaniment.

great recipe-pretty easy to make Next time I think I'm going to put melted butter over them when they're done and sprinkle some garam masala or other indian spice to add a little kick. I served with homemade raita and naan and it was great.

I happen to live in a very diverse and small state, so I was able to pop out to the HELLEN Bakery two towns over to purchase the Aleppo Pepper. I made this as written, but saved a little of the marinade to brush on to the kebabs before serving and threaded the skewers with some red peppers and onions as well. We enjoyed these and found them to be moist and tender. I will definitely do these again. They had just the right heat and were very simple to make.

Used the substitution for the aleppo. Turned out just okay. Didn't love it. Won't make it again.

Threw this together for the family with what I had, plain yogurt, crushed red pepper and paprika. Even with all the subs it still got raves from everyone...it is a very forgiving recipe! Every one ask to have it again so it will certainly be repeated.

I had the aleppo pepper, and loved what it brought to the dish. My husband - who thinks chicken is a blank canvas that is only as good as what is applied to it - really liked it, too. Will definitely make it again.

We all thought this chicken was pretty terrific. We used the paprika/hot pepper combo but otherwise followed instructions as written. Very tasty.

I used the substitution for the Aleppo, and it was still wonderful! I served it with naan, and I wished that I had saved some of the yogurt marinade before putting the raw chicken in so I could dip the kebabs and naan in it! This is a no-brainer; it's on my weeknight rotation, but it's good enough for company!

Marianted 8 hours and used crushed red pepper/paprika version. Very delicious but a bit spciy. I added baby bella mushrooms and red pepper to the kabobs. Served over basmati rice with a hint of lime zest and chopped green onions folded into the rice once cooked.

Made as written, but with the crushed pepper/paprika option. Flavorful, spicy. Liked by all, but not exceptional.

Amazing. I loved this. The heat of the aleppo is interesting. I am not sure how the crushed pepper could simulate it well. Aleppo has this pleasantly intense heat that doesn't last on the palate. Wonderful recipe.

The chicken was so full of flavor and extremely tender! I marinated it for around 6 hours, served it with these Mezgaldi onions http://www.kayotickitchen.com/ and grilled Naan. I am making it again tonight, 2 days later, at my husbands request (and he rarely requests anything!).

Grill the sliced lemons, too! They are delicious! Made with raita and also grilled some skewered vidalia onion and red pepper. A perfect summer meal.

Made this chicken Sunday-what a hit! It lends itself nicely to improvising. Didn't have plain greek yogurt so i used greek vanilla,figuring the spices were strong enough to mask it and they were. The important reason to use the greek is it is so thick it really coats the chicken.I put in a lot of fresh lemon juice and lots of garlic. I made the paste as the recipe recommends but next time would put the spices in separately. Served on sticks-pretty looking and tasting!

3.5 forks. These came out pretty good. I would maybe reduce the amount of vinegar next time. I made half the recipe using aleppo flakes, non-fat Greek yogurt and chicken breasts which yielded 4 skewers and I cooked them in a grill pan. I marinated the meat for an hour and the meat came out very moist and flavorful.

Rating: 4
Wow!! This was a great recipe! My husband loved the dish and so did I. I did not have Aleppo pepper, so I used the substitute given in the recipe. I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts and grilled them whole instead of cutting up into kabobs. The meat was moist and delicious.

This was a great marinade recipe. Instead of sweet paprika I added hot, with the crushed red pepper flakes. It had a little bit of heat, everyone loved it.

This was fantastic. I followed directions as stated and even found the Aleppo pepper which is worth it. Served it with grilled vegetables and Greek pitas that have Feta on them. My family devoured the meal. A real keeper. This is going to become a mainstay in our selection of family dinners!

This is delicious. I only used a little over a pound of thigh meat but kept the same amount of marinade and thought it was perfectly spiced. I agree that it is best served with grilled red peppers and onions as well as cumin spiced yogurt. Very easy and very good.

I used boneless breasts and made this with the paprika and crushed red pepper substitute for Aleppo Pepper. It was fabulous, and not spicy at all. The chicken was so moist. I might add some more crushed red pepper the next time. I made a raita with Greek yogurt, cucumber,cumin, cilantro, and lemon juice to accompany it.

Delicious. So often marinades, despite the yummy ingredients that go into them, don't really come through as anything special once the meat is cooked. This marinade is an exception. The yogurt keeps the chicken moist and it has a wonderful flavor. I made it as written (red pepper/paprika version) and reduced the crushed red pepper in half since we don't like really spicy food. It was great. I will definitely make it again.

I used chichen thighs and zero fat green yogurt and it was nice and light and creamy. Next time I will try it with chicken breast.. should still be good. I love this recipe because it makes the chicken so juicy (and it's just so hard to do when you grill chicken)!

My husband had just suggested doing grilled chicken kabobs two nights ago, so when this appeared in the 'what's new' section, it was instant wish fulfillment. I made half the recipe for the two of us, using crushed red pepper & paprika as the suggested substitute for Aleppo pepper. Also, threaded the thin slices of lemon with the chicken on the skewers, as another reviewer did, for an added lemony piquancy. We marinated the cubed breast of chicken for about two hours, served with separate skewers of grilled red pepper and Vidalia onion, and the Basil Caesar Salad (Gourmet June 2009) without croutons for a beautifully balanced and satisfying low- carb dinner. Will definitely try this next time with boneless thigh meat, which I think will be juicier, and will make this my go-to choice for skewered chicken.

This was awesome, had a little kick to it and was very flavorful. We did as the recipe suggested and made kabobs. I think that was important because the marinade covered more surface area that way. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic. I used cubed boneless skinless breasts and marinated the cubes for about 6 hours. I used regular paprika and crushed red pepper, and it was still excellent. I also used 2% greek yogurt because it was what I had on hand. Excellent results. I also threaded some red bell pepper onto one of the kabobs and served it all with a side of greek yogurt. I served this alongside the zucchini, mint, ricotta salata pasta from BA last summer.

When I was eating this I truly couldn't believe I had made it myself. The chicken was so moist and the flavor was fabulous. I made the recipe exactly as written except in my spaciness I forgot to season it with additional salt, pepper, and aleppo pepper before putting on the grill. Even with that slight mishap, it turned out great.

So easy, healthy, and delicious...I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, but kept them whole.

Wow. A real keeper! Only thing I did differently was to thread the lemon slices and the smashed garlic from the marinade onto the skewers between the chicken pieces. That jolt of grilled lemon really added to the balance. FYI I did use the aleppo, and I used breasts. Served with cumin-oiled grilled whole wheat pitas and salad with a cumin/lemon vinaigrette. Really really yummy. And really easy.
