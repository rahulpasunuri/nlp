This was very good and simple. I used Russian black bread, so it was nice and chewy.

Old City - your guests ended up hungry because you didn't carry the toasts to the table and serve them on a hot plate so that the toasts got cold and unpalatable. But then, they probably made a reservation as a back up plan. This is a delicious recipe! Try it!

To the cook in Old City - either grow up or find something to occupy your time rather than write nasty comments that are unnecessary. The point of 'carry it to the table' was meant to serve it immediately before the cheese cooled. I thought they were great.

Ingenious!!! I don't know how they ever thought of such an unprecedented technique. Pay particular attention to the "carry it to the table" instructions -- I forgot this crucial step, and my unfortunate guests ended up going hungry that night.
