In the middle of assembling and chopping, I started thinking about the reviewer who thought that this was an odd recipe that threw together lots of disparate ingredients- and as I stirred the finished pot of beans, pasta and shrimp I thought 'damn this is weird'- but actually it was delicious! Added lemon juice and white wine as recommended by someone and an extra shake of sea salt. Yum!

OK, so having read the reviews I made this dish with some fear etc....however, I found it to be a great, easy, every day meal. I had to do a couple of subs, I used chickpeas and canned tomatoes because that's what I had...I made my own chili oil with my home ground chili peppers and olive oil...I DID NOT use the pasta water, instead, I used white wine and lemon juice. I used home frozen green beans and cooked them for about 4 min. I added chicory greens because that was what is growing now instead of basil (yum) and I DID use frozen , pre-cooked shrimp, but only cooked them till they were heated. All in all, this dish turned out GREAT. I probably used more chili than most because, hey, some like it hot! Will make this again!

Been making quite a few recipes from Epicurious lately and each one is better than the next. This one was spectacular -- healthy, easy, and delicious. I used hot-pepper infused olive oil and heart-healthy omega-3 pasta. I think next time I'd add a bit more salt, extra basil and a splash of white wine. But even without these tweaks, I loved this.It's hard to eat healthy and still have something flavorful and filling -- this was it.

I agree with Chicago, 2009. It is a really odd combination of food and flavours. I wish I had read the reviews before I decided to try it. The best part of the meal was the wine pairing. I would not make this again.

I sort of liked this -- I am on South Beach so no pasta -- I used jarred roasted garlic, a bag of green beans from Trader Joe's (which I stirred in at the end) and a little rice vinegar for a bite. Fresh basil made the difference -- also added some oil-cured olives which I chopped. One of the best things I've had since I started. I used frozen cooked shrimp which I semi thawed under running water and cooked with the tomatoes. Delish

This is a really odd combination of flavors and textures. It smells good, it tastes ok, but I would never make it again. I didn't even care to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day. What a weird recipe.

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and I. He LOVED it, I thought it was bland! I marinated my shrimp for a few hours in oil, garlic and crushed red pepper. That helped a lot with the flavor. I also put it over angel hair and not shell pasta. Maybe there was too much water in the pasta, but I just felt it was a little bland. After I plated it, I sprinkled fresh parmesean cheese on top too...that gave it a little taste. Again he loved it, I wasn't sold on it. Might try it again (for his sake) but might doctor it up even more.

I must have estimated the amount of red pepper incorrectly because my mouth is ON FIRE!! Other than that, it's pretty good. As others suggested, I used raw shrimp and I improvised with canned whole tomatoes (none of the fresh tomatoes looked good - it is April after all) That substitution was good. If I make this again, I'll add the white wine as someone else suggested. I think it would be much improved with that. (And I didn't think the green beans added anything in particular. If you have some other veggie on hand, feel free to use that instead.) This is a flavorful and healthy dish, but I might not make it again because my fiancee really hated it. Thankfully I saved some pasta and green beans without the shrimp stuff which he ate plain.

I used spaghetti & raw shrimp which both worked out fine. I also sliced the tomatoes instead of cutting them into wedges which also caused no problem. I think the key to this simple recipe is high quality ingredients (esp. needs exceptional produce).

This was a great pasta dish! I used the tiny cooked Bay Shrimp which I did not rinse & finished it off with grated parmesan cheese. Plenty of flavor and super easy to put together!

This was really good weeknight dinner. I did use uncooked shrimp and cooked the tomatoes longer than suggested to get a more saucy result. We like things spicy, so I used more crushed red pepper than called for. I had the leftovers today for lunch and they were even better!

Easy to make. Used canned green beans instead of raw ones. Put the shrimp in last so as not to make them tough. Cooked shrimp only two minutes.

Easy to make and very good. Used rotelle pasta. Used canned green beans to save time. Worked very well.

Great summer recipe. I used uncooked shrimp (lets more of the shrimp juices into the sauce and doesn't overcook)and splashed some white wine in the pan as well. This doesn't take long. It is not a "wow" recipe for company, but my fiancee and I love it for a weeknight meal.

Followed other reviewers advice (uncooked shrimp, etc.) yet still found the dish very disappointing - white beans created unpleasant texture that masked any flavor the dish might have had. A waste of good summer produce/herbs in my opinion.

I made this against my better judgement, strictly because I was stuck with some precooked shrimp, needed a dinner and just happened to have all the ingredients on hand. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty boring. I wouldn't bother again. Agree that the recipe needed raw shrimp. Thank goodness I thought not to add the shrimp until almost the end.

This dish was absolutely one of my favorites, but, of course, I had to improvise due to lack of ingredients: I marinated raw shrimp 30 min. in olive oil, garlic, red hot pepper seeds, salt and rosemary (another improvised recipe). Instead of beans and green beans, I used artichoke hearts. I didn't use the reserved water, but threw approx. 1/4 cup water in the skillet. That plus the juices from the fresh tomatoes was plenty. I cut back on the garlic because the shrimp already had 2 cloves on them. Also, I had no fresh basil, but dried worked well. Enjoy! It's a good one.

This dish was very interesting - at first it seemed bland, but the flavors really came together after the first bite. Both of my PICKY teens went back for seconds, as did my spouse. I used raw shrimp - the cooking time was just a minute or two longer. The shrimp were delicious!I also used rice pasta.Next time I'll use more basil and garlic, and maybe some roasted red pepper to add color.

Great. The green beans add another dimension. Also good with chicken.

I used the frozen shrimp and just cooked 'til pink. Beans needed about 4 minutes. Everybody raved. Love when that happens, especially when the dish is as healthy as this.

I made this with wax beans as no nice looking greens were available. I didn't use the reserved water, as indicated by a previous reviewer. It could have used more garlic and red pepper (always), but besides that it is easy, fast and yummy for your tummy!

A light and easy to prepare dinner for those watching carb intake. I served with a small raddichio salad, and some lightly olive oiled baguette slices from the broiler. Excellent!!

My family and I really liked this dish. I'm always looking for an uncomplicated, healthy pasta dish and this fits the bill. Next time, though, I'll make a change or two. The recipe calls for cooked shrimp, but it should really say "slightly-undercooked shrimp" since you later saute/reheat them with the tomatoes. Mine came out a little rubbery. Also, I'd reduce the cook times in general--five minutes is too long to saute the tomatoes & shrimp and the beans only need about a minute (everything kind of mushed together when I did it as directed). Three minutes was perfect for the green beans, though. Also, I never used the reserved 1/2 c. of pasta liquid, and didn't miss it. It's a delicious dish and one that I can see becoming a permanent part of my "repetoire".
