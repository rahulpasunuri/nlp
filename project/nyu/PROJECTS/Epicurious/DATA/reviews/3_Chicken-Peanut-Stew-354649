long prep time for small result in taste...this recipe seemed to lack in the flavor dept...is there an ingredient missing perhaps?

It was hearty and full of good stuff, but for the amount of cooking and prep it was somewhat underwhelming. Maybe the leftovers will taste better.

Great recipe. Habaneros do just fine instead of scotch bonnets. The 2nd time I made it after browning the potatoes and chicken thighs I put them into the stew, sauted a pound of shellfish and added them instead of white meat chicken.

This recipe does take quite a while to make, but it is easy and was really very good. Putting the peanuts in the blender did not make a paste for me, they were ground up very fine. And, I put the vegetables into the blender (rather than food processor) and added a little of the broth in order to puree the vegetables better. I didn't have Scotch bonnet chilies, so I used jalapenos instead. The dish had a nice flavor with a nice bite to it.

I was a little bored with the flavors, but a hearty dish non the less.

Delicious! Takes about 2 hrs. to make w/prep but worth it
