This is a delicious, simple, and light dessert. The cinnamon is a must--it makes all the difference. Also, I didn't use Kahlua and it still tasted great. A definite staple for summer entertaining.

eh - it was ok - nothing special though...to many other good things to try before I would ever make this again.

Incredibly easy to make, I used canned pineapple, and drained it a bit. I did need to reduce the juices down a bit. SErved over ice cream, huge hit.

Delicious and very elegant and easy to prepare. I substituted cointreau for the kahlua and used less. It was perfect with ice cream. We also served it in it's shell cut into quarters and then sliced.

Excellent recipe. The pineapple and Kahlua tastes marry beautifully and you don't end up with a strong coffee taste. Really good and very easy.

Great dessert! I used a whole pineapple and did not double the ingredients. My husband and I both enjoyed this disk and i will definitely make it again.

This is just SO good, I can't imagine why more people haven't critiqued it. Perhaps it's because it is so simple. I just chunked my pineapple, thickened the sauce a bit. Cooled & poured over ice cream. We are not heavy dessert fans. This is perfect!

Great, simple recipe that takes no time to prepare. With a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you get that "Banana's Foster" kind of taste with alot less work.

Very good. I didn't boil down the sauce after baking and I will next time. Very good finish for a heavy meal.

This is a fantastic light dessert. It takes no time at all to prepare and is absolutely delicious. A scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side is a yummy addition.
