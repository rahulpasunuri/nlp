This recipe is a winner. Like others, I added zucchini, used two cans of beans and upped the ante on the cumin and chili powder. Delicious. The additions make it possible for me to use the filling for taco salads tomorrow. I made guacamole as well to add to burrito. With all of the flavors, my husband was unaware that there was no meat included in the recipe. This is a winner.

So good!! I just made this and will make this again. I followed the recipe mostly as written, just some proportions were off because I used two whole cans of beans and one whole can of the stewed tomatoes but it was still delicious! I topped with avocado, cilantro, sour cream, black olives, cheese and lettuce. I can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow!!

Very good and easy to prepare. We substituted pinto beans for the black beans and it was quite good. Ditto adding guacamole or just avocado.

Think I have made this 100+ times. This is one of our families all-time favorite weekday dishes. Unbelievably healthy and easy. Also, keeps really well and is also great the 2nd time around.

Wow, surprisingly good! I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of white beans.

I substituted sour cream with partially drained yogurt. Excellent!!

A great meatless entree. I added a medium shredded zucchini and doubled the beans. For finicky my kids, I had to reluctantly cut down on the spices--only 1/2 of the chili powder and no added jalepeno. For the tomatoes, I used Muir Glen's diced tomatoes with medium chiles. I even made it ahead by a few hours and let the simmering take place in crock pot, on the warm setting which worked well for our busy night.

A lovely blend of flavors. We skip the sour cream. A great meal for your vegetarian friends.

I've been using this recipe for at least 6 years. My family loves it! I do them up like a quesadilla instead of a burrito by grilling them once filled. It adds a great flavor and crispness too.

I thought that this was a very good, relatively healthy weeknight meal. My boyfriend likes meat, so I made a concession by adding brined, grilled chicken to the burritos. I would have liked them just fine without it, though. As a matter of fact, I picked half of mine out and gave it to him. I ended up using a whole jalepeno because like some other people, I wanted more spice. Jalepenos differ in intensity from pepper to pepper, though, so I would suggest tasting as you go. I also added some corriander and some extra cumin because I thought it was missing a little something. I used some "Spanish-style tomato sauce," but I rather like some other people's idea of using salsa. I would only use high-quality, preferably fresh salsa, though. I agree with other people that it is absolutely essential to make the burritos and out them in the oven until they're browned. This recipe will probably be added to our regular rotation.

We have been using this recipe for 5 or 6 years now. We love it. I try to make meatless meals about twice a week and this is a standard for those nights...I make it at least every other week. I use salsa instead of the mexican style tomatoes and I add some diced zucchini also.

Rating: 4
Wow--I was shocked! I'm a huge meat lover and took my wife's challenge of eating no meat for the day, so I made these burritos for dinner. Simply amazing. Easy, delicious, fillling (okay, I had two). I used fresh sweet corn from the farmers market instead of frozen and it really added to the entire flavor experience. Highly recommended.

Perfection! So easy too, you basically just have to chop an onion and a pepper and stir things together. This turned out way better than I had hoped.

Rating: 3
I didn't have onions or carrots and this dish still turned out very good. Next time I'd add more jalapeno pepper to turn up the heat. I find low fat sour cream to taste a bit artificial at times, so I used 2% firm yogurt (usually a greek brand) instead of sour cream, it has a very similar taste with a lot less of the fat.

Rating: 3
As other reviewers note, this is a great base recipe that you can modify with whatever veggies are on hand. (I would never leave out the carrots, but that's just me.) It's great in burritos, over rice, and as I found out last night, as the filling for Moosewood's black bean chilaquiles recipe. I think it's especially tasty topped with salsa verde or jalapeno sauce.

I normally don't take the time to write reviews. I only write this so that no one will miss out on this recipe. I have made this so many times. Even my carnivorous husband requested it for his b-day, when I would have made him any meat dish in the world. ( I am vegetarian) I add baby spinach, Desert Pepper Black Bean Salsa, and I serve it with saffron rice. This is always on rotation in my house. I couldn't imagine anyone being disappointed. (but please top it with a salsa that you love, then add cheese, then bake just to melt cheese.

this is a good super fast dish. I skipped the corn as my husband is watching his carbs and used one can of black beans and one can of black beans in a sowthwest sauce one time, carribian sauce another time (S&W has several different kinds.) I think the flvored sauce in the beans makes the dish a bit more gooee and by using different sauces you can vary the flavor a little. A great dinner when nothing is defrosted or on a hot day!

This has become one of our regular dinners. We make rice and put a spoonful in each burrito to bulk it up a bit. Also use 1 cup of salsa instead of 1/2 mexican tomatoes (what are mexican tomatoes anyway?).

I love this recipe and make it often. It's quic, easy, healthy, and tasted great. I kick up the heat and also added a little enchillada sauce to the tortilla.

Add OKRA! It is absolutely the key to a good veggie burrito! Its sticky texture keeps the ingredients together. Believe me, my friend did his master's thesis from NYU culinary school on the ultimate 20-veggie organic burrito. I would also add rice from a rice cooker. Other veggies to add: mushrooms, bell peppers, habinero peppers and broccoli. Two types of cheese are good: cheddar and monterey jack. Also a little lemon juice.

I made this for friends - one vegetarian, one who can't have dairy - and this was a hit. I added mushrooms which were a nice touch. I accidentally over-baked the tortillas which everyone agreed was a great mistake. Made the dish somewhat lighter instead of having a doughy wrap and the crispy contrast to the filling was really good. I also used sun-dried tomato and habanero flavored tortillas...good choice! I served Monterey Jack cheese on the side, skipped the sour cream, and paired with a tossed salad of greens, tomatoes and avocado. Great meal!

Thanks to other cooks' suggestions, I had a delicious meal! Substituted mushrooms for the carrots, included a full can of mexican stewed tomatoes, and baked the burritos with the cheese on top for about 20 minutes. Yum. The filling is great on its own - I think I'll have some of the leftovers tonight over a baked sweet potato.

My wife loved these burritos. They tasted fresh and healthy. I will definitely make them again.

I changed things quite a bit. I used Black beans and pinto beans. I did mash them a little. I doubled the seasonings, red pepper and corn. I omitted the carrot. I put the filling onto each tortilla, sprinkled with grated cheese, fresh cilantro, and sliced green olives (from the chicken and green olive enchiladas on this site) Then I rolled them and put them into a baking dish, topped with about a cup of enchilada sauce that I pureed 2 chipotle peppers into. Sprinked cheese on top then baked for 25 minutes at 350. I topped the finish product with fresh tomato salsa.

These burritos were awesome. My roomates raved. I left out the carrots and added zucchini, portobellas and spinach. I think you could put almost any veggie you like as a substitute. I didn't have the stewed tomatoes so I just crushed some whole peeled canned tomatoes. Fabulous. The best.

So fast, nutritious and yummy. I used whole wheat wraps. Might throw in more beans and smash them a bit first, or some refried beans, could use a little something to bind it maybe. Even meat and potatoes husband loved.

This recipe was great. I added portabello mushrooms about 1lb. thinly sliced to the vegetable saute and I would add more jalapeno chile next time to make it spicer.

This dish is fantastic. I used canned chipolte chili's in place of the jalapeno, used one 10oz can tomatos with green chili's instead of the 1/2 cup mexican tomatos, ommitted the carrots, added a bit of spinach, and some green and yellow peppers. WOW. My boyfriend asked if I could make this everynight. Try this one.

We have made this several times. It is great. Being that I can't get mexican style tomatoes here I use salsa instead. I also add a small diced zucchini with the carrots. very good!!

I too increased the spices, doubling the cumin and chili powder, and substituting 1/4 tsp cayenne for the jalapeno. Not being a fan of non-fat sour cream, I left it out, and used low fat Sargento Mexican cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack. This was a quick and tasty meal and I will be making it again!

Rating: 4
very,very good... I doubled the cumin and chilli powder and followed the advice of other cooks and added a whole 14 0z can of tomatos. I usually omited carrots. I also add 1 cup of leftover rice. Before rolling the burritos up I throw a good hand sized of montrey jack cheese onto each burrito. After rolling the burritos up I sprayed them with oil and baked at 425 for about 20 mins then served with gucamole,sour cream, and homemade tomato salsa. GREAT SUNDAY DINNER and one more thing the ricipe made 12 burritos so I froze the rest....Try it

Very easy and tasty. I did not use carrots per other reviewers' recommendations. Definitely add salsa, sour cream, guac, and lettuce to your burrito.

Rating: 4
This has become my favorite "stand by" recipe. Once you make it a few times, you quickly toss away the recipe and just ad-lib - putting in whatever amount of canned tomatoes, beans and corn and chopped up peppers that will fit your fancy. I've never added the carrot, but it definitely doesn't need it. Adding meatless ground beef can be a good addition as well!

Rating: 4
Delicous. A few suggestions: Add a full cup of tomatoes; half a cup isn't enough. Add some heat with another jalapeno or some Cholula (hot sauce). Lastly, wrap the burritos, top with cheese, and broil for two minutes (until the cheese is browned).

I've been making this recipe since it was first published - it is one of our favorites. Lots of veggies, it's healthy and delicious. My husband almost always has to have meat at dinner, but doesn't miss it with these burritos.

Yummy, great way to up your fiber content. We are a family that loves burritos and this one met our rigourous standards. No one missed the meat. I used plain old diced tomatoes with the juice because I could see it was a bit dry. I substituted frozen, store bought green chili's that my sister-in-law sends me from NM for the jalepenos. Really gave it some kick and saved my eyes from tearing. I forwarded it on to all my friends.

Quick and very good tasting! I liked the sweetness added by the corn and carrots. I served these with jalepeno jack cheese and some medium-hot salsa to kick up the heat a bit. Leftovers were every bit as good as the day the filling was made.

Very tasty! We served it to a crowd and everyone loved it. We've eaten it on tortillas, and on saffron rice. Great both ways. Likely to become a standard at our house. We did kick it up with some extra jalapeno. Makes great leftovers!

I loved this recipe and have made it several times already. I added some enchillada sauce to the tortillas to give them an extra kick. I also cut back on the turkey because too much takes away from the freshness and flavor of the vegetables. I also learned recently that you can microwave cheddar cheese in a bowl lined w/ parchment paper; when you do the oil separates from the cheese. You can scoop out the cheese, place it on your burrito, leave the oil behind, and make it a much healthier dish.

This is a quick week-night dinner - had it ready in under half an hour last night. Used fresh mushroom instead of carrot, added some leftover fresh spinach at the end. Very good & healthy.

This recipe has become a staple in our family. I always make sure I have the ingredients on hand, so I can make it when I forget to take something out of the freezer in the AM. I use salsa instead of tomatoes to give it a little more kick. Also, I bake them in the oven after I fold them (with a little of the grated cheese on top) to make the tortillas a little crispy.

My husband loved this. I served them with some homemade guacamole and fresh tomato salsa. I did need to spice them up a bit more and will add a little more tomatoes next time.

It's quick and easy Mexican, but the carrots take a while to soften, and I don't know if they go so well with the other tastes, so I would omit it. Plus, I used an entire 14 oz. can of tomatoes, and that seemed barely enough sauce. I also used store-bought garlic & pesto tortialls - plain ones can seem a bit doughy and floury tasting when there's not alot of sauce. This site has another veggie burrito that has spinach and mushrooms. Maybe between the two, there's lies the perfect non-meat burrito!
