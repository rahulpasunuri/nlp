I made this with a recipe for Shrimp Linguine with Basil-Garlic Butter and it was a great addition. I'll keep this one on hand for sure.

I love garlic, but this recipe calls for too much garlic for only 2 Tablespoons of butter. This recipe is too much of a good thing.

Delicious x ten! With just 30 mins. to prepare brunch/lunch for a group, I did this bread the night before, using just 2 garlic cloves, wrapped it in layers of plastic & foil & put into the freezer - defrosted 4 hrs. before baking & it was great!

Yummy! I used French bread and made it in my toaster oven since it was only for two people.

Excellent flavours - love the additon of the rosemary! This is also very good as a bread spread on its own without being baked/grilled. Very garlicky, very yummy!

Absolutely wonderful!!! I made fresh home made french bread and this was the ultimate. Use fresh parmesan rather than the powdered version for a superior taste. This bread could easily replace my favorite stanby.

This was a huge hit with all 21 Christmas-Eve dinner attendees. Will make it again and again.

Very garlicky, which is definitely a good thing. I served this for XMas dinner, and it was definitely a crowd pleaser. Garlic bread is an old standard, and the addition of rosemary and parmesean gives it new legs.

Fabulous! Very cheesy and flavorful. This bread was the hit of our last family gathering. I made the spread ahead of time (adding garlic and cheese) and saved it in the refrigerator until we were ready to make the bread.

This is an easy recipe for garlic bread with a twist! The rosemary adds alot to the bread.
