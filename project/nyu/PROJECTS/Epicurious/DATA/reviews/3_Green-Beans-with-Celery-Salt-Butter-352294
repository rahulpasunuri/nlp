This is one of those simiple things that makes you say, 'I can't believe I never thought of that.' I love adding one or two things to vegetables just heightening their flavor and this pairing works.

Great side for an otherwise heavy holiday meal. Easy, quick and different. Would give 3 1/2 stars if possible just for its simplicity.

A very disappointing recipe. The celery salt added a bitterness that my family found very distasteful. No one ate the green beans.

Nice! The celery salt added a really tasty, subtle touch to perfectly fresh green beans - sunny weather on a plate. :)

I love blanched green beans but think they risk being boring when served as a side for guests. This recipe quietly takes the edge off the boring potential. Made plenty and not one left.

This was simple and delicious. Who would have thought 1/2 t of celery salt would make such a differnece. Very good indeed
