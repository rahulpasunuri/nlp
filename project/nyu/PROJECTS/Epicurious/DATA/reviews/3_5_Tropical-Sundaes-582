Quick and easy tasty dessert but not a dish to wow guests.

It took a lot of self control to not have seconds. My husband and I love this simple dessert, especially over fresh-baked biscuit.

I subbed frozen yougurt and skipped the butter in the sauce and it was still amazing. The ginger lime syrup is the perfect sauce to top fresh tropical fruits (and don't forget the coconut!)

This is a fabulous dessert. I would give it five forks if that were an option. The ginger sauce is very intense, and the bits of crystallized ginger are a nice addition. We used ginger-honey ice cream instead of vanilla, and the whole thing worked spectacularly. Try it!
