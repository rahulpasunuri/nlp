Made this dish twice already and love it. A few tips: (1) the parsley can be replaced or left out, such as by including the fennel fronds you have left over; (2) do not leave the entire dish in the oven past the 10 minutes or the mussels will dry out - if you want more toasted bread then you have to par-toast it.

Made this last night for a BFF. It was simple and really tasty - we're both mussels fans, and thought it was very good. Next time my husband's out of town, I'll buy mussels & make this again!

Gorgeous, crowd pleasing presentation and you can't beat the clean up time with everything happening in the same skillet. YOu want to drink the broth - Very flavorful. We overlooked it but were it not for the probability that the mollusks throw off salt flavor naturally, which in aggregate with the pork is a bit much, I'd give it 4 forks. Not sure how to reduce the saltiness as on no occasion is salt added to the dish and each ingredient is crucial to the joyous flavor combo. I suppose pouring out some juice and replacing the lost liquid with water might work but not sure.

Excellent. There is no additional butter addeed to the mussel broth, the fat from he sausages gives the rich flavor we deserve! Covering the meat & shellfish with the baguette is ingenious for trapping moisture while browning the bread. perfect.

great recipe- tips: add more italian parsley and extra virgin olive oil- do not overcook fennel or the sausage - used good bread/ made in one large le cruset enameled pot- made this 3 times-added to my favorites- once added some little neck clams, always used less hot sausage, more sweet sausage- 3:1 sweet to hot ratio

I loved this! Easy to make and flavorful. Fun to set that sizzling cast iron pan in the center of the table and serve up.

Nasty - that's the only thing that can be said about this recipe. We dumped the whole thing.

I had hoped that this would be wonderful...but I found that the high temp only dried up the mussels. The broth was delicious!
