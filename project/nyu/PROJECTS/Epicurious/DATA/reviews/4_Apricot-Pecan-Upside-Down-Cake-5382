I made this with dried apricots (simmered them in water, sugar, orange juice first) and I left out the cherries, but otherwise followed the recipe. It only took about 45 minutes to bake. Using the dried apricots probably changed the character of the dish somewhat, but it worked and everyone loved it.

This really was delicious. Neither my husband nor I really love apricots, but we had a bumper crop this year on our tree, so I decided to try this. We loved it. I did not use the cherries or the pecans. It was particularly good for breakfast the next day!

What a secret winner! I had a ton of apricots to use up & used walnuts as well. Cherries are either-or. Not crucial. Make this like pineapple upside down cake & bake in skillet. Fewer pans, conserves topping & needs only 1 hr. to cook.

This was very good. I left out the pecans (even though I love them) since my friend is allergic. I also tried making it using whole wheat pastry flour, which turned out pretty well - it was quite good for breakfast.

I had high expectations when I made this cake, based on previous reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, although I used a 10" cake pan -- couldn't find my 9" anywhere! My weekend hosts loved it, but I thought it was a little bit *too* sweet -- maybe my apricots weren't tart enough?? I was disappointed that the brown sugar, butter and pecan topping totally obscured the pattern of apricots/cherries. Next time I think I will cut back on the topping a little to let the beauty of the apricots show through!

Easy to make and beautiful presentation. I brought this to a wine tasting dinner and paired it with a Muscat. It was wonderful together and everyone thought I bought it. I also did not use the cherries or the pecans.

This was a wonderful dessert. I didn't use the cherries and I didn't miss them at all. Don't hesitate to use this on company!

Fresh apricots were so inexpensive at the supermarket last summer that I just had to buy them. Thankfully I found this recipie to put them in. The brown sugar topping makes the apricots and cherries sweet-tart and juicy. And I really liked the addition of nutmeg in the cake batter. This makes for a homey and wonderful dessert.
