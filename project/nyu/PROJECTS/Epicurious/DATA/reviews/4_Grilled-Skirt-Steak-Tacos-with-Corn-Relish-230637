What is really good is the corn relish. Next time I'll add more green onions.. When you get some of that charred green onion in a mouthful, the flavor explodes. We passed sour cream, not really an improvememt. Also, I dropped $7 for the chipotle powder, completely unnecessary. Just stir a pinch of cayenne into some regular chili powder and save some money.

I only made the corn salsa, because I'm using it as a taco topping for some steak and chicken tacos for a BBQ. IT IS SO GOOD. Super easy, quick, delicious. Can't wait to eat it on steak and chicken tacos later...

I used frozen corn and grilled it in a pan with olive oil, used left over steak that I rewarmed. It could have used a little more heat which we added at the table with hot sauce. very good and easy.

Delicious and easy. I also used chili powder and cumin. Any kind of meat will do. This is a definite keeper in my kitchen.

Awesome I Just love the corn salsa. I had some extra Aji and Guacamole from an earlier meal that i did not want to go to waste so I pulled a chicken breast out of the freezer and it was a perfect 1 nighter for the MRS & I Steak Or Chicken this is an easy weeknight winner!

This was awesome! It definitely needed some spicing up, however. See the picture of it cooked and assembled at http://west_alexandra.photoshop.com, click on "Foodie Pics" Album.

Delicious, quick and easy. I forgot to stop at Penzeys to buy chipotle powder (used chili powder and cumin instead), next time will make it as written.

Wow - very impressive. I didn't think much would come out of this recipe but its going into my regular rotation! I used flank steak instead of skirt and marinated for two hours. I also sub'ed flour tortillas for corn. Came out perfect.

Very good. I'd give it 3 forks for taste, but 4 forks because its so quick & easy AND tasty. Used a chili powder mix instead of chipotle & will add more chili powder next time to get a bit more spice in the meat. The lime comes through wonderfully from the marinade and the corn relish is excellent.

So easy! So good! I used a better cut of beef, and would encourage you to do so.

I love this recipe!! I marinate my meat in a little tequila, soy sauce, and garlic to really tenderize the meat. I also roast serrano chilles and chop them up to add to the corn mixture!! Fantastic! It easily made on the stove top too, when it's too chilly here for grilling.

This is my boyfriend's favorite recipe. I did not have chipolte powder so used paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper to coat the steaks. Used an indoor grill and microwaved the corn (I know that sound terrible, but 2 min on each side works wonderfully if you don't have circulation to grill). Sometimes put over chopped salad instead of tortillas. Cilantro and lime with the corn... so good.
