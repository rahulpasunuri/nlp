Having a bumper crop of Meyer lemons, I decided to make some lemon bars - a personal favorite. I liked this recipe. Yet to increase lemon-ness- i grated 2 to 3 tblspns zest and added. Other than that, I didn't add anything. With Meyers, I probably could have reduced sugar. I think that doubling the lemon could make thicker bars and I might consider it a next time - because there will be a next time! There's still lemons on the tree!

I really liked this recipe: the crust stayed firm and made the lemon bars easy to arrange on a platter; it was more like a pie crust than the thick, doughy, cookie-like crusts I've used before. The filling was just right. I have a problem with powdered sugar, which I invariably inhale. Not wanting to have a coughing fit at my dinner party, I piped four little buttercream frosting stars onto each square. It dressed them up and they went down easily!

Rating: 2
The filling was very tasty, however, I did have to cook it an extra 10 minutes because it was not set yet. I was not a fan of the crust, it was very crumbly and the flavor just wasn't there.

Rating: 4
I found the lemon to be sufficiently tart, and the perfect consistency. It was soft, not runny, and held up when cut. I did run a hot knife around the edge very soon after removing the pan from the oven, just to avoid the sticking problem. They came out without a problem. I will reduce the crust by 25% next time; I think I'd like the proportions better that way. But these were yummy!

This was fine. The lemon part was pretty gooey- didn't set really, and the crust stuck in my glass dish even tho it's mostly butter! Probably will try a different lemon bar recipe next time. The taste was good tho!

Rating: 3
pretty, pretty, pretty good. I think the fault was mine - I put the bars in a tupperware before they were fully cooled, and the next day the crust is a bit soft, not crisp and shortbread-y. but the taste is there, and they are yummy.

Fairly easy recipe. Agree on double filling and parchment paper. Good way to use up a bumper crop of fresh lemons!

This was a nice flavor lemon bar. Next time I will cut back on the lemon as it was a little too strong and I love lemon. It was also a little soft, so maybe less lemon will thicken the consistency of the lemon cream. Very tasty though!

I thought this was also a little too sweet and gooey. It didn't have that crisp lemon flavor that I was looking for.

Such a great recipe. I have made it with regular lemons many times (and I am making them again right now!) I did try to make them with meyer lemons once, and they weren't as good. They ended up too sweet and not lemony enough.

I really enjoyed these. I followed the recipe and they turned out great. I thought the crust/filling ratio was good and they were very lemony. I don't understand the bad reviews and all the "tweaking" and substituting that was done. Seemed simple to make and yummy to eat.

Delicious! As mentioned I did the third of the crust but same amount of custard. Perfect for a 9x9x2 pan. I used margarine instead of butter (lactose allergy). Timing (20 min crust, 20 min whole bar) was perfect! Go Habs Go!

Rating: 3
I use a 9x9x2 baking dish to make this delicious and quick and simple dessert. I always reduce the crust ingredients by one third and up the filling to 5 eggs, 1 3/4 cups of sugar, 2 tbsp extra lemong juice, and a bit extra flour than what the recipe calls for. With the changes I get better proportion of crust and filling. Three forks because of the changes.

so, they did taste good, but not great. I actually really liked the taste and thickness of the crust, but found the filling too sparse, not lemony enough and it was not an attractive dessert. The topping looked like scrambled egg. Not something you want to see whn you're expecting a lemon flavor. Like I said, they do taste good and I like how the filling settles into the crust, giving it a really great texture on the 2nd day.

Rating: 1
I don't understand why this has 4 forks DESPITE all the "tweaking" that previous reviewers mentioned... The high rating really threw me off. The flour base was WAY too thick and did not bake in 20 minutes, I'll have to cut it in half next time. This is the first time that I was unsatisfied with a 4-forks recipe. :/

This is a great classic recipe and tasted wonderful! One thing, I used organic sugar and it turned my lemon mixture slightly brown! MUST use white sugar to keep the lemon/eggs yellow...

Really yummy and pretty simple to make! We used smart balance instead butter, egg whites instead of eggs, and added a little extra fresh lemon juice (~2.5 lemons, which gave us about 2/3c lemon juice). Super lemony! It'd be nice if there was a bigger lemon topping/crust ratio, but all in all a good recipe. :)

AMAZING dessert. Followed the recipe exactly. Yum.

This recipe didn't work that great for me. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I also got a foamy layer on top that became brown right away, and didn't look very pretty when taken out of the oven. Sprinkling the powdered sugar on top of this layer was also a fiasco. I guess that next time I will beat everything by hand. Also, the shortbread base was way too thick. Next time I will use half the amount suggested. I guess that with some tweaking it has potential. The flavor of the filling was good.

These would have been awesome if I really used fresh lemon juice - other than that, these were super good. Easy as ever.

Very delicious and very easy. I added more lemon zest because I really like a strong lemon flavor. I bake them a little longer than it calls for because just 20+20 minutes makes lemon bars that are to sticky to cut. Only one problem: they don't keep very well. The crust is soggy by day two.

These are good-add some lime juice and the flavors really pop. I like the crust for 2 reasons: 1. it is easy and fast to make 2. it is lighter tasting than a traditional shortbread base which pairs well with the citrus.

Not enough flavor for today's tastes. When I made a second time, I used a different recipe with 3/4 lemon juice and 1 1/3 cup sugar. Much more appealing. I would also prefer a higher filling to crust ratio.

I really liked this recipe. I made it on short notice and didn't read any of the reviews before hand. I used key limes instead of lemons, and they turned out fantastic. I have never made lemon bars before, so I was surprised about the egg topping, but it turned out very nice. I halfed the recipe, and accidentally added too much sugar to the crust, but was very good anyways. I will deffenitly make again.

Rating: 4
I made these as a casual dessert and they were great. I loved how prominent the lemon flavor was. I was surprised and pleased with the fact that there was no butter in the filling... I thought this made the lemon bars less heavy than others I have had. All in all a definate keeper, and I liked the crust, too.

Rating: 4
These were very delicious, classic lemon bars. I made them as is with just a bit less sugar. The only downside was that after pulling out of the oven, the top had formed a bubbly layer over the inner gooey-ness. Could this be because I baked them for too long, or not long enough? My oven tends to run cold so I would be shocked if they were in too long at the recommended 20 minutes. Either way, this wasn't a fault in the recipe, just my own error. I'll make them again and take the suggestion to double the filling for a more substantial bar.

Rating: 4
SUPER Lemon-y taste, and it goes well with this crust, which is more on the neutral side, almost tastes like a pie crust. This was my first time to make lemon bars from scratch, and I may never buy the mix again. It's worth the extra work juicing the lemons and grating the rinds!!!

Rating: 3
I have made this one a few times but the top never sets right and is always very gooey when cutting and gets pretty messy. They taste delicious, but I have made others where the top cooks perfect and are easier to cut. Also the base separates and crumbles too. Wont' make it again, too messy and not pretty!! :(

these bar are easy to make and were big hit with my book group. The lemon flavor was a little intense for me, but once they are sprinkled generously with powdered sugar, perfect!

This was horrible. The bars turned out chewy. Needed more lemony flavor. Would never make again. Could it be because I substituted egg beaters??

I loved everything aboutthis recipe. So good! I've only tasted one other lemon bar from a bookstore cafe; these were soooo much better. The crust was buttery, and while I felt kind of guilty knowing how much butter it really contained, I still enjoyed every bit of it. I didn't change anything, followed the recipe exactly. I do not recommend you do anything else besides follow the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is DEFINITELY a keeper. Crust is a buttery cookie and the curd is a great balance of sweet and tart. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a 8x8 metal pan. Since the pan was smaller, I had to bake the crust and curd portions a bit more. The crust baked for a total of approximately 30 minutes and the curd 25. I followed others suggestion and let the crust cool (enough to touch for a 10 second count) before pouring on the curd. Yummy!

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Still like the Barefoot Contessa one better than any other lemon bar.

Rating: 4
This is as good as everyone says. I did reduce the sugar in the filling by 1/4 cup and could probably have gotten away with less. I took the advice of one reviewer and added 2 Tbs. of instant Tapioca Pudding. It firmed up the cookies beautifully. Next time I will use only 1 1/2 Tbs just to get a slightly more gooey texture. All in all, a huge success!

Rating: 3
This is indeed a great basic recipe. I personally like more lemon than bar, so I would double the lemon curd/custard part next time, but keep the sugar at 1 cup per each recipe amount. I used Meyer lemons and put in more zest than they said, but the shortbread was delicious and tender, loved that! I only let the shortbread cool for 5 or 10 minutes and had no problems with crust-dough blending or something other reviewers complained about. Great, a keeper!

These were the best lemon bars I've ever had. Unlike the other reviews, I thought they had the perfect tartness. I don't like sweet bars and didn't think these were at all too sweet.

I FINALLY SOLVED THE TOO-STICKY PROBLEM!! When beating eggs and sugar, add 2 Tbs of Kraft Minute Tapioca. (It is used as a pie thickener so I thought it might work here.) Bars come out in beautiful squares that hold their shape perfectly. These freeze really well. I always freeze them 6 at a time in sandwich zip-locks so whenever my grandson or other beloved guests appear, I can whip them onto a plate and they are ready to eat in minutes.

Great tip about the 9x9 pan. A disappointment for me was the lack of warning that pouring the custard over the hot crust might cause it to lift and mix with the custard - not what I expected! Maybe let the crust cool a bit first before topping with custard.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe, and would have given it four forks bit it really did need to be modified. I made 1.5 times the crust which was perfect, and 2 times the amount of filling, which seemed to be the right amount (i like a lot of filling). I reduced the sugar, but they still came out extremely sweet. I would definitely make them again, but next time I will only add 2 cups of granulated sugar (keep in mind i doubled the filling recipe, so if you aren't i would only use one cup). otherwise these were pretty darn good.

This is the best lemon bar ever! It's crusty and zingy. I followed the recipe using 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the curd, but found it too sweet so I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup and it's perfect!

Really good bars. I agree with previous posts -- reduce the sugar and DEFINITELY double the lemon filling because after it comes out of the oven and cools, it sinks down. I made 1.5 times the amount of filling and it was still not enough. I also added way more lemon rind than suggested and it was delicious.

I followed the recommendation of another review and used a 9" square pan. This is the only way to go or the bars would be too thin. I didn't care for the crust so much. I thought it was rather too hard. Overall, it was really easy to make and delicious!

These were so good! I doubled the recipe and thought the thickness was just perfect... a single batch would have been too thin in my opinion. Also used lime instead of lemon but would use lemon next time because the green lime zest looked kind of weird in the yellow bars (but still tasted great). These are easy, cheap and delicious. Will definately make again.

If you like your lemon bars tangy, not too sweet, and with a perfect consistency, this is the recipe for you, providing that you double it. I also double it and bake it in two 8x8s...this has never come out badly and I've made it at least a dozen times. It's really REALLY the perfect lemon bar.

I followed the recipe exactly...and it came out tasting delicious...a bit gooey though. After reading other reviews, I wonder if I had baked the lemon mixture long enough (it was in oven for 20 minutes). The recipe said "bake until mixter is set, about 20 minutes." How set should it be? Should I have left it in longer..would that help the gooeyniss?

I made the mistake of trying these bars after having made the Lemon Bars from Gourmet '99 (on this site). These were not nearly as good - the lemon filling was waaaaayyy too sweet, despite having almost doubled the lemon, and the crust was good, not great. I didn't give them as the birthday treat they were going to be; I re-made the other recipe.

I made this as written except in a 9 inch square pan. I checked it at 20 minutes, but it wasn't set. I left it in 5 more minutes. Once cool, it was a bit creamy when I cut it into squares. I was afraid I'd ruined them, but they were wonderful. The creaminess was a heavenly texture, as was the taste. Definately my new lemon bar recipe. My guests swooned.

These tasted great, but they weren't very pretty. They were a bit bubbly on top and they crumbled apart when I took them out of the pan.

Serving Moroccan food for about 100 and needed a dessert. Well, traditional Moroccan cookies are pretty horrible to the American palate, and I threw literally hundreds away. Finally, I decided to just make these lemon bars and add almond to them, as almond and lemon are both very Moroccan flavors. They were excellent. I made a double batch, and used a jelly roll pan. I added 6 oz of blanched slivered almonds and aprox 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the crust. Made the filling with the zest and juice of 4 good sized lemons and that was about perfect. Got requests for the recipe. I did need to cook the base for about 30 minutes, and the filling for about 25.

Definitely the best lemon bars I've ever had. Per suggestions I doubled the crust and the filling and used a 9 X 13 pan. I also added toasted pistachios, ground, to the crust, which I made with regular sugar and I used a little less sugar than called for in the filling because I don't like things very sweet. I also sprinkled the top with chopped pistachio praline (see Lemon-Pistachio Tart on this site for a very easy praline recipe)instead of with powdered sugar. The filling firmed up beautifully during baking, which took more like 30 minutes than 20. Pistachios and lemons are a great combo, and everyone loved this dessert. It was rather tart, not at all too sweet, and I will make it again often. An absolutely wonderful hot weather dessert.

I made the recipe exactly as is the first time, which turned out tasting really good, but not great. The second time, I added some toasted pistachio nuts which I ground up in the food processor along with the rest of the crust ingredients, and followed the recipe as written after that. NOW they were great! Just a small change, but made a huge difference in terms of flavour, and the specks of green from the pistachios looked nice, too!

The bars were quite good - perfect balance of sweet and tart and had nice texture - but were very flat and, as such, not terribly attractive. I think a 13x9x2 pan is just too big for the amount of filling this recipe makes. Would probably make it again but will definitely use a 9x9 instead.

I made this recipe as is. Next time I make these lemon bars, I would add a pinch of salt to the base along with some almond extract as suggested by some other users. I used unsalted butter, though. Perhaps salt would not be neccessary if I used salted butter. I brought these lemon bars to work but thought the topping was way too sweet. My co-workers seemed to enjoy the bars, though. Next time, I will definately add more lemon juice to the topping and decrease the amount of sugar. The base is perfect. It crumbled in my mouth.

I used the recipe as is and baked it in a smaller dish, so I would have 1.5 times the ingredients. Took me 30 minutes to cook the shortbread and 25 to cook the lemon filling. They came out very nice, although they didn't look very appealing to me. Probably because I'm a first time lemon bar maker!

I dunno...maybe I did something wrong, but I did not like these at all - really gummy texture and the crust was wimpy. Ended up having to throw most of the batch out as my family wasn't interested...that NEVER happens in our house! Maybe because of the high altitude?? We're at 5500 feet...?

Outstanding shortbread crust made with my food processor. Doubling the recipe produced the perfect amount of crust and filling for a 10x14 pan. The only adjustment that I would make next time would be to reduce the amount of sugar for the filling. Too sweet for me. Otherwise a very good recipe.

Yum! I liked this more with some chocolate in it. I spread a thin layer of bittersweet chocolate on the crust before pouring in the lemon mixture. The slight bitterness of the chocolate went really well with the tartness of the lemon. I used more lemon juice like suggested by other reviewers.

I've made these bars twice and both times they have turned out wonderfully tart and creamy. The first time I used an equal mix of bread and pastry flour instead of all purpose flour and granulated sugar instead of powdered. Both times I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons zest and 3/4 cup lemon juice instead of the recommended amounts. The first bar's crust soaks up the lemon curd, the second produces a crust that remains seperate from the curd. Both are tasty though I prefer the first which is soft and lemony all the way through.

Rating: 3
Tasty! I didn't have lemon peel so I just added a little more lemon juice and it worked just fine. I have to physically remove my boyfriend from the kitchen to keep him from eating the whole pan! I'm going to freeze some to see how well they keep - I bet they're wonderful as a frozen treat, too! The only thing - the crust is a little rich. I might play around with it to lighten it up a little.

Delicious! I made this with double the recommended lemon juice (followed advice of another review) and it was a bit too tart. I would do 1.5 times recommended juice next time.

Like some other people recommended, I increased the lemon filling by 1.5. Next time I would just double it. Also, I only used 1 1/4 c. sugar even after increasing the lemon filling. I added 1 tsp. lemon zest to the crust and it added flavor. Although I greased the pan, the crust was sticking slightly. Next time I will line it on 2 sides with heavy duty foil or parchment and lift it out.

The first time I made the bars, I used an 8 inch square pan. I only made half the crust recipe, but made the full amount for the filling. I thought that the layers were too thin. The next time I made them I used the required 9 x 13 inch pan and doubled both the crust and the filling recipe--perfect! I also only used one cup of sugar and felt that it provided just the right amount of tang. In order not to have the confectioners sugar not melt into the bars--don't use it! You have to use a special powdered sugar that can be ordered through King Arthur Flour called "Snow White Non-melting sugar.

I should have read the reviews more closely. When rating a recipe maybe we should focus on the actual recipe other than or improved version. I saw the high % rating this a go that I did not read closely enough to see all the adjusting going on! My own fault there. These cookies were too sweet and the filling was too thin compared to the cookie. I used to have a great recipe from some beginning cooks cookbook I had back in college--maybe Betty Crocker???? Anyway this is a pretty basic recipe and once you know what is wrong you can adjust away and make this work as a base recipe. Definitely cut the sugar in the topping--SWEET. More lemon juice can not hurt and I think I would make double or 1.5x the topping keeping in mind a reduced sugar to lemon ratio. I was disappointed that these were not as yummy as I remembered!! I must find that old recipe.....

They really are perfect for a hot summer day. **Add the powdered sugar at the last moment, as it tends to melt into the bars.** I definitely recommend using less sugar than called for. And try adding blueberries as a garnish, mounded around the lemon bars. I added a pint of blueberries and they disappeared almost as quickly.

My friends challenged me to make a perfect lemon bar. I took this recipe and modified it a bit, and they were unbelievably, addictively awesome! I recommend going 1.5 times the ingredients on the filling, with 3 Tbs. of lemon zest, but keep the sugar at 1 cup; grease the pan. Also, I added a light streusel topping that I took off the Shortbread Lemon Bars on here, reducing it by 1/2, and adding 2 Tbs. of Lemon zest to it. They were 3 dimensional in flavor and texture!

The lemon bar recipe.

I have to give these a four. Although you MUST grease or nonstick spray your baking dish because they are Extremely to hard to remove if you dont. Crust is very hard so cut by using a large knife. Dont use a slice method like you would a pie or a cake to cut but more of a chop like you would vegetables or fruit. Very tangy and sour and rich so be careful not to eat big bites. I also sliced some lemons and put them on top as a decorative topping.Don't leave on lemons though because the bars will become gooey. Great with hot or iced tea as a snack or brunch.

Very easy and yummy. I only used 3/4 cup sugar since I enjoy the tartness of lemons. In the crust mixture, I added 1/2 tsp of lemon zest which improved the flavor dramatically. I also added 1 tsp lemon zest to the filling. I mixed lemon zest with the confectioner's sugar dusting, let it sit for an hour, then sifted it over the bars. Mmmmmm good.

These lemon bars were great! My friends, who usually only take one serving of dessert, were going back for seconds and thirds! I found them just a bit sweet, so I'll probably take the advice left by others and lessen the amount of sugar when I make them again tonight!

This recipe was simple to make, and tasted great. I especially loved the crust.

I made these the day my boyfriend and I broke up. I wanted to make something that tasted as sour as I felt. I used only a cup of sugar, and these were perfect.

Crust was awesome, however addition of lemon zest might truly make it "double lemon". Speaking of lemons, I found the topping with a lack of zesty, rich, full lemon flavor. I even cut down on the sugar. This was very disappointing because I thought a recipe with the name of "Double Lemon Bars" would have a lemon twist.

I thought these lemon bars were very disappointing. They were extremely sweet and sticky. I was not impressed at all. You really have to love a sugary lemon taste to appreciate this recipe.

This is absolutely wonderful. Very nice lemon flavor. I have shared it with many people that loved it!

Unless you like them extremely sweet, I would suggest cutting down the sugar to 1 cup. Also, I found I had to bake mine for almost 35 minutes to get the right consistency.

Rave reviews. Awesome, but did not keep well. Most were gone first day so not that big a deal. May try refrigerating leftovers next time.

This was a great recipe! We drizzled the bars with rasberry puree and served them with a small scoop of lemon sorbet. A perfect combination!

Delicious. Very tart lemon bars. Great with coffee. I have made these many times, with great reviews.

I ate the whole 13 X 9 pan by myself (minus the 6 that I shared with my husband)...I probably shouldn't make them again or I'll weigh a ton! These are the best I've ever made.

Wonderful! Never made lemon bars before, but these turned out beautifully and were delicious! The lemon layer seemed a little thin, though; next time I may beat the eggs longer than just "to blend" to see if it can be fluffed up.

Great Lemon Bars! Perfect combination of sweet and tart. I suggest using Meyer Lemons. I served them to a crowd of discriminating chocolate-lovers at work, and they were gonebefore 10:15am!
