Yummmmm. I just purchased tenderloin tips on sale and did not know what to do with them. This recipe was a warm & nurturing and easy meal to make. I served it with rice ans sauted arugula.

The roasted garlic was mild and delicious, and two of my guests who hate blue cheese still loved this topping.
