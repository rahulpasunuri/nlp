I made this recipe for a friend of mine who, being a long-time confirmed bachelor, eats most every meal in restaurants--good restaurants. After tasting the steak and asparagus declared "This is better than The Palm!" Enough said. On my way to the kitchen to make it again, yum!

Made this for dinner tonight. Didn't have oyster sauce so substitued fish sauce, added 2 tsp. of honey and 3 cloves minced garlic. I let the flank steak marinade in the glaze overnight as another reviewer suggested. I did not marinade the asparagus in the glaze, I just poured the remaining glaze from the flank steak prior to cooking. The steak had amazing flavor (my wife said it reminded her of mongolian bbq) and was very tender. Our kids (3 & 5) ate all their portions, had seconds and the youngest even had thirds!

how does this not have more reviews? Wow. exceptional flavor, surprising for the few and seemingly unrelated ingredients in the marinade. I made just the steak and it was fantastic. I used about a TBS grainy mustard, patted the meat dry-ish after marinating and sprinkled with salt and pepper. slice as thin and on the grain as possible.... addictive flavor....

AMAZING!! This has become one of our favorite meals! I tripled the glaze recipe and used it as a marinade instead of a glaze. I let the steak marinate overnight, then I baked it in the oven at 350 for about 25-30 minutes (maybe less, I didn't actually time it). So tender!! I also subsituted worchestire sauce and a bit of Splenda for the oyster sauce to cut out some fat and carbs. Delicious!!!

Easy and delicious glaze! I only made asparagus, and cooked it on a stove top, but I really enjoyed this recipe.

I used this recipe as a marinade for the Flank Steak and it was FANTASTIC! When I marinated the meat over night it was the best - but a few hours is great also. I have never made the asparagus with the glazed but I know the Flank Steak was really good.

This recipe is truly awesome.The ingredients blend so well together. I did add garlic powder and a splash of honey. It cuts the saltiness of the oyster sauce. The sauce gave the asparagus a wonderful taste. Lots of sauce on flank and go sparsely on the vegetable. Definitely a keeper. The cooking times are extremely accurate.

While I thought that this recipe was good, there was nothing exceptional or even very interesting about this steak. Instead, I would very strongly recommend the Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary, which never disappoints! While this was a nice steak, I don't think I'll make it a second time.

This glaze is fantastic. I have used it with tri-tip recently and it draws raves! I actually add minced garlic and 2 tlbs. of honey as suggested. I put it in a zip-lock bag and add the tri-tip to coat.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written and we loved it. My asparagus were too thin to screwer, so next time I'll look for fatter ones. I'm making it again for dinner guests this weekend - yum!

We've made this twice now and feel that this is one of the best steak glazes we've had. One of the quickest and easiest meals to make. The only change I made is adding a little garlic to the glaze but it is perfect the way it is written as well.

Fantastic! I added a bit of honey as well. Very tasty.

The steak was very good. The marinade gave it great flavor. I wish I had grilled the asparagus without it - there was no aspargus flavor at all.

Nice dish. Easy, quick, and flavorful. I agree with the other reviewer who said no additional salt was needed after being brushed withthe salty oyster sauce based glaze. Overall, My husband and i liked this recipe and we will definitely make this again in the future.

This was a good after-work dinner. I substituted the oyster sauce for fish sauce and the red-pepper flakes for hot chili sauce. It was a little salty, so I would suggest not salting until after everything is cooked.

This is a delicious, easy marinade--with or without the asparagus.
