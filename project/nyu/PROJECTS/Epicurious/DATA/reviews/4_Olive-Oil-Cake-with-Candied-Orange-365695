Made this as a slightly unusual birthday cake for my husband. The smell of the syrup cooking was heavenly. The cake is delicious, and I think the semolina flour helps create a texture that can stand up to all that syrup. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic cake! I used a light olive oil and used less sugar (about 1 Tablespoon in the syrup), consequently added more honey to the syrup, also added a little agave. Also added Grand Marnier about 1/4 cup to the syrup (really yummy)(adjust the water amount depending on how much GM you add).Taste and determine the sweetness for your own taste buds. Also, broiled the orange slices slightly to carmelize them (you can sprinkle a little olive oil on before broiling. I reduced the sugar in the cake by about half and it was perfecto. I love the idea of sprinkling pomegranate seeds, next time!

I love this cake. Made it twice for Jewish holidays, once for Rosh Hashanah and again for breaking the fast. I sprinkled pomegranate seeds on it one time and it's prettier than with the pistachios. I also used more orange zest. Everyone loves it. Next time I'll try some Grand Marnier in the syrup. I'll also try it with lemon and ginger and maybe other combinations.

I love cardamom, and semolina,and orange---but this recipe did not work for me. For such powerful ingredients, the flavor was surprisingly bland. And the cake was very wet.

QUESTION: My syrup is very watery. Is it supposed to be thicker? And if so, is there a trick to get it thicker? Thanks!

A beautiful cake with a unique taste. I think a little rum would be nice to include in the soaking part. Great for Easter or with tea...anything with a spring theme. For as good as the cake is, the batter is insane. Big and fluffy with a strong olive oil taste...maybe next time I'll only bake half of it!

I usually insist on chocolate in all of my desserts but this cake intrigued me, and I'm glad I broke free from my usual habits to try it. The semolina flour seems to add more body to the cake, and the glaze keeps it very moist. I couldn't find cardamom pods so I just added some more ground cardamom to the glaze, and I skipped the pistachios. The cake looks beautiful. I think I might try putting some brandy or rum in the glaze next time.

We made this cake for dessert for our dinner group that meets once every 4 to 6 weeks when we try out new recipes. It was outrageous in presentation and taste. I would recommend this to anyone who likes desserts!

ANSWER to the question below: The recipe states to " remove cardamom pods and seeds." That implies that both pods and seeds are used. Hope this helps. BTW, the cake looks and tastes great!

QUESTION-This is not a review, but a question- when the recipe calls for crushed cardomom pods, does that mean the actual pod itself, or the seeds inside? Thank you!

This is a wonderful, elegant yet simple cake. I didn't have orange blossom honey, so used acacia. I also had no cardamom pods, so I threw in two cinnamon sticks, some whole allspice, and a few whole cloves. (I did have the ground cardamom for the cake itself.) I also used all all-purpose flour as I had no semolina. I think I only used about 3/4 cup of the syrup, which was plenty. Despite all of these changes, the cake turned out beautifully.

Can this be made parve (Tofutti substitute)?

This cake is amazing and looks incredible. I was a bit afraid as the cake looks very dry and heavy before you fold in the egg white. Also used less syrup and the result was really good

Delicious. I served this as a sweet choice at a wine-and-cheese party. I think next time I might cut back on the syrup drizzled onto the cake because it was moist almost to the point of sogginess. Also, I think I'll substitute orange juice for half the water. Don't skip the pistachios.

Gorgeous, easy and delicious. Didn't have pistachios, so put edible flowers in the center. Used 2% Greek yogurt. To cut, I removed the orange slices, cut the cake, and put a twisted orange slice and small (edible) flower on each serving.

This cake was simple and can be made in two parts to save time for a party. I made the syrup and candied oranges a day ahead. Baked the cake while preparing the rest of our meal for a dinner party. Raved reviews from EVERYONE. Two of our guests said they never eat dessert but after tasting this one they ate a piece of it each. Fantastic flavor, moist and a beautiful dessert. I will make this again and again.

This is an amazing cake. There is enough syrup left over to make other things or to sweeten iced tea or to make a martini. I have made this twice so far.

I agree w/ the first reviewer, this makes a stunning impression. I served at a dinner party and the entire cake was eaten. Didn't have the semolina flour and substituted 1/2c all-purpose flour. The recipe makes quite a bit of syrup, which I only used 2/3. Next time,will let the cake cool for 30 minutes before piercing and pouring on the syrup. The cake is too moist coming out of the oven, maybe it was the absence of semolina flour. The candied oranges are yummy. Also, used 1/2c pistachios, which makes the presentation more dramatic.

This is truly an impressive and easy cake to make. It's also a tough cake to mess up--I made it twice, each time I made it slightly wrong (tonight I forgot to add the sugar to the egg whites--don't know where my head was at, just rushing, I guess--and folded it into the batter at the end.) It was still wonderful and received rave reviews. I used Greek yogurt which is thicker and so I used just a bit more than the recipe called for to make a smoother batter. The cake is also visually stunning--a good cake for a party.

Used Cream of Wheat for the semolina flour and, other than it being slightly grainier than it would be, worked out great. Also used more pistachios than as shown. Delicious cake.
