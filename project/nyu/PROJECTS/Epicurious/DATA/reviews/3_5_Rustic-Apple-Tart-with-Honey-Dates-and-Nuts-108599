I made this tart for Thanksgiving, and everyone thought it was the best thing on the table. The combination of nuts in the crust, dates, honey, cardamom (I only used 1tsp but will use more next time), it was a subtle and exotic departure from the traditional fare and everyone appreciated it. For the nuts I used toasted pinenuts and hazelnuts.

This was fantastic, and the amount of cardamom was fine. I added in some nutmeg as well. Substituted crushed toasted hazenuts, smashed pinenuts, and chopped toasted almonds, and used some Rome, some Granny Smith, and some Honeycrisp apples. Was going for the kind of antique recipes you see in Tuscany and the British Isles that prominently feature nuts as the chief grain used in the dish. Came out utterly delicious. I think cardamom may be an acquired taste for some, but I've been a fan of it in baked goods and even in coffee for quite some time.

Ok, I'm slightly cheating here on my review, because I didn't make it exactly as the recipe; I was looking for a vehicle to demonstrate the qualities of some high-end organic bacon and lard for a food tasting, and I settled on this recipe. Note how very little sugar is called for in the recipe! The apples, dates, and honey provide almost all of the sweetness. Very easy to put together; I subbed out rendered bacon fat for the shortening, and I had barely let it chill before mixing in! Then I ended up not making the tart for awhile and the crust sat in the fridge for five days, flavors amalgamating. So when I took it out this morning, it was a little tough to roll out, but once it got going, everything came together like perfection. The final touch; I put a half pound of mangalitsa bacon in the pan where I had cooked the apple mixture and caramelized it, then strained, drained, crumbled, and placed it on top of the apples before doing the egg wash and sugar. Boy, that was was the stuff. This will be another Farmer's Market hit, I'm sure. And such good-for-you ingredients! How could you go wrong? Buon appetito!

This is a recipe I have used often since it was first printed. It is such a wonderful change from the tired over-use of cinnamon with apples!

This is a beautiful and delicous dessert I have made many time during the past 3 years and it always gets rave reviews

I made this for a dinner party to RAVE reviews...no one thought there was too much cardamom (though perhaps since I served it after a cardamom heavy meal, that prepared the palatte well). Anyway, I thought this recipe was wonderful, and deserved a positive review among all these not-so-positive ones.

One teaspoon of cinnamon instead of cardamon makes this recipe perfect! I've already made this tart more than 10 times and each time it turned out perfect.

The tart is nearly inedible if you follow this recipe. TOO MUCH CARDAMON. It must be a typo. I threw the tart out.1/8 teaspoon would be plenty. However he crust is excellent and would make it again with cinnamin.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this tart! I agree with many others: the crust was great, but the cardamon in the filling would be better replaced with more traditional pie spices.

With modifications, this would be an excellent recipe. I hate dates, so I skipped them altogether, and used cinnamon. The crust was fantastic, but I would still work on the filling to make it more interesting. I used a silipat to bake on, rather than parchment and it slid right off after baking.

I didn't care for this tart and neither did my family. We found it kind of blah. Perhaps cinnamon would have helped. At any rate, the crust was wonderful and worked precisely as the reciped indicated. Doubt I'll make it again, there are other wonderful apple/tart recipes out there.

I crushed my own cardamom, and if I make it again, would use less (maybe 1 tsp). Everyone loved it, though, and many have asked for the recipe.

I agree with other reviewers that the crust was excellent, but the cardamom was WAY too intense. I would reduce it to 1 teaspon max, perhaps less, and add different spices. I used hazelnut honey, which pairs well with the apples and dates.

Would have given this a 3-forks rating but...I agree, the cardamon was too intense. I would reduce to 1 tsp next time and add other spices. Overall easy recipe. I used cranberries in place of the dates, but suggest using dates or raisins because the tartness of the cranberries and apples was not well balanced (and I didn't use much cranberries). Not the best free-form tart I've made, but not too bad. Would make it again with modifications.

I received this recipe to prepare for a dinner group and enjoyed the preparation. All in all, it was a hit but the strength of the cardamom was too intense. I will definately prepare this again, the crust is fabulous; however, next time I will reduce the cardamom considerably and use cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon to enhance the apples. This would also be great with pears and dried cranberries, that is what I will be preparing for Thanksgiving this year.

This recipe was fabulous. It was easy to make and everyone loved it. I used cortland apples instead of granny smiths. Will definately make this again.

This tart rocks! The recipe was a little confusing regarding the crust -- it wasn't clear whether the nuts embedded in the crust should be on the outside or the inside of the tart. Mine ended up on the outside and it was very tasty. I didn't have dates so I substituted golden raisins and then added cinnamon and nutmeg. Have made a lot of tarts in the last 2 years and this one was great.
