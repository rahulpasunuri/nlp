I cut this recipe by 1/4, since the previous reviewers did not think it held up well for leftovers. It fit perfectly into a glass loaf pan. I can see what people mean in terms of it being dry - but I felt that it wasn't so bad that I would not eat it and I will most likely make it again. I used extra basil and a whole egg, but kept all the rest of the proportions the same (but divided by 4). It was light and tasty. Watch your oven, as 55 minutes cooking time was too long for mine.

Have been making this successfully for years - love it. However, have noticed that it is NOT good prepared in advance. It becomes mealy and dry (as one reviewer noted). Best made right before eating & best eaten right away. (Unlike other lasagna which typically improves in flavor the second day.) Would be great with shredded carrot.

Very yummy! I halfed the recipe and made it for 2 and still had more left overs than we could get through. Will definitely make again,but with a 1/4 of the ingredients. Light filling dish.

This is a FABULOUS recipe--I made this today after seeing it in a collection issue of Bon Appetit, the ingredients sounded good and different than a typical lasagna. Next try, I am very much looking forward to halving the artichokes and adding both broccoli and cauliflower as we LOVE our veggies!

Made this as an Easter side dish for a five item meal, and while everybody raved and gobbled up leftovers over the following 24 hours, I was decidedly unimpressed. Not sure what prior reviews were concerned with as far as cutting the fat- it didn't seem overly rich and I thought the texture was almost mealy. I loved the look, the simplicity and the flavor was passable but my solution to make it spark would be to swap out some of the mozz for a layer of cheese with more character like raclette. And I may even substitute some of the grainy ricotta with a bechamel, which would reduce the amount of whipping cream. Overall a hit but I wanted to love it and didn't.

With the addition of garlic etc as other viewers suggested, this turned out really well. My guests went back for 3rds.

Mmmmm. this was fabulous. The artichoke flavor came through really well. I put a couple of big cloves of garlic and a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice in with the artichokes after reading that people thought the dish lacked flavor. I also used part-skim ricotta and half and half to save my arteries. Delicious lasagna variation. Will definitely make again.

Very nice dish, but doesn't freeze as well as a traditional lasagna. Best if served right after you make it. Also, I made it with 1/2 the mozzarella because I misread the recipe and it was still delicious.

This is an outstanding recipe for those who do not care for red sauces (my husband!). I added more basil than called for just to give it more flavor. This is a regular on my family menu!! I have also taken it to church potluck and have MANY requests for the recipe.

I used lowfat ricotta and half and half - tasty, but needed some garlic in with the artichokes for a bit more flavor.

Rating: 3
Perhaps I shouldn't be rating this because I did alter a bit but... I used reduced fat ricotta and non-fat half and half. I also added Dietsel Turkey bacon to the artichoke mixture and used regular frozen peas. Also,cut the recipe in half (except basil). Other than that, stayed with the recipe. I was worried about the ricotta mixture being too "pea-ee" but I thought the finished results were delicious. My husband thought it needed marinara sauce but still liked it. I think mine might have been a bit drier due to the reduced fat ingredients. I might try regular noodles next time to see if that helps the moisture content. Still, I'm not apt to sacrifice my fat and calories in this dish so I'll stay with the heart- healthier version. Very yummy!

Just don't get the fuss. It's a "fat bomb," WAY too much ricotta, odd texture. Will not make again.

Rating: 0
for once, a lasagna filling that makes more than enough for the recipe! i made this as stipulated, with just a smidge more artichokes, and found it luscious, as did my whole family. unbelievably fresh and full-flavored without garlic or onions. i will be making this again.

We love this dish. We add fake sausage (Gimme Lean is our favorite) to keep it vegetarian, but to add a little additional flavor. But good without it too!

Rating: 3
While putting this together, I was skeptical. It seemed like an awful lot of ricotta, too little artichoke, too much cheese. Then we sat down to dinner. Not only is this gorgeous to behold but it was SO delicious. It is different and surprising. I will certainly make it again. And it went very well with a bottle of Favorita.

Great vegetarian recipe. Next time I'll add sun dried tomatoes to give it a little more color and add a different flavor.

I LOVE this recipe. I was afraid the flavors would be too fresh and springy for Fall, but they are perfect for year-round. I halved the recipe and used a 9x9" pan; used jarred marinated artichokes, and added some spinach with the pea mixture (didn't change amounts of any other ingredients). I think there are a lot of variations that could work, included mushrooms, or garlic and crushed red pepper or nutmeg (though it wasn't lacking in flavor, just to give it a change). I might increase artichokes. But really, it's delicious as is. My only disappointment was in the no-boil noodles; I'd never used those before, and they seemed rather bland. But they practically could be left out and the recipe would be just as good. I might try cooked noodles next time for a little more toothsome experience.

Lovely dish--used no boil whole wheat noodles; mixture of fresh herbs instead of just basil; 1% cottage cheese instead of ricotta and 1/2&1/2. Flavor was very vibrant, moist and creamy. A repeater for sure.

Rating: 2
This was overall a good dish. The amount of whipping cream frightened me but some fat-free ricotta sort of made up for it. Ended up with a bit of a gritty texture but maybe undercooked a bit? The addition of some whole peas (not pureed) helped give it some more color and good texture.

a great twist to a traditional dish

Very tasty, would give it 3.5 stars if possible. A nice way to sneak in a lot of peas. Made it for a group of college guys with positive reviews. Followed previous cooks' advice and used half and half instead of whipping cream, and part-skim ricotta to cut down on calories. A new take on lasagna

Absolutely loved this recipe. The combination of sweet peas, artichoke, and fresh basil is perfect. I used fat free ricotta and it came out great.

Excellent, would definitely make again; I added a minced, sauted, tablespoon of garlic

This is a terrific recipe for a dinner party. I assembled it a few hours in advance and then refrgerated. I baked it a bit longer but everyone loved it! It was perfect, very soufle like and stayed together when I sliced it. No leftovers and only 6 friends over! I followed it except for the artichokes. Bottled marinated artichokes are fine....add a little extra. I used imported cheeses and I think that made the dish extra creamy.

Rating: 3
i made this with a number of modifications. sauteed the artichokes with butter and then added to a basic bechamel sauce (two tbs. butter, flour, 1 cup low fat milk). for the ricotta - i mised in the food processor one large bunch basil, 1 pound frozen peas, 2 tbs. pine nuts, part skim ricotta, garlic, salt and pepper. used homemade lasagne noodles. layered ricotta on bottom, noodle, artichoke, noodle, mozzerella (part skim), noodle, ricotta, etc. was very tasty, light and refreshing. next time might add some mint and paramesan (to make more nutty).

Made this dish for last night's potluck and it was a hit. Like others, I used marinated artichoke hearts that I drained well, regular lasagna noodles precooked, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and a blend of low fat and whole milk ricotta. It was a little bland for my taste so next time will add garlic, more basil and more artichokes. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I was only making it for one person though, so I cut everything down by quite a bit. I agree with others about leaving a few whole peas for texture. Overall, it has a wonderful fresh taste that an awsome new kind of lasagna. I will definately make this again!

Rating: 1
Substituted 2% milk for cream, part skim ricotta cheese for whole milk, traditional re-boil lasagna noodles and cilantro for basil. Also added another egg and 1/2c more milk. Perhaps if I stuck to the original ingredients, it would have been a better sell with my family. Kids aged 18m, 3y & 5y did not like. Daddy was very nice about it and ate 2 helpings with lots of salad dressing on it.

Not good.

Very disappointed - should have used traditional noodles - the top layer didn't soften at all, had hard brittle noodles on top. The mozzarella in the middle seemed to disappear. While the flavor of the artichokes and pea puree was good, I wished I'd added garlic and onion to it. Perhaps redone with boiled noodles, add some Parmesan or other cheese with a bit more of a bite to it, and it would have turned out better. As is, the left-overs were thrown out. Boyfriend did eat his whole serving, so it wasn't a 'disaster', but I was less than thrilled (highly disappointed artichoke lover)

Rating: 3
This turned out well after a few tweaks to the recipe. Having read others' complaints about it turning out dry, I baked it with the foil tightly on at 375 for 45 mins (as per the box instructions for the no-bake lasagna) and then uncovered for 10 mins, which a perfectly cooked lasagna. Also, I added garlic paste to the pea mixture. For the artichoke filling, instead of using cream, I mixed it with leftover home-made lemon garlic bechamel sauce and some chopped sun-dried tomatoes, adding to the layers of flavors. All in all, a great vegetarian main!

This was the best recipe I have tried in a long time! I have always loved traditional lasagna, so I loved trying a new version. I did add a little garlic. Make half the recipe for 2-3 people with plenty of leftovers.

Rating: 2
Very disappointing, especially given the richness of the ingredients. I get more flavor and a fraction of the fat from an easy pasta recipe: steam one bag of baby spinach until wilted, then blend with 15 ounces ricotta, a handful of parmesan, some garlic, salt, and nutmeg to taste. Toss with penne and serve.

This is a good recipe to have on board. I think some reviewers have been too harsh. I agree that the lasagna is not overwhelming with flavors besides cheese/basil/peas/artichoke, it is tasty. Definitely add roasted garlic, and for the dryness factor, submerge the lasagna noodles in a pan with water before hand and then pat dry. i made it for a dinner party, and it was very well received.

YUK - my family will eat anything and we threw the leftovers out - it was by far the worst meal I have ever made - I added roasted garlic - didn't help - it was bad!

Rating: 2
Tastes great, and I'm not even a big fan of artichokes. It was a bit dry, perhaps because of the alterations I made to lessen the consequences of polishing off the pan! (2% instead of cream, part-skim cheeses) Adding garlic seemed like a no-brainer too.

Rating: 1
My response: Blah  the only saving grace was the nice flavor of some spectacular basil - this dish would be better if you add another egg or two, maybe some chopped, roasted red pepper and you might have a nice brunch side dish -- I liked it much better than my family. The kids, who are usually good eaters, hated what they called cheese and peas and my husband made himself a turkey sandwich. FYI - I substituted 1 cup of whipping cream with fat-free half and half and used low fat ricotta and did not have any problems with the lasagna being dry like some of the other reviewers. I also used well-drained, marinated artichokes which added flavor but I still feel that the dish did not stand up to my standards as an entree - I would rather serve a spinach soufflé. lkh

If I didn't add the garlic to the artichoke mixture I am not sure I would have been as please with this as I was. I added some a layer of red pepper to second layer for color and texture. Would definitely make again. I used one container of the skim riccota and one of the regular.

wonderful EASY recipe. i used lowfat ricotta cheese, and i added a layer consisting of 1 pound of ground turkey that i browned with half of a yellow onion and three cloves of garlic, a pinch of sea salt, and coarse ground pepper. i will keep this in my arsenal!!!!!

I made this last night and i found it to be very good and somewhat light for a lasgna [it did not feel as heavy as a regular lasgna] However i did make some changes i used skim milk and a mix of part skim/ fat free cheeses to cut down on the fat. I also could not find frozen artichokes so i just used marinated ones as that was what i had on hand.

Rating: 3
This recipe surprised me - it turned out tastier than I expected. That said, I did find it a little bland - the next time I make it, I may add roasted garlic puree to the ricotta mixture, or I may try using marinated artichokes instead. I did cheat though, I didn't use all cream (some low fat milk instead) and used part-skim ricotta. My mom loved it, and even my husband liked it, and he never likes anything new!

I made this for my mother's birthday and it was delicious. I used half and half instead of the cream, and canned artichokes since I couldn't find frozen. It did turn out a bit dry; I might try increasing the half and half next time.

This turned out wonderful and delicious. I added two cups of cream (so it wouldn't go to waste.) but not having the frozen artichokes I used the marinated artichoke hearts which added another layer of flavor...was really good!!! Will make it again!

I used 2 cups of cream and added garlic - kept the rest the same. Not good enough to make again.

I added garlic, used low fat ricotta and half and half. The lasagna tasted fine, but was dry. Hubby preferred it dipped in marinara sauce. I'm not sure I'll bother pureeing the pea mixture next time - or at least not all of it. I think it would have been nice to have had whole peas in there. Any suggestions to make it less dry would be greatly appreciated! FYI, I found frozen artichoke hearts at Trader Joe's.

I used whole milk ricotta, lower fat mozzarella (and didn't use the whole amount the recipe called for) and substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for cream. I used a can of artichoke hearts instead of frozen and used regular uncooked lasagne noodles. Delicious. Our family of four ate half the first night and there were leftovers (even better!) the next day. Kids liked it. It would be good with other vegetables as well.

Rating: 0
Using milk instead of cream and part skim ricotta really cuts down on the fat and the lasagne still looks and tastes great (not dry at all!)! As for the mozzarella, it really doesn't add up to too much per serving. Also used whole wheat noodles and that worked very well! I'd definitely make it again!

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit. Here's what I changed: I used regular noodles and boiled them before I arranged the dish, like a traditional lasagna. I used part-skim ricotta and part-skim mozzarella. I used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. And I didn't brush the pan with oil before I put anything in it. I tried to lower the fat for health concerns. Next time I would brush the pan with oil and I might add a bit whole milk ricotta. It did feel a bit dry. The dish was amazing and also beautiful--although the vegetables were frozen, it felt and tasted very spring-y. It was a perfect dish for this time of year and was quite delicious. However, it is best eaten the day you make it. It really didn't match up in later days, so be sure to cook for a crowd or invite good eaters!

Tried this for Mother's Day / May Birthdays dinner as a main course for both vegetarians and meat eaters. They group loved it and I e-mailed recipes out this morning to all those in attendance. I added garlic and left some of the peas in the whole state which added to the presentation and flavor. Also used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than whipping cream. Served with a wonderful green salad with pears and apples and then an angel food cake with blueberries, strawberries and pineapple. Great spring meal with lots of color. Will make this again.

I added some onion to the pea puree, and didn't quite use all of the ricotta. There was a LOT of puree, so I didn't even use all of it, although I was pretty heavy-handed with my application. The finished product was SO AMAZING!! The puree turns into this souffle-type consistency, absolutely yummy. Hubby raved and raved.

This note goes with the review below-- I forgot to add the egg, and it turned out fine-- perhaps this made it seem less rich too?

I'd give it 3.5 stars, not quite 4. I made this last night, and it was very easy and tasted of spring. I made it as written, except I didnt puree the ricotta/pea mixture because I don't have a food processor. I might add more basil next time. It's critical to use good cheese. I served a green salad and good bread along side. Ricotta and mozarella aren't too heavy, so it's not as rich as you might think.

Rating: 0
as someone in the food business...this does sound a bit heavy but its not something to eat in huge portions. a light spring salad with a small slice would be lovely. artichokes? sweet peas? sweet fresh cream and ricotta? it sounds lovely, and i'm making it this weekend...with my typical alterations of someone who cooks professionally.

This is even better using fresh ingredients -- but a bit mroe time consuming. I live in NYC and also have trouble finding frozen artichoke hearts -- but seek them out and buy tons when I finally find them. Just keep trying different supermarkets. The brand I find most often is "C&W" -- and usually find it at one of the less fancy supermarkets. And you can do lots of great dishes with them.
