Base receipe is good BUT I (a) used fresh baby spinach rather than frozen (b) added fresh sauted mushrooms to the filling (c) added Fontina cheese to the filling sauce (d) thinned the crepe batter with another 1/2 -3/4 cups or so of milk - was way too thick

I absolutely loved the crepes themselves, and after having read the reviews, I opted to use half the spinach, and make up the difference with canned artichokes. It was tasty but next time I will use fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also, I did not care for the sauce, and feel the crepes were good without it.(too sour!)

I wouldn't make the dish as written unless I used fresh spinach which is milder, more pleasant in flavor than frozen. Also, if this is going to try for Greek flavor, given the lemon sauce, why not also add feta cheese to the spinach filling, some pine nuts, etc., to give the filling some depth. It is too much of the frozen spinach flavor. Guess 9-yo's aren't so stupid.

I read the reviews, which were mediocre, before I made this dish. Personally, I love spinach. However, I did reduce the amount needed to only 10oz of spinach for the filling, and included salmon. I first cooked the salmon filets, cut in cubes with lemon juice,and oil. I then added the spinach and dill in the pot and let it cook till the spinach was done. I then added this all to the milk mixture for the filling. This variation tasted great, and I have absolutely no complaints (other than gourmet cooking takes so long!).

I thought this dish was delicious, as did my friends. I almost didn't try it because of the previous reviews, but I'm so glad I did. Clearly Thomas, like many nine-year-olds, simply doesn't like spinach. Please leave the reviewing to the grown-ups.

This was a very disappointing receipe. Way too much spinach called for, one box would have been enough. The sauce was good - might use that for other crepe recipes.
