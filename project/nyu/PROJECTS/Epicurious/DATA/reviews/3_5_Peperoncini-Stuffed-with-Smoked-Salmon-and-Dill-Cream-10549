This recipe was ok. I had expected more from the reviews it got. I blended the ingredients in a food processor and I don't like what that did to the texture of the salmon. It made it feel like tuna. If I were to make it again I wouldn't use a food processor and I think I'd leave larger chunks of salmon.

A great favorite wherever they are taken. Use a pastry bag and nozzle to fill the peppers. I would think a baggie with a hole would be very tedious. You can buy these even at the grocery in the kitchen gadget isle.

Fabulous! A wee bit putsy, but well worth it!

try using mama lil's peppers instead of the peperoncini - they make these better than candy! I think smoked salmon is a much better way to go than proscuitto as others have recommended. The salmon blends really well and is much less expensive.

Easy, easy, easy! Definately use a ziplock bag with the corner snipped for stuffing and make in advance. These looked great displayed in a sunburst fashion around a bowl filled with the volka soaked tomatos from this site. A real hit with my guests!

This reminds me of a dish from the 60's that was much simpler, albeit more paper plateish (my euphemism for white trashy). It was a slice of that square packaged ham spread with cream cheese. Then you lay a seeded pepperocini or two in the center; roll and then slice into circles. If you're giving a paper plateish party, these are great. Teens also love them.

Holy yum!!! This was fabulous - even better a few days after making them. The only drawback is it's a time consuming appetizer, but totally worth it. If you like spice - make this just for yourself! Really think twice about making this for a bunch of people because it's so labor intensive, or just make it for those you really love!

I have been making these for 15 years and am required to bring them to every event or I dont get in! I use proscuitto instead of the salmon. Everyone seems to agree that it is better. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!

Yum!! What a fun appetizer. Our guests loved them! I doubled the recipe and took a previous reviewers recommendation a step further and did all my chopping and blending in the food processor--made it an easy process. Don't sweat it if you don't have a pastry bag--or don't want to use it. . I just mounded the filling into a quart-size ziplock and cut off a corner (keep the hole small) and just used that to fill the peppers. No muss no fuss!! Excellent!--It's great to make these the day before a party too. One less party-day prep item!

FABULOUS! Everyone loved these. I wish I would have made more. They were gone in a flash. Next time I will double the recipe.

I recently made a bunch of finger foods for a party and this one was my personal favorite! It was a little challenging to stuff the peppers (I'm not used to piping) but eventually I got the hang of it.

I have to say that as good ad this recipe was, the smoked salmon filling steals the show and, I think, was a bit overpowered by the heat of the peppers. I have since prepared the filling by throwing all ingredients in the food processor and serving for brunch with bagel chips, or at parties with crackers or toasted french bread and received a much better response. Even my my kids loved this without the peppers, saves time and really great!

Great recipe, a real hit. I served it in a dessert-appatizer buffet, and got raves!

This recipe met with rave reviews... I had multiple people tell me they were 'addicting' and couldn't stop eating them. They will definately be included in future menus. Next time I will follow the suggestion to put all the ingredients in the food processor - making the peppers much easier to fill!

I made these for a party over a year ago and people are still raving about them! A bit time consuming, but the fact that you can make them ahead is terrific.

these are the best! i too am doomed to make them for every party i give and go to. you can speed up the process and skip the chopping...just put all the filling ingredients in the food processor and pulse until smooth.

I reviewed this recipe several years ago, the first time I made it. I just want to emphasize to all of you unsuspecting folks out there that once you introduce this to your friends, you can pretty much count on making them over and over again at their request- so don't tread here unless you don't mind dealing with pastry bags! The first 2 times I didn't mind, but now I'm sure that my special little room in hell contains a pile of these ingredients, waiting to be assembled. Seriously, everyone adores them.

I made these for a party and they were a big hit. I wasn't mad about them but I'll make them again and I will leave out the butter.

Great recipe--interesting and delicious. A few suggestions on the preparation. First--40 peppers does not fill a typical serving tray, so prepare to double the recipe. Second, I threw the shallots and dill (separately) in the food processor; next time I will also process the salmon, because my pieces were too big to fit through the pastry tube--my disposable bags kept popping (not a pretty sight). A bit labor intensive, but worth it.

The suggestion of using prosciutto with basil was an awesome suggestion! I thought that was sooo much better, as I am not a huge smoked salmon fan. I loved them that way. I made them for a party last night, and I could have made twice as many and still not have had enough. I left out the butter completely, and could not tell the difference. These are a must try!!!

I have made these for parties and everyone loves them!!! I can never make enough. Once, when I was out of smoked salmon I tried prosciutto and instead of shallots I used green onion and no lemon. A nice alternative. Still very popular. four forks!!!! P.S. omit the butter (add a little more cream cheese) and use basil instead of dill. Chop prosciutto, basil and green onion very small to make piping easy.

These were fantastic. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and left in some seeds so the peppers would retain some heat as the crowd I was feeding likes spicy food. As several guests said, "these are addictive."

I am not a peperoncini fan so I was reluctant to make these, but they were great. I made them for a party and they were all gone by the end of the night. I drained and seeded the peppers two days before and then stuffed the day prior to my party.

One of my most requested recipes. These never last very long at parties and tailgates!

This sounded so good, and the previous reviews were so positive. I made this for a party, and everyone who dared to try it (some feared the potential heat) loved it ... except me. I like all the individual ingredients, but I don't like them in this combination.

Excellent and easy. I used one reviewer's suggestion to cut the tip of the baggie to pipe the stuffing in. It worked great.

This has become a staple. With some of the peppers I leave the seeds in for a little extra heat.

I made this for a cast party and was interested to see if some of the fish hating fellow actors would like it. Guess what, they ate it and thought that it was to die for! They said that they had never tried smoked salmon(because they hate fish) and were very surprised that they loved it so much. I will make this one over and over again.

People seemed to enjoy this one. The peppers can be a little spicy for some people, but the filling is to die for. I liked it because it wasn't your ordinary appetizer. I substituted a ziplock bag with a corner cut out for the pastry bag. It worked pretty well.

This is relatively easy and delicious - and can be made ahead of time. Great for Atkins dieters - appetizers with little carbs are hard to find!

This appetizer was so popular it was the first to disappear - it was incredibly easy to make too. People have already requested that I bring it again to the next get-together. Next time, I'll double the batch.
