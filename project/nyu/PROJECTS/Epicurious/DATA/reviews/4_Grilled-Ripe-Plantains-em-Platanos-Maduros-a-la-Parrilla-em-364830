I cooked the plantains on my Lynx gas grill at 450 degrees (according to the grill's thermometer) for 15 minutes per side as specified. Unfortunately, the plantains were severely charred. I suspect the temperature of 450 is too high for direct-heat cooking (that's probably why it did work for the person who cooked in the oven--indirect heat). For not figuring in direct-heat consequences, I subtracted one fork. However, when I cut off the charred portions, chopped up what was left, briefly pan-fried them in 1 tbsp oil, and served them --covered with the delicious sauce-- alongside vanilla ice cream, I truly had a delicious dessert wrapping up a Caribbean dinner. Next time, I will grill at 350 for 10 minutes per side.

This was insanely good, though I suspect that sauce would make a sandal taste fabulous. My husband, who previously swore he hated maduros, only loved tostones, is now a convert.

This was so good -- and easy! I did them in the oven at 450. Took only 10 minutes cut side down, then about 3 minutes cut side up with the sauce. Didn't get the smokey flavor a barbecue would add, but still delicious. A reminder of the tropics on a cold winter evening!

This was terrific! I loved the sweet and smoky flavor of the plantains. And it was so much easier than frying them! The vinegar gives the caramel sauce a savory component. Be sure your plantains are fully black. I had a couple that were still mottled with yellow and they tasted much starchier and drier than the fully ripe ones when cooked.

OMG, this was delicious. I've never cooked plantains before, and this was so amazing, so addictive. It could easily be served as dessert, it's so succulent. Watch the temperature on the grill carefully, mine got too hot and I had to pick off some too-brown sections. And make sure the plantains are ripe - you need to buy them at least a week in advance. Put them in a brown paper bag with some apples to help them ripen.

I absolutely love plantains, so I was a little nervous about making them at home. This was my very first attempt, and I am going to be making them sooooooo much more often now. This recipe was so amazing, There were no plantains left overs. I can't wait to make them again.

for plantain lovers... revelatory is not too big a word for this simple recipe! we are a half jamaican household and everyone here loves plantains, but as noted in the recipe, they're a pain to make/clean up after. if you're already grilling, this takes no time at all and has virtually no extra cleanup (the glaze is very easy). the smoky flavor of the grill is a glorious addition. (for those who might be wondering, you don't taste the vinegar in the final product - i have a feeling there is some sort of yumminess chemistry at work here. i used sherry vinegar because that was the one i had.) i totally need to make the rest of this menu next time!
