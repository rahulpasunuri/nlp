I like this recipe. Nice and light. And not too sweet. I have used and enjoyed the combo of cinnamon and cardamom. Also added long strips of orange zest overtop. I am going to serve this tonight with Greek yogurt.

This recipe is delicious, it is requested every year at Christmas and is now a tradition in our family.

I would use 1/2 cup of water and add 1/4 cup of triple sec/ grand marnier. It turned out a little too soupy but I still liked it

this was good and easy but nothing spectular. The fruit with a creamy Grand Marnier sauce in my opinion was much better and just as simple to make

Delicous and lite. I just love preparing this recipe. Try adding others spices, like star anise.
