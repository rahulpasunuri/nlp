Made this one again this year and it was just as wonderful as I recalled. Didn't have any rutabaga so just increased the amt of turnip and potato. This time my marjoram had thus far escaped the blows of winter, but added a bit of dried thyme as well.

This is a delicious recipe! I had to substitute the wine for about 1/3 c cider vinegar mixed with 2/3 c water because all we had was sweet dessert wine and I worried the dish might be diminished because of it, but it was truly great even so. I used just about 3.5 cups of broth and a whole cup of cream and there was plenty of sauce, so I think the 5 cups is overkill. The marjoram is key and it's nice to use fresh, but I suspect dried would work, too, as long as it's not too old. I will make this again and again because the sauce is so wonderful.

What a great comfort meal on a snowy weekend. Made the day before and followed the recipe the exactly. Did find the our vegetables were tender in 20 minutes. Love these older basic recipes. Looking forward to the left overs.

Yum. I was looking for a recipe to use the last of my CSA turnips and what a find this one was. A nice change from the typical brothy type soups/stews. I used boneless skinless thighs and then didn't bother to pour out any drippings(such great browned flavor in that fat) Used some fingerling potatoes I had on hand and just cut them into chunks with the peel on. Also used dried thyme (1/4 teaspoon this time but will likely increase in future). The marjoram in my herb garden was a bit frosty and I'm trying to be seasonal with my cooking this year. I did top with a little chopped fresh parsley to finish!! The best part is that I'm sure it's going to be even better as leftovers. Note: 30 was more than enought time to make the veggies tender so will plan to check a bit sooner next time.

Halved this recipe very successfully. Used bone-in skinless chicken thighs and removed meat from bone after cooked, while sauce was reducing. Used fresh thyme instead of marjoram. Didn't have rutabagas or turnips, but doubled up on the parsnips. Added salt and pepper at various times to adjust taste. MY FAMILY WENT NUTS FOR IT. Honestly. Surprisingly lovely.

My husband begs for this every fall/winter. Such a good, cold weather stew. I usually end up making it only once a season - as I'm not a fan of all the prep work and the back-n- forth of ingredients into the pot. But all those yummy, earthy veggies.... yummm. So when this meal comes around once a year, it is celebrated!

Made this with a bunch of substitutions: 4 small skinless chicken breasts, didn't have rutabagas so subbed more parsnips and turnips. Also subbed 2% milk and 4 Tbl flour for the whipping cream and cornstarch, and 1 extra cup wine with 4 C broth. Lastly per other recommendations, used Thyme and rosemary instead of the marjoram. All in all, a very healthy, nice winter stew. Husband liked it more than the last recipe using the root veggies... It served the purpose of using the ingredients I wanted to use, but for all of the time spent it needed a bit more spice or pizazz....as it was a slight bit bland. Might make again - it was good - but ultimately I had hoped for a more favorable result.

Nice flavor to this, but it's a lot of work! My back hurts after standing in the kitchen all afternoon. Be careful not to overcook the vegetables. Also, I feel like I want to add green peas or green beans to this. Do we have to stick with root veggies? It needs something green.

This recipe was delicious! I improvised quite a bit - used butternut squash and more parsnips instead of using rutabagas and turnip; used thighs and drumsticks (without skin); thyme and rosemary instead of marjoram. I also didn't put the cream at the end, but the stew the next day was perfectly creamy and hearty without it. Will make again.

Wonderful! The vegetables become so sweet and mellow and the chicken so tender. I skinned the thighs and that worked fine; wish I had fresh marjoram, but since I did not, I used some dried. Still, a great flavor and a highly recommeded dish.

This is the most wonderful comfort food for a chilly night; and I'd happily prepare it for company. I made exactly as written, except reduced the fat a little by using skinless thighs and 1/4 c. cream and 1/2 cup of "rich"-type fat-free milk. The veggies do take a bit of time to prepare, but the dish is so worth it. It's true, all you need is some good bread and salad (and a glass of wine) to complete a delightfull meal. Leftovers are great, and freeze well, too.

Wonderful comfort winter soup/stew for root vegetable lovers! Used boneless/skinless breasts and skinless thighs. Added small crimini mushrooms and ran out of time to do the turnips. Used half and half. Was worried about the 'soapy taste' per comments so substituted fresh thyme & rosemary for the marjoram. I split up the breast meat with a fork before serving. Delicious and raves from a hungry son. Will definitly make again. Leftovers are great and I want the turnips in there next time.

Maybe I am not as much of a root vegi fan as I thought. The dish was a lot of work and produced dismal results. I couldn't find fresh marjoram so I used dried, maybe that was the problem. Very disappointed otherwise.

This was delicious. I made a half-recipe, and it was a different, attractive, and comforting dish. A baguette for sopping up liquid is a must. Eager for leftovers tonight!

A lot of prep work, (cutting all of the veggies), but WELL worth the time! The sauce is SO delicious, I will use this again as a base for other recipes. I used fresh marjoram, like the recipe calls for, and it tasted wonderful. And, it is better the second day.

Used this recipe as a base, since I hadn't prepared a stew before, but improvised a bit. Also used thyme and a greater wine-to-broth ratio, per previous suggestions. Added celery, leeks, shallots and a bay leaf. Used a greater amount, and a variety of, carrots and potatoes. The end result was a hearty, tasty stew that was well received. I will make this again.

Delicious! Very tasty. I subsituted Thyme for the Marjoram. Also, instead of 5 cups of chicken broth I used 4 cups of broth, 1 cup of wine. I used whole milk instead of whipping cream. Will definately make this dish again. My family loved it. Don't forget the bread for dipping!

Excellent!...just the right type of scrumptious comfort fold needed for these bitterly cold winter evenings. I substituted the marjoram for thyme and a cook's dash of herbes de provence, replaced the wine with apple juice, and reduced even more fat by using 2% milk. A great dish, with just the right sweetness.

The concept is good, but majoram leaves the dish with a soapy taste that the root vegetables absorb. Next time, I'll substitute thyme for the majoram. If that doesn't work, I'll have to find some other way of winning my SO to the side of root vegetables.

I have prepared this dish many times and it is a must! Last weekend, I added celery roots, which was a great addition to the meal.

This was a fantastic recipe. It was just soupy enough, and very flavorful. I only used half the quantity called for of the chicken thighs, but next time I will use breasts instead. I didn't like the gamey flavor of the thighs, but the rest was fantastic.

Great way to introduce root vegetables to teenagers. Everyone liked it better the second day. I did not use the cream...just the cornstarch and some nonfat milk. It was great!

I love this recipe - one of my all-time favorites. If you don't often cook with parsnips, rutabagas, etc. try thwm in this stew. They are a real treat.

Truly delicious and great comfort food! I omitted the potatoes (served with garlic mashed) and turnips, added small brown mushrooms and green peas. Used 2 tins garlic herb chicken broth and 2 tins plain ch. broth, added 2 sizable sprigs fresh rosemary and a lot of fresh ground pepper, otherwise followed the recipe. The result was outstanding - rich and flavourful to the max! If you enjoy chicken stew, you will be very pleased with this one!

This is a wonderful recipe and I suggest not improvising too much. I chose to use chicken breasts and thighs and agree that skinless worked fine. Before serving I removed the bones and discarded. If you are not familiar with root vegetables and their sweetness you may be disappointed with the results. Omitting parsnips, rutabagas or turnips will produce a COMPLETELY different dish. If you are in the mood for a spicy or italian tasting dish, this is not it! I served over horseradish mashed potatoes and topped with fresh dill. Mom, Dad and Husband gave it 4 forks. I hope these comments have helped. Enjoy.

I used cubed chicken breast, potatoes instead of parsnips and omitted the rutabagas and added a can of white beans and some peas. I also omitted the cream and corn starch to cut down on fat. It turned out great, my family loved it. I will make it again.

It was truly delicious. It definitely needs to be made at least two days ahead as it gets better and better. We substituted dried marjoram, skipped cornstarch and it worked well. A great treat for clammy weather. Go crazy.

Not enough flavor, although it looked beautiful. Had to add lots of salt and pepper. Don't think I'd bother to make this one again unless i improvised on ingredients to give it more pizazz!

This is a great Friday night dinner for casual company. I have made this a few times now. I served it with the spinach and radicchio salad with mushrooms and cashews. I get to sit down and relax with my company.

I thought this was delicious! I made it as written....it is relatively low-fat even as-written, since it uses a small amount of cream/serving (even Cooking Light recipes do). I think the cream is essential. The fragant fresh marjoram makes it reminiscent of Mom's chicken soup, but it is elegant and creative. We LOVE the veggie combo called for ~ very very good. Serve with fresh rosemary bread and a delicious salad with nuts and goat cheese for a completely comforting meal! The skin didn't bother me....I really browned it well, though....

Very good. Served it in bread bowls which went over well with the whole family. Didn't use all of the vegetables, didn't have them all, but added some other favorites. Good supper for a cold winter day.

NOPE - after reading all of the reviews I was really looking forward to this - dismal failure. Maybe it just wasn't what I was in the mood for, but I didn't like this. My husband didn't dislike it, but won't request it any time soon either. Trying the chicken stew with tomatoes and white beans next - I think it may be what I am looking for.

This is a fabulous winter meal. I used fat-free half-and-half to lighten this up and it came out wonderful. This is definately a keeper!

An excellent comfy, cozy meal to share with friends. I made it for a dinner party and served it with freshly baked baguette. I do agree that the skins make the stew a bit greasy and slimy. When I made it, I left the skin on while frying (to prevent chicken from drying out) and removed it before adding chicken to the stew. Really delicious and tender. Homemade stock also a plus.

I would take the adivce of the previous poster and remove the chix. skins before cooking. they add unnecessary fat and sogginess to the dish. Regardless, this was good. I added some fresh black pepper and just a dash of salt. To make lowfat, yet keep it creamy, perhaps prepare some extra parsnips or potatoes, puree with chix. stock, and add to the stew. Either way, this is a hearty and satisfying meal, esp. when served with salad and goat cheese crostini!

Good comfort food. Hearty broth good for dipping some fresh bread in. Only thing i would change is to use skinless chicken - skin tends to get soggy in the broth. Your preference...

This was exactly what I had hoped for. I omitted the cream and added more white wine and more parsnips. Everyone loved it and asked me to forward the recipe.
