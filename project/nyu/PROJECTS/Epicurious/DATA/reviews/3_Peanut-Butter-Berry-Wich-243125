I used to work in a restaurant where we served a similar variation on a PB&J. We took it one step further though, and grilled the sandwich until it got all warm and goey. Of course, then a knife and fork become necessary, but yum!

You have to be kidding me. I clicked on the "Back to School Guide: Recipe Solutions for Picky Eaters!!!" and got one recipe - and it's for an upscale PB&J? Which I have been making variations of on my own for years? Lame.

I have made something similar to this before, so I knew it would be good. I read the reviews, though, and someone had writen about using any fresh fruit to substitute strawberries. I was out of strawberries, so I decided I would use apricots, but it didn't turn out as great as I would have liked. I will try agian using strawberries, which I am sure will be great. I also used a bagel, and even though it is very similar to a slice of bread, it wasn't as apealing.

I expect more from epicurious! Kids lunches with peanut butter? My kids aren't allergic but they aren't allowed to bring nut products to school. How about more sack-lunch friendly ideas?

Delicious all the way!

I love the idea of fresh fruit instead of jam. I tried a layer of fresh blueberries, and it was fantastic. Blueberries are firmer than strawberries. Any fresh berry would be good: blackberries, raspberries, even sliced seedless grapes.

Freeze your bread to keep it from getting soggy! I credit Emeril for this trick. Make sand on frozen bread, by the time they eat sand at lunch it will be perfect and not soggy!

Yippee! Finally someone woke up to the combination of peanut butter and cream cheese (or Neufchatel cheese). Since I was in grade school, and that was over 40 years ago, my favorite sandwich has been cream cheese and peanut butter! Add fruit, great. Hot sizzling bacon (or cold if it's a school lunch) is also a wonderful addition. I just tried it not too long ago with lettuce and tomato. That's also good. We insist on meat with every meal - with this sandwich, it's not necessary. The stickiness of the p-nut butter, the coolness of the cream cheese - DIVINE. haven't tried this particular combination, but it HAS to be good!

I just made this, but added a mashed banana instead of cream cheese. As a kid, I used to eat peanut butter, jelly, and fluff sandwiches, so this was a great alternative! The honey added the subtle sweetness that fluff used to give this sandwich. Maybe a little lemon juice might add that extra flavor that's missing?

Pretty good. I think it would be better w/out the N. cheese. Used plenty of honey.

This is something new, because most of us are use to peanut butter and jelly. With the cream cheese added to this and fresh fruit with honey drizzled on it, now that is a real treat for kids. Not so sweet kind of lunch or snack :)

Very good. Used philidelphia whipped cream cheese, which turned out really well. I do agree that I thought something was missing, but overall it was very tasty!

As a child growing up in the 70's I would have loved to make this sandwich but unfortunately all schools in Canada seem to be peanut free. This doesn't really matter if any of the children have the allergy or not! All that to say, my fav meal is a peanut butter and jam sandwich when I'm alone.

Of course completly easy to make. I thought it was missing something however my 2 1/2 yr old ate it up. This will be a new lunch time fave.
