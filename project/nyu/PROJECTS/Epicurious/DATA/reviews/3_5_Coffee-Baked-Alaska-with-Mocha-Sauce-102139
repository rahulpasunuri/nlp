I just made this dessert for the World Cup finals and it was amazing! It truly is all about the presentation.....you could use your favorite ice cream flavor with the pound cake. I will definitely be making this again.

I modified this for my son's tenth birthday. I used a med mixing bowl instead of the recommended pan so the cake was dome shaped. I used Starbucks Java Chip and went with a brownie instead of the cake (thanks to a suggestion from the previous reviewer). I even used a mix (Betty Crocker Dark Chocolate). I did use the egg shell filled w/ some brandy and lit it. My son was thrilled. The dessert really deserves three and a half stars, taste wise it is fine but it really is not cullinary feat. However, as far as the presentation goes, if you want a little wow factor after a meal,and you dont want to spend hours, this is a dessert worth making. In addition, I have to say, by adding a little food coloring to the meringue and using a bowl like I did you could really make a fabulous "volcano cake" that would surely be a hit for a child's party. As is, it is simply fun and elegant.

So very delicious. I didn't bake it quite enough and it was very difficult to cut. So easy to make and everyone was very impressed.

I love mocha ice cream desserts, and baked Alaskas present wonderfully and aren't difficult. Your guests will be impressed! To Hancock Park, CA, re flaming baked Alaskas: Julia Childs' 2nd volume gives a recipe for "La Surprise du Vesuve," a baked Alaska flambe. You could do it on any baked Alaska. Make some striations from top to bottom in your meringue. Put half an eggshell into the meringue on top of the dessert prior to browning it. While it's browning, heat a liqueur (brandy or kirsch for example -- or in this case a coffee-flavored liqueur perhaps). When the dessert comes out of the oven, pour the hot liqueur into the eggshell and ignite. Very dramatic and fun!

Could someone advise me? I would like to re-create the baked alaska's of my childhood but I REALLY WANT TO FLAME IT! Can I set this particular recipe aflame or must I ammend it somehow?

I made this for my daughters birthday, it was a hit! Simple to make. I would however, let the cake set for 10 minutes or so after baking to let the ice cream soften a bit.

I made this with Starbucks ice cream for a dinner party. It was the first time I made a baked alaska and it was easy. Our guests liked it very much, but I gave up sweets for Lent and did not eat any! I'll have to make it again so that I can try it!

I just used this recipe as a starting ground for what I made. I didn't follow this recipe hardly at all, but mine turned out wonderful and a lot more family and kid friendly. Instead of a pound cake, I made thick brownies. I used a mixture of peppermint and chocolate ice cream and followed the assembly directions (using the loaf pan is a terrific idea, a lot easier than old-fashioned freeform). I substitued 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract and a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon almond extract for the coffee liquer in the meringue and only froze it for about an hour. It still worked really well. I cooked it as directed and just put a little peppermint in chocolate sauce. It was excellent. I served it for my birthday and it presented very well. I would highly recommend trying it my way as it is has flavors everyone enjoys, much easier, and a LOT more cost efficient.

I served this for New Year's Eve & my guests were pleased. It looks like you went to a lot of trouble but it was easy & required nothing but a few days planning. I also used the Starbucks icecream & even the kids at our party loved it!

This is a simple, make-ahead, tasty enough recipe that impresses guests who enjoy the drama of "baking" ice cream without melting it. If you only have one oven, this is a fine way to produce a festive baked dessert as the finale to a roast or some other "oven" meal, as baked Alaska only requires three minutes cooking time. I got excellent results following the recipe exactly, but must note that basked Alaska is more of a "show-off" piece than a delicious dessert, a sophisticated way to serve ice cream andcake. Storebought pound cake definitely leaves something to be desired, but the hot mocha sauce was good and covers a multitude of sins. I made this with Starbuck's Italian Roast coffee ice cream, and several of my guests requested extra helpings. It is very important to follow the instructions exactly with respect to freezing times, sealing the cake to the platter, oven temps, etc., and the alcohol in the meringue is probably also crucial to texture. My husband, a scientist, cautioned me not to try this with lowfat or fat-free ice cream or yoghurt, as they would have different rates of heat conductivity that could effect the outcome.
