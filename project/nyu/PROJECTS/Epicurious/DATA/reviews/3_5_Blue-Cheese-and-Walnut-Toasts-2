I have been making thes for years now. I use roquefort cheese and I mix the walnuts right in the mixture. Also, I make this in a large batch and keep it in the freezer so I always have a quick hors d'houvre ready!

I've made these several times and they are always devoured by guests! My suggestion is to make plenty for the number of people in the crowd because they go fast!! They are so tasty and so easy - who can beat that combo?

ONLY for blue cheese lovers. i made them for a family gathering, and only a few people could handle them. i did like them, but the cook who was displeased by the smell of the cheese in the oven is right -- be prepared to open some windows/doors! i made them on a white christmas in massachusetts...chilly!

Yuck! The taste was overwhelming and the presentation was nothing special. I'm taking this one out of my recipe box.

This was a great recipe! I added chopped arugula to the blue cheese and butter mixture and toasted the walnuts in some olive oil sprinkled with black pepper. It was so good it would make you want to hurt yourself! Needless to say it was a hit!

I took this wonderful appetizer to a party where everyone was asked to bring an appetizer and everyone loved this. My dish was the only one that was empty. This is a keeper and by request for another party tonight,I was asked to make this again.

I love blue cheese but I didn't absolutely love this recipe. I had the toasts in the oven when my guests arrived and wished I hadn't because the smell was so overpowering.

This is excellent. Everyone loves it.

This is definitely "a keeper" for two reasons: can be done in advance and truly delicious! Once, by mistake, I mixed the walnuts with the blue cheese and butter - just as good!

I made far too many of these for a recent party, and guests still wound up devouring them. These simple treats are deceptively elegant.

These are VERY easy and inexpensive to make. We had them at our superbowl party and everyone loved them!

This one is sooooo good I kept all of the leftovers for myself. Great party food, doesn't make as good a presentation as some of the more colourful ones, but if you are doing a Cab or Bordeaux dinner, it's a perfect starter.

Even those averse to blue cheese will love these. They are unbelievably good. A HUGE hit at a co-ed baby shower I hosted.

This recipe is not the one shown, it should be chocolate-hazelnut waffles

Good, but I think you can leave out the step of brushing the baguette slices with melted butter. They will taste just a good and you save some fat.
