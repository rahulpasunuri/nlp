I thought this dish had very subtle and unique flavors. I followed other posters advice and increased the dried coriander and lemon juice. Very refreshing and different for a summer dinner or BBQ.

I thought the addition of bayleaf and coriander really lifted the flavour of dried white beans, which are otherwise quite bland. I'll certainly keep using this method. I also poured some white wine vinegar over the beans directly after cooking, again to lift the flavour. And I sprinkled the red onions with salt, let them stand for 15 minutes and patted them dry to extract excess moisture. Tasted great.

Very disappointed in this dish b/c it was rated so well. It was horrible tasting but it was very bland and ordinary. I love white beans and I'll continue to look for another similar recipe instead of making this again.

Made this several times and always receives rave reviews. Easy to make and can do ahead, so great for those summer barbeque partys!

Super simple to prepare, can be made a day ahead, very tasty--the olive oil, lemon juice and garlic make a wonderful fresh light dressing--and good for you! Of course it helps if you like beans.

Not bad but definately don't use vegetable oil please!! Try extra-virgin olive oil instead and use freshly chopped Basil and a little fresh red chilli in place of coriander. Needs plenty of salt and also strips of grilled red capsicum (skin removed). Tin beans can also be used, thoroughly rinsed and drained.

Very simple to prepare and always gets rave reviews. Last time I prepared using giant Peruvian beans insteand of Great Northern. It was wonderful!!!

Although I got rave reviews, the next time I make this, I will add 3 rather than 2 Tbsp. lemon juice and coriander springs rather than parsley leaves to the dressing.
