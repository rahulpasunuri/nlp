Dish is as simple as it seems, when one reads the recipe. That's good. Breast is nice. Meat, oil, some herbs and garlic - it must be good. but it is not exceptional. The sauce is a weak part, absolutely not concentrated, tarragon not intensive enough, and this green tannin taste from tomatoes... used tomatoes weren't incredibly ripened. Consider using canned italian pelati tomatoes. Dish is simple that's why one day I'll make it again with better sauce.

Made this on a very warm Sacramento evening - with my abundance of fresh tomatoes (a must) and fresh tarragon. Served it with rice and a salad - perfect and easy!

This was good but not exceptional. Simple and tasty enough for a weekday meal. I used dried tarragon - perhaps fresh would have been better.

To the Cook from New York: try dried tarragon instead of fresh tarragon, the flavor is completely different. We LOVE dried tarragon and use it often, but do not care for the same licorice taste in fresh tarragon that you did not like. It's worth a try.

For those of you not familiar with tarragon, it's got a licorice smell and taste to it that we didn't like. It was easy to prepare and would probably be great with some other herb. The sauce was really good and will be used again in our house.

I'm with Eileen--the sauce was nothing special, rather insipid. There are better recipes out there.

This is the first time on Epicurious that I've wondered what the other reviewers were raving about. There was nothing special about this dish. The tarragon and tomatoes didn't work well together, and the sauce didn't match the chicken. I wish we'd enjoyed this as much as the other reviewers.

This really was tasty, but the tomato sauce was not necessary -- for the chicken, but a *wowser* on the (steamed) zucchini!!! I will certainly make this again, and so easy, even for a weeknight!

Wow! I don't know where the tomato skin goes, but it's obviously to a better place! I cut the chicken into strips so it would marinate more thoroughly. A fabulous and incredibly easy way to use all those great summer tomatoes!

Very good. I increased the tarragon when marinating the chicken and added a tablespoon or so of chopped shallots. This was simple and delicious.

Considering we choose to make this recipe simply to trim back our overgrown Tarragon plant, we were unprepared for how delicious (and simple) this dish turned out. We even found it to taste better the next day after the flavors in the sauce had time to mingle.

I tell you what, best grilled chicken I've had. Be sure to use home-grown tomatoes or locally grown. Test the tomato sauce.....it needs some fixin'. You'll be a happy camper!! Wife says, "It's so fresh...fresh tasting."

Very good yet simple Summer sauce. Can be made very quickly and although the sauce looks rather bland and unappealing when you make it, it pops with the flavor of the chicken. I used lots of salt and pepper to spice it up a bit. Sauce works well on baked potatoes too

One of the best chicken recipes I have found. The sauce in wonderful.

Forget the sauce and save yourself work. Otherwise the chicken is great and--if you make extra--terrific for sandwiches. I've got a home-made southern-style barbecue sauce which I prefer on this. The sauce recipe came from Gourmet (I don't known what issue) but it's not online.

I HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO MAG FOR YEARS. BUT HAVING THE INDEX ONLINE, FOR ME, IS WONDERFUL. THIS WAY I CAN MAKE A SHOPPING LIST AT MY WITHOUT HAVING TO POUR THROUGH BACK ISSUES.

Awesome!! Probably the best meal I've made so far from the database. (I use it weekly). My husband and I loved it and decided it was a meal to definatly WOW dinner guests. Super easy too! Prep time was at best 5-10 minutes. I did improvise slightly. I double the recipie and used bone in chicken breasts.

I used this recipe on a camping trip with everthing prepared, and it turned out very well. Next time I would cook and reduce the tomato sauce, though. Very Simple!

Definetly would make it again. This was the first cookout of the season and it was a successful commencement of the season. Next time I will drop the tomato sauce, or at least leave out the additional tarragon. It really wasn't needed, although it did go well with the grilled veggies!

While making this dish I thought the tarragon might be too strong and overpower, but, in fact, the dish was perfect and a definite do again. Easy to do during the week for a quick, healthy meal. Went well with rice and salad.
