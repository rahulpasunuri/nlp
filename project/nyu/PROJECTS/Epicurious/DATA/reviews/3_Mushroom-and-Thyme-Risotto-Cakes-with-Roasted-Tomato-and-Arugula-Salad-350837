I haven't made these in a while but I had to come and review to counteract the unfairly negative reviews and ratings. OK, it's not vegetarian unless you swap chicken broth for veggie broth. Easy fix. These are super delicious and have a great rich, homey flavor - great comfort food, but also fancy enough for company. Warning: this makes a TON. Even when I made this for a group of 7, with everyone having one to two patties, I still had leftovers! I have no tried freezing them, but they microwave fairly well. Delicious!

Please remove from vegan or vegetarian list as this recipe is neither.

I haven't made this recipe, but i do know when you are trying to replace eggs in baking, three tablespoons of ground flax seed and equal parts water is the substitution that seems to work.

This recipe is neither vegan nor vegetarian... easy enough to sub veggie broth to make it vegetarian, but I for one am at a loss for how to replace the eggs to make it vegan.
