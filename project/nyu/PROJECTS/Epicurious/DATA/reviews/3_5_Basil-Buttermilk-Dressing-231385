For me, this recipe is a good start but it's not there yet. Two tbsp of chopped basil wasn't quite enough, and I doubled that. I also added an equal amount of flat leaf parsley for some fresh 'green' flavour. I also added a tbsp of honey to add some depth. I'll definitely keep playing with this. Good find.

Delish! Pressed sm garlic clove into BulletBlender container, added a sprinkle of salt, rest of ingredients, and maybe 1 T of crumbled stilton, lots of pepper. Gorgeous light green color and lovely, light but rich flavor. Can't wait to put it on our grilled romaine with a few toasted nuts.

Taking a cue from another reviewer, I decided to spice things up by substituting cilantro and half of a seeded jalapeno pepper. The dressing was very good after it had been left to marinate in the fridge overnight. I am sure it would be delicious with fresh basil as well. The buttermilk base is very thick, and I found that I preferred it as a dip with crudites. If you want to use the dressing for salad greens, make sure you choose one with a hearty leaf such as romaine.

Delicious with arugula and tomato for a simple salad. I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and some fresh black pepper for a little bit extra something. Yum!

Nice light flavor. Simple to make. Consistency is runny, though. I'd like it to cling to the salad a little more. Maybe next time I'll add a little cottage cheese to the mixture and blast it all in a blender.

I tweaked it a bit, adding fresh parsley and a pinch of cayenne.

This was a good use of the buttermilk I had leftover from the red velvet cake, yet it seemed something was missing. I didn't find it tangy at all, and added 6 cloved of garlic to boot. The salt rang through clear as a bell even though I used precisely 1/4 teaspoon... Overall, the flavors were salt, cream and basil. It leaves me wondering what the missing taste that I expected could possibly have been...

So easy and well received. Great with avocado too!

I made this dressing to use up some fresh basil. It was good, but I made a similar one a few days ago with simply mayo, a splash of milk, basil, and salt, which was much tastier.

This recipe or one VERY similar was in Bon Appetit a few years ago as a dressing for sliced tomatos. It's great on sliced tomatos with some finely sliced basil sprinkled over for garnish.

I poured this over iceberg wedges and served it with barbecued ribs on a very hot summer night. The delicious salad was the most refreshing part of the meal. (The next morning, my 11-year-old daughter's friend asked me for the recipe "so my mom can make it too".) I'm going to make a large quantity of this and just keep it on hand in the fridge. Can't wait to try it with other salad greens.

Pure summer flavor, great on lettuces or green beans or just your index finger. I shall try this on pasta salad with tomatoes and green beans and corn and shall probably love it!

The taste is great......we drizzled it over a grilled chicken salad with lettuce, roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and, of all things, bosc pears. I will definitely make it again.
