Superb. Not a huge fan of the grilled avocado, but excellent with raw avocado. Also do bacon sometimes, omit it sometimes. This is our favorite burger recipes!

Yum - it's gone into summer rotation! A couple tweaks that I found made this dish even better. To start, I found the burger mix dry and unbalanced. Overall, the dish seemed to be lacking sweetness. I added burger mix ingredients to Chipotle BBQ sauce (or regular sauce, 1 tbsp per burger), which I mixed right into the patty. I also added a ring of grilled pineapple to add a touch of sweet to balance the chipotle heat. Served open face on a ciabatta bun and used all ingredients to create an elegant and artistic stack effect with cilantro on top. Instead of bacon, I pan friend thin pancetta, which I think added to the taste and overall artistic look of the dish.

FANTASTIC! Don't change a thing. Make extra sauce!

Overall, the burger was quite satisfying, although I found the chipotle sauce to be a little too spicy for my taste (or perhaps I put too much chipotle into the sauce?). Perhaps I'm more of a "savory burger" type of person, but I felt that the chipotle sauce drowned out the savoriness of the burger.

This may be one of the most flavorful, delicious burgers we've ever made! The chipotle in adobo and paprika in the burger meat added another dimension as did the cilantro. Definitely try this recipe!

Over the top fabulous for a burger. Didn't change a thing.

Be sure to use lots of the mayonnaise sauce; I skimped too much (1.5 Tbsp or so per each) and it felt like the burgers needed a little more. Onion needed more than 4 minutes on the grill, and even so my wife complained they were too strong. Everybody raved anyway.

I was happily surprised by the way all of the flavors blended in this burger. Wow! It was SO good! The avocado added a creamy richness that made me coin the phrase, 'eye-closin' good! Mmmm!

Just made this for guests. They LOVED it and had to forward them the link. Yum! The Aioli makes it! Tried it once w/ fat free yoghurt instead of mayo. It was a no go!

EXCELLENT recipe. Only thing I did differently is that I cooked in a cast iron skillet, as I like the crust that only a flat-top cooking surface can give to a burger. I cooked the bacon in the skillet first, and left a bit of the grease in the pan for when I did the burger to give it even more flavour, and these were AWESOME. The mayo is fantastic, as is the addition of the avocado - wouldn't be the same without it.

The mayo is the hit here. And the thick grilled onion. I did use super lean beef and cooked it on my George Foreman grill and burnt the bacon but the flavors were all there. I can tell this would just be awesome on a real grill! And with fattier meat. It was yummy!

I made a couple of these tonight, and even though I wasn't willing to cough up £1 for a tiny avocado, this was great. I didn't have mayonnaise, so made my own after I'd mixed and formed the patties and let them rest in the fridge. As it was pissing rain, I cooked everything in a cast iron skillet, which worked out just fine. I even forgot the cilantro, but was still more than happy; moist, smoky, slightly spicy, and rich! A keeper for sure.

Usually we avoid a burger like this (fat content), but since it was the Fourthof July weekend, we splurged. Had an old friend over and we all just loved this burger. The flavor was terrific. The sauce was a bit runny, but other than that it was a real treat. I've been telling everyone about this recipe

I made this Saturday night with freshly ground beef. I did skip the avocado but otherwise made as directed. Very tasty but not my favorite.

This is such a great burger, just as suggested! We thought the heat was perfect--just a hint, so as not to challenge palates that don't like spicy food. The mayo was a great addition. I had everyone assemble their own burger to taste and just happened to have smoked swiss cheese, which was an amazing addition.

Yummmm! Omitted the bacon for caloric reasons, didn't grill the avocado and onion for laziness reasons. Loved the secret sauce. Would make again!

Made these for a 4th of July picnic. Loved them. Omitted the bacon due to calories, didn't bother to grill the avocado or red onion due to laziness, Loved the "secret sauce" Minced up the chipotles for more even distribution in burgers. Will for sure make these again. Guests wanted the recipe (the ultimate test)

To the cook from Hawaii, there are three smoked ingredients contained in this recipe, hence the "triple smoke": bacon, chipotles and smoked paprika. All contribute to a smokey flavour.

Recipe was easy to follow and the results were a hit with my guests. The bacon and avocado were perfect additions.
