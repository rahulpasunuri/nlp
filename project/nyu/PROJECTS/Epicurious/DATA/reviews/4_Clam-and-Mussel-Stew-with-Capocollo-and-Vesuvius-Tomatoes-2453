I've made this several times. It's outstanding. I think this would be a great base for adding other shellfish too.

I have made this recipe many times with great success. It's the perfect meal for cold, rainy days and it's easy to make for a crowd. Make sure you've got plenty of good bread to serve with it.

This recipe was incredible! The Vesuvius tomatoes themselves were superb (had a hard time not eating them all before adding) and I would use just that part of this recipe for other things. I served this with fresh baguette slices to sop up broth! Excellent!
