I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday - I should have taken a test run before the holiday. We all concluded that this pie was entirely too sweet. I like figs, but after making this recipe, I prefer traditional pecan pie.

I found this recipe to be a disappointment. The recipe specifically says to bake until the center is set, and after the 40 minute baking time at 325, it was not set at all-it was liquid. I had to bake an extra 15 minutes until the pie wasn't sloshing around when moved. The flavor is good, so I may try again. The brandied whipped cream is a keeper and is also great on pumpkin pie.

This pie really is delicious but I gave the original recipe 3 forks, because I tweaked it and would change it a bit more to give it 4 forks. So as is, it's good, but here's what I did and would do again: Use less corn syrup. I'm generally not a fan of pecan pie because it's so sweet, and given that the figs have a natural sweetness, I'd cut back on the corn syrup. I used Poire William pear brandy both in the pie and in the whipped cream and it was great! The pear flavor built on the depth of the figs. And like other cooks here, I'd recommend chopping the pecans, it made it a lot easier to cut.

My pie looked exactly like the pie pictured, with a slightly runny filling. But as other reviewers have said, the filling solidified and flavors blended by the second day. My family liked it, but didn't ! LOVE ! it. I'll probably continue on my search for the perfect pecan pie!

Delicious recipe and easy to make. My family is requesting this for our Christmas dinner as well. This pie will be a tradition from now on.

delicious. i used dried figs, as fresh ones were out of season, and it tasted great. the filling is the perfect consistency--not goopy the way some pecan pies can be.

Excellent pie. The second time I used black mission figs instead of calimyrnas -- much better. They are moister figs with fewer, smaller seeds. The pie is a lot quieter inside your head. Letting them swim around in the brandy before heating them is an excellent plan.

This is theeee BEST pie recipe out there for pecan pie. I have never enjoyed pecan pie(it was always so hard and icky) but this recipe is amazing. I think everyone out there should try it and believe me---everyone you treat to this will love it.

Great flavor, texture

This pie is absolutely delicious- just needs a little tweaking! The flavors combine to a moist and sweet but never tacky consistency as long as the pie is refrgierated overnight. I made this pie and let it cool as the recipe claimed but the filling was soupy. So, I refrigerated it overnight and the next day the pie was to die for! The filling molded together in a smooth gel but was not sticky at all. I didn't make the crust but I did make the whipped cream. I couldn't really pick up the brandy flavor. In any event, I would definitely recommend this pie- the figs give the pie a rustic-type flavor without being too sweet and also provides a little moisture. Mmmmmmm!

Next to the Bourbon-orange pecan pie with bourbon whipped cream, this is my second favorite. The figs give this pie a really nice texture and added flavor.

I made this and a traditional pecan pie for Thanksgiving and this pie sorta got picked at but not eaten while the traditional one was eaten. Will not make again.

I made this pie lst Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The figs add a depth of flavor and texture compated to traditional pecan pie. I used my own standard pie crust, so no problems there.

A DELICIOUS variation on the pecan pie. Made it last night for the first time and my guests loved it and asked for a recipe. I will make it again for Thanksgiving. However there are a few small shortcomings in the recipe. 1) I agree with cook from NY that there is not enough dough for an overhang. 2) The dough is a little tricky to manage because it tears easily. 3) The crust puffs up and shrinks during the second stage of baking (after taking out the pie weights) and I am not sure how to remedy this. 4) The pie was impossible to cut because of pecan halves and I had to use a spoon to serve it. I'll try it with chopped pecans next time or else continue using a spoon to serve it :). A great pie nonetheless.

I've made this receipe twice now, to rave reviews both times. It is not as sweet as traditional pecan pie. The second time I made it I didn't have enough figs, so I substituted half candied orange peel, and it was even better. I also used calvados to rehydrate the dried fruit.

This was delicious! Somewhat lighter than traditional pecan pie. I used a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, I also ran out of light corn syrup, so I substituted about 1/4 cup dark. The only problem I had was with the crust, it was also delicious, but there wasn't quite enough for an overhang, maybe I just didn't roll it out thin enough.

This pie was fantastic, but I think I would maybe macerate the figs in the brandy first and then cook them of on the stovetop with just the brandy and no water so the flavor comes through. Also, i found the crust a little too flaky, but that too is easy to remedy. Wonderful pie all in alll!

This is an awesome pie. A keeper to make each year.

i'm not a pecan-pie aficionado; i loved it. (i made it for a pecan-pie fiend; he didn't care for it--he missed the more classic taste, which is, as others have said, too candy-sweet for me.) this is plenty sweet, however. i'd add more brandy to the whipped cream. required 15 minutes more time than recipe indicates (i used a reliable thermometer). i needed to put it in the fridge to fully firm. i don't often eat pecan pie so i don't know if it's usually served refrigerated, but i found it better when cold than when warm.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving last year and my friends and family are STILL talking about it. It is definitely a "required pie" now for all our major holidays!

This is a good pie, but I guess I'm a traditionalist who prefers my mom's basic recipe.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. My mom (and my harshest critic) said that it was the best pecan pie she'd ever had. The figs are subtle, but necessary. This recipe will definitely reappear on our table--probably before next Thanksgiving.

I made this for dessert for our New Year's Day dinner, and it was a hit with my husband and with our guests. As others have mentioned, the figs and brandy cut the often cloying sweetness of pecan pie, as well as adding texture. I did not have time to mess with all the steps required by the accompanying pie crust recipe, so I used my regular recipe, not prebaked, and it turned out fine. It took about 70 minutes for the pie to cook enough to set.

Excellent pie. Not as syrupy-sweet as your typical pecan pie and with a great flavor/texture dimension added by the figs. This will be my new pecan pie recipe for holiday meals.

Absolutely incredibly delicious and irresistable. Destined to become a holiday tradition.

As a pecan pie lover from way back, I'm pretty picky. This has to be one of the best I've ever had, much less made! Rich without being overly sweet, and the figs add an earthiness and great crunch! What a combo! This is a winner!

Deeeelicious. The figs add another taste and texture dimension to this wonderful pie, slightly reminiscent of fig newtons. Everyone loved it. Very rich.

The very best pecan pie I've ever had, bar none.
