This is a very special dessert. Even better -- most of it can be made ahead of time and assembled several hours before serving. I made my own sponge cake (recipe from Joy of Cooking) because I'm a bit of a purist. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe, using frozen berries for the interior and fresh for the top. I need to work on assembly so it looks a little prettier. I would like to try just as chocolate and raspberry and maybe a syrup with Frangelico instead of cognac.

I got more rave reviews from this recipe than from any other recipe I've ever made! The presentation is gorgeous and the taste was superb! I wasn't sure how it would turn out because I made a few substitutions (e.g. vanilla extract instead of the vanilla bean, and angel food cake instead of pound cake), but it was a definite hit. I would definitely make it again.

You're right, cook from Tampa. This is a picture of the Christmas Cranberry, Pear and Walnut Torte with Cream Cheese-Orange Frosting. The only reason I know this is because I looked at the torte recipe a few minutes ago.

Call me wacky, but what part of the assembly makes it look like the photo?

The directions for the pastry cream were more complicated than need be. The first time I did it, everything got too foamy using mixer, then when I heated it, it thickened too quickly and was lumpy - tossed it out. Try #2. Mixed sugar with milk and espresso powder. Wisked one tablespoon of corn starch into yolks. wisked some hot milk into yolk mixture, then added back to hot milk and cooked to thicken. It thickened pretty quickly but was smooth. I question if corn starch is even needed. Very pretty & tasty. Used frozen berries for inside and fresh on top.

This is a great dessert for a big meal. Even though the custard is thick, it is not too rich. I was able to not use the vanilla bean and it came out fine. I thought Raspberry jelly added more flavor than the currant. Fairly easy to make and very pretty with the raspberries.

Excellent flavor combination and impressive presentation. To lighten it up, I used fat-free angel food cake and fat-free Cool Whip (in place of the whipping cream), and it turned out great. I did not have a trifle bowl and the step of adding a layer of plain whipped cream on top didn't make much sense to me; so, in place of the step that requires putting the custard mixture on the fourth cake layer, I combined the remaining custard mixture with the reserved 1.5 cups of Cool-Whip, and then "frosted" the entire trifle (sides and top) with this mixture. I then finished by placing raspberries on the top in a decorative arrangement, and presented the dessert on an ordinary cake stand. This was definitely a hit with friends and family, and I will certainly make this again.

This dessert makes an entrance like a moviestar--simply incredible. My group of friends loved that it wasn't too rich or too sweet, and it tasted even better the second day. Finding a pre-made cake proved impossible, so I simply used a yellow cake mix.

Made this as the finishing touch to a Valentines Day dinner party and it was a hit. Reicpe seems difficult but don't let it discourage you, it is well worth the work. The photo doesn't match the actual presentation according to the recipe.

This turned out beautifully! Not messy at all. I made the pound cake myself ahead of time and refrigerated it. Everything layered perfectly and looked awesome in my trifle bowl. Scooped out great. I might try again with a different fruit, since I hate raspberry seeds in my teeth!

This was an easy recipe yet one that had a beautiful presentation. I made it for a holiday open house and everyone raved about its appearance and taste. The mocha creme was light with just the right chocolate taste. Set off nicely by the currants which had a bit of a tart taste, it was spectacular!

I agree with one of the previous reviews, this recipe is messy, but my father in law loves it! He has already asked me to make it twice for Christmas, and having married an Irish man, trifle is always required for holiday gatherings. I had a lot of trouble finding pre-made cake layers, so I made my own, and used frozen raspberries, and it came out fine. Just use fresh for garnish.

Yuck! As a trifle lover, ithought this was an absolute disaster. It was so dense that my trifle loving family (we are from the UK) couldn't eat more than a few bites. I even made the sponge cake fresh so that it was light but the combination of chocolate mousse and syrupy fruit was so overpowering! My recommendation - stick to a basic trifle recipe with cake and custard and add to that recipe without going as overboard as this conglomeration of sludge. The one fork I am giving it is because, yeah, it does look pretty fancy!

This trifle is delicious and provides a very pretty presentation for the holidays. Don't forget the ribbon around the trifle bowl!
