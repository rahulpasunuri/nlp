We made this last night. Substituted some leftover turkey from the freezer and cabbage per another reviewer's suggestion. This soup is DELICIOUS--flavorful and filling. It was also pretty quick to make and easy to assemble. I think we'll be making this more often.

This reminds me of a Hawaiian recipe that I grew up on called Chicken Long Rice. The main difference is that you use bean thread noodles made from mung beans. Also no spinach. I used bone-in chicken thighs and everything went well with the broth. I did add another splash of shaoshing wine before adding the noodles to accentuate more of the flavor. I also added back in the chicken meat to make it more substantial. Sprinkled apprx. 1T. of garlic and ginger infused peanut oil, then added the spinach. Turned off stove and let residual heat wilt the spinach. Will probably make again but substitute napa cabbage for spinach as it added a bitterness to the final product.

This is a wonderful broth. I used chicken thighs, skin included, and skimmed the fat. I cheated and added the cooked meat to the soup. Instead of putting spinach in the soup, I placed it in the bottom of soup bowls and poured broth over. Really delicious flavor.
