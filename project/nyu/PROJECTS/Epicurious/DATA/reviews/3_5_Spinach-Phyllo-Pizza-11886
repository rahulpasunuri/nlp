Very good!! The phyllo I purchased was only 9"x14" so I made two--really just needed a little extra cheese to do this. Worth dealing with phyllo--which I don't usually do! I'll definately do again--perhaps with the recommendations of the other posters. . . fresh mozzarella tomatos and basil!. . . hmm. . . and a little balsamic drizzled before serving??

This recipe was easy and delicious. I would recommend defrosting the phyllo in the refrigerator overnight. You can also use a misto filled with olive oil (instead of butter) to spray oil on each of the sheets of phyllo. Is it is much easier and better for you!

I used 1.5 bags of pre-washed spinach that I rinsed in a colander before cooking, and I bought garlic and herb flavored feta cheese. The crust may need less time in the oven...mine was nicely golden after about 4 minutes...maybe this is a high altitude adjustment? It is important to get as much moisture out of the spinach as you can so the crust doesn't get mushy in spots. My spouse's only constructive comment was that the pizza was a little too oily, so maybe next time I'll skip the extra olive oil on top since there's so much butter & cheese in the crust. We really enjoyed this recipe, so we started brainstorming other toppings for the crust. To use the leftover phyllo, later in the week I made a caprese version with fresh mozzerella, fresh basil, thinly sliced plum tomatoes, and dried oregano. I also put sundried tomatoes on 1/2 of it since my spouse likes them. In addition, I sauted a clove of minced garlic in a TB of butter to add to the butter that I used for the crust. Next I'm going to try a flaked smoked salmon version with cream cheese, fresh dill, red onion, and capers...

This recipe has always been a big hit at some of our larger gatherings, and I have found it easy to make at the last minute in large quantities. I do however give it the addition of rather coarse sea salt and several grindings of fresh black pepper.

Reminded me of Spanokopita--but much easier to make and to enjoy. Great for Greek themed dinner parties.

I have made this twice for cocktail parties. One recipe request which I emailed from this spot.
