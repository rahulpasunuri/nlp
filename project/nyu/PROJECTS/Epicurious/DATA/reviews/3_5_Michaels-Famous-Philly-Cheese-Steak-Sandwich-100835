This was okay, growing up in Wilm. DE, I was looking forward to an authentic Philly Cheesesteak. I found this sandwich to be kind of dry and lacking in flavor. I will check out the patskingofsteaks website, also I agree that the peppers should be hot or pickled, not bell.

Followed this recipe to a tee. Found it rather bland. Don't know if it's something I did wrong but I certainly hope the cheese steaks in Philly have more flavour than this one.

What a great recipe for a rushed evening dinner.

Used London Broil that the butcher sliced extra thin on the meat slicer. The whole family thought they were excellent sandwiches.

I've been to some local philly cheesesteak places and some of the locals swear by this one place that serves cheezewhiz on the sandwich. They made me get one and it was surprisingly very good. Note: added 6/22/04 - for a real local philly cheesesteak shop with recipes and history check out: http://www.patskingofsteaks.com/index.htm

Great - my husband and son loved it. I sliced both the peppers (2 red bell, not 4) and the red onion thin. I think the thick - thin becomes personal preference. We had fontina cheese since it was left over from New Year's. Simple and good.

YO, GUYS! I am a proud Philadelphian who is sick and tired of the cheesesteak debate! Everytime I take a visiting friend to one of the Top 3 places to indulge in our signature sandwich, they are so intimidated that they can't even mumble with or without when placing their order.I want Philadelphia to be known as the "City that loves you back" not the City who Boos Santa Clause. So enjoy whatever cheese, peppers etc. that you prefer. But please, hold the Mayo!

I agree with the cook from Philly. When you go to philly to get one you never see the bell peppers. The bell peppers just masks the flavor of the meat that you choose to use. In stead of Using a jullienne beef try a deli slice. it seems to retain more of the flavor. I prefer to use a vadilla onion thick slice and provolone cheese. I have never heard of American or cheese whiz. That sounds like and Arby's sandwich. I lived half of mylife in Chicago and they put the bell peppers on and man you can really tell the difference. I run this sandwich on my menu and it is one of my best sellers. I also serve a little aujus on the side.

I am from Philly, South Philly to be exact. We don't ever, ever, ever put bell peppers on a cheese steak sandwich. Hot cherry peppers is the way to go. The cheese to me is a personal preference. I prefer provolone. Tony Luke's is the place to go for a Chicken Italiano sandwich; Geno's is the place to go for a steak sandwich.

As a corporate cook and assistant chef I like the way this recipe prepares its meat to cook. That is its chief quality. Usually flank steak or round steak is used in most steak sandwiches commercially. This seems to give a better form to cook thin meat to temp than any I have heard of. Otherwise, the bread, the mushrooms and onions and peppers, the cheese, and all the rest has been explored in endless variety by now! Take your pick as to your fave........

Reviews about a recipe's "authenticity" really urk me. Truly, authenticity is in the mouth of the eater. This recipe makes no claims to be authentic, merely "famous."

would add velveeta with the provolone.

To correct Jeni Crocker...In Pat's recipe, Velveeta is not mentioned. Cheez Whiz is the "cheese" of choice with provolone and american as optional choices. I know this and I'm from Minnesota.

I liked it i had it for dinner with my family and my daughter said it was good and thats saying a lot because she doesn't like that many kind of philly cheese Steak sandwhiches.

For a *real* Philly steak go to Tony Luke's at Front and Oregon. Pat's and Geno's? - tourists traps. Velveeta? Cheez Wiz? American? Amateurs! It's got to be provolone!

How in the world can a citizen caramelize onions without letting them brown? Also, caramelized over low heat in 8 minutes?? Who wrote this recipe?

In Philadelphia (where I'm from) we DON'T use bell peppers on cheesesteaks EVER, if you want peppers they throw on the traditional "sweet peppers", also PROVOLONE?? At Pat's (the #1 place in philly to get a cheesesteak) its basically Velvetta, other places its american, its NEVER provolone.. if you get a pizza steak it mitght have mozz or provolone!
