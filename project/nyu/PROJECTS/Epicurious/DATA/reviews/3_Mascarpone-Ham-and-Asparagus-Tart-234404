I thought the filling was really gross. We tried to eat it and ended up taking the arugula, ham, and asparagus out of the tart and eating them as a salad.

Loved it! Super easy and really yummy. Made mine with prosciutto and a whole-wheat pie crust.

If the pound of asparagus was listed above the drop in large pan of salted water, I think the recipe would sound more clear.

I made this and used toasted baguette slices instead of a pie crust. I finely chopped the arugula and asparagus mixture and had about half of it left over. But people LOVED it.

Really goood. Made this after Easter with leftover ham and not shaved ham as suggested. Really good!

After I deciphered the instructions (which look like they've been badly translated from a foreign language!) I gave this a try but with some variations. I only had puff pastry to hand so I made two rectangular "cases" by marking out a border on the pastry, baking it till golden, and patting down the central part. Then I filled these cases with the mascarpone mixture. I recommend using very good quality ham (I had some San Daniele - very nice) and also some fine young asparagus for tenderness and flavour. A nice filling with good flavour but there was a lot of it - no idea how you are supposed to fit it all in to one pastry case.

I sent this recipe to my mother so she could make it. I'm eating it right now and it is SO Delicious! I am getting the day 2 version and I'm eating it nice and chilled... I think she varied the arugula using mixed greens along with it, she has strips of thin ham mixed in...This is DEFINTELY something I'll make now!! Yum!

I haven't made this dish, but I didn't have any trouble understanding the recipe. It appears the recipe follows the Joy of Cooking format, which takes some getting used to. I'm going to try it!

I haven't tried this recipe and don't think I will based on the poor directions.

To EaglesNest: Drop the asparagus into the salted water, cook for 3 min. & slice spears. My review: This tart is pretty simple & easy to make. The extra filling can be simply refrigerated & used in another recipe (ie: omelet).

What am I supposed to drop in the salted water!? The tart filling or the asparagus? How much asparagus? How much ham. Who wrote this? I agree with Rozyjokowski,Portland,Oregon

Did anyone read this recipe? or Proof it in a test kitchen? Amazing the amount of content for one pie crust, and the directions are out of whack. Try again.

I served this at my book club, and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. Very easy to make. I didn't have the arugula, so left out, and only used 100g of ham (about 1/4lb) - actually prosciutto, and still had more topping than I could fit on the tart. Great dish.

Very nice dish. I made this for Easter brunch and it was quite a hit. I did add more lemon juice and zest, and I did not use all of the ham, asparagus, arugula mixture. I think you could cut back on the amount called for, but I will serve this again!
