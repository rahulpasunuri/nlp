I Was looking for a last-minute idea on grilling trout for dinner tonight- YUM! Used the black beans & spinach I had on hand, and with grilled asparagus, it made a perfect dinner ready in about 30 minutes!

This recipe could not be any better! I have made it many times. I usually use different greens since I don't have arugula on hand. Delicious!

So good. Used 1/2 the butter, regular balsamic instead of white, added more olive oil to make it liquid, plus a little sherry vinegar. I just drizzled a little of the vinaigrette over the flesh of the trout, then closed the trout and cooked on the grill. The rest of the vinaigrette I put on the beans. Added extra arugula. SOOOO good.

LOVED it! Made it with halibut because WF didn't have trout. Followed recipe but may have overcooked beans slightly. Next time I'll soak my own beans and make.

This is a standby at our house. I use whatever white fish is fresh at the market. My kids love the beans. I double or triple the beans (but not the vinaigrette) and add way more arugula. I substitute olive oil for the butter and add all of the vinaigrette to the beans. Cooking the fish on top of the rosemary branches with a drizzle of olive oil gives the fish a nice flavor and last night I ran out of capers so I chopped some olives and grilled some cherry tomatoes and served that over the fish. Delish!

I made this recipe with local whitefish filets--skin on--and it was wonderful. I did substitute olive oil for 1/2 of the butter. The beans were as well liked as the fish and the whole meal was super easy and as I had prepped ahead I had dinner on the table 15 min after we returned from an evening sail on the bay!

Still the yummiest 4th time preparing.

This was delicious, quick and easy. Even better, it's gluten-free! We'll definitely make it again.

The white beans and caper vinaigrette were fabulous. Will definitely be keeping this recipe as a go to side dish. Yum.

Absolutely delightful dish, the vinaigrette is ridiculously good. It's getting chilly out so we cooked the fish on a grill pan instead of the outside grill. White beans & capers were good, but nothing to call home about. The fish & vinaigrette is going to become a staple though, I'm sure you could substitute just about any white flaky fish for trout if needed.

This was really delicious! Didn't make the beans, just the fish. Will use the recipe again with other fish too.

The beans are amazing. For whatever reason, the vinaigrette added almost no flavor to the trout when I made it. I might try putting on more than "a little" and letting it sit for 15 min. or so before grilling.

Great recipe-I did not grill the trout flesh side down but brushed the inside with the dressing, s&p and added an 8inch sprig of rosemary and more finely grated (micro planed) lemon zest to the inside -then tied it up and placed the whole fish on the grill. included some smoking wood chips to enhance the overall flavor. Fish was moist and wonderfully flavored. This is a keeper.

My husband and I thought this was good. I couldn't find trout so I used red snapper instead. The vinaigrette has such great flavor that it could be used on almost any fish, I should think. I was expecting the arugula to wilt when put in with the beans, but it didn't - not sure if it was supposed to? I will make this again!

Delicious. We like more greens so I used lots of fresh spinach in addition to the arugula. Will make again!

This recipe is a standard in our house. Awesome taste and waaaay easy to make. I've passed this recipe along to several of my foodie friends and they all rave. I'm not a big fan of Balsamic vinegar so I cut it down a little and use white balsamic instead.

Tasty, fast, and easy. Loved the bean and arugula combination, and ended up doubling the amount of arugula. Next time, I'll substitute olive oil for the 1/2 stick of butter as another reviewer recommended.

Excellent! Made as prescribed. If trout is not available, opt for another semi- flaky fish. The bean mix was great...good enough to make as a side for chops and steaks. Will make again for sure.

I loved this. I wish trout was available more often. I will definitely be making the vinaigrette and beans again, doubling the arugula. I really could have made a meal out of the beans and arugula alone.

This recipe is outstanding. I think you could probably substitute salmon.

This was good...but I made it DELICIOUS by adding 1/2 a square (different countries measure it differently) of feta cheese to the whole bean mixture. I crumbled it in just before adding the aragula...holy cow did it make the flavour pop! Rave reviews all the way round.

Made this last night with talapia. It was fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly (except for the kind of fish) and it will go into my regular rotation. Easy, fresh, and so delish!

This is a great recipe. My husband and I have used it over and over again. Only thing we've changed is that 1/2 stick of butter. Reduced to 3 tbsps olive oil total.

This recipe is super easy and delish! The only change I made was adding some radicchio to the beans with the arugala which I won't do again as my husband felt this was a detractor.

I prepared this recipe last night and will dertainly add it to my go-to meals for the future! It was DELICIOUS!!! For once, I actually followed the recipe to a tee only substituting fresh spinach for arugula. LOVE IT!!!

Excellent recipe. Crisy and tart. I loved the way the vinegrette accented both the beans and the trout. I'd make more vinegrette next time. I probably used more rosemary than it called for. Didn't change anything else.

This is quick and delicious. I used talipia. Would not change a thing.

This was so easy and delicious. I used pan fried tilapia instead of trout and it turned out great. I will definetly make again.

I grilled chicken instead of trout and added roasted cherry tomatoes. Delicious. will definitely make again and have already passed along to a friend.

This was simple and delicious. The lemon zest worked so nicely with the balsamic, rosemary, and capers. The overall result was really satisfying. When I make it again, I'll probably use dry beans instead of canned, however. They got a little mushy and had kind of a canned flavor that didn't rinse out.

This was very good and hearty without a lot of fuss. I added a few grilled tomatoes and asparagus to round out the meal (didn't have arugula handy). Very nice camp or home BBQ recipe.
