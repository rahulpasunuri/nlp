For us, the flavor of the goat cheese overwhelmed everything else. Though it was a pleasant-tasting meal, it was not a good use of expensive morels. It would have tasted just as good with button mushrooms.

I must agree with the last reviewer. I have been making this for years--since it first appeared on the site--and it is simply THE BEST preparation for FRESH morels I have ever eaten. I prepare it as written, no substitutions. Due to the cost of the morels, I do not skimp on any other ingredient. I use a high quality mild French chevre and snip chives from my garden. It is a special, highly anticipated treat that I prepare for my family on the day the morels appear in my local market. There is never a drop left on anyones plate. If you screw around with the recipe--don't complain about the way it turns out.

I know it gets said over and over again on this site but you just can't rate a recipe unless you use the ingredients and method as stated! To say the sauce lacks depth but you substituted white mushrooms for morels..seriously? Try this sauce...use your cooking skills to add flavours you like, and to enhance the tasteif you choose, but at least use the ingredients stated before you rate it less than 4 forks.

This was the perfect dish for the wild morels my husband brought home. It was the first time I had ever had them and so I didn't know what to expect, but the creaminess called for in this recipe, along with the fresh taste of asparagus, complimented the earth flavor of the mushrooms perfectly. It was a delight to cook, sip on some white wine while standing over shallots simmering in butter and more white wine.. We will definitely make this again next year when asparagus and morels are in season.

Based on all the reviews I read ahead of time, the big take away for me: The sauce needed more flavor. So as a proactive measure I modified the recipe a little. *** I used a medly of dried mushrooms in additon to the morels -- using enough mushrooms to produce 1/2 cup of liquid. I added the reserved liquid and [chopped] mushrooms at the same time the cream and goat cheese goes into the pan. ***** I also used fresh tarragon which gave it a really nice, earthy profile. I like the ease and flexibility of this recipe and it could end up being a 'go-to' dish for me.

Read all the reviews and came up with the following: Added only 4 oz of cheese and that was maybe too little. I also added total of 3/4 c broth and went with 1/4 c each of heavy whipping cream and skim milk. Sauce was a little too thin and kept adding more whipping cream but never got thicker. So next time add 5 oz cheese and 3/4 broth. Will be great with regular mushrooms and not get pasty. I will agree with other reviewers - the morel's rich flavor gets lost in the sauce. Tastes awesome but can't taste the morels much.

Although we both liked this dish, my husband and I felt that the sauce lacked depth. This could have been because we used white mushrooms rather than morels(the recipe choice was a last minute decision based on some asparagus purchased at the farmers market). However, I still think the sauce needs something, perhaps a fresh herb? The chives (despite their quantity) did not come through. Also despite what others reported, the sauce was nice and thin; not pasty. Perhaps this is dependent on the consistency of your goat cheese? Finally, I would definitely recommend using fresh pasta. The delicate texture of fresh pasta goes better with a delicate sauce like this. Overall, the recipe has great potential. We will make it again; especially as it is so quick and easy.

As much as I love goat cheese, the taste overpowers the morels - and I even used mild goat cheese. I wanted more taste out of this dish beyond the cheese. It also needed to be more saucy, less thick and pasty. I would suggest adding more liquid if you really want to try it.

I liked it. I substituted three other mushrooms (couldn't fine morels). I also cut the cream and cheese a little and used a bit more broth. Also...I saved some broth to help smooth it out when reheating the next day. Very good. Was not pastey at all, like some of the other reviews claimed.

For those who cant find the morels fresh (or have pesticide worries) try the dried morels, soaked for 20 minutes in 1/2 cup VEGGIE broth & then use the soakng liquid in place of the chicken broth. VERY GOOD! Although i love fresh morels, so. Cali doesnt have them, so this is the next best thing

After reading the reviews I just had to make this for a company dinner. I needed enough mushrooms for 8 people which took me nearly 8 hours to find in area woods, never having looked for these before. At dinner everybody just loved the dish. However, its what happened about 30 min. after that was the problem. I'll just say having 8 people trying to use the bathroom at the same time was very embarrassing. I later found out that in this area we spray for insects which makes the wild morels undigestable by humans. Next time I'll use portabello, that is if anyone will eat it again.

Way too much cheese in this sauce! I like rich sauces, but this was like a paste and the flavor of the morels and asparagus was lost. I'm sure there are better ways to showcase morels in a pasta dish.

I have reduced the fat by reducing one can of non-fat, low sodium chicken broth and thickening with arrowroot to which I added warm skim milk as a substitute for the heavy cream. It was wonderful!

Since fresh morels aren't available right now, I re-constitued dried morels by soaking them in the 1/2 c. of chicken broth. I then strained the broth through a coffee-filter-lined sieve before I added it to the shallot/wine mixture. Using the morel-infused broth really seemed to add more depth to the dish. I'm sure the texture of fresh morels would have been much better than the reconstitued version, but the dish was absolutely incredible in any case. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely fantastic!! Couldn't find morels so used domestic mushrooms and it was still wonderful, but will definitely have to try with the morels.

Wow!! This has got to be the most decadent and sinful dish so far! We made it with fresh morels and I substituted goat milk for the heavy cream. Fabulous! I must serve this for others, and not just hog it for me and my husband. Well, we'll see!

This was WONDERFUL. Yes, yes, yes, you must use morels for their flavor. The sauce turned out more like a paste, and really clung to the noodles (I used a little wider noodle), but it was delicious.

This recipe was great, My husband and I are avid morel hunters and are always looking for recipes to use them. We also have a large asparagus garden so this was great. I substituted blue cheese for the goat cheese and it was awesome. I also doubled the recipe and used it as a main dish. Next time I will add shrimp.

This is an absolutely spectacular recipe!!! A great way to use morels (fresh or dried), but you must use morels for their unique flavor and texture. I do a lot of cooking, have done this several times, and it's one of my favorite recipes!

One of our favorites. Absolutely must use morels to get this right! (It helps to be good mushroom hunters) A little extra goat cheese to thicken the sauce helps.

Wife and son says that this is a keeper. Could not find Morels, had to use button mushrooms. Going to make bigger batch next time as not everyone could have second helpings.
