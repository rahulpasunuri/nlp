WOW! These were good. I had them at a dinner party and people were still talking about them the next day. Delicious! Make sure you present them in a pretty platter or dish because they're not naturally beautiful... but so yummy

I usually add a few sprigs of fresh thyme on top of the tomatoes when roasting. Great in pasta salads!
