My husband and I loved this chowder...very flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly. The only additions I made were the following: I added 2 lbs. of scallops instead of just 1 lb. (my husband loves scallops), 1/2 cup of dry white wine (I used Chalk Hill Chardonnay 2009), 1 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning, and a dash of cayenne pepper (the wine and the last two spices were per suggestions from other reviewers). The parsley oil adds wonderful flavor so don't omit it! I'll definitely make this scallop chowder again...so yummy! I was full after two servings but I would have eaten more if I had a bigger tummy because it was very delicious :)

This is a very good chowder with a couple of modifications. I did add some cayenne pepper as suggested by another reviewer. This provided a little needed zip. I also added about 3/4 cup of sherry after the corn and cooked down 2-3 minutes before adding the potatoes and clam juice. It does take quite a bit of salt and pepper. Served as a snowy night dinner with some freshly baked sourdough bread. All and all a pretty good chowder.

I really should have rated this one and a half forks. As written it is not exactly bland...just ok and not worthy of making again

Hate to be the spoilsport here, but I thought this was bland and way, way too thick. Had to thin it down with chicken broth to make it even resemble a decent soup.

Great, easy recipe. Took the suggestions of other reviewers and used half and half, 1/3 clam juice and 2/3 vegetable broth, and red potatoes with the skin to add some color. Used fresh corn instead of frozen which gave it more texture. Don't forget the cayenne. Not a 'diet" food, but not nearly as heavy as traditional chowder with cream or thickeners.

Among 3 soups tonight at my book club meeting, this one moved fastest. Something was missing as noted by several other reviewers. I didn't have Old Bay, so added a few of it's ingredients - celery seed, cloves, cayenne, smoked paprika. It really did the trick! I made the soup the day before, added the scallops to pot before refrigerating, then heated the next evening, adding the Old Bay spices at that point. Parsley oil is a nice refreshing touch.

This was an excellent recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I did sub a little due to availability of ingredients. First, I cannot find clam juice here, so I used 2 cups seafood broth plus 1 cup white wine. Secondly, I used shrimp instead of scallops. Lastly, I followed the suggestions of adding Old Bay seasonings and cayenne. I did thickened the soup by pureeing (with my mini emulsifier) about 1/4 of the soup before adding the shrimp and bacon at the end. It turned out delish. This is a keeper and oh so easy to make!

Skipped the olive oil completely..added two tablespoons flour..also had cooked scallops in butter..put residue in..added whole milk after putting one half cup of whipping cream in and about a quarter to a half cup of sherry..yummo! If it gets too thick just add some whole milk the next day..had it for breakfast this am..it had thickened since last night..little milk and it was good..definitely a keeper..used fresh corn on the cob..added a carrot and some frozen peas too.

This chowder came out great. Not so heavy with the leeks and clam juice. I added a touch of dry white wine for more depth. Since I didn't have cayenne powder as suggested, I used Mongolian Fire Oil. Came out great.

Delicious. It was great and easy to make. Next time, I'll skip the parsley oil. We didn't think it made that much difference in taste. Fresh cilantro sounds like a great alternative, I'll try that next time.

Sooo good. I took some suggestions and used red skinned potatoes with peels and added a bit of cilantro. Also used dried thyme instead of fresh.

Fantastic recipe. My first chowder, and one of the best I've tasted. The only modification I suggest is to simply add 2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning. We also used house-smoked bacon as well as frozen organic sweet corn and organic cream.

I didn't have all the clam juice - used 1 C clam juice and 2 C vegetable broth instead - and I didn't make the parsley oil. It still was wonderful!

Great chowder! Made as written, but I thickened it by pureeing 1/3 of the soup and put it back in the pot before adding the scallops and bacon. Still plenty chunky, but also thick and rich. I do think it needs a little extra something, as other reviewers have noted. I'll try Old Bay and cayenne next time.

Absolutely delicious. I made it as a first course last Christmas, and I will be making it again this Christmas!

This was great chowder. My husband loved it and his expectations were high. I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, used red potatoes w/ skins on, and I used 8 oz. clam juice + 16 oz. chicken stock. I thought the clam flavor was very subtle, so next time I may try 2:1 w/ the chicken stock. I loved the parsley oil.

Wonderful soup. Not just a first course. Served it on a cool summer night with baby romaine with a splash of olive oil and fresh bread. I used fresh corn and added the suggested shrimp. If you wanted a little lighter soup, could use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Yum!

Amazing. Probably the shortest review I have ever given. So good. My husband and I ate to the point of discomfort. Yum!

This was delicious, but I did make a couple of changes: I added a little flour, because I prefer a thicher broth. Also put in a little smoked paprika, which added a lot to the over all taste. Added about 1/4 lb shrimp, & didn't use the parsley oil. Rave reviews from guests!

I added a chopped red pepper, a jalapeno pepper, and some old bay seasoning as I felt it could use some extra flavour and colour. Next time, I would use only 1 jar clam juice and use chicken broth for the rest of the liquid as I felt it was too clammy tasting and that it overpowered the taste of the scallops.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I reduced the fat content and spiced it up a little - I whisked about 1/3 cup flour, a few splashes of hot sauce, white pepper and sea salt into 1 cup of fat free half and half until smooth, then added the mixture in lieu of the cream. Husband has already requested that I make it again!

Very good basic recipe that could use a little "spicing up" for my taste. Added Old Bay seasoning and lots of cracked pepper and kosher salt. Could also substitute clams or a white fish for scallops. All in all, a good recipe.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy!! My guests loved it! I used half & half to lower the fat and I believe this soup could even be made with milk. I will also experiment with this recipe by using shrimp and maybe adding a jalapeno pepper. I think this is a good staple recipe.

This recipe is delicious and very fast and easy. I used Nova Scotia Dry Scallops which are a little stronger in flavour than Bay or Sea Scallops. Like the Bay Scallop they are sweet. I decided not to return the bacon to the chowder as I didn't want to take away fromt he flavour of the scallops. There was just a hint of smokeyness from having sauteed the leeks and corn in the bacon. The parsley oil is a definite asset - just makea the whole thing very fresh. Delicious!

A wonderful chowder and a lovely first course. I made it in the morning and added the bacon and scallops during the reheat, just prior to serving. Delicious.

Very good! I agree with the others here who have stated that a dash or pinch of hot pepper is needed.

One of THE best chowders I've ever tasted in my life. Easy recipe and the results were spectacular. We used sea scallops and cut them up (the only substitution.) Perfect. Delicious. Serve with really good bread. Definitely don't skip the parsley oil - it's very easy to make - and yummy. Spread it on the bread, too.

This is great comfort food--it will definitely go in my keeper file. I served it with onion-bacon-cheese bread to complete the meal. I made only half the amount of parsley oil called for and still had plenty leftover.

I changed a few things but that didn't affect the integrity of this dish. I served the chowder as a complete meal, having cooked more leeks into it and adding lima beans as well (frozen). Instead of using clam juice as the only liquid source (besides the cream), I incorporated a great deal of water into the 'soup', increasing the quantities of salt and pepper in the process. The lovely parsley oil is a beautiful final touch that should not be omitted.

I made this for a soup party and it was a great hit. I added a few oysters and clams and did the cayenne thing. Don't omit the parsley oil - it adds a lot of flavor!

I took the advice of the other cooks and added cayenne pepper and shrimp. The chowder was very good and easy to make. Even better the next day!

This soup was absolutely wonderful! As with some others, I added in shrimp but I also a added a little cayenne for a kick! I can't wait to make this for my next dinner party.

I didn't make the parsley oil, and the chowder was still full of flavor. Bottled clam juice was expensive though, so I used only 1 bottle. I replaced the rest of the liquid with vegetable stock. In place of whipping cream, I used fat free half and half & a little cornstarch to thicken. Of course, whipping cream would've been richer and if you aren't watching your diet like I am, I'd recommend using it instead.

This was the first chowder I have made. It turned out great. I too used smoked bacon. Next time I am going to omit the parsley oil and just add fresh parsley during cooking.

I wasn't too sure about this, but based on the raves, I went ahead and tried. Damn glad I did! I did use a few shrimp as many reviewers suggested and I think they added something great, especially to the texture. It seemed a bit bland to me, so I used a bit of dried red peppers. And next time I might do a bit more leek. No where on anybody's diet list, but well worth the splurge.

This recipe is so good and very easy. Both times I've made it I've increased the scallops and added some shrimp. I also used more potatoes than it calls for. In an effort to reduce calories, I used a can of whole evaporated milk in place of the cream, and the flavor is still wonderful. I think it's even better the next day. It's definitely worth making again and again!

This soup has become my Christmas Eve soup in the two short years it's been published. So very rich and delicious!!

I am allergic to corn. What can I substitute or should I just use more potatoes?

This is a very tasty soup. I served it as a main course and that worked out great even though the recipe suggested it should be used as a first course. The only thing I would change is use 1/2 teaspoon parsley oil for each bowl of soup instead of 1 teaspoon. Next time I think I'll add fresh oysters, too.

Great recipe. I have made this with scallops and fish and it is good either way. I did not use the parsley oil. Always good reviews and requests for the recipe. Partially freezing the bacon prior to chopping and cooking makes things easier.

This was a super easy recipe. I doubled the bacon because I had it on hand and skipped the parsley oil. My entire family loved it. I also used the large scallops and cut them in thirds.

I thought this was a terrific chowder recipe. I added shrimp and sauteed the scallops with the shrimp in a little of the bacon drippings. To cut the fat a little, I substituted some evaporated milk for some of the whipping cream. The flavor was still terrific. I served with a salad for a yummy luncheon. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is great, especially for a base for any kind of seafood desirable. I used shrimp and catfish pieces instead of scallops and it was delicious, hearty and very filling. I served for a main entree with crusty rolls and butter which left no room for dessert!

I made this chowder yesterday, and it was incredible!! Reminded me of my favorite place, Nantucket. Will definitely make this again! I did add a bit more whipping cream and some chopped parsley.

This is the best! We used a real smoky bacon(as suggested in previous comment-thanks!)and it was wonderful. It was a big hit with my New Year's weekend guests! Should have made a double batch. Nice crusty French bread and a salad made an excellent lunch!

I saw this recipe among the batch of 'newbies' and thought it sounded good. Made it this evening and it really is excellent - creamy, rich, and comforting. My husband thinks it is missing a little something though ("just a little boost is missing") but I think it maybe that I need to use a stronger or smokier bacon. Anyway, this is a sure favorite.

This chowder is fabulous! We made it for dinner last night and couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today. This is a nice chowder base that could be used for other types or combinations of fish and seafood. Hint: halve the parsley oil recipe - the recipe makes far more than needed.

I fixed this dish for a brunch and everyone raved about it. I had a vegetarian in the group, so I substituted butter for the bacon grease and filled her bowl before I added the crumbled bacon. Everyone was happy.
