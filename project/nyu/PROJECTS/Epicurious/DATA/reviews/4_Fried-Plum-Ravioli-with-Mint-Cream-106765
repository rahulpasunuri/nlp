Excellent! just as made. I also tried another rendition (using cream cheese, grapes and almonds) for the filling. Buy fresh wonton wrappers from a good grocer - they make all the difference! As for the unhealthy comment, go to a vegan site if you want tasteless but healthy fare. This is a treat, not an every day meal.

Of all the deserts I've made, this is in the top five. It's as homey as any comfort food, as beautiful as any restaurant could serve and easy. I did make a few adjustments. I make the ravioli as suggested, but I immediately toss them, while hot, into a mixture of sugars and spices. I also serve them with a ginger custard sauce garnished with very thinly sliced mint leaves and dotted the plate with plum sauce. It's so good. Most of the ravioli don't make it past the sugar before the guests arive :) Have fun!

This was absolutely delicious! I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but loved this dessert. In reference to the other comment, this is a dessert - it isn't supposed to be healthy!

Umm, hello? The first word in the name is "fried."
