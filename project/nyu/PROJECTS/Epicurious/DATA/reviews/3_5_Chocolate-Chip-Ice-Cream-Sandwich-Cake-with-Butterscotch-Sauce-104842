I was persuaded not to try to make this in cake form by the other reviewers' comments about how it was too hard to cut. So instead I just used this cookie recipe to make smaller cookies and smaller ice cream sandwiches. This is the PERFECT recipe to make cookies for ice cream sandwiches. It made a flat, sturdy cookie that held up well in the freezer. I took the others' advice and under-baked them a bit. I also used mini chocolate chips so that the cookies would lay flatter. They stayed perfectly moist in the freezer and weren't too sweet next to the ice cream. Will definitely use again the next time I make ice cream sandwiches. I might add a tad more salt next time because I like my chocolate chip cookies a little saltier.

The cookies will fit great if you MAKE them in the springform pan - you won't even have to remove one for the construction. The longer you keep it in the deep freeze the more moisture leaves the cookies and the harder it will be to cut. Also let it thaw for 10 mins before using a sharp knife.

Very good! The sauce was perhaps a bit too sweet for me but my guests all loved it. I've been assigned to bring this for dessert for easter dinner. I did not have problems with cutting it - I did take previous reviewers advice to bake the cookies for 15 mins instead of 18, and used a bread knife to cut it. I did let it sit on the counter for about 10- 15 mins before cutting into it, and that seemed to be enough. I lined the pan with foil so I did not have a mess either. Overall, a keeper!

the cake was good, but I loved the butterscotch the most. It is true, with the cake it is way to sweet, but on plain icecream it is great. It also doesn't taste much like butterscotch, I usually don't like it much. this one is very tasty though.

Butterscotch sauce is way too sweet - must make without it! Or with less sugar. Otherwise, delicious!

Delicious but definitely make it without the butterscotch sauce - it makes the cake way too sweet! And be sure to read the recipe first as you must must freeze for quite some time before you serve.

I made this recipe substituting hot fudge and caramel sauces for the butterscotch sauce. The cake was delicious and easy. The first time I served it, the ice cream was too soft and gushed out the sides, after sitting in my deep freeze overnight, the ice cream was hard enough to slice well. This is such a fun summertime dessert. I can't wait to serve it to kids.

I've never reviewed a recipe before but I figured out an easy way to do this so I thought I would write in. I used 2 8-inch cake pans (the only size I have) and once the cookies were cooled I took them out and lined one of the pans with parchment paper. I filled the lined pan with ice cream and froze this separately. When I was ready to make the cake, I warmed up the cookies for 20 seconds so they were nice and soft and lined them with hot fudge (I don't like butterscotch) then just plopped the hardened ice cream out on the bottom cookie and placed the other cookie on top. The cookies were soft and easy to cut but ice cream stayed hard. It was delicious!!

Actually, I'd probably give it 3-1/2 forks as it was really delicious! Everyone raved about how good it was! But I agree with many of the reviewers that it was very tough to cut and serve. Ice cream oozed out everywhere! I did underbake the cookie. Next time will pre-cut the top cookie layer and maybe, after taking it out of the freezer for a few minutes, slice through the cake while still in the springform pan. And maybe even use one of those ready made cookie doughs. . .

This cake was a cinch to make and put together, and bit harder to serve and eat. I read all the previous reviews and took some advice (undercooked the cookie, precut the top layer) but it was still pretty tough to handle. Next time I'll try again to make the cookies chewier and more cuttable. It was delicious, though, any way you cut it.

I hate cakes at parties. Every party i have i try to come up with an alternative to wow my guests. I've made cupcakes in ice cream cones, cereal squares made out of frosted flakes, captin crunch and anything i could think of that was not rice crispies. This recipe, if you'll forgive the pun, takes the cake! Make sure the sides of your cake pan are not tappered. You want the bottom of the cake pan to be the same size as the bottom of the spring-form. I lowered the temperature a bit on the cookies so they were chewy. i froze the cookies so i could press the ice-cream without fear of breaking the cookies. i lined the spring-form with plastic wrap to make it easy to unmold. my guests loved it. i'd comment on how it tasted but it was so popular i never got a piece!

This was really yummy and incredibly rich--made it for boyfriend's birthday and took it out of town packed on dry ice. As in previous reviews, the cookies were smaller than the springform pan. I solved this by using the crushed chocolate cookie crust from the Coffee Almond Ice Cream Cake, packing it around the edges of the bottom cookie once it was in the springform pan. Next time I will bring it all the way up so that it's surrounding the ice cream and top cookie also. This worked really well and wasn't difficult. I'd recommend freezing the top cookie layer before putting it on, mine oozed down into the ice cream. Also, I made this on a Wed. night & served it on Sat. night--4 days later and still delicious. I only baked the cookies for 15 min. so they were pretty easy to cut. It was a hit!

This cake got rave reviews. No one believed I made it. It was a little hard to serve, but was well worth it. I also use the "giant cookie" recipe for my "regular" size cookies. A+

The perfect 4th of July dessert! Everyone loved this, but it was messy to serve. My cookies were baked in a convection oven so they were soft enough to cut easily unlike some earlier reviews. However there are definitely things I WILL do differently next time--I will start 2-3 days prior to serving, I will freeze springform pan and cookies before assembling dessert with ice cream, so it will not ooze for hours in freezer, and I will allow at least 12 hours to freeze assembled dessert before serving. It is delcious, and with appropriate steps in advance, could be pretty to serve as well!

I would have almost gave this three forks- it was super rich and sweet and that was what I liked about it- however you really need to freeze this for a minimum of 5 hours- I tried to do it in three and the ice cream was still melted everywhere. I also agree with undercooking the cookie slightly, my guests could barely cut into it with a fork.

I will make this again, but it does have some drawbacks (but it is so good I want to find a way around them!) I agree with the reviews that say the cookies are too hard. I will try under cooking them a little... Also as someone else mentioned, my 9" cake pans ar smaller than my 9" spring form so when I assembled the whole thing the ice cream spilled over the sides of the bottom cookie and made a big mess! I rectified it ok, but it didn't look like the picture in the magazine, altright!

I have made this twice now and both times it was delicious. A suggestion for making it even simplier to prepare, buy already prepared dough for the cookies ( 1 lb. package per 9 in. cookie for a nice thick cookie). I used Ghiradelli mix from Sam's club the 2nd time and it was wonderful. Undercook the cookies and you won't be sorry when it comes time to eat this dessert, but make sure you line your pans with the parchment for easy removal. The butterscotch sauce was excellent and both times I used Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream (1/2 gallon). So what that it is a little messy and difficult to cut. Let it thaw for ten or so minutes and enjoy. What is not likeable about chocolate chip cookies and ice cream?

MMM...I made this for my daughters birthday party, the kids loved it & ate up every morsel. I made it and served it on the same day (I made sure it was thouroughly frozen before trying to cut it). The cookie was great and it cut easily. Not to mention it was WAY easy to make. I'm going to try it today with white chocolate chips and rasberry ice cream!

I made this for 2 family picnics. They were both large parties. I made both chocolate and vanilla. I received raved reviews. Everybody thought that they tasted like they were from a fancy restaurant. Very easy and can make well ahead. A little tricky to cut. Allow to sit out for 5 minutes before trying.

My advice: save yourself the time and effort. Make some really wonderful chocolate chip cookies, then serve up with some first-rate ice cream. Sauce optional. Recipe just not worth it.

Delicious but what a mess! I planned on avoiding the frozen cookie cutting problem by assembling the cake at the last minute with the pre-formed ice cream. No luck. Since my pre cooked cookies shrunk while baking, my ice cream mold would have been a half an inch bigger than my cookies. I went a head and put the cookie together as instructed. Since I basically couldn't control the slicing of the cake (it broke off where ever it wasn't rock solid frozen) much of the cake ended up melting on plates and was thrown away. I must have cleaned up melted ice cream for half an hour.

I agree with the cutting dilema. However, I used an electric knife and it sliced through the cookie much better than when I tried to cut it with a regular knife. It was DELICIOUS!

I used cinnamon ice cream, which was really good with it. I too had a very hard time cutting it, but will take the suggestions made next time.

Too hard to cut?!! Get a large BREAD knife, have a few glasses of wine with your dinner, pull it out of the freezer a few minutes early and just cut it! It's really not so tough! The butterscotch sauce really does thicken up in the refrigerator, so don't panic that it's too thin while it's still warm.

Try cutting the cookie before assembling, b/c it will be impossible when it's frozen! The other suggestion about assembling it last minute sounds good too. It did taste very good, maybe a little too rich though. the sauce was great, easy to make and tasted good on plain ice cream.

In response to the comments that the cookie was too hard when the ice cream was ready for serving, I came up with a solution that worked beautifully. Make the cookies ahead and freeze them. Line the springform pan with plastic wrap and fill with the softened ice cream. Thaw the cookie the night before and then assemble last minute.

To all those who thought the cookies was too hard... this dessert tastes best after sitting in the freezer for two days. The cookies get slightly soft with ice cream and butterscotch sauce.... YUM YUM YUM

Again, the cookie WAS too hard. But the butterscotch sauce was wonderful! I made this with chocolate ice cream, but I think next time I will try it with coffee. And I will try to make the cookies softer too.

There are several reasons for giving this recipe only 2 forks. While it was very good and we all liked it, the cookie was much too hard (though delicious).

I loved the concept, however, the cookie was too hard when the ice cream was soft enough to serve. If there were a way to keep the cookie soft for serving, it would be a wonderful recipe. The butterscotch sauce was great and I would make it to serve with other desserts.

This was very tasty (how could it not be?) but mine turned out very sloppy. My 9" cake pans were a slight bit smaller than my 9" sprinform pan and so the butterscotch and ice cream leaked under and made it look very messy.

I too had trouble with the cookie being too hard, so the next time I made it, I placed the cake pans on an Airbake cookie sheet. I baked the cookie an additional 4 minutes, but it came out much softer.

Easy and fun. Made with my niece who was visiting for the weekend. Cookie was a little hard which made it difficult to eat with a fork.
