I made this recipe today with a whole egg (whoops) and Avocado oil. It was really good! I added a splash more lemon juice but otherwise it was pretty great for my first homemade mayo!

Delicious and easy! I used half olive oil, half canola oil, and I used the wire whisk attachment on my stick blender. The whole process took about 10 minutes. I also used only a pinch of salt, but it is still delicious.

Used olive oil with hand whisk- it was so bitter, I threw out the whole batch and started over with canola - still with hand whisk. My arm is about to fall off after doing this twice, but well worth the switch to canola. p.s. The bigger the whisk, the faster it whips!

I was in the middle of making potato salad when I realized I had no mayonnaise. I had always wanted to make homemade mayonnaise so this was my chance. I followed the recipe and directions exactly as written and it came out excellent! Will never use store bought mayo again.

very yummy! love that you can add whatever oil you prefer b/c canola is just not that healthy! took me a bit longer than 8 minutes to whisk in my kitchen aid :)

I made this for my fiance when we ran out of mayo to make sandwiches. I really thought making homemade mayo would be really difficult or that it would turn out weird but this stuff was awesome!! With just a couple household ingredients you can make amazing mayo that tastes WAY better than the store bought stuff. It was actually kind of fun to make too, my arm got kinda tired from whisking but it was well worth it. We will now always make our own mayo, no going back to the old stuff after you've had the real thing! Thanks!

Got a bug this week to try homemade mayonnaise. Made the recipe exactly as written but doubled it. Next time I'll try variations. Very tasty. Better then any mayo I've bought in the store. Took a little longer tan 12 minutes for me to mix in all the oil.

I just made this using my food processor - wonderful! I added a bit more lemon.

Perfect Mayo. Nothing else to say.

So, I'm not normally a mayonnaise fan. I never keep it on hand at the house, never ask for it on sandwiches, etc. etc. But homemade mayonnaise? That is a whole different ballgame my friends. This stuff is SOO good! Like eat it plain with a spoon good. (Ok ok I don't actually do that, but the point is people, I've thought about it. That's how good this stuff is.) Followed the recipe to a T, and I hand whisked it, just for kicks. Yes, you do sort of need muscles to hand whisk it, but I figure one needs a bit of a work out if one is planning on consuming this divine but fatty concoction! Yum! :)

This is rewarding and fabulous! I love it. I think I would reduce the salt even further (did so originally after reading the other reviews), but that's it. I whisked by hand, given the comment about heat, and I'm glad I did - I think the physical effort makes it taste better.

Homemade mayo makes such a difference, soo delicious! I used mine to make chicken salad sandwiches, which were fabulous. I even whisked it myself. Don't be scared, try this out!!

It was excellent. I used a hand mixer w/ a whisk attachment, and it worked very well! I will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy recipe - just as I was taught when I lived in France. @Nadine from Brussels, 'American idea of pasteurized eggs'? That's funny :-) Indeed, what do pasteurized eggs look like? Boiled perhaps??? Instead of an “American idea’, it may simply be a Belgian perception ;) LOL

I made this exactly according to the recipe, so that I could decide how I wanted to tweek it next time. I thought it was very good as is, but would probably decrease the salt and increase the mustard for next time. Also, since I am lazy, I used the whisk attachment and my stick blender to mix this up. No metallic taste and easy peasy.

This is my first time making homemade mayonnaise and this recipe is wonderful! It takes some time and elbow grease but it's well worth it. Next time I will leave out a bit of the salt and lemon juice just for personal taste, but this is recipe I will be using again and again. Thanks!

This is a terrific mayonnaise recipe! Very easy, and not hard to make at all. Highly recommended! @Dallas: Olive oil can make the mayo bitter if it gets hot, and that may be the case when using a blender/processor. Beating by hand just doesn't get the wires hot. @Princeton: Mustard is an integral flavoring part of real mayonnaise, and you can hardly talk about a mixture of both when there is less than a teaspoon mustard vs. 3/4 C oil! I've read that it is possible to use cooked egg yolk for mayo, but I've never tried it - why bother?

I substituted 1/2 C olive oil for the canola. You can still taste the olive oil flavor, but I avoid canola oil and don't mind the olive oil flavor. I would cut down on the vinegar by about 1/2 t next time-just my personal preference. The effort was definitely worth it. I usually make mayo in the food processor, but it tends to have a bitter taste, especially when using more olive than canola. I read something in another cooking mag. that said the speed of the metal blades changed the oil. I will definitely be making by hand from now on! My husband whisked while I poured the oil and it was a big help.

This mayo is great! 2 thumbs up from my "Best Foods Only" kids and husband. This one is definitely a keeper in my book.

Why use mustard to make mayo? This is almost a hybrid of mustard and mayo. You can cook the egg with the vinegar, wine (or water), and salt until it starts to bubble. Then it will be hot and you can mix it in a blender and pour it out as soon as you are done. It wil solidify in the fridge.

My arms are extraordinarily tired, but the results were well worth the effort! I will most certainly make this again, delicious!

I've made this by electric mixer and whisked by hand. It is so much better when done by hand! It is amazingly easier by mixer, but you get so much more control by hand. It is ALWAYS in my fridge now.

In Belgium we make this mayonaise with a soup mixer the recipient provided with this mixer. We always had home made mayonaise growing up, made with raw eggs of course! I don't get the American idea of using pasteurized eggs (what does that look like???). We use raw eggs in chocolate mousse, for babies we mix a raw egg yolk in mashed potatoes. And so on. I'm super healthy, my kids are very healthy. Living in a sterile world is not good for your immune system...

Excellent. But if I didn't have a stand mixer, it would be a lot of work...

I made mine with fresh eggs from our pasture-fed Speckled Sussex chickens and it is just yummy!

Making this requires very strong willpower and arm muscles! I put it on potatoes to make a homemade potato salad, and my family really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend making this!
