Have made this three times and comes out beautifully. My all time favorite chocolate cake recipe!

This is by far one of the best cakes that I've ever made. If anyone ever needs proof why homemade cakes ever beat box mixes, this would be the one to refer to. Even as separate components, the recipe for the chocolate cake and the mint cream alone can be used well interchangeably. The cake batter even dealt well even being converted to cupcakes, baking them at 375 for 15 minutes or so. Excellent, would definetely keep this on hand.

I made this cake for Christmas, 2007, and I loved it. The rest of the family weren't so keen. One problem I had was that I put Ghiradelli chocolate mints on top of the cake when it first came out of the oven, and they melted and cooled as I expected, but when I tried to slice the cake, the hardened mints were too tough for the cake and it collapsed under the pressure. I loaded the cake and frosting into a large tupperware container and called it trifle. It was funny with family, but if that had happened with company, I would have been pretty embarassed. SO BEWARE!

This cake is delicious and tender, however, when I put After Eight Dinner Mints on top of the warm cake and refrigerated it overnight before frosting it, the melted mints hardened to the point that I couldn't slice the frosted cake. It fell apart under the pressure needed to cut through the mints. Luckily, it was a family dinner and I called the leftovers "trifle". So skip the After Eights! I also think the frosting needs some gelatin in it to stabilize it. Otherwise, it just squishes out when you cut it.

I loved this recipe! The texture of the cake was moist and delecate. I used special dark cocoa powder instead of the regular, and I also mixed some andes mints to the batter. It was delicious! I would most likely make this recipe again.

My new daughter-in-law cut her baking teeth on this cake recipe. It was absolutely delicious. We used cake flour and cocoa from Penzy's. To add some extra mint flavor to the cake, we added about 1/4 cup of chopped Andes mints to the batter and placed Andes mints over the top of each layer about 10 mins after they came out of the oven. Everyone raved about the cake. It was a special treat for my daughter's 30th birthday.

This is a fine recipe, provided you use a good brand of cocoa, such as Pernigotti, Droste, or Valrhona. If you use Hershey's - get the "Special Dark" or European variety. I prefer chocolate cake recipes that use boiling water with the cocoa - it brings out the flavor of the chocolate. If you choose to employ this method, reduce the buttermilk to 1/2 cup. Also, add 2 teaspoons pure peppermint extract to the cake batter. A fun - and easy - filling is to sprinkle "Junior Mints" onto the warm cake layers. They melt quickly, giving a wonderful chocolate-mint flavor. This cake can also be frosted with chocolate mint buttercream, which will remind you of the Girl Scouts' "Thin Mint" cookies. Decorate with crushed peppermint candies sprinkled around the perimeter of the cake.

Very light and fluffy cake! I used a little extra mint and melted Andy's over the top. Yumm!!!!!

I made this for an employee meeting....................it went over fantasticly. I did beat the butter/sugar for 5 minutes on high til extremely creamy. After all the ingredients were added I made sure to beat the batter for another 5 minutes on medium, to make it very light and creamy. Baked for 20 minutes. While the cake cooled I melted 20 Andes mints over low heat, and on top of the bottom two layers I poured 1/3rd of the chocolate and spread. Then did the mint whipped cream on each layer, on top of the melted chocolate (I added 6 TBL Peppermint Schnapps instead of the extract). After covering the top and sides with cream, I dripped the rest of the melted chocolate down the sides of the cake, did the same for the top. Looked great!

Chocolate cake had good flavor but was a little dry. Would cook less next time. We added chopped thin chocolate mints in between the layers with the whipped cream for a nice surprise.

Over the course of many years and many chocolate cakes, I remembered this cake as being light, deeply chocolatey and moist. I made it this weekend in a 9x13 pan with a simple glaze (Valrhona bittersweet, half-and-half and vanilla) and it was as good as I'd remembered it. This cake is just so good.

This is a great chocolate cake. Be sure to use good cocoa. This cake always comes out moist and chocolatey for me and I use this recipe with mocha buttercream as well. Delicious!

I added Junior Mints- with fabulous results! I was very pleased with this cake- I read the complaints about low moisture content...the trick is to cream the butter and sugar together until they nearly double in size (this might mean almost 10 minutes of beating, but well worth it!) My sister is a pro pastry chef so I have a discriminating palate and can say with the utmost confidence that if you are meticulous in creaming thoroughly, and only folding the wet+dry together until the flour just barely streaks, this cake will turn out as perfectly for you as it did for me!

When I see a chocolate cake recipe that generally gets rave reviews - and one reviewer says it was "tasteless", I can only conclude the chocolate and/or cocoa used was inferior and perhaps very old. Has that box of cocoa been sitting in your pantry for seven years? You can't make a five star cake with inferior ingredients. Also, try using an aluminum-free baking powder, such as Rumford.

Really moist and light- easy to make and not too sweet

This cake was VERY dissapointing to me! I was going to make this cake at my son's wedding party. When i saw all these reviews, I went ahead and made it, only to taste it and want to spit it out. It was flavorless! I am very dissapointed with this cake and I feel as if I let my son and his wife down!

Fabulous recipe - the chocolate cake itself is very good and moist and has a very nice flavour. In the mint whipped cream, I used a lot less sugar (about half) and would consider using mint liquer next time instead of just peppermint extract.

Yum! Cake was very moist. (Baked it for less than 20 min.) Used peppermint schnapps in whipped cream (about 4 1/2 tsp.) Delicious and easy!

Great cake for anyone who loves a mint-chocolate combo! Very chocolatey, and the mint icing gives it a great flavor without being too sweet. I've made it a couple times now and everyone seems to love it! I would definitely recommend it for any occasion.

While this cake was a big hit for an adult birthday party, I thought the cake was a little on the dry side, even though I heeded the advice of previous reviewers and ended up baking it 20 minutes instead of the 25. I don't think it was too much baking because the cake seemed very moist when I was handling it. If it had not been for the whipped cream, I do not think it would have been palatable. I will try the whipped cream again, but use the Chocolate Mint Layer Cake that is also on this website. It got much higher reviews for moistness.

A good cake, but I did find the cake layers a little dry. Perhaps I overcooked them. Cake is pretty and the whipped cream frosting kept it moist. Not too sweet!

I've made this cake for Mother's Day and everyone raved about how moist and delicious it was! Very simple to make, even with the chocolate curls. The fresh whipped cream really enhances the flavor. I would recommend this recipe for anyone who wants to really impress their guests without any of the hassle.

I love chocolate cake ... and this must be my favorite recipe!!! Make sure to check it early ... mine was done baking after 25 minutes at 350. I highly recommend trying different frostings ... especially a chocolate raspberry. Everyone at a friend's party were head over heals for it ... a definite crowd pleaser and really easy!

This cake is amazing! I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Everyone loved it, and it is so easy to make the day before (except the cream of course).

I make this cake on a regular basis and it is my standard recipe for chocolate cake. It's tender, moist, and has great flavor. I rarely use the mint whipped cream. I've frosted it, layered it with mocha pastry cream, served it with vanilla bean whipped cream, dusted with powdered sugar, and garnished with berries. The cake itself is excellent and easily adaptable.

I made this cake for my own birthday last week, and I must say I couldn't have been happier. I like chocolate, but not too much. The mint whipped cream balanced with the chocolate cake beautifully and the mint made it taste so fresh and light. This was a winner!!

I loved the cake, but few of my guests did. It was moist and the mint tasted just right. It looked nice as well. I was a bit disappointed! I will make it again for a different group of people who will appreciate the delicious mint-chocolate combination.

I make this cake all the time. I get rave reviews from everyone that eats it! I think it's a very easy recipe for a very simple, showy cake, and the whipped cream is a perfect balance with the cake. Often I garnish with fresh berries and I usually cover the top with small chocolate curls.

the recipe for the cake turned out very poorly. It didn't bake right and separated out. I had to throw it out. The mint whipped cream was good but there was too much.

I loved this cake!!! I added a mint infused simple syrup to soak the cake with and it really picked up the mint flavor!!

nice chocolate cake, but the chocolate curls and the whipped cream was a lot of work for average, not spectacular, results. I think that if I was to make it a second time, I would use the same cake recipe, but perhaps adding mint extract in there and trading the whipped cream for a light ganache. Also I think topping with a few decorative raspberries would be a nice touch.

I served this cake at a dinner party for both children and adults. It was a great success. I don't think I would have thought to make a cake like that for an adult only dinner party, but kids love cake and that is why I choose it. I was worried about using the 1 tsp of peppermint extract because some of the reviews said it was so strong flavoured, but none of us thought that, it was just perfect!

This cake was very easy, and, at a party of 15 critics, got rave reviews. The cake layers are very moist and chocolatey and would be good even without the mint whipped cream -- which was such a great contrast.

Cake was a very big hit. 6 hours is definitely the limit for keeping the cake--it worked well to make the cake the night before, and frost a few hours before serving. Will probably use a little less mint extract next time.

I absolutely loved this cake. It was very easy to make and was very light and moist. The mint icing was exceptional as well. One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever tried...
