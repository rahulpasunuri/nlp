This was really good and really easy. We had it with just a small bit of vanilla ice cream. Bought some cinnamon ice cream to go with it but left it at home (made at someone else's house). Making this again tonight!

The apples should be peeled because they do not present well when left on. The sauce was OK but did not give the apples any really flavor. Sorry to say, this was not one of my favorites.

Fantastic. Very simple and tastey. The creme fraiche was a very nice touch. Would highly recommend.

this was a tasty and easy recipe to make as compared to the usual baked apples. For the crème fraîche I used mascarpone sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar on each apple.
