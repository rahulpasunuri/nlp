I made this for a Saturday brunch and it turned out quite well. I did not have chard on hand, so I used spinach. Also, I used roasted red peppers from a jar. If I was to use chard, I think I would get the red kind and use the stems for the bottom layer. As in, why not?? I also used only 10 eggs as I did not have a loaf pan as large as the recipe specified and I was serving 5 so I did not need such a large amount. The hot water bath is a great idea. I would suggest boiling some water in a teakettle to have on hand though as the water level drops quite a bit by the end of the baking. One of the guests, who is a bit of a picky eater, liked it very much.

I gave this 4 forks because it has such a great presentation and has great flavor. I did one thing wrong, I missed the part about the hot water bath. The bottome layer did not come out in tact and my guess is the hot water bath. I can't wait to serve this to guest. Doing the prep the day/night before and baking in the morning is a snap.

Fantastic! This is a dish that is easy to prepare ahead of time, and cook it in the morning. A nice presentation and delicious to boot! In order to save time I purchased roasted red peppers, and used frozen spinach in place of chard. Accidentally used sour cream (lite-it was in the fridge) in place of the cream. This is one of the few mistakes I've made in the kitchen that actually worked out! Served this with fresh garden tomatoes, bagette, bacon, fruit, and pastries this morning for brunch.

I made this dish for a brunch. I was serving for 18 people, so I made three: I had to substitute spinach for the chard, and for two of them, I replaced the first layer with crumbled sausage instead of red peppers to make a meat-version of the dish. To save some time, I decided to forgo roasting my peppers, and just diced them very small and sauteed them. Everything turned out beautifully. I prepared each layer the night before and poured them into plastic baggies. The next morning, I put all three loaf pans on a high-sided baking tray for the water bath and assembly was so easy. Rave review from guests.

I thought this was good but the top layer(which becomes the bottom layer) is too 'eggy'. I agree that it looks pretty and is very good the next day at room temp. It isn't very pretty on the top (where the peppers and eggs are) so nect time I will put 'something' on top and present it sliced!

This dish was lovely and I also made the egg mixture a day ahead. I had 3 yolks leftover from a cake, so I added an extra one to each mixture. After baking the first two layers, I lowered the oven temperature to 400. I think 450 was a little high. A great thing about this recipe is that I removed it from the oven, but we didn't eat right away, the Bloody Marys were still flowing. It was delicious served slightly warm.

I decided to try this recipe because, even though I don't like eggs (it's a textural thing), I thought the veggies would give my mouth something to focus on other than the eggs. And I was right. I used bottled roasted red peppers (sauteed as per the recipe) and one fewer eggs than called for in the top layer (I only had a dozen eggs and didn't feel like running to the store) and it turned out just terrific. It's even tasty eaten the next day at room temperature (I'm having it for lunch as I type this). And I have to say, it's probably the prettiest omelet I've ever seen. A winner.

Very good. Presents better sliced than when in "loaf" shape. Pepper layer is nice sweet contrast to savory chard and cheese layers. I might cut back on salt next time. Each layer in the rectangle loaf pan took 13-14 minutes to setup, not 20 minutes, so watch it. If you have a food processor, use it. I made all the egg mixtures the day before (as recipe suggested), so when it cam time to bake, it was a cinch.
