I thought this was great, especially after incorporating a few of the reviewers' comments. Cumin & cayenne in the chili, most especially, but that's up to everyone's taste. My more important comment is about the topping. Those who didn't like it seemed to be concerned that it wasn't cornbread. Yeah, it's not, it's mush. If you think of it as polenta, you won't be disappointed. I also added grated cheese w/ the egg before spreading on top of the chili and baking it. That was great; next time I might try a jalapeno monterey instead of plain cheddar.

Ok recipe and good idea but would only save it for a "in a pinch and you have little ingredients" recipe. For those confused reviewers, chili bean = pink bean Notes: These are very similar to pinto beans, only they're smaller and rounder. They're often used to make chili and refried beans. Substitutes: pinto bean OR rattlesnake bean OR red kidney bean. Remember, just type whatever you are confused about into a websearch and most likely they will have a website with the answer.

MA - the vegetable is spelled chile, not chili. You're confused.

what's a "chili bean"? I've used red kidney beans and pinto beans and (in vegie chili) black beans and even chick peas. Chili is a pepper, not a bean!

Even with lots of xtra cooking time, and going up 1/4cup on the cornmeal and down 1/4cup on the liquid, the topping was runny. Next time I'll make the cornbread along side as usual

Okay I'm a bad reviewer, because I actually used a different chili for this dish, the Texas-style chili elsewhere on this site. I thought it was pretty darn good but my ex-Texan (is there such a thing?) BF LOVED it. It took more like an hour for the cornbread stuff to cook, though, not 40 minutes.

I spiced-up the chili (cumin, cayenne), and doubled the mush recipe, adding more sugar and spicing it up a bit as well. Excellent single-pan dinner.

Easy, delicious comfort food.

The chili part is ok. I used less meat (actually ground turkey) and twice as many beans, but the cornmeal mush topping is not good. My family gave it thumbs down. If I made it again I would just make cornbread separately.

Mixed reviews from my clan...one didn't like the cornmeal crust but the other loved it. I thought the chili itself lacked flavor (I normally add a few more spices to mine) but since everyone else gave such raves, I figured I'd follow it to the letter. Next time I'll probably make the crust separately and serve it on the side with the chili.

Made this for my Fri. night Scrabble group! A big hit!!! Added 5 strips of bacon diced and crisped, 1, 6 oz. can of tomato paste w/ 1 can H2O, and cranked it up in the spice department with more chili powder and RedHot! I also took the cue on the cornmeal mush and increased the cornmeal by 1/4c. and decreased the liquid by 1/4c. Not soggy at all! I might add kidney beans and decrease the meat next time. Corona w/lime is a perfect light beer w/ this dish!

What a wonderful comfort food! I reduced the ground beef to 1 lb and added a second can of chili beans. Other than that, I kept to the recipes. Garnished with sour cream and chopped green onions. Next time I'm going to try the Cornmeal Mush atop a vegetarian black bean chili.

I make a similar recipe, but throw in a little cumin, hot pepper flakes, and dry mustard. As for the cormeal mush, I add one cup of grated cheddar cheese, buttermilk, an egg, a little sugar, and a little oil. I made this recipe, and prefer my original one. Experiment with these ingrediants if you felt this recipe lacked something.

Everyone liked. Even the kiddos. The cornmeal mush topping was delicious. I sprinkled a little grated cheddar on top for garnish. Good flavor prepared as directed. EASY too!

This was pretty good. I found that the crust didn't cook enough to my liking, but I shortened the cooking time. I also took the corn out of the mush, substituting water for the juice in the can. It seemed a tad bit bland, but everyone else thought it was wonderful. Maybe adding some cumin, I also left out the green peppers. It isn't an extremely fast but very hearty.

Everyone in the family loved it - a keeper! I added 1/4 t. cayenne and threw some grated cheese on top to make it crispy. The kids want it again soon!

I rated this a 3 based on potential. We did NOT like the Cornmeal Mush (way too mushy) but the chili was good and the concept was good. I'm going to experiment with the topping and expect much better results next time!

It's a keeper! It's a good, hearty dish that's easy to prepare. I added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes and several splashes of Red Hot sauce to spice it up a bit. I also transfered it to a baking dish and then finished by broiling to make the cornmeal crunchy.

Delicious and easy!

I really enjoyed this recipe, I made two substitutions because it was what I had on hand: 1. one can of Ranch Style beans, and 2. garlic powder. My husband enjoyed it also. The pie does well in a baking dish instead of a skillet.

excellent dish,this time it passed my hubby's scrutiny with flying colors. This is the second recipe I have tried in two days, I may be losing my reputation of being not cook worthy:-) thank you again for the delicious meal.
