Great recipe, love the simplicity. Instead of chicken stock used beef, I liked it better

This is a very good recipe. One of my most favorite foods is a big bowl of noodles with lots of cheese and butter. A guilty, "bad-day" pleasure that I only allow myself once or twice a year. This recipe is a tasty, very close approximation of my favorite dish. I use only half of the listed butter and sprinkle a few teaspoons of parmasean cheese on top. Yummy (and without the guilt).

These noodles are absolutely amazing, there simplicity was perfect, however I guess I can see how some might say that it was too "simple" and needs something else. What can I say, I am not an expert so I thought these noodles needed nothing else and would be delicious on there own or with another main dish!

Simplicity tends to just make me suspicious: "What's it *missing*??" This seemed to be missing a generous sprinkling of paprika. I made this sauce for some healthfood store-bought spinach/feta ravioli, which was a good match. Still, I found myself laying in bed that night thinking: "Next time I'll add toasted walnuts & a squeeze of lemon juice."

I should add that this recipe rates 4 forks for a low-fat and 3 for a not-low fat. For low-fat, it is really, really great!!

Really great alternative to the butter soaked noodles that I typically make. Will use this as my regular noodle recipe from now on.

Use salted low-fat butter and green onions since that was all I had. Still turned out great.

I love noodles, but my husband thinks they are just soggy bread. I served this as an alternative to rice or couscous with some grilled fish. He actually had second helpings and said mmmm...these are really good.

I find this to be a delicious and simple dish. I recommend that you eat it immediately after tossing with the remaining ingredients as it tends to absorb the stock and butter and become dry rather quickly. I reheat these with a touch of extra butter - just to make them buttered noodles once again. This dish is a reminder that some of the best dishes are simple and rely on the quality of the ingredients.

Simple...I reduced the "sauce" a bit... yum!

This simple dish is the perfect foil for a really savory beef or chicken dish. It is inexpensive and always in the cupboard ready to go. Best of all it requires no effort and if you're in the habit of keeping a pot of boiling water on the stove, it takes no time either. To punch up the flavor some I substitute lowly chicken bouillon and cooking water and toss in some freshly grated parmagiano. Tastes wholesome, honest and albeit a simple dish it is worthy of the rest of the good food you cook -- not like those hideous packaged noodle jobs. Depending on what you keep around the house you could try lemon zest, other herbs, capers, oil cured olives, etc. -- A terrific way to use up that last little bit of something tasty hanging around your kitchen.

My whole family liked the reciepe. I thought that the green onions would overpower the taste of everything else, but turned out to have the right combination.

These noodles make a wonderful addition to a more complex main dish. To the cook in Irvine, I live in Lake Forest and buy the no-yolk noodles at my near by Albertson's store. They are available in the area with other dried noodles and are a great addition to a low fat diet.

What amazed me me most about this recipe was the bitter exchange it created amongst reviewers! Wow, I didn't realize that reviewers rate not only the dish but one another's comments as well! Can't we all just (eat and) get along? Lol...

I tried this recipe this evening because it appeared to be quick and easy and had received good reviews. It did turn out to be very quick and easy to prepare, and I will make it again on nights when I don't want to spend much time making dinner. But I have to say, it was pretty bland. I ended up sprinkling on a lot of salt as I was eating it. I think adding more salt to the mixture, and topping with shaved parmesan (as suggested by a previous reviewer) will make this a lot more flavorful. Also would be great as a side dish with chicken. The chives make the finished product attractive.

Simple and good, which this working mom of three certainly appreciates on busy weeknights!

This was a suprisingly tasty dish, given how simple it is. The chives really give it an interesting taste. And its simplicity and quickness make this a side dish that I will come back to again and again.

After reading all the other reviews... out of a curious nature I guess .... I have to say, this was quite tasty. Although I didn't use the broth, just chives and butter for the noodles. And we cook many fancy, long-ingredient dishes here, but this was nice and a simple accompianment as many have stated. It made me remember how good chives can be when added just for a touch. I'll utilize my chive plant more often now.

Made this recipe on the weekend at the cottage as a side dish to grilled chicken and greek salad. My guests loved this recipe! I topped the dish with shavings of parmesan cheese (used a vegetable peeler to get the long shavings). Simple, comforting and delicious! Just the thing after a day "playing in the snow"!

Two words: Yum, and YUM! This is so easy and fast and is a perfect, low-fat, comfort food. I've served it in several different occasions and everyone has loved these noodles... A great accompaniment without distracting from the main dish!

I give this four forks. It is easy, delicious, and filling -- the original comfort food! I make it with Grandma's frozen noodles for that homemade taste and quick preparation. Kudos!

I liked it. It was simple, and I'll refer to it as one of my "comfort foods." I know I'll be making it for lunches on those days I'm feling out of sorts.

To New Orleans: I love this site. My point is that ALL recipes in those publications make this website (not by some Epicurious.com staffer's conscious decision), which makes this site particularly valuable as a resource. So I can't understand why some people are offended by the appearance of these "no-brainers." It's almost like they feel they need to distance themselves from simple recipes--as if they felt they needed to prove something to the readers of their negative posts. Self-esteem issues?

So simple, yet so delicious.

Rating: 0
To Manhatten: I don't think anyone believes they are "scoring points" here. Comments definitely are sometimes OUT THERE (attacks) with some recipes, but mostly not. The rationale of the ratings is that many of us who are considering making recipes appreciate a reliable quick check re: how many would make it again; we appreciate comments pertinent to the recipe as written, and also improvements. If cooks change the recipe significantly, those comments are welcome, but please don't rate the recipe and therefore skew the % for those of us who value that stat as a basic resource. It is as simple as that. Most of us appreciate this link. The ugly comments should just be ignored.

Like the previous reviewer, I made this to go with the piccata recipe (using chicken). It was yummy as is...complemented the chicken nicely. What's the deal with the no-yolk noodles? I just used regular egg noodles from my pantry. Is there a special reason the recipe called for no-yolk? It seems like they would have less flavor, but I'm not sure.

I made this dish to serve with the veal piccata, as suggested. It was very good. Sometimes simple things are the best.

Ahhh, I see this recipe is getting almost as much attention as the bacon/egg/arugula sandwich got a few months back. I made this with the pork tenderloin w/maple glaze and thought it they went perfect together.

No yolk noodles are in the same section as the egg noodles in the market where I shop. Dried. Hope that helps!

Is it just me or have I seen this recipe before online. I distinctly remember seeing the exact same thing somewhere else and making it almost 2 years ago. In any event, I LOVED this recipe, and the only thing I would change is to add some fresh garlic. Also, dont go light on the butter as its the essence of the success of this dish!

Rating: 2
This was just fine with the rest of the menu. However, my version was not as low calorie because I can not find "no-yolk egg noodles" Am I suppose to make them myself? Do I look in the fresh pasta section or dried? Usually Gourmet magazine is better at letting its reader know where to find all the ingredents.

To Boston #3, of course Boston #2 understood the sarcasm from Boston #1's message to "lighten up". Why do you think Boston #2 reacted in a less than civil way? Boston #1 was deliberately arrgravating a particular writer. And, I don't see you adding your E-mail address so we can all be pen pals. Anyway, this recipe was very good and I love this site! :)

Obviously Boston # 2 just didn't get the sarcasm of Boston's #1's comment. Oh well, I always thought my hometown was fairly savvy, guess gain. Just goes to show you that it takes all kinds to make up the world. It really is too bad that everyone has gotten so nasty. Though I do have to admit it is pretty funny to read reviews from people who take these kind of sites so very seriously. You know these are the same people who barely have an opinion when they meet you face to face. Give them some veiled version of privacy and they just let go....

Too bad the food police can't make some arrests online. Remember when it was fun to rate Epicurious recipes? Now you can't make honest opinions without someone blasting you...it sounds like someone's been in the oven a little too long.

The typical response from my children is "Oh yuck, what's the green stuff?" Well, each one of them had two helpings and loved it (green stuff and all)! Can't wait to have it tomorrow morning scrambled with an egg and chopped ham.

Delicious, easy, and quick! This is one of those why-didn't-I-think-of-that-before recipe. The no yolk noodle means we can splurge a bit by using real butter. One time I spritzed some lemon juice accidentaly, turned out it enhanced the flavor.

Often, when planning a meal by going through my magazines, I need to be reminded that a simple side dish beautifully sets off a more complicated or rich main. While constructive criticism of a recipe can be useful, snarky and nasty comments impact negatively on the enjoyment of this site and the free exchange of useful opinions.

Tasty and simple which is sometimes the best way to go. I do not understand at all the very rude and sarcastic comments - not only here but with other recipes as well. If you don't like something, can't you simply say so without being snide and so caustic about it? Seems that some people haven't learned how to disagree in a pleasant and polite way. I suspect anonymity breeds rudeness. Really people, where are your manners?!

This is an easy recipe which serves well with something like herbed chicken. It's quick to make which is great when coming home late from the gym or work. The taste is not too sophisticated that it overwhelms the main dish and it is relatively healthy. I'd definitely make it again.

This is a simple and tasty recipe, not a masterpiece, but a recipe to be used when you're tired or have spent too much time on the main course and need a simple accompaniment.

The same people denigrating this dish, would denigrate pasta with shaved ham and cream. Elegantly simple. Does the lack of complexity make this any less worthwhile? If yes, suggest they go to Italy and do a tasting tour of foods that don't require hours of prep.

So has anybody actually MADE the recipe? Why are you rating it? If you want to make snarky comments, great, but don't assign a rating to something you haven't tried. One of the best dishes I ever made was from a Deborah Madison recipe for a gorgonzola sauce over pasta. You cooked the pasta, you put the gorgonzola and cream and spices to melt and combine in a bowl over the pot while the pasta cooked, you tossed it together. Very very simple, but I might never have tried it without the imprimatur of a cooking "authority."
