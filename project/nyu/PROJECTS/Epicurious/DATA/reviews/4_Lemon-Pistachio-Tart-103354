I have made this tart for many years now and it is always a hit. My daughters high school student government has a pie auction the Tuesday before Thanksgiving every year as their major fund raiser. The 1st year this tart sold for 75.00 the 2nd year for 175.00. I am asked often to make this for bridal showers & bridal luncheons. I always make extra pistachio brittle for the tart and for snacking. Love this recipe!

I had the same issues with this tart as some of the other reviewers. I had tiny white lumps in it. Even after tempering it with the hot butter and sugar mixture. Luckily I have a sieve with a big wooden cone to push it through. It looks beautiful. The main issue I have is that I don't think I have enough filling for the tart shell (which also shrunk about 1/2inch). I think it will be a hit, but I also wish the tart were a bit thicker. It reminds me of a fruit tart without the fruit right now. Perhaps after I get the pistachios on the edge, it will be better. Since it's christmas, I was also thinking perhaps to dust the edge over the pistachios with confectioner's sugar for a snowy look. The filling tastes amazing, though!

This was delicious! Easy to make and went over very well for an Easter dessert. Did not make the pistachios part, but drizzled melted white chocolate and decorated with fresh raspberries. Would make again!

Would actually rate this a 3 1/2 forks. The filling and the pistachios are amazing, but I too had issues with the crust shrinking. I think that next time I'll stick with my usual all butter pie crust (also from Epicurious). Tart is very rich, so it served 8 comfortably at the end of a dinner. Great for company because of the beautiful presentation.

crust was fantastic.. filling was horrific. maybe I did something wrong but I brought this to easter dinner and it separated on the ride. completely went liquid and was a disaster.

Made this for girls' nite out-served with a Chiarlo Moscato d'asti and it rocked. I added more zest as I like big tang and made a graham cracker crust(which I popped in the oven for a few minutes and cooled) cause I didnt feel like messing with a pastry crust. You can alleviate the floating egg whites by whisking the eggs in a separate bowl and tempering them with a bit of the hot butter/sugar before adding to pot. This is a keeper!

Everyone loved this tart. The filling was sooo good. I couldn't find unsalted pistachios, so I subsituted hazelnuts and the result was fantastic!!

The crust tends to shrink when there is a lot of buter in it. When I have this problem, I just reduce the amount of butter. In this recipe, You could reduce it by half and still have a successful result..and little to no shrinking.

I have made this several times, it's always a slam-dunk, with one exception: the tart crust always shrinks about 1/2" in diameter. If anyone has suggestions, let me know! The curd comes out perfectly time after time, I follow the recipe to the T. And do make the pistachios! Trader Joe's sells shelled, unsalted pistachios, too.

I made this tart with lemons from my own tree for a family gathering and it was FANTASTIC! Everyone loved it and the pistachios were an absolute hit. The recipe for the dough is great and it is not too sweet and the lemon curd is also very good. I have been asked to make it again for our next gathering!

Used organic Meyer lemons and followed recipe to a T. The result was very tasty and elegant. The lemon curd could be used for many things and was delicious just by the spoonful. I'll be making this again very soon!

The dough was fabulous, the key is to not overwork it, or it gets hard (as with any dough). I didn't think the filling was very lemony, but then again I REALLY like tartness in my lemon pie. I was expecting something more spectacular. My guests thought it was delicious, though. Oh, and do make the pistachios, they are great.

The filling and pistachios were fabulous, but my tart crust was hard as a rock. Did I handle it too much, bake it too long? Any advice appreciated on achieving the flaky crust others have raved about.

To illustrate just how yummy this tart is: I decided to make this for a dinner party. I somehow screwed up the filling so that it didn't set up when I chilled it. My dinner party guests ate the liquid filling with spoons! Nobody will ever forget that party.

I made this for a 4th of July cook-out and I got a lot of compliments. I spread the pistachios over the whole top, which was pretty. One thing I will do differently next time: I will invest in a strainer and strain the filling before putting it into the crust. I had tiny pieces of egg white floating around in my filling, which nobody noticed but me. It still kind of grossed me out though. Tasted GREAT though!

This is a fantastic summer dessert! Fairly easy to make, although it takes some time for chilling. Definitely reduce cooking time to 5 mins on the lemon curd. I decorated the tart with fresh raspberries in addition to the pistachios. Looked gorgeous, everyone raved about the flaky crust and lemony flavor.

This is a very dignified dessert. The crust is easy and flaky, the curd is a gorgeous yellow, and the pistachios add a unique flare. The tart is a bit hard to cut, though, so keep wiping off your knife and work fast.

I make this for dinner parties, office potlucks, any occasion I can find really. I've passed the recipe on to numerous people as well. On top of being easy and elegant, it is remarkably delicious. My sister even makes the candied pistachios on their own as a snack!

The pistachios made so much of a difference to a regular lemon tart - what an elegant and unexpected but easy finish! I accidentally overcooked my filling so it was a littly lumpy, so I double the nuts and sprinkled them over the entire tart to cover the less-than-perfect texture with a little crunch. It was excellent! Four months later I made this again, and did the crust in advance and froze it and it was VERY difficult to make as good. I recommend doing it fresh.

Loved this tart! Easy to make and the sugared pistachios are a lovely touch. It looked picture perfect when it was done. The 2nd time I made it I was short on time so I cheated a little by using a fold-out crust in the tart pan.

What a great, easy spring/summer dessert. The lemon curd does thicken in less time than the recipe suggests, and I would recommend using pie weights when baking the crust. Mine started to puff even after I poked lots of holes in in. The weights quickly solved that problem.

Shazaam, shazaam. Everyone (including myself) loved this tart, and I will definitely make it again. I doubled the candied pistachios and only cooked the lemon filling for 7-8 minutes total (instead of 12).

Easy, beautiful and delicious. I made this to bring to my first dinner at my boyfriend's parents house. They were very impressed; his sister thought I bought it!

I've served this tart for dinner guests twice and everyone loved it. For presentation (and taste) I served it with raspberry sauce around it. The colors were beautiful and the taste was superb! The candied pistachios I will use for many desserts. Delicious! I will do it again and again.

Very good dessert. I didn't have quite enough eggs so I substituted a whole egg in place of two egg yolks in the filling, yet it was still very tasty and rich. I folded over the crust and it didn't fall in for me and cooked the filling for the recommended time, perhaps on a lower heat though. Great for summer.

This was absolutely delicious. The richness of the tart perfectly complimented my simple meal of salmon, orzo, and green beans. It was easy to make, too. I found that it serves many more than six--with three sticks of butter and so many egg yolks, it better. The pistachios were great; next time I'll make extra, so I can snack on them some more. I'll definitely be making this dessert again.

This tart was a great hit at a dinner party last night. I was rushed for time and used a pre-made shortbread crust instead of baking my own. I followed the "for God's sake don't cook the curd for the whole ten minutes" advice, and cooked it for five instead. Thanks for the advice - five minutes was perfect. Nice texture, good flavor. I'll make it again.

This dessert prompted my husband to declare it his "favorite" - which really says something given the number of desserts I make! For God's sake don't cook the curd for the whole 10 minutes! The crust is AMAZING. I almost never try new crust recipes because I love my tried and true pate brisee...but this crust is beyond compare in terms of its flavor and flake. One note: for those used to a pate brisee or sucre - you can't make the sides as high with this crust because of the egg. My first one caved in.

This tart has all the ingredients of a perfect recipe: it's simple, fast, and most of all delicious. The crust is light and flaky and the filling is a wonderful marriage of sweetness and tartness. It has a very fresh and bright flavour. I made it for a dinner party and it was very well received. I was lazy about the pistachio topping so I substituted toasted sweetened coconut flakes and it was superb. I highly recommend this recipe and I will definately make it again. In fact I'd like to have more dinner parties just so I can serve this dessert!

This was an excellent ending to any meal. I recently made this for a group of friends that REALLY enjoy food and they all thought it was fabulous. Really watch the time when cooking though, I agree with the other person, five minutes on the stove is plenty. YUMMY!!!

A real winner: easy to make, perfectly balanced between tart and sweet. I also had trouble finding unsalted pistachios, so I substituted almonds, sugared as directed in the recipe and coarsely chopped; they added some nice crunch but their flavor was overpowered by the lemon.

The tart was a big hit. I've brought it to many dinner party's. It makes a nice presentation. When cooking the lemon filling I suggest to wisk only 5 minutes to prevent mixture from separating.

Excellent - good lemon flavor. Great "no bake" recipie to end a summer meal. I made this for company so to save time i used a prepared pie shell. I could not find pistachios that were unsalted so i used unsalted walnuts and it was just as good. Tips - toast the nuts slightly to release their flavor. To avoid curdling, make sure the melted butter is not too hot when adding the eggs and whisk immediately and constantly as the recipie suggests.

This was very tasty and pretty but my lemon filling curdled or separated or something while I was cooking it. It still tasted great, though!

This is the most wonderful flaky crust and the filling is perfectly tangy.
