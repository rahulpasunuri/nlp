I cannot believe that you would offer a recipe that includes mayo when the lunch will sit at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours before being eaten. Shame on you people.

My eight year old liked it and asked for it again. I was impressed.

It was quite nice, nothing spectacular but nice and tasty, the wasabe paste was hardly noticeable though.

When a kid asks for this two days in a row, it's a hit! My daughter loved this roll-up as a great alternative to the plain tuna-on-wheat after school snack. I used pepper instead of wasabi, tossed a bit of salt on it, and didn't have the cucumbers. She can't wait for her tuna-loving friends to try it.
