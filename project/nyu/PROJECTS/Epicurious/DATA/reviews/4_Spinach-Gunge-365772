I have had this recipe forever and finally made it. Wow, it is superb. I confess I didn't puree it, just chopped the spinach before cooking and it was fabulous. I used half the butter, and I don't know whether it was because I didn't puree it, but it tasted a lot less rich than I thought it would. So good.

Sooooo good. Super rich, but so worth it (and you could probably reduce the butter and cream if you're feeling guilty)! I can't believe something so easy tastes so good. I made it as a side, but I could easily see this as a dinner in its own right with some rice and salad. YUM.

I was looking for something to do with spinach other than saute & cream. While this recipe has both of those elements, it takes it to the next level by processing it til it's silky smooth. It is very similar to a pesto I have made with spinach instead of basil (depending on the variety of spinach, this can be divine) but with cream instead of olive oil. Very rich, very addictive. I like it as a side to steak.

This recipe rocks! I love rich food but even by my account this recipe is VERY rich and thus would serve more than 4. Unfortunately I will not be making it again as my family just couldn't get over the 'gunge' look and texture. Definitely different from creamed spinach but I found it interesting and entertaining!
