This was so easy and delicious! Alterations: I used clementines instead of tangerines and a ruby grapefruit. I kept the yogurt dressing on the side. I don't measure, just added cinnamon and honey to taste. It's good to make it ahead so the yogurt has time to pick up the ginger flavor and the fruits share their juices. We served it with the asparagus and leek frittata from this site (which also went over very well) as well as ricotta stuffed french toast with caramelized bananas and some sausage. Everyone at brunch loved the salad and went for seconds!

The topping is not too nice as I believe there is too much of a cinnamon taste that overpowers everthing else.

I omitted the cinnamon, honey, and cranberries because it sounded so good with just the ginger yogurt. It was! Next time I'll probably try it with the cinnamon and cranberries, but I don't think it needs the added sweetness of the honey.

I prepared this for New Year's Day brunch - it doesn't take long to make (note you have to refrigerate the fruit salad part for 1 hr). My guests loved it - I got really great compliments.

I tossed supremes of grapefruit, tangerine and navel oranges and served with the ginger yogurt. It was delicious!

A holiday favorite I've been making since the Dec. 2004 magazine came out. Always a hit! The honey and the cinnamon are the key. I normally omit the ginger yogurt because I think it overwhelms the citrus. This year I added a little candied lemon peel on top instead, and loved it!

Made this for 9 girls on our bookclub weekend away. Drained the yogurt. Added pynapple and fresh blueberries (it is summer here in sunny South Africa and not citrus season) and ommitted the cranberries. The girls all raved about it. In fact some said it was the best fruit salad ever.

Make it for Easter breakfast, using regular yogurt I drained over night. It thickened in a lovely way.

The blend of flavors surprises you. I would use the canned oranges to save time.

i am confused - perricone lists oranges as "bad carbs" - why is this on the anti-inflamatory diet?

Wonderful as part of our Christmas brunch! Made everything exactly as the recipe stated. Loved the gingered yogurt, but could easily have used only half the amount of yogurt and ginger as we ran out of fruit long before we used all the yogurt topping.

This salad was great! We added pomegranite kernels and pineapple too because we got last minute notice that a few more people were coming and I didn' have enogh time to get to the store to double the ingredients. Next time I would omit the dried canberries though. I didn't care for them for some reason.

I served this for a brunch, and it is great! I used Greek yogurt (2%), and it stayed nice and firm, even great as leftover the next day.

Made this today for Mothers Day brunch. Everyone loved it. The cost of ginger at Trader Joe's was great. I froze the leftover fruit and yogurt for morning smoothies.

I loved this recipe. We made it for Christmas day brunch and it was a hit. Greek yogurt is the way to go for all those out there who used other types. Look for candied ginger at trader joe's or local markets, its cheaper. Also I would use a touch less cinnamon to suit my own tastes but this was a huge hit!

I served this for Christmas day brunch. Given that the candied ginger was $11.49 for a 2 oz jar (and I needed 2/3 cup) I did the following substitution: I used candied lemon peel and ran some fresh ginger root from the zester. This was a highly successful substitute. To drain the yogurt I put a paper coffee filter in a wire mesh strainer over a bowl and covered with plastic wrap. I was so surprised by the amount of liquid that came off. The result was luxurious thick and creamy yogurt. I will definitely make this recipe again. I also added fresh pineapple. Very nice contrast of textures and flavors.

I made this Christmas morning last year. Both my Mother and Mother-in-Law loved it. Very refreshing. Definitely drain the yogurt. The texture is creamy.

I made this salad for Christmas Eve dinner alongside my ham and scalloped potatoes. The salad was a huge hit. I did substitute key lime yogurt for the greek yogurt and added a sprinkling of sliced almonds on top - excellent! I will make again & try the greek yogurt this time.

Ginger yogurt wasn't good? The previous reviewer should not be trusted! ;) Seriously, we only added about 2T of the crystallized ginger, so I wonder if that's why ours was so yummy. This salad was super easy to prepare (we did it the night before our brunch) and it was G-R-E-A-T. I thought about giving it another star, but "beyond compare?" I guess I reserve that for something truely unforgettable.

The citrus salad was delicious, but the ginger yogurt wasn't very good--the flavors didn't blend well. Plain or vanilla yogurt will do next time.

What a refreshing salad. As advised, letting the ginger yogurt sit overnight was a must. Also, letting the fruit salad sit overnight not a bad idea either. Had some leftover and it tasted better the next day. Also had nasty looking oranges so I threw in pineapple. Never missed a beat. I'll make this again for sure.

My husband and I are not really fruit salad lovers but this one had use both nodding our heads. I took the time to drain plain yogurt since I couldn't find what the recipe called for. It was well worth it. Not a big fan of crystalized ginger either, but can't imagine this recipe without it. I'll make this many more times, I'm sure!

I made this based on all the fantastic reviews. The ginger yougurt was Yuck. You must really need to be a fan of ginger to like it. It was way too strong.

The ginger yogurt is great! I followed another review and mixed up the ginger and yogurt the night before to let the ginger flavor infuse the yogurt. It's delish!

This was a very refreshing dish. Definately need to let the sauce sit so the ginger flavor get soaked into the yogurt. I enjoyed it as did my friends.

i didnt use the cranberries and i ended up adding pineapple, mango, kiwi, apples, blueberries and rassberies to the oranges and grapefruit [since i also had those in the house] this was amazing.

I wanted a fruit dish for the winter and I definitely found a great one. I substituted madarins for tangerines simply because they were available on sale. I also used just a sprinkle of cinnamon (not even 1/8 tsp.) and substituted regular non-fat organic yogurt for the Greek yogurt. I didn't use any brown sugar since the fruit was sweet enought that no added sugar was necessary. Regardless of these alterations, the combination was delicious and the dish got rave reviews from my guests.

Delicious! I forgot the cranberries (will add next time) and stirred some brown sugar and ground ginger into the yogurt since I don't like crystalized. A tart & refreshing complement to sweet holiday breakfast treats.

What a delicious and refreshing dish! Lovely for Easter brunch today. I also used fat free plain yogurt, drained overnight, and it was perfect. I didn't use the brown sugar and extra dried cranberries on the yogurt, as I thought it didn't need additional sweetness.

Delicious! I served this at Christmas brunch and this week as a dessert, to rave reviews. I didn't care for the ginger in in yogurt (though I like crystalized ginger.) The second time I left some yogurt plain.

A wonderful dish for Sunday morning brunch! I would use less honey next time, because the candied ginger and dried cranberries provide enough sweetness. Draining fat-free yogurt overnight worked fine.

I threw some blood oranges in, and this was ok, but not great. perhaps just too much citrus for me. I also discovered that i am not a fan of dried cranberries, which may have coloured my opinion.

Quite good-- the ginger-citrus combo with the hint of cinnamon is a refreshing change from the ordinary.
