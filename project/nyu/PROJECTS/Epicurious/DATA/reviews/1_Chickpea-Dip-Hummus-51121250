A good basic recipe. Adjustments can be made to your own personal taste...I like to add cumin.

Not a great recipe for hummus. Was far too thick and tasteless. Added more garlic, more tahini and olive oil. Also required too much water to thin it to a decent blendable consistency. Probably will not use it again.
