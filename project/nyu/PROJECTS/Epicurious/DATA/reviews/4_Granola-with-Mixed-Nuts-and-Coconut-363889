Really like this granola. We felt it needed a touch of cinnamon and salt. so I added that after it was finished and think it suited our tastes better.

My daughter ordered this for breakfast at the Fly Trap & I've been looking for the recipe ever since! It is sooo good, especially the way they serve it- with chopped apples & dried cherries over vanilla yogurt. Can't wait to make this!

This was really good the second time I made it. The first time I over did the nuts so that was a throw away... but the second time it worked out perfectly... I added some rosemary the second time too. Complex flavor but kinda fun. Thanks.

This is yummy, although a little pricey if you have to purchase all the nuts at one time. But once you've bought them you will have plenty to make the recipe again a few times. Cooking the nuts in the butter gives them a beautiful color and delicious flavor. The pepper seemed an odd ingredient but was really a delicious addition. May try adding some dried fruit next time.

Just finished making this and it is yummy! Couple things I'd do a little differently though. First, the nuts toasted a little faster than the recipe indicated and the pine nuts went really fast. Next time I'll add them to the pan a little later. Secondly, I'll use less butter next time as well. When the nuts were done, I put them on paper towels to catch the excess. Still very good. I see making this many times. Would love to convert to an oat cake/cookie. Great over yogurt!
