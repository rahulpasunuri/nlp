Measured carefully, however could cut no more than 25 sticks from rolled out dough measuring 4 x 16 inches. Dough so short the sticks are next to impossible to pick up. So salty could hardly eat them. Wonder if there's a misprint in recipe--perhaps should be 1-3/4 c flour? Would not make them again.

I had read the previous reviewers' comments about excessive saltiness and approached this recipe with some wariness. But I needed a vegetarian snack in a hurry so I gave it a try. With a few modifications, they turned out really well. I only added a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt to the dough, substituted nigella seeds for the mustard seeds (just because I love the flavor), and sprinkled the top sparingly with fleur de sel. Everyone loved them. I think the problems the previous reviewers encountered might be a result of using coarse salt in the dough. It probably did not become fully incorporated because of the large granules and so created an excessively saltly taste. I would say: reduce the amount of salt in the dough; use kosher salt in the dough; and coarse salt on top only.

Like a previous cook, I too found these WAY too salty and not at all tasty (and I did use unsalted butter). Too much of a pain to make for the results.

Delicious! To the cook who found these too salty -- be sure to use unsalted butter. That way, the sticks only have one tablespoon of salt in them.

Absolutely Great and new at cocktail time!

Although easy to make, these were much too salty (even for someone who enjoys salt, like myself). I plan to try them again, but eliminate either the salt in the dough or the salt sprinkled on top.
