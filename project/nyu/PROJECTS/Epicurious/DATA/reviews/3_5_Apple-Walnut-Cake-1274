I made exactly to the recipe the first time (which was great!), then made it a bit more healthy the second time. Here's what I did: added 1/2 C apple butter and reduced the butter to 1/2 stick (1/4 C) as well as reduced the sugar to 2/3 C. I used brown sugar instead of white, and used all whole wheat flour instead of white. It was actually better than the original recipe, IMO.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes, especially in the fall when I have backyard apples (any kind seems to work) and walnuts. It goes together really fast (even when you have to shell the walnuts first--about a dozen) without generating a huge number of dirty dishes! I've made it many times just as the recipe says, but over time I've made slight changes to suit my taste--and what I happen to have on hand at the time. I use about 3/4 cup packed soft brown sugar, or half brown and half white. I reduce the amount of salt to a pinch, and omit it altogether if all I have on hand is salted butter. I add 1 tsp. baking powder and reduce the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. I'm not so keen on cinnamon, so I use 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice, plus 1 tsp vanilla for a flavor that I prefer. I have also baked it as muffins (about 16) but prefer it as a cake. Either way, the smell when it is baking is just divine!

This is great with plums too... I added vanilla & cardamom to the batter & it was probably better than the apple version, which I have made many times!

I loved this cake. It was easy to make and quick. I did substitue pecans and it was perfect a 4 fork cake.

I loved this recipe! My husband does not eat any dairy so I used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of butter. I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. I used half whole wheat pastry flour. I also added a streusel topping made with rolled oats, brown sugar and Earth Balance. Served warm with vanilla ice cream (non-dairy for the hubby). So delicious and fairly easy to make.

Very nice basic coffee/snack cake. For those wondering, I have made this substituting up to 4Tbs butter with apple sauce & it is moist & rich. I imagine it would do well with whole wheat flour as well. I usually do 2/3-3/4C sugar & sub golden brown for some of that. I add a tsp of vanilla & play with the spices. I have used many types of apples, added currents, dried cherries & also put toasted pecan strusel on top (omitting the walnuts in the batter). It's always good.

Delicious and easy cake. Used half whole wheat pastry flour and half white flour and reduced to 3/4c. sugar with good results for bfast/snack cake. Will make again.

great simple recipe. I was cleaning out the fridge, so i doubled everything except sugar (only used 1 c) and butter (only had 1 stick) but added a little oil as it was pretty dry and hard to mix. Used almonds instead of walnuts since i didnt have any. It was good with almonds, but would have been better with walnuts. Next time I will try and make it "healthier" by substituting whole wheat for some of the ap flour.

This recipe has been a staple for me since it came out in print! It is delicious and everyone loves it. But does anyone know of healthy alternatives to the sugar and white flour? I'd like to try to cut the flour with ground oats and the sugar with honey.

This was delicious and super easy. Cut sugar to 3/4C as was suggested by some and since it wasn't attractive looking I made a glaze and drizzled it on the cake. Looked great!

Quick, simple, easy! Warm apples, cinnamon and walnut! Who could ask for anything more. You absolutely MUST eat with vanilla ice cream. I was more generous with the apples and walnuts than the recipe stated and loved it. It only took 30 minutes of bake time for me.

To the cook from Missouri: Thanks for the substitutions. This cake is excellent and easy to make. Even my M-I-L who usually doesn't like to try anything new, dove into this one. She asked when I'm going to make it again, and my husband suggested I hide the leftovers, otherwise it will be gone by morning. I used 1/2 cup of cranberies instead of walnuts and it was very good.

also baking time should be 30 to 35 min..not 45 ..on the revised cake I just talked about

This recipe is much more moist if you put the sugar over apples and let it stand about 30 minutes to draw the juice .. use oil instead of butter. Mix egg and oil then add to apples ..use 1 c. flour instead of 1 1/4.. use 1/2 teas salt..additional ingredients.. 1 teas vanilla and 1/2 raisens ..try it.. It is much better

i subbed apple sauce for melted butter because i was too lazy to melt the butter. it turned out really dry. so don't do that.

I just didn't like this anywhere near as much as the other reviewers. To me, it tasted like what are often called 'blonde brownies' or 'blondies.' Very chewy. I took them out of the oven at 40 minutes (5 min less than suggested time), and they were completely cooked through -- maybe could have even taken them out at 35 min.

I made this in a bundt cake pan which improved the presentation. The flavor of the cake was excellent. I think I'll try ice cream or a simple pour over icing next time.

What a great recipe. Followed the others' suggestions, halved the sugar. Its perfect, especially with a little ice cream or caramel sauce on top! My husband, who doesn't usually like sweets, really went for this one.

Halfed the sugar, used one Granny Smith and half a Fuji apple, added some pecans and walnuts and baked it for 30 minutes. The cake is so easy to prepare. You can do everything in one bowl, no messy clean up. Most importantly, very yummy when it's warm.

Rating: 4
So yummy. Made this to bring into the office today for a little pre-Thanksgiving cheer. All that is left is a crumb or two. Took the others advice and used less sugar 3/4 cup and actually did it with a mix of brown and regular sugar, doubled the recipe, added a little extra apple and just about a 1/4 cup of milk for a little extra moisture. Oh and mine was done in 40 minutes.

Rating: 4
Perfect and moist. Half the sugar (like everyone else says) and even add some extra apple (use 3 if the apples are small or medium). Make at least 2 batches because it goes fast! Great for breakfast or dessert.

Forgot to mention, the cake was fully baked for only 35 minutes.

Ever so simple to make, and the result is great. Slightly crispy on the surface and moist, fluffy inside. I used a pie pan instead, and I halved the sugar, it still taste sweet enough. I diced the apple finely, actually the cake turned out not "not pretty", it looks quiet reasonable. It tastes and smells lovely. Very good recipe.

Rating: 3
So easy! I used Presto cake-flour and omitted the baking soda. I love to cook (and eat) Crispin (also called Mutsu) apples because they are tart and hold their shape well. Walnuts would have been great in this cake but I didn't have any on hand so I used baker's raisins. They come in a cup-size pouch and aren't dry. They keep your cake/cookies moist. This cake turned out really great..light and fluffy and not too sweet since i halved the sugar. I do agree with the other reviews..it isn't too pretty! Maybe a crumb or streusel topping would make it look nicer! Still, it tastes great!

I have made this many times, usually with Fuji apples as that is what I have on hand. Fujis work well, as they can hold up to baking. My husband loves this recipe, and it is very simple to prepare. I usually serve it with vanilla ice cream for dessert, but it is also good with afternoon tea. It isn't the prettiest cake, so I think it is best for family eating.

Rating: 3
Sooo easy. It took me about 10 minutes to whip it up and pop it in the oven, then 40 to bake. I used three small Macintosh apples and my batter also looked like cookie dough, but it came out delicious, especially served w/a dollop of whipped cream. Next time I might cut the sugar and serve for breakfast. Any ideas for making it prettier?

I call this a dish beyond compare because it was delicious and ridiculously easy. One bowl, simple ingredients that I always have on hand, and so quick to throw together that I know we'll make it often. My 4-yo daughter said it's her favorite cake ever. Leftovers were great the next day--this cake is almost too moist! I subbed 1/4 of the flour w/ white whole wheat, BTW.

Very easy and delicious. I'll use 3/4 c. sugar in the future. Definitely a keeper.

This one was a big surprise. I made it only because I happened to have some apples lying around and wanted to bake something for dessert. Didn't expect to think it was fabulous, but it really is. Very moist (although it ends up looking like its going to be dry and burnt), and a gorgeous flavor. Husband said it sort of reminded him of carrot cake. Incredibly easy to make too - it was ready to go into the oven within 15 minutes.

Try this...it makes the cake so much better. Cook the apples down to soft, using a little butter, and a bit of water, being careful not to carmelize the mixture. Replace the butter with oil. DELICOUS!!!!!

Stunningly easy, simple, and quick, and surprisingly good - both out of the oven and later at room temperature. Nothing fancy, just like a basic cinnamon coffee cake. We used 3/4c sugar, which worked out just fine, and also took it out of the oven after only 35 mins.

The best cooking stories are always about someone else's mistakes. Well, my batter came out like cookie dough. I used too many apples for the batter I had. I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup (personal taste). I had doubled the recipe, so I baked it anyway. It came out perfectly fabulous. You can't keep a good cake down!!

Pair it up with the Spiced Rum Sauce recipe and this will be a winner everytime. I left out the walnuts, not a fan, but doubled the recipe as suggested and served on Turkey Day... a huge hit!

made this on a whim and am eating it now, hot from the oven. i probably should have waited for it to cool and firm up a bit, but oh well...this is a deliciously moist cake, and better than the (similar) "santori" apple cake recipe. it took less than an hour to put together including the baking time, which is great. yummy and casual and quick.

I changed the recipe by substituting pecans for the walnuts. It makes for a great coffeecake with an omlet. When I lived in the high country of Colorado I added 1/4 cup of skim milk for added moisture and now use half that amount here in PA.
