I made these green beans arlier this week and followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I used a white onion. The dish turned out great. My photo is at http://koshercamembert.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/even-my-dishes-have-dishes/ -- it pretty much looks exactly like the picture on this site!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was perfect since it requires very little last-minute work and can be served room temp. I blanched the gren beans the day before and just tossed it all together at serving time. The tanginess was a nice counterpoint to rich thanksgiving side dishes. Added salt and pepper and a little extra sugar.

Wow--I thought this was really great. A wonderful combination of flavors and a great side dish. I'd even be tempted to give it four forks! I saved the leftovers and ate them cold the next day--I definitely think this is something to be eaten shortly after cooking. Nevertheless, a great dish that I'll definitely make again.

We found this recipe bland. We're going to try making it again this time adding chopped garlic with the onions.

We included this with our Thanksgiving buffet. All of our guests loved it. I used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar only because we didn't have any on hand. We will make it again!

I absolutely love this dish. I've made a whole bowl and eaten it myself! I've made it 5-6 times. Others in my family are less enthusiastic. I tried to make it more low cal with slightly less sugar and less olive oil. It's just not as good. Now I follow the recipe exactly. Yum!

Easy to make, plus its different from other vinegarettes - the crunch of the mustard seeds adds another dimension.

This was fine, but nothing special. I probably won't make it again.

I made this for a Memorial Day get together and it was a big hit. I did make twice the vinaigrette called for so those who preferred more "dressing" could use it. I wouldn't change a thing! One word of advice though... use a screen to cover the pan when popping the mustard seeds... they go everywhere if you don't!

I made this recipe for a cook-out and my friends loved it. The beans come out crisp if you follow the recipe and use the ice bath. The dish is sort of tangy with the red onions and the vinegar. The mustard seeds add an interesting touch. Would recommend it at a cook-out instead of other tangy salads.

This was a good recipe, but I liked it better with different variations. I served just the red onions with a mustard coated pork tenderlion (also from this site)and it was a big hit. Also used just the dressing on roasted califlower which was very tasty.

I really liked this recipe. It has a light flavor which pairs well with heavier dishes. I put the onions on top of the beans for a great presentation. This dish paired very well with "PARMESAN CHICKEN" from this site.

Very tasty, a good choice for a summer menu. Be careful not to let the beans sit too long in the vinagrette, they will discolor and detract from the presentation.

I made this recipe exactly as called for and the results were good but not great. The second time around, I tossed the green beans with a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper and roasted them at 400 degrees, stirring occasionally, until they were tender (instead of steaming them as called for in the original recipe). I then added the onion/mustard seed vinaigrette and everybody I served this variation to liked it much better than the original.

A different way to prepare green beans - the dressing could use a bit more "kick". Lovely presentation w/the mustard seeds.

I am looking forward to taking this lovely grean bean salad to my next bring-a-dish-event. I think the key to this one is toasting the mustard seeds sufficiently and not overcooking the beans. I also substituted really good balsamic vinager, becuase I didn't have red wine vinger. And, really liked it

what a great blend of flavors. I was sorry that I had halved the recipe, both my husband and I were looking for leftovers.

I thought it was pretty good, but my husband (who doesn't like 3-bean salad, didn't like it. So, if you are looking for an alternative to the run-of-the-mill 3-bean salad, you will probably like this. If you want a "hot" green recipe, this isn't the one for you. Try it!

This recipe was so good that my husband and I ate a serving for four ourselves. It was simpler to make than it first appeared. I was out of red wine vinegar, so used red raspberry vinegar and maybe that is what gave it an extra kick. I'm making it again for my girlfriends.

I made this recipe this past weekend - just so-so. I felt like it was missing something, but couldn't quite place it. Perhaps it was due to the comparison of our favorite green bean "recipe" - throwing them on the grill in tin foil with chopped tomatoes, red onion, garlic, basil, oregano, fresh lemon juice and white wine vinegar. My husband and I will probably pass on making this recipe in the future, and opt for our old standby.
