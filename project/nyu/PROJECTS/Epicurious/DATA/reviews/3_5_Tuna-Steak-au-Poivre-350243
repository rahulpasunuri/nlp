What a sad, sad waste of some beautiful tuna steaks. They turned out so hideously peppery that my eyes watered. And that sauce! So bitter and salty that I spit it out. Just terrible.

This was a great and easy recipe. The dipping sauce makes it!!! I put in extra ginger because I like it.

Great recipe! followed the recipe and added a little extra ginger, because I know I like ginger. We will make this again

Absolutely loved it! I made it twice. Using low sodium soy sauce and adding the water to the mixture is critical because otherwise it is too salty. I used regular soy sauce the second time and should have added more water to compensate.

Very tasty. I made as is except added about two tablespoons of sesame oil to the sauce. Served over fresh sauteed spinach.

The tuna steaks were wonderful - the dipping sauce I threw out, luckily before I served it.

we love this recipe and have made it at least 6 times. The recipe cooking time for the tuna is way too much however. For inch thick tuna steaks we cook a maximum of 2 minutes per side. we then remove from the pan and put on a plate and cover with tin foil. while we plate whatever vegetable we are serving with the tuna. We have had both brussel sprouts and brocoli along with the tuna and both were excellent. the sauce is good over vegetables as well. we double the amount of ginger from the recipe as both my girlfriend and I love fresh ginger.

Watery? Soy and water base should be watery. Bland? Anything but! Delicious! We were eating he sauce with a spoon before cooking the fish. Cooked the tuna on the grill for 3 1/2 minutes per side. Will make this again soon for friends!

Very Tasty! We grilled the tuna (4 min on the first side, 3 min on the second) and serve with pickled ginger. It was a big hit last night!

This was such a great, healthy, FAST, easy recipe. I went a little light on the water, used reduced sodium soy sauce, squeezed two full limes into the dipping sauce, and chopped up a small handful of cilantro into the sauce as well. The sauce is SUPPOSED to have a watery texture and it was delicious. For the tuna, I didn't have fresh peppercorns so I mixed coriander and some grill seasoning and it worked perfectly.

Excellent recipe! Cooked the tuna in a cast iron skillet. Used shallots instead of scallions in the dipping sauce. Also used 1 TBS spicy soy sauce with Tabasco and 2 TBS low salt soy sauce. Loved the dipping sauce and will make this recipe again.

I made this last night for my husband and the tuna steak itself was delicious. But the so called sauce was terrible. Too watery and bland. But my husband liked it...I would prefer to eat the steak with just a lemon and olive oil dressing.

My husband made this for me the other night and it was delicious. Instead of making this a dipping sauce, he marinaded the steaks in it. It was fabulous. He made it on the stove top. We're making it again for friends, only this time on the grill. If you're going to use it as a marindate, I wouldn't suggest leaving the steaks in too long. Marinades are tricky, particularly with fish. It can actually start the cooking process, depending on what the ingredients are. Bon Appetite!

I've made this several times and think it's really good. The stove top works fine, but tonight I put it on the grill and it was great. Definitely cook less than directed (3-4 minutes per side tops). I served it with the "Mixed Greens with Tangerines and Fennel" on this site, and jasmine rice to which I added some toasted coconut.

The dipping sauce was a little salty so I would use low sodium soy sauce next time. I added a little Sirachi hot sauce to spice it up a bit more.

Tuna is not my favorite fish, as I find it is often dry and too "meaty", but this is an excellent preparation that my husband and I both enjoyed. I used tuna medallions rather than steaks, which worked well. I agree that 6 minutes is a bit too long for seared tuna that is red in the middle; 4 to 5 minutes is more appropriate. I added a bit more green onion and sugar to the dipping sauce, as I felt it was a bit heavy on the soy, and it turned out amazing. Served the tuna on a bed of spring greens, with basmati rice on the side. Excellent, healthy meal (with very few dishes to clean too -- added bonus!).

Very good and easy.

I was expecting something amazing given the previous reviews. While the dipping sauce is tasty, it's nothing unusual. But the real disappointment was the tuna itself. Six minutes produces well-done fish, not medium-rare. I used frozen ahi tuna steaks that were one inch think. Perhaps fresh would have been better, but if it's flash frozen, it should be as good as fresh. The peppercorns and coriander were ok, but couldn't compensate for the dry texture of the fish.

My husband said this was the best dish I had EVER made...This was so easy, I almost felt I couldn't take credit. Both my toddler and my preschooler devoured it; ate the tuna with basmati rice and poured the "dipping sauce" over both. Delicious, simple, very impressive!

The scallion green really brings out the natural flavor of the tuna. I grilled the tuna and added a little wasabi for heat purposes. It was fabulous... A great healthy meal!

Just enough flavor.. I would have added more heat. Tuna has so much flavor to it already, and scallions bring it out. A great healthy meal!
