I've made this pie filling several times this fall. After reading the reviews about using a hazelnut crust, I decided to add a handful of walnuts to the filling. The walnuts make it even better. I have also added an apple or two if I am short on pears. To the reviewer who suggested poaching under ripe pears... thank you for your help.

To the previous chef: if the pears you used were not ripe enough, all you have to do is to poach them first until they became soft.

This pie was delicious, and fun to make. The only problem I had was that I must not have used pears that were ripe enough, and they were still too crunchy once I cut and served the pie. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could do next time if I still can't find pears that are completely ripe? Poaching them, maybe? The crust, on the other hand, was perfection itself. I've used it since as the crust on many of my pies.

I, also, am rating the filling alone. I added a small amount of fresh lemon juice to prevent the pears discoloring, and I halved the amount of cinnamon, and that was plenty for our palates. I did not have any brandy and used some good Jamaican rum...... it was all absolutely delicious!

This review is for the filling only. (I used the crust from "Pear & Fig Pie with Hazelnut Crust" on the epicurious site for a little more drama.) This filling was fantastic! I've never made a pear pie before and it proved to be unusual for my guests. The only thing I added to the recipe was the zest of 1 lemon and bit of lemon juice to keep the pears from discoloring. The brown sugar, cinnamon, brandy & fruits create a heavenly sauce that is complex yet simple in flavor. This filling would be fantastic prepared as a compote and served over ice cream, but it was very dramatic in the hazelnut crust. My first slice left about 1/4 cup of sauce in the bottom of the pie plate, so next time I may add another tbsp of cornstarch to prevent that. But otherwise, I was terribly impressed with this recipe!

First of all, the crust on this pie is heavenly. The cream cheese makes for all of the light flakiness of a crust made with shortening, but without the hydrogenated oils, which is a big plus in my book. The filling is also delicious, although some people might wish to take the seeds out of the figs before putting them in the pie, as the seeds do add a little crunchiness. This pie was good the first day, but absolutely delicious the second day. I put a few drops of brandy in the whip cream I served with the pie, which rounded the dish off nicely.
