I'll start by saying that the flavors are very good. I started out making this exactly to spec. I had about a cup of red sauce and it was nowhere near enough. Three cups would be about right. When I realized this I went to my pantry and grabbed a can of tomato paste and added it and some water. That saved it. I wouldn't make this again. I think it has way too much octopus and I think I prefer a more traditional Frutti Del Mare.

To the cook from Long Island- just curious- you didn't use pasta because too many carbs, but said you need plenty of bread for dipping...?

I thought this was delicious, but of course, I made changes. I didn't use octopus. I used littlenecks, mussels and shrimp. I would have used squid as well, but they were out at my fish market. I, too, added lemon. The flavors are fantastic and my husband LOVED it. Frankly, I did, too!

I have to say being the first to try a recipe is dangerous and downright brave. I did make changes and they are: I left out the spaghetti. (Too many carbs). I also left out the octopus. I added 1/2 lb. bay scallops, 2 lbs. mussels and 1 lb. littleneck clams. The squid I bought frozen already cut into pieces. All seafood I added at same time. Let cook about 10 min. then add your tomato sauce. Let all cook until 5 minutes before done then add the basil puree into it. I also added red pepper flakes. I thought it needed some acidity so I also added 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. Add some chopped parsley at end and WOW!!! Need plenty of bread for dipping. The seafood makes enough of its own liquid here. Do try!!
