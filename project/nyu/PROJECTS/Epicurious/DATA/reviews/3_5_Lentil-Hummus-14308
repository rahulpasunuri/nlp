This was okay as written. I ended up adding two sauteed red peppers and two tablespoons of almond butter to the food processor and that made a huge difference in taste. We ate it with warm pita and it was good, but only with the additions. If I make it again, next time I will use less tahini and more almond butter.

I probably doubled the amount of lentils and added a can of chickpeas/garbanzos, and also cumin, ground red pepper, and used concentrated lemon juice (b/c that's what I had!) and just kept adding more of everything else to taste! LOVE IT!

This was the perfect recipe for some leftover cooked lentils. I tend to go more lemony on hummus, and it certainly needs a lot of salt to bring it up to a tasty level. Very easy and would even be good spread on sandwiches!

Delicious!! Added more garlic, and lemon, salt/pepper to taste. Also used 1/2 a large white onion in food processor. Scrumptious. Warning: be prepared for a lot of hummus. If you are just one person, you may want to divide the recipe in half. Happy cooking...

I make this often and just found your recipe. The only thing is that I add cumin, red pepper flakes, and sometimes ginger and rice vinegar (the vinegar if I don't have lemons). I like it best warm and I eat it on rice cakes (I have to eat gluten free)

Very garlicky, a little bland but definitely better the next day. I did get several compliments on it from my guests, but only about 3 or 4 people out of 40.

Easy and yummm! I had about a cup of lentils, so I put slightly less of everything. It worked out great. If there's not enough flavor, since one cook said it was too bland, you can put more tahini, lemon juice, or salt. The lentils wouldn't be the problem. The lemons I had were strong, so I actually put less juice.

I LOVED this hummus. I followed the recipe to a T and found it too thick and added at least another 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I also added another little bit of tahini - just for some more flavor. I thought it was absolutely delicious - a definite make again!

If you love garlic (and we do), this is a great recipe. We've had success each time we make it, and get compliments on it.

I was not impressed. I thought this was thick and gloppy; kind of bland. I much prefer traditional chickpea hummus. I will not make this again.

This is delicious and so authentic! I used a 14oz. can of cannellini beans for a quicker dish, and added 1/2 t. chili powder and 1/2 t. cumin for a little kick. Garnish with olive oil and paprika. A perfect afternoon snack.
