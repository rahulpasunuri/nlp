The moraccan salsa is out of this world! It would work with many fish dishes, or even chicken.

OMG amazing recipe. I am allergic to bell peppers so followed advice of another cook and used about 8 chery tomatoes diced instead. Also couldn't find rasins in the pantry so substituted chopped dried aprricots which were excellent. I decided to sear the sea bass skin first in the oil and spices left in the skillet from the first step and then tranferred the skilliet to a 500degree oven for abot 8 mins. It was roasted perfectly, had extra flavour and I didn't have to risk the fillets coming apart. Served it with soft polenta instead as I am also gluten sensitive. Our company was completely wowed! Sea bass is expensive (about $24 a pound) but very nice as a treat for a special occassion.

Made this for my husband and I. I gotten a couple sea bass on a whim (I'd never cooked it before) and decided to try the recipe since I had everything else on hand. We served the fish and salsa with couscous. The flavors were very, very different from what we expected. We don't eat a lot of African food, so that may have been it. While both of us agreed that everything was very tasty together (fish, salsa and couscous), the leftover salsa and couscous were not. It needed the fish to hold the flavor of the salsa from becoming overpowering. Since I only had the 2 fillets and made the full recipe for the salsa, we ended up throwing out pretty much all of the leftovers.

This is exceptional. The combination of spices is exquisite. Made according to recipe except cooked the fish on a grill pan and made 50% more salsa which was delicious. A definite keeper.

I made this with rainbow trout and bottled roasted red peppers. I found the whole dish delicious, and as many have mentioned, the salsa would go well with all kinds of food.

Great flavours...the only thing that I changed was I didn't add any raisins; instead I added about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar. Also, to add flavour to the sea bass, I took about 1/3rd of the salsa and marinated the fish in this, covered in the fridge for about 2 hours. It was awesome!!! A great accompaniment is a quinoa/couscous salad with roasted Mediterranean vegetables.

I was disappointed with this after reading the rave reviews. The sauce was a little boring; a surprise considering the interesting ingredients. Served it over fabulous sea bass and it would probably satisfy a dinner party because it's so mild yet sounds exotic.

Yummy !!! Served this with couscos as suggested and it was perfect. One of my guests actually left with receipe that I had printed out :) That's what I call a success

Yum! This was a big hit with my dinner guests. I omitted the olives since I am not a huge fan. I made minted couscous and steamed asparagus w/lemon as sides.

Very fresh and easy dish to prepare. The cumin/cinnamon combination is pretty interesting and mixed with the rest of these ingredients, makes a very unique meal. We loved it. Made it with Seven-Vegetable Couscous, found elsewhere on the site.

Outstanding. This is truly a winner. Someone below said the salsa is a little time consuming but hey, we're cooks! Some things are just worth it. This is a jewel.

Awesome, salsa works with almost any white fish, I have used halibut, and red snapper

Excellent ! The only thing I changed was that I used tomatoes instead of peppers as I had none on hand. Guests loved it and even left with the receipe

Delicious! Took one reviewers advice of adding capers--great suggestion! My husband who loves things with "sauces" was very impressed. I will keep this one!

Absolutely delicious! I also made this with tilapia, as my fish store didn't have sea bass today. The salsa is out of this world - the only change I'd make for next time would be to add a little more orange zest. (And get to the fish store early enough to buy a more flavorful fish than tilapia.)

This was fantastic -- got rave reviews. Be sure to add lots of orange peel. We also added some juice from the orange as well. Served it with tilapia and couscous w/ artichoke hearts.

I didn't care for the Moroccan Salsa, though the fish was delicious without it.

Because roasted peppers don't agree with my stomach, I just used ripe tomatoes (uncooked) instead of the peppers. Everything else I did the same, although used a bit less olive oil. Delicious salsa. Tons of it too. Served over baked orange roughy. Agree that the simpliest side is the best - anything else will be overwhelmed.

Rating: 4
The salsa is beyond delicious. I changed 2 things - I left out the mint (not a fan)and the olives (not my husband's favorite) and added some capers instead. We couldn't belive we were eating at home and not at an expensive ethnic restaurant. Easy & delicious. Can't beat that!

We both liked this recipe. I used 2 red peppers instead of three, cut down some on the oil and seared the sea bass and finished in the oven because mine were thick. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a tasty, healthful meal. I served with the couscous mixed with peas and chives mentioned by a previous reviewer. It was a good combo.

Rating: 4
This was an excellent combination of flavors. I too used red bell peppers from a jar, don't think it made a bit of difference, and I cut the oil to only the first tablespoon to heat the spices (New Years resoultions and all) also don't think that distracted from it...as a matter of fact, it may have been too oily had I used the entire 3 tablespoons in the salsa. Served with couscous with onions and pine nuts and some sauted carrots with curry. Very happy campers with this.

Very simple and delicious. I made it for a dinner party and served with couscous and salad. Everyone was pleased. One of my guests had been to a North African restaurant for lunch and said that it didn't even compare to the amazing flavor of this dish. Really, it's the flavors of the salsa that make it unforgettable. I will defintely make this again.

I made this twice. Once for the fish course for a mediterranean themed 9 course dinner for a charity. It was the absolute hit of the evening and the only dish the guests requested the recipe for! The second time I made it, I forgot the orange rind...still was outstanding!

I've made this recipe three times and the salsa is simply fabulous! It's great as an accompaniment to roasted pork too. Highly recommend!!

This was absolutely delicious! The salsa is a bit labor intensive so I served a packaged lentil pilaf and roasted asparagus, mushrooms, zuchini and yellow peppers. Will definately make again. Also, I couldn't get fresh mint, but it was awesome even without.

Really delicious! I cut the recipe into thirds, ended up with a lot of leftover salsa even so. The flavors work so well together. I served it with couscous with green onions, and sauteed spinach. It was a little time consuming, particularly roasting the pepper, but well worth it!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! The flavors of the salsa blend together suprisingly well and provide a lovely complement to the sea bass. I ended up baking it for 20-25 minutes at 350 instead of broiling because I used a thick Chilean sea bass and was worried it wouldn't cook through. But it turned out very well!

The salsa was fantastic. It was easy to prepare. As with many recipes the chopping timing takes the longest, but you can do this the day before or in the morning. I actually served the salsa with lamb chops and lamb burgers. The taste combination was tantilizing and the perfect wine pairing with the lamb and salsa was a Zinfandel which can hold up to the little bit of spice.

INCREDIBLE! Would work for chicken too

I made this as the main course for my parents' 40th wedding anniversary. It was a huge success! I served it with a cauliflower curry, mixed vegetable couscous, and a cucumber raita. Dessert was fresh fruit with a honey mousse. My father and brother are on strict diets, but this pleased all!

This is a scrumptious salsa! I roughly halved the recipe (but used only one red pepper) as it was only for two of us. I used very fresh halibut instead of sea bass - grilled on the BBQ. Served the halibut over lightly garlicked mashed potatoes and topped with the salsa. I think this salsa would also be good on grilled chicken breasts. The salsa takes a fairly long time to prepare but it is very well worth the time.

very easy, very quick, and very delicious! i made this recipe as an appetizer for my cooking club and everyone loved it. i used black sea bass (MUCH cheaper than chilean) which provided excellent texture/flavor. good colors for presentation--can be impressive if plating is done right. i think i will do a quick pan fry next time--to have a crisper texture on the fish.

This salsa was a perfect compliment, filled with robust flavours. Blackening the bell peppers on a bbq is easier and more flavourful than under the broiler. A vegetable couscous goes wonderfully with the fish/salsa.

Great recipe! I made it for our 43rd anniversary and hoped my husband would like the combination of flavors in the salsa. HE DID! I served it with an orzo pilaf and some roasted vegetbles. Great meal!

Actually, my husband made this for me last night. I am not a huge fan of fish, but this blew my mind! He used talapia instead and served it with boiled purple potatoes and sauteed spinach!! YUM!

Lovely!! Two of us ate ALL that wonderful salsa... used plain ole couscous alongside. I agree with the other reviewers in that a flashy side dish would be lost. Served baby green salad topped with chilled asparagus/green beans and also grilled corn on the cob. I'm ready to eat it again right now!

just a phenomenal recipe. nothing else to say other than it was soooo good.

We made this with sea bass known in southern US as rock fish. This is quite a mixture of flavors that fills the entire mouth with both a slight sweetness and a good texture. Does not need a flashy tasking side dish. Stick to middle eastern flavors. It will steal the show!

Incredible, fruity salsa- very unique dish- delicious! Avoid serving bones in the fish.

My friends loved this dish. I made the Moroccan Salsa a few hours before serving and kept it at room temperature. The flavours blended nicely. I served this dish with tomatoes & lentil couscous. It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was wonderful! And I do agree that the salsa kind of scares you by itself, but once it is on top of that delicious fish and the bite going in your mouth has both flavors, you will love it! We followed the recipe, but grilled the fish instead of cooking in the oven and it was perfect. And the salsa does go well with couscous as we made some with mushrooms and a bit of garlic and onion in it. Definietly one to try!

This was awsome! I will definately make this again. I used 5 med. rainbow trout instead of the sea bass. Dusted them with flour and fried them in a bit of olive oil and topped with the salsa.. Definately a keeper!

this was bizarre! i prepared the salsa one day in advance and the taste test had me worried. such an unusual mixture of flavors alone but when partnered with piping hot fish, magnificent! guests were impressed! need good directions for fluffy couscous? check out "saffron couscous w/ peas and chives". I 86ed the saffron and peas for this plate.

I love sea bass and this salsa is fabulous - wonderful combination. I agree that the salsa should be made ahead making this a great make ahead recipe for entertaining. You could buy roasted peppers in the jar if you want to save some prep time.

This is a lovely, simple, and incredibly flavorful recipe. We served couscous a la greque with it, and it was stunning. The only thing I would change is to make the salsa a day early and let it stand. We did it right ahead of serving and it had a "raw" and unmarried flavor. The leftovers, however, were outstanding!

Rating: 4
Looks even better than the picture! I made the full recipe of salsa for 2 of us and caught my husband dumping the bowl on his couscous. This is definitely dinner party material. Such a delicate, well balanced, exotic flavor. Don't skimp on the salsa and pass any extra at the table. Trust the forks on this one. Would love to find a restaurant that does it this well!!

Excellent recipe. I added some spices to the fish prior to broiling - did need to broil a few minutes longer than recipe indicated. We loved this dish.

Rating: 4
Prep time took me longer than expected, but once the salsa was prepared, this dish is a snap, and the results equivalent with today's cutting edge hot spots. Even under a very hot infrared broiler, I felt the fish needed another minute per side. I also tossed the chopped peppers in the cumin/cinnamon oil in the pan (instead of pouring onto peppers--didn't want to waste a drop!) Served on heated plates, this is a dish I will serve for guests at a dinner party. A great fall/winter meal!

Wonderfull dish that is relatively simple to prepare but gives appearance of intense effort. Wonderful combination of flavors. We tend to use for special occassions and prefer roasting the fish to broiling it. Either way, spectacula flavor.
