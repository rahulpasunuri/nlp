Delicious. I used mexican crema instead of sour cream and asian chili paste for the chili sauce. Spicy, creamy and a totally unique knockout.

Used chili paste rather than chili sauce? Lots of fresh dill. Dipped crackers and veggies...way better than onion dip!

A bit too spicy, reduce the chili sauce. Could be a good base for other flavors.

Very easy and delicious. The chili sauce adds a bit of sweetness and spiciness. I made this for Thanksgiving and served with veggies. It would make a great substitute for tartar sauce with fish and chips.

Needed a quick appetizer and happened to have all these ingredients. Everyone really liked this. I served with raw veggies but would also be good with pretzels, chips or toasted baguettes. Will make again for sure.

I didn't have any chili, worcestershire, OR green onion, and we were kinda drunk, but it came out DELICIOUS :) Dipped our pizza crusts in it all night and used the rest on bagels this afternoon. Good base ingredients- fail proof.

This was surprisingly good. To be honest, I read the list of ingredients and thought, "that sounds disgusting." Based on the reviews and the fact that I had a ton of dill in my fridge, I made it anyway. It really came out tasty. I served it with pretzels and vegetables for dipping.

We loved this. We had it with pan fried cod. We used the hot Thai style chili sauce.

Oof. Think I messed around with this one a little too much, so I didn't care for it. I know it's a great recipe, but I flubbed it by underestimating the strength of my garlic, which overwhelmed the dip, and using a unsuitable chili sauce, which added a weird sweetness (can you say high-fructose corn syrup?). Plus, I quadrupled the batch to take to work, and I think my recalculations may've been off. Oh, and I used full-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, since that was what I had on hand. Despite my mistakes, I'll definitely make it again -- and to the letter next time, so I understand the template when I want to start putting my own touches on it.

Love it! The best dill dip ever!

LOVED this, huge hit at my party. Served w/crudite and pita chips. Also increased the (asian) chili sauce by about 1/4. Fresh tasting, with a bite!

I made this for a Christmas party & it was a hit! I used an asian garlic chili sauce that gave it a great kick. I will make this again & again. You won't be sorry trying this one. Enjoy.

Because this dip can be assembled in a few minutes with ingredients most cooks have on hand, I give it three forks. The Sun-dried Tomato Torta and Tapenade on this site are much classier and more delicious appetizers, but if one needs several appetizers and does not want a cream-cheese based dip, this is a great choice.

Made this dip for a party and it was great! Everyone ate it up and there was none left at the end of the evening. I doubled the recipe, though, at the advice of others. Served in a bread bowl with veggies on the side. It was wonderful.

Very good and easy peasy! Great with vegetables.

This does make a small amount, probably enough for a 6-8 person crudite tray. For a larger party, I'd double it. The flavors are a spectacular combination in this dish....and it's easy to make!

I made this dip for a cocktail party and many guests commented on how tasty it was. Definitely make the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors come together.

I took this to a tailgate party along with another dip. I got rave reviews on this one, while the other was only so-so. In fact, I had more than doubled the recipe (at the suggestion of another reviewer) and we had some leftovers. As I was leaving the home of the friend with whom I was staying, I was just going to throw out the leftover dips and take my bowls home. "No, no," he said, "don't throw it away! You can put it in a container and leave it here. I'll eat the rest!" The other dip, wasn't so lucky and ended up in the garbage. I also agree that it would be fantastic on seafood. I added some hot sauce and a little bit of fresh grated parmesian cheese.

Very good! Recipe makes too little... I would recommend doubling it. Also... I didn't have green onions or chili sauce, so I substituted chives and roasted red chili paste (to taste). It turned out delicious!

I think I've found a new standard raw veggie dip...Did add a generous squirt of spicy mustard and a dash of tabasco, gave it just a little zing without overdoing it. Excellent, and definitely better the next day.

This dip is excellent. I brought this to a party of 25 and all want the recipe. I have made this numerous times. it is easy and reliable. For the chili sauce, I used a spicier one-Sriracha hot chili sauce-can be found in Asian Food markets.

This interested me more as a fish sauce than a dip, so I made it to top off my catfish, then tasted it with "dip" in mind. Both were fantastic. For the fish sauce I added a little lemon juice and horseradish, but when using it as a dip, I'll leave it exactly as is.

MMMMMMmmmmmmm! Super dip for serving with chips, for more zip try adding hot sauce. Yum!

I served this with smoked salmon and small toasts as well as raw vegetables. We all loved it. I'm looking forward to serving this as a sauce to accompany barbaqued salmon. Yum!

I made this dip for a friend's party. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it (we love spicy food), but it was not received as well at the party (I believe there were some very timid eaters there). However, we did not get any leftovers back (which was unfortunate). I would make this again, especially to serve as a sauce with fish.

I used this dip with smoked salmon and dark pumpernickel bread at a 25th Wedding Aniversary Party. It got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe

Easy and delicious. I added more Chili Sauce to give it more of a kick. My husband, who says he's that crazy about dill, couldn't get enough.
