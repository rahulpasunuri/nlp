The salmon came out beautifully - the specifications for cooking time are absolutely perfect. I was skeptical about the orange zest, but it turned out to be the key ingredient and I will use more of it next time. Also, I omitted the fennel and used a variety of other fresh herbs that I had on hand and it still turned out great.

This was very easy, the fish cooked perfectly, and it looked beautiful on the plate, BUT the taste of the fennel seed was too overwhelming for me. I barely tasted the rosemary. I will use this technique again, but not these ingredients!

This was really, really good. My 9 year old daughter and 7 year old son loved it! They actually ate the salmon before the rice for once. I was told by a "chef" friend that the key to getting better flavor is to properly zest the orange. If you take too much of the pith off the orange oils will not integrate as they should. I marinated the salmon for 1/2 hour, covered loosely in saran wrap. If you prefer more flavor I would definitely marinate longer.

Deliciously full of flavor but I found it a bit dry even though I drizzled the olive-oil from the pan over the salmon before it went into the oven. Next time I will serve it with a cream sauce.

Tried this on Copper River salmon and it was GREAT! Used: 1 Tbsp Tang orange drink powder, 1/4 tsp whole cloves, 1 tsp yellow curry powder, 1 tsp powdered nutmeg, and a dash of powdered ginger. Unskinned & cooked in canola oil as per directions. PERFECT!

Excellent recipe. I left the rub on for about 4 hours and it had an excellent flavor. This is a very quick and easy recipe. Served with some steamed fresh veggies it can't be beat. I used the first rub mix with the fennel seed and rosemary. I ground the fennel and rosemary together in a spice grinder. I highly recommend this and will make it again.

I used the coriander, cloves, cumin and nutmeg version, and followed the directions exactly. It was wonderful! Important to get the heat high enough to sear the fish.

Too easy and too good. We made the first mix with the fennel seed. Tender, cooked to perfection and fab tase. Next time it's the pepitos!!

Went to visit Dad, and surprise! He'd invited guests. Oh yeah, and he doesn't cook. So it was Epicurious to the rescue (once again). I made a rub with fresh marjoram, orange peel, a bit of coriander seed, and a smidge of cinnamon, and the recipe turned out wonderfully. The salmon was pronounced "cooked to perfection" (and I'm not the greatest fish cook); even the leftovers won praise a few days later. Definitely will try the fennel rub in the future.

Made this for a girls' night out cooking night and everyone was a good cook. Everyone loved it and all want the recipe. Easy and bursting with citrus flavor; the fennel really adds an interesting touch -- not your everyday salmon.

This was simple, fast and delicious. I used the regular spice rub and loved it. I will definitely make it again. I didn't have any fresh rosemary and so just used less of the dry and it worked.

For the ease and quickness, fantastic. I made the original rub with dried rosemary and substituted lemon zest for orange--however, I didn't have enough zest, so I also added a little lemon juice and lemon curd, which made a paste, and added a leek I had lying around. Let it set for 15 min--longer may have made the flavor richer. The crust formed nicely and the fish came out flaky and moist.

My clients just love this. Always gets rave reviews, and so easy and simple.

Good and easy. I made the regular recipe and the "Minimal Effort Spice-Rubbed" one. I preferred the flavors of the regular recipe, though the other was just fine.

My husband and I love this recipe! We have used the spice rub on Trout and Walleye, as well as Salmon, with excellent results. It has become our new favorite for fish!

Excellent! I used the curry,lemon zest and parsely blend on salmon steaks. They turned out flavorful and yummy! I would try the other combinations.

Easy, delicious, and uses ingredients on hand. I did the spice rub with coriander, cumin, cloves, and a bit of ginger. I added chopped pine nuts - I happened to have a bunch on hand - which gave it a nice crunch. The family loved it - even my kids!

I am not a big salmon fan but this recipe was incredible. I used sunflower seeds and bunch of spices in my cupboard. I also used a great sauce from another recipe. the basic sauce recipe is 1/2 cup butter, 3 TBS balsamic vinegar, 1 TBS honey, 1 TBS dijon mustard. Adjust as necessary for amount of fish. It is wonderful!

I tried the spice rub under "Minimal Effort", and true to there word, it was very easy to make. Perhaps it's just the Texan I've aquired, but this didn't have the kick that I expected the spices to have. Next time I would try some red pepper with the spices. That is always a solution for food in Texas! If you like blander food, though, it is really good. I would try this.

I subbed peppercorns for the porcini and used non salted sunflower seeds and ground them together to a coarse consistency. I lightly coated the fillets and let dry somewhat then sauteed them in a very hot cast iron pan with canola/olive oil blend with a little butter. The salmon has an astoundingly good affinity to the browned seeds and I suspect trout to be the same. Spring this one on someone who dislikes salmon and you may convert them.
