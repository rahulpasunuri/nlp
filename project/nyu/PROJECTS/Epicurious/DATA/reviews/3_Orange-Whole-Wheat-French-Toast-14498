I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe, while okay- tasting, is a far cry from a notable one... I even added zest from one orange, and the orange flavor was still less-than distinctive. Honestly, it was just a bit blah. If you're looking for a great way to orange-up your french toast, I might recommend using your favorite traditional french toast recipe and serving it with this Orange Syrup I make, which is both easy and delicious: Orange Syrup: 1 Cup firmly packed brown sugar 1/2 Cup orange juice 2 Tablespoons grated orange peel * Simmer ingredients in small saucepan for 5 min before serving warm

I am normally a big fan of orange french toast (my favorite dish of all time), but this recipe is lacking something. I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted a little bit bitter and it didn't smell good when I was cooking it. If you want a real WOW recipe for french toast, search for "Texas-Style French Toast" on this website.

Wow! I used cointreau instead of marnier. i also picked fresh oranges from my tree and they have a lot of flavor. i thought it might need some orange zest, but it didn't. i was surprised vanilla wasn't in the recipe, but it doesn't need it. i love this recipe for when i want to use a fiber-filled heavier whole wheat and grain bread. The cooked bananas sounds like a good idea too!

I love this! I make it every time we have house guests & it's a hit. I substitute orange extract for the Grand Marnie and the flavor is very rich.

Eh. Perhaps a waste of Grand Marnier! Despite following the recipe to a tee, not too much orange flavor. Maybe soaking the bread for 30 minutes or more would help increase the flavor

Looking for the best French toast recipe in town? This is the one. Not too sweet with a marvelous chewy/fluffy texture that can't be achieved with white breads. You have to buy an unsliced loaf of dense, hearty wheat bread from a bakery and cut it yourself into inch-thick slices. Pepperidge Farm and some other supermarket brands make nice wheat breads, but those thin slices just don't work here. I usually make this the night before I serve it, slicing the bread as I prepare dinner and letting it get a little stale through the evening on the countertop. Before bed I lightly butter both sides of the bread slices, lay the bread in an 11 x 13 baking dish, pour the egg mixture over it, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. The next morning I just toss it into the oven preheated to 425 degrees and bake it for twenty or thirty minutes, until it is puffed and golden. Sauteed bananas on top, or a chiffonade of orange, take the dish to heavenly heights.

I'm so surprised that this recipe has been around for so long and only two people have reviewed it. I don't often make french toast, but this one is fantastic. The whole wheat bread brings a heartiness and "heft" that's very filling and satisfying on a chilly Saturday morning. The orange flavoring comes through, although I think I will try adding a little zest to the batter next time. I used a pretty dense whole wheat bread and didn't have any problems with sogginess, but the advice on using day old is probably worth heeding. I will be making this often and wholewheatedly recommend it. (Sorry, couldn't resist!)

I've made this recipe twice now and my girlfriend and I both love it! It depends a great deal on the kind of bread you use. Day old bread I think IS definitely a good idea - otherwise it soaks up way too much of the batter and becomes very soggy. I also found that cooked bananas make a great complement to this dish.

I was looking for something "new" for french toast and this fit the bill. The liquor kicked up the price to make this, but it was worth it. I made the batter the night before and everyone asked for more. Best made with day old wheat bread, fresh is just too soggy.
