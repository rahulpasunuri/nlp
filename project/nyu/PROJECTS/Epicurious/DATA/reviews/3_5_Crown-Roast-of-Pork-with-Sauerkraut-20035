I make something similar to this recipe. In a cooking bag I combine a pork loin roast, some sauerkraut (however much you need), an apple and an onion diced up, 1 small can of pineapple juice, salt, pepper and some Worcestershire sauce. I season the roast with salt, pepper and some ground sage. This is really easy and tasty meal.

Basically this is just your standard German pork and kraut with a spectacular presentation for a special occasion. The kraut could do with more pork flavor infusion, say, deglazing and pouring the juices of the baked crown roast over it.

I was a bit skeptical to try this dish because nobody here had yet rated it, but it is actually very good and quite easy to prepare. Guests were quite impressed, and it is certainly a change of pace from most of the other pork dishes that I have prepared for company. I would certainly recommend trying this.
