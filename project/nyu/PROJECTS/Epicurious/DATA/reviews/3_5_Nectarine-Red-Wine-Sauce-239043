Made this today and served with the vanilla ice cream and orange sorbet, sprinkling on the chopped crystalized ginger........WOW what a great, refreshing desert. Sure glad to have some left over for tomorrow! Will certainly make this often.

Yummy! We used lemon peel only (no oranges in the house) and it was lovely over premium vanilla ice cream.
