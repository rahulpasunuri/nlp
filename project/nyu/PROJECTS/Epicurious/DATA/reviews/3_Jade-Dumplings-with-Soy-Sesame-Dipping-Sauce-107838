I made these with chinese broccoli and bamboo shoots in place of asparagus and water chestnuts, and they turned out delicious and verdant. Any combination of fresh vegetables will work here for a light and tasty dumpling.

Absolutely delicious! We ended up with extra filling, so we experimented and mixed in a half-pound of ground pork. With that we made jade "meatballs" and baked them sans wonton wrappers for a low-carb option. Fabulous! And we loved the dipping sauce, we used low-salt soy sauce and it was perfect. Will definitely make this a regular recipe!

okay, listen people... of course the sauce is salty! it's SOY SAUCE! soy sauce is salty. what did you expect from a sauce that's 1/3 cup soy sauce? also, of course the wrapper isn't flavorful. that's just a holder. you dip it in the sauce and enjoy the wonderful mix of flavors.

My little sister is a vegan, so this was a wonderful appetizer for the whole family to enjoy for our mother's day dinner. The wonton itself doesn't have a ton of flavor, but that is what the dipping sauce is for.

I would not make this recipe again as written. The dumplings were bland and the dipping sauce was way too salty and sour and it did not do a thing for the dumplings. With addition of mushrooms and cilantro to the dumplings it was a 2 forker, but the sauce was still not tasty

steamed jicama with the aspargus, was pretty good but I've made far more delicious dumplings using shrimp and pork. Always on the lookout for a good veggie dumpling, if anyone has any suggestions....

Loved the dumplings but thought the dipping sauce was just horrible. Maybe the dipping sauce would be better with seasoned rice vinegar or with a little ginger added. All I know is that it needed something...anything...

I added a little leftover cooked duck and red pepper flakes. LOVED THEM! Will definitely make my 'heavy rotation' recipe file.

I have altered this recipe and had much greater success. I lightly cook the asparagus until its tender crisp, maybe 3 minutes. Then after mincing up the cooked asparagus and other ingredients in the food processor, I put a small spoonful in the middle of the wonton wrapper. Basically I use water to wet the corners and then fold the wrapper in half, "pasting" the corners together. So they come out as triangles. Then I fry the wontons in a combination of canola & sesame oils, until they are golden brown. They come out crispy and very tasty. Its a great alternative to a meat filled wonton.

Good recipe, but I agree with the others that it needed a little more zing, so I added some cayenne and some more garlic. My friends are also major carnivores so I added some spicy ground pork to the mix and it was a hit. Three friends took the recipe home.

I have made these dumplings several times and everyone has raved about them. I add mushrooms and not so much asparagus. I also make a spicy peanut sauce and mix it all together for some fantastic"hunan dumplings".

What a great vegetarian recipe. A little spice would be nice in the asparagus mixture. Easy to think of all sorts of fillings for this. Give it a try!!

I took these to a Chinese potluck and everyone loved them. If you make them in advance and refrigerate them, be sure to sprinkle lots of flour on the pan - otherwise they stick and you'll end up losing several when trying to pick them up to steam.

The filling could use a little kick as previously mentioned, but stands up as is to the delicious dipping sauce. My wontons came with wrapping instructions that differ a little: place filling in center and fold one corner over to opposite side making a triangle. Fold the 2 corners on the long edge up (like a smile, not over the dumpling). This method was much easier and significantly less frustrating.

Had absolutely no problems with these dumplings. I made them for a party and got huge raves.

The filling is fantastic, but might add some hot pepper to give it a kick. I used the larger square wonton wrappers for a meal and fit about 1.5 Tbs in them. I sealed by bringing 2 opposite corners together first then overlapped the other 2, it worked! def. use the lettuce, my wontons got stuck on the strainer. great sauce!

I had a terrible time getting the filling to fit into the wontons. I had to use way less than was recommended. I also had a problem with the wontons staying together. The filling really is very nice. The dipping sauce made more than enough. It was a bit wasteful to use that much soy sauce.

I made this dish and it was delicious but be careful with the dumplings falling apart. I made the dumplings again with salmon flaked into the filling and it was great!
