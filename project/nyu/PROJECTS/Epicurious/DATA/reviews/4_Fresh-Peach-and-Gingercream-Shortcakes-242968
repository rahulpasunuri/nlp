This was absolutely fantastic, but I definitely made some alterations based on other people's reviews. I put some cinnamon, ground ginger, and nutmeg in with the biscuit dough, which was wonderful. I did not put ANY sugar in with the peaches, but I did add some peach shnapps (which is sweet anyway). I didn't put any chopped ginger with the biscuit, and only put a little bit with the peaches. So I guess mine had more of a peach/peach schnapps/cinnamon flavor rather than ginger. Anyway, great recipe and very easy!!! When it says "total time: 1 hour" that really includes clean up also. :) Oh ps - I'm visiting my parents down south, and they have the BEST peaches of all time!

There are a few changes I did. First, take the dough a place it in a floured measuring cup-1/4 cup works well. Turn it out on your baking sheet. All biscuits are the same size and the dough doesn't toughen from over handling. After biscuits are baked, cut a small circle off top rather than splitting the biscuit in half. Add peach schnops to the wipping cream. Place peaches over cut biscuit, than a dollop of cream. Place the small circle of biscuit perpendicular to the main biscuit. To add extra design presentation, use a long sprig of Rosemary in front of the small disc of biscuit and add a few fresh blueberries. I have made this twice and the second time did not add the Ginger to the biscuit and liked it better. Only added Ginger to the fruit. My guests cleaned their plates!

This is excellent, however, next time I will do the following alterations. No Ginger in the shortbread. I will add a hint of cinnamon to the short bread and fruit. Liked adding peach schnapps to the whipped cream. Made a beautiful presentation by first splitting horizontally, however, do not split evenly. Take about a two inch circle off the top. Put large biscuit on plate, next spoon fruit and whipped cream. Place the two inch biscuit in whipped cream vertically. Place a few berries of your choice, (I used blue) and a sprig of lavender or Rosemary vertically in front of the vertical biscuit. My guests said the dessert was as good as good as restaurant. Not a morsel was left on their plates! Hint: Instead of rolling out dough and cutting, scoop dough into floured measuring cup. (1/4 cup) The biscuits turn out the exact same size and gave a professional look to the plate.

Oh, oh...oh, my! This was absolutely divine. You can't ask for a more enticing combination of flavors, aromas and textures. Once you've assembled them, pop a little more whipped cream on top, garnish with a slice of peach, a raspberry and a spoonful of juice from your bowl of peaches.

Yummy. I agree with others about making the biscuits smaller. I used unsalted butter and added a scant 1/2 t of salt.

These were delicious and received rave reviews from guests tonight. However, I was disappointed in the appearance; they do not make a high shortcake. I made a second batch b/c I thought I had made some mistake with the first when they spread out rather than rising high. I would have thought the tablespoon of baking powder would produce a higher product, and no, my baking powder is not old.

Oh, this is FABULOUS! Don't skimp on the crystalized ginger, as the ginger flavor goes very well with the peaches. I macerated the peaches before making the dough, so they had some more time to release their juices. Try adding a small splash of brandy into the peaches - YUM! I will never make plain peach shortcake again - I will ALWAYS use this recipe.

Very refreshing with a hint of ginger. Sizeable portions. Recommend making eight biscuits rather than six. Absolutely delicious!

Very refreshing with the hint of ginger. Portions were sizable; recommend making 8 smaller biscuits rather than 7. Will make again. Easy.
