We cancelled our Super Bowl party (Saints vs Colts) last weekend because of a blizzard. Our guests reassembled this weekend for a Mardi Gras and Valentine's Day dinner. This was a hit and an elegant success served in a heart shaped mold. Geaux victorious Saints!

This was a hit! I made a quick béchamel instead of adding the cream soup and added a tablespoon of the Better Than Broth  in the sauce because I didnt have the Creole seasoning. I only used half the butter to sauté the onion bell pepper mixture and the rest for the béchamel. I used all shrimp, Ill try crab next time. I made this for a Halloween party and put it in a hand shaped mold. Its the perfect flesh color. But its a very pretty dish (when not formed to look like a severed body part). Ill make this again!

I've made something like this but this is so much Better!!! For some reason, molded dishes like this seem to have faded in the past, but this is delicious. Will make it again!

Good party dish! To Julo: Liquid crab boil is a seasoning that's used to boil crabs, crawfish and other seafoods. It also comes in powder form. It's basically a potent, delicious bunch of spices and oils that gives the seafood a great flavor. The best brand to use is Zatarain's, a Louisiana company. Look for it at your seafood market. If they don't have it there, try: http://www.totallynawlins.com/zatcrabboil.html

What is liquid crab boil? Can I use simmered shrimp shells with celery, onion and carrot in its place?
