Had great results with these changes: 1) Fresh tomatoes 2) Doubled the garlic 3) Covered the mushrooms with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh thyme and fresh oregano mixture and broiled them for about 5 min on each side before stuffing instead of sauteeing 4) After stuffing, sprinkled a tbsp of asiago cheese and put back in the broiler for a couple minutes Yum! Great weekend lunch.

Used extra garlic, parsley, sage and freshly grated parma. as other reviewers suggested -- so/so. Nothing special.

Like others, I added grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs at the end. Used fresh tomatoes and a dried herb mix instead of fresh sage. My friends said "delish!" I would make again, I think it would be better with fresh herbs.

These mushrooms are wonderful!! The only changes I made were...MORE garlic, 5 cloves and instead of sprinkling bread crumbs on top, I used a bit of parmesean cheese. YUM!

We served this recently when a vegetarian friend visited, and although noone raved, it was pretty good. I had no fresh tomatoes on hand so used three canned plum tomatoes (they had a little sauce too). I think the wine makes a big difference (it does to most cooking, right?!). The mushrooms held up pretty well too.

Great and easy Recipe. This is going into my frequently used box. To add a little more flavor I added a dash of salt and pepper, I also topped the stuffed mushrooms with sliced monterey jack cheese and browned in the oven. It gave the entree a little more weight and made the meal more scrumtious.

This recipe exceeded my expectations. It was really delicious, easy, and a nice winter, mid-week meal. There is a lot more flavor in this dish than you would expect.

These sucked. They were completely bland and needed a kick, what I don't know though. Would definitely NOT make these again, they were a waste of time!

This was easy and delicious. I used fresh thyme and parsley (what I have growing) instead of the sage. I used 1 can of "petite cut" tomatoes with garlic and olive oil instead of chopping the 3 tomatoes. Brushed bread with olive oil and toasted it, then crumbled. Served over "Grits with Goat Cheese and Chives" from this web site. Yummy. We had it as a main course but with smaller mushrooms (or maybe sliced with the filling spooned over?) it would make an impressive first course.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I used red wine instead of white, and I thought the flavor was bolder. The mushrooms went flat and didn't hold the stuffing well; next time I might try baking them first as others suggested. Great!

This recipe lacks somthing. They were just so, so. I served this as a starter course, if I make them again I may serve with a creamy parmesan or a fresh pesto sauce to add a little flavor. Some ripe tomatoes, instead of canned too.

This made a good vegetarian main course. I mixed some grated parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs, and put it under the broiler topped with mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

First I'll admit my mistake which was to stuff the mushrooms before cooking them gills side down. Naturally, most of the filling fell out! Next time though, and there will be a next time, I think I'll bake them, and possibly broil for a minute to crisp up the tops. As did other reviewers, I added some grated Parmesan to the tops before adding the crispy breadcrumbs. My own touch was to put a few drops of white truffle oil atop each mushroom. Yummy! I doubled the sage, and there was still no hint of it with all the other strong flavors - maybe a few other fresh herbs would be nice along with the sage.

Love veggie recipes and this is a good one! Made some variations, used storebought all natural garlic & butter croutons, used fresh oregano instead of sage, also used fresh garden tomato and vidalia onions. Omit any salt, instead used fresh parmesan when mixing the warm saute part of the dish with the croutons. Also made it one time with fresh avocado and cilanto for an herb. I have made it for my family and friends and it was a big hit...did take longer to make than 30 min but well worth the wait!

I used chopped garlic from the jar, so I doubled the amount. I also added more wine to the recipe and it came out great!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I added fresh grated parmesan to the bread crumbs, as well as tomato sauce at the end. I also threw in some extra spices that I had on hand. It made a great main dish that I will serve again.

I marinated the mushrooms in a good olive oil and balsamic vinegar for about an hour prior to cooking. I also used fresh tomato and substituted crushed large cut garlic croutons as the breadcrumbs. I also added freshly grated parmesan to the stuffing and on top. This made a very flavorful and satisfying main course. I'll be serving this again!

I found the flavor a little flat. My husband said too much sage, I think there should be more. It's missing something. I think I'll make it again today and experiment with some additional fresh herbs & spices.

Didn't love it. Probably waivered too much from the original recipe by following one reviewer's suggestion of substituting Vermouth for the wine. I would reduce the amount of bread crumbs.

Great flavor! I doubled the amount of sage and also sprinkled fresh parm before serving.

Great recipe -- quick, easy, and delicious! I too used vermouth in place of the white wine. I didn't have fresh sage on hand so I used the dry variety which worked out fine. Also, I topped the mushrooms with freshly grated parmesan before serving. Yum!

This is a GREAT recipe. Definitely will make it again. I used Vermouth in place of the wine.
