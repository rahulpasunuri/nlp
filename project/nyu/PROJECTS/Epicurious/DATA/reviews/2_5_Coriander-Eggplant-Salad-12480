I've been looking for an eggplant salad recipe that is similar to the one they serve in Moroccan restaurants and this sounded like it might be close. The low rating was a bit discouraging, but there were only 2 reviews. I used all the ingredients except fennel seeds, ginger and paprika, because I don't remember those flavors being in the Moroccan salad. I roasted 2 large eggplants with a whole garlic bulb in the oven, and chopped 4 plum tomatoes without peeling & seeding them. My family really liked it and said it tasted like the Moroccan salad.

This was not the best eggplant salad I've ever had. It sounds a lot better than it actually is. The lemon took away from the eggplant taste. It's not terrible but I'm not making it again.

This dish was fine- but didn't have the bite that I thought it would have. It might have been better with more lemon juice and ginger. It did make a delicious roll-up/sandwich with some goat chesse and arugula.
