A bit tangy but very good.

This was horrible. All I could taste was the ketchup. I threw almost all of it away because of how gross it was.

I have made several batches of this. I buy a huge commercial container of Heinz Ketchup and quadruple the recipe. I save large jars and gift 2 or 3 to friends and save the remainder for myself. This will keep several months if it lasts that long.

This is a great recipe. I used hot paprika and half ketchup and half chili sauce. The chili sauce and great flavour to the finished sauce.

As others said...its great and easy..also used hot paprika and maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Solar cooking chicken breasts in this sauce today. Made a half recipie..worked fine.

I made this as written (but sub agave syrup for the corn) & felt that the end result was a good, sweet & tangy BBQ sauce. But it also tasted like glorified ketchup w/o enough complexity. So I added chipotle powder & smoked Spanish paprika for heat, a dash of ground cloves, a few T of Dijon mustard & boiled it down more, which deepened the flavor. Next time, I plan to omit the white sugar & to use molasses in place of the corn syrup.

A superb balanced sauce, basically a sweet sauce but with some acidity. Also totally easy to make. I used hot paprika for a little extra heat, the Neelys don't specify and it's probably intentional.
