Outstanding sauce. Used a 12oz can of crushed tomatoes. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. Served on polenta with haricots verts/roasted fennel and shallots.

The sauce was to die for, but the meat was bland on its own.

I made this dish when it first appeared in Bon Appetit. I was impressed by how delicious yet simple it was to prepare. It has since become one of the recipes I turn to when I'm preparing a meal for special friends.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight for the first time and LOVED it! So flavorful. I used a frozen roast, which took the rub just fine last night and then cooked in the slow cooker all day today. It turned out great. I also did not have marjoram and used oregano instead. I also added a can of small white beans, which added wonderful texture. I will definitely make this again.

Easy to make and a delicious final product. Guests loved it. However, it is a little too dry for my tastes.

I followed the recipe exactly and cannot understand why other reviewers liked it so much. The sauce is not really that great. Comparatively, I think the prep is a lot of trouble, and could probably be made a bit simpler. I do not know whether I will make this again, but if I do, I would slow-cook it and use a different cut of pork - some kind that's intended to be slow-simmered.

I have made this recipe numerous times, and after the first time started using Pork Sirloin Roast and have found it to be very flavorful, I also add more peppers and onions and use oregano instead of marjoram. Sauted polenta is a great side dish. And, the leftovers freeze well.

I followed this to aT, well reduced proportions as I had less meat, and was really looking forward to it after seeing so many rave reviews. But instead I found it ordinary, kind of boring, did not like the consistancy of the sauce. Will return to my easy slow cooker with beer, and few peppercorns, always mustard and garlic. So easy and so much more fun.

This is a fabulous recipe. I made without changes the first time. Now I substitute the tomatoes with 2 cups marinara sauce. Wow, it is so good. It reminds me of a catcatorie sauce. I serve with polenta. I also use a larger roast ~ approx 3 1/2 #'s for the two of us. We want the leftovers!

This will be my second time making this recipe in less than a week! The sauce is hearty and delicious. No changes are needed (though I substituted dried oregano for the marjoram since that was what I had).

5 Forks +++++ I have made this recipe sooooo many times. I have made it for intimate dinners and large social gatherings of up to 60 people. Never have I been disappointed and neither have my guests. This one will stay in my reservoir of favorite recipes forever!

Very easy and very delicious! I think you could use just about any meat with this.

I didn't have time to do the rub. So I put all of the ingredients in my slow cooker after browning the meat and vegatables. I substituted chicken stock and also added some dried white beans and cooked on low for about 7 hours. It was great. I plan to take another reader's suggestion and puree the leftover sauce for use on pasta.

I don't know how such a simple recipe can be so extraordinary, but we absolutely loved this! We used a local organic pork loin. I forgot about marinating it with the rub in advance, so I stabbed it all over with a small knife to help the flavors penetrate and let it sit while I cut and chopped the veggies. Once it was cooked, I took the pork out and cut it up into stew chunks, then put it back and let it bake for another half hour or so. We couldn't get over how good it was. I'm going to try this recipe with chicken next--I think that would be wonderful, too.

Wonderful recipe-- 4+ forks! I used nearly a 3 pound pork loin roast and served six people...there were no leftovers! I used fresh marjoram and vidalia onions; I don't like canned beef broth, so I used the low-sodium kind from a carton, plus a whole can of crushed tomatoes. I served it with steamed gingered carrots and fresh apple/strawberry sauce with a touch of allspice...what a hit! I'll definitely make this again.

5 forks - This is a delicious recipe - I made it for 14 and then 32! Easy to multiply for a crowd. You can make ahead up to searing the meat and then put aside for roasting. I added mushrooms to veggies and you don't need to multiply the sauce as many times as the meat. Just wonderful recipe any time of year.

4 forks plus - This is absolutely delicious! I made for 14 and then made again for 32! Its so easy - do ahead up to where you sear the meat then put aside for roasting. I added sliced mushrooms to veggies and when you multiply recipe you don't need to multiply the sauce. Just dump the large can of ground tomatoes in (with wine, etc). I served with noodles and is wonderful as left- overs. An all-year recipe to enjoy.

I have made this recipe (multiplied of course) for as many as 60 people for an Anniversary reception. What a beautiful presentation! Delicious served on top creamy mashed potatoes. Great for ANY special occasion.

I was going to add mushrooms as recommended in the reviews, but then I forgot. When the pork finished cooking, the peppers looked so limp and body-less that I thought they would be nasty to eat. So I pulled out the pork, boiled the sauce down by almost half, and used an immersion blender to puree the remainder. I cannot recommend this enough! The pork was spectacularly tender, and the sauce was superb. I served it all over buttered egg noodles, and my guests devoured it. Next time, I'll probably add the mushrooms, but I'm not sure if I'll puree them as well, or saute them separately and add them after pureeing during further reduction.

I really LOVED this dish and I served it with carmelized acorn squash in their half shell. I made basmati with beef broth to go with the sauce. Didnt have marjaram so I used basil. It was definately a dish my son and husband wants repeated.

Excellent recipe, although a bit salty - Next time I will use low-sodium beef broth. The meat was tender and flavorful, and polenta served as the perfect side dish to the meat and sauce. Enjoy!

I added some mushrooms to this with the red peppers, and it was excellent. The do-ahead version made it a delight to serve to my guests, who had seconds (and thirds). I served it with egg noodles, veg, and salad.

THIS is why we love to cook at home: an inexpensive cut of meat, a little effort and voila, a delicious meal for the table. With the exception of substituting leftover red wine which happened to be in the frig, I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce didn't want to cook down so I added about a tablespoon of flour to thicken a smidgen. At first I was only mildly impressed with the dish but the taste really grew on me. I'm guessing it's even better if made ahead and the flavors allowed to set. This is certain to become a regular at our house.

I thought this dish was easy and delicious, and my husband raved. Even my little ones loved the sauce. I used both red and green peppers. I think I'll just cook it on the stove next time. Good enough to serve to company!

Added a little extra allspice, and all loved the flavor. I'd like to try this with pork tenderloin as well. Excellent!

Have been making this since 1992. Great do ahead for company and always a perfect dish. Thanks....

I changed this a bit. I added capers and a bit of juice after sauteeing the onions. That added a really nice touch. I also added some cream to the sauce and let it reduce. Very tasty.

I prepared this on the stove as a pot roast. It is very good although, be careful not to overdue it on the rub as it can be too salty. Also, I omitted the red peppers and used potatoes and squash. I'll definitely make this again!

This was very easy and very good. I made it for our family Valentine's Day dinner and we couldn't get enough, even my 7 year old loved it. I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and served it on the side, I wasn't sure if my kids would like the sauce, but they did. The meat was tasty and moist.

I've made this dish many, many times, and always get rave reviews. I've found that I like to just roast the boneless pork loin in the oven and do the sauce on top of the stove. I usually double the sauce and then reduce it down. You need good bread to soak up all the wonderful juices! It's even better cooked a couple days in advance!!

I've made this dish several times and loved it each time. The rub is definitely the key to the dish's success! The roast and sauce seems to get better with time.

I have made this recipe twice and it was excellent each time. I used pork chops the first time and it worked out okay. Second time I used a center cut roast with bone in. It just took a little longer to cook.
