This was a delicious and easy cranberry sauce! As a leftover variation, I drained some of the liquid and added 4 chopped apples to the cranberry/pear mixture. I put it all into a pie crust and made a crumble topping with walnuts. Just took it out of the oven and it looks and smells AMAZING! I would definitely make this again for another holiday.

I am not a fan of sweet cranberry sauce and hate the canned stuff but this slightly tart and interestingly spiced sauce is so good! My husband hates cranberry sauce and actually liked this! Made a double batch so I can use the rest as a ready to go holiday desert- excited to try this over ice cream or greek yogurt!

I went back to make this again, and thought, gee, I haven't rated it, I'll do it now, only to notice that I had given it 3 forks last month--but I've got to revise my rating, and make it four. Boy, is this good with Greek yogurt--as breakfast, dessert, a snack . . . .

I'd been making the same cranberry relish for years and wanted a change. I loved this. I chose it because it uses less sugar than the typical cranberry sauce, and because I love cardamon. I was tempted to cut back on the five-spice powder because of what others said, but I did not, and I'm glad I didn't--it adds a lovely depth, which complements the slight tartness. The three-fork rating, I feel compelled to remind people, means "delicious"--not "lacking in something." I'm tempted to give this four because of a general grade inflation, but I'm holding out.

Okay, not a big fan of cranberry sauce in any form but this was fabulous. I mean, really good. It only got better as days went by. I did cut back on the 5 spice for my kids. I am making a second batch now. I'm going to add it to my granny smith apple pie and then freeze the rest for Christmas.

I make this every year and it is always a hit. I followed an early reviewer's advice and increased the spices. Always a crowd pleaser and many have asked for the recipe. My favorite cranberry sauce, without a doubt.

I highly recommend this recipe. It is easy to make and extremely flavorful. I continue to make this cranberry sauce year after year because everyone who has tried it just loves it.

I never make cranberry sauce because it never gets eaten and it's just not my favorite (nor anyone else I know either, apparently!) however I made this and it is beyond any words, the best cranberry sauce I've ever tried. It's spicy and a little sweet, still tart and just wonderful. I cannot wait to spread it on turkey sandwiches. I highly recommend this and yes, I would definitely make it again, with no changes.

I've made this 3 years in a row now and everyone always loves it. By far the best cranberries we've ever had! I keep the spice level the same, but found the original recipe too tart and have doubled the sugar the last two years. Always get rave reviews! Highly recommend it for those who like a lot of flavor in a dish.

I've made this almost every year since the date it was first published...easy and everyone loves it. And let's face it, cardamom and chinese five spice powder aren't flavors you encounter every day.

The only cranberry sauce I will make. Don't change a thing! The flavors of this are perfection! What a delightful relief from corn-syrup drenched metalic-flavored canned sauce!!!

This is a great cranberry sauce recipe. My brother-in-law has been making it for several years, I just made it for the first time myself. And he's right it's EASY and sooo delicious and un-ordinary (I love the pears & cardamom!)

Have used this recipe for three years, cutting back on the five spice. It's always a welcome change from other sauces and the kitchen smells fabulous.

I think you really have to like the taste of the chinese five spice powder that's in this recipe. Obviously, I don't therefore I didn't care for the taste of the recipe. Definitely a love or hate flavor.

I made two batches of this, and both were a major hit at a Thanksgiving filled with Gourmands. The first I made exactly as the recipe said. When my husband tried it he thought it was too tart and spicy for him. I then made a second batch for the folks who like it sweeter and milder. On the seconed batch I doubled the sugar, and made it with half cranberry juice, half apple juice. It cut the spices in half and added some minced candied ginger. This cut down on the typical cranberry tartness that many don't like. The group was fairly evenly split about which one they liked best, some liked the bolder one, some the sweeter milder one. However the hands down favorite was the batch of Grand Marnier Cranberry Sauce that I made from a recipe on the site. See my comments there.

loved the pears and the cardamom, might cut a little bit of the five spice next time-- the aftertaste was a little too strong, but overall the flavor was unique and yummy, others agreed. and so easy to make-- why anyone uses canned sauce i have no idea.

Delicious! Several guests declared this the best cranberry sauce they'd ever had. The spices make for a delightfully unusual flavor. Don't worry, though--it's not TOO unusual or overpowering.

Rating: 3
My guests and I all thought this was perfect. It is not overly sweet, that is for sure; it has just the right amount of tangy flavor. The spices make it just right. The pears add flavor and also make it look great. A great change from the norm.

Tried this at a "practice" pre-Thanksgiving dinner where guests were encouraged to bring new variations on classic Thanksgiving dishes -- recipes they'd never tried. Although I chickened out and made the traditional cranberry-orange relish as well, everyone raved about this version, and it disappeared fast than the old standard.

So sorry to add my bad experience to all the wonderful reviews on this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and after tasting (others in family also taste-testing), had to conclude that we could not serve this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner. Don't think I did anything "wrong," but it tasted bland and harsh at the same time. Back to my old stand-bys!

I have made this every year since it first appeared in 98. My mom will not come to Thanksgiving unless I promise to serve it. Easy and delicious!

This will be the third year in a row that I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It has gotten raves every time and I can't wait to make it again.

This is the second year I am making copies of this recipe for family, friends and neighbors as they plan their Thanksgiving menus...the demand is high. I think most of North Jersey will be serving it this year. It's a testament to the success of this recipe - really different and really good!

Made this twice now-second time added 2 tsp cardomom and 1 tsp 5-spice as the first time thought it was a little bland.

I've always hated seeing the jellied, can-shaped blob of cranberry sauce on the Thanksgiving table, so I thought I would give this recipe a try. My family went crazy for it. This was a medly of unusual spices that came together to make a fantastic sauce. One could almost eat it by itself. The pears compliment the cranberries wonderfully. I would suggest it for any holiday feast.

This was the hit of three Thanksgiving tables last year; I made it for my celebration, gave some to a neighbor for his, and sent the recipe to my friend who also made it. There were serious raves all around. Great unusual spice flavor, and the pears really balance the bitterness of the cranberries well.

This is a delicious cranberry sauce. I heated up the leftovers and had them with yogurt for breakfast. Also makes a nice fruit compote-like dessert.

This is my new favorite cranberry sauce recipe. The pears and cardamom are unbelievable complements to the cranberries -- I use fresh. Depending on your taste, I think the sugar can be decreased slightly.

I made this last year and noted that it would be nice to substitute 3 or 4 T. of the cranberry juice with some brandy. Use really fresh cardamon.
