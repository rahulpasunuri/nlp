Great success. I will also make it during the year. However, I only had one head of cauliflower, so I used that plus twice as much leek. Maybe that solved some of the problems others faced. I mashed with a potato masher, as instructed, not a food processor.

Rating: 3
tasted great after making adjustments that others suggested (onion, garlic, more herbs, more salt). But it didn't hold together at all. Is it because I didn't put cauliflower/broccoli in blender, and left it roughly chopped? We did let it set for 10 min. but it didn't bind much at all. Did others add more matza meal?

This recipe looks great, but what can I use as a substitute for the eggs?

Rating: 2
Based on previous reviews, I was not surprised that it needed "something". It is a good base recipe to use veggies in the fridge. Next time I would cook the cauliflower in veggie stock to infuse more flavor and I might add some veg stock to the leek mixture as it cooks down, or maybe a little white wine. So I would make it again, just not quite as written.

I don't care much for cauliflower, but I found a little pkg. of white sauce with pepper that tasted great with it. I will include it and reduce the eggs, and omit the dill. We need our veggies.

I mashed cauliflower with cream cheese instead of using eggs and used lot more seasoning .

I made this recipe yesterday for the Jewish New Year. We had 30 people attending the dinner. Most of the kugel was not consumed. It fell apart when I attempted to cut it into serving portions. I followed the recipe to the nth degree. The taste was bland and without much flavour. I have read previous comments about this recipe and it seemed to be quite successful. I know for one, I will not make it again.

I added the onion like other reviewers. I also added 1/4 gram of saffron (steeped 10 minutes in 1/2 cup water. It made a huge difference. The saffron flavor really enriched the dish (especially when served cold the next day) and the yellow color on the seder table was an eye-catcher.

This became a permanent visitor every passover. It was also translated to Hebrew and is now passed around cooking forums in Israel. Everybody loves it, since it is not as heavy as most passover recipes.

Fantastic kugel. I changed it though--I used half cauliflower and half broccoli, I added an onion and 3 cloves of garlic to the leeks, doubled the herbs in the vegetable mixture, added a tsp of sugar, and used 1.5 times the herbs for the crust. And I doubled the almonds. Used an 8x10 pyrex. My guests gave it good reviews and even my toddler ate some!

This was delicious. Everyone raved. And it's fairly healthy! It was developed by Rozanne Gold who writes about it online. She used pureed garlic w/ the almond.

This was a hit! I made it last Passover with the matzoh meal and again for Thanksgiving using Panko crumbs instead. I also used onion and lots of garlic to add more flavor. A question for cooks: Since I have to work on Monday, I would like to assemble this dish on Sunday. Should I cook on Sunday and reheat on Monday, or assemble on Sunday and cook on Monday? I appreciate any feedback! Thanks. Sandy from NJ

Delicious! Took other reviewers' suggestions and used a heavy hand with the herbs - probably using twice the amount of parsley and dill called for. I also added an onion and 5 cloves of minced garlic to the leeks when sauteing. I subbed panko crumbs for matzo meal, and I added an extra egg because the mixture looked a bit dry after having added the recommended 3.

This was fabulous. Since it is not Passover, I substituted the matzoh meal with Japanese panko crumbs. I also added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. I will definitely make this next Passover.

We aren't Jewish but my mom made this to take to a seder she had been invited to. She was feeling lazy so she skipped the topping and since she was out of dill, she skipped that. She added some extra salt and a little bit of Tabasco sauce. She made a second pan for herself which she served me a couple nights later. I took the second pan home with me. It was absolutely amazing. I don't know if the addition of Tabasco could make that much difference, because it wasn't at all spicy, but it was SUPER flavorful and just plain delicious! I came looking for the recipe today.

Anybody add mozzarella cheese? I'm thinking of ways to make it a bit heartier.

This got rave reviews! I modified the recipe slightly according to other user reviews and definitely see how this could be too bland otherwise. First, absolutely add an onion and garlic when sauteing the leeks. I chopped the onion and garlic and sauteed it in the olive oil for about 5 minutes before adding the leeks. Liberally add salt, pepper, and garlic powder while cooking. After mixing with the cauliflower and matzo meal, taste the mixture (a good cook always samples her food thru the process) and add more salt and pepper as needed. I also added more parsley and dill to the mixture, as well as making more for an extra thick "topping/crust". Overall, don't be too concerned with measurements for this recipe and remember to taste and add salt and pepper as needed. This dish is sure to be gobbled up!

I have gotten great reviews when serving this dish. It can be bland if the leeks are mild - make sure your leeks are fresh and after chopping they equal 4 cups.

Great basis for a veggie kugel, but lacked a little oomph/seasoning. I would definitely make again but add some extra flavor. I get they wanted to make it no-dairy, but I don't mind, so I think some grated cheese, Parmesan or Gouda maybe, might be a perfect addition. Especially to the topping.

With a few pinches of salt, onion powder and garlic to the leeks while they were cooking it turned out quite tasty. It seemed to be too bland as the recipe does not call for much spices.

I used more leeks than called for plus one clove of garlic, and it was very tasty. I also baked it in a smaller pan than called for, so it had good depth to it when served. It was delicious!

I made this for Passover dinner and it was (as many other reviewers noted) really bland. I tried to add additions like onion and garlic to the kugel and parmesan to the crust, and none of them helped. Overall, not awful, but not very flavorful.

I added 1/2 an onion to the recipe, and despite some reviews that made me a little nervous, I thought this dish had a wonderful flavor. It's filling without being heavy. The almonds toast themselves while in the oven, so you don't have to buy pre-toasted almonds if you can't find them or they're more expensive.

The herbs and almonds add serious flavor to this dish. The cauliflower has a delicate flavor, but the dish as a whole is by no means bland. You can really taste the olive oil, pepper, and leeks, so it's nice that the cauliflower isn't overpowering--it creates a nice combination of flavors. I think this is a great dish because it has a lot of taste, but gets its appeal from fresh herbs and heart healthy fats. It's healthful, but you don't feel like you're depriving yourself.

Rating: 2
I made this for Passover and added the extra onions and 2 cloves of garlic as suggested by other reviewers. You'd think that with all the leeks, a whole onion, garlic and the other herbs it would be tasty. It was perhaps the blandest dish I've ever made. It did get eaten up so I'm guessing that others didn't think it was as boring as I did, but I'd sure like to know what everyone who wrote reviews was raving about.

Rating: 2
I loved the idea of this - it looked beautiful, too. SInce I don't have a Passover food processor, I used chopped walnuts, which I toasted per the instructions. Something was missing - it tasted pretty bland except for the topping. It could certainly use more S & P than called for; perhaps that's all that's missing!? On the up side, I ddin't get too many complaints from my teenaged food critics.

Rating: 2
I really wanted to love this but the best I can say is that no one hated it. I added onions and garlic as other reviewers suggested and still it was the most boring dish imagineable. I'm still trying to figure out what everyone who loved it did to make it more interesting.

As per suggestions, I added a chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic and additional salt and pepper. My family liked this, but didn't love the dill and nuts on top. The consistency was nice and it cut up nicely and looked pretty. Next time I will tinker with the spices since the dill did not appeal to my folks.

Had this one saved to my recipe box but never made it...until this year! It went over very well. I doubled the recipe - had 21 for Seder but did use the same size dish it called for. Beautiful bright green color with herbs!

This was ok, but very thin--I would double the amount for the same size pan. It also wants salt, and next time I think I will add some paprika for color, perhaps other spices; it is a little bland.

This one always gets rave reviews, even among the meat-and-potatoes types. I decided to make it again last night, and had everything on hand except the matzoh. Instead, I substituted table water crackers leftover from a party. They were the kind with cracked black pepper baked in, so I just left out the 1/2 tsp. pepper, and it came out just as tasty as always.

I tested this recipe for a "kugel throw down" for a Shabbat lunch at my temple. My husband liked it. My 13 year old son rated the dish "good" but not competition worthy. I'll find another recipe for the throw down, but will probably make this again. It was tasty.

I'm so surprised by the mixed reviews on this. I had saved this to my recipe box years ago, and always wanted to make it because it sounded so good but was put off by the comments. It was exactly what I had in mind for a Thanksgiving side dish though, and I thought it was fantastic! I wouldn't change any part of the recipe. I thought it was attractive and delicious - a great mix of flavors and textures and can be assembled in advance and then just put in the oven. It could be a great base for variations but I love it as is.

Wasn't thrilled with this, and neither was my husband. Maybe I didn't mash the cauliflower enough, and I felt the topping could've used some fat to help it stick and bind. Hubby said "something's missing"...garlic or something spicy.

I substituted broccoli for cauliflower as that's what was in my fridge, and it came out really good. I steamed the veggies to retain more of the nutrients, and substituted chives for the parsley (didn't have any). The dill/brocc combination was really - surprisingly - yummy. My husband hates broccoli and he actually almost liked this dish!

This recipe sounded great, made it with some good fresh organic cauliflower and leeks. It was, well, fine, but nothing incredibly special. Was a bit too moist (was expecting something crunchier and drier, maybe) If I made it another time, I'd maybe try roasting the vegetables to bring out the flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly. I will make it again however I will add garlic and onion. The leeks alone did not stand up to the cauliflower. As written this is a two forker in my opinion.

OUTSTANDING!! no modifications necessary.

This recipe was a great find! The kugel is very flavorful and much lighter than the traditional potato version. Our only modifications were that we added one clove of garlic and a half an onion based on previous reviews. We also found that one large cauliflower had plenty of florets for the recipe. Since the end result is tasty and quite pretty, we will definitely be making this one again and not just on Passover.

I wouldn't call this dish " utterly surprising" (like the lead-in to the recipe), nor was it "irresistible," but it was good. I used frozen cauliflower and followed previous writers' advice and doubled the topping and added garlic too. It wasn't great (if it had been, I'd make it all year 'round, which I won't), but I'll make it again once a year on Passover. If you're a big cauliflower fan, though, you owe it to yourself to try it.

Outstanding! I made this dish for Passover Sedar and will definitely make it year round. Slight modifications to the recipe...I added a chopped onion to the leeks and a clove of minced garlic. Also as per an earlier review, I added some garlic powder. I made it with 1 cauliflower, so baked it in a square pyrex for about 45 minutes. Delicious!

There is a bit of prep to make this turn out right I think it's a good dish. I made it per the recipe and added 1T of garlic powder to the mixture and a light dusting of parmesan to the topping. As we don't keep kosher at home this was a nice update. I could also imagine making this and adding some chopping portabello mushrooms to the mixture.

Rating: 3
The comments from others helped me when I made this recipe for our sedar. I think the Leeks sound great, but do not give you enough bounce or flavor, so I used some leeks, but added 1/2 onion, and one more egg, and then it tasted wonderful. Before it was too bland for our taste, but this way, it was delicious, and it tastes very much like a potato kugel without the carbs! Topping is a must!

Rating: 4
This was a big hit! Doubled recipe for seder of 20 people; 10x14 pan eaten, and 8x8 pan saved for leftovers. I think these pan sizes gave me more area for the topping, which I increased 1 1/2 (before doubling), which was all the merrier. I started with roasted unsalted almonds, and didn't need to toast them. I got 8 c. of chopped leeks from only 3 leeks (they were really large)! Is matzoh ball mix the same as matzoh meal? Because that's what I used. Taking people's recommendations here I added 3 cloves garlic (before doubling) with the leeks. I would really miss the dill... it was so delicious... but you could just do all parsley if kids don't like dill. I'm sure Italian flat-leaf parsley would be okay too. I bet sage would be interesting. I will be sharing this recipe with all of the people who asked for it!

We are having Seder for the first time at our house this year, and I am both excited and nervous. My husband's children are not dill fans. What would my soul-epicurians suggest as a tasty substitution?

Rating: 3
This dish is quite good. A few suggestions: Use more than 1/2 T of kosher salt and use 4 large leeks. Puree the cauliflower in a food processor. Bake in two deep 8 x 8 pans - each will yield enough for 8 servings as part of a dinner menu (especially a seder). Freeze the other one if it doesn't get eaten.

I made a half pan of this recepie for a trial for Passover, and I was disappointed. We did not find the texture of the kugel appealing. The spices on the top were the only interesting element of the dish. Next time I will make plain caulifour and look for a different kugel to make.

I made this recipe for our Passover Seder and we got a great response. I really liked this kugel becuase it is lighter and healthier than most other kugels - not much oil (we cut it a bit), no butter, and not very much matzo meal. We used to make a more traditional cauliflour kugel (it resembled a potato kugel) with magarine, more eggs, and more matzo meal. Traditionalists may prefer the pure cauliflour one, as it is more dense. The almond and herb topping gave this one a great crunch. We didn't use as much herbs on the topping, as it seemed like a lot. The leeks also gave it a great flavor. I give this recipe a thumbs up!

I loved the light and delicate taste of this vegetable kugel. The dill really made it distinctive.

This one is a winner. Very light and great flavour. When I told my husband (who NEVER eats leftovers) that it was one of the choices for dinner the next night, he chose it over several other choices. Since there were only 2 of us, I did half the recipe which worked out just fine.
