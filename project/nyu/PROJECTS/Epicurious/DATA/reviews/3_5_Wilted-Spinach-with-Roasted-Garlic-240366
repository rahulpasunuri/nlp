In spite of the lackluster reviews I decided to make this and I'm glad I did. It's delicious and simple. The whole cloves of roasted garlic are mild and sweet and delicious when shared with a mouthful of the spinach. You have to use adult, not baby spinach - I used bags of prewashed curly spinach and dried it in a salad spinner. No problems at all with excess water. Need to move it around a lot as it wilts so it doesn't stick. It's now a go-to recipe. Everyone has loved it.

Saute some low sodium diced bacon, remove it from the pan, (except about half Tbs. of the bacon grease). The rest of the recipe is the same...but add goat cheese on top before serving.

I chopped up most of the garlic before roasting it. The dish was good, but it could have been better.

I found this very simple to make, however, if the spinach is not dry to start with, then the dish is watery. If you don't like to use spinach straight from the bag (ie, you rinse it), then it makes sense to wilt it in another pot so that the water doesn't go into the finished dish.

More effort than reward for this dish.

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first and it ended up really watery. I think it's important to make sure the spinach is really dry. Good flavor though.

We loved this recipe. Too avoid being too watery don't let the spinach wilt too long. Also, I used more garlic and spinach thand called for per serving and halved the garlic after it was done roasting. The garlic flavor really came through in the finished dish.

I thought this was an excellent recipe but I was missing the garlic cloves once and using mince garlic browned in EVOO worked just as well. However, I added soy sauce to make it less bland.

I tried to avoid the wateriness mentioned in the last comment by stir frying spinach with roasted garlic in EVO. Frankly still, rather bland. I would prefer a stir-fried fresh spinach with minced garlic. Not a well thought out recipe.

I agree with Hamilton. The spinach was watery and so made the dish bland in spite of the garlic. I would squeeze the water out of the spinach first before adding the garlic and garlic oil, if I make it again.

I'm always interested in ways to serve spinach. I found this a bit watery.
