Excellent! I sprinkled some chopped fennel fronds on top of the individual soup servings, and it looked very pretty.

Frizzled leeks are leeks that are sliced very thin and then fried in a skillet--great as a garnish!

Absolutely delicious, very easy to make and extremely sophisticated. I added some sauteed onions once right in the beginning and served it hot and it tasted fantastic too. I'd love to know what "frittered leeks" means.

In California in July I could not find fresh fennel, so I used the same amount of diced celery. Even with the substitution the soup had a fantastic flavor for a hot summer afternoon get together with friends! Definately a keeper!

Very good summer soup. I used a bit more Pernod and it was still just a nice subtle presence.

Excellent! Easy to make, yet very sophisticated flavor. Nice with a garnish of frizzled leeks and/or a drizzle of infused oil.

Very good by the cup, not by the bowl.

Excellent cold soup for hot summer days. Intriguing taste of fennel in the background. Definitely would make again.
