This is going to be my new 'go-to' pecan pie recipe. Because of reading the comments, I toasted all of the pecans, and I used half light syrup and half dark syrup - and also took note that this recipe makes enough for two pies. Wonderful!

I've been making this at holidays for the past few years and it is a favorite (my daughter just requested it for her birthday instead of cake). I use a 10-inch pie plate (says so right on the bottom), and the filling fits perfectly.

I've made this for 4 or 5 years now--still one of our favorites. It does make more than easily fits in my deep dish pie plate, but I simply fill to the appropriate level and use the remains to make a few tarts--because I always have left over crust as well. This also gives me a mini-pie to leave behind, and a few to take as tastes before T'giving. There's always a few who want to cut the pie the day before! So look at the extra as a gift. It's a simple, really good pie.

This is the best pecan pie recipe that I have made. The grounded toasted pecans make a big difference. However, this is after I have made some adjustments. Follow the directions, however, cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup up to 1 cup, depending how sweet you like it. Also, reduce the amount of corn syrup that you use by about 1/2 a cup. I also like to use half dark and half light corn syrup. With these adjustments, the pie doesnt come out gooey anymore and tastes delicious. And, the pie mix is good for two 8inch pies like someone mentioned. Otherwise, it just goes to waste.

I made this pie and followed the directions as is, I baked it the amount of time directed and as I cut into the pie the whole entire thing started oozing out. It never congealed, it was an embarrasment as my family was looking forward to pecan pie. The crust was horrible, it was dry not a flake to be found. I don't even think this deserved even a 1 fork rating. What a waste.

Agree that the amopunt of filling from the recipe exceeds capacity of 10 inch pan, but the final outcome was wonderful. Definitely a do-over.

I have been baking for many years and get irritated when there is a lack of care in test kitchens. The filling for this pie could easily fill to 2 8" pie crusts and have no waste. I am in the process of baking this right now.... (a test run for Thanksgiving dinner) with much of it over spilling the pie crust which will probably burn. The Flavors of the raw ingredients were outstanding and I would suggest toasting the entire amount of pecans. Aimee

Excellent pie. Am a cook, not a baker so I use the pre-made pie crusts (not for long). This is my 3rd time with this recipe and everyone still comes back for more. I will have to quadruple the recipe when I am finely able to prepare and perfect the home-made crusts.

This recipe is everything that a pecan pie should be and best of all it's incredibly simple. Some people mentioned that their pies were soupy but I encountered no such problems. I'm sure I'll be making this one again.

I took the advice of one reviewer and left out the corn syrup (I didn't want the soupy pie most other reviewers described). Suffice it to say, my four year old called it "Sand Pie". I highly recommend the Apple Cranberry Ribbon pie for holiday baking instead. By the way, this site seems to be rigged. My first attempt at posting this thumbs down review was deleted forty five minutes after it appeared! Is it possible that we're only reading the reviews 'they' allow us to read?

I tried this recipe without the corn syrup as one reviewer recommended.....UGH! My 4 year old called it "Sand Pie". Perhaps I'll try it again with the corn syrup despite the fact that many reviewers complained that the recipe came out soupy. In the meantime, I'll highly recommend the apple cranberry ribbon pie instead of this one.

This is the best pecan pie I've ever made or had anywhere! Very much superior to plain-jane pecan pie. I cannot judge the crust recipe as I only used the filling recipe. Trust me, I know my food and this is, well, KILLER! (If I may use that adjective). A+ pie!

I just made this for Christmas. I followed the directions but for 2 exceptions: I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for white sugar, and added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to cut the sweetness (yikes pecan pie is sweet!) I feel the addition of the ground, toasted pecans really added a new depth of flavor to this pie. In the future I will try this trick with the maple pecan pie recipe on this site, as I love the maple flavor with the pecans.

I made this & took it to my aunt's house for Thanksgiving. I also had a soupy result upon cutting into it. However, my aunt is a wonderful & experienced cook. She advised that we put into a 350 oven & cook it until a knife inserted into center came out clean. So, all wasn't lost, only delayed!

This was an embarrising disaster-despite looking completely baked it was pure liquid in the center. I don't know what I could do to improve it, except possibly leave out the corn syrup.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I thought the ground pecans in the filling added an extra rich pecan flavor. Served warm with vanilla ice cream...so good!!

Did anyone notice this is a doubling of the tried and true Karo syrup recipe with the addition of ground, roasted pecans to the filling? I think there must have been a few first time pecan pie bakers here. I also think that the assumption is a 10" pie plate also will be deep dish. The recipe states to bake "till puffed and set". If you're not sure the filling is set, take a tip from the Karo recipe, insert a knife midway between the center and the rim, and if it comes out clean, it's done. If you allow the pie to cool at room temp before serving the center will finish cooking and set up beautifully. If you're nervous about it though, an extra 5 min. or so in the oven won't hurt, just don't burn the pecans on top. No cause for this pie ever to be soupy. If the crust is browning too quickly, and as in this recipe you need to freeze or at least thoroughly chill the fitted crust before adding the filling, lay a piece of foil, shiny side up, on top of the pie without tucking it around. (I also notice that everyone who had trouble with this recipe is not in the South where pecan pie is tradition!) This is a wonderful recipe-- work with it and it will "make you proud" every time!

This was the first time I tried to make a pecan pie. My pie also turned out to be soup!!! We were so disappointed as the pie looked delicious but was soupy when we cut into it. I realized it was not my mistake when I started to read all the other reviews on Thanksgiving!! Would not be brave enough to attempt this pie again!

Very good recipe

Rating: 3
My first Pecan Pie and it was great!!! Rave reviews from all the diners. I used a well-seasoned cast iron skillet and "toasted" the pecans stovetop. You have to keep close watch so the pecans do not burn...but the results are wonderful. I agree that the filling enough for 2 pies. I baked the extra filling in buttered ramekins to serve at a later time. This is a repeater and I will not wait for the holidays to make it again!!!!

I followed the suggestion from OKC, OK and blended the butter & toasted pecans together. I had no problems with the pie setting up and the cooking time mentioned in the recipe was what I used--no problems with "soupiness". My family felt this was one of the best pecan pies we have had. I did have extra filling--which we combined with the extra pumpkin I had from the pumpkin pie. Not a problem. I'm very surprised by some of the reviews because this was so easy to make and was not soupy at all. Don't know what the difference was.

Toasting the nuts adds a whole new dimension to a standard Thanksgiving dessert. . .the crust is delicious. I used a 9" dish instead and had extra filling to bake and taste-test the night before.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It really tasted great and the crust was delicious, but the problem with the recipe is that the crust is for one pie and the filling is for two pies. Thankfully I had an extra frozen crust to use for the extra filling. It's definitely an error in the recipe. Every other recipe for pecan pie is half the amount of ingredients than this recipe for a single pie. Baking the filling in two pies, it was not at all soupy - perfect consistency, but be careful that the pecans don't burn on teh edges when toasting them and also when baking the pie.

Our family thought this was the best pecan pie ever.

Toasting the pecans does add an additional zing to the pecan taste. Everyone loved it. Cooking it for 1 hour 10 minutes would be too long. I luckily checked my pie after 50 minutes of cooking and it was a little too done for me (even with an aluminum crust cover). I would recommend your first check at 40 minutes.

I received a couple of compliments on this dish, but did not particularly like the flavor myself. The cranberry dish did not seem to set very firm - still liquidy after refrigeration overnight.

Mine also turned to liquid. I followed the recipe exactly, and there was so much filling that I used a deep dish pie plate. I thought it might have needed to chill overnight to thicken up, but that didn't help, and I had to throw it out this morning.

oops, i forgot to include something in my comment....i did make a mistake by adding 1 stick of butter in the filling instead of the 1/2 stick listed in the recipe. (i didn't experience a problem with soupiness, maybe it was because of the extra butter??)

Made this one for Thanksgiving, and got rave reviews. I made no substitutions, and it came out perfectly. Though the competition consisted of a few uninspired pies, it won the dessert contest hands down. I served it with a homemade cinnamon ice cream. Yum!

Although mine wasn't soupy, it definitely was exactly the amount of filling for 2 pies. Also, the excessive sweetness overshadowed what should have been the toasty taste of the ground pecans. I'd give this one a pass...

I first found this recipe in "The Prudhomme Family Cookbook", a collection from Chef Paul and his siblings. Once people taste a pecan pie baked like this, they never want it any other way-- the filling tastes of pecans, too. A word on roasting pecans: a cast iron skillet works best and there's a fine line between "toasted to perfection" and "burned". When you start to see oil come out on the surface of the pecan pieces, you're getting close. Pop the pieces immediately into the food processor and add the softened butter called for in the recipe. You really want to process thoroughly, to creamy, not chunky. In 16 yrs. of using this recipe, it's never missed and never failed to delight. It's just the right twist on a traditional pie and of course by now a Murphy family favorite!
