Followed the recipe pretty much as printed, except didn't have a salad spinner and even though I thought I'd thoroughly washed my arugula, it still ended up being gritty. Wasn't crazy about the final result--don't think I liked the wilted greens aspect. Many better pizza recipes on this site and liked the idea of using tortillas as the base

I did not have pitas or tortillas on hand but did use puff pastry sheets. Very good this way, too. Especially for entertaining.

This was one of several items I presented during an annual Christmas progressive dinner by families in my neighborhood. This receipe was easy to prepare and well received. I also used pita instead of tortila. The ingredients held together nicely,using a pizza cutter to divide into individual slices.

I usually try to follow a recipe line for line when I first make it. In the case of this recipe I did not follow my rule and swapped pita bread for the Tortillas. I used the same cooking time and temperature recommened for the tortillas. The results were great and I will definitly make this again. I will even try it in the future with the tortillas, althought the pita worked so well I can't imagine the results coming out any better.
