I have made this twice now. The first time to recipe was underwhelming but I knew with some tweaks it could be a keeper. I marinated the shrimp with some garlic, red pepper flakes, lime zest and olive oil. Cook in olive oil in batches.Keep warm. Deglaze pan with the white wine, add peppers, more garlic, lime juice and tomatoes. Add some chicken stock to create more liquid for sauce. Simmer to heat. Add shrimp back to pan. When pasta is done, drain, add shrimp/pepper mix plus toasted pine nuts and a decent amount of goat's cheese. Then add cilantro. Check seasoning. Yum.

Love this recipe. I seasoned the shrimp with crushed garlic, S&P and some red chili flakes. I sauted the red peppers first with the garlic - then added the shrimp and used orecchiette pasta and a few more chili flakes. Also subsituted parlsey for the cilantro. Great flavors and easy!

Thanks for the suggestions in the reviews. With the changes suggested this came out great, and was a quick, easy dinner. Without a ton of butter or cream I'm not sure that this is what I usually think of as scampi, but it is MUCH healthier, so much more in keeping with the way I cook. I too like shrimp with a side of pasta instead of the other way around. So I used 1 1/2 lbs of thawed shrimp. Also used grape tomatoes instead of sundried, since I already had a carton of those in the house. And I left off the cilantro, since it's simply not a flavor I like, and substituted flat leave parsley. With all the changes I am not really reviewing THIS recipe, but thought others might like to see it with changes.

Made as directed except used frozen cooked tail-on shrimp (all I had) and key limes (also all I had). Maybe my ingredients were not the best, but I thought the dish had no depth of flavor. Maybe if it were finished with about 1/2 stick of unsalted butter for creaminess - now you're talkin. There are better recipes out there.

Lots of flavor and easy to make. Subbed regular tomotoes too.

This is Delicious. I made this for my wife and she raved about it. I used grape tomatoes that I added after it came off the heat and let the dish heat the tomatoes through. This recipe is a keeper.

Read the reviews - Poblano chilis are not hot by nature - but the MUST be seeded thoroughly. If you double the recipe you will need extra time to reduce the liquid to the desired consistency. I used whole wheat penne and the shape worked perfectly with the dish. I also substituted halved grape tomatoes for the sundried tomatoes - just a matter of personal preference but worked well.

Good flavors! It had a distinctly foreign feel to it, like Thai or Mexican. I followed the cooking suggestions of "A Cook From Alamongodro", only with linguine. I used raw frozen shrimp. Everything turned out great.

Had a delicious flavor but there was entire too many peppers and noodles for the amount of shrimp. We had to hunt for the shrimp among the other ingredients! Next time I will use only 1 poblano and 1/2 a bell pepper, and maybe only a cup of noodles. Like another reviewer, I prefer shrimp with a side of pasta, not the other way around. Very delicious flavor overall though.

Delicious. Everyone loved it. Easy to make. I left out the sun dried tomato.

This was delicious! I followed one review and cooked up the garlic in the oil first, then added the peppers and sliced tomato (not a fan of sun-dried). I cooked that for a bit and then added the zest and lime juice. Then I added the shrimp. I used frozen shrimp and they were very good, but I will go for the uncooked ones next time I make this. I also won't simmer the white wine sauce as long, its so delicious but I ended up cooking it down too much and didn't have any extra in the pan to pour over the dish. I also halved the pasta amount (could only find whole wheat penne). I wanted a shrimp dish with a side of pasta, not the other way around. My husband ate half of it last night!! I just finished up the last serving for lunch! Great flavors and very easy!! Try it!

Delicious! I thought it had lots of flavor and just the right amount of heat. My substitutions were...I used linguine noodles, fresh grape tomatoes, and a mix of poblano and anaheim chiles.

Made this last night, with a few changes--mostly divided it in half for 2 large servings. Did salt the pasta water, and then only lightly salted and peppered the raw shrimp--used 12 oz. (wt. after preparing, defrosting, and blotting dry the M/L shrimp, 31 to 40 per lb.) Grated 2 cloves of garlic into the olive oil, and when they started to brown, I added the red bell pepper and poblano slices, and a small handfull of halved grape tomatoes (have never seen sun-dried in this town). When the red pepper slices only began to soften, I added the lime juice and zest. Mixed this well, and THEN ADDED THE SHRIMP. Cooked this about 3 minutes until the shrimp were almost opaque. Then I added 1/3 cup of dry RED wine. Reduced the wine a bit, mixed in the farfalle, and simmered the whole thing, covered, about 2 minutes. OMG!!! WAS THIS EVER GOOOD!! Can't believe anyone could think that this was flavorless. Also, I didn't cook the shrimp as long as the original recipe states, so they were perfect and not overcooked. Do not forget the cilantro at the end--it adds a lot. Also, be wary of the poblano chiles--I used 2/3 of one, and it was on the verge of being too hot for us. Next time I may cut it back to 1/2 of one chile. ENJOY!!!

This was terrible. It was flavorless and not at all spicy (even though we used three large poblanos). The garlic flavor never got going, and the shrimp were overcooked by the time the bell pepper was warmed. This is the first epicurious recipe to send me running for the jarred tomato sauce.

Generally nice flavors, but far too hot. Overwhelmed other flavors. Maybe the poblanos were too big.

Really easy and delicious! Made it last night for some friends and used brown rice pasta instead of whole wheat, it worked out perfectly! Definitely will make this again.
