Good recipe. Don't take the ginger out - the ginger and cranberries in the sauce make the presentation more beautiful. Not to mention that the ginger is delicious after being cooked in the sauce. It also calls for much more sugar than needed - especially if the pears are ripe. I used 1/3 cup and it was still too much.

I use these poached pears sliced up in a mixed baby greens salad with blue cheese, walnuts, and a vinagarette dressing. Oustanding!

A wonderful dessert after a hearty winter dish. My guests thought it was fabulous and it was easy to do ahead. I heated the sauce, prepared ahead of time, in the microwave and poured it over room temperature, previously poached, pears.
