This recipe is BEYOND EASY. I've made it twice now and both times the fish came out perfect. I make this with asparagus and rosemary mashed sweet potatoes cause this is my I-have-only-35 minutes-to cook dish. Once I get the fish in the oven, I prep my asparagus and throw them on a cookie sheet/baking pan (doesnt really matter) and pour about 1 tablespoon to 2 of olive oil. I use the leftover lemon half to squeeze the juices over the asparagus then take a cheese grater or any kind of grater and grate the lemon rind (it'll taste good whether u do this or not). Next, I add a little bit of the kosher salt (a pinch or two or three?--just eyeball) and then I just roll the asparagus around in the mixture just to get em covered-approx 5 secs. About 10 mins before the fish is done, I pop the asparagus in the oven (I just move the fish over and cook both fish and asparagus simultaneously). The rosemary mashed sweet potatoes are pretty great and easy to make too....just cook the potatoes (i cube them and I think it takes like 15-20 mins). Once they are cooked (I check em with my fork to see if they are soft) I drain, reduce the heat to med put the pot back on the stove, move the potato cubes to the sides of the pot and I throw in some butter, (like a teaspoon for every 2 sweet potatoes-eyeball) and some chopped FRESH rosemary in the middle where the butter is to fry it up a bit (best if you let the butter brown a teensy bit) then mash away. I add some brown sugar as well (like a tablespoon per 2 potatoes). W/r/t the fish, I actually dont pour the olive oil or lemon juice on the fish and I'd suggest trying that out too.....the fish is perfectly moist with the right amount of lemon from those sliced lemon in the fish. Drizzling it with oil and lemon will only destroy that wonderful "clean" moistness of the fish (I honestly don't know how else to describe it).

This is dinner theater at it's best! My husband originally had this in Italy and couldn't get his mind off it so I had to find a recipe. As someone else said, it's a no brainer. So so so easy. This is the way fish was meant to be cooked & eaten. I have five children, and this is a time saver and a crowd pleaser. I just serve it right from the sheet I baked it on and everyone goes at it taking family style eating to a whole new level. Don't be intimidated!

Agreed. This is a great dish to make for a dinner party. It's super easy. The rustic presentation and process of cracking the salt impressed guests. And most importantly, the fish was perfectly moist and the flavor of the snapper really comes through. I stuffed the cavity with thyme and lemon and substituted the cup of water with 6 egg whites. That made making the salt crust very easy and malleable. I would read up on how to fillet a whole fish to make the most out of the fish. Tuck the open flap of the belly tight so the salt doesnt seep into the fish. I served with Giada De Laurentis' Fennel Puree. It's a divine combination!

Exceptionally moist Red Snapper dish. So simple.

This is, quite simply, the way to cook a whole snapper. As others testify, this method doesnt render the fish salty; only moist and flavorful. I took a hint from Alton Brown and substituted egg whites for the water. I added a couple of hands full of fresh herbs along with the lemon. Very impressive presentation. I had no problem with bones as one reviewer seemed to imply. The skeleton and meat easily kept to themselves. Ill definitely redo this over and over again!

What did I do wrong? I followed the instructions exactly and the salt was baked hard on the outside but still soft on the inside. I thought this would be like the salt baked chicken we make, delicious and moist but it was way too salty and slightly dry. Next time (if there is a next time) I will cover the fish with cheese cloth, which is what i do to the salt baked chicken, and bake for only 20 minutes.

A v. simply dish, but delicious and fun. Great for dinner parties!

Just melts in your mouth.......I took the suggestion of an egg in the salt crust mixture and reduced the water and it came apart so easily.....Delicious!!!!!!!

Another no-brainer winner. Impossible to screw this up if you folllow directions. The one thing the recipe foesn't mention is that you had better be able to filler a fish. I could, so didn't think twice, but wonder how others might fare. Fish was cooked perfectly and would not hesitate to make this dish for the most sophisticated dinner guests.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I had no problem with the salt crust. I did make the crust a little bit differently. I used an egg with the salt and reduced the amount of water considerably. My crust came off two pieces and I had no problems with salt sticking to the skin of the fish.

This recipe is truly delicious! The Fish is so moist on the inside, but the skin has a very nice salt taste! On a scale from 1-10, 10 being the highest. I'd have to say a perfect 10!

It was very delicious and the fish came out moist and not salty just like everyone described. The not so great part is having to take off all of the skin and making sure not to miss any, cause that is some mighty salty skin... Very good tasting overall but I think that other ways of cooking a snapper/fish such as baking, steaming, might produce just as good fish - but for entertaining a big white salt crust ready to be cracked open is great for show.

The fish was SO moist and yummy! I forgot to drizzle with oil and it was still very good. The recipe was so easy to make--I would make this for a dinner party for sure.

This worked perfectly and was absolutely delicious! A splash of olive oil was a great touch for the finished product, and it was accompanied by sliced plum tomatoes and a slightly modified version of Oricchiette with Broccoli Rabe (used Barilla Mini Rigatoni and used cheese only for sprinkling on top). PS: Have someone on hand who can fillet a whole cooked fish (thanks, Mom!).

This was amazingly tender. I stuffed it with fennel, orange, shallot slices and lemon slices too. We weren't ready to eat immediately, so I removed it from the oven. It really retains heat well, without overcooking. Very fun dish!

After a day of fishing in the Florida sun we were anxious to find a good recipe for the red snapper we caught. This recipe captured my attention, although I feared it would be salty. I liked the sound of the moistness being kept in, however, so decided to try it. My husband nearly refused to eat it when he saw the finished product. He suffers from high blood pressure and feared I was trying to kill him with all that salt! Once I cracked the coating with a spoon, however, he took a bite and then we fought for the rest of the fish! It was moist, tasty and has NO salty taste! Look forward to presenting this to friends and family...

excellant. I have made it several times with various fish. Family and guests rave over it.

Wonderful! I almost couldn't bear to tell our friends it took 5 minutes of prep time and 30 minutes to cook.

One of those recipes that's so simple it shouldn't be as good as it is. I had fun with this dish at a potluck dinner party: since the fish was packed in salt, it wasn't clear what it was, and the guests were all very (epi)curious. I used a much larger fish, about five pounds, and used about nine pounds of kosher salt (with an appropriately adjusted amount of water) to completely pack the fish. A lemon and a half was enough to stuff the body. Cooking time goes up linearly with mass with a technique like this, so I cooked my snapper for 75 minutes and it was perfect. I didn't need a fancy fish pan; I just used a disposable turkey pan and filled in some of the dead space with aluminum foil wrapped loosely around more wadded aluminum foil (the idea was to keep it smooth). WARNING: Don't assemble this dish too far in advance, as the fish will leak a lot and dissolve more salt than is entirely comfortable. Also, you'd better have someone around who knows how to deal with a big fish hot out of the oven; a Spanish fisherman's son saved my butt, but I got lucky. Bon appetit.

I made this recipe twice. Once with a 5 lb lake trout, once with an 11 lb landlocked Atlantic salmon which my husband brought back from the wilds of northern Quebec. Both fish were a big hit. Both times, the fish came out moist with just a hint of salt which enhanced and did not overwhelm the subtle fish flavours. This one's a keeper and I'll be using it again.

The salt made a huge mess in the oven, and the overall effect was minimal. The salt crust did not make it taste any better or any worse than just plain baking in the oven.

Superb and a visual crowd pleaser. Any course salt will do by the way

I have tried this dish in Veracruz, Mexico, for the last three years and it is superb. It works great with pompano, also. It is served with a bernaise sauce. Thanks for publishing the recipe.
