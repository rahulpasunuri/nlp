Fantastic rub that pairs so very well with grilled salmon and baked salmon. I've served this just for my husband and myself, but also for guests...to great applause. I've used California mild [dried] ristas instead of the anchos. For flavor, I heat them in a hot skillet before using. I also buy a can of adobo chilis. I have doubled or even quadrupled this recipe and section out into an old ice cube tray for freezing. One cube is quite enough for a dinner for two! Goes well with a good Pinot Noir. The spice does not interfere.

It's easy, but it's not that great. The flavor of my fresh coho salmon disappeared under the slightly bitter rub. I won't make it again.

This was so easy. Love that the rub can be made in advance, so that the fish can be ready for the oven in a matter of minutes. The result looked as great as it tasted, and got excellent reviews from my dinner guest.

This was great. I used new mexico chili powder instead of the ancho process. I also made a lime and sweet citrus dressing to spoon over the salmon and side-greens when serving. Nice.

I've made this twice now to rave reviews. The ancho chilies were available in the produce section at Whole Foods. I served with Spinach, Corn and Roasted Red Pepper Salad, which also uses chipotles. YUM!

This was so yummy! We like it hot so I added extra chili powder and it was perfect. Will make over and over again.

I have never cared for salmon but I found this recipe to be very good for company that requested salmon. I used New Mexico chili powder and used a tad more chipotle than the recipe called for. I found that I had just enough paste to adequately cover four fairly large salmon steaks-- next time I would add more garlic and more lime (the recipe suggested adding water to make it paste like)

I made this last night and really enjoyed it. I used chili powder instead of grinding the peppers(which I didn't have) and it was still good. It will be a regular recipe when I'm in the mood for salmon.

Definitely a "make again". Rich spicy flavor that balances the fatty salmon. Pair it with a gewurtztraminer. The leftover chili paste (made a full recipe but used only half) makes a great marinade for shrimp. In a ziplock bag combine the chili paste, juice of one lime and a cup of white wine. Marinade for 45 minutes. Drain the marinade into a small pan, add 1/2 cup of chicken stock and boil until reduced by half, slightly thickened. Grill the shrimp on a grill pan about two minutes per side (don't overcook). A way to save a little time and effort is substitute a high quality chili powder (e.g., Penzeys Spices) for grinding whole chiles.

This recipe is fantastic! It is so easy to make and tastes wonderful! This is our favorite fish recipe and we have to keep from making it too often for fear of growing tired of it. The sweetness of the honey and hoisin perfectly balance the chipotle and the cilanto perfeclty balances out the flavor of this dish.

We make this recipe all the time. With the individualy packaged portions I have baked it on sheet pans for 50 people. Home roasted chilies make all the difference.

Had been looking forward to trying this recipe based on the rave reviews but was really disappointed in the outcome. My boyfriend and I both thought that the flavors of the sauce over powered the salmon. If you have fresh salmon then I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Yum! I took the lazy way and used purchased chili powder (good quality) instead of the whole dried ancho chilis... it turned out just fine. I served the salmon over mixed greens with a sweet oil & vinegar dressing (I used some of the brown sugar in the dressing and added a pinch of cumin) and it was a lovely supper.

We grilled the salmon and it was wonderful. This is a recipe we will be repeating often.

WOW - This is so yummy. Don't worry about the chile it's not a saga if you follow the recipe it goes together quickly, easily and it's even better the next day. I'm interested to see what people like serving with this. I made mashed potatoes and vegetables roasted with whole cuminseed. The vegetables were great with it but I didn't like the mashed potato combination (that's a first).

This was fabulous. We served it on top of mashed sweet potatoes with scallions and with a salad with maple dressing. Yum. RH

I made this last night for my boyfriend. He really enjoyed it. I served it along with a summer vegetable sauté. He said the two paired very well. I added more chipotle than the recipe called for, but it still didn't turn out too spicy.

Wonderful fish dish. My husband absolutely loved it!

GREAT dish on all counts: it was easy to make, the spice rub can be made ahead, it complemented the salmon without overwhelming it (I doubled the recipe and used it on 4.5 pounds of Copper River salmon fillet), and it wowed the confirmed foodies at my dinner party.

Wow! This chili rub was absolutely fantastic. On a thick piece of salmon it was heavenly. Too potent for a mild fish. Yum.

This recipe is truly great! I used dried chipotle's and added a little extra lime juice and garlic. I also used dark brown sugar. I served it with basmati, barely steamed spinach, and a nice tropial fruit salad with mangoes and pineapple. It was perfect for a hot evening. (April 17th, 92 degrees in New Hampshire!?!) Next time I'll try it on the barbeque.

I'm obsessed with this dish. Since finding it here a few weeks ago, I've made it maybe 5 times. I thought that the chili would overpower the fish, but not so. Can't recommend it more highly.

Sorry to be the odd one out on this recipe. My husband and I thought the rub was very good but overwhelmed the salmon. There are a number of other epicurious salmon recipes we prefer.

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I bet it would be excellent on chicken as well. I served it with a side of Caribbean Rice and Beans and Fried Plantains.

This dish was a hit! I added a little more chipotle than called for. Also good on chicken.

WOW--this was delicious! I was afraid the rub was going to be too spicy and overwhelm the fish, but it was awesome. I added more lime juice than called for, and cooked the salmon for 16 mins rather than 10. A definite keeper.

Used the marinade on shrimp and broiled the shrimp. Wonderful!

This is an excellent recipe! Even my boyfriend, who dislikes spicey food, enjoyed this recipe. He said it was the best salmon he ever had. It's a definate must try!

Oh this is great- and easy and quick! I did use less salt than called for.

I tried this recipe on the family first and we quite enjoyed this salmon. I put the marinade on both sides of the fish and then placed it on the barbecue. It turned out so good, my husband made comment...a number of times! Very unique flavour...something that will impress my guests when I serve it to them

Quick to make for a week-end dish. Very tasty, if you use a little less salt, it would be better.
