This was absolutely delicious and easy to make! Everyone loved it, it's very sweet and very unique. The base sauce on this is incredible and you can use it with many variations that will go well with it. I used Pecans instead of the nuts listed, and added some toasted coconut and bananas. I also cooked all the ingredients (except the cheese) together. and the sprinkled the cheese on after. This was a HUGE success for our Cinco de Mayo party.

I grew up with this as a holliday treat. it's better if you layer te ingredents and bake it together. Great recipe, authentic if baked togther.

This recipe is quite decent as "Gringo" capirotadas go, but to make it more palatable, go with pecans for all the nuts, and add in some sliced bananas and apples. My family loves the raisins and coconutin it too. The endless flavors vary from region to region, with us Texicans favoring cheddar cheese...

WOW! I was unsure of how all the ingredients would taste together, but it was delicious. The only problem I had was the crust of the bread got too hard and it was VERY difficult to eat without a steak knife. Perhaps, next time I will make sure to cut off the crust before baking. Otherwise the flavors were fabulous together.

A fantastic dish! My husband has his own variation: add two tablespoons of Kahlua, 1/4 cup espresso, substitute white chocolate chunks for queso, no peanuts, sprinkle with cinamon or Ghiriadelli double chocolate powder. Mercy. It's to die for.

I think the reviewer of 5/26/03 posted this rating on the wrong recipe. It should be on the chocolate bread pudding recipe.

Yummy! I dont know what the cook from 5-26 was talking about. I didnt find Kahlua or chocolate anywhere near this recipe.

The combination of Kahlua and chocolate sounded like a good combination for a bread pudding, but this was just way too rich. Much better bread pudding recipes out there.
