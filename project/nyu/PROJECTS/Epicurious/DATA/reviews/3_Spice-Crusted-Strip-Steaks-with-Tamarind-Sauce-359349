Very good. Liked the spiced for the meat, but I made this with chicken.

The reduction sauce was awesome - the celery salsa did not add much and was more time consuming than I wanted. Finding the tamarind concentrate was not easy either. I'd go a little lighter on the peppercorns too, but overall a nice summer meal

I followed the recipe for the spice crust and the tamarind sauce but left off the celery salad part. My husband hates celery. We loved the tamarind sauce. I will definitely make this recipe again.
