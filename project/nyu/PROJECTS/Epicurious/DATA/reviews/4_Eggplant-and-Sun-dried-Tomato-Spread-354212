Unfortunately was not impressed. It was very bland. I followed the directions exactly-I made sure the eggplant was seasoned, I added more lemon juice in the end, and I thought the sundried tomatoes just overpowered the subtle eggplant flavor. And I LOVE sundried tomatoes. Really bummed, cause it really looked like a great recipe.

Delicious!! I made this without the basil (I managed to leave the grocery three times without it, and figured it must be fate). Otherwise I made it according to the recipe and it was a big hit with the family. I'm looking forward to making it again with basil from my garden!

Very good recipe base...I did not have the sundried tomatoes but had an eggplant that I needed to use quick. Dip was quite delicious without, and even more moreish when I added a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise (I know I should be ashamed of myself!) but the results were irrestistable!

Followed recipe exactly, high expectations given rave reviews and love the ingredients- but so underwhelemd, as were my guests.

LOVED, loved, loved it. I too roasted the garlic as directed and also roasted cubed eggplant. I put the garlic in first and followed with the eggplant about 10 minutes later. I skipped the "sitting" of the eggplant and merely tossed it with salt and olive oil before roasting. I then threw everything in the blender. DELISH. I've already purchased more eggplant to make it again and plan on giving it as gifts to friend's for xmas.

Try this for easy prep that won't heat up the house. Roast garlic and whole eggplant on the grill. Just put the whole eggplant on with no oil or anything. If you want, you can plug it with garlic, but there's really no need with this recipe. Once the eggplant is black and kinda mushy, pull it off the fire and let it cool. Scoop the flesh from the skin right into the food processor, squeeze in the garlic and add the rest of the ingredients and pulse or puree, depending on how smooth you want it. This method also uses much less oil and imparts a nice grilled flavor. I prefer to serve with grilled pita chips.

just won over the Greek family I was visiting in Athens with this spread. the roasted garlic really makes the house smell AMAZING. having made it before, I tried to eliminate to most time-consuming part of salting, pressing, and frying the eggplant by tossing the cubes with salt in a roasting pan, adding a Greek-load of olive-oil and roasting it along with the garlic. it worked like a charm and reduced my active prep-time by about 40 minutes. we ate it with a new Santorinian beer called Volkan--it was a ridiculously tasty and yummy Greek start to the meal.

Lovely. I so needed something new to serve. Must say that I am not a lover of eggplant (neither where many who really enjoyed this!). Followed just as receipe suggested. The directions were a tad vague. They said that eggplant should sit for 30 min then pat dry - dry from what? I assumed they were suggesting that it was rinsed??? I didn't rinse and just let the eggplant brine in the salt. It was superb!

Made this for a dinner party, it was the star! Followed the recipe precisely as written. One cooks the eggplant on the stovetop so that it softens and mushes enough to make a dip. And to the guy who added balsamic... might be good that way but you missed the point- softer flavors that melded well! We loved it.

WOW WOW WOW This is delicious!! Only made a slight change in the cooking of the eggplant, like the cook in Toronto, I baked it at the same time as the garlic to use less oil. I ended up using olive oil in a spray bottle and really reduced the amount of oil used. We will make this again for sure, it was incredible! We are eating leftovers with pasta instead of bread.

True, it's a long way from start to finish, but the relationship between easy-to-make and rave reviews doesn't get much sweeter than this one!

I give this three forks because I just made it and accidentally didn't stick to the recipe. I went ahead and roasted the eggplant which worked well and left more time for hands off time but the skin got a little crispy. Instead of mashing some of it, I just chopped it all with the tomatoes and roasted garlic. I seasoned it all as written and think we're getting the general gist of flavor. I just tasted a little on bread and can't wait to have it as a spread with goat cheese sandwiches later!

I'm allergic to eggplant, so couldn't enjoy this. My guests did really enjoy it - seemed to go down well with wine and good crackers. It smelled great and I would have loved to try it. It was a little labor intensive for my liking, so not sure I would go to the trouble again, but it did keep for a good while, so may be worth it.

Rave reviews for this. The abundant herbs uplift this into something spectacular. I did not saute the eggplant. Instead, I baked it until golden (400, 20-30 minutes), using only 2-3 tablespoons of oil.

Excellent. Has been accepted into the Hall of Fame regular line-up at our house.

Easy and good. Even with a whole head of garlic I felt it lacked something. I added a good dash of balsamic and crushed red pepper flakes to give it some punch.
