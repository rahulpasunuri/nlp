This is an outstanding traditional style apple pie. I have been looking for this recipe for years - my family LOVED it! I didn't have any shortening, so doubled the butter. It was decadent, but perfectly flaky. Very easy recipe.

This absoluetly the best apple pie I have ever made/had!!! I did add 1/4 cup minced crystalized ginger, and instead of adding a top crust I made a crumb topping which baked with the pie. Results are incredible!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. To accommodate my friend with a gluten allergy, I used a frozen gluten free pie shell, and substituted rice flour and 1 Tbsp corn starch for the all purpose flour. I made it an open pie, no top crust, and served ice cream on the side. It came out lovely, with golden apples, and tastes great. My friend informs me, she and her spouse are fighting over remaining pieces!

We didn't love this quite as much as the other reviewers. It was good, but in my opinion, not the recipe to make if you want to make a good, basic apple pie. I just thought the spice was too much for an apple pie.

According to my husband James (who considers himself an apple pie expert) and the scores of people I've served over the last 10 years, this is the absolutely best apple pie ever. People won't let me bring another dessert. If short on time, use premade pie crust. Other than that, I would not change a thing.

Pretty good, but not especially notable. Makes a very tall pie.

This apple pie has become a tradition for my family and friends every Thanksgiving. I follow the recipe completely and it is fabulous! Needless to say there is never any leftover, so this year I am making two.

Living amongst diabetics, I used only 1/8 brown and 1/8 white sugar. I didn't use the mace either. This was my first pie...EVER. Wow! This recipe is foul proof and delicious. The amount of sweetness was perfect as the apples I used were ripened golden delicious from my wonderful tree Everyone loved it.

Tasted great, but doesn't compare to my sister's recipe (which I can't share, unfortunately, because it's in her head & I don't even know it). I used my no-fail crust recipe- another of epicurious'. Then I used HoneyCrsip apples that I had U-picked, therefore, I didn't know if I put in exactly 3 lbs or not- just guesstimated. Found it a little too runny (due to the apples?) and will put in corn starch next time. Also a tad too sweet- would reduce sugar, but again, probably due to the kind of apples I was working with. Another reason I personally found it too sweet may be because I grew up abroad and don't care for the oversweetened baked goods America churns out- and I actually LOVE sweets in general. Would definitely try it again, though, with some tweaking. P.S. My husband loved it and he doesn't usually like apple pie, so... there you go!

This is my absolute favorite apple pie recipe!! I have made it so many times (using store-bought crust makes it really easy) and it has always turned out amazing. Even when I don't measure out the spices exactly I can't mess it up- it always is delicious and everyone who eats it- even people who don't like apple pie- loves it!!!

Too much spice for my taste. Used another recipe for pie crust.

Hurray! The first apple pie I ever made that I didn't through in the trash. I have to confess though, I didn't add all the spices that the recipe called for. I was making this for people who wanted a simple, basic apple pie so I only added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I agree with others that the crust wasn't easy to work with, but it was a good crust. I also think that the 1/4 cup of flour made the filling too thick--3 Tbsp. would had been enough.

I couldn't stop eating the raw apples either! This pie was delicious! This was my first apple pie ever and there wasn't any left after my first thanksgiving!

Very nice (and easy!) pie. The only problem I have is not eating all the spice-coated apples raw.

TRY THIS PIE! I am someone who always reads the reviews before trying a recipe and this pie was super. Iloved the spices, this pie has put me on a mace kick - the flavor is so perfect. I didn't use the pie crust listed because I don't have a food processor but, I used the thin butter pie crust recipe from this site, only I added mace. The crust and filling were a breeze to make and filled my home with a warm delightful scent.

I've been searching high and low for this recipe for the past year, and nearly jumped for joy when I found it. I'd been making this pie since it was originally published in Bon Appetit back in '94, but lost the recipe when I moved - horrors!!! This pie has been a huge hit with everyone who's eaten it, and I knew I'd never find another recipe to compare with this one. I agree 100% with the cook who said that mace is your pie's best friend; don't be afraid of the spices in this recipe. The flavors are fabulous, and they keep the pie from being overly sweet (one of my main complaints about most apple pies). Enjoy!

With all of the warnings about the difficult pie crust, I approached this recipe with some trepidation. I actually thought the crust was one of the easiest ones I've ever handled. I added about 1 tsp more water than was called for, and rolled the crust out between sheets of waxed paper. It was great, and the filling was absolutely superb. This has become my new standard apple pie.

This is my favorite apple pie! Perfect in the fall and during the holidays with all the mace, nutmeg, etc. But if you are a purist and like straight-up apple pie with lots of apple flavor, then this isn't your pie. I make it with granny smith apples so it isn't too sweet. I have found that this pie tastes best a la mode (Haagen Dazs is my personal favorite). The crust is difficult to work with - a little dry, so I tend to add more water than called for - but the results are worth the effort.

I have been making this pie since 1994 and it is a showstopper EVERY SINGLE TIME. After serving it up, I have often been told that I should quit my job and open up a pie stand. My recommendation: don't skimp on the mace. It is your pie's best friend.

My husband and I spent Thanksgiving alone and what a disappointment! I wish I had everyone here to taste my first attempt of making a pie! Absolutely delicious! I am not a big fan of pies but this pie was, hands down, the best I have tasted. I didn't have mace on hand-so that was elimanated and I used store bought pie crust. Do not let the reviews about the crust deter you from making this pie, it will be a staple at our holiday dinners!

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving a number of times (my husband's not a pumpkln pie fan) and it's always a hit. Two notes: I never remember to buy mace, so I substitute allspice in the crust and for the amount in the filing. Also, I always use pippin apples, which stand up the best to the spices. The crust isn't a problem for me, but I never get too hyper over appearances - ice cream or whipped cream always tops it anyway.

As a beginner cook I found the pie crust exceptionally difficult to deal with. Was not too difficult to roll out but to get it into the pie pan without ripping was impossible. Have not had this problem with other pie crust recipes. Crust was exceptionally flaky but it's just too hard to work with. The spicing is a little strong but overall my boyfriend and I liked it better than the usual apple pie. I believe the allspice is the problem so will reduce the amount by 1/2 next time.

Fabulous Apple Pie! I found the combination of spices to be a wonderful addition to the apples and not at all overpowering. My family and friends loved it! Would definately make this again

This recipe is fantastic but it is easy to overdue the spices. The first time I made this pie it was perfect. The second time I made it the crust was too flaky and fell apart and I accidentally used twice as much of the spices. I think I was spaced out that day. Under normal conditions this is a multidimensional pie with subtle nuances. It is more robust because it calls for spices other than the standard cinnamon and nutmeg.

I thought the spices were too overpowering in this recipe. I prefer a more simple, cinnamon and sugar apple pie.

My family went nuts over this pie, especially my dad, who's pretty picky about his desserts. The crust was a bit tricky, but the suggested leaf cutouts came out beautifully. It did brown more quickly than I expected, so I ended up covering it loosely with foil about halfway through. Granny Smiths are the way to go, and I did like the bit of mace in the crust.

Too spicy, you lose the flavor of the apples in all of the spice. I did use a pre-made pie crust - thankfully or the spices would have been even more overwhelming.

Rating: 3
Good easy recipe for a great tasting pie. However, I found that after tossing the spice, flour and apples together, a liquid-y mixture collected at the bottom of the apple mixture while I was preparing the crust-might be better to strain that liquid off before laying it on the crust.

This was the first time I made an apple pie and Iwas so pleased with compliments I received from family members. This was a fantastic pie, the crust was very flaky and the pie was very tasty. I would definitely make this one again. And it's simple too. Just be careful when you roll out the crust, sometimes it sticks and tears apart.

wonderful pie and easy to make (i used ready-made crust and it was great). my father, an apple pie afficonando, said it was a bit sweet (i think cause i used a sweeter apple, golden delicious), but, even so, w/ the spices and everything, the best apple pie he's eaten. everyone else raved, too.

After assorted levels of apple pie success at Thanksgiving time, this recipe really came through and was right on. Personally, I used macoun apples, and premade crust, but the spices are really the star. Best part, the leftovers taste better and better with each day!

Definitely a good apple pie, but I personally will scrap the mace in the crust the next time around. This crust recipe, incidentally, is one of the first I've ever had any degree of success with. Rolls out nicely, doesn't crumble.

If you love apple pie this is it. The crust is a little hard to work with but worth the extra effort. All the reviews are enough to want to give it a try.

This was a great pie. I made it for Thanksgiving, and my family loved it. I love the fact that it was so easy to make. Here's a tip, make it the night before. It tastes better when you let it sit for a while.

Excellent apple pie. Pie had the tartness of the apples, a touch of sweetness and wonderful spice flavor. My very picky kids wanted to eat the leftovers for breakfast! Yum.

The recipe for pastry was well-done, it came out nice and flaky. I used Granny Smith apples to make this very nice pie, so it was not too sweet. It was huge hit. This pie is actually better the next day.

I have been making this pie exclusively when I want apple pie. It is very simple (especially if made with a pre-made pie crust) and the spices make it more of an 'adult' dish. I think that all the spices set it one step above more traditional apple pie recipes.
