This is the greatest, fastest, and easiest recipe for guacamole! I omit the garlic, and add a little salt, and pepper to taste instead. I get requests from friends to make this recipe. Amazing!

Don't do the cumin! I just tried it and it changes the taste by covering up the avocado. This simple recipe is the best, add a little mayo, it compliments the avocado instead of overbearing it. I did the jalepeno, and it's good too

This is the perfect guacamole 'base'. You can definitely play with the ratios and make additions - I added a seeded jalapeno and cut back on the lime juice, and it was fantastic. It's delicious as is, but what a great opportunity to see what your culinary inspiration gets you.

So good! I put the avocados in the blender then added the onion, garlic and lime juice and continued to add more lime juice until I got a nice smooth consistency. I added a little cumin, too, to balance the extra lime. I omitted the tomatoes cuz I had salsa as well, seemed overkill. Best guac ever!

MMMMMM. Added minced jalepeno. Skipped the garlic. An excellent basic recipe, and the closest I've come to duplicating the recipe a dear friend used to make me way back when. Good stuff.

This is a great guac. recipe. I used white onion in place of the red and omitted the tomato only because I did not have any on hand. I wouldn't change a thing but I will definately use the tomato next time I make it.

I actually forgot to add the garlic but it tasted great without it. I also used the juice of a whole lime and added cilantro. I got many compliments on this dip!

I took the previous cooks advice and added 1 more avacado, doubled the garlic, added cilantro and some salt. Could also use a bit of finely diced jalapeno, but not an absolute. This is simple, quick and very good! Just make sure the avacados are ripe.

This is the gold standard. My kids and their friends are devouring it now. The lime, and simplicity, make it taste perfectly.

Great recipe but I would add the salt slowly as it can over-power the dish. When using the food processor, it yields a guacamole that is exceptionally smooth. I've also made it using a fork to mash the avacado and that looks a lot more like what you'd get in a Southwestern restaurant. Both ways taste great, it just depends on how you wish to present it. I add Blairs Death Sauce for the heat.

At last, a guacamole recipe that let's the avocado shine through. I cut back on the lime juice also, and used an extra avocado as I had three on hand. A wonderful blend of simple flavors. Good guac does'nt need seventeen ingredients!

Very good! Based on previous reviews, I added a bit less lime juice. I also added a splash of tabasco sauce, then seasoned generously with salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again and add cilantro next time.

This recipe is very good as is, but even better spiced up w/ minced jalapeno and chopped fresh cilantro. Perfect for summer.

I used a bit more garlic and needed a heavy hand with the salt. It is very easier, but I miss the bite you get from serrano peppers in an authentic recipe. Keep the pit in the guac to preserve!

Great no frills guac. I used sweet onion and soy & flaxseed tortilla chips for dipping - yummy and healthy!

Much too much lime juice.

I threw this together with very inexact quantities of the ingredients but the flavors combined beautifully. My husband and I don't always agree on guacamole recipes but we definitely think this one is a keeper!

What a wonderful recipe! Perfect blend of flavors. I did put in a bit more garlic, but I always do that. Oh, and I used Florida avocados from my friend's tree. Anyway, this recipe is an absolute winner!

Very easy and good too. I added cilantro but decreased the tomato and onion to about 2 teaspoons combined. It was just right for my taste. I'll make it again, often.

Easy recipe. To make it even easier, place the onion, garlic and lime juice in the food processor and chop. Add tomato and avocado and pulse to a proper consitency.

Too much lime juice..if you are making it right away, don't use any. I would cut it in half if making it ahead.

Great as it is, but adding a little cilantro would make it perfect. Will definitely make this again. So easy.

Excellent, great insde tacos! I would suggest a little extra onion and garlic, you also need to be generous with salt and pepper.

This recipe is perfect just as it is. If you want to stretch it a little, add some sour cream. If anything, it makes it better.

Very good...made it for our Oscar party last night. I think it does need more red onion and garlic, though.

Rating: 3
I made this for a party of 6. It's great if you get all the ingredients ready and mash it up in front of the guests. However, I did think that the lime made it too sour, but nobody else seemed to think so. Overall, an easy and yummy dish!

I thought this recepie was very good and I did a small change to give it a little x-tra zest. I took out the tomates and in its place added a small can of diced tomatoes with green chilie peppers and cilantro. Perfect and quickly gobbled up!!

Simple and perfect! I added a dash of Tabasco sauce to give it a kick since I had no chili peppers. Enjoy!

I love making guacamole. I add a couple of things. First of all, I squeeze 1/4 of an orange into this salad. Also I like to add a couple of tablespoons of FIRE-ROASTED salsa. This kind of salsa can be found in specialty stores. Although I do not care for cilantro, it is a favorite among my family.
