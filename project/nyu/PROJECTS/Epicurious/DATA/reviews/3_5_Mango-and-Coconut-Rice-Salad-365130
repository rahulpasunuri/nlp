Amazing! I didn't have red rice so I used brown, wild rice and bulgur instead. Turned out delicious. It is surprising and this is a keeper!

Enjoyed this salad as is - served it with grilled shrimp and it was a nice combination. Really good for you and keeps in the fridge for days.

I couldn't find Camargue red rice but used Bhutanese Red Rice instead. I added boneless skinless chicken thighs pan fried in peanut oil and seasoned with thai pepper garlic hot sauce. The recipe was a bit dry over all, I added the garlic pepper sauce and rice vinegar as a dressing.

This recipe is a great side dish to any meal but I would say that it needs a dressing. I made a dressing with rice wine vinegar, fresh cilantro, fresh garlic, olive oil and a pinch of salt. This really made the difference and it was a huge hit!

Delicious. Very fresh and flavourful, and filling for a salad. I was unable to obtain "Thai basil" but I used I guess what you would call 'regular' basil and it turned out great still. I will definitely make it again; the colors are beautiful - interesting dish all around.
