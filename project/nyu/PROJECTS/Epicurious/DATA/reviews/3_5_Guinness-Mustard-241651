Was good, but tastes just like flavored gourmet mustards I can buy in the store.

Delicious. Served on St. Patrick's Day with corned beef & rye bread from a local deli topped with sharp cheddar cheese and the pickled cabbage from "Corned Beef Sandwiches with Pickled Cabbage" from Bon Appetit March 2011.

This is a good addition to the traditional St. Paddy's day meal, as well as on sandwiches or at thanksgiving with the turkey.

Simple, savory, and just different enough for diners to rave about it. EASY, too.

This is great stuff. The very best thing about it, is that one must not waste the rest of the can of Guiness.

Made this yesterday and it was wonderful. Guests ate it ALL!

An excellent mustard for just about any use! It was great on corned beef as well as my turkey sandwiches the next day.
