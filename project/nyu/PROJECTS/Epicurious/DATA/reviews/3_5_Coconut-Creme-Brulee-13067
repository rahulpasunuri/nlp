This has been my standard creme brulee recipe since 1995. It's exceptional and the texture comes out perfectly every time. I leave out the coconut entirely or substitute raspberries or add a flavored liqueur. Just make sure that the custard is set. I sometimes have to cook it longer than suggested.

it was ok, not great. I halved the recipe; maybe that was the reason for less than stellar results?

It´s very bad

Really good and easy! Remember to crumble the shredded coconut after toasting and only bake until *just set* and it will come out perfectly. I'll definitely make this one again.

Simply delicioso! The coconut gives it a different twist. We bought the blow torch and had fun preparing the dessert. We're hooked!

Yum!! One of the best creme brulees I've ever tasted....I broiled the top and it caramelized in under 2 minutes.

I did not have a vanilla bean, so I substituted 1 Tbs vanilla extract. I also substituted coconut milk for the milk. It was wonderful and everyone LOVED it!!! Use a blowtorch if possible instead of putting it under the broiler.

Delicious, rich, and big hit with guests. Easy, too.

This is the best creme brulee I have ever tasted. I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. The best part is you must make it ahead and thus there are no worries during dinner.

Results are a bit too custardy and not quite as light as I prefer.

Fantastic recipe that can easily be modified. Try not using coconut but adding a few fresh raspberrys and blackberry. MUST use blowtorch !!

We have impressed many guests with this recipe. I regularly make it without the coconut with the same amazing results.
