Way too much vinegar for my taste! Did not work at all for my husband and I.

Good for vegetarians, but definitely missing the meat from traditional ma po tofu (one of my favorite dishes!). Epicurious actually has an excellent "with meat" recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ma-Po-Tofu-103565) and I'd recommend that over this but it was still yummy.

Wonderful and quick! I'm looking forward to cooking this for my Chinese boyfriend. I think he'll be very impressed.

Extremely impressed with this recipe! It tastes JUST like my (Chinese) mom's home cooking... delicious topped with chopped green onions as a garnish. Overall, DELICIOUS and exactly what I was looking for! It doesn't taste like Ma Po tofu, really, but it's delicious nonetheless... definitely the closest I've gotten that wasn't from a restaurant. Modifications I made: -I used a mix of portobello and crimini mushrooms because I forgot to soak my shiitakes and I like them soaked for at least 3 hours. It was delicious with fresh mushrooms! -Topped it with green onions. -If served with rice, it could use a bit more soy sauce or salt, depending on how salty the black beans and broth you're using are. -I used honey instead of cane sugar. -A bit of red pepper flakes make it even hotter!

Hadn't made this recipe in a few years. I didn't have stock or Szechuan peppercorns, but it still turned out very good. I added 2 diced carrots to the stir fry and will probably throw in more veggies in the future. Also, I used fresh shiitakes vs dried.

This recipe just didn't work for us.

This was a very nice recipe. I used fresh shiitakes and a few extra mushrooms I had on hand but otherwise made according to the directions. It was flavorful and had a nice texture. To my tastebuds, this wasn't a four-fork recipe but think it would be for plenty of other people. Try it if it sounds interesting to you -- it wasn't a lot of work.

We substituted snap peas and carrots for the mushrooms. Wonderful aroma. Superb flavors...

Very good and tasty.

This was excellent, even though we didn't have the black beans or szechuan peppercorns. I used the soaking water from the mushrooms instead of vegetable broth. Used extra-firm tofu. Had to substitute umeboshi vinegar because we were all out of rice vinegar. Omitted the 1/4 tsp coarse salt to compensate.

I strongly suggest medium-firm tofu or maybe even firm. The silken/soft stuff gets soupy way too easily.

This has become an absolute family favorite. Even my dedicated carnivour of a husband asks for this again and again. I could not find fermented black beans, so I used a spicy black bean sauce and it works out just fine. Serve over pad thai noodles with bok choy on the side. YUM!!!!!

Delish. Quick. Asian. Easy. Healthy.

This was delicious and quite easy. I substituted zucchini and tomatoes for the shitake mushrooms. It tasted just as nice as Zen Palate's 'tofu delight' if you happen to know of/like that dish. I will definitely make this again, may try other vegetables next time.

Yes. This is the elusive asian taste you are looking for.

Wow. This dish is magnificent. It's even better than any Ma Po tofu I've had in a restaurant (and I order it wherever I find it). I wish I could give it five forks. My only reservation (and it may simply be that the leeks I buy here in NZ are more mature than the ones typically available in the US) was the leeks being a little tough. I'll just peel off a couple extra layers next time. For tofu novices, make sure you get nice, fresh tofu, not the stuff in those foil lined cardboard boxes.

i doubled the amount for pretty much every that would boost the flavor of the dish. i also doubled the mushrooms and used white and chinese (cheaper). i chopped my mushrooms very small. it was awesome! you will not miss the meat.

Delicious! We doubled the sauce and added broccoli and red peppers and put it over rice noodles. ill be on our plates again in the very near future.

I used the black bean and garlic paste I found at Ralph's and grated the ginger. It was easy and delicious.

I don't typically prepare vegan recipes but this one is excellent for those who think they always have to have meat! One change that I would make is to have a bit more spice added. The flavors are good but not too much depth. I think next time I make this I will add extra chili sauce and ginger. This dish makes a great leftover.

Rating: 3
Very good and flavorful. Could use more soy sauce.

Oddly enough, I liked this recipe better without the black beans. Accidentally forgot to add the beans the night I made this dish, but added half the beans to the leftovers the next day. I had rinsed them well before chopping, but they were too salty for my taste. Perhaps I had the wrong product, but it is what I was given at the Asian market.

Rating: 3
I've made this with the shiitakes and with pork, and I think I prefer the flavor of the shiitakes. It's a pretty good dish with lots of flavor. You hardly notice it's vegan. I like to add a healthy bit of scallions at the end, and I increase the amounts of both the black beans and the chili-garlic.

Rating: 4
You know, midway through making this, I realized that I was making a vegan recipe, which I think is one of the only times I've ever made a vegan main course. Well, this is a great way to start - the dish is absolutely fantastic, it's hard to believe it's healthy. I followed others' guidance and only put 14 oz of tofu in, I used firm because I prefer it, and I could only find bean paste, so I dumped some random amount in. I didn't add carrots, but if you cut up matchstick-sized carrots and added them in at the same time as the leeks, I bet it would be really good and even healthier.

Excellent! Spicy. I prefer using hard tofu for more consistency, and it turned out great!

I have made this dish a few times, so yummy! I like to add roasted peanuts and use the water from the mushrooms (filtered through a paper towel) mixed with a little bit of the beef flavored "better than bullion".

Thie recipe was excellent - easy to make, deliscious and you don't need to change a thing. Not the most inexpensive meal to make but worth it.

I made this using 3 tbls of the pastes (fermented black bean & garlic and Vietmanese Chili & garlic) about 10 additional mushrooms (just because I had them around), a bit more ginger and 2 cups of stock, which I let simmer down to a reasonable amount. It's really quite good. It tastes very similar to that which I find in local resaturants (except I think they use silken tofu, I just used soft - drained & pressed). The shiitakes are a good substitute. I keep expecting to taste pork, but the mushrooms have an appealing lightness. Really no need to add salt; the stock and the pastes have enough salt in them.

Rating: 3
I substituted hot bean sauce and it was still a great dish. Will make it again in the future.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic dish that is a staple in our house. One trip to an asian market and you can pick up the black beans, dried mushrooms (I just use chinese mushrooms, not shitaake, which are fine too),vinegar, etc. that you may not have on hand; they will keep (beans in freezer) indefinitely and this can be thrown together quickly for an excellent and healthy chinese meal that pairs with any steamed or sauteed veggie and rice.

This dish has joined the ranks of other staples that I can make with relatively little fuss or advance preparation. I like it because the flavours are robust and wholesome. I add bok choy for colour and texture.

This dish was so-so. Too much chili-garlic tasting for our tastes. Not enough depth. Tastes like hot and sour soup poured over tofu and mushrooms. Nothing special. There are other tofu recipes worth trying.

Rating: 3
This was very good. We made the following alterations: 1)used firm tofu 2)placed tofu b/twn paper towels w/ a weight to get extra moisture out 3) used a mixture of fresh shiitake, emini, oyster, chanterelles and portabellas instead of dried shiitake. The next time we make it, we might marinate the tofu a bit before adding to the sauce.

We love this receipe since it is so easy. Serve it with brown rice made in a rice cooker and stir fried water spinach and garlic (kong xin cai - for those who understand Chinese). I usually decrease the tofu as others have, increase the chilli since we like it spicy and increase the mushrooms. I used chicken stock. I also used a yellow onion which I had on hand instead of leek and it worked just fine.

I will be making this again and again. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable. I couldn't find fermented black beans so I substituted 3 Tbsp. Black Bean Sauce with Chili for the 2 tsp. of chili-garlic sauce and the 2 Tbsp. fermented black beans. The only change I will make next time is to add 50% more mushrooms. I've had traditional Ma-Po Bean Curd in first rate Chinese restaurants and this recipe is just as good, though different. A great vegetarian dish for non-vegetarians.

This was fantastic. The best Chinese dish I've had since I left San Francisco. I took other reviewers suggestions and used only 14oz of tofu, and found it to be quite adequate. Also, I used the water from the mushrooms in place of vegetable broth. Served with broccoli spears with garlic sauce for a great Chinese meal.

Rating: 3
Yum! I actually followed the recipe except with half the tofu. It was great! I loved the ratio of tofu to sauce. The only change I would make, would be next time to cut the ginger in half--it was very gingery. I couldnt find fermented black beans so I bought Kikkoman black bean sauce and it worked out fine.

I think this recipe is excellent. I have already made it twice in just a couple of months.

All seemed well until I added the tofu - 28 ounces? Half was probably enough. I'll try again with chicken, but only because I have a bag of fermented black beans and their flavor is interesting.

Very tasty and easy! Instead of using vegetable stock I just used the water that the mushrooms soaked in.

This dish was very easy and quick to make once the mushrooms were soaked and sliced. Very yummy for such a small amount of effort.

I made this for a friend who likes both mushrooms and tofu, and we both thought it was fabulous. I couldn't find fermented beans, but I just used fermented bean paste. The dish had just the right amount of spicy heat, too. Next time I'll try it with firmer tofu, or maybe chicken!

My dining companion rated this 3 forks; I'd have given it 2 1/2, not because of the taste which was delicious, but because I felt there was too much sauce for the tofu and mushrooms. Also, I'd omit the 1/4 teaspoon of salt in the sauce. I made two substitutions because I didn't plan ahead. They were: scallions for leeks, and fresh crimini mushrooms rather than dried shitakes. I realized the later would be better and next time will use those. Overall, a good tofu dish, new to us, and with some adjustments, I'll make it again.

Since I am the only one in my family who likes tofu, I substituted the tofu for chicken strips that I sauted in oil. It was a tremendous hit, only complaint was that there wasn't enough:) !!!!

I know it's a veg dish, but i had a bit of pork on hand, so used that and 3/4 amount of mushrooms. a little different from what i grew up with, but not bad at all. Love the way it smells. try the original sometime... make it spicy!

WOW, fantastic! I'm always looking for new vegetarian tofu dishes since I always seem to make it Thai style. Since I couldn't find them either, I substituted the fermented black beans with chinese black bean sauce. I also added a few fresh green beans out of my fridge and served it with brown basmati-cilantro rice. By the way, it is even better the next day, and I didn't think that was possible!

This was great! (Couldn't find the asian-fermented beans either) I used the firm tofu so it stayed nice and intact when I tossed everything together. Definitely will make is again. YUM!

The asian fermented beans proved impossible to find, however plain black beans were substituted with an obvious loss of taste. However the dish was very good, and flavorful w/o them. I served over brown rice...VERY good!!
