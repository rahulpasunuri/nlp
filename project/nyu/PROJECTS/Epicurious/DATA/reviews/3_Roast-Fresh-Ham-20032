What's up with the format of this recipe listing? It's all screwed up. I made a fresh ham and this is the only Epicurious recipe I could find that called for a fresh ham. I didn't make the mustard, but I did do the rest of it, just winging it with the amount of sage, garlic, and wine. And I added salt and pepper. Banked on 20 minutes per pound, but I had it in a roaster and I think every time I opened it to baste the meat it lost too much heat b/c I had it in there a long time and it was still a little undercooked and I had to keep cooking it. I had it at 300 degrees and I probably ended up cooking the 7-lb ham for almost four hours. But again, this was in a roaster and I opened it every half hour or so, so it probably lost too much heat each time.
