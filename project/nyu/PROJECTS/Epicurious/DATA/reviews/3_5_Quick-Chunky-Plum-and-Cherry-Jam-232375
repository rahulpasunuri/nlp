Very easy to make and great with butter on toast. Mine took a little longer to cook - about 15 extra minutes. Not too sweet. I will be serving this as a side with a pork roast and roasted butternut squash and I think the combo will be excellent!

1st time making jam. Easy and delicious. The other day I had it with toast and brie. It was epic.

I'm not sure it is fair of me to review this recipe because I changed it significantly, which I don't normally do the first time. However, I did not have dark plums or sweet cherries. What I did have were golden plums and sour cherries. I tasted it after it cooked a bit and it was amazing; however, since I wanted to can it, I added extra sugar (1 cup) and 1 Tbsp lemon juice and a handful more cherries (to balance the extra sugar and provide the necessary acidity to can it safely). It still remained amazing.
