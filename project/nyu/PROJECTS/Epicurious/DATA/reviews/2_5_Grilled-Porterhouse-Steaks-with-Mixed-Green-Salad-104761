If there is five feet of snow and porterhouse steaks are on sale, this is the way to go. The method of cooking them here turns out exactly medium rare meat. But give me the outside grill almost any day! As for the salad dressing, my family wouldn't eat it, I did but hated it. It was a fishy gloppy mess even with the water added.
