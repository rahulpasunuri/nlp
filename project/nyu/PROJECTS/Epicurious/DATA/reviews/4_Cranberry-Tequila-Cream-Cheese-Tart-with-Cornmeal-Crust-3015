My grocery did not have any fresh cranberries so I used whole berry canned sauce and left out the sugar for the topping. Probably not as attractive, but still tasty. It was a hit with my family and friends - I will definitely make it again at Thanksgiving.

THis was great. I used a little bit more cream cheese and did not have cranberries so followed the cranberry part but substituted fresh straberries. I did not put it on the tart I served it on the side. I will make again for sure. it was excellent.

I substitute cranberry concentrate for the oj in the glaze and use Grand Marnier as the cointreau. Also helps to use top shelf silver tequila. Always a big hit! Requires a lot of prep time, though.

Made this for visiting family before Thanksgiving. We all thought it was excellent. To be disappointed with the results it has to be the cook. Beautiful presentation.

I had such hope to make this pie the excape to all the pumpkin and pecan Thanksgiving pies. Not sure what a possibly did wrong. The filling tasted very buttery and off. The orangeyness was fine. The Cranberry sauce was classic and tasty.The crust a little dense but I think the filling is mainly what threw it all off. I used a local brand of cream cheese but it wasn't that different. I ended up throwing the tart out. Sorry for the low rating, it was my only failure this Thanksgiving but it was pretty to look at on the buffet.

Mom made this for Thanksgiving and we found it a bit disappointing. Couldn't really taste the cranberry at all due to the overpowering orange peel which no one here was fond of. The cornmeal crust was nice.

I used this recipe in a cooking contest where the theme ingredient was cream cheese. It was fairly easy to make although I did substitute mascarpone for half of the cream cheese in the filling. It's definitely a winner - I got first place.

The cornmeal crust holds together well and is absolutely delicious...a very unique addition to quiches and desserts. I used it for the "Fresh Corn Quiche" found elsewhere on this site.

This recipe is unique and special. The cornmeal crust is wonderful, and better than a flour crust. The orange peel gives a heavenly flavor. The cheese layer was a little narrow, so I made a recipe and a half of this layer....and turned out well. (maybe a little less powered sugar would be beneficial). My only criticism is that the cranberry layer did not cook firm for me -- probably because I used frozen cranberries and did not thaw first before adding them to sauce -- this made it watery and sloppy -- but the taste was great nonetheless.

This desert is outstanding - looks impressive and tastes just as good. I had never made a pie crust before and had to substitute rice flour for the white flour because I have celiac. Even then, it turned out perfectly.

I made this for a Christmas open house. It looks beautiful and fresh, and it won rave reviews(especially since all the other deserts were the usual chocolate & heavy holiday stuff.) Definitely a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a delicious alternative to pumpkin pie. Everyone loved it and thought it was beautiful as well.

Very special, and very very good. The flavor combinations are unique and won rave (and I mean RAVE) reviews from an entire party. The cornmeal crust was easy to work with, and held up beautifully even after hours of refrigeration. Each piece lifted perfectly. The recipie is not difficult, but does require planning over time to get all of the elements together in the right way. Worth it.
