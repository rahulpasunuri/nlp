Of course, brown the sage! I did it in butter; the flavor is fantastic and it crumbles in easily. The pancetta made the breadcrumbs exceptional. All the flavors together made an absolutely delicious dish.

Terrific. Easy and a vegetable a little out of the ordinary. I fried the sage which mellowed the flavor and allowed it to be crumbled into very small pieces. Husband and daughter both cleaned their plates!

Very good. Love the yam and bread crumb techniques. I used 3 strips of regular (lower sodium) bacon and probably made 1.5 cups of bread crumbs--with plenty left over. I used all the fresh sage left in my garden, just shy of what was called for, but it needed more. We liked the simple techniques and served with lightly steamed broccoli. Will definitely make again. I wonder what other fresh herbs might work?

We made a few minor changes - try frying the sage first in the pork fat, then crumble in! Great texture and mellows out the sage a bit. We'll make this again for sure - the 22 month old little man loved it!

I made this in hopes of having a healthy dinner and it was not only that but it was delicious. The fish on mashed yams isn't a combo I'd ever try on my own so I wasn't sure but it ended up being great! I'll be making this again. :)

This was remarkably easy and turned out delicious. I was dubious reading the ingredients, but gave it a try anyway and was happily surprised. The flavors are complex and very complimentary. I cheated and used bacon because I didn't have pancetta. If you do the same, I will advise frying it in strips and crumbling it afterward. You will want it tiny.

This was very good but not out of this world. Great way to cook yams. Fish was nice and the bread crumbs were nice. Got a good review from my partner which normally makes it a 4 in my book but just felt it could use something to add a little more pizazz to the flavour.

This was fantastic. I didn't get pancetta, so I made the breadcrumbs with bacon, which was great. The grease/bread/sage/bacon balance was absolutely perfect. The yams were super tasty, and now I will always use the microwave trick! The breadcrumbs were good on the fish, but they were even better on the porkchops I made two nights later to use up the leftovers, and I don't think I can have sweet potatoes without butter, sage, and breadcrumbs from now on.

I've made many recipes off Epicurious and this is probably my least favorite. The breadcrumbs were delicious, however the dryness mixed with the fish was not at all complimentary. I think I'd try this recipe again, but next time I will bread the fish before cooking rather than serving the breadcrumbs on the side.

probably would have gotten 4 stars if i had made it properly, so i went with 4, because even without the pancetta, subbing butter with oil and light butter and fresh breadcrumbs with plain progresso breadcrumbs it was pretty darn good, and super duper easy.

This was absolutely amazing! Didn't have pancetta on hand so I used bacon instead, but it was still really good.

This really was a great little recipe! A fun twist on making fish for dinner & a great way to get the vits of sweet potatoes into my kiddos! Really delish!

This was super easy to make and very good! I served with spicy black beans and my boyfriend loved it!

"Greatest fish recipe ever." Direct quotation from my husband, who would typically go for the default setting, which means salmon. Yams and bread-crumb crust delicious on Night Two with freshly sauteed talapia (from frozen). I even made the mistake of leaving the pancetta-crumb mixture out on the counter for 20 hours. It was still good, and best yet -- dog couldn't reach it.

Delicious and very easy to pull together on a weeknight. The different textures of fish, crispy breadcrumbs, and smashed yams were very nice.

Very nice and easy recipe. I liked the unique twist on ingredients with fish - sage and bacon don't seem like the most obvious combination for Tilapia but it was really quite nice. The texture of the breadcrumbs were amazing on top of the fish. So much flavor for so few ingredients!

This was an exceptional recipe. Fast, easy delicious with an unusual combination of ingredients. Followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.I served this with roasted asparagas. Great plate presentation. To those of you who worry abouta little butter, lighten up.

Absolutely excellent.

I thought this was good and would give it 3 1/2 stars. The yams turned out really well in the microwave! My local supermarket didn't have Tilapia, so I used snapper instead and it worked well. I would use less breadcrumbs next time because I found it a little dry with that amount on top. Will be making it again.

This is so good and so easy. Proscuitto and sage and 5 other ingredients...who'd have thought so much flavor? The mash could use some loosening, so we tried to stick with "healthy" rating and added a couple of spoonfuls of low fat Greek-style yogurt - nice. Also, leftover breadcrumbs are a GREAT breakfast sprinkled over a hard-boiled egg!

Great weeknight dinner. I enjoyed the combination of ingredients. The entire meal took me less than 30 minutes. I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good. I think all the flavors came together nicely but in the end it seemed a little dry. Next time I'll pair it with some type of sage cream sauce to make it a little more interesting.

Microwaving the yams is genius. I really do like this recipe because its almost like a deconstructed fried fish, you get the crunchy, but not the heavy batter, this can be even healthier if the fish was baked or steamed. When you make this, make sure to fry up some extra pancetta because you will want to snack on it while cooking.

I made this for my family last night--it was EXCELLENT. Some modifications- I used bacon (chopped) instead of pancetta (saved cost and a trip to the store). Mashed the yams with just a pat of butter 2 tbsp of brown sugar, cinnamon and 1/3 cup of skim milk. I made a fresh romaine salad on each plate and then put the tilapia and mashed potatoes right in the center of the salad (dressed with balsamic). A nice touch wouldv'e been served with a walnut or raisin ciabatta bread...it was delicious. Also, I made extra mashed yams to save for ravioli's tonight.

Outstanding! We really like Tilapia and the Pancetta crumb topping, mashed sweet potatoes, sage put it over the top! Served with buttered green beans and a simple blood orange salad seasoned with a fig balsamic vinegar.

This was quite good. I used applewood smoked bacon instead of pancetta, and baked the yams since I had the time. My 2 year old gobbled it up (the fish and the yams). Braised kale on the side was a perfect match. I would try it with a different fish next time, maybe halibut, since the tilapia was a little boring. But overall a great weeknight dinner!
