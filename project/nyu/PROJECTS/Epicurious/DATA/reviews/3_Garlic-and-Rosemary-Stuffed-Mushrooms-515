Solidly fine. Easy, quick, good way to use up ingredients you have in excess--that's the only reason I'd make these again. The concept is a stuffed mushroom that you can memorize the "recipe" and the results are totally middle-of-the-road fine.

I saute the garlic in olive oil and butter. Then add parsley and a dash or two of Worcesteshire and spoon this sauce into mushroom caps.I leave out rosemary as my family does not like it. Sprinkle mushrooms with Janes crazy salt and bake. Serve over a lightly buttered, toasted round of sourdough. The diners turn the mushrooms over on their toasts and all that juice is soaked up in the bread. Great supper with a salad. I know everyone will say this is not the original recipe but I suppose my point is serve the juice-filled mushrooms over the sourdough toast rather than putting the bread in the mushrooms.

A good, simple recipe that can easily be converted into a vegan dish. Used olive oil instead of butter and used a but more than they called for in order to get the crumbs to stay together.

I thought this was delicious. I used just a smidgeon more olive oil and butter when sauteeing the mushroom stems, and added some grated trugole cheese to the stuffing mixture at the end. This is a new favorite comfort food on a chilly autumn night!

Rather disappointing, although my friends seemed to enjoy them. The roasted garlic did not blend easily into the breadcrumbs and really overpowered the mushrooms. This recipe taught me that I just don't like roasted garlic that much--maybe if you are a fan you will like this recipe more than I did.

I agree with some of the other reviewers - it needs something else. I made it twice, and added some asiago. Lemon juice does help,as does a bit of butter. It was just OK.

I made this for a dinner party--because so many reviews talked about the stuffing as dry, I halved the amount of bread crumbs, substituted the remainder with shredded asiago cheese and added more olive oil. They were still a bit crumbly, but the tastes were very good.

This was really good. I think my mushrooms were too small, as I have a lot of filling left. I bet it will be good on eggplant or in risotto. Great starter. I will make this again.

This is one of my favorite stuffed mushroom recipes. I squeeze a little lemon juice on each one before serving to add a little zing.

I made these for a dinner party this past week and I had mixed reviews. I had to add about 2 tablespoons of butte, not 1 teaspoon as the recipe calls for. Also, I felt it needed something else (such as cheese) to hold together the breadcrumbs. It is an o.k recipe but it could be enhanced.

I found these to be the best stuffed mushrooms I have had. Flavors all blended together to create a wonderful appetizer, and the preparation was no problem at all. Overall, I will surely make this recipe again.

I had some trouble with this recipe. I added more butter, because otherwise it was way too dry. I nearly didn't even bother putting it in the oven because all was going so poorly, but I did and my guests did like them, as did I, but this recipe needs a serious make-over.

There are other, more interesting, stuffed mushroom recipes. These were bland and dry. When I took them out of the oven I thought I missed something, so looked back at the recipe and saw that everything was there. Use some other recipe. This one's not a keeper.

I thought this dish was delicious! I used cracker crumbs instead of the sourdough bread crumbs and it was easy and delicious, very moist. I also added in finely chopped scallions, onions, and crab meat. My husband loved them. The best part of our New Year's meal. Can't wait to make them again!

What a major disappointment. It was very dry and the taste of garlic was so overwhelming (and I love garlic!!!!!). There are a lot better recipes out there for stuffed mushrooms.

These mushrooms were very good. The tops cracked while baking though. I think this happened because I used traditional dry bread crumbs. Fresh bread crumbs would have had more moisture in them. Might experiment with a touch of onion next time too!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My friend said they were the best he has ever had. My nine year old son even loved them. Cant't wait to make them again!

Excellent recipe. I also added some sauteed chopped leeks and the result was wonderful. They are now a frequent request from my family!
