Made this for my husband's birthday party. Turned out fabulous. Would cut the semi-sweet chocolate ganache by 1/2 or 2/3 next time, just a drizzle is sufficient to jazz up the slices. Served it with fresh strawberries macerated with a little sugar. Take the dessert out of the freezer for 20 minutes before slicing. All the separate items turned out fine - follow the recipe exactly. The white chocolate mousse would make a fine dessert served with fruit. So would the meringue dipped in the semi-sweet chocolate ganache - a cookie of sorts.

In response to a couple of reviewers who mentioned that the ganache was to thin to be spreadable: From having made various ganaches in the past, my guess is that it has to do with how hot the cream/corn syrup mixture gets before adding in the chocolate. I have noticed that if one lets it simmer too long on the stove (the heavy cream and corn syrup), this ras=ises the temperature by sometimes a lot, and when you add the chocolate it sort of breaks down chemically. Even though you would think that cooling it down and refrigerating it might reverse the process, i think that once the chocolate breaks down chemically, it becomes "irreversible". I think the key is to let it reach a bare simmer before adding the choolate. This is just based on some experience but I'm sure others with more vast experience could maybe givee their opinion about whether my explanation is correct.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It wasn't difficult but a lot of steps for a dessert that should have been spectacular. The white chocolate glaze never set - even in the freezer for 2 days - it just kept sliding off. It was impossible to transfer to serving plate and decorate without having glaze dripping off and my freezer was a gooey mess. Tasted ok but too sweet for me. I think I would cut down the white chocolate in the mousse and glaze with chocolate ganache. I served with a cranberry coulis - quite tart - thank goodness!

I will make this again, but only for a very special occasion. My guests all raved, but we really liked it better when we had the leftovers the next day with another sauce, raspberry coulis that I had made for a different dessert! One guest thought the mousse was ice cream, which has me wondering if next time I make it I might take that shortcut.

AWESOM!!! Definetly start several days before. It can be finished and frozen several days ahead. One important item is that you need to apply the white ganache several times to coat the cake. Freeze between each coating. I made a second batch of white chocolate ganache so that I would have enough. Make several days ahead and take your time.

After all the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to taste this labor of love. Disappointing to me and my guests - and I'm sure I followed directions well. If I made this again, I would only use 4 egg whites for meringue. My meringues were too tall - at least 3/4 inch each. I would probably omit the hazelnuts in the meringue and simply toss chipped ones in with each layer. This would simplify the recipe a little. Then, I would half the amount of ganache - or less. I felt the chocolate overpowered the other subtler flavors (and I do love chocolate). I would also double the white chocolate mousse quantity. I used rum which I would do again. I quite liked the taste of the mousse, but it got lost in the other layers. So, I would use this recipe as a starting point, but not as is. Sorry.

The White Chocolate Ganache didn't get thick enough to coat the cake. The sauce ran off the sides - it was more of a drizzle consistency rather than a spready consistency. I followed the recipe but don't understand why it was too thin .... Can anyone tell me what could have caused this?

I made this dessert for a Christmas Eve party, and the guests were raving! It was a bit fussy to assemble, but well worth the effort. I will be adding this one to my dessert repetoire!

I have made this two years in a row for Christmas dinner. It works well to do it in stages and freeze in between. The change I made both times was to make just enough dark ganache to put on the two layers, then served the cake with a cranberry coulee instead of more chocolate. Very well received.

I've made this awesome creation three times for catered events. People rave. I think it is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Be sure to keep it frozen until right before you want to serve it--it's much easier to cut. It's involved to make, but definitely worth the effort.

It was delicious and great because you could make it well ahead of time. The meringue is a little tough to work with - but it was worth it. everyone loved it and a few people asked me for the recipe.

This was a big hit at Easter and kept very well in the freezer for a reappearance at another dinner party just a few weeks later. I will keep this recipe handy for future events!
