*This isn't really a "review" because I made an adapted version because my salmon wouldn't wrap well. I thought others might find it helpful in case they have that problem.* I attempted this recipe, but when I opened my smoked salmon I realized it was a fillet of smoked salmon! There was no way it would wrap around anything; it just flaked into pieces. I had to make something for a party, so, I decided to make a "sushi" wrap type of thing, using seaweed to wrap around the asparagus and salmon mixture. They turned out great!! I made the goat cheese mixture and also added all the salmon (flaked) right into it; I had to add extra cheese in order to get all the salmon to mix in (I did 3oz goat and 4 oz cream cheese), and then I also added extra red onions (about 1/4 C) instead of shallots (did some sauteed and some raw for zip), also added a little lemon juice, and lots of pepper. I did as others recommended by blanching the asparagus. To assemble, I cut the seaweed in 1.5 inch strips, cut the asparagus tops off at about 2 inches and then piped a strip of the cheese-salmon mixture onto the seaweed, place a piece of asparagus in the middle, and rolled up like a sushi roll. This was time consuming but they turned out really fun and modern looking, with the asparagus sticking out to top! I used terriyaki flavored seaweed and this definitely helped with the flavor. I tried with plain seaweed and they weren't as good. The salmon-cheese mixture turned out great...I will probably make it again as a dip for crackers, or to spread on baguette slices.

I am glad I doubled the recipe. A big hit. I also cooked the asparagus for 3 minutes then put in an ice bath. Added 1 pkg of lt. cream cheese and a bit of dill and black pepper. Also, instead of chopping asparagus I put 2 spears in each roll and rolled up/sliced like California rolls. Great presentation! Delicious and great that they can be prepped the night before. Give them a try!

Forgot one important note with my prior review. I also blanched the asparagus (see one of the other reviews) for 3 minutes but didn't bother peeling the stalks. Once it's chopped, who cares? Raw would have been too crunchy but blanched still had a good bite and the flavor came through in the filling. Raw probably would not permeate the cheese.

Made this for my wine club and it was a hit. Also made a recipe with cream herbed cheese on salmon wrapped around an asparagus stalk and this one won hands down. Good flavor, easy to make and very pretty with the chopped asparagus rolled in the salmon. It might not be ultra-gourmet but it sure meets the bill of an appetizer that can be made ahead, tastes delicious and has nice presentation. I will definitely make this again.

I served this recipe the first time on a white water rafting trip where it received rave reviews. I make it often and it continues to impress. It travels well in the plastic wrap before it is sliced and even freezes well.

I have not made this yet but I do see one major flaw...do not use RAW asparagus. Parboil until crispy tender THEN use in the roulade. a nice dill sauce accompaniment also would be nice or add a dollop of caviar!!

If you want to impress your friends, this is not the dish. It is good for at home family cooking or simple, not a gourmet party.

I love this recipe -- a perfect hor d'oeuvre for a summer meal or Sunday brunch. My only modification is layering the salmon and filling on fresh lavash and before rolling and slicing -- it extends the ingredients and makes the rolls easier to eat. I've also made versions with capers and chives that disappear just as quickly! My boyfriend will eat the leftovers for breakfast if I let him. (^__^)

I had smoked salmon in the fridge, and company coming for hors d'oeuvres, so I did an advanced search for recipes (hopefully with ingredients I already have). This is a winner! I didn't have the goat cheese, so I used softened cream cheese in place. We also tried adding sundried tomato tapenade. Excellent, both ways!

My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe! I did change it a bit being that I couldn't find larger sliced salmon or the shallots. I sauteed chopped garlic with some sweet onion in place of the shallots. We then spread it on the salmon...then stacked it on some low carb bread... then added some roasted red peppers. Each way we stacked it, it was delicious with a bottle of chardonay for a romantic evening on the deck. I will definitely make it again and look forward to any other versions of this recipe.

Huge hit at a recent party - one of the first appetizers to go first. I'll double the recipe next time. In addition to the lemon peel, I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the rolls right before serving.

The filling was very flavorful, and I too sauteed the asparagus with the shallots. The only thinly sliced salmon I could find was LOX and it was in small slices, so the presentation wasn't as great as it could have been. The lox looked raw, and several of my guests did not even try it. This was an expensive appetizer to make, and the leftovers did not keep well. I ended up throwing a large portion of it away.

Quick, easy and delicious. A real crowd pleaser!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Assembly was much easier than I thought it would be,kind of like rolling sushi but easier! The fact that it's a "make ahead" appetizer makes it great for parties. I agree with th reviewer below who suggests serving crackers with it. I also agree with the other reviewer who suggests sauteing the asparagus with the shallots. This is a staple in my home for dinner parties. Elegant and easy.

I bought the best ingredients I could find and was very displeased with this appetizer. It was bitter and much too strong tasting. It did not go over well with the people I shared it with.

So easy and so elegant! A big hit, too. I cooked the asparagus tips with the shallots for a minute or two. I thought the lemon zest might stand out too much but after 24 hours of refrigeration all the flavors blended together beautifully.

Very nice make ahead. This appetizer was very tasty and made a wonderful presentation. My guests loved it!

This is a very rich tasting - I think you need to serve bread or crackers with the pieces. Very attractive presentation.
