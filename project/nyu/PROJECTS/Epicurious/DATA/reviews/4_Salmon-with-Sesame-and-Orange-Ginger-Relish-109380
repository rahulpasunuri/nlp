Really good recipe, Surprising how the oranges come out really amazing. The salmon it self didin´t taste that much however it was really tender after marinating for 2 hrs. To be recomended

just finished eating this...it was fantastic,especially the orange relish. I would not change a thing,salmon steaks were on sale, great meal. Served with red and green cabbage slaw, elbow mac/tomato salad, which cooled the palate with all the ginger in this recipe...

this recipe is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! After trying to separate the orange sections (a huge waste of time), I opted to use a can of mandrine oranges that was recommended by others. Next time I'll make the relish within 1/2 hour of using. Mine was very limp and not crunchy! This would be delish with any fish.

Enjoyed this more than I expected. Marinated the salmon in a zippered bag to save washing one dish and only used half the filet since I wasn't sure we'd like this. Expected that I wouldn't like the relish but it is a very nice crunch with the tender fish. Not sure the orange sections added anything and might leave that out next time. This becomes our third-favorite salmon recipe behind blackened, and with jalapeno/lime/sour cream.

I made this for a dinner party. Yum! I followed the recipe mostly as written.... no red pepper flakes. The relish nicely complimented the salmon, it was a light, fresh dish. It was great as is. If I ever vary from the recipe, I may add mango instead of orange for the relish. Will become a standard!

I've been making this dish for years and as soon as wild salmon is in season, this is the first recipe I use. I was so excited to try it with a new sauce that I have recently discovered called Orange Ginger Zing from Hot Squeeze. WOW! it made this easy dish easier and explode with flavor. I hope everyone can find this delicious new sauce to use with this dish!

Searching for something unusual and, frankly, show-offy to do with a beautiful fillet of wild salmon for guests who all claimed to be on diets, I read the reviews here and thought this recipe would be perfect. I wish now I'd just served the fillet unadorned. The marinade added nothing and the sauce actually detracted from the fish - too peculiar a combination of unsubtle flavours that overwhelmed the delicacy of the salmon. Maybe this is for people who like condiments rather than fish - salmon lovers beware!

I made this for Easter Sunday a few years back and lost the recipe! I found it just in time for this Easter. My family has been demanding it, again, and it's perfect to accompany the ham on the Easter table.

A delicious preparation for salmon. We were skeptical about the relish, but liked the freshness of the oranges and the herb/onion combination very much. Looking forward to serving this again.

Excellent recipe with a few minor changes. I used mandarin oranges, as suggested, which made a big difference. Since they were a bit drier, I added some fresh juice from a juice orange and I also added some peanut oil to the salsa. One big change is that the 20 minute baking time is way too long for almost any piece of salmon. I cooked mine about 15 minutes and it could have come out a minute or two earlier and been fine.

Very tasty. Good dinner party dish. Next time I'd use mandarin oranges to save time. 3.5 stars!

I found this recipe to be merely "ok". It may be the genetically mutated monster navel oranges available locally, but I found the relish to be just a weird mishmash. It was definitely fresh, but just not an exciting dish by any stretch. I thought maybe if the marinade used more soy maybe it would work.

I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I found this recipe. It is fabulous. Just served it at an event for 80 people in competition with Tequila lime chicken and tenderloin sandwiches with horseradish cream. The Salmon was the crowd pleaser and the only dish I ran out of! Wow!Since fresh oranges have not been so good this year, I did add some drained Mandarin oranges at the last minute to increase the amount of orange I had. Also reduced a little commercial orange juice to intensify this flavor.

This was a fabulous and light summer meal. I had some fresh caught salmon fillets from South Dakota, and made some jasmine rice with Indian curry spice and scallions to go on the side. You could save time and use canned mandarin orange slices. Awesome!!!

This recipe was over-the-moon good. Very refreshing, lively tastes on the palate, easy to make. I didn't toast the sesame seeds, and I only used a butter knife to shave off the orange pith, but this meal was to die for. Definitely a top-10.

Rating: 4
I was uncertain about making this because of some of the mixed reviews, but don't let them hold you back! This was pretty easy to do, only cutting the orange slices was a pain. I followed the recepe exactly, except I boiled the mariane (like another review suggested) and poured it over the fish before adding the relish. Really pleasant, nice flavor. I made it with Sesame Rice and Sesame Asparagus from this site and it was a hit at my little dinner party. People said it looked like something on TV, rally colorful. Very easy and presentable, make this for your party!

Okay, if you hate to read reviews with substitutions, stop reading and move on. After reading the reviews, I was concerned that the fish was going to be bland. So, I modified the recipe on this site for lacquered red wine salmon. I reduced the marinade with additional white wine, lime zest, rice wine vinegar soy sauce, ginger and orange juice to a syrup consistency. I cooked the salmon at 225 for 30-40 min, glazing the salmon every 10 min. The condiment needed al ot of help. I needed to add rice vinegar and sugar to get more of a sweet and sour kick...and a little lime zest. If you read this and are annoyed with me, I warned you!!!!!!

Delicious! Served with basmati rice and really made an impressive presentation. The only change I made to the recipe was that I saved the excess marinade and reduced it while the salmon was cooking. After salmon was done, I poured the reduction over it and spooned the relish over everything. Will definately make this dish again.

Sadly I thought the recipe was a little bland. The next day I decided to kick it up and whisked 1/2 tb sesame oil with 1/8tsp chile oil, 1/2tb soy sauce and 1/2 tb olive oil. I drizzled the oil sauce over the remaining fish (about 1 lb) and it was much better.

My favorite salmon recipe EVER.

I combined the marinade from the salmon and the vegetables etc., and baked it in a separate pan in the oven with the fish. Then I coarse chopped/bended it with a hand blender as a sauce over the salmon. Was excellent. Got rave reviews. I pre-cut the salmon in 1.5" slices to facilitate serving a large party.

I had this tonight at a friend's house. The flavors combine beautifully, and everything complements everything else! Also, it's amazing that something so tasty could contain only ingredients that are good for you. I can't wait to make this for myself. It's really delicious!!

One of my all-time favorite recipes. I actually used tilapia instead of salmon...scandalous, I know...but it was absolutely delicious. I think you could put this orange-ginger relish on a cardboard box and it'd still taste phenomenal. Just a note about preparation: I was hesitant not to cook the relish for a bit, thinking it would taste raw or too coleslaw-y, but the heat from the fish actually cooks it just enough to make it perfect. Oh, and don't toss the leftovers! My husband and I bundled up and refrigerated a piece or two, and it tasted even better the next day.

We loved this! My husband rates whether I could serve a dish to company or not and this was definitely a keeper. I can't imagine how anyone thought this was so bland it needed to be additionally salted. I grilled salmon filets and served with brown rice and the relish spooned over both. Beautiful presentation!

What a wonderful review prior to this one. I agree sesame is for greasy meats and orange has no place other than a glass of OJ with breakfast. Profound comments by a true culinary genius. I tried to tweek the recipe and replaced the salmon will sweet breads and instead of orange added some dorian mellon. Instead of soy i used classic Coke and lots of garlic and topped it off with some ketchup and velveta cheese ..... Wonderful ! I am an idiot - and that is the beauty of the internet.

I hate to ruin this recipe's perfect rating, but I made it with high hopes and found it very bland and just ended up pouring a bunch of salt over the plate to make it tasty. I anticipated that I'd want it as flavorful as possible, so I even increased the amount of orange peel in recipe (and used fresh squeezed orange juice throughout instead of store-bought) and even marinated the salmon for 4 hours. Sorry, but sesame is a wonderful but very subtle kick to greasy things like a beef stir fry, but no amount of sesame, ginger, red pepper or onion can make up for the fact the,compared to the old salmon standbys of lime or lemon with some garlic, orange is quite bland. Maybe it's just a taste thing particular to me--I love oranges on their own but don't like them paired with a main course. This recipe left me wishing I'd just used lemon or lime or had bought a pre-maid fish sauce in the supermarket. If I were to try this again I'd use some lemon or lime, and probably some garlic, and leave out the orange, but then, really, it would be a totally different recipe wouldn't it. BY the way, Epicurious.com is a great website, isn't it? Sorry to sound negative on my first review, but I love salmon and think of myself as having a sophisticated adventuous palate, but this recipe sounded so good, and took a lot of time, and just turned out to be dulllllllll.

This is an unusual and delicious preparation for salmon, and has quickly become a favorite at my house. I agree with the cook who recommended using very good quality salmon and oranges, as this recipe showcases both. It's relatively easy, healthful, beautiful, and delicious.

Excellent!! This is now my favorite salmon recipe. It was a little time consuming (because of the oranges), but I think the next time around will be quicker.

This was a fairly easy, very tasty dish that received rave reviews and cries of "is there anymore?" Be sure to use the highest quality salmon and oranges you can find. (The oranges I used were not especially juicy or flavorful, so I added a few tablespoons of OJ to the salsa.) Warming the salsa for a few minutes before serving helped too.

Delicious. The only thing I did differently was to put the relish on the fish and let it sit in the warm oven for a few minutes prior to serving, so that the mixture was tender and not cold. I would definitely make this again.

My husband and I made this and served it with a rice pilaf. The aroma of the relish is amazing. This is a fun, fresh and delicious way to try salmon.

Choosing to prepare this recipe was a last minute decision after determining it was too cold and windy to try to grill (our favorite standby salmon recipe from this site GRILLED SALMON FILLETS WITH CREAMY HORSERADISH SAUCE) outdoors. I chose this recipe because I had almost all the ingredients on hand and there were so many positive reviews. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, substituting fresh shallots for the red onion, ground ginger for the "fresh", mandarin oranges for the navel and left out the cilantro entirely (all substitutions due to lack of fresh on hand). It turned out great. Nice presentation, too. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this healthy, tasty alternative to our usual. The kids, however, wouldn't even give it a try and opted for hot dogs (ugh!).

It is superb! Light, low fat, healthy and delicious! Even my mother (who hates to try new recipes) loved it in spite of the ginger she hates! Next time, I would make the relish a bit more in volume to suit my own taste. More vegetables and fruit, less fish... Oh, I also warmed the relish before topping the fish with it. Try it!

This recipe is really special. I have made it following the directions to the T and been delighted, and I've made it with my own modifications and been delighted. Here are my modifications: I used farm raised steel-head trout, which looks and tastes just like salmon, but is a bit more mild. To save time, I also used canned mandarin oranges as well as ginger puree out of a jar.

A nice way to prepare the oh-so-common salmon fillets. The flavors are quite nice and it is a very healthy inexpensive dish ... and foolproof for the novice cook. I use canned mandarin oranges because i am lazy and carton OJ for the maranade. Otherwise, the stated proportions work well. This one made it to recipe box - not great but very good and VERY easy !

This easy recipe looks as good as it tastes. I remained true to the recipe and was thrilled with the results. A three pound filet served seven hungry people with very little left over. I made a simple lemon rice on the side, and got raves all around. A keeper.
