3.5 really. The quinoa mixture seemed like it would be bland as is, so I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and added some chopped, lightly fried garlic to the mix with the egg. The ragu is good on it's own, but I tweaked just a little to my liking. Doubled the garlic and used crushed red pepper in addition to the ground black, and added 1/8 teaspoon sea salt. Yum. I found I had to add a LOT of water to the ragu to keep it from thickening too much, but I may have just had my pan too hot. Side note: I loved forming the little patties with the lightly greased cylindrical 1/3 cup measuring cup, can't believe I'd never thought of that before! All in all easy, healthy, will be making this one again:-)

This recipe is just ok as it stands. However, the next day with half the ragu left over, I pulsed it in the food processor, left it a bit chunky, reheated and served over cooked penne pasta. It was amazing. When I made the ragu, I added some chili flakes, kalamata olives (chopped, about a dozen) and a splash of red wine vinegar and extra tomatoes. Used 2 eggs for the cakes as per other reviewers. I mixed 1 tbsp of panko and 1 tbsp of cornmeal together and dusted the 1 cup measure with some, added the quinoa mixture, pressed then dusted the top with the panko and cornmeal mixture. Held plastic wrap over the cup and flipped the cake into the wrap. I made 5 cakes and covered them with parchment paper for the cooling phase. Easy to flip into the pan with the plastic wrap. Browned nicely and held together. The cakes are missing something. Had leftover cake for lunch with chipotle salsa and it was perfect. I would make the ragu again, refridgerate then process as a pasta topping, but would not make this recipe as it is. Cakes would be good with some seasoning, but pretty bland otherwise.

Made ragu as written except added an extra tomato that had on hand. Excellent! Quinoa cakes did not turn out as I didn't have any eggs! Made in custard cups, with some of smoked mozzarella, parsley, roasted peppers mixed in. Placed in 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes. Did not bind but excellent flavor and the outside edge had a great crunchiness. Noticed the kid grabbed a second cup while watching tv tonight.

Based on prior reviews, I did the following to enhance flavor of the quinoa cakes: To the cooked and cooled quinoa, I added about half a cup of grated Parmesan and about half a cup of very finely chopped walnuts, then 2 eggs (instead of 1). Mixed it up, and used a 1/2 cup measure to mold the cakes onto a plastic-covered sheet pan. Chilled them for a good couple of hours. They were DELICIOUS, and held together well. The nutty flavor and parmesan really worked well with the Ragu. The ragu needed no changes, and can be reused for pasta as suggested by someone else. Fun recipe overall because its so versatile and can be tweaked rather easily. I'll make it again.

Lovely weeknight meal. Tips: If you're looking for more flavor in the cakes, cook your quinoa in chicken stock first. Also, I made the cakes with 2 eggs and 2 TBSP potato starch, then placed them directly on an oiled cookie sheet and into the FREEZER for 15 minutes. They held together perfectly! Will definitely make again.

Great ragu! I served it over pasta, for a quick meal. I'm sure the recipe is great as is, but I didn't have all the ingredients. I subbed gruyere for smoked mozz and stirred in some kalamata olives at the very end, rather than roasted peppers. Yum. I actually don't like eggplant under most conditions, but I got one in my CSA. This recipe has changed my mind! I might even purchase eggplant intentionally sometime...

This recipe is simply delicious! Simple because of the flavors. It did take a lot of time to prepare so it will likely be more of a weekend dish. As many others suggested, I used 2 eggs to keep the quinoa cakes together. The cakes were crispy and nutty and an excellent accompaniment to the ragu. I used cilantro instead of parsley because that's what I had at hand. I think next time I'll add some chili flakes to the ragu to give it a bit of a kick.

My wife absolutely loved this recipe. Did add two eggs instead of one to the quinoa and panko coating as other reviewers suggested. Used 3 1/2 inch egg rings to form the patties, which is much easier. Next time will change the type of tomato used. A delicious dish, which will be made many more times.

The cakes took me a little practice, but as of this evening, I have it down to a science. Cooked the quinoa as directed, making sure ALL of the water soaked up. I use two eggs instead of one, and add enough bread crumbs (Not grainy store-bought...that's a mistake I made initially. Either panko, or homemade) so that the mixture is fairly dry. After that, followed directions except used half butter/half oil. This ragu is great, but the cakes are very versatile. For tonight, I added garlic powder and onion powder to the quinoa mix, then served with asparagus and a lemon butter sauce, topped of with chopped pistachios. We've got the cakes in weekly rotation now, with various sauces - lemon or white wine burre, Greek (tomatoes, black olive, oregano, Feta crumbles), etc. They don't have a lot of flavor on their own, so you do need a sauce, but the crunchy texture is great, and slightly nutty. Highly recommended.

Delicious! Instead of jarred red peppers I used two fresh ones -- broiled and peeled them, deseeded, making sure to use the juice. My husband and I loved the result.

So incredibly good!! For the ragu - I put 3/4 of mixture in the blender. Instead of baking the quinoa cakes, I fried them. Used 2 eggs, a little corn starch, and then I coated the patties in a mixture of spicy corn meal and buckwheat flour. GREAT with kale caesar salad - see recipe.

3 forks because the cakes fell apart but 4 stars for an amazing restaurant quality Ragu! The smoked mozzarella is amazing. Trust me do not substitute for another cheese. I'm going to use the rest on my omlette right now. Will follow suggestions to use 2 eggs or some flour to bind. And I think smaller cakes would be key. 1/2 cup scoop probably perfect. Delish!

My cakes crumbled. I'm guessing it's because I chilled them for too long. Something came up, had to step away from the kitchen for a few hours. I think that dried out the (2) eggs I had used so the quinoa didn't hold together in the pan. The ragu was great! It was an interesting spin on quinoa... the complete protein! If you're looking for healthy eats, this is a good one.

I found this recipe I had way overcooked some quinoa but I didn't want to throw it away. Because the quinoa was a bit goopy, I didn't even need the egg. This really worked out great. So for those of you who want more flavor, I'd suggest cooking the quinoa in some stock/broth. Adds quite a bit of flavor, especially if it's homemade.

First time trying quinoa (bought the beige vs black quinoa) and found the cakes quite bland even though I added salt, sauteed onion and garlic. Doubled the quinoa, used 5 eggs and threw in some quinoa flour as I was concerned about binding based on the other reviews. Started forming patties but realized it would be a challenge so I pulled out my 1/2 cup scoop, put my ring mould/mold in the pan, dropped the 1/2 cup of quinoa in and pressed it flat with a potato masher  PERFECT 4 oz patties! 5 minutes each side and not one crumbled. Ragu topping was also great. Didn't use smoked mozzarella - would consider crumbling some feta on top as per one poster. I made the ragu the night before and steamed the quinoa in my rice steamer and refrigerated all overnight and assembled and cooked the cakes the next day. Poached an egg, added some fresh Italian parsley and had this baby for breakast. Definitely a time-consuming endeavour, and wouldnt serve this as a dinner party entrée, but as a veggie dish, it could definitely be dressed up and impress guests. Labour aside, it felt good/healthy eating this and I would make the patties again but would experiment with flavouring and additions... Would enjoy hearing feedback as to how to make these cakes more flavourful as I would like to implement these into my diet as they provide that full feeling that is so important in weight loss/management.

This turned out fantastic. I pureed some of the ragu and used it to "sauce" the plate before adding the quinoa cake and chunky ragu on top. It turned out really well. I did use fontina instead of the smoked mozzarella and used 2 eggs, as suggested, instead of one in the quinoa. The quinoa cakes were a little tricky to get into the pan but I used extra care and a nonstick spatula and they cooked up great. Both of my meat-eater guys cleaned their plates!

I give this one 2.5 forks. I thought the quinoa cakes were really bland for the effort. The dish relies on the ragout for flavor. The ragout however, was outstanding--savory and full of flavor. I'll make this again because it's so healthy and it does taste very good, only I'll skip making the quinoa into cakes, which will cut down on time and fat from the oil needed to fry and eggs needed to shape. (I agree that two eggs are needed for the cakes.) Overall, a very good dish, just not a knockout.

Rating: 3
Used the addition others had recommended of 2 eggs per quinoa cake recipe. I'm not sure they would have stayed together otherwise. Overall, this was a good dish, but could use more flavor to be a great one. (I already added garlic and chili powder to the cakes.)

SOOOOO good! My husband didn't even ask where the meat was he loved it so much! I would note to try to make the quinoa cakes ahead of time to leave time for them to chill in the fridge so they stay together a little better.

I only made the quinoa cake part of this recipe so am only reviewing that portion. First, washing the quinoa, using the sieve etc. = totally unnecessary. The cakes held together until it was time to actually cook them (I chilled overnight). There wasn't even a whisper of "cake" at that point. I will make this again and will use additional eggs as other reviewers suggested. I only had one so didn't make this crucial modification the first time around. Wondering if the addition of some bread crumbs or panko might help as well? When they did fall apart, I simply crisped it as someone else suggested and it had a nice taste and texture, hence the 3 forks. I wonder how people were actually able to form cakes by following this recipe to the letter. They must have magic quinoa.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a delicious recipe, but I'm unsure if I'll make it again just because of how long it took. I received several compliments, and everyone ate far more than it took to become full. My edits: From the advice of others, I added more eggs (5 eggs for a doubled recipe) and chilled the cakes for about an hour. I had absolutely no problem with the cakes falling apart. I also added a few herbs to both the cakes and the ragu for flavor.

Rating: 3
followed the recipe, with the exception of heeding folks' suggestion to use two eggs vs. one. no problem with quinoa cakes crumbling, though requisite care was taken. found that sliding hand under plastic wrap and then flipping cake over onto spatula made for a solid means of transporting the quinoa to the skillet. only used about half the suggested smoked mozzarella (a cheese that i typically don't eat), and it added plenty of smokiness, which i thought played well with the other flavors. i think if i make it again, i might increase the amount of tomato, as i thought it could stand a bit more acid. the ragu was tasty, though, and quite hearty. agree that it's quite a bit of work -- for a good result, albeit, but it takes a good amount of time.

Rating: 4
Oh my god...this was fantastic. My tweaks were: a touch of smoked paprika, cayenne, and red wine vinegar to the ragu, and minced onion, parsley and s&p to the quinoa cakes. As many have noted, the cakes don't hold together super well, but I think that adding an extra egg, making them a small size, and flipping only once with a very thin, flexible spatula help keep them together enough to retain 'cake' status. Everything but the frying of the cakes can be done a day in advance, too, which is a bonus.

For cakes, save time and just place the quinoa directly in the flying pan with a bit of oil and press down with fork. Prepared cakes as separate snack, adding curry powder. Yum!!

I had a difficult time keeping the cakes together; however, the crunchiness of the quinoa cakes combined with the soft ragu was absolutely delicious! Next time, I think I will add one more egg and bake them right on the baking sheet for a healthier meal that will hold better. I had no cheese nor peppers so I made the ragu without them. The sauce was still delicious. I will make this again with slight alternations.

This dish was yummy and the quinoa cakes would go with many things! I mixed 1 cup of red quinoa cooked in veggie broth with about an equal portion of cooked lentils and used that for the cakes. Only had 2 eggs, but could have probably used 3. Next time I will bake, not fry, the cakes as I think it would be just as good and easier/healthier. The cakes had a delicious texture and hearty flavor. A very healthy, satisfying vegetarian meal! I think you could doctor the quinoa cakes to make a really great veggie burger too!

Like others, although I added an extra egg and refrigerated the quinoa cakes, they still didn't hold together perfectly. In spite of that, they were absolutely delicious, along with the ragu. Used fresh peppers and feta instead of smoked mozzarella. Will make this again and again, especially for my fellow vegetarian friends.

This recipe is fantastic! Our cakes didn't hold together very well, so we kind of wound up browning the quinoa -- which gave it a great texture to go with the ragu. The flavor and color of the ragu is wonderful.

Great recipe. For a variation, I did the following: Quinoa Cakes: added black beans (half of a 14 oz can) a large pinch of red pepper flakes and bit more egg to bind. Prepare as described above. Topping: added diced fennel (1.5 cups), 1 tsp of crushed fennel seeds, 1 tbsp of capers. Prepare along with onions, garlic and oregano as described above. Substitution/deletions: I left out the peppers and water. I used white white for the liquid. Bring to a boil with tomatoes and I placed a large filet of haddock on top that I seasoned with sea salt and paprika. Cover and cook 5-10 minutes until fish is done. I left out the mozzarella and added cubed lemon, rind and seeds removed, along with fresh chopped parsley just before serving. Place one quinoa cake on a plate, top with eggplant mixture and a piece of fish. Enjoy!

I wish I had read reviews before making this - I only used one egg, and my cakes fell apart. They were still toasty and delicious though! The ragu was very earthy and satisfying. I will probably finish it with more fresh herbs next time I make it. I think this ragu would be delicious on top of some polenta cakes, too. I love kristenfc's idea of topping the dish off with pine nuts. Goat cheese would be great in this, too.

Absolutely delicious! I decided to try this recipe and serve it to my notoriously meat-loving fiancee. He's not a huge fan of eggplant, but man, did he love this dish, and even asked me to make it again! I found my quinoa cooked much faster than this recipe says, so keep an eye on it. I'm not a fan of smokey flavors, so I used plain mozzarella. Also, we had plenty of ragu left, so I used the extra in my morning omlette...Yum-O!

I have made this recipe a number of times for my wife, and it is a hit. I decided to mix it up, and made a pizza, using the quinoa as the crust. I followed the recipe exactly, although I used regular mozz rather than the smoked. The only other alteration was that I used a generic spinach/cheese pasta sauce under the eggplant topping. My wife loved it and suggested I share my idea with you.

I served this as an appetizer and my guests thought the recipe was very tasty, but the quinoa cakes were way too big!

You could try adding two eggs, or you could refrigerate the quinoa cakes longer. Also make sure your skillet is fully pre-heated because that made all the difference. I also removed the skin from the eggplant, so the texture of the ragu was smooth and tasty.

Definitely add two eggs to make the cakes stick together. I added 1/2 cup of the quinoa mixture to a few tablespoons of oil and let them cook for about 4 minutes, then flipped them and cooked for about 4 more minutes. Don't substitute the smoked mozzarella, it makes the dish.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I was not able to make the cakes of quinoa because it would not stay formed. instead I served it as a side item of crispy quinoa grains. The ragu was nothing special. I used fresh ingredients and home grown vegetables, and had to throw it all away because it was terrible.

Wow, I was really impressed by this recipe. I was looking for a healthy way to use eggplant and parsley, so I increased the parsley by quite a bit (added some to the quinoa mix as well) as well as adding thyme as suggested. Most people have commented on this, so I added an extra egg as well as some Italian breadcrumbs...but I think those probably weren't necessary. Refrigeration is key though. I used a whole eggplant and didn't bother to measure, and then ended up adding more tomato to balance. I roasted fresh bell pepper in the toaster, de- skinned, chopped and added. Only big change was using crumbled feta instead of mozzarella...it melted nicely and gave the ragu a kind of creamy texture as well as a little nip of salt. I really liked the sauce (not usually a fan of eggplant) and the crispness of the quinoa is awesome. I'll add this to my dinner repertoire.

Good. I made the ragu and quinoa, and didn't have time to make the cakes the fisrt night, so I just put the mixture over the quinoa. Made cakes with the leftover quinoa, some pine nuts and parmesan...very yummy! Mine did fall apart, but with the leftover quinoa the portions were off.

Tasted delicious but the quinoa cakes crumbled when cooked. I added extra egg but they still fell apart. Next time I will add bread crumbs or flour to make more sturdy patties. The toasted flavor went really well with the sauce. The eggplant ragu was really good, salting the eggplant got rid of the bitter eggplanty flavor. The sauce was slightly sweet and very tasty! Used basil instead of parsley and fresh bell pepper instead of roasted. Would be good on pasta too.

these were a hit in my apartment! i basically followed the recipe, except i did as other reviewers suggested and added my own spices to the quinoa for taste and used 2 eggs instead of 1. I also threw a couple tablespoons of parmesan and a sprinkle of feta into the mix. For forming the cakes, i just scooped out spoonfuls and formed them w/ my hands. They sat overnight and I had no problems with them falling apart when i cooked them. i would scoop one up with a spatula, and then place the spatula on the pan for a few seconds until the quinoa was firm enough to slide off. they all cooked beautifully. the ragu was phenomenal! i didn't alter it at all and was very pleased with the results! next time, I might dice the smoked mozz up smaller or mix more of it in, since the uncooked pieces on top were kind of dominating. Overall, this dish was amazing! my carnivorous roommates raved about it (they had made chicken as a backup, but the quinoa was so filling and good, the chicken was hardly touched!), and i've already been asked to make it again. definitely a great way to jazz up quinoa!

Very good. I cooked the quinoa in veggie broth, used 2 eggs and grated some parmesean cheese into the cakes, as recommended. I formed the cakes by packing them into a nonstick pancake ring, then I chilled them for maybe 45 minutes. They held together very well and developed a lovely crust.

Tasted good. But wow the reviewers were right on this time. I used the extra egg as suggested so my cakes did stay together-but once you serve it with the topping it could as easily be plain old 5-minutes-in-the-microwave quinoa. Maybe cheese and herbs in the quinoa mixture would help. I guess this does make it pretty enough to serve at a dinner party though, so that's a plus.

I used chicken broth to cook the quinoa, and mixed it with romano cheese/ black pepper. I doubled the garlic and herbs, added thyme and basil to the sauce along with zucchini, squash, portabella mushrooms, olives (halved the eggplant serving) and some diced tom. in their water. And added three eggs, made sure I padded down the mixer in the measure cup before I put it in the frying pan. Super delicious, my honey said he hates it when I cook because he always ends up over eating. I only gave it three forks because I think it would have lack some serious taste if I followed the directions.

In light of the problems others have had, I added 2 large eggs and a generous 1/2 cup of fresh whole wheat bread crumbs from a rustic style loaf to the quinoa, packed the mixture firmly into a 1/2 c. measuring cup, and chilled the resulting cakes (I got five out of a single recipe) for about ten minutes in the freezer. The cakes were still delicate, but had enough structure to hold together. They developed a wonderful golden brown crust and made a nice foil for the ragu. I made the ragu as written but with Asian eggplant (eliminating the need for salting, as others have remarked), and fresh red bell pepper instead of roasted peppers. I added fresh basil as well as parsley and eliminated the cheese in the sauce. With well browned eggplant, a generous helping of herbs, and a few pieces of fresh mozzarella sprinkled on top,the dish was flavorful and very satisfying.

Loved this recipe - one of my favorites yet. It did take some time to put the dish together, so made it on a Saturday when I wasn't in a rush to get dinner on the table. I took the suggestions of past reviewers and added one egg white. I also let the patties rest in the fridge for an hour (seemed stickier after - like the quinoa absorbed some of the egg). Had no problem with my cakes staying together in the pan (and I used much less oil - only one tbsp per 4 cakes). Will definitely make these again (and have been enjoying the leftovers!).

My husband and I loved this recipe! It does take a little longer than I'd hoped, but yum it was it worth it. I added 2 eggs as suggested and didn't have a problem with crumbly cakes. I peeled my eggplant (which it doesn't look like they did in the picture), and kind of smushed up the tomatoes in the pan (DH doesn't like whole tomatoes) so it all turned out more like a sauce and less like a hot salsa. I also made the cakes smaller (maybe 3" across, 3/4" high) and ended up with 14. They were like little hash brown cakes, except healthier! If my calculations are correct, there are less than 2,000 calories in the whole recipe! So in my book, this is a great, healthy recipe for the whole family.

I just made this recipe for Passover and it was a great hit at both seders. The quinoa cakes did not hold together, so, after some frustration, I toasted it in a dutch oven for added flavor and served it pilaf style with the veggies on the side. I substited zucchini for half the eggplant and left out the mozzarella. The resulting flavors worked fantastically with roast turkey.

This was quite good. My boyfriend went nuts for it! I was out of egg so I just served the ragu over the quinoa. I also used zucchini instead of eggplant. I thought there was too much zucchini and not enough tomato, might play with the proportions a little next time I make it. Also, the smoked mozzarella was overpowering, I can see this working well with regular mozzarella or even goat cheese or feta. Might increase the herbs to give it a little more kick, too. Overall, pretty easy and quite good- a few tweaks would make it fantastic.

Doubled quinoa and added three eggs. Added plenty of ground black pepper, some crumbled feta and oregano. Based on other reviewers comments, decided not to form cakes and fry.

the ragu was really nice and the smoked mozzerella was a nice touch. i had a feeling the quinoa cakes would be bland. They were, yet the taste and crunch were still good.

I used one extra egg and made sure they were really crisp on a side before flipping and they were lovely.

Thought this recipe was very good, with what appears to be the common exception of the crumbly cakes. Wish I'd read the reviews first for the 2 egg recommendation! Made this on a spur, didn't have eggplant or peppers, but used black beans and vegetable broth, and was very happy with the results, except the crumbly cakes. The ones that did survive, however, were fantastic! Loved the crunch of the quinoa! I will definitely try this one again!

Hmm. My husband (big meat eater) LOVED this and although tasty: 3 forks for time consuming on a Thur. work nt. I modified per others - 2 eggs, no chill time, chinese egg plant and much smaller cakes. I forgot to add 1/2 the cheese until the 2nd batch but I had to use feta (on hand) and the cakes held together better w/out. Added shredded basil instead of parsley and more garlic to the ragu - which I thought was okay except I cut the eggplant too big so it was more like a chunky rattatouille. Lastly - I used red quinoa and while tasty - it was hard to tell when "golden". Will make again after this lesson. p.s. Very filling! oh, and I wonder if anyone has tried it with Pam or baking? Think it would lose the crispness but we're trying to cut fat.

I used regular fresh mozzarella, and zucchini instead of eggplant for the ragu. I thought the ragu was delicious, and I loved the cakes too.

This was a good weeknight meal. I think the ragu could use a bit more flavor. The cakes were not a problem for me. I added an extra egg per other reviewers and then used an ice cream scoop to scoop the measured amount directly into the hot oil (no pre-forming, no refrigeration) and just barely gave each one a light pat to flatten a bit. It made 10 cakes--no mess, no fuss, no problems flipping. They were the perfect size and good ratio of crunch and soft inside. I also added some feta for interest on top.

I made this recipe last night for the first time. I While I found the recipe very tasty and would make it again, I did find it more labor intensive than I originally thought.

Wonderful Ragu. Tasty quinoa "cakes". Loved the texture with the toasty grain. I guess you need to be a spatula master to get these cakes to work according to the recipe. Next time I'll use two eggs and a bit of arrowroot and not bother with the chilling part, for it makes no difference once it's time to flip those things. I ended up with 5 cakes. One came out unbroken. :( Otherwise, I like the recipe. Very tasty. I used good goat cheese feta instead of the mozzerella. (Not a fan of smoked cheese). I also used extra garlic. -1 fork for difficulty factor.

I love quinoa, and this recipe sounded fantastic. Stirred in the egg to the quinoa and tried to shape it, and realized that was practically impossible (I didn't want to add another egg -- didn't want it "eggy"). Decided to be lazy and just stirred the egg/quinoa into the ragu. Also substituted feta for the mozzarella. Just stirred uncovered until everything thickened up a bit. Wow. Fantastic!

This recipe was a bit labor intensive in that it required a lot of chopping. The cakes came out perfectly; I followed the recipe except I added one extra egg white (as others had suggested). This did the trick - the cakes stayed together and fried up nicely without falling apart. The ragu was just ok. However, I think my opinion is biased because (as I discovered when I sat down to eat this meal) it turns out I dislike eggplant. Hadn't tried it before. My friends seemed to enjoy it much better than I did.

This was pretty good (love the Quinoa Cakes) but I did leave out one major ingredient and served as a side dish. I left out the eggplant. Not one person in my family likes eggplant, so I made smaller cakes and just made a tomato version and served it as a side to marinated flank steak. My family loved it.

Used the suggestions of useing two eggs and a smaller measuring cut (1/3 was perfect) added pepper and oregano...delicious!

I don't understand the positive ratings this recipe received. I followed the recipe precisely, but the flavor was bland, and the texture was unpleasant. This recipe is unnecessarily complicated and took forever to complete. Although I allotted extra time for preparation, I still served dinner late. No one finished even half of their plate.

The picture in Gourmet looked so appetizing that I couldn't wait to try this recipe. It was a little labor-intensive for a simple meal, but I had the time and we enjoyed it. Making the quinoa cakes as per instruction would have yielded obscenely supersized portions. It's no wonder that other reviewers had trouble flipping them; they were huge! Using a 1/3 cup measure proved to be much more manageable for flipping and eating, and provided a greater crisp to soft quinoa ratio. The ragu was so tasty that my two teenagers, who don't like the idea of eggplant, scarfed down second helpings. The ragu would also work with pasta or couscous. I'll play with the flavors next time, adding capers and feta to the ragu with toasted pine nuts on top, instead of using smoked mozzarella. The quinoa cakes are also versatile. My daughter packed one of the extras (which was possible because I made them smaller) in her lunchbox with leftover beef/broccoli stir fry. I'll make the components of this meal again, but not necessarily together.

Excellent. Making the cakes in a measuring cup is a great trick, although my forth cake was a little small. Next time, I'll double the recipe so I have leftovers.

I added two eggs to the quinoa, and didn't bother shaping the mixture carefully or refrigerating it. Instead I just dropped heaping spoonfuls into the hot oil and flattened them evenly. After leaving them to cook until golden on the edges, they were perfectly easy to turn over. Very satisfying supper.

Great vegetarian meal. If you can flip the cakes, makes a stunning presentation as well. Hint: make sure the diameter of the cake fits onto your spatula, or else the sides will tear. I found that using two spatulas to flip the cakes worked very well.

I agree with others...very tasty, though somewhat labor intensive for being an "Everyday" meal. I had the same problem with the cakes staying together--no matter how gentle I was with them. I would agree that another egg or perhaps egg white is in order...or I like one reviewer's idea of just sauteeing the quinoa, though I like the presentation of the quinoa in cake form. The ragu was amazing, I'd make that for other dishes...maybe filling for a sandwich.

Very tasty. We made this exactly as written with a side of spicy green beans. It is difficult to keep the cakes together -- perhaps another egg next time.

Very tasty, good clean flavors. I used chinese eggplants so didn't do the salting part. Lovely, comforting, surprisingly filling vegetarian dinner.

The ragu is fantastic. The quinoa cakes did not come out as described. Maybe try adding another egg or skip the egg all together and just saute the quinoa a little. The crunch was great along side the ragu. Definitely white wine.
