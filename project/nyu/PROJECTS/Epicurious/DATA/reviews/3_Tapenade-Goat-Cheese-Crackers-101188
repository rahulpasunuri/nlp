I have made this recipe for years. It is ALWAYS the biggest hit at parties. Yes, the crackers are a bit of a pain, however, totally worth it!

To be fair, I made this with all purchased ingredients, so I'm sure it would be different, but I was not impressed. I had Carr's croissant (sp.) crackers, goat cheese and tapenade. I thought that maybe they would have more flavor if they sat at room temperature for a while, but the tapenade just seemed to totally overpower the cheese (No matter how little I used) To me they were just ok.

I just ran across this recipe again. I made them for a reception for my in-laws anniversary a couple of years ago. True, the crackers were a pain in the neck and I did break lots, however, my recruited helpers (teen-agers and sister-in-law) were more than happy to eat the cracker crumbs. I wound up putting the cheese in a pastry bag to spread on the crackers and that helped cut down on the breakage. The crackers received lots of compliments, so if you have the time and patience, I think they are worth it. To tell the truth, I can't imagine using water crackers, but I guess its worth a try.

i didn't make the crackers, but the app looked very nice going out on water crackers. it was easy to make and they all went. i made it with half klamata olives and half regular black olives, because they are too salty and strong tasting for me. and they seemed fine.

Wow! This was a hit! I made a double batch of crackers and it wasn't enough. After reading the reviews about cracker breakage, I decided to cut them completely apart before baking, rather than scoring like the recipe said. I bakined them for less time, and they came out great! Definitely take the time to make these crackers - they are great on their own, even without the tapenade.

I agree with most of the people above, the tapenade goat cheese topping is easy and great. Presentation is beautiful from the combination of white cheese and purple/black tapenade. Skip the crackers and buy your own.

Don't bother making the crackers when you can buy a box of water crackers for less than $2 that serve just fine. The tapenade is great with fresh basil.

I agree with other reviewers. I made this recipe and was unimpressed with the cracker recipe. It tended to break far too easily and I felt it really added no flavor. In fact it's charm was that it was pretty flavourless but very buttery. I had a fair amount of the topping left over which I just ate on french bread or triscuits and thought it every bit as wonderful. (Because the tapenade and goat cheese combination is delicious!) I believe I also used fresh basil instead of parsley for the tapenade and could not get enough of it. I will also say I felt the tapenade (leftover) kept just in my refrigerator for several days. P.s. I could have used it all up by making another tray with some of the crackers I had left over but was enjoying my party too much to bother. I also make the chicken wraps described in the same article and they were as equally popular as the goat cheese appetizers.

This recipe was okay. After reading prior reviews I decided to skip making the crackers, and used purchased roasted garlic and rosemary crackers. The results seemed pretty good. The flavors nicely complemented the goat cheese and olives. But I don't know that it is worth the effort to make again.

I was a bit worried after reading the previous review, but decided to try the recipe anyway. I seem to have had better luck and found this rather easy to make (if time consuming like all hors d'oeuvres). I did have some breakage, and the yield was less than suggested by the recipe.

Don't bother making this. I made this recipe twice. The crackers were too fragile to spread and too fragile for the guests to pick up. My yield was about 35 crackers rather than the claimed 120. I wasted lots of expensive chevre.
