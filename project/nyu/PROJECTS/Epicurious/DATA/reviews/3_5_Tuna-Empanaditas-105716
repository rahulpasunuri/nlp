I loved this recipe! The Empanaditas kept perfectly in the freezer I baked them unthawed at 350 degrees for 20 minutes instead of 400 for 30 minutes. They were gobbled up at the party I brought them to!

Great taste and well received! I simplified with little time, and used cresent roll dough, which I unrolled and pre-cooked for 2 1/2 minutes to ensure the dough inside was done. Also added additional seasonings per previous reviewers.

Very delicious and very easy! I added some chipotle chili powder for a little kick. It did the trick! The smoky flavor of the chipotle and the saltiness of the olives go great together.

Needs more spice (hello this is a Latin dish) I added mozzarella and a few dashes of red pepper flakes. I also made an Asian version with tuna, ginger soy sauce and tofu.

Have you ever read the nutrition info on a package of puff pastry? This couldn't possibly be low in fat.

it was a great treat especially for anyone who likes tuna! Plus it wasn't too heavy and didn't have too much fat

These things are terrible. They just taste like capers. We spent a whole afternoon making them and we ended up throwing them away.

Very attractive appetizers. I made triangles instead of half-moons, to save time and dough, and I thought that worked well. I wouldn't bother with a cookie cutter for this; cutting the sheets into squares is just as effective (2-inches seems best, since the smaller empanaditas were more appealing). To increase the filling-to-dough ratio per piece, I would pack the tuna very firmly into a rounded teaspoon, and scoop it out onto the wrapper with another teaspoon. I used one thawed sheet and one still-frozen sheet of puff pastry, and I found that although the thawed sheet was more difficult to work with, it produced prettier appetizers. The frozen sheet puffed up too much and was in danger of coming open during baking. Next time I'd like to add a little more spice (maybe paprika?) to boost the flavors a touch.

Try replacing the tuna with chorizo. I added extra paprika and a little pepper and it was great.

Loved 'em. I also suggest using a larger cutter ... but I think next time I will lay a sheet of the pastry down, spread with tuna, put another pastry on top, and cut into squares. I would also double the tuna.

A friend made these for a New Year's Eve party. All in attendance agreed that they were wonderful and they disappeared quickly. She made them ahead of time and froze them, pulling them from the freezer the day of the party. She also suggested a slightly larger (3-inch) cutter made for a better result. We loved 'em.

I only had tuna in water. I drained it and used a little olive oil. I also added a little goat cheese to help bind. It was a great hit and I am make a lot of them for a club Christmas party. I will use the tuna in oil this time.
