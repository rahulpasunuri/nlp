Flavor is phenomenal for how easily it goes together (I always do love lemon and capers, though). Definite weeknight staple from now on. Made once as written, a second time with coarsely chopped, sauteed baby spinach and a handful of halved grape tomatoes just at the end. Both were delicious, so it's adaptable, too.

I've made this several times and it's always received rave reviews; this time, I was held up with 5 yr. old necessities and the other half had to make it. By accident, he spilled some of the caper brine into the bowl (you have to accept these things when you relinquish control) and it was delicious...so give it a try!

I love roasting some green beans and making this a spin on a nicoise pasta. The flavors just POP in this dish, you really can't go wrong. I've used both whole wheat pasta and regular, and all shapes of noodles. For longer noodles, be generous with the olive oil so that you can easily get a proper forkful. This is terrific any time, and it's perfect room temp if you want to take it on a picnic!

Very tasty. I am not a pasta lover--but my husband is. The pasta is a low key player in this. It was a perfect balance of tastes and textures.

Loved it. Made exactly as written. Easy and so good. Salad, white wine, a great dinner. The only problem was that I ate too much. Oh well, there's always tomorrow. Will play with it and try some of the suggestions of other viewers, but can't imagine it being any better.

I made this with one pound of whole wheat penne, doubled the sauce, and it was great! I added a little bit less oil, as it seemed like alot and would make it the same next time. It was super easy and I'll definitely make it many many times again. It is a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times now. My favorite addition is fresh green beans which I add to the pasta cooking water 3 minutes before the pasta is finished. I've also made it with leftover grilled wild salmon and WOW! Definitely a keeper. I've shared this with many friends and they all love it as well.

I must admit I was so impressed reading all the glowing reviews and used them to convince my husband that we really should try this recipe. So glad I did - it was utterly delicious! Evan reheated leftovers were amazingly good! (We doubled the recipe and added an extra can of tuna as well.) As is my nature - I always add my own / additional ingredients, in this case: sliced, pitted Kalamata olives, a jar (drained)of marinated artichoke hearts, halved grape tomatoes and since we had no fresh parsley, we substituted FRESH TARRAGON. It was marvelous! (We used Linguine Fini for the pasta.)

I did modify the recipe but I stuck to the basics and it turned out deliciously. I added tomatoes, and did not have any parsley so I thoroughly chopped up 1/4 cup of some herb salad I had. It was absolutely delicious and I will make it again.

Good flavor and nice and easy to make. A good mid-week dinner. Don't skimp on the fresh lemon juice and rind - they are key to the flavor. Added chopped tomatoes. May try artichokes next time. Double the recipe if you want more than 2 servings.

We also make this on a regular basis. It's got a simple yet brilliant flavor. The lemon zest takes any "fishiness" off of the tuna. I alway seem to forget the capers, but it turns out great all the same. Good parmigiana-reggiano is a must. Four forks for simplicity, ease, and excellent flavor!

Fast; easy; very good flavor. I added sun-dried tomatoes for color and it was perfect. Even my 2 year-old son loved it! I would just beg to differ with the author that "Italians would never pair fish with cheese": my Italian friends would never dream of making "penne al tonno," at least, without a generous amount of parmigiano reggiano, which they add right into the sauce at the end.

I wouldn't skip the lemon zest or parmesan cheese. The lemon zest (especially) is what makes it so flavorful & unique. A GREAT blend of flavors. You should definitely use fresh lemon juice, so just grate the outside (yellow) of the lemon into the bowl with a small grater. I was hesitant, but it's delicious.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, flavorful, and delicious! Very healthy too (I used brown rice pasta). This is my 2nd time making it, and it was great both times. I followed the recipe exactly, except this time I didn't have fresh parsely so I omitted it - still great. With whole wheat or brown rice pasta, this is a great recipe to use on South Beach Diet (phases 2-3). My husband also liked it & he's fussy.

Rating: 4
Thanks everone for your additions. I used them also. I didn't have the lemon zest and I forgot the Parmesan. My only changes were grapeseed oil and chervil. My husband cringed when I said that the recipe called for canned tuna. I used Tilapia sauteed in butter with a light sprinkling of Herb spices. Need a covered dish for an outing and I think that I will try this with the canned tuna.

If only everything were this simple and this great. Skip the zest and the cheese - it doesn't need it. Used a little extra lemon juice and capers. Perfect.

I love this recipe! It is delicious! As a matter of fact, it is my favorite summer meal! The flavors are bright and fresh. The only modification I made is that I don't use the garlic - as I forgot to use it the first time and I love it without. I love garlic but not always raw.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely amazing!! I made it for my husband the other night and we didn't have any leftovers! I didn't use tunafish...I had extra Tilapia which was light yet flavorful and very 'gourmet'. I also added some fresh diced tomatoes last minute to the whole thing (so they were crispy); a bit more capers then suggested because we LOVE them; and a 1/2 cup of white wine. It was so perfect for our HOT 90 degree weather that day!! SO refreshing!!! I'm going to make this for my Dad and the rest of the family for our Fathers Day dinner. I highly suggest this recipe, and try the tomatoes and white wine. Trust me...it's DELISH!!!!!

This dish is really quite good. I did not have lemons on hand, so I squeezed some lime juice in. I just had enough for a few squeezes, so I know that the recipe did not turn out as intended. However, it still was delicious and so easy. I look forward to making this pasta again when I have lemons and olives! Perfect for a quick meal.

Worth 4 forks for simplicity and wonderful, fresh taste (as well as having a tasty pasta dish that does not rely on cheese - great for the lactose intollerant.) We wisely doubled the recipe which needs to happen for a family of 4. We also used half lemon juice and half lime juice with great results. Goes well with a chilled Cab. Sav.

This is yet another case of the reviewers REALLY helping! I made this receipe, with water packed tuna, without the lemon zest, added a little extra lemon juice, added Kalamata olives and it was wonderful and quick and easy. Even my picky teenaged daughters liked it. Thanks!

DELICIOUSLY tasty, yet incredible quick and simple. A satisfying meal with a sunny Mediterranean flair - and from ingredients you're likely to have on hand. I used a good-quality Italian brand of oil packed tuna, as I believe this effects the quality of the finished dish. Grated cheese isn't something you usually see paired with an italian fish dish, but it really works! I used my beloved Locatelli romano and it was scrumptious. I simply can't wait to savor my leftovers tonight. Thanks for the add-in ideas, such as tomatoes and olives. I know I'll be making this dish lots, so I'll get to play with variations (although it's wonderful "as is").

Rating: 4
So incredibly easy and yummy. I unfortunately didn't have any tuna packed in oil, but the tuna in water worked out great. I also added the Kalamata olives which gave it a really great flavor with the capers (which I reduced in half) and the tomatoes (for flavor and color). I don't know about the lime, but the (Meyer) lemon was really nice.

I made this recipe on Thursday night, had leftovers on Friday and HAD to make it again on Sunday night - it's SO good! My husband and I couldn't get enough of it. I used lemons and limes, and got cherry tomatoes and squeezed them in to get their juice, which added a nice touch to the flavor - olives are an absolute must, too. And I doubled most of the recipe (except for the tuna - 1 can is plenty) so I could use a pound of pasta. We will be making this weekly - maybe more than once!!

This dish was easy and delicious! I didn't have canned tuna in olive oil so I used canned tuna in spring water with extra virgin olive oil. I added diced tomatoes and sliced pitted kalamata olives, it was superb! It was fine without the Parmesan cheese, I served it with quiche Lorraine and it was fabulous! Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
DO NOT USE LEMON!!! We have found that using the zest of one lime, with juice from half a lime, makes this recipe sing. Limes are sweeter and more fragrant, which covers up the otherwise odd fishy taste you get from the tuna. Also, use good quality parmesean and plenty of cracked black pepper.

Without making any changes, this was a good dish, but, remembering the suggestion of tomatoes, I added a chopped tomato in the next time and it was even better!

If you're in a rush and don't have all the ingredients, you can still have a delicious dish without the parsley and the lemon zest, just add a little more lemon juice. I use water-packed tuna and extra virgin olive oil. It was still great even when I used packaged parmesan rather than freshly grated. Yup, my cabinets were low! My 8-month old loved it and my husband (who is really quite a gourmet) said it was a great supper.

Really quick to put together, and the capers really work well. The flavor was rather mild (probably because I used water packed tuna), so next time I'll try using oil packed tuna and adding the cheese and tomato.

I adore this recipe. It's so easy to prepare from kitchen cabinet staples. I find it a bit dry so add a _little_ pasta water, and will attempt to cut back some on the olive oil next time I make it, since it's so good I find myself eating the whole thing on my own!!!!

Great for an impromptu summer supper. Tomatoes and olives essential. (No parmesan, though.) The recipe caught my eye because I like to blend these same ingredients -- tuna, garlic, capers, lemon (juice & zest), anchovies & olive oil -- as a sauce for grilled lemon-marinated turkey breast, new potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus, etc. In Italy they serve it on cold veal. Absolutely deelish!

I loved this recipe. It was so simple and so delicious. I made it exactly as directed, but you could use less oil to make it lighter.

I would use half the amount of olive oil. It was definitely too oily. I breaded tilapia and sauteed in olive oil till brown on both sides, then finished baking in the oven. It was delicious with the olives, and I would try adding the chopped tomatoes next time.

I used a leftover grilled tuna steak from the night before (okay, two nights before, but it was still fine). I rinsed it off and cut it into small chunks. Because the steak weighed more than a 6 oz. can of tuna, I added a little more of all ingredients. This is one of the best sauces we've had in a long time, and my guest rated it 4 forks: unusual. I'd have rated it 3 and a half forks, also unusual. Salt was not among the ingredients, but I felt it needed some, and added black pepper at the same time. I heated the sauce slightly in the microwave, and I always warm my pasta serving bowls by putting them into the sink and draining the pasta water into them. I used tomatoes and olives as the variation. Next time I'd pit the olives. This sauce was delicious, very easy since it's uncooked, and worth grilling an extra tuna steak.

Extremely yummy recipe, especially when it's too hot to cook, or you're rushed. I made this recipe w/out the parsley and with, it's great both ways. You can also add some lemon juice from the zested lemons to the sauce or just make fresh lemonade. The third time I made this, I tried adding tomatos. It is a different taste, more traditional pasta saucey. I prefer it without.

I could eat this food every day, just love it and easy to prepare without complicated ingredients.

The tester asked for suggestions for less painful ways of acquiring lemon zest. A stainless steel woodworkers rasp is unequalled as a lemon zester; it also works for hard cheese, ginger, etc. I haven't had a grated knuckle yet!

Re: the tester's note requesting less painful way of acquiring lemon zest. I always use a vegetable peeler, then mince the lemon peel with a sharp knife. It's much easier than grating and avoids getting the white part, too. The recipe sounds good, am going to try it later.
