I agree with previous reviewers that the pesto was too strong for the fish, however, the spiced carrots are DELICIOUS. The spices are perfect and I followed the prior reviewer's recommendation to allow the carrots to carmelize before adding the broth. The lemon juice added just the right amount of acide. I'm making it again as soon as I can get to the market to purchase more carrots.

i made this for guests last night who raved about every bit of the recipe. i read all reviews first,and actually did the carrots twice-you have to make sure they start to brown, i think this insures dehydration so when you add the chicken soup,it gets quickly absorbed by them.

I actually was looking for something to do with my abundance of fresh mint, so I modified the pesto to please my family. I used peanuts instead of pistachios, and substituted jarred garlic since I didn't have any fresh on hand. It worked! I served it over grilled salmon and it was a big hit. The carrots were really delicious as well.

I don't know how anyone could have liked this. I made the carrots PRECISELY as instructed and they came out soupy and runny. All of the spices fell off of them and into the soupiness. The fish was ok, but the pesto was too strong. I won't make this again. Yuck.

I didn't think the mint pesto did anything for the bass. In fact, it covered up the taste of the fish, which was yummy. However, the pesto was good with roasted potatoes, as someone already mentioned.

I've made this 3 times this summer - outstanding! I made one small alteration the last time I made the recipe - i only used 2 TBSP. chicken stock and thought the spices came through a lot better and the carrots were nicely crisp-tender. The spice mixture and the pesto are good all-around recipes too. I made roasted potatoes using the spice mix and they were divine. Planning to use the pesto on some salmon tonight.

This is an exceptional recipe and would be a good "company" dish. The pesto is wonderful--we'll use it on other dishes. Be sure to serve with rice, a small pasta or a grain. The broth is very tasty & you'll want to soak up every bit of it.

We caught our own fish and grilled the fillets, but otherwise followed the fish and pesto recipes exactly. The pesto was outstanding. We served the fish with grilled asparagus and corn--a memorable meal.

This was in the latest magazine - so it just came out - and I've already made it several times! No changes required - I've just reduced the oil when cooking the carrots and fish - but otherwise made it just as directed and loved it.
