I prefer the sauce without the sesame oil - it's way too strong for the other flavors. Without the sesame oil, though, the sauce is awesome. Just like my mom's ginger chicken...okay almost.

I thought this was a really subtle, classy dish and my guests loved it. We served it with cold seasme spinach which had a strong flavor that went well with the chicken.

Basic, but tastes good and is so easy to prepare. The remaining soup stock is great for use in other recipes. I do admit that more of the flavor is in the sauce, not the chicken. I am experimenting by adding soy sauce, sugar, and scallions to the boiling water and increasing the sherry cooking wine. This recipe is very similar to Cold Poached Chicken with Chinese Garlic Sauce.

I thought this recipe was rather flavorless.
