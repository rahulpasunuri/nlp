This was a quick and easy recipe. I used rice noodles instead and found that I needed 10 oz. to be enough for two people! I used fresh bean sprouts instead of lettuce and added thai basil at the end. Simple and relish!

Delicious! I heated the onions, garlic, and ginger with the spices (cut the cloves to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground coriander and 1/2 tsp cinnamon) until fragrant, then added the broth. Served with fresh mint, cilantro, basil and lots of lemon slices. Also Spriracha sauce. Fantastic and easy

Really tasty- whole family loved it. I used Napa cabbage instead of lettuce and ground cloves instead of whole (didn't have any). My veggie-hating son kept adding more cabbage-- go figure!

Whenever I have a cold, I crave a spicy soup. So I looked on epicurious (as I always do) and saw this recipe. This soup was exactly what I needed! While it wasn't exactly like pho, it was close enough and super-easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little cardamon and cinammon while omitting half the cloves. From now on, whenever I have a cold, I'm making this soup!!

We love this soup. I found it easy to make and very flavorful. I like to add extra star anise and lime juice. YUM!

Ok so maybe it's not authentic but it IS easy and delicious. I made a large pot and ate it for lunch at work all week.

The REAL recipe - Boil oxtail in a large pot. Spoon all the scum out. - Drain all the water out and wash the oxtail bones. Fill your pot with cold water and place the bones back in the pot. Bring to a boil. - Add 2 3-inch long pieces of peeled daikon, palm sized piece of ginger and 1 medium onion, 2 star anise, 1 stick cinnamon, 3 cardamon pods. - Simmer 2 hours. Add 3 1 1/2 inch pieces of rock sugar and salt to taste. Remove the bones, veggies and spices. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER serve with lettuce!

I was excited to see this recipe just after I got back from vacationing in Viet Nam. After trying it, I was a little disappointed. Although it was a good soup recipe, it certainly wasn't pho, ah well, guess there are certain foods that you just have to travel half way around the world to get right! :)

This dish is totally easy and delicious! We've made it several times for a quick, light meal. Two thumbs up from Kamloops, BC.

I'd have to say this recipe is pretty far off. Perhaps it is pho-inspired, but it isn't the real thing. Rice noodles, first of all, are the right noodles to use. Of course, it's always better if you make the broth from real beef bones or oxtail (note that oxtail adds great flavor, but the broth gets cloudy and stewy). But if you can't, you should at least have the right spices. Too many cloves will make it taste like pumpkin pie pho. I think you also need a stick of cinnamon and some cardomom pods, and more fish sauce. Also, roasting the onions and ginger first intensify the flavors (just put them over the gas flame on the stove like roasting a pepper). Finally, chicken pho is also very good, but the broth is made from chicken, not beef. That's a separate science altogether.

A nice enough Americanized version. I'll make it when I'm too lazy to make the real thing. The comment from the Vietnamese reviewer is correct, any Vietnamese guests would be horrified by the lettuce. Two comments: that is way two much cloves, maybe 1/2t at most, and bean thread is so NO WAY! for this dish. It is served with rice noodles (the flat kind of whatever width, not round ones). Chicken is also nice, cook in broth and shred.

This soup was very tasty. I also took the reviewer advice and put the bean sprouts, cilantro and mint. It added such a nice fresh taste. We also used the lime juice, hoisin sauce and hot sauce. Very good.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 8 oz. fresh bean sprouts, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, 1/4 cup cilantro, juice of 1/2 lime,amd 4-5 shakes of hot sauce instead of shredded lettuce amd lemon wedges. Also mixed in one teaspoon of hoison sauce per serving.Instead of two medium oinions, I used 8 boiling onions, peeled and halved. The soup came out perfectly, as good or better than the restaurant versions I have tried.

I have not tried this recipe, but I am Vietnamese and we do NOT add sliced lettuce in the traditional soup, called pho. We do add a handful of bean sprouts, mint leaves, cilantro leaves and lime juice. Some people add a teaspoon of hoisin sauce and some hot sauce. Add the vegetables when the soup is still very hot and mix it up, so that the heat blances the bean sprouts. Another suggestion is to put some hoisin sauce on the side, for the kids to dip their meat in.

My family was a bit skeptical when I told them what we were having for dinner, but at the end of the meal they wanted to know when I was going to make it again! A definite keeper!

I have a dear friend from Vietnam that made her recipe for this soup and served it to my husband and myself for dinner when we lived in Washington D.C. This recipe is very close to her recipe and is just delicious. Thank you !

While at the Asian market, the Vietnamese clerk suggested adding bean sprouts and hot sauce (sambel) when serving. She also suggested I substitute Gia Vi Nau Pho (Pho Hoa) a sort of spice tea bag for the cloves and anise. It was outstanding. Even my picky 12 year old loved it.
