Agree that the potatoes needed some more cook time than the recipe suggested. I think the recipe overall also needs some extra heat. We used fire roasted tomatoes canned WITH green chiles, and think it made a big difference in the final product as far as amping up the heat and adding some more depth to the flavor. (I also subbed a little cayenne for paprika.)

This was average at best. The recipe times were way off (18 minutes to cook onions, and 5 minutes to cook potatoes?) and I thought the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. I picked out the shrimp and ate it, but the rest was dumped down the sink.

My husband said this was one of the best things i've made in a while!!! I agreed! Although I made a few changes... I put fresh thyme instead of the rosemary, made a stock with the shrimp shells instead of useing the clam juice and finished the soup with a gremoulada (parsley, garlic and lemon zest). Also i served some lemon wedges on the side. It was beautiful! I cant wait to make this for a dinner party!

This was OK, but not worth repeating. It was not the best use of shrimp in my opinion.

So easy. So delicious. Broth like bouillabaisse. Had everything except for clam juice on hand at home.

Excellent recipe, though I took others' suggestions and added some Spanish chorizo (1/2 lb - maybe next time I'll use 1/4) and used smoked paprika instead of regular. Next time I'll omit the crushed red pepper. Potatoes took around 15 minutes to cook, even when sliced thinner than suggested in the recipe. Otherwise, though, came out great!

I found this to be delicious (with a few minor changes)! I made the time consuming broth a day in advance while preparing dinner for the current night - so it didn't seem like such a long process to me. I substituted fresh thyme for the rosemary...and because we were feeling shrimped-out, I used tilapia instead. I found the 3 cups of water to be too much, so I continued to reduce the broth. It was sweet, a hint spicy, and thick and rich. Would work fine with shrimp.

I was drawn to the unusual ingredient combo, but in the end found this was only so-so. Following the recipe exactly did yield an earthy and sweet tomato broth, but the end result did not justify the long cooking process. In retrospect, it seems odd that the recipe called for clam juice when shrimp stock is so easy to make. I suspect that the addition of smoked paprika and/or chorizo, as suggested by others, would have enhanced the recipe.

I was reluctant to try this because I'm not a huge fan of shrimp in tomato-based sauce. Tomato seems to me that it usually overwhelms delicate seafood flavors. I made it exactly as written, and it still seemed less a broth, and more a "sauce", and therefore not subtle enough for my $20.00 a pound shrimp. But it wasn't bad . . .

I had hoped for something more special given ingredients and some other reviews. It was an OK soup, but nothing all that special. I pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave a bit to avoid waiting a long time for them to boil. That sped things up. Also added sausage per some other suggestions and even a little tomato paste. But it was just not that great. It did contrast well with fresh sour dough bread. But I won't bother again. Seems we can find a better use for shrimp.

With a loaf of crispy bread and a green salad, this makes a delicious dinner. I made a couple of changes: I omitted all of the water, which cut down on the cooking time and made a very rich, nice broth. I also omitted the rosemary (personal dislike).

This was an easy dish, although it definitely takes time. My husband and I both loved it. I think the key is to really cook everything down, first the onion, then the tomatoes, then after adding the wine. Next time I would add a bit more crushed red pepper. Also, I think this would be good with a variety of seafood, particularly scallops (as mentioned by others) or fish.

I attempted this the other night - It was good, and I think I may try it again. I say attempted cause the broth did not get a chance to cool completely prior to dinner - think this is key. So, I opted to throw in a can of tomato paste, basil and paramsan cheese last minute and served it over pasta.It was really good this way. The next day what remained of the broth was far more tasty (which is why I do it again)and we turned that into soup. So the flavor are really good the cooking times are off - but it was un-real how much better the broth tasted the next day..(only used about half for the pasta). They only changes I made were the addition of Sausage I also used smoked paprika - weird review but a great way to salvage if you're not sure of the flavor or you don't have time to let it cool.

I've made this twice now. It's a convenient, satisfying dish, but not something I'd serve anyone else. As noted elsewhere, the cooking times are way off base. The first time I made this, I substituted bay scallops for 1/2 of the shrimp. It greatly improved the dish, adding a nice bit of nutty sweetness.

I loved this recipe! I know it's supposed to be healthy, but I actually added a little heavy cream at the last minute, and what a change! I also increased the number of potatoes. Next time I may add some corn on the cob cut into two inch sections, and increase the broth a little. I would recommend making the broth in advance it took longer than I anticipated.

It always so interesting when there are such polarized reactions to a recipe. I think there are several reasons people found this bland. First and foremost, it needs salt during the cooking Fire roasted tomatoes are sweet and not salty at all. I've learned from experience using them that they may require more salt that regular canned tomatoes. This was a dish I kept tasting until it was "right." And it was pretty bland without the seasoning adjusted. I added fresh ground pepper to my serving at the table and it bloomed. I also cooked the tomatoes slowly for the full thirty minutes. They continued cooking down and giving off juice most of that time. I think the long cooking deepens the flavor , even though the tomatoes look thick fairly quickly . I also added smoked Hungarian paprika as part of the paprika, and then a little more to taste later. About the potatoes: My husband, who has great knife skills, sliced them a little less than a quarter inch thick and they cooked part way in 6 minutes and completely by the time the shrimp were done. So, this is a nice recipe that looked quicker that it is. Don't skimp on the time, or the salt.

Cannot believe people love this recipe as much as they say they do. I made it and followed the recipe exactly. It was a big waste of yummy, expensive shrimp. The taste was nothing to write home about. If I had ordered this at a restaurant, I would have sent it back. I will not be making it again.

I thought this was delicious. The only modification I made was that instead of using 3 cups of water, I used up a leftover container of chicken stock (about 2 cups) and added enough water to make 3 cups total. The broth is thin (read broth, not sauce), but it was very good. A bit of romano cheese on top was also tasty.

This was tasty. My husband and kids liked it. But it felt like a lot of work and took longer to make than I expected. I'll probably make it again, but might add a few extras... like fresh baby spinach during the last few minutes with the shrimp to give the soup a little more bulk. I also think adding some sausge would make it a more robust meal.

Yuck. We didn't have clam juice. Maybe that was the secret ingredient. This was not good.

Great recipe -- I made my own broth by boiling the shrimp shells with wine, water and salt and substituted that for the clam juice. Very tasty and easy.

Rating: 0
Like others, I thought this was very good. The paprika needs to cook a while to blend with the other flavors, so if your tomatoes thicken too fast, it would make sense to add a little water then and keep cooking for the 30 minutes called for. Also like others, I added some scallops and leftover fish (and fresh basil) at the very end.

I received my issue of Bon Appetit just in time for Valentines day.I saw this and it looked and sounded great so my husband and I tried it for our special Valentines day dinner.It was outstanding! I would not change a thing.Be sure to test for S&P though it did need salt at the end.Served with the excellent wedge salad from this site as well.Will keep this on our favorite list for sure.

This is fabulous! I doubled the tomatoes and instead of the water added shrimp stock. Like the rest of the reviewers, I cooked the potatoes alot longer. The flavors are out of this world!

If anyone else may want to try this, we are on a diet here and we substituted asparagus for the potatoes. Delicious.

Very good. Needs a little more red pepper and potatoes don't cook in 5 minutes.

Lovely. 1 stove top fire roasted red pepper + 1 can tomatoes = fire roasted tomatoes (in a pinch). Yum. Broth was not runny, boosted spices with pimenton and paprika.

The broth this makes is great for soaking up crusty bread. I wonder how this would work with fish as well (like Snapper or Grouper)?

Wonderful - enjoyed this thoroughly. I added some roasted peppers and since I had no fire roasted tomatoes, I used canned plum tomatoes, with juice removed, baked at 500C for about 20 minutes. Great. Not sure how anyone could say this was a waste of shrimp!

I have all the ingredients to make this wonderful sounding dish. I like to read comments before following a recipe because what others experience with recipes play an important part as their hints are valuable. Really enjoy the creative cooks ideas.

This was a wonderful, cold-night dinner. Unlike the other recent reviewers, I didn't find the broth too watery at all. It was perfect for dipping some good bread into. I made the broth on a Sunday night, then on Monday after work, all I had to do was add potatoes and shrimp. That made for an easy week-night dinner. Like others, my tomatoes thickened faster than the recipe suggests, so use your judgment on that. We added some sriracha before serving to increase the spiciness a bit. We will definitely be making this all winter!

found this recipe to have to much water.The amount of water seem to water the broth to much. It took away the flavors that were made before you add the water. I do not think i'll try this again

This wasn't nearly as good as I had expected. Cooked the recipe exactly as stated (though the tomatoes were done much more quickly than expected and the potatoes took much longer). I found the broth flat, maybe even a little acidic, and adding more pepper and rosemary didn't help. And though my husband liked it more than me, we agreed not to try again.

I agree with the cook from Ellicot City review of times listed in the recipe. My tomatoes also cooked down very quickly and the potatoes took almost 20 minutes. Other than adjusting the cooking times, this recipe is wonderful. Fire roasted tomatoes are a must - do not substitute.

I don't normally rate a recipe if I change it however since this turned out very successfully with the modifications I figured it would be ok to share. This recipe turned out very tasty. I had double shrimp and double the amount of potatoes so I increased the liquids by adding an extra bottle of clam juice some extra garlic and paprika and instead of the fire roasted tomatoes I had Mexican style stewed tomatoes with chilis on hand already so I processed them and they were pretty thick already when I added them to the onion mixture so I didn't wait long before I added the hot peppers and all the liquids. I too had to boil the potatoes for almost 1/2 an hour so keep that in mind if you are planning your meal for a particular time. Definately worth a try, nice meal.

Very good! The times in the recipe are deceiving ... the tomatoes were thick in far less than 30 minutes and the potatoes took a bit longer to cook than the 10 minutes allotted so trust your senses here! When the tomatoes are THICK as in no liquid, move on. And test the potatoes before adding the shrimp. Other than that, truly delicious results! Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! Loved every spoonful of it. Added more red pepper for kick and additional rosemary towards the end for more intense flavor - the contrast between these two ingredients is exciting to the taste buds! I'd take a little more time cooking the potatoes or slice them thinner.

This was fabulous! Super easy to make and yummmmmmy. Everyone in my house loved it the first night. The second night, my husband (chef), decided to take a hand mixer to it. It blended up the potatoes and prawns into a chunky soup. He then added shredded chicken, black beans and fresh lime juice with some more heat (either sriracha or red pepper flakes). It was AWESOME and I recommend doing this for your meal the next night!

this was really good and simple. i'd suggest using some tomato paste or concentrate as a previous reviewer suggested. be sure and cook the the onions down as the recipe calls for. overall, a winner.

Wow. Wow. And Wow. So easy, and so wonderfully flavorful. I took one of the reviewer's tip regarding cooking the potatoes a little longer, which was definitely wise. The only alterations I made were we added some quartered sea scallops a minute before we served the meal, and used a bit more rosemary than it calls for. This is definitely a keeper. So easy, and healthy.

Absolutely fabulous! We thought we wouldn't like it because it was like a soup but we just loved it. I added more like 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and it had just the right kick that we enjoy with our food. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is great for a light, but comforting winter/soup dish. My husband loved it, but I think I may add some tomatoe paste to intensify the flavor next time. Either way, we will make it again - alot of flavor and a healthy dish for the right amount of effort...Enjoy!

This was a really nice dish and pretty easy to make. The broth is excellent. My only complaint is that the potatoes took way longer to cook through in the broth than the 10 minutes called for in the recipe. Other than that, an especially nice winter shrimp dish with nice flavors.
