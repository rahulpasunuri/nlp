These barbecued wings were exactly what I was hoping for--not-too-sweet sauce that clung to the chicken, making every bite delicious. We made the sauce exactly as written, and found it to be just the right amount of spiciness for adults; not sure how kids would enjoy it, though it's not as hot as restaurant-style barbecued wings. Easy, quick preparation--definitely a keeper!

The sauce was very easy to make. I grilled the wings. I skipped the chili and the tabasco for my toddlers.

this sauce is fabulous. I added flat leaf parsley to help marry the flavors and kept adding water as it continued to reduce. have experimented with different levels of hotness and less ketchup. It is a NO FAIL recipe!! Thank you!!

The first time I made these I actually forgot to put the water in. I didn't notice until after we had eaten them, but they were still delicious. Without water the BBQ sauce was thicker and stuck to the wings so we got all the delicious flavor. Every time I make these now I leave out the water and they're SO GOOD! We make them every time we want a nice spicy wing.

this was a crowd pleaser! the BBQ sause was amazing!!! I went a little light on the Tabasco sauce (I used about 1tbs) because I was making it for a crowd and didnt want to over-whelm them, I made this for a party, and while I dont eat chicken it got raves from every one else...my only suggestion is to line your pan with aluminum and spray it with PAM before putting the chicken on it, you will get a stickey mess and this helps with the clean up. Also a side note- I did this on both wings and drum sticks and both vanished, in future I will probably skip the wings, its a lot of work to cut them up (and its kind of gross).

It is a hot, 90+ degree day today. I wanted to have chicken on the Barbecue. I made this sauce, wanting to have something new. It is so good. We cooked it outside and it is great. Thank you

Very yummy. Yes, do turn halfway through as the cook below said. I used a normal baking sheet with aluminum foil instead of a broiler pan (maybe this was a mistake, because the sauce that dripped off the wings had burned before the chicken got crispy. However, this tasted great! It was spicy, but not too spicy!

The amount of pepper and tobasco sauce together would have been way too much, so I am glad I only used the tobasco sauce and held the chili pepper. Other than that, very good! My chicken did not turn out crispy, however...

Very tasty chicken wings -- the sauce wasn't too sweet and just the right amount of spiciness for my family. Be sure to turn the wings half-way through cooking time. I baked them on a broiler pan so the excess liquid drained away and left the wings nice and crispy.
