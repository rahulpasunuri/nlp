Great sauce for technique but it was a little bland, tasted like stock and flour. I didn't have tomato paste so I added some red wine and rosemary for the last 15 mins of simmering. Added great flavor and body.

I have made MANY beef tenderloin recipes and this one is fabulous. There is only a little (1/4 cup) tomato puree in the sauce so not much tomato flavor. Perhaps the people who didn't like it used tomato paste? The sauce is just a rich brown sauce and the mushrooms were delicious. Will definitely make again.

I, too, was underwhelmed by the Espagnole sauce. It might be perfect for something else, but I feel the tomato puree in this recipe took the sauce down from a fine-dining level.

A great, simple dish to prepare for an otherwise busy day in the kitchen. Followed roasting/sitting times to a T and the meat was perfect. The sauce came out a bit on the thick side, and i used demi-glace. Would make again with a 1/2 demiglace, 1/2 stock combo and watch the flour.

I had this over at my MIL's house for Christmas Eve dinner. She told me it was very simple to make, as all she really needed to do was make the sauce the day before. That day was merely roasting, making the pan sauce, and assembly- a breeze. The sauce perfectly complemeneted the tenderloin, which was cooked to absolute, rare perfection. I enjoyed it so much that I'll be making it for my own folks, this weekend when they over to do a late holiday celebration.

This dish is great for Christmas dinner. Fast and easy to make. Although, as with most roaasted meat recipes from Gourmet, I increased the cooking time to 40 minutes, and reduced the sitting time to 10-15 minutes. The meat was still medium rare and tender. The gravy is different and a good complement.

You can't go wrong with this beef tenderloin and everyone seems to love it.

I made the beef tenderloin, potatoes and creamed spinach for dinner last night and everything was delicious. I used organic beef stock rather than homemade. It made it simpler and quicker.

Quite underwhelmed with the Espagnole sauce- long time to prepare, and would much prefer a more tradtitional gravy (esp. if this is for Christmas dinner as featured in the magazine this month)- or one with port would be nice partner to the mushrooms and the meat- this sauce seemed more suited to a pasta and I don't think worth the time.
