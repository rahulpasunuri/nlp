I thought this was delicious and easy to make. I made it for the pistachio cake on this site (which is excellent), so I left out the orange zest and only made a half batch. It was perfect. The half batch was a good amount for a 9" round two-layer cake. To ensure it would firm up properly, I used whipped cream that was pasteurized, not unpasteurized. I stuck my mixing bowl in the freezer for about 20 minutes before whipping the ingredients together and kept the ingredients in the fridge until the last minute. I also chilled it for an hour or so before frosting the cake. Thanks to other reviewers for the great tips. I would definitely make this again-- it would taste good with many types of cakes.

Re: firmness problem with whipped cream - do not use ultra pasturized whipped cream. It will not hold up! And, unfortunately, all organic cream is ultra-pasteurized.

Very tasty. Looking forward to eating the cake! Like other reviewers I whipped it over an ice bath. It still look a pretty long time and didn't firm completely until I added a tablespoon of meringue powder. Be patient! I used Horizon Organic Heavy Whipping Cream and I've noticed that brand takes longer to firm. I chilled it a while before frosting the Strawberry Basket Cake. It was quite easy to frost and stayed cold enough (keep the bowl in the fridge and refill your pastry bag if needed). The directions for the basket-weave pattern are helpful.

What the recipe failed to mention is to whip all ingredients in an ice bath for a minute or two. My older KitchenAid Model K5SS has a Ice Bath Attachment and never had a problem with it, so no need to change or substitute recipe.

I had difficulty getting this recipe to firm up, so I combined the it with the recipe from the epicurious dictionary (note, cut in 1/3rd): combine 1 cup whipping cream with 2 tbsp. buttermilk in a glass container, let stand 8 to 24 hours until thickened, stir and refrigerate overnight. Stir in 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp. grated orange peel. Mixture will form stiff peaks with hand beater in 1 to 2 minutes.

This was absolutely delicious. It is easier to spread the whipped cream if you chill it for about 1/2 - 1 hour after whipping.

Very delicious-- the orange flavor compliments the strawberries in the cake. When I whipped this, I put the bowl of cream into a larger bowl filled with ice. That helped keep my cream chilled. If you are using a hand blender, you just need to be patient; it will take several minutes before you get the right consistency.
