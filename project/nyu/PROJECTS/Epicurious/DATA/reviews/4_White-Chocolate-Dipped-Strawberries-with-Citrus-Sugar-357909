I love these strawberries and make them all the time when I want something special. And every time I make them, people are bowled over by them. I usually use chocolate rather than white chocolate simply because my partner doesn't like white and they are still spectacular. Tonight is New Year's and we'll be having these along with the bubbly at midnight. Simple, elegant, delicious.

Quick, easy, elegant -- and wonderful flavor. What more could one ask for? I've made these different ways: white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate; orange/lemon sugar, orange sugar, lemon sugar etc. They are simply a winner all ways. Just made some for dinner tonight--dark chocolate with orange sugar.

Delicious and very easy, and they make a classy-looking dessert! Will definitely make these again. My only suggestion is to avoid letting the citrus zest sit mixed with the sugar for too long (discovered this when I tried to prep ahead)... it makes the sugar wet and lumpy, and you end up with clumps of mushy sugar instead of crystals of citrus sugar (much easier to sprinkle).

Very good. watch out the white chocolate can be a bit to sweet

These are wonderful, but make sure you use a white chocolate bar which contains cocoa butter. The white chocolate chips do not have cocoa butter and will not melt properly. Instead the chocolate scorched and turned into almost a cement mixture when I put them in the microwave to melt. I found this out the hard way, and had to go out and buy extra.

My Mother made these for her bridge club and they all loved them. I then tried to make them for a Sunday Brunch. My white choc was too old so I had to use 60% coco at the last minute. They turned out nice but the white choc is a different wonderful taste. Will make again, and again and again - w/ white choc.

What went wrong with the chocolate? It never melted smoothly enough and it was a little disaster.

Very simple to make and a delicious twist on the usual chocolate dipped strawberries. I took these to a wine tasting and they were a huge hit!

Very tasty and easy to make. I made white chocolate with lemon sugar and milk chocolate with tangerine sugar and made a pretty arrangement on a tray. Serve with a nice dessert wine like moscato or late harvest riesling or an icewine to make a sophisticated dessert.

Amazing! We didn't have oranges so we used lemon and lime zest instead. It almost had a key lime pie flavor to it. A wonderful and easy desert!

Simple to make and delicious! I just used regular white chocolate chips and this was still great.

Delicious and oh, so easy. i've prepared these quite a few times already and they've been a hit. The citrus sugar is the bomb!

Terrific. Pat the sugar into the strawberries just a little while the chocolate is warm, to help make the sugar stick.

This is actually a very simple, yet impressive dessert treat which is a breeze to make. The citrus sugar adds a very special touch.
