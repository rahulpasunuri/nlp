This dish was simple to make, and didn't taste too bad.

Simple and delicious. The earthiness of the mushrooms shines through. Our portobellos were on the small side, so we reduced the grilling time by a couple of minutes.

I have had some wonderful dishes from epicurious and this simply was not one of them. It just felt not properly put together.

I agree thoroughly with what everyone else said. I used spinach penne, which has a great color and light taste, plus the added nutrition. I also added some sliced yellow zucchini which I sauteed with the portobello. You can cook the veggies any way-grilled, sauteed, or broiled, and i think it'll turn out very well with all.

We really liked this one - it's due for repeating. I was a little afraid it would be dull, and a bit too earthy, given whole wheat pasta and mushrooms, but it wasn't. Maybe the pecorino brightened it up, maybe the fresh herbs. Recommended!

Really liked this one....and I don't even really like mushrooms that much! I sauteed the mushrooms and it was still good.

This is a fantastic recipe! I was nervous that it would be a bit bland, but it was just delicious! Earthy and bold. I didn't have any fresh oregano or marjoram on hand. Instead, I substituted a a few pinches of both herbs dried and it was just great! Try this one out. You will be pleasantly surprised. I know I'll be making it again!

Delicious and ridiculously easy, though maybe just a bit earthier than we usually like. Still an excellent base recipe (a busy weeknight lifesaver, really) and one I look forward to playing with more in future.

I was completely skeptical and convinced that something so simple would be bland but was I wrong. Outstanding - it pays to use quality ingredients, but exceptional in every way.

This is an excellent meatless main course with a salad or serve as a side dish. I used the fresh oregano. My husband raved over it.
