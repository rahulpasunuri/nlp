Excellent!But could reduce butter a little everywhere - crust and filling.

This is the first pie I've ever made, and I was (surprisingly!) pleased with the results. I refrigerated the dough for a few hours before rolling it out, and had no issues transferring it to the pie dish. I used half Golden Delicious, half Pink Lady apples for the filling, and probably a bit more butter (in the filling) than the recipe called for. I had no problems getting it into the oven, either. The only issue was that the crust browned way more quickly than I'd anticipated- I ended up taking the pie out when it had about 25 minutes left to bake, and covering sections of the crust with tinfoil to prevent burning. I'm glad I did. It smelled great while baking, and I can't wait to serve it to my family tomorrow on Christmas Eve!

Hands down, THE best apple pie I've ever made. It got more requests this past Thanksgiving than the Maple-Bourbon Pecan Pie I've been bringing for years. Definitely a permanent addition to the recipe box.

Absolutely perfect with homemade crema gelato with addition of vanilla bean from epicurious.com. This pie may replace my old staple from Bon Appeitit 11/97 that included only one type of apple and dried tart cherries-another winner for sure!

I thought the crust was very, very good. I will make this again, but I will cut back on the lemon peel to less than a teaspoon. It was simply overpoweringly lemony ... not awful, just not a flavor that I want to be that present in an apple pie.

This recipe, with some minor modifications, produced the best apple pie I've made yet. My changes: 1 1/2 cups butter instead of butter+shortening for the crust, cornstarch instead of tapioca (even quick-cooking tapioca stays hard and grainy in my experience) and flour instead of graham crumbs for the filling, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and omitted the raisins. The lemon peel is fantastic! And I really liked having a slightly sweet crust, rather than the sugarless pate brisee that I usually make for pie crusts.

I made this pie yesterday. I chose this recipe mainly for the pie crust recipe. The apple pie filling for any recipe is so dependent on the quality of apples available in your market, it's always a roll of the dice as to how that comes out. The Pie crust recipe uses alot of butter and the ratio to the flour is very different from what I've used in the past. I followed the recipe exactly, and when it was time to roll out the dough, DISASTER!! As soon as the dough hit my wooden board, it became gooey. I ended up scraping up gobs of pie goo off of the parchment paper and spreading it with my spatula into the pie plate. When it came time to roll out the upper crust. I panicked. How in the world can I make this work? For this part I got rid of the parchment paper, flooded my surface with flour and prayed to the pie dough gods for forgiveness for altering the fat/flour ratio so drastically. I put flour and then parchment paper on top to keep the rolling pin from sticking and went at it. IT WORKED! I did not butter the pan, nor added the extra 1/4 cup of butter chunks to the pie filling. What was the point? There's so much butter in the filling! It turned out perfectly though, and this has got to be the flakiest, most flavorful crust I've ever made. The challenge for us Floridians will always be to factor in the extreme heat and humidity we enjoy, even at Thanksgiving. When the economy improves, I might invest in 1 of those marble slabs and chill it before I try to roll out this dough again. But for you Northerners, go for it!

To answer your question about the pie dough - I cover the counter with plastic wrap and tape it down so it won't move. Then I sprinkle some flour on top and put the dough down, cover it with a little more flour and a large couple of pieces of plastic wrap and roll it out that way. Once rolled out I peel the top plastic wrap off and peel the tape back on the bottom pieces. Next I flip the doup over and place on top of the pie plate or pie and peel the plastic wrap off. If it won't come off easily I put it back in the fridge to stiffen up a little. A lot of work and a little messy but well worth it!

Question for bakers regarding the dough: I didn't make this recipe yet because I need to solve this problem first. I've make similar pastry doughs twice before and though it tasted great, when I rolled out the dough for the crust, the dough was really sticky and would shrink back to size. I sprinkled more flour on the rolling pin and surface in order to solve this problem, but it seemed to make the dough brittle by the time it was ready to be transferred to the pie plate. This made it a major challenge transferring it in one piece. Suggestions?

The crust is excellent. The filling... not so much. It was mushy and bland. Try making this crust with the Rum Raisin Apple Pie recipe on this site (omitting the raisins, if you wish). Now THAT'S an apple pie!

Amazing Apple Pie Recipe. I made it with half Granny Smith & half Fuji apples. I thought the small amount of nutmeg wouldn't be enough spice but it was delicious. The crust was the best-so flaky and a wonderful flavor. Boyfriend called it "killer crust" and he usually leaves that part on the plate. I'll definitely be making this again.

Next time, however, I will use Granny Smith if I cannot find Pippin to add tartness.

I made this pie today for my roommate's birthday. The crust was excellent and had a very flaky texture that went nicely with the apples. I used a combination of golden delicious and braeburn apples (I couldn't find Pink Lady or Pippin). I thought the raisins were a nice addition, but if you have picky children I suppose they could be left out. And, true to it's description, this pie was very nicely spiced (it actually tasted old-fashioned, if that makes sense). I plan on making this again for Thanksgiving.

I loved this apple pie recipe. I made it with half Golden Delicious and half Granny Smith because I couldn't find Pink Ladies, and I think the apple flavor and texture would likely be improved with the right apples (the filling came out a bit like firm applesauce). Overall, it was just delicious. The pie crust had a bit more taste (sweet and salt) than the recipe I normally use.

This was the very first time I made a pie crust from scratch and it was scrumptious! I followed all the instructions, except I added only half the amount of sugar to the filling (I find most recipes too sweet) and I didn't butter the pie plate (with all that butter, it didn't seem necessary and the crust did not stick to the pan). The sprinkling of sugar on the top crust makes it look very pretty, and the apples cut in wedges rather than slices give this pie an appealing down-home look.

Delicious! An amazing crust. The raw sugar adds a nice crunch to the top. I omitted the raisins and used a mixture of McIntosh and Jonagold apples.
