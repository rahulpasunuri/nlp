OK, four forks, but I changed things somewhat. First, I used whole cumin and coriander, toasted, and ground the toasted seeds with some peppercorns in my spice grinder. Second, I ignored the ratios/quantities of the ingredients in the recipe; I "eyeballed" all of the ingredients, tasting along the way. Third, I added salt. Rubbed on some chicken thighs - it was really, really good.

Not very tasty or zesty. I would add a TABLESPOON of cayenne and something else. Anything else. Mostly tasteless.

This recipe is terrible! I've used cumin in recipes before and never had an issue with it, but now I doubt I'll be able to eat it again after this. The smell was horrible and so was the taste. The ratio of cumin to the other ingredients is ridiculous - there's way to much of it. If you want to give this one a try, and you LOVE cumin, I would still reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon, rather than 1/4 cup as recommended.

If you like cumin, it's very good. I had it at a friend's house over chicken thighs and I used it on chicken legs. Grilled on indirect heat. It was very good but, I will use it more sparingly the next time.
