I have made the jam for this recipe several times ... I have added hot chili flakes to give it a little snap and use it as a condiment on cheese platters. Excellent! And a great way to use the excess tomatoes from the garden ...

I used ground turkey breast and added the spices directly to the turkey, then shaped them into "meatballs", sprayed a disposable aluminum pan with olive oil and baked in the oven for 40 minutes at 350. I left out the flour, cornmeal, salt and olive oil. For the tomato jam, I used slightly less than 1/4 cup of splenda and again eliminated the salt. The aroma permeated the house. I served it with a green salad and used some leftover jelly for a dressing. Being a weight watcher, I'm always looking for new ways to make low point meals. This is a keeper!

This is wonderful and another way to eat healthy. The only substitution was a 1/4 cup of agave syrup for the sugar. The jam simmered nicely in under an hour in an large 3 qt. saute pan. (it needed tended to keep the simmer up) Since I used a 14" skillet for the turkey, I needed about 1 tablespoons of olive oil for each batch, or a couple spins around the pan. I had the demi-glace and it proved to add that special touch to the plate, and taste to the pallet.

3.5 stars. The jam is great. I doubled it and am glad I did because it reduces down to such a small amount. I think I could actually eat it on toast. As other reviewers have noted, it takes much longer than an hour. I simmered it for close to two. If your tomatoes are drier, you may be able to do it in an hour. Did not have coarse cornmeal so used fine ground and I think I would prefer that in the future. It cut down on the raw and gritty taste you sometimes get in coating applications with the coarse grind. Loved how fast this came together once the jam was ready. 5 minutes to saute the turkey and dinner was on. Served with a baby greens salad. If I kept the jam in the fridge (and I may be tempted to make a large batch and keep it around), this couldn't be beat for a fast and healthy dinner.

I thought this was pretty simple (I actually just cut the turkey breast thin instead of pounding) and tasty. The tomato jam was my favorite part and I will be making much more of that.

This was very very very good. But hard to believe that it's that healthy, given the amount of sugar and oil you use (can't remember the last time I pan fried anything, as I am a total health nut, and we had to use way more oil than the amount indicated to fry all of the medallions). Also, it takes waaaaay more time to make the tomato jam than you would think. We had to simmer that bad boy for almost 2 1/2 hours to get a jam consistency, so don't do this recipe if you're rushed.

I only made the tomato jam, so that's what I am reviewing. Unlike previous reviewers, my jam actually evaporated rather quickly, after about 45 minutes it was very thick. Guess it depends on the width of your sauce pan and your burner heat. I found the jam a bit too sweet for my liking, and will cut back to under a 1/4 c. sugar next time. Otherwise, a great condiment to any grilled meet.

Oh! My! Gosh! The tomato jam is heavenly! - Actually, I didn't make it entirely as written - used a can of stewed tomatoes ... but it was still awesome. I also didn't do the turkey medallions. I used turkey breast fillets, cut a deep pocket in each and stuffed with sauteed mixed mushrooms and a little Mozzarella cheese, bundled each fillet in aluminum foil and baked for a hour and then topped with the jam. I used a half turkey breast fillet for each portion and it was ample and everybody raved about it. Will definitely use this for future dinner parties! Low fat and totally yummy!

Very light and delicious. I, too, was a bit wary of the consistancy of the jam, so I simmered mine significantly longer than the recipe suggested. I served it with steamed asparagus with a spicy lemon vinaigrette.

I served this dish with the Spinach Strawberry Vinegarette salad and it went down really well. The turkey was delicious and the tomato jam was so yummy. Instead of plum tomatoes I used canned chopped tomatoes with natural juices, and I found the texture and consistency of the jam to be perfect. It was very flavouful and I can't wait to make it again!

2 forks as is- 3 forks with some tweaking.The 'jam' reduced down to a dehydrated looking marinara after a bit over an hour but the flavor was there. I mixed a 1/2 pack unflavored gelatin with a small amt. cold water, let it sit a minute then stirred it in.Poured the mix into heart shaped ramekins and let it set in the fridge. The turkey was yum but you must expect the texture of uncooked cornmeal- this becomes more tolerable after one glass of wine. I served the turkey neatly on a plate with the cold jam-filled ramekins on the side.Cute and festive.The jam could be smoother if the skins were removed prior to preparation.
