There is nothing sour about these meatballs, they are just meatballs in tomato sauce with sugar. Edible but not very good.

I am on a quest to find another meatball recipe for our annual holiday party. Have always used Meatballs in Red Wine Gravy (delish btw). With that said, this was a good different approach to meatballs. I read the reviews first and substituted apple cider vinegar for lemon juice and added cinnamon as well to balance the tomato sauce. Served over rice. I asked my hubby if I should add it to our "menu" rotation and he said he would eat it again not request it. I liked the interesting taste and my son really liked them (loves rice dishes) May just be our taste. I gave it only 2 forks based on description (it says Good), if there were a half I would give it 2.5. However my search continues on with Red Wine Meatballs in the lead:)

I made these as appetizer-sized and they got rave reviews. I changed a few things. First, with the sauce, I started by sauteing the onions in olive oil, added the garlic then the brown sugar and then the tomatoes. I omitted the lemon juice b/c I thought it wasn't necessary and they were just fine without it. The only other thing I changed was that I omitted the onion in the meat mixture because (the 1st time I made it) it was difficult to form small meatballs with all those pieces of onion in it.

Every time I serve these at a buffet, people get very excited. In Southern California we tend to stay away from red meat, especially when entertaining. People react as if they're seeing an old friend. I'm usually short on time, so I use the frozen meatballs from Costco. They hold up well in the sauce. I heat the meatballs in the oven, then put everything in a crock pot for several hours. I am always asked for this recipe.

Ugh. I think I should have browned the meatballs first, because many of them fell apart in the sauce. Both the meat and the sauce were bland. Way too much work for such ho-hum results.

This is a great recipe for kids and good for adults too. It's kid- friendlier if you put the onions in the sauce but use onion granules in the meatballs themselves. My family also prefers a smoother sauce so we make this with crushed tomatoes instead of spoon-squished whole tomatoes. If you have a sauce-averse kid, you can bake some of the meatballs. About 16 minutes at 375 is what mine took, and The Picky Eater Himself ate an astounding number of baked meatballs with a toothpick. The rest of us lapped up the sauce and meatballs over rice.

WOW! I added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the sauce and they are the best appetizer meatballs I've had. I've added them to my recipe box which is reserved for only the best.

I made these for christmas eve and everyone loved them! I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 c of cider vinegar to the boiling water. I also removed the meatballs once they were done cooking and added some flour to the sauce to thicken it up. It created a really nice glaze. I added the meatballs back in and warmed up before serving. I'll definitely make again.

This was delish! My boyfriend gave it a 9 out of 10 and lots left over for him to take to work and brag to his friends. I will make this again, the cinnamon was a great addition!

Made this for the kids Christmas Eve party, and they loved it. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used juice from a whole lemon. It was a little too tomato-ey without the extra sharpness, and the cinnamon rounds out the flavor nicely.

made this sauce for a holiday open house yesterday. Had lots of prep so I bought the meatballs from a favorite wherehouse and added them after the sauce had simmered down a bit. RAVE REVIEWS all around for the combination - even from my most esteemed guests (my 90 - year -old great cook grandmother, who asked for my recipe!). Doubled the recipe, used canned crushed tomatoes in place of whole, increased the sour by adding apple cider vinegar (about 1/4 cup per recipe) and simmered for most of the day....all the meatballs were gone in record time.

These are very tasty and provide a big portion so this lasts for days. Plus it's a pretty healthy recipe; nothing is fried. I have only had very positive reviews.

I used this recipe in place of an old favorite. My guests raved about this when I made them as an appetizer for a dinner party. I made them a second time for the holidays and again received a thumbs up from all. They're easy to make and I think the key is cooking them in the sauce. It's a keeper

This recipe was a hit. I served it with Asian noodle salad and a green salad, and everything went together surprisingly well. I will make it again.

I cooked this in a slow-cooker instead of the dutch oven and left it on low about all day. I also used 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar in addition to the lemon juice. The end result was YUMMY! I served it with whole wheat egg noodles, and it was enjoyed by all.

Wow! Even I made a success of this one. I might be bold enough to serve this for company. Thanks!

This sauce was too sweet and no sour. Nothing special about it. Canned spaghetti sauce tastes better (or bbq w/ grape jelly). I spent a ridiculous amount of ingredients and time to find the right flavor. Would not make it again. Was not impressed based on the raving reviews. Meatballs nothing special either.

i've made this recipe many times for winter time dinner party guests. Its always gotten rave reviews. I double the recipe as follows. three 35 ounce cans of Nina peeled san marzano tomatoes (tomatoes crushed by hand in the pot). 3/4 of a box of regular light brown sugar. 7 to 8 ounces of progresso plain bread crumbs. 3 regular size eggs. I use about 1/3rd of the alspice the recipe reccomends. bring sauce to a boil and put meatballs in the sauce. reduce heat to lowest possible and let meatballs cook until they are done (several hours). then remove meatballs and turn up heat a bit to reduce sauce (but dont set heat so high that the sauce will burn) to a serving consistency. mix in corn starch at the very end if you want a thicker sauce but use sparingly. it will be more sweet than sour but should be really excellent.

Easy and good. I put the tomatoes in the food processor before cooking so the sauce was smooth; used chicken broth instead of beef; used cider vinegar instead of lemon for a more pronounced sour.

The Sauce was very good, but the meatballs were nothing special. The meatballs tasted like your average meatloaf. They did not absorb the wonderful flavor of the sauce (to which, I added extra brown sugar) and were not particularly soft. They were good enough to serve to the guests for whom I'd prepared them, but only with the disclaimer that I'd tried a new recipe that I wasn't happy with.

I see this as more of a sweet tomato and onion sauce than a sweet & sour sauce. I've made this recipe many times now, and I like it over rice! I made it for my parents too - and my Dad asked me for the recipe!

This recipe is loved by my 19 month old son. He will eat several of the meatballs (he's a picky eater), so we are happy to get him to eat anything. I used diced tomatos (Contadina) that had Italian herbs in them. I also added some pre-made speghetti sauce.

I cook a lot, but this is the first time that I've made meatballs. I found that the tomatoes overwhelmed the sauce and so I added some apple cider vinegar, more brown sugar, salt and some hot sauce (scotch bonnet - the best!). The finishing touch - a few drops of liquid smoke. It's still simmering away on the stove but now tastes great. I plan to serve some tomorrow and freeze the rest.

Really good. For my taste - perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. I like that it can be made in advance and stores well. Now that it's passed muster with me, I'm hoping my toddlers will like it so I'll be making this again soon especially for them.

Have not made these as yet, but when I do I will cook the meatballs in the oven instead of in the sauce. Cooking meatballs in any sauce makes the sauce greasy, no matter how much you try and spoon it off. Yes I know cooking it in the sauce adds some flavor. But I would rather have a grease free sauce rather than just a little more flavor. But thats just my opinion. ;-)

We enjoyed this recipe, a great weeknight dinner. I followed it exactly except left out most of the allspice because I do not care for it. Love recipes that can be made ahead of time, packed up and taken to friends' easily (that tastes great too) and this one definitely fits the bill.

Loved changed a few things though. I blended everything up in the blender. Instead of all spice I added 1/2 tsp of basil and 1/2 tsp of oregano. I placed it in the oven cause I was short on time, at 375. Kids loved it, I would add the sauce to my meat loaf as well. Perfect

I made this recipe as directed except I used grnd turkey instead. The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of onion in the meat mixture by half, as it overhwhelmed the flavor of the meat (maybe it would be okay with beef?). Other than that, pretty tasty!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed these meatballs, I found them really tender and the sauce very tasty. Why not just use crushed tomatoes? The only problem was the cooking time to reduce and thicken the sauce. I ended up thickening the sauce myself with flour because I didn't want to wait all night to eat. This thickened it up quickly and still tasted delicious. Served over basmati rice. Lots of leftovers to look forward to.

I've made these a couple of times now. They remind me the best parts of stuffed cabbage (the sweet Yiddish kind): the meat and the sauce. We've had these meatballs a few different ways--on rolls, over egg noodles, and even as a snack on the highway! They're excellent when made with ground buffalo (which is much lower in fat than beef). I'll try them next with ground turkey. Don't bother mashing whole tomatoes; just use the crushed ones!

Okay, there I was, trying to find a simple appetizer for a Polynesian-themed birthday party, when I stumbled upon this recipe which is now PERMANENTLY EMBEDDED in my recipe book IN INK! Having perused the suggestions made by other reviewers, I ended up simply not measuring any of the ingredients and instead combining for taste (e.g., three tablespoons of lemon juice, chicken broth instead of beef broth, half of a standard-sized box of brown sugar, fewer tomatos, more garlic and onions, more bread crumbs, three eggs, handfull of oats, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and several dashes of sweet and sour sauce) ... Voila! Yum yum tum tum tum. I ate the finished product for dinner that night, for lunch the following day, and for a mid-day snack as I type this review. My mom loved them, but my dad found them a tad too sweet ... to each his own. The topper was my finicky weiner dog, who simply will not eat anything unless he is in the particular mood for it. I chopped up a meatball, poured some sauce on top of it, and let him poke his nose into it -- chomp, chomp, chomp ... all gone and begging for more. Bottom line: If my weiner wolfed it down, I feel confident my party guests will.

I thought these were very tasty - I cooked the meatballs in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes while the sauce was simmering to drain off some of the fat, then added them to the sauce while it cooked down. Adding more lemon juice hightens the sour flavor.

Maybe I am not the right person to judge this recipe since I am pregnant in my 1st trimester and I have a lot of food "dislikes" at the moment, but I really did not like the taste of this at all.

Even though the cooking time was a bit long, the actual hands on preparation time was quick and simple. Used crushed tomatoes and precut garlic. Only the onions needed chopping. Served over whole wheat couscous, which my family does not usually like, however the sauce softened up the couscous and everyone agreed it was good with this dish. This is a keeper we will have often.

These meatballs also reminded me of cabbage rolls (without the cabbage) so I was a little disappointed. My kids and husband enjoyed them which was a real plus! I would add less garlic next time and perhaps a little more brown sugar.

If you like meatballs... good, but quite a bit of time to make (approx. 2 hours). I made half the recipe and got 26 decent size meatballs. I'll add more lemon juice next time to accentuate the sour because it's very sweet. I might omit the allspice, in the meat, and replace with Worcestershire sauce. Lastly, I used ground turkey and chicken broth and served with egg noodles.

We used 4 small cans of tomatoes to equal the amount called for. Next time I would use one less, there was too many tomatoes. We also served this over rice. Next time we would add the rice to the mixture. Otherwise it was good. All my childred (ages 5-14) ate this readily. They all asked for MORE.

This dish reminded us of an old family recipe for sweet-and-sour cabbage rolls, without all the work of stuffing the cabbage. We enjoyed it first hand and as leftovers the next day.
