Do not waste your precious time and expensive ingredients on this disaster. We thought this meal would be a nice challenge for a Valentine's Day evening at home. Though we are quite experienced in the kitchen, there is nothing that can be done to salvage the mess we pulled out of the oven. The proportions are off and we had to adjust everything ourselves. The truffle and chanterelle flavors clash with the flavors of the sherry and seafood stock. I can't imagine why in the world they would be combined. Fortunately this Valentine's Day wasn't entirely ruined: a good sense of humor and a great bottle of wine kept our spirits high.

Nowhere, except in the title, does this recipe mention crab.

This is great, but please,please don't put the truffle on until after baking as all of its flavor will evaporate in the oven.

I was disappointed with the results and used top-quality ingredients. I had expected that the braising liquid would impart some flavor - it did not. However, I used reconstituted mushrooms, as fresh were not available. The gratin was a bit better but be sure and use fresh crab meat and more liquid then called for - it was drier than expected.

This is somewhat complicated and time consuming and requires some specialty ingredients. I was actually searching for something to showcase a fresh black truffle someone gave me AND Chateau Chalon (a specific appellation of vin jaune, but a dry nutty sherry is a good substitite)that we brought from France. It is worth finding the purple potatoes because of the dramatic presentation and by all means,splurge on the chanterelles and use fresh crab - this is truly a special occasion recipe. Not inexpensive to prepare, even if you are given the truffle as I was!
