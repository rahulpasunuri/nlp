This used to be my favorite until I tried the ESSENTIAL CHOPPED TOMATO-SERRANO SALSA (this web page). I have been trying to recreate the salsa that I had on my honeymoon in Mexico and this is just missing something.

Yum! My local grocer didn't have serrano chilies, so I had to substitute fresno chilies and I think it worked great. I'm not that familiar with the taste difference between chilies (other than heat). Does anyone think the salsa would taste differently if I used serrano vs. fresno (or other chilies)? Will definitely make this again.

This was great. I coarsely chopped ingredients and then finished the dish in a food processor. Substituted fresh lime juice for the water, as others recommend--yum, yum, yum!

Instead of the water squeeze about half a lime into your salsa. Very tasty!

A good salsa recipe. I added a little diced cucumber - it's a nice companion to the spicy serrano's, refreshing too. Also omited the water and allowed it to sit a little while before serving to allow the flavor to mature and blend.

Persuaded by the previous rave reviews, we tried this recipe not long ago. I'm delighted to add a very enthusastic thumbs up. (We did omit the water.) A visiting friend reacting with nothing short of astonishment over how good this was.

Wow -- my homemade salsas usually flop. But this one was really good. I can't believe it was that easy.

I will never by bottled salsa again. This recipe is delicious and I am ready to make it again with some experimentation on additional ingrediants. I used a cup of white onions and two large jalepenos.
