Used Trader Joe's frozen mini croissants (first time...fantastic), Boarshead sliced roast beef (deli counter), the terrific mayo and arugula. Served with a capresse salad and a carrot ginger soup as a first course to a group of sophisticated ladies for lunch. Great meal, everyone loved it. Bet the mayo will be wonderful in a chicken salad

I did exactly the same thing as the cook from Cypress, TX, and these absolutely DISAPPEARED at last night's party. I was barely fast enough to grab one myself. terrific make-ahead party food.

I really liked this dressing, I added horseradish, which made it very good!

Making this for the second year as a Thanksgiving appetizer. I use deli roast beef, Hellmann's Light mayo, fresh rosemary. I make individual appetizers by spreading the mayo on cocktail pumpernickel, topping with the roast beef, and garnished with very thinly sliced/chopped red onion. Have yet to meet anyone who doesn't love them.

Fabulous, 100% rating for sure. Didn't even use fresh rosemary, still amazing. And used leftover mayo to make chicken salad - will be staple in fridge now. Can't wait to try it with fresh rosemary!

I will be bringing this to my neighbors' New Year's party, for the third year in a row and at their urgent request. Big hit for little effort!

I took this to an outdoor concert and it worked perfectly. I seared, then roasted a piece of beef tenderloin to rare. I used arugula to give it more flavor. We made small sandwiches and they were devoured.

made this the first time with sliced tenderloin, homemade mayo and artisan bread - it was amazing! the next time i used sliced deli roast beef, regular mayo and supermarket bread and it was still great - will take the easy way out from now on!

For such a simple concoction, this "mayonnaise" is good on EVERYTHING from crab cakes to roast beef! I will constantly have this availible in my fridge!

This was so easy and wonderful! I sliced a pre-cooked roast and served it with pumpernickel bread. Fantastic!

Great cocktail party food. Looked and tasted much fancier than it was. Most of preparation could be done in advance. Guests raved about it.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and tried it with roast pork tenderloin. Some I served on rye cocktail bread with sliced pork, and some of the pork with just the mayo on the side for dipping. Delicious both ways!

I never in a million years would have guessed this could be so good. Not only the easiest thing in the world, but wow! During our recent heatwave, faced with a lot of leftover roast beef, these sandwiches (on sourdough rolls, yum) were absolutely sublime!

This dish was a huge hit at an outdoor party. We served it with small slices of excellent rye bread. Adults and children all enjoyed. This one is a keeper.

I liked this dish, but I'm not a big fan of rosemary. I served it to people that claim to love rosemary...and not suprisingly, they loved it. I'll make it again because it's a great way to spruce up a Fat Free mayo.

This was wonderful! I had about a cup left over, I mixed in 2 cans of tuna, 1 cup chopped celery, 1/2 cup chopped roasted red peppers(canned) and 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish, made an AWESOME tuna salad!!

I was so surprised at how delicious this was. It didn't sound like anything special but I tried it because others gave it 4 forks. It made an ordinary roast beef sandwich into something very special.

Oh my goodness - the mayo is SO extraordinary, I wish I could give it four more forks. Really just absolutely awesome. You could use it on poached salmon, chicken breasts, with vegetables or chips - anything will taste decadent and wonderful with this stuff. Highly recommended.

We first made this for my wine tasting/appetizer bridal shower. Big hit as we served them on little cocktail breads. I've made the mayo several time for myself to use on sandwiches. A very different yet tasty combination.

The rosemary mayonnaise is really special, taking plain old mayo to another level. Recently, however, and quite by chance, I discovered Whole Foods 365 brand mayonnaise, which is also a couple of cuts above the others out there, in my opinion. I looked at the label to see what made it special, and it turns out that the "secret ingredient" is rosemary.

MMMMMMM...really good. I carmelized the onions (used about 3 large onions) and topped the beef with them, followed by the rosemary mayo. Made wonderful little buffet sandwiches.

Served this for New Year's Eve last night. Made tiny yeast rolls and also served a sliced roast pork loin with the rosemary mayonnaise. Six people asked me for the mayonnaise recipe. Having rosemary in our herb garden didn't hurt!

This is soooo goooood. So very, very good. Not only that it's fast and simple to make and to top that off it's a wonderful way to use up left over roast beef roast. A key to this recipe is to slice the beef very, very thin. I doubled the amount of garlic and used fresh rosemary. I will use this recipe often in the future. If your on a no carb diet this is really special.

I served these on Turkey Buns and got rave reviews.

Excellent recipe--it received rave reviews at a dinner party. I used the left overs the next day to make a sandwich.
