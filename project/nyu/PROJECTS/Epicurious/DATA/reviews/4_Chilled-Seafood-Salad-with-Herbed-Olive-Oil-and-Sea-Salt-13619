I made this as an entre and was hesitant to boil the scallops, so I seared them in my cast Iron skillet. I was very happy with the way the herbed olive oil turned out--I had a LOT of chives in the garden, so overdid those a bit. We served the seafood, drizzled with oil, over baby greens. Amazing and pretty!

The herbed oil dressing adds just a bit of flavor but lets the seafood shine through. I had access to very fresh mussels so I added those. I agree that a few avocado slices are a good addition. I also followed another reviewer's suggustion and served the Tuscan Beans - a great combination.

Served for our Christmas Eve dinner two years in a row. I added about 3lbs cooked octopus, and the meat from a 2 lb lobster. I doubled the dressing. It all went very quickly!

Have made this several times without the squid. Put this in martini glasses with mixed baby greens on the bottom. Adding avocado slices is a must. People are impressed with this presentation.

I made this recipe over the summer and discovered it goes *really* nice with the Epicurious' Tuscan Beans. Served it also with crusty Tuscan bread and Pinot Grigio. Thanks Epicurious!

delicious but tricky. drained and chilled the seafood well but still some liquid in the bottom of my martini glass (which is a wonderful way to serve this.) maybe it was the lemon juice one hour before serving? i don't think it need the hour. also blended the sauce which pulverized it so there was nothing much to pour thru a fine sieve. i'm not big on squid so omitted it. nonetheless, this was outstanding and really great when all mixed together. presentation is beautiful. the oil is still in my fridge and i jsut used it to marinate chicken which was yummy.

Very good! Didn't have squid at the time though. This looks so beautiful in large martini glasses or margarita glasses.

Excellent starter for a more formal meal. I've saved this recipe for 6 years since it was first published and finally made it for Christmas Eve dinner. It served 6 people as a salad and everyone wanted more. Very easy and so elegant. Be sure to use a generous sprinkling of sea salt at presentation, it adds a wonderful crunch and flavor.

This has become an annual New Years eve recipe. It is delicious and presents beautifully!! Be sure not to leave out the sea salt. Without it, it wouldn't be the same
