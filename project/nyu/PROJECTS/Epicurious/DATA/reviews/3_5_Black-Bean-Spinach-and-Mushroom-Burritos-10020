Great for weeknights. It was unthinkable not to add spices to a burrito mixture, so I added ground coriander, cumin, chili powder, and mixed in a small portion of the green enchilada sauce. I think whether or not it needs the addition of water just depends on now long you have it simmering on the stovetop while you're getting the tortillas and other things ready. I also added a small pan- fried chicken breast, shredded, for more texture and flavor.

was good, I added corn and instead of water used salsa! Will make again and again!!

This was definitely bland and in need of more spice. Made it exactly as written for spinach and mushroom loving family but they didn't love it and kept adding hot sauce to give it some kick. I should have taken the advice of others and added some additional seasoning. Agree with omitting the water too. I will try it again because it is easy and healthy plus ingredients are easy to keep on hand plus a good meatless option for family with a vegetarian, but will have to experiment with better mix of spices.

Made this tonight and added cumin, coriander, and some spicy chili powder as other reviewers stated. Also omitted the water (it doesn't need it) and left in the spinach stems (who cares? :)). We didn't use enchilada sauce but instead put some green taco sauce and Red Hot sauce in the burritos (RH is zero calories and green taco sauce is 5 per serving). Seriously, these burritos were FREAKING AWESOME. They tasted like they were from a restaurant. Also, we only had two people and we probably had enough for 6 people. Hmmm. Will DEFINITELY be making again.

Loved it. Quick and easy. I followed prior reviewers advice and added hot mexican chili powder, coriander and cumin. Did not add water and used pepper jack. No enchilada sauce, just hot sauce with sides of guac & sour cream. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

I was dubious about this recipe but decided to give it a try since I had nearly all the ingredients required in the house. Absolutely, surprisingly terrific. My two younger boys (3 & 6) both raved about it! I sub'd pinto beans for the black beans, used defrosted spinach, and added 1 tsp. each cumin & chili powder to the filling. We made these into enchiladas by filling the flour tortillas, covering w/ green enchilada sauce & cheese, then baking 'til the cheese on top was melted. We will def make this again.

This was good, but I added more heat including with chili sauce and powder and more garlic. Also I fed four people by using smaller corn tortillas instead of flour.

I am so glad I read reviews before making this recipe. I agree it is a good base recipe. I omitted the 1/4 cup water, and added 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili powder to the onions while cooking them, then added the mushrooms. Overall, very good.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. I don't know if I'll be making it again but it was a decent meal for tonight.

I had to make a lunch dish for work and this really worked out well. When I tasted the filling, I thought it was bland. I threw in some fresh salsa and I let the water evaporate before adding the spinach and the cheese. I also used the 4 cheese Mexican style that Kraft puts out there for us - doubled the cheese as well. I really like this dish. It's easy and it tastes good.

Rating: 3
Like almost every other reviewer, I made some alterations which turned what might have been a bland dish into something really delicious. The filling was left mostly the same: 1.5 cups chestnut mushrooms and 1.5 defrosted spinach, a can of black beans, juice of half a lemon, scallions, garlic and onion all the same. Also added about one minced jalapeno, left out the water, and added about 1/4 cup low fat sour cream while the filling was in the pan. When assembling the enchiladas, I put in the filling and then put some cheese in too (about 2 tbs. each enchilada). Used bottled spicy salsa as my sauce and put a bit more cheese on top of the row of enchiladas, and baked in a 160 degree Centigrade oven for about 20 min (in UK!). Was great, my carnivore boyfriend said it was the best mexican food he'd ever had (although there's not much in the way of "real" mexican food here in London!). Will use fresh spinach next time as the frozen turned a bit watery, think will wilt in separate pan, drain, and then add to mushrooms.

So good! Only things I did differently was add a can of chopped green chilies (adds zest every time!), used whole wheat tortillas, and I DOUBLED the cheese. This gave it a nice creamy texture. Yummy and oh so healthy!

Rating: 3
I too changed the recipe; however, this was a great base to start with. I added taco seasoning and precooked rice to the base, rolled it up in whole wheat shells and layed them ina dish, covered with the sauce and the cheese and baked it in a 350 oven for 30 minuted. It was great and my 18 month old daughter eat it up.

I didn't rate this because by the time I finished with it, it only resembled this actual recipe in passing. This recipe made for the jumping off point though and what I ended up with was yummy. First I doubled the recipe. I found out when I went to add the beans that I didn't have any black beans, so I used red beans instead. Other than that, I left the filling alone except that I added a minced chipotle in adobo, some cumin, and some chili powder. I rolled the filling up in 8 whole wheat flour tortillas, put them in a 9x11 pan, poured the enchilada sauce over the top, sprinkled with cheese and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Very yummy and since the filling was yummy, I'm pretty sure the recipe would work as written for burritoes as well.

Very good - I omitted the water and the consistency was fine.

Rating: 0
I am in agreement with the other vegetarian reviewer on this recipe. I found it to be the worst I've tried from this site. The consistency was poor, and the flavor was bland. If you do decide to make it, certainly don't add any water. There is already far too much moisture from the mushrooms and spinach, so you may in fact want to drain the filling before adding the cheese. At the risk of turning it into a different recipe altogether: double the garlic, add some chili powder and cumin to the filling, and some fat free cream cheese to thicken it up. Roll the filling into the tortillas, stick them in a glass baking dish, cover with sauce and some of the jack cheese, and bake at 350 for about 25 minutes. It's still relatively healthy and a heck of a lot more palatable.

Tasted very good, but it would be bland w/out salsa added. I didn't use enchilada sauce, used 1 bag of baby spinach greens, and 1 15oz can of black beans. Worked just great.

I omit the cheese from the filling in the pot. I then roll the burritos w/ the cheese on top of the filling, roll them, pour sauce on top and bake the little darlings for 30 minutes. Much better consistency.

I'm a vegetarian and this was the WORST recipe I've ever made. I don't understand how this has hit such high marks with the other reviewers. No thanks, I threw this recipe away and deleted it from my file. Never again.

This is a fantastic recipe--simple, healthy, and delicious. I also left out the water and had to keep spilling some of it as it cooked. I used the bagged baby spinach so I didn't have to discard any stems--it wilted in a flash. I threw in a chopped jalapeno with the onion and mushrooms, and used hot enchilada sauce. I served it on the side with an impromtu guacomole--avocado, onion, jalapeno and yellow and red tomato chopped coarsely. I'm really looking forward to making this again.

I love these burritos! The filling was creamy and very tasty. I did not add the water and it was perfect. I also used salsa instead of the enchilada sauce. I will be making these again very soon. They are a perfect quick, tasy, healthy dinner. Yum!

We make this all the time at my house, leaving out the water as others have suggested, and usually using frozen (thawed) chopped spinach, since it is less work. The fresh spinach is best if you have the time, though.

Rating: 3
At the advice of other reviewers, I didn't add the water. I also added only about half of the spinach because I got tired of pulling off stems and a pound sounded like a lot. Next time will probably add the amount of spinach called for. After you get through some of the initital chopping, this is a really fast recipe. Served with canned refried beans for a yummy, easy weeknight dinner.

Very tasty recipe. Don't add the water - the mushrooms, spinach, and onions provide plenty of liquid. We served the burritos with the corn and radish salad (also found here) and it made a very well rounded meal.

I added sour cream before they were wrapped. Skip the water and add the canned sauce only if you make them ahead and plan to re-heat them at a later time.

Have been making this one for years. Like other reviewers siad omit the water, the mushrooms have plenty of moisture. I increase the cheese to about 1 c. I also don't bother with the enchilada sauce any more, why clean more than you have to? Although, it's nice to have these enchilada style as another reviewer suggested, by placing burritos in a baking dish, covering with the sauce and topping with cheese before baking. Oh, yes one more thing, salt and pepper to taste, very important.

I made this dish for my family and they raved about it. Instead of regular mushrooms I used a mix of portabello and cremini which gave the burritos incredible flavour.

Easy, healthy and yummy! What more can you ask for? I added more garlic, substituted squash for the onions and did NOT add water - my one complaint was that the dish was way too watery, and needed to be drained before serving.

This is a great fun lunch. Like many vegetarian dishes like this, you have to drain after washing and sufficiently saute the vegetables to concentrate the flavor and get rid of the excess water.

This recipe is quick, easy, tasty and healthy - a little heavy on the onions though. The next time I make it, I'll leave out the scallions, and 1/2 the amount of onion and garlic (using only 1/4 of an onion and 1 clove garlic), perhaps substituting with zucchini or another vegetable. I also rolled up the burritos w/out heating the tortillas, placed them in a baking dish, poured the sauce over the top (cold), sprinkled with cheese, and baked them in a 300 oven for about 25 minutes until the sauce and cheese bubbled - delicious!

This is a terrific recipe. It has a lot of texture and taste. I'm not a great fan of pre-fab enchilada sauce, so I made something up. We are all fans of cilantro, so I tossed some in. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Bland, wet, mess.

Very tasty. I also omitted the water, and only sprinkled the cheese over ingredients after filling the tortillas, as I didn't want to clean messy melted cheese from the pan. I'll use this as a starting point for future variations, such as using shrimp instead of black beans. Also, my husband and I each made our own version in separate pans so we could omit the ingredients we don't like.

Tasty. Used coarsely chopped portabello mushrooms for a more hefty texture. Added some chili powder, ground coriander, cumin. As others have stated, you don't need that 1/4 cup water.

Doubled the recipe. Added a sweet red pepper which I happened to have on hand. Used two cans beans. Rolled up burritos (made ten large) and put them in 2 large baking dishes. Put hot salsa on top and added lots of extra cheese on top as well. Stuck in 350 oven until cheese was melted. Served with sliced avocado as well as sour cream. Moderate hit.

Living in the suburbs, this is the closest I've come to "real" burritos and they're great! I usually don't even bother with the scallions. I've found that the recipe also servces 4 as opposed to 2. Works well adding easy brown rice, as I guess is obvious.

Rating: 3
This was really a hit with my husband. I used the whole can of beans and chopped the onions and mushrooms coarsely rather than finely as I like the texture better. The recipe made more than enough for four burritos--I can probably get another meal out of this batch for the two of us. Like some of the other reviewers, I would eliminate the water.

My husband usually wants meat for dinner but he loved this dish. I used extra pepper jack and a medium spicy encilada sauce. Next time I'll use half non-spicy cheese because it was just a little too spicy (and I do like things spicy).

I just made this dish for the first time last night, and it was great! I eliminated the water, bought a bag of pre-washed raw spinach to save on time, added a can of white corn, an extra clove of garlic, a diced jalepeno pepper and some cumin. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour, and made enchiladas instead of burritos, as recommended by another reviewer. Topped with sour cream and cilantro. It's a keeper!

I made this dish after reading the reviews and was quite impressed, although it did take a bit longer than 45 minutes. Since I like things spicy I threw in a chopped up jalepeno pepper and would recommend it. Also, I had no enchalada sauce so I threw in some fresh salsa instead which was great. I would agree that the water was unnecessary. The extra bonus was that I made a double batch to take for lunch and let's just say that the coworkers were jealouus; it reheated beautifully in the office microwave.

I use this recipe a lot, but I add enchillada sauce to the mixture of beans, spinach etc. Instead of rolling individual burritos I layer the tortillas and filling in a sort of lasagna then pour the remaing sauce on the top. I like the blend of flavors and use low fat shreded cheese. Yummy!

I thought it was delicious. Made it according to the recipe. Contrary to other reviews, for us it made just enough for 2 portions of 2 midsized burritos each.

I thought that this recipe was really good. I added a little bit more lemon juice and garlic. I also made a chili sauce to drizzle on top and that was fabulous.
