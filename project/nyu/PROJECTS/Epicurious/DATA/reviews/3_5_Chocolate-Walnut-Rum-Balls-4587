These are so easy and so good. This year, I used a mix of Ginger Snaps and Vanilla wafers and Rum and it was great. Next year I might go with all Ginger Snaps. I rolled them in Turbinado sugar.

Have made this recipe and other rum or bourbon ball recipes over the years and this one is a favorite as is, ingredients-wise. One of the best things I learned from other recipes though, is to let the dough sit for about 10 minutes before shaping the balls - this lets the stickiness subside as the cookie crumbs fully absorb the moist ingredients. Then they go together without sticking so much to your fingers. Next, put the balls directly into an airtight container and store a few days to both mellow out the alcohol but also preserve the effect (won't allow too much of the alcohol to evaporate) I've never refrigerated rum balls, but might if I was hoping to store them for more than a week. In a pinch I have served these the same day as making them and the rum is a bit sharp. A variation that's fun is to roll some of the balls in finely shredded coconut, some in a cocoa-powdered sugar mix, and some in the plain sugar. Makes for a pretty presentation to have the variety.

I've been making these every Christmas for years. I've substituted Jack Daniels, Bourbon or Brandy for the rum. I've subbed Trader Joe's vanilla or choc cat cookies for the wafer cookies. They tasted great regardless of which combination used. You almost can't mess this up!

Made exactly as written. Mailed in a tin with waxed paper--five days in the mail and my sister and husband RAVED. They are foodies. Will not change a thing.

So simple and sooo delish. Used chocolate wafer cookies (9oz) because the store didn't have vanilla (nilla wafers)and dumped them into the food processor with a cup of pecans and pulsed until fine. used 1/4 cup light and 1/4 cup spiced rum and they weren't overly rum-y. Used only a Tbs of dark corn syrup because we didn't have light corn syrup. Point being, you can't mess this recipe up. It's wonderful, took only 20 minutes to make, and taste like they took days.

I wanted to make rum balls for Christmas. When I found this recipe I was overwhelmed by the advice, so have to add my own -- compiled from other reviews and lack of ingredients. The result was WONDERFUL! Couldn't find chocolate cookies of any kind, so made a recipe of brownies and cooked them in a jelly roll pan. Increased chips to 1-1/4 cups using 60% cocoa Ghiradelli. Changed sugar to 1/3 c. lgt brown. Used pecans processed in food processor; added about 3-4 cups of broken brownies, then the chocolate mixture. Pulsed till smooth. After refrigerating, shaped the balls and rolled in toasted (till crisp), chopped coconut. The crunch of the coconut added a nice contrast to the creamy rum balls. The rum flavor lasted for weeks. Everybody that tried them loved them. Won't change a thing next year.

After reading all the great comments and adjustments, I melted 1-1/4 c. 60% cocoa Ghiradelli choc chips, added 1/3 c. lgt brown sugar & 3 tbs. lgt corn syrup. Ground pecans in food processor. Since I couldn't find any chocolate cookies, I made a small pan of chewy brownies from my Betty Crocker cookbook, and spread the batter on parchment paper in a jelly roll pan. When done, I put about 3/4 of the recipe in the food processor, processed; then added the remaining ingredients and pulsed a few times. After refrigerating, I rolled them in toasted, chopped, coconut. Was wonderful! Balls were smooth and chocolatey -- coconut added a little crunchy contrast. Great flavor. Rum flavor lasted for weeks. Definitely will make again.

These are a great treat. I agree that the rum is a little too overpowering. I will make it again with less rum next time for the friends that don't enjoy alcohol that much. If you like rum don't change the recipe.

I made these today and instead of the rum I used a sugar free carmel syrup. They turned out okay. I think I will have to adjust the amount of syrup. But will make them again.

Rating: 3
These were of course super tasty, but, catering to a crowd of alcohol-loving folks, I made some changes that worked out well: no chocolate, only rolled in cocoa powder and conf. sugar afterwards. Slightly toasted the walnuts before chopping in food processor. Most importantly, tripled the amount of dark rum and left out the corn syrup altogether! I'm not a big fan of corn syrup anyway. They held together just fine and were super flavorful from the rum and plenty sweet. A fabulous treat for adults!

Rating: 4
Really yummy and fast to make! The rum kick is quite strong and not for the faint of heart, but they sure do get lots of compliments. Although the instructions say to refrigerate overnight, I made and served these the same day and they were fine. The leftovers were a little more mellow the next day. I followed other reviewers' advice and used powdered sugar instead of granulated. I also used the whole box of Nilla wafers which allowed me to roll them easily without refrigerating first (I was pressed for time.) Also, I substituted ground pecans for the chopped walnuts. Taste and texture were best at room temp, not chilled. I will definitely make this one again!

Rating: 3
really good. i only gave it 3 forks because i think it still needs some tinkering. i used the advice of a previous person but still think it could have some more changes. I haven't put my finger on it yet.. maybe more chocolate?... the texture is great. they smell more like rum than they taste (unfortunately) but they would probably reek if you increased it. And I tried rolling them in raw turbinado sugar and others in coconut. Both really good. I think they could be made less sweet too. These are definately the kind of things that i will make again and again. yummy.

This went over very well at an office party (where food with alcohol is always welcomed) and I had alot of request for the recipe. They were super easy to make and took no time at all. Next time I'll try the coconut rum and roll them in sweetened coconut.

I don't usually give four stars but these deserve it. I used crushed oreo wafers for the vanilla ones and omitted the sugar entirely (the chocolate and the wafers were sweet enough). Instead of rolling in sugar, I rolled them in shredded coconut. The results were mindblowing!

Made one batch as the recipe reads and one substituting chocolate wafers for the vanilla, pecans for the walnuts and framboise (raspberry liquor) for the rum. Consistency was a little more sticky but they chilled just fine. Very very chocolatey so the chocolate lovers ate them all in a hurry. One box of Nabisco chocolate wafers was exactly the right amount once finely ground.

I thought the recipe for Bourbon or Rum Balls in the Joy of Cooking was much better than these. Also, I found them too mellow the next day.

Only okay to my taste though admittedly with Kahlua not rum. DID love the powdered sugar/chocolate chip (powdered in food processor) suggestion though and will use that again and again.

Rating: 3
i've made this several times for some catering clients to their great enjoyment, but have made some changes that have elicited even better reviews. i've decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup, increased the chocolate chips to 1 1/4 cup, increased the corn syrup to 5T, and i make sure to melt the sugar thorougly. i grind the walnuts ina coffee/spice grinder to make them really smooth, and i coat them with powdered sugar whizzed up in a grinder with some more chocolate chips for a really melt in your mouth coating that ends up looking somewhat marbled and very lovely.

This is my grandmother's recipe for "Whiskey Balls".

made these, like them they are very strong indeed. I rolled some in bakers fine sugar, as suggested, others in powdered sugar and still others in some hazelnut cocoa. I Like the powdered sugar and cocoa one much better than those rolled in fine sugar. These taste best cold right out of the fridge. To me they lose something when they warm up, they become doughy.

I melted the chips and other ingredients in a glass cup in the microwave. We rolled the balls in chocolate sprinkles, and I used Kahlua instead of rum. Yummy and so, so fast and simple! Made these for a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I used a 10 oz sleeve of cookies whirled in the food processor to fine crumbs and let my mixture sit for about 15 minutes in the fridge per the other reviewers' comment, it got really firm and was easy to roll. Could not be eaiser or more delicious, this one is definitely going in the recipe box.

These cookies are very good. My only suggestion is to make sure you don't use a large grain sugar. The chocolate doesn't melt it well enough and they're too gritty. Other than that, a wonderful and easy recipe.

These cookies are one of my family's Christmas favorites. To form them, I spray a small meat baller with vegetable spray and the soft dough is no problem. I think the sugar sticks better to the room temp dough than to chilled dough.

Very good as written. Also nice with bourbon instead of rum. Refrigerating before forming into balls IS helpful. I mixed cinnamon sugar with a few left-over white and dark chocolate chips, whirled it all around in the food processor until it was dust, and used that to roll the balls in. Very nice.

I tried the suggestion of the cook from Canada and used the marble cake crumbs(used about a 1/4 cake from a box), omitting the nuts. I didn't however, dip them in chocolate (too much work), but rather used the sugar. Mixed reviews from my friends, I think next time I might roll them in chocolate sprinkles instead. Very easy, quick, good results.

Following the advice of a cook from Toronto (we Canucks stick together) I replaced the vanilla wafers with marble cake crumbs. Fearing that the walnuts might dilute the chocolate flavour I omitted them and instead of rolling the balls in sugar I dipped them in melted bittersweet chocolate with a little milk chocolate mixed in. The rest of the recipe was left intact. The result was the end of my search of many years for a recipe that duplicates the rumballs made by a European bakery in Toronto and trucked (no longer) 200 miles north to our local supermarket. They were (are) rich, boozy, chocolatey and creamy smooth and simply don't get any better than this.

I made these for Christmas -- they were a welcomed alternative to cookies! I substituted whole raisins for the chopped walnuts and the result was delicious. They also made great gifts - each placed individually in mini muffin papers and arranged in small boxes available at craft stores. Helpful hint: using a small cookie scooper to shape the rum balls keeps the "messiness" to a minimum.

I made these for a staff party and everyone LOVED them. I substituted bourbon for the rum. I mixed all the ingredients together according to the recipe when I realized that I hadn't crushed the wafers fine enough, so I put the whole thing into the Cuisinart and proccesed a few seconds, and the result was perfect and VERY easy to roll into balls.

Cookies came out great! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used confectioners sugar in place of granulated, and I used a 12 oz box of wafer cookies simply because that's what I bought, and it seemed to be the perfect amount after processing. A tip: after mixing the batter, let it rest for 5-10 min. It is initially very sticky, but as the cookies absorb the liquid, and the chocolate cools, it becomes very easy to handle. Additionally, while it still looked sticky, the fats in the cookies and chocolate made it roll like playdough in your hands without sticking. Great flavor and EASY!!

Rating: 3
Very easy and straight forward. I found that the "about 10 oz" of 'nilla wafers did not produce 2.5 cups of finely crushed wafers ("crushed" in a food processor). While one box was 12 oz., I had to break open a second box. When I used the 2.5 cups of finely crushed wafers the dough was not sticky but slightly dry and very easy to handle.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe pretty closely. I let the chocolate just melt and added the sugar, corn syrup and rum to it right away. I put the vanilla wafers and walnuts (separately) into my food processor to get finely chopped ingredients and then put them in a medium bowl. I added the chocolate mixture to them and let it set a minute or two to blend. Rolling them into a ball was tricky. I used latex gloves finally to keep the sticky-ness to a minimum. Allowing the ingredients to sit for a couple of minutes helps reduce the mushy-ness.

I really liked these rum balls. I rolled half in powdered sugar mixed with cocoa and half in chocolate sprinkles, I couldn't believe the difference in taste.

One of the best of the liquor-and-chocolate cookies I've made over the years. I upped the crushed vanilla wafers by about half a cup to make the cookies easier to shape and handle.
