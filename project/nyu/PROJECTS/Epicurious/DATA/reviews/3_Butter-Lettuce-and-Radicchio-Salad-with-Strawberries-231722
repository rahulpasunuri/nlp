Much as I love controversy, I'm only here to recommend this salad for its lovely appearance and flavor. Even my boyfriend's family - not so adventuresome when it comes to food - threw caution to the winds and ate it all up! I may try the mango instead of strawberries next time. Or both! BTW, mango and fresh mozzarella lovers should look up the Mango Caprese salad (I think that's the name). Another yummy blend of sweet fruit and greenery.

We use mango instead of strawberries, and a bit less sugar. This is a great light meal, especially when served with a fresh bread (we like our local bakery's seeded baguette).

This recipe is a great idea (love strawberries in salads) but the dressing just isn't very exciting. There are so many other salad recipes out there that are much better. Still, if you're looking for an average, non-offensive salad, this one is just fine.

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I'm making it again for a neighborhood pot-luck.

Dressing is not flavorful and does not counteract bitterness of radicchio. Would definitely not make again.

This is my 3rd time making this salad. I love it - especially the dressing. I use it on all kinds of salad, but I think it comes out prettiest when using the greens in the recipe

I made this salad two weekends in a row for dinner parties and everyone loved it. The first time, I followed the recipe except used Splenda in place of sugar. The second time, I used red cider vinegar in place of the tarragon vinegar, tarragon mustard in place of the dijon mustard and mixed greens and it came out a bit better. I have already shared the recipe with my friends and my husband wants me to make it again this weekend!

the dressing seemed a bit "heavy" for this salad. it was OK.

I loved it, my partner thought it was too acidic. Followed recipe exactly. Maybe will make again, but will go easy on the mustard/vinegar. Also added fresh tarragon

This was a very easy to make and easy to aerve salad. It was perfect for a family luncheon, which included a number of people who could not eat spicy or overwhelming foods.

I add a little bit of taragon to this recipe as well as roasted walnuts and a generous sprinkle of shredded Monteray Jack cheese. Also, if I can't find good strawberries, I use thinkly sliced pears.

Red onion and strawberries go nicely together with the vinaigrette. And the colors are pretty. This recipe has inspired me to add fruit and veggies in other combinations to salads.

Please review and edit this recipie. We apparently have 12 cups of lettuces making a 2 cup salad.

If you know how to cook, amounts are not the most important, but good manners are! If the amounts are not correct, there is no need to be so rude, just ask politely for a revision of the quantities! I definitely will use this recipe.

OK, I can't help but add my two cents, how could a head of radicchio and a head of butter lettuce equal 12 cups of lettuce? They're just not that big. Enjoy!

Makes lots of dressing. Nice change for a salad. Added some pistachios for crunch.

Absolutely delicious, goes with everything. I can make a meal just off of this salad.

This recipe makes less than 13 Tbsp. of dressing, which is less than one cup. (1/2 cup is 8 Tbsp, 3 tsp. is 1Tbsp.). The 2 cups cannot refer to the amount of dressing it makes.

No, it doesn't make 2 cups of dressing. It is clear from the ingredients that it makes around 3/4 cup of dressing, and 12 cups salad.

I don't see how 1/2C. + 4 Tblsp. + 2.25 tsp. can equal 2 cups of dressing. I think the cook from Boise is right - they meant 12 cups of salad.

By doing a little math, I'm suspecting the 1 off the 12 cups to read 2 cups by accident.

To the cook with the question: This recipe is for the dressing, not the salad. It makes 2 cups of dressing.

I just have a question. Can anyone tell me why this recipe would make only 2 cups of salad when it calls for 6 cups each of butter lettuce and radicchio? Am I missing something?

I haven't made this yet, but I do make something similar to this. Add some bleu cheese (or gorgonzola), and some walnut or pecan meats (candied, if you want).....yummy...
