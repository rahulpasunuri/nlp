I substituted finely minced shallots for raw garlic. Can't deal with the raw garlic. It was really good! Make a couple hours ahead for sure.

I love this recipe! It's easy to make and delicious. It tastes great the first night, better the second and just as good if you decide to saute the salad on day three. The texture and flavors make this a great side dish to pork, chicken or steak.

I thought this was very light and refreshing. A great veggie dish when the rest of the meal is heavy. I will definatly make it again

This was sort of strange. I ate it but my family thought it was nasty. It was no better the second day. Perhaps slicing the cabbage and fennel very thinly and marinating longer than two hours would have made a difference, but it just tasted like raw cabbage and fennel with capers. Oh well.

It was good the first night, but amazing the next day. The cabbage and fennel hold up to overnight marinating, it doesn't get soggy, and the flavors mingle, espcially the garlic. A great alternative to mayo-based coleslaw - and yummy capers to boot!
