The classic salt, pepper, cream, and nutmeg magic are always a fine treatment for vegetables, particularly ones that may not be tops on your list (such as celery and jerusalem artichokes). I happened to have both sitting around needing attention so this fit the bill perfectly and we all slurped it up gladly.

I really enjoyed this soup. I served it for a brunch and the others like the taste. One person was not fond of the texture. I did add croutons as a garnish.

This soup had a very strong celery/artichoke taste. It is not my favorite although I love the taste of jerusalem artichokes.
