I've made this soup numerous times, always with variations depending on what is handy. I recommend adding a little cream or cheese to give it more body and adding your favorite spice. It is excellent with an herbed pistou drizzle.

As per a previous reviewer, I too used additional spices: garlic, ginger, seasoning salt, sea salt, freshly ground pepper, cumin. In place of the butter, I used olive oil. My husband, who normally does not care for different foods from his norm, expressed extreme delight..."excellent". It's a keeper.

This soup is YUM! but we added a lot of the ingredients that the other reviewers suggested: - Red Bell Pepper, instead of Yellow - Double the Garlic - Cumin, lime juice & red pepper flakes when cooking the Veggies - Add Grated Parmesan Cheese after blending - Season with Paprika, instead of Coriander Hope you enjoy as much as we did : )

This dish is healthy, adaptable and never fails to please.

Very bland. Roasted the pepper as one reviewer suggested (didn't seem to do much). Added s&p and Parm after tasting it - Parmesan cheese helped, but it was still disappointing.

Very good and healthy. I doubled the recipe, used a red bell pepper, and added a little crushed red pepper for some kick. I thought it lacked the same "depth" that other reviewers talked about, so I added some half and half and parmesan, but it still needed a little something. I think next time I'll try adding some toasted caraway/cumin seeds ala another soup recipe I love, and see how that works. Overall, though, a good simple recipe.

This was really awesome, I love a good healthy recipe and being overrun with squash from the garden, I loved having a simple way to use a lot of it. My only complaint is that it tasted a little "flat" to me initially, so I remade it with roasted red peppers and just a bit of cream and salt and pepper . I also finished it with grated parmesan and that made a world of difference. It went from good to spectacular...maybe a little less healthy, but I went light on the cream and cheese, just used enough to add a bit of richness. Overall a good recipe, we will be having it again.

I meant to state that I quadrupled the recipe when I made it.

This is great BASIC recipe. I highly recommend you make it but plan to adjust the seasonings to your liking. I used a lot more garlic and a variety of peppers (red & green bell, sichuan, mild jalapeno). I added about 2 teaspoons of ground cumin to the vegetables while simmering and also the juice from two limes. Very good outcome. Great review from my husband.

This was just great. I too used red bell peppers instead of yellow, and left the soup in the blender for just a few seconds. It was colorful with yellow and red chunks. I used about a Tb crushed green pepper during the saute, a few crushed cloves of garlic, and I added some Pesney's Tuscan seasonings. Everyone liked it - not bland at all. And soooo healthy.

I agree with other reviewers who found this lacked taste-I used a red pepper instead of yellow which didn't seem to add enough and then took other suggestions of balsamic vineager and honey-still not worth making it again...

Made it with cumin rather than coriander. The texture was a little thick, but otherwise tasty.

Nice and simple flavors. I added a 1/2 jalapeno pepper and paprika sprinkled on top for a bit more kick.

The flavor does need some punching up. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some honey to bring out the flavors of the pepper and squash. Garnished with a round of goat cheese, which proved to be a great compliment. I wish I had doubled this recipe!

This is a great way to use squash! I used red pepper instead of yellow and didn't have corriander butI threw some fresh chives and rosemarry into the food processor with it. This is fantastic and I will make it again soon!

This has become a family favorite. I only use roasted red pepper, I scoop out the seeds from the squash and slow cook the squash and onion uncovered for about an hour until very soft. I also add a little less than 1/4 cup of heavy cream after I puree. Make extra batches as this goes fast. This is really a very beautiful and delicious soup.

Yum! Delicious and easy. I doubled the recipe. Used both red and yellow peppers, and grilled them first. Also added one chopped chipotle pepper, which added a great smoky kick.

Very easy and delicious, we finished every last drop. We garnished with sour cream but it would work with any number of things. Definitely going to make again.

Very bland. Had to add an assortment of spices to get some flavor. Very disappointing.

Super simple. Sauteed shallots in butter, added squash, cooked for 10 minutes. Added broth and simmered. Blended, moved back to pot and added a bit of heavy cream. Added chopped piquillo pimiento peppers from a jar for a smoky finish. Sublime.

This was easy to make and delicious - a great way to use up an abundance of summer squash from the garden! Like other posters I doubled the recipe. I was generous with the amount of onion and garlic I used and loved the end result. Cut back on the butter and served with a dollop of sour cream. Loved it! Great, light summer meal.

This was easy and very tasty, but I agree with some other reviewers that it needs a bit of a kick. I garnished with sour cream and diced tomato in addition to the cilantro, but next time I'd add more garlic, maybe, or some chipotle pepper. Or both.

Great soup. I added an extra yellow pepper and roasted them both in the oven before adding to the mix. It gave the soup a nice, rich, earthy flavor.

I followed what the last 2 people reviewed. It was great. Always make more....I used gound chipolt pepper for some sip.

Tasty and easy, not as much work as the 45 min. implies. We substituted a red bell pepper for the yellow and sauteed a small red serano pepper with the squash. A little spicy and very pretty!

We host a monthly soup night so I am always looking for good soups. This month I found myself with a ton of yellow squash in my garden so I decided to give this a try. The only changes I made were that I doubled the recipe and used half the butter. There was not a drop left at the end of the evening. This one will definately be used again next summer.

Substituted shallots for onion and garnished with sour cream and chives instead of cilantro which made for an attractive presentation. Also sprinkled some paprika on the sour cream and in soup. Next time, most likely will reduce butter. Perhaps olive oil will work to sautee vegetables.

I had to write a review for this soup because it was relatively quick and it was truly delicious! I used a huge yellow squash from a friend's garden, three yellow bell peppers, one large onion, about 6 cloves garlic, one can vegetable broth and then topped with the cilantro. I highly recommend!

I stumbled across this recipe in my quest to use up the yellow squash that is abundant in my garden. It's very tasty! The recipe doubled easily. I added a fair amount of salt and pepper for flavor. Puree it well for a good texture. I think this would also be pretty and tasty with petite diced tomatoes as a garnish with the cilantro, and picky eaters might like a dash of cheese and paprika over the top. My husband adds that this would make a nice side dish for a main meal rather than a whole meal in itself.

This soup is so pretty, quick and delicious. We make it about once a week in our household, as soon as yellow squash are available. It is equally great with charred roasted red peppers which add a bit different twist!

This soup is great hot or chilled. It is also a beautiful color. It's an elegant soup dish.

Good soup, however, a bit bland for my taste. Add a dash of celery salt and sauteed the squash in olive oil. Overall, I'd make again.

Yum! I stirred the coriander into the soup, and the whole thing was wonderfully fragrant. This is an easy-to-make, good-for-you soup that looks beautiful. What a great way to disguise all of that squash from the garden!

I had a bag of mixed squash that I had purchased from our local farmer's market that included zucchini, yellow squash, summer squash, etc. I just chopped them all up and used them all together. My husband loved it and raved about it to all our friends. It was delicious, if I do say so myself!

my husband and i really like this soup - a delicious summer soup - i had to use a red bell pepper instead of the yellow one so i believe that the soup had a little bit more punch - we tried it a room temp, chilled and very warm and perferred the warm...will make and serve again...

Simple and delicious. Add a teaspon of lemon juice to balance the coriander. I fell in love with a zucchini coriander soup (from this site) but this is the real thing.

A delicious, easy to make summer recipe. I served it barely warm with a spoonfull of yogurt and everybody loved it. I also tried to puree it less and keep a coarser texture, and it worked very well.
