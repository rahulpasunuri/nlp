I want to know where to get the mold which was used in the magazine article.

Not all that wonderful. I would have expected better from Epicurious. I'm still looking for that PERFECT cranbery mold - pretty to look at, kid friendly, and not too tart or sweet! Any help or suggestions out there???

Not only delicious but beautiful, as well. It looks like a big, clear, wiggly ruby! The celery gives a nice crunch to the usual mushiness of cranberry sauce. And I love the hair dryer suggestion...the hot towel becomes cold in seconds and takes too long. This recipe has a permanent place on our Thanksgiving menu.

Wow, this was tart. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved this dish and wanted to take home the leftovers. I just had to be careful not to give it all away, and keep some for myself.

I made this last Thanksgiving & it was fabulous.

I am a South African who worked in the Caribbean as a chef and was horrified when I saw that most Americans just open a can of cranberry sauce, so I made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was a HIT! I am back in SA now and making it for Christmas, Congrats on a wonderful recipe. Tereza

This was tasty and attractive, but I'm not sure I would make it again. The reason I might not is that I generally make a dish like this only at holiday time, and I'm not sure this would be my definitive cranberry side dish. There are others I might prefer, and I probably won't make two. However, we did enjoy it.

I substituted 1/4 cup of chopped crystallized ginger for the celery. I served this with a sauce of 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup plain yougurt,a couple T. of brown sugar and 1 T of the crystallized ginger. May add more brown sugar to taste. I never have much luck with hot wet towels and metal molds so I used a hair dryer to warm the mold.

Will make it again next year for Thanksgiving. Had a nice tangy taste. Looked great on the table.

It's a great compromise! Everyone loved it last Thanksgiving and now it's a tradition. It's also very simple to make. I recommend using real 100% cranberry juice, not the cocktail. Also, we had a small group last year so I cut the recipe in half and chilled it in a simple plastic bowl. It didn't look as beautiful as a mold, but it tasted great.

I made this last Thanksgiving and finally solved the jelly vs. chunky dilemma. Everyone loved it. This year we'll finally only have one cranberry sauce on the table.
