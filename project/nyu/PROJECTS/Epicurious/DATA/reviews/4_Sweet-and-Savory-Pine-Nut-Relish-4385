This was the HIT at last year's Thanksgiving dinner at my home. This year, my sister-in-law is hosting and she begged me to bring the relish! She said if I make the relish---it's the ONLY thing I have to bring! It is absolutely delicious and such a nice change!!

Awesome and definitely spunky! Not having an overnight to meld flavors didn't seem to impair the flavor at all. Well worth the chopping time. I substituted parsley I/O cilantro due to family preferences.
