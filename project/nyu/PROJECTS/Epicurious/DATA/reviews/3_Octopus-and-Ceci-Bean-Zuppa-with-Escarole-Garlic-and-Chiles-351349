As a huge fan of both hearty soups and Nate Appleman (formerly of A16), this recipe was an almost guaranteed hit. Braising the octopus in it's own liquid is the only way to go. Tender and flavorful. NOT the rubbery, flavorless stuff you find at the local "seafood" restaurant. Trust me, if you like briny, rich, delicious soups this is one you won't want to miss. The escarole and chiles are a must. (Hunt down calabrian chiles at your local gourmet import store or fine Italian delicatessen. You'll be adding them to EVERYTHING)
