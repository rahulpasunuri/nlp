I made this recipe to use up canned salmon I had sitting around, so my expectations for it were not too high. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I followed the recipe exactly and would again. My only changes would be to cook the onion and pulse the corn in a food processor (so that the cakes hold together better).

This was so tasty! Used left over salmon and made half a recipe of this. Made it with half cracker crumbs and half panko, half nonfat yogurt for half of mayo, and diced red pepper instead of corn. I sauteed my onion, don't like it to underdone in a recipe and I didn't think it would cook sufficiently the way the recipe is written. These were just delicious, worthy of making again. The yogurt sauce was very good, too.

Canned salmon...Parade Magazine...never imagined that this combination would result in one of my favorite recipes. I used to make salmon cakes with fresh salmon and a more complicated recipe, but these are better. Only change I make is to use panko breadcrumbs in place of the saltines.

This recipe was sooo delicious. I made it with canned salmon and won't do that again because I spent more time picking the bones and skin off of the fish than all the rest of the time it took to prepare. I substituted a little cayenne pepper for the Tabasco sauce and didn't even make the yogurt sauce. Next time I see salmon on sale I will buy extra just to have leftovers for this.

I have been making this recipe for years. These are the only salmon cakes my mom likes and the only one I've tried, so I'm content in this being my go to recipe every time I make them. Tender, flavorful, not complicated with exclusive ingredients... We just love them!

These are great! Used green onion and green pepper instead of corn and celery. Was careful when mixing in the mayo mixture that the salmon wasn't getting too mushy. Used half saltines/half panko. Thanks to the user that recommended a Chipotle Lime Mayo to go with the cakes. The spicy mayo was perfect with them and added just the right amount of kick. I just mixed mayo with a minced canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, added some lime zest and lime juice and salt and pepper. We really liked these salmon cakes!! Would make a great appetizer in addition to a meal.

Wow. Was hankering for an old recipe for salmon cakes like my mom made when we were growing up. These aint yo momma's cakes! I did use 1/2 panko to saltine ratio. Now, thanks to a Sr moment, I made the mayo sauce and totally forgot to put it in the salmon mixture! But, I did put the salmon mix in the frig for a while before forming the patties and they held together beautifully as the panko had absorbed the egg. The mayo mix was awesome as a sauce on top! Didnt even bother with the yogurt sauce. Delicious!!! Will make these again.

This was fantastic! I debated whether to use fresh salmon or not, and decided to try salmon from a pouch rather than a can. I wanted to save time on the day of the dinner so I made everything the night before and just kept them in the fridge. I also baked in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through. They browned nicely and were much healthier than frying, I'm sure. Served with a dijonnaise rather than the yogurt sauce due to dairy allergy. I will definitely make them again, perfect for my Shabbat fish course!

Good recipe. I made the mayo mixture exactly as written, and it is delicious. I used leftover baked salmon and a can of tuna. I substituted a half cup of celery for the corn, used a full cup of panko in the mixture, and didn't coat the cakes (to reduce the carbs). They stuck together well and tasted good.

Delicious recipe, but I was a little skeptical about the yogurt lemon sauce, so I also made tartar sauce (an awesome recipe from this site aptly named "Tartar Sauce".) In the end, I found the yogurt sauce to be a great complement to the salmon, as well, so I alternated between both.

Absolutely terrific recipe! The first time I made these, my husband made a face when I told him what was for dinner. After one bite, he did a double- take and after his third cake declared them to be one of his favorite meals. The only recipe modifications I made were 1) using frozen salmon filets, baked for 10 minutes, cooled and flaked, and 2) Panko breadcrumbs instead of saltines. I used 1.5 C breadcrumbs, plus extra for dredging. After resting the formed cakes in the refigerator for an hour, I gave them a light fry about an hour before serving them. To reheat, I placed them on a sprayed cookie sheet and heated them at 400 for about five or six minutes. The Panko breadcrumbs made them sooo crispy, and the inside of the cake remained moist. Made the Light Lemon Yogurt sauce and added a tbsp of lemon zest, doubled the lemon juice, added 1 finely minced garlic clove and added a tsp of black pepper. I make a double recipe each time, and freeze the extra cakes without cooking - they can go directly from freezer to fry pan. Leftovers are excellent reheated, or over field greens with the yogurt sauce as dressing. Absolutely delicious and a real winner!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and did not like the texture as we found the cakes too mushy. This time I added all 1.5 cups of cracker crumbs to the salmon mixture. I did not coat the salmon cakes in crumbs and there was no need to refrigerate for one hour. Made this way, the salmon cakes were very easy and delicious. The texture was perfect.

This inexpensive fish cake recipe is really exceptional. I used fresh salmon (from Ralph's, though Whole Foods is always better)and baked it for about 8 minutes before following the cooking directions exactly. Per the recipe, refridgerating the cakes is also a really great idea. I did substitute green onion for celery, added carrot, used Soy instead of Worsheister and panko instead of cracker crumbs. Use whatever is in your fridge for the dry(ish) ingrediants, but follow the spiced mayonnaise recipe if you can- delicious. My boyfriend says this salmon cake recipe should replace "Cheese Burger Night", which is a BFD around here.

Made these tonight for dinner. Halved the amount of mayo, and substituted some chopped pickles for the relish because I didn't have it on hand. Left out the lemon for the same reason. Added some Old Bay seasoning. Used Italian breadcrumbs and fried in canola oil. The cakes still fell apart after an hour in the fridge - I think I'd rather chill them for 3+ hours. Very, very tasty!

I was surprised by how good these are! An added bonus is that they are easy to put together and can be made early in the day, leaving only the quick saute to be done at dinner time.

These fish cakes have become a trusted stand- by for me; I have made them many times. Whenever I make salmon it seems I end up with leftovers and this is the perfect recipe to make use of those leftovers. I've also made them with arctic char and rainbow trout, with equally good results. Normally I use panko, at least for the outer coating, so they get extra crispy, but I've also used cracker crumbs as well as bread crumbs. Always great! I often end up freezing half the batch (I'm only cooking for two, and two to three fish cakes for each of us is plenty. The recipe usually yields ten cakes for me). Sometimes I thaw the frozen cakes before I cook them...sometimes I don't. They're aren't quite as good as the fresh made patties but are still excellent and so easy, it makes up for the slight loss in quality.

Superb! I used leftover, slow roasted salmon instead of canned. (I could also see using poached salmon as an alternative too.) I chose to bake the cakes at 400 for about 20 minutes (on parchment). The cakes were surprisingly crispy and would happily do this again as a more healthful alternative to frying. But the real treat was eating the remaining cakes (cold) the next day - the flavours were perfectly developed. Next time I might prepare the cakes the day before, then serve cold or room temp on a bed of greens (or perhaps a Asian-style slaw)... yum, yum!

I haven't made the actual cakes yet (so I can't give a ranking), but have spent at least an hour removing tiny bones and skin bits and cartilage from my Trader Joe's canned red salmon--and I am not at all confident I have gotten it all. I have never used canned salmon before--are all brands like this? If we end up loving the cakes, I will use fresh salmon next time and poach it.

We really liked these. I didn't have corn or relish and used a little fish sauce instead of Worcestershire due to allergies. Also, used panko instead of crackers. I pressed the cakes too hard at first and they fell apart during cooking. Leaving them more or less alone worked better. Served these on a bed of zucchini/carrot slaw in vinaigrette, which balanced the richness of the cakes. Also striped with a light mayo/horseradish sauce. Pretty and great combination of flavors. (Leftover cakes were good on a salad the next day, too.) Will make this again for sure.

This was really good, although without the lemon yoghurt sauce, not exceptional. Still, I've been looking for a good recipe close to my Mom's "salmon croquettes" and this really worked well. I refrigerated the whole thing and made the cakes and breaded them right before frying. Held to gether well, and very tasty with a little cucumber, red pepper, red onion on the side.

These are better than anything with a main ingredient out of a can has a right to be -- really fantastic! I used Trader Joe's Red Salmon, and as someone suggested, panko instead of cracker crumbs for the outer coating. I needed both less mayo and more crumbs to make it hold together (maybe because I skipped the corn, which didn't appeal). Even better, they froze beautifully -- I cooked them still frozen, pan frying till crispy, then putting them into the oven for a few minutes to make sure they were warmed through. I also agree with the person who said that all they need is a squeeze of lemon juice. My freezer will never be without these from now on!

My quest for the perfect salmon cake is over! This recipe hits all the marks! We are low-carbing, so omitted the corn, increased the celery a little bit and added some capers. I used canned, smoked salmon...heavnly stuff! Also took the advice of others and reduced the mayo...really does not need as much as called for. I used cracker crumbs in the cakes themselves, but used panko crumbs as the coating. Makes for a crispier and lighter coating. I used cajun seasoning in place of the paprika, just used more. These are great for making ahead, just put them on a cookie sheet and flash freeze, then package in foodsaver bags or double wrap. Just partially thaw and proceed...they come out great! I'm making a double batch this weekend for fast weeknight dinners. YUM!

Even my picky 8-year old loved these. I didn't have any celery, nor did I have water chestnuts which is my usual substitute, so I omitted it. I did add a little extra corn and onion to make up for the missing "bulk", and they were just delicious. We were out of relish so I subbed an equal amt of diced pickle. They were quite soft before chilling, and the first one fell apart a bit during the dredging process - I was EXTRA EXTRA careful with the rest. ;). The sauce didn't do much for me by itself but went beautifully w/the salmon cakes. We love tarragon, so I used that and increased the amount.

Great stuff!! I was looking for a good recipe to use up a bunch of the canned things I bought for Hurricane Rita, and this one's a keeper. Used half a can of Veg All instead of the corn, took it easy with the mayo based on other comments, and used whole wheat saltines. I made tartar sauce instead, using canola mayo, yoghurt, some excellent dill pickles from our farmer's market, and a little Zatarain's mustard. YUMYUM. This will replace my Mom's old standy recipe from her old Betty Crocker...sorry, Mom, but this has a LOT more flavor. My husband loved it, and my 20 month old toddler (a big salmon fan) chowed down big time. I'll keep this in mind for fresh salmon leftovers, too....would probably be even better.

Simply delicious! I found the recipe to a little to moist(I'll be sure to make sure the salmon is WELL drained next time), but problem solved by adding a few more crackers to the mix. And I also added a tsp of Old Bay seasoning for that little extra kick. I served it with the Roasted Red Pepper Puree as suggested by someone in an earlier review, and it was spectacular. I also freezed a portion of the mixture for later use without any problems. My family can't wait for me to prepare this recipe again!

I made this recipe with a few changes suggested by other readers like green and red pepper in addition to the onion, celery, and corn. I used less mayonaise but added two beaten egg whites. I also added Old Bay seasoning instead of Tabisco. I made 4 large "hamburg" size patties. I also baked them in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes. I did drizzle them with olive oil and sprayed the pan first. They are terrific. Would make a great lo fat sandwich or dinner entree.

The salmon cakes were definitely delicious, however we did not like the yogurt sauce. I used mint as opposed to parsley.

Winning party fare.

I was worried after mixing all the ingredients that it seemed a bit soupy. But the patties held together, and they were quite tasty once golden brown.

This is a great recipe! I needed a quick way to use some left-over grilled salmon & made it tonight on the fly. I used fresh bread crumbs to mix in with the fish, but I liked the idea of the cracker crumbs for the coating. Turned out really nice. I will fine-tune this when I have time. I like the addition of capers that one cook suggested & I think a small amount of finely chopped roasted red peppers would be a fine addition. This is a recipe you try & make it your own!

YUMMY!! A HUGE hit with my guests and VERY easy to make. I used breadcrumbs instead of the cracker crumbs, leftover grilled sockeye salmon filet instead of canned, left the relish out as I dont like it, added 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning instead of the paprika and trippled the tobasco - they were EXCELLENT. I made the lemon-horseradish mayo (from the other salmon cake recipe on this site) and my usual for serving grilled salmon, "chipotle-lime mayo" - both were very good but everyone preferred the chipotle-lime mayo. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes salmon as a GREAT way to use up leftovers. It would also make a fantastic appetizer if made smaller. I'm going to try the suggestion of others below next time and cut back substantially on the oil - I'll let you know how much difference it makes (if any).

A nice variation on an old favorite -- and a great choice for casual entertaining. Definitely decrease the amount of mayo to make the mixture more firm. The lemon yogurt sauce was unexpectedly good--be sure to add lots of fresh mint (very finely chopped). If you want to dress up the presentatation of the dish, fill a mustard container (the yellow plastic ones with the long tip used for picnics) with the yogurt sauce and "paint" the sauce over the salmon cakes -- a zig zag pattern looks nice. Since the sauce is white, use a dark plate (navy, dark green, black) for presentation. Your guests will be impressed!

I agree with Cook from Valencia, the recepie was a bit too soft. The 2nd time I used Less Mayo and added additional craker crumbs to make a stiffer mixture. I also needed more heat so I added 8 more shakes of tabasco. I loved the Light Yogurt lemon sauce as it was a nice substitute for salsa verde which uses alot of olive oil. I added some dill to the sauce and once I added some capers which gave it a nice tang.
