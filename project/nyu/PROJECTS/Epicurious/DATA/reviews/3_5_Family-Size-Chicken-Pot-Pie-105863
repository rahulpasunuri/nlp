My son and I love this recipe. It usually makes enough for two pies so I freeze one. I think it is better to substitute corn starch for the flour. My wife, however, does not like dill. So I make a variation that substitutes cilantro for the dill, green tomato for the apple and omits the tarragon - also delicious!

Chicken pot pie is such a personal dish- like chicken noodle soup. This is a good recipe for personalization. For my version, I eliminated the apples and the tomatoes. I also replaced the tarragon with sage, and the dill with parsley. And I soaked dried porcini mushrooms in enough boiling water to cover them, and used the mushrooms and the resulting liquid with the chicken broth. And for vegetables, I also added a little broccoli and cauliflower.

This recipe is easy and delicious. A couple of quick tricks if you need a quick and easy version: 1. Buy premade pie crust (my family loves the marie callendar pie crust) and allow it to defrost while preparing the filling. 2. For vegetarians, substitute veggie broth for chicken broth and use Quorn Chicken Strips (Faux Chicken protein) as you would normally use chicken. Came out deliciously with big thumbs up from the vegetarians in the family.

Halved the amount of broth based on other reviewers - and added a touch more flour. Was not runny at all - husband and kids LOVED this pot pie. It's a keeper.

The complexity of the flavors was very interesting and I really liked it. The apples ended up being pretty mushy and there was A LOT of broth but overall I would absolutely make this again with some changes.

LOVED the taste! I loved dill and I love chicken pot pie. However, it was way too soupy and I had to serve it in bowls because of all the broth. That was after replacing 1/2c of the broth with milk. Will try half cream and half broth next time. I ended up using apple chicken sausage instead of regular chicken. Pie crust instead of puff pastry. Other than that, made to recipe and it was delicious!

Thought this was a great healthier version of the classic. I made it in a spring form pan with a top and bottom whole wheat crust (pre-baked the bottom) and used 2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 c half and half. I love creamy sauses so at the end I added in a bit of gorgonzola cheese and it was fantastic.

The perfect one-dish meal! I used a packaged deep-dish pie crust. It is both light and hearty. A hit with the kids.

Delicious! I used a regular pie crust and lemon chicken. I did not have a round 2 qt pan so split the recipe between 2 pie plates. The only drawback is the prep time, but it was worth it.

wildly popular with the kids. for vegetables i used onions, carrots, swiss chard and apple. no potatoes. substituted organic mushroom broth for chicken broth. added a layer of puff pastry to the bottom as suggested below. kids loved the "mushy noodleness" of it after it soaked up the sauce during baking. the greens and mushroom flavor gave the pie a nice seasonal earthy flavor.

This is a great recipe for chicken pot pie, my family loves it. Its very fresh tasting and a perfect fall dish - no sides needed because it has everything it already. I use ready made pie crust instead of puff pastry because the pie crusts holds up better for leftovers which we always have because there are only three of us and the recipe makes a large pot pie. The only downside is that there is alot of peeling and chopping involved and while its not hard to make, it is rather time consuming - but definitely worth it!

I really liked this recipe. I did make several changes... For instance, I used about 3 cups cubed sweet potatoes in place of the carrots and potatoes, I used another type of apple, I used about 1 1/2 cups peas, and I used diced cooked turkey instead (about 3 cups). I also added about 3 Tbl. of Trader Joe's roasted red pepper spread. Finally, I used a traditional pie crust on the top. I would make this again!!

Very disappointing considering the prep time. Veggies were too soft after baking even though directions were followed.

I couldn't help myself and use white wine to deglaze the pan and added some whole milk towards the end. The pastry cooked up fine but was dry. I usually put some melted butter or oil every couple of sheets and if I made this recipe again, I'd do just that. The apple was a nice touch. I added a couple of chopped shallots and skipped the tomato.

This was easy and simple, I added the second crust to make it more pie like. I removed the tomatoes and used parsnips to make it a more winter dish.

I was very skeptical about this pie even as I started making it. It lacks the creamy sauce that other pies possess and I really thought I was going to miss it. NOT AT ALL!! This was so delicious. I didn't have tarragon so I used tyme although I will try with the tarragon next time around. The apples and the dill were an amazing and unexpected burst of flavor.

My husband really liked this pot pie. I thought that the flavors deviated from the norm on pot pies a little too much. However, the first serving I had was one I really liked because I love trying new things and dill is fab. After that though, I just wanted a really good version of the old standby. And this is not it. Unfortunately I made 2 batches (half of which is still sitting in our freezer.) Part of the problem of cooking it is that in order for the puff pastry and the inside to cook correctly, the pot pie must be completely defrosted. We also felt that the puff pastry stayed a little gooey on the underside when we did cook it (even in the 1st batch). My husband suggested cooking the puff pastry separately and then adding it at the end.

This is amazingly delicious. I was a bit hesitant about the tarragon, but what a wonderful flavor this gave it. I didnt use any substitutions. I have made this countless times, and it never fails. Extremely tasty, better the next day.

I used two sheets of puff pastry, lightly oiled the pan and the one pastry sheet and spread it on the bottom of the pan, so as to have a bottom crust. The extra crust absorbed a good amount of the extra liquid in the recipe, and made more of an actual pie than this recipe really is (it's more of a casserole). Fed me happily for days!!

I made this dish for a potluck and it was a hit. I baked the chicken and then made stock out of the bones, which I then used in this recipe. However, I did divide the liquid between stock and half-and-half and then added about 1 tsp. of cornstarch to get the right consistency. I also bought pre-made pie crusts. I had no leftovers!

This was the first pot pie I have made and wasn't too impressed. I like more of a creamy consistency. This recipe was a little bland and more brothy than I prefer. Next time I will try the chicken and fall vegetable pot pie.

I read the other reviews and decided to reduce the chicken stock by 1/2 of a cup. It was not watery and tasted great. I also did not use a puff pastry. I bought a frozen pie crust from whole foods and put that on top. It was excellent. Would definitely make it again.

This turned out really well. To my surprise the kids ate every bite - even the tomatoes which I saw them eyeing warily. I roasted some chicken legs first, then stripped them - which added a nice flavour. The sauce wasn't runny at all. Appreciated the carb count as one of my children has Type 1 diabetes. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Loved the flavor of the tarragon and the sweetness of the apple. I used the store bought pie crust. Leftovers are just as good!

This recipe was watery and bland. It needs to be thicker and perhaps some brandy would help. I won't make it again.

What a delicous and easy pot pie recipe! I also used two puff pastry sheets, one for the bottom and one for top. I was so glad to find a recipe that didn't call for cream and I didn't miss it a bit. I skipped the apples this time, but maybe I'll be a bit more adventurous when I make it again.

My husband and I thought this was delicious. I used a different crust from another recipe, and used a springform pan, to make a big deep dish pie. I reduced the chicken broth to 2 cups, I was just worried that it might be a little runny, otherwise.

It was very good and had a very unique flavor (unlike the creamy versions). I did half the tarragon and used about half the dill and the flavor was still pretty powerful. I thought it was a bit runny and not so thick and creamy like what we're used to for a pot pie. Still yummy and will make again.

This is delicioous! And I don't even like chicken pot pie usually. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to line the casserole dish with a pie crust as well as use a pie crust for the top (can you ever have enough pie crust??). The granny smith apple and the dill make this. You've got to try this one.

My husband has been asking me to make chicken pot pie for months. All the recipes I've looked at called for so much butter and cream. This was so delicious. I served it with Arugala salad with manchego, apples, and carmalized walnuts. It was the best meal I've had in a while.

I made this recipe on a wintry, snowy day for my family. Everyone loved it (even my 6 & 7 year old sons) LOVED the apple...unique flavor for chicken pot pie. The egg wash gave it such a great color. Great flavors!!

This recipe was excellent. The only thing that I changed was that I used a premade pie crust for the bottom, put the filling in and then put puff pastry over the top. I tripled the recipe and froze the extra pies. They froze very well.

Made this recipe to use up the turkey leftovers. The dish was such a hit with my partner (and myself) that he wants me to cook another turkey immediately.

Recipe was delicious exactly as written. Would try a pie crust next time instead of puff. Two comments: (1) What good is someone's review if they change the recipe completely? Seattle and St. Louis's review and rating is for some other recipe (what half and half???) (2) Resist eliminating or reducing an ingredient just because a previous reviewer said THEY would (i.e. tarragon). Try it and make the adjustment next time, unless you are allergic to tarragon....

I substituted Pillsbury pie crust from the refrigerator section, and added a little extra dill. The dill is what sets this pot pie apart from all the rest.

I read the reviews of other cooks before I prepared this dish. It was not too runny, and the unusual addition of green apple and tomato didn't stand out, they just made it better. This recipe is delicious, relatively easy to make (in terms of washing dishes)and I am always going to be a Sheila Lukens fan.

This was a great recipe. I added heavy cream to the chicken broth to make it a little thicker, and I added white shoepeg corn to it. I used a flaky butter crust instead of the pastry puff. It turned out delicious!

Good pie. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe to the letter. The precooked chicken fell apart. It was still tasty but I'd prefer real chicken chunks. The filling was a little runny for my taste. I'll reduce the added broth to just 2 C next time. Great for a rainy, cold night, served beside the fireplace.

I made the dish with very few changes (halved the tarragon and dill and used two large russets). It came out so delicious I had to write in! I would definitely recommend using the tomatoes and Granny Smith apple. They both added flavor, sweetness and texture. My husband had three helpings!

Made this last night and the 3 of us gobbled it all up! I did make the following changes, additions - halved the tarragon, omitted the apple, tomato and peas, used the carrots, 2 large russets and 1.5 cups cut fresh baby green beans, increased the stock to 3 plus cups and added 1/2 cup white wine. For the chicken I used about a pound of cut up uncooked boneless chicken breasts. It came out great and my son even ate all the vegetables. This dish serves no more then 4.

A great recipe!! I did make a few changes. I left out the apple and tomato, added a little celery with the onion, used fresh tarragon instead of dried, and used pie crust(top and bottom) instead of puff pastry. This made it a bit more like a traditional pot pie, but with lots of crust. I couldn't find a pot pie recipe with a bottom crust, so I just tried it and it was great.

This is a good recipe for pot pie that doesn't use cream or milk--as most do. I left out the apple, added some diced turnips and corn. Also, I used Herbs de Provence and extra rosemary in place of the tarragon. It had a great flavor.

This meal was delicious! The whole family enjoyed it. The next time I make it I will decrease the tarragon to 1 tsp. It was just a bit too strong with that flavor but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! This one is getting added to my permanent file.
