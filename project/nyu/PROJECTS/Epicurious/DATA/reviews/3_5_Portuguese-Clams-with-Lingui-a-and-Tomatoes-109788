Excellent and fast. Discarded the clam shells, used hot italian sausage, added shrimp and a little cream, served over liguine. Crusty bread a must. Sprinkled with parsley - this sounded too Italian for cilantro.

Quick,easy,excellent. Increased the broth and the pepper sauce and everyone in the family enjoyed it, bread to dip in the sauce is also suggested.

This dish is delicious and easy to make. I added some extra liquid the second time I made it and like the consistency even better.

Loved this! The first "saver" I've found in a while. I used chorizo, and a little extra pepper sauce. We like spicey food. My husband drank all of the broth with a clamshell. You definately will want the bread to soak it up with.
