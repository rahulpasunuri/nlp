Great recipe, but it's a bit laborious, so i simplied it by using my juicer to extract the lime juice. i would also adjust my recipe for simple syrup as it made the sorbet a bit too sweet for my taste. But it was perfect for the day I made it as it was 100 degrees -- it was definitely nice and cool and refreshing.
