These were pretty tasty. They're nice and moist. Honestly, though, I would not consider the candied ginger optional. They're kind of "blah" without that little kick.

There is something missing from this recipe--it needs baking soda or baking powder. The cupcakes are very dense and almost seem like they are not cooked enough, even when I know they are. I added 1/2t of cinnamon and 1/2t of ginger and the cupcakes are still tasteless. These will be going in the trash.

these are really easy, and taste fantastic. i added more pumpkin pie spice to the mix for a more intense flavour. the icing is great - incredibly rich. i've made these twice (once for halloween, and once without the colouring for a party), and they disappeared quickly.

As an avid cupcake baker, I was very disappointed by this recipe. Unlike other reviewers, I followed the recipe exactly. There was way too much liquid in this recipe--the cupcakes were far to dense and moist to be called a cupcake (or even a quick bread). That said, the icing recipe is fantastic, and the cupcakes did have a lot of flavor. But I definitely prefer Family Fun's pumpkin cupcake recipe (http://familyfun.go.com/recipes/pumpkin-cupcakes-685575/) with some extra spices.

These were so easy and fast and came out very moist! I used some left over fresh pureed pumpkin I had frozen from the fall. The crystallized ginger added a wonderful texture and spice. I haven't frosted them yet... my one- year old loves them, so they may be gone before I get to it! They certainly don't need it. I'll definitely be making these again. Also, I don't have self-rising flour or pumpkin pie spice (why bother?!) so I used regular flour and added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 salt. For spices did 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves.

very quick and simple! I didn't bother with the crystalized ginger, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. They are moist and yummy!

I doubled the recipe, but like others found it a little shy of full batch. If I had put a little less would still fill muffin cup without creating a big top. I didn't double icing, there was lots. I used vanilla yogourt instead of sour cream and also added vanilla to the icing. They were moist and really yummy, I'm going to try another batch but regular muffin size and make them healthier for breakfast.

Very good; we had them at a party and received compliments. It's just a basic pumpkin cupcake with cream-cheese icing, so I wouldn't rate it exceptional even with the ginger. I used only about 1 tbsp ginger for regular-sized cupcakes, so maybe it wasn't enough to give it oomph. The recipe made 10 regular-sized cupcakes, a little on the small side.

Excellent recipe!! Did not use the ginger or color the frosting. Only had dark brown sugar, that worked fine as well. Doubled the recipe and it made almost 24 minis. Moist, flavorful, delicious.

Fantastic recipe! Could not be easier and faster to make. Dear hubby drove all over town after I gave up on the crystalized ginger hunt. So glad he found it because the candied ginger really makes this recipe exceptional. Made everything by the book and was done in no time flat. I tried one without the candy decorations and liked it even better. Maybe for your grown up parties just ice them in orange or white icing piped decoratively on top. You're going to want to make two batches of these! I sent my extra batch to work with my ginger hunter. Fantastic!

Great recipe! I baked these into mini- bundts instead of cupcakes and frosted them w/pumpkin cream cheese icing. They were so moist, not too dense and had great pumpkin flavor.

These cupcakes were fabulous! I didn't use the crystallized ginger, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. I made them for my book club and they were definitely a huge hit.

I cheated a bit and used canned pumpkin pie mix (my husband bought it by mistake), and I didn't tint the frosting, but I was hugely pleased with the results on this recipe. This is about as easy as prep gets when baking from scratch, but the proportions are all very well balanced and yield moist, slightly spicy cupcakes with a sweet, tangy frosting. I DEFINITELY recommend using the crystallized ginger if you're making this for adults, although it might be too spicy for kids with finicky palates.

These are great! Super easy and a great use for those cans of pumpkin puree from last year. I cut the sugar in the frosting down to 3/4 a cup and next time I am going to use a little less butter so the cream cheese flavor really comes through.

These were fantastic! I made two batches! Ihad tomake the following alterations : I couldnt find crystallized ginger, so I omitted it. I dont have mini-cupcake pans so I used regular size cupcakes pans (the recipe made 9 cupcakes- but the icing made enough to ice 24 cupcakes). They have to bake for 25-30 minutes if you use regular size cupcake pans. I substituted plain low fat yogurt because I didnt have sour cream. I think that this made them extra moist and accidentally lower in fat. Very yummy.

I just made these cupcakes and they are so good. My kids love decorating them. My only regret is that I did not double the batch -these will not last long in my household. I have 3/4 can of leftover pumpkin I guess I will just have to make more!

Great cupcakes. The pumpkin and spice really is a good complement to an extremely rich icing. Lots of possible permutations with candies etc., as indicated in the photo. Definitely not low-fat!!

This is a quick easy cupcake recipe and a nice change for the standard white or chocolate option. My recipe made 29 mini cupcakes. I filled my liners almost full as suggseted and some of the cupcakes overlapped the liners. Cooking time on convection was 13 minutes. The only downside is that they are time consuming and don't last very long.

These really were easy to make. I had enough batter to make three full-sized cupcakes after the 24 mini cupcakes. I made my own self rising flour (1 1/2 tsp. baking pwd, 1/2 tsp salt to one cup of all-purpose flour) instead of buying it. The frosting was very yummy too. The kids loved decorating the cupcakes. I'll definitely make these again.
