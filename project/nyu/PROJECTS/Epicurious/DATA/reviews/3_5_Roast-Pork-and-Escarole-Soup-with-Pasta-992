It was "good," not "delicious." Two forks. It got the job done, it was easy, everyone liked it and ate it, but I don´t think I´ll be putting it on the list of dishes I do fairly often. Too bad, because we eat a good amount of pork and I need recipes for leftovers.

We wanted a light and easy recipe to use for leftover pork loin and this fit the bill. Delicious, easy, and light.

Easy, tasty, good use for leftover pork roast. I added a can of cannellini beans - added nice body to the soup. Will definitely make again.

I've made this soup several times. It's a great way to utilize leftover pork roast. As another reviewer mentioned, it's better than the simple ingredient list might lead one to expect. Fresh oregano, if you have some, makes a big difference.

This recipe is so easy. I've made it twice and my family loves it. The parmesan gives a great flavour.

This is just wonderful...my husband absolutely loved it. I'm delighted to have a great recipe for left-over pork. I made the Parmesan Crisps on this site...these were great to float in the soup. This is a recipe that made it into my "Special File".

I also used the leftovers from the "Six Hour Pork Roast" from this site. All the herbs from the pork made the soup incredible.

This is a super recipe. Like others, I also made it with spinach, but I used ditalini instead of elbows. If you're not a garlic lover, two cloves of garlic are sufficient.

Comes together quickly and is tastier than the ingredient list might indicate.

I'm glad I came across this soup...it's different from the kinds I usually make and uses few ingredients. I haven't tired of it yet.

I have made this soup dozens of times. It is a great way to use leftover pork - which is sometimes a challenge. I use spinach instead of escarole. Sometimes I also add tomatoes. My family loves it with bow tie pasta instead of elbows. I serve in flat wide bowls with crusty bread and lots of parmesan. Yummy.

Fast, simple and tasty. I sliced some extra garlic in the broth which made the dishes extra flavorful. My daughter also thought it was great. A wonderful way to use leftover pork.

Really deserves 3.5 forks. So easy, so fast, looks good and tastes great. I used the leftovers from the incredible Six Hour Pork Roast, and the spice rub from that recipe may have made the difference, but this was way better than I expected. I also had to use spinach (no escarole available). It's hard to imagine it being much better.

Really good dinner soup. Used spinach and Asiago cheese and some ham from a Christmas cheese and ham gift. Wonder how many other combinations would work as well?!!

My family loved this soup. I added some carrots and white beans and used spinach instead of escarole. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. Used fresh collard greens instead. My 3 young kids loved it, even though they didn't eat greens, they got the nutrients, as they cooked in the soup. Great for left over roast pork. This will go in my family cookbook.

Great way to use leftover pork. Be mindful of flavors in original roast & adjust accordingly. I used fresh spinach instead of escarole (was not available) and it worked very well.
