Found this recipe in one of Gourmet's cookbooks and served last night to a party of 6 ... lots of leftovers. Yay! I made it as written except used plain Greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche and 1/2 jarlsberg instead of all gruyere ... think any good quality melting cheese(s) would work. The little bit of cayenne gave a little tingling on the tongue which I liked. Will add mushrooms next time as many reviewers have done and try the rotisserie chicken and canned broth as shortcuts. Great comfort food for a crowd on a cold evening!

This is the perfect comfort food on a cold day. Simple good food. Nothing fancy, but really warm delicious comfort food. Made it as written accept bought chicken broth rather than from scratch and used chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken. Turned out great and the broccolini was a nice complement.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner last year. It appealed to the kids but also satisfied adults. Made ahead and put in the oven after church. I thought that it was a little dry but still had a great taste.

This was a good recipe. kids liked it. i thought that it was a little dry - next time might add a little more liquid.

Not too difficult to make and is absolutely excellent. Some others have said the same thing and I agree, the amount of breadcrumbs is overkill and I'll definitely try it with half Gruyère and half cheddar next time. I threw some sliced mushrooms in there and it was great.

Absolutetly delicious - but I'd cut the breaded topping way down, 6 cups of bread crumbs was entirely too much.

I made this recipe for a meal swap dish and it was a hit! Even my kids loved the flavor. I took the advice of another reviewer and used half gruyere and half cheddar and it was perfect. This recipe is well worth the work and will be a staple in our kitchen.

I have made a nearly identical recipe many times and I suggest that you use half gruyere and half sharp cheddar. I now just cook about 8 chicken thighs plus vegs in low sodium stock from the store. The dark meat holds up better to the second cooking. I have also used lowfat sour cream instead of Creme Fr. It's always been a hit.

Very good, but as others have said, labor intensive! I did add sauteed mushrooms and was glad that I had done so.

First time I made this following the recipe exactly I was underwhelmed. Crust was great, but I agree with a reviewer who thought the sauce might as well have been canned cream soup. Since my first attempt, I've tweaked this quite a bit to punch up the flavor. Best tips are to use smoked mozzarella and some proscuitto.

I didn't have time to do the stock properly or the breadcrumbs, no doubt leading to my ho-hum result. I will consider making this again, perhaps for a potluck. A bit rich and heavy as a stand alone entree in my opinion.

This was fantastic, my college son comes home for dinner on Sunday nights and brings friends. They all really loved it, so did the rest of my family. Worth the time.

Very good. I made 1/2 recipe and poached boneless breasts in low sodium stock.

Rating: 4
I took shortcuts & this was still excellent. I cut the recipe in half, used a couple of leftover sauteed boneless chicken breasts (about 1.2 lbs. total) and used lower sodium chicken broth from a box. It was still terrific. The sauce thickened nicely in the 10-minute wait period. I'll definitely make this again.

I used the rotisserie chickens from Costco with great success. I've always had difficulty with bland stock, but now that problem is solved. I like that you can make many parts of this ahead. I didn't have two 9x13" dishes, so I split it into 3: one 9x13 and two 11x7 dishes, and froze the smaller ones. My boys are very happy that we will be having this again soon! I suspect that we will make this again, and when we do, I will be adding more cheese. I thought that the topping was great, but the body of the dish lacked a little in the cheese department. Another note -- all I had on hand was whole wheat penne and whole- grain bread. We have not cared for the whole wheat pasta in other applications, but it was good here, and we like the slight molasses-y taste the whole-grain bread gave the topping. It blended well with the nuttiness of the cheese.

I had mac and cheese at Artisinal, (one of Martha Stewart's favorite restaurants in New York) and it was amazing. Take the chicken out of this recipe and it is as good as what i had at Artisinal.

I followed the recipe exactly as I always do the first time I make a recipe. It was delicious and the hit of my dinner party. I was concerned that the topping was too thick, but it turned out crunchy, flavorful and beautifully golden. Some said it was their favorite part of the dish!

How could this not be good with all the rich ingredients!! After some of the reviews i wans't sure what to expect. I did the chicken from scratch. I doubled the ingredients for the stock but left the same amount of water. The stock was VERY good and I'm sure made a difference in the overall flavor. I made the stock a day ahead and was able to scoop off the fat. This was sooo good and sooo rich and it was definitely 10X's better than mac and cheese. I served this with asparagus.

For added flavor, I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken. Shred the meat from the bones, then place the bones and trimmings in the chicken broth. Boil a few minutes, then let it set. Strain broth. This adds depth to the dish with more flavorful chicken and a richer broth base.

The family loved it. I will only make 1/2 the recipe next time. I will also try the short cut version.

Good make ahead dish. I made this for a bridal shower. Assembled the day before and baked it there. Although I added extra gruyere to the sauce, it tasted more like a casserole you would make with canned cream soup. The ladies loved it, but I will save the pricey gruyere for other recipes.

I cut the recipe in half and used store-bought stock and a rotisserie chicken. I also added a small diced onion and sauteed it in the butter along with the garlic, which I think gave this more flavor than it would have had originally. Also, I added a bay leaf and a 1/2 cup of white wine during the simmering stage, and added a teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried mustard. This dish was amazing!! I will definitely make it again!

Thought this was 3.5 forks, and I took liberties using canned stock and rotisserie chicken. I lightened it up with non fat 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and low fat sour cream instead of the creme fraiche. I used the same amount of cheese, but used more of it in the sauce. It was very creamy and a little more healthy.

This was like a tetrazzini without the mushrooms. It needs more sauce for a creamier texture to contrast to the crunchy topping. It is definitely a rich dish & I'd make it again in cold weather.

I bought two rotisserie chickens and purchased chicken stock. It was very good. My guests devoured it. It's filling, and this recipe makes two large casseroles.

I found this dish extremely insignificant considering the "mac n cheese only 10 times better" description. It was bland and not worth the effort. I have a Gruyere macaroni and cheese recipe that is far superior, and the Barefoot Contessa pasta with 4 cheeses is easier and much tastier. I would not bother to make it again and was disappointed in the recipe.

I was so excited to make this recipe that I saved it for the coveted Sunday evening time slot. What a waste of time, effort and good ingredients. I thought it was bland and I was quite surprised by the consistency. Somehow, I had in my mind it would be a creamy sauce rather than the sturdy casserole type dish mine turned out to be.

This is macaroni and cheese but with chicken. Very ordinary. We love gruyere in baked fish with mushrooms from epicurious but it is wasted in this dish.

Made this for a football game gathering on a cold winter night. Everyone loved it. I added sliced mushrooms, a couple of handfulls of fresh baby spinach, and a teaspoon of herbs de provence to the cooking liquid. Drizzled the bread crumb topping with some melted butter- Yummy!

Very good. A little time consuming when made from scratch but everyone loved it. Didn't think it was bland. Be sure to use good quality cheese.

Tried to make this simplier by sauteing boneless chicken and using College Inn low-sodium chicken stock. To add flavor I added sauteed sliced mushrooms. Also topped the casserole with sliced tomatoes and then put the bread crumb mixture on top. Tasty, very rich, but not exceptional or worth the effort.

This dish was amazing. I used a rotiserrie chicken and made the broth to cut down on time. I gave it three forks because I think it had the potential to be bland had I not put a few of my own spices in. I added a bay leaf, wine and just a few pinches of chile to give it a little kick. I also mixed in a few mushrooms to add some texture to the dish. Everyone loved it and came back for seconds.

this is a great recipe, especially for a large group of people, and i made only a half recipe. i used a rotisserie chicken which made it easy, but would add a cup more stock to the sauce next time for a slightly more creamy version. very tasty!
