i, unfortunately, didn't read other reviews before making this recipe. I followed it exactly and it was disgusting. Soupy and inedible. We threw it out and went out for dinner.

Good basic recipe...minus so much butter and flour. Gets a little gluey that way. But...a good way to use left over turkey and a crowd pleaser. I used shallot (less) instead of onion, and added peas(tossed in at the end to retain color) and cooked baby carrots, then chopped. Oh...some thyme and freshly grated parmesan after the cream. As I said, a good basic recipe.

This was a tasty use of leftover turkey. I halved the recipe and took others' advice to reduce the chicken broth. I also diced three slices of bacon and fried it before the vegetables. That added some more flavor.

This is good - not great. A good use of leftover turkey. Following the advice of others, I decreased the chicken broth to 2 cups. Also, as another reviewer suggested the result can be rather bland. Therefore, I doubled the Worcestershire and lemon, and it added a bit of needed oomph to the flavors. Be sure to cook the floor adequately to get rid of that "floury taste." Easy. Everyone enjoyed.

I liked this dish a lot. It's a good way to use up leftover turkey. After reading the reviews, I used about a third of the liquids called for -- you can just add more as you go along to get the right consistency.

Good flavor, but too watery. Shouldn't call this a hash; more like an al-la-king dish. A bit too soupy for our liking.

also halved this recipe, using leftover turkey from thanksgiving. turned out quite well, enjoyed by the whole family. even without water, the hash turned out a bit soupier than i wanted. next time might add less chicken broth. additionally, added more worcestershire sauce, as the hash was originially rather bland. still, a nice dish to use for your turkey leftovers.

I halved this recipe and used canned turkey. I used a milk substitute (not soy milk) and it was very good. A very easy dish that was very flavorful - the lemon juice is the trick.
