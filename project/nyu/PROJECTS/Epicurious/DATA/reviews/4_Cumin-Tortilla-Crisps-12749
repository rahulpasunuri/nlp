A great way to use leftover tortillas. Stacked, then cut in 8 wedges instead of strips, tossed in bowl for better mixing, after first stirring the oil mixture in the same large bowl. With 1/4 tsp. of salt in the oil mixture, didn't need to add salt later. Also, not necessary to drain on paper towels at end. Not greasy.
