This was too amazing for words! The mint and cashews complimented each other so well. I was looking for an excuse to eat more of it! Just make it!

I used almonds instead of cashews and didn't measure anything. Added salt and pepper and fresh parmesean over pasta. Good use of left-over ingredients.

I just came across this recipe Saturday afternoon and had it with Lamb for dinner, and cold as a 'dip' for Sunday Lunch...yum

This pesto is wonderful. We had it with the "lamb with gingered mint pesto" recipe on this web site. The rub on the lamb goes very well with this pesto. Highly recommended together!

This is a great little condiment for meats or sandwiches. I thought it lacked a little umph, so I added in about 1/2 cup of peperoncini for some heat and acid. YUMMY!

This is very easy to make, and a little bit different from most pestos. The cashews and mint give it a very unusual (but good!) taste.
