an elegant version of an often over-seasoned dish. Since blackened/Cajun recipes became popular in the 80s, many have come to expect seafood dishes to be strongly spiced. The seasoning in this recipe is lighter than you might expect, and it is not as heavily sauced and cheesy as the other au gratin recipes. THIS IS ONE OF MY NEW ALL-TIME FAVORITES! If you like DELICATELY SEASONED gratin with a hint of cheese this is your recipe! I used a combination of reggiano parmesan, cheddar and Swiss. No bread crumbs. I ran it under the broiler for a minute or so at the end to crisp it up a bit on top. DRAIN THE CRAB MEAT FIRST: Some reviewers have complained about this recipe being runny. The recipe seems to assume people would already know to drain the crab meat before using it, but really should have stated so for those who are not used to cooking with crab. Drain it and you'll have much better results. There will be a bit of liquid in the bottom, especially if you don't serve it immediately when it comes out of the oven, but you can just serve with a slotted spoon. (You can use the drained crab-flavored water to create a base for a bisque that you can freeze for another day - as long don't add the cream or any of the other thickening ingredients like flour or cream of tartar).

Had this in North Carolina many years ago, and never forgot it. I have made it many times, and it is always wonderful! It deserves five forks!

Disappointing, not what I was expecting. I agree with other reviewers that this was watery, even after adding gruyere to the sauce.

I expect a recipe on epicurious to be good without endless tweaking. This one is not. I have tried it twice (to be fair) and find it watery and rather boring, especially in light of the cost of crab meat, even canned.

I expected more from a recipe with crab meat. This may be a nice substitute for clam chowder, but it's only a side dish. This recipe also requires a good meal to go with it because it is not substantial (fillng) enough to stand on its own.

This was delicious...could not stop eating it. The only reason I gave it 3 forks and not 4 is because I altered it slightly. I used some creme fraiche instead of heavy cream, subbed dried oregano for the tarragon, and added a healthy dose of tobasco, which I would highly recommend doing--not enough to really make it spicy, but it gave it a nice vinegary kick. Along with some other reviewers, I would agree that it was runny and not thick--this could probably be remedied by throwing in some cream cheese or other kind of cheese to amalgamate it more. Despite it's runny-ness,the taste was fantastic and made up for what the dish lacked in texture.

Added some artichoke hearts to the mix, and also some grated Italian cheeses, along with shallots instead of bell peppers. Used both Vermouth and wine and I think it worked well. Absolutely delicious recipe, and one I use often for company. Will try thickening the sauce per suggestions here, too!

Forgot to say we also added a dash of hot chili sauce - just enough for flavor, not for heat.

We made this for dinner last night with a few modifications (due to lacking certain ingredients) and it was outstanding. Definitely a keeper! We subbed vegetable broth for the chicken, omitted the tarragon, subbed milk for the cream, and used more cheese (added some mozzarella and even a mild white cheddar/monterey jack blend). Used a little flour to thicken the sauce. Served over pasta - terrific!

As per a reviewer I added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese to my mixture so that I wouldn't encounter the problem of it being too runny. This worked out fine. It was firm enough. One thing I didn't care for though was the taste of the melted parmesan cheese on top. I thought it didn't lend itself to the dish.

alcia55w from the Bronx, I would suggest using half and half, which I usually do any time I make a quiche.

Any suggestions for omitting the cream? This sounds yummy, but would like to cut down on the fat content.

I made this one night without the carrot and celery -- didn't have them --but with extra red bell pepper and some shallots. Good stuff, tho very rich. I ate it all by myself. Fresh lump crabmeat? Hard to mess up.

I loved this one but it didn't stop me from fiddling with it. I had no carrot and used some onion and since everything in this house is better with spice, added a little cayenne. My husband thought it was great and was glad I added the pepper. As I live very far from the sea, I used canned pasteurized crab from Trader Joe's and it worked great. I had been looking for a crab au gratin recipe for a long time and this really fit a memory of one I had in California many decades ago. I can't wait to make it again.

I have been making this for as long as it has been on epicurious. Fantastic!! Love it. One of my favorites. I buy the crab, have it cleaned, and crack it. ..It's worth it.

The flavor was really good but the consistancy was a little watery. I would either thicken it as Pinehurst suggested or add some mild creamy cheese.

Delicious! I make extra sauce and serve over rice as a main course.

REALLY GOOD!!! I doubled this, didn't mince the carrots (I added onion, omitted celery) but did everything else as written. Very good and kids ate it. Very rich, use small portions. I just read through the reviews and I love the portobella mushroom idea. I'll have to steal that! Very fast, easy dinner on a cold night.

Great low carb dish! I baked it for 30 minutes on 350. I also added onions w/ the other veggies. Nice change from the normal heavy cream versions.

If you want a thicker sauce just add a little cornstarch, 1/2 tbl to a little of the cold cream and then proceed with the recipe. It was a big hit at our wine tasting.

An excellent crab gratin, and a nice change from the cheese-heavy versions you usually see. We've made this dish several times. The sauce will be quite runny if you prepare it as written. When we serve it as an appetizer, we cook the sauce after the cream has been added a lot longer than the recipe calls for--about 5 to 7 minutes--and we add some parmesan cheese to the sauce. When we make the dish as an entree, we prepare it as written and serve it with rice instead of toast points.

Great as an appetizer and it only took me 30 minutes to make (including all chopping)! I mixed a few tablespoons of Parmesean in with the crab mixture and only sprinkled a small amount on the top. Impressive dish!

Rating: 3
Turned out well on my first attempt but needs more cheese in my opinion (but I am a cheese lover). Next time I will probably mix in 1/4 c. parmesan with the crab mixture and then top with an additional 1/4 c. I also think that the sauce needs to boil longer than indicated after adding the cream - I boiled it for about 5 minutes and still think it turned out to runny.

I think this is an absolutely fabulous dish. My goodness, could it be any easier? It can be made in a snap, totally NOT time consuming. Fresh lump crab meat is expensive, however, I wouldn't consider using anything else. This dish is very, very rich and as an appetizer I think one could stretch this to feed four. I have made this dish exactly as the recipe reads and it's simply delish. I've also played around with it by adding some minced green bell pepper and minced mushrooms, parsley, chives, cayenne pepper, and freshly grated cheddar cheese or Gruyere(underneath the parmesean). Divine! This recipe is a keeper for sure, very, very impressive.

didn't have fresh crab so used two four ounce cans, drained. Hubby praised it as a keeper. Next time I will use fresh lump crab.

excellent--left out the celery and still tasted great. parmesan adds a great touch in the end--be sure to mince your veggies very small!

I guess I'm the odd man out here as I absolutely hated this dish and thought it was a complete waste of my very expensive lump crab meat. I used dry vermouth instead of white wine and just thought it was horrible. I will not be making this recipe again.

My husband and I made this dish as an appetizer for our New Year's Eve dinner party, and it was a huge hit! We cooked it in individual ramekins and served with homemade parmesan-garlic toasts around the side of the plate. Very pretty presentation. Everyone loved it, even those that were not "seafood lovers." I highly recommend this!

I've made this receipe about 3 times in the 3 weeks that I extracted it off the internet. I just love it and everyone I've prepared it for love it. The only changes I've made were to double it and also to complete the preparation including broiling it but then I put it in the refrigerator for the next night put it into the over at 350 or so for 30 minutes or until bubbly and brown. I find it better and the sauce has set up more completely.

We had some portabella mushrooms, so we decided to stuff them with the gratin. After scraping out the gills, we put them under the broiler briefly, gill-side down, then flipped them over and filled them. We set the broiler to low and kept an eye on them until they were done. Delicious -- and rich! Yum.

I made the dish ahead and refrigerated it covered for two hours. After melting the cheese under the broiler, I still needed to reheat the casserole in the microwave. Nonetheless, two of us ate a double recipe and there were no left-overs. The taste is great.

I will be making this soon. Why I posted was I have had a dish just named Crab Au Gratin while up in the northeast (a quaint little inn in Pennsylvania, The Alberdeen, mmm..delish!), and it is to die for. If I can't make one similar to theirs I will start with this one and start modifying. Rich is a good word as someone said.

This is a good recipe, but after making it I see it more as an appetizer than an entree.

Canned crab works well, but not imitation. Fresh cannot be beat tho.

Jeesh, is crab meat expensive! I wonder how well it works with the imitation stuff... But man, was it good! Very rich, so be warned.
