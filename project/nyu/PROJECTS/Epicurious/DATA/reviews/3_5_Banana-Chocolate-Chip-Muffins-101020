Not sure I understand the issues of other commenters. Followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions - added vanilla & almond extract to wet ingredients, omitted the milk entirely, and used bittersweet chips. The muffins turned out perfect. I used slightly underripe bananas and left some large banana chunks. They smelled amazing (like banana) while baking and the banana flavor came through quite nicely. Very happy with these muffins. Got 14 out of them.

Mixed as instructed this batter turned out like bread dough- I had to add almost a full cup more milk. I have never heard of muffins that take 31 mins to bake & I took mine out at 20 mins so they wouldn't be dry but I found them too flat for my liking. I prefer fluffy muffins. The flavor was OK - chocolate saved them but I think brown sugar would improve the depth of flavor.

Perfect texture, but a bit bland. I made exactly according to the recipe except that I added 1 tsp vanilla. If I were to do these again, I would use SALTED butter (they need more salt), and maybe something for texture - chopped chocolate instead of chips? some oats? I don't know. I was underwhelmed.

Wonderful recipe! I used this as a base for gluten free, dairy free muffins and they came out perfectly! I used frozen, ripe bananas that I defrosted overnight. I substituted measure-for-measure a gluten free flour blend for the flour, canned coconut milk for the milk, and sunflower seed oil for the butter. Also used organic sugar, which has larger crystals than processed white sugar and added a cup of chopped walnuts. Yum!!! I baked in jumbo muffin cups and the batter yielded 6 perfect-sized jumbo muffins. It took my oven 30 minutes to cook them (I checked and flipped the pan at 20 minutes). I may try them with 'buttermilk' (coconut milk with juice of a lemon mixed in) next time because I think the batter would do well with some acid. Extremely pleased at the outcome and will definitely make these again for my gf, df clients!

I've made these banana chocolate chip muffin receipe since I first saw the receipe in Bon Appetit Magazine back in 1999. I use defrosted frozen bananas which somehow make these muffins the moistest muffins even! Over the years, my kids (now aged 27 and 20) always ask for them......These muffins are delicious!

This is the 3rd recipe I have tried for Banana Chocolate Chip muffins, and I would choose the others over this one any day. There is too much butter in the muffins and it drowns out the flavor of the banana. I would not make this again.

Made with part whole wheat flour and part brown sugar. The 32 minutes was way too long! The muffins were ready a long time before then (I tested mine at 25 minutes and they were done). Tasted great though.

OMGGGGGGGGGG. So this was my first time making banana muffins, and I was looking for a recipe that did not call for baking soda (since I didnt have any on hand) I came across this and read the reviews and had to try it out... YESSSSSSSS is all I can say. I didnt have ap flour on hand either so I used cake flour, which made the muffins very fluffy but still a muffin texture. I used 2 bananas added 1 tsp vanilla and a few dashes of cinnamon. Did not include the chocolate but did add walnuts, as I was wanting to make banana nut muffins. Anyways the batter made 10 regular size muffins and baked right at 30 mins. LOVE THEM. Baked them this morning and had one for breakfast.

I've been making this for years whenever we have mushy bananas. Like some other reviewers, I substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour, and applesauce for the butter. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla. I'm sure the sugar and chocolate chips could also be cut back, but I haven't tried that. I have also used a grated zucchini for part of the banana when I only had 1 banana. I've never made it the original way, but they're so delicious I've never felt the need to! Whenever I bring then into work, people ask for the recipe.

I used half a cup of sugar and another small banana and it was nearing almost too sweet but it was still a very moist, delicious muffin. Mine also took less than 30mins to bake.

These have been my "go-to" muffins for years and I usually whip up a batch when my husband is hosting meetings in his home office. This morning, I was thinking that the batter was particularly light and fluffy and after putting them in the oven, had a panic moment when I realized that I had forgotten to add the egg. I almost pulled them out but then decided to give it a try... they turned out perfectly!! Doubt I would ever do that intentionally, but good to know if ever I'm out of eggs in future!

Easy to make and very flavorful. I omitted the sugar entirely; the bananas and chocolate provide plenty of sweetness, adding sugar on top of that is unnecessary.

I, like many of you, changed a few things: substituted white whole wheat flour for all of the flour, used an extra banana, added one tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla extract, and also added 4 Tablespoons of wheat germ! I also added an additional splash of skim milk. My 11 year old daughter said they were awesome!! I will definitely be making these again and maybe try to reduce the fat by adding applesauce and/or greek yogurt. Enjoy!!!

These are my go-to muffins. My daughter's friends request them every time they come to visit. We end up snagging them right out of the cupcake pan and gobbling them up before they even have time to cool down. I've cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, and they are still plenty sweet.

Made these muffins for a early morning breakfast pre-Christamas shopping spree eith my best friend and our hubbies... so I was baking to impress a bit! This makes such a beautiful batter! I used to work in a Artisan Bakery and this is a top notch recipe! I did toy around with it a little though... Had some leftover melted white chocolate (about 1Tbs) that mixed in with the melted butter and added to batter. I also added some ground flax seeds to the dry ingredients (1/2 Tbs). I generously sprinkled ground cinnamon into the batter. I also sprinkled the muffin tops with dark brown sugar and more cinnamon! Several posters mentioned using vanilla -I did not add this. Did use good quality dark chocolate (2/4c. of 60% and 1/4c. 90%) which I chopped with a knife for a finer texture to the muffin. I feel the white chocolate sweetened up the dough enough that it balanced out the intensity of the rich dark chocolate. They look lovely as well!

Oh, in my review below, I forgot to mention that I use sea salt instead of regular salt. The sa salt with the sweet really makes it perfect!

This recipe rocks! I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract, as suggested by many, and after placing in pan, before baking, I top each muffin batter with a generous sprinkle of natural sugar. I use Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate chips, which are fabulous. The recipe only makes 10, since I fill the cups rather full. Perfect muffin.

Sensationally delicious. I thought it was a lot of butter but the result is a decadently moist and rich muffin -- nearly cakelike. If I'm not feeling so indulgent in the future, I may replace some of the fat with Greek yogurt for added protein. My modifications: I substituted bittersweet Tollhouse chocolate chunks instead of semisweet chips, used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose, and added a teaspoon of vanilla with the other wet ingredients. I ended up with 14 muffins instead of an even dozen (maybe a smaller-than-average tin?) but no one's complaining.

This is a good recipe. I agree with others - add vanilla. I would have liked them to be a bit sweeter, so I will add 3/4 c sugar next time. I also wanted a coconut flavor, so I add some coconut milk.

Love this recipe. I added it to my recipe box in January 2002 and it has been my go-to banana "bread" recipe ever since. The only changes I make are adding 1 tsp. vanilla and I use the mini chocolate chips.

I used four bananas instead of two, halved the butter, substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. The muffins were delicious - I didn't miss the extra fat and the whole wheat pasty flour wasn't heavy. I agree that mini chocolate chips would be less overwhelming. I don't think just adding less would make that much difference. I'll definitely make these again and might throw in a quarter cup of wheat bran as well.

Great recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (with 1 cup all purpose), used 4 very ripe banans, so they made more than a cup, cut back the butter to 3/4 stick (6 Tbsp.) and substituted soymilk for whole milk So a little more healthy, a little less caloric. But delicious. I also increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup. Use Ghirardelli, which are so much better than Nestles, but they're smaller so they worked better in the muffins.

Very easy to make and really delicious! They're best straight out of the oven but they keep for a few days and still taste good. My friends accidentally bought salted butter, so if you don't add the salt it works just as well. Also, I had to wait a little bit before putting the batter in the oven and the muffins kept quite well in the fridge. This is a great recipe for anyone who wants an easy muffin recipe!

So yummy. I didn't have chocolate chips (or walnuts or anything to add) so I just made them plain banana muffins, but added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg to add a light spice flavor. I used mini-muffin pans (2 batches; 24 mini muffins) and they took around 15-17 minutes to bake. So easy and such a great result!

Rating: 4
Extremely yummy - perfect with coffee! I only had non fat milk, so I subbed Half N Half with great results. I think I may add one more banana next time as the muffins, though they were somewhat moist, weren't moist enough for me. I also didn't have chocolate chips on hand, but what I did have was a Scharfenberger baking bar (semisweet), so I chopped that up into choc chip size chunks. This was my favorite part! The shavings that came off of the chocolate as a result of chopping it added wonderful chocolate flavor. Also made them look a little more artisan. :-)

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I added an extra banana because I was trying to use up the 4 brown ones we had but was worried all four would be too much (should've just saved the two in the freezer for another batch!). I also substituted walnuts for chocolate chips since we didn't have any but we did have walnuts. Was an excellent, simple recipe,and was very quick to make. We had enough to make 12 muffins as well as a loaf of banana bread with this. Tastes great with a little butter C:

Lovely. Best muffin I think I have had. Made significant changes though. Used 4 medium to large-sized bananas. 3 tsp baking powder. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom to taste (added significant amounts of each). No milk, because the extra bananas provided for a lot of moisture. No extra flour added (did not want to undo the extra moisture). No chocolate chips. Used a streusel topping instead (butter, brown sugar.. check streusel topping recipe that goes with the blueberry streusel cake recipe on epicurious). No other changes to recipe. Baked for 30 minutes at 350, but starting checking on it at 25 minutes onwards. Seriously the loveliest muffins me or my boyfriend have had.

And these were the best banana muffins I have ever had - maybe the best muffins! Not too dense, not to greasy - fantastic! I used 3 very ripe bananas which worked out perfectly. Maybe next time I will make some healthy substitutions & I may add a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, but these will be hard to beat. These freeze very well. Enjoy.

AMAZING. I made a "healthy" version of these by using 100% whole wheat flour (no white flour at all), raw brown sugar(the big crystals) , plain non-fat yogurt(to replace the butter), and an extra banana. I also added a splash of vanilla extract. Delicious breakfast muffin that tastes sinful without spiking the blood sugar.

This recipe is excellent as is but if you'd like to make some healthy modifications that don't affect the great taste, here's what I did: 3/4 whole wheat flour and 3/4 all purpose plus an extra 2 tablespoons (instead of the 1 1/2 all purpose); 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup sugar; 3 large bananas instead of 2; 7 tablespoons butter instead of 8. I didn't miss the sugar or butter but I loved the extra banana taste and with these slight modifications, I feel better when my toddler gobbles these down!

These are fantastic. The best recipe I have tried so far for these muffins, and it will be my keeper. I know some people hate substitutions, but I am including mine anyway as it makes for a 'little' healthier muffin. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/3 cup veg. oil. I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of a.p. flour. Still made for nice light muffins.

I love this recipe! It's easy peasy and truly yummy! I altered my version just a tad though--followed some of the tips from the reviews right here and added: 1/2 tsp baking soda & 1 tbsp vanilla extract. Additionally, I used 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and topped the batter off with sprinkles of chocolate chips (which, btw, I subbed with chunks of semi- sweet Hersheys cooking choc). Oh, also, I only baked half of the recipe and thus lessened the baking time to about 24 minutes only and found them to be perfectly moist. Simply divine!

We love these muffins. They are easy and quick to make and taste decadent, especially when eaten while still warm and the chocolate is still melty and gooey. They are also good cooled down.

This is a definite winner.

I followed almost everything except I had run out of white sugar so I used brown sugar, and I chopped a couple of dark 70% chocolate bars that were lying around since I didn't have chips. Turned out fantastic.

By far the best banana muffins I've made. I followed Oakland's suggestion and added vanilla & used mini chips.

My family loves this recipe! I made several changes based on other reviews. I used 1/2 Cup sugar, added another banana, 1/2tsp. baking soda, 1tsp. vanilla and used mini chips. I also added about 1and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I sprinkle the tops with cinnamon and sugar just before baking. These are a wonderful breakfast, brunch, party food or snack. They also freeze beautifully.

Yum! Made these for a bachelorette party and they were a huge hit and stayed moist for two days. I made the following adjustments: 1/3 sugar, added 1/2 tsp baking soda, 3 bananas which had been frozen, 1/3 stick butter, and put the chocolate chips in the food processor to grind up into smaller pieces before adding to the dough. Will definitely make again!

I just made these muffins and they were great! I doubled the recipe, and used some of the modifications mentioned by other reviewers -- less sugar, less butter, more bananas. The muffins are definitely sweet and I might even reduce the sugar more the next time I make them. They rose beautifully as well. Thanks to all of you fabulous cooks out there who review these recipes -- I really rely on these reviews and appreciate what a great resource you all are! (Kudos to epicurious as well.)

I didn't have any unsalted butter or chocolate chips on hand so I used salted butter (becel olive oil butter) and cut out the 1/4 teaspoon salt...and chopped up 3 hershey chocolate bars (2 dark almond and 1 milk chocolate) in place of the chocolate chips. I followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out really well. It's not the most amazing recipe ever - but then again, I had to make do with what I had.

I made these muffins twice this week. The first time, I followed some of the modifications suggested by other cooks: a liitle less sugar and butter and a shorter cooking time. They turned out well but the 2nd time they were even better when I included the following mods: less than a 1/2 cup sugar, 6 tblsp butter, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and 1 tsp vanilla. This slightly healthier version was tastier than the original! I also used frozen bananas that we had put in the freezer when they were overripe and was pleased that they worked so well.

I made the recipe as written with the addition of a bit of vanilla. There are delicious. I'd like to alter the recipe a bit so I can decrease the amount of butter used. I should have read the reviews to make them more muffin like. They ended up kinda flat but I'm blaming it on my poor high altitude alterations. I'll try again with the suggestions and see how it turns out.

I used three bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 instead of 2/3 C sugar, and added 1/2 tsp baking soda (following other cooks' recommendations). The muffins did not rise enormously but they are light-textured. I prefer muffins to taste like the "mix-ins" in them, not the sugar, and these are definitely nicely banana-y.

Rating: 3
These are fantastic muffins. I did a few substitutions based on other reviews. I used half the butter and used half a cup of light sour cream, added 1/2 tsp baking soda, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dash of vanilla and a third banana. I also used 1 cup of regular size chocolate chips but I chopped some of them up. They turned out moist and fluffy, not dense at all with lots of chocolatey bits!!

I omitted two tbsp of butter and added a container of Mott's banana-flavored applesauce. I also used about half a cup of frozen strawberries and chocolate chunks instead of chips. The result was unbelievable. It yielded ten muffins, and I ate four all by myself before sharing. This is a definite must-make!!

Absolutely wonderful... sooo yummy!! Best banana muffins i have ever had so moist and delicious!! Only thing i did different was that i replaced half the sugar with light brown sugar (1/3 cup) and added 1 tsp of madagascar bourbon vanilla extract. Oh and i used mini chocolate chips (i don't like big chunks of chocolate).

Just made for the first time. Very good. Used enough variations to practically make a new recipe: 7 T butter [room temp, not melted], 1/4 c + 1 T buttermilk instead of milk [I find that buttermilk clings to the measuring cup, hence the added 1 T], 3 bananas, 1/3 c packed brown sugar in place of the white sugar [mix in with the wet ingredients, not the dry], 1 T madagascar bourbon vanilla, 1 c semi-sweet chips, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp baking soda to get the sought-after "muffin top". Makes 6 large muffins [used non-stick tin and they popped right out]. 32 minutes was the perfect cooking time. Didn't have wheat flour, but next time will try that substitution as well.

What a 'no brainer' of a recipe. Followed it exactly. The bottom of the muffins where greasey when I popped them out of the muffin tin - not a lot of butter in them though... mmmmmm Anyways - they are not healthy muffins by they are delicious! Yum!!

Oh...were these ever good! A bit heavy on the butter (almost came out deep fried, will use less next time), and didnt use salt as i used salted butter. Used 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white.

With the exception of adding a tsp. of vanilla, I made these according to the recipe and they were fabulous! Moist, not-too-sweet, chocolate-y, and with a subtle, yet delicious, banana flavor. I think I'll have to double the batch in the future because these are going to go quick.

I have made this recipe since it first appeared in 1999, but I just had to let everyone know, after all these years, my kids still love them in their lunch everyday, and to snack on after school. I have made these muffins for my son's basketball team as well, and they all rave over the muffins! Especially the coach.

My family inhales these, which is why they are not made often in our home. These are better when eaten on day two or three, after the flavors have had a chance to blend together. I agree about using less sugar. I used about 1/8 to 1/4 of a cup less. And i also use mini choc chips so as not to overwhelm the muffin's flavor, but chocaholics feel free to disagree. I only gave this three forks because while it is definitely a great addition to any brunch spread or simply a nice sunday morning treat, it is really not anything extraordinary. I guess a muffin is a muffin in my mind.

I did the same substitutions as other reviewers and now these muffins are a family favorite. Even good without the chocolate chips.

Made these for a friend who's pretty snooty about food. Well,she loved these. The banana flavour was mild and added just a sweet fragrance to the moist yummy chocolaty muffin. I filled my 6-cup tins to the brim and got 8 muffins.

Great muffins that have become a family favorite!

Can't say how they keep, as they get shared & eaten within the first day or two.

These muffins were "just OK." Like another reviewer, I made them to take to the office and ended up not doing so because they weren't that great. I used the whole cup of chocolate chips, I personally think it might have needed more. Added the vanilla, too, and an extra banana. The consistency of these muffins is very dense. They don't rise very much. I think the problem is that the flavors don't really come together very well. I even put cinnamon. I think there are better recipes out there. For a better way to use your own bananas, try the banana coffee cake with chocolate chip strudel (don't know the exact title) on this website.

My family loved these muffins. I followed the recipe exactly, using skim milk. Personally, they were a little sweet for me, but my family didn't mind. I found that it only took 22 minutes in the oven and they came out perfect. Next time I may decrease the sugar in the recipe and sprinkle a little on the tops, just to give it a little crunch. A quick and easy recipe.

Very rich, too much butter. Can't understand how some reviews say their kids finished them off as soon as they were made - I sure hope those people had 12 kids! Made them using cinnamon chips instead of chocolate. Wasn't overwhelmed, but as it is always good to have a recipe on hand to use up browning bananas, I will try it again using several substitutions that others have suggested.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1 tsp. vanilla. Was good, but next time I would add one more banana and maybe even a little more sugar. All in all, decent recipe but I enjoy trying new recipes all the time and don't plan on ever sticking to just one. The search continues.........

I have to laugh when people complain about too much banana flavor in banana muffins! What should they taste like? Brussle sprouts? I actually hate bananas myself but my 2 year old loves them (and chocolate of course!) I added 2 extra bananas, used whole wheat flour, skim milk and only 3 tbs. butter (where is the joy, right?!?) Anyway- the kids love them because of the chocolate and I feel like they are a pretty healthy treat.

I have two preschool boys, and these muffins are one of their favorite recipes. We make them every few weeks. But for adult tastes, they're a bit sweet and heavy on the fat for an every day dish. We serve them as a side dish for brunches and special breakfasts.

i NEVER make recipes healthier-- but i did today. and they were super yummy. i kept all of the proportions the same but used fructose instead of sucrose, 1/2 of the flour was whole wheat, and used chocolate chips from the bulk section at whole foods (i forget how they're different, but they are)... and wow! you can feel a bit less guilty and still enjoy the same!

I thought these muffins were pretty good, although I'm not a big fan of banana flavored pastries and this was definitely heavy on the banana flavor. However, these were easy to make, even considering I was missing the egg and only had salted butter (just added some sugar, and a tsp. of vanilla extract like someone suggested). They baked perfectly and tasted good.

Rating: 3
Made these little jems this evening. Because earlier reviews that they could be oily, I chose to substitute 1/2 of the butter with baby-food bananas (works like applesauce, but adds more banana flavor). Also reduced the sugar since the strained bananas are naturally sweet. Really delicious - moist, not greasy, packed a huge banana-flavored punch. YUM

Rating: 3
I make these without the chocolate chips, according to my kids' requests (I know--they're freaks. . . ), and they're great as just banana muffins. I use sour cream in place of the milk, add 1 t. vanilla, and up the salt to 1/2 t (usually I cut back on salt in recipes, but it's not too much at all here), and they're wonderful. A heavy but moist muffin that disappear as fast as I can make them.

Pretty good. I increased the semi-sweet chocolate chips to 1 full cup. Used canola oil instead of butter (more economical and tastes just as good). Baked for 35 minutes. Added the vanilla others suggested. Will try almond extract next time. I also doubled the recipe and filled the 12 muffin cups to the brim since these muffins do not rise much and I like muffins to have big tops. Didn't need muffin papers; just greased the muffin tims well with Crisco and dusted them with flour.

I made a vegan version and it was a great hit.I omitted the egg and used vanilla soymilk instead of whole milk. I added about a tablespoon extra of soymilk cause it looked dry. They came out great! Nexttime i will use applesauce instead of margarine and not feel so guilty for eating them.

Apologies to anyone who tried my flaxseed meal fat reduction technique on these muffins. Correct proportions for one batch should be 1/4 cup melted butter to 3/4 cup flaxseed meal. Note that the muffins will brown faster. Kids still love them, and they are healthier.

Great if you like to add extra fat to your diet! I didn't have foil muffin cups - thank goodness because you wouldn't believe how much butter leached out into the tin. They recommend foil so every drop of fat gets into your body. Flavor was fabulous, I had one hot out of the oven and it was like eating a hot fudgy banana split - very tasty, but just too greasy. I will try again with 1/4 the butter and applesauce instead.

Great for lunchboxes! I substituted whole wheat flour for all of the all-purpose flour and 2 small grated apples for a banana. (The flour to make it healthier and the apples were because one of my bananas was rotten.) Wrap individually in plastic wrap and freeze in a plastic container. Pop one in a lunchbox and they thaw beautifully. Very, very tasty and no "whole wheaty" taste. This is a keeper.

As it was mentioned previously, but these are dense muffins and very moist. I actually enjoyed them and felt they were filling. One could last you all morning. I did modify the recipe a little. I used 4 Large Bananas, 1 Cup of Chocolate chips and Whole wheat flour instead of white for a healthy addition. I would definitely make them again. In fact, I have guests coming to visit for Thanksgiving...what a good breakfast treat. My husband LOVED them. I know they'll be a hit.

Not great--I was expecting better, given all of the rave reviews. I followed the recipe, rather than trying any modifications--while I didn't find them any sweeter than many quick breads, I can see why some people didn't like that aspect. They're a bit heavy, though, and rather dry--don't expect soft muffins that will dent when you press a finger to them. (On the other hand, I suspect these travel very well--they'd be a great birthday treat for kids to take to school, since they have the sweet chocolate taste without the actual cupcake quality.) All in all, I have many better recipes for bananas.

These muffins were incredibly delicious! I used double the bananas suggested, mini dark chocolate chips, and also added a little vanilla extract.

I use 3 bananas, mini chocolate chips, up to 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and cut back the butter to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) by adding 1 and a half cups flaxseed meal. The kids never notice the difference, and it is healthier.

Great muffins! After reading the other reviews, I made a couple of adjustments myself. I used three bananas rather than two. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar rather than 2/3 cup. This was because I wanted to use milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I also found that I could fill the cups almost to the top for they did not rise as much as a regular muffin.

Very good, but I concur with the other posters who found them sweet. I wouldn't consider it a 'breakfast' muffin. More along the lines of something you'd serve, frosted, at a kid's birthday party.

I agree that really ripe bananas should be used otherwise the banana flavor gets a little lost. I put in less sugar (between 1/4 - 1/3 cup) than stated in the recipe because I thought 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips was plenty, but what happened was that I got a pretty doughy muffin that was tasty only at the bits where chips or banana met the muffin, so don't skimp too much on the sugar even for people who don't have a sweet tooth (I don't). Nevertheless, texture was soft and chewy but not too moist.

These were delish! The melted butter and the milk give these muffins nice moistness, without resorting to oil. I substituted milk chocolate chips and added a 1/2 t. of vanilla and some toasted chopped pecans. The muffins are sweet enough as is, so I won't be adding sugar on top as I did this time. And as other reviewer's say, extra banana IS called for. These would make a great brunch muffin; I'll be baking them up again!

Yum!!I found this recipe, read the reviews and immediately went into my kitchen to make these, since I've been dying for something banana-y. These are very easy, and delicious. I did add more bananas then called for, as I have about 5 black ones on my counter, and added about a cup of chocolate chips, since in my house the more chocolate the better. I also made the mini muffins (20 minutes baking time) but that may have been a mistake....they're so tiny it's easy to keep eating them.....I will definitely be sending these as a snack for my 1st grader tomorrow and my husband will be bringing them to work as well. Give these a try!!

Really yummy. I made mini-muffins and baked for 15 minutes - perhaps a bit underbaked at that time. Used Ghiradhelli Double chocolate chips and had no problems with the chips sinking. My only problem was that I only had 2 bananas and it didn't make enough mash - like a previous reviewer suggested, I added a bit of sour cream to supplement, which made for a moist muffin, but not banana-ey enough. Definitely err on the side of more banana!

My 2-year old loves to help make this -- and the recipe is indestructible. He's poured the baking powder in the liquids, used an entire bag of mini-chocolate chips, used more than a cup of banana, and we've even split one batch between regular sized muffins and a mini-muffin tin (Baked for 5 minutes less)... and the results are great. I do recommend the mini-chips over the usual bigger ones.

A good alternative to banana nut bread. I'd add some nuts though next time. Also, I didn't use paper cups, I just greased the muffin tins and they came out fine. I also sprinkled some coarse sugar on the tops before I put them into the oven; that gave them a little crunchiness on top.

Easy to make and yummy! Next time I'll add more banana and I may cut down on the chocolate since the flavors didn't balance to my liking.

These are fantastic muffins. My favorite banana muffin recipe of all time! I used Ghirardelli chocolate and it made the muffins even better!

Rating: 4
These were by far the best banana muffins I have ever made, and I even (involuntarily) used whole wheat flour because it was all I had in the house. I also used a bit more banana than the recipe calls for. In the end, I think the butter makes all the difference.

Wonderful recipe just the way it is. The only modification I made was to bake it in mini-muffin tins (350 degress for 12 minutes) to size down for my little ones. The result was a nice, moist, flavorful muffin.

This is a wonderful recipe. I'd encourage people to make it as directed - The butter makes the muffins super delicious, though they are more like cupcakes than muffins.

I substituted sunflower oil for the melted butter, and added a bit more banana than specified. Baked them in mini-muffin tins, they took around 18 minutes in the oven. They turned out very moist and "banana-ey". Very good and quick to prepare! :o)

This was a big hit at the office meeting. I cut the butter in half and doubled the amount of milk (whole), for a lighter taste. I also put in a little extra chocolate chips. Sooooooooooo delicious!

These were a big hit with my husband. I don't really like banana things, and even I liked them! Of course, I added 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut along with the chocolate chips (and then did a mixture of the chocolate, chopped finely, the nuts and the coconut with a bit of flour, sugar and melted butter and spooned that on top of the muffin batter before baking). Made 6 large muffins, baked for 35 minutes and they were perfect! Will definitely make again.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever found for banana chocolate chip muffins. I only used half the butter and a little extra banana, and the end result was delicious.

Rating: 3
This is the perfect recipe for bananas that need to be used. I used mini muffin pans for a bite-sized result and they were a huge hit with the family and our guests. We used milk chocolate rather than semisweet and it was delicious. I think the sweetness is a personal preference--either will work. This is really more of a dessert or snack than a breakfast muffin!

These muffins turned out great for me! I did modify the recipe a little, I used half mini chocholate chips and half regular chips. I also baked them in a large muffin pan, making giant muffins, yum!

Have made this three times already and everybody loves them. Have given the recipe away to four or five people that asked for it. Followed the recipe to the letter, actually forgot the egg once and they were still good. These are wonderful!

This recipe was simple, yet delicious. My kids loved the muffins. I've tried making them using applesause in place of the butter, but, they were not as tasty and had a funky texture. I do, however, cut the sugar and use mini chocolate chips.

Rating: 2
I took other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. It was pretty tasty, but not good enough for me to bring to work to share. I agree that this is more of a cupcake than a muffin, and I could see why kids would love it. Tastes better reheated too.

I have been making these muffins regularly for about a month now. They are by far the best muffins I have ever made. I have made them for my sons preschool and my daughters second grade class the kids all loved them. They are also a big hit with adults. There are never any extras left! I use mini chocolate chips as they stay in the batter instead of sinking to the bottem.

Delicious! A great alternative to regular old banana bread. Fast and easy to make with the kids -- they loved them, and so did I. Tastes best straight out of the oven (beware of melted chocolate chips decorating your chin)!

Just okay. I found these to be more of a cupcake texture and flavor, than a muffin. I made miniature muffins, baked about 12 minutes (low altitude). If I made them again I'd use milk chocolate, rather than semi sweet choco chips and would use miniature chips, as the chocolate was overwhelming and sweet. Not a bad recipe, but not outstanding.

These muffins are delicious. I tried using the recipe for apple cinnamon muffins and they turned out terrific. Simply substitute the one cup banana with 1.5 cup finely chopped apples and add 2 tsp ground cinnamon. Increase the milk to half a cup and add 1/4 cup veggie oil. Replace chocolate with ground walnuts. Yummy!

I made this in a jumbo muffin pan, making 6 large muffins. They were delicious. I used black walnuts and Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Even my 3 year old liked them!

These muffins are great--very moist and great banana flavor. I use fewer chips and less sugar than recipe calls for, and 2 1/2 bananas. I also substitute about 1/4 c. flour with whole wheat flour and add about a tsp. of vanilla. I make these almost every week, and my husband and neighbors can't wait to have one warm from the oven. If any make it past the day you bake 'em, they keep well, too.

A wonderful recipe for simple, but yummy muffins. I found that the suggested amount of sugar made the muffins too sweet for just one dozen, especially if your bananas are really good and ripe. But when I doubled the recipe to make bigger muffins, the amount of sugar in the recipe was perfect.

Very good! Moist and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed, especially my boys. Don't know if I liked them better right out of the oven(gooey chocolate-yum!), or the next AM for breakfast after being in frig. all night. Both were yummy! I used milk choc. chips too!

Rating: 4
Lovely little cakey things! Add vanilla, use brown sugar instead of white, 3 bananas instead of two, and jumbo milk chocolate chips (I think the semi-sweet _would_ be overpowering, but definitely try the milk). Moist as anything--great warm and then the next morning, stored covered at room temp. overnight. Mine were done after just 23 minutes. To get more attractive muffins, fill the cups up higher and only make eight--then they have nice rounded tops. Alternatively, make mini-muffins--super!

I've made this over and over again. Very easy, very popular, especially with children, husbands, and anyone with a sweet tooth. True, it doesn't have a COMPLEX flavour, but you don't always want complex.

Made these to bring to work one morning along with another kind of muffin. I loved these. Very moist, very banana-e, and very easy. They were the first ones to go. I've already bought more bananas to make them again.

I've made these a bunch, and I am a fan. They're easy, quick, and a great way to use up overripe bananas. They are really sweet, though, and have to be balanced out with something like coffee or milk. I do get rave reviews about them, however.

I agree with the last critic. Not a bad recipe, but not too terribly great, either. I added an extra banana and still the muffin lacked depth of flavor.

This was a good recipe. I found that you can decrease the sugar and use more bananas for extra flavour. My mistake in this recipe was using too much butter. Although I will try it again, I believe there to be better banana-chocolate chip recipes out there.

These are not muffins. They are cupcakes. Sweet enough for a birthday party. I added cinnamon and vanilla, and used only 5 T of butter and 1/2 cup of choc. chips. also added a blob of sour cream. Very good (for dessert).

These would have been better if they came out light. They are very dense. Flavour wasn't that great, the chocolate overpowers and doesn't mesh well with the banana.

These muffins are incredibly easy to make. The key is to not over-mix the batter and check the muffins a little earlier than 32 minutes---I only baked them for 28 minutes. Delicious when still warm...very moist and light in texture!

I've never tried this recipe with the bananas since I'm not a fan of banana muffins; however, I've made six batches of these muffins with canned pumpkin pie puree. One 15 oz. can was used to make two batches. I increased the milk by about 1 1/2 tablespoons. It works wonderfully. This is very kid-friendly, both for making and for eating. I made these with the children in my son's first-grade class for Valentine's Day breakfast. We also made two batches for my daughter's class. There were no leftovers. We gave them to our neighbors as a Valentine, and everyone called to tell us how yummy they were. It is definitely a sweet muffin with all the chocolate.

These were quickly devoured by all and highly approved of by one very picky male teenager. I liked them too and am making them again. My own version included soy milk, a butter substitute and chocolate chip mini morsels.

Holey moley! This sure was SWEET! You need to have it with a cuppa coffee or something. Don't get me wrong: It's good and I liked it but is definitely a recipe for kids. I took it to my neighbors, and warned them that it was sweet. The husband said, "Not a problem!" and it was gone in 2 bites.

I've been making this recipe for about 6 months now and my family LOVES it! We prefer it in a loaf form which increases the baking time to about 1 hour. Delicious and very moist. Now my husband leaves the bananas in the fruit bowl to become over-ripe, hoping I'll treat him to another banana bread warm from the oven.

My 3 kids and my husband love these muffins. I've been making them for a year now and nobody gets sick of them. (they're great for breakfast on the go or an afternoon snack!) Try making them with the mini semi sweet chocolate chips. That's the way we like them best!

I agree with the Cook from Exeter, NH. These muffins were tasty, but I found them to be quite heavy. Also I do like muffins to be quite large and these just did not rise much. Having said that, my daughter said they were beautful, but my son was not so complimentary. I think I will stick with my original Banana Muffin Recipe

My husband and I loved these muffins!! They were moist and light although I confess I only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips - I think any more than this would have been overkill. I loved too that they were so easy and quick to make - great if you have friends coming over for coffee.

This is wonderful - moist and tasty! Try replacing the banana with an equivalent amount of pumpkin puree and add your own personal pumpkin pie spice mixture. Pumpkin and chocolate, I know, sounds absolutely horrible, but trust me - it's fantastic.

These were tasty but slightly heavy. I liked the combination of chocolate chips with the bananas. Would probably also make a good banana muffin by eliminating the chocolate chips.

YUM! These muffins are great! I used 3 average sized bananas (I did not measure--just added) and a whole bag of mini chocolate chips. I loved'em but my fiance said there was too much chocolate. He is the only one I've ever known to have such a complaint! I'll make them again but to be fair will cut back on the chocolate.

I think this recipe is great. Every time I make them, my boys, 5yrs & 3yrs,go crazy for them, not to mention my husband and myself! I even e-mailed it to my mother.

A diffrent spin on banana nut muffins. The flavor reminded me of my younger days, as a girl scout, we would wedge chunks of chocolate bars into a partially peeled banana. Wrap the banana in foil and put it on the warm coals of a camp fire to melt the chocolate. Yummy! I added a nut crumble mixture to the top of a few of these muffins, and it only made them taste better. I will make these again and try peanut butter chips next time.

These are a cinch to make and SOOO wonderful. I used three VERY RIPE bananas, then cut the sugar a little. Also I had buttermilk on hand so I substituted that for the milk, and threw in a little vanilla, and I used mini chocolate chips. I baked them in a convection oven and it took only 20 minutes, rotating half way through. My kids flipped out over them!

I have been making this dessert from the time I got this issue in the mail!! I wouldn't change a thing except that I prefer this recipe in the form of a bread, which increases the time to about an hour in the oven. Enjoy this to get rid of your over-ripe bananas sitting around!

Mmmm....Ran out of blueberries, so we couldnt make our ususal muffins for this morning's guests. This recipe seemed interesting and we had all the ingredients on hand. We used 3 bananas, half the amount of butter and substituted coconut milk for the milk, as was suggested by the Cook from Glastonbury. Dropping the whole peeled bananas into the Cuisinart along with the liquid ingredients speeded the procedure. We also mixed white chocolate chips in with the chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup whole macadamia nuts, 1/2 cup diced orange and a big pinch of nutmeg. These muffins were even liked by the "cooked banana" hater, moist and full of surprises. You can bet that our weekend guests will also be treated to these!!

Very good recipe..I made a few changes..I used half the amount of butter, coconut milk for the regular milk, Splenda(a sugar substitute),3 large ripe bananas and not as many chocolate chips. They turned out very well, nice and moist. Definitely will make again.

My husband loved these muffins but I thought they were a little dry and could have used more bananas. Next time I will double the amount of bananas and half the amount of chocolate chips since I found that they were overpowering the bananas. I also used skim mild and they were just fine but I will try buttermilk next time. I always have some buttlermilk in my freezer just for my recipes.

This is a great recipe for using up soft bananas(2 1/2 - 3). It is quick, easy and the muffins are moist and delicious. I usually use skim milk in mine and have found no difference in quality, but will try buttermilk after reading the other suggestions. I love chocolate so I wouldn't cut back on the chips. They make good hostess gifts and keep well. I make these at least once a week and everyone who has tried one loves them.

These were pretty good. I didn't quite have enough bananas for a full 1 cup, so I made up the difference with sour cream. The muffins were plenty moist, but the outsides came out kind of tough. I think next time I'll just add bananas and chocolate chips to a good basic muffin batter that I have. It seems to yield better results.

This recipe is good..however, I use 3 large bananas versus the 2 the recipe calls for. Also, I used mini chocolate chips - If you do, do not put in the amount called for - I will use probably about 2/3 of a cup of chips. The amount called for in the recipe was too overwhelming for the banana.

My family loves these muffins, especially my husband. They are moist, flavorful and easy to make; a great way to use overripe bananas. However, they are definitely a same-day treat; they don't taste nearly as good the second day. However, mine rarely last that long.

Wonderful! I went with the advice of some of the other cooks and used buttermilk rather than whole milk, added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, cut down on the chocolate chips (1/2 cup as well)and I also sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking. I realized too late that I only had milk chocolate chips to use and was afraid that it may be too sweet but they turned out great. Next time I will definately try the miniature chips. I plan to make these quite often this next winter for a quick breakfast/brunch with a hot drink before I head out into the cold. Make plenty, they disappear very quickly!

I just got done making this recipe and wanted to comment. Your taste buds would have to be deadened by fifty years of smoking to think this was bland -- these muffins are rich and delicious. Three medium, overripe bananas yielded just under one cup of mashed bananas. I added 1 t. of vanilla and sprinkled the tops with sugar, per another user, and used 1/8 c. heavy cream and 1/8 c. milk instead of just milk. I also took the advice of other users and used just 1/2 c. of chips, which was just right. A great dessert muffin!

I converted this recipe to make 6 large muffins (1 cup size), increasing recipe by 1/2, except for the chips, taking the advice of previous reviewers.I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla to downplay the banana flavor and substituted buttermilk for the milk. I filled muffin cups full and sprinkled tops with sugar for a nicer looking muffin. I also used paper muffin cups sprayed lightly with Pam for easier removal of paper. They turned out great and are a popular item at a coffee shop I bake for.

This is definitely a dessert muffin. Very rich and sweet - a bit too sweet actually. I needed 21/2 bananas to get to the 1 cup - I would not want any more banana flavor than that. And next time I will only use 1/2 cup of chips- they overpowered the muffins.

As suggested by one reviewer I used 3 large bananas. I also used lo-fat evaporated milk as I have found that it makes for moister muffins. I had also started the muffins before I discovered that I did not have a complete stick of butter so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 I Can't Believe Its Not Butter. The finished product was so very moist and rich with chocolate. The muffins were much more banana flavored that I thought they would be and were even better the next day. My husband is not a big fan of chocolate, he can take it or leave it, and he said these were some of the best muffins ever. They were quick and easy to prepare so I will be cooking this recipe again.
