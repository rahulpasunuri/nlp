I had the pleasure of serving this exceptional dish when I worked for Kasper Donnier. The definitive steamed mussel recipe in my opinion.

this is so easy and so good, it will become a staple, next time i will add coconut milk and probalby a bit more curry just to see how it is.

I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and it was awesome!!! I'll make this again and again - and have lots of crusty bread on hand for dipping!

This is a great recipe! I recently had something similar at "Butterfly" in San Francisco. I took the advice of another reviewer and changed the heavy cream. I could not find half and half premade, so I just used half heavy cream and half skim milk. It made the sauce much lighter. I also doubled the curry to give it a little kick. Do use a DRY white wine. I used a Sauvignon Blanc (don't know my wines well, and that was all I had) and everyone thought it was sweet and asked how much sugar was in it. Other than that, everyone loved it!

I added a bit of creamed coconut and doubled the curry and it was VERY tasty, my SO loved it and proclaimed it to be his favourite mussel dish.

I may have used the wrong wine for this, but the sauce didn't turn as smooth as I thought it would be, I had just imagined it to be a bit different. It's not bad, but I've had better.

This recipe was the best mussel dish I have had . I substituted half and half for the cream to make it somewhat low fat. Great with bread for dipping or you can thicken sauce a little and service with pasta.

Very good summer dish with crusty bread and a light salad. Have served it half a dozen times and every time the guests have found the empty pot in the kitchen and mopped every last drop out.
