Not one to vary ingredients, I found myself on a Sunday afternoon with 1/4 lb. of wild mushrooms (Christmas present), no creme fraiche, and no heavy cream - but just decided to wing it. With half-and-half. It just needed 10 minutes more in the oven to set. I do a lot of baking and found this to be is an exceptionally easy and well-behaved tart crust. I didn't bother chilling it - saved time and it didn't shrink. Delicious!

Quite delicious in a sneaks up on you way. I used the dough recipe for the asparagus custard tart on this website as I make a lot of quiche from scratch and have never understood the value in baking the crust first. So let me start there--the crust was fantastic--flaky--even days later. The mushroom mix was not as exciting as I'd hoped. I even threw in some fresh sage leaves, but I still found it a little boring. I think I was trying to channel a tart I'd recently had at a restaurant that had different ingredients. It was even better the next day, I must admit--and it was also my first time baking with creme fraiche, so I didn't know what to expect. All in all, a good experience between the two recipes--just need more spices or perhaps onion--chives?

This was delicious. I made it three times, twice with creme fraiche and once with the creme from whole milk yogurt, both worked great. Second time I made this with fresh ramps and oyster mushrooms from the farmers market. Third time i sprinkled a small amount of gruyere on top. I made my own pastry and used a metal tart pan, not a glass pie pan for a crisper bite to the pastry.

Used all wild mushrooms - delicious.

I have made this twice and both times it was excellent. The last time I couldn't find creme fraiche so I substituted a 1/2 cup of heavy cream and stirred in 1/2 TBSP sour cream. I set it out on the counter for a couple of hours and it worked great. Also, I threw in a handfull of reconstituted dried porcini and when the mushrooms were about done I added 1/2 the STRAINED soaking liquid and cooked until absorbed. This nicely intensifed and deepened the mushroom flavor.

Totally worth the time to prepare. I made the crust the night before and wrapped it tight to finish the next day. It was a big hit.

This was just okay. Kind of a gross texture, I thought. I wouldn't make it again. Try the zucchini and sundried tomato tart from this site. It's really tasty.

Find the Creme Fraiche to make this is worth the effort. Served it to some French guests and they just ate it all up. We were 3 and had little left over as a main course serving

It's a great recipe when done right to the letter, but I needed a variation recently. I had a guest with a serious gluten intolerance, so I made a crispy potato crust from organic frozen hash browns. I cooked them in a bit of oil but did not get them all the way brown. They were just starting to get golden, but still malleable, when I set them aside. When they were cool enough to handle, I patted them into a deep ceramic pie dish. The potatoes clung to the sides nicely and squished together to form a crust. It kept well overnight in the fridge. Because I was using a deeper dish, I added more shrooms but left the custard part of the recipe intact. I baked it about 40 minutes, and the potato crust got perfectly browned and tasted great with the other ingredients. It was very popular and got raves from all the guest.

My first attempt at pastry dough...not too bad. The final dish was impressive to look at and it really was fairly easy to make. Delicious.

If you double click on the words "Pastry Dough" you will find the recipe for the crust.

Question: Isn't there a step missing? How do you make the crust? It seems most used a frozen pie shell (one did use her own pie crust recipe). I'm curious about how to incorporate the shallots? Do you pre-cook the shallots or are they fresh cut?

Really terrific. Unusual flavors. I agree it is very rich and small, small slivers are best for any occasion.

Just wonderful. I was in a hurry and used the Marie Callendar frozen pastry crust all ready in the pan. This dish is now requested whenever I am invited to a get together.

Delicious recipe! I made it with a frozen pie shell and wild mushrooms; wood ears,trumpets,crimini, chanterelles. I served it as side dish with Thanksgiving dinner, but i would serve it again as an appetizer or hors d'oevre. It was VERY rich and you only need to serve small slices.

This was a big hit with my dinner guests!... I used whole wheat pastry flour for the crust (using my own piecrust recipe) and it was a wonderful rustic crust, perfect accompaniment to the mushrooms.

Served this as an appetizer for a party and it got rave reviews. Made it again for family who also loved it, even our 4 year old granddaughter.

an easy weeknight dinner if made with a frozen pie shell. I didn't have creme fraiche on hand so I added a bit more cream and grated gruyere cheese.

I blind baked a tart shell and used crimini and white mushrooms. It was very very good. I like that texture was not like a quiche. Not a crumb leftover.

I have made this several times now with several differnt crusts and find that frozen pie shells work just fine. The last time I made several as a first course for a dinner party and added a little gruyere to the custard mix and cut back on the cream a tad. It provided a nice little extra flavor without being too much like quiche and was easily one of the most popular dishes I served.

I didn't have enough fresh mushrooms so I used dried as well. Even with soaking that wasn't a good idea, they just don't have the tender texture of fresh. But the flavors are wonderful, and I will make it with all fresh 'shrooms next time!

I used a frozen pie shell, two whole eggs, and chanterelle, wood ear and shitaki mushrooms. I left out the thyme, which was probably a mistake. It was a nice dish, and simple enough to make on a weeknight, but nothing spectacular.

I used a premade pie crust baked in a tart pan according to package directions and added some shredded gruyere cheese to the top of the tart when I took the tart out of the oven. Delicious and easy.

I made this with a whole wheat tart crust. The rustic quality of the whole wheat crust really contrasts with the rich filing and the gamey mushrooms. I used chantrelles, oyster mushrooms, and shitake mushrooms. The creme fraiche-based custard is so simple and would be great with many different type of savory tarts.

I am NOT rating this recipe; only assuring HUDSONCOOK that the number of fork ratings does not go into the ratio for the number of people who would make this recipe again. Epicurious determines how many people would make the recipe again by using the answers to the question "Would you make this dish again?" The user then marks a radio button for "yes" or "no". Rest easy - they have the calculations correctly. We just cannot see who voted "yes" and who voted "no". But in this case, you can guess because 67% of three voters is two people. The one with the lowest number of forks is probably the person who voted to not make the recipe again.

I too used a frozen puff pastry sheet for the crust. Mushroom lovers will definitely enjoy this dish. That said, I really must comment that your new recipe is pretty awful. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Also if two reviewers give the recipe 3 and 4 forks, that doesn't mean that only 50% would make it again, especially when on another page two reviewers giving 3 forks each = 100%. Please go back to your "eye friendly" format

Instead of pastry dough, I rolled out some leftover frozen puff pastry dough (very thin) and it worked great. Delicious recipe, great main course for vegetarian friends.

This was a rich, flavorful starter for a fall dinner. I used frozen pie shells and they worked great. Put a little more thyme in if you want a fuller flavor and a nice "pinch" of black pepper. Terrific!
