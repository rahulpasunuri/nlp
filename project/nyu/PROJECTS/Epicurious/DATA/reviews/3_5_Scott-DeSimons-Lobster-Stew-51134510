Excellent stew - loved the rich but delicate flavor. The three cups of water is plenty to steam the lobsters and to respond to another review, not everyone in New England BOILS their lobsters; some prefer to steam them and not have so much water to drain (which I feel dilutes the flavor anyway.)

Question. Do they really mean three cups of water to cook two lobsters? I have always immersed them in water as they do along the New England coast.

Reads very closely to one I have and it is delicious. I will make this one again. I have often wondered if using crab or shrimp would produce a stew as good?

I will make this again. This turned out fantastic. I disagree with a previous review....5 minutes was just fine for cooking the lobster. The lobster should not be fully cooked. I let the shells cool more than suggested before taking the meat out. I used two tablespoons of brandy and might even add a bit ore next time. Definitely worth letting it set overnight. I had made it 7ish on the 23rd and we had it for Christmas Eve dinner. My guests and I were looking for more...next time I will double it!

Too much cream and light on everything but cream and butter. Would have been better off serving the lobster boiled with butter...

Wonderful Christmas Eve dinner. Served with crusty bread for mopping up the very flavorful broth. It was worth every minute of preparation.

Absolutely delicious and deceptively complex flavor from that lobster shell broth. Pure lobster goodness, and rich but not too rich. Really elegant recipe, and I served it as a main course with corn bread and an herb salad. I doubled the recipe and the proportions worked out beautifully for my 9 guests. I will say that the lobsters were still moving (sorry guys!) after 5 minutes, so I ended up steaming mine closer to 10 mins total. That may be because I have 4 lobsters in the pot and not the two called for in the recipe, but my guess is even two will need longer than 5 mins cooking time. I would not add any salt, because the stock is plenty salty naturally. I did, however, add a bit of lemon zest (half a lemon's worth) to cut the richness from the half and half and lobster. Delicious, all my guests loved it and I'd definitely make it again
