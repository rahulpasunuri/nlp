I made 2 batches of this recipe for Thanksgiving: 1 as written, and a "Mexican" version where I added a small can of roasted hot peppers and a good amount of shredded Mexican blend cheese instead of the raisins, cranberries, and fennel. Both were great, although I think the Mexican version was better (people certainly ate it up more quickly). Fabulous as leftovers too, for post-Thanksgiving breakfast.

I've been making this recipe for 5 years or so now. I always follow the recipe exactly except that I make muffin or mini muffins out of it. We eat them as snacks anytime or I serve them with brunch. Everyone always loves them - they're addictive. Personally I would not serve them with dinner as they are sweet. If I want to make a savory cornbread, I use another recipe.

Good, and pretty with the red cranberries in it. The modifications I made were, I used only 1 stick of butter and browned it in a cast iron pan, used NF Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk, cut the fennel to 1.5 tsp (although I think I could have tolerated more fennel) and used AP gluten free flour. I baked the bread in the cast iron pan for 30 minutes. It turned out pretty good, although I think I would cut the flour ratio back a bit as it was a very stiff batter. I think the cook who added a bit of orange zest or juice was spot on. That would add another dimension of flavor.

Easy, quick, flavorful, and moist. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit. Served it w/Northern Bean soup w/sausage and kale.

Good, but I am not a fennel fan and the combination just din't go over the top for me.

Delicious! Love the wonderful combination of flavors. The fennel is a must -- gives the cornbread a special kick. Don't worry if you don't have a true mortar and pestle. I used a thick glass olive oil bottle and tried my best to crush the fennel seeds...then just gave up and tossed them in as-is. All worked just fine. Fabulous taste and a very easy recipe. Also used a muffin pan and muffin cups (12 -- using the 25-min bake time), no butter in separate pans, and poured the rest of the batter in a separate Corning dish (using the 35-min bake time).

Delicious. Easy. I made it without with fennel, rainsins and cranberries and it was still very good and moist thanks to the buttermilk. I would probably use a little less sugar next time and include cheese and jalapenos depending on the occassion.

Cornbread was very moist and great served with warm butter. A keeper for me. Not everyone likes fennel, but most people at our gathering enjoyed this.

Amazing! Was concerned that this would be too sweet for a savory crowd, but they loved it! Doubled the recipe and baked in two 8X8 pans. Very yummy for breakfast the next day! I wouldn't change a thing...

This recipe is fabulous! I made it for the first time with some vegetarian chili and wow!!! A definite crowd pleaser - everyone loved it and wanted more. This is a keeper! Only comment - make sure to use small containers (2 loaf pans or 2 mini loaf pans) to keep depth low - as it is very moist and takes a while to cook if you try to make it in one loaf pan like I did.

Got rave reviews from everyone at work. Made them in mini-muffin tins and didn't change anything about the recipe. Agreed they are a bit buttery but nobody seemed to mind. I found them too sweet to eat like normal cornbread, they're more like dessert. Definitely a keeper!

Cut recipe in half and baked 9 muffins. They were a bit flat, so I think I was stretching it too thin. I'd guess the previous reviewer who made 12 muffins out of the full recipe was estimating better. Maybe this error contributed, but I also found them a bit too oily and yet dry, as others have. That said, these were very popular and had a lot of interesting good flavors for corn bread pieces.

Thought this recipe was good. I did incorporate some of the changes which others had mentioned. I only used one stick of butter. I did pan roast the fennel seeds on the range for about 10 minutes, shaking the pan every 3-4 minutes. Then I used the mortar/pestle, this seemed to work fine. I would significantly cut back on the fennel from 1 1/2 T to about 1/2 t.

Great stuff! I've made it several times and always get rave reviews. Never have added the raisins. I don't think they're necessary and might be overkill.

Rating: 3
I was completely wowed by the combination of flavors - and a bit overwhelmed by how sweet it was. It was also a bit heavy from the butter. Next time I might try 1/4 c. of sugar and less butter. It really eats like cake - my 4 year old son kept asking for more.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe. I made them as muffins. I filled 17 muffin cups with the batter. They were delicious. I had my reservations about the fennel but it was that flavor which made the muffin into the exotic little thing that it was. I made them exactly like the recipe said. Didn't change a thing. I used my Vita-Mix to grind up the fennel seeds with a little of the flour and cornmeal since I don't have a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder. I tried using my food processor but that was useless. The Vita-Mix ground the seeds very fine. These were absolutely delicious.

These were great, even as muffins. I added a bit of orange zest thanks to a previous review and believe that helped the flavor out. Next time, I might add some orange juice instead of buttermilk. Even lacking raisins (only had fennel seeds and cranberries on hand), these muffins were great...definitely for fennel fans.

I love this recipe! You'll have to adjust fennel to taste. The current amount is for huge fennel fans. The recipe is pretty foolproof, and makes great muffins too! Also makes GREAT turkey stuffing! Just use it for any stuffing recipe that calls for corn bread. Disregard the negative review. People who mess up recipes shouldn't take it out on the recipe.

Way too much butter!! But other than that, it's a very good bread. I added a little orange zest and replaced 1/2 cup of the butter milk with oj. I'll definately make it again but I'll cut back on the butter.

Simply the best corn bread ever. Sweet and very moist. Flavors blend will.

This was great, but be careful adjusting cooking times! I tried to make this in one large loafpan instead of the mini-pans, and I nearly served it uncooked in the middle. But good nonetheless.

Excellent, between a bread and a dessert, very flexible; we all enjoyed it with Thanksgiving dinner, and also delicious for breakfast the next morning.

I make this every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas and use it in my dressing in lieu of regular cornbread or Stouffer's cornbread stuffing, added to my mother's tried and true 1950's dressing recipe of Stouffer's herbed bread crumb stuffing mix, cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, melted butter,onion and celery (true confession). It gave this old classic a whole new lease on life and now I'm passing this variation on to the next generation of cooks in my family. It makes the dressing fluffy and colorful. I also make it in a regular loaf pan. It keeps in the refrigerator for a couple of days and is very moist.

this waw a superior side dish. because i doubled the recipe, i used 2 metsl pans, an aluminum disposable and lesser quality tin pan. the 2 metal pans has a wonderful browned bottom/edge. the other 2 loafs were more cakelike. i think the metal pans yielded the desired outcome and might account for why other reviewers felt the corn bread was greasy.

So far (touch wood) every recipe I tried is successful. This corn bread is different and delicious. And I am new to baking.

This was such a hit with the relatives when I made it from the magazine, that they hand-copied it after dinner. It was a little too buttery, but in gereal, like some fabulous fruitcake or poundcake type of corn bread. This is the only holiday corn bread in our house. The rest of the year, we use the recipe on the box!

Wonderful twist on an old favourite. Made this to go with Mom's Christmas ham, sweet potatoes & squash casserole and it received rave reviews. To the cook from San Mateo, you're right about the fennel seeds; even crushing them with a mortar & pestle is a pain, but makes a HUGE difference in the flavour. I didn't bother to chop the Craisins & raisins, just added them whole. The only thing I didn't like about the recipe was actually my fault. I used the "instant" buttermilk granules and they didn't quite dissolve, so there were a few little white spots in the bread. But it was moist, not greasy and totally delicious. My husband fought for the leftovers to take back home. Definitely a keeper.

I baked this in muffin tins. They were surely greasy, like there is too much butter. My husband complained that they were dry, maybe too much egg.

WOW! This is THE best corn bread I have ever had, which is saying alot because I am a huge corn bread fan. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a total hit, so intersting! It really is imperative to grind up the fennel seed so it releases the flavor, I used a QuickChop because I didn't have a mortar and pestle...Do yourself a favor and try this!

This has become our standard corn bread to accompany soups and such. The flavor is excellent, and contrary to other reviewers, it is not oily even with the amount of butter. We use a 9" round or square pan instead of mini loafs.

I agree with the cook from San Mateo. Nice texture, but a little too buttery and not quite enough flavor for my tastes.

Rating: 3
Yum! I made them in 12 muffin cups. The texture was moist and cohesive, not dry or crumbly at all. If I had to be picky, though, I'd say this was somewhat too buttery and needed somewhat more flavor and substance (e.g. raisins and cranberries). Crushing fennel seeds without special equipment is ineffective, so I'm guessing that was the reason there wasn't much fennel flavor in the corn bread I made :(

excellent and unlike most corn breads not at all dry ( and I made it on uesday and served it on Thanksgiving) didn't fall apart when cut, everyone wanted the recipe. I had to make it in bread loaf tins I couldn't find the minature tins anywhere but I don';t think it made any difference.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2001. Because I can't digest dairy food, I used rice milk with a little vinegar instead of the buttermilk and margarine (horrors!) instead of the butter. I baked the bread in a muffin tin with big cups. I also used these delicious organic yellow raisins, I know that helped! It went over so well that after dinner I returned to the website to print out the recipe for my relatives.
