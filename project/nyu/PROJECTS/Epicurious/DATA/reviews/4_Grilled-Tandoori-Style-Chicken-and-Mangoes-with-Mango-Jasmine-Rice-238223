I made this for a dinner party for 8 adults and a whole pack of kids. Very well recovered by all! I used boneless, skinless breasts for ease marinated for about 2 hours. I reserved a small bowl of the yogurt marinade as mentioned by previous reviewers to drizzle over the chicken at serving - fabulous! Used brown basmati, did not add the pine nuts, but loved it with the mango and herbs! Will make again!

I've been making this for years now and just love it. It is one of our week night go to meals when organic chicken thighs are on sale! I often do it in the oven when grilling isn't feasible. We love quinoa and actually use now quinoa instead of rice and its just wonderful!

Great dish. I didn't have any cilantro so I increased the amount of cumin, increased the garlic and parsley, and lessened the paprika. Even with those changes, it was still wonderfully flavorful. Definitely save some of the yogurt marinade to drizzle over the meal once done!

Loved this recipe. The marinate for the chicken has wonderful flavor and the rice was a big hit too. loved the crunch of the pinenuts and the sweetness of the mango in it. I used regular rice but still definite winner!

Haven't tried the chicken yet, but the rice is amazing and has become my go-to rice recipe whenever I make simple grilled chicken or fish. Hint: if you put the mangos only in the portion that you plan to serve, the rice refriges & re-heats nicely - you can add the mangos at that point.

Hubby loved the rice with mango. I didn't. Everyone loved the chicken. We used charcoal (we always do for chicken)and chicken thighs which I slashed and marinated for the day. Best chicken thighs I've ever had.

Very tender and tasty. Made as per recipe, but baked it in the oven with a generous amount of the marinade in the pan for about 30 mins @ 350, and then turned it up to 400 for about 20 mins. It browned nicely. I marinated it for just over an hour, will probably marinate longer next time. Good flavour, but a little too subtle. I will double up on the Cayenne the next time, as it needs a little more heat. The rice is super tasty!

Very good. The chicken was extremely tender. I like a little more kick, so I would go for some of the suggestions of other reviewers on how to notch up the flavor even a bit more, but it was very good. I would also, as one reviewer suggested, make a little extra of the yogurt sauce to serve on the side. Served with saffron rice. Delicious.

Easy and delicious. Used Basmati rice and skinless chicken breasts instead. Also increased amount of spices. My husband loved it!

I made this in a half portion as it is only my bf and I...but I wish I had made it all. Omitted pine nuts (don't care for them) and next time I would marinade it longer and make more "dressing". This is a perfect dish for someone who is a little foreign to Indian food-I don't consider myself a "fan" of the cuisine but this is a very refreshing dish. I used the frozen Basmati Rice from Trader Joes and it came out perfectly.

We loved this recipe. It was fast and flavorful. I marinaded the chicken six hours before and it turned out great. I didn't have pine nuts for the rice (which I made with brown rice) but it was delicious without them. The only thing I will do differently next time will be to offer fresh mango on the side rather than grilled mango. The mango lost something in the grilling - texture and some flavor.

Other than not using olive oil, jasmine rice (used brown rice) and pine nuts (did not have on hand), I followed the recipe as is. This was very good. The best Tandoori-style chicken so far.

I made this for a dinner party. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs to cut down fat content and was out of gas on the grill so had to pan saute the chicken and threw the mango in, was DELICIOUS! I encourage all to make this recipe. It's unique and impressive.

I made this for a large crowd of children and adults and everyone loved it. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours in soy plain yogurt instead of the regular and it was extremely tender. I served it with veggie curry, lots of indian condiments( mango, cashews, soy raita, tomato chutney) and store bought naan. Great barbeque food!

I am a vegetarian so I substitued the chicken with tofu and marinated it 24 hours in advance. What a wonderful meal. The flavor is very mediterranean. Go easy on the lemon juice though. Very easy to make especially if you do your prep work ahead of time. The only thing I couldn't make in advance was the rice.

I got rave reviews from a small dinner party I made it for with my neighbors. I didn't add the pine nuts and I added more coriander because I love the flavor :)

awesome! let it marinate for 24 hours. Really great flavor. wouldn't recommend turnning every 15 it rips the skin off. It takes closer to 45 minutes to cook on medium.

great and easy recipe to make. for 2 people I marinate 4 skinless, boneless breasts for 6+ hours and make less rice. I don't reduce anything in the recipe as this needs all the spice plus more. all the ingredients are essential, don't leave anything out! i broil in the oven as i sadly no longer have a grill.

Maybe I did something wrong but I thought the chicken was really bland. Couldn't even taste the sauce at all. Maybe in needs to sit for longer than 1 hr in the refrigerator.

Delicious. I marinated skinless chicken (breasts and thighs) for 8 hours. Next time I would use less salt in the marinade. It tasted really salty the next day but was otherwise delicious. I served the chicken with add'l yogurt and the rice.

I give this recipe a major 4 star rating, dont skimp on any of the herbs and do make the rice exactly as directed, I have made this dish for many dinner parties, people love it. Bonus, if you can let the chicken marinate for 24 hours it literlly melts in your mouth!

This was an excellent recipe. I found the sauce to be delicious, flavorful and wondefully fresh tasting. In fact, it is better than the Tandoori I've had in restaurants. The grilled mango as an accompaniment is brilliant. The rice was good, but i wasn't doing back-flips over it. I will continue to look for a delicious indian style rice-pilaf with mango. The rice's flavor tasted a little muddled to me. Overall, fantastic recipe that you could easily serve to guests who appreciate exotic flavors!

Wow - I'm surprised at how different my experience was from most of the others. I made the recipe exactly as written but found that: a) most of the sauce went into the rice after I removed 1/4 cup; b) The marinade didn't really do much to the flavor of the chicken (after one hour); c) the sauce caused my grill to flair up repeatedly on medium heat, making it difficult to cook the chicken thoroughly; d) the rice was the best part, but I wouldn't say it was sensational given the amount of work. Still on the lookout for great Indian recipes...

Amazing!!! Can't wait to serve it to guests, I made it for my family and they loved it. I am now thinking about other dishes and wines that I could serve with this for a buffet party.

I've made this recipe 3 times and each time it gets better and better. This is one of the best meals I've ever made, so much flavour! So good I would have no hesitation serving this to guests. I accompanied it with steamed asparagus and it was really nice.

This marinade is the best. We have omitted the yogurt and used it on lamb and salmon. Great both times. Love the rice too.

Absolutely loved this dish! I reserved some of the marinade (before pouring it over the chicken) for dipping too and it was my favorite part. Will definitely make this again and will probably try it as Kabobs as one reviewer suggested next time.

This is an amazing recipe! Every time I served this everyone raved and wanted the recipe!! I doubled the sauce and poured it over the chicken. I also served this with a green salad with fresh fruit (mango slivers, strawberries, blueberries, kiwi) and green onions. I made a dressing with Good Seasons italian with rice wine vinegar and a mixture of sesame oil and vegetable oil. Everyone loved it!

This was fantastic! I used 4 chicken breasts and 2/3 of the marinade mixture (and had plenty spare). The first night I only had 45 mins to marinate and our mangos turned out to be over-ripe, so I used mango chutney which was very tasty. The next night (chicken had now been marinating overnight) we had fresh mango and it was amazing. The chicken on both nights was really tender and spicy without being too hot. Also served with naan bread and a dry riesling. Delicious!!

Due to a scheduling conflict, my chicken ended up marinating for 2 days...sure was tender! Was unable to use mangos, as both of them went "south" while waiting to grill,so substituted TJ's mango chutney, which was good, but I'm sure fresh would have been better and will use next time I do this. Really enjoyed the herb/spice mix in the rice...had basmati, not jasmine. Served with steamed sno peas and sauv blanc.

This was delicious. We used boneless, skinless chicken breast to keep the calories down and it was still good. The rice is fantastic, even our 14 month old loves the rice.

This is one of those recipes that will stay in my repertoire of favorites. Instead of grilling I broiled the chicken and instead of grilled mangoes I made a mango/cilantro sauce. I added raisins to the Jasmine Rice and the whole thing was to die for....

Definitely a dish that I will add to my repertoire! My kids are picky eaters so I used the mango mixture as a topping on the rice - still delicious.

Let's just start by saying that our 12- year old, who doesn't eat much when we go to an Indian restaurant, wanted to know when we could have this again! That said, I think next time we make this, I'll leave out the grilled mango. Our grates are a little too wide, so I wound up pan-frying them. This is an acceptable alternative, but nobody but me likes hot fruit in our house. Also, I will ramp up the heat a little with a bit more cayenne. Our chicken came out more like blackened chicken, but that was operator error, and was still moist and tasty below the skin. We might also try baking this. Kebabs would also be a good way to go. I suspect we will have this often, in different shapes and forms. Mmmmm!

Craveable dish!!! I only marinated for an hour and was pleased with the results. I substituted smoky paprika for sweet and used a nonfat Greek yogurt. I reserved some of the yogurt sauce prior to marinating to dip chicken into after grilling. I added scallions and cilantro into the rice and as tricky as it was to grill mango slices the layer of flavor it adds makes it all worth it. My husband and I decided that this is a WOW dish and will absolutely entertain with it.

I was really disappointed. After having Tandori chicken in Fiji, this was a poor recipe. Very Bland

This was outstanding! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into chunks. Marinated for a few hours, skewered them and grilled them. The chicken was so moist and flavorful - this is a new favorite!! Also, the grilled mango was great. I served this with Cilantro Coconut Rice, also from epicurious and the flavors worked very well together. Green beans on the side and key lime bars for dessert. Yum.

Excellent! I marinated for just an hour and the flavors were delicious and it was very moist. My only changes were to use 1/2 the chicken since there are only 2 of us...I still used the full marinade amount. I also used lemon yogurt and omitted the lemon juice. I didn't have Jasmine rice so I used boxed rice from Near East--with the Mangos. Delicious!

Exceptionally moist and flavorful. I did just the chicken, not the side dishes, using a 4 lb. pkg. of Trader Joe's "Pick of the Chicken". Cut the breast pieces in half, as they're huge compared to the drums and thighs. Marinated for about 5 hours, and basted once the first time we turned them over on the grill. Used goat milk yogurt, as that's what I had on hand. Served with a chopped Mexican salad (cilantro/lime/maple syrup vinaigrette) and some crusty Prairie Bread from Whole Foods. Excellent, and destined to be repeated often.

Great recipe. Omitted parsey and used one cup of cilantro and doubled the amount of yoghurt (2 cups of low fat Greek yoghurt). LIked having the extra sauce which helped keep leftovers moist. Also added cherry tomatoes to the rice - put them in the rice cooker to soften after the rice was cooked. Will most definately make this again.

I thought the marinade was great and like the other reviewers suggested it needs more than 1 hr. Using the marinade with boneless chicken kebabs might be easier. I also liked the grilled mangos but thought the mango rice was overkill.

I too marinated the chicken longer than 1 hour- about 4- and this dish was delicious. The yogurt sauce is wonderful, and cooking the jasmine rice with some of the herb mixture was lovely. I will definitely make this again. My husband loved it and we enjoyed the leftovers for lunch today!

I substituted the first few ingredients with chimichurri I made a few nights earlier. I mixed the chimichurri with cumin and yogurt and used chicken breasts, it turned out fabulous. It was a great way to utilize leftover chimichurri. Typically, I do not like chicken but it was moist and flavorful. Next time I might try with pork.

Let it marinade in the fridge at least overnight (24 hours is best) & add some garam masala powder or curry if you want a strong spice on it. Longer marinade definetly enhances the dish

Yummy mariande- but I think it needs more than 1 hour to really enhance the flavor. The chicken was moist ( I used breasts) and grilling is the way to go. My kids loved the grilled mangos.

I love to cook but hate to hunt down the perfect side dish, its all here, just add a glass of wine and you got yourself a meal! Easy to make, I did it with chicken legs/thighs and baked it at 350 for an hour.
