This sounded really good, but it ended up tasting really bad. It seemed to actually suck out the natural sweetness of the carrots.

I like this recipe on beets as well as carrots. We have a big garden so I like things that use a lot of vegetables

There are better carrot recipes in the world than this one. Not a keeper for me.

Not bad for a change, but I'd recommend either more honey or less mustard.

I thought this recipe was awful. The Dijon made the carrots bitter.

Easy to do and tasty but could use a little more zing. We'll experiment next time with chili powder or country dijon mustard.

This is a wonderful to makes these vegetables-and they're kid-friendly, too!
