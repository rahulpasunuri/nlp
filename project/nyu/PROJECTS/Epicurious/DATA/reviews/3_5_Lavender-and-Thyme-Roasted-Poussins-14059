Very simple. Would recommend upping the lavender and the thyme in the butter mixture. I kept fishing around in the sauce for more lavender. Very nice with roasted new potatoes and a crunchy baguette.

Just finished this one... I think I need to tweak the lavender amount a tad to ensure that it is more of an essence. Didn't have Sauternes so I used a cab instead and it worked just fine. Actually roasted the chickens over slices of pear which gave a nice sweet contrast to the lavender flavor. Served with risotto using the same butter recipe.

Just finished having this for dinner. Served over basil fettuccine and the white wine reduced sauce. Definatly a great, quick meal. I think the noodles took longer than the fish to cook...

Thoughly enjoyed this for our Christmas Eve dinner. Nice change from the standard fare. I would suggest using only the poussins, since they are more tender & delicate in taste & will allow the herbs to really flavor the young chickens. Substituted herbs de provence for lavender & used a french white dessert wine for the sauce. Basted them slightly with a little butter while cooking. Delicious!

We liked this. Very elegant. But, we were hoping for a stronger lavendar flavor. It could have been my fault, as I hadn't let my lavendar dry completely... But, it was very simple, with a lovely presentation.

I'd have given this 2.5 forks if I could. I thought it was good but not great. I expected more from the herbs--again, I thought they were good but not great (I'd never cooked with lavender, so I was expecting more). I made the Cornish hens, and the meat was moist and flavorful.

This was just OK. Cornish hens have little flavor, and I am often disappointed in them unless the recipe is really powerful. This just didn't cut it for me.

Easy, beautiful and impressive - worried this might taste like soap or potpourri but it was OMG amazing! Treasure Island carries Dean & Delucca spices incl. lavender (I think D&D has a website as well) As my guests have said - this is faaaaabulous!

This was outstanding ! Just superb, elegant and very easy. I made it for Passover, used large kosher cornish hens, and cut them in half to speed the baking. I followed the advice and basted the tops to improve the browning.

I substitued sage for the thyme, as my husband does not like it. The flavors were as fresh as spring. I gave the hens a rub of olive oil and roasted them on a "rack" of carrot, celery and onion pieces. Gave my drippings much more flavor. Made a gravy with them. Did not use the Sauternes this time, but will next. Served with sweet & regular potatos mashed together and added some grated grueyre.

Have made this several times and shared the recipe with friends - who have incorporated it into their repertoire. Always a hit - I use cornish hens - as I haven't been able to locate kosher Poussins.

Definitely baste the poussins. They look much nicer. My husband doesn't love chicken but I had to pry the bones away from him this time.

I sort of screwed this up in terms of when I put the butter on (don't ask) and it still turned out really well. I put butter under the skin AND on it, which I think worked out better. The birds came out a lovely golden brown and were very juicy and tender. The au jus was lovely and I did n't even need to skim it. I buy my lavender in the bulk section at Whole Foods market - you can buy only as much as you need, and it's inexpensive. I served this with rosemary mashed potatoes and the Asparagus and Wild Mushroom Fricassee from this site, and it was very aromatic and lovely. Perfect Provencale dinner!

What an amazing dish!! I made extra compound butter and basted the hens with that throughout the baking. When I prepared the ajus, I added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the sauce. I would make this again in a heart beat!

Very tasty. Lovely flavor, different. Everyone really enjoyed. I used Cornish hens. Brined them first. 3 cups kosher salt with 6 quarts water for 1 hour for 6 birds. Rinse and continue. Agree with the previous cook about the pale color, so I brushed melted butter before roasting. Also put lemon slice and thyme sprigs in the cavity. Ordered my lavender from www.purplehazelavender.com.

This dish was good (I'd give it probably 2.75 forks, but rounded up to three). The lavender, thyme, and lemon were a delightful combination and very different from our usual every day flavors. My single biggest issue with this dish is the way the hens (I used Cornish game hens) looked when they came out of the oven. The skin only browned where there was butter underneath, leaving the rest of the bird an unappetizing, pale color. I think that they would have benefitted from some butter, in addition to the lemon, on the outside of the skin.

This recipe was used by my son and his, then, fiance, just after their engagement was announced. Lavender is so much their favorite fragrance that they used it in favors at their wedding, purchasing four pounds of dried lavender to make them. Attached to the favors was this recipe. The aromas coming from the kitchen, I'm told, were stupendous. The recipe was then lost within the family and now that I've found it again, it's being sent to them. I suspect they'll be using it again for their third wedding anniversary. Thankyou. I know they just loved it and then the we lost the recipe.

This recipe was so easy!!!! And very good. The only thing I did differently was I skimped a little on the lavender. I wish now, that I had not, it would have had a more interesting flavor. I will make this dish again and plan on using all the lavender called for.
