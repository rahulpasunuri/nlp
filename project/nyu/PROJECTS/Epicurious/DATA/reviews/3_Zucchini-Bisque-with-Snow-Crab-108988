I am always tinkering with recipes, and this one was no exception. I used 3 med. zucchini, added one 14 oz. can chicken broth, 1 TB dried dill, 1 tsp salt, 1 6 oz. can crabmeat w/juice. Followed the cooking instructions with this mix. Boy, was that good! Taste is rich and it is a wonderful way to use up all those zucchini that you get in the back seat of your car when you leave it unlocked!

Very goood soup, especially if you are on a diet. It will fill you up with very little fat or carbs. I added more dill because I really like that flavor. My only complaint is that it came out a little too thick. Next time I will use more water or some type of fish broth/stock to thin it out.
