I was really disappointed with this recipe. I feel the flavors just did not come together--I was very aware I was eating bland turkey. The herbs, spices and onions just did not infuse the meat. The texture was really offputting. One more gripe--my husband complained it was one of the worst kitchen clean ups he's ever done (and I cook a lot of complex stuff!).

Not too complicated once you read the instructions thoroughly! My fussy eaters even enjoyed this. Allowing the meat base to cool before adding to phyllo pastry truly allows the flavours to merge. Even tastier (and hotter) the next day for lunch.

This is a great recipe. And, if you are not concerned about authenticity and want a quicker version of this goodness, take your turkey (or chicken or pidgeon or whathaveyou) and brown it with a liberal application of the spices. Mix in the raisins and serve this modified filling over a bed of couscous (with peas and pinenuts, if you prefer). This is a super fast, savory, aromatic meal that you can tweat to your fancy. It is no longer a b'stilla (or pie), but you can always save the pie version for when you have more time.

For those that do not know squab is a young pigeon about 4 weeks old. So this dish is authentic.

Hey Kathryn (see below)... ease up and realize that food is fun and just because a recipe isn't ENTIRELY authentic is no reason to bash it. Many people can't procure pigeon, let alnoe squab, and have to make adjustments. That's always been the basis of the the world's best cuisine (Royalty dined on peasant cuisine throughout history). You are quite lucky to have access to every ingredient imaginable! Hey, if one has access to pigeon, all the better. If not, adapt it to fit what you have... that's the beauty in culinary art! (now, off to find 'free range pigeon' ; )

Well, authenticity aside, we thought this pie was outstanding. I have had an excellent B'stilla pie before using chicken as a substitute, and have been looking for a recipe ever since. The filling is a wonderful mixture of savoury and sweet, with enough heat to give it a kick. The only thing we suggest is to cut back on the raisins by a smidgeon, and I also followed the high-fat modification suggested by another reviewer and added butter to each sheet of phyllo pastry. Also, I only had 3 eggs on hand, and I don't think it hurt the filling any. Well worth the effort, and well worth the try, in my opinion! Give it a go!!!

Actually, b'stilla is a Moroccan dish utilizing pigeon, not squab. Therefore, the entire dish is not authentic, and I wouldn't waste my time. True b'stilla (I have made it with cornish game hen) is just wonderful.

Ground turkey is kind of a needless shortcut given that the rest of the recipe is fairly complex. I *really* suggest roasting a bone-in breast of chicken and a couple of thighs, then pulling the meat off and using that instead. If your ras-al-hanout is good it shouldn't be bland...

I made this recipe with a high fat modification for 2 separate dinners and received rave reviews both times. Instead of 4 sheets of filo I used about 12 and I brushed each sheet with butter. I didn't change the filling, but I used my own chicken broth and it has much more flavour than a canned or instant broth.

So-so recipe. Lacking in flavor and poor texture. Not worth the work.
