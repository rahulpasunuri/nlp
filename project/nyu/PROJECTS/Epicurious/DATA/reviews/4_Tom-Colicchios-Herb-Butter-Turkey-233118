Made gravy only. Made base the day b/f with giblets. Degreased pan juices b/f adding. By mistake only used 2T flour instead of 1/4C, so it was thin, but that was fine. The flavor was exceptional and everyone loved it.

Wow. Another first timer with the big bird! Scrumptious, raves, and will do it again!!

Can't say I followed the recipe to a tee, but the results were amazing. I bought a free range, organic turkey. Brined with a 2 gallon water, 1 cup salt 1/4 cup sugar with some herbs, carrot, and celery mixture for about 18 hours. Used the butter/herb mixture under the skin and outside the turkey. I made a different gravy, but what was so delicious was the flavor of the turkey and how moist it was. Had to be the brine/butter combination and the herbs in the cavity. Will do this again and again. Wonderful results!

The gravy is SO GOOD! The turkey is also good, I did add some lemons and apples to the inside of the turkey. I also had to watch closely to keep pouring on broth and basting to keep the bird moist.

not sure what i did wrong... I thought I followed the directions perfectly. It looked fantastic but was bland. The turkey was 22lbs so I doubled the recipe and still found it flavorless. The white meat was okay but a little dry for my liking and the gravy had no flavor. I must have done something wrong. any suggestions?

This is the whole package - yum! I followed the recipe with the only difference is that I brine my turkey too. The gravy? OMG and I am so glad that it made alot - plenty to give to guests. Best turkey and gravy ever!

First year I use this recipe and the first time it came out so good. Nobody stopped raving about the juiciness and taste of the bird. I followed the recipe, but did what one reviewer suggested, and roasted breast side down until the final 30 minutes. Also, I added the gravy 1/4 cup white wine, crushed garlic, and one tablespoon tomato puree and soy sauce.

The gravy is the best. It is my new favorite gravy recipe. We had 25 people and 2 turkeys, so one batch of gravy wasn't enough, but a double batch would have been a lot, but could have been used for hot turkey sandwiches later.

Brilliant. Best turkey ever, by far. I'll make this again and again. I agree with what a lot of people have said; the gravy recipe as listed would have made tons. I cut it in half (or less) and it still made plenty... for a family of four, at least.

This is my go-to recipe for years now. The gravy recipe is the best! All of the fresh herbs really make the turkey flavor so rich.

This will be my third Thanksgiving using this recipe. There is no going back. I roast the turkey with the breast facing down for all but the last 45 minutes, so the breast meat essentially poaches in herb butter and turkey juice. Moist without the hassle of brining. Love it!

I made this turkey recipe last Thanksgiving. I'm making it again this year. 'Nuff said!

Beautifully moist turkey that I made last year for Thanksgiving (my first!), and will be making again this year. I don't like sage, so I left that out, but practically any herbs you can think of will do. I also cooked the bird in an oven bag so I didn't have to do the basting routine, and it turned out moist and delicious, most likely because of the butter around the breast meat. I didn't make the gravy last year, but will be making it this year.

This is my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving -- the flavors are clean and herbacious, and the recipe is relatively simple to execute. (I also brine my turkey the night before, which helps keep it moist.)

This recipe makes an obscene amount of gravy. I think I ended up with a half gallon of gravy. Otherwise, the recipe is awesome. I made the turkey stock and herb butter the day before Thanksgiving. Once that was done, it was easy to prepare the turkey on Thanksgiving day. My 13-pound bird cooked in 3 hours. I'll use this recipe again next year.

Made for Thanksgiving. Only difference was I stuffed the bird so I did not put all the other items inside. Tasted great! I doubled gravy base since I had a 22 lb. turkey and lots of guests--it wasn't necessary to double. It makes a ton and was yummy!

Best turkey EVER! My first time hosting my family for Thanksgiving - so glad I found this recipe! I'll never have to search for another. Rave reviews! We had a 16lb turkey for 10 people and it was the juiciest, most tender bird I've ever eaten. Cooked for exactly 4 hours. Took it out when the juices ran clear - before the popper popped. My only mod was to stuff the turkey with the some of the stuffing I was making as a side along with the herbs. That just seemed like a given. I'd do it all over again tomorrow but luckily I don't have to because I still have enough leftovers to last for a week.

Came out pretty well; probably the most moist turkey I've ever prepared. Tip: I wasn't able to get under the skin by starting at the neck end. It was much easier starting from the main cavity end.

I made this for Thanksgiving to RAVE reviews. I did add a lemon to the cavity and some lemon zest to the herb butter. The result was a beautifully browned, moist bird with the most delicious gravy we have ever had (I did have to add more flour to thicken it). This will be our Thanksgiving turkey from now on - well worth all of the extra steps.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving 2010. It was the first turkey I'd ever made and it turned out fabulously. The only thing I did differently was that I added orange and lemon slices to the cavity to keep the turkey moist. My turkey was about 12.6 lbs and the recipe time as written was just right, so you might need a bit more time with a bigger bird.

Rating: 4
Moist and delicious with a lovely golden brown skin, my turkey looked beautiful on the table and tasted great! I only made a few minor changes -- subbed some dried for fresh herbs and added a celery stalk to the cavity. I also did not add any butter while basting/roasting, as I felt it had enough already. The gravy was fantastic! It was a bit thin, though, so I would up the flour to 1/3 C or so next time. A very tasty turkey with lots of yummy gravy - I'll be making this again and again.

Rating: 1
From all the descriptions of copious amounts of gravy, I expected there to be a lot of pan drippings, but had barely any. I think this is because the recipe said to put it on the lowest rack in the oven because I noticed the bottom of the pan was sizzling most of the time and the gravy had a slight burnt taste. I also expected more flavor on the bird from the amount of herbs put on it (I usually use the sage turkey recipe from this site and that has a lot of taste). Thumbs down until I can make it again and figure out what happened...

Rating: 3
The real reason that I chose to make this recipe was the amount of gravy that was yielded. There was so much delicious gravy from this and for that it was worth it. Although, I used about 1/3-1/2 cup flour, not the 1/4 cup that was called for. (It was just too runny without the additional.) The turkey was amazing, but too many steps and too much butter. Next time, I'll use less butter and simplify the steps.

I always used my Mother's recipe which she got from a Danish friend and always got raves. I combined the two and got even MORE raves. I basically follow Tom's recipe, but also double the herbed butter, melt the leftover, pour it over the turkey, and cover it with seasoned flour, then seal it in foil. As it cooks, the juices mix with the butter and flour and form the base for the gravy!!! YUMMY!!

Absolutely delicious. Those at the Thanksgiving day dinner who had never before had brined turkey were flooredpeople just don't know what moist turkey is like, particularly when it comes to white meat. The herbs were succulent, and the gravy was out of this world. I was bad and didn't separate the fat out from the drippings, so we're talking a boatload of butter and turkey fat. That's OKeven if I can't eat for a month until I work off the lard I happily ate this year, it's worth it, and I'll definitely use this recipe next time.

The turkey & gravy were great, but the best part is the meat is still moist and tastiing for turkey sandwiches!

Perfect turkey and I'll never use another recipe. I bought a brined bird and did everything as directed. I agree that a low sodium broth is important as the gravy was somewhat salty. I'd also start out with two cups of broth in the pan to prevent smoking in the early stages. Definitely separate the fat. I discarded about a cup of grease and grime by using a measuring cup that separates the good from the bad. I've never had a turkey so moist.

Rating: 4
What a find! Follow this recipe exactly and you'll end up serving a moist and perfectly flavored bird that looks as good as it tastes. The cooked bird looked like it belonged on a magazine cover, and the meat was perfectly flavored throughout. I used a 22 pound Butterball, and pleased a crowd of 14 with plenty of moist leftovers. Be sure to start with a good quality turkey and fresh herbs, and use a rack to lift the turkey off of the roasting pan. Also make sure that you use the low-salt broth or the gravy may be overly salty. Pay attention to your thermometer and remove the turkey at 175 degrees. My Oxo fat separator paid for itself on this recipe. Have one handy.

This is by far the best turkey we have ever had. It is moist and full of flavor. My Mother In Law (who is 89), said it is the best turkey she has ever had. And the gravy! Wow! Perfect gravy. You could put this gravy on a flip flop and it would be good! One suggestion - I will add a little water to the roasting pan in the beginning to prevent smoking. Other than that, this will be my turkey recipe from now on.

Made this for Thanksgiving last night. I stuck a pierced lemon into the cavity, a trick I've found helps keep poultry moist. Despite this and the copious quantities of butter called for by the recipe, the turkey came out somewhat dry. The herb butter produced a crispy and delicious skin, but I suspect it did not penetrate the meat deeply enough. This recipe sounded promising, but it was nowhere near as good as the Salted Roast Turkey I made last year (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Salted-Roast-Turkey-with-Herbs-and-Shallot-Dijon-Gravy-350432).

Thanksgiving 2009...So we stumbled across this recipe while looking for something fairly simple as our main course for the holiday. to sum it up in one word: fantastic! It took a little wriggling around to separate the skin from the breast in order to rub in the herb butter, but once we figured that out it was fine. We seasoned (buttered and stuffed in the herbs) the turkey the night before roasting, but aside from that, we followed the recipe verbatim and the results were excellent. Thank you Tom Colicchio and epicurious; the turkey came out moist, tender and tasty! Highly recommended!

This was my first turkey for thanksgiving and this recipe worked great! It was easy to do, and the flavor was fantastic. I was surprised at how early it was done though, I expected to have another hour in the oven when the meat thermometer went off - turned out perfectly moist and perfectly cooked then. Now if only I can make sure to repeat this next thanksgiving for my mother in law...

This recipe has become synonymous for "turkey" with my family, as there is now no other way to make one in our opinion. I used this recipe for 3 years in a row with rave reviews and demands to use the same recipe. Last year, after hearing so much hype about recipes that have you brine the turkey first, I used another recipe, and I was not impressed. It was ok, but it did not have the flavor of this turkey, and this gravy can't be beat. The family has decided to bring this turkey back to the table, so that's what I'll do again this year. If you haven't tried this yet, give it a try this year- it's phenomenal!!!!

Excellent!!!! Made this for the second year, this time with a locally grown, all natural turkey. Totally awesome. However I did not stuff the bird with the herbs. Used stuffing instead (look up the caramelized leek and onion stuffing!!). Cook the bird 13 minutes per pound.Basted every half hour and added the chicken stock every second basting. Just delicious.

Cooked a heritage turkey this year using this recipe and it was the best turkey we've ever had. Cooked in a bag to save the drippings and avoid having to baste the turkey.

The turkey was moist and flavorful, the timing of the cooking was perfect. My only issue was that adding a full quart of chicken stock to the pan as the turkey cooked diluted the resulting gravy. I think the extremely flavorful gravy base and what would have been the pan drippings without all that extra stock would have resulted in a much richer gravy.

Turkey was juicy, Gravy is very rich. I can see the gravy base being used as a soup base. I tried this recipe just to go for something different. Sorry Tom, as good as this recipe is, It doesn't beat Mom's (which has been handed down generation to generation) Gravy has a nice taste, but the herbs and base kind of offset the flavor of the drippings. Its all a matter of taste. Overall a good recipe. More work and prep than most recipes for turkey. I probably will go back to making it Mom's way, that's the best.

I made this turkey and gravy last year for my extendend family. What a hit! Though my husband and I have recently moved 13 hours away, I found out tonight that my family is counting on me to drive back to make this bird again. I made a few changes to the herbs (because I didn't measure) and this year I will brine the turkey first (because I will be trusting the men in my family to do the actual roasting while I'm away), but still exceptional. Note: I actually did this in an electric roaster to save oven space, and it was still beautiful! Do what you will with the turkey, but follow the gravy directions to a tee. It's fantastic, and a great recipe for beginners.

This is my new turkey method. On Christmas Day, with a houseful of guests set to arrive shortly, my husband and I abandoned our original plan of deep frying the turkey because it started to pour rain. I decided to try this recipe based on previous reviews stating that the turkey would cook faster. It saved only a little time, but the results were outstanding. Crisp skin, moist meat (white and dark) and excellent flavor from the butter. I did not make the gravy, but I will try it next time.

This turkey was amazing. I was cooking in a small town in Norway, which made it hard to find some of the fresh herbs. I ended up using fresh rosemary and dried thyme, but used the same amount of herbs called for in the recipe. Ended up being mostly rosemary with a touch of thyme. It was delicious. Brined the turkey for 12 hours with ratio of 1 cup salt to 1 gallon water, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tbs thyme. DELICIOUS. Will make it again next year.

Definitely a hit. I used only the neck and giblets from the turkey to make the gravy base, and it turned out great. I roasted the bird breast-side down the first hour to keep the white meat extra moist and followed the suggestions to skim the fat off the pan-drippings before making the gravy.

We brined our 20 lb. bird first so I am rating this based on this extra step. This is your traditional roasted turkey that makes you beam with pride and say, "Whew...I did it!" The turkey was outstandingly moist and flavorful. The flecks of herbs on the breast were lovely and the overall color was a wonderful deep golden brown - certainly worthy of a tableside carving. Basted as directed. (sidebar: We used the Wm. Sonoma brining mix which was $$$ - beautiful aromatics but certainly something that could be duplicated at a fraction of cost).

I made this turkey as a "post-Thanksgiving" meal for my husband and me, since we never get enough turkey leftovers to please him! It was delicious and easy, and the meat was moist. The herbs gave it great flavor. (My husband said, "WHAT did you put on this turkey? It's just delicious!") I downgraded it by one fork because I think the gravy directions are faulty. The pan drippings, especially with all that added butter, are way too greasy to use for gravy without defatting them. However, the recipe does not mention that step, but merely says that the pan drippings should be whisked into the gravy base. I think that would yield a greasy mess! Here's what I did: instead of making the gravy base in the recipe, I just used the turkey giblets to make a quick stock while the turkey was roasting--this saved some time. After the turkey was done, I poured the drippings into a fat separator. While the fat was rising to the top, I put the roasting pan on two burners, added a few cups of the giblet broth, brought it to a boil and deglazed the pan to get all those delicious brown bits. Then I strained the mixture back into the giblet broth and added the now-degreased drippings. I proceeded with the gravy recipe and it was very good---it didn't require any additional salt and pepper. We were practically licking the gravy boat! I would definitely make this again, with the revision above.

After years of my mom's traditional slow-roasted turkey (roasted, covered, for 6-8 hours at 200 degrees), I decided to try this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner this year. It definitely is the "ultimate turkey"! I love making gravy, and have prepared many different kinds of gravies, but this is the best I've ever had. I worried that the turkey would be dry, but it was actually the most moist turkey we've ever had. The family was impressed. It was incredible, and it was so easy to prepare!

From now on, we will use this recipe for our Thanksksgiving turkey. It was delicious. The gravy was especially good and not greasy at all. We let the pan drippings stand to remove the fat and made the gravy base the day before and easily removed all the fat from the stock on turkey day.

Rating: 4
This probably the simplest and most tender turkey I have ever done. I used a 27-pound turkey, and it took over 5 hours to cook, but it was worth it. Word of advise: after the 3rd hour of cooking leave it alone...!! Every time you open the door it increases the cooking time by 5-10 minutes, especially with big birds. A roast rack over the pan is highly reccommended, so it does not become soggy with the pan juices at the bottom side. It came out incredibly moist and tender. The gravy was great, because it was not overpowering, but it is important to strain it and take out some of the fat in the drippings (I used one of the special cups for this). Will definitely make this again...!! I live in Mexico City, so I was concerned about the quality of the local turkeys (called Guajolote here), but it was definitely not a problem...excellent bird...!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The great part of it was how much could be done in advance. The herb butter on the breast kept the breast extremely moist and the herb gravy had a wonderful flavor. This did make a lot of gravy so I found I needed to add a bit more thickening than was called for. In addition, my turkey was only 14 pounds and cooked in 2 hours. We were not ready for the rest of dinner, so I simply turned down tthe oven to 170 and held it there for the next hour and then turned up the heat again for the last 20 minutes. I will make this recipe again and again.

This was the most moist turkey we've ever made and fabulous gravy. We used a 20lb bird, so added an additional basting round. Wanted to reserve more broth to have lots of gravy thus stretched my turkey stock with vegetable stock. Ended up with so much pan juices (even after skimming 4 cups of grease) that I didn't need my reserved gravy stock. Now I've got homemade stock for soup! The gravy was amazing and did not need any additional seasoning. This is our new favorite.

Wonderful turkey. We did do things a tiny bit differently for those that are looking to spend a little less time next to the stove. Covered the turkey after 50" and uncovered it for the last 30". We would probably cover it even earlier next time to preserve the breast, though it was really tender as is. We also didn't make the roux for the gravy; we did a flour & chx broth mix to thicken after removing the surface fat. GREAT TURKEY!

We ran out of broth so we didn't use as much as the recipe called for, but it still came out very yummy. As far as stuffing the turkey goes, we did. We put the sprigs inside along with the stuffing, but omitted the butter that goes into the cavity. Our stuffing was moist and delicious, and our turkey was still very flavorful. :o)

excellent gravy! the turkey was extremely moist, had 1 slice remaining went over so well...no leftovers :-( would do the recipe as is and not add stuffing.

I'm going to make this for a late Thanksgiving - Saturday - and I was wondering if anyone tried to stuff this turkey using this recipe?

Very easy and very good! I made this for a potluck dinner in my neighborhood, and everyone raved about how moist the turkey was. I definitely suggest buying a fresh turkey over frozen. I added fresh springs of the herbs around the turkey for presentation.

When I made this as a test recipe for turkeyday, my husband and I were tempted to use a spoon on the last few drops of gravy. Delicious gravy (deep flavor)and the turkey was fine

I have NEVER roasted a turkey, or made homemade gravy. I followed the entire recipe exactly, and had incredible results. I did this for an early Thanksgiving with friends, and impressed everyone... even myself!

Easy preparation, moist, and flavorful - it was well received by everyone that tried it. The gravy was an excellent match, although we ended up with about a gallon. Let your guests know to stir the gravy before pouring - it separates quickly. Save the veggies strained from the gravy base for turkey soup afterwards.
