This is a wonderfully delicious, light, elegant dish. I served this for our 12 course New Year's eve dinner for 12 people. Our guests could not stop talking about the gremolata. The flavors were subtle but complex. I feel however that as great as this tasted, it requires quite a bit of prep time, and ultimately may not be worth it. I did most of the prep ahead of time, and grilled the fish. I would like to look for store bought lemongrass oil if possible to speed the process. A friend brought a lovely french chardonnay which paired perfectly.

I can only agree with the earlier rave reviews. The dish gets even better if the trout is barbecued (I did large trout on the Green Egg). Next time, I'll use large trout fillets and BBQ them separately, then top with the gremolata. This is a stunning, sophisticated dish to savour and enjoy with guests

Excellent! The butter sauce is light and compliments the trout instead of covering up the taste. The apple pearls were a nice addition to the fish, sauce and Gremolata. I sauteed the apple pearls in a little butter until they were brown instead of roasting them. Don't overcook the apples, they need a little crunch. I used trout fillets so I just sprinkled the Gremolata generously over the fillets. Very nice.

Good luck making the "pearl" apples. Otherwise, this dish had marvelous taste appeal; the sauce was especially good.

This was an incredible dish! It is elegant, and most of the prep work (preparing oil, gremolata, sauce) can be done ahead of time. Make the sauce and hold, saving cream and butter till the end. Cooking the fish and finishing off is only 20 minutes. Well worth it. (The lemongrass/butter sauce is great on asparagus.)
