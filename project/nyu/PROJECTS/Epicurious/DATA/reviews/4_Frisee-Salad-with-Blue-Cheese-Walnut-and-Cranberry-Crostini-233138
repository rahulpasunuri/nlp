Served the crostini along side a mixed baby greens salad with a sweet red wine viniagrette. "wow"'d everyone as a first course for Thanksgiving. Have also used just the crostini as a party appetizer. Tasty and very pretty.

I have to admit, I have made the crostini several times (x the salad) and served as an appetiser, it's a big hit. The cheese mixed with the nuts,shallots and cranberries is just such a nice treat when warmed in the oven on the toasted ciabatta bread. I did not use walnut oil, just EVOO.

This was an amazing start into our Thanksgiving dinner. Our guests were from Germany, England, France and the US and they all said it was wonderful. It was easy to make and made for a lovely presentation.

What a fantastic, delicious, easy & beautiful appetizer this was for our Turkey day. The combinations of blue cheese, cranberry & walnuts are just perfect together. The hint of red wine vinegar cuts the richness of the cheese. You gotta try this!!

Have made this three times, once for Thankgiving and twice for small cocktail parties. I always go too heavy putting the spread on the ciabatta bread, which makes it pretty rich, but everybody still loves it, you can make make everything ahead of time and assemble when ready. I have even transported separate ingredients to a party and put together when needed.

Very good. Toasting the blue cheese mix on the crostini makes a world of difference -- don't skip it.

I served this at a dinner party, which included a guest with a gluten allergy. I used the ingredients in this recipe and reconstructed it into a simple salad. I tossed the frisee (and other mixed greens) with walnut oil, balsamic vinegar, sea salt and minced shallots. then I topped with cranberries, toasted walnuts and blue cheese. Delicious!

I made these as an appetizer.Very rich. Almost too rich. Maybe fresh cranberries would have cut the richness of the cheese better. I chopped the frisee which made it easier to eat and looked pretty to.

I made this for a pre christmas dinner. With the frisee I chopped it like Italian parsley and found it was easier to eat. I also made the original vinegrette with the red wine vinegar and also made another subbing the red wine for balsamic. I asked my guest and they perferd the balsamic better, They said the red wine was to tart and the balsamic complimented the fruit and cheese better..

Made this dish for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. It was so popular with my daughter and her friend that they are making it for their friends for New Year's Eve. It is very easy and incredibly tasty.

Made this as an appetizer at Thanksgiving to rave reviews! Plan to serve it again at Christmas. Used a French blue cheese: Bleu D'Auvergne-perfect!

My Thanksgiving hostess made these for appetizers. They were fabulous BUT she served them as hors d'oeuvres with the frisee on top and I thought it was a little weird--hard to eat and oily. Serving the salad and crostini separately would have been better.

made for a pre- Thanksgiving party and it received rave reviews. Used pecans rather than walnuts. Did not do salad, just the crostini-did not put any frisee on it-everyone loved it. a definite 'Do again'
