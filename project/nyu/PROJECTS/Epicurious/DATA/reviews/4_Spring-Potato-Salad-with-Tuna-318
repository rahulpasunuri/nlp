Delicious alternative to the typical overly-creamy and bland picnic potato salad. I did change the recipe quite a bit, however, because I didn't have tuna on hand. I substituted pancetta: can't go wring with bacon and potatoes! The key, however, is the simple vinaigrette thickened by the egg.

Delicious. I made this to use up some oil-packed tuna I'd had on my shelf for the longest time. All I had to do was go out for potatoes; this recipe is excellent for using stuff that's already in the crisper. I layered the salad in a glass pie plate so as to optimally show off its colors on the table.

I first made this recipe a few years ago and when my husband tasted it he declared it "the Family Potato Salad." So many varieties of potato salad call for mayonnaise, which can mask flavors. This one is very light and refreshing, and the combination of vinegar, tuna and parsley create a unique taste. I make it regularly now, and when I serve it to guests I get at least one recipe request every time.

This is a delicious potato salad that my husband also loves. Easy to throw together. I prefer the potatoes scrubbed not peeled and cut into cubes before bringing to boil then leave to sit until just tender enough for salad.
