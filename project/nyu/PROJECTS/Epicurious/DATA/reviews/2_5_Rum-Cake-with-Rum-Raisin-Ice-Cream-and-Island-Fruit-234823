I made this cake with a few modifications after reading the posted reviews - which really helped alot, and the cake was a huge success! Definately use milk or buttermilk instead of water! I also added, as someone here suggested, 1 tsp rum extract and 1 Tbls dark rum. Man, that did the trick, my whole house smelled rummy! I also used a different glaze which I found at allrecipes.com, made of 1 c butter and 1 c sugar melted together and 1/2 cup dark rum added after removed from heat. It was great - a huge hit! I made it for my co-workers before I went out to see the new Pirates of the Carribean/Jonny Depp movie. ;-)

I definitely liked the flavor of the cake when soaked in a lot of the sauce and accompanied by Dole tropical fruit. It tasted "island like". The cake on its own however, is not worth making. It was very uninteresting.

First this isn't a rum cake recipe as there is no rum in the cake. Instead, I made a Trader Joe's vanilla mix plus a Tblspn of rum and teaspn of rum extract. (I can hear the gasps of shock...) I made the sauce as in the recipe and discovered that rum raisin ice cream isn't available here. We stirred raisins marinated in spiced rum into vanilla bean ice cream. The result was delicious served with fresh mango, pineapple, and strawberries.

It is just awful. I am a very good baker and this cake is a waste of time. Cake dry and too sweet, carmel sauce miserable and too sweet. Many great receipes out there. Don't wast time or money on this one.
