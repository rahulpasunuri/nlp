I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out exactly as it should and was delicious. Everyone loved it. The pan gravy was crazy good.

I started out with putting our chops in a zip-loc with some olive oil and kirkland brand (Coscto) no-salt seasoning with the intention of grilled them. Time and the weather changed and I modified my plans. I took the chops out of their marinade and then followed the directions for this recipe. The result was incredible and a winner from everyone's point of view. I served them with Borracho Potatoes, fried cabbage and onions in bacon fat, cobettes of fresh corn, and big tender high buttermilk biscuits for the gravy. This is a great basic recipe!

Great flavor (used some garlic and onion powder in the flour), and an easy weeknight meal. Family said it was a keeper.

Chicken-fried Pork with cream gravy is one of my ALL time favorite comfort foods!! My recipe is almost exactly like this, although I add powdered onion and garlic to the dredge, and I prefer Boston Butt pork steak to loin chops....more tender and tasty ( as well as more fattening!) A little paprika sprinkled on the pork as it is frying gives a lovely color to the meat, and also to the gravy. YUMMM!!

Absolutely delicious!! Im going to make this again and again and again. I used lawry's seasoned salt to add a little extra flavor and it worked pretty well for me. I wouldnt change a thing in this recipe. It reminds me of eating at my grandmother's house or at a really, really good southern restaurant. Definately a keeper in my book!

Practical. More a "method" of cooing pork than a "recipe." For more interest, add sage to taste to gravy.

It was a bit ordinary (simple), have never tried pork in this recipe before, I did like that. My family seemed to like it.
