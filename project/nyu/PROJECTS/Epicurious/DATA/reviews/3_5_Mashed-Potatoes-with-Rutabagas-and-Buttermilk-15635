My Grandmother always put bacon in as well. Can't go wrong with bacon. It has been my favorite for years

My Grandmother from Norway made this recipe all the time and she called it "Rutamouse" for the root vegetables that were typically used. She cooked the potatoes, rutabega and carrots all together in one pot. after mashing and whipping them, butter was drizzled over the top followed by paparika. Very Yummy!

can anyone tell me if (and if so, why) it's necessary to first cook the rutabagas and then the potatoes? Seems odd...

I was very pleasantly surprised by this dish. It was a total experiment brought on by unexpected company and a shortage of potatoes. Served with a fabulous pot roast, this was a hit. Thank goodness for epicurious!

My mother (from sweden) made this all the time and everytime I serve it, it is the first to go. She called it "Rutamoose" So glad to see it here.

I made this first for Thanksgiving dinner, 1998, for a family dinner of 12--everyone loved it. I've made this many times since & it's always great. Goes with anything you're serving, looks interesting with the little chunks of rutabaga, & is easy.

I'm not crazy about rutabagas, but mixing it with potatoes is good. A good variation from ordinary mashed potatoes.

This was excellent! I made this for Thankgiving in place of the mashed potato and rutabega( separately) my family loved it and said it was a keeper!!
