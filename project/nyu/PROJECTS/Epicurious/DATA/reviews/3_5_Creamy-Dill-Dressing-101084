Great with roasted baby red potatoes and baked salmon.

I made 1/4 recipe for salmon burgers. I wish I had read the reviews as the garlic turned out to be too much. I would go scant on the garlic or substitute garlic powder. However it is easy & delicious & will go into the recipe box.

I used this on chicken and mushroom kebab pitas. I made 1/4 for 2 pitas and had some leftover. It went together in a jiffy and was ever so tasty. I omitted the sour cream, as I was out.

This dressing is delicious and I agree with a previous reviewer about the garlic. I used 3 cloves and it was overwhelming. I will go to 1 next time.

Excellent!! The only problem I had was the amount of garlic. I only used 2 cloves and found it very overpowering, and I'm a garlic lover!! Next time I will use garlic powder. Can't wait to try it on smoked salmon!!

This is a great sauce! I mostly use it on grilled chicken sandwiches. Delicious!

I use this dressing to make potato salad and it's wonderful. I've made it several times and everyone loves it. This is the only way I make potato salad now.
