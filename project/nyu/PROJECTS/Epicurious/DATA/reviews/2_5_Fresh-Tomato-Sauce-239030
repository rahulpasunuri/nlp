I used large garden tomatoes, blanched/shocked, skinned and seeded. Sadly, had to use dried basil, but this is as basic as it gets. I crush my garlic to a paste and don't need to cook it much. I also used half the olive oil. Recipe is fine, couldn't be simpler, but I regret not having fresh basil on hand.

I love this recipe. I made it with tomatoes from our garden and cooked them in my Le Creuset pan. I pureed them in my Vita-Mix and it was as smooth as baby food. It was delicious!!!

This is very tasty and a good way to use a bumper crop of Romas. However, the recipe is not written well, especially for beginners (should include heat settings and time). Also, the tomatoes really need to be skinned first. I ended up straining the skins out at the end. Made a mess and I lost about half the sauce.
