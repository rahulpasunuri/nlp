Pretty good! I especially liked the rub on the pork chop. Even without the salsa, that would have been good. The salsa was a little more time consuming than I anticipated, but was tasty and combined nicely with the pork.

Good recipe-I had to adjust the seasoning to get the flavor that I wanted. I didn't like the consistency of the apples in the sauce so I pureed them along with the other ingredients. I then found the sauce too sweet so I added four more cloves of garlic, two more chipotles and another half cup of cilantro-tasted way better after that. I agree with a previous reviewer that pork loin would have probably been a better cut. Liked this recipe but wasn't in love; would probably make other dishes on this site than this one again.

LOVED this recipe. I made the sauce exactly as written, and it was exceptional - fast and easy enough for a weeknight meal and very unique. It was the perfect way to use up the tomatillos from our CSA share. We skipped the rub and just grilled some chops, and we didn't feel that it was missing any flavor. I would definitely make the sauce again for other meats too.

This recipe is really easy to make and tastes super good. If I were to change anything, I'd use smaller pork chops and not cook them as long. I think I also failed at cutting up the apples small enough. I'd consider trying to julienne them or making them into more of a slaw similar to the papaya in papaya salad with one of those shredder utensils.

Fantastic! Due to a blender malfunction, i coarsely chopped the tomatillos once they cooled, and then cooked them down on the stove with the apples and all other ingredients while I was finishing dinner. I also substituted the parsley and mint in my garden instead of the cilantro the recipe called for, and put in extra honey to account for a lack of apple juice. I could easily riff off of this recipe for the rest of my life. The sweet-and-tart interplay it brings to the dish is lovely, and even simmered a little, the sauce still tasted fresh and lively.

BTW, like the cook from Seattle, I also didn't want to waste a 3.00 can of chipotle for a tsp. I looked up freezing, and found the can of peppers can be chopped up, and frozen in an ice cube tray lined with plastic wrap in tsp. or tbsp. portions, and put into a freezer bag individually wrapped in saran wrap. Or, dry chipotle powder seasoning can be substituted, or...dry chipotle peppers. Guess they can be found on-line.

Cut the salt in half and the rub was just fine. Family loved it! I thought the apples were kind of strange all crunchy in the sauce, so I cooked them down a little, and though they were softer, they lost their nice sweetness and contrast with the rub. When I make this again, I'll leave them uncooked, sweet and crunchy, as written. Served with quinoa and peas..., so good!!!

Delicious! I absolutely loved this recipe. Made it on a weeknight for myself and my husband. Since he had the grill started for the pork chops, I grilled the tomatillos for a little extra kick. Also, I forgot apple juice for the sauce and just added a pinch of sugar to get a little sweetness. Can't wait to take the leftover sauce and try it on some tuna tonight. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

I thought this was a terrific recipe. Despite what other reviews have said, I thought the cumin was a great touch, playing nicely off the cilantro. The chipotle flavor really took it to another level. I altered the recipe a bit by cooking down some of the apples and using extra tomatillos to make it more of a sauce than a chutney. Overall very good.

I did this the other night following the recipe. I'll say, it left me a little disappointed. The oil-based rub on the chops, while imparting a good flavor, prevents the dried spices from incorporating into the chops, leaving them with a grittiness. The salsa was OK, but it leaves you wanting something more. When it hits your mouth initially, you get that feel that its going to really be something incredible, but then it falls flat. The taste of the cumin never really melds into the dish, its flavor remains seperate from the other flavors of the dish. I did like the tartness imparted from the apple, and the texture component the apples create. I don't believe I'd make this dish again, but it will spark some experimentation to perfect something similar.

Very nice. Excellent salsa. I think this would work better with a nice pork loin (not overcooked), thinly sliced. Careful with the adobo. I put in about a tablespoon, and it overpowered the meal. And that is said by someone who loves heat and always cranks it up a notch.

The rub was great, really surprisingly good for something so simple. The sauce, I tinkered with because I too have a spice-wimp in the house, but also because I had a cup of homemade salsa verde I needed to use up. I added the lime juice, the honey and the cilantro and pureed with the green apple. It was lovely (note: the original tomatillo salsa verde recipe was from Rebar cookbook, which is an EXCELLENT source of good recipes!)

Loved this, but husband doesn't like really hot stuff; left out the adobo and used a little ancho chili powder. Was really tasty! You need to use a really hot grill to get the sear on the chops.

Great rub and the sauce was excellent, but pretty hot from the Chipolte Peppers. I will lessen that the next time.

I need chipotle suggestions. Those cans are pretty expensive and this recipe calls for a teaspoon. What can I substitute? Or can the rest of the can be frozen?

Haven't read any of the reviews - but thought this recipe was outstanding. Make sure you buy your pork chops at least 2 inches thick - I like mine pink in the middle when they're finished. I didn't feel like making the chutney from scratch - so I used some leftover indian mango chutney, mixed it with leftover applesauce and added lemon zest and juice. My boyfriend loved it.

I thought these were tasty, but wasn't as floored as others appear to have been. The salsa, for me seemed a little lacking. I admit that I did nt add the apple juice, as it didn't seem necessary and I used chipotle powder as opposed to the canned in a adobo, so maybe that's why i wasn't crazy about it, but it was just okay to me. The spice rub for the chops was very good though.

What a delicious recipe! My husband and I made it as part of our Christmas dinner along with a Yucca side dish. Did not have Tomatillos so used regular tomatoes, still great! I also followed the suggestion to use less salt. We are making it again for our New Years dinner party!

I thought this was a great recipe. I couldn't get fresh tomatillos so I used a salsa verde as a replacement (I'll try it again with tomatillos when they are in season). I added some cubed avocado to the sauce, which worked great. I found the very recipe easy and quick. I like the texture of the cubed apples and don't recommend puréeing them as suggested in other reviews. Ill definitely add this to the repertoire

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I. I was surprised that it did not take very long to make, and it was a very good meal. First off, I used butterflied boneless pork chops. I found that the marinate made a LOVELY glaze when it was being grilled, but the cumin was a little overpowering. Next time around I will use less. The tomatillo and green applesauce was so good, that I used it on top of the porkchops. Amazing flavors, I would definitely suggest serving it like that. I found that the applesauce was a little runny, so it would help to "drain" it a little. I also took the suggestion to use less salt, and I thought it turned out perfect. I served it with mashed rosemary yukon gold potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. We really enjoyed it.

I found this recipe while looking for something different to do with some great looking tomatillos that I bought at the farmer's market. I didn't prepare the pork chops, but agreeing with other reviewers, the salt measurement sounds like an awful lot to me. I didn't have everything in the pantry/fridge to the letter, and I served it with thinly sliced warmed leftover tri-tip of beef that had been grilled the night before. This turned out awesome! The sweet/tart of the apple with the tomatillos was balanced perfectly with the mellow sweetness of the honey, the savory notes of the garlic and cumin (which I added a little more of since we love cumin in our house) were cut by the lime juice and instead of chipotles in adobo, I used ground chipotle powder to provide the sweet, spicy and smokey flavor. I pulled a fresh jalapeno out of the garden and added that chopped fine and halfway seeded for extra heat. Luckily it had several hours to sit in the fridge and let the flavors blend, for sure the flavor improved when dinner was served. Next time i think I'd chop stuff a little finer or at least run my knife through the diced veggies once or twice before adding all the dressings. This really made an already good leftover piece of meat something especially tasty!

Wow! This sounds weird, but is awesome. A little spicy, but very tasty. We agree with previous reviewers that the apples could be pureed, but it might not look as pretty that way. Can skip the apple juice, although we made it as written

Love this recipe! Eliminate or cut way back on the salt in the rub. Throw the apples into the food processor, and don't worry about the apple juice. Out of necessity, I've twice substituted with packaged chipotle powder & a jar of tomatillo chutney and I still got a fantastic sauce.

I thought I had all the ingredients for this recipe when I noticed I had no apple juice. I substituted apple butter for the honey and then just water for the apple juice. That worked really well the sauce was delicious, a nice combination of sweet, spicy and tart. It went very well with the pork chops. I'm going to try the left over sauce with ham as suggested.

Outstanding - we probably went a little heavy on the rub, since we only made 2 porkchops... but it was excellent anyway. Big flavor. Highly recommended. We "pulsed" the apples into the sauce, til they were small, but not pureed... it made the sauce more of a salsa, which we spooned over the chops... scrumptious!

Rating: 3
A Southwest version of pork chops and applesauce! Full of flavor, yet so easy to prepare. Used boneless pork loin chops, and let the pork marinate overnight. The aroma that came off of the grill was a sure sign of good things to come. Definitely pulse the apples in the processor along with the other sauce ingredients. I reduced the cilantro, and ommitted the apple juice for more of a salsa consistency. Adjust the honey, and salt to achieve the correct balance of savory to tartness.

The fresh flavor was fantastic and I will definitely make it again. I cut the salt in half but that was still too much, so next time I'll use 1-2 tsp max. I used Turkey Chops instead of Pork and they were very tender sauteed in the grill pan (no time to grill outside). I used fresh serrano peppers and dried cilantro, plus I followed other readers' advice to process the apples with the sauce - great idea. I served it with Spanish Rice and Chili Rellenos, wow!

Rating: 4
This sauce is phenomenal! I followed the advice of a few previous reviewers and added the apple to the food processor. I took it a step further and tossed the chopped apples in with the tomatillos to soften them a bit. WOW! Because of the "too salty" reviews, I cut the salt to 1 teaspoon and replaced the rest with 1 tablespoon each of granulated garlic and New Mexico chile powder. I saved a teaspoon of this for the sauce, in place of the cumin. I used this on a pork tenderloin, not chops. This rub and sauce would make even an old shoe taste great!

I am making this for the second year as a meal for before Turkey on Christmas day. I agree it was salty so am eliminating any salt from the rub. I used it with pork tenders instead of pork chops and the meat went further to serve more people. This year I will cut the sauce recipe in half. It was way to much quantity but it was delicious.

Next time I will not add the apple juice and tripple the chipotle. It was just a little to much apple for my taste. I used the suggestion of adding the cored apple to the food processor and that worked well. Do wipe off some of the rub to keep it from being too salty.

Porkchops were too salty - I now cut the salt in half. The apple/tomatillo sauce is out of this world and is a new staple in our kitchen. We use just one apple and put it in the food processor with all the other ingredients. An enormous success!

I used the rub on country style ribs with great success. I used one third of the rub mix for 6 meaty ribs, but reduced the salt more than half. Since making something to grill was an afterthought, I didn't have time for long cooking or marinading so baked the ribs, covered, at 400 for 30 minutes, reduced the heat to 300 and cooked about 45 more minutes, then had hubby put them on a hot charcoal grill for about 10-15 minutes. The ribs were very tender and the rub not overpowering. I served tomatillo salsa from this site on the side. My husaband, who is sparing with praise, commented on how good the pork was. Both recipes are definite keepers.

I told my boyfriend we were having "Monster Garage" Pork Chops, so I had his buy in from the begining. I was worried he would find the dish too "delicate", but we both REALLY enjoyed it. The meat was juicy, the sauce very flavorful; such a unique combo. The only substitution I made was chili powder for Chipotle, because I didn't have the Chipotle handy. My Honey brought home chipotles from the store today. I guess that means he would like me to make it again. Four forks up!

Although too salty, this was really great. Cutting back the salt would rate it 4 stars. I did not have any apple juice and so I used pomegranate, I had no fresh apples, so I used dried, plus I used a combination of dried and fresh cilantro. nevertheless, it turned out wonderfully. I am using the leftover sauce on chicken tonight.

I'm rating just the sauce. I served it with grilled pork tenderloin that just had a salt & black pepper rub. The sauce was definitely something different and nice if you're looking for something fresh with a southwestern flair. It had a nice mild heat and unique flavor that does go well with pork. Also a very healthy sauce. A do ahead tip I used was to make the tomatillo sauce the night before and then add the apples an hour or so before serving.

These were wonderful. Entire family of v. picky eaters said they were the best chops they ever had. Let 2" chops sit in rub overnite and then cooked on grill. Made sauce half with cilantro and half w/out for thoes that don't like, both ways were good. Served with GRILLED TOMATOES STUFFED WITH GOAT CHEESE AND SAGE and spanish rice. I'm going to try rest of sauce over chicken breasts w/fennel rub and stuffed w/lime wedge.

This is a terrific receipe!! I've made this a few times and it's turned out wonderful. Once I was running short on cumin and I used a packaged adobo marinade I had and it was just as good.

Terrific! Restaurant quality ! I followed the recipe exactly as written using the charcoal grill method. My only suggestion is to cut back on the cooking time and to check the internal temperature early. My 2" chops were 167 degrees internal at the end of the suggested cooking time. Although still moist I know next time they will be even better!

I took a short cut with the sauce that worked out well. I used Rick Bayless's Frontera Tomatillo salsa and added the chopped apple and additional fresh cilantro. It worked very well and seemed as though the ingredients were close to the recipe here. Also, I marinated the chops (I had 1-in. chops) with the moist rub in a zip top bag in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. The salted acted as a brining solution, so that even when the chops soared to 190 degrees on the grill, they were till moist and delicious. Standing time for the chops seems crucial to keeping them moist.

Made this last night for family. Everyone raved! The tomatillo sauce would be good on almost anything, and the marinade for the pork is delicious! I did not cook tomatillos, just washed and pureed w/other ingredients. Saves a step. I served it with a "gazpacho" salad and mexican green rice.

a nice sauce! light, crisp and different. there's no need to cook the tomatillos, just coarsely puree with cilantro and other ingredients before adding apples. brining pork chops makes a huge difference: soak them in 1/2 c. kosher salt and 1 qt. water solution for about 2 hours. pat dry and sear on the stove, finishing in a 300 degree oven until chops read 137 degrees.

Fabulous recipe. First time I used tomatillos and loved the taste, especially with the apples. Pork chops were wonderful. I made many substitutions, (less cumin and more coriander, used parsley in lieu of cilantro, for medical reasons could not use the spicy/hot peppers) but was still very, very good. Can't wait to make it this summer for friends.

This was fantastic! Everyone agreed it was the best grilled pork chop we've ever had! We added a little extra chipotle chile to spice it up and it was perfect! The rub was very good. We added some apple wood chips to play on the apple sauce and it worked well. Highly recommend with a nice fruity Zinfindel.
