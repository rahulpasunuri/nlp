Had to forego the honey. Too lazy to go to the store for some. Used Sweet and Low in lieu of brown sugar. (health reasons). I did not strain the onions and garlic. I used extra Chili. Very tasty.

As written, this recipe is all heat and very little subtlety. I would do as others noted and cut the chili powder by at least half, and reduce the water by at least a cup as well. I prepared the sauce as written, but I ended up doubling the ketchup, honey and brown sugar to cut the heat, and adding a can of tomato sauce as well. Once I'd cooked the highly modified sauce onto chicken, it wasn't too hot, but there still wasn't much dimension to the flavor. Will not make again - I'll keep searching for my go-to bbq sauce.

i thought this was really great. after reading other reviews i chopped the onion and garlic in the processor and then added all the other ingredients to make it smooth. i'm not much of a measurer so i just dumped in what felt like the right amounts. definately cut way back on the water but everything else was just about right. great tang from the vinegar. also cook it in a non stick pan so no worries with burning it. not sure why it says to fridge it for 2 days as i think it will last awhile. i made it to moisen my pulled pork.

This is so easy to make and really tasty. I made this in a pinch, and couldn't believe I could get something so tasty out of ingredients I happened to have in my pantry. I did find the straining part a little challenging, and ended up serving some strained and some not. I actually preferred the sauce with the onion and garlic intact.

Even with water cut backs, still incredibly watery. Flavor is too vinegary. Not at all sweet. Big disappointment :( Ruined Super Bowl Sunday Dinner, since that was what we were looking forward to all day

I dropped the Worcestershire sauce, doubled the brown sugar. Halved the Chili powder and used 2 1/2 cups water. All the other ingrediants I left the same. It was delicious! I won't buy bottled sauce again :o)

So simple!!! And delish!! Although I did add a little cornstarch to the mix to thicken it up some, it came out perfect. A great base for ribs! I used this for a dry rubbed/sauce basted BBQ rib dinner for my family (of which Dad, Bro and several others are BBQ fanatics). They raved about this!!! For dry rub I used cayanne, paprika, sugar, a little salt and pepper. Let them sit with rub on in fridge overnight. Put them in oven at 250* for 3 1/2 hours and then transfered them to grill. Basted with sauce and let grill continuing to baste regularly until nice and dark. Meat fell off of bones, sauce was perfect sweet/spice combo... IT has become the new family summertime favorite!!

sauce was very good. As others mentioned, cut back water to 2 1/2 cups. I was wanting a sweeter sauce so added additional honey, brown sugar, and a little corn syrup. I also cut back a little on the chili powder, but could have cut back a little more as it was fairly hot.

Fantastic! I also reduced the water content like the other cooks suggested and loved the results. I used this as my sauce with pulled chicken sandwiches. I did find it difficult to strain out the garlic and onion, and a picky husband leaves no option for leaving the bits in. Next time I'm going to try throwing the garlic and onions in the food processor beforehand and simmering the sauce for a bit longer to get the flavor in there. This will go in the regular rotation for sure!

This is a great sauce, just the way I like it. We did reduce the water by 1/3 and I can't imagine how runny it must be to put in all the water called for. A definate keeper.

Excellent sauce! Adults loved it just the was it was -- had to tone down the afterburn for the kids, though. Agree with other cooks to cut down on the water or prepare to simmer for over an hour.

Absolutely great. I put in quite a bit of liquid smoke (the boyfriend likes his barbeque to taste like the grill even in mid-winter) and it was outstanding. very easy.

My 5 year old son gave this recipe three forks, and I agree. I was slurping and sucking my ribs dry. Definately, we'll make this sauce again, although I do suggest boiling the ribs before baking to get them more tender.

Loved, loved, loved this sauce on the baby back ribs and also used it in my baked beans. Excellent. Made a few modifications including reducing water to 2 1/2 cups, increasing honey to 2 tablespoons (we like it sweet) and using 2 tablspoons of regular chili powder, 1 teapoon ancho chili powder and 1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder for some heat. After cooking it for 1/2 hour, I tasted it and decided to add a heaping tablepoon of Dijon mustard and then continued cooking for another 10 minutes, which I think added a lot.

Definitely worth the effort...mmmmm! Glad I used less water than called for. Was worried at first,tasted it after I cooked it,wasn't sure if I liked it. Refrigerating it overnight really makes a difference. Will be making this one many times again.

Like all good cooks, I had to modify a little. I also used just 2 1/2 cups of water. In addition, I used 1/2 cup whiskey and 2-3 tablespoons of liquid smoke. You could also use cooking sherry or bourbon. My next batch is going to have some hot sauce and jalapenos in it. There are endless ways to customize this superb sauce!

I followed all the instructions and it turned out great. It was so easy to make and so flavorful. I cooked it for about 30 minutes and it thickened very nicely. Refrigerated it overnight. I will freeze what is left over. I will make this many times.

Good sauce and worth the effort. I reduced water to 2 1/2 cups and still had to cook well over 30 minutes. I guess I had temp. too low as I was afraid of scorching. Next time I'll due a double batch and freeze half.

I made this during a recent Bears game, I would stir for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes then turn on heat and bring to slow boil, and stir for another 15 minutes, I did this 3 times for a total of 45 minutes of boiling, and thanks to the advice, I reduced the water to 2-1/2 cups, and it turned out good! Used it to make pulled pork sandwiches.

Great sauce regarding the flavor; combination of ingredients was just right. Turned out too thin, though. Next time I'll reduce the water to 2, maybe 2 1/2 cups and/or simmer it longer.

THIS SAUCE IS WONDERFUL BEYOND BELIEF!! I wanted to just eat it - forget the ribs!!! I DID change it a tad... I did NOT drain out the garlic and onion - I left it in!! IT WAS GREAT!! It was a pain to stand and stir for 1/2 hour - but WELL WORTH IT!! I plan on making it again REAL REAL soon - Except for with chicken!!!!

2 1/2 forks. Pretty good sauce. Not too sweet and simple to throw together. Came out thin...needs to be cooked longer--probably doesn't need so much water.
