I thought this recipe was very good. I used a 7 lb turkey, tripled the marinade and and roasted it for about 3 hours on 325 and it came out very juicy. The next time I make it though I will reserve some of the marinade to use as sauce to dip the turkey. Also the leeks cooked faster then the potatoes so the leeks came out perfect and the potatoes were cooked but not as crispy as I would have preferred. I would cut the leeks a bit thicker so that the potatoes and leeks are both crispy at the end.

Tasted good, but definitely needed tweaks to the cooking time. I only put mine in for an hour, and it was perfectly cooked. The potatoes needed about 15 min. less than the recipe stated, but this is obviously just because of differences in my oven. The time for the turkey was much less, however, and I am glad I didn't follow the recipe on that.

Love this recipe! I have made it a week-night regular and the family loves it.

This was a simple recipe with a big wow factor. Everything was delicious and healthy!

This was a great easy meal with very little prep time! I accidentally bought turkey breast with no skin, but it was still moist and delicious. I didn't cook it as long as they asked, just threw it in the oven and watched it. The leeks were so good, like little crispy onion rings!

Thanks to alerts about overcooking, I made a few changes: cut the baby potatoes in quarters and started them about 20 minutes after the turkey went in and, when they were done (after about 20 minutes), took them out and put the beans and broth in the potato pan. (I had legs and thighs as well as a breast in the lower pan.) Ten minutes later, the beans and the turkey came out. Nothing was overdone; the turkey skin was dark because of the honey, and the meat was a smidgen drier than I would like--but that may have been in part because this was from a free-range bird whose grower sold me the pieces. Everything tasted just fine and was cooked to perfection.

For a quick and easy Turkey meal this was great. Little fuss and no carcass clean up. Surprised me the wife even like it and we're serving it again soon.

I was incredibly disappointed with this recipe. I agree with other reviews in that the cooking time was not evaluated very well. The turkey was overcooked and the skin  with so much of the honey mustard sauce on it  simply burned over the course of such a long cooking time. The leeks also burned in the time it took for very small potatoes to cook. I seriously question whether this recipe was truly tested to insure successful results.

I found the turkey to cook too fast, also. My family thought it tasted like one of those pre-marinated pork tenderloins where the seasoning overpowers the meat. I would definitely cut back on the tarragon, as a little bit of tarragon goes a long way.

I put all ingredients except the green beans in a crock pot. Poured in a cup or so of chicken broth. I made the green beans separately to serve with turkey. It was delicious and tender.

I just made this, and the turkey cooked way faster than the time the recipe calls for. Our turkey was dry, the skin burned pretty quickly, and the leeks were overdone as well. I think this recipe has a lot of good points to it, but tweak the timing and check the temperature of the turkey early to avoid a dry bird. Perhaps cover the bird with foil for the first half, then remove the foil to let the skin brown? I'm curious to hear what others have to say.
