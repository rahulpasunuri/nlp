I just used the cabbage, since I had some left-over after making coleslaw. It was fantastic, and my 1yr old baby even loved it (after chopping it fine in the mini-prep)

I replaced the mustard greens with kale because I had it available and another cook had made this same substition and deemed it successful. I have to disagree with this cook. I imagine the peppery quality of mustard greens is balanced by the cabbage. The taste of this dish made with kale just did not transcend the mix of ingredients. I found myself eating around the cabbage. Also, this recipe makes SO much! I halved the recipe, but I am still swimming in cabbage and kale.

I substituted kale for the mustard greens. The next day I added some cooked bow tie noodles to the leftovers for lunch. I will double recipe next time to have more leftovers. Wonderful!

Easy to prepare and almost didn't want the rest of dinner because it was so good.
