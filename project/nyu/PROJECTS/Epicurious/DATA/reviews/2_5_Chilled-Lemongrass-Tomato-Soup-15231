While the soup was refreshing and with a nice, lingering texture, I did not like the flavor - it was a bit off and rather musky. Maybe my tomatoes were the cause of the musky-ness, and it would be fine using different specimens?

I served this on a day when the temperature outside was nearly 100 degrees and my husband loved it! The sweet/salty combination along with the chives and mint was very refreshing and the tomato water was surprisingly tasty. You could almost put as much watermelon as you like and it would still be very good - will make this again.
