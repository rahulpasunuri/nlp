I have been making this since the recipe was printed in the magazine and it turns out great every time. I have quadrupled the recipe successfully as well. Last week I brought this dish to a friend's for dinner and was able to cook it along with the roast at 325 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. Turned up the broiler after the roast came out and the gratin turned out fine.

Ditto the other reviewers - carmelized the onions and added lots of extra salt and pepper. It browned up nicely on its own. Very tasty and rich. We'll make this one again.

Very glad I read all the comments. I did caramelize the onions and added 3 cloves of garlic as they finished up , I did add a scant 1/4 cup of heavy cream between each layer and drizzled about an 8th of a cup cream over the top, I did do three layers---I did NOT add more cheese, the amount specified is perfect, and I did cook them at 400 for 30 minutes, but realize at 400 you have to watch them like a hawk between 20 and 30 almost went too far, but they were perfect. A huge hit. Even the dieters had seconds ;)

I only gave this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 because of the modifications I made to it. But once modified...it was super! Like a few other reviewers, I carmelized the onions, and layered potato/onion/cheese for 3 layers. I salted the potatoes well in between each layer, and poured 1/4 cup of heavy cream in between, as well. Baked until crispy on top (about an hour at 400). It was terrific!

The first time around, I made this recipe 'as written' and agree it was unexciting. However when I made it last night, I followed other's advice and it was excellent. I carmelized the onions in butter and also added 3 cloves minced garlic to the pan, just as the onions were finishing. As I layered the potatoes, onions and cheese, I seasoned generously with salt and pepper. I also added 1 Tablespoon crushed dried sage to the top of each layer. These changes really made the difference. I agree that this recipe is the springboard to making changes to suit your taste or menu.

I have made this recipe a few times and it has always been well received. It is key that the dish be seasoned very generously with salt and pepper or it is indeed bland. I carmelized the onions in butter last night instead of boiling them, it made this recipe much better. Next time I will also add thyme to see how that adds to it. An easy recipe to tailor to your liking or to pair with a main dish -- a definite keeper.

Guests loved it. I'm not a huge potato fan, so I was fairly indiferent. Heading advice from other reviews, I carmalized the onions in a litte butter and reduced chicken stock. Added loads of salt and a cup of chicken stock to the potatos while cooking to boost the flavor. I used heavy cream, but it didn't thicken up as I expected. The gratin did not require broiling, it browned nicely on its own.

WARNING: You MUST eat this soon after making it, otherwise it freezes solid.

I carmelized the onions which added a lot of flavor to the dish - boiling onions like the recipe suggested just didn't sound appetizing. Make sure to be liberal with salt and pepper. This dish went over very well for Thanksgiving.

I must say I was completely underwhelmed by this dish. Unfortunately, I had doubled it for a sizable dinner party. Everyone politely picked, but there was so much left over. It didn't even look good - the greasy film at the top of the baking dish was the beginning of the end for me...

Very bland. Needed lots of salt. I'd try another potato gratin next time

If you haven't made this recipe, heed the advice of those that have gone before you! This IS a good recipe BUT change some basics: Don't be afraid of the salt here, boil potatoes in salted water, salt and pepper every layer generously. Sauteing the onions is excellent advice, brown them well, add you're favorite herbs- thyme is a lovely suggestion. Use all ingredients in each layer. I didn't need to brown it at the end, it was lovely as it was. I put plastic wrap and a heavy dish on top as it sat in the fridge, it helped with the form and made sure every crack was full of goodness. Even better the second day. The beauty of this recipe is that after making it the first time, I can see endless possibilities with a variety of ingredients. Gonna keep it:)

Boil onions??! This recipe is great because of the relatively short cooking time. But while prepping all those potatoes try cooking the onions (I added butter, cayenne, salt, pepper, and thyme)until they carmelize a bit. Much tastier.

I made this for the third year in a row for our annual Christmas open house. I have never had people rave so much about a potato dish. This is an absolutely delicious recipe as is.

Very rich and definitely worth all the calories! I made this with a beef tenderloin and it was well received by everyone. The few leftovers that remained heated nicely in the microwave the next day. I cooked it at the same time as the roast at 375 degrees rather than 400 for about 15 minutes longer and it worked well - didn't need to put it under the broiler to brown. Will definitely make this again.

I agree with the comments about this dish being very bland if you follow it exactly. I tend to think I like bland dishes, but this lacked any personality. I will make it again, but with some major improvements. Disappointing if made exclusively by following the receipe. Very easy though and worth some tinkering with. That's part of the fun of cooking thought, right?

Great flavor and easy preparation. I used half and half to cut a few calories and it worked out fine. I thought the cheese was unevenly distributed. The only change I will make is to put half the cheese in the middle and the remaining half on top. For those of you that thought it was bland spice it up - more salt, pepper, thyme, etc.

I made this exactly as printed--unusual for me. It was okay. I thought it was sort of bland. Needs something. Not sure what. Maybe bleu cheese. Sure is easy!! I will make it again, but with some additions. Maybe caramelized onions. Or mushroooms. But then it would be another recipe. Did like the make ahead part! Maybe some herbs!

This was a great tasting & fairly easy potato dish to prepare. I landed up using grated locatelli instead of the parmesan. I thought it might of been too much and would of over powered the gruyere. However, I listened to other reviewers and didn't make any changes. It was fine. I served this with the "rib-eye steak au poivre with balsamic reduction" recipe. Which is a great recipe to try as well. I think these two will be served together quite often around here.

This was really delicious! For those who don't like onions and want a potato gratin dish that's wonderful, try the recipe, on this website, Potato Gratin with White Cheddar Cheese. It is fabulous but very rich!

Well, I didn't have the Yukon Gold so, I used Russet Potatoes and it was just wonderful. So wonderful, I tried it with Yams, wonderful, wonderful, my Mother just loved it. It's going to be holiday tradition in our home, BAE.

Outstanding - best "scalloped" potatoes I have ever had. I used smoked Gruyère cheese and it was fabulous!

Definately the best potato gratin I have found yet. The only time I have no recommendations for changing a recipe - perfect as is! Delicious!

This was so easy and delicious. Quite sophisticated for potatoes! I used 2% milk instead of cream. Not a good substitution because the milk never thickened like the cream would have. Keep this recipe exactly like it is!

We thought we'd never top the potatoes with leeks and gruyere (Bon Appetit, April 1999), but this recipe is even better.

I have made this 3 times, for different people each time. It's a 'rave' recipe. Excellent taste, richness and presentation. My current favorite au gratin recipe.

Yum Yum. My husband and I loved it. We are always looking for simple and tasty recipes.

We are making this dish for a second time today since we found it outstanding at a previous party. Cooking the onions with the potatoes seem unusual but really turned out great. I would not change the menu at all.

I would call this dish comfort-food instead of bland. My guests requested the recipe. Served it with rack of lamb with dried cherry sauce, and it was a perfect accompaniment. Easy to make too, which is always nice.

I found this to be bland - regardless of the pungent cheeses called for. It may have been better if the onions were diced and sauteed first - instead of boiled with the potatoes. The recipe seemed "dry" and bland.

I doubled the recipe serving 8 people and everyone had seconds! It is simple but delicious. Next time, I will add a little more salt when layering. Also, my 11-cup food processor, with two different sized slicing blades, made preparation of the potatoes and onions a snap!!!

I've made this twice already. Easy to prepare and delicious. I never liked scalloped potatoes until this recipe!
