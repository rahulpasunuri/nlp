I am rather the inexperienced cook (I've been known to burn mac 'n' cheese), but my boyfriend and I managed to make this and then absolutely devour it. We followed the directions completely, and the artichokes ended up being completely delicious! All of our ingredients were fresh (purchased hours prior to cooking), so it tasted even better. Probably took about 2-3 hours from preparation to plate. Definitely worth trying!

I'm just curious: what recipe did the "cook" fromhinghamsouthofBoston prepare? Sure wasn't this one! Delicious when prepared AS WRITTEN.

Oh my gosh, if you aren't comfortable cooking artichokes, this recipe is the reason to learn! For poor Ed, whose 'chokes shriveled in the oven, you either did not add the proper amount of water, or your foil tent wasn't tight and the steam escaped. And for the person who wanted to pre-cook the 'chokes before stuffing and baking, the purpose of tenting and adding water is to steam them in the oven... this works, trust me. You do not need to pre-cook them if they are prepped correctly. And for anyone who wants to use canned artichokes... oh, please don't! Just go out for fast food instead, if canned food tastes as good as fresh to you. This is a fabulous recipe if you follow it exactly and... very important... prepare the artichikes properly! It is worth learning how. Jacques Pepin explains the technique very well in one of his books. I always use my cooking shears with great success when prepping 'chokes. I'm making this recipe to again to impress the relatives at Thanksgiving. It delivers champagne taste on a beer budget (OK, an imported beer budget).

After reading the reviews below, I modified the recipe. I used artichoke bottoms (the canned kind, rinsed, about two cans). I used shallots instead of the onions and some of the garlic as my onion was yucky. I also used jarred roasted red pepper, well rinsed and finely diced. After pretesting I determined that it wasn't binding well enough to stuff into the artichoke bottoms, so I added a heaping tablespoon of leftover aioli (mayo with a little lemon juice would also work). The tang really helps. Then I warmed it up in a very hot oven until the stuffing was golden brown. All said and done it turned out well and looked far more attractive than the origional must have after such a long cooking.

I recommend you use this recipe if you want to tell that special someone that he/she is much better off cooking for themselves. After 50 minutes, the artichoke had already shriveled. I pulled them out after that point and ate them before they turned black. I wasn't sure if were were eating artichokes or rubber. Disgusting.

After several tries, I finally got this one to work. Definitely precook the artichokes and make stuffing a day ahead. Trim the outer leaves and top on the artichoke, but don't worry about the choke until after it's cooked. It's alot easier to work with that way. As for the filling, I cut the butter down to 2 Tbspns. If you saute correctly over a low flame, the vegetables will produce enough stock to keep from sticking. I crushed the garlic cloves for a more intense flavor (obviously I like garlic). I cut the breadcrumbs to 1 cup and tripled the crabmeat to 3 cups (24 oz.) I also used fake crabmeat, and it worked fine. (I don't use the real stuff for testing). After stuffing, I reheated it in the oven at 300 and I tried it in the microwave. I think the oven gave a better end product, but the microwave was ok. Finally, I tried using fresh fennel instead of celery. Now THAT was good!!! I think the original concept of the recipe was good, but the technique was definitely lacking. Should you decide to accept this assignment, it's very workable to your own tastes. Unfortunately, this evaluation will not self-destruct in 30 seconds!(Didn't you ever watch MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!?)

Once again, one wonders if the magazines actually try these recipes or they just jot them down, thinking "wouldn't this be nice"! I cooked these 1 1/2 hours and they were not even near being cooked. Plus they looked like some kind of land mine, all shriveled and nasty. You MUST cook them first. I ended up just eating the left over stuffing. Depressing!

This was my first try working with artichokes, and it was a great success! The stuffing was fantastic! It might be good as a stuffing for sole or flounder, too. Everyone loved it, even those who had never had artichoke before.

My guests and I thought this was a fantastic appetizer. Next time, I will cook the artichoke first - it didn't cook enough to eat the artichoke leaves even after over 1.5 hours in the oven. The stuffing is delicious - being able to eat the artichoke as well will make this dish tough to beat!

I thought it was great and relatively easy to make. I would suggest dripping some lemon on the leaves before cooking.

I had such high hopes for this recipe and it was a real disappointment. First of all, raw artichokes are impossible to work with. Aside from that, the stuffing was dry and uninteresting. There are many other and better artichoke recipes on this website than to waste your time with this one.
