Pretty good... everyone liked it. But it was way too much work and a little pricey for how good it was. Way cheaper and easier to buy better quality gelato at the grocery store.

I thought this recipe was just OK. It didn't have enough flavor for my taste. I didn't even discern the Amaretto. I will look for something else to make next time.

This recipe is so simple. I don't even use an ice cream maker. I just put the mixture into a bowl and stir it well every 1 hr or so. Turns out perfect everytime. Everyone raves about it. I use this as the base for all flavors. Simply make this recipe and add whatever else you wish. Especially good with the SPICED APPLE WEDGES WITH CARAMEL SAUCE added into the ice cream. I make and experiment with this recipe all of the time.

This is amazingly good and so simple to make. I didn't think it was going to turn out well at all after the first step as the mixture looked as though it had curdled, but I continued to follow the directions and it was heavenly!

Wonderful! I first tried this as a way of using left over egg yolks, and now I'm hooked. Guests love it, and I don't have the heart to tell anyone how simple it is to make.
