Good comfort food but lacking a distinctive flavor. I wanted something more intense, but the sundried tomatoes and the broccoli rabe both got lost in the dish. It was good, though, and I'll probably make it again during the winter.

This lasagne was good but not especially distinctive. When I made it there was no broccoli rabe flavor at all. I could have used spinach and it wouldn't have made any difference. I just felt that if I was going to the trouble of finding that ingredient, it had better taste a little different. It was just not a "wow" in my opinion!

It was tasty the first night, but I like having lasagne leftovers, and the broccoli rabe just got more and more bitter.

A great recipe, especially for broccoli rabe lovers -- made it for company and there was nothing left. Caveats: it doesn't serve eight -- there were only four of us;my lasagne sheets were about 6x6 1/2, so I had to fudge to make them fit; and, be sure every inch of pasta is covered with sauce, or it won't cook properly. Enjoy!
