Normally country-style ribs require long slow cooking. This recipe is a great, quick prep. The mustard based marinade tenderizes the meat without the acids cooking it. This has become a "go to" recipe in my kitchen.

We failed to give this on a review the last time we made these ribs at the Poker Game, so here goes. The recipe is ok, but reall y can use tweaking for those of us with a spicy palate. After tasting these we redid them with our own spice and sauce. Way better. But not every one has tolerance for the spice so either way these are good, just could be a bit better we think.

Not unlike what we put on rack of lamb. I used 1 T of Penzey's Sunny Paris seasoning instead of the savory. It had to marinade for 45 minutes, as someone was home late. Then it took about 40 minutes to cook -- grill marks, turning to cook evenly. Your nose knows when it's done, I served it with homemade potato salad, and some grilled wedges of butternut squash bulby bottom part, tossed in olive oil, and seasoned with some Red & Black pepper, and a bit of smoked paprika. Way too good!

I also made this using coarse grain mustard, and I also added honey, garlic, and a little fresh thyme. Then baked in the oven for about an 1 hour and 15 minutes. Delicious. Tender and Flavorful. I think this would also work well on a pork tenderlion, and am definately going to make it again.

OK as is...changed the dijon to coarse, grainy mustard for more texture and "pop". Added more vinegar and went 50/50 tyme and savoury. Will make again but won't go into the "all time favourites" list.

made this dish last night. added garlic and honey as others have. I thought it was fabulous. Baked the ribs in the oven for an hour. Juicy and flavorful. Double the recipe so there is extra dipping sauce tableside

I didn't actually make this recipe, but I can't believe the cooking time is correct. I make country-style pork ribs all the time on the grill, and I don't cook them for less than 45 minutes on my gas grill. I sear them on each side (about 5 minutes on each side depending on the heat of the grill) and then move them to a cool burner, cover, and let them cook for at LEAST another 40 minutes. You can also sear them on the grill and stick them in a 250-275 degree oven to finish. My favorite marinade is soy, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, and worcester. You can't go wrong!

Both my partner and I have Acid Reflux Disease (GERD). We liked this recipe, but with modifications. The second time we tried this recipe, we added 2 small cloves of garlic, red wine instead of vinegar, and no water, plus a bit of salt. We found it to be flavorful, but not boring.

Like the last reviewer, I found this recipe to be bland. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I broiled instead of grilled the ribs. The marinade did not add anything to the flavor--nothing at all; couldn't tell there had been any marinade at all; and it didn't keep the ribs from being dry, even though I did not overcook them. This is not, in my opinion, a keeper.

under-whelmed, followed recipe as is, used boneless country style ribs and was not impressed. I'll go back to using a barbecue rub of chile powder, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, salt etc.

We used this recipe for pork chops instead of ribs and marinated them longer, about 4 hours in the refrigerator, taking them out about 20 minutes before grilling. Summer savory grows extremely well here and is the favourite island herb. Everyone loved this marinade on the chops.

Tried this last night and my husband and I loved it! Had a 2-lb. rib-end pork loin roast thawed, so used that and marinated for 5-6 hours. Also used marjoram as I did not have summer savory. BBQd for about an hour and it came out tender and juicy. My husband says this one's a keeper!

Good flavouring. We substituted Montreal Steak Spice for the savoury spice. Excellent!

Great ribs! I substituted rosemary (1/2 T) in place of the summer savory. I also grilled using indirect heat, approximately 1 & 1/2 hours. Turned out very tender and tasty. My husband said he would have liked more seasoning but I liked them the way they were.

Delicious and easy. I made this for a quick Sunday night dinner after a day of Christmas shopping, and it was just what the doctor ordered: Fast and tasty. I had no savory on hand, so I subbed a spice blend instead. It seemed to be just fine. I'll add this to my arsenal of fast dinner recipes.

I too used marjoram instead of summer savory, I also boil the country ribs for a about 15 minutes. The marinade is also good on pork chops!

Easy preparation. Used marjoram in place of summer savory and added 1 T of honey for sweetness. Cooked on the grill in November and it was a snap.

I didn't have nearly the same positive reaction to this particular recipe. I thought the marinade needed more oomph. Maybe more vinegar and an overnight marination would help. And 10 minutes per side? I'm perfectly happy with pork cooked only to a rosy (but still done) color, but these ribs needed almost twice as long, seared over the coals and finished to the side. Would love more recipes for this cut of meat, as I find it tasty and it seems like it's always on sale, but this isn't one I'll repeat.

Quick, easy. I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey to give it a sweet taste. Yum!

I was skeptical that I could grill a cut of meat that usually is braised. It worked out to be very tasty. It was messy to eat, so I wouldn't serve it for company, but my bone-hungy man liked it a lot. I didn't have savory, so I used fresh rosemary.

This is a great alternative to barbaque sauce. There is no sugar in it, and it was great.

Yum! Quick, easy, delicious - I'll definitely make this one again.
