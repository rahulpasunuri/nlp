I have made this many times since it appeared on cover in 1995. I have even cheated and used a store bought graham cracker crust and it comes out just fine. Trader Joe's lemon curd tastes just as great as homemade.

This cheesecake was only ok...using lemonade concentrate did give it an overly sweet lemon flavor as other reviewers have said. As opposed to a fresh, tangy lemon flavor. Also I definately agree the texture is not as rich and thick as you want cheesecake to be. But it was easy....

This was a huge success and everyone has been bugging me for another one ever since I took this to work for a friends birthday. Keeper.

A very easy recipe. I still have the original issue from 1995. I've made it at least once every spring, especially for Easter. Follow the directions exactly and it will come out perfectly.

This one is a keeper! It was the perfect ending to our 4th of July meal. It was so refreshingly tart and tangy. I made my own lemon curd from the recipe on this site from Dec. 2000 - it seems to have more lemon than the other curd recipes but that's what gave my cake that wonderful kick. My husband didn't care for the walnuts, but everyone else like it. I took some to work where a co-worker wanted to lick the plate clean when it was gone, she also requested for me to try almonds the next time.

I also have been preparing this recipe since it was on the cover. It is wonderful and a crowdpleaser! Enjoy!

I have been making this cheesecake since 1995 when it appeared on the cover of Bon Appetit. Everyone that tastes it raves about how good it is. However I do not use the commercial lemon curd I make my own from a recipe I found in a December 1991 issue of Gourmet Magazine for Lemon-Lime Curd (I just replace the lime juice and lime zest with the same amount of lemon juice and zest). This recipe is sure to please and you will be asked to make it time and again!

This chessecake is requested every Easter and some other special days. It is so easy and I have not had one crack or flop on me yet. Add this one to your recipe box, you will not regret it.

My entire extended family adores this recipe. I first made it when published in 1995, and have made it numerous times since. I have photocopies of the recipe to give out, since everyone always requests it. My cousin has taken over making it for Easter, but I still try to make it occasionally. Along with the Bourbon Pumpkin cheescake published in 2003, and the Vanilla Cranberry cheescake published in 1994, it is in my top 3 favorites list. I used Dickenson's Lemon Curd.

Outstanding dessert.........for those of you who love lemon and cheesecake this is a must. Always receives rave reviews when I make it.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made that required a springform pan. I made it for Easter dinner, and the whole family loved it! This was the beginning of making more complex cheesecakes for just about every holiday and special occassion. Thank you!

I have been making this cheesecake for special occassions (and not so special occassions) since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit. Everyone loves it and I have given out the recipe so often that I bring copies of it when I bring it to a party. I have varied it by adding lime concentrate and lime zest in place of lemon.

If you didn't like this cheesecake, go to Cookinglight.com and check out their recipe. I have made it twice and it's to die for.

This cheesecake is just awful! It is quite light and tart as some of the other reviewers have pointed out, but none of the flavors work, either alone or together. The toasted walnuts in the crust are too strongly flavored to pair well with lemon, and they clash with the cake and the topping. Also, rather than having the light, clean flavor of fresh lemon, this has the overly-sweet, cloying flavor of lemonade concentrate and purchased lemon curd. My husband and I each had one (small) slice last night, and almost decided to just throw the rest of the cake out. He didn't even finish his one piece. What a waste of ingredients! If I decide to make another lemon cheesecake in the future, I will find a different recipe - one that relies on lemon juice and lemon rind for its flavor.

It was delicious, but very thin. It was more like a tort than a cheesecake. I didn't use all the lemon curd and I added a little fresh lemon juice to the cake and topping. Next time, I'll use a smaller springform pan.

I made this as a finish to Xmas bruch and it was a hit. However I did modify the recipe a bit. I made my own lemon curd and used ginger snaps, vanilla wafer cookies and walnuts for the crust. I also served the cake with raspberry sauce and fresh raspberries. Delicious!

This cake is delicious, although it is best for people who really love lemon! I love its palate-cleansing flavor: plenty tart, plenty sweet, quite yummy.

I had high expectations for this dessert, but I was very disappointed. I think what ruined it for me was the lemon curd on the top. It made the cheesecake much too sweet. I love lemon and so does my husband, but we ended up throwing most of this dessert away. I would suggest cutting back on the lemon curd. That may make it taste better.

it came out far too runny. i would recommend you extend the baking time if you want to try it.

This has become a standard for showers, spring parties, and glorious finales to summer dinners. Everyone loves the freshness of lemon!

Thought this cheesecake was pretty good. Very light tasting and lemony. The cheesecake itself looked a bit small--for presentation I like higher, taller cakes. The crust started to brown before 10 min., so 5-6 min. was sufficient. Filling took full 50 minutes. Worked well to spread sour cream over cooled cake and drop dollops of lemon curd over top and swirl slightly with knife. Two stars because although cake was good, wasn't a "WOW!". I also like a little denser and taller cheesecakes.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. Quite light. I've made this three times in the last two weeks,to rave reviews every time. I followed another reviewers tip for the topping - I spread sour cream on top of the cooled cake, piped on the lemon curd (I made my own), and drew through the curd with a knife to make an attractive design.

I love lemon and this cheesecake was great. It is my special occasion dessert.

This simple and delicious cheesecake would have been even better if I had used the proper-sized pan (I used a smaller pan, so it was a bit on the undercooked side). After reading previous reviews, I decided against the swirled top. Instead, I covered the whole thing with a layer of sour cream, then piped lemon curd (yes, store-bought-and it was fine) in lines, then drew a toothpick through them, forming a pretty, marbled design. Easy AND beautiful.

Very good cheesecake. Could also be made without the lemon curd topping which, if store-bought, is not great tasting. But the topping makes for a very attractive cheesecake.

Very creamy and delicious but I had a hard time swirling the curd and the sour cream. The top ended up very messy.

I used almonds instead of walnuts because of preference, it turned out great. I purchased some lemon curd but after tasting it decided to make some from scratch. The purchased was the pits. If you make yours from scratch be sure to beat it until smooth, very important, I forgot!

Excellent cheesecake. I used Peppridge Farm Gingerbread men cookies instead of the graham crackers. Everyone raved about the flavors. I plan to use the gingerbread cookies next time, too. We served this with Giorgio Lemoncello Liqour and espresso. EXCEPTIONAL FINALE!!!!

Excellent! One of my most frequently asked for repeats. I'm a stickler for creamy cheesecakes and this passes the test.

I have made this recipe three times. Not very hard and the results are well worth it. I keep all my Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines but seem to have misplaced 4/'95 so it was great to find it here. It will be served at Easter again this year.

I have been making this cheesecake since it appeared in the magazine. It is requested by my sister, mother, and family and friends more than any other dessert. The last time that I made it was for a baptism reception and 4 people asked me where I purchased it. If you make this you will not be sorry. It is the best cheescake I have ever had.
