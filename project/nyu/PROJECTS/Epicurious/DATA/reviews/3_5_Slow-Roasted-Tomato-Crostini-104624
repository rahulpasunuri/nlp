Really good recipe! The garlic was a bit overdone, so I would cook it for 50 minutes rather than an hour next time. The slow-roasting imparted great flavor to tomatoes that tasted like cardboard when raw. I sprinkled the crostini with basil instead of mint and olives because I didn't have those ingredients on hand, and the substitution worked really well. I will make this a regular winter appetizer or snack.

This is one of my 'go to' appetizers for parties, especially in the winter when the produce is terrible. Roma tomatoes work best. More delicate tomatoes fall apart during cooking. I usually substitute basil for the mint and olives.

Really tasty, and easy to make. I peeled the tomatoes after roasting.This recipe was a hit.

I served this as an appetizer at a barbecue. Everyone loved it. I substituted basil for the mint (I am a traditionalist!). The only thing I would do the next time I make this is to bake the bread slices for less time. They were too crunchy and tended to crack and break as we ate them.

I really liked these and think they could serve as the base for many variations. It was a nice way to enjoy summer flavors in the winter. The mint is really interesting and makes me wonder about how else it could be substituted for basil. When making again, I'd add a bit of salt to the garlic paste, and increase the amount of olives.

This is superb. Especially good if you have delicious farmer's market tomatoes as I did. I wouldn't bother unless you have good tomatoes. If you want to really take it over the top, spread a layer of aged goat cheese (like buche de causses) on the crostini. Serve with a good burgundy or pinot noir My mother-in-law uses the slow-roasting method to make her tomato sauce for pasta. Yummy.

I multiplied this recipe by six for a big party. It was easy and the guests commented on how much they liked these!

I made this over the weekend. It was a big party and I had prepared a lot of other dishes so I forgot to top with the mint and olives, but my sister sprinkled some oregano on top. I also rubbed the bread with some raw mashed garlic before brushing with the olive oil. It tasted really good and my guests finished most of it. One reservation, though: if you are having a more formal gathering I would omit this recipe because it doesn't look very chic on the table. I would make it for an informal get-together.

My guests LOVED this, but I made the following changes: First, I cored and seeded the tomatoes. Second, I used rosemary-flavored baguettes for extra zip, which I rubbed with roasted garlic as the recipe suggests. Third, I substituted chopped fresh basil for the mint, since my husband liked basil over mint. Finally, I used lots of kosher salt and black pepper along with the olives. The final result -- delicious!!! Kind of like a winter bruschetta.

Delicious contrast between the roasted tomato, olives and mint. This even makes styrofoam supermarket tomatoes taste great. The slow roasting is a nice trick to know. It's a light hors d'oeurve to enjoy with a cocktail and worked especially well with this menu of Braised Lamb Shank Shepherd's Pie with creamed spinach and a green salad with a creamy gorgonzola dressing. A delicious winter menu.

The essential components of this recipe were very good. I would trade out the Plum tomatoes however and use either roasted red peppers or sun dried tomatoes. The plum tomatoes were too big for this crostini.
