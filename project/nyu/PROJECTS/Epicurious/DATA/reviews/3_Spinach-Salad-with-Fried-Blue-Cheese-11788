This was good. Used blue cheese and it worked well. Could even be an appetizer. The dressing seemed very oily so I doubled the Worcestershire and vinegar but that was too much. Maybe just double the vinegar. I might mince the garlic next time too.

Substituted the red-wine vinegar for balsamic, added pears and dried cranberries to add a little sweetness. the salad was a hit.

I liked the fried blue cheese but the dressing was just awful! I trashed my first batch and made it again with a citrus dressing and it was much better. I used gorgonzola which was hard to work with because it is soft. I would used a harder blue cheese as well.
