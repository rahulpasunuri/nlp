Delicious! I made these for a cooking competition - and the judges were impressed. The creme caramel itself is smooth, sweet, full of spicy flavor. The pistachio phyllo crisps were an absolute hit, no one could stop eating them (including me!) I made full sheets and extra crisps to use for decoration on the final product. I would warn against using too many raspberries, especially if not in season. Their tartness is a nice accent to the sweet dessert, but just a few are needed.

This is a fabulous recipe and a beautiful presentation! I highly recommend trying it.

I'd love to make this, but I'm serving a lactose-intolerant crowd. I can use lactose-free whole milk, but does anyone know a lactose-free substitution for heavy cream??? Or is that just an oxymoron?!

YUM! what an exquisite marraige of flavors and textures. don't be tempted to skip the raspberries--they offer an important fruity note. the lengthy process is worth every minute of effort. serving sizes are large--the second time I used smaller ramekins.

for the poster from white rock, "chai" also means tea in hindi. although, i do agree that starbucks charges too much... i thought this was excellent! the crisps were too much work but the presentation was nice!

Made this recipe when the in-laws came to visit. Not one drop was left on anyones plate. Lots of compliments. Need help regarding making the carmel. I melted the sugar in a sauce pan and then poured it into the ramekin. When I inverted the ramekin, the "carmel" was rock hard and had to be chiseled out of the bowls.

The creme caramel was superb and a lovely end to an Indian style meal, grilled chicken "tandoori". I will definitely make the cremes again - the flavor was delicate but delicious. The phyllo dough is possibly more trouble than it's worth, but it adds a nice touch especially with the sweetened ground pistachios. The raspberries were fine, but they weren't entirely necessary.

This recipe is incredible! The subtle chai flavor combined with the caramel and the crunchy phyllo was extraordinary! I'm dissapointed others where not as impressed. This is a recipe well worth repeating although next time I will divide it into 4 ramekins instead of 2.

You want to know what chai means? It means tea in czech and I know that Starbucks charges WAY too much for it. Don't buy the hype.....

To the Cook from Long Island: You'll find "chai" tea drinks at Starbucks and the like. According to an Indian guy I know, it's a bit of a misnomer, because in India "chai" IS tea. Masala chai is sweet spiced tea, which is what you're really getting when you order chai here in the U.S. The spices listed in this recipe are some of the usual ones in the "chai" drinks you see here:cardomom, fennel seed, cinnamon, cloves, sugar or honey - that is the sweet spice flavor of "chai". Hope this helps!

Really expensive dessert! A bit too sweet...but the chai flavor really came out well. I had a lot of leftover pistachio crisps...maybe using half of the phyllo sheet would be better. The creme caramel didn't turn out as smooth as the photo... I must've done something wrong...

You need to use whole cardamon pods as they are only simmered in the cream and then discarded. They should have them in the spice section of your grocery or store. However I would suggest you make a different creme caramel or flan instead. I was disappointed with the results. I felt the chai spice did not ad to the dish, and I love chai tea.

I'd imagine you'd be able to use ground cardamon since you probably have to open the pods in this recipe anyway before putting them in the cream mixture. Or you can go to an Indian or Asian grocery to find whole roasted cardamon pods. I haven't made this recipe, so I don't know what's best.

I have problems with this recipe--it sounds terribly delicious and extravagant and impressive but I have no idea where to find cardamon pods. Is it possible to use ground cardamon instead?
