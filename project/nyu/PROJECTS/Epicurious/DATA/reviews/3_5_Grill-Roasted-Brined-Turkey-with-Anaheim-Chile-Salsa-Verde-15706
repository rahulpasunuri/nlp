I have not made this as I was only looking for a technique, but to the person who said this was way too salty, if you are using a turkey that has already been injected with a solution, as many commercial turkeys are, that solution is comprised of water and salt...so essentially it has already been brined.

We didn't make the stuffing but the turkey was the best we've ever made. We were guests at a large party and nearly everyone came over personally to tell us how much they loved it! Like another reviewer, we added a little water to the pan while cooking to create more basting liquid. Also, it only took 2 hours to cook a 14 lb turkey although I kept the heat on high for the first 20-25 minutes.

This recipe is excellent. Despite the fact that the first time I made it involved 4 foot flames shooting out of my barbeque, the turkey was STILL the best I've ever made. (nota bene: make sure flames have completely died down in the grille when adding more coals before putting the turkey with grease pan back on grille, especially when using matchlight charcoal. whoops...) I followed the exact recipe, except that I added some cayenne pepper to the brining solution, and used mesquite chips in the grille while it was cooking (smoky flavor is an excellent addition) Further, the recipe works VERY well for chicken as well. In fact, I refuse to make chicken any other way. Be sure to cut the brining time down or it will be way too salty. The extra salsa verde makes a great maranade for grilled veggies to accompany the bird. A side note: the carcass, after you've eaten all the good bits, makes a wonderful stock.

Husband was a little intimidated to make in the grille for the first time, had issues maintaining temp but grille was outside. Once we moved inside to garage temp maintained at 350. We brined the turkey for 8 hours, all we had time for. Many compliments, not salty, looked beautiful. No drippings for gravy though. Will definatley make again.

I don't know what went wrong. Compared to the reviews I couldn't believe how salty this tasted. I was so bad I had to toss it! I brined it 12 hrs instead of 10 hrs. maybe that was the problem? Any feed back will be appreciated. FYI I'm not a rooky cook and did follow the directions to a tee (except the extra 2 hrs of brining).

This was good, but not nearly as good as the Honey Brined Turkey from Nov. 1999. The green chili salsa was an excellent accompanient for a southwestern turkey dinner rather than or in addition to the traditional gravy.

Really simple and delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was a perfectly cooked turkey that was moist throughout. I was a little intimidated to cook it on the gas BBQ, but sure enough, after 3 hours on low heat it was ready. I added chicken broth to the pan from time to time because there were virtually no drippings to baste with. The entire family loved it. I'll be making this one again for sure.

This recipe was so good our family now has to have it on all the traditional turkey holidays. We also have tried using just the turkey breast. It's also a winner.

Being foreigners (and from India) we aren't terribly fond of the regular Turkey meal on Thanksgiving - its too bland. However, this Southwestern Thanksgiving meal detailed in the Nov 1998 issue is spectacular. There is such flavour in the food - I literally pigged out on this for 5 days in a row - for every meal! Loved it and recommend it to anyone who wants something different - spicy and flavourful!

This turkey is the best! I have thirty people every year for Thanksgiving, and everyone loves it.
