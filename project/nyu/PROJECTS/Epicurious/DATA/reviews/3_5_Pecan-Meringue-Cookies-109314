Cut lt brown sugar to 3/4 cup as other reviewers recommended. Used fresh ground nutmeg. Bake time was 25 min. They are chewy-crunchy and tasty. Not like a normal 'cookie' though. Reminded my spouse of cookies made with almond paste.

These were delicious. Cut sugar,reg light brown to 1/2 c. Plenty sweet. Reduce nutmeg to 1/8 tsp and added the same of cinnamon. Baking time was 20 minutes. Will try with different nuts and spices. Cookies are small, may want to double.

Easy, delicious and a lesser evil among other holiday cookies out there. I would definitely make this again.

Don't be fooled by the short and simple ingredient list- these subtle cookies are wonderful and so easy to make! I made a tester (taster? :) batch to start with and can't wait to make more to bring to holiday parties. I made this batch with nutmeg- delish!

Just finished making a double batch to take to a party. Going to have to start another right away because we are gobbling down the first batch! These are fabulous. I used turbinado sugar and nutmeg instead of allspice. What a wonderful chewy texture in a meringue cookie!

I'm a huge meringue fan and love the complexity of these cookies compared to my usual varieties. To use heavier sugar without grittiness, you can make a sugar syrup, add a tbsp or two of water to the sugar, heat 'til boiling and bubbly then pour a thin steady stream into the beaten eggwhite while mixing. It's tricky, but you're guaranteed perfect texture.

one other thing- you don't need a whole cup of sugar, i used half a cup of brown sugar and they came out beautifully.

I got this recipe from the New York Times about 15 years ago, but there was no nutmeg and it called for regular light brown sugar. I have made these every Pesach since. Not only do my East coast family members love them, but my new midwestern "family" requests them every seder. This recipe is definitely a keper-just know what you're getting. The cookie is a meringue, so it lis hollow and crispy. The brown sugar and pecans form a praline at the bottom to make it both crunchy and chewy. If you're expecting a "real" cookie-this isn't it. However, they certainly are delicious and a part of my permanent Pesach menu. Enjoy!

I am really surprised by the last person's reaction - I didn't use the Turbinado sugar, but otherwise the recipe was great, and the cookies so light, tasty, delicious - my family asked me to make more soon

BLECH! Turbinado sugar should NOT be listed as an alternate sweetener. It never dissolved enough and made the cookies too grainy and inedible. I may try again with superfine brown sugar, but in the meantime, this was a waste of ingredients.
