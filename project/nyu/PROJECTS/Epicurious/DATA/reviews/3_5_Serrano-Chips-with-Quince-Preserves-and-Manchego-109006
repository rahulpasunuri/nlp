followed the recipe to a T. It was yummy and so easy. I crisped the Serrano Ham early, and prepared the rest right before I wanted to serve it.

yummy - make sure the serrano is extra crispy.

We hosted friends for a dinner on Friday and I made a lasagna, with this as an appetizer. Couldn't find the Serrano ham, so I used smoked proscuitto (baked) and topped it with some homemade fig jam. This is a great combination of flavors. I recreated it the next night when I was asked to bring a cheese plate to a dinner party. The Prosciutto is a bit fragile though, it breaks easily, so be careful about putting any pressure on it.

Very nice combination of flavours and texture. I used thin slides of quince paste rather than preserves (this is the traditional Spanish way). Instead of manchego shavings, I broke off small chunks of cheese and layered them on top of the quince.

What a hit! I used slightly thicker slices of proscuitto, cut them into smaller bite sized triangles and baked them at 400 degrees for 7 minutes. Had the manchego Cheese sliced ahead of time, so it was a very easy appetizer to prepare right before guests arrived. I should have made more... YUM!

I make a simple mango jam and use it instead of quince preserves and these are delicious. Everyone just gobbles them up.

had these at our friends' party a while ago and for some reason remembered it as fig instead of quince. still quite good, but i'm looking forward to using quince next time! served with a nice riesling.

My mother recently sent a gift of home made quince preserve and I shared it with friends by serving this 'ensemble' of delicacies. The market did not know what serrano ham was so I bought and fried mild prosciutto and it was delicious. Parma ham may also be a good substitute. The addition of manchego cheese makes a prefect combination of produce. ENJOY

I bought the ingredients to make this for a last minute gathering but found that I didn't have the time to fry the ham. Instead I wrapped pieces of ham around a slice of cheese with a bit of quince paste tucked in.

I compared frying the ham to baking it at 400 for 6-8 minutes and found that baking the ham was less messy and just as tasty as frying (fried ham was a tad bit saltier), so I opted to cut the ham to size and bake it for my guests. Everyone loved it- especially with Zinfandel-and it was gone in no time!

Everyone loved this dish except the cook. I got burned by popping oil as the ham gave up moisture while frying. The little triangles curled into lumps, so I fried whole slices instead and broke them into chips after cooking.Results were worth the struggle.

Nice alternative to crackers. Used Earth and Vine peach chipolte jam instead of quince paste.

I have made these a number of times for parties and they are always the first thing one... To the cook in Denver, Serrano ham, manchego and membrillo can all be purchased at Marzcyk(sp?) fine foods on 17th st.

Serrano Ham is from Spain originally, and is eaten much in the same way as Prosciutto. It is often found in European deli's-i.e. German delicatessen's. Hope this helps!

I think this looks like a tasty dish, but what is serrano ham? Ham flavored with Serrano chiles? I live in Denver, where I've been to many Hispanic specialty shops, but I've never seen serrano ham.

This was a fun and delicious appetizer. The serrano ham chips were an interesting change from crackers. I took a platter of these to a New Year's Day party and they were a big hit. Looked complicated, but actually very easy to make. Used much less oil than called for in recipe.
