Don't use room temperature butter, it won't blend properly with the sugar. Cream cold butter with the sugar, you'll need to use a higher speed (4 or 6 on a KitchenAid) for a few minutes. This is really great. Nice ginger flavour, and the creme anglaise was fantastic (I did add some extra ginger to it, because I really love ginger!). I added a bit of lime oil to the chocolate, try it, while ginger and chocolate is a good combination, ginger and citrus is a match made in heaven! Keep in mind that if you make these ahead of time and then reheat them, they won't be "molten," they'll just be a fully cooked cake with a ball of ganache in the center. Still tasty, but doesn't have the same flair.

Hmmm. I didn't think this recipe was that good. I didn't think ginger and chocolate combined that well, and the cake was kind of dry. The ginger creme anglaise was VERY good though.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. I loved the chocolate center, the ginger flavor of the cake, and the ginger creme anglaise. The texture of the cake was a bit too heavy to me. As I was mixing it, it didn't seem to come together well. I might suggest starting with room temp butter (rather than cold) and it might come together more easily. I used bittersweet Scharffen Berger chocolate which is delicious but the semisweet might have been better in this recipe.

This dish was a last minute substitution at a dinner party, but I will make this again and again. Who knew ginger and chocolate would be so sensational. My guests actually CLAPPED at the end of a meal capped by this dessert (the conversation during dessert was pared down to mostly moaning every time a new forkful was delivered to someone's lips). This recipe is easy and sensational.

Taste VG used even more ginger. BUT too much chocolate. Cooked for @a14-15 min.Added ganache.then cooked for @16min.Cooled @4min. Chocolate sunk to bottom, so basically no "cake" on bottom. Next time I'll cook longer before adding less chocolate

I am planning on making this for Christmas and would like to make it the day before. Does anyone know how long I should reheat the cakes? I don't want to over-bake them.

Great results! The flavor combination of ginger and bittersweet chocolate was a winner! The total cooking time was closer to 25 minutes even when baking with the ramekins on a cookie sheet. I'll definitely make these again. Delicious!!

I love ginger and chocolate so I thought these cakes were fantastic.Tried them again with ginger ice cream and they were even better!

This is a terrific recipe! Do yourself a favor and prepare the creme anglaise and the chocolate ganache in advance. There is an important detail - be sure to place the cake pans on a cookie sheet, otherwise the cakes will over bake and become dry.

I cooked this in ramkins, came out unbelievably well. Had some batter and creme Anglaise left, so cooked another with just a piece of bittersweet chocolate put in the center (no time for freezing the choc. with the cream) and it was super! Have given the recipe out to several at the dinner party- big hit!

This recipe was a hit at a family Valentine dinner. The only problem, the cakes were almost done by the time recommended (20 minutes) to put the ganache in the cakes. The ganache should be added at about 5 minutes after inserting the cakes into the oven.

Fabulous. Gave the recipe out. Rather challenging to prepare. I only had one problem -- the ganache didn't get cold enough in my freezer, even though I put it in for the required time. I should have made it earlier. My sister says this is because I don't have a commercial freezer. I managed ok, though!!
