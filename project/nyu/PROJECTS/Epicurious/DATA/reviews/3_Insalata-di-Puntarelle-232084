I thought this was very good. I used anchovy paste as I had it handy. Refrigerating for an hour (I put the salad plates in too) really helped. I made it as part of the recommended menu for a very satisfying meal.

The traditional way to make this is best: with a simple dressing of anchovy, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil made into a thick dressing and served with frisele (hard Italian biscuits.) YUM YUM YUM!

This is a great salad - I used anchovy paste instead for less work w/ good results.
