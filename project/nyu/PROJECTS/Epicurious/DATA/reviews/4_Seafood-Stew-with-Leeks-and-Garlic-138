I saw fresh little neck clams at the store and wanted to try to make them. I found this recipe and am so glad I did. I followed it as directed other than I used roasted red peppers, red torpedo onions that I received in my CSA bag instead of leeks and I added Herbs de Provence as well. I didn't consider this a stew as others did, it was definitely a soup. We served it over pasta and it was delicious, my husband was very happy! I think it would also be delicious over rice. Definitely a keeper for our house!

This recipe is so wonderfully simple. I made some changes to suit my taste and it turned out really well. I added roasted garlic, more white wine and fire roasted tomatoes as well. Its a pretty dense stew so it turned out more as a sauce. I used it to top some baked acorn squash...very tasty.

Just as described... easy light and flavorful. Leeks were definitely the dominant ingredient. As much as I enjoy them, I'd probably cut down on them next time, to let the seafood shine through.

Good but I made it less of a soup and more of a stew. Used 3 leeks instead of 2, and reduced the amounts of stock and clam juice but kept the wine quantity the same. Very quick and easy. Would be good with monkfish too.

This is fabulous! Everyone loved it, from our guests (it is guest-worthy) to my 8 and 4 year olds. It's outrageously easy to make, and with fresh seafood, simply smashing.

Wonderful! Nice, light, easy, fast! Have never cooked w/ leeks or clams before but it was SO easy! Using leeks makes for a great alternative to heavy pasta and the flavor is light and can be made as mild or spicy as desired. My boyfriend LOVED this dish and said he wouldn't mind having it once a week.

My husband and I love this dish. It does need more seasoning for our liking. I add cumin and a small diced jalapeno pepper. I also use fresh chopped cherry tomatoes instead of canned. Depending on how hungry we are, I sometimes serve it over noodles. We also thought adding lime and cilantro would be fantastic.

Wow this is good. I would serve this for the most discriminating guests -- even those who believe low-fat equals low-taste. I did season some more than suggested, as well as use an entire 14-oz can of tomatoes, decreasing the chicken broth by about 1/2 cup to compensate. I also used shrimp and sea scallops, which cook in about the same time. Overall, a really satisfying meal that I cannot wait to make again!

we loved this recipe. i did not use clams, and merely increased the scallops and shrimp. i also added some oregano. however the shrimp did require somewhat longer cooking than the recipe indicates.

We love fresh seafood and this dish is quick and easy. The Shrimp requires a little more time than the recipe leads but the overall flavor of the seafood combination is wonderful. If you can't get fresh seafood you may want to add additional seasoning. If you are fortunate to get fresh seafood and the light sauce and seasoning is the perfect compliment to the dish. Make sure to rinse the leeks well, they can be a bit gritty if you aren't careful. This is a 4 star favorite.

Too soupy! I wouldn't call this a stew. It also needs a LOT more seasoning than the recipe calls for.
