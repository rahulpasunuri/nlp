I was short on the quantity of beets for the sauce, and halving the sauce didn't seem practical, so I sliced and boiled some cippolini onions in with the (well scrubbed) beets before peeling, and followed the rest of the recipe. Might not be the traditional recipe, but the combination was delicious. Tiny tweaks: I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, which was plenty, and put in two peppercorns and two whole cloves when boiling the sauce -- removed before putting in the beets/onions.

We've had these beets on holiday tables for generations. We used canned and sliced beets and skip the vinegar, leaving just the thick, crimson sweet sauce. It's a favorite for all.

I love these beets! I grew up eating beets from a jar, but these are so much better! I love how earthy the beets taste and the sweetness of the sauce. Although some say they reduced the sugar, I increased it a little just because I like them a little sweet. I made these for my dad and he nearly cried b/c they are so good! (:

Can this recipe be canned? If so do you have a recipe for doing? I have canned pickled beets but not harvard beets. Would appreciate any advice. Thank you.

I grew up on Harvard Beets and this recipe came close with a few modifications. I prefer baking my beets. Cleaned beets, wrapped in foil and baked at 400 degrees 30 - 60 minutes depending upon the size. Cool and skins are easily removed. I substituted fresh orange juice for the beet liquid and added 1+ teaspoon orange zest and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.
