I love this recipe and make it all the time. I have made it true to the recipe with its amazing broth, and I have cheated and simmered some scallions and ginger in chicken broth when I am too busy to make the broth from scratch. Both are good, but the tradeoffs are clear - the from scratch version is amazing and the quick version is pretty darned good. I have also made "non-ton" (just meatballs from the wonton recipe) and turkey-based wontons instead of pork. You can do a lot of substitution with this recipe as long as you stay true to the seasonings. That's what makes it delicious. I always garnish with lime juice and cilantro. Perfection!

I had fun making this soup and the flavors came out great. The pork filling was very tasty. Tonight i am going to make it with shrimp which i think will be even better.

Really quite delicious, especially the pork wonton filling (though I might add another yolk [or the whole egg] for more binding). I also added some garlic cloves and cilantro stems to the broth to give it some punch, which was fantastic.

I also make this vegetarian w/homemade stock (made from veggies, ginger, & LOTS of slow-simmered garlic). For the filling I use tofu (crumble & fry w/ minced garlic, soy sauce, chili sauce & other favorite seasonings until it tastes good on its own- if I make too much I can always put it in a wrap or something), add ginger, shredded carrots, minced water chestnuts & green onion. I also add peas or edamame to the soup. Yes, its a lot of work, but rewarding.

As a vegetarian this recipe was made suitable by omitting the meat...of course and it was delicious!! I crumbled up two mushroom/grain burgers and did substituted the chicken based broth with organic bouillon and it was perfect!

Exceptional soup; I used chicken stock instead of boiling the bones which is a huge times-saver. Also added baby spinach to the broth for more veggies, as well as soy sauce & salt for more flavor. The gingery wontons paired with the tasty soup was amazing and I had leftovers for days!!

Tasty but tedious. I also had to add a carton of chicken stock, since so much of the original stock had evaporated during simmering. I found the stock-making process wasteful too, in terms of discarding the stock meat afterwards. Instead, I salvaged some of the boiled chicken and pork, and plan to make a sandwich out of it.

Way, way too much work for a bowl of soup.

This is pretty tasty. To clarify the broth, double strain through cheese cloth or coffee filter, then add an egg white to broth and strain again. Makes the broth nice and clear. I used spinach instead of bok choy and made it Wor Wonton style with the addition of pork, shrimp, chicken breast, pea pods, green cabbage, water chestnuts. Sliced green onions, cilanto and sesame oil at the end for garnish and flavor. Yummy Yummy

I've made this recipe twice for my clients and each time they rave about the delicate broth and tasty won tons.

I decided to further clarify the broth by straining with cheesecloth. Since we're not fond of bok choy we used snowpea pods. The wontons were superb! Better than our favorite local chinese restaurant!

This was really good. I took a short cut using bought chicken stock and added soy sauce, lemon grass and ginger. I also added some thinly sliced carrot and snowpeas with the bok choy. The wontons were a big hit and I have made extra and frozen to have steamed. To make it a more substantial meal I added some hokkein noodles.

I made this exactly as written and found the soup bland, and I didn't like the bok choy cooked with the broth (looked and tasted weird). The second time I made changes and really found it delicious (the kitchen smelled great too). I substituted 1/2 of the water for low sodium chicken broth (about 6-7 cups). I used 1/2 lb of pork ribs and 1 lb of chicken wings. I added a couple more quarters of ginger, 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and 2 cloves of smashed garlic. The key is to not stir the broth (it will be cloudy) and to simmer slowly for a least 4 to 5 hours. I cooled & refrigerated over night, skimmed the fat and strained. I poured the broth into ice trays and froze (4 cubes equals 1 cup).

Yum! I didn't make the broth, but let some chicken broth simmer with ginger, carrots, and scallions while I prepped everything else. I then strained out the vegetables and added the bok choy stems and let them cook for a few minutes first. I then added the leaves and then the won tons. This was my first attempt at wontons and they were easier than I expected! My husband is a big fan of wonton soup and he was quite impressed. Will definitely do again. next time I'll make it "wor won ton" style and add shrimp, pork, and other veggies.

Agree with reviewers that would just use chicken broth with the scallions and ginger. The broth from the recipe was more time consuming and costly without a benefit in flavor (not my usual take on such a soup, but the broth for this one just didn't bring the cost to benefit! Wontons were good, I added some minced water chestnuts for texture as suggested by another reviewer and my family loved them. However wonton wrappers no longer seem to be square which makes the folding directions a bit off. So they weren't beautiful, but certainly tasty. I researched some alternative folding techniques today and it seems that there are several that deal with non square wrappers. So I'll try them on the next batch that will likely be very soon based on the hedonic response from my 17 year old!

This is a keeper. I used a generic chicken broth instead of the ribs/chicken from scratch method. I added a chunk of ginger, a couple celery stalks, carrot slivers, halved baby bok choys and green onion slivers. The wontons were a delicious flavor. I had enough meat mixture for over 30 wontons easy, so I used just 20 and saved the remaining meat for another batch. Next time I will omit the salt, altho I think this was my fault because I didn't make the broth from scratch. It was excellent. If you want to impress someone, make this.

Th bok choy detracts from the pretty, tasty broth. I would omit or, if you leave it in, cook it longer. The dumplings and the bok choy actually improved in flavor when I had the leftover soup later in the evening.

The wontons are so so great! The seasoning is perfect and I didn't change a thing. For the broth, I just took 2 quarts of canned chicken broth and added about 1/4 cup chopped scallions, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, and 1 teaspoon of garlic, and about 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. It was fairly similar to the typical wonton broth from most Chinese restaurants and took about 10 minutes to make. Highly recommend the substitution for the time/effort savings.

My son and I made this very easy recipe on one of our many snow days. The wontons were so delicious they were eaten as dumplings and never made it into the soup. We also had fun filling the wrappers with things like peanut butter and jelly, chocolate chips and jam, and marshmallows. We then pan fried the dessert wrappers and sprinkled them with sugar.

The wonton filling was especially good! wonderfully seasoned and flavorful. I agree with one reviewer: let the meats stew in the broth for a full 5 hours, then discard. The broth is rich, not overpowering.

I thought that there was WAY too much time spent on making the stock for a soup like this. I guess I'm just not a ground pork fan. If I did make it again I would maybe use actual pork pieces cut up to stuff the wontons. That was the worst part, the texture of the wonton stuffing. The broth was very good however.

I'm not rating this recipe, although it is very good... because I've found that it can be tinkered with to good effect. You can use this same filling, wrap it in quartered spring roll skins instead of wonton skins, and fry it -- in 360 degree vegetable oil, until wontons are light gold -- and you'll have admirable fried wontons! I made a batch of them for a New Year's party and they were a huge hit. Also, wontons can be wrapped and then frozen for later use. And I've skipped the broth procedure and used plain chicken stock, spiked with soy, ginger, scallion and rooster sauce, and all was well -- maybe not as authentic as the posted recipe, but tasty and easy. The filling benefits greatly from the addition of a small hot pepper and about an inch of lemongrass, both minced.

This had so much more flavor than any take-out that I had ever had. The ginger was so flavorful. To those who said to just cook the pork and/or chicken for two hours so that you can use it in another dish: Don't do it! Meat has only so much flavor, so if you want all of that flavor in your broth, than cook it for 5 hours, but if you want a weak broth with little flavor, cook it for only two. This recipe was great just as it was written, don't skimp on it.

I made this frequently last winter and will again now that the weather is getting cooler. Instead of cooking the pork and chicken for 5 hours, I substitute chicken stock for the water, cook the pork until tender, shred it and add it to the finished soup.

Not bad, but I added soy sauce to the soup. To the cook who wanted a suggestion as to what to do with the pork and chicken; I cooked the pork in the soup base for 2 hours rather than 5, removed it from the soup and marinated it in sweet and sour duck sauce. Right before I served the soup, I microwaved the pork, duck sauce and all, and served it along with the soup. If you cook the chicken and pork in the soup base for 5 hours, the chicken and pork will have no flavor, so to save one and serve it with the soup, only leave it in the soup base for 2 hours.

These are the best wontons ever! I've shared the recipe with all of my family. My 12 year old son even made these for a class project. Any soup base will work.

I used wonton soup base with minced fresh ginger instead of simmering all the meat and it turned out great. One guest said it was the best wonton soup she'd ever had!

My husband called this the best wonton soup he's ever had. This put a big smile on my face because he's forever dreaming of the Asian cuisine he enjoyed as an attorney in Washington D.C. My only change to the recipe was adding a pinch of red pepper flakes and a couple chopped scallions with the bok choy. Wish there was a recipe or suggestion for using the pork rib meat and chicken from the stock.

Easy to make and tastes like takeout. I used ground turkey, added chopped water chestnuts. Egg white brushed on before filling worked better than water. Added julienned carrot, thin sliced mushroom and celery. Yum!

This was quite delish. Well worth the effort. Next time I may add chopped water chestnuts to the wonton filling for texture.
