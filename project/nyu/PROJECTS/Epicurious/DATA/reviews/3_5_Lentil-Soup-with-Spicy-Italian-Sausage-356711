Can't begin to describe how much my wife loved this soup. We had this soup in a national restaurant, and loved it. I am so glad that Epi had this recipe. I do most of the cooking, and I appreciate its ease.

Both healthy and hearty tasting. Made it almost as written, except added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste when sauteeing the vegetables. The Parsnips MAKE the dish! I.......had thirds.....

Easy, quick, and exceptionally satisfying. A one-handed monkey can make this dish and impress even the most hoity-toity critic.

Wonderful soup! I followed other reviews and removed the sausage from its casings, and crumbled it as it cooked. I added a little more broth as it was cooking (I don't like very thick soups). Also I could only find a 6oz package of baby spinach at the market, and while I initially thought I would just leave some out of the soup, I used all of it. I think that it could even stand to have more spinach as it added great flavor and color, as well as being very good for you! This soup does have quite a bit of heat to it (which I love), but if you don't particularly like very spicy then I would suggest using mild sausage - if you want to kick it up at the end you can always add red pepper flakes.

Great recipe enjoyed by even my 2 young kids. I added more sausage - 1/2 spicy, 1/2 regular italian. I also did as suggested by cooking the sausage out of the casings to have as crumbled chunks. I added some pepper to give a little spice to the soup. As we were eating, realized I forgot to add the spinach. Next time!

Love this soup. I use mild sausage instead of hot, but it still tastes wonderful. I've brought it to 3 potlucks and it's been a hit every time.

Overall a good recipe and hearty meal. It was easy to follow, worked fine when halved (and even that is a lot for 2 people) and the clean up was a dream since it's not a lot of dirty dishes. The parsnips added a great potato texture with the sweetness of carrot... I wish we'd added more. My sausage was super spicy and made the whole soup kicked up, which I thought was wonderful, but be mindful if you make it for someone who isn't so "hot" on spice. If we make it again, which is likely, we'll take the sausage from it's casing to make it more the size of the chopped veg- I think that would make it easier to eat. With the sausage cut up in slices, you end up having sausage only bites and miss out on the whole mix.

I was very impressed. Once you get past the chopping it was pretty easy to make. I used chicken sausage and it came out great!

This is the best soup I have ever made! So hearty but healthy at the same time. The spicy sausage tends to increase in heat the next day, but in a good way. I made it exactly as written except no parsnips, (forgot to add them!) and used french lentils, per another review. We love it!!! You won't regret making this-- especially on a cold winter day!

I'm not going to rate, because I made too many changes. Just wanted to comment that if you use the full amount of lentils called for in this recipe, you will make enough for an army. I cut it in half, served as as main course for three and I think we can probably eat it for two more days... thank heavens I didn't use the entire pound of lentils!

Very good. I also used French lentils and uncooked sausage, and had great results. Perfect fall/winter meal.

I found this to be exceptionally good and simple to prepare. Very hearty and comforting on a cold rainy day. My family and friends loved it!

One of the best soups I've ever made. I used uncooked spicy Italian sausage, which I removed from its casing and crumbled into the hot oil. I left the sausage meat in the soup throughout the cooking process, and this gave the dish more than enough kick.

Excellent easy dish! I didn't really alter any of the ingredients, as such, but I did make changes to the cooking process. I roasted the veggies (except the spinach) for 45 minutes and then added them to the cooked sausage. Instead of brown lentils, I used French lentils because they are tastier and retain their texture instead of turning into mush. My "Italian Seasoning" consisted of dried rosemary, fennel seeds, oregano and basil ground up together in a mortar and pestle. Threw a splash of red wine in before serving, and ate alongside a crusty bread, and, of course, more red wine. A very tasty, week night meal!

Wow, this was great. I had some leftover lentils and sausage in the freezer that I wanted to use up. The soup only took me about an hour to make, and I have lots leftover. I didn't quite have enough lentils, so I substituted some orzo instead, and I didn't have anything called "italian seasoning" so I went with: 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp dried tarragon, 1/4 tsp dried crushed fennel seed, and a 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Anyway, easy to make and very tasty. Highly recommended.

I made half a recipe, but it was one that was easy to half. I omitted parsnips because I couldn't find them in the store. The soup was flavorful, even without them--but I bet they'd still add a another good texture. I also thinned the soup with water instead of additional borth and I'm glad I did--otherwise it would have been too salty, I fear. An easy weekday meal, served with sourdough toast. A good staple to add to the repertoire.

This was delicious and easy to make...I substituted water for a bit of the stock, and, like others, threw in some red pepper flakes and garlic for more heat. The serving size is also accurate with pretty generous portions that really are a complete meal even for an adult male.

This is possibly my favorite lentil soup. I used hot Italian chicken sausage. I also only had enough chicken broth for half the recipe, so I substituted water for the rest of the broth and it was totally fine. In place of the 2 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning, I used 1 tsp each of oregano, basil, thyme, and rosemary.

The soup was extremely thick.I needed to add about 3 more cups of broth. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of lentils. This is definitely a cold weather soup and a keeper.

I think the adaptations suggested here were good ones. I too added garlic and a bit of red chili flakes. I also added a can (14 oz) of small diced tomatoes in place of the equivalent amount of broth. Gave the soup a more stewy texture and felt quite hearty. I think a drizzle of olive oil or basalmic vinegar would be a nice touch and I may try that next time around.

I have made this twice now- once as written except subbing diced hot link sausage vs. italian sausage, and today with some MINOR modifications....still used the hot links, added some garlic, red wine and did 2 qts chicken broth/1 qt beef broth, only had one parship so added a diced potato, and about 1/4 tspn of red pepper flakes to give it a little zip. I never measure out the celery or carrots- just sort of dice up what I think looks like a good amount. Overall,QUITE tasty!

This was a very tasty and easy to put together soup. I made just two small changes---used a mix of hot and sweet sausages as we don't like things too hot and took the sausage meat out of the casing and browned it and broke it up while the soup was in the first 20 minutes of cooking. Then added the meat in as called for. I think taking the sausage out of the casing was a good change and would do that again. This also makes a good amount of soup---plenty for my husband and me and enough left to freeze for two more meals for the two of us. I would make this again.

I make this soup as a staple for lunches during the week. But the thing that makes it sing is a teaspoon of balsamic added to my bowl of soup. Takes this soup to the next level!

This is really more of a stew.. Either way, it is a delicious way to cook up a pot of quick, nutritious meals for the week. I followed the recipe as prescribed, except I added some green chili sauce to kick up the spice. The colors in this are great, though I might add an extra carrot or two next time. Overall, very good.

I substituted red lentils. Overall good but not fantastic. It was a nice warming winter supper, and not hard to make, but nothing I would crave. I paired it with some warm crusty bread and butter, and found I savored the bread more. Oh well.

I substituted yellow lentils. I forgot to pick up Italian seasoning and chicken broth at the store, so I made some shitake mushroom broth and added a little more black pepper. I really liked it--the hot Italian sausage added a nice kick.

Just finished this soup and had a bowl with my family and everyone loved it! Used hot turkey sausage instead and added some garlic. It was sooo good and I will definately be making this again. Used the food processor to chop carrots and parsnips. Took no time at all to throw this soup together.

I have just returned from a New Year's Eve party where my friend's beau prepared this soup according to the recipe - and it was divine! We all loved it and gorged on it. I want to make it soon. The only snag is that my son is on Coumadin and i need to lay off of spinach/dark green leafy veg/s. Any suggestions what to substitute? Would leeks work?

I had mine with mild chicken Italian sausage so it lacked some pizzaz. Adding a drop of lemon fixed that.

I made this recipe pretty much as is, except I added more carrots and celery. It was a decent soup, but nothing amazingly spectacular. I won't be spending my time on it again.
