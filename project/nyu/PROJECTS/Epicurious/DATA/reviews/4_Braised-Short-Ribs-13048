Delicious!!! We made this for Christmas Eve dinner at my mom's for 5 adults, used clementine strips instead of oranges (and only half as much, still plenty of flavor, not overpowering), served with egg noodles. Wonderful, would make again. Note: cooked longer than suggested, think it needs around 2 1.2+ hours total to get meat tender.

I wasn't wowed by the recipe. I've made and enjoyed short ribs in the past, so I wasn't put off by the connective tissue, which seems to gross some people out. I don't find the meat too fatty (to the cook who skimmed "2 cups" of fat off of this dish - wtf??) Just didn't find the sauce to be as flavorful as others seemed to. To me, it was strongly tomato-y and orange-y. Not much depth to it. We took some other reviewers' advice and added the carrots and pearl onions later, but found that they weren't ready when the meat was - so you may wish to try adding the vegetables when the recipe directs.

Delicious. Even my kids (who generally prefer their meats sauce-less) had seconds! Some time-saving tips: Use frozen pearl onions and throw them in for the last 1/2hr-45 mins, and use diced tomatoes. I doubled the garlic, but that's just a personal preference.

A delicious meal. I could only find boneless short ribs at my local store but they came out very yummy. Also instead of pearl onions I used celery and some extra carrots. My guests loved the ribs. I served them with some grilled pineapple and potato crisps and it was a big hit.

This recipe is completely wonderful. I love making this on a fall day. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes. The depth of flavor in the sauce is simply amazing. I love this dish. As for the reviewer from NM who gave it one fork, why on earth would you do that after you completely messed it up? I suggest others ignore that comment and just go ahead and make it. You won't regret it.

This is a great entertainment for a crowd recipe. I've made it many times to rave reviews. Short ribs are perfect for elegant entertaining

This is a great recipe. Absolutely delicious. Only downside -- the grease. But not a problem. I used slices of light bread to sop up the grease. Worked perfectly. Before browning, I used Cajun seasoning which added a spicy flare. Served over rice, with side of corn on the cob and Italian green beans, homemade rolls. Dessert was Strawberry cake.

The sauce created from this recipe is nothing short of fantastic. The recipe is easy, and a wonderful treat on a cold day.

Loved this--and you could definitely taste the orange in the sauce. Served over mash potatoes and sprinkled with parsely. Simple, elegant meal for New Years Day. Did in crock pot so I could focus on taking tree down.

According to a die-hard meat eater, this dish deserves 5 forks. I made this dish for Thanksgiving the day before and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe to the T and the bones just fall right off. All 30+ ribs are all gone, but I'm saving the sauce for some other day.

Very tasty and an easy preparation. I didn't have beef broth so i doubled the wine and added the water that I'd braised the pearl onions in. It was tasty!

Would definitely make this again. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole and they broke up into a puree by the time I was done cooking. I can't buy Worceshire Sauce where I live, so I added soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, tamarind, and a few other spices as a substitution. It was great with those so I can just imagine how much better it would have been with the real deal! The meat fell off the bone in the pot it was so tender!

I would have given this dish 1 fork if it were up to me. I was generous because I made an error. I used boneless beef short ribs and made half of the recipe. My error was that I used 2--8 oz. cans of tomato sauce instead of the one can of diced tomatoes. It was too tomatoey and tasted more like Swiss steak with tomato sauce than anything else. How I wish I had made the "Recipe of the Week", which was ORANGE SOY BABY BACK RIBS. I had made the orange soy rib recipe about a week ago with boneless country pork ribs. It was SO much better than this recipe, and I bet the marinate would also be good with beef. I will not try this recipe again, even the correct way. Not my cup of tea!

This was a good dish. The meat was tender and the sauce was savory but not as good as I'd expected. The worchestershire and orange zest didn't make this dish unique.

Very good fall make-ahead meal. Used regular carrots rather than the baby carrots (often mealy when cooked, in my opinion) and added them in the last half hour or so based on another person's comments.

love this recipe in that it is so easy. Made double batch and served it the next day after i skimmed off the fat. Served with noodles sauted in chive butter, agood baguette and a big salad. friends just raved about it. i put a bottle of lea & perrins on side for extra seasoning.

I made this the day before I served it so it simmered for a very long time. I let it cool overnight and then skimmed nearly 2 C of fat off of it. I know fat = flavor, but I was glad to get some out. I also took the meat off the bones and shredded the meat. I added more vegetables, too.

Yum. This was super easy and absolutely delicious. My in-laws and husband (the usual victims of my experimental cooking) raved. It does need to simmer for a LONG time - this would be the perfect crock-pot recipe - do all the browning and such early in the morning, stick it in the crock pot, make some mashed potatoes or noodles around dinnertime - fabulous, without working up a sweat. The orange zest really took it to the next level.

I used all the same ingredients with a pot roast, since I am not that fond of short ribs. Big success. My family loved it. Great flavors--especially the orange peel.

Had this for the forst time at a friends....very tastey but I would put the carrots in near the end....thended to get too soft.

Very good. But took 6hours to cook on very low flame. Used only 3lbs meaty,thick ribs with full can of tomatoes but less wine and worstershire sauce. BUT ADDED carrots and celery to onions, and peas(no carrots).Served over pappardalle with broccoli rape and red wine

What a treat! I made this for supper on Halloween and we all enjoyed it very much. My husband and I agreed that it is well worth making again. The added benefit was smelling it while it simmered -- I worked up quite and appetite by the time it was done cooking. This recipe would be an easy one to tinker with, too. Besides the carrots and pearl onions, it would be simple to substitute potatoes, parsnips, whole shallots, leeks, etc. to tweak the flavors. A can't miss.

Fabulous! Best braised dish we've tried. Served with mashed potatoes, this makes the perfect, hearty winter meal.

Rating: 4
So fantastically easy and delicious. The orange zest was definitely a key ingredient. My only complaint is that the vegetables become too soft if you follow the recipe exactly and add them after 30 minutes. Next time, I will add some after 30 minutes, and then the rest 1/2 hours before serving.

Very good short rib recipe. I have made this five times and even the chef that lives above me how works at a five star hotel wanted the recipe. And this dish tast even better the next day.

These ribs are very, very good...I added a bit more red wine to the sauce when it was boiling down and threw some potatoes into it to cook when the vegetables are added. My husband ate all the leftovers before I could serve them again....and swears they are better on day two....Very very good, but not as good as the Super Short Ribs which are fantastic!!!

Easy and delicious. Used crushed tomatoes as another reviewer suggested...good idea. Nice served with squiggly pasta like fusilli. Will definitely be making this one again and again.

This is a great short rib recipe. The orange zest adds a wonderful dimension to the dish. If you do make it save yourself a step and use crushed tomatoes- the difference will be negligible. Enjoy.

These just got added to my "really good things to do with beef" list. Excellent flavor, and easy to make. One suggestion--tie the zest and any other flavorings you want to remove in a piece of cheesecloth before adding them. Everything sort of gently disintegrates by the end of cooking time, and you can't identify the zest to remove it.

Oh my gosh...these were so delicious!! The best short ribs I ever had.
