This was a wonderful recipe that went well after our barbeque on the 4th of July. Since many were mentioning the loss of the ginger taste in the recipe, I took ginger snap cookies and put them in the blender and used as a sprinkle on top. The ginger was a boost, and the crips of the cookies went well with the frozen creaminess. I don't know how much it added to the flavor, but I substituted strong, unsweetened, green tea for the water. Since I was making for a large group, I quadrupled the recipe which required 3 cups of water. I steeped 2 family size bags in this amount. If nothing else, the benefits of the green tea made this an even healthier treat.

I made this without an ice cream maker. Despite all of the home made ice cream nay sayers you will find online, it turned out great! I chilled the cream base and sugar base separately, then combined and churned with an electric whisk. I put it in the freezer (covered) and took it out and churned every 35 minutes for approximately 4 hours. Tasted great! The ginger and lemon are a great way to end a meal ;)

Adding vanilla lends a richness and a sweetness that makes this even more delicious! With a fresh strawberry/blueberry mixture on top, this is a keeper.

I love lemon desserts and when I found this recipe I was excited to make it. I think that this was an incredible frozen dessert. I followed the recipe except I used nonfat vanilla greek yogurt from Trader Joe's and just added chopped white chocolate chips at the end. This is definitely a dessert that I will make often.

This was delicious, very refreshing and full of flavour. It was so easy and will be something I will make again and again. I served it with a rhubarb crumble and it was a big hit with everyone.

oh my! i had a really hard time not eating all of this while i was removing it from my ice cream machine last night.... this is the best! i used european style non fat yogurt (from trader joe's) which i strained for a couple hours to make it nice and rich. used 1% buttermilk and splenda for half the sugar. i used a 1 inch knob of ginger i had stored in my freezer (changes texture but not flavor so great for this) and forgot the lemon peel. texture, color and flavor all perfect. i can't praise this enough! was a fabulous no guilt dessert!! i'm making a vat of it today!!!

This is an excellent frozen dessert. I used whole milk Greek yogurt. I think one of its secrets is that the ginger is an undertone, and I wouldn't add more until you try it. My husband would like to have it every night. It is the perfect companion to fresh blueberries

i was mildly disappointed in this, primarily because the lemon overpowered the ginger. it is indeed light, refreshing, and easy though.

This was so good that I have made it twice in 1 month. Definitely use Greek yogurt, so much richer with no added fat or calories. Topped mine with fresh mixed berries and it was a huge hit w/ friends and family. Thanks also for the review about not needing an ice cream maker otherwise I probably wouldn't have tried this!

This was delicious. Used greek yogurt which gave it more of a yogurty flavor than regular.

Perfect dessert for a hot summer night. Very light and refreshing. Made as is, it has a consistency of gelato or sorbet. I would love to try it with richer yogurt.

Excellent. Light yet rich tasting, although I used Greek-style yogurt and regular buttermilk, and that may have contributed to the richness. Most of the local markets don't have buttermilk, let alone a choice of low-fat buttermilk. This could serve as a basic recipe for other flavors of frozen yogurt as well by adding, say, crushed strawberries or raspberries to the water/sugar/corn syrup/ginger mix or using orange or grapefruit juice instead of water.

Delicious. Using non-fat yogurt gives it a more sorbet-like texture. I used Greek (thicker) yogurt. Next time I might try using 2%. Loved it, though, and should have used the chrystallized ginger on top.

This is fantastic and simple! We put macerated strawberries on top. Made extra ginger syrup that we used to make ginger-lime margaritas.

Easy and delicious. Mango and crystallized ginger a nice touch. Raspberries would be pretty, too. Add a wafer cookie and mint leaf. p.s. I used LowFat yogurt...

this is so easy - i made at my sister's home. she doesn't have an ice cream machine so we just put into a bowl and set in the freezer and stir it every 30 minutes or so and it worked out just fine. this is very light and refreshing.
