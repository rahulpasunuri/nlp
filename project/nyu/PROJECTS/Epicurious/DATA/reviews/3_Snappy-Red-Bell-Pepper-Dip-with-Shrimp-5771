This was good but not wow. I definitely would drain the red peppers next time and just add as needed to get a thicker consistency. It was kind of runny and would drip off the shrimp. It needed more Jalapeno but that just depends on your Jalapeno. Some are hot others are milder. I think it needs to sit overnight to let the flavors blend better.

I drained the red peppers and saved the juice, and added just a bit of it later. A very pretty presentation.

I drained the red peppers and saved the liquid and added only as much as I needed (about 1 TBLS) It was not runny and was delicious!

Too runny, not enough flavour. Disapointment.

I was reluctant to try this after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give it a chance - my husband and our guests really liked it. I served it as a first course in tall sherbert dishes,with the shrimp arranged in "shrimp cocktail" fashion and the sauce in the middle. I sprinkled the sauce with more scallions and tomato pieces. It tasted as good as it looked.

I made this dish for our Gourmet Holiday Party. It was rather bland unitl...I added a whole jalapeno, and some Sriracha Hot Chile Sauce. Perfect! I served it with broiled shrimp that had been coated with olive oil and cilantro. I would also reserve the oil from the peppers and add as needed. I felt the dip was a little runny. It was eaten with the shrimp, and then the vegetables on the table as well! Easy, and tastes wonderful, but needs to be "stoked" up!

i altered this recipe and it was a huge hit. i used jarred (drained) piquillo peppers which are a little sweeter and smokier than regular bells - a whole large jalepeno, seeds and all, 2 cloves of roasted garlic, about a tablespoon of marscapone cheese. yum! i used about 5 big whole prawns which i cooked fast in olive oil and salt and then added them into the machine with their juice as it was running. at the end i added some fresh basil. next time i'll try it with cilantro instead of basil and a chipotle in adobo instead of the jalepeno.

I didn't find this as drippy as some reviews. I'm using bay shrimp right in the dip itself, seemed nice to me and the cream cheese firmed it up. Perhaps some bottled peppers have more liquid than others.

This dip really did not have any flavor at least not enough to be served with shrimp. It was too think after I made it so I added some sour cream to make more of a "dip" consistancy. I was ok, but it really was not a hit at our party.

I made this dip for a New Year's Eve dinner and got mixed reviews. However, I really liked it! I added 1 additional jalapenos (probably the reason why I enjoyed it and others didn't-spiced craved palates vs. mild) and will most certainly make this again (even if it is just for me).

It seemed too thin so I doubled the cream cheese and added sour cream to help the consistancy - it was much better. Served with vegetables.

I made this for Christmas day appetizers- it did not go over well. Do not waste good shrimp on this dip- everyone preferred a regular cocktail sauce. It was so-so with vegetables. I will not be making this again.

Made according to the recipe it was very thin and runny. I would recommend draining the roasted peppers, retaining the juice and adding if necessary.

I make this recipe all the time, but I don't serve it with shrimp. I use it as a dip with fresh vegetables. Everyone loves it.

To make this quite a bit cheaper, I mixed about 1/2lb cooked tiny bay shrimp into this dip and served it with warm pita bread. My guests loved it!

I have made this dip numerous times and it's always been very well received. I increased the garlic slightly and I added one large finely minced shallot along with the tomato, onions and jalapeno. For a little extra zip I put in a some tabasco and a dash of worcestershire sauce. I like to serve it with both shrimp and cucumber slices. I also think the flavor improves with time -- it needs at least a day.

Are you people crazy? I served this at a dinner party and my guests loved it. I spice it up a little more than the recipe calls for. Add more spicy peppers to taste and of course serve some good shrimp from your fish market.

The dip has a beautiful color to it but didn't have the snappy taste I was looking for. Fairly unexceptional.

I really thought that this was so-so, but didn't deserve 1 fork! I wouldn't make it again -- it wasn't in anyway memorable.

I'm having a hard time deciding whether to make this again or not. I have a rule for company to either make something new or only those that have a "4 fork average" and this is on the borderline. It was a bit...pedestrian?? A definite improvement over the standard "shrimp cocktail" however. I am planning another party soon and I am looking for a better shrimp appetizer..

The color is gorgeous and the taste very deep, flavorful! I added more garlic and would probably make it hotter (lots more jalapenos)next time. It would be beautiful presented in a hollowed out red cabbage with the shrimp around it. I added olive oil to some left-over dip, heated it up and served it over pasta (shrimp scampi tortellini).
