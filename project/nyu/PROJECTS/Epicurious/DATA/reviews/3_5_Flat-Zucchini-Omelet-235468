Good flavors in this dish, but no joke about the salt. I used 1 TSP in the zucchini and that was all, but the dish was still too salty. Next time I'm going to try 1/4 - 1/2 TSP.

Note: as printed in Gourmet, it called for 1 1/8 tsp salt, so it looks like it was misprinted when put online. I suspect the printed amount of salt is plenty salty.

This would have been OK, but it was way too salty for all of us and I even doubled the amount of eggs and left the salt the same.

Oh! The salt! I'm extra sensitive to salt, and this actually made my tongue burn. The kids loved it, though, and ANYthing to get more veggies in their diet is a winner. I'll definitely try again as a unique, and super easy, side. Made with chicken and called the meal "Which Came First...?" Again, anything for the kids.

I love this recipe and have been making it every week since zucchini is in season. It worked perfectly! The aroma of marjoram is delightful. I did not have a problem with the amount of salt, maybe because I use kosher salt and not table or sea salt?

Waaaay too salty! There must be some mistake in the recipe. But, I am not giving up. The aroma of the fresh marjoram and zucchini together is wonderful! My first try was with one leftover raw zucchini, so I reduced the salt on the zucchini and rinsed it before squeezing out the liquid. Added no salt to eggs. Was salty enough. Next try, I used all the recommended amounts of ingredients, but reduced the salt in the eggs. So salty it was nearly inedible. Next try, I will use much less salt in the zucchini, watching to be sure it is enough to pull the liquid out of the veg. I might rinse it, too, but I don't think rinsing will help much, as the salt gets absorbed by the zucchini. Then, after mixing the eggs and veg together, I'll taste to see if it needs any more salt. I know I can get this right, eventually. I believe it will be worth it.

After reading others reviews I decided to omit the majority of the salt. I only used a light sprinkling on the zucchini while it drained. I weighed it down with a plate and some heavy cans to help drain it and then squeezed hanfuls and blotted them with paper towel to get them as dry as i could. I added a bit of thinly sliced onion to the zucchini as i browned it and then followed the recipe as written but again cut back on the salt to only a light sprinkling. I found it to be quite good and have made it three times now. I served it with a bit of thick plain yoghurt for contrast. A great way to use up extra zucchini from the garden

This would be real good if it weren't so salty. Next time I make it, I'll omit the extra salt mixed in with the eggs.

followed the recipe exactly except for addition of salt and found it still too salty plus mushy and unattractive even with browning under broiler

I followed the recipe except for the addition of salt but it was still too salty for me and way too mushy??? Not a good omelet recipe

If you have a pan with a handle that can withstand heat. Don't bother flipping the omelet. Just throw it under the broiler until it's puffy.

Yum. I had to substitute a crookneck squash and basil for the zucchini and marjoram, but it was still delicious. I took other reviewers' advice and didn't add any salt other than what was used to drain the squash. I did add some onion. I served it with a little yochee (drained yogurt) and a baby green salad with grape tomatoes. Not too bad!!

I followed the recipe except I didn't add the salt after draining the zucchini. I felt it was still overwhelmingly salty. I would cut the salt needed to sweat the zucchini in half just to be safe.

Loved this savory dish for brunch or dinner. Added a finely diced shallot to the grated zucchini. Added a pinch of cracked red pepper. Didn't have plain marjoram on hand but Italian Seasoning which contained marjoram worked just as well. Served with sour cream and salsa. Delicious.

Fabulous lunch dish. So simple, and the flavors shine. A little crusty bread, a salad of greens tossed with olive oil, salt and a splash of red wine vinegar, and voila'! Most impressive.

I made this for lunch but had to use Egg beaters and I added a little onion. I will make this again and again. Served it with a tomatoe salad and a little crusty bread.

Deliciously simple. Followed the instructions as written. Worth the time it took to prepare. Will definitely make again.

I had some zucchinis that weren't going to be good for long, so this seemed like a great idea. I'll make it again - but leave out A LOT of salt. It was almost inedible with the amount of salt the recipe called for.

This is a new twist on an old Italian dish called Kakootz (sp?). I just very thinly slice the zucchini and pile it in a pan with olive oil and cook till the water is out and it is somewhat brown. Then, in go the two beaten eggs and they get scrambled in the same pan. This recipe is a nice variation on an old favorite. I've always used it as a side dish.

This is just like the Zucchini patties we make. Same thing, just split into several "patties". I like to add onions and a bit of curry for extra flavor. But it's great just plain too. Usually make a big batch and make half with onions & curry, half plain. We like the patties cold too. Makes a great, healthy snack.

Great recipe. I added onions to it. Delicious. I usually serve this for a light dinner, but I've also made it for lunch. It always gets rave reviews and people ask for the recipe.

I adore this simple, yet elegant and smoothly luscious, zucchini omelet. I've made it twice and have just purchased more zucchini in order to make it a few more times. Other than the sprinkling of salt, which I only used to sweat out the water initially, I made it exactly as directed. A perfect light dinner with a salad and so easy, since I grow marjoram in my garden every summer just to make panzanella. Now I have another summer fav.

WOW! This was good! I made it for 2 people in individual servings. The zucchini was less than was called for by just a bit and I did not add the extra salt after draining since neither one of us are big salt eaters. It was plenty salty enough. I think this would make a great starter, about 1/4 of 1 serving along with some baby salad greens. A definite keeper!

I can't believe how easy this was, and it was so delicious. My husband described it as "sexy" food. Meltingly tender is a good description. The leftovers were great this morning too. I doubled the recipe and made it in a larger pan to serve four. I'll definitely make this again.

I added 1/2 cup of chopped mung bean sprouts to the recipe. The omelet tasted light and fluffy and will certainly become a regular in my cooking efforts.
