Great recipe- only made one small change. Did not have fresh whole wheat flour so I substituted 1/2 half white flour and 1/2 flax seed meal. I was very happy with the results.

OK, I have to admit they were better 2 days later. The whole wheat wasn't so overpowereing and the butter stood out more. Had 3 requests for the recipe from coworkers!

I was quite disappointed when I saw my cookie next to the picture of what they're supposed to look like...mine were not pretty. I agree with the other person who said what a waste of good butter. Dry.

Without a doubt, the worst cookies that I've ever made. What a waste of good butter. The first time that I made cookies and there they still sit. Nutty flavor is interesting, but not enough to actually finish a cookie. There a much better shortbread recipes. Don't bother with this one. F-

These were very good and got raves at my dinner party and again the next day at work. The dough was a bit sandy and had to be patted and squeezed into balls. I used black raspberry jam and it was a wonderful foil to the earthy,nutty whole wheat. I didn't feel like these were "healthy" tasting because clearly with a little less than 1 Tbl of butter per cookie, they are not healthy. try them!

Truly - the worst cookie I've ever made (and I've literally made hundreds over my career). I threw them away after baking a couple of sheet pans-full and tasting them (warm and cooled, to see if the flavor profile resolved into something edible). FWIW, the texture was quite nice. Unless you CRAVE the taste of whole wheat flour - this is a terribly overpowering flavor for a cookie. This recipe would take so much tweaking... it'd end up being a completely different recipe. I tried it because of the reviews and thought that I should put aside my skepticism of 100% whole wheat flour in anything. Absolutely don't recommend this as a cookie recipe unless you feel obligated to "eat healthy" (read: willing to sacrifice the awesomeness that are cookies for a "healthy" bite.)

I followed the advice of another reviewer and made them smaller. Unfortunately, mine flattened out in the oven, but were still very very tasty. I used only raspberry preserves. Would try again with the finer whole wheat flour next time. Maybe that would have an influence on the consistency as well.

Just made these with peach preserves and they are wonderful. Thank you for the great cookie recipe, I will be making these again.

Great recipe! As other reviews have stated, the cookies are not sweet -- which I really liked. If you wanted to make a sweeter cookie the best thing is to use a jam/jelly that is really sweet. For examples, I used blackberry and apricot and enjoyed the blackberry ones a little better because they had just a touch more sweetness -- just a good balance. Next time I make these I will make them smaller so the jelly is more prominant.

These came together easily and were very tasty. They aren't sweet, so, I wouldn't suggest reducing the sugar as one reviewer did and I do agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the ingredients matters here. My husband is the one with the sweet tooth and I could tell that he liked, but didn't love, them. I don't have much of a sweet tooth and I think that's why i liked them. I think they would be a nice addition to baby or bridal shower platter and would warm up an afternoon coffee or tea. I used a four fruit blend and would probably use it, or another sweet fruit, again. Well written recipe.

Outstanding, but with so few ingredients, the quality really counts. I used Hodgson Mills Old Fashioned whole wheat flour and gourmet French preserves in several flavors. Even orange marmalade was good, but the best were blueberry and raspberry-pomegranate. These are a slightly healthier twist on the old thumbprint or jewel cookies. Note that if you use old-fashioned style ww flour, the dough will be grainier, and the finished cookies will be more rustic than in the picture.

These turned out quite well. However, I almost never make a recipe as is, and this was no exception. I reduced the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup walnut meal. I also added 1/4 teaspoon dried sage, and used apricot preserves rather than raspberry jam. The result was crumbly, delicious, and rich. Next time I'll substitute a little basil for the sage, and use lemon curd instead of apricot preserves. A good recipe to use as a base for experimenting with your own favorite flavors.
