Very good made with a mixture of sweet red, green, Cubanelle and hot banana peppers.

Made for brunch today and this is a very good, healthy and flavorful recipe. Colorful too! I didn't change a thing. You could substitue goat or another cheese for the feta for a change.

It's also the same as a recipe made in Israel called "Shakshooka."

The pepper mixture in this dish is almost identical to the hungarian staple "lesco" - the only difference being a very generous amount of paprika. I recommend the addition to anyone who likes this dish (however, i personally prefer to poach the eggs separately).

This was so easy and so very good. It is especially good when you have had lucnh out and want a light and healthy dinner. I used non-fat feta and it was great. It will be a stand by for us.
