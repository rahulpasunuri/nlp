Overall, a nice recipe, but not particularly bold in flavor. We tried it with the added ricotta, as well as, some fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, and extra seasoning. Next time I'll try a stronger mix of cheeses.

Added about 1/2 cup of ricotta (I just happened to have some around), split between the layers, which spread out the fontina better and really added some texture.

Very good and different. Was lovely with a light salad. I didn't have an 11x7 dish so used a 9x9 square dish with the same results.

Admittedly, this could have been my fault..everyone else seemed to really enjoy this recipe (that's why I made it) But I found it a little bland and greasy. The fontina I bought in Little Italy was expensive so perhaps that added to my disappointment.

This recipe was very good... I used a smoked fontina that I had on hand, and was very happy with the results...I cooked the pasta a little longer than recommended because of altitude... I will make again....

This is a wonderful side dish, and easy to make. Fontina can be a bit more expensive than an average cheese, but worth it once and awhile!

I loved this recipe! It's a great side dish for any meal, simple, but flavorful. Fontina is a harder cheese than Mozzerella or others commonly used in pasta dishes, so it takes sometime to melt. I added basil to the oregano and thought it was delicious.
