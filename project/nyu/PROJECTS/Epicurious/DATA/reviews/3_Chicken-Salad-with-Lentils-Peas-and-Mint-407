Hmmmm. Well, it's interesting. But the flavors don't really seem to meld together. I followed the recipe exactly. I won't make it again.

A great blend of textures and tastes. We didn't use curry powder b/c my husband hates curry powder more than anything else in the world. I used lemon pepper instead. I served it to company, and they were very impressed. I do wish that I had added some tabasco sauce to give it a bit more spice, and the vinegary flavor would have been a good addition.

Really good salad and very easy to make. This is a perfect dish to make a day ahead or to take to another persons house for a potluck or buffet dinner. The varied tastes of each of the ingredients mixed together is great on the palate.

great recipe, but i'd make some modifications next time. first, i'd marinate the chicken in plain yogurt, maybe a little garlic and mint, overnight. then dredge them in a mixed curry powder. also, would probably replace the asian pear with red potatoes, and add them at the cauliflower/pea stage. the pear was nice, but i might mix it in per-serving rather than to the entire salad, esp. if it looks like you'll have leftovers. (and you may, because this serves 6-8 very generous lunch portions!) it turned brown, mushy and bland. watercress adds great flavor, but can be such a pain to prepare. maybe escarole or mesclun next time. i served with puppadum i found at ethnic grocer here, with watermelon, mint tea and pistachio ice cream.

Tasty and nutritious. I just served it over greens and it tasted fine. I may add more mint next time.
