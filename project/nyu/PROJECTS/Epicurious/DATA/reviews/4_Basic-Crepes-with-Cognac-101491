Really great basic recipes for crepes. I use a trick my grandmother taught me and fold in some of the egg whites whisked to soft peaks in the batter to make it extra light and fluffy.

SO GOOD! Subtly fragrant and sweet, the perfect vehicle for fillings. Folded brown sugared pears in, topped with whipped cream. Drool.

First time (successfully) making crepes, this recipe was foolproof. I drizzled the crepes with my warmed homemade orange marmalade.

Ridiculously amazing! I used 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of brandy because I didn't have lemons or vanilla beans, but they still came out perfect. The assembly line procedure helped a ton. Smaller pan first, loosen the edges a bit, then flip onto a larger cast iron skillet. Threw some paper thin apple slices and cinnamon sugar on it, folded up the sides, and scooped it off the skillet onto a plate. Couldn't have been easier. My boyfriend was moaning in ecstasy with every bite.

these are a wonderful staple - I made them without cognac, and they were splendid.

This is a classic crepe recipe which can form the base for a number of versatile fillings. James Beard is once again spot on!

Magnifique! These crepes couldn't be easier to make and they taste great plain or with the filling of your choice. I make them with Poire William cognac.

VERY tasty - this has become my standard crepe recipe. Cooks up just right and tastes great with everything I've eaten with it so far... though some of them are always eaten straight.

Best crepe recipe I've tried. I made it exactly as written. The lemon zest makes it!

Great! Fail-proof since the crepes turned out perfect despite it being my first time, and I made these in a small wok! Husband was very impressed!

This is a great crepe recipe. I also just dumped everything in a blender (after sifting the dry ingredients). Perfect crepes! I served them with Nutella.

A hit! I made this using the grated vanilla bean and grand marnier...then filled the crepes with sliced bananas and strawberries and nutella...Made it for some friends and get constant requests to make then again.

I've been waiting for a recipe that matches the crepes I had in France... this one is definitely it! I replaced the cognac with B&B and used a bit of both the lemon and the vanilla bean, and paired it with some nutella and sliced bananas. A real hit with the family--I'll be making them again soon.

I made this, substituting grated orange rind for the lemon peel,for a couple who are crepe afficionados. They ate them plain and the wife pronounced these the best crepes she had ever had, "even better than those in French creperies." I think I would try making Crepes Suzette with these next time. I made the batter in a blender (just dumped everything in,) stored it in the fridge in the blender jar, then re-blended it quickly before making the crepes. For making the crepes, I streamlined the procedure which made everything go much faster: I used two pans, one slightly larger than the other. I made each crepe in the smaller pan first, then flipped it onto the larger pan (heated on a different burner.) This way the flipping was much easier and then I was able to use the small pan for the next crepe while the first crepe's second side is cooking. I was able to use my hands (wearing disposable gloves) to lift up the crepes without needing to use spatulas , which made everything even faster.

Wonderful success with this recipe. Found using electric mixer facilitated the initial blending of dry ingredients with the eggs. Also have substituted B & B or Grand Marnier which subtely changes the flavor. Great with sauteed sea scallops, shrimp and alfredo sauce for main dish; bananas, peaches, blue berries and a little maple syrup for dessert.

Am I allowed to review this even though I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand? I had to omit the lemon zest/vanilla bean. I also had to replace the milk with soy milk and replace the cognac with amaretto. Even so, it was good and everyone finished them off. BTW, it was hard (literally) to mix the eggs one at a time into the dry ingredients. Why is that better than adding all three eggs at once?

I used this recepie to make Bananas Foster. Since I didn't have cognac I substituted rum and banana liquer. Also, I didn't have time to let the batter sit for an hour or two before making the crepes, but they turned out great anyway. They were easy to make, suprisingly forgiving of my poor fliping tecnique, and the leftovers microwaved beautifully the next morning.
