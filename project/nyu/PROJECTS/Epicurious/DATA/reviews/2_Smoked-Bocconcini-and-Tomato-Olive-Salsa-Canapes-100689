I was so disappointed with this recipe! The baguette tasted stale and the salsa was bland. It was messy to eat and awkward to put together. All and all there are much better recipes from which to choose. It was just okay and I would not make this again.

Delicious and can be made ahead! The picture on page 135 of Gourmet's September,1997,issue shows a pretty presentation - I used a similiar plate successfully.
