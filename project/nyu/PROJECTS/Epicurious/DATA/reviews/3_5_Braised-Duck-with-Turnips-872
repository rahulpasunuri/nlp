What a great dish and so easy! Followed the recipe to the letter but feel that you should only add the carrots and onions once the duck has been braised (the carrots and onions impeded successful contact of duck skin to pan!) We put the duck in at 400 for 1.5 hours (one hour was not enough--I had a 6 lb duck) My family wants me to make it next week!

This was a lot of work for a fine but not great meal.

Best wild game dish I've ever cooked. Made once with domestic/farm duck and also with wild goose. A little time consuming but fun and worth the effort.

simple vegetable flavors from the sauce soften the duck flavor. Even a non-duck eater would be pleased.
