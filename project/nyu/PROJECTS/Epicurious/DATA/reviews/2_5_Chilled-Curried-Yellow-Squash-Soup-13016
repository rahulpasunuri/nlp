I am always looking for ways to use the abundance of squash from our CSA and was thrilled when I came across this. The end result was so-so and doctoring was needed. I added the juice of one fresh lime juice and it's zest(I didn't have any kaffir lime leaf on hand or I would have used that instead.), 1 teaspoon of coconut extract, and a combination of fresh mint, lemon balm, chives, Thai basil and cilantro to finish. Having worked around Thai food, I found the original recipe lacked some of the bold favors and subtle nuances that I have become accustom to. With those additions the soup is sure to become a favorite in your house as it has in mine.

I didn't like this much. It's been sitting in my fridge for two days now. I definitely didn't like it the first time I tried it. I was hungry yesterday afternoon and had another taste, and liked it better than at first; I'm not sure if this was the flavor or my hunger. I've tried several of the cold soups from the original article in Gourmet--all were a bust, so I think I'm going to stay away from now on.

I thought this was just awful, bland and bitter from the turmeric.

This is a flavorful, low fat soup. It almost fools you into thinking it's creamed! The hot version of Major Grey's Chutney gives things a little extra zip.

I substituted vegetable broth for some of the water, and added a pinch of cayenne. Still, it wasn't as flavorful as I would have hoped. The sour cream and chutney added a nice flavor. I don't know if there are different brands of Major Grey chutney, but the one I found had the consistency of very thick duck sauce - not very suitable for dolloping.

This is a great recipe for warm weather. Very refreshing and it improves the next day.

I substituted 3 cups low fat chicken broth and 1 cup skim milk and added 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper for a little zing. Perfect summer soup. Very good, would definately make again.

Excellent recipe, ideal for helping to cope with another heat wave hitting the east coast. My husbando also loved it!
