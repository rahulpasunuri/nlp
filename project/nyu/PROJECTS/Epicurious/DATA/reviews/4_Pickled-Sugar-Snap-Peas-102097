This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I used tarragon from my garden and the flavor comes right through - very nice with the sugar snap peas. Some have mentioned that fact that these do have a strong vinegar taste, which they do. I will absolutely make these again and may play with the water to vinegar ratio in the future.

I do not have enough superlatives for this recipe. I could not imagine how a simple pickle could inspire such grand praise, but these are fantastic. We devoured them. I'm hitting the farmers market today to buy many many more peas so I can make a shelf full of these. My only question is I'm wondering if I can seal these up proper so they last longer. I'd like to ration them out so we have these treats around until next spring!

After freezing failed my sugar snap pea crop, I wanted another preservation method. This recipe does great! Like other reviewers, I used dill and red pepper flakes. My husband said they were good but too acidic; I thought they were great. I added a little extra sugar afterwards, which should cut down on the vinegary taste. This recipe is the answer for slightly over-the-hill peas. The starchy bitterness that would otherwise make them unsuitable for fresh eating is ameliorated by the pickling process. I have made more than five batches, and plan to make more in the future.

I used dried tarragon flakes, regular salt (wasn't sure what pickling salt is) and dried red pepper flakes instead of the peppers. They're really good, but quite vinegary.

These really were wonderful. I put them in pretty jars and gave them as gifts in a basket of homemade goodies. Of course, I had to try one before I gave them away and ended up making some for myself. Both times I forgot to buy fresh herbs, so just added some dried dill and they were still awesome. This will become a refrigerator staple for me.

Even when I goofed and forgot to buy some tarragon (used fresh dill instead), this recipe is wonderful. . . I don't know if there will be any left after two weeks ... like my predecessor, I keep "taste testing"! I'll definitely use tarragon next time, though, in order to use the recipe as written.

This recipe is great! The peas stay fresh and crisp and the flavor is delightfull. The best part is that these are refrigerated "pickles" and never become soggy or lose the flavor of the pea. The tarragon truly compliments the sugar snap flavor! Unfortunately, mine didn't last the 2 week waiting period because they were just that good and once I tasted I just couldn't stop!!
