I did the calculations and it looks like this recipe is only 120 calories per serving and 956 for the whole dish!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I used porcini, portobello, crimini and shiitake.

These were very good and I really liked the difference in texture between the fresh and the reheated mushrooms.

The perfect go-to recipe. Works well for family or dinner parties - rave reviews every time we make it. Delicious and deceptively simple! You'll have it memorized the first time you make it.

Made this as a test run for Thanksgiving, and it worked well. I did the mushrooms in advance, and that was a great time saver. I did feel it lacked a "wow" factor, but I think that can be solved with a little herb addition and perhaps some heavy cream. On the flip side, it is a side the a centerpiece turkey, so perhaps the lack of "wow" is just fine. Definitely plan to encore it for Thanksgiving.

Very good, quick and easy. Made it with Chanterelles only as that's what I had on hand. Added a bit of crumbled bacon at the end.

I have made this recipe for 4 different dinner parties and each has loved it. I made the recipe as is no changes. It was great

I recently made this dish for a party I was hosting. I was short on time and left out the porcinis...the dish was still a hit!

My family loved this recipe - even my 8-year old enjoyed it! Will be making this again!

Excellent use of fresh green beans and wild mushrooms. I used chanterelles and omitted the white mushrooms(forgot to buy them). I'm looking forward to making this for Christmas dinner.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. I LOVE mushrooms and was excited to serve this dish to my guests. The flavors did not work well together and I felt like I should've just served the wild mushrooms and the green beans separately. This was a big disappointment.

Simple but tasteful. Puts greenbean casserole to shame.

I followed the recipe exactly, but these flavors DO NOT WORK TOGETHER. Maybe with canned green beans or something, but otherwise a waste of fresh green beans. Run away from this one...fast!

This recipe didn't seem to bring out the flavor of the wild mushrooms. It was good, but for the price and prep time, it didn't deliver.
