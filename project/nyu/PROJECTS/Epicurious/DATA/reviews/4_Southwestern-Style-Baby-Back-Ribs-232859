This was fantastic - I didn't even need barbecue sauce (I'm trying to reduce sugar). Zesty and nice layers of flavor.

This recipe was delicious. I used scant tablespoons of paprika and cumin and added some extra rosemary to the spice rub. I only used about a cup of BBQ sauce, basting the ribs after roasting and letting them sit for about 20 minutes before grilling. The flavor was excellent... I think more BBQ sauce would have detracted from it.

I made this recipe for Fathyer's Day and was surprised how easy it was to prepare! I used pork ribs instead, and didn't have any onion powder, but they came out fantastic, everyone commented how delicious they were. I also used Sweet baby Rays BBQ sauce. Yum!

I made this recipe on 4th of July for a big gathering. It was so convenient, as I spiced the ribs, 2 days ahead, rendered the fat, baking in the oven the day before and then put into large tinfoil pans after cutting the ribs into pieces with the sauce. My hubby was able to easily grill these succulent and tender ribs individually. The 2nd time, I used a store bought pork rub (in the interest of not depleting my spice supply)and this worked well too! I used large cookie sheets covered in foil to render the ribs which worked nicely and again cheated a little by using a storebought barbeque sauce, but everyone couldn't believe how delcious and tender the ribs were. All of my years experimenting with ribs only to find a little pre-cooking and pre-spicing was the secret to delectable ribs. PS...my butcher had the extra large plastic bags that were required to store the pre-rubbed ribs in! Enjoy!

Although my guests really liked this recipe, I thought it was awful. The paprika and chili tastes were too prominent. I'm not sure I'd even give it one fork.

This receipe is wonderful. I have not made it with baby back ribs but rather with regular pork spare ribs. Taking off the muscle skin like material on the back of the ribs really works well. I have not marinated the ribs overnight, rather, made a paste with the ingredients, rubbing it on the front and back of the ribs, adding fresh rosemary, fresh garlic and thinly sliced onions. When using regular spare ribs I let them bake for about 2 hours. I use hoboken eddies barbecue sauce and let the cooled ribs sit in a container in the sauce for about an hour before finishing on the grill. The flavors blend well and the receipe is easy.

Hubby raved about these ribs. Said they were the best he had ever had, mainly because of the spice rub. Left out the granulated garlic since I didn't have any and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, other than that kept the recipe as is. Thought they would be a bit more tender but hubby said they were as tender as any ribs he has had in a restaurant and way more flavorful!

I like to quadruple the rub recipe--I add a bit more brown sugar and add cumin for a truly southwestern flavor--and freeze it so I have it on hand all summer. Since we're usually cooking at home, I'll slow cook the ribs at 250 degrees for several hours when using spare ribs. Always great. Try using the Bourbon BBQ Sauce from "Bourbob Baby Back Ribs" Its a GREAT sauce and EASY!

I followed the recipe to the letter (though I wondered if such a simple approach could possibly be exceptional!). The ribs were perfect--couldn't have been better. I marinated overnight, then baked in the early afternoon. Then at dinnertime, put the ribs on a hot grill for 10 minutes. They were juicy & flavorful. Serve with extra BBQ sauce. So easy to make ahead and take to a party/barbecue...I'm making them again tonight. Highly recommend!

I have to be honest, I did not follow this recipe in terms of ingredients, just in terms of cooking method and times. I made a rub of equal parts brown sugar and a spice mixture called "Emeril's Southwest Essence" and then I followed the rest of the recipe. It was killer good. My guests all bowed down to worship me, Queen of Ribs!

Had a great time tailgating the San Diego Chargers game with these ribs. I added garlic to the overnight stay.

I just don't like oven baked ribs that much. I did them on the grill. Added mesquite wood chips for an outpouring of great flavor. I also used sauce we brought back from Corky's in Memphis.
