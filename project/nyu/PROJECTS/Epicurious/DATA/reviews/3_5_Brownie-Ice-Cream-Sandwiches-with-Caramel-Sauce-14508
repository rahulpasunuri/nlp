Wow! This is great. Especially if you like chocolate and cinnamon together like me. I can't eat enough of them. I would serve them at any gathering.

This recipe was "borrowed" from my kitchen. I'm thrilled to find it on line.

I was so disappointed (especially since the reviews were so good)! Made brownies twice and was not asked for the recipe by anyone. Bad sign. Cinnamon was overwhelming, brownie just blah. This is just my opinion. I don't know what went wrong . . .

A definite crowd pleaser. Use better quality ice cream, as the kind I chose (about $4.99 for a half gallon) didn't really soften very well (it was either rock hard or soup). Also, try wrapping the sandwiches in plastic wrap to keep their shape in the freezer and roll the ice cream exposed sides in mini-chocolate chips to make them look even all the way around.

I have been making this dessert for years and it is a hit everytime. Don't use any icecream except coffee------it is the key. Yummy!!!! I think I'll make it tonight!!!! Careful not to let the sugar carmelize too much or it tastes burnt.
