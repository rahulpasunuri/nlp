These are a wonderful addition to your holiday table. I've made them several times. I agree with other reviewers who suggested doubling the spice and cutting the recipe in half. Otherwise they are way too big. But, do these, and your guests will rave!

How can you have too huge of a dinner roll? Especially at Thanksgiving, these are great.

Rating: 1
Terrible - heavy and dense. Pumpkin didn't add any flavor, just color. Even though we might have done something wrong, we won't try again. Not worth the effort.

In my earlier review, I forgot to say that I made them each about 2 1/2 ounces each (instead of the 4 ounces the recipe calls for). The original size is as big as a baseball which is a little off-putting, I think.

I've made these several times and never really been happy with the flavor. I think I finally hit upon the right combination: brown sugar instead of white sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg, 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 2 teaspoons mace. These are delicious!

I made these for a dinner party serving a pork roast and roasted root vegetables. They were very good although huge. Too big to be an accompaniment for dinner. I think they would be great as a sandwich bun for left over turkey and cranberries. The mild taste is more bread like and the texture is moist and dense.

Made these for our anniversary dinner. Used ground nutmeg instead of fresh. These rolls were wonderful but they were HUGE... next time I will make 28 rolls with 2 different pans. Great recipe, much easier than I thought. Husband loved them

I baked these as 2 big loaves instead of rolls and the result was very tastey and added extra pumpkin. It only needs to bake 5-10 minutes longer and slices very nicely.

These were intended for a neighborhood dinner party. They turned out to be a wonderful addition to a great meal.

I made these for our Christmas dinner and agree w/ other comments about the blandness. However, I thought it was a case of not enough salt and so I plan to increase the amount of salt the next time I try these. Also, I used a 12-inch springform pan and made a total of 16 rolls to fill it perfectly.

I really, really liked this recipe. However, no one at my table raved about them the way that they did about other dishes and a couple people didnt eat them. My kids are eating them today(day after TG Holiday) and they seem to like them. Here is what I think. They are not a muffin type roll so if you are thinking that you want a pastry, skip it. They are flavored in the same way that a rosemary or sage dinner roll is flavored with a hint of flavor but otherwise they are a true bread , and not at all sweet. I thought they are the perfect compliment to dinner. I think though that they may have been better if I had made them that day. I made them the Tuesday before. As I dont have that kind of oven capacity to bake rolls TG day,. Oh and some other reviewer referred to them as being like Challah and that I agree with that in terms of the texture and consistently. I think we will use the leftovers to make mini turkey sandwiches tonight with the cranberry that is leftover yum!

Made these yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner. They were very good and well received by my family members, two of which spent the first few bites trying to discern the flavors and ingredients; they guessed pumpkin immediately and after a brief discussion, decided on nutmeg. I also added about a T of chopped fresh rosemary which turned out delicious and not too strong that the pumpkin and nutmeg flavors still came through. I too thought they were a bit heavy but still liked them very much and found them easy to make. I got 23 normal dinner sized rolls out of this recipe. Used fresh pumpkin puree and the flavor was excellent. Will probably make these again but like others said, I would serve them with soup or a something lighter than a big turkey dinner!

I was never a fan of pumpkin, but I had a couple of small ones as decoration in my kitchen so I decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make (once you get to making your pumpkin puree out of the way). I had to use a broiler tin with foil as I did not have the right cookware and it worked out just fine. Great activity to do with kids.

So I get the feeling from reading a lot of these reviews that people were expecting a yeasty version of the sweet quickbreads people more commonly associate "pumpkin bread" with. That's not what a dinner roll should be! It should compliment the meal's flavors, not be the main show! That said, this recipe was pretty good. I cringed at the thought of using that much butter, and thinking this looked a lot like a modified challah recipe, did some research. Sure enough, it's pretty much the same! So instead of all the butter I used 3/4 cup of olive oil instead. The olive oil gave the bread a great taste. Also, instead of baking as it instructed, I broke off pieces of the dough and rolled them into thin ropes. Then I curled these around themselves to make spiral shaped rolls. I also braided some of the ropes to make mini loaves. I proofed them on a non-stick cookie sheet and they came out great after baked!

These are very easy and attractive with their golden orangle color from the pumpkin. But I agree with previous raters who think they're bland. They smell wonderful - when rising, baking and on the table - but the taste leaves a lot to be desired. I used extra spices to boost the flavor, but they almost need something sweet or creamy to match the nice texture and smell. I definitely had to serve these with butter, and I also spread on some cranberry sauce leftover from Thanksgiving. These have potential - we just need someone to figure out how to add that little something that's missing!

Made these for a friend's 50th bday party where we all had to bring a side dish. I found them disappointing. Bland, not enough flavor, and we all tried them 30 minutes out of the oven. I followed the suggestions of whole wheat, and white flour, adding cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Didn't have a nutmeg grinder so used 1 t of jarred nutmeg. Since I had so many left, I made apple bread pudding with a bunch of them (used Silk Vanilla soy milk) and found that was a great recipe! Brought the rest of them into work, with a jar of honey, and find them still on the kitchen counter in the lunch room late this afternoon. Guess they are destined for the freezer for another round of apple bread pudding.

I haven't tried these yet, but I made them yesterday (Tues) for Thanksgiving and I am pleased with the presentation and now can't wait to eat one! Happy Thanksgiving!

This will be my third year bringing these to Thanksgiving Dinner - by request after the first year. They are fabulous, and taste JUST enough like pumpkin (who wants their dinner roll to taste like pumpkin pie??) and I make 36 rolls with this recipe. The first year I didn't get to let them rise fully each time and they were still delicious. They are very impressive!

This was a great recipe. Nice and pumpkin-y. My only problem with it, is it makes a HUGE quantity of rolls. I would halve the recipe for a small family. 4 forks.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The rolls were good, but they had no pumpkin taste, even the nutmeg was fairly subtle. Its not worth wasting fresh pumpkin puree on these, use it for pumpkin raisin bars.

I always make these for Thanksgiving, everyone loves them, the house smells awesome and yes they are totally HUGE!

I made these this morning to try out for Christmas day. These are the best rolls I have ever made. I used 2 cups whole wheat and 4 cups ap flour like another poster said. I also made them into 24 rolls and baked them on a cookie sheet. I took them out of the oven, took my shower and two had disappeared already!

I made these rolls to go with our Thanksgiving leftovers. I used instant yeast instead of regular and halved the recipe and cut it into 16 smaller rolls. I put them in a buttered 13x9 pan and only did an hour raise (due to instant yeast). They came out perfectly and my husband said they were the best rolls he's ever had (he loves pumpkin). He also plans on using the leftover rolls to make mini turkey sandwiches. Yum!

Rating: 3
These rolls were great--unfortunately did not read the existing reviews back far enough to find out they are HUGE if you make only 14 as the recipe calls for. Could have easily made 24 normal-sized dinner rolls, maybe more. And used only about 7 cups of flour, not eight, and the dough was not sticky. Like others' ideas of adding more pumpkin spices, etc., if you're going to use them for a specialty bread item, but the amount of pumpkin and spice in this recipe is just right if you're going to serve them as true dinner rolls, meant to compliment savory food. One other thing--ate one of these about 10 minutes after they came out of the oven and, like other reviewers, thought they might be too light-tasting--waited another hour before trying a second and the pumpkin and nutmeg flavors really developed!

Any good suggestions on how to make these a little healthier? (That's alotta buttah!) Much appreciated!

I made these last year for thanksgiving, in one word they were heavy. I will not make them again for a large dinner instead perhaps for a soup and salad night.

Though I was convinced I turned this recipe into a disaster and ran to the store 15 minutes before I put these rolls in the oven (this was my first solo experience with yeast), they turned out perfectly and my family has decided that I will be bringing them to every Thanksgiving dinner from now on. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used only one stick of butter and 2 c whole wheat flour + 4 c white (and probably worked in another 1 to 1-1/2 c of white while kneading), added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon, and baked as around 24 individual rolls on a baking sheet. They were soft and rich and full of flavor - and excellent for leftover turkey and cranberry sauce sandwiches!

This is an excellent recipe...one that I have used for years. With just a few adjustments (for a Lo-fat diet)...the results are just as tasty!

These looked beautiful, smelled lovely BUT tasted so-so. Perhaps with adjustments, as suggested by others, these can be great. I will try this recipe again with changes as mentioned by other reviewers.

Excellent! Used leftovers to make sandwiches or for bread pudding. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe deserves 4 Forks! Made AGAIN and baked 12 (5oz)rolls to a pan. They were huge, delicious and beautiful. Very easy to make, knead the full 10 minutes for dough that is so smooth and pliable.I used my kitchen scale and scaled pieces to 5 ounces each for uniform sized rolls. I found that both times making the rolls, I did not need any of the additional flour and that flouring the pastry board made them difficult to roll. Without the flour they rolled so quick and easy. As previous reviewers stated, Perfect for sandwiches the next day. Next time, (as I will make these again), I will make 24 for dinner and make my guests the larger ones for take home leftovers. The only tweaking I did was to double the fresh nutmeg enhancing the "holiday" flavor. Try these, for assured "ohs & ahs" as soon as they are brought to the table! Thanks Epicurious!

Oh boy did I embelish on this one and the results were outstanding. when I first read the recipe I said "self, there is something missing..." So here is my experiment. 1) Instead of sugar use maple syrup 2) Use 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 4 cups regular 3) Use 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 milk-instead of all milk 4) Use only 1 stick of butter 5) If you can, use fresh pumpkin puree 6) Add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice along with the nutmeg and in addition: 7) preseason your puree with spices of your choice including salt...I seasoned my puree as though I was going to eat it straight including nutmeg, cinnamon, pie spice and maple syrup

I just made these rolls to freeze for Thanksgiving, and have to say I am VERY disappointed. My husband and I find them just OK. I made them small since a few reviewers said they were rich, but we didn't think that at all. There is not much flavor to them at all. I will make them again and experiment with more salt and more nutmeg to see if that help. They do look beautiful though.

I've been baking these for years. I make about 24 rolls and bake on a baking sheet. They're a lot better than the 14 rolls in a pan the recipe calls for, and they serve better on the buffet - with a homemade triple cranberry sauce, of course -- yummy!!

I made these for Thanksgiving. Cowabunga! Instead of the springform pan, I just used a glass baking dish and they turned out wonderfully. We will have these again and again!

I thought these rolls were delicious and absolutely beautiful. I had a few problems with the recipe, but am planning to try it again and would probably give it four forks after I work the kinks out. My loaf was not baked through in the middle, so the center rolls had to be tossed. Next time I will bake it a little longer than the recipe says. The idea about making smaller rolls is probably a good one.. they are very rich and such a large, rich roll is a lot to eat. Best served with a light main course like soup or salad. If you make them ahead and freeze, do be sure to defrost them completely (this will take several hours at toom temperature)before reheating in the oven... if you take them straight from freezer to oven you won't be eating dinner till 10 o'clock at night.

I made these the day after Thanksgiving, and my family has asked that they become part of our Thanksgiving meal in the future. Even those who claimed to only like pumpkin in pumpkin pie couldn't resist these! As well as being delicious dinner rolls (although not light), they were great for making leftover turkey and ham sandwiches. To cut down on rising time, I let the dough rise in an oven preheated to 200 and then turned off, and I baked the rolls for about 35 minutes instead of the 45-50 suggested.

Rating: 4
My family loved these rolls. A suggestion - the 2nd time I made them I kneaded the dough longer (15 minutes) and I separated the dough into 24 balls in 2 springform pans. The 2nd batch was lighter and the rolls were a more manageable size. The leftovers taste great toasted with the cranberry sauce with dried cherries and cloves!

Rating: 4
Very delicious! They come out perfectly every time. They are incredibly rich, however, and not for someone who is looking for a light little dinner roll. A definite hit with my family!

Rating: 3
The only reason I'm giving this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 is because of the make-ahead instructions. I froze it wrapped in foil the way the recipe said but it took A LOT LONGER than 30 minutes to reheat. I was afraid to thaw the bread first because I thought it would get soggy; I just put it in the oven fully frozen. Needless to say, it really threw the timing of my dinner off. Other than that, they were very good, though a little on the heavy side. The other reviewers were right - the pumpkin and nutmeg flavors are very light and my guests really loved them with the squash soup. (Don't try to make the rolls in a bread machine - I tried to but the dough is much too heavy and thick to mix properly. Kneading it by hand was not that difficult!)

I made these rolls for a Halloween dinner party and they were a big hit! It's a simple recipe (in fact, it was the first time I had made bread from scratch) and it turned out delicious. Crusty on the outside and warm and soft on the inside- just the way I love it.

This is a really simple but satisfying bread that will take a place of honour at future Thanksgiving feasts. But then again, this would be a great addition to any day's feast.

It is the best bread I ever made and the best bread I have had in a long, long time. The pumpkin is so subtle I hardly know it is there. The bread is soft and yeasty and fresh. It was easy in my breadmaker, too. I just popped everything in, put it in "dough mode", then baked the dough in the oven as directed. It is hard to call these dinner rolls, though. They baked into a loaf, a loaf that separates easily into chunks, but nonetheless it resembles a loaf.

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! My husband, who hates pumpkin, thought they were great and reminded me to make them this year! Incredible warm from the oven with butter!
