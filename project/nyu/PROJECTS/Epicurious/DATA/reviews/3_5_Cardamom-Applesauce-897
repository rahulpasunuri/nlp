I forgot to add that I only used about 1/4 cup of water.

I reduced the cardamom by 1/4 tsp. because it is a strong spice and I was a little wary. The recipe is right on, though, so next time I'll be using all of it. I also followed other reviewers' advice and only added 1/4 cup of the sugar, which turned out to be plenty. This is a lovely applesauce and a very nice change from the usual cinnamon.

I've been looking for an applesauce receipe similar to my Grandma's (who was of Swedish decent) for many years and this is exactly what hers tasted like. It's the cardamom! Don't let the smell of the spice deter you from making it. I left it chunky and put a dollup of whip cream on top to make a light dessert. Next time I make an apple pie, I'm using caradmom instead of cinnamon! Delicious.

A very nice applesauce, not too sweet, good flavor. My family doesn't like a lot of cinnamon flavor, and this was a great alternative.

I have not made this but just bought some cardamom on the weekend and my husband and I both think it smells awful. I have seen so many recipes with it lately but do not want to use the spice as I am not sure I would want to eat what I made with it. Does it taste the same as it smells?

Very interesting twist on the traditional cinnamon applesauce. Easy to make. Everyone loved it!

This recipe has been a big hit at my husband's office. He makes it every year since this recipe appeared in Bon Appetit several years ago for his office Thanksgiving potluck. Delicious and elegant.

I have been making this recipe yearly since 1995. I make enough to freeze for the winter. My husband and small children love it. Some modifications: I also cut the brown sugar in half, I add very little water and use either Melrose or Jonnygold apples. I'll be making this for my grandchildren!

This is a tasty apple sauce. I would use only 1/2 of the brown sugar next time. Instead of cardamom only, I used 1/2 cardomom and 1/2 cinnamon - very tasty. There was no need to use the food processor. The apples (with a little help from my cooking spoon) cooked down just fine.

I made this - and no one would eat it. What a waste of apples that we picked at the apple grove!

Very easy to make and very tasty. I had to double the batch the next time, my husband ate nearly the whole thing the first time. The brown sugar and cardamom add a different twist that is delicious.
