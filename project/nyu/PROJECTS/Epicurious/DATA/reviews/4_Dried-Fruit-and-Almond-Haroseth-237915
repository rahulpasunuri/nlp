This was so easy to make and a real hit. I would add more cayenne pepper for a little more zing, but that is a personal preference. Our group loved it.

It was excellent and a big hit! I made it without a food processor, chopped all ingredients to a chunky texture. Next time I will use a bit more orange.

Incredibly simple and delicious. Can make in less than five minutes and way more interesting than the apple/walnut ashkenazi haroset. Almost like a dense jam, yum!
