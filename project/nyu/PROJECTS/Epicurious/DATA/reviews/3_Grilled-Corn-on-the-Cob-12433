This is my favorite way to prepare fresh corn on the cob. I can't believe so many people on this site don't like it! Our homeowners' association doesn't allow charcoal grills (fire hazard), but I get great results cooking the ears over high heat on a gas grill, turning every 3 minutes, for a total of 15-20 minutes. The corn is cooked perfectly every time, and my husband and I love it! The charred husks impart a great flavor to the corn.

I think this is great, and don't understand the negative reviews. Soak, then grill on covered grill. Terrific! Better than boiled. I make it all the time during corn season.

A friend of mine from New Delhi, India showed me how to brush the corn with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and grill. As a final touch rub the ears of corn with lime wedges. Very good! She says garlic powder or even mango powder are other ways street vendors in India serve it.

I've tried grilling corn this way and it's awful. It makes the corn taste like steamed corn husks. There is a reason people don't eat corn husks. Yuck. we grill our corn by taking the whole husk off then grill straight on the rack till it's brown and caramelized, delicious!!

This recipe is very basic for grilling corn. However, they did leave out that you might want to microwave or steam the corn BEFORE you grill it. This will ensure tenderness and the corn will not be "crispy" as noted below (*from a review). Suggestion: Peel away burnt husk and top with a great herb butter then serve. Fantastic summertime dish!

I'm not sure this is a fair review! but... I was looking for a recipe for GRILLED corn on the cob and this recipe gave me the basics. I microwaved 4 ears of corn (individually wrapped in saran)for about 8 minutes. Then I let them sit for about 5 minutes. I then put them in foil, brushed with butter, salt and pepper, wrapped them and put them on the grill. I grilled them for about 15-20 minutes turning them as I cooked the other food. Fabulous results, great flavor!!

Grilled corn is why I love summertime. In Japan, we baste the corn with soysauce (Kikkoman) while we grill it -- the soysauce carmelizes to a crispy texture (dark brown, not black), and the corn leaves you with a wonderful aroma and an amazing taste.

The best grilled corn. Remove husk and silk. Soak in sugar water, (1 cup per gallon), place on grill, cooking and turning as necessary until about half black. The black(burnt) kernels are actually the sweetest. Remove from grill and dip in heavily salted water. Enjoy. No butter necessary!

My recipe is EASIER and more delicious!! Simply remove all husk and silk from corn. Rub generous amount of butter all over corn, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wrap each corn on the cob in aluminum foil and place on charcoal grill, cover grill so that nice smoky flavor will permeate the corn. Turn every 10 minutes. Allow 30 minutes total cooking time. Very delicious and easy!!

I like the idea of this recipe, but 15 minutes was nowhere near long enough of a cooking time for me... and my corn was only 2 - 3 inches over the coals. I ended up grilling for 20 minutes and then steaming in the microwave for another 2-4 to get the kernels to their full juciness. we loved the nice smokey flavor from the grill, but just felt the kernels were too crispy.

Grilled corn is the best!! I have been doing this way for years and will never go back to boiling corn again. I do it a little bit different.....I soak the corn for 10 minutes, then place them on the grill. They cook for 10-15 minutes then discard the husk and silk. This comes off all in one piece, therefore does not make a big mess. Careful....this can burn your hands...you may need oven mitts to do this. Then place any topping on that you choose. Incredible taste!!!

Very good. Plus, followed Portland's suggestion and remarks. It was one of the best corn experiences ever.

Try melting butter and chopped garlic; "paint" this onto the corn before covering back over with husks. Also work to foile wrap the husked ear, and extend cooking time by about 10 minutes.

Try soaking in sugar water. Also, charcoal works better than gas, but gas is far better than charcoal if you use smoking chips and lower your grill cover. I don't remove the silk... just trim off the ends. Messy? Yes, but easier to prepare and part of the fun.

I grew up eating corn on the cob that was boiled, then I tried this method. Grilled corn tastes so much better - the flavors are really intense. I agree with the other writers, use charcoal instead of gas. Also, I always sprinkle some lime juice & chili powder on the ears before wrapping them up and putting them on the grill.

This is the best way there is to cook corn. Grilling corn was one of the main motivations for us buying a BBQ. The corn is tastier if you grill it over charcoal rather than gas.

if the husk starts to dry out or burn while you grill simply spray it with a spray bottle (a great thing to have by any grill). This is a family tradition for me - we used to grill hundreds of ears of corn for the family reunion after the harvest in august over an earthen pit...wood gives the corn a great smokey flavor.

If you will sprinkle lime-chili powder on the corn after it is done ,it is great. We learned that trick while we were visting in Mexico

I had problems with the husks drying out and catching fire. I was using a gas grill, turned to the lowest setting.

Grilled corn in the summertime is one of my all-time favorites. We never pre-peel the corn and we soak the corn for about 15 minutes in sugar water since the sugar helps draw out the natural sweetness of the corn. We then grill for about 15-20 minutes! YUMM!!

It was to plain with no zip to it. If I make it again I would put salt in the water and some herbs.

Really good. I brushed a melted butter, salt & pepper mixtureon the ears before tying them up!!

P Counts is correct about grilling corn. No need to peel back husk and tie back up. Just soak and put on grill, upper grid. When done just, peel husk and silk comes off much easier than pre-cook

I actually have not tried the recipe, but there is a much easier way! Just lay the ears in the grill, husk and all! Leave for about 45 minutes (I put mine on an upper shelf on my grill) and rotate every now & then. Rip come off so easy and corn (if watched) crisp-tender. Great & so easy!
