I made this last night for the family exactly as described with all the extras: cumin, coriander, cardamom, raisins, mint and slivered almonds. I didn't soak the rice so the cooking time was about 40 minutes. I roasted the slivered almonds (very carefully) and they were a delicious topping. The combination of flavors was delicious. There were no leftovers!
