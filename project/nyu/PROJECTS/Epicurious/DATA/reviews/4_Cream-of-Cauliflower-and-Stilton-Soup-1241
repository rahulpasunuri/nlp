This makes a rich, hearty soup. It tastes like it contains a ton of rich cream and butter, even though the ingredients are reasonably healthy. I followed advice of other reviewers and used 1 cup white wine/2 cups vegetable stock. The flavors were excellent!

Yup, it's yummy. I went for both a few shots of tabasco and the sherry as suggested by others - and garnished with bacon crumbles. Very nice hearty soup.

Very satisfying soup for a cold fall night. Next time I'll skip the blanched cauliflower florets and garnish with some crumbled applewood smoked bacon. I think I'll try the wine substitution for part of the stock to liven things up a bit too!

I made this for dinner tonight. Only changes I made were to use an immersion blender to blend the soup and garnish with some chopped chives. It was wonderful. I'll certainly make it many more times.

Rating: 4
Do you like soup? Do you have an immersion blender? MAKE THIS! Oh it is so so SO good. The two foodies I had over for dinner declared it delicious after the first spoonful. It won't matter if you use stilton or bleu cheese or gorgonzola, I'm sure. I had bleu so I used that. My only other modification was to follow some other reviewers - I did 1 c. white wine and 2 c. veggie stock, instead of 3 c. veggie stock. I thought the wine was a nice addition. This will now be part of my regular soup repertoire.

Great soup. We used Gorgonzola since Stilton is hard to find near our house. The Gorgonzola worked quite well. We also used Pacific Organic Low Sodium Vegetable Broth in attempt to be healthier. We've made it twice now and I would not use Pacific again. Use Swanson. And like the other reviewers, we added Cayenne pepper and loved it.

Very nice. I too, skipped the blanching and simply pureed the lot. Nice texture, not too dense. It needs a little visual garnish, if you do it that way, so I added chopped chives and a drizzle of very fine olive oil.

Wow -- did not love this recipe. It was okay, but I won't make it again. At least not with Stilton; maybe another kind of cheese. And I like Stilton, so I don't get it.

The recipe as written is yummy. Best cauliflower soup I've had and so nice that it doesn't require cream. Very enjoyable. Made it with cauliflower right from the farmers' market.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe and foolproof, as all the substitutions by reviewers suggest. I used a cheddar cauliflower (neighbor has a great garden) and didn't blanch any for garnish. Also went with the dry sherry at the end and it does add a depth of flavor. The stick blender makes it so easy to puree. This does taste like a true cream soup. My husband was surprised it just had milk. This is definitely a keeper and I already have ideas for alterations, although the original recipe is very good.

Rating: 4
DIVINE!!!! I followed the recipe with the following modifications: (1) skipped the blanching and just used all of the cauliflower in the soup; (2) added 1/4 cup of very dry sherry at the end (after melting the cheese); (3) used leftover stilton crumbles and chopped chives as garnish. Using a hand blender makes the blending task easy (3 minutes) and mess-free. I was pleased to see the soup tastes even better the next day! This is going to be on my regular rotations of dishes to make!

This was very good! left 4oz of veg. stock out replaced with 4oz of chardonnay wine. couple of drops of habanero sauce in the bowl when serving. My son is a chef and he is hard to please, he loved it.

This is a wonderful soup--it doesn't even need the stilton if you're looking for a lighter soup. I substituted olive oil for butter, and reduced the fat to 2 tablespoons. Adding sherry at the end is a must!

Very good soup. Next time I will add a little bit more of blue cheese and even garnish with blue cheese.

Made this without the leek (as I didn't have it on hand) and went heavier on the other vegetables. Replaced 1/2 cup of broth with extra milk (because I felt like it) and added dashes of Worcestershire sauce, nutmeg and cayenne at the end - amazing! Especially the cayenne, as it played off the Stilton beautifully. I used the full 3 oz of cheese.

This was absolutely delicious. It's great for a chilly winter's night. I absolutely adore the flavour of Stilton/Gorgonzola/etc., so this was a winner for me. My three year old gobbled this up and asked for more.

Brilliant soup, one that I make regularly. I generally use gorgonzola instead of stilton, as the stilton here is sold in industrial-size quantities. I think any good blue cheese would do. Also tried the soup with a bit of sherry and think it's an improvement.

I was trying to reproduce a lovely soup my husband and I had in Scotland, and this worked perfectly! I will try the sherry next time. Will definitely make again.

I personally would have used even more Stilton because I love its sharp flavour. This soup got rave reviews from my dinner guests and I agree with previous reviewers - you can definitely go without blanching.

I love this recipe! It's creamy and delicious but not too fattening, the perfect soup for a fall day. I've used chicken stock and blue or gorgonzola cheese, whatever I have on hand, and it always turns out great. I don't bother with blanching a cup of cauliflower and don't feel it's necessary. I've tried it with and without tabasco, and it's great both ways. Better to just leave it out and let people use it as they wish, because it does make it quite spicy.

loved it and despite his complaints about "too much work," would make it again -- with a complete and correct set of ingredients, just to experience the differences. It's delicious, with creamy texture and marvelous subtlety of flavor. The recipe makes enough that we could have two lunchtime re-runs, great for stay-at-home self-employeds.

Super delicious and different! Be sure to use the right amount of cheese so the flavor comes through, but does not overpower. (I've made it with Point Reyes blue cheese.) I also recommend introducing some roasted garlic flavor, either in croutons or garlic oil, and garnish with more crumbled cheese.

This is great. I did use gorgonzola and swiss, also added sheery at the end. It is good cold too.

We replaced the stilton with Irish blue cheese, and the vegetable broth with 2 cups chicken stock plus 1 cup water. I also recommend using a stick blender rather than pureeing the soup in a standard blender -- much less messy.

I needed a vegetarian soup but was concerned about the stilton flavour coming through because I and another guest don't like blue cheese. It was fabulous. I was using a roasted vegetable stock that wasn't hugely flavourful so I added everything extra like 3 cloves of garlic, 1/8 cup of sherry, several dashes of Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, 1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and used 1 grated potato instead of flour. I didn't reserve any cauliflower for the top and put it all in the soup (nuked it first to speed things up.) It was excellent. I was surprised that using 1% milk was creamy enough and would not use anything heavier as that was just right. For those who liked blue cheese I garnished it with some grated stilton and chopped chives and for the two of us who don't like blue cheese I added a swirl of whipping cream and chopped chives. The other person who doesn't like blue cheese finished his in record time and was disappointed there wasn't any more.

Great recipe! I substituted a potato for the flour and added 1/4 cup of sherry at the end as one of the other readers suggested. The sherry makes the soup! It gave a wonderful depth to the puree and brought out a nutty flavor. I skipped the cheese and added salt instead along with a generous helping of fresh pepper.

Rating: 3
Instead of 3 cups of veggie broth, I made this using 1 can of veggie broth and water as the remaining liquids due to sodium concerns in my diet. I also used a whole head of califlower instead of reserving some as garnish. Even with my changes this was good! It was so tasty that I could have eaten plain before adding the cheese. The cheese adds more salt to the soup but does give flavor. I also could not find Stilon and used a regular blue. This was great and an excellent way to use up califlower when you get bored with plain old steamed cauliflower. I will make again.

I'm not a big fan of cauliflower, but got some in my organic produce box. Following others' ideas, I added worchestershire and hot sauce and Sherry. Wow! We ate every drop.

This is such a delicious soup to begin a special dinner. I have made this before and am making it again today as starter for Christmas dinner tomorrow night. Some tips: Be sure to rinse the leeks well to remove any sandy residue - cut first then place them in a colander inside a larger bowl of water. Swish around in the water then let rest a minute so the sand falls to the bottom; remove the colander and drain well before sauteing. I used some of the celery leaves and chicken broth as others suggested. Gruyere or fontina can be substituted beautifully for the stilton if desired. Add a dusting of grated nutmeg and sprinkling of chopped chives at the end. Wonderful!

A GREAT AND EASY WOW RECIPE!!! Followed the suggestions of others, including the following ingredients: instead of the milk and flour, use a medium idaho potato peeled and cubed into 1/2" size; no cream is necessary; use 32 oz. total of chicken stock, season with 1/4 c. dry sherry. If you want to cut calories way down you can cut the butter in half at the beginning - - and 2T olive oil is much healthier than butter anyway. This is a keeper.

This was really good, but very rich. I will make it again, but will look for a few ways to tone it down a bit. Cutting the cheese by a 1/3 would be the first step, I think. I loved this, but could not eat it as a meal. But it would be a way to "wow" someone you want to impress.

Great recipe! My boyfriend who "doesn't like cauliflower" ate two bowls and asked for more. I used homemade chicken stock, added 1 tsp worchestershire, 1 tsp Frank's Hot sauce, and a generous pour of dry sherry. I pureed it right in the pot with a Braun Handblender (much easier!).

My entire cauliflower hating family ate this soup in rapture. I did substitute shallots for the onion and chicken broth for the vegetable. Also, I completely omitted the cheese (the soup is rich enough without it), but I did float a baguette slice that had been rubbed with garlic and toasted with Gruyere cheese). Oh, I also added a touch of Worcesteshire sauce and a sprinkling of paprika per the other reviews.

I have probably made this a dozen times, modified it often depending on what was on hand (no leeks, bleu cheese vs stilton,etc.) It is always great, some homemade croutons also add color and texture. I agree chicken stock is best. Going to make it one last time before summer weather hits!

Time after time, this has been one of the best cream soups in my recipe box. I usually make it exactly as written (3 ounces of Stilton is just right for one pound of cauliflower) and it is addictingly delicious. After using vegetable broth, I tried chicken broth and decided it is superior. To counter the blah color, I suggest a small sprinkle of chopped chives before serving.

This soup was very rich; the cayenne is an excellent recommendation. I love stilton, but be wary of the amount you add. Too much can really overpower the soup. My dinner guests, however, loved it. Using small bowls, the amount this produces can be divided among 6 guests easily.

This was restaurant quality! I only came across this because I needed to use a head of cauliflower - I'm so glad I did. My husband doesn't like blue cheese so I used gruyere instead. Instead of putting everything in a blender I used a submergable blender - just be careful not to do this too fast or you'll have hot soup all over the kitchen! It was much easier than having to transfer it and clean a blender however. I'm planning on making this again as a first course on Thanksgiving - very impressive! A grating of nutmeg on top is perfect.

As many of the others who reviewed this soup, I too used chicken broth and also found a dusting of freshly grated nutmeg enhanced the flavor. I used Stilton and I think the subtle difference, sweetness and mellowness of the stilton vs. the sharpness of blue cheese blue cheese is a definite plus.

I prefer the [Gourmet] January '88 version of this. Replace the 3 cups of veggie broth with 2 cups of chicken broth. Add 1/2 cup of light cream at the end. It makes for a slightly thicker and richer soup. Without the blanched cauliflower florets, this is a great winter mug soup!

This soup was yummy!!! It was a very nice change of pace for cauliflower. I had to use blue cheese (no complaints here) and green onions in place of stilton and leeks. Upon reading the reviews, I too decided to add a couple cloves of garlic with no disappointment! The same review that suggested garlic also stated they sprinkled paprika on top which, by the way, greatly improves the appearance. In addition to the blanched cauliflower, I used some sliced green onions for garnish and color. Next time I might try a dollop of sour cream and if I'm in the mood, bacon bits to boot!
