I substituted raspberries for the raisins and used soy milk and earth balance instead of milk and butter. It was not necessary to saute it after baking. I'd add the "butter" to the batter before baking and not saute it after. Very delicious and satisfying.

Another cooking technique is to start this on the stove until it starts to set, add your fruit to the top, and then put it in the oven. Optionally you can brown the top under the broiler for a minute or 2 before putting into the oven. To saute the pieces after they are cut up makes this a lot more difficult than necessary. This way you can serve it while it's still nice and puffy. Yum.

My final product was not "puffed." Rather it was dense, almost like a bread pudding. However, this may have been because I didn't have whole milk and used half-&-half instead. Also, I was surprised by how quickly the cut pieces absorbed the butter in the saute-ing process. I only used 1 Tbsp of butter with the first batch. As a result, I ended up burning a couple of pieces. I used 2 Tbsp of butter with the second batch and used low heat. Those pieces didn't burn and had a nice gold and crisp skin. Overall, I think the recipe is promising. I will try it again with whole milk to see if that makes the pancakes more "puffed."

DIdn't bake it and fried the batter immediately. Gorgeous texture, so light and airy -- almost cake like. Just had it with some lemon and sugar like a crepe and it was delicious! A keeper :)

Subbed blueberries for the raisins and added some orange zest for flavour. Didn't bother frying after the baking and it was still very good and light.

The pancake was very cake like and hard to cut into small squares without falling apart. I burned the top while frying in butter too. Despite these mistakes it still turned out very good. I tried it with mango-peach-habanero salsa, and with confectioners sugar, both were good.

This was the best pancake I've ever made from a recipe. My breakfast party was a true success and I had to give all may friends the recipe.
