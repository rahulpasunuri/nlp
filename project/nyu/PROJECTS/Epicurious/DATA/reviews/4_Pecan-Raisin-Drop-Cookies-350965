First - the recipe does NOT make 50 cookies, unless they're literally petite four size. Expect to make around 20-25 decent size yumm packets. Since I didn't have pecans at home.. decided to use dried apricots instead which i sliced and cut into small pieces. Also added in some brandy butter. They came out DELISH!!!

Incredible. I used different fillings (chopped dried apricots and cherries, all I had in the house) but I followed instructions to the letter for the cookie base and they came out perfectly. Can't wait to try it with chocolate chunks and pecans. The saltiness was just right - I'm eating way too many of these fresh out of the oven!

This recipe was easy, and the cookies came out just as the picture shows, however, I did not melt the butter, but used a stick of margarine instead. Otherwise I made them as directed and baked them on nonstick silicone sheets. I thought they were far too salty though. I will probably make this again, if I'm in the mood for a basic recipe, but I'll halve the salt. And there is no way I could have made 50 cookies out of this recipe (only one cup flour!) more like 20.

This is a very easy basic recipe. I see lots of variations in its future! The recipe makes a soft, buttery cookie with a hint of saltiness. I used halfway melted butter and the cookies did spread. Don't go more than 2 across on a sheet. I used coarse sea salt and it worked fine. Tasty!

Just made this for the first time and they are definitely addictive! kosher salt is crucial for the salty tang that makes them irresistible (think i put just a teensy bit more salt in than the recipe called for...all the better since it really ups the crave factor)! Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins- prettier and tastier. Also will try exploring adding chocolate chips to the mix, or substituting golden raisins for the cranberries. Delish and so easy!

Delicious! Glad I made a double recipe. I whisked the softened butter with the brown sugar. Cookies turned out great. I toasted the pecans before I chopped them.

I agree with lagarta...I don't care if they're flat (they weren't THAT flat). They are delicious and I like the idea of using a whisk instead of getting out the beaters or using the stand mixer. Unfortunately my husband and I are eating them as quickly as they went together! Yum!

Wonderful cookie recipe. I followed the advice re: creaming the butter instead of melting it and the cookies came out exactly as pictured. Will use this as a base for other variations in the future.

Great taste but gave it 3 forks because the cookies were completely flat and look nothing like the picture. I'm going to cream the butter next time.

I just made these for the first time and sampled one warm from the cooling rack -- and was instantly sorry that I didn't make a double batch. So easy, so homely and so delicious! I used softened butter instead of melted but otherwise followed the directions as written. These are definitely getting added to the cookie-baking repertoire!

I just finished making these cookies for some 4th of July gatherings today. I took both suggestions, doubling the recipe and not melting the butter (I let it soften and then creamed it and added the brown sugar). They are wonderful and I used my small scoop from Pampered Chef to measure out the cookies. I got almost 5 dozen cookies. They are very tasty and I hope they are a crowd pleaser.

I have to agree w/ another review--next time I would not use melted butter. I am just not a fan of flat cookies. They tasted wonderful, but I was only able to get about three dozen cookies-not 50. They were very easy and quick to make!

I'm not good with cookies, but these tasted great! I was disappointed with the flatness of the cookie, so I'll take holly's advice and not use melted butter next time!

These cookies are wonderful! they made me pair together raisins and pecans which i never would have thought of doing, but am so glad i did! they go together brilliantly. the only thing with this recipe is that it calls for melted butter, which i never like using in a cookie recipe as i find it gives the cookies too much spread. but i stuck to the recipe the first time i made them and they didn't thin out too much, next time i would probably just cream the sugar and butter to give more rise to the cookies. also, it doesn't make anywhere near 50. double the recipe when you make it, i promise you won't be disappointed.
