I have made preserved lemons this way and the traditional aged way, and this is not appreciably different with regard to outcome. It's ridiculous to suggest that a reader try the traditional way instead, because this is the "quick" way. If we all had the time, we'd all make them the "slow" way. This is a recipe to make them quickly.

Prepare lemons as above but instead of baking, try using a vacuum food saver. Place prepared lemons in a vacuum container or large canning jar (if you have an attachment), cover with lemon juice, remove air from container with the food saver, let sit a couple of hours. Release the vacuum in the containter, reseal and let stand for a few days. The use of the sealer vs. the baking method preserves a fresher brighter lemon flavor.

Having decided at the last minute to feature a dish at a dinner party which required preserved lemons, I used this. Okay, honesty is the best policy, I've never before tasted preserved lemons, so I have no benchmark with which to compare. However, these were super easy to make, did the job in the recipe, and are now gracing my frig for use in future recipies. What can I say? If I make preserved lemons the orthodox way and they are superior, I'll be certain to update this review.

I have been looking for preserved lime recipes; I make them from a SriLankan recipe from my mother-in-law. Also now making the preserved lemon, and it is wonderful.

i have not made this recipe yet, but i'm curious as to the bitterness of the brine and possibly of the lemons, is there any way to avoid that flavor in the preserves?
