This recipe would turn anyone off fried rice - it is so bland. It needs more onions, carrots, peppers or mushrooms and definitely soy sauce and a pinch of ginger and you would have some flavor!

This is VERY basic and bland. I had never made frid rice before. I had just gotten back from vacation and had barely any groceries. I added one eggplant (diced) and about a cup of cupped spinich which helped, but the soy sauce others reccomended would have helped.

This is definitly a very basic recipe missing a very important ingredient, soy sauce!! Unless you are putting in meats such as roasted pork, you need to add soy sauce to the fried rice.

This is a very basic recipe. For extra flavour, add soy sauce and a little grated ginger.

Very nice, basic recipe. Great to build on. I used a very high heat once the rice was in there.

This one's a basic, but a great basic. I used a pint of rice left over from an Indian restaurant (though it was packed in so well it was probably three cups before submission to the cardboard box). The Indian spices on the rice--saffron and some other scents, I'm not sure what, made this a fantastic dish. I also used a whole can of canned peas as I like a lot of them and I like it when they're sweeter (and since it was a last-minute dish, I didn't have to wait for the frozen ones to defrost). I would just add that's it's key to use a very large wok or skillet. These ingredients need room to get cooked evenly in the pan. It's a perfect lazy-dish as it literally takes 5 minutes to make and is delicious!

added mixed veggies and soy to the cooking. My rice must have been moist because the cooking time was closer to 20-25 minutes Served with pork and ginger soy glaze from this site. a keeper

Great starter recipe. I substituted sesame oil for the veg oil and added fresh ginger, soy sauce and garlic for taste plus some mixed frozen vegies.

I liked this recipe, it is quick and easy. I also add about 1/2 tsp. Toasted Sesame Seed Oil (more or less to your taste), gives a real nice flavor boost.

Been at this one since I was a kid. I like butter better than oil, and I fry the rice BEFORE pouring the beaten egg over the rice. LOTS of pepper for me, but I skip the salt --because I like to serve egg fried rice with soy sauce as a condiment. Mmmm!

This is my first try at fried rice, and I was suprised at how simple it was. Next time though, I'll add more spices to add a little kick. I substituted yellow onion for scallion (it was all I had) and shoepeg corn and broccoli for peas. The onion was too much - try to stick to scallions.

We serve this frequently at our house -- excellent for adding in all kinds of leftovers! We usually use one egg for each cup of cooked rice. Also, try adding seasoned salt and lots of cilantro. Many possibilities here!
