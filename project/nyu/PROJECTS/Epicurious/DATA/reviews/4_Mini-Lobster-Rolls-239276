I was looking for a good lobster roll recipe and came across this one...it was fantastic and super super easy!!! I halved the recipe, using only lobster (steamed tails for 8 minutes) and substituted fennel greens for the dill as that's what I had on hand. Served open-faced on a toasted Hawaiian Roll Hamburger Bun.

Yum! Served on toasted Hawaiian rolls with center pulled out. I agree the mix is so good so you don't need the whole roll. I got great reviews at my Golde Globes party.

I served these at a graduation party along with other appetizers and people loved them! They were the first to go. I did cut out the bread in the middle of the rolls because you couldn't taste enough of the lobster. I would recommend serving the lobster with crackers next time. Overall, it was delicious and a big hit with guests.

I served this recipe as part of a cocktail party with several appetizers. Rather than putting the salad in the roll I served it along side pre-sliced rolls so that people could make their own little sandwich. It seemed like once they were assembled it would be more difficult to save any leftovers. There were also crackers on the table. Most people put the salad on a cracker rather than in the roll. In the future, I think I will just serve it with crackers instead. Or maybe even on an endive leaf. The flavor of the salad on its own is too good it cover with a lot of bread.

These were wonderful! I served them on crostini for a dinner party and everyone loved them. Great, light, lemony flavor that let the delicate flavors of the seafood come through. Definitely a keeper!

used 12 whole wheat hawaiian rolls instead of 24 and doubled the recipe so essentially quadrupled the amount of filling per roll. also omitted the shrimp and used all lobster. declicious! and the dill wasn't at all overpowering with this much filling. added a little chlli pepper on top at the end for a kick and visual interest.

Excellent. Next time I will double the ingredients and scoop out the middle of the Hawaiian Butter Rolls then fill it with the salad. I also did a combo of Fresh Chives, Dill, and Tarragon.

Good concept but not exceptional flavor. A little bit too much herbs. Next time I would go for a more traditional lobster roll flavor, mostly just lobster and mayo. Also, I think the quantity of stuffing wasn't sufficient for the amount of bread. I used potato rolls which were smaller than small dinner rolls, I cut a notch of bread out of these to put the filling into, but even then, there was barely more than a tablespoon of lobster mix. I would double the recipe next time for the same 24 rolls.

This was a hit! Very fast and easy and great fresh flavor. I did cut down on the dill since had to use dried (~ 1/2 tsp) but still very good. We used the soft Hawaiian rolls and worked perfectly. Highly recommended.

I've made these twice using potato rolls and will make again this New Year's Eve. They are simple to prepare yet a real crowd pleaser.

These were good, but all we tasted was the dill. Next time I make them I will cut the amount by half and I think they will be delicious.

I made this with many other appetizers for New Year's Eve. I used mini potato rolls. We loved it. I'll definitely make again.

ok. Another example of "what is popular". 2 reviews. And that makes this popular?

I substituted crab for the lobster and it was great.

This was a great recipe-I have made it a few times and it was a real crowd pleaser. The only improvement I made was to add more shrimp and lobster than called for, and to leave the seafood in chunks rather than chop it.
