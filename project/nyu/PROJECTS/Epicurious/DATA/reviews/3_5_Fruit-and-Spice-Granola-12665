Delicious, but I have to echo the comments about temperature. Began at 350 and had burning edges on my hands in no time. Dropped temperature to 275 and mixed every ten minutes. Took longer to cook but I was able to get it just the right shade of golden brown.

I made fruit and spice granola with my mommy.I think there was to much cinnamon. My preference would be more fruit. The granola's texture was a little weird. Based on my opinion I think it should have a better name. QUITE an adventure to make.On the granola I spent around $10.59 to make this granola. I will make it again.I loved the granola.

I thought this was a great recipe, although I did make a few changes. I added extra cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I will be making this again very soon.

first off i halfed this recipies cause i didnt want to make so much for the first attempt. I added more nutmeg and cinnamon then called for only because i really couldnt be bothered to measure exactly and for the last 10 mins of baking i tossed in the fruit [i used a mixture of orange cranberrys, blueberrys, strawberrys, rassberries, cherries and rasins. Also after i pulled out of the oven i pressed it all down and put then pressed down a paper towel and left there till it was fully cooled. Then broke into chunks. It smelled incredible and tasted almost as good as it smelled.

My husband and dear friend (whom are granola lovers) really liked this recipe! The friend now wants the recipe as well. I also baked this at 300 for about 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Increased the cinnamon to 2tsp, added 1/3 cup brown sugar and used sweeten coconut. Added dried cranberries and dried wild blueberries after baking. Will definitly make this again and again! Finally a GREAT GRANOLA!!!

Absolutely delicious! I can eat this every day and sometimes in the evening as well. Watch the cooking time, at 300F I have to cook it for 30 min stirring it every 10 minutes.

My family loves the recipe. It's a staple in our house. I add different nuts each time - mostly almonds and cashews. I served it at a brunch but did not add the dried fruit, instead I served the granola with a variety of chopped dried fruits on the side and let the guest add their own. It received rave reviews!

I really enjoyed this not-too-sweet granola, and my kitchen smelled delicious while it was baking. I was out of honey, so I used brown sugar which was fine. Baked at 300 for 30 mins. Only wish it had more "clumps" in it.

I followed the advice from the previous cook and only cooked at 300F for 30 minutes. I also added the cloves, allspice, and increased amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg. I'm not too keen on seaseme seeds so added Pumpkin, sunflower, cashews and slithered almonds instead. The kitchen smells devine and the granola tastes absolutely delicious - so much better than the shop variety! I'll definately use this granola as my regular breafast cereal now.

5/13/02: 3.5 forks! I baked for 30 mins at 300F without stirring and it came out just fine. Next time, I'll increase the cinnamon and nutmeg even more, use regular sweetened coconut, and try adding some other spices. Maybe cloves and allspice would harmonize well? 9/1/02: It was even better with regular sweetened coconut, 2t cinnamon, 1/2t dried grated nutmeg, 1/8t cloves, 1/8t allspice, and baked longer at 250F so it doesn't end up quite so soft and wet.

This was amazing! It makes a great cereal w/milk. Even my honey who is allegedly lactose intolerant, (I have my doubts based on what he eats) went back for 2nds & 3rds. I reduced the heat to 300F & the time to 20-25 mins. I used a tropical fruit mix and it was absolutely divine. Also, I used regular sweetened coconut and it turned out fantastik.

I should have read the reviews! The oven temp is too hot and I burned my first batch ;-(. It should be 300 degrees and stir every 5 minutes! I also added the dried fruit and coconut after browning and cooling the oatmeal.

Be careful when toasting this in the oven. The temp seems a little high, and the time a little long. As it says, stir often to keep from getting to dark. Really delicious.

A great morning surprise for guests! Add one teaspoon of chopped FRESH Rosemary for some extra spice!

I added chopped fresh ginger to the mix before baking, and used freeze-dried raspberries along with dried apricots.

Great comfort food! I used dried blueberries and ground the almonds, so the granola forms crunchy 'nuggets'(like my Mom's recipe). The spice not only tastes good the granola, but also makes the house smell lovely!
