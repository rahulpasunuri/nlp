Perhaps I got lost somewhere in the *endless* steps necessary for this thing (despite my level best to follow along each step), but it ended up two hard, horrible loaves of molar-crunching rock. I had to feed it to the birds outside, and even they were a bit hesitant on it. Assuming this theoretically *could* end up being edible, I'd think that some chopped rosemary in the original batter pre-kneading (mixed in with the starter) would give it a bit of zip.

i love this recipe. the crust is chewy and the inside is soft and lovely. i recommend putting an egg wash on the outside instead of flour just before cooking, or butter the outside right after it comes out as the outside is a little dry & floury from dusting it with flour.
