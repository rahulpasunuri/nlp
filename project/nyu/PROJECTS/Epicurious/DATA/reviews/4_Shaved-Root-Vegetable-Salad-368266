The mandolin made this very easy and beautiful. Paper thin slices obviated the need to cook anything. I used a variety of beets, radishes and some turnips. Stunningly beautiful. I will make it again this year and will switch out the orange juice for a champagne vinaigrette.

I'm gonna be harsh...you can go through my other reviews and see that I almost only ever say nice things about recipes I liked. This one, though...hurm. It got 50% outright "no way" votes at my dinner party of ten. It looks beautiful, but a pile of raw root veggies is a bit overpowering, and I'm not sure this would ever balance very well. I personally found it okay, but I felt there were things I could have done with the ingredients that would have unleashed so much more potential than this recipe, so for that I give it a D-minus.

Served this over arugula with cilantro instead of parsley so it would go with my Southwest themed Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it.

To A Cook - I agree, a vinaigrette would be better; perhaps the orange juice keeps the shaved roots from darkening. In which case, I would quickly pop all of them except the beets, which won't need it, into a bowl of cold lemon water (a few T fresh lemon juice in as much water as it takes to cover). Also, I might sprinkle fresh lemon juice just before I add the vinaigrette and toss. I might also julienne a few of the veggies for variety w/ thin slices. Yum?!

I have not tried this salad yet but I am eager to do so. In response to A Cook, yes you can eat beets raw. I have had them at salad bars raw. They were cut julienne-style.

ok. sorry. not a review. a question. is it intended that the beats and turnips are sliced raw? i've never heard of using raw beets before, so i feel a need to be sure....!

Really delicious salad - of course I made a few changes. I used roasted/chilled beets and simplified the dressing, leaving out the hazelnuts. The sweet/spice balance was perfect and colors looked amazing on a white platter.

so pretty...I did it with the slicer on my food processor, so it went quickly... I am making it in the morning to serve at night and I am wondering if I should put the dressing on right away and let it sit, hoped someone would have an answer.. I will do as the acid might keep the colour from turning..

The combo of veggies is delicious and looks great. It made good lunch leftovers, but as a side I think it needed a different dressing - the orange juice predictably over-ran the veggies. Some kind of vinegarette might be better. Also I'm no chef but it took me way longer than 20 minutes to slice all those pieces.
