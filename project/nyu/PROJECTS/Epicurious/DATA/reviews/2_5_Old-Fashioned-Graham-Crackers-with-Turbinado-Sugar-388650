I'm a huge fan of graham crackers so I was really looking forward to these cookies. Unfortunately, they really arent anything special. They're okay dunked in milk or coffee but they're JUST okay. I expected more from an Epicurious recipe.

These are delicious! As I keep eating "one more" I've upped my rating to 4 forks. Very simple and easy to make - the dough handles wonderfully. They are thinner and crisper than store-bought graham crackers, but they have a wonderful taste - kind of like a sugar cookie but not as sweet. I'm suprised there is only 1/4 c. of whole wheat flour - I think the next time I make them I will try using 2 c flour and 1/2 c whole wheat. I rolled the dough to 1/8 inch as instructed and got close to 4 dozen cookies - I glad it made a lot, because there have been a lot of volunteers to help make them disappear. These will be a favorite to make again and again.

These are yummy cookies - nice and crisp, but not tough. The turbinado sugar makes them. They aren't real sweet, so they are really good with a hot fudge sundae or on their own. It's hard to eat just one. They were a hit at home and at work. (I got closer to four dozen cookies.)

These are not spectacular. In case you were wondering, store bought graham crackers are just as delicious. I followed the recipe exactly.

@rosara Turbinado sugar is essental is minimally processed raw sugar. Substitute with brown sugar. Bon Appetit

rosora: turbinado sugar is a crystaline sugar that doesn't have all of the molasses removed. The larger crystals in this instance won't melt away to nothing, and it will give the top a flavorful sweet bounce. Brown sugar would not be a good substitute in this instance because of its melt temperature. Check in the natural foods section of your market.

@rosora turbinado sugar is a coarser and less processed sugar. In the US it's also called raw sugar. It is similar to the English demerara sugar. What we call brown sugar in the US is very moist and not very easy to sprinkle. It is usually measured tightly packed. Not sure what your brown sugar is like, but if that's all you have or can get, then I'd at least try it. Or just sprinkle with a coarse crystal white or colored sugar. It's just a decorative topping so you can probably get creative:)

please help me. Beeing from Germany, I have no idea what "Turbinado Sugar" is. Could I substitute it with any kind of brown sugat?

@jjkinlaca. Sure, why not? It's basically whole wheat flour ground s little coarser. Use it at least in place of the WW flour and maybe up to a cup or so of the all purpose. Too much and you're probably going to get a pretty dense, heavy cracker.

to beenz: use you head! what difference does it make whether one uses a round or a square cookie cutter?

Not a review but a question. The photo clearly shows round cookies, while the recipe says to cut them with a square cutter. Which?
