I was thinking of making this again. Someone privately emailed me years ago that my baking powder may have been old, so watch that! Now I date mine when I open it. I remember these pancakes being superb, the best, actually.

Outstanding!!!!! Try using buttermilk instead---makes wonderful pancakes! Also try the recipe for rasberry butter from an earlier Bon Appetit issue. You can find it in Epcurious. Believe me when I say you won't be sorry!!

This is my favorite pancake recipe. I add a teaspoon of vanilla and use a little less milk so they are not so thin. Also, I sprinkle on some fresh bluberries before turning them over. The jam is too much for me, but otherwise, these are absolutely yummy pancakes!

I am from OREGON and I love pancakes. My husband made them for breakfast and we loved them! Expect them to be denser and less fluffy than conventional pancakes, but they are so tasty. Great flavor.

So wonderful, I had to make it again and again and again...my family loves it, and the rasberry jelly w/maple syrup is absolutely delicious on the pancakes!! We've all become addicted to them!

Tasty, but too much butter in the cakes (not to mention the butter in the pan).

Easy to make and delicious. I have probably made them 20 times. My husband loves them. I usually make 1/2 the batter (use one and a half eggs).

When I make these pancakes, the recipe makes too much for us (my husband and I). I save the leftover batter in a tightly-capped container and keep it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day the results are still excellent. We really like pancakes and we love this recipe.

We made this recipe 3 times, the last two being flops! We keep trying because we remember these griddle cakes being the best we've ever had. The 2nd and 3rd time the cakes were thin and doughy. I suspect it was this way because my husband beat the batter too long one time, and the second time he used a spoon instead of a whisk. Any ideas?

Delightful. On my second try, I substituted buttermilk for milk and 1/4 cup of Wesson for the butter. It was likewise wonderful...in fact, scrumptious.
