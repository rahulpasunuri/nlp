The batter didn't taste lemony enough for me so I added quite a bit more. I skipped the glaze. I expected the bread to rise much more than it did, it was very dense...i also put in more poppy seeds than it called for. very good flavor with the extra lemon.

Absolutely great. I used 3 medium-sized loaf pans -- still perfect. I've given these as gifts and every time I've been asked for the recipe. Simple and wonderful.

I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers and increased the lemon zest to 3 tbsp. and the lemon juice to 6-8 tbsp. I also used 2 tbsp. poppy seeds and 3/4 cup whole milk plus 1/4 cup light sour cream. I cut the sugar in the batter to 1-3/4 cups and skipped the glaze. The bread/cake came out so light and fluffy yet moist! The flavor was very delicate, not too sweet, not too lemony. It was perfect! I made 1 loaf and about 8 small muffins.

I used twice as much zest on the cake/bread and less sugar on the glaze. The cake was bland and the top was soggy. Didn't love it.

I just made this and everyone LOVED it! - I didn't have poppyseeds so I made a few changes (I added the juice of an extra lemon since I like things tangy, I added vanilla and a Tbs of rum, and instead of milk, I used the same quantity of plain yogurt with a pinch of baking soda to lighten the cake). It was scrumptious and keeps really well - still enjoying it the next day!

I added more lemon juice and less sugar to the sugar/lemon mixture (to spoon over the top) which gave a delicious zing to the bread. It almost tasted like some of those sweet/sour candies. Very good!

Very good but very sweet. I would half sugar and it would still be great.

Exactly what I was looking for, especially after adopting some of the tweaks suggested here (thanks cooks!). I added about one-and-a-half times the lemon zest and juice, used 3/4 cup 1% milk and 1/4 cup creme fraiche, and stirred in a cup of dried cranberries at the end. The extra liquid meant I had to bake it a bit longer, so next time I would reduce the milk to 1/2 cup. I skipped the glaze, as I find glazes make tea breads too sweet for my taste. Fabulous lemon taste, slightly crisp "crust" and wonderful texture.

This was delightful! Made mini-loaves for holiday gifts and everyone asked for the recipe. Wonderful, as is.

Very moist. I also increased the poppy seeds to two tablespoons. I will add a little more lemon to the batter next time.

I would say this is more of a cake then a bread. It's very dense and rich. Very lemony which I love. My husband thought it could have used a little less lemon syrup on it though. I used 1/3 cup buttermilk and 2/3 cup skim milk since that is what I had on hand. I also used 2 T. poppy seeds and 3 t. of lemon zest. I would make it again but I'm still looking for something a little lighter.

Very delicious! Love lemons & poppy seeds together!

Made for holiday gift giving. Tasted very nice, though lemon glaze didn't penetrate very well in first batch. Solution was to use more glaze and make more holes. Seemed to do the trick. To cope with altitude, reduced baking powder by 1/2 t. Rose nicely. On reviewers' suggestion, increased the lemon flavoring and poppy seeds.

Delicious. Made in mini cake pans. Add LOTS of lemon and zest! Skipped the poppy seed (personal preference).

Great. Since I have a slight impediment (a Benign Essential Tremor) there's a problem with filling tiny muffin pans, but with a pastry bag you can become a pro! Sure saves food fight splatters in the work space. And as many others stated: less sugar and more zest. Just very lightly toast the seeds before adding.

The night before Thanksgiving. What a time to discover that my grown daughter swiped my loaf pans! So, I raised the temp to 350 and used two 9" square pans. Worked fine. In fact, probably better, because the glaze is widely distributed over a cake that isn't as tall. Provides more glaze flavor. I used a little more zest and an extra tsp of poppy seeds. I do wish that I'd remembered the comments about using extra lemon before I made it. It's very good, but would be absolutely great with a lot more lemon. It's a good dessert foil for those heavier chocolate desserts that I also made. Happy Thanksgiving and I'm certainly giving thanks for this site and the helpful comments.

I usually never make changes the first time I try a new recipe, but based on the many reviews I read, I decided to make some adjustments. First, I used all the zest from 4 large lemons and didn't bother measuring how much it was. I used an extra 1/2 sugar in the main part and added 2 tablespoons poppy seeds instead of 2 teaspoons. I never have whole milk, so I used 2/3 cup skim milk and 1/3 cup buttermilk. I baked them as muffins because that was what my son had requested. They were great! I couldn't imagine them without those adjustments... thank you to all the previous reviewers for their recommendations. This recipe is a keeper!

This was quite delicious. We halved the recipe, but doubled the lemon juice and zest. We also cut the sugar a bit, left out the poppy seeds and added 1 T lavender flowers. It also took about 45 minutes, not the full hour.

I made this in my new rose mini bundts and they are amazingly gorgeous!!! I baked them for only 28 minutes and they are moist and perfect. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and zest b/c after tasting the batter I was worried it would not be lemony enough. I also omitted the poppyseeds. I can't wait to give these away as gifts.

I decrease the sugar to 1 1/2c in the batter and to 1/4c in the glaze. I also use all the zest of 2 lemons and inc juice to 3T. Very good, definitely a cake!

So Good!!! However, if you are looking for a bread then keep looking. This is definately a cake. I followed the recipe except I added a little more lemon juice and some dried cherries to the mix. The taste is great! I took the advice of another and heated the glaze and poured it over warm and the bread turned out great with no mushy topping. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Great and Unique!!!

This is a good as muffins also. I added a full bottle of Poppy seeds and it added a better taste and texture.

As a suggestion to remedy the mushiness caused by the glaze....this recipe is very similar to the 'glazed lemon bread' recipe, also on this site. That one says to heat the lemon juice and sugar (to dissolve the sugar), and glaze the bread with the warm mixture. I did this and the bread did not turn mushy, even after several days.

Rating: 4
I made the changes suggested by Columbus cook, below, and it was great! I didn't glaze at all, only had one lemon, so I used all the zest from the one lemon, 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup orange juice, plus the 1/4 cup sour cream and skim milk as described. I would suggest adding the sour cream with the milk additions and perhaps adding the juice before the final addition of flour. I added my juice,the orange and lemon, at the end and it seemed to separate the batter somewhat. It did not affect the finished cakes, which were moist and light, with a fine crumb and great texture. I also increased the poppy seeds to 3 teaspoons.

After reading all the reviews about the mushy tops resulting from the glaze, I altered the recipe to give the bread more flavor so I could skip the glaze. I used 3/4 cup of skim milk (as I was out of whole) and supplemented it with 1/4 cup of light sour cream. I also tripled the amount of lemon zest and doubled the lemon juice. The result was spectacular. The bread had wonderfully light, cakey texture, and the flavor was fabulous - it certainly didn't lack anything as a result of elimiating the glaze. We ate some of the bread by itself, and I also made a trifle out of it, using fresh raspberries and a filling made out of marscapone, whipping cream, and lemon juice. This is an incredible recipe with lots of versatility. Will definitely make again and again.

I too thought this was an excellent bread/cake - however mine also was a little mushy on top. I will definitely make again!

What I liked about this recipe was that it called for ingredients I always have on hand, so I didn't need to go to the market. I would however, use more poppy seeds. I wonder if the recipe should have said Tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the poppy seeds. The flavor was very good.

Rating: 3
Very, very good however, has a light cake-like texture and most of the lemon flavour comes from the glaze rather than the bread itself. Also, the glaze makes the top soft and mushy which is rather unpleasant. I will make again, but will increase lemon juice and zest in the batter and perhaps increase the butter slightly. Also, it would benefit from more poppy seeds - 2-3 tbsp would be much better. I was expecting a moister, denser, and heavier loaf with much more lemony tang inside. Also, my regular-size loaves were fully baked at 45 minutes, so watch your timing -but, could also be my oven. Nonetheless, it is a nice loaf and goes great with a cup of tea.

This is one of the easiest recipes, I've made. I love the way you can contol how lemony it is by the amount of lemon glaze you use. I brought one of the loaves to work with me, and the whole thing was gone before noon.

This is really delicious lemon bread. It could easily be called lemon cake - it would be just as good for dessert as breakfast. My husband loved it!! I held back on the sugar in the glaze to make the bread more tart. This one is a keeper!

I messed up the recipe by putting all of the sugar into the bread and it still came out wonderfully. The bread vanished within minutes.

This was very good and moist-it's not as sweet as I expected but perhaps it's because I like things very sweet! I sprayed the pan with Pam-bad idea-follow the instructions! It's a cross between bread and pound cake.

It's not as easy as everyone says it is--I was expecting it to be SUPER simple--but it's not complicated. I made it for Christmas brunch, and everyone liked it. Definitely a must for people who like a lemony kick. The one danger is, it's pretty light so you can end up eating 3-4 slices in one sitting!!

Delicious. I decreasd the sugar by 1/2 cup, and added about a cup of frozen blueberries. I think the full amount of sugar would have been far too sweet.

Wonderful, except I modified the fat content. Subtitute 1/2 C paritally-drained yogurt for 1/2 stick butter, increase the zest to 1T, eliminate the 1T lemon juice, add 1/2 t baking soda to the dry ingredients. I just catered the dessert portion of a party and this bread was a rave.

This was a hit! Even my husband, who doesn't like desserts, raved. I left out the poppy seeds (only because I forgot!), and added the zest off two lemons to the glaze, using confectionists sugar instead of granulated sugar. Add the glaze just before serving. I also used mini-bundt pans (2" diameter). Very presentable!!

I thought this bread was very good, even though I had to cut the tops off due to overbrowning. This might have been cause my husband left the oven on "broil" and I didn't notice!! Seriously, they were still good and I will make them again!

It was good but the glaze was very lemony. Either the amount called for was too much or my lemons were extra sour.
