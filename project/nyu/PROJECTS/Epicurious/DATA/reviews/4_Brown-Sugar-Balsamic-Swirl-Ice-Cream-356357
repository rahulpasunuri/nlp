To each his own, but I did not care at all for the reduced vinegar taste in the ice cream. It was overpowering and, for me, ruined what might have been a good dish of ice cream.

This is a really yummy ice cream; don't be afraid of the vinegar. It went over well after a sushi dinner and everyone raved over it. The custard is really tasty and rich, and the vinegar cuts that with some tart sweetness. Lovely!

This ice cream is excellent. The only thing I'll change next time is not reducing the vinegar quite so much because it was a bit difficult to mix into the ice cream and there wasn't enough of it. No need to use the good balsamic, any decent brand will do. The reduction eliminates any harshness. I will certainly make this again.

Who would have thought these flavours work so well together as an ice cream! I thought the combination tasted a lot like Molasses, without any harshness. Not just me either, the GF thinks it's her favourite flavour, and Two housemates really enjoyed it too. The texture was just right (made in a Donvier), not too creamy or eggy.

Loved, loved, loved this ice cream. What a nice addition to the pear tart. I did, however, make this with coconut milk instead of cow's milk. It turned out great and everyone loved it. 2 14-oz cans of coconut milk, 1/2 cup + 2 tbl brown sugar for the milk and 1/4 cup for the egg yolks. Kept the vinegar the same. No saturated fat, yeah!

This ice cream was great! It paired really well with the pear tart tatin. I ended up putting more vanilla in the recipe than it called for, but only because I love the vanilla flavor (ended up using 1.5 beans worth of seeds). Don't be afraid! You'll love it!
