I loved this and brought it to a party and the guests liked it too. I passed out pieces of mint gum with it (sort of joking) because mine turned out very garlicky. I did only use one clove, but it was on the bigger side. The herbs in here are wonderful and I thought it was delicious. The dressing was more runny than I thought, but delish.

I made this salad for a barbecue last night and it was a huge hit! The fresh herbs make the dressing extremely light and the croutons are simple, but delicious. This will be my new go to dressing when I'm craving a caesar salad.

Wonderful and easy!

Fantastico! I made the recipe as stated, except that I only dressed as much salad as the two of us would eat at one meal. We enjoyed it for a couple more meals.

This was great! At first I wasn't thrilled with the dressing but once it had time for the flavors to settle it was great. Didn't use the egg in the dressing, added a tbsp of mayo instead. Served with over easy eggs. Delicious!

I wasn't sure this would still taste like a caesar with the herbs but I'm totally convinced having made it. I really loved the zing from the basil and think this recipe will stick in my caesar loving family. My tweaks: I coddled the egg for 1min and substituted 1 salted anchovie for the paste. If you love anchovies use more.

I made this as-is, except that I used store-bought croutons. Very good, and I made it for company, and my guests enjoyed it, as well. it paired well with my mini-Chicken pot pies.

this was a great spin on the classic Caesar.......be warned that if you use all the mixture yo will be on the edge of drowning the Romaine...other than that Fantastic.

This was the most delicious Caesar salad I have ever tasted. I can't stop thinking about it! I served it with crusty bread and salmon topped with a caramelized spice rub. Fabulous!

This is perfect and so easy to make with a food processer. I used a huge clove of garlic, and was worried the dressing would be too garlicy-potent, but it wasn't at all. Compared to some other caesar dressings, this one was relatively light. Like the recipe states, it has a nice delicate herbal-ness to it that sets it apart.

Great Caesar recipe. Used extra anchovies and added garlic salt to the croutons. All guests wanted the recipe....nice and light but full flavor

Best Caeser salad ever -- even my kids loved it!

This was the bast caesar I think I've ever had. Lighter and more refreshing than most caesars. Perfect for a hot summer day. It just doesn't get any better than this. I made my own croutons to go with it. Magnifique!

This is delicious and easy and doesn't have the heaviness that accompanies most Caesar salads. It's worth it to make the croutons.

I made this with lasagna and it was a huge hit - there was not one piece of lettuce left! Will definitely make again. Very easy and delicious.

I've made many caeser dressings and this is my favorite by far. It tastes like summer.

Made this to accompany my lasagna dinner party this past weekend to rave reviews. Instead of these croutons I made the Herbed Garlic & Parmesan croutons also on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Herbed-Garlic-and-Parmesan-Croutons-14518) and people took seconds of salad. A big hit!

Before I review, I have to admit that I omitted the anchovy paste (some of you won't bother reading the review now, which I understand). That said, I thought this was delicious. I normally am not a Caesar salad fan but I absolutely loved this. My husband, who is a Caesar sald fanatic, loved it too!

The dressing is so good, the basil and parsley balance out the anchovies and give it a really fresh flavor. This is my new favorite Caesar dressing.

Excellent. Easy, quick and perfect for summer. We added a few ripe tomatoes and it was great. Will definitely make again!

I thought that this was pretty good, but I made my dressing overly fishy because I tried to substitute anchovies for anchovy paste and used too many. Overall this is a nice, simple summer salad.

When I first tasted the dressing freshly mixed, I wasn't really in love with it. But after I mixed it with the salad and the parmesan cheese- it was absolutely amazing. I made garlic parmesan croutons and grilled chicken to go with it. It was seriously good. I am looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow!

Very deliscious dressing. A good way to use those summer herbs and make a tasty Ceasar...

Excellent dressing, bright with the flavor of basil and parsley. Reminds me of a favorite herb & blue cheese dressing we often make from this site. Will be repeated often.

I love the idea of Caesar dressing, but then am usually disappointed to find it too oily, too garlicky or too bland. This one met my highest expectations. It was light, creamy, tasty, refreshing, and delicious. It also kept very well, staying emulsified and bright green for almost a week in the fridge till we finished it off!

This Caesar salad is exactly what it claims to be, light and herbal. It is also delicious. I made it as a side dish to Jamie Oliver's Pasta al Forno, but the salad stole the show, receiving rave reviews.
