This was pretty good. My first time cooking with bulgur. I added more cumin than called for and was glad I did. Jicama isn't really my favorite, but it lended this dish a needed crunch, and worked well. I thought 1/2 cup of mint sounded like too much, so I adjusted to taste and went with less than 1/4 cup. In the end I didn't feel like it needed more.

I made this last night and my husband and I both loved it. I made it basically as the recipe says. I thought it fresh and healthful. Will make again for sure.

This was a very nice change of pace and my family found it delicious and I just realized I forgot to add the pine nuts. Shucks! I usually am not a big jicama fan but I thought it definitely added a nice crunch to the salad. I did cut them no larger than the 1/4 inch dice recommended. I'm not sure if I made the 2 cups of cilantro either since I just eyeballed/tasted it. It was close though. I can't wait to make this again with the pine nuts. I wonder if it would be good with lime juice.

Personal taste varies! I was rather disappointed with this recipe (made exactly as written). Somehow mine turned out unpleasantly tart (to me), though I loved the textures and the flavours of the pine nuts, mint, and bulgur. I will probably try this again with reduced cilantro (and I like cilantro) and letting the dressing drain off before serving.

The cilantro, mint, and pine nuts were what I liked. Jicama not so much. A great workweek lunch.

This recipe is very fresh and the presentation is beautiful. It needs extra lemon juice, but it has a great variety of flavors for the palate--love the mint.

This was tasty and the dressing had a nice tartness to it, like tabouleh, but my dear husband and I still felt like it needed something more. The next time I make it, I may add a can of drained pinto or black beans...

Have made this twice. The first time I didn't have pine nuts and it was good, but the second time I had pine nuts and it was better. My husband and I both like onions, so the second time I also added about 1/4 cup diced red onions, and it was even better.

Made this for a Labor Day weekend gathering at the last moment because I had all the ingredients on hand. It was refreshing and delicious - a welcome change from the usual taboulleh we've been eating all summer and full of great texture with the jicama and toasted pine nuts. It was very popular with everyone at the party.

Jicama is also known as the yam bean. However, jerusalem artichoke, lo bok, and chinese turnip are not alternative names. Jicama is from the genus Pachyrhizus, while jerusalem artichoke (aka sunchoke) is from the genus Helianthus, and lo bok, chinese turnip are from the genus Raphanus. These others are used as substitutes hence the possible confusion. Another possible area of confusion and possible reason why it is hard to find in London is that Jicama is native to the americas and only recently has it spread to Asia.

It is also known as yam bean, lo bok, or chinese turnip to name a few. It's really delicious so it's worth the effort to find it if you can!

Jicama has no other name. It is in the fresh produce aisle.

London, if you look in Epi's food dictionary, it explains what jicama is; maybe you'll be able to figure out a good substitute. http://www.epicurious.c om/tools/fooddictionary /search?query=jicama

to the cook from london. Not that I know of. I don't know about England, but it's available in the produce section of many American supermarkets.

I've never heard of jicama. Does it have another name?
