Good old fashioned spinach dip. Fortunately I was making a double batch and started with one 1.4oz packet of Knorr Vegetable mix.... Go slow with the mix and use it only to taste. If I was making a single batch I would only use half of a packet. Added a little fresh garlic and scallions and water chestnuts.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic spinach dip and on the Knorr site, but the one thing this recipe is missing is the water chestnuts, so add 1 8oz. can drained and chopped, adds an extra bit of texture to the dip that is much needed!

Rating: 3
Just use the recipe on the side of the Knorr's package which is basically the same as this one but with 1/2 cup less sour cream and 1 can of water chestnuts and scallions if you want. The water chesnuts add a good crunch.

Rating: 3
For anyone else interested in avoiding the Knorr vegetable powder (I was trying to avoid MSG) - I used equal parts celery seed and dried minced onion, and added about a quarter to a half as much salt. I made a quarter cup of this mixture and put it through the food processor. Added a clove of garlic, and the three green onions as suggested. Added 2 tbl lemon juice, cayenne pepper to taste, and a can of water chestnuts. It does taste a LOT like store bought ranch dressing with spinach mixed in -- which doesn't seem that special - but couldn't stop "taste testing" it for quite a while. Haven't brought it to the party yet but suspect it will be enjoyed.

I doubled the spinach with some fresh spinach sauted with onions and garlic, added diced fresh carrots for crunch and color. Omitted the mayonnaise and added cream cheese instead. It was demolished at my last two parties, bowl and all.

Following other reviewers advice, I doubled spinach, added water chestnuts, green onion, garlic powder, lots of black pepper-- and for my own special something, a can of crushed pineapple! The pineapple sealed the deal for me, making the dip slightly sweet and tangy. I put it in a rye bread boule, and took it to Christmas. Huge hit. Now I make it all the time.

This recipe was very tasty but far too mayonaisy and glopy for those of us who like things fresher and not as fatty, and this was still with double the spinach! The mayonaise and sour cream needs to be reduced drastically. I would make it again but with very different proportions.

Along with doubling the spinach, adding green onions, water chestnuts and a dash of hot sauce, I added 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Really brightened the flavours. Served with toasted pita.

I made this with 3/4 cup of lowfat mayo (not fat free). Did not add sour cream. It doesn't need all that mayo & you can really taste the spinach too. Added a little garlic power and dried basil, kosher salt and pepper. This was the bomb!

I agree with the other reviewers: it's too plain as written. I made this to take to a friend's barbecue last weekend, and I added a can of water chestnuts, 3 chopped green onions, and an extra box of spinach...it was perfect! My darling husband happily ate nearly half of it before we even made it to our friend's house, and the rest of the guys inhaled it as soon as I set it on the counter!

Rating: 4
To make this a dip and little better I suggest adding 2 packages of frozen spinch. It has made it a little thicker ( it can become so gloppy and runny with all the mayonaise and sour cream) - and taste a lot better! For some variation - add water chestnuts or shredded swiss cheese !

This recipe is always a hit at football & cocktail parties alike. I'm sure food-snobs & self-proclaimed "high-society" types would find it to be mundane, bland, "gross," etc....but to everyone else, it's familiar & tasty, almost comfort food. I like to add 1 sm. can diced waterchestnuts (for a bit of crunch) and 7-8 sprigs of fresh cilantro, finely chopped. The end result is a classic spinach dip, like what you'd find in your grocer's deli case. Also goes well with Hawaiian bread - the slight sweetness complements this dip's creaminess nicely.

This recipe is just gross. If I could give it 0 forks I would. Basically, if you use a recipe on the side of a pre-packaged soup container, you get what you asked for. Bland, boring, mundane, just, well, ordinary. Maybe serve it at a super bowl party along with the keg of beer, but don't embarrass yourself by taking this to a dinner party or cocktail party where people might hold it up to true scrutiny. Don't be misled by other reviews-- this is like the French onion dip recipe on the Lipton package, but the onion recipe is infinitely better. Enough said.

Add to this recipe for a better version (at least in my opinion!) 1/2 cup shredded parmesan(the real thing, not the immitation), 1/2 cup monterey jack shredded (or mozerella), 1 can artichoke hearts chopped, 1 large clove crushed garlic. Scallion to taste, Dash of tabasco. Also, use only 1 cup of sour cream. bake at 350 till bubbling Serve with tortillas. Serve sour cream and salsa on the side so the guests can dip in all 3!

A couple of things I do differently. I use frozen spinach. I let it thaw, then I use dish towels to press all the moisture out of the spinach. I use 3 large cloves of garlic, minced. And I use a small can of water chestnuts, I dice them in the food processor.

Just buy the Knorr box for Spring Vegetable soup- it is printed on the side of the box- it is really good- I cut back on the mayo, added chopped green onions, and for an extra kick- you can mix this dip recipe with a large brick of Velveeta, some can of Rotel tomatos,heat it up, add in some milk to this a bit and serve with tostadas- we call is Scary Spinach Dip because is it scary good!

Rating: 3
I've been making this for years, and it is always great -- it's the first thing to disappear, so I usually treble it, adjusting to keep the texture OK. I prefer finely minced onion and sliced scallions for crunch and flavour, instead of water chestnuts, which are basically pretty tasteless. I also like more spinach. I serve it in a large sourdough boule; when the dip is gone, it's amusing to watch people fight over pieces of the bread-bowl!

This is a great recipe but where are the water chestnuts and the spring onions? This recipe is on the box of the Knorr vegetable soup mix. I've made it many, many times. It's much better if you make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge so all the flavors blend. I serve it in a bread bowl but always need crackers in addition to the bread cubes. Make sure to get as much water out of the spinach as possible.

I have been making this dip for years and everyone loves it. It is so addicting. I just wanted to mention that I do not like water chestnuts. I think it is more the consistency than the taste of them. However, I always add them to this recipe. I chop them very fine in the food processor. It adds a great texture to the dip. So if you aren't a fan don't skip them...give 'em a try. I also like adding cubed fresh rye bread to the pumpernickel.

This is a Knorr classic recipe (found on the side of the vegetable soup mix). I usually double the spinach and add water chestnuts (chopped in a food processor).

Using a suggestion from another review here, I used one cup mayo, one cup sour cream, added in an 8 oz. can of water chestnuts and some chopped green onions, and I let it sit for 3 hours. The longer it sits, the better it gets. I got raves and I found it addictive! I served it in a hollowed out pumpernickel bread bowl with the bread cubes on the side. Great with tortilla chips, veggies, and crackers too! (Some people use 2 boxes of spinach, I stick to 1. Also, the spinach must be thawed and COMPLETELY drained. I used the microwave to thaw it quickly.)

This has always been one of my favorites.The only thing I ever changed was to add some fresh dill weed to the sour cream about an hour before I mixed it up.Dehidrated dill weed can be used if fresh is not available.Mix the dehidrated in with all the other ingredients at the same time.The fresh would be too overpowering if mixed in earlier.

This is a GREAT recipe! I have been making this for about 5 years or so. Everyone who tries it for the first time, ask for the recipe. It's great for veggies or with the pumpernickle bread. But for myself, I love with veggies.

This recipe, with the important addition of a can of coarsely chopped waterchestnuts for crunch, has been in our family for years. It is older than my daughter, who has requested for her home wedding this spring only one specific appetizer--and this is it! It will be made with my husband's organic spinach.

I make a no-fat version using no fat Miracle Whip and fat-free sour cream. I serve with crusty French bread, which also has no fat. No one's the wiser -- except my waistline!

I just follow the instruction on the Knorr spring vegetable soup mix box. Easy and Good.

This recipe is really spiced-up with a bit of chopped onion and a can of water chestnuts chopped also.

I was looking for the hot spinach/parmesan dip served with tortilla chips, and settled for this. I used fat free cheese, and thought it was pretty, but too bland. I put a little diced hot peppers in it, and some garlic, and used it for dip with crudites. Just okay.

I use two boxes of Spinach and 1 cup of Hellmans and 1 cup of sour cream it makes it a lot prettier and everyone says mine is the best they ever had. Also I use that Hawiian Sweet Bread , the round one and use it as a bowl. I also use green onion and water chestnuts.

I have made this for 15 yrs and it is the absolute best! Use only the Best Mayonnaise and Sour Cream - I use a ratio of 50% for each. I also agree with others using green onion (2 ea) and waterchestnuts finely chopped (1 sm. can). Drying the spinach thoroughly is essential. And make this the night before when using green onions - gives it more flavor the next day. There are never any leftovers on this recipe.

Even better with diced waterchestnuts and some green onion! Try with a dark pumpernickel bread. You won't be disappointed!

One word...DELICIOUS! Also great with fresh bacon bits.

This is a great standby! To add a little crunch and color, I sometimes include grated carrot and chopped celery, and minced Vidalia - and omit the dried soup...also cuts down on the sodium.Add lemon juice, black pepper, (optional-red pepper flakes) to taste.

I got this recipe from my Stepmom 10 years ago, and she got it off the back of the Knorr package. Every party I go to, it's there. It's also good with crackers (Chicken in a Biscuit & Sociables are our family's favorites)

A friend gave me this recipe about 12 years ago and it's always a big hit. I always make it with FAT FREE SOUR CREAM and LITE MAYONNAISE and it always tastes great! I've found that triscuit crackers stand up well with the dip.

Whenever I am invited to a party, they don't allow me to attend unless I bring my Spinach Dip. It is always a huge success!

This dip is delicious and a big hit. It should be mentioned however, that it is important to drain the spinach very well or you will have spinach soup. I put the spinach in a colander and used paper towels to absorb all of the liquid. It turned out great.
