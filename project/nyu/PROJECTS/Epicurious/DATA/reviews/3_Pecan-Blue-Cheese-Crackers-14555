I love these crackers and they are always a big hit when I serve them or bring them to parties. One IMPORTANT change I made - I only bake them for 16 minutes - almost have of what they suggest. My oven isn't usually overheating so I'd check your oven often while baking these. Once they overcook they are very dry and burnt tasting.

Yummy. The the crackers are small but the flavor is dense(and full of fat!) so you don't need to eat but a few. Creaming the butter and cheese with a fork made my batter too dry, so the 2nd time I made these I softened the butter and cheese in the microwave then creamed them with an electric mixer... much better. I had to bake them a little longer- 14 rather than 12 minutes.

I make these every Christmas season and they are a huge hit. If you don't like blue cheese, try one of the mild varieties.

These are always a hit when I make them and the aroma makes the house smell really good. There are rarely leftovers. They can be delicate if you cut them too thin, they can break or burn. Watch the cooking time, the time in the recipe is way too long. I would only make these for people who like blue cheese.

I think the crackers were good but it didn't go over well at the potluck. You really have to like blue cheese!!!!

these did not go over well at all with my friends. even fresh out of the oven, i wasn't too impressed myself. frankly, the browner ones tasted like... ritz crackers! i did get 45 or so out of each log but thought they were very small (cutesy, really)

These were awsome!! Easy to make, made the right amount of crackers (45 per log). I made 1/2 with pecans, and the other 1/2 without. Great presentation. I chopped the pecans w/the egg white (I read "seperate egg" as an adjective, instead of a verb!)and they still came out great-good texture. I liked the ones that were overbrowned & crispy. Mmmmmm-

IN THE INGREDIENTS LIST THE EGG IS WHOLE. BUT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS THE EGG IS YOLK. WHICH IS CORRECT?

the baking time of 35 mins. is too much at350'. afterthe batch scorched, I watched the second batch carefully and found that 12 mins baking time is plenty.

I made these crackers for a church function and they were a hit. My husband especially loved them. However, I wasn't able to get 45 crackers out of each log.

I made these crackers as a Super Bowl snack & they were a scored a touchdown. I did substitute gorgonola cheese for the Saga blue cheese & it worked just fine.
