Ahem. Three words: Buy. Orange. Jello. I squeezed the oranges, made it precisely to the recipe and anticipated something, I don't know, interesting. Not happening with this one.

This year marks the third New Year's Eve in nine years that we serve this at our small inn, in Northern Vermont. We use individual molds, and it makes a lovely light dessert option.

this was a wonderful element in a dessert table for my post-holiday party. light and delicious. and i had no problem getting it to keep its shape. i took advantage of the suggestion to substitute half the juice from regular oranges, and it was still beautiful and delicious. a big hit.

Wonderful, light end to a New Year's roast prime rib dinner. I found that the 2 packets of gelatin were not quite enough for the jelly to hold it's shape once unmolded from the large form . . . but I loved the soft texture of the jelly when eating it. Next time, I plan to use smaller, individual molds.
