My bad, I made with tuna since salmon is not a favorite. There was a lack of flavor though. Note to self, next time omitting salmon, remember to season more! Will make again and the pumpernickel bread is a perfect suggestion.

This is how I modified the recipe to bring as a great finger food app for a dinner party: chop the salmon - skin cucumbers and cut into 1/4 inch circles - spread a tiny bit of sc on each cucumber slice - top with pinch of salmon mix - sprinkle basil over top. It was a huge hit!

Easy to make appetizer with delicious flavours. Will definitely make again.

Great combination of flavors! We used a blood orange and skipped the salt as the salmon was salty enough. Make sure you use good smoked salmon. Everything but the salmon and scallions can be combined an hour in advance to let the flavors blend. Also, next time will make this in hothouse cucumber "cups" hollowed out with a melon baller. The whole half a cucumber was a but too much to manage and difficult to eat without making a mess.

great flavors (i love smoked salmon) but even better topped with feta instead of sour cream.
