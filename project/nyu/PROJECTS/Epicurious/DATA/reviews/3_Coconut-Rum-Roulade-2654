Coconut lovers, add this one to your repertoire. Although it looks daunting, with all of the ingredients, this is a fairly easy cake to make. The custard filling was scrumptious, and the lemon zest added a nice zing. I served this for a holiday party as part of the dessert buffet. Despite a lot of competition, the roulade was gone. I will make this again.
