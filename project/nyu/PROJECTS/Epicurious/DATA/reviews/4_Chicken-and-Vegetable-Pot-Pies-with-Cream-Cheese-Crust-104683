Made exactly as written, good, but not CHICKEN pot pie, better called beef pot pie. Made a second time, using chicken base and thyme instead of beef base and rosemary...absoluteky delicious. My friend likes dark meat. so I roasted skinless, boneless thighs which I marinated in olive oil and lemon juice and seasoned w/ salt and pepper. 350 for 30 minitues. In my 2 cp footed tureens , they were beautiful.

Favorite pot pie ever! We change up the veggies all the time, and usually make it in one large casserole dish (increasing the cooking time, of course).

Excellent, simple and elegant. Because of time constraints I used a roasted chicken and organic chicken broth plus some chicken demi glace to re-heat the chicken in and to create the base for the sauce. Minor changes: white wine for half the milk, yellow peppers as a contrast to the sun dried tomatoes, and just a whisper of freshly grated ginger that did it for us. It is my go to recipe when we want comfort food. And a great one for parties since a whole menu can be made ahead from salad to dessert.

I love chicken pot pie but the traditional ones with a lot of sauce. I used the crust on this recipe and it was delicious. Completely awesome. I made my own chick stock and comined this recipe with another one to make it more of a traditional pot pie filling. Everyone loved it. In fact I'm making it tonight, one for me and one for my parents.

Really great recipe. The crust is amazing, but can be tough to make. You may want to add 1-2 tsp of vinegar. You can use a mixer if you don't have a food processor. You can save a ton of time using a rotisserie chicken and store stock...VERY good this way.

Very special, and as others have said this is time consuming. More so than it appears. I made the chicken and broth on Friday after work, the crust on Saturday, and the vegetables, gravy and assembly on Sunday. That was manageable. Had I tried to do this in one step, it would have been overwhelming. That said, it was fantastic! Hubby said best meal ever. It was very filling, but we managed :-). Sur la Table had the perfect sized ramekins on sale for under $3. I found a floured fork tine pressed against the side of the ramekin worked beautifully to secure the pastry top. Would definitely make again.

Time consuming but worth every minute. I only add salt and chicken when boiling and making broth. This way I can use the frozen broth for more things later that don't require a thyme flavor. And I also get to reward my 3 dogs with plain boiled chicken for their meal. Added carrots, extra shitake and green beans in the filling. Sauce was just right. Crust was superb. Can't wait to eat this again. Froze 1/2 for dinner next week. Husband loved it.

*Incredible*, even with frozen pie crusts! I mixed a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream into the mix.

I'm rating the crust of this recipe only, as I used my own filling. The crust was flaky but hearty enough to stand up to a savory filling. Very good...will definitely use again.

This was very good..a lot of work though. I made two versions because i dont eat meat and my husband does, so i used vegetarian chicken in one as well as vegetable broth. I couldn't find sun dried tomatoes so i used regular tomatoes and added carrots as others suggested. Will definately make this again!

Love, love, love this recipe! We usually add whatever veggies we have around and bake it in a single large glass casserole dish (usually 9x13). It is one of my most requested dinners!!!

Rating: 4
I thought the sauce was a bit thick, so I added extra stock - this was a mistake. When the pies are baked, moisture is released from the vegetables, so you need that thickness to balance it out. I added fresh corn kernels cut from two ears to the vegetables - I really like the pop/crunch these added. This will be one of my "special occasion" recipes from now on. Loved it.

I made these again last night for dinner. This is by far my favorite pot pie recipe. I always have chicken stock and almost always have some cooked chicken in the fridge, so this is super fast and easy. Wonderfully comforting on a brisk winter night.

Awesome! I took another reviewer's advice and keep unbaked extras in the freezer. They don't last long.

This was a great recipe to use up leftover chicken (thus saving a lot of the work involved in this recipe). Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious -- very rich, but delicious.

I've been making these for 9 years! Always make a double batch and freeze them! Nothing but wonderful raves and perfect to have on hand when guests show up unexpected! These are not JUST pot pies! They are memorable and worth every minute it takes to make!!!!

Yum!!! Made according to recipe but didn't have enough small baking dishes so used all the sauce and the recipe perfectly filled my souffle dish. Next time I will make only half of the pastry since that perfectly fit my need, and will try chicken base instead of beef.

This pie won first place at a pie-off at a friend's farm yesterday. Here's what I did differently: 1) made one large pie instead of 6; 2) baked for over an hour; 3) no egg glaze; 4) Used a cast iron skillet which kept it warm longer and added an aesthetic appeal. I didn't make the slits large enough so some filling snuck out the sides while baking. It took half the day to make, but would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This is a time consuming recipe but soooo worth it. I followed the recipe, with the exception of omitting the red bell peppers. I assembled everything 8 hours in advance, then baked them directly from the refrigerator. They turned out perfectly. Next time I would buy a slightly larger chicken and increase the mushrooms and green beans. I only ended up with enough filling to make 5 individual pies, yet I had at least one extra cup of the sauce left over. It is very flavorful and rich. You really only need a salad or something light to go with it. Next time, I would consider making them in my smaller ramekins. It would yield more of them, and it would be easier to eat a whole one, because they are so filling.

Ok I made it again and again it was great. this time I followed the directions closer and it was easier and better. Go for it.

I made this with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I have chicken stock (and veal, and duck, etc.) in the freezer all the time, so this was really, really fast and easy to make. Beautiful combination of textures, flavors and depth.

I made these for the second time. Used the Smart Balance 50/50 butter for the crust. Subbed peas for green beans and added carrots. Turned out great again. Love having a few of these stored in the freezer.

Ok Ok It came out grand. They all loved it. This is a lot of work, the first time. This will be easier and quicker next time I was a little worried that after all the work.... but there wasn't a crumb left. Be sure to wrap the pastry and not have it dry out waiting until the next day. and the wine, don't forget the wine.

highly additive! my tweaks: no red bells, halved the green onions, doubled up on mushrooms and green beans. i always make extra and somehow never have leftovers. ;p my family squeals with delight when i tell them we're having it for dinner! time consumming? yes. worth it? no doubt.

The best thing about this pot pie is the crust. I felt for the amount of work involved, the result was very disappointing. I think it would have been much better to roast bone-in chicken breasts and use the meat from those. Boiled chicken is flavorless. I think peas and carrots are essential for making the filling for a comfort food like chicken pot pie. In the past I have made this crust and put it on a much simpler filling and was far happier with the result.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and super easy, perfect for a cold winter evening. I used chicken base instead of beef base and did these in individual bowls. Prepped them the day before and left them in the fridge. The dough was delicious and easy to handle. I used one stick butter and one stick Smart Balance 50/50 - deep, rich flavor. I look forward to making this with root vegetables and veggie stock for a different take on the recipe.

I didn't really follow this recipe. But I used the filling technique to make double-crust turkey pot pies (Thanksgiving leftovers) and it works well even with plain-jane carrots peas and onions.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! The first time around, the recipe is very time consuming, especially if you make the homemade chicken stock (which i would recommend) but the second time I made it, it was a breeze and seeing as it is now a staple, it was worth the initial time investment. The only negative is that the crust is really heavy. Delicious, but just too heavy - I tried experimenting with less butter, but the crust would not form, so I had to use the full amount. I'm searching for a lighter, less heavy crust and then this will be perfect! The only modification I made was to add 4 oz. sweet corn, and it was really delicious!

I used the crust and sauce recipe with more traditional vegetables. It was rich and delicious. Froze the second pie and thawed before baking ... next time I'll bake straight from the freezer.

Yummy yummy yummy. The hard work and it was long and involved, was well worth it. Had people licking their plates. Do make the stock, it's wonderful and better than store bought. Had sauce left over as written and dough left....way too much dough....gave leftover sauce and dough to foody neighbor across the hall. I plan on passing this recipe along to my favorite people. Can't wait for cooler weather to whip it up again.

MMMM, mmm, mmmmm! Never baked a pot pie before and the recipe caught my eye. Used chicken stock, reduced the beef broth, used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Superb! Can't wait to make it again!

This was very delicious. I made a few additions to the filling. I added some diced carrots and frozen peas (omitting the green beans). I added 1/2 of a canned chipotle pepper. I also roasted some Baby Bella mushrooms and added them instead of the sauteed shitakes. This really is a jazzed up version of a typical pot pie. I froze two of them and hope they turn out well when I take them out and bake them later on.

This is a great dish. I have made it several times. I use the roasted chickens in the store and puff pastry sheets. I makes it quicker. I also make smaller pies and freeze them for another time. They do freeze well.

Delicious, but the recipe is TOO RICH. Just cut back a little on the butter and cream cheese and you'll have a meal that doesn't sit in your stomach like glue. I've made this countless times for my husband...I put the pies in french onion crocks w/ handles...and he loves it.

Absolutely divine. Made this for a winter luncheon and got rave reviews. Used 1 c ramekins instead of 2 c souffle dishes which was a perfect serving size for lunch. Followed the recipe except poached boneless chicken breasts in half broth and half water with carrots and onions to shortcut the sauce. Doubled the recipe to make 15 generous 1 c servings. The pastry is superb.

We've made thiwsrecipe a half dozen times or more suince it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It is an exceptional recipe, but it does take time to make. It is worth the time you invest in making the dish, though. The flavors have a way of blending together making this dish a luxurious blend of wonderful flavors and smells. The crust is marvelous and flakey. We even used this recipe for our gourmet dinner group main dish. It was a hit with everyone.

I was never a fan of pot pies before. But this recipe should have a special name. Or a special category. Since its publication years ago in Bon Appetit, my husband & I have made this dish each fall and frozen the pot pies in small ramekin dishes. They freeze wonderfully and are a comforting, flavor-packed dish to come home to after a long day at the office. Granted, they take some time to put together initially. But once done and frozen, you will find the effort worthwhile. These are not pot pies; They are heaven.

I served this last night for a dinner party for 4 and froze 2 servings for another dinner. My guests said it was the best pot pie they've ever had. This version is unlike I've ever had before. I used red and yellow pepper for colour, please replaced one of the onions in the filling with a sliced leek. I also used 3 kinds of mushrooms. oh my it was SO yummy! I am going to make a creamy version of swiss steak tonight for dinner with the left over sauce. By the way, I don't have a food processor so I found the crust very hard to work with. It is NOT a simple recipe.

This is my favorite chicken pot pie recipe. Always a hit. It does take some time. So, if I'm in a hurry I use store bought rotisserie chicken instead. Freezes and keeps well.

Absolutely the best chicken pot pie ever! Best of all, it freezes well and tastes just as good a month later! My sons prefer it made in a deep dish pie pan because there is more crust. When I fly to California to visit my older, I usually have a frozen pot pie in my carryon!

This had WAY too many ingredients - why do you need leeks AND onions in the stock. Also, the sundried tomatoes and green beans added nothing.

This is the best pot pie I've ever tasted! The first time I made it I used chicken breasts (faster) and substituted portabello mushrooms because that's all I had. I would suggest that someone making this should not substitute carrots & potatoes, etc. in place of the sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. The unusual ingredients are what makes this pie so surprisingly wonderful--otherwise it's just your run-of-the-mill chicken pot pie and you could just use any old recipe! I've served this for guests who probably assumed it was "just" pot pie... it was fun to see their faces when they bit into this dish full of unexpected flavors! A great dish to serve on a cold winter evening!

This was wonderful the only thing I'd change is use only one red bell pepper and put in peas (on eating, it always seemed like I was getting a fork full of bell pepper. I'd let it sit a bit to cool a little, when I served it straight from the oven everyone was blowing on there fork full or tossing it around i there mouth cos it was piping hot. Delicious and all 4 of us big eaters were satisfied- everyone raved and the crust is melt in your mouth. Will definitely keep this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! The crust is outstanding and so easy to work with. I have made it w/ seasoned chicken breast and w/ roasted chicken and I can't tell much of a difference. The chicken breasts save a whole lot of time. The only thing I would say is that there is quite a bit of sauce left over. But it's a great recipe to use when you need to clean out the fridge!

I have made this recipe 4x now. I make it only once a year in the winter, perfect comfort food! My husband looks forward to potpie DAY! What makes this dish a winner is that it is not your traditional pot pie. We always invite friends over and they are always pleasantly surprised by the taste. It is VERY time consuming but well worth the effort!

This is one of the best Pot Pies I have ever tasted. I agree with the time comments, but for a rainy day with little else to do it is perfect! I have some picky kids and I leave out the mushrooms and peppers and add the carrots cooked with the chicken in half of it and they will eat it with no problem. Goofy kids!

I have made this recipe 3 times. Although time-consuming (so what if that's all I do for a day!), the rewards are great. As we like to say "there's love in it." I don't have the right-sized ramikins, so I make it in a souffle dish. I agree with the comments about why so much sauce.

Rating: 4
Wow, what a mouthful!! This was extremely labor intensive, but worth every bite! I made the filling (adding more mushrooms and green beans) and the crust the night before and assembled the pies the next day. If I'm ever in a rush, I might try this using canned chicken stock. Excellent pies!

This makes a big, rich serving per person. The crust is good, but, wow, it's 97% butterfat! To make just enough sauce for the pies with no leftovers, use five tablespoons flour and five tablespoons butter with the three cups of reduced stock, and add 1 cup of milk (I stayed away from the cream in the recipe, see comments on crust, above).

Rating: 3
This was very good tasting. I used indivdual pie dishes and the servings were just right for us. I don't quite understand why the sauce part of the recipe could not be proportioned to the recipe. There is enough sauce to make another whole recipe. Allow about 2-3 hours from start to ready to put in the oven on this recipe. There is a lot of chopping.

I have made this recipe twice now - for special occasions - the second time I just used chicken breasts - much easier to do. The nice thing is that it the pies can be made up the day before and baked just prior to serving. A keeper!

Only an okay dish. The crust was kind of boring and bland, even though I added lots of black pepper to it, and did nothing for me. The green beans, nicely cooked and not too firm when I added them to the pies, seemed to grow firmer overnight in the fridge and the next day tasted embarressingly undercooked. Next time I'll just use the mushrooms and tomatoes in a different recipe.

I would make it again, but with modifications. I found it hard to believe that it called for 4 1/2 tsps beef base. Chicken base, for sure. The crust was very good. I have frozen 4 of the pies and crusts separately, and will add some sage before I bake them.

I modified the base of the recipe quite a bit. I prefer a typical chicken pot pie, so I left out the recipes vegetables and added onions, celery, carrots, and peas. The crust is very rich, flaky, and flavorful.
