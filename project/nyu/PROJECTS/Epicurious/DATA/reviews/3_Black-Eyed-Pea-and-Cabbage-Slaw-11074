Great recipe - always nice to find a new way to use cabbage and beans. I only made half the recipe and substituted red cabbage for green, rice wine vinegar for white wine vinegar, and two cans of black-eyed peas instead of soaking my own. I let the canned beans simmer with the bay leaf and parsley for about 15 minutes and cooled them off in the fridge before adding them to the rest of the salad. Don't be afraid of the horseradish or dijon mustard; the vinegar settles them down quite nicely. Served with lemon pepper chicken. Yummy!

This made a very pretty and colourful salad, and a nice twist on regular coleslaw, but unfortunately I think it contributed to my recent realisation that I don't really care for raw cabbage.

A good way to add "hidden" nutrition to a side-dish. It makes good use of an often overlooked (and very inexpensive) pair of vegetables. I will sneak this dish in for summer with the calorie-laden over-the-top grilled bar-b-que ribs.

I found this to be an interesting combination. I used creamed horseradish and the recipe came out fantastic. I would make this recipe again for a summer get together.
