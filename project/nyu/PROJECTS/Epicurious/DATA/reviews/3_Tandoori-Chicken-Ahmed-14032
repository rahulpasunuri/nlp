Used home-made kefir instead od yogurt, marinated overnight. Meat was very moist and tender. Delicious! Served simple spiced pilaw topped with cubed cucumbers fried in butter.

the deep red color of restaurant tandoori chicken comes from artificial food coloring, so it's more authentic without it! :-)

Nice spice, chicken was very moist and tasty. I would increase the sauce next time to have more to baste the chicken in. One drawback- The chicken didn't take on that deep red color of traditional tandoori chicken, so the dish wasn't that asthetically pleasing. Overall great.

Made this for my family, I marinated tofu in the sauce...we were all pleased. I used drumsticks as well as wings to make it "kid friendly." I marinated overnight & was told it was super-moist. Also, I used purchased ground cardamom rather than the pods & grinding myself. It's very easy & a crowd pleaser, will certainly make again.

A great, easy, make-ahead meal that you can do in quantity to nibble on during the week for lunch or snacks. I'm making it for the second time tonight.

Too salty and not enough spice! It wasn't quite the traditionally made "pink chicken" I have had before. I guess I'm just going to have to make a phone call back home to get the results I've been craving! It was a good dish, and my husband (who hasn't had tandoori before) enjoyed it.

This is an excellent dish whose low-impact preparation belies the outstanding results! I made a few changes to the recipe to suit my family's tastes: (1) removed the skins from the drumsticks and (2) increased the amount of cardamom called for. The results are even better served the day after, though thre are rarely any left over!

very easy to make, very zippy flavor, the chicken was moist, and the complexity of taste would never give away how simple it is to throw together!

I like this recipe but, heck, this is one e-a-s-y recipe if you're short on time or energy, but can marinate it overnight, which I think was very worthwhile. I grilled it and prefer that method. RE: CARDAMOM PODS -- if you can't find fresh green pods, try bottled whole cardamom seeds and grind those, which I found in a whole foods market (these were by "Frontier." As a last resort use bought ground cardamom, but this wonderfully fragrant spice quickly loses its oomph when stored ground.

A truly tasty recipe which I have used a few times now. The chicken is moisy, tangy and easy to make. You might have some problems finding Cardamom pods though - try checking your local asian food store :)
