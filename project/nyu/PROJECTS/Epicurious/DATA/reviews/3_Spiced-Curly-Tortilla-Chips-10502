Really fun to do with the kids. I used flour tortillas instead, gave the kids a choice of spices, extended cooking time to 12 minutes and they turned out great. This would be perfect for custom shapes and flavors for spicing up those 'usual' salads and chilis. Just be careful - that golden crisp can quicly transform into dark brown burned crisps.

We loved these! They are great with Tortilla Soup! I sprinkled mine with one third sea salt; one third garlic salt and one third chili powder!
