Any recipe that calls for cubes of rare roast beef to be twice cooked for that time period will make it come out leathery. A better and considerably moister method would be to make a beef stew with vegetables first. Thicken the gravy and spoon into individual ramekins, then follow the recipe for the yorkshire pudding. Pour the batter along the sides of the dishes and bake accordingly. The pudding is a perfect foil for a good gravy and you can use a less expensive cut of meat. A side salad of pears and blue cheese and a slice of cherry pie would round out this meal good enough for company.

Absolutely delicious from start to finish. The Yorkshire Pudding recipe was perfect! I made the batter two days in advance and kept it in the refigerator until just before ready to use.

This dish has a nice flavor but I agree with the cook from Costa Mesa....it is quite dry & needs some gravy....perhaps it can be cooked with the recipe or served on the side as she suggested. Has anyone tried adding before baking?

This recipe seemed quite nice to me at first glance but it proved a failure. My pudding crusts were after having baked for half an hour still soft and moist on the inside while the beef had become leathery. I also liked the horseradish less than I thought I would. Great disappointment! After a few bites I let it sit and the carrot, apple and horseradish salad which should have accompanied it I enjoyed with a pizza. Will never make this again!

Can anyone tell me if this recipe can be made ahead or will the dish suffer? I was thinking of bringing one large pot pie to a potluck. Thanks

I hope for leftover beef so that I can make this recipe!

I also used mild italian sausage. It was good, but next time I will use roast beef and serve with a dollop of gravy on the top to moisten it up.

Tried this recipe with sausages. Was wonderful, used mild Itallian sausages, potato, parsnips, carrots, and peas. The yorkshire puffed up beautifully and my 'Brit' husband loved it.

Was the author a Brit? My husband is and thinks roast beef and yorkshire pudding are national treasures. Try replacing half of the potatoes with cook parsnip or even carrots, and use Pickapeppa sauce (if you can find it) instead of worchestershire.

Great way to use up leftovers from the holiday! Seasoning is important. Add a little bam (cayenne) to kick it up a notch!

Great way to use up left over roast beef and it tastes great also.
