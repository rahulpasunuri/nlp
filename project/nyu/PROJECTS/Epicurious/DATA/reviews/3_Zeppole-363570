These aren't real zeppole: where's the filling? Traditional Zeppole, from Naples, are filled with pastry cream made with milk,eggs,sugar and flour. This is the real recipe (with video): http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/desserts-fruits-1/zeppole-fritters.aspx

I made these last weekend and they were snarfed up by the whole family. I made a 1/2 batch and used 4 large eggs. They were a little 'eggy'. I also do not have a deep fryer and the oil was definitely not regulated well so they got darker on the outside than I really wanted. I may try putting the cinnamon in the batter next time for extra flavor, and maybe even fill them with a little lemon curd.

I'd make the balls smaller per the Bon App version (search epicurious.com), but follow the proportions and prep from this Primo restaurant recipe. A heaping tablespoon took long to cook to the center, so I made them more like a heaping teaspoon in size. Delish! It's fun when they turn over by themselves as they brown. Be sure to let them go darker golden to ensure the center is cooked through. Who doesn't love a fresh, hot donut? Every culture has it!

Disappointed with the result! I thought they would be crispy. They came out too oily and kind of soggy. I spent one full hour preparing them and 2 hours cleaning up.

Zeppole....i think not. Try typing zeppole and the receipe you will find will look nothing like this! The zeppole i know r filled w/pastry cream similar to a choux but piped. Originally made for St. Joseph's day March 19th...

I tried this - essentially it's like eating Mexican churros in the shape of a ball with the cinnamon added before cooking instead of after. Of course they're delicious if eaten fresh and the batter is light enough.

An absolute must-have when you visit Primo! No meal is complete without a bowl of their zeppole! So excited to find this recipe here. My favorite donut by my favorite chef!

I was so excited to see this. Zeppole is a fond childhood memory of mine. I will try it this weekend and I hope it's as good as I remember...
