I've made this cake countless times. I must admit, I now beat the eggs and sugars to a mousse first, then add dry ingredients and buttermilk, then finally melted butter and chocolate. This is much more reliable! Also, I've made it as 2 small and 1 big cakes, and it's definitely easier to keep under control when doing 2 smaller cakes. The other thing is, at times I haven't had any buttermilk, so I've just used regular milk with a splash of vinegar to sour it. I've also used milk chocolate instead of bittersweet and that worked fine too. A pretty forgiving recipe really.

A great, easy to make cake. Per other comments, there are a few things to keep in mind when making a cake. The first is butter, leavening, liquids, and ingredient order. Since this recipe requires you to add all of the ingredients together, it gets a bit tricky to mix sufficiently without overmixing, thereby killing the leavening. So, I put the butter and brown sugar in first, because the butter was chilled and wouldn't incorporate well if I didn't mix it first. I then added all of the dry ingredients, and started mixing them in with the butter and b. sugar. Once that had been just mixed, I added the buttermilk. As a result, the cake turned out perfectly formed and moist. It was a hit tonight at my mother's birthday party!

I tried this recipe some time ago. The result was a very good, tasty cake. To assure results, I used the traditional method (beat sugar with butter, adding eggs, etc.). Maybe that's why it worked for me.

An unmitigated disaster. After reading all the reviews very carefully, calibrating the scales and doing everything exactly as written. Sunk in the middle and falling to bits on the outside. This was going to be my daughter's 18th birthday cake. At least the pigs will appreciate it.

I reviewed this recipe awhile back because it is amazing. I did go through a terrible time this summer though because it did start sinking in the middle when the cake was about 3/4 of the done. I was so frustrated because I couldnt figure out why I had made it successfully before. Anyway I noticed that during the summer I was leaving the butter out to soften and it was really soft. The batter would whip up really fluffy (which was different from before). So I wondered if for some reason the butter temp made more air bubbles in the batter. So I tried it with butter more on the cold side. For example the first thing I would do would be to take the butter out of the fridge, cut it up then go on to work on getting the rest of the ingredients together. IT WORKED! I have not had a problem with the cake since. I was truely almost ready to give up on it (I am a cake decorater and I wanted a recipe I could count on...I hate rebaking!!) It works perfectly every time. Whoever says it is dry must not be baking it correctly because it is wonderfully moist for me. Also if you get premium cocoa, it makes a huge difference in the flavor too.

This is the worst chocolate cake recipe I've ever seen. It is dry dry dry. Other reviewers said it was too crumbly--that doesn't even begin to describe it. What a waste.

Love the taste, but is anyone having problems with the cake sinking in the middle? I don't think it's a cooking issue, (I'm baking at 325F for sligtly longer, till done) and it's very exaggerated when I make this cake in 12" square pans.

I just made this recipe and was thrilled. I have been searching for a really good scratch cake for some time now. I do notice a diffence though with this posted recipe vs. the recipe in her book which actually weighs instead of measures the ingredients. I am wondering if that is why some people's results have not been as good? Weighing really is much more accurate. In the book she calls for 10 oz flour 10 oz granulated sugar, 6 oz brown sugar, 3 oz cocoa powder, 6 oz. melted chocolate. My cake was not dry or crumbly at all. It was very dense, but I like that.

When Toba calls for an 8" pan in her recipes, she does not mean the 8" non-stick pans folks get at the market or Target. Being a professional baker, she means professional aluminum cake pans. The difference being that general home-use cake pans are 1 1/2" tall. Standard Professional cake pans are 2" tall, which she specifically mentions in her recipes. This recipe works perfectly in two professional aluminum 8" cake pans. It will overflow your 8 x 1 1/2" pans. In addition, professional pans are usually more straight-sided than the usual home-use ones. This makes it easier to get a really smooth, even, straight sided cake for frosting. These pans are well worth buying and can be ordered online for a few dollars or at your local craft/cake decorating store. BTW, I followed the recipe exactly and found my holy grail of chocolate cakes with this recipe.

This cake was terrible. I used all the right ingredients, followed recommendations of 8" pans and not overcooking, and it was so crumbly that I couldn't use it. Had to buy another birthday cake for my daughter at the last minute. Terribly disappointing

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. First of all, there was so much batter that I used 9" pans instead of 8". I adjusted the baking time accordingly. The cakes were not done at 40 minutes, but were perfect at 45 minutes. However the cake was not as moist as I anticipated, considering it contains butter and regular buttermilk (not reduced fat). The top cracked which made the frosting process difficult. Pieces of cake top were moving about as I frosted. My family agreed it was good but not great. Won't make again.

This cake was rich and really chocolatey, however, I did find it a bit dry & crumbly. I've been on a quest for the perfect chocolate cake but I'll keep looking.

I used half Callebaut wafers and half bakers chips for the melted chocolate, low fat buttermilk and baked this in a "daisy" cake pan from Nordic ware. It's a generous recipe so used the rest of the dough for cupcakes. It was easy and the cupcakes actually had a dome top- something most recipes don't seem to create. The cake looked great when turned out with just icing sugar sprinkled over it. Kids thought the cake was even better on day 2.

FINALLY - a rich chocolatey cake recipe! I've been searching for something like this forever! I followed the recipe except used 2 ozs milk and 4 ozs semi-sweet chocolate because that's what I had. I cooked this in 2 9" rounds and had a bit leftover. It needed to bake for an additional 10 minutes (but my oven is having its own issues). I think next time I make this (which will be for my daughter's 8th birthday party) I'll toss in some milk chocolate chips. You can never have too much chocolate, can you?

Folks who are complaining of the crumblies: Your cake will be less apt to crumble if you Do not use lowfat butter milk or margarine in this cake. It needs all that lovely fat to stick together nicely. If you just cannot use whole cream butter milk, use curdled evaporated milk. Also, in my experience it rarely takes the alloted time to bake this cake. I've taken it out 10 minutes early and had a happy, not dry, cake.

I have made and served this cake to guests many times with raves. It is so easy to make. I freeze it and cut layers in half and frost with chocolate whipped cream and put cherry or strawberry jam between a couple of layers.

This cake just didn't live up to expectations for me - the ease of preparation was great, but the result was just okay...a little on the dry side and too crumbly. I checked my ingredients and it appears I measured right...I expected something much more moist and dark chocolatey. I used premium chocolate. Don't know why it wasn't better, but I wouldn't make it again. The recipe in the Hershey cookbook is much better...should have stuck with that one.

I've been trying different chocolate cake recipes for years, searching for the perfect one. This is it! I didn't change anything about the recipe, although it needed 10 or 12 minutes more cooking time, which could just mean my oven is a little off...just keep checking it with a cake tester. Yes, the cake will rise over the pans, but won't spill over. If you have extra batter, make a few cupcakes!

After reading all the comments regarding pan size, I was worried about how my cake would turn out. I think I've solved the cake pan size mystery -- my batter did in fact fit within two 8" pans that I purchased from Williams & Sonoma -- they are heavy duty, professional cake pans that are deeper than any other cake pan I've owned in the past. The cake did in fact rise above the rim of the pans, but did not overflow. After the cakes cooled, they deflated a bit and settled just below the rim. So, in short, the recipe was perfect for my pan size. As for the cake itself, it certainly was way more rich than I had expected -- it was like a cross between a flourless chocolate cake and a typical lighter cake. Good flavor, but super rich. I frosted it with a chocolate buttercream and placed seedless raspberry preserves in the center -- the raspberry flavor was a perfect compliment. In the future, however, I think I will make a sigle layer cake and serve it with raspberry coulis and whipped cream. It seemed a bit much as a double layer cake, and I'm a huge chocolate fan.

This is without question the best chocolate cake I have ever made- as other reviewers have mentioned, it produces far too much batter for two 8" pans, but having a little extra batter never bothered me.

I took this to a potluck and it didn't last 5 minutes. My husband was able to scrounge some crumbs and he graciously gave me a bite -- heavenly, rich and chocolatey!! I baked it in three 8"x1.5" pans, which was just about right, and had to bake about 20 minutes longer. I made it into a layer cake with Tangy Chocolate Frosting. The layers fell apart when frosting (my kids sticking their fingers in it didn't help) and it looked completely disastrous (I almost didn't take it) but the taste and texture were outstanding and nobody complained!! Next time I would make as a sheet cake, or maybe a layer cake with 2 large squares. Last week I made the Double Chocolate Layer Cake from this site, which my husband requested as his "birthday cake" -- now he's torn between the two.

VERY crumbly cake but oh-so-dark and moist. It's also not too sweet so a good complement to other flavours. I made this as a four layer cake so it didn't matter that each layer broke into at least three pieces- the mocha raspberry mousse (Death by Chocolate Cakes) held it all together. (Melt 6oz unsweetened chocolate while beating 2 1/4c whipping cream [NOT chilled], 1/2c sugar and 1T instant coffee to soft peaks. Fold 1/2 whipped cream into chocolate, then remainder. Fold in 1 pint fresh raspberries.) Like a previous reviewer I, too, gave the butter and sugar a bit of a stir before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also found that 2-9" pans were almost too small for this recipe and will try 3-8" (or even 9") next time.

Excellent texture and taste. Serving this is an easy way to make yourself popular. However, the technique of whizzing all the ingredients together did not work so well for me because I found myself fussing over the room-temperature butter which did not incorporate. I have read that batter with curdled appearance should work out fine, but who wants to take chances when there is precious chocolate and a whopping cup of cocoa at stake? Next time I'll be creaming the butter and sugar first until I understand what kind of a mixer the author intended. Still, of the dozen chocolate cakes I have tried out, this is the best one: not as cloying as a flourless one and more chocolatey than any of the cakey ones.

Seriously, I have never smoked in my life and after tasting the crumbs (having leveled the cake) I'm pretty sure I need a cigarette. I've been on the search for the platonic ideal of a chocolate cake for the past 10 years and this is it. Honestly, this is the only recipe I will ever use from now on. It's like I've found the Holy Grail but with frosting.

I made this cake in 2 8 " pans. It was moist, dense and perfect. I made the chocolate buttercream icing with the choc. liqueur that was suggested and it also was perfect. The cakes rose higher than the pans, but I took a cake leveler and brought them down even with the rims before turning them out. I took the cake to work and it was raved over and demolished. I'm thinking that it was not crumbly because I used the size of pan called for. It was dense, moist, and brownie-like but not too sweet. Just perfect. It makes a tall cake. I loved it and will make it again and again.

Intense chocolate flavour and moist. I used two 9x2 round cake pans and the batter looked like it was too much. It was done in 40 minutes. I don't know how it would fit into two 8" round cake pans. Next time I will try using two 10x2 round pans.

i was very surpirsed by the result of this recipe. throwing all the ingredients together sounded insane, and i couldn't get the butter to incorporate very well. i still had small pieces of butter when i poured the mix into the pans (because of earlier reviews, i used 3 - 8" pans which was perfect). to my surprise this cake was amazing! incredibly moist, very fudgy, and intensely chocolate. i used a simple whipped ganache for icing and had so many requests for the recipe at the party i took it to. the cake was completely gone in minutes (leaving several other cakes untouched). this is a keeper! unconventional in method, but outstanding in results!

Very delicious and easy to make. I only gave it three forks because the cake is quite crumbly and that effects presentation. The texture is like a dense moist brownie. I'll definitely make it again but in a long pan instead of as a layer cake.

I made this cake in two 9x9x3 inch pans. When it cooled, it first came out crumbly so i wrapped them in saran wrap overnight and it was much easier to cut. The cake itself came out very dense. I have a new oven and I can not get adjusted to it so I am not sure if this is the proper texture. I sliced each layer in threes and put peanut butter mousse in between the layers, frosted it in peanut butter buttercream and ganached the whole thing. It was for a client so I am not sure how it was but will find out next week. Ive been trying to locate a DARK chocolate cake mix that is moist and light (like the box mises) but I am having a hard time doing so. Does any one have a suggestion or recipe? thanks.

I haven't yet made this recipe but I'm really confused about what size pan to use since everyone has said they've used different sizes. Does anybody know what size pan I should use if I want to make it a single layer cake??

I really liked this cake, it was rich and delicious. Because I didn't have three 8x8 pans, I used one 8x8 and one 9x13. The layer from the 8x8 came out perfect and kept together very well, but the layer from the 9x13 crumbled and fell apart when moved. Nobody cared, though - this cake is good enough that everybody was just as happy to eat the disintegrated chunks.

Good cake but 2 8" pans are WAY too small. The batter blossomed up like muffins and it took over an hour to bake through. 3 8" pans would be perfect, and also bake a lot faster. But yes, very chocolatey and very moist.

Easy and delicious - what more could you want in a chocolate cake? Followed the recipe exactly (but forgot to add the vanilla!) though I also used slightly larger cake pans. Made it for my daughter's birthday when we were having a couple of adult guests over and everyone raved. The recipe makes about 16 slices because the cake is very rich. My friend insisted that I print a copy of it out so she can make it herself. Topped it with chocolate frosting with chocolate chips - a winner if you're a chocoholic!

To MN regarding icing. When I first saw the buttercream etc. it was in last months Home section under desserts. I'm glad I bought the book because I have to refer to it each time I want to make a quick copy because I have a hard time remembering how it's listed..chocolate buttercream icing won't get you there. The buttercream is on Epicurious recipe site under Chocolate Buttercream (only)...the Ganache is under Ganache (only)..and all are from The Well Decorated Cake by Toba Garrett..read reviews tho' for buttercream..makes more than enough for two cakes..excellent tho'. Good Luck..

I have to admit I was skeptical of the instructions, having never made a baked goods recipe where you poured all wet and dry ingredients together, but the result was wonderful. I used a 9x12 pyrex and it turned out moist with an intense chocolate taste and fudgy texture-yum!

After reading all of the previous reviews I couldn't wait to try this recipe. Noting that the recipe made a large mixture I used a 12x9 inch pan which was perfect. I don't like anything overly sweet so I cut down on the sugar (I'm glad I did it was just right)& I also added chopped walnuts and topped the cake with a chocolate fudge sauce. YUM! I will be making the cake again soon for my workmates on my birthday. A very easy and delicious cake to make.
