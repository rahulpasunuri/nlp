I liked the method of making the cauliflower steaks, however the puree left something to be desired. For the looks, this recipe does not deliver the "wow!" I expected in terms of taste. Next time might try with another sauce, or really add a lot of veggie stock base or cheese to the puree or something to jazz it up a bit.

Simple, straight forward recipe with excellent taste and presentation. Added a pinch of red pepper for some kick and a smashed clove of garlic to the milk. As some others have done, I used whole milk in place of the water. We will most definitely serve this to company in the future.

I bought the most gorgeous cauliflower at the farmer's market over the weekend and this was such a great recipe for it. I didn't have milk, so I used half & half instead, also added some roasted garlic and pecorino to the puree, which added a little sharpness and depth. Will make again - might try a vegan version next time. Hmmm ...

Puree was delicious. The "steaks" were not as tender as I'd like.

Nice recipe! A roasted clove of garlic enhanced the flavor of the puree. Reducing the milk/water mixture while the steaks were in the oven appealed to my frugality and I think enriched the puree. Yummy!!

Quick and delicious. Subbed yogurt for the milk. Sweated garlic and white onion for the puree, with a dash of red pepper flake and lemon juice. Served with cornmeal polenta.

I warmed up to this dish as I was eating it. I mainly cook vegetarian meals so I served this as the main entree with a salad. I enjoyed this dish and would make it again, but as a side dish instead. To me it wasn't quite enough to be the main entree. It does look beautiful when plated though.

Very easy and delicious, added a little grated Parmesan to the puree. Will make it again for sure.

Have made this several times with and with out the sauce. WHen no sauce I make extra steaks. It is very important to dry the cauliflower in the over although it may be tempting to skip this step. Next time I'll use milk for the whole thing rather than using water. Also, strictly use high quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Finished with Truffle Oil before serving once and that was a huge hit.

I usually only make a recipe once (life is short, right?) and tonight, after taking her first bite of the cauliflower steak and puree, my partner made me promise to make it again. And again. It took a bit longer to brown than 2 min per side, just an fyi. Great vegetarian dish. Unusual and satisfying.

Delicious! I'm always looking for other veg side recipes and this one is a keeper! My mods: cooked in unsweetened, almond/coconut milk and veg stock instead of reg milk and water. Added nutmeg, garlic, paprika and lots of salt and pepper. Brushed steaks with truffle oil before sauteing.

My vegitarian daughter loved this. It made too much sauce but we used it later on other diahes. It's more of an appitizer than a maid dish.

I thought this was a great dish and wonderful as a leftover, too. And this is coming from someone who doesn't particularly love cauliflower. Based on earlier reviews, I substituted the water with vegetable broth, added a bit of paprika, peppercorns and a garlic clove to the simmering florets, and about a quarter cup of shredded parmesan to the puree. I also substituted skim milk for the whole just because it was what I had in the house and didn't seem to affect the flavor. The carmelized steaks themselves were great- such a different flavor than just steaming them! http://aunaturalefood.blogspot.com/20 11/10/box-by-any-other-name-recipe- alert.html

Delicious! My husband and I both were surprised by how flavorful and hearty this tasted. It could easily be a main course item, especially for vegetarians. I substituted unsweetened almond milk for the milk and added some truffle oil.

Brushed the steaks with truffle oil, added a bit of chicken broth to the milk water combination Looks Great, Tastes Great and is a terrific new way to serve cauliflower My starch-aholic husband loved it I'm adding it my regular repetoire

My husband and I loved this. We used almond milk (unsweetened) as the liquid and brushed the "steaks" with truffled olive oil before browning & baking. We also cooked the cauliflower florets for closer to 20 minutes at 350 degrees in order to get them to brown/carmelize a bit before blending. It was fantastic! Served it with Beef Short Ribs!

I gave this one 3 forks because it is good as written but has the potential to be outstanding with some small tweeks. Simmer with 1 large garlic clove and a few pearl onions. Use all the cooking liquid. Make the puree. Add 2Tbs chopped cilantro and 4 oz cheddar cheese. Wait 2-3 min until it melts. Sprinkle a pinch of chili powder over plate for taste & color when serving.

to be honest, iam disgusted whole afternoon from this Cauliflower puree. Steaks were quite good, but Puree was a big mistake. I let florets 20 minutes in oven to get more taste out, but after mixed i still felt its little bland, so i added some garlic and parmesan as other reviewers suggested. I used just 1 clove of garlic and it anyway overpowered everything else. Parmesan was also just a big waste of otherwise good ingredient. I thought until now, garlic and parmesan cannot really destroy some food, but this is first example. I will definitely not make this food again, nor recommend it. I give it 2 stars because i am sure original puree recipe would be not that terrible. Its just califlower-califlower combination - little too narrow to be interesting. Not worth the complicated preparation, even if it does look interesting.

This is an outstanding recipe! For added flavor I used roasted walnut oil in place of the veg oil. Also, boil in veg broth and add a pinch of nutmeg. Lovely dish!

A delicious alternative to boring cauliflower. Made as instructed and found the florets needed longer than ten minutes in the oven to bring out that roasted flavor. We ate it with creamy polenta and a mushroom miso gravy ( recipes from epicurious) It was a hearty fall meal that warmed us up. Aesthetically it could have used some more color as the dish was monochromatic.

This recipe is delicious. I used nonfat milk (because that;s what we had in the house) and I doubt it affected the recipe's flavors. Next time I would add something rich to the puree to give the dish a little luxury. But the seared flavor on the steaks was outstanding and VERY satisfying. http://foodshethought.blogspot.com/2010/08/sunday-afternoon-experimentation.html

Looks great, very tasty. I made this with a purple cauliflower, which made for a festive lavender puree. The browned steak was delicious and nutty, but the puree could have used a little bit more character. Next time I'll bake the puree at 350 too, hopefully to bring out a little more nutty flavor, and maybe add a pad of butter. I drizzled a little truffle oil as suggested by another reviewer, and it was delicious.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly per the instructions, but I was sure to season liberally per the other reviewers' comments. It came out great. OK, I did make 2 changes. I baked the steaks at 250 for 30 minutes in parallel with the florets, and I used 2% milk. Next time I'll add truffle oil at the end.

Rating: 4
The cauliflower puree is my go to side dish when I want a substitute for mashed potatoes. I think that the reviewers who thought it was bland may not have used enough salt OR skipped the drying. The drying brings out a nutty essences and helps intensify the flavor. I also like to make the steaks as a different side. My latest riff on the puree is to thin it with more cooking liquid to a soup like consistency. Serve it with pieces of steamed lobster tail drizzling a lemon, chive, parsley oil over it. This was inspired by a dish from Nancy Oakes' Boulevard.

This recipe is awesome! For the puree, instead of milk I used coconut milk and it turned out amazing ( 2 cups water to one cup coconut milk and a pinch of salt). Served it with a side or garlic turnip greens....delicious!

This is a great recipe! I made just the "steaks" and skipped the puree. They had a very nice,rich, nutty flavor. My husband gobbled these up, which believe me, is a miracle in itself. The only change I made was that I increased the oven temperature to 300 degrees and baked the "steaks" for an extra 10 minutes to get them nice and tender. Enjoy!

Excellent alternative to mashed potatoes. I did modify this recipe by adding rosemary and garlic, using 2% milk, and just used olive oil cooking spray to make it low cal. It was a very good, though it took a bit more time than I am willing to spend on a side dish for everyday meals.

YUMMY! I added tarragon & dill weed. I then broiled it at the end. It was so good.

This was a great recipe, but needed tweaking. I added a clove of garlic to the simmering florets, plus some chicken base. I used a stick immersion blender and ended up using all of the liquid (despite taking out a cup and then adding it back in). I added an ounce of grated parm and two ounces of processed cheese (I know, I can hear the groans, but it worked). Like another reviewer, I added sauteed vegetables in a mound at the base of the steak to give more color and flavor. The saute consisted of onion, trumpet mushrooms, swiss chard and sherry. This was a very good meal and one that I would serve at a vegetarian dinner party. As written, though, just three stars.

I added garlic and parmesan to the puree, and I really liked it, although my DH was unimpressed. The crispy cauliflower 'steaks' were yummy though. Mmmm. To make this more of a meal I served it with wilted spinach and steamed carrots, and a poached egg on top. The runny egg yolk with the puree was a great combination.

The steaks were delicious! However, the puree was bland! Salt and pepper were not quite enough so I added white pepper and garlic salt to taste. I also made a lower fat version substituting fat-free half-and-half for the whole milk. The 2 tablespoons of oil, on the other hand, were just about right. Also, I ended up using two heads of cauliflower in order to get nice, big, thick steaks. Lastly, I would leave the puree a little thicker just so it can stand up to the steaks. Enjoy this tasty dish!

Loved this! Added white pepper instead of black as I do to all of my white veggies! This is a keeper.

From looking at the recipe, I thought it needed something extra so I changed it a bit. I roasted carrots, onions, squash, broccoli florets (I had left over from the nite before) and added edamame.Any veggies you have would do. I served the dish as pictured with roasted veggies on top. My husband, a true meat eater said it would make a great entree! Truly worth doing. I like the reviewer that said don't bother drying the florets. In the puree I added all the cooking liquid. Definately a repeat!

Rating: 3
Great idea, but skip the "drying" of the boiled cauliflower - you're about to puree them in the liquid they were boiled in and they do not need to be dried off! Using chicken broth instead of the boiling water, adding boursin or any other soft rich cheese makes this incredible. I also skip the "steaks" for weeknights but they are impressive for entertaining.

make sure to get good color on the cauliflower. i used two cloves of garlic in the mash as well and added a little truffle oil to the finished product.

The puree was very good. I added some garlic cloves that I poached in a little half and half first. Also used the liquid from that when I pureed it. My family thought they were garlic mashed potatoes! The "steaks" were a nice addition, but I think I will make only the puree next time!

Yummy. Cauliflower puree is a good substitute for mashed potatoes. I happened to have roasted garlic on hand and used it with the puree. It probably wouldn't have been as tasty without it. We also really liked the "steaks". Fried cauliflower is so great! You could skip the steaks and puree and fry florets in olive oil then sprinkle lightly with cumin.

Yummy and very pretty. I put a garlic clove in when roasting the cauliflower for the puree - good result. Pureed only for a short time so it was thick. Worked even better the 2nd time w/ brocciflower - nice color and earthier flavor.

Not exceptionally heavily flavored, but the visual impact is incredible. The taste is very mild; I can not imagine eating this as an entree as the introduction suggests. Possibly with some stronger flavored oil, or a spritz of truffle oil.

This is great, and if you want some added color to the puree, you can add roasted red peppers to the blender, or toss in some broccoli flourets with the cauliflower flourets, depending on your mood. A little cheese is great for the flavor, too - I used a little ricotta I had left over.

Wow, I am still savoring the flavors of this recipe, and I am also still getting rave reviews from my husband. This is by far one of the most elegant, delicious and unique side dishes I made. It is also my first review. I followed the recipe almost to a tee, probably cooking it a bit longer than required I also used non-fat milk. I slowly added the reserved broth, using only about 1/2 cup as I pureed the cauliflower and stopped when I felt it was perfect, and it was. I served it with Salmon with Agrodolce Sauce (Gourmet, April 2008) and it was absoutely out of this world. Heavenly.

The presentation was lovely. As some reviewers suggested, I added 3-4 cloves of roasted garlic; white truffle oil... but I still wasn't getting the consistency I wanted to achieve. I ended up adding some butter and mascapone cheese and the texture turned out very velvety.

Very 'pretty' result. I did not think it was too much work. I found myself fortifying the puree, though. Add the liquid to the puree slowly, though. You may wish to stop short of adding the full 1 cup. I wonder about adding something to the puree to add more color - have not yet decided upon what - or what color.

great! economical, seasonal side or entree. something truly speial happens when you fry up that cauliflower...

YAWN. i found this recipe boring. if you are looking for that stylish, monochromatic meal, then maybe this is the one. but as an interesting side dish, this definitely didn't cut it. i even added a bit of heavy cream to the puree hoping it would make it richer. eh. i won't be making this again. not worth the trouble.

We loved this recipe, but I'm only giving it 3 forks, because I did have to make some changes. I found the puree too soupy. Luckily I had more cauliflower on hand, so I cooked more and added it to the puree. Even then, I found it helpful to puree for a long time to "whip" up the mixture. Once I was happy with the consistency, I found the flavor a little bland (and when pairing cauliflower with cauliflower, I felt the puree needed more depth.) I added salt and truffle oil (because I had some) to the puree, and it was fabulous. I made the puree and seared the "steaks" ahead of time, warming both when I was ready to serve. I served the steak topped with the puree, because I was afraid that the suggested serving method would be too messy to eat on my small, "1st course" plates. My guests loved it. A very inventive recipe, but again, only 3 forks as listed in the recipe.

I loved this recipe. I added some herbes de Provence to the milk and floret mixture while cooking. After processing the mixture in a blender, I added 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Very delicious.
