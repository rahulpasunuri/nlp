Bravo. By far the best duck I've ever cooked. As other reviewers note, it's best to brown the duck breasts and then begin the sauce before roasting them to make sure the duck isn't done too soon. The sauce didn't take longer than I expected, but I found the duck needed only 12 minutes of roasting (not 20!)for a perfect medium rare. I served them with potatoes anna, but a simple risotto or pilaf would have been much better.

My favorite way to prepare duck breasts! I do, however, just soak the tea bags in the sauce for a bit rather than removing the tea leaves. The sauce would probably be good with chicken as well if you don't have duck.

Rating: 0
I made this recipe with chicken and it worked just fine. I also kept the tea in the tea bag which allowed me to fish them out and keep the onions which were succulent and sweet.

Excellent. I grilled some apricots to serve with it and also used apricot juice instead of orange. The tea is amazing as a seasoning. I also grilled whole wild ducks instead of duck breasts, and passed the sauce to pour over the duck. Fabulous.

Good recipe, 5 teabags may be one too many

Rating: 4
This recipe has a lot going for it. Pantry-ready ingredients and minimal prep time top the list. The orange flavor is subtle, and as previously noted by other reviewers, it's not overly sweet. Very nice balance between citrus and sweetness. Reviewer was right on about keeping tea bags in their bags. Therefore, I left the shallots in the sauce & simply removed the teabags = a couple less dishes to wash. Definitely will make this recipe again. Thanks to other reviewers for their insight and helpful tips!

Nice flavor and change from heavy, sticky, jammy- type sauces typically served with duck. Loved the tea and honey elements and was NOT too sweet. Deglazed pan with cognac and added extra shallots. Made two skin on Muscovy duck breasts that were over a pound a piece. Even better was the big container of duck fat I also purchased at Central Market for only $12.99. Used it with every xmas recipe....even xmas breakfast. We like things more on the rare side, so I seared the duck a bit longer, let it sit while I made the sauce and then convection roasted for 10 mins. (versus the suggested 12 - 15 mins in reviews) Not quite long enough....12 mins would have been perfect for med rare. (20 would have been too long)

My husband said this matched his first duck experience which was in a tiny bistro in Paris. I will definitely make this again. Excellent.

I've made this recipe a couple of times. I think the sweet orange sauce with the duck breasts is a tremendous coupling. The first time I made the mistake of taking the tea leaves out of the tea bag and was left with tea leaves that couldn't be sieved out! However, it was still lovely. We ate this with mashed potatoe to soak up the sauce and some lovely steamed green vegetables.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could; it's just that I rarely give 4 forks. These duck breasts were excellent. I thought that my boyfriend might not like the sauce, but he ended up licking the plate clean. I didn't find that the sauce took too long to reduce, but maybe my cast iron skillet was working particularly well. I also found that the time on the duck breasts was just about right. I used an internal thermometer until it read 135, and then tool the duck out and let it rest tented. I might take it out when it says 130 next time, but as it was, half or the breast was medium rare and the rest was medium, which worked out okay for us. This sauce is nice because it's sweet, but not overly sweet and fruity like a lot of recipes for duck sauce are. Try this. You probably have all the ingredients for the sauce laying around.

Delightful and so easy. I used smoked breasts, but otherwise did not change a thing. It gets raves every time I serve it.

Rating: 3
Delicious, but a couple of points to note: The size of duck breast used (and whether skin on or not) will make a big difference in cooking time. Many reviewers needed less than the recommended 20 minutes, we (using skin-on breasts of 1/2 lb. each) needed far more. Also, with fatty breasts cooking at high temperature, it is important to tent the roasting pan with foil - otherwise the interior of your oven will be coated by spattering duck fat and your kitchen will quickly fill with smoke!! (Yes, this happened.) We found the sauce taking far too long to cook down, so we ended up thickening it with a small amount of flour - worked beautifully. Many reviewers have tweaked this recipe in one way or another - it requires close attention during cooking and a flair for improvisation - but we agree the results are quite satisfactory.

I made this with strong tea I steeped in a little water and didn't strain it. I also only cooked my breasts for 15 minutes. It was incredible. I poured the sauce on the plate to keep the skin crisp. Fantastic and very easy.

I left out the honey but added an extra tablespoon of butter, and was very pleased with the result: a smooth, flavourful sauce.

Really, really good. It didn't take me very long to reduce the sauce at all - I used a cast-iron skillet, perhaps that's the trick. I seared the breasts and roasted them for about 12 minutes, at which point they were medium rare.

this was an absolutely wonderful dish. The sauce makes it! I used an earl gray tea with lavendar and rosemary and used a cup and a half of chicken broth. Also tossed in some slivered candied ginger. It was wonderful

Rating: 4
I've made this many times and it's one of my favorites. I always save and freeze the pan driipings from the duck so the sauce can be made ahead of time with a few spoonfuls of prior drippings. I have also done the breasts in a saute pan; 10 min. fat side, pour off and cook 4 min. on other side. Serve with wild rice pilaf and you will be very popular.

Noting comments about the time it takes to reduce the sauce, we partially reduced the juice, broth, and tea in advance. We then strained the tea out and added the partially reduced sauce to the shallots for the final reduction.

Thanks to all of the previous viewers with good advice, the dish didn't come out too bad. I wouldn't say that it's an Incredible dish, but it is quite nice to have something different and it is quite simple to make, except it Does take a while to finish everything.

As per everyone else's review; this is a wonderful recipe. You can even make the sauce in advance if you do like I do, and save and freeze duck drippings in a tupperware container. The drippings are also great for other things, like frying potatoes and roast chicken. Make this recipe, it's GREAT!

Very impressive combination of flavours. Tried using lady grey tea instead of earl grey and found it mingled better with the orange. Also the idea of another reviewer of deglazing the skillet with brandy was a treat. Love the dish and will use it again.

My husband loved this duck. It was fabulous & easy to make. It is definitely a keeper. I did sprinkle the duck with some of the Earl Grey tea & reduced roasting time as suggested. Thought the sauce was very good..not sweet like some.

Rating: 3
I was very eager to try a recipe that incorporates earl grey tea, which I love. However, while the Duck itself was delicious, I would NOT make this sauce again. It took an awfully long time (longer than the recipe states) to reduce, and the tea became bitter after simmering too long. Finally, the overall flavor was not as sweet as I usually like with Duck, making this sauce disappointing, and just not worth so much effort. Next time I would make the Duck the same way and use a simple-to-make apricot glaze instead.

Rating: 4
I used a whole duck instead of the two breasts as that is what I had. Sauce is excellent. In this case I sprinkled half of the tea leaves directly on/in the duck with salt and pepper. Roasted 2 hours at 325 breast side down and followed with 20 minutes breast side up (uncovered) at 375 to brown the outside with 1 T honey brushed on.

I had been looking for a new recipe for a sauce for duck breasts; I've been making a port-cherry-shallot sauce from "A New Way to Cook" that we love, but wanted to try something different. I thought this would be interesting, but we found the Earl Grey tea taste overpowering and unpleasant (and I like Earl Grey tea), so much so that we tossed the sauce and I went back to my old standby (fortunately, I had enough time to do it). And aside from using olive oil rather than duck fat to saute the shallots (I use boneless, skinless duck breasts for health reasons, and saute the duck per "A New Way to Cook"), I followed the recipe exactly. Perhaps the duck fat is critical to this recipe ... if unhealthy to consume.

Rating: 4
Many thanks to the other reviewers who warned that the time in the oven needs to be less than 20 minutes. I found that 8 minutes was long enough, but let the duck sit before putting it in the oven while I started sauteing some sliced potatoes in the duck fat. I used green tea that had a bit of orange peel in it. It was terrific with an orange and belgian endive salad and easy enough to make for 4 people for a dinner party.

Rating: 4
I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for my husband and myself (halved the recipe). It was absolutely fabulous, easy, incredibly delicious. The flavors in the sauce melded beautifully such that no one ingredient stands out and the color is a beautiful, dark caramel. Worthy for a dinner party. I followed the tip of the previous reviewer and cut back the cooking time to 15 minutes in the oven and the breasts came out medium (with five minutes resting time). Next time I'd cut back to 12 minutes for medium rare & perhaps sear the breats early to get a head start on the sauce. Truly a fabulous, easy recipe that gives the appearance of being much more.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe, but, 20 oven minutes is too long - came out medium-well to well-done. Will cut down to 15 minutes next time. Threw in sprigs of fresh thyme from my herb garden into the sauce as it reduced. Yum! Caffeine from tea was NOT an issue (and I'm very sensitive to caffeine). Took the chance because decaf tea is awful stuff.

This was the first time I ever tried cooking duck, and it turned out absolutely fantastic! I used some Mallard breasts that a hunter friend just killed this morning. They didn't have any skin, so I used a little olive oil in the pan to sear them, then roasted for about 12 minutes in the oven, which made them pretty rare. The sauce was very easy to make and turned out to be quite delicious...really interesting flavor, I never would have thought to cook with Earl Grey tea leaves.

This sauce was incredible! The combination of those flavors is divine. I had skinless duck breasts and used a little bit of butter and olive oil to sautee them with. Wonderful.

so easy, so quick, followed the recipe exactly. have made it several times and always my guests rave and try to guess what the flavour is!! think the earl grey tea is indispensable for an unique flavour. i think the sauce is stand out, so like to serve with plain veg- steamed new potatoes and a simple salad. one of my favourite recipes from epicurious

I have made many recipes founbd on this site, but this was the best. It was extremely easy, and my husband said it was the best duck he ever had. (HUGE compliment!) Ine change, I omitted the tea, and it was still a wonderful sauce with delicate sweetness. I had leftover sauce that I served with grilled pork chops...also great! The sauce took a little longer, but it all came together simply.

Guests raved but I too found 20 minutes too long for medium rare duck, especially if it is to sit a bit before serving. Great rec on the decaffienated tea!

Holy cow - and not too many recipes get a holy cow rating. I thought my duck was a bit smaller than called for so I seared the duck, made the sauce (up to adding the honey) and then roasted the duck (thought the duck would be quicker than the sauce). The sauce took far longer than expected and the duck still took the same amount of time (likely b/c it sat out while I made the sauce) - next time, a bit larger breasts and cook per directions. And, the sauce will likely come together better (too much back and forth - is this ready, is that ready?). Also, took the advice of others and sprinkled five spice over breasts before searing and roasted on top of orange slices (skin, seeds, everything). Really, really good.

Rating: 4
Another 4 fork review. Funny thing is that I found the 20 minute roasting time to be a little too long for my liking. Duck came out medium-well so I will reduce cooking time by 3 or 4 minutes next time. Served with the wild rice and fennel pilaf recipe that can be found on this site.

Rating: 4
Different sweet sauce... but WONDEFUL! Yes, not as sweet as typical orange sauces go. Also, I had to substitute lemon concentrate (diluted with water) for orange juice - it was still tasty! The sauce reminded me of a lightly sweetened ICE TEA, but hey, I liked it! I cooked my duck about 25-30 minutes and it was still a little pinkish BUT DE-LISH! It is DEFINITELY a keeper of a recipe. And yes, like others, I think some type of pilaf or wild rice is a MUST as a balanced side dish. (My fiance added this sauce to his wild rice dish - it was THAT TASTY!!)

Rating: 3
This is a great duck recipie, especially if you don't want one that is too sweet like some of the fruit sauces can be. The cooking method is also perfect for a nice pink center. My husband liked this better than the port/cherry sauce one on this site. The reason I ori. choose this recipie was because it was one that DIDN'T call for duck glaze or a complex stock reduction.

It almost seems silly to add yet another rave review. This is mainly to thank the person who posted a review for another duck recipe and suggested making this one instead. This was fantastic - the sauce was just delicious and the preparation was not difficult.

I have made this dish twice! Both times it came out just perfect. A real confidence booster for me as I had never cooked duck. (Received breast as a gift) First time didn't have any Earl Gray so just added a few drops of bergamot essential oil with black tea. Used onions instead of shallots. Second time kept the solids as they added texture to the sauce, used tea bags instead of loose tea. Also have made just the sauce to serve over pork tenderloin. Tjdarceyhis is good too!

If you really want to make something wonderful, make this recipe!! Make sure you invest in some really good duck, (I ordered mine from D'artangnan online). So easy, so wonderful. I served it over a bed of wild rice blended with dried cranberries. I make dishes from Epicurious nearly 4 times a week and this one was truely memorable! My only thoughts are that you may want to use decaf Earl Grey in the sauce as the regular strength may keep diners up at night.

Rating: 3
This is delectable... both subtle and complex. The reduction takes considerable time, but as others have said--well worth it! I froze the duck fat to use next time... I'm thinking I'll try to expedite things by making the sauce first, use the thawed (frozen) duck fat to do the browning stage, and then save the fat from that round for another "cycle". I served it with a wild rice and barley pilaf recipe I have and haricot verts. Hard to beat!

Rating: 4
This recipe is absolutely delicious, and it easy enough for a novice cook such as myself. I had never cooked duck before trying this recipe and it turned out perfectly. 20 minutes in the oven may be too much. I took mine out after about 15 and it was great. Except fot the cooking, I did everything else exactly as the recipe said.

Looks like a nice and easy recipe. But ... discard the fat??? Duck fat is almost better than the duck itself! Use a couple tablespoons to saute the shallots, and save the rest to use for everything you can - popovers, cornbread, eggs, etc. Your tastebuds will thank you.

I have made this recipe many, many times and it is always wonderful. I use duck legs, cook them in the liquid for 45 minutes, to make them really tender. (I add water and/or OJ as needed.) If you don't have Earl Grey, any tea with bergamot will work as it is the bergamot flavor that really makes it, especially with the honey and orange. A personal favorite

My first time making duck. I might have overcooked the duck a bit, but such a wonderful sauce - it was very forgiving. I was out of Earl Grey, so I substituted Green Tea. Will try again with Earl Grey just to compare but the sauce was incredible! Very light but full of flavor. I love duck but have never tried to prepare it at home before. This recipe was wonderful for my first try - easy and delicious!

I had always loved duck but this time flavours were abounding and intense yet balanced and not over powering. If i may i'd like to suggest a couple of suggestions: -oven coooking time...10 min to medium rare was enough/ - a light squeeze of lime at the end just ties it all up. served on a bed of steamed rice.... A star duck dish!!

Absolutely luscious. I made it for Valentine's Day this year. (Yes, it's taken me *this* long to post the review.) My husband fell in love with me all over again! A recipe that's definitely worth repeating. (And it's not hard to make, either!)

I love duck and this recipe is delicious. (The only way I've cooked duck myself). I've made it several times and followed the recipe,(although the last time I substituted Queen Anne tea and it was fine). Also, my duck breasts must have been much smaller, because they were medium-rare in 8-10 minutes. The sauce is really tasty, but I will try the five-spice powder as recomended. I think rice is a g0ood side dish with the duck and the sauce.

Nice. I used a Long Island muscovy breast, and it cooked well. I overcooked the sauce -- it was glutenous when I rescued it -- but still tasty. I did not use any honey and don't think it nec'y. A good change from the everyday.

The sauce explodes with flavor(not your ordinary sweet-orange flavor). The duck tastes plain by itself but the sauce really brings it to a higher level. It's also unbelievably easy to make (my first time to cook duck). The sauce took 15 minutes to reduce over high heat until it had that nice thick consistency. Instead of piercing the skin with fork, I slit the skin as though I'm making big gridlines, looked prettier that way too. I also sprinkled 5-spice powder as suggested by a reviewer. I think the sauce will match beautifully with chicken too. 2 thumbs up!

This is a good dish to check if your smoke detector is working. I added diced ginger to the sauce and used Constant Comment tea which I had on hand.

Outrageous sauce. Used 2 TBS butter and was perfect. Really thickened up once honey & butter was added and simmered. Turned pan off to slice the duck and when I returned to the sauce it was perfect consistency for drizzling over duck. 18-20 minutes on duck was right on, too. Do NOT go over.

This is my husband's favorite. We are able to eat Barbary duck quite a bit, since it's relatively inexpensive in Germany, so I've been able to experiment a lot. This sauce is not as heavy as a port of wine sauce, but not too citrusy either. A great almost smoky taste.

Take the lead from the people before like I did: yes on the sauce reduction, the orange (mentioned by Seattle) actually lengthens the cooking time, the five spice powder is a GREAT idea. Only used 2 tbsp butter and that was fine. Served with the Szechan Shitake Risotto (see my comments there). Nice asian influence dish.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe five or six times now and passed the recipe along to several satisfied friends. When giving it to them I cannot stress enough how important it is to reduce the sauce as directed. The tea, honey and orange are a lovely combination of contrasting yet complementary flavors. Another trick I've learned with this recipe is that roasting the duck with slices of orange underneath and on top absorbs some of the grease as well as giving the meat a hint of its own citrusy taste. Other than that, I think this recipe is just great as it is. I usually serve it with a simple risotto milanese, spooning a little of the sauce over top, and some roasted asparagus.

Rating: 3
This dish is easy to prepare, with only a few ingredients. Fresh orange juice adds a little zip. I definitely recommend sprinkling about 1/8 teaspoon five spice powder on the breasts before searing, and then adding another dash of it to the finished sauce. The five spice powder matches very nicely with the tea. Watch the timing of the roasting. The duck breasts may cook a little bit faster than listed here, so check them after about 15 minutes.

Rating: 4
The recipe worked well, with a few changes made based on other reviewers' comments. First, I decreased the amount of chicken broth,then substituted orange juice concentrate for the orange juice and omitted the butter althogher. I also used a whole roasted duck, which, when done, was placed in the pan with the gravy, basted, and left to simmer on a very low flame for a few minutes. Excellent!

My husband and I made this for our Christmas dinner. I was a bit dubious because I HATE Earl Grey tea, but followed the recipe anyway. The tea loses it's pungent taste in the cooking and the sauce is left with a pleasant tart taste. I cut down on the amount of butter and it is important to reduce the sauce as directed.

I enjoyed this dish, however I do not like Earl Grey tea so I substituted a black tea (Irish Breakfast). The balance between the sweet and bitter is what I particularly liked, although when I make it next time I will experiment with a little dry mustard in the sauce for even more character.
