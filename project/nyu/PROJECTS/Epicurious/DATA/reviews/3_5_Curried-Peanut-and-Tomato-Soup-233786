I used Campbells Tomato Soup because it's been sitting in my cabinet for a while and I needed to use it. Still turned out great! I put it through the blender before serving to get a completely smooth texture. I also think that next time i want to use chunky peanut butter as well.

Easy and delicious. Followed many of the suggestions. Excluded hot water and used immersion blender. Saved the cilantro for garnish along with a squeeze of lime, swirl of Sriracha, and dash of finely chopped peanuts. Nice presentation as the hot sauce was a couple of shades darker than the soup.

this is strangely delicious. I just made my first batch, used red onions, and added garlic. No hot water necessary. As is, fantastic and easy!

This is one tasty soup. I think I made it once or twice a week for a month while I was in college because it is cheap and yummy. It really (for me anyway) only makes two good sized main-course servings, so the recipe is pretty accurate in measuring it as 4 first-course servings. I didn't change a thing except sometimes I used crunchy natural peanut butter instead of smooth. I actually like the crunchy better in this recipe; it gives the soup a good texture.

Did some modifications as suggested by previous reviewers: added a bit of sambal oelek, used about half cup of hot water to mix the PB, and pureed the soup with an immersion blender. Then I added 1 sweet potato, cubed and let it cook for 20min. Before serving I splashed in some fresh lime juice and a lot of cilantro. I think the lime really made a difference.

Very good soup. Made as written, then blended and added a teaspoon of brown sugar. Decided not to use cilantro. Will definitely make it again.

it's super-easy, versatile and, while good as is, invites experimentation. it's essential to have tomato paste on hand to balance out the peanut butter. i added a pinch of finely minced jalapeno peppers while sauteing onions and later, added chopped sweet potatoes, mushrooms, zucchini and spinach (all of which i had on hand, frozen) and then served it with lime, fresh cilantro leaves, dollop of low-fat yogurt and toasted coconut.

This soup is brilliant in so many ways. Taste, nutrition ,low in fats and simple to make.I used fresh tomatoes (abundant right now in garden) peeled,seeded & pureed. Natural Peanut butter w/ no sugars or salts & I only used a little hot water to thin out the peanut butter. I added about a teaspoon of sriracha hot sauce(this is the ticket.) When served I squeezed fresh lime on top and cilantro. Also threw a few toasted pine nuts on top. I will make again for company & maybe add shrimp at the end. It took my husband a few bites to get used to the taste, but the more he ate the more he liked.

I love this soup! It's great as is, and it also makes an excellent base for more elaborate variations. I do not add the water (the peanut butter will easily stir in without it). I also use my immersion blender to blend it pretty smooth, and because I like extra peanutty goodness, I add in a little more chunky peanut butter after blending. Last time, I made this extra thick and added potatoes and carrots. Delicious over steamed rice! This has become a great staple in my house!

Wonderful recipe to my taste. I must admit to adding a few chopped serranos for a little extra Indian zing, and I used fresh tomatoes from my garden. Also I blended the soup. Excellent hot, and I look forward to trying it chilled.

I ended up adding a lot to this recipe; I would have given my version 4 stars.

Easy pantry soup! I used Bolst's hot curry so cut it to just over 1 tsp. Halfway through I realized I had no broth! Subbed 1 can Campbell's tomato soup, added NO salt (Campbell's has enough sodium to kill a bear), and added 1/2 cup cream at the end. Smooth, thick, spicy, creamy and delicious!

This soup is a regular in my soup repetoire. I just love the unique flavor and mainly because I can whip it up with staples in my pantry. I do use chunky peanut butter because I like the cruncy texture it gives. I also LOVE to steam some brown basmati rice for the nutty flavor and serve the soup over top with some extra cilantro. Makes a bit of a "stew" rather than true soup this way - give a try!

I appreciate all the helpful comments in previous reviews. They save time and improve the recipe. I loved the soup, and following past suggestions, I pureed in a blender; then added one cooked, cubed sweet potato. I did not use the hot water. Could not have been happier with the exotic flavors and creamy texture.

This is a very versatile soup and can be used as a base to suit many different flavors. We did puree it once, but now prefer not to but it lost the wonderful texture it had. Also, LIME JUICE adds a nice dynamic to the flavors, and Nappa Cabbage enhances the texture. Definitely read other reviews - they're packed with great ideas!

A really nice soup. Not the best I've ever had, but full-bodied and satisfying (I pureed half the soup as well). I bet it'll be even better tomorrow. Added fresh ginger while frying the onions, which was lovely.

Rating: 4
Such a great soup. I have an unholy addiction to peanut butter, and this is the perfect way to satiate my peanuty soup desires. I follow the recipe exactly, except instead of using smooth peanut butter, I use natural chunky pb. Like others, I puree half of it (I highly recommend this, especially to those who found this soup thin and flat). Also, the cilantro at the end is indispensable. And, as said before, it doesn't make that much, so if you're serving more than 2, double it, then bask in its peanuty glory.

This soup was wonderful--I can't say I expected a peanut-tomato soup to taste so good. I pureed it and replaced the black pepper with cayenne. For those wondering whether to use natural or... "unnatural" peanut butter, I made this soup twice in one day, once with Peter Pan and once with natural. I added about half a teaspoon of sugar to the natural batch but didn't have to add any with PP--but I think the natural peanut butter tasted a little better (but only a little, couldn't complain about either way). I s'pose that might differ on whether or not you're going to puree it or just eat it straight, consistency-wise.

I have made this serval times and love it. For a fuller meal I have added shreaded cabage and chicken. Delicious.

This soup is a fast meal to throw together when you're returning home from work and it's versatile enough to use as a curry base for quick stews. I've made this dish close to a dozen times now. I really enjoy the chunky texture but tried blending it as recommended by others. In it's blended form, I've used the left overs by adding chickpeas and serving it over rice. I will probably experiment with chicken, veggies and couscous in the near future.

I've made this twice, once with cumin & chili powder (no curry on hand) and the second time with curry. Delicious BOTH ways....nice and creamy after blending with an immersion blender. So much better than soup from a can and very quick to make. Try it!!

This was so yummy, and made a great weekend lunch with a grilled cheese sandwich. My husband was initially extremely reluctant to eat it, as he hates onion, tomatoes and curry, but I told him to just try a bite, and he ended up liking it. I strongly recommend pureeing the soup (my immersion blender did the trick) and I ended up whisking another 1/2 c or so of peanut butter in after pureeing it, to really get a pronounced peanut taste and a thicker, richer texture. This may be because I used reduced fat peanut butter, but I suggest taking a taste before serving to see if you agree. It will whisk right into the hot soup, you don't need to do that step with the hot water. For me this is a Thai/Indian take on a classic Virginia peanut soup.

Rating: 3
Delicious, and even better the day after. I added a carrot thinly sliced, used cayenne pepper instead of black, pureed the whole thing and served over some rehydrated couscous, which kept getting fluffier in the soup and made it deliciously thick (say about 50g per person). I also put a dollop of whole milk yogurt in every dish as I had put too much cayenne :-P Definitely a keeper, and interesting enough for a dinner with friends.

I made the recipe as written and pureed the soup because I wanted a smooth, creamy soup. The end result was perfect. I did use regular Jif or similar peanut butter since the natural wouldn't give me the creamy results I was looking for. However, to give the soup a bright and spring-like flavor, I added 1 tablespoon of fresh lime juice. This really improved what was already a good soup. The lime complimented the curry and peanut butter flavors and gave the soup a bit of a Thai taste.

This soup was delicious! Puree the soup if you prefer it thicker. Also, I doubled the recipe for 4 adults and had very little leftover.

I would recommend following the recipe exactly. It comes out great. I used tomato puree as the only substitution. Also, I think it's a mistake (as I did) to use "chic" peanut butter. (i.e., natural food store-type.) I think that Skippy or Jif would be much less noticeably grainy. This is the type of recipe that makes an impressive dish with very little effort.

Rating: 3
Super fast and easy! I can't imagine why anyone would cut the curry in half...I had to double it! Perhaps my spice was older and weaker...I added some diced roasted red peppers and pureed half the soup with the pb and then returned it to the pot. Then I added diced baby red potatoes as well to make it heartier. 15 minutes to a nice light supper!

Rating: 4
For me, the flavors of tomato and peanut butter were still distnct, maybe I needed to simmer some more, but my husband couldn't tell what flavors he was tasting and thought the soup was delicious. It is delicious, Iagree. I cut the curry by 1/2 for our tastes and I will definitely make it again. After using the blender, it had a thick cream consistancy. Very nice.

I made this soup for a dinner party this weekend and read the reviews first. I doubled the recipe, added roasted red peppers as a previous reviewer suggested, and added much more smooth peanut butter, tasting as I went. I pureed it and forgot to add the cilantro at the end. Everyone loved the soup sans cilantro. It's going to be one of my company standbys now. So easy to prepare!

Very easy and very good. I used a stick blender to puree it slightly to thicken it. Be sure to use a good curry powder. My mom made this soup and added some shredded rotisserie chicken for a heartier meal and loved it.

This is quick, easy, and good but not great. I made according to the recipe, then tasted - thin and a little bland. I added a clove of roasted garlic and at least doubled the curry to punch it up, and let it simmer to thicken. Next time, I'll add some pureed roasted red peppers and maybe some ginger.

Flavorful, easy, delightful and guest worthy. I have made it about 4 times and my guests always ask for the recipe. It is perfect as is, but I also like it with crunchy peanut butter. I made a main meal by adding grilled chicken and brown rice. Add a salad and some bread and you have a wonderful meal.

Fantastic and so easy. I've made it four times, once for about 15 people and I've had nothing but rave reviews and requests for the receipe. I did add rice and once cream, I also increased the amount of peanut butter but it's wonderful just the way it is.

This is wonderful, and interesting enough to stand alone as a dinner entree. I doubled everything (plus at least tripled the curry powder and added some paprika) and got a little more than two large dinner soup bowls. I also pureed it to a very creamy consistency in the food processor. Served it with Dosai (a sort of Indian crepe made with lentil flour--there's a mix available!) and mango chutney, and garnished with a spoonful of plain yogurt as well as the cilantro. Easy, satisfying, healthy, cheap--what more could you ask?

This is dee-lish! Flavor with depth and body. I used natural peanut butter and veggie bouillon (I'm vegetarian), good quality canned italian plum tomatoes, tad more cilantro. Immersion blender all the way. One of my favorite soups so far from Epicurious.

It took me about 15 minutes from start to finish to pull together this dish. I used dried onions because I was out of fresh, canned tomatoes w/onions, a pinch of dried corriander instead of cilantro and a cube of frozen basil to finish it off. Really really good! 2 tsp of Madras Curry gave it enough kick for me and I usually like spicy foods. It may just be the type of curry you have on hand that makes a difference.

This soup is sooo easy to prepare on a busy weeknight. At first, I was reluctant to the idea of peanut butter and coriander but in the end the tastes blend well together. The only modifications I've done were: 2 tbs of peanut butter instead of 1/4 cup and more fresh coriander, there is never too much for my own taste. This is a really tasty soup and I highly recommend it.

I liked this, but found it a bit flat tasting and missing "something"...I used the cheap canned tomatoes, so maybe that's the reason. Also, I recommend putting it through the blender. It creates a silky, gorgeous orange soup that contrasts well with the cilantro.

This is a very good soup if you eliminate about 1/2 cup of the water and puree it at the end. I used more like 3 Tbl. of curry powder (I didn't have Madras) plus a pinch of hot red pepper flakes.

While I loved the concept of this recipe, I found the result only so-so. I added chicken cubes to make it a little more hearty, but still wasn't overwhelmed by the flavor of the soup. I think that, next time, I'll try adding some jalapeno for a little extra zing ...

I was prompted to make this because of the unique combination of ingredients, and was thrilled to discover just how very delicious it was. I used a can of stewed tomatoes, and a bit less water. A good way to sneak a little more lycopene into your husband's diet to keep his prostate gland healthy!
