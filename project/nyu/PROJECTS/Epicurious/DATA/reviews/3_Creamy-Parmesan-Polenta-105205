to enhance the 'creamy'ness and overall flavor of the titled dish, substitute a 1:1 ratio of heavy cream and appropriate stock for the liquid. more decadent, luxurious, and full of flavor.

It was pretty easy to make, and really enjoyable!

Made to go with the Pork Chops recommended (they were better), and I might make this again with a little "tweaking"... KIMBER

I had never made polenta before and wasn't really a fan of it until now. It was amazingly easy to make. Just be sure that you add the mixture a bit at a time and stir constantly. Our dinner guests loved it, my husband was crazy about it and I am going to make it for another dinner party this week. Simple to make and yummy. That's my kind of recipe.
