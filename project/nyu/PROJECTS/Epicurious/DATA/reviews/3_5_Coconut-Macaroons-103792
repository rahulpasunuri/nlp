so easy, so good! I used 10 oz UNsweetened coconut and 5 oz sweetened coconut. added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract - which makes them! Beat eggs for approx 2-3 min on high so they are stiff. bake at 300-325 for 25 min or until golden all over

These are DELICIOUS! I made them for dessert when hosting my parents for dinner the first time they visited my new place. They were so easy to make, I was able to stand at the kitchen island whipping them together while still taking part in the conversation. NOT HEALTHY. BUT AWESOME.

my biggest issue with these are they took longer than the time listed because they were big, using the tablespoon, then the other tablespoon layer on top. They were tall and fluffy and taste good, but need more than the time in the recipoe..i'd probably do smaller than 2 tblsp the next time, but great recipie!

Yummy and gooey! We love these!

These are delicous but more of a confection. The condensed milk did pool a bit durring baking but they cooked fine. They are sticky and don't grow much durring the baking process. I peeled them off of the parchment paper immediately out of the oven with no problem. I placed them on a non-stick cooling rack to cool. I think I'll try more recipes. I'ld prefer a larger and fluffier macaroon. I'm giving them 3 forks because my family enjoyed them.

I just finished making these for a fourth of July party and am pleased with the results. I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe. Had no problems with sticking and flat cookies. Can't wait to make this again!!

I suggest using half shredded coconut and half powdered coconut, since the shredded coconut I was using was simply too big to form a cohesive dough. Also, they do not need to be sweetened, since the condensed milk is already sweet enough, in my opinion. In response to the suggestions to add another flavor, I added a splash of Amaretto. It was subtle enough that no one commented on it, but it definitely added a complexity and richness to an otherwise overly simple flavor.

Thanks, Chefspeedy of Hamilton -- those are great tips, and I advise any bakers to look back to that review. Lacking parchment, I still had stickiness issues -- but dip half in melted dark chocolate, and who will care?

Fantastic. Follow the recipe and they will come out prefect. The person that had them come out flat must have either not whipped the egg whites or not double layered. The taste is the BEST!

Very Good. I agree that an additional extract such as rum along with the vanilla improves the taste.

More like candy than cookies, these very sweet macaroons are my kids' favorite. For best results, remove macaroons right away when still hot from the oven and be prepared for a bit of a sticky mess to clean up. But it's worth it.

I have made these twice, and the first time I had a similar result as previous reviewers in a flat macaroon with the sc milk pooling at the bottom. I think the key is to be sure your sc milk is thicker (Eagle Brand is) and add as more coconut until it is a thick paste texture before folding in the eggs. The eggs also need to be quite stiff. With these tips, they turn out amazing. Good Luck!

I recently had the BEST macaroons at a local restaurant (Papa Haydn's). They were crunchy on the outside and moist and chewy inside and ever since, I have been looking for a recipe that comes close to replicating them. I made these last night (and admittedly, it was raining, which may have affected the macaroons), but I thought they were terrible. Too sickly sweet, and the egg and SC Milk mixture did pool out the bottom of the cookies. I baked on a silpat and turned the oven off and let them cool completely in the oven before removing the cookies, which gave them a nice golden look and crunchy top. It also meant that I could peel the cookies right off the mat, but I still thought they weren't very good. I might try making these again with half the sweetened condensed milk, but with so many recipes out there, I doubt it.

A few hints to make these work: First, use a rimless cookie sheet, not a sheet pan. You need the air to circulate all around and the edges on the sheet pan prevent this. Second, never ever ever use waxed paper for baking. The wax melts onto the food and everything sticks. Use parchment, and spray it with Pam or other pan release spray that has no flour. Third, watch them closely unless you use an oven thermometer or know that your oven temperature has been calibrated within the last month. The high sugar content will burn quickly if you're not careful. I use these for large holiday parties, and with these tips, they are always a complete success.

Very one said they were very good, however they wound up being coconut piles in a puddle of s.c. milk and egg during the baking. I'm going to go with my mom's recipe from now on.

I have used this recipe on many occasions and have had RAVE reviews everytime. I drizzle melted chocolate over the top sometimes. If you spray the cookie sheet with cooking spray(PAM) they do not stick. I suggest using a small or large ice cream scoop to make them nice and high and moist, adjust cooking time if you use the small ice cream scoop.

This is *not* a good recipe. The macaroons collapsed and spread like glue on the cookie sheet, the bottoms burned, and they ended up being unsalvageable. There are far superior recipes out there. I'm not used to tossing food and this was very frustrating!

Rating: 2
These tasted pretty good- really sweet. But I have a question... I halved the recipe and the macaroons turned out to be as flat as pancakes! Is that the way they are supposed to be? Did I do something wrong? Most macaroons I've had are usually tall, not flat. Any ideas? Thanks!

I followed the advice of raising the oven rack to the top and baking the cookies at 300 for 20 minutes. I used a small ice cream scoop I normally use for cookie dough to portion the macarooons. They turned out great! Huge crowd pleaser!!

I was happy I had the reviews to read from before I cooked this dish. I prevented the "burned bottoms" by raising the grill in the oven to the highest level, lowering the temperature to 300, cooking only 20 minutes. I serve the cookies hot. They are gooey in the center, browned on top, and scrumdillylicious!!!

Wonderfully easy. I'm more of a cook than a baker so this was great. I also dipped the cooled cookies in melted chocolate about 1/3, then put them in refrigerator to harden. Brought them as Xmas Eve gift to a neighbors house and another batch to my son's on Xmas Day.... everyone raved!

What a great recipe. Yes, they stuck to my paper around the edges but the most of the core came off ok. Silipat seems the way to go. What impresses me most about this recipe is its ease. I made them at midnight after watching Barefoot Contessa (cuz i didnt believe how easy it was) and all be darned if she wasn't correct about the simplicity of it. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone with a love of coconut macaroons. And it also teaches you to stock cocobut and condensed milk in your pantry at all times.

Macaroons taste great, but the recipe needs to be modified a bit. First, you MUST GREASE the parchment or waxed paper (otherwise they will be permanently affixed). Second, I found that removing the cookies while they were still hot worked well. And lastly, drop the macaroons using a 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 inch ice cream scooper. This makes for a perfect sized macaroon that bakes up nicely. Drizzle chocolate on top for a nice touch.

I agree that this is not the greatest nacaroon recipe; i wasnt sure if i was doing something wrong since i followed the recipe precisely but the macaroons burnt around the edges and the bottom and were raw in the middle and stuc to the parchment; they werent even salvagable

This recipe is quick and simple and has become one of my favorite. I took them to a party and everyone there now remembers me as "the girl who made the great macaroons!"

This recipe is fabulous. They are supposed to be big, toasted on top and gooey in the middle. That's what makes them taste so good and fresh. This recipe is the same one in the Barefoot Contessa cookbook.

there seems to be something wrong with the directions, regarding the amount of batter to put on the cookie sheets. I have 13 humungous macaroons, all a bit burned on the top, all quite gooey in the middle, and every last one of them is firmly stuck to my parchment paper. the macaroons are alright, but i think I'll be looking for a different recipe in the future. these are a bit too sweet, and definitely too messy to make again. One last thought: try using "edible rice paper" instead of parchment paper or silipat.

This recipe is slightly messy, but very tasty if you like coconut. Silipat is a definite must!! I also add different extracts and or chocolate and everyone raves. This would be a great cookie for holiday gatherings.

These were the worst macaroons I have ever had! They tasted like gooey condensed milk and over sweetened coconut. Yuck! And they do stick to the wax paper to the point where you can not get them off and have them look presentable. I have a huge sweet tooth but these went in the garbage. As a note: Cooks Illustrated has a phenomenal recipe!

I love coconut macaroons! I mistakenly bought a package of 10 oz coconuts instead of the 14 oz the recipe called for so I decreased the other ingredients; not such a good idea because the condensed milk started melting and separating from the coconut. But STILL the macaroons came out pretty good! Definitely dip in chocolate! Question: what does it mean to blend the egg whites and salt to medium peak? what?

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as the recipe said. It needs grated, not shredded coconut--and it needs almond flavoring. Very bland and boring. Having made it once, I think it could be "fixed" with a better quality of coconut and the almond.

I made these last night for a friend. Her mom loves coconut and I said I was going to try this recipe. They stuck to the pan like mad! I'm buying a Silpat non-stick baking sheet liner tonight and making them again. Otherwise, she said they were even more delicious than ones she gets at an upscale food shop at -- get this -- $3 apiece! I dipped the bottoms of mine in melted chocolate to disquise the rips from scraping them off the pan. Moist, delicous. Will definitely make again. 5/11/02 update: Siplat worked like a dream.

I MAKE THIS RECIPE OFTEN AND EVERY TIME I BRING THESE COOKIES TO A FUNCTION, I ALWAYS GET BUGGED FOR THE RECIPE. I ALSO DIP HALF OF THE MACAROONS IN MELTED CHOCOLATE AND HAVE USED DIFFERENT EXTRACTS, SUCH AS RUM AND ALMOND, ALONG WITH THE VANILLA. YOU COULD ALSO MOUND A FEW CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THE CENTER BEFORE ADDING THE SECOND LAYER OF COCONUT. A DEFINITE STAPLE RECIPE!!!

Easy and delicious! The bottoms do remain sticky, however. Solution - Dip bottoms of cookies in melted chocolate and freeze to harden quickly. I was able to store and stack them without them falling apart. Great presentation.

These were SO simple, and great tasting. After they cooled, I dipped them halfway into some melted bittersweet chocolate. Delicious!

These macaroons are ok but way too sweet. They hurt my teeth. I even used about 1/3 unsweetened coconut. Will make again but will use all unsweetened coconut (or at least a 3 to 1 mixture) to taste. I think the sweetened condensed milk adds more than enough sugar.

Great and easy recipe. Rave reviews from my friends and family. Make sure to use parchment paper - or you'll be scraping the pans forever!

Excellent! I wanted to share a recipe for sweetened condensed milk with you: 4 cups instant powdered milk, 1 cup hot water, 2 cups sugar, 4 tblsp melted butter. Mix in blender and store in refrigerator. Makes 3 cups - you'll need almost 2 cups for this macaroon recipe. Enjoy!

This was a very easy recipe! They were a little too moist however, making them slightly sticky! I would try an find a way to eliminate that. Everyone raved about the flavor!

Very good. My husband, who loves macaroons, pronounced them "really great".
