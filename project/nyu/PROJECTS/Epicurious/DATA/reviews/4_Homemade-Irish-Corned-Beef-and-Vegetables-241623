Because I'm one of those "crazy" types who first tries a recipe exactly as written, I can post a truly honest review of this recipe. And, after making it 5 years in a row, I can also post honestly about what has worked for me. First: the only part of this recipe I leave out is the instacure. Simply no need. Other than that, there is NO need to vary from ANY other part of the recipe--brining time, perfect. Do it the full 8 days, use the 1 1/2 cups of salt (it's required for the curing), and rinse the heck out of the brisket under VERY cold water. I essentially put a shallow pot in the sink and run the water for about 10 solid minutes. Yes, I'm wasting water, but I only make this the week before St. Patrick's Day each year, so I'll adjust my other spending for the month. Do use Harp Lager for the brine. Do use Guinness for the slow cooking. 8 lb. brisket for 10 hours on low in the crockpot is the best way to cook this, I know, I've done it all ways. The meat is still fork tender, but sliceable so it's not like shredded roast beef. Do make the Guinness Mustard. It's a MUST. If you can't fit the cabbage, carrots and onions in the crockpot, take some stock out of the pot, add it to a nice deep stockpot and put the veg on an hour before supper and they're perfectly done. Soda bread, scallion Champ (potatoes) and Irish Car Bomb cupcakes for dessert and you can make an Irish family truly happy. Each March, my husband's huge clans talks about this meal for WEEKS. My only problem is that so many folks are invited now, there aren't any leftovers...

Made this year for St Paddy's and everyone raved. I only brined for 5 days total, and then put in a crockpot overnight, 1 hour on high, 7 on low. Kept it on warm the next day until we served for early supper. Incredibly tender. One tip is that for boiling the veggies in the stock that the meat cooked in, next time I would make sure to either use a gravy separator or put the stock in the fridge to solidify the fat, then remove. I did not pierce the meat either, nor use the insta-cure. Will definately make again.

Have made this 2 years in a row without the insta cure. This year, I used pickling spices that I combined and sealed last year. But the best change that I made was with a sauce. Instead of using a condiment as a side, I thickened about 2 cups of the leftover broth with Wondra (I was lazy), and flavored the sauce with Goulden's mustard -- maybe just a couple of tablespoons. So so good!

PERFECTION~! I used 1/2 marinade for a 3 lb chuck roast (what I had). Wish I had made more meat. I put it in on Monday, stirred on Thurs. night, cooking on Sat. Did make all of veggies in full broth. Horseradish cream was good, maybe not my fave. Guinness mustard was a nice touch, mostly tasted of mustard with the meal, but yummy~

I used a 3# pre-seasoned/brined corned beef I bought from Trader Joes. I increased the boiling time to about 4 hours to get the collagen in the beef to break down--2.25 was very short, with very tough results. Adding the veggies separate was a nice step, allowing them to stay somewhat al dente instead of disintegrating into mush. The flavor profile was way on the side of bitter/anise-y with the allspice, parsnips, and turnips. If cooking for a crowd, I would dial back all 3 of those.

I'm rating this a keeper after using a variety of brines over the past 4 or 5 years. While I was somewhat skeptical, as I usually boil and cool my brines before using, I followed the recipe corning a 8 1/2 lb grass fed Angus brisket. It was great! My Irish son-in-law blessed it and ate his share and more. Not too salty at all, but I didn't pierce the meat as directed, and brined it from Sunday to the following Saturday, cooking it that night and reheating when I cooked the vegetables in the broth before the family arrived. A keeper.

I fell in love with natural corned beef on a schooner cruise off the coast of Maine. I left out the Insta Cure and made my own pickling spice blend (allspice berries, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, coriander seed, mustard seeds and peppercorns). My corned beef turned out delicious. I used the crock pot to cook it. There wasn't enough room for the potatoes and cabbage to cook together, so I cooked those separately--the potatoes in the crock pot after removing the corned beef and the cabbage on the stove with some of the onions and liquid from the corned beef.

I have to confess, I didn't bother with brining my own brisket. I just bought a corned beef brisket from the store, and was looking for a tastier way to cook it. This did it - very tasty, and we loved the mustard with it. I don't know that I'd bother with all the veggies next time, but I'll definitely cook the corned beef this way again.

I served this dish at a St. Patrick's Day party and it was a huge it. I bought two five-pound briskets in order to feed 11 people. I cooked one of the briskets in a slow cooker for about 12 hours and the other I cooked according to the recipe. Obviously the slow cooked brisket turned out much better. Also, I only brined for four days and I cut about a cup of salt out--the meat was not overly salty, and no one seems to have died from botulism yet. It might go without saying, but this is a lot of food to cook at one time, it's definitely worth mapping out ahead of time how you're going to accommodate the bulk of stuff in your kitchen, especially if you'll be entertaining and cooking at the same time.

This was a hit! Used three 3 to 4 lb briskets from Costco to serve 11 adults. We could have squeezed by with two but there would not have been any leftovers. Brined in ziplock bags for 6 days. It was salty but what can you expect from brined meats? It didn't deter our guests from going back for seconds. Next time I might try 5 days. Cooked two in a crock pot for 8 hours on low with a full recipe of cooking liquid/spices. Delicious. Cooked the third on stove top for recommended time with half recipe of cooking liquid/spices. Also delicious. The horseradish sauce was amazing and a perfect compliment to the meat. The vegetables were incredible and I didn't find them to be overly greasy.

Rather then reduce the salt for the cure, which could make it spoil, Julia Child suggests a preliminary soak and boil, discarding water, before final cooking. See The Way to Cook.

This was exceptional! We used this recipe to make corned beef for home-made reuben sandwiches. Although different from the processed deli corned beef found at the grocery, the flavor was spot on. For the reubens, I baked two loaves of marbled rye bread and we fermented our own saurkraut. (Why not? we already had to wait 8 days for the brisket.) We made these panini style with comte cheese and russian dressing. Definitely worth it! Fun project.

I'm not a corned beef fan and dove into this recipe for my family who were excited about it, and curious for the from scratch treatment. A very interesting process, but the family will opt for the store bought version. My real big complaint is my house smelled like dog poop as it was cooking and stayed that way til the smell disappeared finally through the night.

This corned beef is much better than store bought. It is much more flavorful and more economical too. I like being able to control what goes into it. I did not have a problem with dryness. Both sauces were good accompaniments to the meat. Having read the reviews, I shortened the brine time to cut down on saltiness. Five days was more than enough to completely cure the brisket without making it too salty. Be very careful about reducing the amount of salt used. The salt is necessary to inhibit the growth of unpleasant (and sometimes dangerous) bacteria. Keeping the brine cold is also important but the less salt used the more likely there will be spoilage.

Great recipe and fairly easy. I do agree with an earlier review that it was bit salty, other than that - everyone loved it and agreed that the flavor was better than what you'd normally find in a store bought corned beef. Next year, I'll make it again, except reduce the salt in the brine by a bit. As for cooking it, I placed the brisket in a slow cooker in the morning before work and set the timer for 10 hours. It couldn't have been more tender.

Absolutely loved it! I only brined the meat for 5 days, decreased the salt some, and skipped the Insta Cure. Central Market has a wonderful "pickling spice" in their bulk section with allspice, coriander, pepper, bay leaves and a few other things... that was the only spice I used in the brine and boil. I served it with skin-on mashed golden potatoes with caramelized red onions & sour cream! And the Horseradish sauce is a must, but I didn't have any need for the mustard sauce.

My husband said that this was his favorite meal of all time (and not just because he's Irish). The corned beef was superior to all of those pre-marinated packaged meat.

Absolutely wonderful. This will surely be a family recipe. We are already looking forward to when it gets cool enough to make again.

This dish killed! I made it for 20 or so friends at my anual Popper's meal. It recieve outstanding reveiws from all.I couldn't find insta cure locally so I used a Mortans curing product that left me with beautiful pink meat.

I made the recipe exactly as it is described and it did come out delicious. I included the Instacure and it looked exactly like the picture on the cover of the magazine. I did not prepare the vegetables and cooked the meat in the beer mixture for about 3 hours. BUT, I felt it was too salty. I know, corned beef is salty, but I think if I make it again, I would cut the kosher salt in the brine by at least a half a cup since the Instacure is essentially 'Red Lake 40' dye and salt. It is imperative that you make the accompanying guinness mustard and horseradish mayo. Great dish for a crowd - everyone can assemble the sandwich the way they want. I pre-grilled the bread and let the cheese stay out so it was soft. (I also put out sauerkraut, swiss cheese and homeade russian dressing for NY-style Reubens).

My wife and I followed this recipe with two exceptions; we made our own pickling spice instead of purchased (there are hundreds of varieties of pickling spices), and we cooked it in a slow cooker for 6 hours on high. Next time we might try a longer time on low heat, but I don't think it could be more tender or flavorful. Sláinte!

Wonderful flavor! I did not use insta cure and it was perfect. This will be a staple every St. Paddy's day!

Wonderful!!! Well worth the effort. I used the insta cure, brined the brisket for ten days, instead of submerging the brisket in a large roasting pan I opted to place it in a air sealed plastic bag and turned it over ever day. I opted to cook it in a slow cooker, starting on high and heating to a slow boil and then cooking for two hours and then on slow for an additional four hours. It was tender, moist and very flavorful. The family thought it was the best corned beef they had ever had. It was saltier than I prefer, which might have been a result of my air seal bagging to brine it, so next time I'll reduce the salt in the brine by 1/2 a cup. But this is a keeper.

I made this twice. Both times it was great. While I didn't use the turnips or the rutabaga, the potatoes were very good with the flavor of the Guinness. If you can open a beer and put water in a pot, you can make this. I didn't use the insta-cure either but I didn't need it.

I have no idea what all of the negative reviews are about. I made this for my wife and our friends, following the recipe to a T and it was incredible. The brisket was authentically pink and unbelievably tender. The only thing I did differently was to cook the brisket in a dutch oven at 350 degrees instead of on the stove. I think cooking it on the stove may have been what caused everyone else's to be so dry and tough.

Awful!!! Either way too long of cooking time, or the 8 day brine had an opposite effect on the meat. Whatever it was the meat was dry and hard as a rock. The only good thing about this recipe was the smell during the cooking process. I love the recipes from Bon Appetit and I am at a loss how this one made the cut.

I agree, I ended up overcooking the beef, and it ended up dry. I didn't think the flavor was all that great. Next time I'll just buy the corned beef already cured in the package.

Fabulous flavors-- the best corned beef I've ever had. I skipped the insta Cure, and I'm glad I did. The meat was a little dry, so I will try a shorter cooking time the next time. We made the March Bon Appetit supper club menu and had so much fun-- the 8 day lead time just enhanced the anticipation. I did cook the meat on the morning of the party so that I could cool the broth and skim the fat before cooking the vegetables, as recommended by another reviewer. It worked perfectly. The horseradish cream and Guinness mustard were both excellent.

Coned beef was a bit dry but amazingly flavored. I will make it again with the only change to reduce the cook time a bit.

This was absolutely the best corned beef my husband or I have ever had. The veggies were standard, but the lack of extra additives and preservatives in the meat and the sauce gave everything a clean, fresh taste. (I used Black Butte Porter to cook the meat and veggies.) Two comments about the cook who had dry tough meat and thought the veggies were greasy: I cooked a 6 lb. brisket for 2-1/2 hours total and it was melt in your mouth tender. Second, I accidentally eliminated the grease problem because I cooked the meat on a Sunday to prepare for a Tuesday birthday party. I refrigerated the meat and stock separately, threw away the fat that rose to the top, cooked the vegetables, reheated the meat, and had a grease- free meal!

I have made the recipe once and based upon the cooking time in the recipe, the corn beef will be dry. The brisket I used was about 1-1/2 times thicker on one end and that portion turned out great. I would reduce the cooking time for the recipe.

The instacure is not necessary, nor is it "authentic",if you are making New England Style Corned Beef. It is supposed to be gray.

followed this review to a T, and the beef came out tough and dry. vegetables were ok, but cabbage and onions were very greasy. best thing about this were the horseradish and mustard condiment recipes associated with this. i will definitely be seeking out a new recipe when/if making corned beef again.

Fabulous! No need for the instacure. It is just as tasty (and healthier) without it.
