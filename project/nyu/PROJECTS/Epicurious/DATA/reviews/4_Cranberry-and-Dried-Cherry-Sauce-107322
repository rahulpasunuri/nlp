I love this cranberry sauce! I made this the night before Thanksgiving. I took the advice of a few different reviewers, augmented the recipe slightly and it turned out fantastic! I am not a fan of really sweet cranberry sauce so I substituted the frozen juice for bottled Ocean Spray Cranberry juice and I did not pack the sugar. In fact I used 3/4 of a cup of unpacked sugar. I could not find tart cherries so I substituted them with Trader Joe's dark sweet cherries. I knew they would plump up once cooked them so I rough chopped them. Also I boiled the mixture for an additional nine minutes and it gelled up perfectly. The finished product was absolutely delicious! It was just tart enough for my tastes and sweet enough for my husband's tastes and he doesn't even like cranberry sauce. It was just me and him for Thanksgiving so I had a lot left over and I put it on everything! The turkey left-overs, dinner rolls, breakfast muffins, oatmeal, ice cream. This is my new cranberry sauce recipe from on.

I wanted to melt into the fragrance of this sauce. And it tasted just as lovely as it smelled. Can't wait to make it again!

As it is, the recipe is more soup than sauce, so I add 2-3 tbsp corn starch to thicken it up. I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last 5 years and it's always a hit.

I've been making and sharing this recipe for years. I successfully converted my father-in-law from canned cranberry "sauce" with this recipe. It is really tasty on cheesecake and freezes very nicely.

This is the best. I make it every year.

I love this recipe! My family enjoys it every year as part of both Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners! One word of advice: 9 minutes isn't nearly long enough to boil the sauce, unless you don't mind incredibly runny cranberry sauce. Tonight I boiled it for 15 minutes after adding the cranberries. Just keep in mind that it does not thicken much overnight, so make sure it has a nice thick consistency when you take it off the stove!

I've made this several times for Thanksgiving and even after trying other recipes, i always come back to this one. A great combo of sweet and tart, with the perfect amount of spice. This year I forgot to buy the frozen juice so I used cranberry juice in place of the frozen juice and water (probably 2C)and low-boiled it down with the spices and sugar to almost 1 cup. I continued the recipe as written and i worked just great!

I can't rate this as my variation was pretty different, but wow was it good! I made it for Thanksgiving. My cherries were not described as tart on the package, but the recipe didn't come out too sweet. Instead of the frozen juice concentrate and water, I used 20 oz. of Apple & Eve's cranberry juice. (It has no added sugar, but it is sweet from the other juices that make it up--e.g. apple). I was really surprised by how intensely cherry-flavored it was. The cranberry taste was there as well, though. It was just delicious. I can envision using it as a sauce on some sort of cake for a dessert. I'll be making it again next year!

This year is the first time that I made a cranberry sauce other than the traditional fresh berries, sugar and water. This was a big hit and is now my husbands favorite cranberry sauce. The cherries plump up and add an unexpected flavor and texture. It just gets better the longer it sits. I will definitely make this again.

Finally a recipe that makes my family give up that awful canned sauce. The cherries and cranberry cocktail give it a wonderful flavor. I do not like heavily spiced fruit so I omitted the allspice and left the cinnamon stick in only while cooking. Gave a very subtle cinnamon taste but it was right for me. This is a new addition to our Thanksgiving menu.

This will be my 3rd Thanksgiving to serve this sauce. Everyone loves this....even those that think they don't like cranberry sauce because their mom served it straight out of the can (rings and all). I've also made this to serve with pork tenderloin and ham. Love it as is, but will try someone's white wine suggestion as well!

Rating: 4
This sauce is delicious and versatile - if you like another flavor to your cranberry sauce, just swap the water for some other liquid like orange juice. Just cut back on the sugar. I like to use white wine. For those of you who found it runny, you must not have allowed the cranberries to burst. Cranberries contain a nature thickener and the sauce is incredibly thick once the cranberry juices are released and it has been chilled.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. For the 2 that did not like it, saying it was too runny..I don't know how that happened, unless you cooked it wrong. I cooked it at a rolling boil for 3 minutes with the cherries, then 10 minutes with cranberries, at a boil. When you see the bubble die down, and begin to slowly stack up, you know that enough water has been cooked out, and it will gelatinize in the cooler. Definitely let it sit overnight to allow flavors to mellow and allow full hydration of the cherries. Just a note, left the allspice out. Gran Marnier would be good in this I think. Best recipe for this sauce ever, and I have gone thru alot of trashy ones.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner today, and it was a big hit! People were asking for the recipe, asking me to make it again, and asking for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly, and was pleased to learn that, after a night of chilling in the fridge, the bitterness that was too strong while it was still hot had perfectly balanced with the cherries. Be sure to let it rest for a day or so. This is really my new favorite! I ate a bowl of it in mid-afternoon, just because I couldn't get enough.

I made it last year and my family actually requested that I make it again this year!.

This sauce was fabulous!I just purchased a smoker and cooked a half turkey breast in it. I was looking for an interesting sauce that would go well with the maple smoke. I'm not a big fan of concentrated frozen juices as they're usually way too heavy of the white grape juice and too sweet for my taste,so instead of the cranberry cocktail I used 12 oz of pure unsweetened pomagranite juice. Excellent. I'm going to be bringing this to my parents this Thanksgiving.

If you're looking for the perfect cranberry sauce look no further! This has become a favorite of family and friends, and I wouldn't think of Thanksgiving without it. It's also excellent on left-over turkey sandwiches! The tart dried cherries (as opposed to sweetened) really make this dish delicious and the spices are perfect.

I have made this many times and every time everyone raves. My in-laws have never really liked cranberry sauce before; I made it at Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law called me at Christmas for the recipe! Especially good if you can find real dried tart cherries as opposed to cherry flavored Craisins.

This is a wonderfully easy and great tasting compliment to turkey or pork. I made a double batch expecting (and hoping for) leftovers and everyone gobbled it up. I will definitely make this again! The family has asked that this dish be a tradition at our holiday dinners.

This sauce turned out to be a syrup! Adding the frozen crabberry cocktail on top of the brown sugar was way too much. Inedible. Had to throw it out and use another recipe.

This was truly excellent. We served it with a Southwest Sutffed turkey and the depth of flavor provided by the cherries complemented the chiles in the dressing very nicely!

I agree with the other chefs - this recipe is a keeper! I made it last year for Thanksgiving and was blown away by how much everyone loved it! It was a huge success. I followed the recipe exactly and did not change a thing (kind of unusual for me!) and it was just perfect. Give it a try - you wont be disappointed. One bit of advice though: make a double batch because it will disappear quickly!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year - family members were eating it with rolls, turkey, you name it. It's a snap to make, blows any store-bought sauce out of the water and stores well. It gets quite thick, so it makes a great jam on those leftover turkey sandwiches (try turkey, cream cheese and this sauce on a roll). In a pinch, a little ground cinnamon works in place of the stick.

I couldn't find concentrated cranberry juice, so I used concentrated cherry juice. Delicious!!!

I used only about half of the cherries called for in this recipe because some member of my family opened the package when they wanted a snack:p It still turned out delicious, and my husband said any more cherries would have been too much.

Excellent recipe. Refrigerating overnight gave it a gelified consistency. The cherries expand and add bulk to the recipe, creating more servings than you would get from other recipes using a 12-oz bag. My only change would be to add orange flavor or another liquor to give it an extra punch.

This recipe is easy to prepare and it was well recieved at my dinner table for the holidays. My husband does not like cranberry sauce but he really enjoyed this sauce. I look forward to putting it on my turkey sandwiches. To avoid the sauce being too liquidy I used 2 envelopes of Knox unflavored gelatine (the 1 oz box containing 4 1/4 ounce envelope)and cut the water to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.

Even my husband loves it, and he informed me before I made it that he hates anything with cranberries! :) Mine didn't turn out runny at all, but it is nothing like the canned/jar jelly type that you can find in stores. I used fresh cranberries instead of frozen, and dried bing cherries because I couldn't find "tart" ones. I will definitely make this again...
