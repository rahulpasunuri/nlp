We LOVE this pizza. But am I the only person whose tomatoes burn a little? I prepare this per the recipe, but each time I have this problem. Any suggestions?

This is super good and really easy. It has a really nice spiciness. It definitely requires a fork though, because it's piled high with stuff.

I couldn't find yellow squash so doubled up on the zucchini. I also used plain tomato pizza sauce, as I couldn't locate mushroom pizza sauce. I only used half of the specified amount of sauce. I baked on a pizza stone. After baking, I drizzled with balsamic glaze and then topped with chopped fresh basil. The presentation and taste were terrific.

Made as written except used tomato sauce that came with boboli and added mushrooms with other vegies. Yummy.

This was fast, easy, and a big hit at my impromptu pizza party! (Discriminating taste buds and all!)

Loved this easy and very fast to make pizza! I used triple mushroom pasta sauce by Classico as I could not find mushroom pizza sauce. It was great. Next time I would mix the sun dried tomatoes in with the vegetables and then top the pizza rather than laying the strips of tomatoes on top. That way they won't dry out. Bring on the garlic! Will definitely make this again..

Loved this pizza. Quick, healthy, and full of flavors. Next time would tone down the garlic as it was a bit overpowering.

This pizza was delicious! I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the squash. I'll definitely make this again, maybe adding some chicken or sausage. Yum! :o)

This was good. I did not use mushroom sauce - just Classico plain tomato & basil. Also, I did not use sun-dried tomatoes (although that would have been really good). A nice change from greasy sausage or pepperoni. Very quick and simple for weekdays.

I added some fontinella cheese along with the mozarella. And I used mushrooms and zucchini only. Truly a great treat!!!

Great pizza. I used a tomato portobella mushroom sauce. Replaced mozzarella cheese with friulano. Topped rest of ingredients with leftover tomato,feta salad,delicious. Everyone asked for it again the next day so I substituted asparagus for the zucchini and left the tomatoes off. Put circles of goats cheese on the top and slices of roasted peppers. Once again, delicious.

I softened dried mushrooms and added them to the boboli sauce. The garlic didn't spread easy and was too spicy so I will mix it into the sauce next time. I also added 1 sliced,habanero smoked chicken sausage on top. This is a very tasty pizza that really didn't need meat!

This was suprisingly fabulous! I added mushrooms and onion while sauting and everyone asked for the recipe. They too were suprised how simple the recipe was.

Had a little pizza party and served a number of homemade pies. Of all the pies I made, this one made such a hit, that numerous people took the recipe home with them. It's extremely moist and very elegant. I used plain pizza sauce and suateed fresh mushrooms along with the squashes. Find canned and jarred mushrooms very rubbery. Also, used part skim mozzarella, instead of the whole milk one. This substitution didn't affect the flavor or texture one bit. Bon apetit!

An excellent pizza-one of the best I've made! I added chopped vidalia onion with the squash, and canadian bacon for my meat-eating husband. We both really enjoyed it. This is one of those dishes where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And so easy for a weeknight supper!

Used as 1 of 4 appetizers in dinner for 30. Most enjoyed moderately but not "rave" reviews.
