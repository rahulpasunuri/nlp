Have made this many times and always a crowd pleaser. The warm goat cheese with the raspberry dressing is such a great combo. I press the almonds into the goat cheese and forego the egg/water/flour ingredients.

This was very good and a nice change from my standard salad rotation. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. My kids devoured it!

I used the crusted goat cheese portion of the salad. I had walnuts on hand so I used them instead and it turned out really well. I had some leftover fig jam I had made so I used that to make a version of the dressing. It was yummy.

This was absolutely fabulous. My entire family loved it. The color contrasts are beautiful: the green of the arugula, the yellow- white of the cheese and almonds, the bright beautiful red of the raspberry vinaigrette. The tangy raspberry dressing contrasted so well with the creaminess of a good goat cheese. The coolness of the dressing and arugula contrasted with the warmness of the cheese. Overall such a harmonious and interesting dish. It was quite easy to make, although it has many steps.

Loved the dressing. The goat cheese didn't stay together when baked but it was still delicious on the salad. It fell apart and got mixed into the salad but was great. I also threw in mini tomatoes and craisins. Yummy.

After trying a very similar salad years ago at Moxie, a restaurant in Beachwood, Ohio, I created my own version of this. I use pistachios and have always used fresh raspberries, vegetable oil and way, way less sugar. If you think this one is too sweet, try starting with 2 tablespoons of sugar and gradually adding more if you like. I have given my recipe to several friends and the only person who was not pleased with the results was the one who accidentally used olive oil. I have even adapted it based on the season with pears, apples, peaches, etc. I haven't made this version yet but I can't wait to try using the almonds and adding poppy seeds for a dinner party in a couple days. If you didn't like this, don't give up - just adapt!

This salad is a family favorite. I did substitute cider vinegar for the red wine and used fresh lemon juice. This salad has a beautiful presentation and is equally delicious.

This is one of the worst combinations I have ever tasted! There is nothing delicate about this. It is very pedestrian. The dressing was too thick and the goat cheese competed with the respberry.

To the cook from Memphis: aren't we all, ultimately, pedestrians? How silly ~ lighten up, folks! This salad is absolutely lovely and the goat cheese makes it fantastic! Myself, as a pedestrian, absolutely loved it, perfect for summery eating!

I made it at 2 back to back dinner parties- and everyone loved it both times!!! I higly recommend it, and have substituted pecans for the almonds, and still totally delicious. Also, I used the flavored goat cheese (ie- basil) and that gave it even more flavor. YUM!

Well, I suppose this is a case of one man's meat is another man's poison. Hate to be in the minority here, but I think this is one of the most overrated recipes on the site. Raspberry dressing was too thick and overly sweet. Have had far better goat cheese preps. All in all, a fairly pedestrian recipe.

Takes a very special recipe for me to give a 4 fork rating and this one earned that distinction in every way. The single best goat cheese salad I have ever made. Lovely and colourful presentation, truly delicious with an outstanding dressing that paired beautifully with the cheese/almonds. I used fresh berries rather than frozen, and extra mild olive oil as I don't care for the heavy oily taste of virgin olive oil in fruit dressings. To those cooks who found the dressing too sweet: Perhaps you used raspberries in syrup rather than plain frozen berries? That would certainly account for excess sweetness. If you enjoy goat cheese, you are sure to love this luscious salad - a treat for the eyes and the palate!

I made just the dressing in which I skipped the raspberries and substituted raspberry vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and one shallot for the red onion. It was a hit!

Tasty, easy, impressive. I'll be making it again, to be sure! The goat cheese is the perfect complement to it.

I'm obviously in the minority here, so it's probably something I did...the dressing tasted overwhelmingly of olive oil, like it just wouldn't emulsify. And the goat cheese was just too..there. I don't know--like I said, it was probably me.

I was so tired of my hum-drum salads so searched Epicurious for something a little different to serve at a dinner party. This salad got rave reviews from guests who are much better cooks than myself. I couldn't find mesclun in my grocery store but put a nice variety of other, more common lettuces together and it was just great.

This was really good, I loved the goat cheese, it was really good, and it was a nice compliment to the dressing. I did think the dressing was really sweet, I don't know if I would ever use it on it's own- But my guests all loved this, very pretty, easy to prepare in advance, and tasty.

Wonderful salad! The dressing was heavenly and the almond crusted goat cheese was such a wonderful compliment. I can't wait to make it again!

I made this salad last night for 8 women as part of a girls night and everyone loved it. The dressing itself is fantastic and the goat cheese is a wonderful complement to the sweet and tart dressing. Don't change anything about this recipe -- everyone asked for it afterwards! Following the salad, I served a mushroom risotto that I found in Isabel Allende's book entitled "Aphrodite: Memoire of the Senses." p.s. There will be plenty of dressing left-over which was not a problem in my case since my fiance helped himself to 3 servings today!

The onion taste in the dressing was really overwhelming so I tossed the first batch and re-made it with one change: I stirred the minced onion, along with the poppy seeds, into the dressing, by hand, after the rest of the ingredients had been emulsified in the food processor. Delicious! Definitely a keeper!

The raspberry dressing is easy to make and amazingly good. I will never go back to store bought raspberry vinegarette. I had a hard time getting the almond slices to stick to the goat cheese, but it still tasted wonderful.

I kept waiting for the almonds to toast, and by the time they did the goats cheese was dried out. Next time I will bake only the time specified in the recipe. Makes enough dressing to serve the entire city of Los Angeles.

Wonderful recipe. I made it for my grandparents who are used to pretty basic cuisine and they loved it. It does make way to much dressing. To save time I used store bought rasberry dressing and it was just as good.

This salad dressing is exceptional. We add all of the juice of one lemon instead of just the teaspoon for brightness. This is excellent with pears, blue chees, and pecans or how we had it last night with fresh raspberries, blackberries, crumbled goat cheese, and toasted almonds (not in the patty form). Simply outstanding.

This is one of the best salads I've ever had, and I couldn't even find goat cheese! (Ok, so I only went to one supermarket.) I substituted queso fresco instead, which I'm not even sure is a viable substitutue, but it was awesome! I had it for lunch and was thinking about it for the rest of the day. Heck, I'm still thinking about it now! The combination of the warm cheese, almonds and raspberries is wonderful. I think adding something salty, like bacon, would be even better.

absolutely outstanding dressing!!! everyone ate like three bowls of salad and the color is gorgous!!!!! I made a mesclun and arugula salad with diced red onion, I added chopped hazelnuts and dried cranberries from Trader Joes. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Rating: 3
I DID make it ahead of time (the goat cheese prep) add then just baked the goat cheese right before serving. Also made the dressing ahead. Makes a lot of dressing. Also found the dressing a bit "oniony". May want to cut back on the red onion to 1 T instead of 2. But DO use the 2 slices of goat cheese!! After all, it IS a goat cheese salad. For fun I may try toasted & chopped pecans or pistachios next time instead of almonds. No problem with the almonds, just thought it might be fun to try (maybe do one slice of goat cheese w/almonds, and the other w/another nut.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful recipe! The goat cheese was mild (which I was glad) and can be prepared the day before. I just didn't bake it until we were ready for it. I also added sugared walnuts to the salad. The best part, besides making everything ahead of time, is the dressing. Absolutely wonderful dressing and I will definately make it again!

The warm goat cheese was wonderful on a salad, the dressing was a little to thick for me.

I haven't made it yet but when I do I will prepare the cheese ahead of time including adding the butter. Remove from the refrigerator 30 mins before popping in the oven. I also think adding the dressing to the greens is a good idea and top with one slice of cheese. Can't wait.

DOES ANYONE KNOW IF YOU CAN ASSEMBLE AND BAKE THE CHEESE AHEAD OF TIME, THEN REHEAT LATER? I KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T MUCH PREP INVOLVED BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED EVERY ADVANTAGE:)

Please note that I am only reviewing the raspberry dressing as I didn't make this salad. What a great dressing - thick and creamy with a heavenly taste and gorgeous colour! Served with a salad of mixed baby greens, sliced papaya, fresh raspberries, thinly sliced red onions, toasted pine nuts and a generous sprinkling of pomegranate seeds. Would be a great dressing for any fruit salad. It is so good I could almost eat it on ice cream! What a winner!

I've made this salad a half dozen times and receive rave reviews with each serving! This was an impressive addition for my gourmet wine and cooking club dinner. I think that 2 rounds of goat cheese per salad is a bit much and have reduced each salad to 1 round. The dressing has been a HUGE hit - the recipe makes far more than is needed for the noted servings, so there's always lots left over to enjoy throughout the week. I was initially surprised by the thick consistency of the dressing and thought I'd prefer a thinner version, but I've come to enjoy the dressing prepared exactly as the recipe describes!

We really liked the raspberry dressing. Instead of this salad though, I used mixed (mild) greens, blueberries and smoked, soft mozzarella cheese. It was wonderful! I imagine one could substitute any number of fruits (pear, peach...) and any number of cheeses (mild, soft). The only suggestion I have is to add toasted pecans...

Rating: 3
Would definitely make this again, especially the dressing - which would go well on lots of things. However, goat cheese baked 10 mins. was too soft to get out of pan and keep it's shape. Tasted great, but not as pretty as I hoped. Added a blood orange slice and a couple of kalamata olives to each salad for extra interest.

My fiancée liked this, but I did not. I agree that the cheese takes 20 minutes rather than 10. I found the dressing to be overpowering, though it certainly matched the goat cheese. Next time, I'll try something different.

This salad is fantastic! The goat cheese becomes smooth and creamy in the oven. I had to bake mine for 20 minutes instead of the 10 in the recipe tho.

I only made the dressing for this, so I can't comment on the rest, but wow! I served it on a bed of mixed baby greens with diced red bell pepper, the rest of the red onion in slivers, diced Jonathan apples, and gruyere cheese, and it was phenomenal! A guest, a caterer's son at that, said it was the absolute best he had ever had. I did cut the sugar down to almost 1/3 a cup and the olive oil in half, and it was the perfect consistency. The flavors mixed extremely well, so it was ready to serve that night. I think this one needs 5 forks for the five minute effortless glory it produced.

Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I've made this twice for two different groups and everyone loved it. I sent the dressing home with one guest. The goat cheese ensemble, to die for! YUM!

I agree...Cut down on the oil as well as the sugar. In answer to previous inquirer. I froze for two weeks and did not seem to suffer..I used boston lettuce, placed l/2 pear on each plate. Personally I prefer a bit of stilton on the pear instead of the warm goat cheese. Both are good. Am going to prepare again only going to use Stilton.

I served this salad at a seniors Christmas dinner for 40 this weekend to rave reviews. The warm goat cheese "croutons" were a delicious addition to the salad, and the dressing was such a beautiful raspberry red! I had many requests for the recipe, and the leftover dressing we put out in containers at the end of the dinner was gone before I turned around. This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe. However, the whole egg flour thing is not something you want to go through all the time, only special occasions. So next time I will try what previous reviewers suggested and microwave the cheese and add the almonds on top. I did reduce the sugar and it was great. A little dressing goes a long way so don't over do it. Does anyone know how long it can be refrigerated?

Rating: 4
I did what one person recomended. I toasted the almonds and heated the goat cheese in the microwave. The cheese is very soft when this is done and I spooned it over the salad. I sprinkled the salad with the almonds and added a few fresh raspberries. I used fresh raspberries, less oil and 1/2 the sugar. It was wonderful.

We loved the taste; the colors of the assembled salad were so appetizing. When I make it again, I'll eliminate coating the cheese and taking the time to bake it. As a short cut, I'll toast the almonds separately,heat the cheese last minute in the microwave and crumble it over to be able to achieve the same taste combination of hot and cold.
