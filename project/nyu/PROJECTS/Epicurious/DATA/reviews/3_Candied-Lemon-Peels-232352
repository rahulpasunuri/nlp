These are easy to prepare and taste GOOD. Like the cook from Toronto, I cut the sugar and water.My curls were not "cute" but I used them to top the Caramelized Lemon Tart, instead of caramelizing.

definitely use way less water and sugar - i used 1/4 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar for one large lemon. i used mine for decorating cupcakes, and took each peel out of the syrup, while still hot, and curled them tightly around a toothpick, let them cool and then dusted them with the sugar. they looked pretty cute!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly and my peels turned brown by the time the 3rd boil was done!! I tried it again, but this time I skipped all of the boiling stages, and just boiled them in the sugar/water mix and continued from there. They retained their color and came out perfect! I did the same process with lemon slices as garnish on a lemon cake.

It is a good idea to save the leftover water/sugar mixture & use it as a simple syrup for cocktails etc. It is then flavored from whatever fruit you use.

I just made a batch of these to use on a lemon olive oil cake on this site. They came out great, but I agree that the recipe leaves way too much unused sugar water. I will halve the amount next time. After I removed the peels, I trimmed out any extra piths remaining to prevent bitterness. I then cut them into thin strips. I chose to skip the final step where these are coated with with another layer of sugar since I preferred them glistening, not grainy.

I was able to use eight Meyer lemons with this amount of water and sugar, and it ended up working very well. I also cut the peels into eighth-inch strips and left them in the boiling sugar-water mixture for 25 minutes, which made them less chewy. Side note: add an equal amount of lemon juice to the leftover syrup for a great base for lemonade (1 part base to about 3 or 4 parts water).

Candied peel turned out wonderfully. I did the peel from one lemon and one orange and there was still heaps of syrup, so I would halve the amount of water and sugar next time. I found the candied peel was still bitter, even after the 3 boilings. I would probably boil it 6 times to see if that removes the rest of the bitterness.

I made this recipie as written to test to see if a recipie this easy was really as good as the fussier recipies and the result was very pleasing. From start to finish this took just over an hour and the candied peels where delicious. A definate keeper.
