This was a big hit. Everyone loved them. I did not have minced green onion, so I put a dash of onion powder in. They were so good. We had them for Easter, so I hard boiled the eggs, cut them in half, removed the yolk and then colored the whites. They looked very festive and tasted delicious. Will definitely make them again.

Yummy! I prepared the recipe as written with the exception of the radishes, which I didn't have on hand. Many of my guests commented on the deviled eggs. My husband said they were the best deviled eggs he has ever had. I thought the jalapeno chile might make the eggs too hot, but not so. The sweetness of the chutney balanced out the heat.

I have to say that I was rather hesitant about the ingredients for these deviled eggs, but having tried them, I quite like them! I'm overseas, so couldn't get to Trader Joe's, so used Major Grey's Chutney, and I had to make my own garam masala (there are recipes online for it). I also had to used pickled jalapeños, since there weren't any fresh to be had. These are even better the 2nd day (I had more than would fit on my egg plate). I would definitely make these again.

This is probably now my new favorite deviled egg recipe to make. The only change that I've made to the recipe was to substitute the mayonnaise for plain yogurt. I like the little bit of tang (and the lower cholesterol) that the yogurt adds. I do think that there is a nice balance of semi-sweetness from the chutney offset with the heat. I do add more jalapenos and some cayenne to bump the heat up a bit. The radish is a good counterbalance in flavor (clean/fresh) to the filling (very rich) as well as texture. (crisp vs creamy). That being said, it's my preference to make sure that the filling is as smooth as possible, and pipe it in -- makes for a *much* neater presentation

these were soooo good! the flavors are mild but very tasty. The radish is more than a garnish. It really adds flavor. Highly recommend!

I just brought these to a neighborhood cocktail party. They went fast and I got compliments. Often, I like to adjust recipes I find, but I think this one works well as-is. I used French breakfast radishes for the garnish, which turned out to add just the right crunch and zip without being overpowering. One suggestion for those who have had trouble with the eggs sliding around: I served them arranged in a glass pie plate. It looked nice, and the high sides kept the eggs from sliding off.

Just finished these. I'm a bit amazed the reviews were so positive. These were good...a bit more interesting than the traditional deviled egg. However, they are sooo similar in flavor to the go to using relish (mango chutney) and paprika (garam masala) that I was hoping for a more unique flavor. Just too similar to my old stand by recipe, but good none the less. I followed this exactly using Trader Joe's chutney which is not horribly sweet, as recommended.

I doubled this recipe, and added a bit of cayenne for heat. EVen with that, I wasn't a big fan of the sweetness added by the chutney (and I used excellent mango chutney, from Kalustyan's here in NYC). That stated, EVERYONE else was crazy about them, more so than any other deviled egg recipe I've made. So maybe it's just my preference for a more classic, spicier recipe that held me back.

What a wonderful combination of flavors and texture! The spicyness is balanced out by the slight sweet from the mango chutney. I took these along with some chipotle deviled eggs to a party and these were gobbled up fast!

I took these to a friends house for Thanksgiving. They disappeared immediately! Nice change from the usual deviled egg. For once, I didn't even modify the recipe! Very tasty.

A Great Deviled Egg! I took these to a Sunday brunch & someone else had brought traditional D.E. - mine were gobbled up & they were asking for more. Follow the recipe, but make sure to taste before filling. I adjusted the garam masala & chutney to get the mix I wanted. Also, don't forget the fresh radish. The texture of the filling & crunch of radish make an excellent combination. Like the cook from Miami, I cut them vertically. A very nice presentation. Also used a cake decorator cone to fill - makes a clean look.

Needed more heat and less sweet. Did subst apricot jam for mango chutney; perhaps causing the sweet. Did have indian flavor; but not the depth other cooks have described.

Nice change-up on the traditional deviled eggs. The eggs have a slight sweetness to them and the radishes add a little contrast in flavor and color.

I made these with left over Easter Eggs and brought them to a family Easter event. I can't eat eggs, so I didn't try any, but they disappeared very quickly and got RAVE reviews from the rest of the family. I will definitely make these again to bring to a gathering in the future.

This is scrumptious! You can also substitute dried apricots which you soak for 10 minutes in water before chopping, for the mango chutney, if you don't have any at hand.

Very unique flavor. Also pretty fun to make.

I brought these as an appetizer to Easter dinner. They were delicious. I split the eggs vertically and cut a sliver off each end; this makes it much easier to serve the eggs standing on a plate, and to pick them up and eat them. I minced the sliced-off egg- white slivers and mixed them into the yolk mixture. I also followed the tip for putting the yolk mash into a plastic bag and piping it from a cut tip. I didnt find that worthwhile, and for another batch just spooned the filling in with an iced-tea spoon; it was less fuss and came out just as well. I had no radishes and used a bit of paprika as garnish; I think the radish definitely would improve it, for color, texture, flavor. Leftovers made great lunches throughout the week.

A couple people at the pot luck I brought these to asked if they had crack in them, because they are so addictive. Made the garam masala myself (plenty of recipes for it online), subbed half a serrano for the jalapeno (wasn't spicy enough, so added some shakes of Tapatio), but otherwise followed the recipe. Don't skip the radishes - they make such a pretty presentation, and the fresh crunch they add is deelish!

Fabulous--even the kids liked them!

Its fund to make your own garam masala to use in this recipe. Makes the whole house smell glorious. Terrific recipe.

The mango chutney adds just a little sweetness to balance the jalapeno.

I don't like mango chutney so I left that out and I used medium eggs instead of large ones because I think they look better on the plate. The rest of the recipe stayed the same. They were so beautiful elegant and delicious. All were devoured before dinner.
