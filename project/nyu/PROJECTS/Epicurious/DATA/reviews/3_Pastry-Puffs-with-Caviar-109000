Very elegant hors d'oeuvre! I added a dollop of sour cream on top.

What an interesting twist on a classic!

I actually thought this was a bit boring. The puffs are easy to make but the whole thing just didn't have enough taste to me. I used paddlefish caviar which I like. I'd rather just serve it with toastpoints.

This recipe is great for impressive hors d'oeuvres. I made this for a housewarming. My guests were very impressed by the effort even though it wasn't too difficult to put together. I did have to buy a pastry bag and tips, but it was well worth it. I contemplated getting just a tip and using a ziplock as well for the pastry bag, which could've also worked. The pastry puff recipe is fantastic and easy. I was a little worried about the price of the caviar and instead opted to go a cheaper route using pike caviar (from trader joe's) and another type that I found at ikea (shhhh!). Much more economical than splurging on sevruga or osetra. The taste probably wasn't as delicate, but for my audience, it didn't matter to much. When I invite the foreign dignitaries, I'll consider splurging.
