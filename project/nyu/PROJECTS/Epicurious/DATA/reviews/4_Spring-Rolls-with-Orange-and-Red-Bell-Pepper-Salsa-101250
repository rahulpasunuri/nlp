Super yummie. I made my spring rolls and added this 'salsa' to the rolls! I let the salsa marinade for 30 mins and then added the juices left over from this salsa to my dipping sauce.

I loved this salsa, I served it with homemade fresh spring rolls, my husband and I ate it all up!!!

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make. I served this over baked tilapia and it was great. Would definitely make this again to serve over fish.

Excellent! Very colorful and even more yummy. I followed the recipe exactly, using a combo of green & red jalapenos. I chopped all ingredients that afternoon and assembled/combined about 1 hr in advance. I agree w/recipe not to make more than 2 hrs in advance (ok - you can push it to 3 hrs I think). Also used as a topping/salsa for asian marinated chicken.

I thought this was a perfect side sauce for egg rolls. It had a wonderful light, orangey-cilantro flavor. I did add more soy sauce and a splash of rice vinegar (flavored w/peppers) to give it more juice. One suggestion: wear gloves when cutting the peppers. I would defintely serve this again - it got great reviews from our guests.

This was a wonderful compliment to homemade chicken spring rolls. I also used this as a salsa for a grilled pork tenderloin which had been marinated in soy/honey/orange juice/olive oil and fresh garlic. It was great!!

This was GREAT! The flavors were light and tasty. The fresh ginger really completed the dish. I made barley-lemon spring rolls to go with it. It met the requirements of my strict vegetarian guests and tasted wonderful.

My wife (a Filipina) had not come across this recipe before, usually making the Philippines "Lumpia Shanghai" ones. So we thought we`d try this new one... and loved `em!
