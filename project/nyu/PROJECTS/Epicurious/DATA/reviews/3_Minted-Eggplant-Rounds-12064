Nothing special.

I made this dish for my dinner club, which includes 10 people. 3 of us (including me) thought it was ok but nothing great. 7 people couldn't eat more than one bite because the fish sauce was so strong. I had to throw away the plastic container I used to hold the fish sauce because I couldn't get the smell out. I will not make this again.

Delicious! What a wonderful summer appetizer - very fresh tasting. I plan on making it again & again!

This is a great appetizer. I've made it a few times, and everybody scarfs it up. I really enjoy it with a store bought Tempura sauce too, and some people like it with Ranch dressing (insert sigh here __).

easy and very good, flavor was rather robust so i'd pair it up with simple flavors like a coconut or jasmine rice and grilled pork loin.

I didn't find this great, or bad. It just wasn't terribly exciting.

This dish was great, simple and different. I recommend it highly! Yum!

I've made this several times and love it! Sometimes I use regular eggplant and cut it into slices a little less than half-inch to make it cook faster. Sometimes I brown the eggplant on a flat skillet until it's done. The fish sauce is really great -- just the right blend of sweet and sour and the mint gives it a really surprising flavor. And because you can serve it at room temperature, it's very convenient to make for cook-outs.
