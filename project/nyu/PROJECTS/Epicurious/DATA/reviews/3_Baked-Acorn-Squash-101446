The apples definitely make it more kid-friendly. I waited halfway through the cooking to add the apples, so they wouldn't get too mushy. And then added cinnamon and brown sugar to the apples. Needed additional cooking time (perhaps because of the apples). Delicious.

Yummy and filling. I just ate a half for lunch. It was a bit dry though. Next time I'll cover the whole pan with foil to help the squash absorb some of the moisture in.

I made this last night with the addition of the apples and garlic. I also added some chicken bacon. In my excitement about the bacon I realized I forgot the butter! It was great, even without the butter. Less calories in the end as well...

I didn't have apples, but wanted the sweet flavor. I had some raisins in the pantry so I threw those in, as well as some pine nuts I had left over.I would definitely make this again. It was soooooo good!

Don't use ginger, and use the colorful acorn squashes (colors like gourds). Secret: they're not decorative, they're pretty food. The green ones have much less flavor. You don't even need cinnamon if you get good ones...

Use butter, brown sugar and nutmeg. One squash cut in quarters will serve four.

This was my first experience eating/cooking acorn squash. I thought it went well. Since I've never had it before, I wasn't sure how soft I should let the squash get. I think I will have to experiment a little with it, but I did like the different spices...great fall/winter flavors.

This was good. I added pine nuts, and scored the insides of the squash halves so they'd absorb more flavor.

bake as the recipe states. don't change a thing. easy and delicious.

The only change I made was to bake the squash halves with the cut side down for 30 minutes then I turned them over and added the butter, sugar, and spices. I returned them to the hot oven but turned it off and left them there until we were ready for dessert. I then cut it into ¼ and served. We liked it a lot.

As the first reviewer stated, use bacon. I add 1 slice bacon with the brown sugar and butter to each half and let the whole thing cook for about an hour. Great!

This was great!! I changed the recipe a little bit...I cut the squash in half and baked it for 40 min. at 400 degrees. I then took it out, scooped out the middle and mixed it with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and a dash of cloved. Then I put that back in the oven for another 20 minutes and it came out perfect! This went great with the roasted herbed chicken recipe I got off of this site.

Well, I did the first way they suggested in the recipe, and then I followed the suggestions below. Instead I microwaved the squash, seeded, added the other ingredients and put the squash under the broiler until a light gold. Incredibley easy and fully cooked.

I took the advice of the Atlanta GA chef, by turning the squash over (skin up) and adding butter and brownsugar later, but I would do it a bit different next time; because that madeit soggier, you want the butter and sugar to really bake into the squash. What i would do is cook it "upside down" for only 15 mins max, and then follow this recipe. I would like to try the chestnut recipe offered on this site. OVERALL I love Gourmet's recipes - they always turn out very good. Thanks!

The magic of the wicrowave comes into play here. I have successfully "baked" acorn squash in the Microwave for years. Simply poke holes (icepick)in each and microwave on high for 7-10 minutes; remove it; let it cool for a few minutes;scoop out the seeds and fix it any you please---a real time saver !

As a working mother I try and make cooking as simple but tasty at the same time. Instead of baking the squash I cut them in half and removed the seeds. Then added a pat of butter and put it in the micrwave foe ten min. When the squash was cool I scooped out the meat and added more butter,cinnamon and a bit of sugar. Then whipped it to a smooth consistency. Saved a lot of time baking and it was GREAT.

I had a problem with the cooking time as did the Albany cook, my squash wasn't hard but not soft enough. I filled them with crystalized ginger, brown sugar, butter and water. I liked it but I think I'll try it next time at 400 degrees or maybe 350 at 1.5hrs.... I enjoyed it nonetheless.

There was a label stuck on the acorn squash I purchased that had a similar recipe to this one. However, they recommended postponing the butter and brown sugar until after the squash is cooked and, instead, flipping the squash "skin-side up" in a glass dish with an inch of water. I cooked it like this at 375 deg for 45 minutes, placed them on serving plates and put a dollop of butter and a tablespoon of light brown sugar. Yum! It was tender from steaming upside down in the water. I would definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe sounded delicious....I love squash. I improvised a little with the other suggestions I read using diced apples and maple syrup, etc. I am still waiting for the squash to cook, however. At an hour at 350 covered with alluminum foil it was still as hard as a rock. It has been an hour and a half now and it's just starting to soften. Maybe the squash wasn't ripe? Or my oven doesnt cook evenly? Anyway, I can't wait to try it. Any suggestions or comments about how long to cook?

I've never been wild about sweet squash so I improvised. Instead of water I used vegetable broth to cook the halves in. I put a little butter in the middle and then I sprinkled salt, pepper, ground thyme and rosemary over the squash. Baked covered for 40 minutes, uncovered for 20. Yummy, and it smells amazing.

I thought the squash prepared this way was very bland--perhaps I did not sprinkle on enough spices, but it was better after I poured some maple syrup over it.

This is a good basic recipe, but I agree with Skye that acorn squash is even better more elaborately prepared. I used a tablespoon of butter per half, then sprinkled the cavity with brown sugar. For two halves, I diced up one Fuji apple and sprinkled the pieces lightly with fresh lemon juice and just a tad of nutmeg, a pinch of cloves, and a minuscule dash of cinnamon. Then to really bring out the flavor I added two cloves of minced *garlic.* (I suppose I could have used up some of the fresh ginger I had in the fridge too, darn it.) Exquisite! The garlic-apple combo was fantastic! And don't forget to cover the dish with foil for a good initial portion of the baking time to keep it from drying out on top. Using a bit of water for steam, and 350 for an hour is a good guideline.

COVER & BAKE 40-50 MIN, UNTIL TENDER. DRAIN OFF WATER. DIVIDE BUTTER AMONG HALVES & MASH LIGHTLY INTO CAVITY. FILL WITH LAMB MIXTURE. BAKE AT 375, 10-15 MIN OR UNTIL HOT. It became such a family favorite, that every birthday (each of 5 kids, spouces and grandkids) at my parents this was the meal requested. Not too sweet, but not bitter or salty either.

I loved this, it was so good! I followed the instructions, with a pat of butter, brown sugar (liberally) and cinnamon and baked for an hour at 350, easy and delicious! Served with the roast pork tenderloin with cranberry/balsamic sauce found here in Nov. '98 Bon Appetit, very good!

The recipe as it is stated is supreme in my estimation! However.. I am a doctor-upper-er of Acorn Squash! Here is what I do! Cut in half, scoop out seeds, gently trim bottoms to stand, fill with pad of unsalted butter, and chunks of a good baking apple with peelings on and chunked in 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch pieces, we like Mutsu's, layer with about 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and if you really want to go whole full tilt boogie.. add some cranberries and walnuts! Bake in the water filled pan the way the recipe indicates.. I serve the squash in a pretty little bowls with teaspoons! Oh.. the savory sweet flavors are just awesome! This goes with any roasted meat, but we especially like it with sage/butter roasted chicken.

Try this with less sugar - squash is naturally sweet - and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon curry powder over the butter in the centre and also over the cut edges. This is my family's favourite way to eat squash.

I can't believe you hate this recipe! My mother, at best a mediocre cook, prepared squash in the same manner to serve with roasted sausages and potatoes. I loved coming home to the smell of squash and cinnamon. I cook squash in a similar manner today. After scooping out the seeds, I place the squash upsidedown on a rack in a pan deep enough to hold about 1/2 inch of water. To the water, I add 1 split vanilla bean, 1 cinnamon stick and 2-3 cardamom pods. Bake as listed, refilling the water as necessary. When the squash is tender, I remove the flesh to a bowl and add the butter and nutmeg. I prepared squash (this time butternut) this way to use in soup last Thanksgiving. It was a hit - reminiscent of warm, smooth pumpkin pie.

Focus was the problem in this recipe. With acorn squash one should go salty, not sweet. What happens when one attacks something such as an acorn squash with sweeteners is that you try to overpower the flavor of the squash rather than compliment it. Try this: Cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, fill scouped out section with 2T butter and 1clove raw garlic. Bake in oven for 1 hr on 350 (Place small pan of water in oven also for humidity). While squash is cooking, fry 4 slices bacon. Pat bacon dry. Reserve small amt. of bacon grease to lightly saute 1/2 cup cashew halves. Scoop inside of cooked squash halves into bowl. Add another 2T. butter. Mix well and refill hollowed squash halves. Top w/ bacon and nuts. Serve and Enjoy.
