This was delicious. Substituted craisins for the currants. I tripled the recipe for a party of 20 people. Hand-pealing 6 lbs of boiling onion was a tremendous amount of work. But well worth it. Received rave reviews from everyone. Even my two-year-old son was eating them.

It was tasty, but not exceptional enough to take as a side dish to a dinner party.

I've been making these every Thanksgiving since it was first published in Bon App in '98. I tried to skip it one year and my family rebelled. I also tried frozen pearl onions and to me they just don't taste as good. Ok to use for a mid-year treat, but not at Thanksgiving.

I cannot tell a lie - preparing this many boiling onions is A LOT OF WORK. But it's worth it. I will look into frozen onions next time. I've made this several times. It is absolutely incredible. I've made exactly as shown. I do like mixing white or yellow onions with purple onions - looks prettier. When I can't get my hands on currants, I chop up some raisins - equally delicious. Highly, highly recommend!!

FANTASTIC DISH!!! Didn't have the currants - used dried cranraisins instead. Also used a bag of frozen pearl onions - saved time and $ as they were 1/2 the price of fresh without having to take the time to peel those little suckers. Also love to put the cold leftovers in a baby green salad.

Excellent. Perfect for Thanksgiving. Made it exactly as stated, except added most of the fresh thyme just before serving. I believe cooking it the day before and reheating it improves the flavor.

This side dish was a hit at this year's Thanksgiving dinner. Received many compliments. This recipe will become a staple in the Vogel household.

One of our favorite dishes. We started making this dish for Thanksgiving years ago and have made it every year since. I also pair it with beef dishes often. I leave out the currents as I do not care for them. Depending on what else I am cooking, I make extra sauce.

Excellent. Everyone raved. Made earlier in day, and warmed up.

The great chef, Douglas Foster, made this for our Three Family Thanksgiving 2004. It was a big hit and went well with his smoked ham. I will make it for Christmas.

a delicious veggie dish that has the bonus of being able to do ahead and just heat up (I microwave, sometimes) a few minutes before seating your guests to dinner

Great receipe. I use half cippoline, half purple or white pearl onions. A bit more butter and not quite so many currants. This receipe has won raves at Thanksgiving two years in a row.

This is a very good recipe...but I will make changes next time. There are too many currants and I would reduce them to about 2-3 Tblsp. I would reduce the sauce a little before adding the onions, and then add them for about 5-10 minutes. I made them the night before to this stage and chilled them. One hour before the turkey was ready I baked them in the oven at 350* for about an hour. I say keep it simple and try to save time.

This is a variation on a recipe that was printed in Bon Appetit in 1997, which has never appeared in its own full glory here on Epicurious. However, the differences were that you used golden raisins (although currants sound great), and you also added some toasted slivered almonds at the end. I have to say that the almonds make a wonderful difference in flavor and in texture, and I would never consider preparing the dish without them. It's a terrific Thanksgiving addition-- a lot of people who won't go for cranberry sauce love this.

I plan on doing this dish again this year for Thanksgiving. It's easy and it gets rave reviews. Its an updated version of the creamed onions that were served to me in the '60s.

Very good, got requests for the recipe, but I had to cook the onions much much longer for them to glaze nicely, more like an hour!

Fabulous! This was a huge hit with my guests, and it was our most popular leftover dish from Thanksgiving. I substituted steamed carrots for half the onions. Both the onions and carrots were delicious.
