Very simple, presents well as appetizer and truffle oil is a must.

Very simple recipe, guests loved it. I cheated and used truffle olive oil (student budget) but didn't really taste it once all was said and done. I ended up broiling the spears for 10 minutes to crisp up the prosciutto and they turned out great.

I love this simple appetizer. I think that the key to working with prosciutto is keeping it cold. I sometimes put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes before, seems to help with the "clingy" problem!

Very nice hors d'hoeuvre; light, earthy, simple but satisfying flavors. Won't fill you up before you get to the rest of the meal. We served the asparagus w/ pomegranate-ginger champagne cocktail and another hors d'houevre with caviar.

I liked this a lot, however, we pre-tested both prosciutto and thin-sliced smoked ham and decided to go with the ham. Just as tasty, a little less greasy and easier to bite. Also the prosciutto wasn't in large size slices so we had to "patch" which made it messy looking. The ham worked great.

Wowed my book club. Used black truffle oil instead of white because that's what I had (it's still a clear liquid), and that added the secret flavor that made these stand out. Had to go out for more prosciutto. Twenty-four spears of asparagus required 12 slices (halved), so I used less than a pound of asparagus and more than 1/3 lb. of prosciutto. Next time I'll do it by numbers rather than weight. Four spears each satisfied the group.

Well worth making for any cocktail party, or appetizer before dinner guests sit down. I used it at a party I catered. Added a little more truffle oil so that it just overcame the butter flavor.

This recipe is very easy to make and is impressive as a dinner party appetizer. The deli counter at my market slices the prosciutto and places wax paper in between each slice. This makes separating the slices very easy.

Looks like a four star rest. did my catering. People are wowed and it tastes superb. As for the other coments patience is a requirement in cooking and gardening. Good things are worth the effort and the more you work with tricky foods the easier it gets. Honest!

DELICIOUS!!!! I had to use Virgina ham instead of prosciutto but everybody loved this and I think that I won't pay the difference of price if everybody loved the way I made it.

While very tasty, this "simple" dish was much too fussy to prepare. Separating out the prosciutto made it very frustrating and difficult to work with. Unless anyone has suggestions for how to make the prosciutto less self-clingy I will not make this again.

So easy and elegant! I tried it once as written... and again without the butter. I think it's still great with a little white truffle oil just drizzled over the prosciutto.
