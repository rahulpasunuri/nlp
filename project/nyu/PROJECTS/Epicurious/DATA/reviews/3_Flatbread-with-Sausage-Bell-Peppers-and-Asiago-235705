Great recipe. I used a spicy lamb sausage instead of the Italian, and made the dough myself in a bread maker. The cheese on the flatbread is a great texture and nice, biting flavor. Overal, the entire dish could use a bit more spice - perhaps some garlic and/or red pepper.

This was fantastic! I did add a few things: a teaspoon of dill seed and dehydrated onions to the dough. I also sauteed the red peppers, adding onions, mushrooms and garlic before putting it on the top of the dough. My husband loved it too.
