I just made this for a Superbowl party we attended that had a Mexican theme. I made it exactly as per the recipe except that I doubled it. I have to say I was disappointed with it and it was not a particular hit with the other partygoers. Maybe we had too many tequila shots? Haha, but seriously, this wasn't that great. I think with some tweaking, it could be better. Maybe some goat cheese would have made it tastier.

This is fantastic with endless possibilites. Place some grilled salmon, chicken, or steak right on top. Add some black beans, awsome. I did not use frozen corn, used fresh, grilled it, then cut it off the cob. The dressing wilts the spinach, which I tore into smaller pieces. We had this salad with grilled steak, loved it.

This is a great salad. I increased the chipotles and have also made it using Napa cabbage when I couldn't get good spinach @ the little local grocery

I just made this to test drive it for a big party and it is seriously tasty. I made it just as indicated with one exception. I peeled the corn husks and just roasted the corn on the cob over the stove flame while I was doing the red bell pepper. It got a tiny bit brown and started to spit and pop. It was perfect and added a bit of that roasty flavor. Don't listen to mr san mateo. He skipped the chipotle pepper which makes the flavor. It is perfect as indicated

It's worth the time to roast the corn while you're doing the peppers. Soak for 30 minutes first, and then grill. I added chopped lettuce to chopped spinach and cilantro. Great results!

Surprisingly, I did not like this! It didn't have much flavor, though I must admit that I had to substitute jalapenos for the chipotle chilies. Might be better without the spinach leaves.

This is a great, easy to make salad. The other reviewers had some terrific suggestions that I followed including using roasted red peppers from the supermarket or trader joes. I also liked using red onion better than the green onion. I've made this salad with spinach and then another time with romaine lettuce. Both times it was a hit.

I like to use fresh corn off the cob if it's in season,and always add jicama too. I've made it with and without the spinach. This is a great recipe to quadruple or more! For a buffet or picnic, I think it holds up better without the spinach

Nothing inoffensive about this salad. But I'm not sure I would make it again. My guests liked it.

The vegetables marinaded in the dressing then tossed with fresh spinach gives an interesting twist. I love the addition of cilantro. The salad has a Southwestern taste and is a wonderful accompaniment to a Mexican or Southwest meal. So easy and so good. Even my picky husband liked it.

This salad was easy to make and very good. I used jarred roasted bell peppers but I thought the texture wasn't crisp enough. Next time, I will roast them myself. The dressing was nice and spicy.

I followed the advice of an earlier review that said to pan roast frozen corn in a little oil and garlic powder. That didn't work at all! The corn was rubbery, and the flavor wasn't much better. So I tossed that out and started over just following the recipe. It was a huge hit!

Wow! This is really good--given how little work it requires, the flavor is extraordinary. I halved the recipe (which was easy) and it made enough for two servings, in my opinion. I served it with the crab cakes and chipotle sauce.

This was alright, i don't think i would make it again though. roasting the peppers didn't give them much extra flavor, but maybe i didn't do it right. the frozen corn was pretty flavorless as well. it was nice and spicy though, so that gave it a good strong flavor.

Yum-bo! Any foodie I have served this to has raved and I am grabbing this recipe for the third time to serve with a rubbed grilled steak recipe and roasted potatoes. Note re prep: the first time I made it, I oven roasted the peppers as directed. However, the end result did not accent the peppers enough to make me think the effort to roast was worth it, so the second time I used a jar of roasted peppers from Trader Joes(BTW--You can get everything except for the adobo peppers at TJ's making this an EXCELLENT last minute dish.) The end result was as delicious, making me a jarred roasted pepper user for this dish from then forward. Try it--you'll like it!

Everyone really liked this salad. I couldn't find the chipotle peppers, so I added some medium salsa to the dressing and marinated all the vegetables (except spinach) for a while. It was really good and the salad didn't wilt the way regular salads do by the time dinner is over. It was still fresh the next day, even with the dressing.

The dressing definitely needs more punch. I added 1 tsp. coriander and 1 tsp. salt and it helped tremendously. I also doubled the coriander and added it to the dressing. I roasted the red peppers and corn ahead of time and marinated them in the dressing with the green onions for several hours before tossing them with the spinach just before serving. This mellows the flavors and eliminates that "rawness" that a previous reader commented on. I made this for a progressive dinner that had a Mexican theme (I provided the soup and salad course)and served it with tortilla soup. It was really hit - and so easy to prepare.

Did not enjoy the dressing as written. It did not have enough flavor and husband commented that something was just plain wrong with it. Thawed 1/2 of a frozen bag of corn with red peppers and black beans to toss in. I liked the combo of the spinach and veggies. Served with Shrimp and Sweet Potato Cakes w/Chipolte Sauce from this site (delicious, try them!). Would make again but with a different dressing.

I love this salad - great combo. of ingredients and flavors - might try adding some crumbled bacon next time.

Wonderful salad!!! I'm so glad I found this recipe - it is such a great new approach to spinach. We loved the spiciness and the colors and textures, particularly because of the corn. I used 1 whole chipotle chile in adobo sauce and it made about 2 tsp (my grocery didn't have already chopped). Might be good with jalapeno too, but the chipotle was more flavorful. I used fewer onions and I roasted my corn as well as the peppers for a smokier taste. My over-60 relatives found it a bit too "hot", but the rest of us were thrilled with the bite that this dressing gives. Served with bbq'd flank steak. This is really versatile... it's a month after I wrote the above, and I just prepared this dressing with a pasta salad including corn, red & green bell peppers, and cilantro. Again, fabulous!

This is my new favorite summer salad - yum! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change anything. It would go great with grilled meats in the summer, or mexican/tex mex entrees.

Great flavor and interesting salad. I didn't roast the corn this time but will next. After whisking in the chiptles I let it sit for a while than strained them out. The dressing was flavorful but not too hot. With this method you can very the amount of "kick" you want. The salad is great with Southwestern entree's.

This is such a nice change from other salad standards. I couldn't find the canned chipotle so I had to improvise with some dried chilies and Crystal Hot Sauce. I didn't bother roasting my own peppers and used jarred instead. This is SO easy to make - and fast. Paired it with another recipe from epicurious "white chicken chili" . YUM!

I took one of the suggestions for the dressing, and I am glad I did, using honey. It definitely gave it more life than what it did without it because it tasted too plain. Next time I'm using olive oil, though. Regarding what another person said, if you used more than 1 1/2 tsp of chipotle, of course you got a mouthful of HOT! But I do like the idea of making the dressing creamy. I found the cilantro too strong, and I didn't even use the whole leaves in my salad. Next time, I will use less chopped and infuse it in the dressing. One mistake I did make was to wait until we served before I mixed the dressing and spinach because I didn't want it to be all wilty. I shouldn't have because the spinach seemed a little 'raw'. I served the salad with roast chicken and had leftovers the next day. Boy, was the chicken good in the wilty, dressing covered spinach!

Really great salad. I added grilled chicken to make it a meal but it would be great without. I also added a bit of honey to the dressing. Very colorful!

The salad had a wonderful flavor (especially with the roasted corn)BUT my version was very very HOT. I love hot things but this was almost too hot to enjoy it thoroughly - I'd suggest mixing in a little sour cream to the dressing to kill the heat...I'd try again if anyone has any other suggestions.

This was simple and delicious. I did dry-roast (very hot cast-iron skillet, no oil), the red bell pepper and then the fresh corn kernels) so it took a little more time, but WELL worth it for flavor.

Great recipe - definitely roast the corn which can be done with frozen corn in the skillet with olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste - the corn turns brown and acquires the smoky flavor which is delicious!

This is just excellent and so easy. Grilled chicken or shrimp makes this perfect for lunch. Try it...a real winner!

I roasted corn on the cob when I did the peppers and instead of using frozen corn and it was wonderful. A real hit with my guests!
