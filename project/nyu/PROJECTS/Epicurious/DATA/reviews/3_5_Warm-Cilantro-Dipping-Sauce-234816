This was great, but I only gave it 3 stars because i thought it needed a few of the suggested modifications. Once I added parmasean cheese as suggested by another reviewer it was delicious. I also cut the oil to 1/3 cup as suggested. Everyone LOVED this with the plantain chips.

This sauce is fantastic! Fresh garlic, lime, and cilantro create a wonderfully delicious and versatile sauce. I use this as a chimichurri with fajitas and carne asada. Soooooo good!

Fresh, OK, but not really enough OOMPH to take the plantains to a higher level.

Refreshing and gives the plantains and extra pep, made it for husband and sister who both like lighter food and they both want it again!

Not such a great accompaniment especially with the plantains. Will not make again.

This is a great and versitile sauce, but I agree with previous reviews - the recipe calls for way too much oil. Reduce your oil to 1/3 cup or 1/2 cup if you like it with more oil, but no more! (1/3 cup should do you!).

We did not care for this. The raw garlic was overpowering. It needs to be balanced out with other flavors but I'm not sure which.

Although we did alter the recipe - the base for this one is wonderful - we added parmesan cheese to the mix and decreased the amount of olive oil to 1/3 of a cup. We have used it on fresh steamed veggies, baked chicken wings and even used it cold for a salad dressing. Make extra - you will find yourself using it on everything.

Loved the flavors or this sauce. I used it for fish, not plantain chips. Would not use as much oil as called for next time--just did not need that much.

This is just one of those recipes you will use again and again, much like its Italian analog, the ubiquitous salsa verde. I made this cilantro sauce for a bar-b-que and it was the hit of the evening - I first served it with spit roasted pork, but have since eaten it with pan roasted fish, red beans and rice, and along with store-bought empanadas. My only advice is to double - even triple the recipe. Yum.
