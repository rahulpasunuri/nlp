I've made this dessert time in again: as a whole pie, as regular cupcake sized, and mini cupcake sized. It truly is worth the effort. Milk chocolate works great as a traditional s'mores flavor, but dark or bittersweet chocolate tastes wonderful as well. I once (for a very special occasion) made it with dark chocolate, went minimal on the marshmallow topping, and served with Jeni's Queen City Cuyenne Ice Cream. My favorite form is in the mini muffin size because you only need a small portion--they are very rich, and the small size is cleaner and easier to eat. I broiled the full cake the first time I made it, didn't watch close enough, and caught it on fire just like a marshmallow in a campfire! I was able scrape off the charred part pretty easily, make a new batch of topping and avoided ruining the whole cake. I've broiled the dessert successfully since then--but with oven door open and watching the whole time! Now I have a kitchen blowtorch... Thanks for an awesome recipe, I truly feel like a dessert expert every time I make and taste it!

Very rich but very good! I followed the recipe as printed and found that there was plenty of graham cracker mixture for the crust since you don't press it up the sides of the pan. Any more would have been too much, IMO. For presentation, I did break off irregular shaped pieces of graham crackers and place one upright in each serving.

I made this as mini cheesecakes it makes 24 muffin sized cheesecakes. I use milk or dark chocolate depending on what's on hand. I brown it under the broiler making sure to keep an eye on it. This is great for a gathering or potluck. Also since the portions are smaller you get the same great taste with less calories.

Amazing! I took it a potluck and everyone thought it was great. Great presentation. Worth the effort!

Does anyone know if it is possible to make this recipe *without* adding marshmallows into the topping? I would really like to make this recipe, but my mother is a vegetarian and will not eat anything with gelatin in it (and ordering vegan marshmallows are simply not worth it). Thanks!

Just made this for husband's bday. It was a hit. Used half semi sweet and half milk chocolate. I doubled the crust, because I love lots of graham cracker crust. This needs more crust, because the cake is so rich. The marshmallow topping needs to be beat for, like, 10-12 minutes (at four, the topping was drippy and flat!) I used a plain ole fire starter to torch the fluff--it worked fine.

I'll echo the helpful comments regarding making the graham cracker crust thicker so you get a truer s'mores ratio of cracker to chocolate to marshmallow..as well as using bittersweet chocolate. I was leary about making this in advance given that 7-minute frosting- esque toppings tend to get weepy overnight, but I'm guessing adding the actual marshmallows to the mix must have done the trick! We even toted this on a 4 hour car trip in a cooler and it held up beautifully!

This is a killer dessert!! Amazing!! I used 80% cocoa bars that had natural cocoa nibs ground into the bar. What a great texture it gave the cake. I have never seen these again to purchase them in a store but purchased some in Costa Rica (a bag of nibs...the ground hulls from the cocoa bean). They could probably be purchased online. The merigue is very messy to make but so worth the effort. If browning it in an oven make sure you stand right there...3 seconds can burn it!!

This is lethal. I made it for a group dinner tonight. Everyone raved and tried to come up with other uses for the topping. This is so rich, a 10" cake could serve 16. It has been requested for the 4th of July. I used bittersweet chocolate and it was smooth and divine, not too sweet.

This dessert is absolutely divine in the winter or summer! I agree with other reviewers in that this can be made with any kind of chocolate: milk, dark, bittersweet, etc. I recently made it with dark chocolate and served with a side of Queen City Cayenne (spicy dark chocolate) ice cream to replicate a spicy hot chocolate. This is great to do the bulk of of the work the night before, then finish the topping and serve the next day. Don't let the marshmallow topping intimidate you either. In a hurry I have not taken the time to swirl the topping, but still broiled for a few seconds on low for a toasted look and it still turned out great. Make sure to serve in small slices because (while delicious) this is very rich! For those who aren't afraid to put a little effort into a high quality homemade dessert, this is an absolute keeper!

Can you say "Epic Fail?" I made this for my annual Fourth of July neighborhood bake-off (where I usually win first or second place) This dessert tasted more like butterscotch pudding than a s'more. I was totally disappointed in this dessert...both in appearance and in taste. There are so many wonderful cheesecake recipes out there...don't waste your time or money on this flop.

Makes a lovely birthday cake. Impressive-looking & crowd-pleaser for all ages. Used semi-sweet Ghirardelli bars (my supermarket didn't have a high-quality brand of milk chocolate bars in baking aisle)--I think as long as it's high-quality, could use milk,semi-sweet,bittersweet,dark (or combo of these). Fresh strawberries were good served alongside this too. No need to change a thing really. Can hardly wait to make it again. Thank-you for the recipe, Rick Rodgers!

I used 72% dark chocolate (TJ's) and followed another reviewer's suggestion to simply cover the top with marshmallows and broil to brown them, in the interest of saving time (took it in for an office party this morning). The result looks great, and tastes great. However I think the dark chocolate probably makes the filling heavier, and I prefer a lighter fluffier textured cheesecake. Might try a mousse next time.

omg!!!this is off the hook. brought into work and everyone was raving, it is good enough that it could be served in a restaurant. i used all lindt milk choc, it was very sweet, maybe next time i will use 3/4 lindt milk and 1/4 dark. This is definitely a keeper!! fabulous!

Very good, very sweet! The office staff was loving it!!!!

I took the suggestions from some other users and used 70% Lindt chocolate instead of milk chocolate and was very pleased with the results. I agree with some others that milk chocolate might have been too sweet. The marshmallow topping was a little intimidating to make but I followed the directions and it came out really good, very light and not overly sweet. Well received and well worth the effort.

I would say I was a bit sceptical about this cheesecake. But it really is amazing. I followed the recipe to a T and came out perfect. Strangly it was better after being in the fridge for a couple days, and I even froze some and came back for the rest the same week!! YUMMMMM - I didn't thing the berries were an exceptional addition.

Yummy. I used Ghirardelli milk choc. There was too much of the marshmallow topping... would probably only need half the recipe, but that is certainly a personal preference.

After having made this cheesecake a few times, I've determined a few things: 1) I've increased the crust to come up the sides more and make it a bit thicker on the bottom. The way the recipe is written, there isn't much "graham flavor." 2) I like using a darker chocolate for the filling. The milk chocolate is too cloyingly sweet...my favorite? A Ghiradelli 60% cacao chips give a much richer, deeper chocolate flavor without being as sweet (believe me, this cheesecake doesn't need MORE sweetness!). Aside from that, the marshmallow topping is awesome and it's a huge hit with everyone I've ever served it to...

I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but this one is the exception to the rule. I made this for my daughters Bday, and so far I've had to make it for four of her friends who were at the party. The only problem is there's very little leftovers.

I loved this dessert and several people at the picnic said it was "off the hook!" And so pretty. My only problem was getting the crust off the bottom. I did butter it. Anyone have any suggestions? Oh, and next time I make it, I will probably do it over more than one day.

Rating: 4
Awesome! I don't really like marshmallows so I was leary but the topping was actually the best part. Let the topping sit for about two minutes before you try to swirl and pretty it up. It needs to start setting first. It ends up looking like melted little marshmallows nestled in hot cocoa - too cute! It's up there with my favorite cheesecakes now.

This is surely a crowd pleaser. Took some time to make but people kept coming back for more. The flavors and textures worked so well (as does a s'more). I give credit to whomever dreamt up with this dessert.

I agree with the cook from Charlotte - this dessert didn't live up to its hype. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy, but the topping and crust are overwhelming. I might skip the topping next time and make 2/3 or 3/4 the crust recipe...and definitely don't skip the tart berries.

Rating: 2
This is the first recipe on epicurious that didn't live up to its rave reviews. Yes, it was good. But by no means was it the best, most delicious dessert I've ever had. Everyone at our picnic liked it, but no one raved over it. I think the marshmallow topping, although good, overpowers the cheesecake. This recipe was not worth the effort, I'd rather have a plain cheesecake.

Just wanted to note that I was able to turn this cheesecake into cheesecake bars for easier serving at a large party. I made 1 and 2/3 of the crust (i.e. used 15 graham crackers, 5 tbs sugar, and 10 tbs butter) and pressed into a foil-lined 9 x 13 x 2 inch glass baking dish and followed the rest of the recipe as written, lifting the cake out of the pan and removing foil lining prior to frosting. Then I sliced into small triangles to look like mini slices of cheesecake :) I will caution that the final product is more sweet than rich, so if you're looking for a sophisticated cake, this may not be the right one for you. It is a great option for kids, though.

I made this for my Fourth of July party and it was a huge hit! In fact, my five year old daughter wants me to make it this week for her birthday party. Just one problem...I can not get the warm marshmallow topping to peak. It seems that when it is warm it is just melty and cannot form peaks. Advice Anyone??? It was still delish and nobody knew it was not perfect.

Absolutely delicious cheesecake. I made this for a Labor Day get-together and it was a huge hit with kids and adults. Carefully watch the topping if using the broiler to brown. I would say that it takes more like 45 seconds with the broiler set at medium and the rack positioned six inches from the broiler. The filling is fantastic -- smooth and chocolatey without being overly sweet. I used 6 ounces of milk chocolate (37% cacao) and 3 ounces of Valrhona 56% cacao.

WHAT!!! This cheesecake ROCKED! made it for a family get together and everyone loved it, how could you not. I'm really not much of a cheesecake fan but I decided to take a chance on this and it was well worth it. I frequently make marshmallows at home so that is what I used to mix in to the topping it was so ethereal and light, and it had this perfumy vanilla quality to it, lovely. The filling has just over half a pound of chocolate in it and it comes through so be sure to use high quality chocolate. I would say this recipe could feed easily more than 10 people as it is so rich I think I got at least 15 out of it. I would like to make it again and try semi-sweet chocolate as I preffer dark chocolate, oh I made this all in one day no overnight chilling and it was perfect.

Truly Scrumptious! We enjoyed this treat on the beach watching fireworks and as other reviewers have said, people were fighting over the last piece! Also as others have suggested, the recipe takes very kindly to "tweaks". I omitted the sugar in the crust, used good quality milk chocolate chips, extra cream cheese, half and half, and baked in a 10 inch springform. The marshmallow topping was fabulous. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is an amazing dessert! Raves from 20 people who ate it at a 4th of July picnic! Just make absolutely sure you make it the day before so it has time to truly cool and solidify. Dark chocolate is SO much better than milk chocolate and the added richness helps in serving smaller pieces and making the cake go further, if that is a concern. Add extra suger because dark chocolate is not as sweet. (dark chocolate is very good for you too!) To store it in the 'fridge I used a large mixing bowl to cover it as the meringue with marshmallows stays sticky. I used a knife dipped in hot water (shake it off) to slice it. I also added about 1/4 more of each ingredient to make a larger cake! For the fruit I cooked the raspberries and the blueberries down to thick sauces and people liked that option.

Watch for the browning of the marshmellow meringue. We did it underneath the broiler and it took only 20 seconds.

Wow was this terrific. Made for a 4th of July party - not a bite left! I did use dark chocolate and accidently left the vanilla out of the marshmallow meringue (oops!). It wasn't nearly as sweet as I thought it might be (maybe the dark chocolate?) I didn't put all of the topping onto the cake - probably used 3/4 and it was plenty. Do be careful when torching the topping, as it will burn quickly if you leave the flame in one spot too long. In that I always burn my marshmallows in a fire I liked it that way!

Made this for a baby shower and brought the house down. Used brown sugar in the crust instead of white, and bittersweet instead of milk chocolate in the filling. I thought the marshmallow meringue was simply perfect. I loved how gorgeously the whole thing came together when I ran the kitchen torch over the top. Served with the pomegranate raspberry sauce from the Orange Blossom Cheesecake recipe on here (halved the sauce recipe and used strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, no sugar). I'd call this one a triumph.

I just made this for our 4th of July pool party, and people were fighting over it. I made it into bars so it would be easier to eat at a bbq, and I realized after it was already in the oven that I totally forgot to put in the cream. I thought they would come out very dry, but it actually worked to my advantage because they turned out a little firmer and they held up wonderfully, even after sitting out for hours. It was all very sweet, so maybe next time I'll use bittersweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate. Otherwise, very good.

This was indeed a good cheesecake and a great s'more themed dessert. Next time I make it I will attempt to tweak the topping and crust. The topping was very sweet and seemed like to much (2 inches on top of cake). Maybe cut the recipe in half as well as the sugar. I also thought the crust had a tad bit too much butter. Also- I used dark chocolate because milk chocolate doesn't enter my home-haha.

This was my first cheesecake and though there were tons of steps to make this one it's definitely worth it! Rave reviews form my Sunday dinner club. I didn't have Cream of Tartar on hand and sub'd lemon juice (2 Tsp) and it worked fine. The Marshmellow didn't get quite to stiff peaks, soft, but still held up in the fridge and tasted great.

Made this for book club; every last bite went. Not too sweet, not too chocolately. Interesting making it in the food processor; doesn't take long at all to whip up. I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and they worked just fine. Also forgot the vanilla in the meringue and that was ok too. Lovely end to a summer meal.
