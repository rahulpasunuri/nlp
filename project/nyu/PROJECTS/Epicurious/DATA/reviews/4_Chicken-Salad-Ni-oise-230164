I loved this salad (agreed, not a traditional Nicoise, but who ever heard of a CHICKEN Nicoise, anyway?) And I did modify the dressing -- because there is way too much lemon and not enough mustard and olive oil -- so I just tinkered with it to make a nice, lemony dressing that was to my taste. Also, I suggest making at least 1/2 cup of dressing, so that the salad gets a sufficient coating when tossed. This would be a great and different buffet salad. To feed a crowd, use a whole rotisserie chicken from Costco and increase the amounts of vegetables and dressing accordingly.

Wondeful!! I added about 1/4 t Light Brown sugar to the dressing to offset some of the tartness. I couldn't find pitted nicose olives and may try the pitted Napa style kalmata olives for the next go. If you enjoyed this looke for the Provencal Salad found in the July 2007 Gourmet. Similar style.

Because this one is a little work I serve it to friends so it's worth the trouble. It' a favorite and leftovers are even better.

Yummy! A little bit of work to chop and cook everything, but the whole family loved it including the kids! Wow. Switched it up a bit to suit what I had on hand, used white wine vinegar and added a little extra olive oil as I found it a tiny bit tart. Served it as one big composed salad with the dressing on the side. With a bit of crusty baguette, a yummy, healthy supper!

It was a hit the very first time that I served it! I can't think of how I would change the recipe.

This was good--we liked it. We had some leftovers, and I saute-ed them up in a skillet. That worked just fine--all the ingredients are saute-able. We got two good meals out of this recipe.

Really tasty salad. I did substitute a few things. Didn't have red pepper, green beans or red onion, but julienned some celery, cooked sugar snap peas from the garden and grated some yellow onion (not too much.) Great dressing! Will make it again when our tomatoes ripen.

Great. Was looking for something to do with leftover chicken and happened to have the rest of the ingredients (including fresh basil) handy. Threw it all together in 15 minutes and was amazed at how great it tasted. This is a case of the whole being more than the sum of its parts. Teenagers loved it too. I would make this for guests. It's that good.

Wonderful, elegant cold supper and can all be done in advance. I like to group the beans, eggs, pepper slices, etc. as a composed salad around the chicken, instead of tossing it together, which is visually more dramatic. A bowl of vichysoisses first, and chilled white wine to accompany. Yum!

I will make this again and again. Steaming vegetables and grilling chicken in advance is a huge advantage. The dressing was lovely. I tried it with tofu for the veggie in the family and chicken with the rest. Very flavourful.
