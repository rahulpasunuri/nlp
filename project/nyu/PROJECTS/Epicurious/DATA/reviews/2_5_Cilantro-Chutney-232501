This recipe is completely bananas. Really, there is no cilantro in cilantro chutney? That's like making tomato sauce with nothing but babanas, or orange juice with with nothing but babanas. Seriously, no one looking at this recipe will make it owning to the fact that they have Cilantro, not scallions. cheers, Bord

I thought this was VERY good. I did make one change though, instead of sugar I added mango. Delicious.

Good grief -- fresh cilantro and fresh coriander are EXACTLY the same. As stated in Wikipedia, "Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. It is also known as cilantro, particularly in the Americas." The first time I bought cilantro was in an Indian grocery in Chicago in 1979 -- however the item was called "fresh coriander." Now that coriander/cilantro is available throughout the US, I have made similar chutneys to this one for 30 years and they're great.

Um, no cilantro in the cilantro chutney?

Every other cilantro chutney recipe suggests 1 small onion. It is also far too salty. 1/4 cup lime juice is sufficient.

Cilantro forgotten in the recipe... get over it, shit happens. Think about all the GREAT recipes that this website has given you.

Add the 2 cups firmly packed cilantro & it's wonderful - better than at some Indian restaurants. We prefer pureeing all but the cilantro & then adding the cilantro, blending to leave it a bit chunky vs. smooth.

I don't understand how can a make a cilantro chutney without the cilantro, or how do you write a recipe without the main ingredient.

In a hardcopy of aug. '05 Gourmet I checked the quantity of cilantro needed - 2 cups firmly packed fresh cilantro sprigs. Enjoy!

I can't believe they forgot to list the cilantro in this recipe. I'm almost tempted to add a bunch and see how it will come out. Also the rock shrimp recipe doesn't even show!! What's going on Epi??? LOL
