We have the original from BA, 2/90, and have made it 53 times over the years. We tried several others prior and none came close to this in taste and texture, esp. the great sauce. We have used round steak primarily because of the good beef flavor, but have used other beef, and chicken, and even pork. The original broccoli & mushrooms are great, but bok choy, and peppers are also good. It is our go to stir fry recipe.

This is a great basic beef & broccoli recipe. i usually don't care for so much cornstarch in my cooking, especially with broccoli florets- which do a great job of holding onto sauce all on their own, so i reduced the amount of corn starch, adjusted some other ingredients, and blogged about it here.. http://www.baker-maker.com/2012/02/workweek-lunchtovers-beef-broccoli-stir.html

I can't agree with all of the plaudits on this webpage. This recipe didn't work for us, and I followed it exactly. The mushrooms yielded a ton of liquid, and the broccoli was undercooked. The sauce tasted of cornstarch. Plus, it made a LOT of food, much more than I would serve to just four people.

I wanted to make this recipe gluten-free and oyster sauce has wheat in it. I substituted 1 tablespoon clam sauce for the oyster sauce and it came out great.

I have the original recipe from Bon Appetit from February 1990 which makes 2 servings. If you double the marinade ingredients from that recipe, you would use 3 tablespoons water, 2 tablespoons cornstarch (equal to 6 teaspoons), 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. So the 7 tablespoons vegetable oil listed in the recipe is just a simple mistake. I made it following the original proportions except I left out the oil altogether because it is not necessary.

Just made this one. Read the other reviews and read the recipe. Not sure what kind of people couldn't follow this but the internet is open to everyone. So read the recipe and follow it and you shoudln't have any problem. I did add baby carrots and only used 2TBSP of oil for the meat. There is no need for any more. I also added about 2 TBSP more of sugar and crushed red pepper to bring out some more flavor. I think this made the sauce much more authentic. This dish is pretty easy to make and definitely better than take out.

Quite Tasty!

this was okay- i used tofu (as suggested in the variation) and that was good. i felt it was easy to do and fairly healthful. i wondered about the amount of cornstarch, though. i don't do much chinese cooking, and i know that cornstarch is a integral part of the sauce-making, but this just seemed like a lot. tasted like a lot, too. i would make this again, but i would use less cornstarch and more seasoning. i did use some garlic this time, but i would add more. maybe some scallion, maybe some mirin. all in all though, worth a try.

This was not a difficult recipe to make. Normally I like to be very organized when I make a new recipe but was rushed. Even with that, i had no problems. I used Sake for the white wine and used a low salt beef broth. Also added water chestnuts. Next time i will add some onion & garlic for a little more spice and cut back on the oil.

This is a good week night meal. I substituted carrots for the mushrooms because my husband's not crazy about mushrooms. Used probaby less than half of the oil the receipe called for and it was very tasty. As the others, I may consider adding some onion or garlic next time. Good with Jasmine rice.

This is a delicious recipe that I actually would give 3 1/2 stars. We used a good London Broil cut, which was cheaper than flank steak and came out very tender. The recipe calls for way too much oil - you can get by on quite a bit less. The recipe was simple to make (my 14 year old son made it with just a little guidance on "What's oyster sauce?"!), and the only modification he made was to add a little more soy sauce at the end. He likes food salty, so it probably is fine for most people.

What is the problem with all these people that they don't understand this recipe and find it poorly written? To me it's perfectly clear and understandable. Okay, it says 1/4 white wine, meaning of course a quarter cup, not a bottle. I've made it and I found it excellent. There was enough sauce, and it tasted great. Just try it.

My sister-in-law made this last night and I tried it cold. It was so good cold that I had to make it today. She did have a mixup with the sauces as well since the recipe doesn't state that the first group of ingredients will be used for the marinade and then the sauce later. Hers came out very flavorfull and the beef tasted almost breaded because she used all of the sauce ingredients together and stirfried them together. Mine came out good but because the meat didn't marinade in as much of a mixture the flavor was a little weaker. I'll add some garlic, red pepper flakes and maybe some onion next time. It did cook up fast, though. Slicing the meat took the longest time out of everything (besides the marinading 30 minutes.)I could see pulling this together on a weeknight. A keeper for ease and versatility.

I have made this dish several times with pork and chicken and it is better than steak. Since it is only my husband and I I half the meat, broccoli, mushrooms but keep the sauce the same. Very good meal during the week.

Cooks Beware! This recipe is so poorly written that the guesswork you're required to utilize can ruin it and waste your $. I was confused by its conflicting "fork" ratings but decided to go for it since I am not a novice in the kitchen. It was a disaster. If you're bold enough to try it, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND THEN READ THEM AGAIN!! And thank God I wasn't making it for company. A deft hand, which I think I possess, is essential (but it didn't save me). I love this website, but this is a recipe that should be subject to recall, be rewritten, and perhaps posted again once the ambiguities are cleared up. Good luck to those who want to take this risk.

I made this recipe with all the suggested improvements (onion, garlic, beef broth) but it wasn't great, just "OK". Everyone ate it without complaint, but the flavor was lacking. My husband and I ended up adding various asian sauces to ours to give it some punch. It's a healthy stir fry dish with lots of veg. but not much else.

This recipe is horrible. The food is good, however the recipe is terribly written. It is unclear, and hard to follow. It doesn't even tell you how much white wine to use. It just says 1/4. 1/4 of what? Who can differentiate between sauce broth and marinate prior to cooking. i.e. 2 liquid portions had broth and 2 had soy. I enjoy Beef with Broccoli but will not follow this recipe again. I will look elsewhere. I find it hard to believe that this was published originally in this format.

I don't find the recipe confusing. I read it through once before making it and was fine. I've made it twice now and my family loved it, including my 5 year old. The sauce is great and marinating the steak makes it nice and tender. One of my favorite dinners to make.

Absolutely a do-over at my house. This meal was easy and much better than any authentic take-out around. Loved it.

Others liked it so maybe its me but I found it bland. I added 4 cloves of garlic, a shallot and some onion. It just needed something. I guess I thought it would have a taste (sweetish/sour?) that would super-charge the ginger root but it didn't... The chicken was good though, just the dish as a whole didnt grab me.

Wow, what a confusing recipe for stir fry. It doesn't note early that the coating sauce for the meat was "divided use". I felt like I had to reread the recipe at each step which slows down the stir fry process. I will make it again, but not on a night with hungry kids asking when dinner is ready. If I'd been more careful with the recipe, mine would not have been so salty and the flavors would have worked. I used chicken & snow peas instead of beef & broccoli, and it worked fine.

This is a great recipe. I made the following changes, 1 medium onion, cut in wedges, 4 cloves garlic and used beef broth instead of chicken. My husband finished the leftovers and asked when I would be making it again. Needless to say, I will be making it again very soon!!

This recipe was the closest thing Chinese take out I've ever made - and I mean that in the best possible way. This was flavorful and filling. I skipped the oil for the actual stir frying - just spray a non-stick pan once with spray oil. Saved about 4T of oil and it still tasted great.

Good, not spectacular, but satisfying and easy to prepare. I used chicken breast, which is an easy sub. As my mom has taught me, the Chinese chef's trick is to marinate the meat with cornstarch, so I added roughly 2 tsp to the marinade, which made the meat especially tender. Also cooked with more veggies like onions, mushrooms, red bell pepper and carrots. Nice, wholesome meal to feed a hungry college kid.

My husband and I just love this dish. I plan on making it for some guests we'll be having next week. Im not really much of a ginger person so I substituted 2-3 cloves of garlic in place of the ginger. Delicious!!!!

Well, it wasn't as quick as take-out but it certainly was as good! Better since you can control the ingredients. I used half the oil recommended and made it with extra-firm tofu. Convenience items like fresh minced ginger from the jar and a bag of shredded carrots instead of the mushrooms made it an easy-to-make weeknight meal.

Very good. The whole family liked it. I used much less oil with a non-stick pan. I will make this again.

This was a great recipe, but way too time consuming and complicated for me to deal with. Too much oil in my opinion.... although, it did not taste greasy. If it were not so complicated, etc., I would make it again.

I had to use tofu and some ground pork since my *@#& beef was bad....it was ok, but it probably would've been great with the beef. I'll try it again with beef and get back to you.

This is a very delicious and relatively easy dish. My boyfriend and I made the meal together which helped speed things along. If you're using a non-stick wok, I would recommend using less oil than the recipe calls for. The ginger and oyster sauce give a wonderful flavor overall. I plan on making this the next time I have guests for dinner. ***If you save this to your recipe box, it will save the title as "Cod with Wax Beans", but when you open it, it's the right recipe.

I found this recipe difficult to follow (lots of sauces going on). I made it on a weeknight after work and it seemed to take longer than a stir fry should. (Funny that it came from "Every Night Cooking!") The taste was almost there. I added red pepper flakes for a kick, but I've made better stir fries.
