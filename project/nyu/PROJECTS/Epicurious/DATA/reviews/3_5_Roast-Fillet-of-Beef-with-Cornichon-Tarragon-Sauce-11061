I've served this recipe (along with the entire menu) time and again and everyone who has ever tried it loves it. We even had a local chef over for dinner one evening and he liked it so much he thought he might use it on a special menu at the restaurant! This will always be one of our "special occasion" menu selections.

Simple to prepare and simply delicious. As with all good quality beef, I cooked this rare. The green, finely julienned cornichons looked superb on the plate when contrasted against the vivid red of the meat. I served this with thin slices of beef fanned out across one half of the plate, dressed with the sauce, accompanied by cubed potatoes deep fried in extra virgin olive oil. The visual presentation combined with the mixture of flavours and textures (velvet beef, crispy potatoes, silken sauce and crunchy cornichons) make this a great dinner party candidate - especially given how simple, and quick it is to prepare.

When I was putting the sauce together, I seriously considered not adding the cornichons as I was making this dish for a Mother's Day get together, and I was concerned it was too weird. I went ahead anyway. While several people liked it, most stated they would prefer one of the many other sauces I normally serve with beef tenderloin. I thought the sauce without the cornichons was okay. With the cornichons, it was too sour.

We made this as our main "event" of our Parisian Christmas Eve dinner - with excellent results! Roasting @ 550 was a "smokey" affair (turning the oven down to 450 after the 1st 5 minutes probably would have been better) - but great results and tastes nonetheless.

I have been looking for something simular to this receipt for years. We had it in a resturant in France served with fries. I omited the Cornichon .Just wonderful

I will make this again, but next time I will definately place all ingredients in a food processor as a final step. It seemed strange to have cornichons on top of a roast fillet. It would be much better if your guests thought the sauce was delicious, but didn't exactly have the ingredients staring them in the face. There's something about pickles on beef that just doesn't work visually. It was very tasty though!

Disappointing. This sauce never thickened, even though I reduced the cream and the wine to the correct amounts. The flavor of the tarragon was boiled away. The only to flavors I tasted were mustard and wine.

I also made this recipe when it was first published and it has been a favorite for special occasions. Delicious!

This has been a family tradition for New Year's Eve since the recipe was first published. The sauce is excellent (I usually make the full amount even when preparing only one tenderloin)! This is a wonderful dish for special occasions and celebrations. I highly recommend it.

I made this dish when the recipe was first published. It has always been one of my favorites. I would make it more often if it weren't for the fact that it's a "heart attack on a plate." All things in moderation.
