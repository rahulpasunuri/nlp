Easy to make, and you probably have most of the ingredients on hand already. The curd will definitely take longer to achieve thickness than the suggested cooking time. If ease is more important to you than food snobbery -- it is just a lemon tart after all -- canned whipped creme is a lot faster than piping rosettes.

This tart was a disappointment. The crust was too crisp (and I did not overbake it) for the soft lemon curd which did not hold the weight of the strawberries when the tart was sliced. It was a strange combination of textures. The taste of the lemon curd was good and paired well with fresh strawberries, however, if there's a next time, I would skip the crust altogether and layer the curd, strawberries and whipped cream in a parfait glass and call it a day. There are better tart recipes than this one.

Just a couple of notes. First off, if you make this definitely double the curd. It's worth the effort although it took double the amount of time to bubble up and set. I made the crust in the morning but pressed it into a 10" tart pie. I did halve some of the strawberries as they don't come small in my neck of the woods. I finished with a simple syrup with a dash of port to give it a differnet note and then fresh slightly sweetened whipped cream but something was clearly not that great about this dessert. I can't put my finger on it but the crust didn't taste like anything which is weird as I followed it to the letter. The strawberry and lemon flavors together didn't really work for some reason. I bought my strawberries from a farmer so it wasn't the tasteless store bought kind, but something was missing in this dessert and until I figure out what, I won't make it again.

this recipe is a classic. I've been making it since 2000 (so, 11 years at this point), in many variations (big tarts, small tarts, crusts with lavendar, curd topped with crushed thyme instead of strawberries, etc. etc.) It's been years since I've made this crust recipe, but this is my go-to lemon curd. A Welsh friend of mine once exclaimed that it was better than his own mother's lemon curd, so there you have it.

Have made this several times for dinner parties. Always a showstopper. Also doubled the curd recipe.

This is a great recipe. I made 6 mini tarts with this recipe. I doubled the lemon curd and drizzled the strawberries with a simple syrup. Yum!

This was very easy and had a nice presentation. The flavor was simple and light, excellent after a heavier meal. My shortbread crust was a little too solid and made cutting difficult. Overall was good but not my favorite tart on this site.

I made this for relatives who raved about it. It was pretty easy and I would do it again.

Excellent. I substituted 3 T. granulated sugar for the 6 T. of confectioners. Be sure to chill the dough thoroughly before rolling. I also rolled btwn 2 sheets of waxed paper and used a 10" porcelain tart pan (easier than transferring to cookie sheet). I liked the do-ahead aspect of the tart -- I did the shell and lemon curd in the afternoon, then assembled the tart when we got home from dinner.

This is my favourite, all time dessert recipe. Whenever my husband asks me what I want for a special dessert (he's the cook) This is it. You have got to try it!

After living in Europe for 10 years I am a big fan of tarts as opposed to heavier American pies. This recipe, particularly the crust, is easy to make and was a definite hit with my family. Next time I'll choose another lemon curd recipe. This one was too buttery and too loose, allowing the strawberries to fall over once cut into slices.

This is a fabulous dessert! I put the crust in a tart pan with removable bottom, doubled the Lemon Curd, and made a little simple syrup as recommended by previous reviewers. With our local strawberries from farmers market, it was to-die-for. The guys had seconds, so it was all gone! The crust was fabulous as well.

This tart was great. I sliced the strawberries instead of just cutting the top off. I won't do that again. They released a lot of juice and there was some runny liquid on top instead of a pretty glossy tart. I would use more lemon curd as well...maybe double that part of the recipe.

Great Recipe! Easy and quick. I made into a heart shape for Valentine's Day and it was wonderful! I doubled the lemon curd, as recommended by other reviewers, but I feel it was too much -- maybe 1.5 times would be better. I also used more strawberries than called for. Would definitely recommend, especially when you need something really good that looks great in a hurry. (Total prep time was probably under 1 hour, though have to wait while dough chills, tart shell cools.)

Fantastic tart!! I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the lemon curd. I took it to a bbq and it was gone in less than ten minutes. its perfect for any summer get together.

The fact that they first put the filling in the recipe really threw me off. I bake a lot, I'm so used to the pastry being listed first THEN the filling. I goofed and only used 5T of butter in my crust. It does seem as though it turned out well enough without the added butter. I substituted heavy whipping cream for the sour cream. At any rate, I used meyer lemon juice and used a zester tool for the lemon rind (long thin strands). I didn't want residual lemon bits in my curd, so this helped to effectively strain out the rind rather well. The curd is delicious! I made my tart in a 9" tart pan, ungreased, and baked as directed. I topped mine with fresh strawberries, blackberries, sliced kiwi, black cherries, and sliced apricots. I glazed the fruit with a simple syrup. I will definitely make this recipe again and again! Wow!

This was good but next time I will not use strawberries. Unless you can get them at the exact peak of season, they just don't have enough flavor to stand up to the lemon. That and they get weepy, even though I assembled only 1.5 hours before serving. I will use raspberries or blueberries next time. I also used a tart pan with a removeable bottom, made for a prettier presentation. Doubling the curd is a must. I also added a splash of lemon extract to the curd as I could not find Myer lemons, and regular ones just don't have the same flavor.

I made this recipe yesterday and all in all it came out very well. I used individual tartlet pans, and had enough dough for 8 tarts. Unfortunately, I did NOT listen to others and so I did not double the lemon curd portion of the recipe so my tarts had a minimal amount of the curd. Next time I will double the curd. Placed thinly sliced strawberries in a concentric circle along the edge and a nice dollop of whipped cream in the middle. LOOKED GREAT and tasted great.

This was delicious ! To save time I used the frozen pastry shells. Everyone loved them. would make again!

Delicious! I also doubled the lemon curd..I really needed all of it. I made the tart 4 hours ahead of my luncheon, and found that the strawberries ran into the lemon curd and that it was somewhat runny in consistancy. I'll work on that next time I make it.

Yummy! I took the advice and doubled the curd, which I thought was the best part. I was short on lemon juice, so I used half key lime juice, which gave it a great zing! The only down side to this dish was it's short shelf life. I will make it again for a larger gathering, so it all gets eaten right away! I disagree with the reviewer who said the crust was tough. I thought it was fantastic. This was the first time I used my food processor for crust. It worked great and was lightning fast!

Yummy, fresh lemony taste! I filled individual tartlet shells with the lemon curd (topped with whipped cream and a single blueberry) and served it for with afternoon tea. Everyone loved the tarts. Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good. The lemon filling was the best!! I did find the crust a bit dry and tough, though. I could tell when I was rolling the dough...it kept cracking. A better recipe is the "Lemon Tart: or a French Lemon Tart recipe if you can find it. The strawberries add a nice touch.

I made this for dessert at our Easter dinner. Everyone loved it... it was a little too tart for me, though. I also doubled the curd but not sure if I needed to. Next time, I will make it by the recipe (w/out doubling the curd)... I'll definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe for one party, and it worked so well, I did it the very next day! Like others, I made a double recipe of the curd. I did a couple of changes the second day. I put it in a 10" tart pan because the edges of the crust fell down. I reduced the amount of sugar in the lemon curd because I like it really tart. My husband, however, thought it was fine the first day, and he's more middle-of-the road. But what really makes a nice compliment was some creme fraiche served atop. Everyone thought that was the best touch.

This recipe is amazing. I made it again and this time I created a glaze for the strawberries. I made a simple syrup (1/2 cup each sugar & water) and simmered it with a split vanilla bean. I glazed the berries and used the left over syrup instead of sugar in the cream. WOW! Delicious.

Fantastic dessert: easy to make and it presents well. Doubling the lemon curd is key. A strawberry border with one strawberry in the center looks fabulous. And no need for whipped cream.

This is to die for! I've made it 3 times and woo the crowds! I slice the strawberries and arrange them on top in a pattern and top with whip cream in the center. Garnish with mint and whole strawberry! Awesome!!!

A wonderful addition to my Easter dinner party. My guests oooh'd and ahhh'd when it was first presented. Everyone proclaimed it wonderful. I did make a few adjustments: I doubled the lemon curd. I used a larger tart pan...one recipe of curd just didn't look to be enough. Also I added an apricot glaze. It gave it the fruit a nicer presentation.

This lemon curd is the best I have ever tasted. In fact, I had to make two batches because we ate the first straight from the bowl before I could make the tart...

I make this recipe whenever I can, I have even passsed it on to a radio cooking show, the host of which has adapted it to individual tartlets which is how I will make it this year as an alternative to the traditional Christmas pudding. I have never had anyone turn this down when offered.
