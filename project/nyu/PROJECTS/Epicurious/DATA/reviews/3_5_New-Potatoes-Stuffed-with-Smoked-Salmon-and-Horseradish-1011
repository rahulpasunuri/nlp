I had this at a friend's home last night and I LOVED this dish. I am a little finicky about smoked salmon, but I thought that the creamy roasted potatoes were a perfect vehicle. Horseradish in my book, is always a winner, and the capers added just the right acidity. This is a very elegent appetizer, that is now in my recipe box, and I'll look forward to making it.

I had some left over salmon and potatoes so I used this recipe. I didn't have baby potatoes, I had large potatoes. But it needed more flavor added to it. I did add more horseradish trying to make it better, but it still needs something more.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I am continually seeking new appetizers for my personal chef business that are easy and have the "wow" factor. This one certainly meets these criteria, and will be added to my permanent repetoire.

I will not be making this again. It was actually really gross... we only tried one each and the rest sat on the plate. Needs more horseradish, more sour cream, less salmon. I will try it again substituting bacon for the salmon, I think that will hit our palates better!

This is a relatively easy and wonderful appetizer! I loved the combination and will make it again in the future. Our guests loved them too, and they didn't last long.

We just moved to AK and have lots of smoked salmon on hand. Decided to try some ideas for Thanksgiving appetizers and found this recipe to be easy and yummy. We ate them warm the first time we made them and chilled them the 2nd time. Both ways were fantastic

Made this for NY Eve way back in 1995 but recognized the recipe just now because it was such a hit then that it made to my "real" recipe box.

I just got a request to make this again for my cousin's annual Danish Glogg Cheer. Been making this since it was published in 1995. I don't change a thing just double the recipe to keep up with the demand! My 4 & 6 yr old helped me fill the potatoes last year & can't wait to help again. Great, great, great!

I served this appetizer at Christmas time, it looked very festive and it was a big hit. Remove from the fridge 1/2 hour before for maximum flavour, and I garnished each one with a dill sprig. Will definetly make it again.

This recipe has been requested by my guests each and every time I serve it. They all love it.

I think this would be served better at room temperature than chilled. If I make it again I'll spice up the mixture a bit more and definitely double the recipe. I only got 18 pieces out of it. I might even add a bit of softened cream cheese and tabasco...maybe.

I made this because someone in the house has bought smoked salmon and we felt we needed to use it although no one in the household really likes it. I made the recipe verbatum and it was easy to make, however, the presentation was not colorful, and the capers were overpowering. Maybe it was the brand of smoked salmon that we used, but it resembled more like tunafish and was too "fishy" tasting for most of the guests. These were barely touched and i had to throw out the rest. Judging by the other reviews, i think this dish could be very good, i just presented it to the wrong audience...

Made this for Thanksgiving, while we all thought it was good, it was better once we heated it up and served it warm!

I made these for a holiday party. Thought it would be a nice, simple, but elegant, addition. They were not well-received overall.

I disagree on the women only fare. I've made this for two different holiday parties, and it was well received by all there. Simple, elegant, easy to eat without spilling on yourself. My kind of ap!

I altered this recipe a bit by using smoked trout instead of salmon and slicing the potatoes thinly; creating more of a canape. Went over well at the cocktail party I attended.

Great recipe, especially since good fresh smokes salmon is available locally. Have served it at several parties and it has been popular. Also adapts easily to low fat/heart healthy preparation.

Made this hors d'oeuvre for a dinner party. I think it was a little too dainty for the men. I would make it for women only next time.
