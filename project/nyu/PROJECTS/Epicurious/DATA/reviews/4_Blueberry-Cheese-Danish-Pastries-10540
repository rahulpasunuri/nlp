This recipe is fantastic. The dough is so easy to work with and is very forgiving. The first time I made this recipe I used cherry jam in addition to the cream cheese filling and I made a braided danish instead of individual pastries. It turned out beautifully!

It wasn't until I tried this recipe that I finally made a good Danish pastry. The dough is wonderful and so easy to work with. I do handle the butter layer a little differently, however. I do not add flour to the butter because I just don't think it is necessary. I also soften the butter as needed to the point that it is malleable but still cold to the touch. I then spread 1/2 stick softened butter over 2/3 of dough as suggested by a previous reviewer. It works like a charm and is so very, very easy. Now that I am no longer intimidated by Danish pastry, I look forward to making it often!

Am I crazy? These are blueberry cheese Danish and I see no blueberries in the ingredients list.

Not meant to insult the recipe, but.... I have been baking traditional Danish Pastry for approximately 50 years and this recipe, although fine, is NOT representative of what Danish Pastry is. I was taught by my father, who was a traditional Danish baker we are from Denmark and had bakeries both there and in the US. Maybe they shoulde be called Blueberry cheese pastries and please omit the Danish. Thank you.

I used to make Danish at a small bakery and wished I had the recipe for the Danish we made there. This is not quite that recipe, but somewhat close. I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, but do the layers of butter differently. I rolled out a large rectangle with the dough, cover 2/3 of the dough with 1/4 cup softened butter (no flour), fold the unbuttered section over the middle third of the dough, then fold the remaining section on top. I let that chill for at least an hour, then repeat the process 5 more times. I use twisted coils for the shape. I have used the cream cheese portion of the filling, and it's very good. I did cream cheese and apricot halves, and today used almond paste and tart cherries for the filling. The icing is also good, but I use less powdered sugar. Nice recipe. Lots of work, but everyone loves you for making these.

This is a really nice recipe. It inspires me. I thought about the last post (mine) and decided that it is possible to roll out the finished dough as specified (8"x16", trimmed) then to cut it in half to make two 8" squares, put on cinnamon sugar, nuts, raisins then roll each piece like a jellyroll, wrap & chill them, then slice each into eight slices....that way you get 16 pastries..in addition, after you have put them onto baking sheets, you could indent each with the back of a soupspoon, place a spoonful of cheese / blueberry filling into the indentation, then let rise and bake them ....( I would omit the raisins and nuts) xxx

this is a really nice recipe . the only things I question are the amount of yeast (maybe use just one pack) and I also prefer to use no flour in the butter, and to roll the dough to a dimension so you can brush or lay onto 2/3 of the length only 1/6 of the butter allowance, softened, (in this case it would be 1/4 cup), being careful to leave a small border to pinch the dough shut, then fold it like a letter, pinching after the first fold, then pinch the final end shut on all three sides, roll out to the original dimension, repeat with a second 1/6 of the butter and then chill it...repeat procedure twice... that way the butter is more evenly distributed and the finished result does not have some buttery layers and some not so buttery, with an uneven rise......in addition, it is important when removing a yeast dough from the refrigerator, to allow it to warm up a little before you try to work with it or it will spring back to its refrigerated shape when you try to shape it or roll it, and cut it....not warm, but just enough to work with it ....... I think I will use some of the dough to make cinnamon danish... roll out the dough, fill it with cinnamon sugar and chopped raisins soaked in hot water & brandy or rum (then dried on paper towels), then roll it like a log, refrigerate until quite firm and slice it with a serrated knife about 1 1/4" thick, put slices on their sides onto parchment-lined baking sheets, let rise a little, brush with a cinnamon sugar egg wash ...I thnk that will work out well

this was a great recipe and a fabulous dough. I made 1/2 into danish and used a specialty jam as others suggested. 1/4 of the remaining dough I cut into long strips, twisted into sweet breadsticks, then raised and baked them. Quite yummy!! The last part of the dough (and these were the BEST) I cut into wider strips and sprinkled with a nice mixture of cinnamon and sugar, rolled them up, let them raise a little longer and baked them. FABULOUS!!!! I did as another and just put all the butter on the dough without mixing it with the flour. Very good idea. I will make these again, but probably as cinnamon rolls as I did with the last portion of dough.

These weren't as much work as I thought they would be, just time consuming with all the chilling in between the rolling. I also found the blueberries just dropped in the cream cheese was unspectacular. Also the cirtrus in the cream cheese was too overpowering for the blueberries. The second time I used only a teaspoon of orange rind and fresh strawberries instead of blueberries - turned out way better. I am going to try a cinnamon cream cheese with apple slices for Thanksgiving.

I've read the ingredient list several times but still don't see blueberries anywhere. ??? They're mentioned in the directions, but how much? Fresh? Frozen?

I made these for Christmas morning last year with blackberries instead of blueberries and they were so good, I am still imagining them months later. Everyone loved them, and I'm from a family of not easily impressed experienced bakers. They looked beautiful, tasted amazing and were easy to make using the directions. My grandmother adored them so much that she hid one in the freezer b/c she was so worried my family would eat them all. They did.

I only make this once a year for Easter. The bluberry/cheese is good, but I also use purchased lemon curd and will make apple/ raisin filling too. I also use 3/4 tsp cardamon in my dough.

I received this same recipe from a friend 10 years ago and while this is alot of work, it has become a Christmas breakfast tradition at our house. I usually make the dough up the weekend before Christmas and leave it in the frig until 2 days before when I assemble and bake. I have used High quality Apricot and Cherry Jam with the cheese as well. I also Cut my dough into 4ths and work with small pieces that I roll to about 1/4 inch ..(This is the hardest Part) Makes twice as many, just as good and I have some to parcel out to family as gifts.

Most danish recipes use the "rough puff paste" method instead of creating a true -- and authentic -- laminate dough, as in this very nice recipe. I think it's worth the trouble, myself. Actually, this recipe omits any kneading of the dough, so it is faster than many. Doing a braid looks spectacular and is faster than individual shapes.

I prefer using only one envelope of yeast, which is plenty. Also, I have found it unnecessary to do the butter/flour-rolling the way described in this recipe, which is so time-consuming and messy. I simply use slightly softened butter. I tried both ways and work equally well.

This is a truly great recipe, but the time it takes to make...! The butter started coming through on my layers, but it still came out really good. Beating the butter with a rolling pin was a pain in the @$$. In fact, the worst part for me! The rolling isn't too bad-you just have to trust that it will eventually get to the specified size.I used the half of the dough and made a Danish braid and it came out really nice, too! I will make this again-the simplest danish recipe(believe it or not) I could find.

This recipe is great!! What I really appreciate about this recipe is that even though it is very specific about each step, if you don't get everything perfect it doesn't ruin the finished product. My family absolutely loved them!

Super yummy, but awfully time consuming. I didn't leave myself enough time on my days off to finish it, and ended up having to complete these over the next several days. My co-workers all loved them and I did too, but I doubt I'll make them again. I did make the blueberry sauce a previous reviewer recommended with Grand Marnier and it added a lovely touch to the final result. Probably the kind of thing you make once in a lifetime so that you can tell your grandkids that yes, you had once made Danish pastry from scratch!

The work was worth it totally! We made this for a class project and ended up making two batches because we loved it so much. Make this if you have time for it is a scrumpious snack, dessert, breakfast, or whenever. We love it!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe, and made it several times over the course of a weekend. I experimented with the filling, though, as I thought the blueberries just dropped into the cheese filling was a little bald. Fresh blueberries simmered briefly with a little sugar, Grand Marnier and arrowroot made a perfect contrast to the cheese filling. The pastry can be baked in different shapes also--try rolling in out, cutting strips about 1" by 8", twisting them and coiling into an "S" shape. You can then thumbpring the two curves of the "S" and put a dollop of opposing fillings in the centers. Bake as directed and watch them disappear....

These are too much work, no matter how good they end up tasting. Rolling,turning,folding,refrigerating, WHEW!! what a pain in the @$$!! I'm wouldn't waste time on these again.

Very yummy. Take a lot of time, but much of it is "down time" - just waiting between rolling, etc. Dough snapped back when I cut it into 4x4, and I needed to reroll each danish piece before putting the filling in to be able to fold them properly.

These are a lot of work, by the end I was tired and grouchy. But then I tried one. Wow! They are worth the effort.

Might try and make it if someone can tell me the quantity of blueberries needed. Not listed in the list of ingredients.
