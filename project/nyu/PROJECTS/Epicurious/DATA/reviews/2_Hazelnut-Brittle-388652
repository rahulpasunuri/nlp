I think something might be off too. It was much too thick to pour. It never turned amber, just got thicker and thicker.

I'm pretty sure the proportions here are wrong. I followed the recipe and after adding the sugar to the melted butter checked and rechecked the recipe to see if I had misread it. Way too much butter -- the fat just separated from the sugar and I ended up with a mass of cooked sugar in grease.
