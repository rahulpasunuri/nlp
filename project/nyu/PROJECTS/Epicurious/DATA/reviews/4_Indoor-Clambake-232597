Have done this three summers in a row to rave reviews. The presentation is fun (cheesecloth evokes fishermen nets), and this is a lot easier than boiling lobsters and trying to prepare sides separately (less risk of splashing / spilling boiling water on yourself) and the egg makes a great timer. I substituted sliced zucchini & summer squash in lieu of potatoes, which did not have to be boiled ahead, and it turned out great.

Love the egg idea- it works so well. and the recipe is very easy to do. I didn't have rockweed either, so instead I lined the bottom of my pot with- bamboo leaves! The added flavor was subtle- I think the linguica added more personality to the pot.

this was a simple, straightfoward recipe for a clam bake. we didn't use the rockweed, just a steamer basket. also, i poured a beer in the steaming water. using the egg to tell if the lobsters were done is a great tip! will definitely make this again this summer.
