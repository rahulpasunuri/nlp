This tart is excellent. I have made it several times and guest rave about it. It is simple and elegant desert and easy to make when in a hurry.

the crust was interesting but overall it was not very good. I can see why the chef serves it with ice cream, without that it's just pears in simple syrup. Check out the carmelized upside-down pear tart also on this website, it's a much better recipe.
