There is something that doesn't always work out when using a jerk marinade and pork. The two just do not bring each other out. Jerk with chicken is a great combination, so it surprised me that this turned out so bland.

This recipe was a big disappointment. Oddly, the paste smells good both when you're preparing it and while it's cooking, but there is nothing authentic about the taste. The citrus overwhelmingly overpowers all the other ingredients in the paste. It was all I could taste.

I slow cooked a pork butt until it was tender enough to shred. I added the meat to cheese quesadillas. My friends went crazy for it. I made a different jerk recipe on chicken that was tasty but everyone remembers the quesadillas! The coffee beans made all the difference. Make sure you grind them very fine though. It wasn't fun biting into a chunck of coffee bean.

This recipe was a massive disappointment. The article was great, conjuring up the image of a lazy vacation in Jamaica. Unfortunately, this recipe does not deliver on the promise. Followed precisely, it is bland, a bit sour with no visual appeal. It completely misses the zesty, spicy soulful experience that is great jerk cooking. Who "bakes" a pork tenderloin? It yields a palid, pale looking result with no crust. I tried rescuing one of the tenderloins by searing it on the grill, but it was still left with no flavor. I'd be surprised to find the author actually made this dish. Sounds good on paper, big disappointment on a plate.

This recipe was so incredibly interesting - the flavors were so unusual and yet "to die for!"... here is a winning combination for this meat - soak bananas and fresh pineapple in dark rum and maple syrup (overnight) - then grill the fruit and serve it with the meat... it tastes excellent together!

To the cook who complained this wasn't "the real thing:" A real jerk recipe begins with... "Cut several branches of allspice wood and fashion a grilling rack." Got any allspice trees in your yard?

I have made this twice now and just love it. The marinade looks disgusting but after you grill it it taste wonderful... great flavor.

To be honest, I never made jerk anything myself. I did taste jerk chicken a long time ago but I don't remember it clearly to compare. In anycase, this recipe is a nice way to prepare pork tenderloin. I think I will try to grill it nest time, to crisp the outer layer a little more.

I found it interesting that the article with this recipe in it discussed jerk from Jamaican beach shacks, and described jerk served in certain restaurants as a toned-down version. So what recipes do they provide us? Will we learn how they make it on the beach? Nooooo, we get the gringo versions from the restaurants. C'mon, Bon Appetit, give us the REAL THING! Nonetheless, I made this one with chicken and cooked it on the grill; not the best ever, but still enjoyable. If you like it hot, go ahead and put in a whole habañero, not just one teaspoon.
