Shouldn't the pumpkin seeds be roasted before adding them?

Sorry- also forgot to add: I left out the additional chipotle and added some minced poblano- about a half Tbsp.

People were sitting in the kitchen as I was making this, and wouldn't let me finish the assembly. Instead, they turned some into fish tacos, which also worked well (though they did like them on the crisps better) I made the dressing the night before which sped up the process (though not enough for my ravenous guests :) I also added cilantro and seared the tuna. Yum!

I took others advice and added a bit of cilantro plus I chilled it an hour before serving. I used both the baked tortillas from the recipe and the "scoops" and it was a huge hit with my friends.

When you use adobo sauce you do not need to use the additional chile chilpotle. Adobo sauce is chilpotle chiles pureed with tomatoes onions seasoned with cumin. Tostadas are readily available in supermarkets, I use them all the time. I save the broken tosdadas to use in 'chilaquiles' - 'old sombreros' a delicious brunch dish.

Considering that almost all major organizations which monitor the health of fisheries are calling for a complete ban on all tuna fishing for at least five years, I find these tuna based recipes extremely irresponsible and in very bad taste.

I wouldn't waste a pricey piece of fish like tuna in a recipe with such assertive flavors. Tuna has such a lovely flavor of it's own, that I prefer to use ingredients that complement it's meaty, sweet, unctuousness, rather than conceal it. I would choose a cheaper, mild- flavored white fish such as cod or even tilapia. A fine recipe, otherwise, and the pumpkin seeds add an authentic touch of the Yucatan.

Two thumbs up. My modifications: add cilantro. Get the chipotle peppers that are canned in adobo sauce, and ignore the measurements and add to taste. This will save you time and money. I omitted the pumpkin seeds because they didn't seem to fit the texture. Extra scallions. I was thinking with my wallet and bought 1/2 salmon and 1/2 tuna and flash seared them both before cutting them into cubes. As long as you don't overcook, the textures are fantastic, and the fattier salmon mingles so well with the avocado. I went through the trouble of doing the tortillas as outlined, but next time I won't bother. Took too much time and wasn't worth it. I will make this recipe again and again!!

I was so disappointed in this recipe. I don't know what I did wrong! The consistency grossed me out and I didn't think it had enough flavor. On the flip side, my boyfriend LOVED it! He ate the whole plate of tostadas. Beware - the cumin flavor is strong and it's very easy to over salt the chips. Give it a whirl, but I wasn't a huge fan.

We've been doing a version of this on camping trips to Baja for years. We use the ready made tostadas they sell down there (and at many stores here) and top with tuna salad and jalapenos. This recipe seems like a classier version I could serve to guests.

Great, simple appetizer, with tremendous flavor. Omit the pumpkin seeds, they are the wrong texture. And use Tostidos "Scoops" instead of the tortillas!

This was delicious, easy to make and attractive on the platter. We would add cilantro next time.
