These are great! I followed another reviewer's advice and finely chopped the tomatoes. I only had 1 cup souffle dishes which worked fine, just make sure they don't get over-cooked; Mine were ready at about 23 minutes.

My husband really disliked this receipe. The sundried tomatoes just didn't mix with the other items, and the results were very bland.

We made these for a vegetarian Christmas dinner, and they were great, if you like souffles. They are wonderfully light and fluffy, but I think they got better as they sunk! One thing, I thought that the texture sun-dried tomatoes was a little distracting, so I would recommend cutting the tomatoes into the smallest pieces that you can.

This souffle was light and tasty. It fluffed up nice and high and was a hit with all my guests. I found it quite time consuming to make but other than that, it was a really nice dish.

This was WONDERFUL!!! How can one go wrong with goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes & roasted garlic???? My husband & 9 year old son LOVED!!!!!! Great flavor.....I used 14oz souffle dishes & they worked out great..

I thought it was pretty good. It was my first time making a souffle. It was a bit frightening but it came out nice and fluffy. I wasn't to fond of the texture. The fluffy-ness should be reserved for a desert, not something so rich in bold flavours. But I found that when the souffle had cooled and sunk below the rim of the dish, the texture was much more enjoyable.

This is an easy, delicious recipe. My family doesn't care much for goat cheese, so I substituted an organic cream cheese that's a little tangy, without being too tangy; and I used whole milk. I served the souffles at brunch, using 1 1/2 cup custard cups, instead of 2 cup ramekins. So, I ended up with six souffles, rather than four. The cooking time was the same as for the 2 cup ramekins. Yummy, fluffy and wonderfully savory.

My vegetarian daughter thought this was an excellent concoction. I served it with asparagus and a salad, and it turned out to be a great light dinner.

Easy and light. Definitely could be a summer lunch or light dinner with a salad.
