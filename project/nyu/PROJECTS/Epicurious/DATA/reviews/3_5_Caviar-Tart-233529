I wish I could give this 3 1/2 forks. I really liked it but thought it needed a little more flavor. I thought the straining of the sour cream to be a real pain so I didn't do it and it was fine - and I agree with another reviewer that you need more than a 1/2 a cup to cover the dish.

This is a good version- -have always loved this recipe, but I am having trouble with the sour cream topping. 1/2 cup drained in this manner does not cover the pie. I am planning on doubling that and am sure it will be fine. Did anyone else have trouble with this?

Boo. Despite all the yummy ingredients, it just didn't happen for any of us. Rated this "good" but, really wanted this to turn out fantastic. Maybe I should have let the egg/onion/dill mix sit in the fridge longer than 5 hours so that the flavors could really pull together. Hmmm.

i have made this recipe twice with great results. i also used grocery store caviar but with the blend of eggs and onion it isn't noticed. i never bring home leftovers with this one!

I think this dish is AMAZING. It's relatively easy to make and is absolutely delicious, even with supermarket grade caviar. I took it to a cocktail party where it was the hit of the hors d'oeuvre table. I will most definitely make it again and again!

I've been serving this tart for years, and it's always a success. Surprisingly delicious, a less expensive version -for great crowds- can be made with packed tuna and some dried rose pepper instead of caviar.

I made this dish as well as the Lobster Crisps in Champagne-Dill Sauce as appetizers for my bi-monthly dinner group last night. I was far and away the clear winner and about half the pork. I used a mid-range caviar ($99/ounce) so I didn't have to soak up excess ink with my t-shirt, but used only two ounces. I supplemented with a little red wine and served wasabi to Joel on the side. The wasabi was a big hit. I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish as well as Lobster Crisps in Champagne-Dill sauce for my bi-monthly dinner group last night and the Caviar Tart was the clear winner and required much less work. I used a mid-range caviar (about $20/ounce) so I didn't have to soak up excess ink with paper towels, but I used only two ounces. I supplemented with some red tobiko and served wasabi tobiko on the side. The wasabi tobiko was a big hit. I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a delicious and cleverly composed hors d'oeuvre dish. I got this recipe from a friend years ago and have served it many times since then. It pairs especially well with miniature slices of black rye bread or sesame crackers. It's great at cocktail parties and has a natural affinity for shots of ice cold vodka.
