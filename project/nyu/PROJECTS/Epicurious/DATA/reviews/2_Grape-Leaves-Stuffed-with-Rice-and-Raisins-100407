I have to agree with the negative reviews: Coffee in Dolmas??! Great recipes for stuffed grape leaves appear in Joyce Goldstein's "Meditteranean : The Beautiful Cookbook", Clifford A. Wrightt's "A Mediterranean Feast" and in Mollie Katzen's "Mooswood Cookbook". The latter is the most simple of them all.

I have to agree with the previous review for it is a shame that all these lebanese recipes you give have been given by non lebanese cooks. Please try to be more efficient and take it from the horse's mouth. Our cuisine is one of the most delicious and healthiest in the world, and we are more than happy to share it . And again please try to get some lebanese cook books and I guarantee your satisfaction with our colorful recipes.

I looked for zero on the scale as this one deserves just that. This is stuffed vine leaves???? where in heavens name did you get this recipe from. Mediterranean cuisine is mostly tart and not sweet hence the raisins. Traditionally and at best, the filling is mainly chopped parsley, mint, tomatoes, olive oil, salt, lemon juice and of course rice and nothing more. For those of you who know tabboule and I mean the Lebanese version, not all those other versions that are loaded with burghol, it is basically the same filling while omitting the burghol and replacing it with short grain rice. It also should be cooked over low heat and best served cold the following day.

I'm still trying to find a great "dolmades" recipe. coffee and raisins ain't going to cut it! So far, my simple recipe wins by far, way far. I don't know who comes up with these recipes, but it's far from putting it under the "Greek" menu. It doesn't even come close.

I skipped the coffee grounds and added pine nuts. I also drained the yogurt (strainer with cheese cloth) and added garlic and paprika and skim milk. All in all a very successful dish.

Made this as a start to a Middle Eastern dinner and it was a hit. We left out the coffee grounds and used basmati rice. I made a simple yogurt sauce by dicing some fresh garlic and combining it with plain yogurt. Great combination of flavors.

I am writing from Greece, love your site but there's someting about this recipe that's strange. I love "dolmadakia" (that's the name of these delicasies, made all over Greece) but I have NEVER heard of ground coffee being added to the filling!
