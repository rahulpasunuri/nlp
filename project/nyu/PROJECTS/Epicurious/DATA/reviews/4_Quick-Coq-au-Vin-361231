This recipe was amazing! I let the sauce thicken at the end, added another cup of chicken stock, and 1/2 cup of red wine simmered again for 7-8 minutes. (While reducing the sauce, give the chicken breast a baster of chicken stock to keep it moist.) Remove sauce from heat, and whisk in a 1/4 cup heavy cream. Serve

Wonderful recipe. I changed the ingredients and methodology only slightly...I wished I could have used thyme instead of parsley, which IMO only adds colour but little in flavour. Alas, there was no thyme to be found. I added a couple of Tbs of butter at the finish of the sauce, then I added the chicken into the sauce and put it in the oven while I finished my sides.

Awesome, won't bother doing full longer version again. I tweaked the technique a bit, but no ingredient changes other than using cornstarch instead of flour. I browned the chicken then finished in oven (400) so it wouldn't dry out. I did add a bit more wine/broth and reduce for more depth. Finished with a pat of butter. Next time might throw in a sprig of thyme or rosemary for a little extra complexity.

This was great! I followed it exactly except I only had 1 cup of wine not 1 1/2, so my sauce was very thick and flavorful. I also didn't put my chicken in the oven. I just stuck it in my toaster oven to rest (not turned on) and it was very moist once the sauce was ready. Will definitely use again.

Very good flavours -- I added some fennel instead of the shallots and red peppers instead of garlic. Was great served with mashed potatoes (with ranch dressing and parmesan).

Rating: 3
Very good, but can have more depth by reducing a full bottle of wine (I prefer a Pinot Noir) and 2 c. chicken broth (a few sprigs of thyme & parsley help) and add 1 T tomato paste w/ flour. An extra T of wine and a couple pats of butter at the end add more depth.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely DELICIOUS! There is no need to make any of the changes others suggest. The only thing I would recommend is a lower setting on the oven because I did worry about drying out the chicken. The sauce was good and thick with the recommended cooking times. You have to have the mushrooms... they're the best part!

Rating: 3
Delic. However, I could have stayed true to the recipe a little more than I did& Having took some artistic liberties for the sake of being hungry and impatient, I 86ed the mushrooms (my dinner partner was not wild about them) and rushed with some of the prep...

Exceptional. Exchanged 6 boneless thighs for the 4 breasts and used a crock pot on warm to combine the ingredients on 2 hour "soak". Kids loved it! Paired with the Tarragon Fingerling Potato recipe in a bowl together was a great French combo!

We made this recipe the other night for the first time using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. We followed the recipe, with the exception of putting the chicken back into the skillet to simmer in the sauce for 30-35 minutes as suggested by some of the other reviewers. This one change made all the difference and the family not only loved the mean that night (served with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus), but has been arguing over who gets the leftovers!

Rating: 4
After reading the other reviews, I used boneless chicken thighs. One slice of bacon and a tablespoon of butter. Im not sure why they suggest a non-stick pan, but I used my cast iron skillet. After watching Donnie Brasco on hulu, I dusted the chicken with flour, sea salt, and pepper. I couldnt find any parsley so I skipped it. Instead of shallots I used red onions and baby Portobello mushrooms. A few cloves of smashed garlic. Cabernet. After simmering for ten or so minutes, I added the flour for thickening. And then, it seemed crazy to put the whole thing in the oven, so I transferred the chicken to the skillet with the sauce and covered and simmered all of it together. What a great flavor. I served it with garlic roasted green beans and red potatoes. I would totally do this again, even if its not really coq au vin.

Rating: 3
Not a bad recipe, but a few things need to be altered to make it great. First, it should only be used with chicken thighs not breasts. Secondly as the reviewer from SF wrote, it really needs a good 30 minutes in the oven to incorporate all the flavors. Then finish on the stove, until the desired consistency in the sauce is derived. Mount with a half stick of butter, and you will have one awesome dish. With all of this, I still did this dish in about an hour. No need for the uncooked flour/ stock addition. Just spend a bit more time in the oven and the stove. Use a good rich wine like Syrah or Cab, and you will get raves...

Rating: 2
The reduction time in this recipe is way too short. After adding the flour mix, I added the chicken back in and simmered for 35 minutes, not 3-4 minutes. Only then does the sauce gain complexity. Otherwise it is thin and embarrassingly tasteless. In that 35 minutes the chicken also completes cooking and tenderizes. I recommend a good wine in the sauce; and I actually used less of it and more chicken broth. Next time I am also using chicken stock, not broth, if I make this again.

Rating: 2
Good. The sauce and mushroom medley was delicious. The chicken was a little dry at 300F and seemed very separate from the sumptuous, savory sauce. If I try this again, I will only sear the chicken and then add it to the sauce to cook fully at the end.

This was a fabulous recipe! We all loved it, even my kids. I followed the directions for the most part. I didn't have shallots, so I used some chopped onion. No one in my family likes mushrooms, so I omitted them. I served it with steamed haricots verts, homemade Italian bread, and roasted fingerling potatoes. Hubby loved it so much, he has requested it for his birthday dinner.

This was delicious! I kept the oven temp way down at 170, and otherwise followed the recipe, and it turned out perfectly! The chicken was perfectly cooked and still moist after a half hour in the oven, the sauce was absolutely delicious, portion size was perfect, and the combined flavors I think beat out a well-reviewed french restaurant we'd visited the night before. I might consider adding baby carrots next time, but this is definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
Delicious sauce, very clever shortcuts that saved over 2 hours from a regular coq au vin recipe. I halved 3 instead of 4 chicken breasts, and I ended up a few spoonfuls short of sauce. Also, keeping the oven at 300 degrees dried out the meat. Next time, I'll try 250 degrees, and make more sauce. I served this over jasmine rice, and everyone loved it.

Very quick and easy supper. We really enjoyed this and will definitely serve it up again!

This was delicious! I made a few substitutions due to dietary restrictions and what i had in my pantry. I do not eat bacon, so I used about a tbsp. of olive oil to saute the veggies. I also substituted half a red onion for the shallots and sweet red wine (Baron Herzog Jeunesse) instead of dry. I was nervous about the dish being overly sweet and chose to use sea salt in the sauce and on the chicken instead of regular salt. I am so happy I did! I think it paired extremely well with the sweetness of the wine. I only wish I had doubled the sauce because I was licking it off the plate!

Rating: 1
This recipe was a real bummer. Maybe the wine I used was way off (a cheap Sangiovese) but I found this recipe to have little flavor except grape. This is one of my favorite French dishes to order but I've never attempted it at home. After this failure I consulted my Le Creuset cookbook and their recipe called for cognac and use of Burgundy not even syrah as the recipe suggested. Beware, use the right wine for this dish. If I ever make this again, I will use the long version and the right wine.

Wowsa! Delicious, simple. Reduced wine to 1 c.--used $4.50 trader joes, upped mushrooms to 10oz, upped bacon to 5 (b/c 40% less fat). Everything else, as written. DEFINITELY in regular rotation.

Delicious- this is a keeper. Only changes: I used chicken breast with skin on bone (cooked longer) and added a few carrots with the mushrooms and shallots. I cooked sauce with savory herbs and a bay leaf. Make sure to adjust salt and pepper at end to your taste as recipe states. Served with horseradish mashed potatoes....Husband wanted to lick the plate.

Pretty uneventful. It tasted OK, but was not worth the time it took to make. I couldn't taste the bacon at all, and the leftovers were a very unappetizing purple color because of the red wine (I ended up throwing them out). Next time I will make beef bourguignon.

This was a great and easy dish! I skipped the bacon and it was still delicious and instead of setting aside half of the chicken broth, I just scooped 3/4 cut of the broth and wine mixture out and mixed it with the flour. It turned out great and when I cheat on my diet I will try it with bacon! :)

My wife and I really loved this recipe. Minor changes made: Used 6 slices of bacon; still had to add a little olive oil along the way. Quartered the shallots. Sautéed chicken longer (big breasts from Sams). Boiled sauce less than the prescribed 10 minutes (didnt want too much evaporation).

Super delicious, as well as being easy to make. Often I don't have good results with boneless skinless breast since they can dry out easily, but these turned out great. Using all the bacon fat adds so much flavor. We served with buttered egg noodles and crusty bread, along with the leftover wine.

Very good and very easy! Only a few minor changes, I used white button mushrooms, quartered as they were quite large. No shallots, so I used about 10 green onion chopped into 1/2" pieces. Doubled the garlic.

I made this yesterday for my mothers birthday. I was wonderful and everyone loved it. I did do a few changes that were a success. I browned the bacon in the pan, sliced the chicken breasts into strips then added it to the pan w/ bacon and drippings to brown it. after the chicken was browned I added the shallots of which I only used 6 ( for a double recipe)and carrots in place of the mushrooms. Once everything was browned I added the liquids. I then cooked it in the oven at 220 for an hour and a half then at 350 for the last 30 min. After taking it out of the oven I placed on the stove top to bring to a boil and thickened with corn starch so as to not change the taste of the sauce.

Rating: 4
Made this with some boneless thighs and some bone-in legs and thighs and as per other reviewer recommendations let the chicken finish cooking in the sauce. Upped the mushrooms to 24 oz. and made in a cast iron dutch oven and cooked covered at 350 for 1 hour. Didn't thicken with flour(save some calories) served with arugula & herbed goat cheese salad with olive oil and balsamic glace dressing. Chicken tender, falling off the bone, just the way I like it and sauce perfect- chocked full of shallots and mushrooms while the bacon gave it that whole smoky thing that lingered on the palate. Very tasty.

Rating: 3
This is a nice basic recipe for coq au vin and one that is easily modified. I tend to prefer to cook things as much as possible in one pot, so I sauteed the mushrooms, shallots and garlic in bacon grease, added the chicken to brown it, added the spices (I also added thyme and oregano) and then the liquids. Bacon is often overwhelming in related recipes, so I didn't add it until the end and I used high-quality applewood-smoked bacon. Served over pasta, this kept me and my husband happy for three dinners!

Rating: 4
Absolutely phenomenal! Simple, hearty & wonderfully tasty. I did not have shallots or fresh parsley, so I used coarsely sliced onions & dried parsley - turned out exceptionally well :) Just to clarify a few things: Begin cooking the bacon in a deep, large skillet so you don't have to pour the drippings into another skillet for the broth. Just set the bacon aside after you cook it - on a paper towel, plate, cutting board...doesn't have to be a bowl. Cover pie dish of browned chicken with an oven-safe lid or sheet of foil, so it doesn't dry out. When boiling the wine/mushrooms/shallots/chicken broth mixture, it's okay if it looks somewhat thin after reducing for 10 minutes - the flour & any additional time spent simmering will even things out :)

This is a great base recipe. I made a few changes, which made it my favorite dinner that only took one pan but made it a three-fork recipe. Used skin-on (less healthy, I know) and quartered the shallots. If you have the heat turned up appropriately, your chicken may brown before it cooks all the way through. Just hold it in an oven. I also added thyme, with good results. Swirled in butter at the end before mixing in flour/broth mixture and MMMM delicious. More fat, but that's just good flavor.

Great as is, but could see it as a fantastic base recipe for building up with other flavours, i.e., other herbs and tomato paste. I also ended up holding the chicken in the oven at 300 degrees, in the sauce until my guests arrived, and it came out very tender.

Made this for friends last night and they loved it. I altered the recipe slightly: Browned the chicken in the bacon grease, removed to a plate while browning the veggies and added herbs (marjoram because I had it, herbes de Provence) to the liquid. Let the sauce cook a little, put chicken back in and let it cook in the pan til chicken was about 145 degrees. Removed chicken again, added slurry so sauce thickened a bit, put chicken back in and then into a warm (165) oven while I had a drink and homemade crackers with the guests. Half an hour or so later, I served it with earthy potatoes from this site, haricots vert and a carrot/brussels sprouts mixture I was trying for Thanksgiving. Nice presentation, very moist chicken.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. Made double the recipe. Cooked bacon in the oven and then used some of the fat to cook the chicken in. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. Used Zinfandel wine. Took much longer than 45 minutes given all the prep for the veggies and I also put chicken back into the sauce and let it simmer for at least a half hour to get really tender. Served with a wild rice mixture one day and pasta the second day - both worked well. Also, served some crusty bread which was a must for mopping up juice.

Great for a weeknight dinner. I just want to comment on what people are saying about shallots: yes, they mean shallots and yes, they should be chunky. The shallots take on an incredible flavor and when they make up much of a mouthful they add a great variety to the dish. Chunks of shallots, chunks of mushrooms. Yum.

Rating: 3
Excellent quick version of the classic. Try boneless/skinless thighs for better flavor. I used 10 oz mushrooms instead of 8; the sauce can handle it so I would even use more next time. As others suggest, definitely don't keep the chicken in that high an oven. I served mine over egg noodles-- delicious.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly for ingredients but per other suggestions I brought the chicken to final doneness by simply putting it back in the sauce towards the end. It was scrumptious. I will definitely make it again but I think I will use legs next time as the white meat wasn't really the rich flavor you wanted with the delicious sauce. Served this over mashed potatoes which was a great vehicle for sopping up more of the delicious sauce. Dish was very quick and easy.

Rating: 4
I thought this was great!! Easy to make, delicious sauce. I couldn't bear to take that nice crispy crumbly bacon and let it get soggy in the sauce though, so I used it on top of the finished product as a garnish. Only downside to this was: none was left for leftover portion! Deboned the breasts myself as they invariably taste better. Quick saute on either side (2-3 min) and finished in the oven (not at all dry). Also, chopped the shallots so you get some with every bite! Served with polenta and last-of-the-season garden fresh green beans. Will definitely make again!

Not quite as quick and easy as it sounds - but that could have been me out of practice. It says "shallots", but not sure if it doesn't mean scallions. I used shallots, but 8 would have been a lot. The chicken was tender, nicely browned and tasty (fried in bacon grease - of course it was!), but the sauce was pretty strongly wine flavored. We used Ten Mile 06 red table wine, possibly not dry enough. We definitely liked it, but probably won't make this recipe again.

Thank you, Universe. Something about which my picky husband actually said "very good." It really tastes like that long-cooking use-every-pan coq au vin that messes up my kitchen. AND on a school night! I used chicken breasts on the bone (because they were fresher and cheaper today)and changed nothing else, except an on-hand Malbec for the Syrah. Yum. I'd use lots more mushrooms next time. I served this over smashed #1 creamer read potatoes. My picky 8 year old son devoured the potatoes and sauce. I can't wait to have the leftovers as the yummy flavors co mingle. THANK YOU!

Delicious! I agree that the chicken should NOT go into the oven (because it got dry) but the flavors were still yummy. Will put back into sauce next time. Used a Pinot Noir and served with Three Grain Blend from TJs (rice, barley, & spelt) and peas. Perfect weeknight meal!

I am not reviewing this because I didn't make it, but how does any recipe that involves cooking something in bacon grease get into the "Healthy" recipe category? I would think it would have to taste good. The challenge in healthy cooking is creating things that taste good that are also good for you.

followed the advice of others and stored the chicken in the microwave rather than the oven. After i added the flour slurry, put the chicken breasts back in the pan with the lid on to warm the breasts. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and it gave it a nice rich flavor. It was absolutely delicious and easy to make. Nice and hearty for a fall evening.

Delicious! I used 6 chicken breasts and they all wouldn't fit in the pan to cook, so I put them in the oven and it did dry them out a tad, but there was plenty of sauce - yummy sauce, so good! My sauce never got very thick, but no matter, it was full of flavor.

It came out wonderfully. Next time I might decrease the shallots to 6. I used a $13 Syrah and liked the flavor. And the color was dramatic. My wife thought it tasted like "French comfort food." It's important to note that if you fully cook the chicken in the pan, then it will dry out in the oven (as many have already found out). 6 minutes on each side was about right for mine at 350 F. Just don't take too long making the sauce... =)

Very tasty and easy. I agree with other reviewers that it is much better to skip the step of putting the chicken breasts in the oven and just simmer them in the sauce as it cooks instead. I was out of bacon s I used Canadian bacon with a touch of olive oil instead and it worked out fine.

I agree. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which are cheaper and overall more juicy and flavourful so I skipped the oven step and finished cooking my fillets in the sauce. I also used prosciutto instead of bacon because I could a: buy it in a smaller quantity in my grocery store and b: it's slightly lower in fat. The sauce came out beautifully and I served it with new potatoes. The leftovers I am looking forward to heating over rice for lunch!

Overall, a very good "weeknight" recipe. The sauce is wonderful, and the shallots and mushrooms come out perfectly. However, the choice of skinless boneless breast, and then leaving the chicken in the oven while the sauce cooks, dries the protein out completely. Luckily we had plenty of sauce to add a little moisture back in, but if I made this again I would use skin-on chicken, sear each side, and then cook it through in the sauce.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I made no changes and thought it was delicious. In the future I think I would place the chicken breasts back into the sauce as it simmers at the end to reheat it instead of in the oven.

For a coq au vin made with chicken breasts in under an hour (far from a true coq au vin), I have to give this recipe props for being quite flavorful. I served it over mashed red potatoes and the only change I made was substituting fresh rosemary for the parsley and pearl onions instead of the shallots. It really was amazing for such a quick and easy dish. Will definitely make this one again! Maybe I'll go with chicken thighs next time for a bit moister meat though.
