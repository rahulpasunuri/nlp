OK, am I alone in thinking this recipe is as informative as one for a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich? This is silly.

This can be delicious spiced up and pureed with any or all of the following: garlic, lemon juice or wine vinegar, fresh basil, dill, freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese, olives, or onions, and sea salt. Try serving it under seafood, poultry, meat or cheese.

Bland!! Rather than try to enhance this recipe - look up a different one with some spicy ingredients.
