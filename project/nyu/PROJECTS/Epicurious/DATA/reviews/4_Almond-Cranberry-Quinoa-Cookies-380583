Made these today...outstanding! Not sure why other reviewers said they're not sweet...they're plenty sweet for us. I did make two modifications...omitted the white sugar and used 1/2c brown and used 1/2c each dried cranberries and cherries...maybe this added add'l sweetness? Anyway, they are crisp, tender outside and pillowy soft inside...definitely will make again. May try using 1/2 butter 1/2 coconut oil next time...and maybe add some orange zest too!

Wasn't as prepared as I thought I was and had to make substitutions. Substituted agave for sugar, ground up cheerios for oats, and dried cherries for cranberries. Made bar cookies instead of drop cookies. At first wasn't fond of the cake-like texture, but the next day, Wow! They were moist, flavorful, and consumed quickly. Will definitely make these again.

I really enjoyed these cookies, considering all the healthy ingredients! They're cake-like cookies, and we ate them for both snacks and breakfast. I added chocolate chips and dried cherries. The second time I made them without the quinoa and added flaxseed instead. (I found the quinoa crunch odd).

These cookies are great grab and go breakfast fare. I am allergic to nuts and eat gluten free, so I substituted the called for ingredients of wheat flour for a mixture of rice, amaranth, tapioca and arrowroot floors and fine unsweetened coconut for the almonds. As I have been cooking gluten free for over 20 years, back when there were no gluten free products ready made on the shelves, I am not tempted to purchase the preprepared gluten free flour mixes available, but, I am fairly certain they would work well in this recipe. I tried them out on friends that don't have dietary restrictions and they thought they were great. I used a mixture of brown sugar and honey. Reviewers said they liked them because there were not too sweet. The modified version will become something I make regularly.

While I agree that this is a healthy recipe, I disagree that they aren't a dessert cookie. That said if you're into Tollhouse, these aren't them. I used dark chocolate chips and pecans and they turned out moist and decadent. I made most of the alterations people suggested including using spelt instead of wholewheat, added toasted ground flaxseed and hemp seed. I used only brown sugar and maple syrup, and I used olive oil instead of butter. Don't shy away from these if you're looking for a great oatmeal cookie!

I just made these cookies based on my sister's recommendation, and they are great. I love that they are easy to make, healthy, and wholesome. I made this recipe with 70% dark chocolate chunks instead of the cranberry/almond, some agave mixed in with the honey and sugar, and used all organic ingredients except for the butter. The only thing I don't totally enjoy about these cookies is that they are cakey rather than chewy. I was thinking that they would be more like the texture of an oatmeal cookie. Overall, great healthy snack with whole grains and protein. I will def make these again.

This recipe is great for my daughter who cannot eat wheat. I substitute spelt flour for the whole wheat, and egg beaters for the eggs, which she cannot eat either. I have added white chocolate chips for fun.

Very good, will make again. Don't feel as guilty eating cookies when they have some healthy ingredients.

I made this for my Nursing class the night before a major test (and brought them in for everyone on test day) and they went over SOOO well! Would definitely make them again!

I'm always looking for healthy tasty snacks for my toddler and these are it! Here are my modifications: Always double and then have in freezer. For each cup of flour first put in 1tbsp of ground flax, oat bran, and one chia seed then fill with Whole wheat. sub sea salt for kosher and reduce to 1.5tsp for a doubled recipe. don't double white sugar and use maple syrup in place of honey. didn't use almond extract. Make sure cranberries are finely chopped b/c they're generally sweetened so adds sweetness to whole cookie.

Lots of crunch in these. Just ok.

I agree with those who mentioned not to expect a dessert cookie. These are not melt in your mouth rich cookies, but more like a slightly sweet breakfast treat. I would describe them as pleasant but not memorable.

I'm not a baker and these came out perfect! I will definitely make these again. Very tasty and healthy for a cookie - as already mentioned, more of a breakfast than dessert cookie. I made exactly as written except with pecans. Yummy! Hubby loved them too. I think I'll bring a batch to the office.

For cookies with so many grains??? I mean come on, them are some good cookies. All right, to be honest, instead of the sliced almonds I added 60% cacao chocolate chips. Really good. I know, it's chocolate, but it's dark chocolate and that's good for you too...

These were great...almond extract is wonderful. I added some toasted coconut because I happened to have a 1/2 c left over from another dish. I also subbed Sprouted Wheat Flour for whole wheatflour and the texture is still good.

Difficult to get my teenager to eat anything for breakfast, but these should do the trick. I used all brown sugar. I forgot to beat the butter with the sugar, and added it at the end after I melted it. I used half dried cranberries and half dried cherries. I used 2/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 white flour since that is all I had. Really liked.

Fabulous! Love a healthy morning breakfast treat that is completely portable, filling, and healthy. I substituted pecans for the almonds, and plan on making again with dried blueberries in place of or with the cranberries. Am thinking about substituting agave nectar next time, or adding bran or flax seed. Everyone in my family loved them.

Made these twice - first time beating the butter, second time melting it. No discernible difference.

As San Francisco pointed out, a nice breakfast cookie - four stars in that context. I used 1 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat, and got 28 2-tbsp scoops from the batch. The texture inside seemed to me along the lines of a whole grain, healthy (and yummy) muffin. My kids were happy to eat them.

In the BA magazine that published this recipe, it is billed as "Breakfast Cookies," and that is what they are... though it should be apparent from the recipe, no one should expect that this recipe yields a delectable dessert type of cookie that will wow everyone. There are probably ways to make this recipe even healthier and/or more delicious, but they came out great, and I look forward to grabbing one on my way out the door tomorrow.

I substituted 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 Agave nectar for the sugar and honey. They came out delicious. I wonder how many few sugar grams doing it this way?

i thought they were delicious, and brought them to a dinner party where they were promptly gobbled up by everyone. the quinoa flavor really came through without making it too heavy. i used melted butter and just mixed all of the ingredients in one bowl using a wooden spoon, folding the flour in last. just to be clear - they're no chocolate chip cookies, but they're good enough to enjoy wholeheartedly.
