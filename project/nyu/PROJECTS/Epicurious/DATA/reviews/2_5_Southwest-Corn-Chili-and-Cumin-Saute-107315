I was unpleasantly surprised. It was way to hot for my liking and I like hot foods. The radishes did not seem to fit i well either.

Very good. I grilled fresh corn instead of frozen, and it was fantastic.

Expected to love it based on the ingredients, but was disappointed. I may have used too much canned chipotle chilies, and the radishes didn't seem to go with the rest of the dish. Not worth the trouble.

I made this for a bbq at the house yesterday. Everyone loved this! Totally refreshing. Will make again.
