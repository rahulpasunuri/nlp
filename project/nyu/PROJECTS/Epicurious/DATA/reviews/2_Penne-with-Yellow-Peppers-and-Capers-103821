Tried this tonight because I had all the lovely produce it requires. The verdict...blah.

I really loved this dish. I used red, yellow, and orange peppers which made the dish much more interesting to look at. I did not add the anchovies (I was out but I will try them next time) and I used basil in a jar.. not fresh but not dried. Dusted with fresh ground pepper and parmesian cheese this dish looks good and tastes yummy! My whole family liked it.

Perhaps it was because I didn't use fresh basil, perhaps it was the grade of olive oil. However, this dish was very bland - at least until a large quantity of mozzarella and parmesan was added. Then, it was somewhat tasty. When pieces of tomato from the pizza dropped in, it was even better. However, as is, this recipe is bland, boring, and a waste of ingredients.
