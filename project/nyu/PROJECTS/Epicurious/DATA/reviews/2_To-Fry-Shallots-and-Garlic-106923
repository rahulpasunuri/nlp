Some Asian grocery stores offer fried onions in plastic containers with screw tops. Like many of their other staples, they last a LONG time and I have used them to top such recipes as rice in coconut milk. A very nice Thai combination.

Love the mix of garlic and shallots. Someone needs to read the amount it produces. This can be added to all sorts of dishes.
