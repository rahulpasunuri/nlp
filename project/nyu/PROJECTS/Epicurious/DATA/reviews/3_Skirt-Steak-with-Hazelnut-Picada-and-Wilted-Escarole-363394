made this tonight, and it was very good. truly, the escarole was the star. make extra. i think next time i will make the picada more citrus-y , and add a squeeze of lemon over the whole thing before serving, to brighten it up. a nice, unusual, but simple winter dish. quick to make, but needs some tweaking to be truly outstanding. falls in the slightly fancy comfort food category, i think.
