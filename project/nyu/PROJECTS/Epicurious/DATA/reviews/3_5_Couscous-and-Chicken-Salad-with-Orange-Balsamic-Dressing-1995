I tripled the recipe and served this salad along with a few other main course salads for a party of fifty. It was not only delicious but lovely to look at.

Okay, my review is based upon a greatly adjusted recipe, mostly because I have discovered that this is a "look what's in the fridge and make a couscous salad"! starter recipe. ;) I had some leftover homemade tandoori chicken (yummy), so I chunked that up. Honestly, I didn't have any of their add-ins (the cilantro, garbanzos, olives, etc.). But I DID chunk the naval orange from which I got the grated peel for the salad, and threw that in. I also put in a little bit of finely chopped red onion. I bet that parsley or mint would be great. Amazingly, my 5 and 3 year old kids LOVED it. They stood at the bowl and just dug in while I was mixing. I think when they heard it was teeny- tiny pasta, they were kind of starry- eyed. To bump everyone else, definitely add the salt and pepper -- I just added to the wonderful dressing which I didn't change at all... So, while I'm sure that the original recipe is wonderful, now I've found a great "look-and-dump" backup for dinner when leftovers seem bleak on their own.

Excellent. The dressing is a must. I didn't have everything on hand. I used orange marmalade with a little water and finely diced white onions.

My family enjoyed this a lot. My ten year old who will only eat lettuce said she liked it better than what she usually eats. The dressing is a must. I used orange marmalade with a little water since I didn't have an orange on hand. I also used finely diced white onions too.

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it many times. Whenever there's a picnic or barbecue, it's my standby. Without the orange/balsamic dressing, however, I don't think it would be all that exciting. The dressing is AMAZING and works so well with all the other flavours.

I cut this recipe in half and still have enough to feed several people. I wouldn't usually add salt to a dish that already has so many olives -- but as the commenter below said, it really does need it. Anyway, this was good -- but not good enough. I prefer the Curried Couscous with Garbonzo bean salad that I made last week.

This salad is DELICIOUS as the recipe is written, BUT IT NEEDS SALT AND PEPPER. Some earlier reviews say this recipe is blah, but if you add some salt and pepper. Everything you cook needs a little salt to enhance the flavor. Try adding 2 tsp. kosher salt and 1 tsp. ground black pepper. This is a great meal on its own. Adding some toasted pine nuts, pistachios or sliced almonds will be a good addition as well.

I loved this. I skipped the peppers since I hate them with a deep seated passion, and only used about half the orange zest due to an error...but my whole family loved it, and I'd make it that way again any time.

I liked it. The cumin and orange in the dressing are very good and I like the combo of textures. It is a different way to use up chicken and you can add lots of different veggies to make things different

Cooking the couscous in chicken broth is a great tip. I didn't use all the couscous because I wanted a greater proportion of stuff to couscous. I substituted cherry tomatoes for the red peppers, and threw in some Asiago cheese. I made this for lunch for the week, and it keeps well.

Nice summer salad but it took a little more time than had planned. I followed recipe exactly except cut everything in half. Glad I used chkn. broth in couscous also. Cook in Oly...

I made this dish for a trip down the Grand Canyon. Due to the limited cooking and refrigeration provisions, I had to make considerable alterations. I used canned chicken, flavored couscous (Morrocan/current), red onion, and fresh red bell pepper, and I added pine nuts. It was a huge hit--everyone wanted the recipe. I also think this dish would be great and more nutritious with Quinoa instead of couscous. I do think you should recommend using chicken or vegetable broth to cook the Quinoa or couscous, otherwise it is too bland.

I guess I ended up using this as a starter recipe, modifying it quite a bit from the original. I cut the recipe in half, but used 2/3 of the dressing, which seemed about right. I added pine nuts, and used dried cranberries instead of currants. (The first time I made it I used a mix of raisins, dried apricots, and currants and that was delicious, too). I like to add more green onion than is called for, but leave out the cilantro (which I don't like), and the roasted chicken-too much work, and didn't seem to add much. Cooking the couscous in broth is essential. Keeps well, and is excellent for several days worth of dinner on hot summer days, and for picnics.

I,like other cooks prepared the couscous with chicken broth. The dressing "makes" the salad. Delicious! Will make again. Beware: it makes a lot of salad. Ended up giving my neighbors leftovers.

The most important substitution was to cook the couscous in chicken broth (or vegetable broth, if you prefer) instead of water. This usually defeats the blah issue that a lot of people have with couscous. Since I rarely have all the ingredients for recipes on hand, I substituted dried cranberries for the currants, omitted the olives and chick-peas. I didn't make the dressing, but instead added the zest from 2 oranges. Everyone went back for seconds, and quite a few for thirds. (There was plenty to be had.) Best of all, I made the salad the night before, put plastic wrap RIGHT ON TOP of the salad, and when it was time to eat, it came straight out of the refrigerator.

I like couscous, so this was a hit with me. Have served it at luncheons several times and it has been a hit! I used raw red bell peppers because I think it added a little crunch. It definitely serves more than 8!

I followed the recipe closely and was very disappointed. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It tastes like a mishmash. If it serves only 8, they must be sumo wrestlers; I would say it serves 16 easily. Now I get to figure out how to salvage this massive quantity of blah (but colorful) stuff.

I might not have made this correctly, but it was the worst chicken salad I have ever eaten. I don't think I will make it again.

Great dressing. I used lemon juice instead of orange, and put in leftover tandoori chicken!

I have made this salad at least five times and everyone just loved it. I highly recommend it.

First of all, this recipe makes a LOAD of food. I'd like to make this using orzo in place of the couscous (pretty blah)and punching up the flavor using fresh peppers, maybe, and more onion. It was OK, but certainly not great.

I made this for an easy family dinner. It was easy and very tasty. It is good enough for a family meal. The servings are generous. Well, I did grill my red pepper, used vidalia onions instead of green onion, grilled chicken breasts instead of roasted chicken, and finally I used dried cranberries instead of currants. The dressing was the secret, and I didn't change it at all.
