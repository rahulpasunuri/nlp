I make this torte frequently because it is so easy--no mixer, no creaming the butter, worrying about the rise, etc. Rather than using apricot jam, I make a less-sweet filling by cooking dried apricots with brandy, water, and sugar, then pureeing.

I used plum jam and thought the combination of plum and chocolate was excellent, but the slivovitz flavor in the glaze is a bit overpowering. Try the Capri Chocolate Torte.

I make this every year at Christmas. It is a delicious - rich, dense, moist. I use the apricot filling - great combination: chocolate & apricot. It also makes a beautiful presentation and can be prepared ahead of time. Wonderful recipe.
