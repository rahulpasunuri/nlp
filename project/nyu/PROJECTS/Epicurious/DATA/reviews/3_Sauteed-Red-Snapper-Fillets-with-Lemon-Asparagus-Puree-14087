As written, this recipe is just OK, as the one fork indicates. It's bland (lots of lemon juice saved it from being a waste), and the purée is very liquid (use less water).

It can certainly use some tweaking, but this recipe is a great base for experimentation. I used a fresh spring herb risotto for my starch and also added some toasted pine nuts to the puree to thicken it up a bit, and make it more of a pesto.

Very nice! Spruced it up a little by cooking a shallot with the asparagus, and then adding ground thyme to the puree. I wasn't that fond of the potatoes, and will probably try something different for the starch.

Combine the prep in this recipe with the sauce and fish from another recipe also on Epicurious...Roasted Salmon with Asparagus. Check it out. I thought the Sauteed Salmon with the puree was great...the other recipe will have you adding thyme and capers. I also added verjus and served with a quinoa pilaf flavored with thyme and alspice. Looked and worked out beautifully.

I used red curry paste in the sauce and served this over black beans and rice. It was excellent!! I would definately make this again!!

Easy and looks good but the sauce is dull. Prefer Red Snapper with Sherry Beurre Blanc recipe also on this web-site.

So simple and tasty. Will certianly make it again. I'll bet if you replaced the red snapper with scrambled or poached aggs and roasted the potatoes instead of boiling them you would have a darn tasty breakfast too!

Try olive oil not butter.

Great stuff. I've even skipped the potato step when I am in a hurry. But that part makes it look realy good.
