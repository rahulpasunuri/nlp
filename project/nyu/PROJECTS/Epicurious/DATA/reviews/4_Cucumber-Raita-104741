I made this recipe as written and loved it. Then I also made it without garlic, and added BOTH coriander and mint - even better!

This super easy raita just rings in your mouth. I just mixed it up (so easy) and tasted off the spoon as I slid it into the fridge and it just hums ....I changed a little though, I used a smallish cuce, about 1/2 to 3/4 (one fat scoop) of greek yogurt, I gave my cumin seeds a quick and rough grind through an old pepper mill, a dash of powdered garlic (sometimes fresh & uncooked is too strong for me) and fresh mint .....so easy & delish!

I've concocted and made a lot of raitas from specific recipes. This is the best and simplest I've come across. The first time, I added a little yellow pepper to add color. The second time I made it I added a little lemon juice. Both times it was wonderful.

This is quick and easy to make. The cumin seeds are delicious. Strained yogurt is really good for this, unless you like it having thinner raita. I feel like mint would be better than coriander, but coriander is just fine.I recommend adding salt to this.

this was great. be sure to take the time to chill it for the proper texture. i was lazy and just used ground cumin and cayenne and i also only used 1.5 cups low fat plain yogurt rather than 2 cups

I make this a lot and have for years. If you want your yogurt thicker, try putting a layer of cheescloth in a colandar and adding the yogurt. Cover and leave in frig overnight. Use the next day for a firmer raita. Also, I let my cucumber drain for an hour or two before using.

made this using 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 greek yogurt in the food processor w cilantro, garlic, and cumin. then added my chopped cucumbers to mix in a bowl. it was amazing! served it over a bed of lightly steamed kale and dotted it with tomatoes. you have to seed the cucumbers (with a spoon to remove). that is why the other reviewers said it was too watery. mine was thick enough to be a dip.

A wonderful addition to any Indian meal. Simple to make with ingredients that are readily available. One can't ask for anything more!!

For those of us who don't like mint, this is a great recipe because it doesn't call for the mint that other similar recipes do. I also added a small amount of white vinegar (about a teaspoon) and maybe a quarter of a sweet red pepper chopped fine (for color). Be careful when toasting the coriander seeds because they will brown extremely quickly depending on how hot the pan is. This is great as a salad, with nan, with poppodoms, or even on rice!

This is excellent as an accompaniment to a spicy curry or dal. I use fresh mint leaves, and add thinly sliced onion, tomato chunks, and some fresh lemon juice in addition to the other ingredients (and sometimes cooled boiled potato chunks). It's delicious! Goes well with just about any middle eastern food. Also great spooned onto pita bread with lettuce and lentil beans the next day.

I have made this as is, several times, always refreshing. but tonite substituted minced dill for the cilantro to go with a scallop recipe that has cilantro in it.I am sure it'll be tasty too.

I've made this four times now so I figure I owe a rating! It's simple, easy and tempers the hot & spicy curry my husband makes. Love it!

Very refreshing! The addition of mint to the usual cucumber provides extra coolness and complexity. Definitely a keeper.

Although I had used a coffee filter to drain the yogurt, meticulously blotted the chunks of cucumber and removed the heart of it, it still came out a bit watery. But the taste in itself was pretty good and a refreshing accompaniment to my pork vindaloo. Next time I will use a fattier type of yogurt. Perhaps Greek yogurt does the trick.

I made this last month to accompany vindaloo - it was perfect. I patted dry and barely salted the cukes - a must - but I used fatfree yogurt and did not need to strain it at all. In fact, it kept well for 2 days or so without any separation. I am making it again tonight! Yum!

I made both - one with fresh mint and the other with cilantro - and used ground cumin. I forgot the cayenne, which might be why it lacked a tiny bit of kick, but it was great with the Tandoori Chicken, chutney and chopped mangoes. Next time, I will experiment to get a little more fresh herb flavor out of it.

I always add some diced tomato to my raita. Goes great on falafel for a little Indian/Mideast fusion.

Just what I wanted! For this to be nice and thick, you really do need to blot the cucumbers (as another review suggested) and let the yogurt sit in a sieve or on cheesecloth. If you haven't done this before, you'll be amazed at the difference it makes! Also, I used a little mint AND a little cilantro, but I wasn't happy about the mint. I just didn't like the taste in this dish. But the cilantro makes it great! Oh, and I used ground cumin, too, but there were no complaints.

Very good and very easy to make. I 'cheated' and used ground cumin. I also added a little bit (less than 1 tsp.) of ground coriander. If you use nonfat yoghurt, (and want your raita less watery) try pressing some of the liquid out of your cucumbers after they're chopped by weighting them in a bowl and letting stand room temp. for about an hour, then pouring off excess liquid. Stonyfield Farms has made plain whole milk yoghurt much more readily available -- they have it in my local SuperFresh (which is by no means the most 'gourmet' store in the neighborhood.)
