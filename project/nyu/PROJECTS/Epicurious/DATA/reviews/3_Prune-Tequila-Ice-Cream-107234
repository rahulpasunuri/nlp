'Interesting' & 'different' are about the only adjectives I can give this recipe. While I'm a fan of tequila & 'baking with booze' in general, this was too much of a departure in texture from regular ice cream to be truly enjoyable. The prunes' soluble fiber create a far thicker ice cream than I was expecting, & it ended up lasting for over 2 weeks in the freezer - unheard of for homemade ice cream in my house. The resulting flavor was somewhere between rum raisin ice cream and some sort of thick spicey prune mash. The one positive was the sugar was exactly the right amount to make it just sweet enough yet not too sweet. That's very rare with American dessert recipes - I usually cut the sugar by 2/3, sometimes even 1/2. But in the end, this recipe's name sounded more enticing than the result.

this was way too rich. It tasted like frozen butter to me. Big yuck!

Great recipe, very big hit, although since I didn't read the recipe until a few hours before I served if I stewed the prunes in the tequila for a about 15 minutes then let them till the end of the dinner when I made the ice cream as the cobbler came out and that worked out well. Very big hit.

I did make changes (frustrating, I know) to this. I liked it made with tequila, but loved it when I replaced tequila with brandy and added fresh ginger slices and a cinnamon stick to the prunes when I macerrated them. I wish I could tell you that it's my own idea, but I got the idea from a recipe on this site from The Laurel, a restaurant in San Diego: Armagnac-Poached Prunes with Vanilla Ice Cream

A delightfully different topper for a gourmet evening. I served it a flame with a burning sugar cube soaked in tequila for effect. WONDERFUL!
