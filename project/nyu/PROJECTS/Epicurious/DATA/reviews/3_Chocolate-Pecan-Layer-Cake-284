This was an excellent, light, not-too-sweet cake, almost flourless in nature. I thought the glaze was a bit heavy and I might tone it down next time.

Delicious!! Very light. Had this for a dinner party and all the guests were impressed and really enjoyed it. The only thing that I would want to improve is most of the pecans settled to the bottom layer. Still delicious.

I was not impressed with either flavor or texture. It sounded so good and smelled wonderful baking but final product was just okay.

This is a delicious,not too sweet, rich yet light dessert that really impressed my guests. I substituted praline liqueur for the bourbon,and made a little extra glaze so I could cover the sides completely. I scribbled melted milk chocolate and white chocolate into the glaze and drew a toothpick through it to marbelize the top, then coated the sides with pecan pieces. It was beautiful! Definitely a show stopper. Next time I'll try Amoretto and almonds.

One of the best cakes I ever made. Very light and airy texture with tons of flavor. Allow yourself enough time to prepare it. Makes a fabulous impression on guests, very gourmet.

If you like pecans and chocolate then this is for you!!! It is fun to make and kids like it too, if they pick off the pecans, but for adults no need to change a thing. I LOVED IT!!!!!!! So Good!
