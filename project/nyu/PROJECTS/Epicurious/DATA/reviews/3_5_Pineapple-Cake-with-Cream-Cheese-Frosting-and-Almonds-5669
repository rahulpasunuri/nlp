A very delicious recipe, provided you make all the recommended changes by other reviewers!! I added only 3/4 cup of sugar (I like my cake not so sweet, and compensate it with the icing) and 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut. The cake is therefore moist and not too dense, with a little bit of bite to it (from the pineapple and coconut). It also appeals to those who doesn't normally like dessert, since the cake itself is not overly drenching in sugar. Those with sweet tooth find the icing balancing out their need for sugar just fine. Everybody loved this cake. I'm only giving it 3 stars due to the need for adaptation from original recipe, but the adapted version is really a 4 stars-worth recipe!

My favorite cake. Always a hit whenever I make it for a party. A few variations I've done in the past - add cinnamon. Use walnuts if out of almonds. Double the icing recipe and bake in two round cake pans - the layer of icing in the middle then makes the cake not only look like you're a professional, but absolutely irresistible.

I was looking for a recipe that would make a cake similar in texture to a layer cake. This isn't it, but it is good. Next time I would reduce the sugar to 1 1/3 cup. It is extremely sweet. I'll also take another commenter's suggestion and add a cup of coconut. It's texture is very much like a carrot cake and adding pecans of macadamias would be a nie switch from almonds.

This is a moist, flavorful cake. I toasted macadamia nuts and left them out of the cake batter but instead sprinkled them on top of the frosting. This was the finale for a Hawaiian-themed dinner and was quite a hit!

I really liked this cake and will definitely make it again. After reading other reviewer's comments I made a couple of small adjustments: I reduced the sugar a little bit, to about 1.5 cups, and I used a can of pineapples in fruit juice, instead of syrup, which is all I had in the house anyway. Since they were pineapple rings and I didn't feel like chopping, I decided to make the whole cake in the food processor: first the sugar, butter and eggs, then the dry ingredients, then the pineapple with all its juice, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla just for fun. Baked it in a bundt pan and it was perfect in about 40 minutes. Really moist and delicious, with or without nuts, and the cream cheese frosting is a perfect combination. Great dessert for all occasions. Yum.

I was somewhat disappointed. The consistency of the cake was fine, but I expected more of a pineapple taste. I think I would add more pineapple, or pineapple rings, to bring out the pineapple flavor.

I was very disappointed; I found it leaden and cloyingly, sickeningly sweet. Tossed it out!

Wonderful! Is there no baking soda or vanilla that should go in this recipe? Thank you!

This is cake is so yummy. The first time I made it, my brother in law almost ate the whole thing by himself! It is extremely moist and the cream cheese frosting is a very good compliment. This cake reminded me of a carrot cake, but minus the carrots.

This is definitely a great, simple recipe. I left out the nuts, since my family doesn't like them. It is still great tasting, and the ginger adds a lot!
