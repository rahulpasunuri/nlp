The recipe doesn't specify whether to serve this straight out of the freezer, let it thaw a little, or let it come to room temperature. Straight out of the freezer, despite the glamorous ingredients and heroic beatings of numerous ingredients, it tastes like cheap ice cream. The white chocolate cannot be tasted. If individual slices are given about 20 minutes to soften up, the taste and texture improve slightly, but the white chocolate still cannot be tasted.

Great dessert for a special occasion. I went with raspberries to offset the white chocolate's sweetness. And inspired by another recipe, I burried frozen (they probably could've been fresh) raspberries in the middle of the white chocolate mixture. Tasted great, but it did leave a small chalky feel. Did anyone else experience that ? I'm thinking I might have poured the syrup too quickly in the egg whites (plus I doubled the recipe to make 2 terrines).

Delicious dessert and perfect for the summer time, also a unique dessert. But keep in mind that you will dirty up allot of bowls, spoons and spatulas. I would also use the best quality white chocolate you can find{Valrhona, Callebaut, Lindt}. Make sure to add a pinch of salt to the entire mixture, it makes a huge difference in brining out the flavour. I plan to make this dessert again, I just wish it would not require washing so many bowls{about 5}.

I've made this for many summer parties since this recipe was published. It is tasty, interesting to make, feeds plenty of people and is convenient to make ahead of time.

Not difficult, a little time consuming and yes, you do use a lot of bowls, but it is worth it. Everyone loved it. I am making it for the second time and I'm going to try it with raspberries.

Although one of those desserts that requires you use alot of bowls etc. it was easy to make and very impressive. My family really loved it.
