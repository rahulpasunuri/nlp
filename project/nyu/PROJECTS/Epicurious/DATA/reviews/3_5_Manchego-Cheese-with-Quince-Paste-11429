I find the smaller the bites of cheese and quince paste the better. I also put chopped pistachios on the quince paste. Press it in just slightly so it doesn't fall off when people pick it up. It will stick on the quince paste nicely. Looks pretty and balances the flavors very nicely. One bite morsels speared with toothpicks works well. Served it tonight and using 12 mo. old Manchego and it was a big hit with everyone present. (Even bigger than the shrimp!)

What's not to love about this awesome cheese and it's ideal accompaniment?

Easy to make and elegant presentation (I did triangles of cheese with smaller triangles of paste on top). Nice but not out of this world.

This is sooo good. And simple. Wish I knew a way to cut the paste. This is a 4 forker because you can have both the cheese & the paste on hand. The paste lasts FOREVER! Well--maybe a year or two.

This was an easy and pleasant recipe to prepare. The cheese and quince complemented each other beautifully.

Over the holidays I had a tapas party and made tons of recipes from this site. Unfortunately, this was the only one that didn't get rave reviews. The cheese is fantastic, but the quince was way too sweet. Maybe if I used thinner slices it wouldn't have overpowered the flavor of the manchego.

Yum. Great flavor combo. Did anyone find an easy and quick way to slice the quince paste? I found it a bit tricky to handle.

Quick & easy, this makes a pretty presentation as well. Nice combination of salty & sweet. Got both ingredients at Whole Foods - next to each other in the cheese section. Definitely not run-of-the-mill which adds zest to a tapas gathering!

This is delicious and easy - even finding the quince paste was easy, except now I have to find other recipes to use up the remainder! I served these as part of a tapas menu and the guests all loved them.

Served at monthly Chick Night dinner, delightful. I found this a nice selection when the other appetizers are complicated. Qunice paste sold at Whole foods right next to the Manchego Cheese. Also a good dessert.

This is such a great combination! I found the quince paste in a Southern Texas chain food store in the special foods section. Great to keep on hand!

This was simply the most understated appetizer ever. and utterly awesome. For those cooks in Calgary, quince paste is available at the Cookbook Company cooks. The cheese is available there too or at Janice Beaton.

Very yummy and good with a bottle of Zin or Red Burgundy. You can find quince paste at Whole Foods (SF, Mill Valley) - check in cheese department.

For the San Francisco reviewer... I know that Draeger's in the South Bay sells quince paste.

I know it sounds odd, but I swear you can buy quince paste from the Neiman Marcus catalog as well. You can also use the quince paste to make delicious dessert empanadas (sprinkle puff pastry generously with sugar before popping in the oven.) This is also a very traditional Argentine dessert.

If you can't find membrillo just substitute according to a Spanish refrain, "Uvas con queso saben a besos" Grapes with cheese taste like kisses.

middle eastern stores sell quince jam- spread on a crostini and top with cheese. Or try fig spread which is often carried by speciality shops.

GOOD LUCK finding the elusive "quince paste" for this one! I checked Williams-Sonoma and 5 specialty food shops (in San Francisco no less)and couldn't obtain any! Why does Epicurious bother to list a recipe that calls for ingredients that are essentially impossible to locate? Food snobbbery at its worst.

I have seen quince paste for sale at Williams-Sonoma, in their catalog.

Hey Scottsdale, Where do you find quince paste? I checked at AJ's and all they had was quince preserves. Will that work?

This is a perfect appetizer! Quick, easy and unique. All of my guests loved it.
