This is such an excellent recipe. Sometimes i make the dough the night before (or almost always in the morning) and let it rise in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator. Take it out, let it come to room temperature and then braid away -- or more often make challah rolls. I liked the recipe so much tha i bought Maggie Glezer's books. She is a real gem for sharing this winner with us!

Anyone else notice that the yield is wrong? yield: Makes two 1-pound (450-gram) challahs, one 1 1/2-pound (680-gram) Ummmm...I don't think so, not unless someone has figured a way to defy the law of conservation of mass. :-) This recipe should make either one 2-pound or two 1-pound loaves, OR one 1.5 lb loaf or two .75 lb loaves. Just saying. In any case, it's still my go-to challah recipe.

I used half the sugar and added honey. I used half the oil and the other half replaced with butter. I used the saffron. Fantastic challah.

This is the first time I have ever made bread and it turned out wonderfully!

This is amazing bread - we are big butter fans so we use melted butter as a substitute for the oil. It is wonderful.

Perfect challah! I made 6 rolls and froze the rest so all I need to do is pop them in the tins and raise and bake next time I want a small amount of challah.

The easiest and most foolproof challah I ever made. The dough is not super sticky like other challahs and is easy to handle. I make the dough in triple quantities and freeze it so I can have challah whenever I want it (just thaw for 3 hours and let rise once before baking). This is now my go-to challah recipe!

Wow, this is a delicious recipe! I wanted to bake challah to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, but since I'd never made it before (or any bread really), I was nervous that it wouldn't come out as expected. The recipe is so easy and the bread turned out moist, flaky, rich, and sweet. I made two spiral loaves with golden raisins. To ensure the loaves didn't dry out while baking (the dough already seemed a bit dry going in) I placed a baking dish full of water in the oven on the bottom rack which may have helped provide some moisture. Will DEFINITELY make again - much to the appreciation of my roomates and co-workers.

This is a much easier recipe than a lot of other recipes which take much longer and require more technique. And the results are the same. For those who say it lacks flavor, try adding a little bit of honey, sugar or a bit of extra salt and you will get rich, flavorful challah. This is my new standard challah recipe!

Delicious. Rich and moist. I made the dough in my bread machine, then rolled out six strands, & braided them as shown in a "youtube" video I found online. I let the braided challah rise for an hour, & baked it for 35 minutes at 350.

I used to make Moosewood challah often,and didn't have the recipe on hand. This was a respectable bread but nothing to write home about. I like my challah whispy and rich. This was a little more crumby in texture and drier.

Having made many a loaf of bread I wanted a quick and easy loaf for Easter. Sadly, this is not it. I should have been tipped off by the use of oil instead of butter. I thought the bread was flavorless. I didn't have any problems with the dough or anything else in the recipe. It just lacked flavor. Rose Beranbaum has an amazing recipe (just a bit time consuming). There has to be a middle ground. I'll keep looking.

I had to add a ton of extra flour in order to get this to be a dough instead of a gloppy mess. We're talking probably a cup of flour, although I wasn't measuring as I was frantically pouring flour onto the dough, having my sig. other run to the neighbors to borrow more as my hands were covered in a yeasty disaster, and having to add whole wheat flour because said neighbors weren't home. I was scared that because I worked with the dough so much that it would affect the end product. Despite the flour emergency, this challah turned out wonderfully! After fermenting, the dough was the perfect texture and very easy to braid. I made one loaf with a 4-strand braiding technique, baking for 35 minutes. The color is beautiful. Having to add whole wheat flour was perhaps a blessing in disguise as it added a nice depth and complexity that is often lacking from challah. My fear of bread-baking has been cured, thanks to this recipe!

I live at 6000 ft above sea level. This challah always comes out perfect up here every time. The dough is easy to work with and I braid it a million different ways. The end result is rich and sweet every time. Thanks to Maggie Glezer for posting this recipe. Mazel Tov!

Amazing! I made this for "Christmas" dinner, with regular all-purpose flour. It was super easy, and really yummy.

Rating: 4
This recipe was SUPER easy and received many rave reviews from everyone who tasted it. I mixed the dough in two parts in the food processor. That worked quite well. I found a 6-strand braiding technique video online and finished the bread that way. I'll be making this at least every other week throughout the winter!

I have had many failed experiences making challah until I made this recipe. This bread was absolutely delicious and a hit at Rosh Hashanah dinner. Thank you for sharing.

I've made this twice so far. The first time, I made it "plain" using the unmodified recipe. It turned out great. The second time, I used the raisin variation, only instead of raisins, I used the same amount of finely chopped dried apricots, (since my family doesn't care for raisins.) That loaf turned out AMAZING! Highly recommended.

From a baker who tries at least one or two new bread recipes a week, I say surely, that this is a solid recipe for taste, texture and visuals.

I have been using the excellent Silver Palate recipe for challah for many years, and then it hit me that, with milk and butter in it, this was not the way my bubbah made challah for Shabbos back in the day. It had to have been made without dairy. This recipe, and the 4-fork reviews, inspired me yesterday to give this a try, and both husband and I are delighted with the result. I appreciate the weight measurements of the ingredients, and used my digital scale to weigh everything in grams. Rather than kneading by hand, I used the dough hook on my KA mixer. After the initial two-hour rise, I punched the dough down,cut into 5 equal pieces, and made one large 5-braid loaf. Then put it in the fridge overnight (since it was 9pm at the time). This morning, after a two-hour second rising, glazing with egg wash, and sprinkling of poppy seeds, I baked for just 30 minutes on center rack of oven using convection setting. This produced the best challah ever- deep golden brown crust, delicately sweet, and lovely texture for either eating plain, as the basis for a sandwich, or - if any left over - for French toast. Will definitely be using this one from now on.

I made rolls. Next time I'll double the recipe. Just delicious, perfect challah! I used a dough hook, the dough was a little wet when I turned it out but I went with it and after rising it was perfect to work with. Easy and delicious- after a lifetime of eating challah I assure you that this is 'the recipe'.

When asked to make the challah for shabbos last week, we were warned that no one really eats challah and instead its generally used for french toast the next morning......so we were prepared for general failure. BUT everyone ate this challah! And they loved it! I guess thats the best recommendation I can give.

Great, basic recipe. A few tips if it's not coming out the way you planned: 1) Use a baking stone 2) Make the saffron variation (I did it without any extra ingredients except the saffron). 3) Use a 6-strand braid as seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22p3wIHLupc

While this challah is good, it's certainly not one of the best that I've ever made. I found it to be a little on the drier side, which is not characteristic of a good challah. I highly highly recommend the following recipe... http://www.jewishfood-list.com/recipes/bread/honeybread01.html

Beautiful, manageable challah for this first time challah maker. It felt pretty great to make a successful challah for my family's shabbos (and my parents were bursting). Anyway, two tips: look at how people braid challah on youtube. The written instructions are confusing and seeing it in action makes it much clearer. Also, don't be afraid to really knead the dough. It makes a firmer dough that will hold the braid better. Good Luck!

This is delicious challah! I mixed some cinnamon and sugar in with my egg wash and it added a really nice flavour. Thanks for a great recipe -- it's my husband's new favourite.

Wonderful and relatively easy to make. It is delicious! I made it with raisins in the Pinwheel shape for Rosh Hashanah. What a hit!! I immediately ordered her book. Also, the history of this bread seems to add to it's beauty and significance as well.

I love making bread but had never made a challah before. However I have eaten many different types of challah, on different occasions. I am so lucky I found this recipe first. It was awesome and eaten very quickly. Thank you so much for this recipe.

wow, this was really nice. the braid spread a bit when i baked it and didn't rise as high as some other challah. made it with all-purp flour, totally fine. beautiful color inside and out. REALLy tender inside.

I can't believe I made such a great Challah. I've been trying new recipes each week, but once I made this my search ended. I add raisins, as directed, in one loaf and leave the other plain. It's wonderful.

This is the best Challah I or anyone who tries it has ever had. For time's sake, making the dough in a bread machine and finishing it by hand is helpful. I generally make two loaves out of this
