Very good! Only thing was the sauce was a bit runny. I'd reduce the sauce longer or start with less broth. The mushroom mixture was fantastic! I made horseradish mashed instead. Went over well!

This recipe wins rave reviews from company every time we serve it. We use Herbes de Provance instead of marjoram, no leeks, onions instead of shallots, and serve it with polenta rather than mashed potatoes.

Delicious! Made this without any substitutions and was very pleased with the outcome. Wonderful flavor combinations and presentation. I do agree with other reviewers that doubling the sauce is a good idea. This recipe is a keeper.

Butterfly the tenderloins - then roll up and tie with stuffing inside - so much easier. You can use both tenderloins this way - one on top of the other. Added chopped tyme and sage to the mushrooms ---

Excellent. Modified slightly by adding some garlic, shallots, little cayenne for some spice and black olives to the stuffing when cooking. Used a whole butterflied tenderloin and spread the stuffing out on it and then put a layer of shredded parmesean cheese prior to rolling it up. Next time may add some prosicutto. Overall very good and had no left overs. Served with a wild rice.

I made this last night as a casserole or sort of shepherd's pie. I didn't want to shell out almost $7.00 lb for the tenderloin at my local market, so got pork "stir fry" instead. Made stuffing with a combination of portobello & shitake and used just a splash of half and half instead of the cream. Made the Port sauce and the celery root potato mixture pretty much as written. Then I sauteed the pork pieces and added a little of the sauce while scraping up the browned bits. I put the pork on the bottom of a souffle dish, reduced the sauce a bit more and then poured it over the pork. The next layer was the mushroom/leek mixture which I topped with the potoates. I set it in a 400 oven for about 20 minutes. Although I would prefer a little less of the celeriac (try parsnips instead?) my boyfriend says this is a keeper. Have to say the stuffing is really nice. The goofy, thankful smile I kept getting from the boyfriend all during dinner, along with his invlountary chirps of delight was great too.

As one who tends to lean toward more sweet accents for pork, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this savory recipe. The mushrooms were an excellent complement to the pork. I did pull in a bit of sweetness by following other reviewers suggestions to add dried figs to the sauce, I also added 1/4 cup of half and half to create a richer consistency. I used thyme from my garden instead of marjoram on the pork. I served this with roasted carrots and brussels sprouts and a spinah salad with roasted beets and chevre. It was a light yet comforting fall meal that would certainly impress any guest.

Fannnnnntastic! Made it without the stuffing, since I didn't have the ingredients and it was still delicious. Going to try it again next week the "real" way! The celeriac in the mash was a lovely complement.

Tasted really good, mashed potatoes as well. I will probably not "stuff" the loin next time but will roll it instead. It was comical getting the filling into the loin. The entertainment factor may have jaded my family's palates.

I made this years ago for my wife on Valentine's Day. She loved it so much that I've made it numerous times for friends and family. I added some crumbled gorgonzola to the leek/mushroom mixture. Plus I added some coursely chopped dried figs to the sauce about 15 minutes before it was done. The figs add a slightly sweet taste which complements the port wine used. I've made this with and without figs but everybody I've made it for prefers the figs. I also use fresh thyme instead of marjoram. Enjoy!

This was excellent. I used the butterfly method and can not imagine trying the other way. This is a bit time consuming, if I were doing this for guests I would make the sauce and fill and tie the tenderloin in advance. The clean the kitchen. When guest arrived I would finish the prep.

This was very good, but I had a couple of problems. I'm not too crazy about canned beef broth, especially with MSG. I looked at a few websites, including Cooks' Illustrated, for ratings of canned broth. The one they recommended - Pacific, I believe - wasn't available. I bought a small container of "More than Gourmet" brand demi-glace (1.5 oz) and dissolved it in a cup of water. It has a decent taste, but nothing like homemade, and I felt that the slightly artificial taste permeated the sauce. I did make a tunnel in the tenderloin using the long metal thing for sharpening knives (sorry - can't remember the proper name for it). I was dubious about how well the mushroom mixture was getting in there, so I butterflied the tenderloins with the mushroom stuffing inside. The thing is, the mushroom stuffing got lost. Where did it go? It fell out of the tenderloins, but I didn't see a great amount of "debris" in the bottom of my roasting pan, either. I wonder if it would be possible to have the butcher cut the tenderloin very flat so that the filling could be rolled up. Or maybe next time I'll give the "tunnel" a try. But I'll definitely make my own beef stock, or at least give the Pacific brand a try.

This was excellent....good enough for company. Like others, I split the pork, stuffed it and tied. Seemed much easier than the suggested method of stuffing. I used merlot instead of port, 1/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream, onions instead of shallots and portabella mushrooms. I only added 1/2 the butter to the sauce at the end. One suggestion, double the sauce. Doesn't make quite enough. I will absolutely make this again, good enough to serve to my restaurant owner/chef friend!

Absolutely Delicious~! I also just butterflied the tenderloin, stuffed & tied it, left it rustic, and went from there. Since there are only two of us (the cat won't eat pork tenderloin), I made one tenderloin yet kept the stuffing & sauce quantities the same - taking the suggestion that "there should only be more sauce". Served with the suggested Celeriac / potato mash, and a simple salad of mixed greens & an EVO, lime juice & dijon viniagrette. A Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon was the perfect compliment. Thanks for the recipe & suggestions~! Will definitely add this to the repertoire......

Another rave review! Just made it for Sunday dinner (butterfly method, with slightly larger chopped veggies) and loved it. Had to cook 14 min. at 400 instead of 8 min. Used far less butter for the sauce, so next time will double the beef/chicken/port at the beginning to make for more sauce. Tried the celery root mashed potatoes, too. Loved the combination.

Great dish for our annual Valentine's Dinner Party. I made it once in advance and decided it needed a little something so I sauteed the mushrooms and leeks in wine before adding the cream and tossed a tsp of thyme into the filling, tasted great! We opted for the butterfly method so the mushrooms could be diced not puree. Will do again

Oh my! This dish was superb. Pork tenderloin is one of my favourite meats. For simplicity sake I butterflied the pork, but changed nothing else. The stuffing and sauce were delicious!

I found the stuffing was not that impressive and very little was able to fit into the tenderloin. I loved the sauce and from now on I make the tenderloin with just the port sauce and it is great.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! I have made it twice using the butterfly/tying method which is a pain, but my boyfriend has been in charge of that part and does a great job! The sauce is excellent and the last time I put the butter in just after it had reduced, then set it aside (on accident) but it turned out better. If you haven't already, give this one a try!

Rating: 3
This is good, but the method needs a change in a couple of verbs to make this recipe work. If you puree (not chop) the leeks and mushrooms, you might just have a mixture when you're done that will actually make its way through a piping bag nozzle. As well, follow the advice of the reviewer below who used creme fraiche to finish the sauce instead of butter. Tinned stock reduces to watery sauce. As for poking a hole in the tenderloin ... the hole pokes more often through the side of the tenderloin than just the other end. Be on guard for these perils: do what you can to make the stuffing as smooth as possible; be careful poking the hole, and, as others have noted, be prepared to thicken the sauce with something, and cook the tenderloin for at least 20 minutes @ 400 degrees. Then enjoy a fine meal.

Rating: 3
The sauce was fantastic, I overcooked the meat a little, so it was a bit dry. Also, as most mentioned, I thing the string method will work much better than the pastry filling method. But I will definitely make again.

This meal was a hit, definately will make it again. I used home made stock which made the sauce richer tasting.

This was very good. The only draw back - it did not finish in the oven with just 8 minutes additional roasting time - it took more like a half an hour for well done. Fortunately I had planned ahead for that and had accompanying dishes that could stay warm while we waited for the entree to finish. Also, to get a nice thick sauce, I finished preparing the sauce with cream fraiche rather than butter. It was delicious.

I have made this several times with very high praise from my guests. They always want the recipe. I have tried butterflying the tenderloin and pushing a hole through the center with a wooden handle. I find the second option to be easier, neater and slices more beautifully for a professional presentation.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful way to prepare a boring tenderloin. The presentation was great, and the port sauce is sinful! I did add extra garlic to the sauce. My best friend fought us over the leftovers, and then he had to fight off his co-workers the next day! The port sauce is wonderful with prime rib also.

i wonder if i stuffed it with spinach how it would taste i also would use sweet potato puree instead of celery root potatoes , if anyone tries that write me and let me know how it turns out.

I prepared this for company and everyone (myself included) was VERY impressed, it was delicious! For a much more dramatic presentation; rather than slicing the meat into discs, slice it in half crosswise then cut each 1/2 in 1/2 again but on a sharp angle rather than straight across (thai spring rolls are sometimes cut this way). Pool or spiral some sauce in the centre of each plate then stand two quarters (on thier flat end)in the sauce and arrange side dishes around.

This was very good. We are always looking for new and different ideas for pork tenderloins. And this was a good one. I followed the recipe, except for a few alterations. Took the lead of other reviewers and butterflied the tenderloin and filled and closed and tied. And I finished it in a hot grill (350-400 of indirect heat), instead of the oven, for about 15 minutes. I also substituted Marsala for the port, and think the sauce would be good with other spirits too... sherry, cabernet, etc. Would also be good with a different herb than the marjoram, though our fresh marjoram was delicious as it was. Definitely a keeper!

This was great -- well actually my version of it was -- I was looking for something to do with a pork tenderloin and happened to have white mushrooms and whipping cream around. I used mushrooms and chopped dried rosemary and the whipping cream to make the stuffing (ie mushrooms in a rosemary cream), butterflied the tenderloin and then stuffed. Server with broccoli and mashed potatoes and a brown gravy. My husband said you could hardly get anything this good in a restaurant -- which is a major compliment from him!

I butterflied the pork and tied it as others recommended. I substituted skim milk for the cream and added 2 tbsp breadcrumbs to thicken the filling and added some green peppercorns. I used veal demi-glace (www.gatewaygormet.com) instead of the beef stock and only 1 tsp butter. It was incredible. The pork was tender and the stuffing was tasty and the sauce was great. Would definitely make it again.

Maybe I'm the oddball, but I thought this dish was pretty boring. The flavors were very bland. One tip: I simplified the stuffing process by cutting a flap into the side of the tenderloin with a sharp knife. It makes things faster and easier and allows you to add more stuffing (for the most part it won't fall out). Make sure you correct the seasonings in the stuffing - salt and fresh ground pepper is called for.

I used this as the entre for a gala dinner for 175 and it was spectacular! I took the advice of the cook who butterflied the tenderloin and tied it with string and that is defnitely the way to go. I used a combination of portobello and white mushrooms for the filling and they gave it a meaty texture and taste. I accompanied it with cous cous with roasted tomatoes & zuccini and green beans with lemon & pecans. The prep work was significant (especially cooking for 175), but the results were well worth the effort. Makes a delicious and elegant presentation.

Rating: 4
This was really good and I had a lot of fun with the piping bag (!) - lovely messy job but well worth it and very satisfying to make as everyone was impressed with the presentation. One point though, 4 tablespoons of butter in sauce at end sounded too much, so made a paste of flour and butter and whisked in which thickened up sauce really well. Make this dish, you won't be disappointed.

This is a great recipe. The stuffing mix was excellent; I only wish there was room for more. Next time I plan to butterfly the tenderloin so I can use more mushrooms. The sauce was awesome, although I used cabernet instead of port. This one is a restaurant quality.

Very yummy, esp the mushroom mixture. I had some difficulties with the execution -- my tenderloins were too narrow to stuff so I butterflied and tied with string as suggested. I served with mashed root vegetables (Emeril's recipe) and steamed carrots. I had doubled the recipe and used extra mushrooms with hamburgers later in week -- excellent use of leftovers!

I made this dish for companu and it was absolutely amazing! I altered it a bit by butterflying the pork and pounding it with a meat tenderizer. I then put the stuffing down the center and tied up the sides with string. It worked out well and there was a nice distribution of filling throughout the pork. This is a WINNER!

This was absolutely delicious. The pork was so tender and juicy and the flavour of the sauce was incredible. We just loved it!! I didn't have any port, so I used a good red wine. I also used regular button mushrooms. I served it with cheddar cheese, chives and garlic mashed potatoes and this went very well with just some steamed broccoli as a vegetable. I would serve this proudly at a dinner party. We had leftovers of this a day later and I think it was even better the second time around.

Great Recipe... I used half shiitake and half baby portabello mushrooms. I used Sweet Marsala and extra garlic. I had guests over for dinner and they are still raving about 4 days later. It was fast and easy, and the spoon trick with the tenderloins was perfect!!! Yum Yum!!

This dish was excellent. I made it with a center cut pork tenderloin (larger in diameter than what was called for) so it was easier to stuff. The sauce was simple easy and delicious. This is a keeper for company or for a mid-week meal!

My family adored this dish! I did not have port, so I used Marsala. I also did not make the celery root mashed potatoes (made garlic cheddar mashed potatoes instead). Perhaps it was my oven, but I found a 12 minute cooking time to be just right. The one warning I would give is that the prep time took me longer than I had anticipated (cleaning the leeks, etc.) Plan on this taking an hour from start to serve -- which in my family means it's a better weekend meal.

Very good, but not great. I found the stuffing a little bland. The back of the wooden spoon trick works surprisingly well. I didn't have a pastry bag so I used a turkey baster to insert the stuffing. Already made it again using differnt stuffing, cheese and mushrooms I think. Came out a little better.

This is an excellent recipe. A nice variation which adds a lot of flavor is to substitute finely chopped prunes for the mushrooms, really! An easy way to stuff the loin is to make the hole with the honing steel used to hone your kitchen knives.

This recipe is incredible. My husband was very impressed with the flavors. I used a boning knife to make a pocket in the pork loin which was an easy way to stuff the filling. It was beautiful!

This was fantastic even though I varied it a great deal due to lack of the right ingredients! I didn't have ruby port and used sherry instead. I didn't have shallots and used a combo of onions and garlic. I used dry shitake mushrooms and used some of the soaking liquid in place of part of the broth. I also deglazed the mushrooms with a shot of sherry before adding the cream (very tasty). The stuffing sounded intimidating, but it was easier than I expected because the tenderloin is so soft. The presentation was gorgeous and the flavor outstanding! Perfect for impressing guests with both looks and taste. I can't wait to try it again with all the right ingredients and see if it is even better. I agree with other reviewers about a cooking time of around 20-25 minutes instead of 8.

We used a regular pork loin roast instead of the tenderloin. We split the roast, spread the stuffing, rolled, & tied it. The presentation of the stuffed pork loin was very nice. It took longer to roast to get the internal temperature to 160 degrees (up to 170 after resting). I would also double the liquids for the sauce to make more. It was delicious served with garlic-roasted mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli or roasted asparagus. Definitely a keeper! A great dinner party meal.

So Good!! Any mushrooms will do, even button. Its easier to make the hole in the tenderloin with your fingers and force the stuffing in by hand too. Also, I double the liquids for the sauce (Everyone always wants more sauce). Instead of the potatoes, I love serving this dish with wide buttered egg noodles tossed with some fresh herbs.

This is by far the best pork tenderlion recipe I have ever made. Although I had a little difficulty stuffing the tenderlion, it was worth it.

Cooking time int oven was more like 20-30 mins. The sauce I used was the Balsamic Vinegar & Cranberry (in the recipes)and thought the cranberries gave this meal a kick. The shitake mushrooms didn't provide much flavour. Could have benefitted from a herb rub.
