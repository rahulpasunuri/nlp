Fantastic salad. I haven't been this excited about a salad that I've made in a long time. I swapped out the apple for a pear, and it went great with the endives.

Fantastic Mix of textures and flavors...I followed it to the letter except I doubled dressing ;)

this is truly delicious. Simple to make with room for changes. I used granny smith, red and white endives, and pitachios for nuts. Made little "boats" instead of chopping everything. It went really well with pork, celery root puree, and lentils from this site. Like the entree, this is restaurant quality.

I have made this many times. The dressing is terrific. I usually double because it is so tasty I'll have some for another time. Make sure you drizzle the honey over the top. Adds another dimension and gives it a little elegant touch!

Double the dressing? Heck, triple it. Not nearly enough. But other than that a refreshing, easy-to-make salad.

refreshing and light. definitly double the dressing...I used thick, aged, delicious balsamic and it made the difference in the dressing. Used blue cheese. Loved the drizzled honey over all. Next time I will candy the nuts.

Delicious, I made for valentines day and it was great for presentation and taste. I used the 2 tsp of honey to candy the walnuts (heated the honey in a pan until boiling then rolled the walnuts in the honey).

You definitely have to double the dressing. This is a great salad. Even my relatives who consider endive exotic and scary loved it.

i doubled the dressing and it was just right. definitely cut the apple right before serving and more gorganzola. next time,i would pan toast pecans with honey for a divine result and skip the honey drizzling. presentation was lovely.

This was delicious, but we highly recommend the tweaks that we made to the recipe: --Double the amount of dressing (had to drizzle it on in order to have enough for four people). --Double the amount of gorgonzola cheese --Add craisins or--better yet--dried cherries to the salad --Use pecans instead of walnuts. For a real treat, use candied pecans. We would definitely make this again...it was easy to make and our guests loved it.

I love this salad! The contrast of the sweet dressing/honey and the gorgonzola is awesome. Super easy, especially if you don't toast the walnuts.

This is fantastic. I would not make it as the previous reviewer stated, by just tossing everthing together...it would not be the same. Made as written and it was excellent.

This is really good, but tastes no different than the standard mixture of bleu cheese or gorgonzola, with walnuts, balsamic, olive oil and a touch of sugar......no need to whisk. Throw them all in on on top of the salad and toss....same result.

This dressing is absolutely delicious. I've used it on many different salads.

Big return on very little effort. I also use the dressing on many types of salads--it has become one of my favorite all-purpose dressings.

Fantastic salad. Wonderful flavor. A must-try if you like gorgonzola. I don't usually go to the trouble of making my own dressings, but I did for this salad and it complemented the flavors very well and was worth the effort.

I thought this was a very tasty, light and easy salad. We tried roasted pecans instead of walnuts and it was very good.

Loved the gorgonzola cheese with the mixture of the apples and toasted walnuts. Great texture. Next time will make more of the cider and balsamic vinegar dressing.

Delicious and easy. The flavors are wonderful; we tried this with Stilton and loved it. I would cut the apple as late as possible to avoid browning.
