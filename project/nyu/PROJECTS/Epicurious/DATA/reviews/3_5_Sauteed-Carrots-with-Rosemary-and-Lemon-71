These are really delicious. I was almost dissuaded by the reviewers that said they were bland. I didn't find them bland at all and so glad I tried them. They are easy and really flavorful. What a great combination of flavors. I used baby carrots since I had them on hand. Pretty, light, and delicious!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner. My family was not terribly fond of these carrots. I guess it's hard to beat cooked vegetables dressed simply with butter, salt and pepper.

As simple and bland as it sounds, this is a great side dish. The flavor is simple yet rounded, and goes really well with steak (I cooked it with "Marinated Filet of Beef). The texture of the carrots is similar to potato and so it is easy to leave starch out of the meal. As always, I increased the garlic by a clove or two.

Nice! Use fresh rosemary for a lovely aromatic flavor. Very easy side dish for Christmas dinner. Went well with standing rib roast.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have lemon peel so used fresh orange peel and orange juice instead. Only used about 1 T. butter. The flavors mingled well and weren't overpowering so made a great side dish. Will definitely make again!

I can't believe how easy and good this was. A wonderful side dish.

This was very simple to prepare and very tasty. I also added an onion while sauteing the garlic, which added some variety of flavour, texture, and colour. Definitely a great way to spice up some carrots.

Light and refreshing. Next time, I also will try increasing the rosemary, lemon, and garlic. I think this is a 2-serving recipe.

This is a tasty sidedish, my only comment is that I found it enough for four servings not two.

This is the best carrot recipe I've ever tasted. I made it for a dinner party and it was the most popular dish of the evening. The carrots are light and wonderfully flavorable, and were so simple to make! I steamed a bag of fresh baby carrots in the microwave before my guests arrived. When dinner time rolled around, I melted a little butter in a frying pan, tossed in the carrots, and squeezed about 1/2 a lemon on top. I topped it with a couple sprigs of chopped fresh rosemary, stirred, and wow!!!!! Fragrant and fresh and delicious. I already received requests for the recipe. I will make this again and again. It really is the best.

I increased this recipe to serve 12 for our thanksgving dinner, but next time I think I will add just a little more lemon and rosemary. The flavors were wonderful, but did not come through strongly enough for my liking... I love the combination! What a great way to add carrots to the menu!

I made this recipe when my parents and sister came to visit. Everyone thought it was the best carrot dish they had ever eaten. I will definitely make it again and again.

I served this with Christmas dinner to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It was fast and easy to make but didn't taste like it. I cooked the carrots tender rather than tender crisp. The carrots probably could be cooked and the sauce made in the morning or even the night before and then combined and reheated just before serving to save time when preparing a company dinner.

A last minute addition to my Thanksgiving menu -- quite the hit for my vegetarian sister. She took my copy of the recipe.
