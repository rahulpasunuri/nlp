Everytime I make this Cake..it has been a hit. Its light texture has my guests licking their plates asking for more.

I made this as a quick summer treat and it was just perfect! Light and not too sweet, and the lemon taste was so refreshing. I beat the egg whites by hand, not with an electric mixer, which I think was a good thing... I tend to overbeat. I will definitely be making it again.

Very tasty dessert. I'm a big fan of lemony desserts and this is a good lowfat option. Although, I did cut back on the sugar the second time I tried it. The sweetness was a bit overpowering. Individual cakes in ramekins is a variation I will try next time. Easier to serve that way.

Delicious! My family absolutely loved it. Made exactly as specified, however, I did not make the syrup. Served it instead with slightly sweetened homemade whipped cream to cut the tartness just a little bit. Will be making this again!

Yuck. I didn't like this at all, neither did 2 of the 3 people I served it to. It was too eggy.

We found this to be an easy and impressive dessert that is good for the middle of the week or for guests. I cooked mine in a loaf pan with no difficulty and served the pudding cake with warm blackberries that had been soaked in blackberry liqueur. We'll be making this again and again.

This is a very light and tasty dessert. I had to make the caramel sauce twice because the first time I cooked the sugar too far and burned it, but I was careful the second try and it turned out wonderfully. It was worth the effort.

For the best Lemon Pudding Cake you'll ever eat, do try the recipe provided by Tony of Fresno, CA on 1/26/03, listed in reviews under Lemon Pudding Cake with Raspberry Sauce, on this site. My review of Tony's recipe is also shown. There can be no better recipe anywhere for this dessert.

We served this "cake"for the first time after a meal of chicken piri-piri - a firey South African marinaded chicken. It was delicious - lemony and soothing after the heat of the chicken. For lemon lovers, you can't beat this light, low-fat dessert!

I made this dessert for Easter and it was pretty good. Nice for something different. I made a full recipe and served the complete dish of cake to the four of us. I think serving six would have been a little skimpy. I made the sauce with the cranberries and didn't have any troubles. It tasted tart and good and made the plated dessert pretty. We did find the cake texture a little odd and I probably won't make it again.

We loved this cake, easy, low fat and delicious. I didn't think the cranberry sauce sounded to appetizing so I tried the sauce with raspberries instead and it was inedible, it tasted burnt. I assumed I did burn it so I made it twice! What did I do wrong? I ended up using a plain raspberry sauce that I had frozen from another dessert recipe.

This is really a great recipe, it was delicious and fresh tasting. And i didnt have to go out just to buy the ingredients to make it. My family loved it as well. my father rated it as an 8 out of 10. My mom thought raspberry sauce would have been better than cranberry.

I served this cake (double recipe) to a group of 10, and it was delicious. It is light and lemony tasting--very fresh--and the cranberry syrup is surprisingly perfect as a complement. A wonderful and satisfying dessert after a heavy or a light meal.

Good lemony flavor and a pretty presentation. The cake puffed nicely but browned too quickly. Next time I'd tent it with foil halfway through. I made the sauce first and was concerned as it didn't make much and was rather sour. It went perfectly with the cake though, a great counterpart.

To the previous cook, the tip on the other page is on how to cook with a water bath. Just place your filled pan inside a larger pan. Pour hot water into the larger pan, until the water level hits about half-way up the smaller one. Bake as directed. This method gently cooks the cake.

How are we supposed to make this cake if we do not have page 166 in the book?
