Serve with clementines!

I really can't understand someone saying that the jarred chestnuts are comparable. I guess if you don't want to make any effort for quality then they are a substitute. But this was not much work and very much worth the effort. Not to mention half the price of jarred.

After many years of making chestnuts, some of which batches worked out and many that did not I tried a combination of steaming them after cutting the X (15-20 min.) then roasting them after that having oiled and salted them (but the other additions of spices or herbs sound nice) then wrapping in a towel. It has worked twice this year! It will be the way I do then from now on

I did 3 batches--one following this recipe, one with olive oil and rosemary, and one with butter and cinnamon and sugar. I surprisingly liked the latter the most--nice to add sweetness to them. In general, though, I don't think I'm personally a huge chestnuts fan. I squeezed out the nuts from the shells--and then put them in a ziploc bag overnight. They were like rocks the next day...any tips on how to store? Should I not shell them until I eat them?

The best tip with this recipe's instructions is to use the dishtowel. When it says to "squeeze", take each chestnut through the towel and crack the shell beyond the x to allow the steam to reach farther inside the shell. I left them in the towel for 5 min. as was suggested. This made shelling so much easier. Careful not to smash them when you squeeze. Yum! Such a unique flavor. This recipe makes it easy to love them.

I'd never had chestnuts before so I thought I'd try them out thinking they might be a great holiday tradition. I followed the directions, cooking times, etc. The shells didn't "peel back," but with a little work I was able to open them. They taste a lot like potatoes. They do. I probably won't make them again but it was an interesting experiment.

Mediacy: Why not try those ideas that you had and let us know how it comes out? I see some people talking about soaking ahead of time. Some people talking about drinking port with them. Yum. I've had roasted chestnuts that my Dad put in the oven. Then we just ate them plain right out of the shells. Usually with dessert, and sometimes with wine after dinner. I bet these would be PERFECT with port. Anybody do anything different? Tell the rest of us. What else works well? Some brandy perhaps? Have I seen rum soaked chestnuts in jars before? If you do spice them up, how do you do it? I'm almost tempted to try peeling some and then tossing them in some cinnamon and butter with a little brown sugar.

Good, but a bit basic. They came out a bit dry, and it would be nice to have the option to drizzle oil/water on them to add moisture, and perhaps add some nutmeg or other spices to jazz things up...I'm not a good enough cook to dare do these things on my own!

I am happy I read the reviews before I started this project! I had no idea of how much tedious work this is! I agree with the person who said they would gladly pay for the chestnuts already peeled! Unfortunately, I peeled for 4 hours to get the job done! No fun, but I would do it again if I was unable to find them frozen. I have to also tell you I peeled 7 lbs of them. The tip to re-warm them in the microwave for a few seconds really did help speed the process. We must commission Trader Joe's to carry frozen ones every winter. They did not carry them this year and they supplied me in years past.

i like to cut the tops off, soak in very hot water for 1hr then roast for 30mins. then use a clean dishcloth to shell the hot nuts - the steam from the water helps loosen the hairy skin so it comes right off. no sore fingertips from picking at the skin!

Every autumn we eagerly await the fresh harvest of chestnuts! I make one slight change - tossing them in just a touch of olive oil & sea salt before roasting. There is something special about sharing them - they are such a basic, satisfying earthy treat. The perfect ending to a chilly evening, after a lovely dinner, by candlight - hot chestnuts and a glass of good port. ...sigh....
