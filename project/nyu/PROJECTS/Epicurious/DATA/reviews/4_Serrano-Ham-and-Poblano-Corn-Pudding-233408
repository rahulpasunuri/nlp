I've now made this twice for company. Once with a Mexican night meal, and once with Easter brunch. Both times it was a huge hit. I did use regular corn muffin mix. Will definitely make again.

Used cheddar cheese and added zucchini. Great texture but I might add another egg next time.

I used asadero cheese, corn bread mix instead of masa and baking powder, skipped the meat. Made it once in a casserole dish and once is two small pie crusts. A keeper!

I think it's supposed to be 12 eggs.

I have made this numerous times and it is always a huge hit! Agree that this would never serve 12. I made it last night along with the beer marinated flank steak and a green salad. There were only 5 of us and let's just say there were no left overs. I find roasting the peppers the night before makes for a quick side day of; also if you cannot find serrano ham use prosciutto, I used Americana prosciutto and it turned out just fine. I also think the manchego is very important for the right balance of flavors.

I love this dish... Also..maseca can be found at Winn Dixie stores in Florida. It's also called Tamale flour.

Delicious! We made it vegetarian --no ham-- to make it a side dish. Did not double but it would never serve 12 even as a side dish without doubling. I'd say it was more like 8-10 side dish servings, largely because it's quite flat. We liked that it wasn't thick, which would have made it eggy and more like a pudding. As it was, the edges crisped up a bit and had a nice texture (don't skip the masa, it's a critical part of the flavor). Loved having two poblanos, would not reduce. We didn't have manchego cheese, substituted (gasp!) cheddar and was fine. I'm sure manchego would be better. Definitely would make again.

Nice side dish. I didn't have time to go to a specialty shop so I made it with a little diced jalapeno & red pepper sauteed in some pork drippings, cheddar cheese, and regular corn flour. It came out great.

Outstanding flavor! In my rush putting the dish together, I forgot the butter. Didn't miss it. I also used light sour cream and Trader Joe's low fat sharp cheddar (no Manchego in Pendleton!). I ran this recipe through my calorie counter. As written, a 1/8th portion has 329 cal, 25g fat (15 sat.). With my subs, it came out 144 cal, 5g fat (2 sat). I'll stick with my version.

I would make this again but with some changes. I like spicy food but 2 poblanos was a little too zippy. It didn't "puff" up as much as I would've liked but maybe my baking powder was old. It also was eggy and not as much as a pronounced corn flavor. I would use more corn.

I've made this several time with a few changes. I use eggbeaters, 1/4 cup of butter, light sour cream OR plain yogurt and whatever ham and cheese I have available. I've never had access to the Maseca, so I use 1/2 cup of a corn muffin mix. Everyone loves it - even if I do cut out a few grams of fat and some calories.

Read all the reviews first and seemed to be a unanimous winner (well, mostly). I took the advise and doubled the recipe in one pan - good call! I doubled everything except the meat (I used prosciutto). Baking time wound up being exactly an hour (considering the doubling). And, YES...it was a hit! Will definitely be made again and again!

made just as listed (with prosciutto) and it was easy and fabulous. It does come out thin when made in a 13x9 as instructed, but it is very rich so this was perfect. It can serve 12 as a side dish but the servings are on the small side. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! Everyone who I've made it for asks for the recipe. Winning dish at the work potluck! I substitute jalapenos for the chiles, very old cheddar for the cheese, prosciutto for the ham and add red pepper for colour. Great for brunch, potluck or as a side for BBQ ribs!

Fantastic - we loved it, and we heated up the leftovers with some scrambelled eggs for a southwestern breakfast - delish! Only problem - in the middle of cooking I couldn't find my Manchego cheese...had to use cheddar. Still great, but I wonder where that cheese went...(!)

I used some leftover ham from a spiral (it worked!). Also, I used sharp cheddar. Because of the fat content in the ingredients (butter,ham, sour cream, cheese) I didn't bother greasing my Pyrex pan (it also worked!) I used pasilla peppers which I blackened on an electric stove (worked!) Delicious combination of flavors, pleasing presentation, and ooey, gooey richness!

Wonderful dish. I served this at Christmas dinner to accompany a slow roasted shoulder of lamb and it fit easily into the menu. Based on previews reviews I decided to double the recipe and I'm so glad I did, it was just enough to serve 12. Unfortunately I couldn't find poblanos in time and used a long hot pepper and a red bell pepper instead. I also used smoked ham instead. I used half manchego and half pepper jack cheese. It was a big hit! I made it in the morning, then reheated and served at dinner. I'm sure it would have been better served right out of the oven but it did keep well and it's great at room temperature.

This is simply excellent. I made a double batch, then froze it, for a quick microwave meal. It came out excellent and was a bit hit.

Holy smokes is this ever good! I have made this three times so far and will make it again and again. A little bit of work involved but so worth it. This will be a brunch or Mexican themed menu staple for me.

Very good! I made it for my church group and everyone loved it. It has a subtle fire that gives it a bit of kick but is ok for people who only like mildly spiced foods.

Made this at Christmas! One of the best dishes served. Even my son (sous Chef at Farenheit in St Charles) complimented ol' dad on this dish. Couldn't wait for leftovers next day, but son got up earlier and wiped it out for breakfast. Am making again tonite and decided to share thoughts.

Delicious!!! I make it with smoked ham and mexican cheese mix since the recipe ingredients require a special trip to the grocery store. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

The stoe I went to did not have Serrano ham so I used prosciutto which for some reason turned out very dry after being baked, however the rest of the dish was really good. I do believe that next time I'll use a different cheese as the Manchego didn't seem to make any kind of outstanding impact on the flavor of the dish and was also somewhat pricey. A smokey flavored cheese would seem like a good idea...

Although I don't normally experiment on guests, this seemed to be an easy recipe and I figured it really could not go wrong. Hah! The blender didn't work very well and the corn, which didn't fully thaw, hardened the butter on contact. Found out that we didn't have baking soda and used stuff that had been deodorizing the fridge for months and now, oops!!, I see that the recipe didn't call for baking soda, just baking powder. (See what I mean about things going south on you.) Couldn't find serrano ham and didn't want to use procuitto so we used rosemary ham from Trader Joe's. Used shredded "mexican cheese" since Ralph's didn't have Manchego (which would be superior to what I used) and cooked the casserole at the wrong temperature. The good news is that despite all of the above, it was very good and we got many compliments. I'd love to make it again -- correctly.

This is a great recipe that was a hit at a dinner party. I doubled the peppers and corn. I also used cheddar cheese instead of the machego and it worked out terrific. I am making it again for another dinner party with different people tomorrow.

I added 2 tsp of garlic powder and substituted jalapeno pepper for poblano and sharp cheddar for manchego. It was absolutely wonderful and will be a new favorite at our house.

I liked this recipe a lot. Made some adjustments; doubled it in a 9x13 pan, and that worked out well. I used prosciutto and smoked cheddar-and thought that only 3 oz of prosciutto was fine for the doubled recipe. I used half egg substitute as I ran out of eggs, and light sour cream. Very good!

Are you using real, hard Manchego cheese, or the softer queso Manchego that is found in most supermarkets?

Fantastic!!!! Loved it. Would be great as a vegetarian dish without the ham as well.

We first made this dish on Christmas with smoked, barbecued baby back ribs and it was an instant hit! We now make it (and crave it) once a month with anything off of the grill. This dish will not satisfy 12 people. Delish!!!

this was delicious. i made this and several other dishes from the same article in the dec. 05 issue for a new years dinner party, and everything was delicious. the corn pudding got especially good reviews from my guests.

This was very good--but I had to substitute cornmeal at the last moment as when I opened the Maseca, it had bugs in it. I also agree with the reviewer who said it would not serve 12. I had 8 for dinner and there was none left.

For the cook from Brentwood: Instant masa IS masa harina, it's sold under a couple of names in the US. Quaker makes one and now you can find the Mexican brand Maseca as well, but they are on in the same. The author of the recipe assumed a lot by naming Maseca.

The pudding was delicious. I made it exactly as called for in the recipe except that I used diced proscuitto instead of serrano ham because I couldn't find any serrano locally. However, the dish would not come close to feeding twelve people. Seven people wiped it out easily. Also, making it in a 9 x 13 inch pan made it very thin. I would recommend an 8 inch square pan for the recipe as written and doubling the recipe if you wish to feed more than six.

It was relatively easy to make, although I had difficulty finding instant masa. I added roasted red peppers(for color), and used regular masa harina mixed with water. It was fantastic
