Disappointing! I read all the reviews and opted to follow the recipe as written. I thought I'd rather base my own results on the original recipe rather than begin by altering it to someone else's tastes. Very bland. While "doctoring" the recipe for another attempt is an option, I'll opt to search for another recipe.

Loved! I increased the sugar. Added a pinch of oregano, basil and cumin and finished it with 2 tbsp of greek yogurt cream cheese. Super easy and delicious!

I increased the garlic a little and used 3 cups homemade, very high quality chicken broth for 3 of the cups of water called for. (3c is all I had.) I also used slightly more than 1/4c of the cream. It just wasn't that flavorful, especially given the long cooking time.

Really, really good. I didn't add the cream or the salt. I also used San Marzano tomatoes and that made it extra yummy.

Made this the other night with vegetable stock and no cream. Doubled the garlic and onion. It was really good and I'll make it again.

Great basic recipe but again I added rosemary along with the thyme, doubled the garlic, and used mostly low sodium chicken broth. Finished with a pat of butter and the cream and it was wonderful!

I made this today; it is easy to make and delicious. I halved the basic recipe and listened to other reviewers: I used chicken broth for half of the water and added more garlic and onion. I used canola oil instead of butter (a mistake but it worked out fine) and dried thyme instead of fresh because I didn't have any. I thought the end result would be creamier even though I added more cream than the recipe called for but perhaps I should have blended it longer. As I said, it is just delicious and I will be making it again.

I followed the leaders and also substituted 4 cups of chicken broth for the water. I also tripled the garlic and used my mincer instead of slicing it. Figured I was using the imersion blender at the end anyway. Only difference is that I skipped the onion, since I am allergic to them. My inhouse food critics, aka my sons, thought the soup was better than stoore bought.

This soup is hearty and rustic. I doubled the onion and garlic, and used 4 cups of vegetable broth and 4 cups of water. As with the other reviewers, I used a stick blender for the final blending.

I thought this recipe was really good! I made one modification: substituted 1 can of tomatoes for 4 fresh ones because that's what I had on hand.

You got to doctor this recipe. It is bland. Really bland. It lacks the depth of classic tomato soup. I added chicken broth to make the broth richer and a couple of bay leaves. I also added a few more garlic cloves and after an hour and a half I used the immersion blender to blend it. Then added some dry annisette and more salt and voila! Perfect tomato soup. The annisette brings the tomato flavor foward and deepens it. But dont add too much, a tablespoon or so is enough.

I doubled the recipe -- only adding 14 cups of water, but more like 8 garlic cloves. I let it simmer for closer to 2 hours before using the stick blender directly in the pot. It felt like it needed more "oomph" so I added in a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, and pureed that, as well as a sprinkling of garlic salt and crushed red pepper flakes. It was tasty, and I'm confident it will be better today as it's one of those things that more time = more flavor.
