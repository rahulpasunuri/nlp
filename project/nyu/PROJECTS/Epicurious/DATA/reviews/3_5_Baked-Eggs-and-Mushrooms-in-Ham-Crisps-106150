Enjoyed this dish. I used dried tarragon in the mushrooms, black forest ham and sour cream.

I have had this recipe kicking around my inbox for 10 years, so I was quite excited to try it at long last. Was it worth the wait? Mostly. The flavors were divine. My local market was out of tarragon, so I substituted thyme, which worked beautifully. I had problems with the eggs, however  by the time the whites had set completely, the yolks were cooked through, so I didn't get that oozy, runny goodness. The ham also was more chewy than crispy. I'll give it another try, with high hopes for perfection next time.

Great recipe, great presentation! I was concerned about the eggs overcooking but didn't want them slimy either - I cooked them on the bottom rack for 12 minutes and top for 2, they were what I consider over medium (slightly runny). I used thyme instead of tarragon and didn't garnish with anything. I suggest a garnishment for the top because even when done they look a little underdone. I asked for my ham sliced on the thick side which worked good, but two thin slices may have been easier. Will definitely make them again and recommend them for a great presentation of ham and eggs!

I made these for Chritmas breakfast and we all loved them. I bought black forest ham and it was a little tricky getting it into the muffin cups. The mushroom mixture is outstanding but should not be over served. I would say 1 teaspoon is plenty because it it strongly flavored. We like how the ham got a little crispy around the edges. I served with English Muffing toasting bread.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit - delicious and restaurant-fancy. My mom doesn't care for tarragon, so I substituted chives. The butcher made the ham slices transparently thin, so I used two per serving and overlapped them, which worked great. I had to cook the eggs a bit longer than 15 minutes for the whites to firm up - closer to 18/20 minutes. All in all, a huge hit.

I love this recipe, quick and so easy to make. Great for brunch. I add sauteed spinach with the mushrooms. I've also topped with Hollandaise sauce or sometimes a little grated cheddar cheese. Yummy!!!

Super B/fast idea, and if you don't have mushroom, not to worry just as good ..with a dash of grated cheese on top...have also made it with mortadella i.s.o ham ..scrumptious!!!!

My two grandkids liked them best but everyone raved about how good these were! I did them in individual 1-1/2 cup ramekins. Also added about a tablespoon of cheese on top of the mushroom mixture before baking. The ramekins required about 18 minutes except for two with double eggs which I finished under the broiler to firm up the egg whites.

Excellent dish. Look and tastes great. I like crimini mushrooms in this recipe. However, I find that 15 min at 400F is too long, the eggs end up overdone. 10 min is enough.

I have made this now for the past 8 Easter brunch/egg hunts. I would try something new except for the fact that EVERYONE requests I make this dish. I serve them on top of hash brown patties purchased frozen at the market and baked with some additional proprietary seasonings! I time it so both items come out of the oven at the same time making multiple servings a snap. I usually have no less than 15 people to serve so this is very important. I prepare all the components the evening before so all I have to do in the morning is assemble and bake. To top it off, this dish tastes great too!

Rating: 3
For kids, I cook the ham in butter, then cut into strips and mix in with the rest before poring the eggs on top. That way it's easier to eat (no knife needed). I've done it both ways and i prefer the strip approach--kids or not. I'd suggest rubbing more butter into the tins as the egg will sit in the tin directly.

Very nice idea- we used bacon in place of ham and would reccommend baking the bacon for about 10 before forming cups to remove some of the grease, but they were delicious and simple!

Delicious, super easy and very presentable. A great little breakfast to whip up when you want to impress guests. It only gets three forks because I felt there was something missing, I just haven't been able to put my finger on it yet...(I think it's an accompaniment that's missing, not something in the dish itself)

I used this recipe as a loose guide. We are trying hard to eat healthfully, so I adapted it to our diet. Here are my substitutions: * precooked turkey bacon (3 half slices per cup) instead of ham * 1 tsp ff 1/2 & 1/2 + 2 tsp trader joe's ff plain greek style yogurt (it has a creamier texture) instead of creme friache * 1 tbs olive oil instead of butter * herbs de provence instead of tarragon (we didn't have tarragon). This was delicious! * just a pinch of garlic powder on the mushrooms and shallots I baked them at 380 and just kept an eye on them until the whites were just barely cooked. The yolks were soft but cooked on the bottom and still runny on the top. They were perfect! I also saved out a little of the mushroom mixture and used it as garnish when I served the egg cups. They tasted totally decadent and delicious!

Rating: 4
I used spiral sliced ham, warmed in the skillet in which I cooked the eggs over medium. I stacked the ham, the mushroom mixture, and then the egg on top instead of using the muffin tin since my ham was too thick. Delicious flavors. I'd use the mushroom sauce again on chicken or over pasta.

This is great! I did not use the muffin tins, though. I put each serving with a slice of ham into a medium sized buttered ramekin with the two eggs on top and served it in the ramekin. It made a nice presentation

This is one of my all-time favorite breakfast recipes. So easy but the finished dish looks like Julia Child might have made it. I've made this for several Mother's Days and Easters for post-church brunch and we all love it. It's a great way to be able to serve at least 6 people a hot egg breakfast without multiple pans going on the stove. I've substituted dill for the tarragon in the past and that works quite well; it's also delicious with a hollandaise sauce drizzled over it! Serve with croissants and a melon salad with champagne vinaigrette and you can NOT go wrong.

These were a hit at my New Year's Day brunch - I had a little trouble getting the ham to fit into the muffin tins (because the deli sliced it too thick), but they came out fine anyway! As others have said, it's difficult to get the eggs cooked perfectly - mine had firm yolks, but fortunately didn't come out rubbery. Very impressive presentation for very little work.

Rating: 2
This was just ok, probably because I over-cooked the eggs. It was really tough to tell how done they were in the oven. I did really like the mushroom/shallot sauce, so next time I'll probably just make my usual eggs (scrambled or over medium) and then spoon the mushroom/shallot sauce over top.

This is how recipes should be: easy, versatile and absolutely delicious. I used giant muffin cups and found that it was the perfect size with a good amount of sauteed mushrooms in the ham cup. And with your seasonings of choice and a sprinkling of cheese on top, there's no way you could go wrong. Be creative!

Rating: 3
Great breakfast buffet recipe. Don't worry about patching the ham if it rips. If the eggs leak out the whole things still comes out cleanly (use Pam)and looks fine. Got raves even from mushroom haters. Used fresh thyme instead of tarragon; great. Scrambled and whole egg versions take different times to cook. If you want to serve both styles, use separate muffin tins.

Will definitely make this again. I always struggle with brunch ideas for a crowd. This was perfect. My husband thought that the mushroom mixture was a bit bland. I disagree, but will still add a dash of cayenne pepper next time. Served it with toasted cheese bread triangles, sliced tomatoes with basil and balsamic, fruit salad.

Rating: 2
This is beautiful and good, but not great. Is there a way to keep the yolks runny? Granted, I make the cups a tad bigger and used 2 eggs per cup. I took them out just as the egg white coagulated, but the egg yolk was semi-solid already. I put crisscrossed strips of parchment paper in the cups before I placed the ham in the cup. This worked very well as I could just grab the overhanging paper strips and lift the cups out. It took an annoyingly long time to get the ham in the cup just so and patch little rips.

This was fabulous. I used creme fraiche and a mixture of button and shitake mushrooms; other than adjusting the cooking time, I followed the recipe exactly. (Try 13-14 minutes if you are going to eat the dish immediately, and remember that the eggs will continue to cook until removed from the muffin tin.) Fantastic and surprisingly hearty.

I made this for a special brunch I was having and it was great! Such an impressive presentation and so simple to prepare as well. I made the recipe exactly as it was written, and next time I will add spinach to the mushroom mixture and maybe some cheddar cheese. It could only get better and better!!! Give it a try. You can make these 2hrs ahead and just pop them in the oven for 17mins and be done....just great!

This is so easy and quick. I used sour cream and mixed it with the mushrooms and dried tarragon. (This would still be good without anything but S&P or with basil or oregano.) I sauteed some spinach in butter and put it on top of the mushroom mixture. Added some shredded cheddar (the more the better). I used jumbo muffin tins and large eggs. I baked the dish for 14 minutes and then broiled the eggs on low heat for another minute to get rid of any yucky liquid laying on top of the eggs. The eggs were still perfectly runny and not overcooked (watch it carefully under the broiler). We all had 2 each for Easter brunch with hashbrowns. If you need meat with your breakfast, I suggesting using a thicker slice of ham (must use a deep muffin tin or ramekin). This looks very impressive and tastes great and is quick and easy!

Rating: 3
These were great, even though I forgot the creme fraiche and the tarragon. I put them over fried hash brown patties and they were a big hit. Fifteen minutes is too long though, especially as eggs continue to cook after leaving the oven. Thirteen minutes would have been plenty. A nice change for Sunday breakfast, will definitely make them again.

Delicious and easy to make! I used black forest turkey ham,it's alittle thiker.I'm not a big fan of Tarragon, so I just used a spice blend I had on hand. I used sour cream, and put a little shredded cheese as my first layer before I added the mushroomss.My ham was alittle crisp, it helped to spray the muffin cups with olive oil, and preheat the oven to 425 first to get it nice and hot. Turn the oven back down if you don't want your eggs over done.

I was dubious about the size of my muffin tins, and so decided to make this dish using individual baking dishes (I think they're called ramekins). I think you should really like the taste of tarragon, as it is quite strong. I think I would substitute another herb next time. I love the mushrooms with the creme fraiche. My family loved it and it looked wonderful served in the pretty dish with parsley and a little parmesan cheese on top.

This is a great brunch recipe, especially since you can prepare it ahead of time. I couldn't find any good ham in my grocery, so I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and used two thin slices of prosciutto instead. This came out a little too salty for my taste, so I may try to find some of that ham next time. Also, the cooking time stated is WAY too much time! I would say 10-12 mins at the most. Otherwise, a great recipe!

I love this dish!!! I have done it as the recipe reads, as well using a combination of sour cream and boursin cheese (no tarragon) and spinach with the sour cream, all turned out well. I have served it over hash browns as well as with english muffins. I also really like serving it with a simple hollindase sauce prepared in the blender - but this is a bit rich and the sour cream in the mushrooms may need adjusting or serving size can be reduced to one basket. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
I made this twice. The first time I used sliced virginia ham but was not pleased with the results. Maybe because I ended up overcooking the eggs. The second time I used the rest of the mushroom mixture with prosciutto in ramekins. It was lovely. I like the fresh tarragon very much and would not use dried herbs in this dish. I find 15 minutes a bit too little time for this. I also think it would be lovely served on a toasted English muffin.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious and beautiful presentation. I used a jumbo muffin tin, which worked beautifully. I used jumbo-size eggs and doubled the mushroom mixture, adding about a healthy teaspoon of dijon mustard and used dried tarragon instead of fresh. Served them nestled in a bed of hash browns -- the presentation was so pretty that it looked like it was difficult to make, when in fact it was quite easy. Word of warning: the eggs cook quickly, I would watch them continually and carefully as they'll overcook if you cook them for 15 minutes as written.

These were very tasty. I made them for my book club and everyone loved them. I thought the tarragon was a little strong, so I will try rosemary next time. Also, the cooking time needs to be reduced. I followed the directions and the eggs overcooked. You cannot beat the presentation. So impressive, yet so easy!

Made this dish for overnight guests,& was pleased with the results. Prepared mushroom mixture night before, (using dried oregano instead of tarragon), & assembled in the morning. Didn't need salt, because of the ham, just pepper. Found 15 min. just a little too long-will start checking after 12 minutes next time. Make sure muffin pans are 1/2 cup size..cooks with overflow problems must be using tart pans, which are too shallow.

This recipe (and its infinite variations as chronicled below) has become a "mountain house" standard -- breakfast for 10, 12, or more members of the extended family (ages 10 to 70) at the family vacation house. Ever try to do Eggs Benedict or omelets for a dozen? Can't be done, if the object is to serve all hot and simultaneously. Even plain ol' scrambled eggs are a problem in such quantity. Baked eggs are the solution, and this variation of them is superior. With a bit of advance prep, you can get a dozen, two dozen, or more 1-egg servings to the table at the same time. And one egg is enough for many, although the teenage boys usually snag three! I add a generous dash of Tabasco to the mushrooms, and put some grated cheese on top for the last 2 minutes of cooking. Simple enough for a family breakfast, elegant enough for a Champagne brunch for guests. Easiness-to-"wow" ratio merits four forks.

Beautiful, easy, and RICH. Definitely cut down on the cooking time - I'd modify the mushroom ingredients to lighten - spinach is a nice addition. Also that's a lot of fresh tarragon - half as much would be good. Gorgeous presentation, comes out of the muffin pan easily. Do make sure the pan's large enough. Unless you have serious mega-eaters, one per person is very much enough. Black Forest ham was perfect.

Made these for Easter breakfast. What a stunning presentation.

I am looking forward to trying these with a variety of filling combinations. Although the flavor wasn't over-the-top (hence only 3 forks), the presentation is truly impressive.

Really nice presentation, very pretty served atop hash browns. Made full mushroom recipe but only made 10 ham cups. Used 1 Tbs. sour cream, 1 Tbs. whipping cream and dried tarragon. Despite the warnings, I got distracted and allowed them to cook for the full 15 minutes. I won't make that mistake again; they looked so pretty but were plastic-y on top from over-cooking. Skipped the Hollandaise (not sure it'd match, unless you added some tarragon to it as well). These were EASY and impressive and tasty. Served w/ hash browns, Maple Pecan Sticky Buns (outrageous!) and a spring mix salad w/ dried cranberries & toasted pecans. Great all the way around!

Made this recipe and it worked. But not without a few trials and tribulations. First, I don't know what everybody else's muffin tins look like, but I sure wish mine were twice as deep. I needed two tins to do 12 ham/egg cups because so much ham hung over the edges. I sauteed the shrooms, added to the ham, and had no room left for the eggs. Finally squeezed them all in, baked for 14 minutes, and they weren't done. They needed almost 20 minutes at 400* and were still a touch runny at the center, and the excess ham kind of hardened, but never "crisped." I added a sprinkling of parmesean cheese which I think was very good. I liked a previous poster's suggestion to serve it in a bed of hash browns, as it does tend to spill all over the plate when cut into. To sum up, try this once at home by yourself to get the kinks before making it for company like I did.

This recipe was wonderful and looked great too. The eggs came out perfectly! I served it on a bed of hash brown potatoes topped with hollandaise sauce, and it was super yummy and a lot less fuss than eggs benedict but with all the impact. A great new addition to my Sunday Brunch.

This dish is fantastic! I made it for the first time for Sunday brunch with my family and we all oved it. I was worried that they wouldn't like the tarragon, but they ate every last bite! The recipe is easy to make in any quantity and, like other reviewers have said, it has endless possibilities for variation.

I was afraid the finished product would be hard to get out of the muffin tins, but it wasn't so bad. I was also afraid the ham would collapse when it came out of the muffin tins and the eggs would spill all over the plate, but that didn't happen either. I knew I would make the recipe the second I saw it on the cover of the magazine. Made it 2 weekends ago and today bought the ham and tarragon to make it again.

This is easy to prepare and makes a very nice presentation. The recipe as stands is alright but not wonderful taste-wise. I would try it again but with modifications to the mushroom mixture or even something completely different to give it more depth. I think it's a good starting point but has a lot more potential than this recipe draws out.

I've made this dish twice and my guests loved it. It was very simple. We're not crazy about mushrooms so I quartered and sauteed some artichokes in garlic and put them in the bottom of the ham cups. I also tried using turkey for a few of the cups when I ran out of ham. It worked well with that too!

These are fabulous. I halved the recipe one morning and the hubby loved it. I made it again for company with sauteed spinach and a bit of onion instead of the mushrooms and they turned out just as amazing. The possibilities with this one are truly endless.

I have made this dish twice and loved it both times. I used Boar's Head maple glazed ham from the deli and it worked well. I didn't have the tarragon and used fresh parsley instead. Yummy!

As others have said, this a good recipe to take as is or vary according to taste. I put some cheese in the bottoms of the cups instead of the creme fraiche mixture. It was delicious! A very clever, but relatively easy dish. The presentation effect is what makes these special--a neat food for entertaining!

This Dish has endless Possibilities. I made this dish per recipe. The possibilities pervale. Why not mix the mushrooms, shallots, seasonings, with the eggs. Mix and pour into the Ham Lined Muffin Tins, then Bake?

Every one thought this was fabulous! I will certainly serve it again-it makes a terrific presentation! I thought the baking time was just right. It was a great success for a Sunday brunch.

This dish is fantabulous!!!! It was a pleasure to prepare and it's presentation is impressive! My family raved about this for days. Will try the other suggestions and serve it Benedict style. This will be in my repetoire for years to come.

These were pretty good, but I wouldn't suggest using prosciutto instead of ham ... and the sweetie who made them for me wouldn't suggest it either!

Excellent! Made it twice, first as written, and the second time with a layer of crisp hash browns instead of the mushrooms.

This was absolutely delicious! Even with chopping the mushrooms & shallots by hand, it took less than 45 minutes to prepare. I did heed the advice given in other reviews and cut down the baking time to 12 minutes. The eggs came out perfectly "over medium". I used Black Forest ham and had no problems with too much oil. If my husband has his way, this recipe will become a weekend staple!

I have served this to guests twice now, both times accompanied by asparagus and english muffins, and topped with hollandaise sauce. It's a great quick company meal.

This was wonderful! I made it this morning for out-of-town houseguests visiting the Olympics. I prepared the mushrooms last night and refrigerated. I did use Black Forest ham, but it was cut a little too thick -- between that and the cold mushrooms, mine took longer to cook than I'd anticipated, but it gave me time to make a hollandaise sauce, which most loved as an addition. I plan to make this in the future and may try some changes for variety's sake: instead of mushrooms, maybe cheese or asparagus or spinach or ?

I think the opposing reviews might be due to how long the mushrooms are cooked. I cooked mine at least 10 min or more till they were completely dry & golden. I doubled the creme fraiche and upped the tarragon a little. I had about 1 Tbsp of oil in each tin but I used a slotted spoon and it didn't effect it at all. This is seriously Ritz Carlton caliber breakfast. My husband raved and he doesn't like mushrooms or ham! I used some packaged "boston" ham that I would never dream of eating and it made a perfect funnel in the muffin tins. This takes awhile to make if you chop by hand but it is outstanding. Perfect for house guests - next time will prep mushrooms the day before. Yum

Wow--was this great. But only three forks as it needs a little work. Mind the amount of salt that you add--also, don't need fresh tarragon, dried is just fine. Sprinkle with fresh herb though (such as parsley). Also, 15min. at 400 degrees is WAY too long unless you like your eggs truly well-done and your ham crispy. Try flash-cooking them for five minutes or so at 500 degrees. Lastly, it definitely needs some sort of hollandaise or some sort of sauce. Will definitely make it again!

I had to give this 4 forks because it is not only delicious but is easy beyond compare. We ate this for dinner and want it again in a couple of days it was so good. My active time was no where near 45 minutes. I used a food processor on pulse to chop the (crimini~~yum!) mushrooms, and since we didn't have fresh tarragon, I cooked our dried version in with the mushrooms to rehydrate. Used a quick mist oil sprayer so the tins would barely be oiled, and there were no problems with the ham--we just used lean smoked ham since they were out of black forest. Farm fresh eggs are a good idea (we used Eggland's best Farm Fresh eggs bought at Wal Mart, which have very clear whites and less saturated fat) since the egg is the center of attn. Last note--we omitted the salt, used a little more pepper in the mix, and cooked mushrooms without butter (actually overlooked it)--turned out beautiful and just the right consistency.

Excellent and easy to prepare.

A simple and elegant breakfast! Easy to do if you have to cook for many guests. I used Black Forest ham and had no problems with grease, as the other cooks mention. I cooked it until the eggs were done to my taste. A friend of mine who is a chef at a local place is adding going to use it this summer for his breakfast menu!

I'm glad I didn't read the other reviews before I tried this. I actually thought it looked better than the photo and tasted better than I expected. Had none of the others' problems. A good quality ham should yield no "oil", and have it cut thick enough to yield no holes. In my oven, baking time was 17 minutes. This could be made ahead, under- baked and reheated for a buffet brunch. Mushroom filling (duxelles) could be made day before.

I WAS A BIT AFRAID TO TRY THIS RECIPE. IT LOOKED REALLY GREAT ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE. THIS IS USUALLY A CLUE (TOO HARD) WELL TO MY SURPRISE, IT WAS SIMPLE, THE MUSHROOM FILLING WAS EXCELLENT, AND THE YOLK WAS NOT TOO RUNNY. USE FRESH FARM EGGS IF AVAILABLE. THE TASTE COMBINATION WAS A WONDERFUL SENSATION TO THE MOUTH. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO GIVE IT A TRY. WORKS GREAT FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH.

Two main problems with this recipe - the ham gives out too much oil and I found the constant need for paper towels. Second, the eggs are supposed to be slightly 'wet' which is not how I like them. In any case, you can always make it 'well done' but I wound up wondering why I put in so much work for a dish that ended up rather mediocre. I think this is a fancy and pretentious recipe. However, if you're for style over substance, give it a go. One thing that it has going for it is the mushroom filling, which I will gladly substitute in some other recipe. The way this is right now, I dont see myself making it again. Seems very clumsily put together.

This dish has enormous potential which is the reason for only 2 forks. On my first go, I cooked it to spec and the eggs came out completely cooked. That made the dish a little dry so I served it with mustard. Next time I will cook it for a shorter time, maybe use more mushrooms (I cut the recipe in half), and fresh tarragon (unavailable locally that day). I used deli baked Virginia ham (no water added) which had holes which I patched - this worked fine. It is really easy to make, especially in quantity, which requires little more work than making just a few. Give it a whirl - the mushroom filling is truly delicious but watch your yolks!
