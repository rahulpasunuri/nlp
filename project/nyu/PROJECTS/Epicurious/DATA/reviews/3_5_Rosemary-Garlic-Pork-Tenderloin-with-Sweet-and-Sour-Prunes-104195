I have been making this recipe for years and it is a favorite with international guests always! The pork is so tasty and the prune sauce is delicious. I am southern so I use all different greens depending on what is pretty. I do use balsamic vinegar in place of the sherry vinegar.

This was disappointing. The prune sauce overpowered the lovely flavour of the pork, and looked dark and foreboding on the plate. Maybe the sauce would have been better as a dessert, like a prune whip. Reading the other reviews, we are obviously in a minority, but pork tenderloin is a fav in this house and our conclusion was that it is not complemented by such a strong, thick, dark and overpowering sauce. And we like vinegar...

I've made this recipe many, many times. It's just so quick and easy and the results are wonderful. With the prunes definitely cut them some, the whole prune is just too big. I have even put the prune mixture in the food processor and it has turned out in a nice thick sauce. Either way it has worked beautifully.

Quick, easy and delicious. Per the recommendations of others, I sliced the prunes in half. I noticed that as they cooked, they became more of a "mush" than recognizable individual prunes. I'm sure it depends on what you start with... The tenderloin was perfect at 145 degrees... slightly pink, and very juicy/tender. I used some leftover "paste" to flavor potatoes that I roasted along with the pork. I cut the potatoes into relatively small pieces, added a bit extra olive oil to the paste... and they were delicious. Instead of escarole, I used an heirloom spinach (more sturdy/flavorful than the standard spinach). I added a bit of olive oil and a few more cloves of (pressed) garlic to the "paste," sauteed it to cook the garlic, added a few flakes of crushed chili and then tossed with the spinach and a small amount of chicken stock. The end result was delicious... and from start to finish, not too much time elapsed for a tasty and attractive meal.

This is the kind of recipe that makes you look like an outstanding cook. It's simple and elegant and so good you want to lick you fingers and the pan you cooked in! I did it for the first tim at Fathers' Day. There's just nothing like a hit in a room full of foodies on a holiday.

1. I grilled thick pork tenderloin chops marinated in garlic/rosemary , since its still BBQ weather 2.Substituted dried prunes/cranberries/ raisins mixture, sherry wine, black fig vinegar (balsamic would work too) for the reduction 3. RAVES from mother-in-law!!

Made just the tenderloin without the prunes and it was excellent -- tender and tasty!!

this dish was easy and great- skipped the escarole and roasted potatoes- worked perfectly. prunes were excellent match for the pork.

Wow! This was one of the best meals ever! I followed one of the reviewers' sugestions, cut down on the broth, added ruby Port because I couldn't find the Maderia, and quartered the prunes. We will be making this again soon.

Didn't have the escarole. Instead slathered diced potatoes in the paste & roasted with the pork. Added the QUARTERED prunes & it was company fare.

I made only the pork from this recipe but used the entire paste recipe. After applying paste, I left the pork in the refrigerator for a couple of hours only because I wasn't ready to cook it yet. I was somewhat concerned that it would be overly garlic tasting but it was perfectly seasoned and very moist. Book club members all enjoyed it.

Try this variation for prunes: 1 cup dry Marsala, 1 cup water, one-third cup sherry vinegar, one-quarter cup sugar, salt to taste. Follow recipe as given with these substitutions. May need to tinker with proportions of wine, vinegar and sugar to get balance you like.

I've made this several times and really love it. People who don't like vinegar will be less complimentary. After experimenting, I heartily endorse several changes suggested by other raters: 1. Instead of cooking the prunes whole, I quarter them. A whole prune plumped up with liquid is way too big! Also, do not be misled by the rater from California who says s/he discarded the prunes....evidently a misunderstanding occurred. 2. I cut the amount of olive oil in half. 3. I substituted fresh spinach for escarole. 4. I used just 1/4 cup of broth. Not big changes overall.

Yes, this required quite a few pots and pans, but it was quick, easy, and delicious! I cut down on the sugar in the prune sauce; the sweet-and-sour balance wasn't hurt at all. Taking a hint from other reviewers, I quartered the prunes before stewing them, which worked out well. I also found the chicken stock for the escarole to be unnecessary. After washing and slicing the leaves, I added them undried into the pot of garlic paste; once they had wilted, I just salted to taste. I did use considerably less than the full 12 cups suggested, knowing that my kids wouldn't go for the green stuff. (They loved the meat and potatoes, though!) When I prepare this for company, I'll make more of the garlic paste so I have enough to season the full complement of escarole. Finally, as much as I love garlic, I didn't think EVERYTHING on the plate needed it, so made the mashed potatoes plain (albeit on the chunky side). The mix of flavors and textures was delightful!

The pork itself was delicious. I rubbed the garlic/rosemary paste on it a couple hours before cooking it, and actually grilled it outside. The prune sauce was nothing I would ever make again. I tasted it prior to discarding the whole prunes, and it didn't have enough flavor or texture, so I put it all in the blender to see if that would improve things. It didn't.

I only made the pork tenderloin part and it was quite tasty - I used the entire amount of oil, garlic and pepper on two loins, next time I may add a little bit of kosher salt. Served this with the Fresh Peach Chutney from this site and it was great.

Disappointing- prune sauce flat- I added more vinegar. Escarole a poor choice, took too long to cook. Made mistake of garlic mashed- too much garlic in all dishes-meat, vegetable & potatoes.

I made this last night for company and it was delicious! Everyone raved about it! The sweet and sour prune sauce made this dish and the escarole was very good with it. Keep close watch on how long you cook the pork, mine seemed to cook very quickly at that temperature. Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of chicken broth for the escarole as 1 cup seemed to make it too soppy.

Great dish for company as most of it can be done ahead of time. Makes a very good presentation.

This is a "wow" dish. It is easy, although requires several pots and pans. I made it for company last night. Served with haricot verts and mashed potatoes. Impressive presentation and delcious flavors.

We hardly ever eat pork tenderloin - after tasting this recipe we definitely will more often. The rosemary-garlic paste was easy, and the prunes were a surprisingly ideal complement -almost like a chutney. If you want a truly great salad to go with this, try the 'Butter Lettuce Salad with Bacon, Dried Cherries, and Roquefort Vinaigrette'. A fantastic yet easy combination with creamy mashed potatoes.

This was good, but I prefer other pork tenderloin recipes on this website. I used spinach instead of the escarole. My children didn't like the prune mixture, but I thought it was good. I didn't have fresh rosemary so used dried which I think probably made a major difference in the finished product.

I have made this recipe four times and always to great reviews. Last time I had a big crowd so I used a pork loin instead of tenderloin and it was a huge success. It is easy straight forward and delicious. Thank-you.

1/4 cup of olive oil is too much to make a paste. I just used 2 tbsps. Otherwise it is a delicious dish.

I made this recipe for a dinner party my husband had for his French boss and other coworkers. It recieved rave reviews from everyone, especially the French contingent! I lightened up on the crushed red pepper and more of the fruitiness came through. The dish leaves a memorable taste on the palate. Thanks for making me look good!

a really good recipe. i added less sugar (1/3 1/2 a cup) and still it was a bit too sweet for me. i suspect that a couple of tablespoon would to the trick as the prunes are pretty sweet on their own. also, this recipe works well over egg noodles with just a little butter and parsley.

This was excellent and relatively easy to prepare. I liked the prunes whole, not chopped, as others have suggested. Also, it took twice as long as recommended--about 40 minutes--to cook the prunes until the sauce was syrupy. Overall, a great dish for a weekday, weekend, or "for company" meal!

If you don't have escarole, use frozen spinach. Cook till defrosted with pinch of red pepper flakes, drain, add 2 tbs chicken stock. Add 1/2 tea of garlic paste toward the end. Beaujolis was great with this.

This was my first attempt at making pork tenderloin. I believe I overcooked it a bit. Overall this was pretty good - a bit too peppery for my liking. The sweet-n-sour prunes complemented this nicely. I served this with mashed new potatoes with goat cheese.

Wow! We chopped the prunes as noted by another reviewer and would recommend doing so as well, otherwise follow the recipe and enjoy.

I substituted Rice Vinegar for Sherry Wine Vinegar and Spinach for Escarole. I took the advice of another reader and chopped up the prunes. My husband said it tasted just like a 4-star restaurant.

Outstanding! A scrumptious blend of tastes -- the sweet & sour prunes are unique and enliven the dish, and the escarole, pork and sauce meld wonderfully. Also a lovely presentation.
