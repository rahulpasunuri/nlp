Wow. I only made the puree and it was sensational. Creamy, silken, with a subtle flavor that was pleasing and not overwhelming.

We only made the celery root puree, but it was very good,and we'll make it again.

4 forks for the celery puree... I also recommend substituting chicken stock for the water- gives the puree a little more backbone so it isn't totally drowned out by the *amazing* short ribs. You can also save the broth/milk celery "liquid" after you drain the celery & potatoes, and thicken it with a roux (bechamel-style) to make a excellent cream of celery soup.

Also, I can understand why people would not make the braised celery again, but it's worth doing it the first time--the play between the braised celery and the celery root puree really harmonizes the dish (similar, yet different...so good)

Daniel Boulud's restaurants annoy me, but this recipe is brilliant. The celery root has a sight taro like consistency that gives the puree a beautiful whipped texture. It's always pleasant to have a simple recipe that surprises you.

Very good! I used a russet potatoe with no problems. I didn't bother with the braised celery as the puree was great on it's own!

The celery puree is superb, really rates four stars. Have made it ahead of time (day before) and reheated it.The braised celery is okay, and I would not make it again.

great combo: i used russet potatoes and smashed by hand - much richer taste. also added spices to the broth: 1 tsp ground turmeric, coriander and 1 bay leaf. since i hate cooked celery , i used 2 fennel bulbs instead and added 1 tsp ground fennel to broth.

I used only three tablespoons butter for this, and it was superb. Absolutely a staple in place of mashed potatoes.

I gave this three forks, but really I think the celery root puree should have three and a half, and the braised celery ribs only two. The puree was delicious, and went superbly with Boulud's short ribs. Such a nice change from mashed potatoes. The braised celery ribs were fine, and complemented the puree well, but they were a little boring.

Wonderful pairing with the Daniel Boulud Short Ribs. (Don't try substituting Yukon Golds if using your Cuisinart - most other potatoes are too starchy and you will have cement!)

A lovely pair of dishes to accompany the short ribs. The puree is wonderful; I made it exactly as specified. For the braised celery, be sure to peel the stalks well. The success of the dish rides on removing as many of the fibers as possible from the celery. These work particularly well with the braised short ribs because they are not too highly seasoned, and support the sauce/meat flavors well.
