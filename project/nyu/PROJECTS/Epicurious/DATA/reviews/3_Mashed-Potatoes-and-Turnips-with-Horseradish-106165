Very good. I skipped the sugar though.

We're low carbing so I reduced the amount of potatoes, but otherwise followed te recipe exactly. It was great, and we'll make it again for sure.

I thought this was a great dish, could use other root vegetables (i.e.,cauliflower, etc). Used wasabi powder instead of horseradish

I did the whole menu from Gourmet. I thought these potatoes were good. I probably should have added a little bit of cream, as another poster suggested. It really does go well with the brined pork chops.

I didn't like this at all. Even after draining the potato and turnips, it was to wet. The turnips were very watery. I much prefer wasabi mash.

This is an excellent recipe. A nice alternative to plain mashed potatoes - lighter and more flavorfull

We really enjoyed the texture and flavor of this and thought it complemented the briend pork chops. I did add some milk to the mixture because it seemed dry. I thought the texture with the milk was very nice. A very nice variation on mashed potatoes.
