No fork for this recipe! Or don't call it rouille, please. I've looked at all your rouille recipes for rouille and none of them are good. Your ecipes would be like making aioli with ready made mayonnaise and adding crushed garlic! It's outrageous! Here is the recipe for rouille from Jacques Medecin famous mayor from Nice and cook : for 6 people 4 garlic cloves, 2 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 5 grams (0.17 ounces) saffron, 0.25 l (1 cup) fine olive oil in a mortar crush and cream the garlic, once it's creamy, add the egg yolks and very slowly add the olive oil to make a mayonnaise (if you stop here, you'll have real aioli) add teh cayenne pepper and the saffron. This is rouille nicoise It can be kept for 24 hours covered in athe fridge. In Marseille they add bread that has been soaked in watter or milk then pressed to remove excess liquid. Now, bon appetit from south of France!

As good as any I've had in the South of France. I did add extra garlic though. It really MAKES the fish soup.

Made this to go with a gourmet club dinner that featured Bouillabaisse...this rouille was quite the hit!!!! The flavors truly complemented the meal..dolloped on the soup and "shmeared" some on toast as a crouton that I served on the side. Wonderful!!!!

Really perfect with a fish soup! A wonderful balance of garlic and lemon with a spicy kick! Used the leftovers as a spread on sandwiches.
