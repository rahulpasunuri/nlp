I think this was great! Just a few things I did different...added cubed carrots and sweet potatoes while chicken was simmering. Would recommend you take chicken out as soon as it is done and veggies can simmer longer if needed (our chicken breasts were overcooked a little). I doubled the star anise and clove. I also put several more slits in my jalepeno. And, from another reviewer, I added diced okra during the time the sauce was boiling at the end. This thickened the sauce up nicely. I thought it was great - the sauce was just spicey enough from the jalepeno and the sweet potatoes really balanced the dish. Will use this again and will try some different types of meats with it.

Made this with a curry powder recipe from Julie Sahni. Omitted the kafir lime leaves in the curry powder which may have had an affect on the overall pungence of the sauce. I thought the color was gorgeous. Agree with the other reviewers that it was too thin. I would not use lowfat coconut milk next time, and ended up adding 2T of coconut oil to compensate and richen the dish. I think that a Malaysian reviewer recommended not to salt the curry until the end--and I did not salt the chicken, but I would next time. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces to add interest. I also added about 1/2 t more cayenne, and much more salt at the table. I agree with the other reviewers that vegetables would add interest. I would have added snap peas, carrots, and maybe some lemongrass...possibly basil leaves. The aroma was heady and transported our Michigan kitchen eastwards. I did thicken the sauce with 2T cornstarch after reducing. The overall roundness of the curry was full and lovely. We will make this again. Lime wedges on the side were beautiful and special with it. Make this. It's worth it. Especially if you make the curry powder.

This was good, but not great. I felt like it was missing something, but I can't figure out what that thing is. I followed the recipe for the most part, but used skinless chicken and light coconut milk. I also added some roasted sweet potatoes that we had leftover from Thanksgiving. I thought that the dish was easy to prepare, had the perfect amount of heat, and was very satisfying (I served it over brown rice), but I'm not sure I'd make it again. There are too many better recipes out there.

I opted to simmer the chicken as directed, but left out the coconut milk until just before serving as coconut milk breaks if it's boiled or simmered too long. So in order to get a thicker,creamier sauce, I added it at the end and just warmed it through. Perfect! LOVED this recipe and so did the whole family. We'll be having it often, I'm sure!

Great recipe-very popular every time I make it. I cut out fat by using coconut water and a cup of fat free yogurt instead of coconut milk and I use skinless chicken as well...otherwise just great!

This is a perfectly balanced curry. I added some navy beans which thickened it up.

as a born and bred malaysian cook, i must say that the recipe is dead-on! to make this dish more comfort-y, you can add in quartered tomatoes and peeled potato wedges before simmering for 15-20 minutes. okra is also good for chicken curry since the gluey texture thickens the lovely gravy. just pop about 5-6 okras along with the potatoes and tomatoes. serve over fluffy white rice. enjoy!

Simple and satisfying. Used less chicken and added some veggies. Served over brown rice.

A keeper w some work: More heat. Something to "fill" the sauce, even thickened, sliced mushrooms worked great. Less meat, used 1.5lb boneless thighs for six servings. Good cold-night, weeknight fare, served over steamed broccoli vs rice.

Great dish! I made it heartier by adding diced and boiled potatoes to the sauce. And to help it thicken, I threw in corn starch-water mixture

This is fa-a-ntastic. I mashed the peppers into the sauce and I still don't think it was too spicy. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper. I've doubled and quadrupled this recipe, and it still disappears every time. Next time I think I'll try experimenting with some coconut cream, shreds and/or chili oil.

I cooked this ahead to serve for dinner but it smelled so wonderful, I ate it for lunch and my tummy thanked me. I followed the CA cook's suggestion and added 1 c cilantro and simmered the mixture 40-45 min. I used pickled jalapeno I had on hand and a pinch of powdered clove. I will be making this again and again. It is nose-running spicy hot and SO-O-O delicious. It closely approximates dishes I've eaten at Indian restaurants, although it is a Malaysian dish.

This is a great basic recipe. I made some minor changes to the proportions: 2 star anise, 4 green cardamom pods, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 cup cilantro, and used spicy curry powder instead of mild. I also cooked the chicken in the sauce for about 40 minutes and it helped to thicken it nicely as well as imparting the flavors of the seasonings to the chicken. It was the hit of the party and I would certainly make it again.

I live in Serbia so I could not get shallots. And I had to actually kill a coconut to get the milk. But this was really tasty meal and I have been craving for a real curry meal. Thanks.

Juz for info....would recommend chinese parsley for this & not thai coriander...that's what we use to garnish our flavors back home in Singapore.

Sauce was way too thin, even with considerable reduction time. Also, I didn't have scallions so I used a leek. The sauce had a sharp bitter (not spicy) taste which may have been because of that substitution, but even with accepting this blame the sauce was just OK. I won't be making this again - there are many better curried chicked recipes out there.

I noticed that some people are confused as to what cilantro is. Cilantro is a member of the carrot family and is also sometimes referred to as Chinese Parsley and Coriander. Thought this might help people who weren't exactly sure what to get.

This is the best chicken curry recipe I've found. EASY and delish! I essentially made the recipe as is with the exception of a bit more curry! Just the right spice level for me!

Very stupidly, picked up cilantro, rather than corriander, at the market while buying the ingredients for this excellent curry. Didn't have the courage to substitute therefore left out. Used 2 tbsp. reg. curry powder and 1-1/2 tbsp. Blue Mountain "Hot" (Jamacian made) Curry Powder but increaseded the chicken to 3.0 lbs. The shallots were a wonderful flavor enhancer. Very tasty, as I served over Scented Jasmine Rice.

East to maske and very authentic in its flavour. A real winner

YUMMMMMMMYYYY! It was sooo good, a very different meal, with a different taste, if you're looking for something thats not boring, this is it. I found that all the flavors settled together better if you let it sit a few min before you serve it. YUM, i'm making it again for my family soon, they loved it

If you've never eaten curry at Bentara's restaurant in New Haven, CT, then you'll think this recipe is incredible. It is surprisingly close to authentic, with "something" missing. I tossed in green pepper and sliced carrots, which certainly helped. I might cut the chicken in slices or cubes if I were to make it again, which I probably won't.

Simply delicious. The sauce is what makes this dish. I love spicy food and was surprised how adding whole jalapenos (not diced) adds a little heat and, more importantly, so much chilie flavour.The star anise and other whole spices bring it all together. I don't think it's necessary to use skin-on breasts because it just adds unnecessary fat and the skin doesn't end up crispy anyway.
