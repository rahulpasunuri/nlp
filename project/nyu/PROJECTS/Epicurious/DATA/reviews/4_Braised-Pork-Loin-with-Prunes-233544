Company-worthy: exceptional (and unusual) flavor and a lovely presentation. Prep time given is optimistic - it's fairly labor-intensive, but worth it.

Very simple to make and very forgiving. I broke it up: made the onions and soaked the prunes ahead of time early in the day and kept them covered in the fridge until I was ready to serve. My pork was done earlier, so check early. I used tanwy port instead of Armagnac as that's what I had. Served over mashed potatoes - the sauce is pretty tasty.

okay, it's not as easy as people make it sound. not superhard, but time consuming. i figured it would be from the recipe, but the reviews belied my fears. i guess this is from the 1950s, when ladies were down with spending hours preparing dinner in ruffle-y aprons and high heels. so good, despite liberties taken with the recipe (i cut the recipe down very unscientifically, used sirloin tri tip, cognac and grainy mustard and forgot about the herbs) the next day, i made sandwiches with grainy mustard and good cheddar and leftover pork and fried them like grilled cheese- seriously good.

I followed it to the letter and was very pleased with the results. This dish looks impressive and tastes like comfort food but with a complexity that makes it elegant. I had to go out and buy the Armagnac and it was worth it. Will try it with apricots next time for company.

The pork was very moist and delicious. Look forward to making it again.

A very classy dish, likely to impress guests. Having a wealth of dried berries on hand, I used these in the place of prunes. Was missing the Armagnac, so I used white wine instead. I was surprised by the results. This recipe has great dimensions of flavor and is relatively simple to prepare. Will make again.

I used cognac as the armagnac is a real vintage. I also used figs as that's all I had. Neither sub would make much difference. I cooked it to 5 degrees higher with very careful attention not to overcook. It was delightful. So moist. I think the cooking temp is the real key to moist pork. I will do this one again but using prunes. The sauce is quite terrific so mashed potatoes would be ideal as an accompaniment. I served mashed celeriac that worked very well. No changes to the recipe.

I made this dish for Christmas Dinner. I found it pretty straight forward and very delicious. I used Brandy instead of Armagnac ( I couldn't find it anywhere) and it worked great. I also started the hole for the stuffing using a knife but used the handle of a wooden spoon to push all the way thru to the other side. The presentation of the pork and sauce on the plate is really pretty and looks like it is way harder to made than it really is.
