I tried this recipe but didn't have truffle oil nor clam juice. I doubled the chicken broth and white wine. The dish tasted bland, guess it really needed the truffle oil. Will do it with all the ingredients next time!

Wow. This got raves. The recipe will serve 4-5 small main course portions (one large scallop each). It is quite rich and decadent, so you don't need much. It was just enough for my small tummied guests to have them wanting just a little more... Fantastic with the truffle oil! It absolutely makes the dish.

Without the truffle oil, 3 forks, with it, 4+. Doubled the recipe and it served 4 adults and 1 child as an entree w/some to spare. Only did a 1/2 stick butter even doubled, I just couldn't bring myself to throw the rest in. The clam juice wasn't overpowering at all. The truffle oil is a MUST!

8 forks! Outstanding, elegant and impressive. Very little work for this sumptuous meal.

Labor-intensive but so worth it. This is a dish for holidays or a great start to a dinner party. Also great as a main course. Be sure to go all the way with the clam juice and never omit the truffle oil. You can get small bottles for under $15 at Whole Foods and trust me, it will last. So far my second favorite recipe I've found on this site.

This was fantastic! I made it exactly how it was written, except used shrimp stock (boiled 8 shrimp tails for 15 minutes in salt water) instead of chicken stock. It was a 3 star recipe until I drizzled the Truffle oil over the top- that's what made it 4 stars! For extra texture and color I topped with fried carrot shavings and toasted pine nuts (highly recommend this, as I often find risotto mushy).

great recipe! If you get the whole shrimps, it is great to make your own bouillon for the rice...boil shrimp heads, onion, garlic and a bay leaf for 20 minutes. strain and it is ready!

Exceptional -- great the way it's written, will definitely want to try using shrimp stock as others have suggested next time. Served this with the Moroccan Carrot Soup found on this website...also terrific.

Mmmmm. One of my favorite recipes ever! I also used shrimp stock per the other suggestions and it was just amazing. Everyone loved it. DELISH!

Fabulous risotto! The shrimp stock is a great idea. Since all the flavors are pretty subtle in this recipe. I was a little worried the clam juice would overpower the shrimp or scallops. The shrimp stock created the perfect balance of flavors.

I made this for our Valentine's dinner tonight, and it was delicious! I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did use my pressure cooker for the risotto which made it quite fast and easy (followed the recipe up through sautéing the risotto, then added all of the liquid and put the lid on the pressure cooker, brought to high pressure for 7 minutes before releasing the pressure and opening the pot). I'm not sure the risotto needed the addition of butter at the end as it is already very rich, but the truffle oil on top was FABULOUS. Very flavorful dish that tastes like it involved a lot more effort than it actually did.

I didn't tweak this recipe much at all, other than doubling the ingredients to serve 4 people as a main course and sprinkling some pepper and sea salt on the scallops before searing. It was a big hit! I'm a relative newcomer to cooking, but I was getting a lot of complements from my dinner guests - I would definitely make this again. A lot of people seem to be substituting out some of the clam juice for other liquids. Personally, I love the union of clam, butter, and garlic flavors in the recipe as written. Keep the clam juice!

Very simple and very scrumptious! I have made this often. It's so easy yet so delicious!

Excellent! Used 2 bottles of clam juice, 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of broth from the the boiled shrimp shells. Didn't have large shrimp or scallops so I just added a bag of small scallops with about 2 cups of shrimp. I also added some parmesan cheese, about a quarter cup. Don't skip out on the truffle oil, it really gives the risotto a distinctive taste! Took about 40 minutes to cook the rice... Paired it with the asparagus as well. My 14 year old who NEVER eats scallops and barely eats shrimp came back for more. Needless to say, I'm making this one again.

Loved this recipe! Used 1 bottle of clam juice 1 cup chicken broth and 2 cups broth from the simmering shrimp shells. Also added a couple of extra seared shrimp on top with the scallops and a pinch of parm. Serving on a bed of steamed asparagus was a nice touch, thxs to the cook that made that suggestion!

Thank you once again, Epicurious,for making my friends think that I'm a genius in the kitchen. This was superb - a foodie's delight. I did splurge with a bit of shaved truffle that I was saving for something special. But other than that, a wonderful dish without any changes needed. By the way, served this as a main course and paired with a South African Sauvignon Blanc.

Is it better with white or black truffle oil?

This is a delicious recipe that I'll keep in my box. Like other reviewers, I made a few changes. For the broth, I used 2 bottles of clam juice plus water, and simmered with shrimp shells. I also added 2 white mushrooms, thinly sliced, with the onions, and parmesean cheese. I'd also recommend lightly salt and peppering both the shrimp and scallops before cooking. Both turned out a little bland with no seasoning. Finally, the truffle is a MUST! Do not omit or else this recipe really isn't all that special.

I made this recipe last night. Honestly I wasn't to impressed with the end result. I have made many other risottos with much more flavor. If I make this again, I will with out a doubt use the truffle oil. Im thinking that that will make all the difference. I also used another reviewers suggestions of using shrimp shells to create a stock, instead of the clam juice. Note to self and others, recipes like this probably should not be altered to much : )

Have made this many times and is just delicious! Be generous with the truffle oil!

Super! I used the simmered shrimp shells in water instead of clam juice as xycook suggested. I made a half recipe, using 1/2 lb shrimp & 4 sea scallops, which made 2 generous servings. I used a wild rice/long grain rice mixture instead of the arborio rice, took longer to cook but had a lovely flavor & texture. When I seared the scallops, I added 1 sliced mushroom. I added only 1 T butter to the risotto, & added the peas & served on spinach as emjj suggested & added the grated parmesano-reggiano as xycook did. I also skipped the truffle oil, but sprinkled some toasted pine nuts over the top. This was wonderful & went well with a nice Pinot Grigio.

I used 10 large scallops, 10 large shrimp, and the same amount of rice; it was enough for 3 people for dinner. Delicious. I also skipped the truffle oil because $$$.

Fantastic!! I was a little worried about the clam juice, thinking it would be too "fishy".. but it turned out perfectly! We used carnaroli instead of arborio.. wow! The truffle oil was a perfect finishing touch.

Made this dish for NYE dinner and paired with a sauvignon blanc (Nobilo)- absolutely delicious! I added some parmesean per the recommendation of another reviewer and skipped the truffle oil. Also subbed in fresh parsley for chives. This was my first time searing scallops- the ones I purchased were on the large side, so I seared them a little longer. Elegant dish.

Would give this recipe 3.5 forks if it allowed...very very nice. Used seafood bullion because I had no clam juice. Skipped truffle oil - had none of that either. Added grated fresh Parmesan at the end because risotto isn't risotto without some parm (IMHO). Breaded scallops (about 1 lb) in panko with a bit of parsely and served along side as a main course for two. It would have served 3 nicely, but would have needed more for four people. Really good. Great flavors. Will make again.

I made this as a main course last night for Valentine's dinner, using about 18 small prawns and simmering the shells in the chicken stock instead of using the clam juice, as many have suggested. I added a handful of frozen baby peas to the risotto at the end, and served on a bed of raw baby spinach. The color and texture of the veggies added a nice contrast. Hubby loved it!

I thought that this recipe was excellent. I made it for my Dad, and we thought that it had a nice complexity. That being said, I have to admit that I didn't use the truffle oil. I really hate it when people on this site review recipes only to state that they made significant changes, but I suppose that's what I'm doing. I was feeling broke that day, and even a little bottle of truffle oil was $25 at Whole Foods. But I suppose that it's a testament to how good this recipe is that it can be made without the truffle oil and still be good. I look forward to making this recipe properly one day when I'm feeling less broke.

The truffle oil is essential. My family uses black truffle oil for this recipe and it is absolutely delicious. I recently gave a dinner party for some extended family, doubled this recipe, and the table was in complete silence while everyone ate it. It was THAT GOOD. Maybe add a bit of fresh italian parsley as well as the chives.

Very tasty recipe. Didn't have enough clam juice on hand so used 1 can of chopped clams and 2 cans of broth -- cooked the clams, claim juice, broth and shrimp shells (per advice below) together. Also, didn't have truffle oil which I am sure would have made this taste even better. Added a little Chef Prudhomme's seafood magic for spice. Will definitely make again.

If I could give 2.5 forks, this would get it. Just not the best risotto I have tried, but still good. The only change made was to use 1-2 tbsp. truffle butter since we prefer its flavor over truffle oil.

Very tasty dish. I would use medium size shrimp and twice the scallops next time. Ample salt and pepper required at seasoning time. Overall, while it is risotto which requires you to stand at the stove for a while, not terribly laborious.

As one reviewer suggested, I tripled this recipe to serve 4 as a main course. It was way too much (try doubling and you'll be fine.) The risotto was good, but not at all exciting. There were no strong flavors that jumped out, and not really enough shrimp in the recipe as given. It ended up being a very simple dinner despite the huge amount of time it took to make. I'd try another risotto recipe instead of re-making this one, and seek more flavor---

Definitely a keeper! Don't be afraid to add extra shrimp, and I agree that substituting at least some of the clam juice with shrimp shell-infused broth makes the flavours more subtle. Serve with a white Burgundy.

This is a wonderful light risotto. Instead of clam juice I simmer shrimp shells in water and mix with chicken stock as directed. Using a mild shrimp stock brings forth the shrimp flavor without overpowering the truffle oil or the scallops. I serve the risotto atop of an asparagus sunburst and top with a small amount of grated parmesano-regiano before adding the scallops. Adds richness and flavor complexity. Great on a cold winter night with a fine pinot noir.
