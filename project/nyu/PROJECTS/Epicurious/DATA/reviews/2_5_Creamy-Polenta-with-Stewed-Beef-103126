I made this a few years ago and hunted the recipe up to serve when my family comes for dinner for Valentine's celebration this Sun.

Having read the other reviews, I added tomatoes and garlic (it is Italian after all) and neded to use 2 pieces of beef to get to the quantity required. I only marinated the beef 6 hours but it was enough. Did need to cook it the whole 2.75 hours to tenderness. The sauce was very, very winey as it was. Served it with polenta, as recommneded, but kept sauce chunky (no food processor). Good not great. I must find my old standby Italian pot roast reecipe.

During the simmering, the sauce smelled wonderful; however, when served on the polenta is was surprisingly flat. I added salt and pepper and not much helped. Very disappointing!

Spend much time north of Milan with family and this is a stalwort of the North Italian recipe collection. Excellent version and well worth the effort
