very bland. Added maple syrup and sherry vinegar to add more flavor. Also added some salt, but still not very exciting!

Silver Palette's version is good - butter insetead of olive oil and pistaschios instead of hazlenuts - yumm!

I liked this recipe; it's a good alternative way to serve asparagus, since I serve it at almost every meal during the spring. I agree that it isn't an amazing recipe, but it's a nice diversion from just eating it plain. One thing--I think 6 minutes in water is a long time; I prefer to steam for no more than 5 minutes.

I have to agree with others that this was too bland of a dish. I wouldn't make it again.

I prepared this dish several times - it has a fresh citus after taste. I also added toasted almonds during other preparations.

This recipe seemed like a great idea, but in reality, was pretty bland. A little melted butter is srill a better complement to asparagus.

Ho Hum. Nothing exciting, and the sauce did little to complement the asperagus.

We did not care for this one, not really bad but with so many ways to fix asparagus, this one is off the list. Some melted butter with a touch of garlic and nutmeg and a sprinkle of Parmesan is easier and more to our liking.

Very nice, simple combination of flavors, and reasonably quick and easy, I think.

I served this at Easter and found it to be a nice twist to plain asparagus. Worth the extra effort.

An easy dish to prepare. My guests loved it. The orange sauce gave the asparagus a light tang that all enjoyed. Would definately make it again.

This is good, fast and easy. Even my cats wanted some of it! I couldn't get hazelnuts so substituted toasted walnuts.
