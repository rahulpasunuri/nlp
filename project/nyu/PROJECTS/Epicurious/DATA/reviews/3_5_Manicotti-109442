This was super delicious. We find Ricotta on its own to have a lot less flavor than we prefer so we used 1 part Ricotta, 1 part Mozzarella and 1/2 part grated Parmigiana-Reggiano. The crepes had a great flavor and texture - I'm glad we used those instead of pasta. We also browned some ground veal and added it to the crepe stuffing. I did find it needed a bit more salt than the recipe calls for - but I guess as always salt to taste. I've been thinking all day of family and friends I want to make this for. Delish!

My husband loved this dish! I didn't have time to make crepes, so I used store bought pasta. I used a good quality block of parmesan that I grated myself and whole milk mozzarella (not the fresh one from the deli section). It was still delicious. Sauce was a tad too sweet for my taste, but I will definitely make again. I also had some sauce leftover that I will use for something else.

THIS LOOKS ALOT LIKE THE RECIPE THAT MY GRANDMOTHER WHO IS FROM PALAMO USED TO MAKE -

Because some reviewers thought this was a bit bland, I made a few changes before trying it, and we thought these turned out very well: (1) spiced up the sauce by adding Italian seasoning,fresh ground black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes and a little bit of red wine instead of the water;(2) replaced some of the ricotta with additional Parmigiano-Reggiano and put more of the latter in, anyway; (3) put fresh grated parmesan on top before baking.

First, the crepes are work, but so worth it. They taste wonderful. Second, with the parsley and basil in the garden already coming up strong, and the local tomatoes about to rock (replace some of the canned with fresh), this is so *not* a holiday-only recipe Other than firing up the oven during a hot summertime, the core flavors totally come together with summer.

This recipe rocks. The crepes make all the difference and the tomato sauce is very good. I used good quality Italian tinned tomatos. I also used half ricotta, half cottage cheese to cut down on the expense a bit. While it is a lot of work the first time you make it, it is worth it. Even my fussy 8 year old gave it 2 thumbs up.

Wonderful recipe! I had homemade manicotti at an italian friend's home and just couldn't get the flavor our of my head. This recipe is as good as the family recipe that my friend makes! Perfecto!

I love using crepes vs the usual hard pasta which I could never fill with out ripping. The filling is so rich and filling. I didn't make the sauce because I was pressed for time. The crepes weren't hard to make once I got a hang of making. This will be my only manicotti recipe for now on.

I used a different sauce for this recipe, but made the crepes and filling exactly as directed. I thought it was very good; however, my fiance was expecting something more like what you would get with dried pasta, so he thought the crepes were too soft. He described the dish as "mushy". We had guests, and they all seemed to enjoy it. In fact, they took some of the leftovers, so I think it was more of a personal preference issue. I don't think I've ever had "traditional" manicotti, and I'm sure that I made the dish correctly, so I think the crepes turned out just like they were supposed to. I would recommend the recipe, as long as one is alright with the softer crepe texture and not looking for a more al dente effect. I may not make this again, though, because it was a lot of work and my fiance wasn't crazy about it.

Made this for our dinner club last night and it went over well. The crepes were time consuming (mine took about 2 min each) but not difficult. I doubled the recipe and we ended up with ALOT of extra marinara sauce (not such a bad thing as its quite a flavorful sauce).

This is my go to recipe when anyone requests dinner delivered. I have always used packaged manicotti and it still turns out fantastic. I usually add more garlic than the recipie calls for and use tomatoes in basil for a little extra flavor. I have also made using portabella in the stuffing as well as a local sausage in the stuffing both turned out devine.

I made this recipe for my husband and 3 other couples and ALL said it was the best manicotti they have ever had! I used roasted garlic chopped tomatoes. I will make this a lot!

The crepe recipe is identical to the one my mother taught me when I was young. I'd never make/eat manicotti any other way!

This was absolutely incredible. I've never had cheese manicotti this tasty. It is easy to make and outstanding.

We loved this dish! The crepes added a delicious, slightly-eggy taste, the cheese stuffing was very flavorful. Be sure to use REAL parmigiano reggiano (not the stuff that comes pre-grated in a can) for maximum flavor. I even "cheated" and used a jar of sweet basil marinara sauce, which saved time. Next time I'd increase the crepe recipe since it didn't make 11 crepes--more like 8. Will definitely make again!

I was so happy to find a recipe that is almost exactly the same as my mother-in-laws - the manicotti crepe is easy to make and so light! My family never orders manicotti out as we find it served in a hard noodle dough and not in this light crepe.

The recipe for the manicotti is easy to follow and fabulous. I made my own sauce as so many had problems with the suggested recipe and everyone loved it. I made it last week and the kids want it again this week.

Just wondered what was up with the two pans. It is entirely possible to have a pan large enough to accomodate all of them.

This was NOT worth the effort...almost 2 hours of preparation for a bland dish! And I cooked it according to directions, but the mozarella in the middle was still cold and hard! Had to throw each serving in the microwave for another two minutes. Definitely not worth the time and effort.

I really like the light tomato sauce and fresh crepes but it could use a little spice. The crepes were easy to make but my batter was way too thick as written, I ended up to add about another 1/3 cup of water! Overall fun to make- like Carmela Soprano and her ziti.
