My family LOVED this. I did not strain the tomato sauce - we prefer it thicker. Added a bit of grated nutmeg, a little heavy cream and some red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture.

AMAZING! I was just think about how I need to try a new recipe and this was so easy! My roommate and I loved this. I made it healthy by using fat free ricotta cheese, and it still tasted great. Plus sauteing the eggplant on the stove worked just as well as grilling. Note - brush the pan with oil and poor a smidgen of water over the eggplant less oil is better ;) Have fun making this.. it's great for any occasion!

We just got back from Las Vegas and our favorite restaurant, Firefly Tapas Kitchen & Bar (now 2 locations). Their Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni's are now our favorite vegetarian dish. When we got home I went on the search to find a recipe and came across this one. My goal was to replicate the Firefly dish. Success! I used only goat cheese and added my own twist by including fresh chives and parsley with the cheese. I stewed down some fresh cherry tomatoes for chunkiness and then added these to my home-made sauce. These rolls/cannelloni are like little pillows of goat cheese pleasure. Serve them along with other Tapa's type dishes or use as a very nice appetizer for an Italian meal. This dish does require some extra time in the kitchen but I promise it is worth the effort. Super Yummy! This is going on our list of regular menu items!

Great way to use up tomatoes that are on their way out! I skipped the sugar in the sauce as any sweetness in tomato sauce is a pet peeve of mine. Baked the eggplant and made the sauce the night before so it was easy to put together on a weeknight. I also mixed a little leftover pesto into the cheese; left the cheese in a blob so it was more like a cannelloni than a jelly roll, and baked it with the tomato sauce. I would make it again.

Very good recipe but takes a long time to do. The only change I made was to use feta instead of goat cheese. And I grilled the eggplant on the BBQ made it a lot better IMO. I would defnitely make again but as a side dish instead of a main course. Highly recommend it!

read that they were too oily so I used my Panini Grill and a squirt of oil to cook them-- it worked well. Followed the recipe, but was short on goat cheese. Overall it was good, but all that Moz. made it heavy. I will try it again with less moz., some parma. and more basil and some chopped oil packed sundried tomatoes...

Whie this is somewhat labor-intensive, it's worth it! I got lazy and used a store- bought al'arrabiata sauce, which added a nice kick to the dish. I also substituted bleu cheese for the goat cheese, which worked nicely, and served the rolls over pasta.

Loved this-- added fresh steamed (and drained) spinach, different fresh herbs, and slices of red pepper which hung out the end of the rolls-- looked very pretty. Left out the parmasean, as I thought it would be too salty and it was perfect!

It was a great recipe. I recommend it as a side dish. I made the tomato sauce in the recipe which was, in my opinion, the icing on the cake. It made the flavors balance well. I would recommend letting the dish cool for about 10-15 minutes before serving as the cheese tasted much better after it was warm, not hot.

A REALLY GOOD RECIPE, followed directions exactly. Unusual, great taste combinations, guests love it - - you won't have anything left! Portion size is good, too but keep in mind that even as a side, guests will eat 2-3 of these (I got 8 full slices (using a mandoline) at 1/4"). Had a little of the cheese mixture left at the end so put it on top before final broiling, gave it an attractive look. Didn't make sauce from scratch (just not enough time) but used Newman's Own (plain) marinara sauce which has a very good, spicy taste that compliments the basil and cheese mixture.

This was much differnet than anything I've made before so it was an adventure to make. It was pretty easy, though I used a grill pan so was unsure how the eggplant would turn out but it came out nicely. I think that the recipe calls for way too much cheese mixture, I would reduce it in half the next time around. It is very rich and I think lessening the cheese would reduce the richness. Also, if you don't have parmesean cheese the receipe can do without. But, I will make it again, probbaly as a side.

I love this recipe. But I will say that it is a lot of work but if you love to cook why call it work. I don't use all that oil and I usually buy already made tomato sauce. I have also added Italian sausage to spice it up a bit.

I agree with the cook from Tampa -- too much trouble for not a great result.

Can't rate this because i made my own lazy version. didn't salt the eggplant, just sprayed with oil and broiled each side. then, i made "stacks": slice of eggplant, slice of tomato, (salt, pepper) slice of provolone or any cheese, a few leaves of fresh basil. repeat as you desire. spooned a little left over marinara on the top, baked 15 minutes. topped with a bit of parmesan, voila! we love the lazy version!

A bit oily...lots of trouble (especially when preparing for a large group). However, I prepared the tomato sauce from scratch, peeling and seeding and chopping...after the mixture had cooked for about half an hour, I ran the electric hand mixer through it. Fantastic!

This was delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time is cook the eggplant longer, but other than that it was delicious.

I really love to make this in the summer. Served it at a luncheon with a muscelen salad and tiramisu for dessert. I did cheat and use commercially prepared tomato sauce. No one knew and I had to give everyone the recipe before they left!

We really like this recipe and I have made it many times. I made it as written with the exception of the sauce. I use a very good quality store bought brand and am happy with the results.

This was excellent!! Used my own sauce, used ricotta instead of goat cheese, added garlic to the cheese mixture, and used more fresh basil than called for. Was a huge hit. My husband took leftovers to work the next day, and still tasted great. served with sauteed chicken in white wine.

These were very good. I used ricotta cheese instead of the goat cheese and added some fresh basil to the tomato sauce.

This is an outstanding dish. Besides the basil for the cheese filling, try adding cilantro, oregano and thyme. Excellent! For the cook from Detroit who had difficulty slicing the eggplant, you really need a mandoline to get nice thin slices (the recipe calls this a "hand-held slicing device"). Also, instead ofr 1/4" I slice mine 1/8". Wonderful!

I loved the recipe, but had a hard time slicing the eggplants .. some pieces got burned. But I tried the Ricotta mixture. It was very good. I added some garlic as well.

This was extremely delicious( 3 1/2 stars) but the eggplant was not tender enough for some reason. I think I should have broiled it longer to a deeper golden or had thinner slices. Other than that, it was great. I will make it again and maybe add some red wine and more garlic to the sauce.It is definitely a dish worth trying. Everyone loved it !

One of the best things I've ever made - everyone loved it. Did everything a day in advance, broiled the rolls and heated up the sauce at the last minute. Fabulous!

This was incredible! I served this for a dinner party along with some other dishes and it was rich and different. If you have a vegetarian in your group it would be a great main dish or side dish recipe. It is actually easier to make than it sounds. It can be made ahead and just reheated in the broiler.

I found this recipe incredibly easy to make and delicious. If pressed for time, you can use commercial tomato sauce :)

This recipe was excellent. I served it as a vegetarian entree, along with some pasta and vegetables. My guests really enjoyed it. Tip: get an eggplant that is medium in size, so that it is easier to slice lengthwise. Spread the filling on like frosting, so that it rolls up well. Could use any tomato marinara-like sauce -- this one was fresh-tasting, but not that memorable. Overall, this was very satisfying -- even if you don't typically like eggplant. Try it.

Though I didn't really LOVE this recipe, my boyfriend thought it was great. I will say it was fairly easy to make though, and might be nice for a change of pace.

Fabulous vegetarian entree. My friend, Elizabeth, made it with little Japanese eggplants, too small to roll, so had the idea of layering the ingredients in a pie plate on several layers of Filo dough. It's fantastic this way. I also add a splash of red wine to the tomato sauce.

Tasy, I made the eggplant slices 1/2 inch thick, it made 10 rolls, was enough for 2-3 people. I think it would be good with some toasted chopped walnuts in the filling. My husband liked it without the sauce.

Continuing the "marinara" debate: When I visited Venice recently, I (as a vegetarian) had to be careful not to order "pasta marinara" because sometimes that did mean there was seafood in the dish! Other than in Venice, however, I have only seen "marinara" refer to a simple tomato sauce, no meat or seafood involved.

Okay, a brief etymology for the amateur linguist from Bogota: the use of the word marinara for the sauce can be traced back at least as far as the 1940s to the phrase "alla marinara". Depending on how literal you are being, this can mean either "from/of the sea" or more loosely as it was meant, "in sailor style." In other words, a sauce composed of tomatoes, onion, garlic, spices, etc., the way sailors would cook it. It had nothing to do with fish or other sea life. Satisfied?

Excellent:the concept of rolling the eggplant is worth the "try" and was a hit,I have changed it depending upon what was in my larder:garlic with blue cheese and plain yogurt with cylantro, spinach and keeping the roasted red bell peppers in the mix...highly recommend this one!

Very Good. Fresh tomato's are hard to come by here at this time, so I used a can of crushed tomato's. I also grilled the eggplant. Damn good! Quick and Easy too. I'm sure it's not, but it feels "light" to me. Will definately make this again.

I doubled the recipe easily. I grilled the eggplant instead of broiling. Good advice from NY reviewer - cut eggplant just under 1/2 in. thick, ending up with 1/4in. thick cooked pieces. Doubled all ingredients except goat cheese, which I substituted same amount of ricotta. Freshness of sauce seemed key to balancing flavors. Try with a roasted red bell peppers!

I really enjoyed the recipe and I find the sauce a perfect complement. I don't know why, though, the other cooks call it a marinara, it has no sea-food and as far as I'm concerned "marinara" means "from the sea".

It was pretty rich! I didn't bother with making the marinara from scratch. Be careful to cut your eggplant thick enough because the seedy parts will sort of fall apart. Enjoy!

Easy and tastey. Great way to use eggplant. I used my own marinara sauce recipe. Would definately do again.

As we are located in a town known for scenery not Italian food, we have to make much of our own. This dish is very easy to prepare and looks quite impressive. You can vary it quite easily: either change the herbs or add pinenuts, etc. It's also good without the sauce, simply sliced and tossed with pasta.
