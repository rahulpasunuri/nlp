This is not a beesting cake. Beesting cakes have a custard filling as a Boston Cream Pie might. The name beesting does not come from bee sting, but beeste in old english, or in Anglo Saxonbeost or byst, and the German biest-milch. Beestings is the first milk after a cow has calved. It is thick and clotty. Hence a Beesting Cake has a custard filling.

This cake was not worth the trouble that goes into making it. My family, especially my children, did not enjoy the Bienenstich. I was disappointed with the results.

Although this recipe was a bit complicated for a family dessert, the ice cream was wonderful! and even better when put over the cake. I forgot my list when I shopped so I used Guinness Stout and margarine instead of the butter and ale in the recipe. Cake is great for breakfast too.
