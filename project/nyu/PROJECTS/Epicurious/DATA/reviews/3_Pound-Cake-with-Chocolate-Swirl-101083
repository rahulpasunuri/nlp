Great recipe! I made this New Years Day for house guests with delicate constitutions. They loved the aroma of the cinnamon and chocolate and coming out of the oven they devoured it! I admit to being worried about the consistency of the batter, as it seemed bland and scant, but it rose beautifully in the oven. I did add a chocolate glaze to it.

It's a lovely recipe for say...blueberry muffins...but a pound cake, this is not. I added about 1/4 tsp of salt as other reviews suggested and was a logical addition to me. I'm giving this two forks because this is the wrong recipe if you're looking for what I consider "pound cake".

This was truly not good, and I am an experienced baker. It was too heavy; were I to try it again, I'd whip the whites and fold in at the end. however, there are too many other good recipes around, I'll pass. You should too.

This was quite good, not the best ever but will likely make again. I added about 25% more chocolate. My family, especially 8 year old grandson,thought it was fabulous.

I used salted butter and added 1/4 tsp of salt. It was very good. Good with or without the chocolate swirl.

I made this recipe minus the chocolate swirls and instead made a strawberry shortcake.... Delish

Yes, I figured it out by reading the rest of the directions -- disregard the previous. Glad I didn't display my name with my review!!!

The recipe leaves out when to add the 2 large eggs, but I figured it;

Definitely add 1/4 tsp salt. It makes all the difference. I also omitted the cinnamon and used good quality chocolate. It's a family favorite.

I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SALT. THAT'S USUALLY THE PROBLEM WHEN SWEET THINGS TASTE FLAT. I'M GONNA TRY THIS WITH SALTED BUTTER AND A TSP. OF KOSHER SALT ADDED. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

I should have listened to the reviewers who said this cake is tasteless and not worth making. There is definitely something missing; it tastes flat. I will not make this again. Do not waste your time on it.

While the texture of this cake was grand, the flavor was very lacking. Would not suggest this to those who like their food to have flavor.

This cake is just so-so, nothing special. It was very disappointing, especially since most of the recipes from Epicurious are a hit. My husband agrees that this pound cake is very mediocore. I won't make it again.

This is an excellent cake! Very moist and fluffy with a delicious taste. I like the fact that it has much less butter than typical pound cakes. In addition, I lowered the fat even more by using nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it came out great.

I don't want to sound like a numb nut, but I didn't know how to make the swirl!! HOW did you all do it? I kept swirling in the batter with my knife but nothing happened. Then all the chocolate just sat on top of the cake. The presentation was disappointing, but everyone in the office loved the taste and gave it an enthusiastic two thumbs up. Moist, yet light, not too heavy.

This cake was easy to make. It turned out very moist. My only problem was that I didn't put enough of the chocolate in the center, it would have had a nicer presentation. Next time I'll measure better.

This recipe was tolerable. It was dry and brick-like. It may need more butter or sour cream to moisten it up.

Absolutely delicious. Very moist and tasty. I've made according to directions. Have found that leftovers hard to store with chocolate topping. I have made 2 layers with top layer & swirled both inside. Have problem in finding recipe every time I want to make. This is definately a keep!
