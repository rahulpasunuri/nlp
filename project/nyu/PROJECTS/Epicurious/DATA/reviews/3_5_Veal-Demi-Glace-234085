Friends and I prepared this demi-glace to be used with a wonderful parmesan crusted beef temderloin. The meal was superb and the beef enhanced by this wonderfully rich and flavorful demi-glace combined with a red wine reduction. I will keep some on hand.

I agree with the second reviewer. This is like making your own stock. Use this as the base for your gravy. I'm someone who believes that gravy shouldn't be made after the roast comes out of the oven but a day or two prior to the dinner because it needs time to achieve an appropriately decadent flavor. In a pinch, when can't find veal bones, I've made a variation with beef ribs, but there's a lot of fat to skim off but it's really tasty.

I guess the last reviewer didn't realize that this is a sauce base and not meant to be used by itself. While time consuming, this recipe didn't require an entire baby cow skeleton like some others. Came out as good, if not better than some of the higher end demi glaces that are comercially available. And not at all peppery.

A complete waste of time, lots of time. Too much pepper for my liking and other than the taste of pepper, it lacks any flavor or body.
