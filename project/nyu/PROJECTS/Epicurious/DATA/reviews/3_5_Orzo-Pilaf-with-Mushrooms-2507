One of the best orzo recipes we've ever made - so easy and so delicious! We used homemade chicken stock that we make and freeze - thanks for the tip of adding some salt.

This is a very hearty side dish and goes well with a basic meat entree. I first made this a few years ago to go along side the ribeye steak my husband and I traditonally have on New Years Eve, and it has remained in my rotation ever since. Excellent flavor and textures!

I think it is a three, but it is sooo easy that I have to give it a four. Could make this while dealing with lots of other things in the kitchen!

I was surprised how tasty this was considering the simplicity. Easy, yummy side dish that i will probably make again.

Very easy and very tasty. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, since I'm vegetarian. I also added some herbs de provence and a splash of sherry vinegar. This will be one of my staples.

Decided to try this after the really easy, tasty carrot orzo I tried earliar in the week. Just as good. I thought it had a lot of flavor, even without the pine nuts. Great weeknight dish most people can make with what's in the fridge.

Wonderful!!!! So easy to make, and it tasted just as great as risotto. I would definitely recommend this recipe if you are having a dinner party because you do not have to watch it as carefully as other pastas or risottos. I got rave reviews from my guests and there was not a bite left over.

Quick, easy, and tasty. Went well with fish.

This was very good. I also added some garlic, and added the orzo to the pan (before the liquids) for some toasting. Also a splash of white wine to cook down some before adding the broth. Pretty good side dish and will make again for sure.

Very good but I do add small garlic clove & after onions, mushrooms & garlic have crisped, remove to a bowl then add orzo to same pan & brown about 1/3 of it .. gives it a nutty flavour. Orzo is more versatile than many believe!

I have made this recipe many, many times - and I just love it! If I have a few left over cooked vegetables, I might add them, too. Great!!

Fantastic! I make this recipe over and over again to accompany a wide range of dishes; the flavor is excellent. This is a simple side dish when you need a starch, and it ALWAYS comes out perfect!

My family loved this. I thought it was a 3 forker, but I gave it four forks, cause it was so simple and has become a staple recipe.

I agree with other reviews--it need revving up with more spices and herbs. But that done, it's a nice, easy foil for more interesting meat and poultry dishes, where you don't want an overpowering side dish.

My family loved it. I have already made it twice. Try it, your family will like it too.

This dish was too bland and blah for my taste, even though I added extra herbs. There are many tastier orzo dishes out there. It certainly wasn't bad to eat, just not wow. The toasted pine nuts were key in this dish and likely the best part.

I thought this was too bland. If I make it again, I'll add MORE salt, some pepper and whatever else appeals to me at the moment. It does need something.

My husband will not eat onions so I added garlic. Nice side to Lamb Chops.

A real hit. Warning - do not make this while alone, you may eat the whole thing. A great substitute (may be better than the original: water for broth, season with basil instead of parsley. Be sure to salt to taste.

My very favorite recipe, tastes great and very easy to make. I never have leftovers - unless I'm cooking for 1!!! I do add some spices on occasion, but it's still great.

This was sooooo good. I omitted the pine nuts and it turned out great. I served this with leg of lamb and it was a perfect complement. A must do!!

This dish was very easy to make and quite tasty. It complements many meat entrees very well. I'm sure I will be serving it again. I might add some onion next time to liven it up a bit. I used regular white mushrooms, but I think it would be even better with something more exotic.

This has become one of my staples. It never feeds as many as it says, because everyone wants huge portions. Sometimes I serve this as a main dish with a green salad on the side in the summer... it's also great as leftovers, if you can pry people away from the serving bowl long enough to put it in the fridge. Nota bene: Be sure to add salt, especially if you've used low-salt chicken broth. It makes or breaks the dish.

Very good. Well received by the family. It accompanied Grilled lamb and chicken kabobs, and grilled vegetables. Some of the "fussier" eaters took seconds or said they enjoyed it.

Big hit! Very easy to make!

Very nice. I served it with pork and it was wonderful. Use regular chicken broth, though; it needs the salt.
