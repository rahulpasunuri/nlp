I'd like to try this for Easter. How far in advance can this tart be made? If made in advance (day before), can crust be filled, or will crust become soggy from the filling?

Can the Lemon Tart Receipe be tripled? doubled? Worried that the lemon juice/eggs wouldn't thicken. Made the single one and it was teriffic! Having large group today and want to make it for dessert. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Lemon-Tart-231349#ixzz2O6LTfn5c

This makes a really ice tart. Perfect proportions of crust to filling and a great tart flavor. I just made sure to warm up the sabayon very slowly so as not to curdle the eggs. I never stopped whipping it while cooking and it took a good 10 minutes to thicken up. Perfect light dessert that my guests loved.

This was so easy, but I didn't spend enough time over the double boiler ensuring the curd set. 10 minutes was not enough time for my stove and double boiler. It is important to be very patient and to use a larger double boiler.

The crust made two tarts, but be sure to divide it evenly, or one crust will be a little less substantial. The first one was perfect. Everyone loved it. Three days later I made the second tart and it never set up. I probably should have stirred it longer over the heat. Even after hours in the refrigerator, it was soupy.

Brilliant. I made it as noted with no variations and had no trouble at all. I simply garnished with a few mint leaves and my guests raved. Even with the whisking, this a low effort, straightforward dessert.

Made this last night. All seven guests thought it was a rave, I thought it too sweet. Definitely run it under the broiler and DO NOT WALK AWAY! I topped each piece with two perfect strawberries sliced almost through to stem end and splayed out. If it hadn't been cut, the berries would run round the edge near the crust. Followed suggestion of prior responders. Used 1/2 the crust in an 11" tart pan, and increased sabayon by 50%. It was really gorgeous!

This was an amazing tart--made it twice this Easter weekend. I used Meyers lemons and added some zest to the filling, but otherwise didn't change a thing and resisted the temptation to add berries, etc when serving--it was perfect just as is. My guests agreed! I almost didn't put it under the broiler, but was glad I did because it finished it off just right. Watch it carefully and you'll see tiny bubbles erupt just when it starts to brown up. I've been making the lemon brulee tart on this site for years, but it's got big competition now!

My tart filling never set up. I whisked and whisked and it never became thick enough. I even made a second batch, and it didn't work. The final product tasted delicious, but would have made a huge mess in the tart shell.

Amazing... I have made many lemon tarts and each time I try a new recipe nothing beats my old favorite, but this was exemplary..light and zingy and no cream..perfect... Instead of browning the top under the grill, I sprinkled superfund sugar and used a blow torch..best done on individual pieces as the whole tart gets warm and melts a little..fab..

A lovely recipe; as my first experience making a pie or tart of any kind, this wasn't the MOST easy but it wasn't horribly difficult either. The pine nuts are a bit expensive, though, and I'm looking forward to perhaps trying this recipe with a more affordable nut, like almonds.

Can anyone tell me how long it is safe to leave this cooling tart, with eggs as an ingredient, at room temperature? thank you

I have made this a few times and we all love it. Today I am taking to a dinner party. I made it with an almond crust this time, pine nuts are expensive, plus I don't like Thomas' recipe for three tart shells. The whisking is worth the effort. Serving with vanilla bean whipped cream on the side.

Wow, this tart turned out really delicious. Made exactly as suggested and did not need to change any ingredients.

Simple and divine!! Tweeked it a bit... cut the sugar down to 150mL, upped the lemon by another 30mL. Like fellow Epicurians I made crust from raspberry tart; however, I added fresh lavender 1tsp and rosemary 1 tsp! It came out amazing! Garnished with blackberries.

Rating: 4
This recipe is perfect! The sabayon is luscious and the pine nut crust is subtle and has amazing texture-next time I will try adding a touch of rosemary to the crust as another reviewer suggested. I've tried several different lemon tart recipes, and this is definitely the best!

Rating: 4
Tart met with rave reviews. I needed more than 8 servings so used an 11" tart pan and doubled the filling recipe. For the crust, I made half of the recipe. For half an egg I lightly whipped one egg in a glass measuring cup. It equaled 1/4 cup so I poured out two tablespoons to use in the crust. I skipped the broiling step. I'd like to try macadamia nuts or pistachios in the crust next time since the flavor of the pine nuts just didn't come through for me.

Rating: 4
I make this tart several times a year and love it, as do my guests. I've learned to be patient whisking the sabayon until it sets. It's also important to watch your broiler -- it's easy to go from perfect to burnt in a second. I follow the recipe as written, but I do add grated lemon peel to the filling. If I have some around, I sometimes add some sprigs of fresh rosemary to the nuts and sugar as I'm pulsing the crust. It goes great with the pine nuts -- but don't use too much, a teaspoon or so.

Used the pat in the pan shortbread crust from the Brown Butter Raspberry Tart (also Epicurious) I made last summer. This filling is sublime. I cut the sugar to a generous 1/2 cup and required about 3 minutes of whisking between additions of juice. This was so good I actually sat there muttering to myself through most of dessert about how I never wanted to eat anything else.

First lemon tart I've ever made - and this recipe gave me the best lemon tart I have ever tasted! The pastry base worked so well with the sweet- tart sabayon, not overpowering the "meat" of the tart! It does require a little more work since you have to press the pastry onto the pan with your fingers, but I found this therapeutic. :) I did add a whole lemon zest and mixed in some Meyers into the mix just to add more flavor - Divine!!!

The lemon filling was fabulous. I did try the pine nut crust but preferred the regular tart crust I had used the first time I made this recipe. Definitely the recipe I will use for lemon filling.

Rating: 0
I doubled the filling recipe so as to better fill the tart pan. I felt half full just wasn't right. As in all the lemon dishes I make, I used Meyer lemons off of my tree. They haave much more juice than regular lemons (two make 2/3rds of a cup of juice) and they have more flavor.

Short on time? Make the Sabayon, spoon it into wine glasses and garnish with a slice of lemon. Serve warm or cold... equally outrageously good. Nan from Kingston

I love this tart. I've made it for several dinner parties and its always gotten rave reviews. My only alteration is that since I like things a little more lemony, I add the zest of 1 medium lemon, grated very fine.

This was my first time making a tart au citron. I wasn't sure if I wanted to put the effort into making the sabyon because I'd seen some other recipes that took less work. Glad I did. We were really impressed with the sabyon; it was so good. I didn't make the pine nut pastry but will try it next time.

I loved this recipe! I would add some lemon zest to the egg and sugar mixture to give it even more of a flavorful taste. The crust was delicious and went perfectly with the lemon filling. I have managed to singlehandedly eat three fourths of the tart by myself in one day. Dangerous!

This recipe uses half the eggs that Delia's requires. That said I lacked the 4th egg so used 2 yolks, 1 whole egg and a teaspoon of cornstarch. Also put in some grated zest. The texture and flavour are still perfect. If you have probs w thickening, you need to crank up the heat.

Rating: 4
This was delicious - just the flavor I was looking for! It was a hit at our family lunch. I did not use the crust specified, though. I found something else that was compatible. It also took much longer to cook the filling than what was mentioned in the recipe. If you try this one, you may need to be patient when cooking the filling. I will definitely be making this one again!

Rating: 2
I thought this recipe was much more work than it was worth. I needed to cook the sabayon much longer than the recipe called for and it never got to leaving 'trails' in the bowl as I whisked it. It set but not firmly enough for a nice presentation when the first piece was cut. It was a disappointment and I will look for another recipe the next time I try a lemon tart.

I made this exactly as described in the French Laundry cookbook. It was delicious, and very simple to put together. Loved the bright lemon taste in contrast with pine nuts... delicious!

Exceptional tart, and exceptionally easy! I made 3 small changes: I added a little salt to the crust and the filling, I did not brown the top, and I made 50% more filling. I had accidentally marred the top of the tart after it set. There was still plenty of room in the crust, so I quickly made a half batch of sabayon to pour over the top to cover up my mistake. I used 1 TB of salted butter, as I only had 2 TB of unsalted left, and it actually came out better than the original with a touch of salt, and the 50% extra filled the crust perfectly. Crust was wonderfully crumbly but held together very nicely when cut, and the filling is exceptionally light, not to eggy or custardy, and nicely tart. I did not bother with broiling, as I couldn't figure out what that would bring to the tart except making it ugly! I left it alone and it stayed smooth and beautiful. Perfect end to a nice spring dinner. Went fantastically with fresh strawberries. Would definitely make again.

I wanted something quick so did not make the crust. I used frozen pastry tarts. The filling is delicious and it was so simple. I added a dollop of whipped cream, a blackberry and a mint leaf. They were really good.

I used a different crust (had one made already) but did everything else the same, including the broiling bit at the end. I love it! I was nervous that I hadn't cooked the custard enough- I wasn't quite making trails in the bottom of the bowl- but it set up perfectly anyway. Very light and wonderfully lemony. Not too difficult and a great result.

Loved the pine nut crust! Who knew pine nuts and lemon go together? Reading these reviews convinced me to give it a go. And since I didn't have enough pine nuts for two cups I actually did 1/3 the recipe, including the one egg and worked out great. Don't let the sabayon term freak you out, my eggs didn't scramble and it was well loved by the dinner guests.

I didnt have time to make the tart crust, so I ended up using a frozen crust and I added a layer of fresh blueberries to the pie crust before I poured in the lemon sabayon. It was excellent! So good I'm going to make another one this week!

Having made this delicious tart at least a dozen times during Meyer Lemon season, I tried something different today. I didn't have 4 eggs so I used two whole eggs and 1/2 cup Eggbeaters. I beat them, the sugar and the lemon juice with a hand-held mixer, then whisked them in a double boiler for about 8 minutes, until nicely thickened. I then stirred in only 4 Tbsps. of butter. The tart thickened beautifully, tastes delicious and now has considerably less saturated fat!

oh wow. I think I died. This tart is the best that I have ever tasted, and I have sampled many. Pine Nuts! Lemony goodness! I have no broiler, so I was unable to perform the final step. Nevertheless, the tart tasted like magic. Indescribable.

Rating: 2
The texture was delightful, the preparation very easy and enjoyable, the presentation lovely, BUT there was a very "eggy" flavor that I did not like at all, despite the lemon intensity. And I am a fan of lemon tarts, someone who would stop in every Parisian pastry shop to sample one. Did others find the same thing?

The sabayon truly is exceptional, but I thought that the Pine Nut Crust, though perfectly good, was not nearly as good as the filling! I think next time I may use a different tart crust. I will absolutely repeat the filling!

Rating: 4
Great results with this recipe and definitely worth making it with the Pine Nut Crust. Only caveats, could have used a bit more volume on the sabayon, not sure if I over-whisked or possibly under-whisked. The other note, make sure you taste the pine nuts to ensure they are fresh as they can turn rancid quickly and as you need about $15 worth to make this pastry, you want to be sure they are perfectly fresh.

Delicious! I used a basic pie crust which I found on this site. The pie is so easy to make and yet so yummy! I highly recommend it for lemon lovers.

Yummy and so lemony! I was going to a party of 20 and bringing dessert so I made 20 mini tarts using muffin tins and papers. I made it with regular pie crust (with lard!) and found that by pricking the crust and cooking it at a higher temp they didn't bubble at all. I skipped the last step and decorated with raspberries, blueberries and pomegranate seeds topping them off with some lemon zest - They were the hit of the evening!

I haven't made this although I do make something almost identical: lemon curd tart. For those who find that it's not thickening may I suggest increasing the heat that should help it thicken up.

This is always a hit and I find easy to make...can take a bit longer to mix, but works wonderfully as long as you follow the recipe as to how it looks. I add a bit more lemon. have also tried Key LImes w/ success.

Other than making a third of the pine nut crust, I followed this recipe to the letter and my tart turned out wonderful. The crust was delicate and the filling was creamy and tart. The only change I would make is to add some finely chopped zest with the lemon juice, and skip the end step of broiling the top because it doesn't add any additional flavor and in fact detracts from the smooth and elegant surface.

Rating: 4
I made the sabayon to use w/ a different recipe (as part of a cake) and it was just delicious. I was a little nervous about scrambling the eggs since I'm a rather novice cook. In the end, I did have to strain the mixture through a cheesecloth, but it ended up with the most lovely texture and set up perfectly.

Rating: 0
I made the sabayon and poured it in the tart shell, but it did not stand up. I did not broil it, but I did not think that would make a difference. I cooked it a little longer than the directions said, but it did not seem thick enough so I kept going for a bit longer. Could that have been the reason it didn't set up? Would love to know what I did wrong. The sabayon tasted good, but I can't say it was successful.

Rating: 4
The filling is fantastic, much lighter than regular curd type fillings. I have made this tart several times and used the pine nut crust every time. The crust is nice and crumbly, but if you have another recipe you like, I'm sure it would be fine. Next time I make it, I'm going to try a different crust.

Rating: 4
So good! I didn't use the crust described here but used a pate sucree from Julia Child's "The Way To Cook". I don't know why you can't use a hand-held mixer but I didn't want to risk it so I used a wisk. This tart was perfection.

Rating: 4
This was super simple and tasty. Great balance of tart lemony flavour and creamy sweetness. Like one other reviewer, it took a bit longer than expected to get the described thickness. I think that's just a matter of turning up the heat a touch and stirring a bit slower than "vigourously" as recommended in the recipe. Otherwise, this recipe is a definite keeper.

Excellent filling! - usually add an extra half a lemon of juice and some finely grated zest to the filling- also enjoy a graham cracker crumb crust!

I don't think the crust is anything special, but it is quick. I've made the lemon filling 3 times now. It tastes delicious and tart. However, the first 2 times I made half batches and it thickened nicely and set well. The 3rd time I made it I did a full batch and it took forever to thicken (even after 15mins) and it never set, stayed like soup, once in the tart. I think it probably needed more cooking. It takes a long time when doing a full batch. Delicious though!

Rating: 4
This was fantastic and worth every second! Tart and creamy with a lovely consistency. I did not use the Pine Nut Crust, opting instead for a SUPER easy pate sucre from the Raspberry Tart recipe in Cooks Illustrated. The Sabayon took 12 minutes to whip - 10 to get it to the right consistency to add the lemon juice. I almost gave up, but kept going - thankfully! Also the broiling at the end took more than a few seconds. I HIGHLY recommend it!

My husband is a 'Tarte Citron' fiend and I thought that this might be 'the one'. Unfortunately, it was not really like those from French Patisseries- it was far too sweet and is not typically broiled !I was surprised that Bouchon had adapted the recipe so much. The sabayon gave it a sumptuous, creamy texture that we loved! Reviews on the crust were mixed so I gave it a miss and the results were still delightful. I will decrease sugar to 1/2 cup as it is supposed to be tart, skip the broiling, and give it another try.

Rating: 4
This tart was delicious!! Very easy to make as well. I made the pine nut crust, but per the other comments, added a bit more sugar and some salt - it turned out great. Also, when I'm out of pine nuts, I use almond meal which is less expensive but still gives that great nutty taste to the crust.

Rating: 4
Everyone at the dinner party I took this to said it was the best lemon tart ever. I had concerns about the lemon not thickening (it was a very hot day) and so I added about a teaspoon of corn starch mixed into a paste first with a bit of the lemon custard. Used a regular Crisco crust, which was great, and made them in individual tart pans, topped with a blackberry and a dusting of powdered sugar. I'm not sure if the broiling part of the recipe added much, except for some anxiety and several minutes lying on my kitchen floor staring into the broiler to make sure they didn't scorch. This will become one of my go-to desserts.

Rating: 4
Delicious and Easy! I used 1 part Splenda to 3 parts sugar in both the crust and the Sabayon and it was fantastic. The crust was very light. I made a double batch of the Lemon Sabayon to fill the larger spring-pan. After broiling the top of the tart I added sliced strawberries along the edges for some color. The Sabayon was absolutely delicious - velvety, buttery, tangy, and perfect.

Wow!I was nervous as heck after inviting a professional, cordon blu trained chef to dinner. I made this tart and he (and all my other dinner guests) were blown away. so yummy I ate the small leftover piece for breakfast. I loved the pine nuts. I will make this whenever I want to impress!

I made it 2x. The 1st time I tried the Sabayon, I don't think I cooked it enough, as the filling seemed to soft (but it also was a warm day and the tart sat out during dinner). The 2d time the filling was better consistency, but I still did not love the tart. It's fine, but not a Wow, as I was hoping from a French Laundry recipe. The crust assembles nicely, but could be improved by adding a pinch of salt or maybe using salted butter. The pine nut flavor comes thru, but it's not very sweet, and just bland w/o the salt. I like the crust of the Carmelized Lemon Tart better. The filling is fine (once you are comfortable w/ the Sabayon method), but it's alot more work than the Carmelized lemon tart and the texture is not measurably better. In terms of presentation, the Carmelized lemon tart is nicer w/ the carmelized sugar on top as well.

This lemon tart was very tasty. I loved the sabayon method, really made a difference in texture of the dessert. The crust was a great flavor treat, but didn't hold together very well and was a bit crumbly. Maybe I'll add one more tablespoon of butter. As far as the price for the pine nuts, Costco has a 24 oz. bag for $10. The broiler seemed to do an uneven job browning the tart, so I used my cooking torch to finish the job, being sure to stay away from the crust as it burns more easily. I then sliced fresh lemon (with a mandoline for even slices) and placed one in the center with four others twisted on the sides. Great dessert, beautiful presentation.

This tart had a wonderful fresh lemon taste. It was just as good the second day. I know I'll make this many more times in the future!

This is our all-time favorite dessert. The pine-nut crust complements the sweet-tart lemon sabayon perfectly. I always serve a Mascarpone cream on the side as per the original cookbook, except I substitute maple syrup for the honey - a delicious taste twister. The cream is easy to make: 1/2 cup whipping cream, whipped until frothy; add 3 Tbsp mascarpone and 1-2 Tbs maple syrup. Beat with mixer until thick, about 3 minutes.

This was very delicious and pretty fast and easy too. I took it to a picnic, and got raves all around. I'm definitely going to use this technique to make lemon meringue pie filling. It doesn't have the "eggy" taste that turns me off with most lemon pies and tarts. I think I am going to try it with a different crust recipe though. The pine nut crust has a great flavor, and I love how it's pressed into the pan, but pine nuts are so expensive!

This is one of the most flavourful lemon tarts I have ever had the pleasure of serving my guests. It was not EGGY, as previous lemon tarts I have prepared and the fresh lemon juice is a must. I used a shortbread crust, as follows, and it was absolutely delicious. Crust - 1/2 cup butter, softened, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 cup white flour. Combine butter and sugar until smooth. Add vanilla and flour and mix to form a ball. Press into tart pan and bake until golden. My compliments to Thomas Keller.

I liked the lemon curd portion of the recipe, however, the crust was terrible. The tart looked beautiful, but it was too crumbly and did not slice well. It completely fell apart. The flavor of the crust was just okay, not really great. I followed the recipe for the crust and the curd precisely. Perhaps the crust needs another egg for better binding. Any suggestions?

This version of lemon tart is exquisite and so easy to make. I often find the crust with lemon tarts to be soft and bland. This one gives a great taste and texture contrast to the creamy, buttery, tangy lemon topping. The crust also doesn't need rolling and can be pressed into the pan with the fingers, which is a great time saver. There were seven of us eating this last night and there was plenty for three people to have second servings. (Extraordiny, because one of them is a wowser re fatty foods and seldom even has desserts.) If anyone has a better version of this tart I'd like to see it, because this is the best I've ever tried.

i reviewed this early on and realized the second time I made the crust that I had put in to little butter the first time -- that's why it didn't hold together. Now I've made it several times with all the butter. It's fabulous. I've made this tart at least a dozen times since then and it never fails to make people happy.

I make grapefruit tarts and have been looking for a good custardy filling to go with it. This is a great, and I substituted the lemon juice for grapefruit juice. The yellow tart by itself was beautiful after broiling, but seemed naked without red and white grapefruit on top. I think this tart is too sweet without something like grapefruit to balance it out. The pine nut crust sounds like a good idea, but I was non-plussed. It seemed like a waste to grind it up, and have so little flavor/visual impact. I usually put pistachio nuts in my crust, very coarsely crumbled. The color and the flavor is much more apparent. A great crust recipe in general though, and will probably use it from now on in other tarts.

I made this last night and it's all gone -- and there's only four of us. I make lemon tart a lot, but this one is different with the pine nut crust. I can't say I liked it better than my usual flaky crust/curd combo, but my kids thought the texture was fabulous (the 12-year-old ate half of it himself). Good thing the crust makes three tarts! The crust, btw, never really came together like dough, but once you press it in the pan, it doesn't matter.
