I just made the sauce and it turned out way too thin. You basically had to serve the sauce cold for it to be the right consistency. Waste of good chocolate.

My experience was completely different--the brownies turned out too dry and crumbly. I used an 8x8 glass pan, did the foil thing, and cooked them as directed. The flavor was very good, but the texture sort of ruined the dish...the sauce and ice cream were both necessary.

My boyfriend requested the chocolate/peanut butter combination for his birthday dessert, and this is recipe he picked out from the choices here. The brownies were fabulous, very moist, and the sauce was delicious. If you choose to make this recipe, I'd suggest some high quality peanuts--I think those make a tremendous difference, also a high quality vanilla ice cream. Somebody else did my shopping for me (what was I thinking?) and the dessert suffered, I thought, from using some Edie's football icecream (too sweet, too much happening in it), and cheap unroasted peanuts were purchased in error. I tried pan roasting them, but it's not quite the same effect. Some of those great Virginia peanuts would be great. A recipe note. The whole foil thing was extremely confusing, and it never does say what sized pan to use. I used an 8X8 square--could have used a 9X12. I ditched the foil, it didn't make much of a difference. If you use an 8X8, the cooking time will be longer. I think mine took almost twice the recommended time. Just keep checking them!
