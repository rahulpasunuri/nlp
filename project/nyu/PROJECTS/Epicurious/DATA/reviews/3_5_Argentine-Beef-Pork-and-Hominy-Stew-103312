It costs a fortune to make this recipe, and it doesn't taste good enough to merit the big expenditure. My husband liked it until he bit until a chunk of cartilage, and then that was the end of that. I would only recommend this dish if you have a big budget and you don't mind the, er, less glamorous aspects of meat.

I always try to nake the recipe the way it's written the first time, but this one was just too much meat for me and not enough other flavors-- I'd start with about half the pancetta and cut down the number of meats.

The addition of onion and crushed red pepper completes this wonderful dish. I cannot wait for the opportunity to delight dinner guests with this recipe.

We were served this dish at a party and it was outstanding. I'm making it, one week later for my own party.

This recipe is very close to the original one we make here in Argentina. Just a tip to add more zest: Thinly slice two onions, fry them (olive oil is best) until they soften and brown lightly, take out of the fire, add two tablespoons of pimentón (spanish paprika - can be substituted by paprika if pimentón is unavailable) and one teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Add to the locro before serving and mix well.

I made it just like the recipe stated (I always do), and it was outstanding. Just the thing for fall.

This is as close as the recipe any argentine person would give you,but we,argentinians only make this recipe when we are going to have a LOT of guests for dinner,since so many ingredients forcefully makes a lot of stew.

Couldn't find chorizo so I substituted spicy Italian sausage instead for added zip. One habanero pepper was also thrown in for good measure. Would use onion also the next time. I cut this recipe in half and it still served 10!
