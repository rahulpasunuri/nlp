Brilliant. Easy and tasty. I substituted lime juice for the lemon because I was making it for a raspberry lime tart (which was wonderful btw). This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good. Sweet, so is good with fresh fruit. I made it with salted butter, and it still tasted fabulous. I used it on a peach tart, which got rave reviews.

After trying four other pastry recipes, I found this one. What a dream to prepare and roll out! And everyone raved about the chocolate pecan pie that topped it.

This is so easy and rolls out like a dream. Tastes like sugar cookies! Use often.
