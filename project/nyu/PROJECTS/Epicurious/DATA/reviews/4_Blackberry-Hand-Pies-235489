Really quite good. Used my food processor with dough blade. Made the double batch. Well worth the effort for homemade dough.

I made these twice in two days with blackberries I'd picked on my street. I love the filling! Its the perfect sweetness and thickness. It also makes way more than you need for the recipe. I was using about 1-1.5 TBLS per pie and was left with enough to make 12 more the next day. First round I used Martha Stewart's pate brisee and it was just ok. Second time I used the pie crust referenced in the recipe and found it superior. It was super flaky. I liked the bit of shortening with the butter. Just perfect. I did find the handpies did not brown like expected so next time I would use an egg wash vs. milk. I also sprinkled the top with turbinado (Sugar In The Raw) for an extra sparkle and crunch. Huge hit with adults and kids and could be used with a variety of berries and fruits.

These are so easy and turned out great, though my squares weren't so neat and the filling was oozing out of most them. The filling is delicious. I used the Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe - following another reviewers suggestion. The directions for the crust are confusing the way they're written - you should have two pieces of dough 3/4" thick and then roll out to 1/4" thick. I still don't get how you end up with just five squares from second piece. Either way, these are worth making.

OK thanks.... I think it could be clearer but now I get it...

READ the recipe carefully: half the dough 3/4" thick INTO a 16X11 rectangle. I prefer homemade puff pasty or perfect pie dough recipe

Question: 3/4" thick? Did anyone make the crust that thick or is that a typo? Thanks!

20 pounds of berries from the U-Pick farm forced me to seek out new ways to bake with raspberries. This recipe turned out way better than I expected. Based on the other reviews I was a bit skeptical of the dough but I made it anyway, using my food processor. The dough looked way more crumbly and dry than my other pie crust doughs have appeared, but as the instructions say, if it holds together when you squeeze it, it's good. I followed the recipe for the filling, substituting raspberries and using apple sauce for the apple. They didn't brown in the oven much (I think an egg wash would do the trick). In any case -- they were delicious. Flaky crust, perfect filling. I cut the dough into rounds with a ceramic bowl and got 11 pies out of the dough. I'll make these again tomorrow. Seriously.

I didn't quite make this recipe - I used frozen blueberries and no apples, and freehanded the sugar measurement. But I did use the semoline as a thickener. I'd never used it before and was a little surprised at how well it worked. After cooking the filling I was a little dubious - the flour gave it a kind of a gritty texture that I didn't like. But after the second baking in the pastry crust (I made it once with a pate brisee for the hand pies and once as a tart filling using a pate sucree), the texture smoothed out and it thickened the blueberry filling very well. This will work very well for berry fillings in general.

I absolutely LOVE the recipe for the filling. I have now made it three times with different adjustments. The first time I stayed true to the recipe and it was easy and good, though a little sweet for my taste. The second time, I omitted 1.5 Tbs sugar and added vanilla, which made the filling delicate and floral. I just made it with a mix of blueberries and golden raspberries and it might be the best yet! Highly, highly recommended for fillings. It also gives me just the right amount of filling, as I roll my dough about 1/4 thick. I have had no luck with the pastry dough for this recipe. I've tried it twice and neither time yielded a texture or taste that I liked, so I've been using Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe, which has worked perfectly each time.

very good base recipe! You can adjust the sugar and cinnamon to your taste. We found some wild blackberries growing in a nearby field so I had to improvise. I used apple sauce ( 1/4 c) for the apples and 1 T flour for the semolina. I would like to make them again. I think they wold make excellent gourmet Pop Tarts!

It makes a lot more blackberry filling than one can use in the # of pies that even a double pie dough recipe makes. And agree with the poster that said 3/4" is way too thick. That leaves you all crust and no berries. I used about 1/4" thick and worked hard to fit more berries in. Loved the green apples cooked in - gave it a very nice "zing". Used the excess blackberries for topping ice cream. Yummy recipe.

Very easy! I used this as a pie filling, substituting Minute tapioca and flour for the semolina. Was absolutely delicious servied with vanilla ice cream.

So quick and easy! I used frozen puff pastry sheets, cut them in fourths and made several larger pop-overs instead of the smaller ones. I also used less sugar than the recipe called for. Delicious!

I'm not sure why this recipe gets such stellar reviews. Don't take me wrong - it's not bad, but it is mediocre at best. The pastry dough is far too buttery and weighs down the light, barely sweet filling - which was delicious - probably the only redeeming part of the dessert.

Excellent, quick and easy. I only had Braeburn apples so I used them instead. I made it for coffee with my in-laws and my father-in-law ate three!

One of the best fruit desserts I have ever made, although I too, used another pastry dough recipe to save time/anxiety. The combination of blackberries and the apple is delicious. Rave reviews from all.

I only made the filling but I have to say it is really tasty. I used regular all purpose white flour instead of the semolina flour. Otherwise, made the filling as directed. Very good, will make again and try the "little pies".

I just found this recipe a few weeks ago and I've already made them twice! These pies are beyond delicious, especially when served warm with vanilla ice cream. I made them for a family dinner and each of my brothers ended up eating two at the table and then taking two home with them for later! I just love the blackberry, apple, cinnamon combo! While I normally make my own dough, I found that if you're in a hurry, the roll-out pie crusts you can buy from the store work just fine!

This recipe is so easy and the filling delicious. Like the others I used an alternative dough so I can't answer to that just the filling.

I thought this was a great recipe for kids much more fun and interactive. I too made the pastry thinner and also made my own pastry. Will try round next time

These hand pies are delicious! However, I liked them more when I cut the dough into circles rather than triangles - I was able to fill them with more fruit. Also, the recipe says to roll the dough 3/4 inch thick, which is very unneccessary. I rolled mine about 1/4 thick, and everything stayed intact. Bon Appetit!

These were really yummy! I used my own recipe for the dough, so I can't rate that, but the filling tasted very good with just the right amount of sweetness. I used regular white flour instead of the semolina. Just be careful as the filling leaked out of the pies while they were baking so it was a little messy.
