we love this dish, it's perfect as an appetizer or if it's just the two of us it's a great meal with a baguette and salad

You serve the dish in a bowl with broth and mussels in the shells. Have a separate bowl on the table or for each person to collect the mussels shells. To eat, you pull a mussel off of its shell, add some broth and eat like a soup (spoon works best of course). Be sure to really clean the mussels before hand so that the broth ins't granular.

Hey Canada! They're mussels, eh! How do you usually eat mussels steamed in a liquid? Put mussels (in opened shells) in bowl, pour accumulated sauce and solids over mussels, serve.

All right, what do you do when the mussels are cooked? Do you shell them? Are they served with the sauce on the side?
