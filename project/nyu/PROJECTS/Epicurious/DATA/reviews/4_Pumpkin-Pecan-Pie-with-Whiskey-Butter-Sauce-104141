If you like pecans you'll love this pie. I will definitely double the pumpkin layer if I make it again.

I doubled the pumpkin filling and agree this is a great idea. The booze sauce is going to last a while. it takes just a bit for each slice.

Made this last night for book club..it was a big hit. After reading other reviews, the changes I made to the recipe: 1) I used a the entire can of pumpkin (15 oz) but kept the seasoning the same -no extra sugar 2) I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to the pumpkin mixture to make sure it firmed up 3) After I added the pumpkin to the pie crust I baked it for 15 mins, before adding the pecan mixture. 4)I decreased the whiskey to 1-2 Tbl

I've been making this pie for years because my son loves the combination of pecans and pumpkin. The way I make this pie has evolved over the years. Year 1, I followed the recipe to the letter except for the whiskey sauce (too much and not kid-friendly). I baked it much longer than the recipe calls for and the filling still would not set. In the process, I burned the crust and very nearly burned the pecan sauce too. Clearly, some thickening agent was needed. It took several experiments to figure out that one tablespoon of corn starch makes a filling of perfect consistency in about 45 minutes of baking. Now, my son took over and makes the pie himself. We still omit the whiskey sauce and we make a different crust--with hazelnuts, very tasty.

I made this for a pie contest and won -- it's a really delicious pie! I doubled the pumpkin mixture based on other reviews. Also, the pecan mixture sank into the pumpkin mixture, so I did not have a uniform pecan topping as pictured. I might try baking it with just the pumpkin mixture for a while before adding the pecans next time.

This is a FABULOUS pie, also great made with sweet potatoes. I do it for Christmas, Thanksgiving and anybody who love pecans. I add an extra egg yolk to the pecan syrup and probably double the pecans (just eyeball it)... actually, I'm never very specific with the amounts and it always turns out brilliantly.

I made this pie for a New Year's party one year, and had rave reviews!!! There was not a crumb left! I agree there could be more pumpkin filling, I'm going to double it next time, with a bit less sugar. I'm also using my own pie crust recipe, I use half butter, half lard (NOT crisco) and a bit of vinegar in the ice water, it acts as a binding agent, and you can't taste it. I get rave reviews over this crust as well. Let me just say, the whiskey butter sauce is absolutely delicious! I had people taking shots of it they thought it was so good, definitely don't skip that step! (you can use any kind of whiskey, I've used Rye whiskey even, I'm going to use Jack Daniels this time).

I made this as a pudding (in a glass pie pan) for Thanksgiving because I'm gluten-free. Other than making as a pudding, I followed the recipe as written, but didn't bother with the sauce. I buttered then floured (with white rice flour) the pan and this made a fabulous pudding! Creamy, rich, decadent, and great for the holidays. Also very easy to make. In the future, I'll cut the sugar considerably, and cut the corn syrup by probably half. It was really sweet and would probably be just as good with less sugar. I'll definitely make this again.

This is the best pie I've ever made, and I've made plenty of pies. The whiskey sauce is a little tricky if you don't have a double boiler, but just take it low and slow. Again, this is an absolutely fantastic recipe. If you make it, you're guaranteed to impress your guests!

This is a great pie! I make it every year for Thanksgiving, and for my eight-year old daughter's birthday and as requested. I double the pumpkin filling and don't make the sauce. Delicious pie, beautiful presentation, and easy crust. Always gets rave reviews from guests. Stores well, too.

This dessert definitely got the attention of everyone at the table. It was extremely rich. I doubled the pumpkin and it still wasn't pumpkin-y enough. I thought the sauce was kind of overkill with the pie being so sweet. Some people commented that the bourbon was too strong for their liking, even without the sauce.

Well this year for Thanksgiving I decided to try my hand at baking a "from scratch" pie. I must say as a person who has only had experience with the boxed fillings and frozen shell pie crusts I was rather surprised at how easy it actually was.. The Pie crust was simple to make and wonderful! It had just the right consistancy (Much better than the frozen kind I might add). I took the advice from the previous posts I doubled the pumpkin filling; & I agree that it could have used a bit more to fill the crust a little bit more. (but not much b/c the filling puffs up while it is baking and then settles a bit as it cools). For me the pie was a little too sweet. (But my southern inlaws loved it just the way it was) If you are like me i would cut the sugar. If you double the pumpkin filling as I did; I would use 3 tablespoons instead of 4. I would also cut the sugar a bit in the pecan syrup (carful not to cut too much b/c my southern grandmother in law says "that's what gives the pecan top it's pretty crust"). I didn't make the wiskey butter sauce due to lack of liquor & time. Can't wait to make another one to try the sauce with it. All in all, it was a total hit! Plus the family requested I make it every year! Nothing like trying a new recipe for the first time and it's all of a sudden a family tradition! Thank You Epicurious!

LOVE IT!!! Perfect for those indecisive ones like me who can never decide which pie to have! I doubled the pumpkin filling as other reviewers suggested. It was perfect-I baked in in a deep dish and it was nice and substantial looking. It did take about 2 hours 10 min though because of the thickness. I also doubled the amount of pecans. I will definitely make this one again!

This pie was delicious! I followed the recommendations and doubled the pumpkin pie filling, made the sauce, and served it with whipped cream. I was a bit disappointed that so much of the pecan filling was absorbed by the pumpkin pie filling underneath, therefore not allowing for two separate layers, like I had imagined. Next time I will cook the pumpkin layer for a bit first to create this separation. I also made the whiskey sauce with mary jane, which took the desert to another level of enjoyment. A recommended addition to the sauce, for sure!

Great! Definitely double the pumpkin pie filling. Mine took a little longer to cook as a result. I'd omit the pecan layer (mine was a bit hard to cut through) and the sauce. But deelish none the less

If you're willing to forgo Thanksgiving tradition of simple pies, use this receipe. The result is an ultra-rich, decadent treat. The saucewith its unambiguous whiskey punchis perhaps not necessary; but if you make it, you'll find yourself secretly spooning tastes in the corner long after the pie is gone.

I made this pie for my Minnesotan family's first Thanksgiving dinner in Texas -- it seemed appropriate. I ended up having to alter it, as my sister doesn't have a springform pan, and my brother-in-law is allergic to milk, so all dairy was either substituted or left out (left the sauce out entirely). Even with that, however, the pie was delicious. The flavors came together really well. I'm not sure if it was because of my alterations or what, but the pecan syrup portion ended up a bit dry (and I like pecan pie goey), so if I make it the same way again I might not add the syrup until a little further along in the baking. All in all, much more exciting than regular pumpkin pie.

Rating: 4
Very nice pie, definitely worth repeating. Since I'd already made a crust, I used it in place of the one specified, molding it into the specified 8 inch springform. Taking the cue from others, I opted for sweet potato (which I'd baked the day before) and very slightly upped the quantity of spices. Using Knob Creek gave the sauce quite a kick, but I can't say I found it excessive. As the first of my Christmas desserts to disappear, I'd say it was certainly a success!

This was awesome! I made a few MINOR adjustments based on other reviews. I doubled the whole pumpkin recipe (and thought it could have actually used a little more). I also added a splash of bourbon to the pumpkin section, and good amount of bourbon the the pecan section. The sauce was what I was worried about, I did not want it to be to like pouring bourbon on my pie. I ended up burning off some of the bourbon (i used more than what the recipe called for to give it room to burn off so that I was left with about 1/4c). It is VERY important if you do this to let it then come to room temp, as well as allowing the butter sugar mix to come to room temp before adding the cream and bourbon (my sauce broke the 1st time around). With the sauce, I didnt have white sugar, so I used brown, and it was really good- i plan on only using brown sugar in the future. I think I may have whipped the whole thing longer than the recipe inteded...it was somewhere between a sauce and a whipped cream - everyone loved it!

Superb! And this despite my pecan topping not caramelizing properly. I too doubled the pumpkin filling, used whole pecan halves and 1.5x crust for a 9" springform. I baked for about an hour, then turned off the oven and left the pie in overnight. In the fridge in the morning until the evening when we had it after the whole Thanksgiving meal. 11 people couldn't get through half of this (and a 1/4 of the Dark Chocolate and Orange Tart), although they were all Thanksgiving virgins. Beautifully moist and fluffy, and the pastry was just right, just substantial enough to contain things, but not stodgy.

This was outstanding, and got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. As others suggested, I doubled the pumpkin filling. For those of you at altitude, this required no adjustments. The whiskey butter sauce was good, but I will skip it next time.

Very yummy, doubled the pumpkin puree but next time I'll make my own puree instead of using the tinned stuff. I'm sure it'll make a big difference in flavor. Also, the pecan topping overwhelms the pie even after doubling the pumpkin puree so next time around I'll halve the pecan syrup. If using a spring form pan, definitely put a pan under it when baking so you don't end up with a smoky burnt mess in your oven. I used this pie crust recipe from another epi menu, and I used the entire dough at the bottom - made a thick flaky delicious bottom to an already thick pie. Definitely try it!

Rating: 4
This is crazy delicious! Rave reviews from everyone. I made it gluten free by using a pie crust from Whole Foods. Instead of a springform pan I just used the pie tin and it fit perfectly with no spill over. I doubled the pumpkin and used the whole 15oz can. Mine cooked an additional 20 minutes and the knife came out a little gooey but couldn't let it sit in the oven any more. It was fine. The sauce ended up not getting made but would have easily thrown this pie farther over the top than was necessary.

i made this for thanksgiving, and wow, what a hit! even grandma was piling on the whiskey sauce. i left it optional on the side, in case people thought it might be too strong, and people were putting it on their other desserts! i used my own pumpkin puree, and drained it over paper towels and a colander for about a half hour before it was needed so the pumpkin filling would stand up. i also found the crust a little hard to cut, it fell apart somewhat.

Rating: 4
This is SO RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. I roasted a fresh pumpkin, which made a big difference compared to other pumpkin pies I've made. Much more depth of flavor. (Make sure you drain the pumpkin 8 hours if you do this - I could see watery pumpkin being a problem with the pecan topping). I doubled the pumpkin component of the recipe as suggested by others, and I can't imagine not doing so - there definitely wouldn't have been enough pumpkin. I also used my own crust recipe. AND the whiskey sauce - wow. Make it. I used half as much whiskey as called for, and it was plenty boozy. I think all of it would be overwhelming. Also, I doubled the whiskey sauce recipe cause it seemed like not enough, but now I have tons of whiskey sauce and no pie. So don't do that.

I made this for friends last night and it was a hit - everyone loved it and asked me to make it again. I doubled the pumpkin as others suggested. If you do this, be sure to use a 9" deep pie dish. I loved the whiskey butter sauce but some of my friends thought it was too strong. When I make it for family at Thanksgiving, I'm going to try it with 1/2 as much whiskey.

Absolutly fabulous! I made this last night (along with the Rustic Pear Tart) for a dinner party. It was polished off in no time with recipe requests from everyone. As I only had a 10" springform pan, I made 1.5x crust, doubled the pumpkin filling ingredients and increased the spices. It took about 20 minutes longer to cook. This is my new favorite fall dessert. Can't wait to make it again!

Oh my! Utterly DIVINE!!! Made this last night for as a finish to a 7 course gourmet meal. It truly was A-MAZ-ING. I did as suggested and doubled pumpkin filling. I wasn't going to make the sauce, but other reviews made it seem like I should, so I am so glad I did. The sauce really does make it that much better. I also baked a pie pumpkin to make filling, it was perfect 2 c. of pumpkin. And worth the extra time, flavor was perfect:)

I've been making this pie for at least two years, maybe more. I found it searching this great site for a pumpkin pie with a little more interest. I have always added bourbon (1-2 T) to both my pecan pie and pumpkin pie recipes. The bourbon sauce takes it over the top, but in a good way. You could omit it, though, esp. if you add bourbon to the filling. I increase the pumpkin ingredients to 1.5. Everyone LOVES this and it is DECADENT! What could be better than a pumpkin pie topped with a pecan pie! Love it! Make it, you won't be sorry. It is really not at all difficult.

Per another reviewer, I doubled the pumpkin filling, and everyone thought it was the best pumpkin pie ever -- I think because it didn't have any milk in it. The pecan topping is sweet and crunchy, a nice contrast to the custard. I didn't make the whiskey butter sauce; didn't need it.

There are many pumpkin pie recipes to choose from on epicurious. I have tried a few, and while many are good ... to me, this is the best in terms of taste and sheer presentation! The pumpkin filling for this pie is excellent - perfect consistency ... but I do add more spice as suggested by other reviewers. I have also increased the filling to make a larger pie with equal success. Finally, I found the rustic crust to be a snap to prepare and beautiful when served. If you are a fan of pecan and pumpkin pie, this is the pie for you. PS The whiskey sauce is a to-die-for addition!

Made this for a Thanksgiving dinner with new family members. It was good, but even better after a day or so.The flavors mellowed out some. I loved the crust, I found it wasn't too delicate to work, and it was nice in a spring form pan..I'll definitely try that again.

The pie was good. I made it in a regular fluted pie dish. I doubled the pumpkin and did 1 1/2 times the pecan topping.. Next time I would do 1 times the pecan and keep the double pumpkin! The sauce had a nice flavour but did not turn out.. I am sure that too much wine (me) had a play in that! Three forks this time will try again!

Wow! Count me as one of the chorus on this one. I made this last night as a trial run-up for T-Day, and the tasters were in agreement that it was delish. It'll be on my table again in two weeks, and I think for many Thanksgivings to come. I served it with the whiskey sauce, and loved it. Later had a big piece before I went to bed (and another for breakfast) without the sauce. Both are wonderful. The whiskey sauce gives it an unusual & sophisticated touch, and another flavor layer. But the pumpkin tends to be a little overwhelmed, and when you don't make the sauce the pumpkin is subtle but definitely there. I cooked it for an additional 20 minutes - when I first took it out it was a little "gooey", so I put it back in for additional time. I also used refrigerated crust, which was fine. This is slightly less sweet than traditional pecan pies.

FAB U Lishus !! I made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I had to look the reciepe up again after my move to a new house. Well worth the time it took to find it. I used sweet potato also, as this replaced my usual Sweet Potato pie. I'm making it again for this Thanksgiving, it's becoming a tradition. The Whiskey butter sauce is a great topping for this and other deserts as well.

amazingly fool proof! I had never attempted baking before, crazy to start w this one, but wow! I bowled myself over :) Exactly as recipe says, worked perfect!

I'm kind of surprised that hasn't been mentioned to the Crying Cook. It's separate!

This was AMAZING!!!! Definitely don't skip the whiskey butter sauce . . . that's what makes the pie. The only thing that didn't work for me was the crust recipe. When I followed the recipe, the crust was too crumbly to roll out, so I subbed in my usual crust recipe (for which I use butter for 2/3 of the fat, and shortening for 1/3 of the fat . . . find that this makes the pastry more forgiving and easier to work with).

Tried this one out for Thanksgiving sans whiskey butter (teetotalers visiting) and it was a tremendous success. Found that you MUST double the pumpkin portion of the recipe if you want to "fill" the springform pan. Also, the roll out pie crusts work in a pinch. Making again for Christmas holiday dinner at two different occasions and expect similar results!

Well I made this again and this time I let the puree to drain longer and the consistency was a lot better. Unfortunately, and countertop oven users take note, when baked at 325 the top burned long before the alloted cooking time was up. Next time, I will try baking it at a lot lower temp if I use my countertop oven which may not be an option until my regular oven gets fixed. :-(

Yum! The pie is so darn tasty, the whiskey sauce isn't needed and even pales in comparison. To save time and work, I used premade pie crusts which were fine. My pumpkin mixture came out a little soupy, probably because I used homemade pumpkin puree rather than canned. The pecan topping was out of this world, but sank into the pumpkin mixture instead of sitting on top, undoubtedly because my pumpkin mixture was too watery. But it was still delicious and everyone loved it. I'll definitely add it to my recipe box and will make it again and again. In fact, I'm planning on making it today with more leftover Halloween pumpkin.

The ingredients in this pie really complemented each other, so the flavor of the pie filling tasted great, but the nuts on top burned when left in the over for too long! I took the pie out so that the nuts wouldn't burn but the crust wasn't quite done. In short, it was a pie with a great idea behind it but without a great method of execution.

Made this for thanksgiving this year. Followed directions fairly closely with the exception of using a 9" springform pan instead of an 8" and I used southern comfort instead of whisky. Turned out beautifully with the exception of the crust falling in on to the topping for about 6". Still looked amazing but I'm fairly sure it did this because I didn't chill the dough long enough as I was in a rush. The whisky (southern comfort) butter sauce was good and a nice add but I didn't think it necessary.

This incredible pie is greater than its parts, and the whiskey butter sauces raises it from sublime to divine. Thanks to the excellent advice from previous reviewers, I increased the pumpkin to 2 cups (1 can of One Pie brand). In process, I discovered I had no corn syrup, so subbed maple syrup instead, reducing the amount to 1/2 a cup. I also used my own butter crust recipe, and baked it in a 91/2" pie plate. I am normally not a pumpkin nor a pecan pie fan, but I loved this, as did my guests. We all agreed both the pie and the sauce were even better the next day, particularly the sauce. I will make it many more times.

This pie is awesome. I thought the pumpkin and pecan really worked well together. I made it in a regular pie plate which was fine.

This recipe was a hit and got rave reviews from everyone. I couldn't tell you if I liked it because there wasn't any left for me by the time everyone else was done with it. The sauce is what everyone wanted the recipe for. I used Southern Comfort (didn't know what I would do with nearly a whole bottle of wiskey afterward). As for cooking it: I wasn't sure what "coating the back of a spoon" was supposed to mean. My first try was too thin...on the second try, I cooked it until it didn't dribble off the back of the spoon (took longer, held over direct heat just shy of actaully bubbling to speed the process). My pan was bigger than 8" so I 1 1/2 both parts. Used a Betty Crocker Boxed Crust (3/4 of it...made tart shells with extra)

I made this pie for our Canadian Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. After reading all the reviews I doubled the pumpkin filling--this was a good move.

Sorry guys, I agree completely with "Cook from Oakland, CA". Was disappointed after all the rave reviews. The Whiskey Butter Sauce overwhelmed the pie. The pie's sweetness would have gone much better with a plain or slightly sweetened whipped cream. Followed the recipe to the letter, looked great but found the pumpkin layer non-descript. Will try one of the chocolate/pecan pie recipes next time when a traditional pecan pie isn't enough.

Everyone loved this dessert, and especially, the whiskey sauce. One of the best Thanksgiving desserts I have ever tasted! Next time I will make it in a deep-dish pie plate instead of a springform pan. The two fillings combined are only about 1 1/2 inches high. The 8" springform pan was too deep and the excess crust collapsed down on top of the dessert. If using a springform pan, place the dough up the sides only about half way instead of all the way up the sides.

This is wonderful! I've made it twice and it's gotten rave reviews both times. I doubled the pumpkin portion both times. The second time I made it I cut the pecan syrup in half and added to that 1 cup of pecans. We thought it cut down on an unnecessary amount of sugar. I haven't made the sauce either time. Just served it with fresh whipped cream.

Sweet heavens, this dessert made me weep for joy. I used fresh pureed pumpkin pulp, which I highly recommend if you happen to be manic/bored/obsessed with not wasting your jack-o-lantern innards.

I am in the tiny minority of folks who did not care for this recipe. I cooked it about 20 minutes longer than called for it, but otherwise followed the recipe. I took it out of the oven because the pecans were starting to scorch. I thought the pumpkin filling just wasn't creamy enough (it didn't seem like a silky pumpkin pie), and I didn't like the contrast of the pumpkin and the sticky pecan layer. I also didn't care for the whisky butter sauce; it seemed a bit thin, and the whisky taste was completely overwhelming. Just my two cents...

Another prize winner! I baked this for our company pumpkin baking contest this year and won. I don't have a food processor so I had to make the crumbs with a metal mallet, which was difficult but I got my frustrations out! This recipe wowed the judges. I'm going to make this again and again.

this is a fairly simply to make recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. The only thing I did leave out the second time around was the whiskey sauce which I found to be too overwhelming. Got tons of compliments and requests for it every so often.

This desert is incredible! It takes a little while to make but believe me it is worth it. I had yelling over the last slice and actually caught two of my friends licking their deserts plates clean! Yes, it's that good!

The pie itself is great...but add the whiskey sauce, and it's fantastic! I could bathe in this sauce! Put it on ice cream, chocolate cake, cardboard....doesn't matter, it's so good.

I did this with the recommended extra pumpkin and I changed whiskey to brandy (don't like whiskey). This was a HUGE hit, eclipsing a Richard Sax pumpkin pie and grandma's blueberry cheesecake. The winner of the night. Make sure to put something under it or it will drip all over your oven. Oh, and the cajun name for this is "Hypocrite Pie".

I'm from Texas but we live in New England. This was an excellent combination of both regional tastes! I changed the recipe just a bit because I do not like the taste of dark karo syrup, which is too molassesy for me. So instead of 3/4c of dark corn syrup and 3/4c white sugar, I used 3/4c of dark brown sugar and 3/4c light corn syrup. It really will make a difference if you don't like the aftertaste of molasses. I suggest making sure your pan is *very* well greased. I tried just Pam and it didn't work very well as this pie has to cook for 105 minutes and the dough will stick to the pan if not greased well. I didn't make the whiskey sauce until I was ready to serve the pie. I used the liquer (dessert version of the bouron whiskey) which had more sugar and slightly less alcohol making this sauce well balenced. I served this to 6 people and all loved it!

Sticky sweet. The pecan syrup overwhelms the pumpkin. It was fine but we wouldn't make it again. Sorry.

This is the second year I have made this dessert. I usually use extra cinnamon and nutmeg, for a holiday flavor. The extra pumpkin is a must, I usually use real pumpkin roasted in the oven, call me extreme. I serve this in my restaurant and it has become a much asked for item.

Read all the rave reviews, and was disappointed. Although I like pumpkin pies in general, this filling just did not taste great to me or my hubby (who'll eat anything). The pie did look beautiful though. I followed a suggestion from other reviewers and doubled on the pumpking filling, and as might be expected, it did not bake through in 1hr 45min. I kept it in the oven another 40 min or so testing it every 10 min, but the knife never came out clean. Finally I took it out of the oven because the top started to overcook. Anybody else had this problem?

This pie is delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but next time I'll add more pumpkin filling as suggested (the pie is a little thin). It was so good. I had no problems with my springform, but I baked it on a cookie sheet to avoid oven mess. You can also wrap the bottom of the pan with foil to prevent leaks.

Just was not my taste. Followed recipe exactly as written. I think you'd get better results if used a baking stone or placed on floor of the oven. Glad I tested it before Thanksgiving...

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was incredible! It looks SO impressive too. I used my own pie crust recipe and followed other reviewers suggestions to double the pie filling. I also had to cook it much longer than the recipe states. I skipped the whiskey sauce and just stuck with whipped cream. My guests were REALLY impressed and it will absolutely be a new tradition!!!

I found this dessert to be very satisfying. It looked nice and tasted great. I would add more spices next time. I used my own pie crust recipe and it was fine. It would be nice made into tarts.

Rating: 4
This is very good and relatively foolproof, a nice blend of pumpkin and pecan flavors. I used canned pumpkin puree, made a butter crust from scratch and used a regular 9 inch pie pan. The pie didn't suffer at all, but would have looked nicer if I had a springform. I also made the sauce - it's good for presentation - very rich. I think another reader's use of whipped cream is better, but think that it isn't really necessary.

OH MY GOSH this is wonderful!! Because of time constraints, I didn't make the whiskey sauce and used whipped cream instead. Absolutely delicious. I used canned pumpkin and wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

For Thanksgiving this year, I made three desserts. This one was the hands-down favorite. As a matter of fact, I was told I MUST make it again for Christmas! The only thing I changed was the short cut of using a premade pie crust. It worked great.

yes...you can use 1 cup of canned pumpkin puree in the recipe...and any recipe that calls for it more often than not.

Did anyone who made this use canned pumpkin instead of the puree? I've never made puree and the recipes I've seen sound pretty difficult. Help!

Easy to make, fun to bake, great aroma and a taste to die for. Giving it away as Christmas gifts this year. I bought the refrigerated dough instead and that made it a breeze to make.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner in a pie dish instead. What a delicious combination for the best two holiday pies! I used a little more pumpkin batter since other reviews commented on the stronger pecan flavor. Next time, I will use less whisky than called for in the recipe, it was a little too strong for my taste. As for the pie, everyone loved it and kept commenting on it the following week!

Rating: 4
incredible! i like the flavor of pumpkin pie but i'm not crazy about it's soft consistency. this recipe has solved that problem completely. you still get the taste of pumpkin with the added consistency of caramelized pecans on top. everyone raved about it and have requests to make it again. and the best part was that it wasn't too hard to make at all. the only thing i would skip next time is the butter whiskey sauce. i found it to be too strong (too much whiskey) and the pie itself is perfect and doesn't needed anything added to it.

Wonderfully delicious! Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I also used a pie pan and am glad I spared myself the extra work and potential leakage of a springform pan. The baking time of 1 hour & 45 minutes was way too long for my pie; mine was done after 1 hour & 10 minutes. Didn't make the Whiskey Butter Sauce because the dessert was great on its own, but perhaps I'll try that another time for an even MORE indulgent treat! This is a keeper.

I cheated. I used a ready made pie crust. AND THIS RECIPE STILL ROCKED!!! It was ridiculously easy, looked perfect and my guests raved. It's a keeper.

I made this pie last year for a real American thanksgiving dinner with our expat friends here in the Netherlands. It was a huge hit and I've been asked to make it again! I thought it would be more difficult but it wasn't---the whiskey butter sauce was fabulous and the springform pan made it beautiful to look at.

Rating: 3
Like another reviewer, I used a 9-inch springform and increased the pumpkin slightly. I also substituted light maple syrup for the corn syrup, which gave a great and earthy, deep flavor. My taste-testers (coworkers) raved about the taste and presentation of the pie. HOWEVER... BE WARNED: this pie is HUGELY messy if using a springform that has absolutely any room for leaks! And that crust of burnt syrup on the oven floor may be the one and only thing that would make another pie more worthy of the time and effort...

This was ok. Very heavy taste.

To the cook from Chicago: I made mine in a pyrex pie plate. It tasted fantastic, but it didn't look too pretty! But it can be done, just beware. I had to check it while baking fairly often too. I made it last Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from all the family and I'm going to make it again this year!

This recipe was extremely easy to make and turned out delicious. You must use the whiskey butter sauce to really make this dish shine. I used a 9 inch springform pan and doubled the pumpkin filling recipe and it was almost to thick.

Rating: 3
This was yummy good and enjoyed by all. I took the advice of other cooks and doubled the pumpkin recipe. I didn't have an 8-inch springform so I used a 9-inch and the crust was submerged beneath the pecan topping. This was fine since the pie held it's shape due to the springform. Also, I overbaked it because my knife did not come out clean, and ended up carmelizing (burning) some of the pecan topping around the edges. This did not seem to matter to the consumers, though (lots of oohs and aahs). It still was delicious (but it did look burnt). For next time, I'll increase the amount of pecans, maybe to one cup and watch the edges for burning. Also, I thought the whiskey in the sauce was slightly overpowering. I'll reduce the amount for next time. Or, maybe I'll try it with slightly sweetened whipped cream spiked with whiskey. Tip: if you roll out the crust between plastic wrap or parchment, you'll have an easier time getting it in the pan.

Rating: 0
I am not giving this a numerical fork rating because I only used the recipe for the pumpkin filling. I baked it in mini-pumpkin shells. Compared to other pumpkin pie recipes, this one was much thicker. As the recipe indicated, it had to be spooned, not poured. It was fine warm, but yummier and sweeter chilled.

Rating: 4
Wonderful fall dessert! I made it in a 10" springform but didn't increase the recipe, probably should have as it was a little thin. I also used my own pie crust recipe. Very yummy!

Wow! Great pie, and guests were calling the day after my dinner party to get the recipe. I sent pieces home with guests as well. TIP: The crust can get overly dark on the edges from such long baking. Either wrap it with foil at the halfway point, or consider covering the whole thing with foil. Terrific. I also agree with the cook who said to make more than the recipe calls for. I doubled it, and used the leftover for tarts.

Rating: 4
Sublime! Wonderful combination of tastes and texture. Served it for Thanksgiving and it has become a family favorite already! I did not use the crust suggested in the recipe but made a double crust from the Crisco box instead (as I find "butter" crusts often turn out tough). It was excellent!

This recipe was good but I ended up adding more spices to the pumpkin filling. I also used cognac for a slightly different flavou with the sauce.

I'd never made a pumpkin or pecan pie before & this recipe was a breeze. I doubled the pumpkin filling and used a 9" springform pan. Surprisingly, even with the doubled filling, the pie didn't need to cook any longer. It was delicious and beautiful. I also made lots of ingredient substitutions (Earth Balance for Butter, etc.) and they were all fine. This recipe is fail safe.

Rating: 4
Well, I just made this yesterday and thought I wouldn't taste this until later but I borrowed a pop out rubber pan from a friend. It was very difficult to use - I agree that a pie plate may have been better if you don't have a spring-form. Anyway - very delicious, so I think the taste will make up for my presentation! It really didn't take that long to make and it (would) look gorgeous - it tastes is amazing! Whisky sauce a must - try Canadian Club rather than bourban :-) Happy Thanksgiving to all those Canadian Chefs!

This was a great hit for Christmas dessert after a venison roast. Will definitely make it again. The pumpkin kept the pie from being overly sweet as some pecan pies tend to be. Thought the pecan topping might also be good over brie.

This was very nice. I wouldn't change a thing. My relatives really enjoyed the pie and raved about the sauce. In Paul Prudhomme's cookbook, this pie is made with sweet potatoes and baked in an 8" cake pan. Since my springform was loaned out, the cake pan worked fine.

This is so good. We made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My springform pan had a leak and some of the pecan filling oozed into the bottom of the oven - quite a mess! But the end result was still attractive and delicious.

Absolutely one of the best pies I've made -- didn't find the crust all that easy to work with, but any short crust would do. I liked an earlier reader's idea of doubling the pumpkin filling. Everyone at our thanksgiving table loved this pie!

This pie made me a STAR at a fancy Thanksgiving dinner party this week! The recipe was easy enough for a novice cook like me. I even placed a little circle of shelled pecans in the center of the pie and poured a little bit of the sauce over it to glaze the top. I would say though, that pecans dominate the taste over pumpkin - next time I may increase the pumpkin ingredient a little bit.

Wonderful different pie recipe. I received many rave reviews on Thanksgiving. Don't leave out the Whiskey Butter Sauce, it's easy and so tasty! I had to cook the pie an extra 30 minutes beyond the 1hr. 45min. and I may double the pumpkin filing next time for more pumpkin taste.

This pie was excellent! I will be making it again...and again...and again. The whiskey butter sauce was delicious. I can't wait to try it on other desserts. The only questionable part of this recipe was the pie crust. If you have a recipe you like, use it instead.

a fabulous desert! the perfect one for the holidays - and very easy - i loved it and so did everyone! the only change i made was we didn't have bourbon so i used scotch in the cream sauce - all agreed that it was perfect with that instead of bourbon (not so sweet) - also, i used a 9" springform pan instead of 8" (i didn't have it with me) and it turned out perfect. this is now a mainstay for the holiday season!

Rating: 3
This was great. I'll make it again. It did need to bake a good 25-30 minutes longer than the 1 hour 45 listed in the recipe. I went ahead and took it out of the oven then, even though a knife still didn't come out clean. It was fine. The pumkin layer was soft set - not like a custard in a traditional pumkin pie. The crust was OK. If you have favortie crust recipe use that instead.

Rating: 3
This rocked. My springform pan was being used for something else, so I pressed the dough into a well-greased deep-dish pie plate. The slices came out with no difficulty, and the flavor was incredible. (I didn't use the butter sauce, and suspect it might actually make it *too* rich.) My husband, who doesn't like pecan pie, asked for seconds on this. Fantastic recipe.

Wow! This is by far the best pie that I've ever made! Hot damn, this dessert is good. I made it this Thanksgiving for the first time, and I'm now going to make it my signature dish. Two important tips: 1. Do yourself a favor. Make this pie with sweet potatoes (Which is how Paul Prudhomme makes it). Pumpkin doesn't have the natural sweetness and softer consistency that sweet potato does. 2. Don't eliminate the whiskey butter sauce. It's too easy to make, and although you don't need it, it's a nice touch and the flavor is incredible. Let your guests serve it on the side if they want to try it. Yum Yum Yum. This recipe is a winner. 3. Make the crust- don't do store bought. Again, the recipe is too easy for you not to follow through and make it yourself. I dig store bought refrigerator roll-out dough at times, but this deserves a wonderfully easy flaky crust. Also, you definitely don't need a spring board pan. A normal pie pan is fine. Make This Pie!

Rating: 3
The crust came out kind of tough, and I agree with the others, it needed more cooking, but it was a pretty tasty pie. You couldn't really taste the pumpkin - it tasted more like pecan pie than pumpkin. Also, the recipe is confusing because I didn't know where to trim the pie crust inside the springform pan. The dough was suprisingly easy to work with for a dough without shortening.

I followed the recipe religiously without the sauce however. It was easy and very tasty...

I made this yesterday and it is wonderful! I used a pre-made pie crust as I am a novice cook (did not trust my skill in pie crusts yet)and the crust was too thin. Still, it is going fast. I will definitely make this for Thanksgiving dinner- this time with the thicker crust the recipe indicates.

OH, WOW! Incredible!!! I wanted to do all kinds of baking for Thanksgiving, but with only a party of 4, had to limit it--didn't want too much good stuff left in the house! This was a wonderful way to combine two of my favorites, and the whiskey butter sauce was just AWESOME. I can't say enough about this pie. I am trying to figure out an excuse to make it again before the next holiday!!

Incredible. Orgasmic. It came out perfectly, and I've never made a pie before. (Well, tried once and that one was a disaster.) The sauce was incredible. The pie is so good heated up with the sauce seeping down through the pie, I can't even tell you. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. I used fresh pumpkin, which was great. I made the crust too but was confused about folding it in quarters.... kind of winged that part.... MAKE THIS PIE.

And I thought the whiskey butter sauce was a delicious complement to the pie.

This pie was a great hit. My boyfriend ate it right out of the pan for breakfast! But then he'd eat anything that wasn't nailed down!! I liked it because of the pecan contrast with the pumpkin -- very good. The Whiskey Butter Sauce wasn't very good, therefore I just omitted from the pie altoghether. If I choose to serve it to guests I would top with whipped cream.
