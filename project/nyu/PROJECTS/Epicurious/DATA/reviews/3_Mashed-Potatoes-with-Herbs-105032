Lacks flavor, very bland tasting. Potatoes became green in color, which was a little odd but humureous for guests. Definetly had to add addtional sea salt and garlic.

Definitely a keeper! Instead of adding all 2 cups of milk, I added 1 cup and 1/2 cup of skim evaporated milk and lots of crushed garlic. So creamy and simply delicious!

While I'm sure the best type of potato to mash could be disputed forever, I found this to be a great basic mashed potato recipe. For someone who'd never made mashed potatoes before (like myself), this recipe is the perfect starting point.

Yukon Gold are absolutely the best mashing potato. They have a better consistancy and a natural sweetness which lends itself to mashed potatoes. This was an excellent recipe.

Just a suggestion...I adjusted this recipe to my own tastes and used red potatoes (with the skins on) and enough fresh parsley and chives to give the dish some color. I was pleased with the results.

i agree with the cook from new york, these were not good potatoes to mash.

This is a pretty basic recipe--but I don't think Yukon Golds are a good mashing potato. Idahoes are the way to go. And you could be a lot more adventurous with the herbs.

These were the best mashed potatoes!!! They were easy to make and my in-laws loved them!
