I followed this recipe exactly but wasn't too pleased with the turnout. First, there were way too many onions. Second, 12 minutes was too long to saute the fisth to start with. Third, 200 degrees wasn't hot enough to cook the tomatoes without terribly over cooking the fish. It never turned into a "sauce". And as other reviewers said, biting directly into a whole clove was a bit overpowering. I'd use powder next time, though I won't be making this recipe again.

Great tasting and easy to make recipe - plates well with the contrasting tomatoes. Next time I will put tooth picks where the cloves are inserted. If you bite one of them, you have the taste for the rest of the meal.

Great recipe, have made it twice, however, I have small issue with the cost of high grade tuna, and the fact that it needs to be cooked well (we enjoy it rare). So, we made a small change and used the recipe with pork tenderloin. We used the same ingredients and same cooking method, although we set our oven at 250 degrees. Cooked the pork to 155 degrees. The dish came out great! The pork was moist and flavorfull. We made it with the lemon risotto that is also in this issue. Home brined olive salad, and a nice red wine rounded out the meal. A great evening for all!

This was GREAT and so easy! The only thing I'll do different next time is add maybe 1/8 or 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves and ground coriander along with the oregano. I didn't like it when I didn't see a clove or coriander seed and bit right into it. I'll still put slivers of garlic in the tuna fillet though. I don't mind biting into garlic! I also cooked some new potatos in the microwave until they were nearly done and then threw them in the pan with the tuna when it went into the oven. The potatos soaked in some of the flavors from the tuna recipe and it made the dish into a complete meal.

I really loved the flavors of this but only gave it 3 forks because I struggled a little bit with the cooking temperature and length. Given the apparent confusion over temp & duration from previous reviewers, I used a digital thermometer to be safe. I took it out well before the suggested 145 degrees (around 110) because it felt rather firm and it was cooked through and still just a bit pink in the center (which my dinner guests really liked). I found it a little hard to slice without it falling apart. I considered slicing it before roasting and think I'll do that next time. The flavors were really wonderful and I paired it with the Lemon Risotto elsewhere on this site which went wondefully with it.

This is by far the best fresh tuna recipe I've ever made. The fish came out moist & flavorful even though I cooked it well beyond medium-rare (my husband won't eat it if it's red). I also increased the oven temp to about 350 because nothing seemed to be happening at 200. It was still great!

Friends loved it! Husband loves it! Its my favorite way to eat tuna!! Out of the oven - next day - warm, as a main dish - or leftovers (or a plain ol' midnight snack) - you simply gotta love this delicious dish!

Very tasty with the whole cloves. I had 3cm thick slices and baked them for the 12 minutes indicated, excellent, well done and not dry(because of the vinegar?). Very easy recipe!

I fixed this for a group several of whom were "fish haters" - they loved it! I also wondered about the temp and cooking time - I converted the oven temp from Centigrade to Fahrenheit and it was much closer to the right time. I did cook it a bit longer - wonderful.

A delicious recipe and very very simple. Make sure you use the best grade tuna you can find, sashimi grade is best, you know, the filet that looks like its glowing from within? I do question the temperature of the oven and or the cooking time. I've made this dish three times and the cooking time is never long enough. Usually I lik my tune seared and red inside, but with this recipe it is nessicary to cook it well. I usually average about 25 minutes in the convection over at 250 degrees. You want the inside to almost flake, with a hint of pink, not to be blood red. I like this with roasted potatoes and either a fume blanc or a chablis.
