I have been making this dish for Thanksgiving every year since the recipe was published in Gourmet. It is one of my family's favorites. This year I am lamenting the tragedy of Conde Nast no longer publishing Gourmet! No cooking magazine comes close!

This was a good dish; it takes a bit of time to get the to reduce but it's very good when it does. Great addition to the Thanksgiving menu.

Brought this to Thanksgiving this year and it was very well received. I love onions and balsamic vinegar - what more can you ask for? The glaze didn't stick to the onions all that well, though. I may have use a teensy bit too much oil.

We enjoyed this recipe along with a baked ham. It was an interesting variation for pearl onions.

Everyone loved this. Simple to prepare. Just takes time to get a beautiful surupy reduction. well worth it. Easier prep: cut cut off root ends before blanching- then after- use scissors to get under the top layer- snip bottom to top.

I TOOK THIS TO A LUNCHEON AT WORK AND EVERYONE LOVED IT

Turned out alright, but have to agree with another reviewer -- this recipe is only for those who can't get enough balsamic vinegar! I like balsamic vinegar quite a bit, and found the flavor overpowering. But if you're willing to use a full cup of very aged, high-quality vinegar, it will probably be fine. I added half a cup of dark brown sugar to take the edge off, and a few tablespoons of unsalted butter.

I made these onions three or four years ago from the recipe I had clipped out of Bon Appetit, well I lost it. With the help of the wonderful search engine on this site, I have found it again! These onions are awesome. My mother-in-law loved these when I made them, so I'm going to suprise her on Thanksgiving and make them for her. Thanks Epicurious!

This was a great side dish, not too rich and very flavorful. I served it with beef tenderloin and it was an excellent complement. Our guests called to ask the recipe.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving when I moved out on my own in 1994. My family and friends liked it so much that it's now a holiday tradition. Oddly, in the 8 years I've been using this recipe, I never thought to use frozen pearl onions. I'm going to try that tip this Thanksgiving.

I'm making this again tonight after the first success. Very good - but I would like to find frozen peeled pearl onions to make it easier.

Good dish - but only for fans of the pungent flavor of balsamic vinegar. I did myself a favor and used frozen pearl onions to make this dish less labor-intensive.

Easy and good! A new twist on the old creamed onions we all grew up not eating.

In addition, just before serving, whisk in a couple of tablespoons softened butter

EXCELLENT - and I don't even like balsamic vinegar. The pearl onions are a bit of a chore to skin - not too bad though. Made with Beef Wellington - awesome dinner.

Have now made this several times and have found that it adds an excellent kick to a meal. I've found that the best way to "peel" the onions is to slice off the root end and squeeze the onion out. A key to this is using good balsamic vinegar.

Delicious Thanksgiving side dish. Flavorful, but not too rich.

These onions are absolutely wonderful. The recipe is easily altered to make less.

I thought this was slightly too tart, but it got raves on Mother's Day.

A welcome change from my mother-in-law's creamed onions! Made a big hit at the this year's Thanksgiving table.
