To make a smaller cake, I baked it in regular 1" high pans and had enough dough leftover to make a dozen cupcakes. As others mentioned, the cake was crumbly, but it was manageable to build the layers. I had no leftover ganache, but if you do, I'm sure it would be very good on crepes with ice cream and bananas.

Wow! What a wonderful cake! Did find that the texture is crumbly - the filling is delicious. This cake definitely serves 16 - a very small slice is more than enough. Would be nice to have slivered almonds or raspberries in the filling as well. Next time I may freeze one layer of the cake, cut the remaining layer in half, halve the filling and ganache for a smaller dessert. All in all, received rave reviews from the family.

I loved this recipe, and even though it was quite a bit of work, I thought it was worth it. A couple of notes: do not overbake the cake. You can leave out the cocoa powder if you want a really moist cake, but this can make the cake difficult to move for assembly. The ganache recipe is fine if you follow the directions. Let it cool to the proper consistency for pouring, and be sure to use the springform pan. I was not a huge fan of the vanilla filling, so I used Italian Meringue Buttercream the next time and liked that much better. I used Himalayan Pink sea salt for finishing and it was perfect for the cake.

Everything went well except the ganache. It was so runny that I had to keep the whole cake frozen in order to use it. Upon doing some after-the-fact research, I discovered that the chocolate to cream ratio to be 50/50 or even 70/30. The Ding Dong cake recipe is 9oz chocolate and 12oz cream.

This is sacrilege I know, but the cake part came out dry, so I would use box cake for that part next time. The caramel ganache was awesome, and I used the leftovers on ice cream. You could also just eat it with a spoon!! :)

Made this just as called for and it turned out great. I undercooked just slightly to keep nice and moist. Stenciled the salt on in the shape of a '50' for my brothers 50th birthday and it was a huge hit for old and young alike. My 9 year old daughter wants for her 10th next year..

Hi, made the cake. Followed the directions and everything worked out well. Flavors are great! The cake however was too "crumbly" for my liking. How do I prevent that?

This is a lot of work but well worth it. The batter barely fit in my 9" cake pans, make sure they really have 2" sides or prepare to do some trimming from the overflow. The ganache is incredible; it would be amazing on its own just poured over some vanilla ice cream. The finished product looks great and would definitely feed more than 12.

Great cake.I made it with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free all purpose flour. The filling and ganache were excellent. I was not, however, a big fan of the added salt. This was a big hit for a football party.

This cake was delicious and saved by the ganache which was outstanding. It was time consuming and I had some big issues but it was a hit even despite those. One of my cake layers broke but since you put it in the springform pan, I was able to rescue it. Covered in ganache, no one noticed my broken caken. One warning - my filling completely flopped because I didn't let the gelatin mixture cool before putting in the whipped cream. I should've known better but it was 10:30PM the night before my son's birthday and the recipe didn't SAY to let it cool (just set aside.) So my cream turned into sweet butter and it was terrible. However, it still tasted good, I used it anyway, expecting to have to throw out the cake in the morning but it turned out OK. The filling wasn't thick and creamy like expected but it still tasted good.

Amazingly delicious and actually pretty reasonable to make. I made the cakes and ganache one night and the next day upon assembly made the cream. Made for a dinnner party and recieved all sorts of oohs and ahs. Ganache is easy and looks perfect. Our girls are begging for me to make again this week but I'm going to try the next recipe in this months mag...mint chip cake!

Double OMG. I can't say enough about this cake. So moist and chocolately. My only regret was not sprinkling more salt on top. I only had 8 inch cake pans. Not a problem - just had to bake the cakes for about 9 additional minutes.

Wow. Incredible cake. Very rich, but love the salty sweet taste of the chocolate caramel. Followed the recipe exactly as written and had no problems at all with any part of this. The family loved it and its already been requested again.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the ganache and the cream filling were a nightmare to make. I had to do the ganache twice, and even then I had to use 1/2 the heavy cream otherwise it would've been way too runny. And the cream filling never formed into peaks for me, even after adding more powdered sugar and gelatin. The cake itself tastes perfect, and I would use that recipe again in a heartbeat. Next time I'll save myself the time and just use marshmallow cream for the filling, though.

OMG - does not even begin to describe this cake. My husband made this and we had it for dessert last night. It is beyond delicious. It's a nice size and is very heavy. The flavors blend so well and you will want more than one piece.

Served this last night and it got rave reviews. It does remind me of the Hostess Ding Dongs I loved as a kid. Would probably serve 16 easily. My cake layer was thinner than shown due to my mistake using the wrong size cake pans and losing much of it to the oven floor. But as I love the filling the ratio was good. So if you don't have the correct pans make in 3 or 4 pans and freeze the extra cake for later use or frost with another favorite icing.

While I haven't tasted the cake yet, it looks yummy. But a word to the wise ( which I wasn't last night) heed the special equipment memo. You definitely need to use the 9 inch pan with 2 inch high sides or it will overflow all over the bottom of your oven, start to smoke set off you smoke alarms. So consider yourselves warned. Will report back tomorrow as to the taste.
