Absolutely wonderful recipe. I don't always include the pears, but follow the rest pretty closely. Watch the heat with the peppers, too, if you have guests sensitive to spicy foods. The fruit added to the guacamole is unexpected and complements the guacamole perfectly!

We love this recipe & make it every year during the holidays. We also love the Mango-Pomegranate Guac recipe equally well (except we leave out the cilantro since we don't like it). I make whichever recipe I can get the best fruit for. It is definitely worth the effort of seeding pomegranates if you can't buy them already seeded.

This is definitely a keeper! It's an unusual pairing... people talk about this recipe because it's unforgettable! Holiday pleaser for the foodies in your life!

Have had this and it was wonderful. You can get pomegranate seeds at Trader Joes out of season.

This is a 100% must-have at my annual Christmas party. People request it in their RSVP's. It has a lovely red and green presentation. I have the original magazine and last year I had to get it out so that people could take pictures of the recipe with their iPhones. I use one fresh jalepeno pepper (because I can't find serrano in Calgary) and you should know that using WHITE onion is very important!

This is the recipe to make when pomegranates are in season! Recipes like this you'll make forever. When you see poms you'll think Christmas Guacamole!!!

Delicious flavor. Make sure the pear is nice and ripe. Beautiful presentation at the holidays.

I have 3 pomegranate trees and find I can freeze the seeds for use when out of season. The pomegranate seeds are easily taken out if done in a bowl under water: the seeds sink and the peel floats.

A friend of mine served this recipe at a Christmas party and it was delicious! I had seen this recipe earlier and wanted to make it myself but pomegranates were not in season at the time. This was truly fabulous and I look forward to making it myself soon.

Everyone really liked this, but like several other reviewers mentioned, I would reduce the number of serranos to 1 or 2, especially if you're having a lot of guests over. I've made it several times and when I made it with 4 serranos, they were a bit overwhelming. Using 1 or 2 serranos instead helps the other flavors come through. Also like other reviewers mentioned, it can be a lot of work to put together (not difficult but time consuming) so I too would recommend this only for special occasions. I would also suggest adding a tiny bit of sour cream to help with the texture.

oh my! thanks to maggie mason at mightygirl.com i tried this recipe, one that i normally would have passed by thinking, 'oh no, not going to waste all those ingredients just to find out that traditional guacamole is better.' well, thank goodness for mightygirl, because this is one AMAZING guac!

My friends love this guacamole so much that they now demand that I bring it to parties. Prepping out all of the ingredients is a bit fiddly, but the taste combination is worth it. And it's gratifying to see it disappear within minutes of being served!

This is the BEST guacamole around, and the only drawback is that it is so hard to get pomegranate seeds for much of the year. This is a people pleaser every time, and I have brought it to many parties and been asked for the recipe. I found 4 serrano chiles too hot, and it was delicious with 2. I also often make it without the grapes, and find it is delicious with just the pear and pomegranate seeds.

Unfortunately, pomegranates are out of season, but still GREAT without it! Really great texture and awesome combination of flavors. Plus super easy to make! I served it with baked pita chips at my sister's birthday party - everyone LOVED it!

simply delish-- knocked socks off my delighted guests. Didn't have grapes but fine without it. I served it as a first course on a bed of greens and tortilla chips on the side. We're still licking our chops.

Perfect. Delicious. You can puree the onions, chile, lime and salt beforehand, and prep the fruit.

I wish that that the site would allow me to give this 3 1/2 forks. The guacamole turned out pretty tasty. Because it was a lot of effort to gather all the ingredients, I would save this guacamole for special occasions like xmas. It is a little too much effort for just a munching-in- front-of-the-tv, chip-dip scenario. I halved the recipe. There were no Serrano chiles available so I used "long chili" peppers (that's how they were labeled). I used medium red grapes and ripe anjou pears, as well as pomegranates. I paired it w/ white corn tortilla chips. Also, if I were to make this again, I would try to find saltier tortilla chips -- that would "stand up" better to the strong flavors of the dip. I think that more saltiness would make this guac more savory (my guac turned out mainly sweet, although it had a good kick from the spiciness of the pepper and the slightest bit of tartness from the pomegranate seeds). Also, if I were using medium- sized grapes again, I would cut them in quarters or smaller. Don't be turned off by the comment about this dip having gross flavors. The flavors were actually complementary and balanced.

I've made this recipe many, many times and it is ALWAYS a huge hit. We prefer it without pomegranate seeds! Red or Black grapes are prettiest. Can be strong on the onion- so either have an extra avocado to mix in, or try it with less if you aren't a big onion fan. Enjoy!

Just does not work. Made it for superbowl party and I think in general stick with the basics when it comes to guac. The original recipes are still the best. This was just not the right mix of flavors for a chip and dip.

the best guacamole i've ever eaten. made it for a dinner party of 14 and people were raving. didn't have any pomegranate so i substituted 3 passionfruit (in a double recipe) which tasted fantastic but probably cost something in presentation. charred 1/2 the serranos and put the others in raw.

I made this guacamole for a New Year's party, and it was quite a hit. Now I will be forced to make 2 different dips for special occassions. I did roast the chiles before adding them to the dip and I used 2 cloves of garlic (one can never go wrong with garlic).

I made the guacamole this weekend for my family to taste before I made it for a group of 12 later this month. Got rave reviews - even from 2 people who don't like guacamole. It was all gone! Everyone loved the ingredients. It is a little spicy but the frapes, pear, & pomegranate seeds balance it well.

I'm so excited to find this recipe. Years ago, a friend from Mexico City served us guacamole with pomegranate. She made the guacamole very hot and the contrast with the sweet, tart, juicy pomegranates was incrediable. She said where she is from it is a Christmas tradition. It's been over 10 years and I've never gotten the taste of it out of my mind. I came here looking for a guacamole recipe and was over joyed to see this one. For those who praised the recipe but didn't or couldn't include the pomegranate, the next time you see a pomegranate in the store, grab it and make this recipe again!

I love this guacamole, and I agree that the pomegranate seeds are the best part, but during summer when pomegranates are nowhere to be found but it's perfect guacamole weather, I replace the pear with peach and the pomegranate seeds with raspberries that I pull apart. It's really good this way too!

Absolutely fabulous! I've been using the Epicurious site for three years now. Lots of good recipes. This is the first time I'm rating one because it is just so exceptional. Yum!

Yum! What a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet and salty (chips!). My disbelieving boyfriend said, "Grapes? In guacamole?" Needless to say, this appetizer was demolished! Will definitely make it again. Used lemon juice, even though the recipe calls for lime in the ingredients list but lemon in the actual recipe text. Lemon made more sense.

This is just fabulous. It's easy and different and delicious. I, also, have misplaced my copy of Gourmet (recent move, nothing's where it should be), and am so glad I thought to look for it here as I do not want to be without it during Pomegranate season!

This was excellent. I loved the flavor from the fruit. I might increase the spiciness level next time, but I still rate it four forks. The colors also make it a great holiday dish.

I am so grateful for my friend who gave me my first pomegranate. I had no idea what to do with it until I came to Epicurious, and though I didn't have a couple ingredients, I went ahead and made a small batch (with just a little bell pepper instead of the hot peppers). What a find! The gorgeous red and green contrast will be great for a holiday appetizer, but the other contrasts were treats too: sweet and salty, creamy and crunchy!

This was a real hit at my husband's birthday buffet. I plan to make it again tonight (much smaller portion -- it makes a lot!). I really liked the fruit combination with the avocado but plan to try other spices like curry and cumin.

I just searched for this recipe since I seemed to have lost the issue of Gourmet it first came out in in December. I searched for it because I couldn't bear the thought of either not eating this again or of forgetting about it. Several months later, I still crave it. To to the cook who made it without the pomegranate seeds: they're the best part! The only problem is that pomegranates only seem to be available October-December. This guacamole is incredible.

Hands down, this is the best guacamole I have ever had. Every other one pales in comparison. I too was leary of making this, but the contrast of flavors sounded intriguing, and I could not pass up at least trying this. I am so glad I did! Everyone that has tried this has agreed it is a terrific guacamole. One confession: I can't get pomegranites where I live, so I had to leave them out.

When I first saw this recipe, I was intrigued, yet a little leary. I had never tried guac like this before. However, I made the guac for a small gathering, and everyone raved about it. I served it with tortilla chips. One guest pulled out some crackers and baguettes to eat it on.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and guess that that's not a picture of the guac.
