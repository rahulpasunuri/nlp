Instead of a baguette, I put it on tasting spoons. Cut the cucumber slices in half so they fit into the spoons creating a next for everything else. Mmmm.

I had wasabi powder on hand, no wasabi paste. Big mistake. Had to throw out the cream cheese with wasabi. Used plain cream cheese, and not bad, but next time will insure that I have a tube of wasabi paste in the pantry. I will make again.

This recipe has become a standard of mine due to ease of prep and great taste. A nice variation on traditional Smoked Salmon with cream cheese.

I made these as directed and was underwhelmed--not much flavor (even with the wasabi). It seemed to be a waste of good smoked salmon!! There are better smoked salmon recipes out there!

This was easy, fast and delicious. Perfect mix of sushi and bagel! It wasn't too hot for me, but one guest thought it a bit spicy. Yumm.
