I used 1 cup mandarin juice along with the zest and instead of scallions, a shallot. Marinated for 2 hours. The flavor is absolutely unbelievable. Awesome!

I used this marinade (sans cilantro, chili paste and green onion) for a pork tenderloin marinade. Strained the marinade after the tenderloin started roasting; spooned some of the marinade over the pork to glaze it and then drizzled some of the pan juices with cooked marinade over the slices of pork tenderloin. VERY good! Would have been too spicy for me with the chipotle and chili paste, but it worked with just chipotle.

I've made this for tailgate parties and numerous barbecues. BIG HIT. I was actually remembered at a big function for the girl with the bbq'ed shrimp.Thanks Mario!!! (PS did come across 1 person that had an allergic reaction...maybe to the chili paste, not sure...he loved them, but his face got real big!)

The huge shrimp didn't look too good in the store today, so I used medium-large sized instead. And I sauteed them in olive oil rather than grilling them. They held the glaze and looked and tasted excellent. I agree with a couple commenters that the orange flavor wasn't very evident, however I liked it this way - it blended in and became an important part of the flavor profile and added a little sweetness. I'd take the commenters advice about grating some peel if you want to make it more orange-y. All in all, a great simple recipe that can be prepared well ahead of time in any situation - and pulled out at the last minute and quickly cooked.

Not much orange flavor, but has a nice kick and was a hit with the family. We doubled the recipe and it served six easily. Only change I made was adding another clove of garlic and about 1/2 cup more orange juice. Served it with basmati rice and a salad and no one walked away hungry.

Made the recipe as directed and it was great. The only change I will make next time would be to add the grated rind of the oranges I juiced. The orange was lost in the mix and I think it would have made it a 4 fork for me if it had been more prominent.

I took these to a tailgate and they were amazing. I made enough to serve for Mother's Day the next day and again everyone raved. I pre-printed the recipe and sure enough my sisters each took a copy as they went out the door.

I used 4 chipotles, sweetened asian red chili paste, whole bunch of cilantro, larger shrimp (8-10 count) - incredible

This is really good. I used a tart Scottish marmalade instead of orange juice; added a second chipotle pepper after tasting the marinade (I like heat); and used medium shrimp. Fabulous, and almost as good cold the next day.

Loved it. I also tried the marinade with chicken and it was great! How can a dish with chipotle chili and Asian red chili paste be bland?

This dish was incredibly bland. I'd try this again but I would skip marinating the shrimp and instead simmer the marinade (omitting the scallions, adding a bit of cornstarch and drastically decreasing the oil) to create a sauce to brush on the shrimp as they hit the grill. As it is, this dish is surprisingly bland.

Served as an appetizer for Father's Day BBQ - big hit with the family. I would probably use less cilantro next time, as it did overpower the other flavors. Would certainly make them again, very tasty.
