This was a delicious succotash. Like many, I tweaked it little. I added about 1 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for a little zing, added about 1 1/2 cup of baby spinach, and topped it off with crumbled feta cheese before serving, Superb!

from my childhood dislike for lima beans, i purchased fresh baby limas from a local farm stand. then i searched for a recipe as i didn't want to just boil them. To my surprise, this was the BEST recipe using farm fresh veggies of the summer.

Wow -- this is easy and super. I added a TBSP sherry vinegar, also 1/4 cup arugula and 1/4 cup basil at the end.

This is quite good. We live in a place that produces fabulous tomatoes and corn. I added a liberal amount of black pepper. Could also use other fresh herbs to add to the brightness and a dash of sugar--to bring out the tomatoey goodness. Looking forward to left overs!

Simply delicious. I mean, deliciously simple? I caramelized the onions somewhat and I used a pound of grape tomatoes. Even though I used frozen corn and lima beans (it's only late March), it still managed to taste like summertime.

This is great eaten fresh, not cooked. Boil the corn briefly then using a knife cut it off the cob. Used canned lima beans which were fine.I also added 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar to the oil and garlic. Fresh basil. Excellent!

I made this with this season's first sweet corn and tomatoes, a sweet white onion and last year's (frozen) lima beans, which I had to use up. Used local farm butter instead of olive oil. It was delish! It's all I had for dinner.

Made this with edamame beans and cilantro (no basil on hand) which was divine. Gave it a Mexican edge...but delicious. Next time basil, but fantastic either way, I'm sure!

I'm upgrading my rating - Succotash was even better the next day as a cold side dish.

Perfect!!! Simple, healthy, and richly flavorful. Here in Peru, we have fresh favas and large-grain corn all year round, which were exquisite in this recipe. I served this over garlicky white rice, and can't wait for leftovers! Will make again and again!

This was good - but not amazing. Maybe would be better with fresh veggies - To be fair, we used frozen corn and lima beans - but overall didn't have a ton of flavor. I'll try it again but try it with the suggested beans and will likely fresh mint.

One of the best sides I've come across yet on this site. You can't really go wrong with fresh tomatoes and fresh corn. The basil and the dash of salt are the icing on the cake. Tasted great as leftovers the next day too.

Quick, simple, savory, flavorful, healthy, inexpensive. I served it with couscous one night, and rice another time; it's also tasty as a cold salad. Fresh basil adds juts the right punch to the sweetcorn & buttery lima bean combination. This is definitely going into the regular rotation-- a great weeknight dish.

Very tasty. My toddlers loved it. I used butter instead of olive oil and I used frozen corn. I am sure that fresh corn takes this dish over the top.

I prepared this today for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a splash of wine vinegar and truffle oil at the end. I seeded the tomatoes and used edamame beans. It tastes delicious. I can't wait till tomorrow!

This was a huge hit at our house. I left out the onions but it still had tremendous flavor. I can't wait to make this again in the summer with produce from the garden!

This was very good and a great way to use up some late summer garden veggies. The basil is a must! My husband thought this recipe was a bit light on the beans, so fans of limas should add extra. I also doubled the garlic and added about a half tsp of chili flakes, as others suggested. Definitely seed your tomatoes! This went really well with the Yukon Gold and Fennel Puree recipe from this site!

Excellent. Made with garbanzos instead of the lima beans & added some chili flakes at the end. I also simmered for just under 20 minutes and the corn was left with a slight crunch. Delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Great late summer recipe when ingredients can be plucked straight from the garden. Rustic. Went well with Sauteed Trout with Pecans.

This was fantastic. However, I made a lot of changes. I did not have lima or soy beans, so i used black beans and chick peas. I also didn't have basil, and forgot to add the garlic. So i used dried basil and garlic powder. I added fresh red pepper. I also added a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Whatever is left of the recipe, i followed...but this was a great base recipe. I came out sweet (due to the corn) with a little kick (from the cayenne. I served it with brown rice and grilled chicken. De-lish!

This was outstanding! My husband gave it an A+! My children loved it. I took the advice about seeding the tomatoes. Very easy, and amazingly good. My husband packed it for his lunch today!

Delicious, fresh, healthy, and easy to make. I let mine simmer on low for much longer than suggested, while I finished other dishes, and it was fine. I like the previous suggestions about using soy beans instead of lima. Might consider carmalizing the onions too, but I wonder if that would overpower the more subtle, fresh taste of the other ingredients. At any rate, you can't go wrong with the recipe as is.

This is really good ... for some inexplainable reason my grocery didn't have lima beans so I substitued soy ... really good. Next time I'll try some of the other reviewers suggestions ... carmalized onions, bacon, green tomatoes.

I've made this twice; it is delicious. Second time I caramelized the onions, the way it is done in Indian cuisine, and it was even better; it really adds to the flavor of the dish, and, indeed, to any dish beginning with sauteed onion. The Indian method of caramelizing is a bit different, and much faster: Melt 3-4 Tblsp butter with a similar mount of olive oil. Coarsely chop a good sized onion. Increase the heat to high - as high as you can; add the onion and Kosher salt. Stir constantly to keep the onion from burning. Keep at it until the onion gets a very deep golden brown - 5 plus minutes. Remove the saute pan from the heat, add the corn, tomatoes, garlic, generous fresh pepper, salt, and lima beans, return to heat and simmer covered for 20 minutes. Thicken with more butter if you wish.

What a great variation on the classic standby, and such a showcase for fresh summer produce, right down to the basil. To the cook who found it too thin: it helps to seed the tomatoes. Just halve them across the equator and squeeze the seeds and "guts" out into the sink so all you have left is mostly meat. This is a simple step and it cuts way back on the liquid. Also, while I loved the dish when it was freshly made, I liked it even more the next day after the basil flavor had had time to develop. Might be best to prepare it as directed and then let it cool to room temp before serving, then re-heat. And be sure to test for salt and pepper just before serving.

Excellent dish! I took a cooking class at Sur La Table and this was one of the recipes that the chef used. The chef added a dash of sherry vinegar after the 20 minute simmer and then a dash of truffle oil. These finishes really made the dish fantastic.

The picture looks like a thicker dish, mine turned out pretty thin, and a little bland, but not bad overall.

A reminder that happiness is in the simple things. I love the fresh veggie taste and texture. The basil doubles the pleasure. This will be a regular on my lunch menu.

Adored this! Skipped basil (I didn't have any) and used edamame instead of the lima beans. It got rave reviews from our dinner guests.

lovely - used fresh cranberry beans - didn't have any basil left, but did have tarragon and flat-leaf parsley, and that worked out well, too.

This tasted even better the next day as leftovers!

So delicious and so easy. I gave the fresh beans a head start before adding them in order to keep everything crunchy. A spoonful of butter swirled in at the end really ups the ante if you're serving it very warm.
