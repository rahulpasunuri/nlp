Nice preparation . . . and we used the syrup remaining to make a delicious and spicy "Kir".

This was a nice finishing touch to a heavy dinner. All my company enjoyed it and it looked very pretty as well.

I'm a fairly experienced cook and I did not have success with this recipe. More precise instructions, such as temperatures on a candy thermometer, would have helped--I achieved a burnt sugar syrup which strongly smelled up the house. The pears were salvagable, once the syrup was discarded, in ice cream sundaes (topped with a lot of honey). The recipe seemed to have promise--but proceed with caution.

Absolutely delicious...very refreshing, especially after a big meal. Simple to make.
