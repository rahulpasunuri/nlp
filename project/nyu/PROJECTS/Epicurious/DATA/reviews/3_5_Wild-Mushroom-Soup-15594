I read the other reviews, and used red wine instead of white, added some rosemary, used all of the porcini liquid, and a whole potato. I left out the cream, and it turned out delicious and very flavorful (and under 200 calories per serving). Well worth the effort!

I had my writer's group over and everyone enjoyed the soup. One of the ladies is a cooking instructor, so I felt particularly satisfied that she enjoyed it. I thought the flavor was very full and the soup delicious, yet not overpowering so that you could taste the mushrooms. I used the porcini water and added a splash of white truffle oil at the end. Used a tad more butter than recipe called for and substituted scallions for the leek and half and half for the cream. Yum.

I included almost all of the ingredients and added little extras. My mushrooms of choice were porcini (as called for), shiitake (as recommended), and oyster. I excluded the carrot, mostly because I didn't have it and didn't want to buy a whole bag of them just for this recipe. I used all of the soaking liquid from the porcini, because discarding it seemed wrong. It adds richness to the soup, for sure. I also added about a Tbsp of chopped fresh sage. If you don't like thyme, don't use it... try subbing sage or oregano, something earthy to bring out the porcini flavor. If the soup is too bland for you, use beef stock. I like the chicken stock in this recipe though. Using either sherry wine or red table wine might also be good. Going to try that next time! I probably won't use as much thyme, or might try rosemary instead.

I followed the recipe except I substituted milk for cream. The flavor was bad. Tasted too much like carrots and thyme. I would not make this again.

I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and served it at a Bunco party. Had no leftovers and lots of calls for the recipe. I thought it was absolutely delicious and not bland at all. I think the porcini broth is key; and dont forget to fish out the bay leaves before pureeing...Oops

Am making this wonderful soup again for a dinner party this week. It is a real winner. To spice it up a bit I add a dash of cayenne pepper. I always double the recipe and freeze half to have on hand.

I can see where this soup has the potential to be very bland.... definitely requires salt and pepper. Ours turned out delicious though and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.

I loved the basic recipe, and tweaked it to give it a lot more flavor-- but that was so easy! I skipped the cream altogether, but added some red wine vinegar,soy sauce, and more than a dash of hot sauce. I pureed most of it, but left some chunks for texture. I also bought a package of mixed wild mushrooms that I sauteed separately and mixed in at the end. Gorgeous! And VERY tasty!

the recipe lacks taste. in order to save it, we used sherry instead of wine, added garlic, substituted vegetable broth for chicken, increased black pepper and slow-cooked it in a crock pot. even with the additional effort, it was only passable and not up to the standards of this magazine.

I agree with murrayseven in toronto. Made the soup from scratch with stock, wild chanterelles, and all fresh ingredients. The soup was very bland. Any suggestions as to how to improve the flavor appreciated. (Still have 1/2 a bushel of chanterelles!

Made this dish as a challenge--how could a recipe with all the wild mushrooms be given such a poor review? Try it with or without the puree step. We wanted to keep the various mushrooms for their wonderful, individual textures and flavors, so we only puree'd part of the soup to make it creamier. Either way, this is a winner. Fancy-restaurant soup doesn't even consistently get this good.

With no intention of hurting anyones feelings I have to say this recipe is a stinker. It really has nothing to offer. Don't make it ...please!!
