This will make a tasty pork sandwich but it's still not a true Cuban which is unfortunate, especially when the author's intro states that despite becoming a popular sandwich in the U.S., it's rarely prepared incorrectly - well it continues. I studied Cuban cooking from Cuban chefs whose mission is to teach authentic dishes and after living in FL for many years, their dishes did indeed match those of the Cuban communities there, that also wanted their native dishes prepared correctly. One big difference is the use of Cuban pork, not just any leftover roasted pork - HUGE difference. The bread & pickles used are also important but I won't give those secrets away. I'm sure this recipe will be quite tasty just the same, it's just not a true Cuban sandwich, at least to the Cuban communities I've had the pleasure getting to know but is similar to a basic Ybor Cuban sandwich which generally caters to tourists and adds several ridiculous toppings and cuts corners by using any pork, any cheese, any ham, etc., which is too bad - a real Cuban sandwich is truly unforgettable & habit-forming.

My little Cuban mom uses sweet cured ham. And get a sandwich press (flat) and butter the outside before pressing. Not a panini press, its a Cuban not Italian.

Wouldn't a panini press be a faster way to grill this sandwich as opposed to using a "brick". turning & grilling and grilling again after removing it from the foil.
