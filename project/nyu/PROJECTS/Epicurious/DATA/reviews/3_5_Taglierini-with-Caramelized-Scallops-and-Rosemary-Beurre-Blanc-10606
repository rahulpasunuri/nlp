Terrific! Only change was to add a tablespoon or two of dijon and had to use small Bay scallops as I couldn't get Sea scallops. Worked out well as I pan sauteed the scallops, then tossed the lot of it - sauce, scallops and pasta - with some reggiano parmigiano. Would definately repeat!

My boyfriend says my cooking sucks. We used this recipe and it turned out soooo well. I'm very impressed and so was my bf. Woo-hoo.

My husband said this was restaurant quality. We both loved it and I will make this again and again. I skipped the pasta and put the scallops right over the sauce.

Wonderfully delicious!

Love this recipe! Instead of straining the sauce I put it in the blender. Straining revoves too much flavor. Sometimes I have made it with half shrimp. Also, this recipe serves 4, not 6.

I'd really been looking forward to trying this, but I was disappointed. The beurre blanc was delicious. I strained the sauce, and agreed with many that this left scant amount for the pasta. Nevertheless, this dish was too rich for me. Also, despite the delicious flavor of the sauce on its own, I feel it was lost in the dish and that the whole thing ended up lacking flavor. I won't make again.

Thanks to other suggestions, and what I had on hand, I did the following. Super rich! Omitted garlic. Used lime juice instead of vinegar and Lemon Juice. Doubled sauce. Used Rosemary sprig which I removed before serving. Did not strain sauce. Crosshatched scallops.....worked fine. Finished with chopped dill. Yum.......butter, wine, cream! What's not to like?

A few things to note: The amount of sauce this produces is kinda skimpy. As it is, it really only makes enough for 2 (even though the recipe claims it serves 6). Also, I don't strain (or "sieve") the sauce... because that just reduces it down to an even smaller amount. Shallots and garlic should be chopped fine (minced). Scallops should probably be cooked 3 minutes on each side, not 2. And the pasta ("taglierini") doesn't exist in any store I've ever been to... I use fettuccine instead.

I have made this dish many times, and I always screw up the bloody beurre blanc, but I still get raves. I always serve it with garlic-saffron rissotto cakes which I lightly fry. People lick the plates clean and fight over any leftover rissotto cakes.

Very Nice. Easy to make however, we are sauce lovers and felt that the next time I make this I would make extra. It was excellant paired with roasted asperagus.

This dish is outstanding! The strained sauce has a delicate, sophisticated flavor that is perfect with the sweet scallops. This one's a keeper.

This was so good! I couldn't bring myself to strain all the wonderful seasoning though, and it was great!

Very good. We liked the stronger flavor of adding some of the more textured ingredients from the sauce straining back in. Next time we'll use a Rosemary spring and not strain the sauce. Otherwise it was easy and excellent. Great with fresh asparagus.

The Beurre Blanc was a fabulous sauce for asparagus; the flavors blended deliciously. I think the flavors would be too strong for delicate scallops and will tone down when I try the whole recipe with the pasta.

Good recipe to start with. I made the following changes It was fantastic & loaded with flavor! First, I doubled recipe, added a tin of anchovies and 1/3 cup clam juice to the beure blanc, and used only half of the rosemary called for. Served over angel hair pasta. It was out of this world! Next time I'll use shrimp or white fish and toss in some chopped clams. Can't wait.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except I did not garnish with rosemary. I thought the rosemary, which is a very strong herb, was way too much for the scallops. It would have been better with just lemon and something lighter like dill. It wasn't awful........just not a repeat in my book.

The sauce is amazing on other seafood, such as grilled fish, or blackened fish.

Suggestion for the scallops: Cut a criss-cross pattern (like a checkerboard, not too deep) across the top of the scallops before cooking them... helps the sauce really get down into the sweet scallops & even makes them a little crispier.

This recipe was TASTY. I used farfalle, and highly recommend that shape of pasta, I don't like guests having to struggle with long pasta.

I thought this was a great dish. If you use fresh pasta the sauce is perfect, not to lite at all. I served it as an app. for seven people it was wonderful.

Absolutely delicious!! Instead of serving it over pasta, I did a side of roasted garlic-rosemary potatoes. Also, I didn't strain the sauce at the end-much better to keep the good stuff in!! Wonderful!!! A must try!!

I found the vinegar flavor overwhelming.

Great dish overall. Sauce is a bit light for the pasta, and would be better just drizzled over the scallops and served with some bread or polenta on the side for mopping up.

We enjoyed this wonderful dish made with fresh scallops shipped in from Maine for Christmas Eve dinner. It was an exquisite culinary experience!

Sauce was too light for the pasta. Maybe better served with a rice side and spoon the sauce over the scallops.

Since I don't eat pasta, I served the beurre blanc over cod (pan-fried in asiago cheese). This is the best beurre blanc I have found -- well worth the time spent simmering. I will be serving it over scallops next week.

Excellent dish, one of the best scallops and pasta recipes I have tried. Loved the fresh rosemary with buerre blanc sauce.

Loved the recipe, but changed the sauce to a blood orange beurreblanc. Also used angel hair in place of Tagliolini and fried the cooked pasta sligtly to give it a "cruchy" consistency. It got raves!!
