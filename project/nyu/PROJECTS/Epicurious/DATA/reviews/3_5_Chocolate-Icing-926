This is such an easy recipe! I loved how quick is came together and the silky texture is amazing. I used Kahlua instead of Kirsch. Was going for a "mocha" flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a dark, rather than milk, chocolate icing. Too intensely chocolate for the yellow cake I used it with, but would be excellent with a more robust cake. I put the warm icing in a bath of ice water to make it set faster. Worked like a charm.

Yum. Great recipe,easy and fast to make. Made before I started the cake so it would have time to "set up" Set up TOO well. Dipped the pan in 1/2 of hot water for 30 sec and re-whipped..perfect for spreading. I had no kirsch so I subbed almond ext. Voila! Will never buy canned again!

I made this icing for a layer cake. I had a feeling it wouldn't be enough, but just for anyone out there wondering, this recipe is really meant for a sheet or one layer cake. I added 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar to stiffen it and add bulk, but i doubt it was necessary. i won't do that again. It was tasty, quite rich obviously and i was able to cover each layer of cake leaving the sides bare. Birthday party guests seemed to like it!

Very good recipe, especially if you use a high qulity chocolate. I sweetened it with 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and used almond extra for flavor. I frosted a 13X9 cake and had alot of extra frosting. Easy recipe as these are ingrediants I usually have on hand.

Wow. This is the best icing I have ever had. You must have the patience to wait for the chocolate to completely melt before continuing and to wait for it to cool and to thicken which can take a couple of hours. The reward is worth the wait. I used this on a Duncan Hines yellow cake (follow box recipe). This icing is so good that no one notices the cake.

Very good!! I made a double recipe to ice 4-layers. I had a lot left over. It needed to sit way longer than an hour to be spreadable. I will definitely make it again. Easy and very good.

I made this icing for a 3 layer cake. I increased all the ingredients by 1/3. 1 cup whipping cream, 12 oz semisweet chocolate, etc. It was just the right amount of icing for the 3 layers. I spread the icing while it was still a little thin and it kept its beautiful glossy shine. It got rave reviews at our buffet lunch.

Lovely, glossy icing. I was at bit impatient - it does take a while to thicken. Also, I substitued Drambuie which worked well. Guests loved it!

THE BEST recipe for chocolate icing. Easy to make, too.
