This recipe could have used more ginger and I ended up putting more in after reheating right before serving. The matzo balls were light and very tasty.

these are the best matzo balls ever. Full of flavor, fluffy, just yummy. The consomme is very good too, light with a hint of exotic. The only change is to use kaffir lime in the broth. Need to make it again soon

WOW this is really really amazing. The lemon grass added a very subtle and rich flavor and the matza balls were just perfect.

So good and easy to make vegetarian! Just don't use the chicken and water. Instead cook the onion, leek and garlic in some oil until translucent-then add the other consomme ingredients and a light flavored veggie broth, bring to a boil then let it simmer for an hour or more until the flavor is awesome. As for the matzo balls, I replaced the chicken fat with 1/3 cup of oil (half olive, half canola), and veggie broth for the chicken broth. My veggie husband and I LOVED IT! Better than chicken noodle soup for a cold :) Add egg noodles if you want but don't need it.

Just made it for this years Passover. The soup was delicious, and the matzo balls the best. I never cooked them for so long before, but I made them just like the recipe called for and they were light, fluffy and so tasty. I'll never make matzo balls from a box again. Excellent Recipe, a hit at the seder.

Oh boy, what a refreshing and delicious twist on Passover. I have had Passover matzo balls soup for over 60 years on different Jewish traditional tables. (I grew up on a kibbutz in Israel). This recipe is delightful. I made it first as soon as I got the magazine, made it as written and liked it. But for the second and third times I believe I improved it's flavors by substituting Green Onions for the leeks in the Matzo Balls recipe (chopped it very very fine). The Chicken Fat is a must, b/c when I tried it with butter (OK I know it's not Kosher to use butter) it just did not taste as rich and deep. Those Matzo balls were so fluffy, amazing. As for the Consomme It was best with double the Lemongrass amount, a bit more Ginger and I have access to Kafir Leaves which I added in addition to the Lime Peel. After years of being bored with "traditional" Matzo Ball soup, I loved this one and from now on, when I have Passover at my house, I will forgo the tradition and use this one, which is a keeper. By the way, I used the chicken meat to make Asian Chicken Salad, very appropriate.
