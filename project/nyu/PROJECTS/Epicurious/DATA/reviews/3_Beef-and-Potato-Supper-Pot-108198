Good recipe, everyone enjoyed. Very close to what Ive been served by a Japanese friend. This is considered mothers cooking in Japan, and absolutely qualifies as comfort food. As for the beef, the small amount is certainly more authentic. The typical Japanese diet contains little beef, and its fairly pricey over there.

I used Oriental Flavor soup instead of the dashi, and the sauce did not thicken. Needs more meat.

This simple stew is 100% comfort food. I made the following changes to the recipe (and my whole family loved it): 1) Onion: 1 large onion was sufficient 2) Beef: 1/3 lb? For 4 people? Are they kidding? I upped it to 1.25 lb. I also marinated the beef in the fridge for 4 hours with 1/2T rice vinegar, 1T vegetable oil and 3T soy sauce. 3) Substitutions: 3A) Dashi--14 oz. vegetable stock 3B) Mirin & Sake--4T vermouth 4) Cooking Time: It took ~45 minutes before the potatoes got soft enough (but didn't go to mush). 5) Pairings: I served this with an asian salad and had midori martinis to start.

Definitely the perfect comfort food. Easy to prepare and tasty. The beef is cooked to absolute tenderness, the onions and potatoes complement the slightly sweet sauce well. My only comment would be that you need to cook it longer to get a syrupy sauce; otherwise, it'll be more of a stewy, yet still delicious, sauce.
