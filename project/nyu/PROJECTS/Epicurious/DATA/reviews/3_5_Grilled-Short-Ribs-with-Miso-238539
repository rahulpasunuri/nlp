Marinated for a few hours, which I think gave more tenderness (and more convenient for our schedule!) then grilled- great flavor! Very simple and SO delicious! I can also see that flank steak would also lend itself to this recipe. WIll definitely make it again!

Fantastic. Finally found a recipe that's even better than a favorite butcher in Toronto uses to make his Korean ribs. Rave reviews, no leftovers, and so quick and easy. Used dark brown organic sugar from Whole Foods and I think the flavour of it made a difference.

I really liked this dish- and will make it again. I also cut down on the soy sauce so it wouldn't be too salty. My butcher was out of flanken-style short ribs, so I used skirt steak, which turned out quite nicely. I marinaded the steak for about 7 hours, turning and massaging every few hours. The steak grilled very quickly and had so much flavor! It was quite good wrapped with sticky rice, red miso, and a few Asian pickles in a butter lettuce leaf. Also served it with nori, but I felt it overpowered the flavor of the meat a little. Still delicious though.

I thought this was good but the grilling of the meat doesn't allow for the meat to become very tender and there is too much waste. Next time I'll opt for flank or skirt steak. We made the pickles (outstanding addition to this) and had both lettuce and nori available. My preference was to eat this with the nori as it adds an extra dimension of flavor.

I thought this recipe was great! I marinated the flanken ribs overnight. They're easy to grill too, just a few minutes on each side; no guessing as to whether the meat is done, as with thicker cuts.

I made this recipe with one package flanken ribs and one package skirt steak. Both came out great and very tender! My husband and I preferred the skirt steak, my kids liked the ribs better.

My wife dislikes short ribs because she finds them greasy, but she allowed me to try this. The more I looked at it, the less I thought a quick sear on both sides was going to yield tender meat, so I slow- roasted it at 250 degrees wrapped in foil with the marinade mixture for an hour and a half, then finished it on the grill, brushing on more of the marinade. We cut the meat off and wrapped in lettuce leaves as suggested, and the result was uite tasty.
