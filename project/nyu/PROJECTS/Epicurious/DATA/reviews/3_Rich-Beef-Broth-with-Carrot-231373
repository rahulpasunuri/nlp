Fabulous!!! I used oxtails, beef stew meat and neck bones. How absolutely fabulous!!! I even prepared it for my mother in law who was put on clear liquids for 3 days - she loved it! I now am preparing it for my husband as a before dinner tapas! It is filling, rich and satisfying. The roasting makes the broth so rich - when cooled it is a great jello!!! I grew up learning to prepare broths in this manner and it is the best! Try it with chicken wings, legs, backs and gizzards (not the liver, not sure why!). enjoy

Saying I wouldn't make this recipe again is not actually true. I would make it, but only because I would make the short rib terrine again, and this naturally comes along with it. My friends and I had a tapas party and actually made all of the recipes in Gourmet's recent spread on Spain. Somehow I ended up with this recipe, which was very labor intensive and took forever. The broth itself was not that exciting. Most people took a sip and then put it down. Half filled cups littered the room. I think that drinking broth might be just too strange a concept for us...
