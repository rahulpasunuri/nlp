We love waldorf salads, and this one as well. I, however, didn't add the grapefruit, but did add one rib of celery, and added walnuts instead of pine nuts. I usually use a Delicious apple in waldorf salad, so enjoyed the slight tartness of the Granny Smith and the sweetness of the pear (used a ripe Red D'anjou). Was concerned about the cajun spices, but not to fear, they were great. Even used a little more than called for. Served it with a store bought roast chicken for a nice summer meal!

Nice mix of fruit but pretty uninspiring dressing, in spite of how great it reads.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. We are both on low fat diets and tired of boring receipes the doctor gives out. We love Cajun seasoning. It gave this recipe a great zing!

Sorry to see that other reviewers were not as thrilled with this recipe as I am. We've been making it for several years - usually in the fall or winter as an accompaniment to pork roast and root vegetable casserole. I even served it for Thanksgiving this year. A few suggestions I'd make to future testers - use a fresh ruby red grapefruit (I've tried canned and the salad is bitter), use fresh squeeze orange juice (much sweeter) and find a ripe Bosc pear (they are awesome). I hope others will be as inspired as I am!

I have been rewarded with some appreciative glances and comments when serving this lovely salad. It has returned to my table at least 10 times since I discovered the recipe - and now I am finding myself fulfilling requests for it!

not worth the trouble to make

I served this salad with a smoked leg of lamb from Iceland. It complimented the salty and heavily smoked flavor well. I did leave out the Cajun spices however.

Neither my fiance or I are much on Waldorf salad, but I decided to give this variation a try. For our preparation we used red seedless grapes and Granny Smith apple. We couldn't find a bose pear so we ended up using an Asian pear-apple. We also sustituted pistachios for the pine nuts. We served the salad at a family gathering where it got many compliments, but my fiance and I just weren't inspired enough to become Waldorf fans.

I have made this salad several times and have gotten raves. I used the new pre-washed salad greens which made the prep very easy.
