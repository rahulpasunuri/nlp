Nothing special, would be better without the saffron!

Great base recipe. I used it to pair with the Ropa Vieja recipe from this site-so eliminated the parmesan (will keep try it when paring with an Italian main). Based on other reviews I put the saffron in with one can of chicken broth and added the orzo after it came to a boil and cooked the 5-7 min until the broth was absorbed - gave the full flavor of the saffron. Also didn't add the butter for this "version".

This recipe does not take full advantage of the saffron. By steeping the saffron in the stock for an hour ahead of time you extract more of the saffron flavor.

Was not a fan of this recipe as is. However it may be worthwhile if some of the other reviewers suggestions were taken like adding prociutto or back, broccoli flourets or other veggies.

I make a similar recipe to this from my Moosewood cookbook, and it has been a favorite every time. I just boil the Orzo in water and I use olive oil instead of butter. I also enjoy the addition of flatleaf parsley. The saffron is such a delicate, yet distinctive flavor that it goes well with just about anything, but I served this alongside some broiled Tilapia with Parmesan and some sauteed zucchini. Delicious!

I made this as written. It was fabulous with grilled steak and sauteed zucchini. I did, however, add a little fresh parsley. My husband and I loved it.

As a non-meat eater, I substituted vegetable stock for the chicken stock and added some broccoli flourets I had left over...it was a delicious alternative for my 3 year old son-he's a fan of pasta and butter!

I added about 1/2 cup of chopped, flat leaf parsley and could have made a meal out of the orzo by itself -- eaten out of the pot. As it was, I finished the, not substantial, leftovers as I was doing dishes. What a fantastic, super-easy dish -- and one that doesn't taste like it took only minutes!!! According to my harshest (and most honest) critic, my beloved husband, it's company worthy. NOTE: I paired this with Chicken, Proscuitto, Rosemary, and White Wine from Bon Appetit, October 2002. Beautiful presentation: yellow orzo, red sauce, green herbs.

This is a super easy side dish that I will definitely make again. I used half the amount of butter and half the amount of cheese as suggested by another reviewer. It turned out great.

Really just confirming the other reviews here, this dish was a smash hit. I made this alongside of Osso Buco, instead of the more traditional risotto milanese, simply because it was much easier and seemed to be a bit lighter. My dinner party flipped over this, they really enjoyed it. Best part is, so easy and quick to make it can be thrown together for just about any regular weeknight meal.

Great side dish, and easy. I added a bit of chopped parsley for color and served it with Grilled Salmon with Balsamic Glaze, and Wilted Greens (both at this site), for a wonderful midweek dinner.

Great side dish for anytime of the year. Part of a really terrific menu. Sometime try the whole menu..you won't be sorry.

This recipe has everything going for it. Number one, it is really delicious: well balanced, subtle, and fragrant, with each component discernable but blending beautifully too. It presents well with the golden yellow plus the red/orange strands of saffron mixed in. It goes with just about everything except beef, I'd say, and is easy & quick to prepare. All this, plus you can keep the ingredients on hand all the time, there's nothing perishable. No last minute shopping, no planning, just think of it, make it and enjoy it.

A good side dish. I thought it had too much butter into it and needed a bit more saffron.

we make this wonderful side dish all the time - it is great with osso bucco in the winter and in the autumn we serve it with ratatouille.

This recipe has become a staple in our kitchen, since I first found it in Gourmet back in 1990. Just stumbled across it again on the website. The subtle flavor is sublime, and is especially well-suited as a side dish for grilled or smoked meats.I use powdered (ground) saffron instead of threads for ease of use.

Excellent side dish. We have made this many times and each time our guests ask for the recipe. I recently served this with a chiken dish covered with mango and papaya salsa. My guests said they could eat the orzo and the salsa as a meal itself.

This is a lovely side dish, which has always had great reviews from everyone I've made it for. I've made it with chicken and with red meat, and it complements both nicely. Be careful of adding too much parmesan, as this can make it taste a little too much like macaroni and cheese, and can drown out the subtle taste of the saffron.
