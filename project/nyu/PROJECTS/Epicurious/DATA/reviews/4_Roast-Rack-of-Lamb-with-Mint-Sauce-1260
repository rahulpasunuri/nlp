Excellent. Only one change to bring to 2012 standard: skip the cornstarch in the mint sauce and make it a mint jus instead. Delicious.

The mint sauce was not as good as expected. I made as instructed (or thought so) and the flavor of the stock, mint and vinegar didn't seem to marry.

First time that I made this and it's a keeper for sure. I only made 2- 8 chop racks and doubled the sauce and had plenty of sauce. Really didn't need to double for the 2, but excellent and all loved it. I added 10 more minutes to the final cooking time, but was a little too done for me, but still was wonderful. I guess everyone's oven cooks differently so use a thermometer to determine for sure. I didn't look at mine until to late.

Mint jelly just cannot compare the sweet and savory sauce mint sauce in this recipe. The minty breadcrumb mixture added a great crunch. See http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

This was a very flavorful way of preparing lamb and my dinner party guests really enjoyed it. Highly recommend searing the lamb before roasting it for added color and flavor--I reduced the initial high temperature roasting time accordingly. Everyone loved the mint sauce but I didn't like how thick it was. Perhaps I used too much cornstarch. In any case, next time, I'll probably cut the cornstarch in half.

This was my first experience cooking lamb. My mother in-law has always served lamb for Easter and I wanted to continue the tradition. The entire family, including my picky mother in-law, said this was the best lamb they'd ever tasted!!!

The mint sauce is a favorite. It's simple and tasty. It tastes so much more complex (in a good way) than it is to make.

The sauce was wonderful, but there wasn't enough as written. I suggest doubling it. Lamb ended up perfect, but cooked it an extra 15 minutes for medium rare.

Exceptional recipe. Made it for my Easter dinner - quite the hit. And my husband doesn't even like lamb. In the sauce, I doubled everything but the mint (just didn't have two cups of fresh mint...) and it was still exceptional. Used standard bread crumbs (not home made). Found "20 minutes longer" a bit too rare and cooked for about 30 instead. Will make again for company and special occasions.

By far the best meal I have ever served. The flavors were fabulous and leftovers were scarce. I will make this again and again...easy, pretty and melt-in- your-mouth delicious. Served with green beans, pasta with sauteed walnuts, parsley and garlic and crusty bread. The ONLY thing I would do differently is to double the sauce recipe in order to have plenty for all.

It doesn't get much easier than this to create a gorgeous meal. Made it for New Years Eve and guests raved about it. Followed the recipe as is, except I used chicken stock in the sauce (will try beef the next time) and reduced the amount of bread crumbs by half. The crispy crumbs were a delight. Served with glazed carrots, green beans and polenta.

Lovely flavor, everything came together very nicely. The sauce was surprisingly perfect - it wasnt as overwhelming as I thought it would be...

I made this for the first time for my husband's birthday in 2002, as lamb is his favorite meal, and he orders the rack whenever he sees it on a menu, and it has since been his request for his birthday every year. I'm not a big lamb eater, but this sauce makes the whole dish!

There must be something wrong or missing from this sauce recipe. It says it makes about one cup of sauce, but when you prepare it, it doesn't come near to that...more like 1/4 cup, if that. Did I miss something?

For Easter I made the lamb without the breadcrumbs searing it first on the stove then cooking it in the oven. The sauce I made was loved by all, not a spoonful remained. I did make some changes partially based on other reviews; chicken stock and putting the sauce in blender rather than sieving My own improvements consisted of substituting half the red wine vinegar with raspberry vinegar and instead of sugar I used a little honey. The next time I cook lamb I'll definitely make this delicious mint sauce again

A BIG hit for Easter. Used just the mustard/mint on the lamb - without the breadcrumbs.

I'm planning on making this recipe this weekend for a dinner party. Any suggestions for side dishes? Although I haven't made this recipe yet I'm giving this 4 fork recipes so as not to drag down the excellent rating.

Perfect classic preperation! I appreciate the "all-oven" cooking method.

wouldn't change a thing - the sauce is such a huge improvement on the "mint jelly" so often served w/lamb - delicious!!!!

If I could give this a higher rating I would.This was our Christmas Eve meal and it was superior. Did not change a thing. A huge hit with all.

OUTSTANDING! This has to be one of the best rack of lamb recipes out there. Flavors were intense but not overwhelming. The flavor of the lamb was not masked by heavy herbs, etc. The mint sauce is a little time consuming but so easy and so so rewarding. It definately takes the flavor of the lamb up a notch. Definately a keeper! Everyone LOVED this meal. Thanks Epicurious!

I can only comment on the sauce and it was fabulous. I served it with lamb chops, brushed with Dijon and grilled on the BBQ. Will definely make again.

Trust me when I say BEST rack of lamb recipe out there! Labm is my husbands favorite, made it for his b-day last year- he still rants and raves everytime we have lamb out. Time consuming, but worth every minute!

I did not read this recipe thoroughly and ultimatley did just about everything wrong when it came to measurements and time and it still came out fantastic! A really wonderful combination of flavors! My girlfriend and I both loved it and highly recommend it.

I used 1.5 tablespoons of my own dried mint leaves for one cup of bread crumbs. I also believe in simple recipes. This is definitly a keeper.

I made this for a special dinner recently, Wow! The rack was wonderful and juicy with great flavor. The mint sauce was different and complemented the meat, but I think I'll skip it next time. The meat was great on it's own or maybe with a savory sauce instead. The recipe is very simple except for the cooling time for the mint sauce (I ended up microwaving at the end, not wanting room temperature sauce). Not over cooking the lamb is key and I found that I almost did trying to get to 130 degrees. If you like it more rare, stop cooking earlier.

A simple, delicious recipe. Followed exactly -- no changes. Tasted like something you would order in a restaurant. I couldn't believe the flavor of the sauce, with so little effort. A keeper, for sure!

Absolutely wonderful. Had 14 over for a dinnerparty and everyone loved them. It was simple to make, presentation was great and the sauce was devine.

WOWSA! Wonderful technique and easy! I did sear the rack just to get a little jump start. If you are pushed to the wall with time and energy, try Crosse and Blackwell mint sauce. I have tried them all in England and this is the best. No mouth pucker...also..I used fresh rosemary to substitute for the mint.( I had some in a pot in my greenhouse.) Again,this is glorious. Your guests will be knocked off their feet.

Lovely, elegant, and simple. The person who thought that the mint sauce was tedious is so wrong. Nothing about this recipe was hard and the results are spectacular.

This is a great meal! The sauce take awhile to make but well worth it.

Incredible, outstanding recipe! This is a refreshing change from the simple rosemary, garlic, olive oil marinated and then grilled lamb recipes. I used lamb loin chops (1.5") and cooked it at 450F for 10 minutes and then only for about 10 minutes at 350 F. Any longer in the oven and the chops would have been done medium to medium-well. I suggest making this dish for everyday, not-so-special occasions - I would probably make more elaborate sauces for the holidays. I see no need to change this recipe - I send my comments to the chef.

I cannot rate the lamb since I used another recipe, but only the mint sauce, to which I would give 2 forks. My dining companion felt that the sauce wasn't "minty" enough. I could have added more choppped mint, but instead used a few drops of pure peppermint extract - maybe a few drops too many! Also, I substituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar. My leg of lamb, marinated in garlic, oil and herbs, and grilled over charcoal, needed no sauce of any kind. Still, the mint sauce was tasty.

Fantastic and not nearly as complicated as it sounds. This was the first time I'd ever made lamb and all guests agreed it was a knockout - super moist, tender, and savory. The sauce is phenomenal. Made for one heck of a special New Year's. Uses a TON of fresh mint - buy at least four bunches.

If you want an easy to make, very impressive lamb dish, this is it. My husband requests this recipe for his birthday every year. He's had rack of lamb at some very fine restaurants and still thinks this one is the best. Try creamy mashed sweet potatoes with this.

This recipe appears overwhelming, but I have to say that its the BEST rack of lamb dish yet. My guests raved about it and have made it over and over again. The only thing is that the sauce wasn't enough, so I increased beef broth to 3/4 cup. You won't be disappointed! A winner!

Quite simple, really. A good winter dish. You'll never go back to that nasty, store-bought mint jelly after you taste this sauce!
