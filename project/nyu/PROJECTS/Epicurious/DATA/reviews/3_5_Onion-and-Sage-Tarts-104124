I just made these tarts for Thanksgiving. The tart shells are amazing and the onions were also incredible. It was the favorite dish tonight! I was a litle nervous about making the pastry as I have not had good luck with pastry in the past but the directions were excellent and it was very easy.

While the crust is very, very good, I've used Pillsbury unroll and bake pie crust with excellent results - especially on the Friday night dinner /cocktails parties. You can carmelize the onions a day or two in advance and put together in a flash. Great feedback from guests.

Definitely a winner at my house. Tried this last Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made 2 large free-form tarts, it was amazing, I love the taste of the sage. We enjoyed it again at Christmas and many parties after the holidays. It's definitely on my list for this holiday season. Enjoy!

Absolutely Fantastic. This is the best tart I have ever made. I bought pillsbury dough and placed in a tart pan, baked tart first then added onions and cream. It was easy and too good

Made this dish for a dinner party with girlfriends. Used Pillsbury pie dough that is sold rolled up - found in the freezer section. It was perfect because it was thin and I did not place it in a tart pan. I served it almost like a very thin pizza. It was really decicious. I'm making this for x-mas.

Fabulous. This was good at room temperature so it would be perfect to serve at a party & make up the day before. I made my own pastry dough which was pretty easy.

This has become one of the "house" appetizers for entertaining. I dice a high quality bacon which really adds to the texture of the tarts. Also, a standard cheat is to use Pepperidge Farm tartlet shells. I can get over 30 individual tarts from the base recipe and they are the perfect size for hors d'oeuvres

This is a delicious tart. The onions do take a lot more time to caramelize and develop flavour. I agree with one of the reviewers: 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. I did this ahead of time as suggested in the recipe. I found that prebaking the flaky pastry worked very well and made it easy to assemble the tart. Another 20 to 25 minutes in the oven and voila! It tasted great at room temperature. I made this tart as one of several appetizers in a Slow Food Tasting Dinner in our community. Everyone loved it!

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving since I found it and for parties in between. It's an unusual dish that people who appreciate fresh herbs will love. My friends all ask for it every year.

A fabulous dish, always a great appetizer. Everyone always asks for it again! I don't use any egg, the heavy whipping cream is always enough. I've also used it to stuff phyllo cups, and mushrooms.

This was a lot of work for a so-so appetizer. The pastry recipe was excellent (and will use it again), but the filling was not well received. In fact, ended up throwing out 3 of the 4 tarts. Won't be making this again.

I was disappointed with this one. Maybe I did something wrong because my cooking times were WAY off. It was unattractive and the flavor was ok but nothing special.

These are an OUTSTANDING appetizer. I opted to use the mini phyllo cups, and baked them still for the 15 minutes. The caramelizing process took me about 1 1/2 hours, but it is SO worth it. VERY YUMMY!

This recipe should be noted for die-hard onion lovers only -- it might be called "Mouth Full of Onion Tart." Not everyone at my cocktail party was that passionate about onions, so more than a few were left over. One bite could prevent kissing sessions for a few days...

I made this in 3 1/2 inch shells; I wish they had been a bit more liquid-tight. I pre-baked them, but when I added the filling, they leaked. Because I was cooking for company, I grabbed some goat's cheese off our cheese platter and sprinkled it on top. They wound up tasting great, but the experience was a little stressful. The sage is delicious.

I did not have enough time to make my own crust, so I used a package of crescent rolls that I rolled out to fit the tart pan. It still came out wonderful. Next time I will use the mini shells, which someone else mentioned. It will make a great appetizer.

Recipe was great, but cooking times were EXTREMELY misleading. The onions took 1 1/2 hours to cook and the tart needed at least 1/12 hours in the oven. When it was finished it was great, but we didn't eat until 10:30!

Maybe it was just me but I didn't find this recipe all that exciting (although some people really liked it). I think it didn't have enough liquid. But I did use frozen tart shells, which filled about 25 tarts or so, and also used Vidalia onions.

Fantastic! Everyone loved this. I too used phyllo mini cups since I wanted hors d'oeuvres.

I substituted mini phylo dough shells and filled with the onion sage filling. They were delicious and very easy to make.

This was outstanding. A total hit at our Thanksgiving holiday party. In place of the sage I added thyme and basil and it was great. In order to avoid a soft crust I increased the temp by 25 degree and let it in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.

A huge hit at Thanksgiving. I used a food processor to slice the onions, frozen filo tarts - two boxes, about 30 or so total. Finally, I used dried sage (half of fresh).

These are DELICIOUS. Foolproof and pretty, too! I must admit I cheated and used tiny phyllo cups, because I wanted individual appetizers to serve for a party. They worked WONDERFULLY. I sliced the onions a bit thinner than the recipe suggested so that they would fit neatly in the cups. It worked great...I'm going to make them again for a Christmas party in a couple of weeks. You can't go wrong with this recipe; it will make you look like a total pro!! :)

Was running out of time before my party so I used pre-packaged fillo tart shells. The result was still excellent. I will make this again trying the pastry recipe. Although I liked the bite-sized tarts using the fillo, I would recommend chopping the onions a little more to get them into the shells more easily. My husband cruised through the kitchen & snuck several bites of the caramalized onions mid-preparation!

I made this to along with my Thanksgiving dinner, as one of my guests particularly enjoys an onion dish that I don't make. She ( and everyone else in attendance)thought this was just delicious! We used it as a side dish and it was just FABULOUS! The onions took some time to cook though, so plan ahead.Make those in advance.

Excellent recipe. The crust was incredibly flakey and good. I would definitely recommend this one.

Listen to me...make these Onion Tarts. Make them tonight. You won't be disappointed. We substituted fresh rosemary for sage since that's what we had in the garden. It was great although I recommending cutting back on the amount of herbs you use. It wasn't overpowering, but it was darn close. A little less rosemary (or sage) might be a good adjustment. Enjoy.

Delicious and fairly easy to make. My family loved it too. I'll definitly make this again soon. I used a non-stick pot the first time, next time I'll try steel as it took about 15 minutes longer for the onions to carmelize completely. The pastry was easy to make too -- I really liked that I didn't need to have special pans or forms on hand.
