This is fabulous! My husband even said "plenty good". Delish...I added mushrooms which was a nice touch.

I used this as a sauce for ribeye steak. I did not use butter and i substituted leeks for shallots. The cumin really adds a good flavor.

I didn't make this as a salad, just made the sauce to drizzle over sliced filet cooked on the grill, and it was delicioius. I also cut the shallots in half as recommended. Everyone thought it was amazing, myself included.

Wow! This was so simple and so delicious. I love that there's only one thing to chop. I will make this again and again. The only thing is I don't think it's enough to serve four.

I needed a quick solution and so used an onion, rice wine vinegar, and baby spinach as substitutes - I also added feta and grape tomatoes. It turned out beautifully and the guests devoured it.

Quick, easy and, most importantly, delicious! In addition to the S, P, and cumin, I added some garlic powder and cardamom. The suggestion from other reviewers to add mushrooms was a good one. (I used Baby Bellas.) I didn't have any dark brown sugar so I used about 1/2 c real maple syrup. I'm looking forward to inviting a few folks over and using this recipe. Finally, I can spend my time with company instead of in the kitchen.

There are many better recipes on this site that are a better use of a good steak.

As recommended, I cut the shallots to 1 cup and added 1 cup of sliced mushrooms. I also added some broiled asparagus. Delish!

This was a very good recipe. I did make a couple of changes after reading the reviews. I used baby greens and arugula instead of escarole. I also used half the amount of shallots and added 1 cup of sliced mixed mushrooms. The dish turned out fantastic and my husband and I enjoyed it very much.

If you're unsure about trying this because of the cumin, don't be afraid! The flavour is present but subtle. I used muscovado sugar which I found gave too much of a molasses taste - I'd try a lighter brown sugar next time. I also reduced the amount of shallots and added mushrooms. The rub is excellent and I'm going to try it with pork chops. I would also try substituting a full bodied vinaigrette and simply serve the beef over greens (without shallots and mushrooms).

I've made this several times and we love it. It may not be the best dish for company however as the flavors are very strong between the cumin, the wine vinegar and the shallots. Buy some really tender steak for this one and some good wine. It's an easy recipe and goes pretty quickly. I use baby spinach instead of escarole.

I used leftover steak and only heated it up for a minute or two. Also, I included mushrooms to the sauce, and the whole meal was delicious.

The addition of cumin to the steak is yummy, and the sauce is good-- but keep in mind that the recipe calls for a whole lot of shallots-- way more than I'd want. I used 3 oz of shallots for double the meat/salad and the sauce made a perfect dressing with ample shallots.

Wow. OK, I didn't have any of the right ingredients, homebound with a child who just had surgery, and still this dish came out fantastic. I used 1 top round steak cut into two pieces. I substituted white balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, white sugar for the brown and spring mix greens for the escarole. Since I didn't have any cumin, I used montreal steak seasoning which had salt pepper and cumin in it and no shallots, so I chopped up 2c of onions really fine. As an extra boost I made a seperate pan of red potatoes cut into pieces and sprinkled with the seasoning, cooked in a non stick skillet for the same amount of time as the steak, covered, and shaken frequently, until browned and I topped those on the salad with the same sauce. It was STILL fantastic. I think next time, I will definitely make it according to directions, the red wine vinegar would give it a nice flavor, and I may sprinkle it with crumbled blue cheese. I think I will stick with the spring mix salad greens, since I like those better than escarole. This recipe is deinitely a keeper.

My husband and I loved the combination of flavors found in this recipe. We had leftover meat and sauce, I used it as meat and gravy over leftover mashed potatoes for our next days lunch. I liked the meat so much that next time I prepare a steak alone I will follow this recipe.

Outstanding! Adding the cumin to the steak is a wonderful touch. My wife is still raving about this dish!
