This was the first time I have ever made fudge and so I'm no expert, but this seemed to work out perfectly for me. I didn't even have a candy thermometer, so I just kept the sugar mixture just barely boiling for the 10 minutes. Also I used whole evaporated milk not fat free. Fortunately I didn't read the reviews beforehand or I wouldn't have even tried. I'm guessing that I got lucky, but at the same time, I would recommend anyone give this a try if you think it sounds good. The ingredients aren't so expensive and it doesn't take much effort. For me, it turned out exactly like the fudge you get in the store.

I've been making fudge every Christmas for 31 years - up to 50 pounds EACH year & have never had such a disasterous outcome! Grainy, greasy, globby. Against my better judgement, I followed the recipe's recommendation to boil the milk/sugar mixture at a far higher rate than we traditionally use. Milk curdled, sugar burned & fats separated when incorporated into the chocolates. Waste of time and money. The recipe sounded interesting as it was 'darker' & used espresso powder which I use in other chocolate dishes with great success. If you're not a seasoned candy/fudge cook, stear clear of this recipe. Had I read the reviews prior, I would have simply made another batch of my award-winning fudge and applied my own adjustments.

I had never made or tried fudge and, if it weren't by folks here stating that this is far from good fudge, I'd never even try fudge again.

These were delicious. The ground expresso beans are definetly noticeable, but it adds a completely new taste to this fudge that blends excellently with chocolate and the walnuts. I did have trouble at first with the fudge sticking to the pan, but that was easily remedied with a spatula and a little extra time and attention. I highly recommend making and eating these.

I agree with other reviewers about the need to use fat free evap milk. My fudge is chilling right now but there was quite a layer of grease over the top of it that I had to soak up with some paper towels. I screwed up with the recipe though and while I doubt anyone else would make the same mistake, I'll share my cautionary tale. Since the closest market (to which I can walk) only had evaporated goat's milk, I thought I'd try that. Turns out it has a lower boiling point than regular milk. I most likely over cooked mine and I ended up with little pieces of burnt sugar. Plus it took a ridiculously long time to get it to 234 degrees. Anyway, I'm sure it has already firmed up fine and save some pieces of crunchy sugar and a little grease on top, it should be fine.

Delish! A nice treat, really hit the spot. I didn't have any of the problems others have mentioned, and the finished candy was neither grainy nor greasy (I had to use whole evap. milk, as you can't get fat-free here). It was very simple to make and much harder to screw up than some recipes. I felt it had good authentic 'fudgey' flavor and texture (smooth and creamy), but that may have been due to the higher fat content of the milk I used.

This is a sweet fudge. I like sweet so that was fine with me. Be sure to have a large pot. My pot was not big enough to handle the expanding of the mix while boiling without overflowing so I couldn't reach necessary temperature.

I was very disappointed in the outcome of this "fudge". It's very greasy and lumpy - though I followed the recipe to a T! What a waste of quality ingredients!!

I followed the directions for this fudge carefully. This fudge is gritty and greasy and tastes like refrigerated icing. I will try to make "real" fudge next time!

I really like this fudge - it isn't as sweet as some of the others you might see and the espresso adds a nice touch. I use this one each year (as I only make fudge at Christmas!!)

I thought this was just OK. You definitely get out what you put into it so best quality chocolate (and for that matter, any other ingredients) goes without saying. I added mixed nuts that I had toasted with fleur de sel and rosemary-it went decidedly foodie, but nothing really alters the fact that quick fudge can have a granular texture (that sticking, burning at the back of the throat?)

This is a tasty recipe, but let's be clear here. It's not real fudge. It has a fudge-y flavor, but not a fudge-y consistency. For that you'd have to use less chocolate and more sugar/corn syrup. "Easy" fudges tend to be made with sweetened condensed milk, while real, old fashioned fudge is made with cream, butter, sugar, corn syrup, and a smaller amount of chocolate than is called for in this recipe. Bon Appetit doesn't really 'do' candy, so I couldn't find an alternate recipe to link to, but people who are interested in serious fudge may want to try the recipes in the Joy of Cooking.

Delicious and easy. I will definitely make again and will double the recipe.

Delicious, easy & was great for gifts. Got lots of compliments. I used Del Ray bittersweet chocolate, recommended by my local Whole Foods grocery store -- very nice. I cut it into much smaller pieces, about 1 inch x 1/2 inch. It's rich enough that this seemed much more appropriate. I toasted the walnuts in the oven at 325 for 5-7 minutes (per Joy of Cooking), worked great.

Very chocolatey. If not a coffee fan, you can substitute an equal amount of instant cocoa (flavored or not)for the espresso.

Very delicious easy fudge to make. I used Guittard french vanilla chocolate (very velvety) and since my jar of instant espresso powder was as hard as a rock I improvised and used 2 Tbls. very finely pulverized espresso beans because I didn't want to go back to the store. I wish I would have used just 1 Tbls. as the coffee flavor is intense. But all-in-all everyone said it was delicious and I can't stop eating it.

We made this at a baking party over the weekend. It tastes quite good! I highly recommend having everything measured and utensils/bowls, etc. ready to go before you start cooking. Also, you may need to use a sturdy spoon rather than a whisk for combining the milk mixture with the chocolate. Or perhaps ours wasn't at the right temperature or consistency. Regardless, it is tasty and will make nice gifts.

I omitted the espresso powder and the walnuts from this recipe and it still turned out amazing. Very easy, too, compared to other "simple" recipes (like those that add marshmallows). Definitely tastes better than any other chocolate fudge I've had, whether served cold or at room temperature.

This is the best homemade fudge! It turned out creamy smooth and not gritty like some other fudge recipes I've tried. I was in a pinch and used bittersweet chocolate chips (Ghirardelli makes a 60% cacao, available at grocery stores) and sub'd macademia nuts for the walnuts. The espresso was just the right amount as to not overpower the chocolate - it was still a chocolate fudge and not a coffee fudge. I was confident to give this as a yummy gift.

forgot to add that I used a couple teaspoons of strong coffee instead of espresso powder which seemed to work fine.

Fabulous fudge!! It has the texture of a truffle and utterly melts in your mouth. I used half semi sweet chips and half dark choc chips which I think led to a strange liquid that wouldn't mix into the fudge. I left it there when it cooled which made it become crisco-like (and consequently got scraped off). So I would recommend pouring any excess fluid off before cooling. Otherwise absolutely marvelous!

I made this fudge yesterday and it is wonderful. I didn't toast the walnuts to save time but they are still crunchy and flavorful. Very easy to make, it took me less than half an hour start to finish and very little mess to clean up. I used a glass 13x9 pan lined with regular foil and it worked fine. I think I should have cut it a little sooner than recommented, it was definitely set and hard to cut. My only regret was not making a double batch. It seems to be going fast and I haven't even boxed any yet for gift giving!

This is an outstanding recipe and has the foolproof dependability that is the hallmark of Bon Apetit. Follow the recipe and instructions exactly as it is written right down to the candy thermometer. I use a sheet pan and the Reynolds Release aluminum foil with the one non-stick side. Note: It's ALL about the chocolate! I use a brick of Callebaut Belgium bittersweet chocolate. And having made this several times, I substitute about a 1/4 of the bittersweet with unsweetened chocolate, again Callebaut. People RAVE about this dessert and cannot stop eating it-a keeper!!

I made this fudge today and I think it's excellent. I didn't have fat-free evaporated milk (actually I thought it was rather funny to put something fat-free among all of that chocolate, butter, and sugar, etc.) and because I didn't have any evap-milk, I used regular evap. However, (live and learn)..my fudge was greasy, obviously from too much extra fat. I have it chilling on paper towels for the time being. I believe as it chills the extra fat will also absorb into the chocolate too. But, it is excellent and I consider this my favorite fudge recipe.I cooked it to 234F and it has a perfect consistency. Thx Epicurious and Bon Appetit..

Made this recipe yesterday, following it exactly, and the fudge is incredible. Toasting the walnuts gives them great flavor. I'll make this again. Nice for gift-giving.

This was my first time making fudge. The recipe was easy to do. I was having the same problem as the other person which is, it didn't completely get firm enough. I'm not sure where I went wrong.

I haven't made this exact recipe, but it's very similar to the one I have used for years -- just slightly different proportions and the addition of espresso powder. I definitely plan on trying this one soon!! PamelaSanders, the weather could be a big part of why your fudge didn't set, as fudge only likes cool, dry days. If it's too warm and/or humid, it might not harden. Also, make sure you whisk it long enough -- it should be dull, not shiny, when you pour it in the pan, and it should be starting to thicken. You might be surprised at how long you actually have to beat it.

I loved the flavor and followed the directions and even used the candy thermometer and but it didn't ever really get firm enough to cut. Tasted great but looked more like the inside of a truffle. I would make again if I knew what went wrong. Any suggestions?

Made this quickly one afternoon to send with college age child to take back to school. It was a success, room mates at school liked it a lot, leftovers at home went quickly.
