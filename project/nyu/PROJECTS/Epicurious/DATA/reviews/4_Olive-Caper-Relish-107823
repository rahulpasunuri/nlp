This is a great savory relish. Used it with the Parmesan Shortbreads for a great appetiser. Everyone loved it.

Simple and delicious. Consisting of ingredients we always have on hand, I know we'll be making it frequently. Great to use up that extra artisan bread!

We love this with cream cheese on the crackers under the relish. A delicious and VERY popular treat with our guests!

Had to half the recipe as I did not have enough olives but it was still delicious. Rinse well as directed as it's still salty. I used the vinegar & thyme as options. Olive people will love this. Friends at work gobbled it down.

Best if made a day in advance. A nice twist on tapenade. Addictive.
