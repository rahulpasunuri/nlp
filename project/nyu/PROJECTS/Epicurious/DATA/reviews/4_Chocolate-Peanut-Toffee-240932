Follow the directions and you can't go wrong. I'd like to try experimenting with different kinds of nuts, but since I only make this once a year (if people are lucky) I've only used peanuts. This is the PERFECT holiday treat and you will have people raving over its deliciousness. Even if they don't really like chocolate.

I made this recipe based on the reviews and was disappointed in the bitternesss of the chocolate (Ghiradelli chips). I should have realized and used a sweeter milk chocolate chips instead. You have to be patient because it seemes to take forever to reach the correct temperature (I took it slow and stirred constantly so as not to burn) and opted to sprinkle on my finely chopped walnuts after the chocolate was melted on top and spread because there is such a short window period when you pour the mixture onto the sheet and it starts to harden. A whole pound of butter, chocolate, etc. wasted in my opinion.

Made this recipe three times (successfully) for Christmas gifts this season. It was relatively easy and really very delicious. The first time I botched it by not stirring frequently and with the sugar on the bottom of the pan and the butter on top the sugar hardened and I was forced to start over. I used walnuts as I prefer them. I took the suggestion of just spreading them over the pan and that worked great. Also, used Ghiradhelli 60% chips and that made things even easier. I found that the toffee covered a bit more than 3/4 of my rimmed baking sheet when I pored it out but that worked fine. The first successful batch I let it get up to 300 degrees but found the toffee a bit too brown/burned (but still very tasty) so the next batches I went for a deep brown color and about 280 degrees. I used a brush with water to prevent crystals from forming. Also, the first two successful batches I was left with a pan with a badly burned bottom that required steel wool to get clean. The last time I made sure to really scrape the bottom as I stirred, and that worked well. Finally, one batch I forgot to add the salt to my unsalted butter so I finished it with some fleur de sel on top of the chocolate once the chocolate had set a bit. Delicious candy!

This is the only candy I have ever dared to make! I bought my first candy thermometer just for this recipe a couple of years ago. If I can make it without screwing it up, anyone can! It is easy and I LOVE dark chocolate. I don't change a thing (not brave enough). I keep it mostly for myself which is why I have to workout more often around Christmas!

I don't make candy often but I've made this toffee twice without any problems following the recipe as given.Oops! I do cut back the peanuts to two cups. I do brush the side with a pastry brush and water to clean the sugar granules right after the mixture starts boiling.I have used the bittersweet bars and chips and white chocolate. All were terrific. I used both medium and medium high heat with no discernible difference.I do watch the pan until finished and stir fairly often. I think it's a wonderful candy and gave it as a gift this year to friends, family and co-workers.

I've been making this toffee for 20+ years - without the thermometer. Don't mess with the proportions of butter and sugar, it doesn't work. Getting the heat high enough and stirring until golden brown are key. I don't add the nuts to the toffee, I sprinkle them (evenly) on the baking sheet pan and pour the toffee over it which is much easier. The peanuts and good, but after trying almost every nut, found I prefer walnuts, finely chopped. In a pinch, I use chocolate chips since they now come in a variety of cacao percentages. Everyone raves about this toffee and asks for the recipe.

I make 2 batches every Christmas to include in cookie bags for colleagues and neighbors. They like the cookies, but LOVE the toffee. I figured out that I can buy Ghirardelli 70% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips and skip the time-consuming and tedious fine chopping of chocolate. The chips melt quickly on the hot toffee. I use a whole bag for each batch.

Rating: 4
So easy. So amazing to watch it all transform. Just follow exactly, and don't skimp on the butter or sugar- it's a chemical reaction so the proportions need to be right. This will be my 2nd year in a row making it, and the only complaint I have had is that people can't stop eating it!

These turned out perfectly. The timing on cooking the mixture took more like 30 minutes for me, but that could be that I didn't start with the heat very high. Medium-high to Epicurious equals much higher than what I normally cook medium-high at. Once I turned it up a notch, it sped up. I have gas heat. My candy thermometer didn't seem to want to go past 235 degrees, so I just pulled it and watched the liquid carefully. It was ready when the boiling subsided and the color was a deep golden brown, almost brown-sugar color brown, and thick to where it started to harden on the back of the wooden spoon I used to stir it with. When you spread it in the cookie pan, make sure you spread it immediately. It starts to harden right away. I used the back of a flat spatula, which flattened the candy nicely.

super easy. super good. i am not a big peanut fan so i made this with raw pecans and tonight i am trying raw walnuts.

This is delicious, but I wish I would've left out one or maybe even two sticks of butter. Mine has streaks and pools of hardened butter throughout the chocolate, which is very unattractive. I'm debating whether to still give it out as gifts - it looks terrible but it sure does taste good. I'm not sure if I'll try it again, but if I do I'll leave out a significant amount of the butter.

I made this recipe exactly as it's written and the sugar and butter separated towards the 15-minute mark. I was also afraid of burning, so I might have been stirring it too frequently, which could have also contributed to the separation. My second attempt was with salted butter and less stirring, and it came out perfectly. Everyone raved about this toffee; it was a huge hit! So I give it three forks since the recipe didn't work as it was written. Nonetheless, I plan on including this toffee in my Christmas candy platter!

I've been thinking about trying to make toffee forever and I finally got around to it tonight and tried this recipe and I had some extra oil when i poured it into the pan. I let it set for a minute and wiped some of it off with a paper towel before adding the chocolate. It's great. Tastes just like a heath bar! I'm going to wrap them in gold foil and give them as gifts.

this is an easy great recipe for gifts and the holidays. i've made them for christmas the past two years and they go over very well. it is essential that you use a candy thermometer. i also feel that they come out best a few degreed over what they call for. overall, a great and simple recipe.

Loved the ease of this recipe -- didn't use a candy thermometer. Cooked over low-med heat, whisking constantly for 20 minutes until I could see a change in the consistency. Spread on a cookie sheet. Next time will use less sugar and more chocolate (70%). Also substituted almonds for peanuts, and turned our beautifully.

Excellent recipe for the holidays. I've made it two years in a row, and the use of a candy thermometer is essential. Great for giving away as gifts, and can be frozen as a treat to enjoy "later"...I may make more since it's relatively easy and I gave all of the toffee away this year!

I made this recipe and it didn't turn out. I don't know what I did wrong. The sugar and butter boiled and the temp went up to 325. It seemed to harden when I poured the mixture into the baking dish but when it was all finished the toffee was still soft and the sugar still seemed granulated. I hope there's a simple explanation!

Rating: 4
Delicious taste and texture. Followed the recipe with these minor changes: Added 4 T water to the butter/sugar before cooking; stirred constantly over low to medium heat until the mixture (slowly) reached 300; added 2 cups peanuts to the toffee instead of 4. No problems with the butter and sugar separating, and no problem with the chocolate not adhering to the toffee.

To die for!! I did follow the recipe, but lowered the heat as recommended by others. Will make again!!

is this supposed to be rock -hard? then i gotit right! i found myself somehow stressed whisking with one hand unbelivable amounts of butter and sugar- no salt used salted butter, and with the other hand tomato-broccoli diet soup! having no thermometer did not help i guess , neither did not knowing what " golden brown" really means, i stopped when it started looking like sweaty pizza cheese.... guess i have to try again!

Absolutely delicious toffee, but next time I would use toasted almond pieces instead of peanuts. I added 1/4 cup light corn syrup to the sugar and stirred frequently ... the toffee was silky smooth. I was surprised the recipe calls for putting the finished candy in the freezer because freezing ruins chocolate. I did put it in the refrigerator. Worth the effort.

This is a great recipe! I took the advice of those before me and used salted butter and eliminated the salt. I did not have any problems with separation. I was confused as to whether cocktail peanuts were salted or not, roasted or not. I used raw peanuts (unsalted, unroasted) and was happy with the outcome. I used half of the amount of peanuts called for in the recipe; I started with a 13-oz bag, chopped up enough to make 1 cup for the topping, and used the rest to mix into the toffee. Like others have pointed out, the temperature seemed to be climbing at an even steady rate until somewhere in the 200s, and then it seemed like I turned around once and it was already at 325, so be aware that the rate that the temperature rises can suddenly speed up. This was such an easy recipe and I got so many compliments on it, I look forward to making it again.

Rating: 4
I had some great results and then had two batches separate - figured out that the ones that separated used Wegman's store brand butter, while my successes usually used Makers Mark butter in a one pound block from Sam's club. I think there must be a slight variation in moisture, so use high-quality butter if you are having problems with the toffee separating before reaching 300 degrees.

I made this in Dec 2007, and it was so delicious and well received that I do so again this past Christmas. I felt too confident, I suppose, and didn't use the candy thermometer since I wanted to have the ability to stir completely around the sides of the pot, and decided to wait and take a quick reading when the color began to "look right." Mistake. It had a burned taste, will make a gain, but will certainly use the thermometer from the outset. Tasters commented "still good, but not as good as last year."

To lalalalisa from Houston and others who had the chocolate separate from the toffee, I just talked to my friend who makes great toffee and she warned me that she always wipes the excess oil from the butter off the top of the toffee BEFORE she tops with the chocolate for that very reason. Hope this helps.

So far, so good. This recipe turned out great for me, i used toasted pecans instead, since i love pecans. Yum. As for the reviewer below whose friend said this is not toffee, it IS. Toffee should be crunchy and have nuts and is often coated in chocolate. This is pretty much the definition of toffee (and tastes just as good as the stuff you'll buy at sweets shops for $20/pound!). Anything soft is caramel, the midrange is buttercrunch, and the crunchiest is toffee (toffee is actually interchangeable with candies termed 'brittle').

Yummy when it turns out...I made 3 batches, 2 turned out great & 1 was very granular and soft. I addecd the 2 tsp vanilla before the pnuts for great flavor.

I like this recipe and I made it tho someone tried it ans dhe insists its not toffee. Mine is crunchy and not sticky like taffy. I dont have a 300 degree thermometer so I cook mine to 220 thats highest in my thermometer. I add more time and then its very thick and gold color. so what is the texture of toffee? She also says peanuts and the candy is really peanut bar not toffee. So question is What is toffee?

Thanks to all of the reviewers who added helpful info...I too used salted butter, 6T of water, lower heat and 2t vanilla and it turned out great. I also made some changes on my own that turned out pretty well. I used 1 cup of chopped pecans in the toffee and added pecan dust on top. Instead of bittersweet chocolate, I used Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips. Everyone in my family loved it!

What a disaster! I was so excited to try this, but the sugar and butter completely seperated near the end of the 15-20 minutes and it's a completely unusable mess. A total waste of good ingredients. At least I didn't add the nuts before it all went downhill. Boo!

We made this for Christmas. It was one of our 20 different types of cookies that we made.

I have made this twice now, and it came out great. The first time I followed the recipe as written, then the second time, I reduced the butter to 3 sticks plus 2 tbsp, and it was still great with less butter. I use a heavy enameled cast iron pot, which I think helps prevent scorching or having to stir constantly. I did reduce the nuts on top, and I'm wondering what it would come out like to substitute a bit of the butter with some peanut butter?

Very easy to make, will try it with perhaps cashews next time - only for another take on this. The peanuts worked out really well.

I also made this twice with absolutely no problems and to rave reviews from everyone. The third time it separated - the only difference in the way I made it was I used a whisk the first two times and a spatula the last. I'll try it again though. I also made a batch using almonds (Mom's peanut allergy) and it was just as delicious.

I have made this twice and whisked constantly with no separation. It only took 8 minutes to come to 300 degrees and the second time I scorched my pot. I would use lower heat next time. Rave reviews from all my friends. I think I gained 5 lbs heating more than my share.

I made it 2 times with no problems; and then the next three times had problems with separating. The last time that I made it, I had to throw it out - what a mess!! I'm going to take some of the advice from reviewers and keep on medium low heat and stir constantly -- like I did when I first made it. Where I think that I began to have problems was leaving it to "simmer" alone w/o stirring constantly. This is a real tempermental recipe but when it comes out -- ooooh, what a hit!! I gave it as Christmas presents to dozens and dozens of people and each of them just raved!! So, I'm going to try it again right now to take to New Year's Eve tonight!!

Since my first comment I have traveled from my hometown in Michigan to Denver for the holidays. After two perfect recipes in Michigan my first high altitude batch separated. I'll try again using the recommendations of others to lower heat and possibly add a tad of water. Has anyone made altitude adjustments?

I've never made candy of any type but decided to try this. The first time, I used salted butter and had no problems with separating. But, having never used a candy thermometer, I pulled the toffee too soon and it ended up firm instead of crunchy. I figured out that the thermometer was in contact with the pan and registered too high. The 2nd time, I adjusted the thermometer and the results were nearly perfect. I agree with everyone that 2 cups of peanuts is plenty.

This is delicious and very easy to make. I did not have any problems with the butter and sugar separating, as some people did. Never having made toffee before this, I don't know what I did differently that prevented me from having problems. I started with the butter, sugar and salt in a cold pan and then turned the heat to medium high; I also whisked constantly. There was a little burnt toffee on the bottom of the pot, but the finished product didn't taste burnt at all.

I burned this the first time I made it, following the directions to a T. I used some of the tips on this board: adding 6T water, no salt, using salted butter, & adding 2t vanilla before the peanuts & the results were fabulous! A toffee hater in my household was floored by it. I think I figured out the problem with the recipe though, they call for a 4-5 qt. pot & the sugar butter mixture doesn't come up enough to register properly on most clip-on thermometers at least not on mine. I used a 2qt pot second time around & used lower heat & stirred constantly & it turned out great.

Fabulous! Keeping the heat on low and stirring frequently prevented the mixture from separating (although adding considerably to the cooking time). Like other reviewers, I reduced the quantity of whole peanuts to 2 cups and found that perfectly adequate.

This is my second time making this recipe. The first time the butter and sugar separated. I poured off the excess butter and still managed to make a go of it, but thought it lacked richness (that the discarded butter would have given it). I tried it again after doing research on other sites. Taking a few of the sites' suggestions, I kept the temperature low the entire time, and mixed slowly with a rubber spatula. The mixture still separated, so I added 1T of boiling water and also 2T additional sugar. It brought the mixture together beautifully. I also only heated it until 290 degrees, which gives it crunch without sharpness. The second batch was delicious, and everyone devoured it.

I have a gas stove and All-Clad. Don't do Med-High heat, unless you want scorching and 45 minutes of scrubbing your beloved pot. Ready to throw in the towel, I tried again. I reduced heat and stirred pretty regularly, I used salted butter, reduced nuts to a little over 2 c. (4 c. is too much), and added 2 t. vanilla right before nuts. My results were great and I may need to make another batch.

So disappointing! Followed the recipe to the "T" and wasted a lot of great ingredients. The only tiny change I made was to boil a bit over 300 degrees because it was still very yellow/blond. I took it to 310, whisking continually, and was afraid of scorching so I decided to "trust the recipe" and continue as written. What a mistake. I've made other toffee recipes with great success and I should have followed my gut. Although the butter and sugar looked as though they held together and the texture was smooth, the end result was yellow, soft, and tasted like creamed butter and sugar instead of toffee. I couldn't think of way to reinvent or reuse the mess (not even dried out then crumbled on ice cream, which usually works for just about everything) so I ended up throwing the whole mess away.

Rating: 0
Regarding the separation problem: I have not made this recipe, but I have made toffee for years. I have found that bringing it to boil at a lower temperature (medium instead of medium high) and then boiling and stirring at low-medium) prevents it from separating. It takes a little longer,but it is worth it. Best wishes!

Rating: 0
This worked pretty well for me. I'd suggest fewer nuts and cook the toffee a bit longer, to say 325.˚ Mine came out lighter in color than I like my toffees to be. Of course cooking surfaces and burner temp affect this so it may work to trust ones intuition and cook to your preferred finish color anywhere in the 300˚ range. I also used organic cane sugar (organic evaporated cane juice) which is gold in color to begin with and has not had all the molasses removed.Finally, I'm not sure why some people had separation issue, but I do stir mine almost constantly.

I have made a similar recipe for years, but like the cook from Milwaukee, I use 2 t. vanilla, 6 T. water and no salt with SALTED butter. The first time I made this years ago at a lower altitude, it came out great. Since I've moved to Rebo (elev. 4,500 feet), I've had trouble with separation too. Also, I used UNxalted butter and then added salt, and wondered if that did it. Cook to a bit LOWER temperature to adjust for altitude. One tip: if separation occurs, just our off butter, and use anyway. Re-use cooked butter in cookies, but don't re-use for toffee again. It will separate. I have made seven batches already this season. Cook From Reno, NV

I love this recipe. I have made it a few times now, twice it has worked, and once I have had the butter and sugar separate. I think the trick is to not let the butter melt before you add the sugar, and whisk, whisk, whisk. Great for packaging and giving as gifts!

It did not work for me either. I had the same problem, the sugar and butter seperated at 300. I think the temp needs to go a little higher. On the candy thermometer, hard crack is a little higer than 300. I'm going to try this recipe one more time, I hope it works with a little higher tempature.

I was glad to see that someone else failed with this recipe. I thought it may have been the altititude, but my fellow cook was from Atlanta, hmmm. I was blissfully stirring my butter sugar mix (it was about 240 at that time) When WAM the butter separated from the sugar, and it was a greasy glommy mess. I'll never try brittle again. I swear I thought it was the altitude, I'd welcome any advice at heysuey@silverstar.com Thanks

I made this toffee to give away to friends and family for Christmas. The flavor and texture of the candy was excellent! It was also very easy to make if you stir the mixture well and monitor the temperature closely. I really liked the contrast of the bittersweet chocolate with the sweetness of the sugar/peanut mixture. Highly recommended.

This is very good and is a departure from the almond/english toffee combination. I used white sugar and didn't have any problems; you have to keep stirring to prevent it from burning at such a high heat. The toffee is FULL of peanuts; if you want more toffee than peanuts, I would suggest adding a smaller amount. Very good!
