This was an easy weeknight dish. I used more olives, tomatoes and basil so it could be spooned over fish on the plate. Came out well. The only thing I will add next time is garlic. I think garlic will give it that extra kick it is missing and make it more "Provençale".

I was looking for an easy recipe using cod and this is IT! I added more olives and capers as suggested and deglazed the pan with white wine. Had some rainbow chard in the garden, so sauteed it and served the cod over top. Delicious!

Another excellent Epicurious recipe -- so simple, healthy and delicious. I made brown rice as a side dish -- which I won't do again since it kind of took away from the main dish itself. So, I'm still looking for a side to go with it. Excellent dish -- really accentuates the flavor of the fish. Like some of the other reviewers, I added extra olives (6) and some capers which really made the dish.

I added capers to this recipe for some extra flavour and it was delicious. I also used diced tomatoes, skin on, olives and dried herbs as I didn't have fresh and it was still great. Simple but flavourful.

This was delicious, and super easy! I always keep some frozen cod in my freezer so this ended up being a simple but lovely dinner. I added some white wine to the pan as suggested before,highly suggested, and omitted the last 1/2 tbls of olive oil, it just didn't need it. My husband loved it, very flavorful. Will definitely be making again.

I was looking for a simple recipe for cod fish. This recipe was simple and quick. Unfortunately no "wow" effect. The taste was good but not enough for do over.

Should be non-stick skillet. Excellent. a little white wine to deglaze is excellent.

So delicious, fast, simple--can't find a better really light/healthy but such a tasty and flavorful meal! I love white fish, and so this was a great cod recipe--I sauteed two thicker pieces in the oil on both sides before simmering with the olives, tomatoes, and seasoning for about 6-8 min total (b/c of thickness). Used about 8 olives and two regular vine-ripened tomatoes and was just scrumptuous! Put fish and sauce over cous cous as other reviewer said and it was divine. Will definitely make again.

What is a "non-skillet"?

So easy and really delicious. No cod at Whole Foods, so used rockfish instead. I used assorted cherry tomatoes and extra olives and basil. I think good olive oil and fresh herbs are key. Served over sauteed spinach, yum! And super healthy.

I thought this recipe was great. It took almost no time to make and was very delicious! I would agree that it is better with more than 2 olives, though.

A simple ,tasty ,inexpensive meal. Of course we'll have it again. I used more olives and added lemon wedges. Served with boiled new potatoes and a broccoli/cauliflower mix. Think sauteed spinach would be a better choice; next time.

Was so simple to make, being a novice cook. I used more olives than the recipe, about 6, but 3 to 4 would have been sufficient. Definitely would make again

Easy peasy, takes less than 10mins to prepare. I've made this a dozen times and it's always a crowd pleaser. I use cherry tomatoes and tons of olives and spoon the sauces over cous cous.

This dish made me realize that I do not like cod! The sauce was great--so easy, so fresh and flavorful--but even with proper seasoning, the cod remained flavorless, simply a way to deliver the sauce to my mouth.

This dish was absolutely delicous and wonderfully simple. It melted in your mouth, and tasted fresh and delicous...very Mediterranean! I've also used halibut in place of cod...And broiled the fish on occasion to lower the fat content and save the clean up, but it is not quite as good. It is just perfect when prepared as described.

A strong 3 forker. Easy as rolling off a log (and I agree with a previous poster that if good fresh tomatoes aren't available, you should go ahead and use canned). I also used more olives - maybe 6 or 7. It does take longer than the time given in the recipe, but not much. Maybe 10 minutes total cooking time, depending on the thickness of the fish. I used red snapper, and we loved it. Served it with roasted zucchini and garlic, and we felt like we were in the south of France.

Delicious, easy--and quick. I've used this recipe for cod and dover sole. It makes a wonderful dinner. Minced garlic is a good addition and I've used cilantro when basil wasn't handy.

This is one of my husband's favourite meals. I don't peel the tomatoes and I cut them into wedges instead of dice. I pit the olives, but leave them whole. I garnish the dish with lemon wedges. If I make it for more than two people, I arrange the fish on a platter. The red tomatoes, black olives, green herbs and lemons make a very colourful presentation.

The market was out of cod so I made this with sole instead. Everyone raved about it! Simple but flavorful.

VERY tasty enjoyed by all who tried. Have made twice. Once as directed which was pretty darned good and 2nd time tripledtried the vegetable ingredients (not the fish) with one small minced clove of garlic and a bit of sun dried tomato to create a lot of soupy saucy dipping broth. The soupy one was for a rainy sunday and we enjoyed it with salad, crusty bread,wonderful Washington State wine and a lemon blueberry dessert. Perfect. Just can't go wrong with this recipe. Fast, easy, minimal clean up...yum.

I used canned diced tomatoes and green olives,I didn't feel like going to the store. Came out really nice. My boyfriend isn't big on fish, but he said this is a keeper. I served with the asparagus with tomato vinagrette found here, and a salad.

I made this for the first time tonight and now wonder why I waited so long. My family loved it. It's a nice, light dish, tastes delicious, and is so easy to prepare. Served it with rice and a green salad. Will certainly make this again.

This dish was very fast and easy to put together. I did not have fresh basil so I used fresh spinach instead.

A great, delicious, EASY week day meal!! I used canned, chopped tomatoes but fresh herbs and I don't think anything was lost. Fresh, healthy, and quick-- but nice enough to serve guests with a side of good pasta.

This recipe is not worth the trouble. It takes too long and doesn't taste very good

Super easy with great flavor. My husband, not a seafood lover, but an excellent cook, has requested this preparation whenever I suggest fish for dinner lately. He also requests extra kalamata olives to intensify the flavor. The kids think it's good, too.
