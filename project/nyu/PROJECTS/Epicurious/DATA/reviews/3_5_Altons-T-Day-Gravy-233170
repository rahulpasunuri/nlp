To answer my own question 2 posts down - it still works like a champ even if you don't have the best fat cap. I will use this recipe again as it really makes smooth nice gravy and takes away a bit of the crazy time between turkey done and gravy done. I would have given it 3.5 forks if possible. It was a bit salty - but that is my own fault. I think my stock was too salty to begin with. And the flavor was missing a certain something. Next year I might try some white pepper or maybe make some manie made with browned butter to mix in as the schmaltz manie. Oh, and some of the remaining stock is used to supplement if you do not get enough drippings from your turkey.

I make this stock and gravy every year since the recipe was published and my kitchen is known as the turkey gravy Mecca. I always get a buttery cap and always have perfect gravy. And I love that I can make this days in advance. I use the same MO to make vats of chicken stock also.

I have a question and no review yet. Do you need all of the extra stock? I swear I have read the recipe 100 times and don't see any use for the remaining stock after making the manie balls. Also, I got very little fat cap, so I used the gelatinous stock in addition. It seemed very fatty, so I am thinking it will have the same result. Anyone who has made this before have ideas?

I had to go back a few years to re-capture this amazing recipe to give my daughter for her first time hosting Thanksgiving this year. I've made this multiple times, sometimes with turkey wings, sometimes with chicken wings. either way it has come out great every time, with extras left that kept quite well in the freezer.

This is well worth the time. The flavor was incredible and even though is was a little labor intensive ahead of time the gravy itself seemed foolproof, which is very nice in those last few rushed minutes of getting thanksgiving dinner on the table. I also liked that I had complete control over how much gravy I would end up with. No shortages.

I used this recipe twice and both times, it was absolutely delish! The only thing is the fat cap never comes out very firm...its runny and more like an oil. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Fortunately, the flavor is still very good. Any suggestions?

Indeed, this was terrific! I made double the amount and used some for the green bean casserole I made as well. Didn't bother with rolling the manie into balls.

I made this dish as a present for my sister who was cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Although she is an excellent cook the addition of this stock to her gravy made it "the best she had ever made". I am now barred from celebrating Christmas at her house unless I make this again !!

I make a quantity of this and chill it, roll it into balls and throw them in the freezer in a resealable plastic baggie. Then whenever I want to make turkey or chicken gravy I take them out of the freezer as I need them. Don't thaw them, just throw them into the gravy. Flawless every time!

I don't think I'll ever use another method.

It was my first thanksgiving making dinner for the whole family, and I was soo nervous about the gravy. Alton's recipie made a great gravy with a silky texture.

This method totally impressed my dad, who had been bragging about the great gravy he made at his pre-Thanksgiving dinner the weekend before! I don't know why others didn't get a fat cap, I definitely did. Of course, the broth was very gelatinous after refrigerating, so it was a little difficult to tell which part was the fat but I figured it out (it was creamy like butter). I had added a little more water because I had almost 4 lbs of chicken wings. In the end I got 8 cups of stock and about 10 Tbls of fat so I used 10 Tbls of flour and made lots of schmaltz manie balls. I did this the weekend before Thanksgiving so I froze the stock and the balls until T-day. Yum!!! Definitely will do this again.

Best gravy recipe yet. I made the manie with chicken fat, rather than wait for the "cap" to form. And since we were smoking our turkey (and didn't want "smokey" gravy) I used 1+ tablespoon of Better Than Boullion turkey paste. A keeper.

We served this gravy at a Thanksgiving dinner party to great success. I'll be hard pressed not to use this recipe as the foundation for any future gravies. Technically speaking, the schmaltz manie trick was particularly effective at producing a thick, smooth gravy. The flavor was intense and complex.

The stock is great, but no fat cap. I thought it might be because I had to separate my stock into so many containers to cool. I skimmed all the containers, combined all the fat, and had 'something' to work with. I may make a roux after all.

Capless in California too

The resulting stock did not yield a fat "cap." However, I was able to skim about 3 T. of fat off of the cold stock and make the fat and flower mixture. The stock itself is very rich, full of gelatin, and has an appealing dark brown color. I'm sure this will make excellent gravy on Thanksgiving, even if I have to finish thickening it with a traditional beurre manié. I will rate the recipe again after making the gravy.

I agree with the previous reviewer..I followed this recipe exactly and the stock did not develop a "cap" as promised. Would be interested to see if other reviewers felt the same. Lots of time spent with a disappointing result.

I loved the Schmaltz Manie idea but I wasn't too thrilled with everything else. The stock recipe didn't produce the typical "fat cap" you get from other stocks. I'm glad I tried it because I think alton Brown is a genius.
