I don't know much about barbeque but this sauce is damn good on corned beef!

Perfect as is! I'm going to make a larger batch next time to use with other dishes.

i may be jumping the gun a little by saying this recipe is awesome because i only just made the sauce we will have to wait and see how much better it tastes tomorrow. so far i felt like this recipe is very similar to bbq sauce recipes where i am from in south carolina. now i am in france so far away from home and this definitely transports me back to the south.

I really enjoyed this...i added a little more vinegar and used spicy brown mustard and it was excellent

I'd never had a mustard barbecue sauce and wanted to try one. Everyone loved this! I used a local Florida summer wildflower honey that has LOTS of character and was perfect in this. Yum!

I used to get bottled sauce from Maurice's Piggy Park in Columbia,SC when I lived in New Orleans. Now that I live in Kansas City (so-so BBQ compared to Memphis and SC) I like this recipe with more mustard, more hot sauce and some liquid (hickory) smoke. Let it sit awhile...fantastic!

Not an adventurous sauce, but does recall Southern BBQ joints. Tastes good when just made, better when "aged"
