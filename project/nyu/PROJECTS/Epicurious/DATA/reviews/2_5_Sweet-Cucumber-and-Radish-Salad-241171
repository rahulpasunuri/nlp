Pretty good for what it is - just a basic vinegar-brined salad. Try the other brined radish and cucumber salad recipe from gourmet - that one is addictive!

Just OK. I always prefer unseasoned rice vinegar for a dish like this, and use the technique of salting and draining the cukes first. They'll stay crisper.

I thought this was very good, especially for how easy it was to prepare. Great combinations of flavor.

Like others have said, DO NOT make 4 hours in advance. There was a lot of liquid at the bottom after a few hours in the fridge. I'd make again and used more veggies, chives (or onions) and eat sooner than 4 hrs.

I doubled the vegetables, which alleviated the excess dressing problem. Chopped chives were a nice added flavor and color.

I would not make this again. There was a lot of liquid on the bottom after leaving it covered for a few hours and this made the cucumbers very soggy.

It was okay, but I was too crazy over it.

This salad would be much tastier if you do the following: use small israeli cucumbers instead, a bunch of scallions, some fresh dill and for dressing mix equal amounts of mayo and sour cream. Yum!

It's a good salad but definitely cannot be made 4 hours in advance. After only 10 minutes a lot of the water from the cucumber was sitting in the bottom of the salad bowl.
