Really enjoyed this soup tonight. Doubled the amount of cilantro (which I love), rubbed a clove of garlic on the croutons, which added some more kick, and since I used chorizo instead of a spicy sausage (might try something else next time), I think a touch of a green South American hot sauce we had on hand was a nice addition. I also needed to add a little more salt. BTW, don't forget to blend all the ingredients before chilling the soup!

My husband and I both LOVE this soup! I was a bit unsure about the sausage addition, but chopped very very small, it adds nice flavor. The croutons were also wonderful in it. I found it tasted superb on day one, and a bit vinigary on day two--its only drawback.

GREAT SPIN ON AN OLD FAVORITE. USED HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE . ALSO ADDED ONE TABLESPOON EACH OF FRESH LIME AND ORANGE JUICES. PERFECT FOR A WARM EVENING STARTER.
