Light and airy? yes. "Flaky"? No way!(flakiness suggests layers. not a crumbly texture!). These biscuits are crumbly, which makes them only adequate for dishes such as biscuits and gravy or chicken and biscuits(dishes in which the biscuits can taste like crap but work). Ie., these biscuits can't even be cut in half without crumbling. These rave reviews have me scratching my head... I've made much better biscuits with less baking powder (and often added crisco).This recipe yields dry, bland and metallic biscuits. Keep looking!

These were absolutely delicious! We made small biscuits and baked them with one on top of the other. They came out great, but had to cook a couple minutes longer than time listed. Would definitely make again!

OOhh myyyyy GGooddddneess, these turned out aaamazing, way better than any fastfood joint. It was easy to make, everything tasted great. The only thing I had to do was turn my oven up just a little to get it to that golden brown but besides that I give this recipe a 10 on a scale of 1-10. LLOveed it!!!!!

Very easy and very yummy. Froze the butter and shredded it on a box grater for extra cold butter and less handling. Used salted butter and didn't add the salt in the recipe, the result was somewhere between shortbread and biscuit, very pleasant, and great with wine.

Terrific Recipe.....Who knew something so easy to make would taste so delicious. Quick and simple if you use a cuisinart to mix dry ingredients, then the butter soon after. Tried half mix with grated cheese and half regular. Both were terrific. I also reduced the salt and found it just as good. This is a keeper.

Love these biscuits! My fiance and I had a hankering for the biscuits from John O' Groats here in L.A. one night but they were closed. We found this recipe, split it in half, and gobbled them up so fast that we had to make them again the next night! It's a quick and easy recipe... Recommend eating them with good raspberry jam!

Had no time and whipped this biscuits together in such a hurry that I had no idea how they'd be. Used the 1/4 cup measuring cup as a biscuit cutter, literally scooping up, leveling and banging out the measuring cup into my hand to put onto the baking sheet. While they were a bit misshapen, or as I prefer, "rustic", thanks to my unorthodox method, they were wonderful, light and fluffy. I will absolutely make these again and most likely won't change the methodology as the results were so good!

Super easy and much lighter than buttermilk biscuits I've made in the past. My only complaint was that they were a little too salty. When I make them next time I'll probably use 1/2 instead of a full teaspoon of salt.

Rating: 4
really good and pretty fool-proof. I had hardly anything in the house because we're moving out so I used bread flour, some not butter butter thing and a mixture of old sour cream, greek yogurt and milk instead of the other ingredients. The 1c liquid is pretty short I added little bits of milk until I got the consistency I wanted, which was fairly moist and not crumbly as they said in the recipe. I mixed until moist and turned out onto a board and kneaded about 30 secs and rolled dough out folding in half a few times to make flakier. They came out soooooo gooood! Light, flaky and moist. YUM!!!

Rating: 4
These are great! Good for savory dishes and dessert shortcakes. Didn't have time to let frozen butter come to "chilled" temperature so used a food processor and "pulse" setting to blend butter with dry ingredients. Also found 1 cup of buttermilk to be a bit short to pull dough together, so added 2 - 3 tablespoons more until I had a crumbly dough that formed loose mounds. Best ever! Thank you.

These biscuits were perfect - light and fluffy. I made a half recipe, and added a bit extra milk (OK, let's face it, cream) - maybe a tablespoon or two. They were delicious. I made 8 biscuits with a half recipe (didn't use a 1/4 cup measure, just eyeballed it). Will definitely make these again!

I think this is a wonderful effort at creating delicious Buttermilk Biscuits. It's definitely a recipe everyone should try and I would make them again. I didn't rate it "four forks" only because I expected a more intense buttermilk flavor like I get from my grandmother's biscuit recipe. That's just a personal preference. You may find it's perfect exactly as prepared. A TIP FOR MAKING THESE BISCUITS: If you have a large cookie scoop (1 3/4" across) it measures the same as 1/4 cup. Using the scoop will give you uniform sized biscuits. Use a small juice glass to flatten them slightly for a more rounded biscuit. Yield is 16 instead of 12. Bon Appetit!

This is my standard biscuit recipe. I too find that it benefits from more liquid (about 1/4 cup more). Otherwise, I am using too much pressure to keep the biscuits formed.

I've been making these for several years and also find them very short - and add a bit extra buttermilk (an altitude thing I think). I've tried many recipes and think they are the best - even better than my grandmother's famous baking powder biscuits.I like them with the Irish Stew recipe. We also made a double batch and served them with Christmas dinner. We love them with honey and crab apple jam.

Okay, I am a Cook from Brooklyn (I wrote the review below about the biscuits turning out bitter). I just made another batch and they turned out fine. Phew!! I was beginning to think I'd have to retire from my baking career before it even really started in earnest. No idea what happened for the first batch! Fluke??

Rating: 0
Could anyone please explain why my biscuits might have turned out bitter?? They are awful! I've made biscuits for years, but not this specific recipe. Obviously it's something I did since the reviews are so good. I am so choked! One suspicion: I "made" my own buttermilk using a mixture of milk and vinegar. I do this all the time with other recipes. Maybe I didn't let it sit long enough and some sort of chemical reaction that was supposed to happen, didn't?

simple, fast and tasty. I've made them a few times, and they are highly robust to substitutions. I never have buttermilk on hand when I want to make them, so I use 1 1/3 cup milk mixed with 1 1/3T vinegar (apple cider vinegar; I used a bit more milk, following other reviewers' advice). Last time, I used 2/3 milk and 2/3 heavy cream, which made the biscuits a bit richer. I also ran out of baking soda (!), so replaced 1 t baking soda with 2 1/2 t baking powder. Regardless, they are great with chili and will be great tomorrow am with butter and jam.

These are delightful biscuits and the diner is well worth a trip to Boulder. These were a bit too metallic so next time I will decrease the baking powder slightly.

I have also been to Dot's Dinner so I was excited to try the recipe. I loved these biscuits! The recipe is easy, I did end up cooking the biscuits for an additional 5 minutes longer than noted. I only added 1 tsp of sugar which I preferred so they aren't too sweet.

Rating: 4
Having lived in Boulder for 22 years has given me a certain 'attitude' about the altitude when baking. Now, having lived in the Arizona Desert, I can officially claim that these are the world's best biscuits in the over a mile high world and at the lower elevations too! Perfect biscuits!

Rating: 3
These are not the best biscuits I have ever eaten, but they're great. Super simple to whip up spur of the moment on a Sunday morning, they have delicious flavor, a slightly crispy outside and perfectly tender inside. Good with a little butter and jam, or lots of butter and honey! I found that they also freeze well. Definitely add more buttermilk--I used nearly an extra 1/2 cup.

Rating: 2
Well, I was in search of perfect biscuits, and after reading ALL the reviews, taking note of the common corrections (i.e. adding more buttermilk, using a 1/4 cup measuring cup to form the mound of dough) I made these with great expectations. I used fresh made buttermilk, (left from making fresh butter yesterday) and to tell the truth, they were just okay. Not bad, but not great either. I don't detect the texture of flakiness that I was hoping to find. I made sure NOT to overwork my dough, either.But this recipe just didn't "wow" any one of the 6 people who ate them. So I'll continue my quest to find the perfect biscuit recipe. This just isn't it!

Rating: 3
These are tasty, and they're easy, which is a big plus. Like seemingly everyone else who made them, I had to add more buttermilk before the dough would come together. Because they're drop biscuits, they are not what you'd call flaky, but they are light. If you don't let them cool a little before trying to cut them, they crumble.

This recipe turned out better than I expected. I'm a novice cook and found the recipe very easy. I followed the other reviewers by adding a tad more buttermilk than the recipe calls for (a little less than 1/4 cup). As we say in Hawaii, "Da bugga was ono!"

Oh wow!! I have never made biscuits and have always been a little apprehensive as such. I must say this recipe was easy and the results spectacular!!! I made sure I kept everything cold and followed the recipe to the letter except adding more buttermilk to combine. As soon as the dough came together I stopped mixing. I used the trick of flouring a 1/4 c. measuring cup and forming the biscuits in there. They turned out light and fluffy and yummy!!!

I made these biscuits for Easter dinner. They were very light, tender and easy to make. I was hoping they would be flaky, but they were much more airy. I think I need to fold the dough (like a croissant) to get the flakiness I'm looking for. Any suggestions? I did have to use about 1/2 cup more buttermilk than recipe called for. I would definitely make these again. Guests loved them.

Rating: 4
Crispy, golden on the outside and light as a feather on the inside. This is a great recipe! I had to add about a 1/4 C more buttermilk, than the recipe called for. I used homemade baking powder (1/8 C cream of tartar and 1 Tbls. baking soda, sifted together, from April '08 Bon Appetite) and really liked the flavor. I rolled the dough and cut biscuits out, instead of making drop biscuits. I'll try drop biscuits next time!

I'll add my voice to the choir of voices singing praises of this recipe. It turned out exactly as hoped - flaky, buttery and golden brown. We made butter from cream based on the description in the March 2008 Saveur. The biscuits were made with the left over buttermilk. And we used the delicious homemade butter to top the biscuits when they came out of the oven. Bliss!!!

These biscuits have become a staple in my house. I don't care much for sweet biscuits or cornbreads, so I cut the amount of sugar dramatically and like others suggested, added a bit more buttermilk for a wetter dough. I also employed some pie baking techniques, chilling the bowl and all the ingredients. I put the dry ingredients in a large ziplock bag with the cubed butter and rolled on it with a rolling pin so the butter became like paint flakes in the flour mixture. I scraped it all into a chilled bowl and added the buttermilk, using a dough hook on the mixer to blend it all - the light, fluffy and flakey texture is to die for! My suggestion is NOT to halve the recipe, because the cooled biscuits freeze beautifully in individual ziplock bags - nothing will brighten a midweek meal like one of these homemade biscuits!

To me the true testement of any biscuit is if it can be eaten cold and still be enjoyable. These fit that bill. My boyfriend isn't crazy about biscuits but one taste of these and he was hooked. We have decided that if we get into a fight, I'll make these biscuits and staying upset with each other will be virtually impossible. I added a bit more buttermilk and remember to use cold butter. I also kneaded the dough very slightly. Can't wait to have these again. Yum!!

I've made these biscuits twice now, and they are great! So light and fluffy! The second time I only had whole wheat flour in the house and I was afraid it would make them too dense, but they held up great - still moist and fluffy!

Well I never baked biscuits before so I cut the recipe to 1/4. It came out pretty good but there was just one thing that bothered me. It had this weird after-taste.

so good and easy that I made them twice in one day--once witha bunch of 6 year-olds. I added a bit more buttermilk as suggested by previous reviewers. I also pressed them out lightly and cut into squares, which didn't seem to affect the quality. Now I understand what biscuit-love is all about

I have been making these biscuits for 3 years and love 'em. Do not over mix, do not roll out, add 2 tablespoons extra buttermilk and mix til barely mixed. I end up with extra flour that can be worked in with fingers while making biscuits. I don't do the finger thing with the butter,I take a cheap steak knife and slice thin slices into the flour. The trick to tender biscuits is not overworking them. Flour a .25 C measuring cup and lightly press dough into it,plop onto baking sheet. Perfect,flaky biscuits. Biscuits are not supposed to look like what you get from the Pillsbury tubes. I have used regular bmilk,Bulgarian,mixing vinegar with milk and powdered bmilk,all work just fine.

These were great. I can imagine adding a few light ingredients to maintain the integrity of the recipe. For those who find the rubbing of butter tedious, your overdoing it. It should take ten or twenty seconds to incorporate..large chunking means tender biscuits. For those who find them tough..yup you're right..do not roll or handle. That's the point for any cookie or biscuit that is meant to be baked by "dropping"-otherwise find a "rolled" recipe.

I've noticed that all the reviews so far add more buttermilk to this recipe. I also notice that all those reviews come from places NOT at altitude. I live a short distance from Boulder, whence this recipe originates, and thusly the quantities given provided me with a superior biscuit. A good rule of thumb when baking is to consider whether the quantities listed are for those at altitude or at sea level; those of us around a mile high know that usually we have to adjust several factors in recipes to compensate for our altitude...it was rather interesting to see the reverse position shown here in the reviews thus far...

Best tasting buttermilk biscuits I ever made. I did have to add a little more buttermilk than the reciped stated (maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons) in order for the dough to stick together enough to drop on the baking sheet. Hot, buttery with a little honey....mmmm! Better than sex...no, but pretty close!

These did not turn out light and flaky at all. They barely rose in the oven at all. I did roll and use a biscuit cutter to make a better presentation for company. Rolling might have altered the end result because of the extra working of the dough. I'll look for a recipe that calls for rolling the dough.

I had such high hopes for these, but I was sorely disappointed. The texture was o.k., kind of rich and cakey on the inside and crisp on the outside, but they were not light and flakey at all. Also, they were EXTREMELY bland. I mean ZERO flavor. Not even slathering them in butter helped. I was hoping for a Popeye's or KFC style biscuit, but this wasn't it. Maybe I'm just so used to my light and fluffy Bisquick biscuits that my taste has gone haywire. Or maybe I should just run out and get a bucket of chicken and biscuits and call it a day.

I've been making my beloved baking powder biscuits for over 35 years (blue ribbon winners at the county fair) and I have to say that these are the absolute best biscuits I have ever tasted - better than my old ones! The only change I made to them was that I bumped up the salt a little to a total of 1-1/2 teaspoons. I don't care for the appearance of drop biscuits, so I added just a little more flour, gently pressed them out on a floured board and cut them out with a biscuit cutter. I brushed them with butter before baking. They were DIVINE. I will never go back to my other biscuits!

We just gave up Bisquick (due to trans fats) so I bought a pound of lard to make "real" biscuits. Then I found this great sounding recipe--but it called for butter.

The only biscuits I've made before are from a tube or a box. I thought this recipe would convince me that boxes and tubes are a mistake. I was very surprised when I discovered just the opposite. These tasted no better than Biquick biscuits and were significantly more work. I would not make these again and would be hesitant to stray from the ease of the Pillsbury tube-O-dough any time soon.

I added a little more buttermilk than called for, and these came out perfect.

The best biscuit I have ever made, without a doubt. Better than the other buttermilk biscuit recipies on this website. I rolled and cut them and they were tasty and pretty enough to serve with brunch.

Easily the best buttermilk biscuits I've ever makde (and we've tried a bunch). Crispy bottoms, light fluffy insides - perfect. I rolled them to 1/2 inch and cut them into rounds and they rose beautifully. Woke up this morning, and my four year old asked me if we were making biscuits again - yup! These are great breakfast biscuits, but they would also make great biscuits and gravy.

I have to admit I used 1/3cup more of buttermilk than the recipe calls for but it was by far the best recipe I've tried so far. I'm a pastry chef by trade, I made then for brunch that was attended by pastry chefs and all said they were great.

I used milk with some lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk as I always do when a recipe calls for buttermilk, and found this biscuit to be very fluffy inside, and cripy on the outside. Definitely a keeper!

Yum,yum,yum,yum,yum! I think I will roll and cut them next time.

Thanks for all your tips! I cheated! I used my Cuisinart to quickly pulse the butter and flour mix. I used it only to just barely mix the butter and flour and finished the rest with a pastry cutter. It made it so easy and quick. Bake on parchment paper and a double thick professional sheetpan for a nice golden finish. Mix up a sweet butter and honey mix and slather it on the warm biscuits. YUM! I serverd these with roasted red pepper and tomato soup. It was all fantastic. Oh, I ate three in one sitting. Who wouldn't?!

I've made countless biscuit recipes, and this is truly one of the best I've ever had. The flavor is perfectly balanced and the texture is light and tender. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the presentation - being drop biscuits, they're not the most attractive things in the world but OH MY - the taste! I've since made them again, pressing them out lightly to about 1/2" and cutting out with a biscuit cutter - superb.

Incredible, these will spoil you to all others, including restaurant breads. They are a little messy to assemble & keep together on cooking sheet, but don't let that deter you from making them. Also, let them bake long enough for their little lumps to turn a very nice warm golden color, because this tastes SO DELICIOUS. I've made them lots, yum, yum, yum.

I haven't made these yet, but has anyone made the dough ahead of time and baked them a few hours later?

My first time to make biscuits and they came out perfect. I took the advice to use cake flour. I also blended the butter with the dry ingredients the night before, covered the bowl with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge. The next morning I added the buttermilk and dipped out dough with 1/4 cup. Scrumptious!

This recipe has become a family standard for us. Great biscuits - light and fluffy instead, crunchy outside. I serve them with the spicy oven fried chicken and get rave reviews every time. I also use my food processor to blend the dry ingredients then to blend in the butter and then the buttermilk. So easy!!

Excellent little recipe. The biscuits are totally scrumptious. They don't need anything further to make them totally delicious, just eat them as is. I have used them with home made beef stew. To make the biscuits, I recommend well chilled unsalted Land of Lakes sweet cream butter. I also used my food processor to incorporate the chilled butter into the flour with great results. Incorporating the butter with your hands tends to take the chill off the butter. The recipe just takes 10 minutes to prepare and 15 to bake, can't beat it. Sole caution, I calculate about 250 calories per small biscuit. A prudent person does not eat more than one of these a meal, and then only once a day.

This recipe is great! I got it to finish off some buttermilk, and it's heavenly... soft and flaky on the inside, and crunchy on the ouside. I used a pastry blender instead of my fingers and the butter probably didn't melt enough... after adding the buttermilk, it was still crumbly and wouldn't hold together so I put more buttermilk in. They turned out delicious. And the recipe is even a little forgetting--I forgot the second pan in the oven and instead of turning black right away, they just turned a deeper golden brown all over. And still tasted great! Whew!

This was really really good. Light and airy on the inside and a soft crunch on the outside. We liked it so much that I doubled the recipe the second time around and froze all the extra pre-baked biscuits for future meals. This recipe replaced the frozen biscuit packages that you can buy in the store.

As others said, I made these to use up some buttermilk and found the recipe to be easy and delicious. My family loved the biscuits and want them again tonight. I'd also like to know if you can make the batter ahead of time.

Quick and easy. I made these during a snow storm after I ran out of eggs. The baking powder amount does seem a bit high so I'm going to try reducing it slightly next time. I also used, 1 1/4 cup butter instead of the full amount called for in the recipe. Tender and delicious.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I have a question for those who have--can the dough be made ahead (the day before) and refrigerated until use? Thanks.

These biscuits were a hit at breakfast, so light and full of flavor, and not rolling pin required. The measurements were perfect. Yummy!

I made these last night for a dinner party of ten. I, too, had to add a little more buttermilk, and then I covered the dough with Saran until time to bake. I used my ice cream scoop (1/4 cup) for 14 lovely biscuits. Our guests asked for seconds....oops, no more!! Delicious, and served with softened butter and homemade raspberry freezer jam - yum!!!

This was the first time I made buttermilk biscuits and they turned out well. The only problem was that it didn't have enough liquid to hold it together so I added more buttermilk. I will definitely make these again instead of buying dinner rolls.

These biscuits are amazing! I didn't roll them out and just dropped them onto the baking sheet and they turned out great. These biscuits remind me of Popeyes biscuits. I wanted to use up some buttermilk I had leftover from the holidays and now I will buy buttermilk just to make these (similar to another reviewer). These are going to be reserved for special occasions because they are so high in fat but they are so good.

Great recipe. I dropped them on my pan by using a small ice cream scoop. We ate them w/ stew for dinner. They didn't need anything else, they were so buttery. Will use this recipe again and will experiment. Chives would be a good addition and I'll roll them next time to get a neater look.

The first time I used epicurious.com I didn't think that I would ever post a review, but the site and especially the reviews have been so useful that I am thrilled to contribute. This recipe is delicious, easy and fast. I have absolutely no complaints. I made these biscuits last week and I am making them again tonight. A great recipe!

Amazing. So so good, so so easy. I made half of the dough drop-biscuit style, as per the recipe, and the other half by rolling the dough out and using a round press -- the rolled out ones turned out equally as flaky and delicious as the dropped ones, and looked much nicer. Make sure to brush the tops with melted butter!

Made for breakfast, but find they would make an ever better dinner roll! Served with honey. Light texture - quite buttery.

SO easy... I'm not a gormet cook, but these did well for me nonetheless. I didn't have butter on hand and used shortening instead. It still turned out very well.

Rating: 4
These are the best, most moist, easiest-to-make biscuits I have ever made. The first time I tried this recipe, I used white shortening (didn't have enough butter)... well, let me save you some time... do NOT bother using shortening! BLECH! But, made with unsalted butter (as called for)... YOWZA! This recipe is definitely going into my "regular" file. I would caution you against rolling them out, or even rolling them between your palms... I've found that even slightly over-handling the dough makes it far too elastic and the final look was not pleasing. The second time I tried the recipe (with unsalted butter), I used a 1/4 cup dry measure as a scoop, packing the batter into the cup (as one would do to measure brown sugar), then "wiggled" them out and placed them on the cookie sheet, avoiding patting them, or otherwise further over-handling them. They come out a bit mis-shapened, but sooooo good!!! Originally, I tried this recipe as a simple way to use up extra buttermilk, but now I might buy buttermilk just to make these wonderful treats. YUM!!!

This is the very best biscuit recipe I have ever tried! I followed the recipe as it is except that I brushed melted butter on the biscuits both before they went in the oven and after they came out. Everyone I serve them to says they are the best they've ever had. Definately a "keeper."

This is an amazing recipe - the perfect biscuits! Very light and fluffy. For those who haven't made biscuits before, instead of using fingertips to work butter into flour mixture, I like to use a pastry cutter or fork. This keeps the butter from melting in your hands. The key to the best biscuits is to have to butter very, very evenly mixed into the flour creating a course meal. Enjoy!

These biscuits were just wonderful. There's something so fun about mushing all the butter in with your fingers, then seeing a perfectly baked biscuit a few minutes later! I will definitely be making these again.

Fantastic buttermilk biscuits! I substituted Nucoa stick margarine for the butter, (and didn't use the full 3/4 c.) but these still came out nice and flaky. Will definitely make them again. Re: Presentation. I shaped the dough a little before placing on the baking sheets, instead of just dropping them. Note: For those who don't have any buttermilk on hand, it's easy to make your own. Add about 1 TBS. lemon juice or vinegar to 1c. milk or soymilk, and stir. Let sit for a few minutes, and proceed. Enjoy! : )

These biscuits were delicious. I made the first batch following the directions exactly and the biscuits were good, but not great. For the second batch, I brushed melted butter on top of the biscuits halfway through the baking time and they came out fantastic! Will definitely make again.

I just finishe baking these. Right out of the oven these are great! It's not too doughy, very flaky. I didn't use as much butter as it called for, only 1 stick plus a tablespoon, it still turned out great. I tried some plain and some with raspberry jam, both excellent.

I found this recipe while searching for something to use my leftover buttermilk for, and I was not disappointed! It was so easy, and they came out SO good! I took the advice from the Cook from Arlington, VA and blended everything (except for the buttermilk) in the food prcoessor, then added the buttermilk and blended by hand. I think I made them a tad too big cause they turned out looking more like scones, but they were delicious nonetheless! My only complaint was that they were a BIT too crumbly, but other than that I will definitely make them again!

(I am NOT an expert on biscuits.) The texture was perfect, but I thought these were too buttery and not salty enough. Also, I found I needed to increase the baking time somewhat. BTW, rubbing chilled butter into flour is a more time-consuming task than I expected. Finally, I agree with the reviewer who commented about the weak visual presentation of drop biscuits. After dropping them on the sheet, consider rolling them in your palm and then shaping them as desired.
