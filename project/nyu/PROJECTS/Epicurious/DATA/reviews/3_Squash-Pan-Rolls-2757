These rolls are fantastic. Every time I've made them they've come out fluffy and moist - they have an incredible springy texture and a subtle sweet flavor from the squash. Not sure why my experience is so different from others - I've used both canned pumpkin and fresh butternut to the same effect. I do cut way down on the butter baths to avoid the greasiness.

Disappointing. I should of listened to the other negative reviews. The dough looked nice enough and was easy to work with. That said, the rolls were bland tasting, small, dry nuggets. Not worth the effort or the calories. I decided not to serve them to my Thanksgiving day guests.

These were great, I used a whole cup of squash puree, but didn't taste it much. I still like this and will make again!

I last made these delicious rolls years ago when the recipe first appeared in the magazine. They were a hit at dinner and everyone raved about them. I finally remembered them again for this year, and will do as the previous cook suggested by doubling the recipe and making them larger. Also, I used pumpkin, made them a day or two ahead, and froze them. They are a real treat and we look forward to enjoying them again this year!

I have been making these rolls for a number of years now. Of all the Thanksgiving side dishes I have made, this is the one my family makes sure I don't forget. I have interchanged the squash with sweet potato and pumpkin and they always come out fantastic. They seem a bit sticky, but I cut them on a floured board and they rise to perfection. True, the recipe makes them come out a tad too small, so I make two 8" pans with 9 each. I have doubled the recipe and done the same which made huge rolls, but hey! Let's save some room for the turkey! My family has grown larger and this year I made all three versions and they were made ahead and put in the freezer. I now have them thawed and ready to be warmed when the turkey comes out. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

I paid attention to the comments made earlier and added about a cup of wheat flour. This helped to hold it all together because it was too moist (too much milk). Everyone loved it. Pureed and froze the rest of my squash to try it again for Thanksgiving.

I wasn't as wowed with these as I expected to be. Seemed a bit bland; maybe instead of brushing extra butter atop the rolls, have some small pats of butter to put inside the rolls once they come out of the oven.

Don't think these rolls are worth the effort - too small, too dry inside and too greasy on top. Edible, but not much else.

This was a great dish. The squash gave a lovely golden color to the rolls. I also used more squash than the recipe indicated. I made this for thanksgiving and the guests loved them.

Made them for Thansgiving dinner - everyone loved, them including two picky adult children - who wolfed them down until they discovered they were made with squash! I am still laughing and still making them - just not inviting the "picky ones" . So easy to make and freeze ahead - what a live saver when preparing Turkey dinner for up to 25!!

These were, as previous reviewers said, kinda tiny. They also weren't as moist as I would have liked. I'll try making them again, only bigger, and with 1 cup of squash instead of 1/2. The recipe certainly couldn't be easier.

Like Sherrell in TX, I made these years ago for Thanksgiving and lost the recipe. My familly and friends loved them! I am also glad to have found it. They are a wonderful addition to any fall/winter meal, and very easy. They are indeed a bit small, but the recipe can easily be doubled and baking time adjusted for larger rolls.

I made these rolls years ago and had lost the recipe. They were such a hit, I made pans of them and wrapped in clear wrap, with a red ribbon on it, I gave them to friends for Christmas, receiving rave reviews. Happy to find this prize again. Thanks

I have to say I'm a bit confused by the NJ and WA reviews. These rolls were some of the most tender, sweet and colorful rolls I've ever had. The recipe isn't difficult. Everyone at the party raved about their quality. Thanksgiving was a bit better because of them. Make these rolls!

Yes, I have to agree they were a bit ho-hum. Ideally, I think squash rolls should be softer and moister than these were. I also would have preferred a sweeter squash flavor, but these rolls were really too salty to let the sweetness of the squash come through. Made as directed, they were also a bit tiny. Not that I'm someone who thinks everything needs to be supersize -- I believe in normal portion sizes -- these were just kind of ridiculously small. I wonder if all that salt kept them from rising to their full potential. Overall, I wouldn't bother with this recipe.

I love squash rolls; I make a big batch every fall/winter and keep them in the freezer for quick soup dinners or to serve with porkchops. I thought it would be nice to find a quicker, easier recipe than my traditional day-long squash roll experience, but, alas, this was not it. Besides being too salty (which can be fixed) they are, well just not interesting.

I left the dough in the food processor too long and they still turned out great. Will make again soon!

These rolls are delicious. I changed the preparation slightly. I accidentally added all 5 T of butter to the mix but that didn't affect the outcome. Everything was prepared in my bread machine on the dough cycle and I added dough relaxer. The only time I brushed butter on the rolls was after they came out of the oven. The rolls are great, easy and the color is beautiful.

These rolls are the best we've ever had. At first, I was afraid they would taste too much like squash, but we didn't taste it at all. The color of the rolls is beautiful and they taste wonderfully buttery.

The flavor of the rolls is good. Nice accompanyment with turkey. Way too much butter brushed on top of rolls. Very greasy and overwhelming. Cut this down significantly and they're nice.
