I have made these a few times and always have received rave reviews. Each time I have added a layer chocolate chips to the base after it bakes and it is still hot. After a few minutes I spread out the melted chips over the surface and continue with the recipe. I have never made the recipe without the chocolate layer so I cannot comment on the original recipe. The bars with the chocolate layer are wonderful and get even better the next day. Enjoy.

I, too, found there wasn't enough base to cover the pan, and now use the hot shortbread base on this site. I also add raspberry jam between the base and coconut. I have made this recipe many times for friends and restaurant functions.

this recipe deeply dissapoints, especially after all the other good reviews. the crust was yummy before adding the coconut mixture, but after cooking, it just blended in and became sort od pasty and flavorless. the coconut topping was neither chewy and dry like a macaroon NOR wet and custardy like coconut pie...it was inbetween and boring. if you make this, i highly suggest adding a layer of chocolate between shortbread and coconut layers so you have something going on.

These were excellent. I followed other's advice and used 2T cream in the shortbread and 9oz unsweetened coconut. Instead of chocolate, I added a layer of raspberry jam (about 1/2 cup) on top of the cooked shortbread. It was delicious. I also thought (like a previous reviewer) that it seemed there was not enough dough to cover the bottom of the pan. Next time I might try to 1.5x the shortbread part of the recipe.

Yummy! I followed others' suggestions and used a bit more coconut and added 1/2 T. more cream. I also added a thin layer of melted bittersweet chocolate onto the baked shortbread crust before spreading the coconut. I agree that this is a very sweet dessert, therefore I just cut them into small squares. They are a good addition to a plate of assorted candies and cookies.

i followed the other reviews advice and added extra cream, also after the crust had set i added a layer of bittersweet chocolate then the coconut mixture, however i used double the amount of coconut than what was called for. and in the last few mins i added some more chocolate to the top. my only suggestion to others would be that if u could find unsweetend coconut u may want to use it because it will be very sweet

I was so disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews. These were pretty blah in my and my husband's opinion. I didn't have a metal pan the right size so I used a pyrex dish. Perhaps that was the problem. I tasted the shortbread base when it came out of the oven because it looked funny - like it would crumble into a million pieces, but it was yummy and perfectly done. When I put it back in the oven with the coconut mix, of course it overcooked and became dry and flavorless. I kept thinking that they just needed something - lemon, orange, contreau? I made them for a shower and they hardly were touched (unlike the flourless peanut butter cookies I made from this site which went in minutes). I love coconut, but next time I'll try something else.

This is a delicious and easy dessert. Like other reviewers, I used 2 tablespoons whipping cream, 9oz coconut and 1/4 tsp coconut extract. I have made this 3 times already and get rave reviews. A must try !!

Excellent and easy! Even people who didn't like coconut were eating them!

These were so delicious and easy to prepare! We could not stop eating them. The only changes I made were: used 2 tablespoons milk instead of whipping cream, 9 oz of coconut instead of 7 and added a 1/4 tsp coconut extract. Incredible! I'd like to try them again with the addition of sliced almonds ... cant' wait

These bars were delicious! I brought them to work and they were gone before lunchtime. After reading the other reviews, I added one additional tablespoon of whipping cream to the shortbread crust and I did not find them to be crumbly at all. I also added a semi-sweet chocolate drizzle across the tops of the bars, which gave them extra eye-appeal and a nice bonus taste. I plan on making these bars often.

I used unsweetened coconut flakes in this recipe and it was really delicious...not too sweet..and it looked very pretty too.

Excellent recipe. The dough was difficult to pat down in the pan and it seemed as though there was not enough dough to cover the pan. Try using a small butter knife to spread the dough in the pan. As the butter softens, the dough is easier to spread.

These were a hit. They looked beautiful and the smell as they were baking was incredible. I found the shortbread to be a little sticky and had a little trouble pressing it into the pan. Perhaps my butter was too warm? After baking, the crust was a little crumbly as well. A little messy to eat, but still wonderful. I increased the coconut by accident, but they were still fantastic. Next time I might spread a thin layer of chocolate onto the hot shortbread crust before adding the coconut topping. Yum!

These were delicious...served at a party and were a hit. The only addition I made was to add sliced almonds to the top...halfway through baking, so they wouldn't burn. A nice addition.

I am not a fan of coconut, but my boyfriend and sister-in-law are, and both loved this recipe. It is easy to make; I found that the bars needed more cooking time than the recipe specified.
