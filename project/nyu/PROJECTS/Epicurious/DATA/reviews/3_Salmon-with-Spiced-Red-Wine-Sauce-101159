Good and tasty. Easy to prepare. Nothing amazing however.

I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the reduction, and it turned out brilliant. It's sort of an odd color for salmon, but it looked lovely against the green beans.

In addition to way too much pepper in the recipe, even when halved, not much flavor enhancement beyond the salmon flavor. One prior reviewer thought this was a joke. I can't blame him for thinking so.

The amount of pepper even halved when I made it ruined a perfectly good filet of salmon!

My boyfriend isn't a fan of salmon but LOVED this recipe. Says it was better than anything he could ever get in a restaraunt. I can't wait to make it for my mom, a salmon lover.

I took the initiative to halve the amount of pepper and it still was quite intense at first. After tasting the sauce with the salmon I felt that the flavors became more balanced. The recipe is fine for a quick meal but I would try adding some soy sauce next time for a bit more complexity.

Absolutely delicious and very simple, made with a California pinot noir.

What is this? A joke? Crazy...

Maybe I'm missing something, but I thought this recipe was blah. While the salmon was moist and juicy, the sauce did absolutely nothing to enhance the flavor of the salmon. In fact, it wasn't flavorful at all. Would definitely not make this again.

I have made this several times, all for different people, most not big on Salmon, and was a hit! Friends always ask me to make this for them! Used a quality Syrah, was amazing!

Visually, I was put off a bit because of the "blood red" color - for beef, yes; for salmon, not really a plus (unless it;s sushi!). The flavor was ok - I'm a big fan of ginger root! Even though it was a very easy dish to prepare, I think I'd rather spend my time exploring other recipes.

Don't know why this recipe has such as low re-make rating.I tried it because I didn't really have much in the house, and this recipe requires almost no ingredients and no time. My summary: Super quick to make, and tastes excellent, and is recommended.

I've made this a few times now. I agree with one reviewer who cut the pepper down 25%. Not only is this easy and yummy, it's unusual. Something you can make for company who like a little heat in their meals.

It was a great dish non-fish lovers, my husband loved this dish, he's always asking for it.

Simple dish. Wonderful taste. I will reduce pepper to 1 1/2 tablespoons when I retry the dish. The purple/red color also adds visual stimulation when combined with the greens of your vegetable of choice.

The sauce was good. The fish was good, but somehow they didn't work together. The red wine sauce seemed more appropriate for beef or maybe lamb. I halved the the pepper and it was about right. There are better salmon recipes and better meat sauces so I won't make this again.

The dish was delicious, however with a bit less pepper,it might have brought out the taste of the ginger and garlic better. I'll try it that way a gain next week.

This dish is fantastic. It is a great change of pace for salmon- something different than broiling or grilling. My wife and I love spicy food, so I disagree with some of the other reviews that say to reduce the amount of black pepper. It is quite easy to make and really is delicious.

Simple and delicious. Loved it and will definitely make it again. Perfect choice for a weeknight when you want good food fast.

I think this recipe is delicious and it always receives many a compliment. I use a peppery/spicy wine, such as a zinfandel for the sauce. True, the sauce is purple, but I think it looks stricking alongside the fish and a green vegetable, such as sauteed spinach or asparagus.

I halved the recipe and the sauce came out too bitter, although the fish was fine. Unfortunately, this recipe did not impress me.

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't put as much ginger, garlic or cruched black peppercorns as the recipe suggested, and it was fantastic. I also carmelized some onions and added them to the reduced red wine sauce just before topping the salmon. Great addition. I recommend it!

My husband was crazy about this! I'm not a seasoned cook, but it was really easy for me to make. True, the ginger is a little strong. Maybe next time I will use just a little less, but I'm definitely making this one again!

I thought this was awful too. The pepper was totally overwhelming and the purple color unappetizing.

Rating: 1
I realize I am in the minority, however I thought this was awful. My instincts told me to halve the pepper and I wish I had. It was way too spicy, and it's not that I don't like spicy foods because I do. The spice was gratuitous here. It overpowered the fish, and other ingredients. For example, the ginger was indiscernable. Also, the wine turned the salmon an unappetizing shade of purple during the simmering. If you do make this, use less pepper; you can always add more at the end of the reduction.
