Good flavor and an easy, mostly do-ahead dish. Makes a nice, rustic presentation too. Agree with the first poster that 2 TBSPs salt must be an error, it is too salty (and I used scant tablespoons), will cut it in half next time. But would certainly make it again.

This is an outstanding recipe; it is not too much work that can even be done in advance. So, if you intend to invite guests or want to have prime time with your family, it is perfect. BUT: The 2 tablespoons of salt you cover the meat with must be a typo! Try much less, 2 TSP for example!
