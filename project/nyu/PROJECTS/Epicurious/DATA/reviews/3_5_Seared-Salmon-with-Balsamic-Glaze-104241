This is one of my husband's favorites. The vinegar glaze is a flavorful contrast to the richness of the salmon and the crispy skin is a real treat. My one complaint is that the high heat cooking of fatty salmon makes a real mess in the kitchen and "perfumes" the air for some time. I now do this dish exclusively on a griddle on the side burner of my gas grill. The sauce gets made inside on the stove in a preheated pan somewtimes with butter, sometimes without.

very nice mix--i always cut into skin "ala Ramsay" to add crispness but no changes required

Delish! Great quick weeknight meal. I made this with the lemon, rosemary orzo pilaf from this site. When you're lucky enough to live in Seattle, you can even use primo salmon without guilt. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe more times than I care to admit. Usually I follow it to the letter and it comes out perfect every time. Last night I decided mess with perfection and made the glaze in a small saucepan. It took much longer to reduce of course because the pan was smaller and started out cold. Also, because there was no oil in the saucepan it required a pat of butter at the end. I think that the glaze tastes much better and is much easier if you just follow the recipe as stated. I am wondering if that is where the majority of the issues with the recipe are coming from? I do agree that if you have paid a premium and have actual wild caught salmon that you should not serve them in this sauce. However, this recipe is a great way to elevate a lesser piece of fish.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Don't touch the salmon until the 4 minutes is up and make sure the pan is hot enough when you add the sauce. Those who said it took much longer to reduce may not have had a large enough surface area or it wasn't hot enough. The only change I made was to substitute white wine for the water. Will definitely make again but it's a good thing I have an extra stove in my basement because this really does stink up your house.

This was fast and good; I too added a big pat of butter at end and found it took about four or five minutes for glaze to boil down. Great weekday recipe. Sandra McNally Calgary, AB, Canada

This sauce was way too sweet for our tastes. I drizzled it around the plate in case we didn't like it. Seared sockeye salmon is just so delicious, it doesn't need this much adornment.

Rating: 1
My husband and I made the full amount of glaze but only half the amount of salmon. We reduced the glaze to about 2 tablespoons, rather than 1/3 cup. Neither of us cared for the glaze. When I told my husband that some reviewers had subbed red wine for the water and had used butter in the end, he commented that those changes would help but still probably wouldn't overcome what we both thought was an uninteresting, "vinegar-y" taste.

Rating: 2
I liked the flavor of this glaze a lot, but it is pretty strong; it really overpowered the taste of our salmon. If salmon is inexpensive where you live or your piece isn't particularly high quality, this recipe is fine, but when I've splurged on fresh wild salmon and really want to taste it, I prefer the more subtle recipes for Saumon aux Lentilles or salmon with maple-mustard sauce, both on this site.

Rating: 4
I have been preparing this recipe since it published and it is a staple in my kitchen. Make the full amount of glaze even if preparing salmon for two and reduce sufficiently to give it a nice silky texture. Be aware thet any glaze left in the pan will continue to thicken off the heat to a syrupy consistency. I serve this with white and brown basmati rice which goes nicely with the glaze. I have also found that the glaze can be prepared separately in a saucepan and used with chicken, pork chops and even roasted vegetables.

This is a staple in our household. It is one of my boyfriend's favorite recipes- and its SO easy! Only thing to note is that the salmon takes longer to cook than the recipe says. Healthy and delicious!!

I've made this meal so many times. . . and everyone loves it. I find that I get bored with Salmon and can never figure out how to serve it to a large crowd. With this recipe, I have actually barbequed the salmon and made the glaze in a separate pan, pored it over the platter of salmon and sprinkled with parsley. To dsonntag from Palm Springs - try it on a bed of lentils cooked with maripaux of leeks, carrots, celery, thyme, salt pepper, tomato paste and a touch of basalmic, or roasted vegetables (butternut squash, peppers, carrots, shallots, zuchhini - cut in cubes about the size of a nickle, sprinkle with olive oil, salt, pepper, til firm but tender) mixed with coucous seasoned with salt & pepper, cumin, etc. . . roasted asparagus on the side

Rating: 3
Great, fast recipe--I followed the directions pretty closely--pan searing the salmon gave it a nice brown crust. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a small pat of butter to the glaze--it does make the consistency smoother, and it seemed to have helped with the thickening. The thickening step still took longer than two minutes--I think it was about four minutes. Quick elegant recipe--will definitely make again

Rating: 4
The key to this recipe is a beautiful fresh piece of salmon. My boyfriend made this easy and delicious recipe on his night to cook. He's not very comfy in the kitchen, but he loved making this and the end product was SO good. The brown sugar glaze provides the perfect texture balance to the soft fish and the sweetness is cut by the lemon juice. Will make again soon.

I absolutely love this recipe! I am not a fan of recipes that make you run out to the grocery store to buy a list of 20 things you don't have in your pantry.

Wow! So easy and great to impress guests. Make sure your pan is hot! in order to sear and thicken sauce. I wasn't sure what to put it on or with, but I definitely do NOT recommend whole wheat pasta. I think I'd like to try broccoli rabe or asparagus. Suggestions?

Fabulous way to cook salmon. If done right, it is crusty and brown on the outside, while maintaining a very moist center. I have't had a problem with the balsamic glaze thickening at all. Maybe I'm using a higher temperature, but it bubbles away while the salmon is resting and I'm finishing up a quick side salad. Our favorite way to cook salmon. And the easiest.

I am stunned by the failure of this recipe. I have subscribed to Gourmet since 1989 and am an experienced home cook. thissauce never thickened for me and in fact came apart on the plate. Can't think what i could have done wrong but I note that others had the same problem. I should have noted their warning.

The glaze doesn't thicken for me (maybe I'm not patient enough) but that is okay...still wonderful. My advice is not to bother with the searing. Just bake it in the oven (450) until almost done then throw it under the broiler to brown a bit. I also recommend doubling the glaze for 4 servings. A++++++

Great dish...did not use high heat but cooked fish on med high heat thus eleminating the problem of a smokey kicthen and the glaze being to thick I actually added corn starch to thicken. I then poured off any remaining oil from the pan after cooking the salmon and wiped the pan with a paper towel before preparing the glaze so the glaze stayed "pure" and withuot the pan oil and drippings to mask the flavor. I am not a real salmon lover as is my wife but this was delicious. There is also a recipe "Salmon with Scallion Mayonaise" that is as good or better than this recipe if that is possible. We have cooked both dishes twice in the last 10 days and this from a guy who doesn't care for salmon!

this recipe is great as is. but searing large fillets takes a long time and involves unessisary fats. so to save time, some times i just bake the fish and throw the glaze over it. works well with sword fish too. its very simple - i use this recipe often.

THANK YOU EPICURIOUS. I do not have much experience cooking gourmet, and I had no experience cooking with fish. My first reaction to dipping my finger in the glaze? YES! YES! It was so good. I made 1 mistake - I didn't make enough. My husband, who now calls me the greatest cook ever, ate his - and half of mine! Next time I'll make bigger salmon portions. Thank you, everyone for your suggestions. I added the butter, the honey, the cornstarch, and cooked it outside. I can't imagine it without each of those components. This is, for good reasons, my husband's favorite dish that I've ever made. Thanks again, it was perfect for our romantic special dinner, and went great with a white wine and a blush.

After reading the reviews regarding excess smoke and mess, I decided to use my oven set at 450 degrees. I sprayed my cast iron skillet with oil and preheated it for 5 minutes. The formula I use is to bake fish for 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. So I followed the recipe directions, and the salmon turned out perfectly for my taste. After removing the salmon to heated plates, I added the vinegar mixture to the cast iron skillet and easily reduced it. No smoke and no mess. It was delicious.

What a waste of good balsamic vinegar! I simply did not like the glaze. I liked the texture of seared salmon very much. Having read reviewers' comments, I was prepared for the smoking and splattering and had a lid ready for the moment when I had to add the liquid, but I couldn't get it on quickly enough to prevent the splatter all over my stove - and I prepared only one portion. I know I would be very upset if I had cooked a greater quantity of salmon. For those of you who did like the glaze, but didn't like the mess, perhaps you might try heating up the glaze before adding it to the pan. This might reduce the splattering. As for me, I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

Despite all of the rave reviews, my husband and I both thought the glaze was awful! In fact, it never made it to the dining room, but went down the garbage disposal. It seemed like a simple enough reduction (I've done quite a few), so I am not sure what went wrong. I even followed the advice of another, and added butter to help round out the glaze to no avail. There are too many recipes on this website for me to give this one another chance.

Just a fabulous recipe. My boyfriend and I had sworn off salmon since neither of us have ever liked it. However we've been a little "softer" than we should be around the middle and I decided salmon, with all of it's wonderful qualities would be our fix if I could only do something about the taste. This was that fix. This was great. I actually cut the skin off the bottom, paired this with an Asian pear and watercress salad with sesame dressing (also on this site)and the butternut squash soup with cider cream (again, on this site) from the previous night...what a meal-and in only a half-hour!!

This is easy and delicious! Really only one negative - the smell of it cooking will stink up your house. If you plan to have company any time soon, wait until summer and cook the whole thing outside on the grill. My boyfriend was afraid to eat it b/c of the smell, but loved it once he tasted it!

This glaze was delicious. My salmon did not cook through in 4 min. so I had to cook it longer which made it darker than the picture.

Stick with your instincts. Don't fry fish in your house. This would have probably have been better if the fish had been grilled on the barbecue and the glaze made with clean oil rather than the remnants from searing the fish. The salmon I used was reasonably fresh, though not right off of the boat, and this recipe had a slight fishy taste. As slight as it was, my wife said no and went for leftovers.

I am planning to try the Grilled Glazed Salmon next time that everyone seems to be comparing to this recipe. Regardless, this is an wonderful, healthy (and quick) dish! Great w/ red potatoes.

We loved this dish. It was easy to make and the glaze was delicious. I thought the glaze was a bit too tangy and think it could be smoothed out by finishing with a little butter, but my husband said he wouldn't change a thing. If you are sauteeing salmon on the stovetop and don't want your house to smell for days, put a lid on the pan while it's cooking. It will also speed up the cooking time because it surrounds the fish with heat. This recipe is a keeper.

I don't think searing adds much to the flavor (besides a few more fat calories) as opposed to, say, roasting at 500°, and as others have pointed out, the place smells for hours, if not days, afterward. The glaze was wonderful, but it cooks down to far less than 1/3 cup. I'd adjust the intial amount of the glaze ingredients accordingly. The flavor was wonderful, and I will do the glaze again.

Awesome! My husband and I both loved it. I served it with couscous and steamed spinach, and the glaze complimented them perfectly. I ended up cooking the salmon a little longer than called for, but I think I should have stopped the first time.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago for the first time and found it to be one of my favorite salmon recipes of all time!

It was just fine overall. Maybe it is my burners, but when I seared the salmon, the outside was burning and charring but the inside was still very rare, too rare for my taste. I had to shred the salmon a little cook it properly. The glaze was all right, I expected it to thicken a little bit more. Next time, I will try the cabbage combo with it.

Rating: 4
Everyone enjoyed it. I marinated the salmon in sesame oil, chicken broth, chopped garlic, nappa cabbage, carrot shards, in a big bowl, for fifteen minutes. These marinated veggies then got sauteed after the salmon was cooked, then were used as the bed for the salmon. The glaze benefited from the addition of green onion rounds, thrown in during the reduction process. My picky five, three and one year old boys chowed this down. Hubby loved it too and I imagine this will become an easy weeknight supper in my recipe collection.

I am always looking for good recipes to incorporate into the offerings at our Country Inn. Of the many I have taken off this website, this was one of the most disappointing.

This recipe was just OK, not fabulous. I thought 4 tsp. brown sugar would make the sauce too sweet, so I only used 3. I reduced the sauce too much and it turned to caramel when I put it on top of the salmon. It had a good flavor though. I will try this recipe again and will not reduce the sauce as much. It certainly was easy to prepare. My house did NOT smell fishy. The key is to make sure the salmon is very fresh. My husband caught the fish in Alaska. It was cut in filets and vacuum packed and frozen immediately.

I love salmon, but this recipe was not great. I ended up having to cook the salmon forever, and my apartment still smelled like fish four days later - gross! The glaze was nice but I didn't reduce it enough and it was too thin. I think I'll stick to roasted and broiled salmon recipes.

I have to admit, the night I made it, I only thought it was so-so. The cooking method was great-- effective, fast, and easy-- but I was less than impressed with the glaze. The next day, though, I threw the leftovers into a salad with spinach leaves, grapes, Brie, and toasted almonds, and it was absolutely the perfect blend of flavors! I'd definitely make this again, but only to use in a salad like this. (BTW, if you don't care for all of those ingredients, I'd say the grapes- if they are high quality- are the perfect pair for this salmon.)

I'm trying to watch fat and calories right now, and this recipe really fit the bill. I put the fish on a bed of cucumbers and tomatoes and poured the glaze over all, and it was fabulous!

The only problem was that searing the salmon made my whole house smell of fish. It still smelled this morning. Any suggestions how to avoid such a thing? I used my oven fan while cooking and burned incense afterwards. No luck.

I eat Salmon probably 4 nights a week and am always looking for new ways to fix it. This is now my favorite way!!! I also sauteed some portobella mushrooms in the sauce and they were wonderful!!!!

Salmon to perfection!

As well as being incredibly tasty, this is so easy to make, yet it looks and tastes like something only a skilled chef could pull off! Brilliant, I highly recommend it for small dinner parties (4 or 6 tops) when you really need to impress. I made it for 9- it can be a little too hands on for that many. But the best I have tried from epicurious so far.

It was quick and simple to make. I only had dark brown suger in the cabinet so went with that and it was fine.

This recipe was so fast and easy. I made in a matter of minutes!!! This is definitely a great meal if you've just gotten off work, the guests are on their way and you have a 3 year old tugging on your pants!

One of those rare recipies where your result is worth more than the effort you put into it. Absolutely quick and easy and delicious. Serve with a mild rice and green vegetable, and you have a year-round keeper recipe. I would have liked to get the sauce slightly thicker, but otherwise - perfect!
