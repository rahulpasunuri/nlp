If you are having troubles with strawberry flavor troubles. try adding strawberry powder. It is freeze dried strawberries. Find it at Chef Rubber.

I used raspberry seedless "all fruit" instead because I was making a chocolate raspberry cake and it was fantastic! Everyone raved! will definitely use again

I made this recipe with the strawberry jam doubled, based on other reviewers' comments. This gave it a perfect balance between the chocolate and strawberry flavors. Unfortunately, I thought that the extra jam made it a little too sweet. Maybe I should experiment with strawberry liqueur, or using unsweetened chocolate instead of bitersweet.

Since everyone said it didn't taste strawberry enough, I added 1/4 c vodka mixed with strawberry syrup for a strawberry liquor. Yikes. It had a bitter aftertaste. So then I added about a cup of sugar. wouldn't recommend my little experiment. Maybe rum would work. But it sure tasted divine once in the cake.

Per the comments below, i added about twice as much strawberry jam. I use it warm on cupcakes (i cut the recipe in half) with great success.

Oh, this ganache is the deadly! I love it. I agree that the strawberry taste is not very strong, though.

I just made the ganache and it was prety plain. Noone who ate a piece could taste the strawberry.

I made this with my mother-in-law as the filling to a large wedding cake. The results were fantastic. It takes a while to set up...make about 3 hours in advance, or plan to put it in the freezer. LOTS of compliments!!! We frosted the cakes with cocoa frosting and topped them with fudge sauce (both from epicurious) then stood rows of strawberries up on the top. Outstanding. I'd give 5 forks if possible.
