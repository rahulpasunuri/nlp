Forgot to pick up Sherry at the market, and used some Madeira I had on hand instead. Was fantastic!

Best Onion soup I have had since I was a child! I use white port wine instead of the Sherry. Makes a hugedifferance. Much smoother / nicer taste

Absolutely delicious! Family requested I put this is our "favorites" file.

I've made this soup twice now, following the recipe exactly and I'd make no changes. It's delicious.

Made this soup as directed with preimium ingredents. This was a "good" soup, I've had much better, I've had worse. I am planning to reduce the 2 cups of left-over soup to use as a sauce for a chicken breast. I feel the over-whelming flavor of sherry lends it self better to a "sause" rather then a soup. Perhaps I didn't cook down the Sherry enough..

This was excellant! I didn't put in the rosemary because some of my guests do not like it. Other than that, it was great. There was nothing left.

This soup was pretty fantastic. As already mentioned a good alternative to beef broth. As I love french onion soup, but don't eat beef this was a real find.

Wow! This soup is really good. The best onion soup we've ever tasted. Different from the traditional French onion, but vive la difference! We didn't use bread bowls, but will next time. The sourdough would complement the soup nicely, and, as pointed out below, would make this an excellent meal by itself.

Very good. I used the bread bowls and glad I did-makes a nice presentation and turns it into a meal, that is if you eat the bread bowls like we did. Next time I will put a layer of sliced cheese over the top.

Above average onion soup recipe. Definitely not the best I've had though, I skipped the sour dough bowls and just served bread on the side.

Awesome soup. Despite the fact that I didn't use leeks (because I didn't have any) and didn't go through the trouble of making the bread bowls (too lazy), the soup ruled. As one commentator already noted, this recipe provides a wonderful alternative to beef broth for those of us who don't eat beef. By the way, I think the soup would have been just as flavorful and good without the whipping cream - that almost made it too heavy. Enjoy.

This recipe is decadent for the onion soup lover....an elegant break from the floating toast in broth standard. I agree that the bread bowls are totally unnecessary and a little distracting. This is a standard for holidays now!

I've made this recipe several times, and it's one of the best ... especially for people who don't eat beef or use beef broth. Before serving, I grate some Swiss or Guyére cheese on the bowl "lids" and broil them long enough for the cheese to melt.

I didn't use the bread bowls either. I used Kristens idea and sprinkled a little grated parmasen/Romano mix on top. Huge hit with luncheon ladies. I would make it a bit thinner next time, maybe more broth. But, my husband had a great idea, make the soup thicker and pair up with steak or veal chops. What do you guys think?

This is one of the best onion soups I've made- again and again. It is wonderful even without the bread bowls.

Wow! "vituperative". I had to look that one up. Great new word to add to my vocabulary. Thanks Kristin!

I just made this as the soup course for a dinner party this evening and I was extremely pleased with the results- as were my companions. I did not serve the soup in bread bowls and I added a toss of homemade croutons and fresh parmesan to the soup before I served it. Simply divine. I don't understand the cryptic, vituperative commentary by Jr. down there, the cream was an excellent enhancement.

I certainly hope this recipe came from Chef Allen or worse yet, J. Colletta. The recipe of onion soup in a sourdough nbowl works until you ruin it by adding heavy cream. Serve it to Reno Armeni, he deserves it.

Excellent soup. I made this for a gourmet dinner party with a french theme. If I were to make this again I would double the amount of rosemary. Adding some finely chopped at the last 10 min of cooking to retain its pretty green color. And make sure to use LARGE garlic cloves.

Fantastic recipe, one of the best onion soups I've ever tried. Easy to make and the bread bowls really look impressive. I'm looking forward to making this for guests.
