Wonderful use of my CSA veggies! I discovered I had no cilantro when I went to make it, but added some thyme at the end, which was lovely. I also added a can of black-eyed peas to make it a complete salad for lunch. Delicious cold! I used canned corn instead of fresh and yellow squash instead of patty pan. I'll definitely keep this in mind for using up okra and squash from my CSA in the future.

I made several substitutions since I was trying to use up some veggies from my garden but the overall concept of the dish was there. I would make this again using the correct ingredients and probably add some endamame to round it out. I just loved all the fresh tastes with just a hint of heat.

I just made this again and am really surprised that people have described it as bland and kind of ho-hum. I made it last year as written;this year, I discovered that my cilantro had turned to mush so used fresh basil instead. Both times, it was wonderful, a great combination of flavors and textures. We and our guests loved it! Maybe having most of the ingredients fresh from our garden makes the difference but I highly recommend this recipe.

Very tasty, and not very long to prep, except for the frying of the okra. Without eggs/milk to hold on to the corn meal, it all came off as soon as it hit the oil. A waste of oil, cornmeal and time. Skip this unnecessary step (healthier as well.

Deeelicious! In response to some bland comments from other reviews, I added some oregano and thyme to the sauté. Also, some frozen broad beans gives it a meatier texture, like succotash.

Love it - all of my favorite things...

While, admittedly, I omitted the cayenne because my kid won't eat it, I found this dish to be a lot of prep for what it is. It's fine.

I was not blown away by this recipe. I really expected to love it, but found it a bit bland. It isn't a keeper for me.

Wonderful! I have made this dish twice, the last time for friends. The recipe is now in their file, too! I find that the okra needs to cook longer than 6 minutes - more in the 10 minute range.

We had this with grilled steaks and baked potatoes, and it was a really nice summer meal. I was able to find the fresh okra even in San Diego. I used more cayenne and seasoned it more, but it was very good!

Very tasty. Couldn't find fresh okra (in Atlanta no less) so used frozen and defrosted it first. Turned out very well. Does need to be liberally seasoned though.
