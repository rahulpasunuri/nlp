A great way to cook a whole fish. The skin keeps the smoke flavor from becoming too dominant. Starting with good fresh fish is half the battle. Simple, easy recipe; we used a 3 lb Copper river salmon and made sure we didn't cook it past medium rare. Bring it too the table whole and portion it out there, it makes a great presentation. We also made lime butter to go with it. I love this website.

My husband and I lived in Alaska for 3 years and have longed for a good whole salmon grill recipe. This was perfect. We bought a whole 5 lb sockeye salmon, salt and peppered the inside, and cut up lemon slices - layering the inside. Just delicious! Everyone at the party raved about the taste and the presentation.
