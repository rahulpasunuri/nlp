This was delicious. I made this recipe as is. The chili powder flavor was a little over powering. I may cut back on it next time. It was not too spicy, even thought it had a little kick. My 5 and 7 year old girls loved it. I served it over jasmine rice as a main course.

Made this for dinner last night. Did not have dried mustard otherwise I made the recipe as is. My husband requested this for his football party.

We made this for New Year's Eve, and everybody loved it. I left out the cayenne, because I was afraid it would be too spicy. But, it actually would have been better with it. I also followed others' hints and marinated the shrimp with the spice and oil in the fridge for about an hour before cooking it.

I would definitely halve the chili powder (a bit overpowering) and salt (and I'm definitely not afraid of salt) next time, but otherwise this was great. I actually served it as some others did as a main course over basmati rice.

If shrimp weren't expensive I'd make this every night. I too mixed the spices with oil and marinated the shrimp in the fridge for 1/2 hour or so. This is really easy and makes a great appetizer.

EXCELLENT - especially when you marniate the shrimp before cooking. to do that, add 1 TBSP of olive oil to the seasonings, a squeeze of fresh lemon (1 lemon wedge) - the mixture becomes a paste that you can mix with the shrimp in a ziploc bag. other additional spices to add include ground coriander, garlic power (or a garlic pepper blend)& chili flakes instead of chili powder

My husband's favorite meal. I serve it as a main dish over basmati rice. I've made it countless times.

Spicy and yummy! These disappeared in minutes at a dinner party. I combined everything but half the oil in a ziploc bag and let them sit for about an hour, then sauteed them in the rest of the oil. Phooey to those who didn't like them! I think you can tell by reading the recipe that they will be pretty spicy......

This was very disappointing. The spice combination did nothing to enhance the flavor of shrimp. It just overpowered them. Blech!

This was a hit, and so easy. To make it even more spicy, i flipped the amount of the cayenne with that of the chili powder, it gave it a really nice kick. SO EASY also!

This was a huge hit at my Christmas Party. This must be the best spicy shrimp recipe that I have ever come across. Would definitely make this as a main dish too!!!!

THIS IS GREAT!!! My husband loves blackened shrimp, fish, etc. I've been looking for a good recipe and this one wins. I served as a main dish over white rice with fresh pineapple added to the rice. YUM YUM Very easy to make.

Made this recipe using Chipotle instead of cayenne...yikes! Have made it several times since, love it. If the flavor is a little strong, try it as a main dish over rice instead of on its own. (Maybe a gourmet faux-pas, but I made this with chicken, put it on rice...very good as well.)

Definitely a crowd-pleaser! I tried several different spicy shrimp recipes, and this was everyone's favorite.

O.K., very spicy. You have to be a fan of cajun/blackened style and after being disappointed in both this and the Cajun Style Blackened Halibut (Epicurious), I guess I no longer am. I'd rather grill or broil shrimp (e.g. Broiled Shrimp with Mustard and Tarragon - also Epicurious) and and avoid the messy cast iron skillet clean up.

Good, but I like shrimp with coriander and lime better.

I served this at a party and everyone wanted more and they also wanted the recipe. It was almost gone before all the guests had arrived.

I've made this dish for three differant parties and guests are still calling for the recipe. It's fast & easy if your prepare the mixture ahead of time!
