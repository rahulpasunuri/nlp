"Peppadew" is a trademarked name for a specific product, mentioned by BA magazine in a later article. I couldn't find them on my deadline, I'm told that Trader Joe's has them, not willing to drive to the suburbs just for "sweet Piquante peppers, sugar, vinegar & salt", I substituted Sliced Red Bell Peppers that were jarred in vinegar and also added a generous portion of actual pimentos. I also doubled the ancho chili powder and slightly increased the cheddar cheese. Don't skimp on the "salt and pepper to taste" step. I also generously salted the water for boiling the pasta. I did all this on my second attempt to make this dish and it came out wonderfully.

Very disappointing, but let me say this, the flavor is great, but it was NOT like macaroni and cheese. It was... watered down. I'm determined to make this again, and do it right. I'll probably use a bechamel sauce base, and add in the the other elements to create the same flavor. I really wanted this to be great, it just was not. Not cheesy, at all.

There seems to be some controversy regarding this recipe. The first thing I will say is that when I served this to my wife she said "This is not mac and cheese". If you are expecting to be that creamy gooey mac and cheese that many of us dream of and consider true comfort food, search on. The introduction of the pepper flavor to the mac and cheese is quite pleasant and worth pursuing. The amount of both garlic and ancho chiles were inadequate as the flavors were not discernible. Overall the recipe needs to have the flavors pumped up and its "cheesyness" restored.

This is one of my favorite Mac and Cheese/Pasta dishes and I have made it multiple times. I have eaten Mac and Cheese at restaurants around the country and I have made it at home many times from various recipies, so I consider myself a bit of an expert. I have used the Peppadew peppers and also just used roasted red peppers in brine and it comes out great either way.

Absolutely divine! Not sure how others found it dry - using the 8oz of pasta the recipe called for, mine was very saucy. Will definitely make again -

I have made this recipe a couple times now - there has been a great variation in the spicyness of the Pepperdew peppers. It has made it interesting. The first batch of peppers were sweet and spicy but mild, the second set were much spicier. Both times the dish disappeared in minutes but I was definitely surprised by the spicyness. Also - I used skim milk mozzarella both times and it was fine. I will make this again and again.

This was terrible -worse Mac and cheese ever -both in texture and Taste I make it for friends, was concerned about it cause it just wasnt right. Had to make a second version - my own recipe that is tried and true. Everyone took one bot of this and agreed it was awful - and finish my version. Don't waste your money.

Doubled this for a group lunch and it went over like gangbusters. Couldn't find peppadew peppers, used jarred cherry peppers instead. Really delicious and gorgeously brown and gooey.

I also grabbed a baking dish with a large surface area thinking it would give me more of the yummy crunchy topping, but agree that this made the dish less "creamy" than if I had used a dish more similar to the one pictured! May try it with a bechamel in the future but don't want to dampen the great pimento cheese flavor which is what this one is all about. If you want "Blue Box" style make it on the stove top not in the oven.

I really enjoyed this receipt. It was a nice twist to Mac'n'Cheese, that didn't involve $25.00 worth of artesianal cheeses. I added an egg into the cheese before mixing it with the pasta. Don't ask why, its just how my grandmother taught me to make it. I planning to try this again in the near future, but making a bechamel first and then adding the pimento cheese into it, and then mixing it into the pasta. Final note, make sure you use the correctly sized dish. Without thinking about it, I grabbed my largest Pyrex dish which was far too much surface area. I would suggest a 9" square to increase the depth and prevent the danger of it drying out.

LOVED this!! So good!! It's more of pasta dish than a mac and cheese, as others have said, but is delicious. I think it would make an excellent side dish to some tri-tip, or bring it to your next potluck to be the star of the show. Mine wasn't dry at all, as others have complained in their reviews, and I wonder if they really read the part of the recipe where it says only 8 oz of pasta-- that's half a box, not the full box. If one put the whole box of pasta in, it would be dry unless you doubled the rest of the recipe.

This was the BEST I have ever eaten. I don't normally get excited about mac and cheese, but this was just exceptional.

Based on the reviews and the percentage of "would make again", I almost didn't make this recipe, but I'm glad that I did.... it was DELICIOUS! It probably shouldn't be called a mac & cheese which is why people may have underrated it due to expectations of a standard mac & cheese not being met. If you like pimiento cheese, you'll like this recipe. Trader Joe's no longer carried the Peppadew peppers (KEY ingredient), but found them at the olive/ salad bar at Whole Foods. I used fresh mozzarella and the only change made was to add 3 slices of cooked/ crumbled bacon..... YUMMY!

I thought this was excellent! Spicy and cheesy--very comforting. I'm a big fan of pimento cheese, it is a long standing tradition in my family--even though we are definitely not southern. I do think this is incorrectly tagged as Low Cal, though...

Flavor was great. Made it with steaks for my Southern friends who always talk about Pimento Cheese. Next time I would combine the ingredients in the food processor and pasta with a simple white sauce before topping with panko mixture and baking. It was too dry!

Delicious. My husband ate most of it the night I baked it and the rest for lunch the next day. He's still raving. I couldn't find ground ancho chiles but it was wonderful without. I made it with the gemelli which gave it wonderful texture.

Rating: 1
I could tell the texture would be odd with the pepper sauce without more dairy. However, the half and half did not really help and ruined the potential healthfulness of this dish. I do not find it repeatable for any reason.

Rating: 0
This was good but the pimento was a bit overpowering. I'd suggest going a little lighter with the pimento and adding more cheese instead. The panko was an interesting touch, I think I'll use breadcrumbs next time. Not my goto recipe for this dish but nonetheless the mac n' cheese was finished.

This was good. My friends loved it. But even though it technically IS mac & cheese, it wouldn't be my go-to dish when someone had the mac-&-cheese craving. But it is a nice, homey pasta to serve with an unfussy ranch-dressing salad when the Foodie Police aren't watching

I was expecting creamy mac and cheese--mine turned out more like a baked pasta with red pepper sauce. I might try this again, covering the dish when it is baked, or adding some moisture to the pepper sauce, as mine was dry and chewy on top.

Made this for a small dinner party and it was very good. I did change it and added some egg yolk and cream to the cheese sauce to give it a smoother texture. I also used hot peppadews instead of mild ones because I find the mild ones too bland.

This was ok, but almost everyone decided they prefer the bechamel-based mac and cheese I usually make.

A lot of diverse opinions here! It's not the creamiest of macaroni and cheeses but I made it to the letter and thought it was great. Easy enough to make creamier with milk or cream, but I rather liked the hearty texture and deep pepper/pimento flavor as written.

Rating: 1
I made this as written and found it to be pretty underwhelming. The sauce was lacking creaminess and the only redeeming factor was the buttery panko/parmesan crunch on top. Not a keeper. My three year old loved it, but she counts hot dogs and Kraft mac & cheese among her top foods, so that should tell you something.

Took this to a pot luck and made it for the family - everyone enjoyed it. I couldn't find peppadews, but used pimientos instead. Next time will make it with Andrew's Grandmother's pimiento cheese recipe.

Yummmm. We loved this, but didn't have some of the ingredients. Will make again with exact ingredients to see if it makes a difference, but our substitute version was delish!

Just wanted to add, for one reviewer below who compared this to the Mac and Cheese with the carmelized shallots. Thanks for giving me the idea to try this recipe too. We kind of did a throw-down. 4 out of 4 diners voted hands down for the Pimiento Mac and Cheese. The other was really tasty, but this one just had a lot more flavor for us.

Absolutely delicious - agree completely with "best ever" mac and cheese designation. Incredibly TASTY, totally impressed husband and guests, will make again soon!

Mmmmm, very decadent and flavorful! Had a few minor substitutions: piquillo peps instead of peppadew; fusili pasta instead of shells; and a combo of chipotle chili powder, cayenne, & chili powder equal to the amount of the adobo chili powder which I didn't have. Baked for more like 20 min in the 8 cup gratin dish instead of 25 min. My husband and I loved this. It was very creamy, so I'm not sure what happened with the last reviewer? Maybe they used the whole package of pasta instead of just the 8 oz? I almost made this mistake myself but caught it just in time. Will make again!

I followed the recipe as written and was incredibly disappointed by this dish. I found it to be quite dry and not very creamy (and I think it must be hard to not like something as simple as pasta with cheese).

Delicious and easy since you don't have to make a white sauce. Made it exactly as written.

I cannot believe you think this the best mac anh cheese.. Of course I do have to say my family loved it but they love boring food.. I went to lots of effort to obtain ingredients etc. Very disappointed. Your BEST is Mac and Two Cheeses with Caramelized Shallots If it is not broken don't fix it!!

I cannot believe you think this is your best ever. It is the worst ever. However, my family loved it and they have no taste what so ever. Your best that I have ever had is Mac and Two Cheeses with Caramelized Shallots. I don't know how you can say your new one is the best. I spent loads of time finding ingredients etc and VERY disappointed
