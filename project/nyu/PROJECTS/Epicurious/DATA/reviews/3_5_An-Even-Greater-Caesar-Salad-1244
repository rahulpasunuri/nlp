This has been the caesar salad dressing I've been waiting my whole life to find. Well, that's a bit extreme - but it is really, really good. Absolutely creamy, delicious, and garlicy. My only changes were one fewer anchovy and low-fat mayonnaise. Because I couldn't find "anchovy fillets w/ capers" at my supermaket, I simply used regular (white) anchovy fillets + ~tsp jarred capers. Perfect.

Outstanding! I make this probably 2 times a month and it is outstanding. I add the oil in the anchovies to the oil for the croutons -- really infuses the flavor!

This is by far the best Caesar Salad recipe ever! It's so easy to make and everyone loves it when I serve to guests. I've been making this recipe since it first came out and it's still one of my all-time favs. My only substitution is store-bought croutons if I don't have time to make them from scratch.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I only use 2 anchovies. Read the recipe carefully or you'll end up adding all the garlic cloves to the dressing. The dressing only has 3 cloves. Paint the dressing around the inside of your salad bowl with a spatula or spoon and then add the lettuce and toss with tongs until all the the lettuce is dressed evenly. This is a great trick instead of ending up with big blobs of dressing on some leaves. Make sure to use lots of freshly cracked pepper! Delish!

I've been using this recipe ever since it first appeared in 1996 (wow--almost 13 years ago!). I was devastated to lose my tattered clipping and thrilled to find it online. It's my go-to Caesar recipe, and always gets raves from my guests. Couldn't be easier!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! The only changes I made were that I used anchovy paste instead of anchovy filets (I just can't look at those little fish) and then I add a little bit of caper juice and a few capers. I also use the cheap parm in the green can but I do use fresh grated parm for the finish. I have gotten raves on this salad every time I serve it.

Rating: 4
Well, I've made this recipe since 2003 if that says anything. I make the dressing in the food processor for a smoother finished product. I add about 1/8 cup of olive oil very slowly while the food processor is running. Also, I add a dash of Cayenne pepper to the dressing. For the croutons, I sprinkle with Lawry's seasoning salt.

Rating: 4
By far, this is the best creamy Ceasar dressing I have tasted! The only changes I made was to roast the garlic cloves, since I'm not one for large quantities of raw garlic, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard since it is the one ingredient missing that has gone into the Ceasar dressings I have made in the past.

Delicious -- but I always omit the anchovies and capers.

This dressing is fantastic. I even made it with light mayo and it didn't taste light. I just used regular anchovies (no capers). This will be my go-to Caesar recipe from now on, especially since it doesn't use raw egg so is safe for any guests who are pregnant.

Rating: 0
I'm not going to rate this recipe right now, as I made substitutions that previous reviewers had suggested, and I really didn't like it! I used 1/2c mayo and 1/4c olive oil, and had to use 2t of anchovy paste because I had no anchovy fillets (the rest of the recipe was as written). I found it to be harsh tasting, and I wonder if I would have liked it better if I'd used all mayonnaise. I might make it again, without substitutions. I should admit that it wasn't so terrible that I was unable to eatseconds, but it was not what I expected at all.

Rating: 0
For the people that critize the mayo as the base to this dressing...Have you ever looked up a reciped on how to make mayo from scratch! Hello...... By using mayo instead of raw egg makes this a much safer dressing and it can refrigerated for several days. Classic caesar has to be used within a few hours after making it, this is a basic fact in food safety!!!!

Best caesar salad dressing EVER. I'm not a purist - I just go for taste, and the taste here was awesome. I couldn't find anchovies anywhere, so I just used about 2 T of capers in the dressing. For company, I would probably reduce the amount of garlic in the dressing (though it WAS good), but for my own private pleasure, I will keep it as is. I added bacon too, just because I like it. Never buying salad dressing again.

Rating: 4
I have had three people call me since I made this to ask for the receipe. I made a few changes, I used roasted garlic olive oil, plain anchovy paste, and I threw in a tablespoon of capers in the cuisinart. I also made croutons that I tossed with the garlic olive oil, melted butter, Salt and pepper and some chipolte power (to keep them guessing). Making it again tomorrow night.

Fantastic caesar dressing!!! The croutons are delicious. This has to be the best caesar dressing that I have ever had. This is a real keeper. One note, I was out of dijon mustard and had to use chinese mustard instead. Worked great! It gave a nice punch to the dressing.

Rating: 0
The cook from 5/7/05 is right. Anchovies were not part of Caesar Cardini's orginal recipe, and, surprisingly enough, neither was garlic. Cardini added garlic to the croutons only, but because we've gotten so used to eating Caesar made with anchovies and garlic in the dressing, we've mistakingly thought that to be the "authentic" version.

This maybe a "great dressing" but it isn't a Caesar Salad Dressing. Mayo NEVER in the dressing. Anchovies are ALWAYS in the dressing. Coral Springs is right. You can say; "It's Great." BUT it isn't Caesar salad. I think too many people are trying bottled dressing and they think it is the real thing. A lost art, Caesar Salad! Glad I got the recipe from Mr. Paul's in Detroit.

This is absolutely the best caesar's salad dressing I've ever had -- bar none! I've made it with full fat mayo and with reduced fat mayo, and while it's certainly much better with full fat mayo, it's not too bad with reduced fat mayo either. I make it exactly as written except I usually add a few extra capers.

This was really tasty, lots of good flavors, I have made alot of caesars and this was up there. I did find it a little rich with it being only mayo and no oil, but if you want really strong and rich flavors very worthwhile. I did use anchovy paste and added a little bit of evoo.

WOW - this is a really tasty caesar dressing! I add extra lemon because I love lemon and I think the dressing needs to be a little thinner. Everyone I have served this to has asked for the recipe. I will not be using my other caesar dressing recipes again!

Made this based on the previous reviews... no kidding, THE BEST CAESAR SALAD EVER! I forgot to add the olive oil (my mistake) and it was STILL delicious! Feel free to adjust the garlic (less garlic for taste) and anchovies to your taste. I could eat this many times per week and I'm not all that big into Caesar salad!

Absolutely loved this! Even the boyfriend had an enormous helping after one taste-test ... a huge testimony to the flavors as he tends to avoid leafy vegetables! I did add just a splash or two of dry white wine to the dressing while in the blender. Just my preference for a not so thick dressing.

Rating: 4
Everyone that I've ever prepared this recipe for has been thoroughly impressed. I do use almost double the amount of garlic that the recipe calls for, however, to give the dressing some sharpness that's otherwise absent. The croutons are a staple; don't skimp and buy boxed!

Rating: 3
This is an easy effective way to make a ceasar dressing that it 90% better than anything you would find in a restaurant. The only change I make is to use only about 1/4 cup mayo and then about 1/2 cup olive oil after all ingediants have been mixed. Add while the processor is running to emulsify. For something a little different, use blue cheese instead of some of the parm.

While I prefer the classic Caesar and not this mayonnaisey creamy rendition, I was intrigued by the rave reviews and just made a 1/3 batch for my 19-year old son for lunch. He's an anchovy and Caesar-salad lover, and gave me the thumbs up on this. I did have to thin the dressing a bit with olive oil. For those like me who prefer the more traditional, try this: sprinkle your wooden salad bowl with coarse salt, then rub with a cut clove of garlic. Then crush the garlic in the bowl, add a dash of Tabasco, a dash of Worcester, about 1/2 tsp dry mustard, a healthy grind of pepper, 3 tbsp EV olive oil, more or less, juice of 1/2 very juicy lemon, and one egg yolk. Whisk in the bowl to emulsify. Add your romaine and toss. Grate your parmesan or pecorino romano over the greens, to your heart's delight. Then add your favorite croutons and anchovies and toss again.

I used more olive oil than mayo. Beware. Serve mouth wash after the salad if it is a first date. Personally I love that garlic after taste. But I have been married for 15 years. And I used store bought croutons. Elaine

This dressing is great. I substituted anchovy paste instead of fillets (about 2 tbs) and 1/2 tsp of capers. Found the croutons somewhat laborious. Frying the garlic in the oil for 8 minutes didn't do much for flavour. I still had to add garlic salt at the end. Otherwise, a definite keeper. I've been searching for a stand-out dressing like this for years.

Vampires, beware: This dish is really garlicky and AWESOME! I just used straight capers instead of the anchovies (because they're vile), and it was such a great dressing. I am trying to implement it at the restaurant where I work (instead of the oil-based, anchovy-laden Caesar dressing that we have now). Wish me luck!

Fat-free mayo is a great substitute when making a caesar dressing that is actually lo-cal. This is like the one I made up when I started weight watchers. Don't skip the anchovies!! It imparts a wonderful flavor (and if you are like me and hate to waste 1/2 a tin of anchovies... get the paste. The tube will last forever in the fridge)

Wanted to share the BEST caesar dressing I've come across: 1/2 TB dijon, 2 garlic cloves peeled, 3 anchovies, 1 TB Worcestershire, 1 TSP hot sauce, 3/4 tsp black pepper (fresh ground is better), 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil. Blend all in blender,except oil, then add slowly the oil. Taste, and see if you need any salt (depending on how salty your parmesan is.) I just add a pinch. I got this from Gourmet magazine and have made it so many times, sometimes adding grilled chicken or shrimp.It keeps for one week in the fridge. The key is using fresh ingredients, especially the lemon juice and parmesan. This is better than the finest restaurant!! The hot sauce gives it a "kick",without making it spicy. You wouldn't even know it was there, but it adds that special dimension to the dressing. That's what I found makes all the difference!Oh, and for the croutons...why bother to make them? I use Chatham Village large cut Caesar croutons. Getit in the produce section of my supermarket. Also great are the garlic and butter ones!! (kids eat them out of the bag! Hope everyone loves it!

I may just never order Caesar Salad in a restaurant again. We loved it. Sprinkled crispy bacon on top.

I brought this salad to a dinner party. People seemed to like it. Next time I might omit the mustard-- I thought this made the dressing a little too tangy. As suggested, I cut back on the mayo-- only about 1/4 cup, I think, and added a 1/4 cup of olive oil. The anchovies MAKE the dressing, so unless you have a severe allergy or something, do try it with the anchovies, at least once. The croutons were surprisingly easy and good. And I thought three cloves of garlic in the dressing was a perfect amount.

I made the mistake of using all the garlic in the dressing, but it was awesome anyway. My boyfriend wouldn't kiss me for three days after eating this but I liked it so much I made the salad again the next week. I added grilled lemon chicken on top to turn it into a main course.

Loke one of the other reviews said, This is the only caesar that my husband will eat. We didn't think it was at all too garlic-y. It is probably the most "real" ceasar I have made... and I have tried many. P.S. the croutons are out of this world. Add one tablespoon of fresh rosemary for added flavor.

I suppose I should have given this recipe 3 forks as it is easy enough to make in advance and keep on hand for a few days. It is tasty, but I prefer the taste of the more time-consuming version I found in Sunset magazine years ago where one can really taste all of the separate ingredients: marinated garlic oil, chopped anchovies, coddled egg, lemon juice, freshly grated parmesan, homemade croutons. But because that takes a lot more advance preparation and effort, I find this recipe is good for a last minute venture like tonight's Decorating the Xmas Tree Dinner.

Really yummy! My whole family devoured it. As they stood around 'taste-testing', I adjusted the proportions in the dressing a good bit. A little more lemon juice, an extra dash of worcestershire, etc. It proved to be wonderfully adaptive to personal tastes -- and that, to me, is the surest sign of a classically good recipe.

After trying several different Ceasar Salad recipes, this one has been by far the best. I usually squeeze extra lemon juice all over the lettuce, before putting the dressing on, just for added taste, and it works out great. Also, for even better crutons, and lighter on the calories, just put the bread squares on a baking pan, drizzle with olive oil, add garlic salt and other favorite herbs and bake at 400. Wonderful!

My advice: Follow the advice of all the other reviews! This was so absolutely unbelievably wonderful, I'm happy that there are leftover anchovies just so that I can make this again. Use more oil and less mayo, and don't fear the anchovies -- in the end, it's all perfect. And the croutons? While deceivingly simple they were definitely time intensive (I was making food for 13 people), but also worth every second.

You know how you get great caesar salad in a restaurant, and wonder why yours doesn't turn out like that? This caesar will: great flavor (garlic and anchovies rule), and leaves are well dressed, with dusting of parmesan. Definitely make the croutons fresh. Only caveat: This is a very rich dressing; cut back mayo for olive oil.

I keep coming back to this caesar dressing again and again - you just can't beat it! Like others, I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 olive oil.

I use the Herbed Garlic and Parmesan Croutons recipe on this site, as I find them easier to prepare and less oily.

I took this dish to a dinner party last night and got LOTS of compliments! Everyone kept commenting on how great the salad was. Thanks to the previous reviewers, I did make a few changes that I thought made the dressing even better -- reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup, replaced with 1/4 cup olive oil, used 2 garlic cloves instead of 3, and reduced the number of anchovies to 3 (it was my first time using anchovies, so I was a bit apprehensive!). I was too lazy to make the croutons, but the store-bought ones worked fine. Overall, a great restaurant-quality Caesar salad!

I make this dressing all of the time. Mostly I omit the croutons and just used store-bought. As others suggest, less mayonaise and more olive oil seems to make a dressing that is easier to toss. I also use anchovy paste instead of canned anchovies because it stays fresh longer and is more convenient.

Really great salad. I followed the other reviewer's suggestions to cut the mayo with olive oil and doubled the recipie. I made one mistake which i realized as soon as i did it - instead of drizzling in the oil, i poured it in all at once. The dressing never did emulsify completely after that, but it still tasted terrific.

I guess the right mixture would be half and half. I can´t wait until I can serve this salad to my friends together with grilled meat!

Delicious! This is a simple and tasty dressing that takes only minutes to prepare. I did follow the advice of the San Jose cook and used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup olive oil.

This is probably a good recipe that I didn't do justice to. I'm quite sure that I sauteed the croutons too quickly and not long enough, so... Also, I cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup, but will go to 1/4 cp next time. Also will add 1/2 cp oil instead of 1/4.

Holy Cow this is great! I cheated and used store-bought croutons and chopped romaine lettuce in a bag (it was on sale), and it was still great.

Okay - I made this again yesterday and tripled the recipe in order to use up the can of anchovies but used 3/4 cup light mayo, 3/4 cup olive oil and 3/4 cup egg substitute. Then mixed in about 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. It was the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too runny either. The croutons are, once again, worth making. A keeper in our house! Initial review: This dressing is to die for! I used 1/2 cup of mayo instead of 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of olive oil to make it a little less thick. And do make the croutons! I used sourdough bread and they were so good. Store bought just wouldn't cut it with this great salad. Even my daughter, who rarely eats salad, requested it for a second time last night. It is the best!!!

I agree with the previous reviewer. This dressing is much too thick, and had a strong mayonnaise taste. I remedied this by replacing half the mayo with olive oil and adding an egg yolk. Sort of defeats the purpose of an egg-less caesar, but there's not a problem with salmonella in my area. I liked the doctored version much better. Now if someone could tell me what takes care of the wicked garlic breath that results from eating this??!

I thought this was a very good recipe, but could use some doctoring up. I added a bit of olive oil to the dressing, but next time I would just use less mayonnaise and replace it with a like amount of oil. It was very thick (even too thick for me and I like thick dressings) and too mayonnaise-y. The croutons were yummy, but I might just stick them in the oven to cook next time (a time saver). Overall, though, a delicious dressing.

Yummy! I subsituted 2 tablespoons of fish sauce for the anchovies, since I did not have them on hand, and added an egg. Very garlicky, but that's the way we like it. Spring for the really good parmesan; this salad is worth it. A real keeper.

Rating: 3
Good, but too much garlic, even for a garlic lover like me. Three cloves in the dressing gave it a hot, peppery taste. I would use 2 next time. I also used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup olive oil with good results. Next time I might try cutting mayo back to 1/4 and adding an egg yolk instead to test the increased suppleness. Anyway, better than anything that comes out of a bottle.

I see this is back on Constant Comment. For good reason too-- this is a very good dressing, but I use less mayo, and one less anchovey fillet. It's a bit too much dressing for one salad. The croutons are a must-try.

My husband is fussy about Caesar salads, but there were no complaints when I served this version. Crouton tip: Slice the garlic in half and soak in the olive oil as long as possible, then pour it all into a pan to saute. If you can plan ahead, soak it overnight. The oil will absorb enough garlic flavor so that it will not be necessary to saute it, avoiding any possibility of "scorched" garlic flavor.

Rating: 4
This is truly an "Even Greater" dressing recipe. My family loves Caesar salad and would eat it every day, especially with this dressing. We love the creaminess the mayonnaise imparts to the salad and love the hit of garlic. It would not be Caesar salad for us without bacon as well as the croutons though.

Mmmm. I took some other reviewer's suggestions to decrease the quantity of manyonnaise, and added olive oil and an egg yolk. It was good. I placed feshly shaved parmesan (not grated-- I prefer the cheese a little chunkier) on top of each plate and also added bacon to the dressing. My husband said it just wasn't a Caesar salad to him without bacon. This is really a very easy dressing that's miles ahead of its bottled counterparts.

Rating: 3
Boy, this is good. I doubled the recipe to use up the anchovies, and made this salad three days in a row. No one complained! As is, it is very thick, so I usually thin it out with a touch of olive oil. And sometimes I add herbs to the croutons (not too much, but a little rosemary or thyme is nice). I prefer this version to the original version containing raw eggs. It's a safe alternative that tastes pretty authentic. BUT if you want to not use so much mayo, my mom actually does add an egg yolk, and reduces the mayo, while adding oil. Some previous reviewers mentioned this method as well. All in all, this recipe is great. I'm turning my in-laws into garlic lovers!

Rating: 3
GARLIC, no kidding! Delicous, though. I too reduced the mayo and added olive oil instead. My dressing was not thick at all, so next time I think I'll keep it thicker. Also, next time I'll reduce the amount of anchovies, a little too fishy smelling for us this time. If you like garlic, you'll like this! It's going to be coming out of my pores all night!

An absolutely delicious salad. I also cut back on the mayo, and replaced some of it with olive oil. I used purchased croutons to save on time, but the results were still amazing. Doubled the recipe, and brought it to a potluck. Lots of requests for the recipe. The strong garlic taste is just delicious.

Oh my gosh... this is the most wonderful salad. Definitely don't leave out the anchovies. They add a perfect amount of zing, without being overpowering. I served this at a barbecue with grilled steaks, and a potato salad. Many people wanted the recipe.

Everyone we served this to liked it very much. I saved half the dressing, rather than drenching the salad. It keeps well, and makes an excellent sandwich spread.

WOW!! We loved this. I cut the mayo down as suggested (lowfat). I really liked the croutons. They were easy to do, and tasted so much better than store-bought. We were really happy with this recipe. Thanks, Bon Appetit.

Absoutely wonderful. I took others suggestions, and cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup, then added 1/2 cup of olive oil. Turned out great. You must love garlic to serve this, however. I've never tasted anything quite so garlicy. Paired this up with the Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage-- a fabulous (albiet NOT low-cal) meal.

Incredible. I doubled the receipe, but added only two anchovies, believing that they HAD TO be in there, but I din't want to taste them. Talk about scary looking food, I almost lost it opening the can of anchovies with their little hairs sticking out (bones, I guess). I accidently added more Worcestshire than I expected, and cut the mayonaise as suggested by the reviewers. Everyone LOVED the salad!

I made this salad as a vegetarian dish--with no anchovies & none in the sauce. It was delicious. I think I may have added extra Parmesan cheese to the blended part, and I forgot to add it to the salad later, but it was very tasty. I will definitely make this again! :)

MMMMMM. This is all I heard when I decided to serve this salad at a small dinner party. It's that good. I made a few changes, based on some of the other reviews: no mayo at all (replaced it with 1/3 cup of olive oil, and one large egg yolk) and I cut the garlic down to two (large) cloves. I reduced the amount of anchovies to three fillets (couldn't find anchovies with capers, so I just used plain). I also used only a half teaspoon of the dijon mustard because I don't like my Caesars tangy, and added a tiny bit of black pepper to the dressing. The croutons were the first I've made that have really turned out well. I seasoned them with a light sprinkling of garlic salt in place of the table salt. Topped with some freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano, this salad is heaven in a bowl. The best I've tried.

My family loved it. I used less mayo as others suggested, and added a little vinegar. I also added grilled chicken breasts. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great salad. Unless you are using small garlic cloves, I think three for the dressing is too much -- and I really like a lot of garlic! Instead of the 3/4 c. mayo, I substituted two egg yolks, 1/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. olive oil. It was wonderful!

Forget store bought ceasar salad dressing this is fast, easy and delicous!! I doubled the recipe to use up the anchovies and reduced the suggested mayo from 3/4 to 1/2 cup. Worked out excellent!

A wonderful recipe...I went along with some of the other suggestions. Used 1/2 cup high-fat mayo, a generous dash of tabasco and 3 anchovies instead of 4. Also used an extra clove of garlic and added 1/4 cup of olive oil after blending the first ingredients. Topped it off with sliced grilled turkey cutlet...tasty!!!

This is the best caesar salad I have ever tasted, bar none. I have served it to guests several times, always receiving rave reviews. I recommend two modifications to the original recipe: First, rather than using four anchovies fillets, I use only one or two. Second, after a frustrating and disappointing attempt at making my own croutons, I now buy them at the store. The homemade croutons took a great deal of time and mine simply didn't turn out very well. I'm on my way to a Labor Day potluck. Naturally, I'm bringing this fabulous salad, and I can't wait to hear the compliments!

this salad is wonderful!! i am eating my 2nd bowl as i type!!! i did reduce the mayo as suggested(not lowfat) and i am glad i did otherwise i fear it might be to mayonaissey(?) for me. i think the homemade croutons really take this and any salad to the next level. i did season my croutons with basil, oregano, and thyme just to kick them up a bit. whatever you do don't use purchased ones. homemade ones are quick,cheap, easy, and much better than bought. ENJOY

The best caesar salad dressing I've made! My husband & I are known to our friends as the king & queen of garlic and I always double the garlic called for in most recipes. Based on the comments I read, I stuck to the 3 cloves called for. It was just right. I also used 3 anchovie filets (not with capers) and added a dash of tabasco for kick! I also adjusted the mayo (low fat) to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of olive oil at the end while blending the dressing. I had shavings of good parmesan cheese instead of the regular grated version and put 3 grilled garlic shrimp on top of each plate. My guests and I were in heaven. This recipe is definately a keeper.

My husband and I are big fans of caesar salad, and we have to admit this is the best dressing ever so far...just the right amount of everything...

Rating: 4
This Caesar was absolutely wonderful! I love garlic, so I put 6 cloves in the dressing and passed on the crutons. I used 4 anchovies and put 1/2 tsp of capers, and a pinch of curry powder, then mixed it up. You definately have to love garlic to go this route, and after reading previous comments, I seem to be the minority. I was always on the hunt for the perfect Caesar and this recipe fit the bill so it will end up replacing my old standard. Excellent!!

I love Caesar salad so when I made it for a small dinner party I doubled the recipe. It was gone before I had a\ chance to try it. I guess it is what the title proclaims "An Even Greater Caesar Salad". I'll make it again soon just for my husband and myself. I served it with extra anchovies on the side.

Rating: 4
Really yummy! I used 2 large garlic cloves, which was plenty. Here's what to do with the leftover dressing: use it instead of mayonnaise on turkey or chicken sandwiches - it makes the best sandwich spread in the world!

I finally made this salad and it was great. Yummy for the tummy. I used 3 small garlic cloves and it was way too much for me but my son loved it. We like anchovies so I used the entire can. Since I was making a salad for 2 I didn't need all of the dressing and refrigerated the remaining to use again today. I agree with one of the raters and feel the dressing was a little thick and could be thinned out with water. Other than that it was great!!!

Like you need more reviews, right? But I have to say I think this is the best Caesar salad dressing I've come across(definitely better than most restaurants), and I'm always trying new ones. Served at dinner party and got raves all around. Short on time, so did use purchased croutons (the brand "Just Off Melrose" Caesar Salad Croutons are very good.)

This is a great variation of a caesar salad. I served it to guests and they loved it. I didn't think that the mayo flavor came through at all as several people commented. I used low-fat mayo and large cloves of garlic. I'm not sure the croutons were worth the trouble. Also, you can buy garlic-flavored olive oil which would simplify the crouton recipe.

While this is an easy and safe alternative to the classic, it is very heavy on the mayo -- I added some water to thin it a bit, and I don't think it suffered too much.

The fact that this recipe includes anchovies should not deter anyone who doesn't like the taste or is a vegetarian. I make this recipe with a few teaspoons of capers instead of the anchovies (and vegetarian Worcestershire sauce for vegetarians) instead of the anchovies and it receives raves. Be sure to be very sparing when adding the dressing to your greens and then mix thoroughly. With that garlic, a little goes a long way!

This dish was a real hit when served. The only change I made was to sprinkle a few mixed herbs in with the bread cubes. They could be a mix of your choice, but they should be just a few,so as not to take away from the dressing, which is one of the best I've had.

Made this salad for a pot-luck dinner, adding the salad dressing, croutons and anchovie pieces (I cheated) just before serving. Let me tell you, it got raves.
