I am on a low-carb diet, and I am always scouring Epicurious for delicious low-carb recipes. I used leftover fish and omitted the tomato, but still found this dish made a wonderful cold lunch. It was fast and delicious. Why would anyone substitute sour cream for mayonnaise? If you are a purist, use homemade mayo and cornichons.

mayo? I tried this with sour cream instead and it was blah. because I'm from where we don't do things like put mayo on our fish, I shant make this twice. How proletariat of epicurious.
