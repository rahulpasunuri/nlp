Delicious! With or without the salmon. Very creamy but with no cream so its pretty healthy.

The soup itself is mild so it needs the salmon and dill garnish. A little creme fraiche or even Greek yoghurt helps too. With the garnish, it is a great first course for guests.

I did everything exactly per recipe but omitted the salmon. It is a fantastic soup with the fennel flavor really coming through. My exacting Italian hubby loves it.

This soup was delicious. I agree with previous reviewers that using another leek would boost the flavor. A dollop of creme fraiche or sour creme would be delicious also. Felt full because of the heartiness, but not heavy. Delicious!

Yum! This is not a heavy soup, which is so refreshing! It was the perfect lunch to enjoy while sitting on the patio during the summer. I ended up putting in some extra leeks and one clove of garlic just to use up some ingredients I had and it was great!

I served this for the soup course on New Year's Eve. It was delicate and delicious. Next time I make it I think I will add a hit of Sambuca or Pernod at the end to boost the flavour, and perhaps more fennel seed.

This soup is healthy and hearty! We omitted the smoked salmon and added a dollop of sour cream, crumbled bacon, chives, and diced fennel fronds. Served with cheddar and parmesan crisps!

Made this as a starter for Christmas dinner. Excellent soup! Followed the recipe but used 3 leeks as recommeded by a reviewer. The salmon gave it a nice salty/smokey edge. It even looked just like the picture. Will make it again!

Delicious Soup! Husband liked it a lot too - said it was the best all vegetable soup I've made in a while. Based on some of the reviews where they thought the soup was bland I began a bit different. Started with rendering bacon - about 2/3 lb. Removed bacon and some of the fat. Minced 4 garlic cloves and cooked in the bacon fat. Added 4 (FOUR!) leeks and 2 fennel to the mix. Used 6C chicken broth. Used 4 med potatoes. Used my immersion blender in the pot to mix. Used the bacon crumbles on the top instead of the salmon. Yummy! This will be a regular in my house!

This is a lovely soup. The flavour of the soup IS mild, but compliments the smoked salmon well. The soup can be eaten on its own though, and is just as delicious. My boyfriend is allergic to milk, so I used olive oil in place of butter. I also found the soup a touch too sweet, so I added about a tablespoon of good white wine vinegar and some a few tablespoons of Tofutti "Better than Cream Cheese" to make the soup a little creamier. I didn't need to add any salt with smoked salmon. In the end, the soup was silky, delicate, and well-balanced. Highly recommended.

The soup was very good, but very mild. We made it with bacon instead of smoked salmon, which paired very nicely. Next time, though, I would up the leeks (2 to 3 instead of 1), and maybe even up the fennel.

Made as written. This soup is very mild, a backdrop for the garnish. The smoked salmon was fine, but I am tempted to try smoked trout or butterfish - a bit less salty. All in all - elegant and not too filling.

Delicious, hearty soup of which my husband had seconds, which is always a promising sign. Instead of smoked salmon, I used the tail-on colossal shrimp I had on hand, frying them up and standing them, tails in the air, in a neat tower in the center of the soup. I also used three leeks instead of one, because that's how they're sold.

Made this as a starter for sit down Christmas of 20. Everyone loved it. You can actually make a day or two ahead and rewarm. Actually tastes better the next day. this is a keeper!

This soup was excellent. Very easy to make and so creamy, even though there's not milk or heavy cream. The fennel and potato pairs so nicely togehter.

This was relatively easy to make and tasty wonderful! The aroma while it's cooking is also great. I made ahead (about a day) and it reheated beautifully.

This was perfect and very easy to prepare. We tried it with smoked salmon the first night and smoked ham the second, and concluded that any salty, smoky thing would do for the garnish. Both were delicious, but it was also good with no garnish at all.

made this for guests and very pleased with the flavour and texture of this soup. A great first course for any meal. I used prosciutto instead of salmon and the mariage of flavours is wonderful. Will make this again, but this time just for ourselves!!

Very good soup. I also used prosciutto; smoked salmon was too expensive. I added two garlic cloves.

This was easy to make and very mild. We thought that this actually was more enjoyable with prosciutto than the smoked salmon. If I make again, I would skip the garnish and instead serve with a salmon or other broiled fish entree.

This is easy and very impressive. I served it as a starter for a holiday dinner and got rave reviews from everyone.

I can't get enough of this soup, I love it so much. This is a must try...

This soup is great and easy to make. The smoked salmon did not work for me, but I really don't care for cooked/hot smoked salmon. Maybe I'd try with chiffonade of prosciutto next time. Otherwise, definitely a keeper.

I enjoyed the flavors but it wound up a little watery. Next time, I'll cut back on the broth.

This was a subtle and sophisticated soup - excellent start for New Year's dinner. Added some white papper for a bit of kick.

I didn't change a thing it was delicious as is. This will now be staple recipe.

An excellent version of this type of soup. Definitely use an immersion blender-so much less hassel and mess and easy to leave some potato chunks. I used 3 relatively large potatoes to make the blend of potato and fennel flavor balance work. I'd planned to use it as part of our Feast of Seven Fishes on Christmas Day but ran out of time and appetite. We had it for lunch a couple of days later, but skipped the smoked salmon and it was still beautiful and great. Leftovers with smoked salmon are in the future!!!

This is yummy and very easy to make. Not crazy about smoked salmon but made it that way anyway. Next time might try topping with crumbled bacon instead. Not as healthy but will give that salty edge.

I added some crème fraîche. The creaminess balanced out the soup nicely. I also added extra black ground pepper for spice.

I was a bit disappointed by this dish even though I love fennel. It was a bit bland. Maybe the potato made it bland. I don't know. Maybe I'll try it with less potato or without it next time.

This soup is quite good. I used one fennel bulb and found that even that provided enough fennel flavor. The soup is delicate and the smoked salmon that I used didn't over power it; rather, it provided a salty complement. I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

Agree. This is special. Careful with the salt. I'm a salt lover, but forgot how much of it the salmon would contribute.

This was a great soup to make - absolutely easy and a great compliment to the herb roasted chicken I had made as our entree. Unfortunately, the grocery only had one fennel bulb but I think that gave it just enough of that anise flavor. All-in- all, it was easy, required minimal watch and received compliments all around. A definite keeper for my recipe box.

I also used water instead of broth, topped the soup with fried calamari and added 1 teaspoon Pernod.

Oh also, I didn't include the smoked salmon because I wasn't in the mood, and I think it would have overpowered the soup anyways.

Rating: 3
A nice twist to the traditional potato-leek soup. I replaced the butter with olive oil, and I just used water instead of chicken broth (like in Julia Child's potato-leek soup recipe) to maintain the flavors of the fennel and leek. I probably only used about 5 cups too; didn't want it too thin.

Delicious and very easy to make!

So easy, so delicious, and healthy too! I had to make this soup again immediately after the first batch was gone. It has a wonderful flavor. The smoked salmon can overpower the flavor of the soup, so use it sparingly. This one is a keeper.

Very good flavor and low in calories and fat even though the soup is rich and thick from the potato starch. The fennel and fennel fronds give the soup a delicious aroma and taste. I loved the smoked salmon on top which is a perfect companion to the soup. So delicious I want to keep refilling my bowl and making it look pretty with the garnishes. Enjoy!
