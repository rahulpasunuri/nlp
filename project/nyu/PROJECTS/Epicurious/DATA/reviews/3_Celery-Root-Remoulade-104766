I served this with Coq-au-vin and my guests asked for seconds. Very good recipe, although I would adjust the seasoning next time as I thought the dressing was a tad acidic.

This is a delicious accompaniment to shellfish. It's very easy to make. I substituted chopped pepperoncini for the red pepper flakes and served it with pan-seared scallops and shrimp on top of field green as a first course. My guests loved it!
