I've made this a couple times, and everyone loves it, asks for the recipe. Super simple to make.

I have to admit when I read this, it seemed to be a curious combination of flavors, but, being the adventurous type, I dove in and was delightfully surprised - the flavors really work nicely together. I loved the mint (it's a must - don't skip it). Lovely presentation, refreshing, unique flavor and very elegant.

A great hit at our party. Substituted French brie for cream cheese. The meat isn't necessary, and almost complicates the flavor. I like dishes that are easy to please for both meat and meatless lovers.
