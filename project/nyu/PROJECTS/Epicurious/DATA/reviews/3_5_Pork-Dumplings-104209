PART 2 of my previous review: Today I made the rest of the Pork dumplings remaining from yesterdays batch of pork dumpling recipe. Today instead of just steaming as in the 'Pork dumpling' recipe, I used the frying method described in the 'Shrimp and pork pot stickers' recipe on this site The frying method works 100% better in my opinion!! The flavor and texture were much better! {And of course I used the soy sauce, black vinegar,water and chili oil sauce from the "shrimp and pork pot stickers". I also added a little veg. oil to the sauce I thought it needed it.} To fry: put 1 tablespoon or so veg. oil in a nonstick pan, heat oil, place dumplings in, cook till golden on bottom about 2-3 min., add 1/2c. water, tilt pan to distribute water, cover, cook 7-10 min. till water evaporates and dumplings start to brown again. Remove and serve with sauce. Tasty.

My husband and I both thought these were a too chewy. The recipe requirest 8 oz. of round wanton wrappers I need ed the whole 14.7 oz package in order to use up all the filling this recipe makes. There is a type-O where it says "add the rice, wine,"etc. It's should say 'rice wine' no comma. The recipe doesnt specify how long to cook the dumplings. Was aggravating because I put a bunch of time into making these and I didn't want to under or over cook them. I couldnt use the cabbage, too stiff and curved. Instead I used silicone coated parchment paper which worked beautifully. As the recipe suggested I used a round 'cake rack' to place the dumplings on inside my extra large pan which I covered in order to steam. I used the cooking time from another Chinese dumpling recipe on Epicurious and steamed the dumplings for about 7-9 minutes. The resulting dumplings were a little tough and chewy but the flavor was good only as long as I used a sauce with them. Bland without sauce. I used sauce from the "Shrimp and Pork Pot Stickers" on this site. Tomorrow I will try a different cooking method to use up the rest of the raw filling and wantons. I will fry them in the manner suggested in the "Shrimp and Pork Pot Stickers" recipe on this site which involves some frying. I will try to review this again using the frying method. I will only keep this recipe if the frying method improves them.

These are very good! They are great at the table or before dinner, easy fairly quick if you chop fast! Keep them hot as they cool very fast! A chafing dish could work well here.

I am new at this but we loved it and I used the sauce from Tropical Spring rolls with chile sauce

Another one in my permanent recipe file. I love these. Nice delicate flavor, good texture. I make them in huge batches because they're even good the next day. Best dumpling recipe I've ever come across. I use the filling in pot-stickers, steamed dumplings, shu mai, and I roll it in rice and steam it for meat balls. It's super versatile and so good.

I really loved this and I added a tsp of minced garlic and 2 tsps of graded fresh ginger and 1/4 cup of minced bamboo shoots for more crunch!!! WOW, how good was that?!

Ignore the last rating. Must of not of had all the ingredients on hand; most people don't have rice wine etc. and substitute everything. This recipe is awesome and well worth the flavors from the mushrooms, cilantro and other "strange/hard-to-find" ingredients. Made with wild boar sausage meat. Don't use overtly seasoned sausage if you are going to substitute for the pork butt.

I made this as an appetizer for thanksgiving. For all of the work it took to make them, I thought they were a little bland. I would make a different recipe next time.

Made exactly according to receipt and they were delicious. Make sure the dumplings do not touch each other in the steamer or they stick together.

Lots of work, but it was great. I followed all the directions to a T.

Excellent! I omitted the mushrooms based on the preference of a guest, subbed in green onions for scallions. I also used square wonton wrappers instead of round and simply folded them like my mom had taught me. Still in search of a good dipping sauce, though...

These rule. Made them one night to try; my husband & I ate whole recipe. Made double for a party & got raves. I could only find square wrappers, & was much too impatient to cut in circles and master wrapping technique. I just filled and folded. Didn't hurt the taste a bit!

This is 'sui mai', and the recipe does taste like those served in dim sum restaurants. And I'm Chinese, so I really do know. :) Buy the thinnest wrappers! Never wkd w/ wrappers before, & unknowingly bought the thick kind. The exterior texture was really strange to me, as sui mai is not served this way.

Very easy to prepare and tasty. I prepared this recipe as an appetizer, and my guests thoroughly enjoyed them. I would make this recipe again.
