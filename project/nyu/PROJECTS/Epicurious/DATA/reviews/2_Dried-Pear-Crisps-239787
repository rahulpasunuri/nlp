The ginger makes these quite lovely. For convenience sake, I let mine cool in the oven, and they went from slightly chewy to quite crispy in that time, which was great.

Very disappointing. Chewy (not in a good way) and not very flavorful.

Delicious and healthy w/a sweet flavor. They were gone before I could transfer them to a serving dish.
