Yummy! I made this with the Slow Roasted Pork with Lime Mojo. I'll definitely be using this recipe again, and matching it with other dishes. I did cut the cubes of squash a little smaller than the recipe called for, to cut down on cooking time.

I've made this twice, and both times it was a big hit. The second time it accompanied a non-Latin, chicken dinner, and I was concerned it would be too spicy, but it went great with that entree also, and the spices were delicious, not overpowering. Once the Latin Spice Mix is made up, keep it in a plastic container for quick future recipes.

This went well (both in taste and color) with the pork loin with Lime Mojo sauce -- a great way to spice up squash.

I made this (along with the Slow Roasted Pork with Lime Mojo sauce) twice. My guests just raved about it. It definately adds a wonderful flavor to the squash.

Very nice recipe. The Latin Spice Mix is very good.
