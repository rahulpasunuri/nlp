as others have noted, the dough is fragile. We broke it into quarters and just worked to get out about 6 at a time. We used a smallish gingerbread guy and so got 22 out of the one mix. We did double the ginger. Why not? Yum. Kids totally approve of taste at both stages: dough and cookie.

great cookies. i usually add more ginger and allspice than what is noted in the recipe. also, i love molasses so i am liberal with it as well. the dough gets soft quickly, work with a small bit at a time. keep a close eye on them in the oven, the arms and legs burn quickly.

Good, but not the best gingerbread cookie. It needed a little...something. My kids had a great time decorating them.

Keep the dough in the freezer whilst you are working with a small bit. It really softens-up quickly. Would add a little bit more ginger next time. My cookies were done in 8mins! Beware in a preheated oven they didn't take long at all! Very tasty.

The cookie dough is delicious but is fragile until baked. I put it in the freezer several times during the cutting and shaping process to make it firmer. A fun Halloween treat.
