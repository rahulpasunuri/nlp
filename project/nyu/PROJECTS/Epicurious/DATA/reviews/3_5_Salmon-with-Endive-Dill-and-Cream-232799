My family really enjoyed this, but I have to say this is not a repeater. The sauce was not a favorite at all, but since my family liked it, I'm giving it 3 stars. Too many salmon recipes out there to waste on this one.

I've made this recipe 3 times... only change I ever made is using half and half. It's easy to half or double depending on how many I served. Simple yet elegant. This is a becoming a regular meal in our home! Love it!

This was a fantastic dish and a huge hit with the picky parents. Used the ingredients to a tee and must say the endive was just right. We probably used about 3/4 of the cream sauce but only because there was so much left over.

Very tasty and easy to do. Just made half the recipe for me and my husband. I like the flavor of the dill a lot and my husband likes anything that's creamy. Substitute endive with baby bok choy, just like the other reviewer did because did not have that on hand. No other changes made. Next time will definitely make it with endive.

I cut the recipe in half because there is just the two of us and it still worked (but I didn't cut down on the wine). My picky fiance liked it. I like anything with cream.

Excellent - made it twice. Easy - tasty and we don't eat a lot of tish but would recommend. Did not make any substitutions.

Truly delicious and easy to make. The salmon took more than 6 minutes to broil though, but I guess it depends on the thickness of the fillet.

My boyfriend & I made this for lunch today--between the two of us, almost no work at all--and a delicious outcome! This is a wonderful blend of flavors, fresh & clean. Very tasty.

This is so fast, easy and delish! Everyone I've made it for has loved it.

Necessity is the mother of invention. I substituted tilipia for the salmon, leeks and baby bok choy for the endive and shallots. I kept the cream and wine. 5 minutes under my broiler left the fish half cooked; I baked it at 350.

It came out ok but, the sauce wasn't that smooth. Maybe because I used half/half instead of cream. I have other salmon recipes that I would prepare before this one.

tasty as can be!

The whole family and guests raved over the sauce. The slight bitterness of the endive married perfectly with the salmon.

This was very tasty and gave the salmon a nice, mild flavor. I made this with escarole instead of endive, and next time I cook the greens less to add more texture to the dish. I loved the smell of the shallots, olive oil and white wine, I will definitely use that as a base for a sauce more often.
