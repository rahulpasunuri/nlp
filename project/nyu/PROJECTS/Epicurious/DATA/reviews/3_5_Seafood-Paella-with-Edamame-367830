Very easy to make. I had to adjust real time since what was supposed to be roast leg of lamb became "what can I do with what I've got for company that doesn't like lamb". So here are my subs, additions and omissions: No edamame -substituted peas No green pepper - substituted more red pepper. Had extra fresh tomatoes on hand - used them instead of canned. Had 1 cup of clam juice on hand - paired that to 1 cup of chicken stock. No arborio - used TJ's mahogany rice blend. Used 1 lb of TJ's frozen mixed seafood, which included shrimp, scallops and squid. Our company and I were rather pleased despite un-paella-esque (got brown/red from the rice) color and a negligible yearning for the rice to be more crispy. Perhaps there's a method that I missed/omitted which would have yielded more authentic results? Regardless, this one's a keeper.

Very good. Whole family enjoyed it and like it even more when they found out it had so little fat. Made as directed except used medium grain rice instead of short gran rice.

I loved this recipe. I really thought it would just be a good Tuesday night dish but we just finished half of it in one sitting and we aren't big people! I am not a fan of shrimp so I but a half a pound of Chorizo I picked up at the butchers and it really added a nice kick to this dish. I did everything else as the recipe calls for.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought the edamame added some great texture and the color of the dish overall was pleasing to the eye. I did not use scallops or saffron threads due to availability and expense but I don't think that detracted from the dish. I would definitely make it again!

I made this as directed except substituted chicken for scallops. I just thought it was lacking something, It was better the next day so maybe the flavors just need to meld a little.

I used fresh tomatoes instead, and upped the amount as well. Realized I didnt have garlic so that was left out, and subbed chicken for the seafood. So maybe I didn't make it exactly as written but the flavours were great!!! Looove saffron!

this sounds great, but i'm allergic to bell peppers. Does anyone have a suggestion for tasty substitution?

Made this recipe with a few changes and it was amazing, so light and refreshing. I used fresh instead of canned tomatoes and used 2 times the recommended dose. I also would recommend to season the scallops with some salt and pepper before as they were a tiny bit bland and also think they could of benefited from being seared a bit. Future recommendations: I think adding muscles or a tough white fish like cod would taste great. And also if you like it spicy add some spicy sauce Overall: A great meal

Tried this new recipe for my best friend's birthday. This was risky since there were no reviews and my friend is a great cook. Loved the edamame instead of peas and seafood instead of chicken or sausage. Everyone loved it and I did not substitute. I used frozen scallops and shrimp and saffron from a recent trip to Spain. It has been added to our family favorite recipe list!
