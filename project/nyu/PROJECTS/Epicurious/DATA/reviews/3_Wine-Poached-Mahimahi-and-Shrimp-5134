I tried this recipe, making the recommended adjustments regarding the wine/clam juice mix, and I was very disappointed. The reduced poaching liquid/sauce was bitter, and it ruined the taste of the fish.

I cut the recipe in half, and all three of us agreed that it was outstanding. The fennel, capers and arugala was a perfect match. We agreed that this dish would bring us back to a fine restaurant if served there.

Would never make this again. The clam juice made the mahimahi taste and smell "fishier". The end result was bland and boring (except for the clammy, fishy smell). I also poached it for half the recommended time, and the fish was overcooked. Very disappointed, especially after reading the previous rave reviews.

Super recipe.I would definately make it again. I followed the suggestion of others and cut down on the clam juice and increased the wine. Will definately make this for company. The shrimp was a nice presentation but not totally necessary.

Great dish. I did follow others suggestion to cut down the clam juice and increase the wine so it wasn't as salty. This dish is great especially with the fennel underneath. I'll make that apart from this dish as a side as well.

I gave this recipe 3 forks on what I think it could be not on what it is. It has a major flaw as written. When 3 cups of clam juice are boiled down, it's very, very salty. It was close enough to being good that I'd do it again perhaps using more wine, some clam juice and some low salt chicken broth. It's low cal and has a lot of potential.
