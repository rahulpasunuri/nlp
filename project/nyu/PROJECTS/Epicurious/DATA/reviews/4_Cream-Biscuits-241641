These were the easiest biscuits I have ever made, and they really are delicious. I've halfed the recipe and they came out fine. I'll make them again, but considering how much fat goes into them I'll only be making them on special occasions. Oh, and I didn't make my own baking powder, but I will try that next time.

I was surprised to see only 78% would make these again. They are light and wonderful. I served them at our Easter Dinner and they were enjoyed by all.

Loved this recipe - it is the first biscuit recipe that I have made that did not come out like hockey pucks!

everything about the biscuits are great except the amount of salt. I would cut it in half.

Delicious and easy to make! This was my first exposure to cream biscuits, and I found the taste to be perfectly rich. My batch fluffed up and browned nicely, thanks to the tips for keeping the edges and middles of the biscuits from sealing. I did not try the homemade baking powder recipe, but my store bought brand is all natural without aluminum and tasted fine. I made these for breakfast with a thick vegetarian mushroom gravy. The biscuits really held their own against the heavy gravy. If I were looking for a biscuit to accompany a non-saucy meal, I would probably look for a lighter, flakier recipe. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the way these turned out.

Good biscuits are not hard to make and shouldn't be scary. However, these are NOT flaky enough or tender enough. For a quick buttermilk biscuit,go for Jeff Smith's recipe where the biscuits are baked in a cast-iron skillet. For cream biscuits,the sweet-cream biscuits on this website are a better bet.

I am not a novice biscuit baker, but I wanted to use up the cream in the fridge so I made these, thinking they would be as good or better than my mom's cream biscuits. Boy, was I wrong! In my opinion, these had no flavor, they were very disappointing. My husband hated them, and I even added a touch of sugar to the dough as when I tasted the raw product, they were tasteless and flat. Yuck! I wish they had "zero" forks as an option, because I don't even think these were "ok". I definitely won't make these again as they were a waste of expensive ingredients.

My first exposure to Cream Biscuits, much richer than a standard biscuit. These baked up much taller, flakier and browner than the picture...gorgeous! I wish I could submit my picture. Due to the high amount of fat in the recipe, they taste very buttery and added butter for serving is overly rich. Nice for a change or special meal, but I would not make these to serve everyday. I prefer flaky layers with a bit more chew. The flakiness in these is somewhat akin to a flaky pastry. Chef's homemade baking powder is great and non- bitter.

This is absolutely a great recipe and anyone can do it. I handed it to my 18 yr old college son and told him to make them. He has never made anything but store bought bread. They turned out great!

I have tried for 43 years to make biscuits and all attempts for a good bicuit had failed. I followed your recipe last night and they were wonderful and so delicious. My husbands comment was "FINALLY". Thank you for the easy and wonderful recipe.

I just made these last night - amazing!! It was my first attempt at biscuit making, and they're very easy with a few modifications (a la Alton Brown's baking book): FREEZE the butter solid, then coarsely grate it in a box grater set right over the flour mixture. Toss the flour to coat all the butter flakes, then rub everything for no more than 40 seconds. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and they were phenomenal. Served with French Lentil Soup from this site - yum!
