I liked this, but it does need a bit more dressing for the amount of salad/vegies. Easy to make, but I used cumin instead of cayan pepper as I am not a spicy food person.

I liked the combination of vegetable but they overpowered the dressing. It wasn't tangy enough.

yum, yum, yum. i love vegetables so this salads was heaven. The dressing is very good. I bought low-fat yogurt (it was all I could find in the grocery store!) so it was pretty healthy.
