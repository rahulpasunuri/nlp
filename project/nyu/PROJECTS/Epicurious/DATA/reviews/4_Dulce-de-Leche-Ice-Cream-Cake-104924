Yummy yum yum! Very delicious and unique. It was both refreshing and rich. I would make this again and again.I made it almost as the recipe specifies. Here are the minor changes I made.I made the crust mixture and felt like there was barely enough to cover the bottom of my 10 " springform, so I made half of the crust recipe and added the mixture to it. For the finished product this amount of crust was the perfect. Next time I might freeze the crust before applying the first layer of ice cream as it was a bit crumbly. I did not add sugar to the strawberries because they were sweet on there own plus I was going to be drizzling caramel sauce over them. It was a little spendy and time consuming but well worth the effort, especially for something special. I can't wait to try it with other ice cream flavor combinations.

Wonderful, wonderful dessert. Made it just as written and I'm just waiting for an excuse to make it again. All the flavors work together beautifully.

This is such a light and refreshing dessert. And it tastes great! I also love that it can be made days ahead of time. I made it for Easter and it was devoured.

i changed almost everything due to availability and cost, but it worked very well. vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers, walnuts instead of hazel, also used vanilla bean ice cream and rasberry sorbet instead. Everyone loved it!

Incredibly easy and very delicious. The hazelnuts are a nice twist on the crust. You could easily use other flavors of ice cream.

I needed a great dessert to bring over to my boyfriends parents house, and so after reading the reviews I decided on this dessert. I went to the store and found that Haigen Dauz (or however you spell it!) was the only brand that carried Dulce de Leche ice cream and got it... I went on to look for Strawberry sorbet and couldn't find any so instead I got a tropical sorbet. And instead of hazelnuts I used black walnuts. This recipe was easy to follow and I scored major points and many request to bring it again! (this is coming from a Southern black family that loves to eat!) Believe it or not, shortly after dessert I was proposed to by my boyfriend! Maybe it was the cake!!! lol!

I have been making this recipe ever since it appeared in Bon Appetit and it has NEVER failed to garner rave reviews. I sometimes use raspberry sorbet instead of strawberry but they are both fabulous. This recipe really delivers for very little work.

My husband wanted ice cram cake for his birthday and this was it. I ended up making the ice cream (Claudia Fleming's The Last Course's caramel) and it was delicious. But pairing it with strawberry didn't work -- the strawberry completely covered the caramel taste. You might as well use vanilla ice cream. A chocolate gelato would work, though.

This was so good--and SO easy! My father-in-law said it was the best dessert he's ever had. I especially loved the crust. I even found myself scraping out the food processor with a spoon, and eating the last possible crumb mixture! The strawberry and the caramel were a nice combination in the final dessert.

This is great! I love this recipe. I had to use a caramel ice cream (similar) as dulce de leche wasn't available, and it was outstanding. I made this for a wedding, along with three other ice cream cakes off this website, mocha crunch, turtle, and a (ick) vegan chocolate soy ice cream cake that I made up for a special diet request) it presents well, and tastes wonderful, a huge hit.

I couldn't find good quality strawberry sherbert, so used Haagen Daas mango sherbert instead (leaving out the strawberries). It was (I think) just as good, and I'm inspired to experiment with other flavour combinations.

I have made this many times and it always comes out perfectly. Everyone loves it and it can be made well ahead of time. Some have commented that they leave out the strawberries, but I think they give the striped slice a nice finish. If you can, find REAL Dulce de Leche sauce (available at Latin grocery stores) to go on top. YUMMMMMMM!

This was a hit on Mother's Day. The combination of strawberry sorbet and caramel ice cream is an inspiration, and the crust is like the best buttery, nutty cookie you've ever tasted. Be careful when creating the layers to completely soften the ice cream an dsorbet first and not to press down too much or you'll create wavy layers.

I made this for Easter and it was a HUGE success. Everyone raved about it. It looked beautiful and tasted incredible. A good alternative to a chocolate dessert. Not difficult to make, just takes time given that you let each layer completely before adding the next. A definite winner.

Made this for a baby shower and received many compliments. Am anxious to try it using different flavor ice creams. I did not freeze cake for the full time between each layer, but it still turned out fine.

Used pecans instead of hazelnuts, and raspberry instead of strawberry... and it was delicious! Next time I will try parchment under the crust, as it was a bit difficult to remove from pan. Really beautiful results though...

What can I say...totally orgasmic. I made this for my son's bday party. There was not one person out of 30 that didn't freak over it. Only bad thing is no leftovers.... I bought the "milky way " bottled topping...drizzled over entire cake snd garnished with the berries.

You should have lots of space in your freezer beforehand. It's very easy although time consuming. Everyone LOOOOOVEd it though. It does get a bit expensive. I'd probably cut down the recipe and make it in a loaf pan for smaller groups. I definitely recommend it.

This is just delicious -- everyone loved it. Yes,as one reviewer said, it is just layers of ice cream -- but really good ice cream, and the combination is unusual -- I would never have thought to put dulce de leche and strawberry sorbet together -- and you can't discount the crust -- my husband said it was the best part. This desert is rich and refreshing at the same time -- perfect for summer. And absolutely easy to make. I would say it's worth the cost, but luckily my grocery store was having a buy one get one free sale on Edy's Dreamery and Whole Fruit Sorbet. And it can easily serve more than 16. Oh, one other thing, I skipped the strawberries and caramel sauce part and didn't miss it -- it was great on it's own.

I have made this dessert for a ladies lunch and a baby shower--to rave reviews! The whole thing just disappeared--people came back for seconds and thirds. It is a little pricey, but worth it. And it's very easy to do ahead. I'm making it again for Mother's Day for a real "foodie" crowd so we'll see how they like it!

I've made this twice for my grandaughter's birthday and everyone loved it -- but I agree with the reviewer who said there's nothing special about it -- just a lot of layers of icecream. Also, what really constitutes a whole graham cracker? A square, a sheet, two squares? I'd be curious to know if everyone else knows exactly what a whole graham cracker is. I don't think it can be a square because that doesn't cover the entire bottom of the pan.

I was really disappointed in this dessert. It wasn't an inexpensive dessert to make, and I felt it was just really ordinary. There are some good frozen dessert recipes on this site, but this isn't one of them.

Made this for Mothers day and it was a hit. Yes it took some time, but worth it. I did not use hazelnuts - i used almonds and it worked out fine. I would however next time try to find Guava ice cream/sorbet in the Latin American markets for a true Latin experience. Dulce de leche/Manjar blanco and Guava paste eaten together is a classic Colombian/Latin combination for dessert. I also melted a bit of guava paste and created a circle and placed this guava circle between layers - it was a nice suprize on the palette. Que Rico!!

This dessert is decadent and sooo easy. I served it at a wedding shower dinner and received raves. Even the people that initially turned down dessert couldn't resist the mmmmm's from the crowd. Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time to prepare. I started a couple days out, made the crust and got the first layer of ice cream on. Then when I had time added each of the other layers. It also keeps beautifully in the freezer.

Made this for father's day. EVERYONE loved it. It looks impressive. I used about 3/4 pint of the strawberry for those layers. I highly reccomend drizzling with the caramel sauce, that semed to be everyones favorite part. VERY easy, although a bit time consuming. Absolutely DELICIOUS!

Excellent! I used Haagen Dazs dulce de leche frozen yogurt instead of ice cream (to cut fat and calories) and the results were wonderful. Would be good with other flavors, like vanilla ice cream and orange sorbet . . . just like a creamsicle!

Made this two weeks ago and everyone loved it! I used Haagen Daz Dulce De Leche and Edie's Strawberry Sorbet.The strawberry flavor overpowered the rest of the flavors but noone really cared because it tasted soooooo good! The sweetened strawberries were nice to serve along side but everyone agreed that the caramel sauce was unnecessary. By the way, the hazelnut crust was very good as well.

Spectacular finish to a special Mother's Day Brunch! Lovely to look at, and delicious to eat. Sweet/tart contrast is great. As noted by others, speed is necessary for serving; have your knife, hot water, and serving plates ready to go. Planning to make again using other flavor combinations!

This dessert was time consuming but fantastic. I didn't have the time to hunt for hazelnuts so substituted pecans instead. The results were still magnificent. I planned on making this for Mother's Day and since it was just for my family, I actually cut the recipe in half, only using 2 pints of dulce de leche ice cream. For the sorbet, I used Dreyer's Strawberry sorbet which comes in 1.5 pints. I ended up using all of this, instead of just 1 pint, which would have been exactly half of what the recipe called for. Most probably the dessert had more of a fresh strawberry flavor than ice cream but was still delicious. Definitely a keeper to impress company!

"This is the best ice-cream cake I've ever had", my guests told me. I made it for my mother's birthday, and she loved it. It's easy, but takes a while to pull togeher-- make it the day before, if possible. Use a light hand when spreading the ice cream, especially on the first layer. I got a bit of crust in the ice cream. The cake did not look quite like the masterpiece on the cover of Bon Appetit, but it WAS good. I used Haagen Daaz dulce de leche, too.

Dulce de Leche is caramel ice cream. You can find this flavor in Haagen Daaz. This dessert is oh my god fantastic. My guests almost licked their plates! It is time consuming but very easy. The crust is the best I've ever had. I can't wait to make it again!

I also made this for Easter. Not only was it the perfect dessert (my would-be-mother-in-law is the reigning pie champ, so I never want to make a pie...), it was GORGEOUS. Cut quickly; dip knife in hot water. Timing is key in the serving process, but so, so good. Epicurious should really have a picture of it -- it's so beautiful!

I made this recipe along with the Tropical Lime Torte with Mango Compote for Easter which was also in the April 2001 issue. We were having 18 people and it was great to have both of these make ahead dessert recipes prepared. They were both hits. The ice cream was extremely frozen and hard to cut at first but I dipped my knife in hot water to get it started. Delicious & refreshing.
