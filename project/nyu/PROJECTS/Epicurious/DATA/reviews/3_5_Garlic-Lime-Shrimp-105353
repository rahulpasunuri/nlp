I have made this several times as written and it was good but not great. Last night I decided to change it up just a bit. I followed the recipe except I added less Worcestershire sauce. I only added about 1 teaspoon. I also added some fresh lime juice at the end, I just squeezed half a lime over it. I also decided to add 2 Tablesoons chopped cilantro rather than Italian parsley. Of course I added Kosher salt to taste. It was SO much better!! Lime and Cilantro just go together so well in my opinion. Certainly if you have an aversion to cilantro stick with the parsley.

We eat a lot of shrimp so are always looking for something different. This was yummy. I peeled about 1/2 lb local small/medium shrimp for 2 of us. I also used only 2 T butter but kept the rest of the measurements. Served it over rice, pouring the left over juice over the rice and shrimp. I think I'll try this as a stir fry with cabbage and may try it with olive oil instead of butter.

I really loved this. Made it with corn on the cob as suggested and thought it was perfect. I will definitely make it again. The only problem is I should have made morel

Really yummy. No fault to the recipe, would have been better if I had served with rice or over pasta.

This is good, just not fabulous. My husband and son (age 13) both rated it a 5 on a scale of one to ten, meaning that if I have leftover shrimp, I would make this again, but I wouldn't make a special effort to buy shrimp and make this.

My boyfriend and I peeled the shrimp completly before putting it in the pan. Also, instead of cayenne pepper we used chili powder. Once all completed, squeeze the juice of about half a lime and a teaspoon of lemon juice over the cooked shrimp- YUMM!!!! Also, we didn't use the salt and pepper- the juices were perfect.

This is one of those great recipes that's combines facility with quality. It takes no effort to make, contains ingredients that happen to be around the house, and combines simple flavors into one yummy main course. Definitely a keeper. The only reason I give it 3 forks is because it's not the kind that makes you sit back from your meal and say, WOW. It just makes you pleased with your meal in an un-overwhelmed way.

It was great, but I would change a few things: 1) half the butter, sub in EVOO 2) Marinate SHELLED, deveined shrimp in all ingredients sans oil while extra garlic is sauteeing in the oil. 3) Add a little cilantro, fresh if you have it. 4) I don't know about the sugar. I like a little more of a savory flavor.

I make this all the time for dinner (on rice or pasta with sugar snap peas, carrots, and red pepper strips) or as an appetizer with french bread rounds to dip in the sauce. Easy and delicious

Just made this recipe for a dinner party. I doubled the ingredients, increased the cayenne pepper and decreased the butter (used half olive oil and half butter -- but didn't double the amount). Also peeled the shrimp except for the tails for easy eating. It definitely got raves. Served it with orzo and roasted vegetables for a more "fall/winter" flair. Easy and full of flavor.

This was quite good and quick -- perfect for summer. I cut down on the Worcestire sauce by 1/2 tsp. The lemon and lime gave it a great citrus-y tang - I was suprised how well the flavors blended. I served it over white rice. Good for a weeknight supper.

So easy to make and quick! Even my five year old son loved it! I peeled my shrimp before cooking and served the shrimp with angle hair pasta and good crusty bread. The lime zest and fresh lemon juice make the dish. Will make it again.

have made this dish several times and always gets rave reviews. Have done it with cooked and uncooked shrimp, modifying cooking time, etc. for cooked shrimp. Start with quality shrimp and this is a dish that will be gone in minutes. I added Valentina hot sauce, approx. 2 Tbl. and was pleasantly surprised with no shock of too much heat. Great addition. Luv it!

A tasty recipe that is easy to make! I used only half of the butter, though, and I peeled about 25 medium-sized shrimp instead of large shrimp in shells. There was still plenty of sauce in the dish. I would definitely make this again.

YUM! Very tasty! Easy to make (coming from me, this is huge. I never cook). Light and very flavorful. Add extra lime zest and garlic. For those on restricted sugar diets - I used Sweet & Low instead of sugar. I also peeled the shrimp first. Fabulous! Make it tonight!

Great dish! I even tried it over angel hair pasta and it made the pasta very flavorful. I always deshell the shrimp so that more of the flavor is retained in the shrimp.

I made this dish recently and everyone in my house loved the flavors. My advice is just to cook the shrimp without shells - it still gets great flavor and this way, you can eat immediately without having to worry about all the peeling. I would definitely make it again.

Maybe my expectations were too high from all the glowing reviews, but this was OK. Good. Not much more thrilling than that. It's definitely not citrus-y as someone else also mentioned, more sweet-sour.

This was delicious and easy to make-you must absolutely use shelled shrimp--who wants to peel and eat?!?!

It was Excellent! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used fine African Hot Pepper(a super tip) and a little extra, at that. I placed the shrimp dish and it's juices over a bed of shredded lettuce with slices of Mango(another great tip)! I didn't have crusty bread so I used lightly buttered(or margarine) Arnold's 12 Grain Bread slices toasted from the oven. WOW! Almost like homemade.

I was looking for a quick recipe for shrimp for my salad. I made this dish and found it quite tasty. I sprained the sauce and added the shrimp to my salad. I also added mushrooms, fresh asparagus that I blanched and cooled, a little blue cheese, and a light vinegrete. Yum!

With all of the conflicting comments about sugar or no sugar, etc. I decided to make the recipe as posted with no variation. It was delicious, it was not too sweet. I served it over jasmine rice, very easy.

Rating: 4
I've been meaning to try this and decided to do so with the last few negative comments. I didn't put in the sugar, per Panama City. Also substituted red pepper flakes for the cayenne. And I just hate to waste the shrimp shells, so I reduced about 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/4 cup white wine with the shells. I strained this into the butter and garlic mixture. It was a little runny so I combined about 1 tablespoon white wine with 1 tablespoon cornstarch, added it to the sauce and it thickened quite well. Served this over pasta and it was very good.

This was just OK and we LOVE shrimp. The recipe was easy enough with ingredients on hand but I fail to see why so many people thought it was great. There are other shrimp recipes we like much better.

This dish was very ordinary. The sugar and worchestershire sauce did not add to the flavors. My family prefers the classic shrimp dish made with just butter, garlic, lemon, salt, pepper and parsley.

I thought this dish was pretty blah. I'll admit I didn't have the lime but I don't think that would have made much difference. I didn't like the sweet taste so I wouldn't add the sugar and if you like the sauce, you need to double the recipe. Also made the fiery skewered shrimp recipe on this site and thought it was delicious.

This only took me about 15 minutes to prepare, and I already had most of the ingredients in stock, which impresses me. My husband said that this was the best tasting shrimp he's ever tasted! And I make a lot of shrimp. This one is definitely a keeper. I'll try it next time over linguine.

This took no more than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great! Can't beat that combination in our household. The lime zest was a nice change from lemon and we didn't find it bitter. Maybe some of the reviewers are using too course zest. A keeper for sure.

Rating: 3
Although somehow I had expected this to taste different, perhaps more garlic/citrus, rather than sweet/sour with a bit of Worcestershire overtone, it was very good. I used lime juice rather than lemon, as I hated to use part of each! I also thought that my pinch of cayenne could have been larger, even though I thought it generous, to give it a little more zip. I served this over angel hair pasta. Even the kids were fighting over the last shrimp! Definitely a keeper! It's easy and will certainly lend itself to variations.

Rating: 3
Although I thought this was a really nice and easy dinner , I thought the lime zest a little bitter. Next time I'll use lime juice instead of the zest. I doubled the recipe and didn't have any trouble like a previous review encountered. Also followed recommendations to serve with corn on the cob and really liked the combination.

This os one of those rare recipes that didn't need much tinkering. I used smaller shrimp and shelled them before cooking. I cooked the 3-year-old's portion first. Once his was out of the pan, I added some minced habenero, a little extra garlic, and the rest of the shrimp. The habenero added a sweet/fresh flavor and heated things up nicely without overpowering the dish. I served with crusty bread, the last corn on the cob of the season, and good beer. There were just enough leftovers to make a nice "warm shrimp salad" sandwich for lunch the next day.

My husband and I loved this. I shelled the shrimp and served it over rice. I think next time I will try cutting down on the butter a little...we used about 15 large shrimp and there was LOTS of sauce.Quick and yummy.

I have been searching for a recipe similar to this. My boyfriend and I had "Shrimp Picante" at Southern Accent in Toronto and this recipe is the closest we've come to replicating that appetizer. We realized we forgot the sugar all along. I also added more cayenne, as we like the dish extra hot. We are missing one more ingredient as the dish is quite red and soupy at Southern Accent.

Haven't tried this yet, but sounds great. Just thought I'd give my thoughts to the previous cook from Littleton, Co. I would suggest using fresh lemon juice(it really does make a difference) and fresh minced garlic. Oh, and make sure when you zest your lime not to get any of that bitter white part(icky!) My dishes seem much better when I'm able to use fresh ingredients. I'll be giving this recipe a try soon. Good luck and happy cooking(and eating!)

I WANT to like this recipe, and I want to try it again. BUT what did I do wrong?? (It's not that hard!) It smelled great, and the first taste was great. But it left a horribly bitter aftertaste that ruined the whole thing. Please, some of you experts out there, please tell me what to do differently next time--I used real butter, lemon juice from a bottle, minced garlic from a jar, shrimp that was shelled, and no parsley. Nothing that should have made any difference, I would have thought . . .

this was a superb shrimp dish for the time it took. We served right over jasmine rice with the extra sauce drizzled over, and also with corn on the cob. We then made the dish for two guests and the recipe didn't triple well at all (bland and buttery). Definitely DO NOT triple the butter! I'm making this meal again tonight, the third time in two weeks...so it's certainly yummy enough! Do try this recipe.

To peel or not to peel. Is that the question? Well, the answer lies with your own preference. The shells add a considerably deeper taste of shrimp. And the mess? Just adds to the fun of this dish! Crusty bread, short sleeves & napkins a must! M! M! M!!

Delicious and easy. Leave the shells on, roll up your sleeves and dig in. Even as the shrimps cool, the flavor is wonderful. I used red pepper flakes for just the right amount of spice. I will make this again and again. I served it with rice and nice French chablis. Thanks!

My husband and I work long hours every week. So, we're always on the lookout for quick meals to make at home. This is a keeper! We even used peeled, deveined, frozen shrimp to cut down the prep time, and extra-virgin olive oil (with a few tablespoons of butter) to cut some of the fat. Delicious with crusty bread to soak up the sauce.
