Easy, quick, tasty and healthy! What more could you want? I served it with glazed carrots and it was a pretty presentation,too!

Really delicious, simple and quick. What more could you ask for? The only thing I added was some lemon to the halibut after the pesto. I will make this again and again.

Nice and easy! I made a garlic scape pesto which worked perfectly with the halibut and arugla. when in season garlic scapes make a wonderful pesto.

My wife picked this for her Mothers Day dinner and it was outstanding. I used purchased pesto and followed the recipe as written. It was both delicious and a beautiful dish on the plate. I am sure that we will be serving this often.

I didn't have time to use the grill, so I roasted the halibut at 450 degrees. That worked out fine. An easy, tasty recipe so long as you have pesto handy.

Excellent! We made it a second time with salmon and couldn't decide which one was better.

I just happened to have arugula and pesto in the fridge, both of which needed to be eaten and soon, so this recipe was a real find. We were late getting home and hungry. It was bitterly cold out, so decided not to grill, but roast the halibut instead. I sliced up some leftover polenta and brushed it with olive oil and topped it with a little parmesan cheese. I brushed the pesto on the halibut, then popped both in the oven at 400 for 10 - 15 minutes. Meanwhile prepped the arugula salad. Honestly, it was one of the quickest meals I've ever prepared and delicious as well. Perfest weeknight meal.

Quick and easy. Great for a midweek meal. My first time making pesto and it was a hit.

I've made this several times and everyone always loves it. To make it even simpler, I use purchased pesto, organic arugula in a bag. It can be made in just a few minutes and the presentation always looks great. I also have made it with swordfish.

Just served this at a dinner party tonight to rave reviews. I used swordfish, which went very nicely with both the pesto and the arugula.

really fantastic dish, great contrast with the pesto - I made it with the grilled asparagus and grill zucchini and mint and served it with a slice of toasted french bread - the green and white presentation was beautiful!!

Quick, easy and it tastes great too. What's not to love?

This was fantastic...the peppery arugula went nicely with the pesto 'glazed' halibut. I used lemon infused extra virgin olive oil only to dress the arugula and it didn't need anythigng more. I would definitely do this again!

Very good and easy to prepare - made no substitutions. Really nice presentation. Served a side of polenta with basil and pine nuts. Paired well with Sancerre.

Great, simple recipe for summer. The pesto is a really nice complement to the halibut. I served the fish on the salad with rice next to it.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was the perfect end-of-summer bar-b-que, using arugula and basil from the garden. The pesto on the fish contrasted perfectly with the lemony vinagrette on the arugula. Yum.

My husband and I made this last night with the halibut we caught in Alaska. Superb! We added oven roasted tomatoes as a side dish which was a real flavor booster to the dish. It took a bit longer to grill the halibut and there was some sticking to the grill despite the coating of olive oil. Next time we'll also oil the grill. This recipe is a keeper.

Living in Alaska, where fresh Halibut and Salmon are almost always available, we are always looking for new ways to prepare them. Especially Halibut, which has a lovely texture but not much flavor. This dish was so delicious; the fresh basil pesto and the bitterness of the accompanying arugula was a great combination. I added some sliced strawberries and blueberries to the salad and the color/presentation was gorgeous. It is so easy too-I will definitely consider this for a dinner party.

Sadly, this recipe is much less than the sum of its parts. Much anticipated ( it was the first meal my amorata and I cooked together ) it failed to impress - and we couldn't understand why. Fragrant homemade pesto and uberfresh fish combined to make blah. Any hints to improve it? Luckily the evening picked up after dinner...

My picky husband LOVED this dish! It was fantastic! They didn't have arugula at the store so I substituted watercress. YUM!
