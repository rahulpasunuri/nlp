This was really quite good. I am more of a cook than a baker but it worked for me and i found the recipe user friendly enough. I adapted my own recipe for apricot tart a few months ago and i have made it twice since because it is so easy and tasty! Recipe here: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/06/nk-bakes-easy-apricot-blackberry.html?m=0 I may try adding the pistachio to mine. That part is ingenious.

This was a home run. I made it with aprticots that I had hand-picked fresh from the farm. I made the filling using only almonds and used fig jam for the glaze. It doesn't matter, this recipe is to-die-for GOOD. Everyone at the dinner party raved.

This tart was sensational! I have to confess, I didn't have pistachios so I didn't add them and I sprinkled sliced almonds over the top instead of adding them to the frangipane. I froze the tart and warmed it for a few minutes before serving and it was still delicious. I'm going to try it next with plums since apricot season is done!

I found this just ok. I thought that the filling came out a bit greasy. I made my own crust because I have one that I like. But I don't imagine that changed anything too drastically.

I have made this tart a few times. It's so quick and easy to make - I have used canned apricots when fresh are not available; also fresh peaches work well. I don't like super-sweet desserts, and this is perfect for me and my guests. Everyone loves it.

I had a few problems with this recipe. It is not a classic frangipane by the way but that is OK. The crust needed more liquid than the one egg yolk, not a problem for someone who has mde inumberable crusts. The filling was also too dry, I threw in a little bit of almond paste that I had leftover and another egg and it was just soft enough to work in the tart shell. There should have been a mention of pie weights (I use white beans) for crust baking (1/2 the time). If I were to make the filling again I would add more eggs, maybe a little flour, maybe a little cream too? It was too dense. It was however enjoyed despite it's faults.

This tart is delicious. I didn't have pistachios so just used almonds. The flavor was outstanding. The appearance was only so-so. I think next time I would lower the heat to 350 and cook a little longer because my got too brown on top before the time was up. ANd the apricots sank in a little too much. I didn't glaze it because I like it to look a little more rustic and thought it didn't need the extra sweetness. But I did love the flavors!

I was not overly impressed with this tart. Everyone said is was delicious, it did have a nice flavor but was not as smooth as other frangipane tarts I've had. I might not have ground the nuts fine enough. There weren't any leftovers so my guests enjoyed it.

This was the first tart I attepmted. It was simply amazing! The second timm I made it I used pears as apricots were out of season and it was fantastic. Fan thinly sliced pear halves onto frngipane tightly. Fabulous!

Unbelievable. So delicious. It's a project, but well worth it. Just make sure your dining partners like pistachios and apricots. :) Truly excellent.

Very good taste! However, the frangipane was a bit under cooked in the center. I'm assuming it was from the fresh fruit juices. The edges where fine and perfectly baked.I baked it at 375 for 55 minutes. Has anyone else had this problem. I have eaten lots of frangipane in my life and I know that it should be more cakelike. Do I need to add flour to the nut mixture?? Any tips would be great! Thank you!

This tart definitely needs curing time. I made it at 5:00 p.m. and served it at 9:30. It was good but cloyingly sweet even thought I'd cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. I had the leftover piece for breakfast and it was magnificent. All the flavors had a chance to make themselves known and the crust, which was superb, did not get soggy.

The recipe was great and had a wonderful unusual flavor. The part that me was that it required two sticks of butter which made it quite rich. I will makt it and substitute plums, peaches or other fresh fruit.

Did anyone find it too sweet? I mean, deliciously sinfully sweet, but maybe a tad too much?

Had to keep from eating the filling out of the bowl! 55 mins @ 375 would have cindered the thing -

I too served it at a dinner party. People loved it. The filling is wonderful. Bought more apricots just yesterday to make it again.
