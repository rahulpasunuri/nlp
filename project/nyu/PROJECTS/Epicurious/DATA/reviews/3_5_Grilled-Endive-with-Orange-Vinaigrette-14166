This was surprisingly amazing. I did add a small clove of garlic, mashed, to the vinaigrette as another reviewer suggested. Otherwise, followed the directions exactly - grilled these in my cast iron grill pan on the stove top. They were perfection. I can't wait to get belgian endive again in my CSA box.

I skipped the strips of zest and just zested the fruit - used 2 clementines because that was what I had in the fridge. Added a clove of garlic per the other reviewers suggestion. I probably tripled the recipe (liquid) and continued to baste the endive as I grilled it. I enjoyed this very much, it was a quick side dish to make for dinner.

I added kosher salt prior to grilling and at least a teaspoon of orange zest. It was very tasty. I have already made this twice. I enjoyed the interplay of the bitterness of the endive with the sweetness of the orange.

I made this with blood oranges, which yield a beautiful pink juice and look great, but the grilled endive was a bit bland. Not sure this is worth doing again....

I would make this dish again BUT would add some fresh garlic to the vinagrette as it needs some oomph! Just a little, like 1/2 to 1 whole clove would do. An interesting way to serve endive.
