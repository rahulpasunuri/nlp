To clean the squid, you must remove the skin and ink sacks. Then, Separate the tentacles from the bodies and remove the innards; remove the beak, located in the center of the tentacles, and carefully remove the eyes. Then, slice the bodies and tentacles thinly. For a richer flavor, you can add also 3 ½ oz baby cuttlefish and 3 ½ oz prawn tails.

Considering all the positive reviews, I expected this to be fantastic. Unfortunately, it was just good. The sauce is not very flavorful, tastes mostly like tomato sauce. Seafood was cooked well, however.

I can't say enough about how great the recipe was, simple though it may be. I followed it loosely, and by half to serve only my boyfriend and I. Although it took time, plenty of it was hands off (I had done what little prep was required ahead of time). I was able to jump in and out of the shower and get ready (quickly) for a night out while the squid simmered. I also cut peppers, zucchini, onion and carrots into long strands and steamed them to supplement the reduced amount of pasta I preferred to use. They absorbed the extra liquid nicely, and made the meal a one dish wonder. I'll definitely follow it, or use it as an experimental base in the future.

I have made this twice and have loved it both times. It has a nice kick from the pepper. I took the suggestion from the reviews and skipped the lobster, adding more shrimp instead. Otherwise, I made it exactly as stated and it was delicious!

Molto delicioso! Fabulous - and not difficult to prepare at all, simple - however do make sure you allow the sauce time to simmer with the wine and squid so as to allow the flavors to meld. This is a pretty dish as well - with all the shells and sauce.

Minus squid and clam, and halved the recipe for 2 people- this could easily feed 8. Very tasty, very enjoyable, recommend cooking lobster with clam/mussel additions, as it was slightly overcooked in my dish. Be cautious with the pepper, can also be spicy. Will make again!

Yummy! Followed recipe closely. Did not have lobster, so added more of the other types of shellfish. Added about 1/2 cup each parsley, basil to the final product. Cooked mussels/clams in wine and water. Rave reviews!

Absolutely delicious, but very time consuming...that being said...very easy....totally worth the time, and little effort.....didn't use clams. Used frozen squid....very cost effective recipe that appears high end....have already designated the dinner parties that I will use this for in the future.

Despite the cooking time, this really is a simple recipe that comes out tasting very sophisticated. And you don't have to chop any vegetables! I only used clams and bay scallops because it was all I could get my hands on, but I don't feel like anything was missing. The spice amount was perfect for me. The only complaint was that it came out a bit watery in the end, but juice was good soaked up with bread. I used diced canned tomatoes and added fresh basil, and a little dried oregano and thyme.

I was short of time and had a bag of Trader Joe's seafood medley on hand. The recipe was still fabulous. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a great meal quickly. Everyone raved!

As all the others noted, this is a tremendous recipe. The slow cook nature with the calamari makes it succulent and everything comes together beautifully. One note, if cooking for a larger dinner party, the amount of food being cooked becomes a bit unwieldy between pots and stove top space. I'd definitely make this one again!

I made this last minute when we had clams and needed a recipe. Had all the other ingredients at home and it was so easy to make. Followed directions as is and my husband really enjoyed it too. Next time i will try w/ the calamari as well.

My husband said "I could just eat this and eat this and eat this..." This dish was phenomenal. We decided to pare it down a bit and used mahogany clams, cleaned squid bodies, and shrimp, and followed the rest of the recipe as is. I can't say enough. I did quote the reviewers to my husband about sticking to the time for the squid, and I'm glad we did. It wasn't tough or overcooked. And the sauce had some real zip to it! Perfect.

This was outstanding !! Made it for Good Friday dinner - and followed the recipe exactly. Only a few things I tweek - I used Diced tomatoes in basil; I agree with the other reviews - do NOT remove the calamari - it makes the sauce and was perfectly cooked. I would skip the lobster - the expense is not worth it - lobster is sort of lost in the sauce. I would also cut back on the red pepper flakes next time - as I'm not a big fan of spicy - but everyone loved it. This recipe is definitely a keeper !

I have now made this recipe four or five times and always receive raves. I have yet to make it with lobster and it is therefore an extremely economical and yet fabulous meal for company. I followed the directions exactly.

This was perfect for January. I too substituted Cod for lobster. Kept all the others. Added dried basil, 1 or 2 tsp. of Stonewall Kitchen's Seafood & Veggie Rub, and a couple splashes of Pernod just at the very end. I was delighted. Brenda prefers angel hair to a heavier pasta.

This recipe was very easy to make and delicious! You must cook the squid for the full amount of time to really add flavor to the sauce. I also used squid ink linguine instead of regular pasta to add more color and flavor. I think the next time I will add only 6-8oz of squid becuase it detracts from the taste of the squid ink pasta. Overall very yummy!

This came out excellent! I used only clams, squid and shrimp. I added extra red pepper, extra garlic, and added my own mixture of sauteed sliced portabellos with more garlic, basil, and freshly roasted chopped tomatoes.

I am very glad i read the reviews for this dish(as has recently become my habit). At first glance i assumed there was an error in the original recipe, and that there was now way the squid was meant to be cooked for 40 minutes!! After reading the reviews i held my breath and follwed the directions as given. Turned out to be a lovely sauce base - and very inexpensive given i opted to use just the squid & mussels. My only commment is that it is a very "heavy sauce" ideal for a rainy winter evening - but a bit too much for a spring meal. Thanks everyone.

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and my husband and I were very disappointed in it considering the great reviews it got. We live in Vancouver, Canada and have access to fabulous, fresh seafood all year round so thought this was an ideal recipe for a special dinner. We thought is was definately lacking in flavour even though I doctored it up with fresh basil and some oregano. The flavour of the lobster and scallops were totally lost in the sauce. Not worth the cost of the ingredients. This time, I can't agree with the reviews!

Most excellent - a delicious dish. Worth the time and trouble to steam the clams and mussels and whatever you do, make sure you cook the squid for the whole time! It makes the sauce!

Rating: 4
Upon reading reviews, it appears that some people have read the directions wrong. It does NOT say to remove the squid after 3 minutes. You can do that, but it will not be the same sauce. The squid gets stewed and becomes the entire background flavor for the sauce. I have served this to people who swear that will not eat calamari and love it! This is perfect for an Italian x-mas eve dinner, I just had to add more lobster, scallops and shrimp to make it extra special.

This was fabulous for Valentine's Day ... and the day after!!! I only used shrimp, calamari, scallops and mussels, but it was still sooo good and easy to make. A nice rosemary focaccia on the side is perfect for wiping the bowl clean.

I was not as impressed w/ this dish as I hoped. It was good- but I've tasted better. I will try again, modifying the sauce.

SUPER GREAT!I used more garlic& Hunts diced tomato in oliveoil&garlic and 2 cans of delmonte original stewed tomato do not remove squid it will become sweet&tender I steamed the clams&mussles in garlic & oliveoil clam juice parsley & basted the lobster&large shrimp in butter & garlic broiling them before adding to sause Instead of scallops I added crab claws After the shellfish was steamed I cooked the linguine in their leftover juices then adding alittle to the sause to loosen it up a bit.It's a little more work but if you don't cook the lobster and shrimp separately they have no flavor and water down the sause this was incredibly good I will go out of my way to make this again! Enjoy!

Holy moley, is this one good! Serve with a salad, crusty French bread to sop up the liquid, a Sauvingnon Blanc-heaven!! The squid, cooked exactly as the recipe states, makes the dish-in fact, I may try just the squid sometime. I also added basil-divine!

I prepared this dish for guests and received great reviews and a must do again comment from each of them. This was my first experience in preparing/cooking with squid. I followed directions( just until opaque, about 3 minutes)then removed the squid to a holding dish with lid to keep warm. I continued with recipe and added the squid during the last 3 minutes- I chose not to purchase the lobster and increased the amount of all the other seafood ingredients. It was an easy dish to prepare and I had time to socialize ( I did prep before my guests arrived ).

This was a great dish and was fairly easy to prepare. I added extra red pepper flakes and little more cayenne to give it extra kick and left out the squid. I also added fresh basil at the end!

My husband has made this many times now, and it comes out perfectly every time. The calamari make the dish - the wine and tomatoes soften them, so cooking them longer only tenderizes them more - do *not* remove them after 3 minutes as one reviewer suggested. We sometimes use only calamari and either littlenecks or mahogany clams with the same delicious results. This one's a keeper and a classic!

I have made this recipe 2 times already, and it was a smash hit...Easy to follow and absolutely delicious....I am spoiled though because my husband is in the fish business so I get all fish ingreients fresh..Regardless it is a MINT recipe

This was a very good and was easy to make for a large crowd. The sauce was much thinner than I would have liked. I think next time I'll add an extra can of diced tomatoes, drained, and maybe puree half the sauce before adding seafood.

This dish was awesome. I live in San Francisco and picked up some fresh Prince Edward Island Black Mussels at the Farmer's Market. That's all I used. I did not have all the ingredients so here is how I did it. Did did not have canned tomato, so I used fresh roma tomatoes. Mixed with the garlic, oil, tomato paste and wine, I simmered for 40 mins. adding Italian seasoning. The mussels were prepared like in the instructions. The sauce came out thin but full of flavor. I had to add salt to taste because the calamari, shrimp and the rest of the shellfish was missing.

Very good. For 2 people I used 1/2 of fish but more garlic,8oz squid. and l1b vongle instead of littleneck clams. Cooked sauce more before adding fish. Don' really need extra oil in in sauce at end. Used fresh basil. Ver similiar to the recipe in Hazan Pasta book.

This was great. I didn't use the clams or mussels so just added a bit of the pasta water instead. Also added a lot of dried basil to make the sauce less sweet. Shellfish was cooked perfectly.

Well I wasn't able to get calimari (last second shopping), so I can't comment on that aspect, but this was my first branching out expierience beyond french toast or omelettes and it turned out wonderfully! The only tip I can give is to make sure you use a very large skillet for the sauce, I had trouble with room once it came time to mix in the fish. All in all though, a fabulous dish!

I have not tried this yet but wanted to mention...don't cook the squid longer than the alloted time of three minutes or so, it WILL turn to rubber. The directions do not instruct users to remove and set the calamari aside...
