Easy to do. I combined gremolata in the marinade with my blender and marinated over night. Quick and easy to grill, very lemony. Moist and tender. My no chicken husband like it.

I thought this was a little bland, although it was easy to make. The gremolata added the most flavor, so I wouldn't skip it.

Bright, simple and delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken tenders to shorten cooking time and have a greater surface area to soak in the marinade. I also used the zest of one whole lemon for the gremolata as I liked the acidity and brightness. Adding more zest, seasoning with salt and pepper and letting the gremolata rest for a few minutes ensured that the final result wasn't dry at alland in fact, the gremolata was the best part! Lastly, I used an improved meyer lemon from my tree for both the marinade and the zest and that added a little extra sweet lemony flavor. Delightful!

I've made this twice now -- once on the grill (as instructed) and once on the stovetop in a cast iron grill pan. In both cases it turned out great. Moist, flavorful and really easy to prepare. To flatten the cutlets, I stick them in a heavy-duty Ziploc bag and pound them gently but firmly with a rolling pin. They flatten out after about five minutes.

I let it marinate for close to 5 hours. It was delicious! I loved the textural contrast of the gremolata, but if you're in a rush I think that could be done without.

A little bit bland when it came right off the grill, but good overall. Next time I make it I will marinade it longer. Also the gremolata was so so and not really needed.

I confess I used it as a marinade as well. Everyone loved it though. I used fresh thyme from my herb garden. THe only thing I would change is to add a pinch of salt.

I followed other reviewers' recommendations to mix all the ingredients into the marinade, and that was a great idea. This is a nice, relatively simple dish. I'll make it again.

Yum! We made this with chicken tenders, using the broiler on our toaster oven, and sprinkled the gremolata on top while broiling. Came out with nice, crispy garlic, and not too dry. This has gone into steady rotation.

Very easy and tasty. We lost interest in making the gremolata. The marinade is also a great base for a salad dressing. We added rice wine vinegar and a little sugar.

I am easily intimdated by words like Gremolata, so I read the reviews, and incorporated the Gremolata into the marinade, like others have done. It was simply delicious, and the chicken was surprisingly moist (not dry, which I have a habit of making it). I didn't pound the chicken - don't know if that makes a difference, but I don't have a meat hammer or whatever it is you need - I get intimidated by those types of tools too. I marinated for 30 minutes, and that was plenty enough. Husband and kids loved it.

I used this recipe as a leaping off point. Prepared and marinated with addition of 1 splash of soy sauce to the marinade. Listening to previous reviewers, I made the gremolata with the listed ingredients whisked into very good olive oil (plus 1/2 tsp. sugar to cut bitterness) and then used the infused oil as a glaze after the chicken came off the grill. Delicious. Both children and adults enjoyed it.

I also found the gremolata to be too dry, and didn't really think it added anything to the dish. Won't make again.

I marinated the chicken for several hours and cooked it quickly on a hot grill. The gremolata tasted like summer and everyone really enjoyed the dish. Very easy.

To my surprise from the other reviews, I wasn't very impressed. Maybe I'm just not a fan of gremolata, but that part turned out very dry, and didn't seem to mingle very well with the chicken, especially in texture. The marinade part was good, though, but I won't bother making this again - even though my wife liked the tanginess of it.

Really really good flavor. I didn't have a grill pan so I just browned in a pan and it came out a bit dry. I think it will be much more juicy on the grill.

I looked at this recipe and thought, what is everyone thinking? This recipe can't be that good that everyone is giving it 4 forks. Boy was I wrong. This was outstanding! I rarely have left overs but this was delicous cold the following day . We will be making this again and again.

Excellent--it's sooooo good and sooooo easy. I loved the flavors and only marinated for an hour, I'll definitely try longer and using some of the gremolata in the marinade (other suggestion). I'll also moke more of the gremolata to put on top too.

Easy to prepare marinade. I loved the flavor of this dish and would prepare it again. Only change I would make to this would be to use powdered garlic as fresh diced garlic was a little pasty for the gremolata.

We make this all summer long. It is my family's number one favorite

I'm new at cooking and found this very easy to make. My girlfriend loves it and I thought the gremolata and fresh lemon made the dish. I like my meat a little spicier, so next time I'll try marinading it longer than a 1/2 hour or add more pepper.

This dish is just plain great, easy to make and full of flavor.

My husband enjoyed this recipe. I didn't pound out the chicken so I marinated it longer. It was juicy and tender with the right blend of flavors.

I did not care for this recipie. I've made it 2x (the 2nd time by accident b/c I forgot to submit a review the 1st time). I found the flavor to be too powerful--I couldn't taste the chicken.

This was a very flavorful dish. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours. When I made the gremolata, it struck me as an awful lot of raw garlic and I feared it would be too bitey, so I put half of the gremolata in the marinade for the second hour. The garlic and thyme cooked onto the chicken breasts on the grill, and it was delicious! The remaining gremolata was plenty to sprinkle on the finished dish, and was very pleasant. I would definitely make this again.

I've actually been making this dish for a few years now. People always compliment me on it and ask for the recipe. So easy to make I have it memorized!

I have made this dish now for 3 separate functions, and it's been delicious every time. Guests ask me for the recipe, and I've taken to allowing the chicken to marinate overnight. The olive oil "softens" the chicken and the citrus gives it a nice kick. Thanks, Gourmet!
