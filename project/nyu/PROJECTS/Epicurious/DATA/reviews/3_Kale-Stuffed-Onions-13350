I made this with the stuffed onions the first time, thought it was too much effort and have since made it with just chopped onions instead. A good side dish.

This is something I should have loved because it had all the ingredients I enjoy but for some reason it wasn't enjoyable to me- odd- cos the first 3 loved it- oh well- anyway I won't be making it again. I think the steamed onion may be it- steamed onion is pretty bland.

This is a very pretty and tasty dish. Would not use water but would just start with the chicken broth next time. Could also just use the kale without the onions for a different side.

These stuffed onions were a big hit at my dinner party. I accidentally added the chicken broth and cornstarch mixture instead of water at the start of cooking the kale, but it seemed to work out just fine. I did not use all of the water. The flavor of the sauce is fantastic! I served them with baby back ribs, sauerkraut with apple and caraway, and potato and parsnip puree.

This recipe is wonderful. The taste of the kale, along with the onion is a combination that works extremely well together - I would never have guessed. My husband actually liked it well enough to suggest I make it regularly. This will definately be made once a week in our home.
