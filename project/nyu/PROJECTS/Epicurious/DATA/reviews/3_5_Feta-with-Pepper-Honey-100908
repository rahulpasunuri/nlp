Easy and delicious. The cracked pepper makes the dish.

Admittedly I made this in a hurry (poured cracked ground pepper in with some honey and drizzled on dry feta). However the taste sensation I was looking for never came. Not much to it.

I love unusual combinations and this fits the bill. Those I served it to raised their eyebrows, but agreed with me after they tasted it!

The enticing contrasts rate at least 3 forks, the easiness deserves the fourth. We enhance contrasts even more by grating fresh ginger on top. As for the messiness, our own dry-salted baby feta wheels are quite firm and toothpickable; cut into thin wedges on a dark plate, they make a very attractive dish. (Similar products are probably made in the US by artisan cheesemakers, like Drinking Swamp Farm, among others.)

This is a great dish, especially if you're serving Greek. I also use it as an hors d'oeuvre with toast points and as a first course with basil oil. I've made it again and again and again with 100% raves!

A few thoughts - be sure to drain the feta if you are using pieces of a whole cheese - some get quite watery which just makes this messier. The taste is good and very different. Next time I may see if I can mash it into more of a spread to see if I can keep texture while making it a "neater" dish.

Was a big hit. Easy to prepare. Substituted baked thinly sliced baggette for crackers.Can use crumpled fetta vs sliced.

I made this for a dessert as my contibution to a dinner with friends. All excellent cooks and always interested in trying new and unusual dishes. This was the worst thing I have ever made! If possible, I would give it negative forks, at least 4.

So easy, so different, and it disappears in minutes!! And everyone raves. This is a great recipe and is wonderful served on water crackers with cracked pepper. Nice addition to a dessert table too.

This is a real hit. I used baquette slices instead of crackers. It's easier to spread on the bread and you don't have to worry about crumbled crackers.

This is a real conversation maker! And, it couldn't be easier! No one expects it to taste as good as it does! There were some leftover sticky crumbles, and they were even good the next day! I used coarsely ground pepper from my mill. There is no need to crack pepper corns unless you don't have an adjustable mill.

Definitely a little messy. My idea had been to cut the feta into small squares (2 cm on a side, 1 cm thick) and serve as an appetizer with toothpicks, but the toothpicks broke the feta squares in half, requiring the guests to perform various awkward manipulations to get their treats off the serving plate. I would recommend experimenting with your chosen serving method prior to serving your guests. On the positive side, the flavor is truly unique, and guests seemed impressed with the adventurousness of the combination.

We love this! It is so easy and has just a wonderful taste. I have made it for company and while it can be a little messy, it was a hit.
