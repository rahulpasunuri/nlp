I first made this sauce for Thanksgiving 2001 and my family has demanded it every year since then. It is easy to make, deliicious and most of all way better than the glob from the can!

Easy and great to make a day or two ahead. I used fresh orange juice (from one of the zested oranges) instead of cider vinegar for a great fresh taste. Everyone loved this at Thanksgiving!

This has become a holiday tradition in our home. We always had the canned stuff before. I always make enough for everyone to take home. Everyone loves it!

I made this for the first time three years ago at thanksgiving. I now make it every year at thanksgiving. It is delicious. Tangy but sweet.

I usually hate cranberry sauce. I made this last thanksgiving for the benefit of the rest of my family, not expecting to like it at all. To my surprise I found it quite addictive! The only change I made was to add a cinnamon stick to simmer with the sauce. Might sound unusual, but the flavor is complimentary.

Very good sauce but, after years of experimenting with cranberry sauce, from now on I'll stay with the following, which is the best I've ever had. I hope no one minds if I add this in! Cranberry Claret Sauce: 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup claret, divided, 1/2 cup water, 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange rind, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 pound cranberries. In saucepan combine all ingredients except 1/4 cup claret and cranberries. Bring to a boil and boil 7 minutes. Add cranberries and cook for 5 minutes or until they burst. Let mixture cool and stir in remaining 1/4 cup claret. Makes about 1 quart. Note: I believe this was from a "Gourmet" magazine many, many years ago and furnished by a Canadian reader.

Excellent. The ginger is an unusual but beautifully complementary addition in flavor.

Wonderful! I made it last night for dinner. One suggestion--make sure you really mince the ginger! A couple of bites had quite a kick . . .

What a great sauce! I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe just as it was, and the ginger was great to boost the flavor of regular cranberry sauce. I will make this again, and passed out the recipe to several people.

Excellent and a bit different! I made this for Thanksgiving last year (and Christmas!) and it was a huge hit so I'm going to whip it up again. Easy to make and enjoyed by all.

Cranberry sauce was delicious. Added some honey to take away the bitterness of the cranberries. Also took half of the sauce and pureed it. Wonderful recipe, I would definitely make this again.

This cranberry sauce was delicious. The ginger and apple add flavor and texture. I loved the jewel color of the sauce. The only substitution made was 100% cranberry juice in place of water.

I made this receipe for Thanksgiving this year, and it was so good, that my copy of the recipe was stolen by a 90 year old guest. Everyone loved this, including our Old English Sheepdog. I know I should try something new for Christmas, but I need to have this again. From teenagers to our 90 year old guest, everyone thought this a real winner.

I've made this recipe three times and I find that increasing the sugar to 2 cups help to reduce some of the tartness. Excellent recipe overall.

I don't understand the cider vinegar. It made my house smell like vinegar while it was cooking, and I could taste it distinctly in the final product. I did substitute crystallized ginger for the fresh, so maybe the vinegar is supposed to interact with fresh ginger? I would recommend leaving out the cider vinegar, otherwise this was a good recipe.

I added 2 Tbsp. of Grand Marnier to the sauce. It was a little tart for my family, but I loved it!

Great tasting sauce if you make it one day ahead of time to let the flavors blend, let sit at room temp before serving. I cut the recipe in half and it came out great!

very good. After grating the peel from the orange, I juiced it and substituted the juice for some of the water. The cranberry sauce was a big success this past Thanksgiving day.

I recommend making this a day ahead. When we first sampled this the day of making, it did not taste very good. The flavor improved markedly by the next day. When I make this again, I will reduce the vinegar a bit - vinegar, ginger and cranberry is a lot of sour! We all enjoyed this a lot with our Thanksgiving turkey tonight.

Wow. Great flavors that blend so well. The ginger gives a hint of heat (just a hint) that really gives the recipe a lift.
