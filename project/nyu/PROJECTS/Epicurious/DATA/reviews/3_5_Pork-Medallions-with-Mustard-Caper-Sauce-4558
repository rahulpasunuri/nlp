This was just barely better than throw it away. The sauce does not thicken in the time alotted. Way too many shallots and capers in proportion to the liquid. To try and reduce the sauce to an appropriate thickness there would have been even more shallots and capers in the final sauce. Yuck!

Delicious, quick, could be made with ingredients I had on hand (used half and half instead of cream), and my kids enjoyed it (once we removed the capers from their pork). A winner all around.

This recipe has great flavor. I was not thrilled with the way the poek came out, but the sauce was very good! I'd try again and perhaps pound the pork so it is thinner.

Good, classic recipe, will definitely make again. Low salt broth is a must, based on the one time I used 'regular'.

Rating: 2
I made this after reading all the glowing reviews and used half wine, half cream and also rinsed the capers and used low salt chicken broth. Even so, this was still a briny sauce without any real character and I can't believe everyone loves it. It is just "ok" and for my taste needs something tangy like lemon juice to perk it up.

mmmmm This was such an easy Tuesday night dinner that everyone just inhaled! Served with saffron rice and peas. Will definitely add to the list of regulars.

Excellent! Imagine, this recipe is still being rated 10 years later. Followed other reviewers suggestions and used half white wine and half broth. Finished sauce with chopped flat leaf parsely. The pork comes out very tender and sauce is wonderful. The sauce could easily be modified for other uses. This recipe is a must try.

Excellent and easy to prepare, this came out terrific. I did use wine in place of some of the stock, and I rinsed the capers, as others have suggested. Served with brown sugared sweet potatoes and a green salad, which worked very well.

Whisk in a thick pat of butter right at the end and this sauce is great. I served it over rib eye steak, like I saw at a restaurant recently.

This recipe has become one of our regulars, as my husband and kids LOVE it, and it's very easy. I have substituted half and half for the cream and found it just doesn't work as well - doesn't get thick enough - no surprise there.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I tried it for something different and my husband loved it. The pork is tender and the sauce is delicious. I followed previous suggestions and did half broth and half wine. I also rinsed and drained the capers.I did not season with salt and pepper as stated at the end of the recipe because it was salty enough for our taste.It does take closer to 10 minutes to thicken. I will definitely keep this one.

Rating: 3
Excellent and easy. We dredged the pork in a small amount of flour before sauteing, which helped thicken the sauce. The sauce does take about 10 minutes to reduce, and can be a little salty, depending on the type of stock used. Go easy when salting the pork. As other reviewers suggested, we substituted white wine for some of the stock, and will use 1/2 cup of each next time.

okay, i have to ask...has anyone else noticed that the combination of pork tenderloin, mustard, capers, and lemon are consistently highly rated (3 forks +)? this is a rock-solid recipe. you can simplify it in a number of ways, but the blend of flavors with the succulent pork seems like one of those "natural" blends that would he hard to ruin, and yet still allow room for the chef's personalization. keep this one close at hand.

Rating: 4
This was SO good! The pork was tender and perfectly done and the sauce thickened well even though it seemed to include a lot of liquid. The only changes I made were: - Added 1/2 tsp of green peppercorns (in brine, not dried) along with the capers. - Used tarragon mustard - Added about 1 tbsp more cream at the end to thin out the sauce for pouring.

Rating: 4
oh-my, was this dish DELICIOUS! i was a little discouraged by the reviewer who said it wasn't as good as the Pork with Gorgonzola sauce (also on this website and one of my regular staple dishes for both company and any night.) However, this was absolutely scrumptious! I made it exactly as called for, and both my husband and I were mumbling "mmmmm!" with each and every bite. I've made dozens and dozens of recipes on epicurious, and this is ONE OF THE BEST! Easy and deeee-lish!

Really good. I substituted greek yoghurt for the cream and also added some chestnut mushrooms just after the shallots. Very tasty sauce. I served with pak choi.

This was really yummy. I did not have shallot or heavy cream so I used vidalia onion and half and half. It was great. It was really easy to prepare. I will make this again.

I didn't have a pork tenderloin, but I did have a boneless pork loin roast. I browned the roast in butter and then transfered the meat to a roasting pan. I then added the chicken broth & baked until tender @ 350 degrees. Thereafter, I made the sauce as directed adding the broth from the roasted meat. I sliced the pork roast and placed in the sauce until warm. It was excellent. The sauce it self is what makes the dish :-)))

Rating: 3
I thought it was very good but I did make some adjustments. I halved the chicken broth and substituted white wine for the other half. I also used milk instead of cream because it's what I had. Served it with sauteed spinach as recommended and sauteed potatoes with parsley and garlic. One thing though - it was a little salty. Maybe next time I'll rinse the capers.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe! I used pork chops instead, I seared them first and then finished cooking them in the oven while I completed the sauce. YUM!!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic! I wilted fresh spinach with red pepper and a touch of red pepper flakes, along with mashed potatoes with leeks from Whole Foods. My boyfriend LOVES pork tenderloin, and this is a new favorite. The flavors were rich yet subtle.

Wonderful recipe and quite easy to prepare. I went pretty heavy on the shallots, cream and capers and it was splendid. Great for entertaining. Had the tenderloin prepared ahead of time. If your guests are in the kitchen, you can visit and cook at the same time.

Hate to be the decending vote on this, but both my husband and I thought this was a nice meal, but not great. All though we liked the individual ingredients, they did little to compliment each other. Overall it was uninteresting and we tired of the taste before the meal was finished. With so many terrific recipes for tenderloin, why settle for O.K.? This is one we will not make again.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I used 10% cream, 1 tsp cornstarch, a splash of sherry, and 2 tsp of Anton Kozlik's Canadian Mustard (a mustard seed mustard) for texture and colour. I used the timer on the stove for each sequence and turned out tender and very tasty. I am planning to serve this at my next dinner party.

I really liked this recipe and almost fell over when my husband said he didn't care for it. (He eats anything!) The flavors blended well together and was flavorful, but not overpowering. I really enjoyed it!

Great dish. I doubled the sauce recipe and barely had enough because it was such a hit. I had a little trouble with the "medallion" part. I think I need more practice with the hammer. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I used this recipe to get rid of some leftover grilled garlic lime pork tenderloins. I just browned my already-cooked pork and followed the recipe. My dad was happy to get his pork with capers. He came back for seconds and later for a snack. However, it didn't make much sauce, so I tripled the recipe, which obviously led to more cooking time (I had almost 2 loins as leftovers to get rid of, so I needed more sauce). As is, the recipe should make less than 1/2 cup of sauce.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe using low-fat creme fraiche and had no problem with the sauce being too thin. I would think from the taste it would lend itself well to substituting low fat sour creme also. I also added a splash of sherry... yummy.

Rating: 4
This was very easy to prepare. Tasty and fast. I don't like mustard, but I loved this sauce. This will become a winter staple in my repertoire. The sauce does take much longer than 3 minutes to reduce. Just be patient and use the time to steam some fresh veggies.

This had wonderful flavor, but I thought the sauce was a little thin. next time I might try adding a little flour or cornstarch to get it to thicken better.

Very simple recipe and quick to prepare. Wonderful straight forward flavors that work well together; the only change I made was using pork loin chops I had on hand. Didn't find that I needed any additional salt at the end. Enjoy! KIMBER

Only made the mustard caper sauce and it was wonderful. Used it to top breaded pork tenderloin medallions that I sauteed in a cast iron skillet with butter and olive oil. Served with cubed yukon gold potatoes that also got the skillet treatments, and wilted greens.

Subbed onion powder for shallot, french's for dijon. Recipe was still yummy!

I made this dish based on the rave reviews of others. I must say, I wasn't overly impressed. I found the dish to be a tad bland. It certainly didn't knock my socks off, as anticipated. There are far more impressive pork tenderloin dishes here. For instance, the pork tenderloin with gorgonzola cream sauce... heavenly!

This is an excellent, easy and fast recipe. Served this with sauteed butternut & yellow squash with red pepper and thyme, festival rice blend from Chieftain Rice company and a spinach salad with feta, onion, bacon and my famous dressing. Was a total hit with the family, including my visiting mom.

What a hit!!!!!This was so easy to make, and such an impressive dish.My teenage sons loved it even though they are rather fussy about sauces.I served this with a combo of roasted red potatoes and sweet potatoes,also a ceasar salad. I had to triple the recipe as we had company, the sauce does take much longer than 3 min to reduce.More like 10-15 min.I will definitly make it again!!!

Rating: 4
We loved this recipe! It was a snap to make and very flavorful as well. It definitely took more than 3 minutes to reduce the sauce properly--more like 10 minutes. I strained out the shallots after the sauce was reduced, but before I added the mustard and capers. This made the sauce smoother and (I think) more elegant, but it still had the wonderful shallot flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is really delicious, fast, and easy to prepare. I served it with steamed baby red potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic and olive oil. Next time I will probably delete the salt from the pork before cooking and only add pepper since the capers add to the sauce the salt needed to flavor the dish. Will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
The sauce definately needed 10 - 15 minutes reduction time. This was very good; maybe just a little on the bland side, which surprised me. If you liked this, you'll love Varkenshaas (Pork Tenderloin in Mustard Sauce), which is similar but much superior--try it; its on this website!

Excellent!!! - My husband loved it and he's a pretty picky eater. The only thing I would do differently is reduce the sauce longer that the designated time said in the recipe.

I really liked the taste of this sauce, but found that I had to reduce the sauce for about 10-15 minutes and add flour to get it to an acceptable consistency. Otherwise - a very nice and easy elegant dinner selction. I served this with large egg noodles which also taste delicious soaking up the sauce.

Fabulous! To try to make it a bit less unhealthy, I used olive oil instead of butter and white wine instead of cream. I'm sure the sauce had a different texture than the original but it was still delicious.

I made this recipe (and the accompanying butternut squash and parsnip soup) for my future in-laws when they were in town. It was a hit, and not too work intensive. I served the medallions over a wild mushroom ragout, which worked well.
