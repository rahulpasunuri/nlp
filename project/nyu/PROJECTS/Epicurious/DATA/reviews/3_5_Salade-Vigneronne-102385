This is a lovely salad with an unusual combination of flavors. It goes wonderfully with both fondue and flammenkuchen.

I was very disappointed by this. It was nice and refreshing, but to me, nothing transcedent. For all the money this cost to make 15 for wine, 10 for cheese, 8 for endive, 6 for 2 packs of baby greens, 5 for cornchicons, etc. For that price, I thought it should have been crazy crazy good, rather than just, ehhhh, ok. I used garden fresh tomatos and tarragon, so it was not the ingredients. Next time, if I want a simple fresh tasting salad, I will just make one, rather than go through all the time and expense to get hohum results.

This was unusual and tasty -- I agree that the cornichons were special, and I love tarragon and endives. I thought there was too much cheese called for in the recipe, but perhaps this makes more sense as part of a traditional menu. I would make it again, but it would be nice to spend less money on the wine! Any suggestions?

I served this salad with the Choucroute Garnie and the Leek and Swiss Chard tart for an Oktoberfest. The entire menu got rave reviews. The pickles in the topping sound strange, but the effect is delicious.

I rated this 4 forks not only because it was excellent but it is unusual. You'd never know there were pickles in the salad. The flavors blended nicely. We served it with a sea bass recipe.

This is a delicious and unusual salad for a dinner party. It was designed to go with the Choucroute Garni recipe in the same issue; there's also a quiche recipe and dessert that go with it. Why on earth isn't the entire menu featured, or at least available through links? Wierd...
