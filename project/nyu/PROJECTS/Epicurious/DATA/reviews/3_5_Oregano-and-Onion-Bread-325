Such an easy bread to throw together. I added chopped red peppers and substituted truffle oil for olive oil. The house smelt intoxicating.

My very first bread! A winner! I didn't have oregano so I went to my garden and picked rosemary, sage and chives and chopped them up. Since the recipe said to add the leftover oil, but I wasn't using any to cook onion, I decided to add 2 tbsp olive oil anyway. A great success!!!

This was such a quick and easy bread to make, I ended up caramelizing the onions to bring out their sweetness and color in the dough and I gently sauteed the oregano to enhance its flavor. This bread was so easy I made 2 additional loaves with rosemary and lemon zest right after. Next I'm going to try dried cranberries and orange zest. I know what my friends are getting for christmas!

I made this to see if it would be good for a hostess gift. Was really good & tender. I did use a whole onion & cooked it longer. Next time I will use even more onion. I also used fresh oregano & thyme. I am thinking about adding a little rosemary next time. I thought this was a really easy bread to make. Served it with olive oil & balsamic. Will be making this again!

Added sauteed garlic, onions, lots of dried mixed herbs. Added 2 tsp yeast which worked well. Also let rise in oven with a pan of steaming water underneath. rose beautifully! Topped with parmesan cheese before baking.

As per other reviewers' suggestions I doubled the onion. I still found the bread to be a bit bland. I tried it plain by itself and plain with soup. My next test will be toasted with butter. My bread rose just fine. I looked through a book of my bread recipes before making this and while most recipes did call for 2 packets of yeast with 4.5 cups of flour, there were some that did not so I figured this recipe (using only 1 packet) would be ok. To the people that found the bread too flat, I would emphasize making sure the temperature of the water is up there. My water was at 120 degrees when I stirred the yeast in. One thing I found unusual was how wet the dough was. It was somewhat difficult to work with. I won't be making this bread again--it was uninspiring.

Easy and delicious. I used oregano from my garden and doubled the onions. Friends and family are always asking for more.

Wonderful bread! I didn't see the need to increase the yeast - it wasn't light and fluffy, but this recipe didn't need to be - it was fabulous warm with dinner, and made a great savory "french toast" the next morning.

Given other reviewer's comments, I doubled the amount of yeast to make the bread fluffier: it worked! Crispy crust and light inside.

Definitely would make this again. A friend grows organic oregano; I used it, dried, in this bread (used a little less than a quarter-cup, since it was dried and quite pungent). Served with carrot sweet potato soup. Yum. A delicious, earthy bread.

Very good and easy to make. Next time I will double the amount of onion...it's really quite subtle.

This was a fantastically easy recipe for bread! i used dried herbs and a fresh onion, and it came out with a great aroma. the onion was a bit subtle, but was perfect for dipping in oils. i left the dough quite sticky (almost unmanageable), and the crust that formed was crunchy and chewy -we like a tough crust. the egg wash gives it a great brown color. i agree that it doesn't rise as much as you'd expect. even when doubled in size, the bread isn't a light and airy bread, but it has a good texture. if you are a beginner at making bread, this is a great one to try. it will come out tasty no matter what you do to it. i'll be making this one again and again -my husband couldn't get enough of it! i might try blackening the onion next time, too.

This bread was great. I added chopped sundried tomato's to mine. It was a bit doughy though ... any way to avoid this?

Wonderful Bread, I used dry herbs and vadalia onion. Try it, easy recipe and your sure don't find this in the bakery.

I added lots of onion and oregeno (I had to use dried, but it came out fine) and it was excellent. My bread was slightly thick and doughy though, I'm not sure why... My kitchen might have been too cold for the full rise...

Wonderful fragrant smell as it's baking. It doesn't rise too much, so don't be alarmed. Dunno what happened with our loaves, they came out warped (but then I'm a new baker). I think next time I'll shape them into breadsticks, bake, and serve with soup. That might help.

I expected the bread to rise much higher than it did, so I was worried that my low-rising loaves would be dense and spongy. No such problem. The bread is delicious and fragrant, a real find. Our oregano went wild while we were on vacation, and I think this bread is the ideal way to use it up. I might even make a few loaves as gifts.

Superb! Smelled great, looked great, tasted great! I used fresh herbs from my garden and was very pleased with this - it makes quite a professional looking loaf and it's not hard. Try it!

Our family found this bread really great. I am going to make it next time we are having guests. I am sure they will enjoy it as much as we did.

My family enjoyed this bread. The crust was excellent. I doubled the amount of sweet onions and that seemed to really give the bread a boost.

I grated the onion and reserved the juices to sautee it in, that way I used less oil.

First bread I ever made and it came out far over my expectations! Nice texture & crust and fragrant. Forgot the salt and added sea salt (less like a reviewer suggested & also sprinkled with sesame seeds) only at 2nd kneading, and it still turned out great. Have tried this bread again & since its getting colder & fresh garden herbs are getting scarce here (this is Montreal) I have substituted the following for oregano: 1-1/4 tsp. caraway seeds, 3/4 tsp. poppyseed, 3/4 tsp ground sage and 1/3 tsp. ground nutmeg. Here the sage dominates slightly and it came out just great!

I liked this bread very much but would make a few changes next time. I think there was entirely too much salt. 1 1/2 tsp would have been more than sufficient and I think a little more sugar would be nice. All in all the bread came out beautifully. Instead of the two rounds, I made one large loaf and sprinkled it with sesame seeds after brushing on the egg wash

I did not have freash herbs so i reconstituded some of the oregano from last years cuttings. To do this use 1/2 cup of the warm water from the recipe then after about 20-30 min soaking you can use the water and the herbs. I used a Kitchen aid stand mixer and unbleached flour. It took about 1/2 cup more flour. I have found that you can slightly carmelize the onions for a nice toasted onion flavor.

Got rave reviews for this bread. Couldn't get my hands on fresh oregano so I substituted fresh basil and it was delicious.

I served this bread with spaghetti, which complimented the onion and oregano in the sauce. I prepared the dough in a KitchenAid so I only used an additional 4 tablespoons of flour to knead. My bread was nice and moist with a dark shiny crust!

This bread is unbelievably good and worth the effort of all the kneading. I think you could make it with almost any fresh spice from the garden.

We love this bread! I've made it three times in 5 weeks. So far I've followed the recipe pretty closely, sometimes adding a bit more onion and oregano. I think substituting some fresh rosemary would be delicious as well. Any kind of onion works--yellow, red, Vidalias. I like to have one loaf out to slice as needed, and freeze the other.
