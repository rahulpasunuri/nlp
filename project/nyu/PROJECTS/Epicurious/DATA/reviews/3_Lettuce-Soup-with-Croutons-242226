Didn't like this much at all. I used fresh rosemary, and it took over the lettuce flavor. There wasn't enough potato to give it a better consistency.

And the croutons were the best EVER! I make homemade croutons frequently. This was definately the easiest and tastiest way that I've made them.

Yum, yum, yum! I added a couple of things to the broth that I needed to use up from my pantry and fridge - yellow hominy, celery and beer. I also added diced chicken breasts after pureeing the broth. My fiancee and CHILDREN (6 & 4) loved it!

This soup wasn't horrible, but it wasn't that good either. I think first off, that really good quality chicken broth needs to be used, the canned stuff I had was too salty and tasted like nothing. Second, I ended up with a lot of clumps of lettuce that wouldn't puree, more wrapped around the blades. They were not very appetizing. The croutons were nice though...

Soup was crisp, in a good way. Tasty and fresh, but a little bland (but I didn't use the croutons). Next time I'd try adding a few other ingredients that compliment salad - tomato? Red pepper?

Very tasty and easy soup to make. First time I have made lettuce soup and it was a hit! Thanks you.
