This tastes just like the garlic watercress dish you find in Chinese restaurants. Quick, easy to make and delicious. My garlic got a little too golden brown. I'd recommend cooking in medium heat instead until just cooked through. I also left it longer than 20 seconds at the end for watercress to cook through more.
