Ideal recipe for this cut of meat. Nicely rare all the way through. Makes perfect slices, as per the intention of the recipe.

I served this with a horseradish sauce (made with sourcream and horseradish) and dinner rolls for a large gathering - it was a huge hit and very easy

I can't believed I have found a beef recipe that I liked. It was VERY easy to prepare and good for people like me, who are not big beef eaters or cookers!!

Best roast beef I ever made. Ate it sliced with horseradish and sour cream, tomorrow I'm making some weck rolls so this Midwesterner can taste a Buffalo favorite.

If you can't find kimelweck rolls, buy kaiser rolls. Lightly brush melted butter on the top of the rolls and then sprinkle caraway seeds and coarse sea salt on the top of the rolls.

Easy and yummy. It was missing something even though I used angus beef, but the horseradish garnish made up for that. Interestingly, I noted that this recipe is almost the same as the one printed on my package of beef.

So simple and so good. I used an eye round roast, very inexpensive and very tenter. Next time I'll season with crystal (rock) salt for a little longer, since I like my meats more on the salty side. It was my first time preparing a roast beeft and I was shocked how simple it is.

Thank you Westport, CN cook for your Weck recipe - I am a transplant for Northwestern, PA, who now lives in NE - no one here even heard of a beef on weck, let alone a kimmelwick roll, and lets face it the sandwich is not the real deal without the 'weck" roll! This is the one food I crave - whenever I go back east I try to have one a day! Now I can make my own.

Thankyou for your review, Westport, CT. Loved your added recipe for the Weck buns from scratch...made the whole experience crazy good!! Any bread recipe with milk, butter and potatoes in it you know is going to be exceptional. and now I know what to do with the eye of round roasts. Its hard to believe its so easy. Added the garlic powder and a sliced onion on top. Did not cover it, since no one seemed to mention it, either in the instructions or to the enquiry..and it was great, not dry at all.

If you are not going to follow through and serve roast beef on a roll, then you need to modify the recipe. Looking for a dinner recipe, but mouth always waters when thinking about these sandwiches. Don't worry California, Buffalonians are always a bit touchy when it comes to their wings and their Weck.

HELP!! I want to make this for a huge amount of people...do I cover the roast when I'm cooking it?

I had to do what my mom used to do when I was growing up: I stuck the roast a few times with a knife and inserted garlic slivers. I also browned the roast all over and then added the water to the pan and placed it in a 350 degree oven.

Excellent recipe. I cooked the night before and chilled before slicing thinly. Great for a do-ahead party recipe. To simplify I cheated and used a commercial au jus and buttered/broiled kaiser rolls. Worked great.

Very very good. Try not to leave on alot of fat. trim meat before cooking. set temp of oven to 500 put meat in for 10 min. then turn down to 350 for the remainder. spice meat as you would like but salt and pepper is a MUST!!!!!!!!

I have made several times since it was pub. in 1999. The original recipe for Wecks is 12 Kaisier Rolls 2 Tbl kosher salt 1 Tbl caraway seeds 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbl water 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch. Preheat oven to 350F. Put rolls on baking sheet. Mix salt and seeds in a smalll bowl. Bring 1/2 cup of water to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 2 Tbl of water. Add cornstarch mixture to boiling water and return to a boil, stirring, until thickened. Remove mixture from heat and brush onto top of rolls. Sprinkle with salt and seeds and bake in middle of oven until crisp about 5 minutes. My variation - Fennel seeds - everyone loves it!

Hello - I am from Buffalo and live in Buffalo (again, after 20 years elsewhere). This is the perfect recipe for Beef on Weck. Gotta have the weck! The reason for the bland flavor of the beef is so the seasonings on the roll and what each person adds is not overwhelming. I personally like loads of fresh horseradish, a slice of domestic swiss and a small amount of good mayo along with the au jus. A little sauteed sweet onion is fabulous. Messy, yummy, true Buffalonion fantastic taste.

Thank you for a simple roast beef recipe! I'd never prepared a roast before and just needed to know the basics. There is a recipe for weck on the Food TV website- I don't know how authentic it is, but I thought it was good (I've never been to Buffalo so don't bash me on this). And not to rain on Gloria's parade and the "California imagination" that the rest of the world apparently lacks (BTW I think that experimentation in the kitchen is great, and I don't discredit her recipe at all!)- but she prepared the same roast beef that my mom has made for the last 40 years (and it IS delicious!). I hope that we all keep cooking with imagination no matter where we live.

I found a great recipe for "Weck Rolls". They were fantastic. The only thing I would do differently next time is reduce the carroway seeds to 1 tablespoon: Title: Giant Weck Rolls For Beef Sandwiches Yield: 1 Servings Ingredients 2 pk dry yeast 1 1/2 c tepid potato water (water -from boil; ing potatoes) 2 ts sugar 1 c mashed potatoes 1 c milk 8 tb butter, melted (one stick) 2 ts salt 2 tb caraway seeds 7 c flour (up to 8) 1 egg white, beaten with: 1 tb water 1 coarse salt 1 caraway seeds for sprinkling - on top Instructions Here's the kimmelweck ("weck") recipe, from "Real American Food" by the Sterns. Mix yeast with 1/2 C of the potato water and sugar. Combine mashed potatoes, remaining C of potato water, milk, butter, salt, and caraway seeds. When yeast mixture is foamy, stir it in. Add 7 C of the flour, cup by cup, stirring until dough comes away from bowl. Turn out onto a floured board and let rest while you clean and butter bowl. Knead dough 10 minutes, adding flour if necessary to create a smooth dough. Return to bowl and roll dough around to coat it with butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down dough, knead again 1-2 minutes. Roll out and divide into 12 pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball. Then flatten ball slightly so that it's roll-shaped. Set 2 inches appart on lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover loosely with towel and let rise until double in bulk, less than 1 hour. Preheat over to 375 deg. Brush rolls with egg white mixture and sprinkle with desired amount of coarse salt [it should be a lot of salt, not just a few grains] and caraway seeds. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 deg and bake 15-20 minutes more, until rolls are medium brown. Remove from oven and cool on rack.

...But where's the recipe for the "weck rolls"?! Do they think I can just stroll into the local Stop and Shop in Connecticut and pick up a pack? Hey, leave the lady from California alone. You know those people are "different".

Beef on weck is a Buffalo tradition, although not as well known as the buffalo chicken wing. I'm surprised that epicurious didn't include instructions for serving with the recipe! The beef is sliced fairly thinly and served on a "Kimmelweck" roll, a bulkie roll with large grains of salt and caraway seeds on top. The beef should be a bit juicy, and you can serve the extra juice for dipping. It's often served just like that, but if you want anything extra try a creamy horseradish sauce. Even without the sauce, it's simple, but delicious!

What a good, simple recipe! I've made many roasts in my slow cooker, but this was my 1st time making a roast beef in the oven. I followed the recipe (which I'm sure will please the snide reviewer from Portland) & it worked great. Served this with sour cream horseradish sauce, Madiera wine sauce & cauliflower-leek puree. DEEEEELISH!

Is the roasting pan supposed to be covered while this roasts?

It's easy to see why people want to add a little to this recipe; I mean it is beef, salt and pepper! Nonetheless it is really good. Cook from Portland needs to lighten up - afterall she is a great grandmother.

How is it possible to rate these recipes when everyone changes them? Then we have the types that claim "being from California, we are creative!" Is it possible they work for the television industry?

This was great!! My husband loved it. The kids loved it too. I made the sandwich For my husband. I used fresh Italian bread with the salt, seeds and horseradish. He was in heaven. The kids just ate the meat with Aujus and a side of garlic mashed potatoes.Ages 7 and 9 they had 3 helpings. I think that says it all.I would definitely make this again. Simple and satisfying! PS I added garlic powder to the salt and pepper and gravy master to the water. Yum!

Being from California my great granddaughter and I used our imagination and instead of water we used a can of beef broth. Instead of a rack we sat the roast on a bed of potatoes, carrots & onions. We seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. SO YUMMY! A Heck of a Weck!

Yummy! I'm not from Buffalo, but my boyfriend is, and I've been listening to him go ON and ON about "beef on wick" for two years. So when I found this recipe while looking for something else, I tried it. I did up kaiser rolls with kosher salt and caraway seeds... made the sandwiches with lots of horseradish and dunked them in the au jus, served with thick potato chips and a spicy pickle. Messy but who cares? Delicious.

Weck (pronounced wick) is the type of roll you put the beef on to make the sandwich. It is a hard roll with coarse salt and rye seeds on top. You take your beef, put it on the roll, add some prepared horseradish...there you have it, Beef on Weck! It is the best beef sandwich. and yes, I am from Buffalo.

My suggestion for this recipe is to make the best roast of beef the way you like it! Season it, salt it, pepper it. Then to make a proper "weck" roll, take a kaiser roll and egg wash the top. Sprinkle, sort of generously, with rock salt and a few caraway seeds. Put it under a medium broiler and watch not to burn. Cut in half, take the top part of the bun and dip the underside in the au jus. Spread really hot, really fresh horseradish on and enjoy the way the sandwich should be made. Now that's "Beef on weck!"

Former Western New Yorker; without the weck, this would be ordinary. Serve on a weck or using the recipe for making a Kaiser roll into a good imitation of one, that is in the same issue; and add horseradish. Clear meat juices also add to the flavor. Good reminder of an old treat;-)

I have prepared the roast beef this way before with the twist of cooking it in a cooking bag and using a packet of au jus in the bag and maybe another prepared for the side. But, I agree with the other comment "it's bland" but, use my twists, AND, IT MUST BE SERVED ON A WECK BUN (with a good dollop of horseradish on top).

Where is the rest of the recipe? I imagined I would find a neat new thing to try on my family and clients, but I found a plain old unseasoned roast beef recipe. It's not nice to put a fancy name on so blah a recipe.
