This was excellent. I doubled the quantities for the seasonings which made it very peppery and I'd cut back on the pepper a little if doubling but it was still quite good. Had no trouble avoiding pith with a basic vegetable peeler - fresh lemons shouldn't be problematic.

I did not make this yet but had to comment about the lemon zest. A Microplane (long grater with handle) makes zesting a breese, and cleans up with a rinse of water. I love it! (also great with cheeses)

This is a real keeper. We baked it for 30 minutes and then broiled it for the last 10 minutes and added some wine and garlic powder to the pan juices and reduced the sauce. VOILA! a wonderful combination of easy great tastes. Next time, I would add fresh garlic to the rub.

I threw out my old lemon chicken recipe after making this. It is delicious and very easy. I just grated the lemon zest rather than chopping it.

simple recipe requiring very few ingredients that is virtually fool-proof and extremely tasty.

Good week night dinner. Much better than the bottled seasoning. The fresh lemon and pepper give it the tang you look forward to. I used a little extra fresh lemon juice and lightly buttered the chicken before rubbing w/ the lemon pepper mixture. Just to crisp up the skin. I would suggest broiling chicken for the last 10-15 minutes of cook time to ensure a crisp skin.

I didn't use a spice grinder, but instead finely chopped the lemon zest with a knife. I ground the pepper coursly in my pepper mill. I used all the juice from two lemons and used about 4 chicken breasts. I baked the chicken till brown and lightly crispy on the outside. I deglazed he pan with the lemon juice the chicken cooked in, along with some water, boiled to a nice brown gravy, which no one ate. My family and I enjoyed the tang of the lemon in the chicken while the lemon zest and pepper made for a sour/hot flavor on the outside of the chicken. Served with steamed green beans & garlice bread, this dish was a hit and is one I'll be sure to make again. Prep was easy, clean up minimal.

This one is a winner! I sprayed the chicken with olive oil during the roasting time and it came out even juicier!

The dish seemed flat. For me lemon chicken should really POP in your mouth. I altered the recipe by using all of the lemon zest, adding 4 cloves of garlic to the coffee grinder mix and deglazed the pan with 2 tablespoons each -lemon juice and water. Next time I will deglaze with lemon juice, white wine and a bit of butter.
