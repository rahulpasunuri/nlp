I needed a pastry recipe quick, fast and in a hurry so I used this one. I made 4 batches of it in about 20 minutes. It came out great. Flaky and flavorful. This is a keeper.

First time I prepared pastry from scratch and it was much easier than expected. I probably rolled out the pie crust too thick, maybe a little more ice water next time. Will definitely use it again.
