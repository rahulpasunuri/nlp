This recipe is delicious and very easy. I made it last night for friends and we all loved it

Very good, but the venison I had was exceptional. I did not marinate the venison, just salt and peppered it. When I made the reduction sauce, I added 2 sprigs of rosemary and then removed it once the sauce thickened. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. The dried cherries were a surprisingly good ingredient. I searched the web for a good recipe for the loin. I would definitely make this again when preparing a venison loin.

This was wonderful! My husband is Swedish, so I substituted lingonberries for the cherries and currant jelly. Served with oven roasted baby potatoes with rosemary and green beans sauteed in butter. Smacklig måltid!

ohboy was this good. I lucked into fresh venison from a hunting friend, otherwise I would have been terrified to overcook $30/lb meat. Like most, I made some changes: did not use oven to finish b/c my venison was abt 3/4 inch and would have overcooked; used ground coriander, blueberry preserves, ruby port since they were either on hand or find-able. seared venison in iron skillet 4 mins first side, 3 on 2nd and they were perfectly cooked after rest/deglaze/sauce.

This sauce is so delicious!! Served it to a bunch of foodies to rave reviews. I found the liquid took much longer to reduce than noted so be warned. Also substituted beef for the venison, a last minute switch, and it was still delicious.

I am married to a hunter, so each year I try some new venison recipes, but I always come back to this one combined with another one from this site, I use the port/cherry sauce with the meat marinated in the rosemary/garlic rub. (medallions of venison with port and cranberries) I use the port sauce, but add cherries and a little jelly instead of the cranberry sauce, unless I have cranberry sauce available) I always have cherries for this recipe on hand. I usually make a full recipe of the port/cherry sauce, so 1/2 recipe of meat.

Rating: 4
Really excellent and even better, very easy and fast to put together (yet you would not guess it was so easy). I used ruby port instead of wine because we didn't have a bottle open. I also eliminated the water and made up for the liquid with broth and some extra port. I also had some roasted garlic heads which I mashed up with the rosemary. Very delicious. The times in the recipe were right on for a medium rare venison.

Tried making this recipe as an experiment to see if we may want to do it for Christmas dinner, and it was my first time cooking venison so, we ordered a pound of tenderloin from D'Artagnan. We followed the recipe almost exactly, except for the suggested addition of shallots and a little more wine. Here's how it went: The venison marinated 2 hours instead of 20 minutes. I cooked the meat completely in the pan (covered to increase heat), just because it was easier. The pan was a bit blackened though, and I did not want a burned sauce so, we got out another pan. I put a little oil in it, sauteed more garlic, rosemary, and coriander (to get back the taste that would have been there), and added a minced shallot as suggested by the person from Groton, CT. I let it brown and then deglazed comletely with 1/4 c. of wine, and then added another 1/4 c (since it was now gone). The sauce came out perfect as did the tenderloin. At dinner, my mother who hates venison, absolutely loved the dish and voted for it for the Christmas dinner. My husband said it was the best piece of meat he had had in a long time, and I had to agree. So, it was the winner. For the wine we used a Syrah (was fruity and worked very well with the dish). We also did a scalloped potato au gratin (using Swiss cheese, green onions, garlic, and fresh thyme) that went well with it. The asparagus I would not recommend with it. It just didn't taste right. Perhaps spinach souffle next time.

Truly a great recipe...One of the easiest things I've ever made...and I've made it in so many places - from a primitive pheasant lodge in South Dakota to my own kitchen to a friend's restaurant. This is a wonderful dish, and always a crowd pleaser. More often than not, I've used beef tenderloin and had excellent results. For my modifications, I usually add 50% more coriander than called for, 50% more cherries, and eliminate the water in the reduction. The jelly is extremely important, though....really ties the savory rosemary and beef with the cherries. You cannot chop the garlic enough...mince it extremely well, and you'll get so much more flavor than if you just chop it. This recipe is in my regular rotation - not just because it's simple, but because I get such a rousing response. Enjoy!!!

This will be my go-to venison recipe from here on out. The sauce was absolutely delicious and SO easy! I took the suggestion of others and caramelized some shallots in the pan drippings (+ a little olive oil) before deglazing and making the sauce. Wonderful, wonderful recipe!

My son just bagged his first deer this winter, and since my wife and daughter are not especially fond of venison, we made this for "guys' weekend" when they were out of town for a soccer tournament. EXCELLENT RECIPE!

I used an approach similar to the cook from Groton, CT, as all I had was medallions. Saute'd some mushrooms after I removed them, then deglazed with the wine. It was fabulous! The sauce turned out well balanced with the sweetness of the current jelly and cherries. I'll definately make this again.

I am giving this recipe a 4 fork for the fabulous flavor that compliments the venison. It was easy to make and so yummy. For some reason the water and cornstarch mixture never thickened my sauce. Next time I will use a beurre manie instead. The only sub I made was raspberry jam for the currant jelly. Sadly it is impossible to find currant jelly anywhere near my city here in Holland. I highly recommend this venison recipe to all, it was fantastic!

Used venison steak cut into medallions; seared in pan to med rare; omitted oven step. Used dried cranberries in place of cherries. omitted water and cornstarch, reduced liquid down and added 1 tbls red rasberry jam instead of current jelly. I think next time I'll add shallots, sauted following venison, prior to deglazing. Overall it came out very good.

This is one of the best venison recipe I have ever made and I have made many. Since this is a great recipe, make sure you have a great cut of venison back loin for the recipe. I served it with garlic mashed new potatoes and brussel sprouts sauteed with golden raisins. A great valentine's dinner!

Despite my husband's warnings regarding the leaness of venison, I overcooked it. I needed to stay on the 7 minute side of cooking it (instead of the full ten). Anyway - it was still great! He loved it. I thought it was really good. My husband reheated the leftovers the next day and still raved about it.

Fantastic! Do not change a thing! I was never a venison lover before this recipe. I have my grandma's old cast iron skillet and although I can't use it on my glass top stove, I use it on the side burner of my gas grill. Then, for the "oven" cooking, I transfer the cast iron skillet into the covered part of my grill. I have a thermometer probe with a long wire that attaches to the "alarm" outside the oven (or grill in this case) to make sure I didn't overcook. I was tempted to lick my plate, this was so delish! Very impressive & lovely main course.

Made with pork tenderloin (venison - $15.99 lb.) Reduction tasted burned so started the sauce over with fresh cherries. No thickener necessary. Delicious.

Rating: 3
My first time cooking venison and i think this was a great recipe to start off with. The only thing though is the next time i would use less coriander seeds. I loved the flavor, but they seemed to overpower the taste of the meat. Also, i did half and half dried cherries and dried currants, omitted the currant jelly and cornstarch (ugh!) and just reduced more, plus added a small bit of bone marrow I had to the sauce to thicken. Delicious! Lastly, I like my venison rare and to get that, you have to take it out when the temp is 100 then let it rest.

Rating: 4
Preparation is so simple and the tastes are fantastic! I couldn't find any coriander, so I substituted it with 1/4 tsp of cumin. I used dried cranberries, rather than cherries, which added a nice hint of tartness to the sauce. I cooked the venison over a skillet for six minutes, let sit covered with foil or ten minutes, and put in a 450 degree oven for two minutes while I was finishing up my sauce. This made for perfectly rare and medium-rare venison--just the way it should be! I cut up all the steaks into 1/4 inch slices and let everything sit in the sauce for a minute or two--allowed all those wonderful flavors to marry. I paired it this up with swiss chard, wild rice and butternut squash and have every intention of preparing this again and again.

Rating: 4
I was thrilled with the results of this recipe, as were my husband and son. I made this recipe with several variations. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries and used some roasted garlic and onion jam instead of the currant jelly. I used broth for the water also to keep the flavor intense. After searing my venison chops, I put them in the oven (where I had a side dish cooking) on a plate covered with foil while I finished the sauce. The internal temp was perfect and they were moist and tender. As my husband is a hunter, I will definitely be making this dish again.

Have made this recipe several times. I have made the sauce ahead and reduced it in a separate pan, then when vension is done, I add the cherries, reduced sauce, and other ingredients to deglaze the pan. No need to put vension in oven-too much risk that it will overcook that way.

I have never written in to a website to rate anything before; be it a book, movie or whatever. But I felt compelled to write in on the strength of this dish. It was simply outstanding. We paired it with some rosemary garlic new potatoes (actually, an Epicurious recipe called 'Crusty Garlic and Rosemary Potatoes') and a peppery Chateauneuf-du-Pape and the results were simply wonderful. The only thing I will try next time is not putting the venison into the oven (it was fine just being pan-grilled, I think). One minor alteration we made (with outstanding results) was adding the cut up vension back into the sauce and heating it through before serving... it took on some more of the characteristics of the sauce that way. We will definitely make this again! This won't let you down. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
I overcooked the venison and did not add the jelly to the sauce and it was still FANTASTIC. I substituted wine for water in the sauce and let the dried cherries soak in the wine for 2 hours before making the sauce. They got nice and juicy and were a fabulous contrast to the coriander and rosemary in the venison. I served with blue cheese mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli with shallots. We loved it.

A friend gave us a couple of venison fillet steaks, so I adjusted this recipe in respect to searing and roasting time. Since I was out of fresh rosemary, I tried a dried Herbs de Provence blend. Blueberry preserves substituted for the black current jelly. It was amazing. We had it with wild rice and spinach salad.

I made venison using basically this recipe on Christmans Eve; the major change I made is to use sour cherries rather than dried cherries (in game sauces, I like sour cherries because I think the sweet/acidic juxtaposition works really well. It was my first time making Xmas dinner in a house full of foodies, and everyone loved it.

This was an impressive way to serve venison to friends and family. I did make some changes: subbed h20 with 1/2 wine, 1/2 beef broth. The h20 made is less savory. I also preferred dried cranberries to cherries, better flavor and color. Had to adjust times for cut of meat. Time was too long for backstrap or filets. Overall a huge hit. I served it with acorn squash glazed with butter, brown sugar and bourbon. Yummy!

My husband was given a package of venison chops by a friend. I trimmed out the bones to form medallions, and just gave them a little less time in the oven. I have never prepared venison before, so this was a bit of an adventure for me. I loved this preparation. My grocery didn't carry the jelly, so I substituted red plum jam. Worked out fine. I'm going to try this preparation with beef and pork, too.

As a gal with a freezer filled with venison this recipe is a treasure! Not only did my husband rate it as 5 forks but he also wanted me to make copies for his dad and others! I did not use water in the sauce and I also doubled the sauce recipe as my loin was bigger. Served it with a red wine made for wild game (? sorry ?) and a stuffed squash and fresh green salad. All in all in was a dinner that we feel was superb. Thank you!

I had to make a few adjustments to this, but it turned out great! I used moose filets instead of venison, skipped the corriander and jelly, and used Williams Sonoma beef demi glace as the base for the beef stock. It was an amazing meal. I'm not sure if the moose was tender on its own, of if this recipe helped it, but we could nearly cut it with a fork. A keeper!

This is a recipe I'll have to try again in order to decide if it's really a keeper. The sauce was awfully intense - it totally hid the taste of the venison (I used wild game even). I added NO salt to season the meat or sauce, yet it ended up salty. I might have made my beef broth over-strength, though, which would account for that. This recipe did seem rather adaptable for other cuts of meat, however. We didn't have a tenderloin, so I used a variety of small steaklets and just played with the cooking times. Turned out surprisingly well, maybe a little overdone yet it didn't dry out at all. Definitely one I'll experiment with further.

I first made this recipe for 4 couples, and we all loved it(we live in NYC and go to some great restaurants). I have made it twice since and shared it with some southern friends who have very fresh venison. Everyone gives it really rave reviews. We are having it again tonight which is why I decided that I should answer this review section.

Like other reviewers, I modified the recipe using what I had on hand - pan seared round steaks, a pear/port compote, and a blackberry sage jam. That's the beauty of this recipe. It works beautifully even with significant modifications! Now, whenever I get venison I have my recipe!

Rating: 4
This was so easy and yet probably the best dish I have ever made. I don't have a mortar and pestle, so instead I clipped the rosemary very finely, and then mashed the mix with a spoon. The cherries were a great compliment. I'm going to make this every time my husband gets a deer!

we seared it for 6 minutes on high (4 on one side, then 2 on the other), and didn't need to put it in the oven. I added canned cherries and dried cranberries to cooking sherry for the sauce, and threw in a sprinkling of flour. We even omitted the corriander. This dish is amazing.

My brother-in-law stopped by with a tenderloin and asked me if I could do "something" with it. I had all the ingredients, so maybe it was good karma! The meat was delicately tender (and perfectly cooked) and the sauce was a lovely compliment. As in the photo, I served mashed potatoes, and roasted brussells sprouts with chestnuts and bacon. My dinner guests were blown away. (a hint for tenderizing venison: marinate in gin for one hour)

This is a great way to use a freezer full of venison! Easy and fast. I used steaks instead of tenderloin. I made the rosemary/garlic paste early in the day and while the steaks were still partially frozen, I poked them with a fork and then covered them with the paste. Had to substitute raspberry jelly instead of Black Current. My husband, even though he will eat anything, was VERY impressed with this recipe.

I made this recipe, using a moose sirloin roast provided by my Dad. Quite often moose meat can be very dry, but the searing process delivered a beautiful medium - rare roast that was further enhanced by the sauce. Absolutely amazing!

This recipe looked better than it turned out to be. I did overcook the venison slightly so I accept part of the blame. The sauce wasn't as flavorful as I expected. Try the port/cranberry sauce in another Epicurious venison recipe. Much better.

I had to sub a couple of ingredients; dried cranberries for dried cherriesand cumin for coriander seeds,and blackberry jelly for currant jelly. Also, my tenderloin was pre-cut into medallions, so I coated them in the paste and then dredged them in flour flavore with salt, lemon pepper,and onion powder. Turned out great! Can't wait to have a whole tenderloin to make it again. Try Rosemount Shiraz Cabernet with it, nice compliment.

When told that we were having venison tenderloins for dinner, my husband replied "But I don't like venison!" He was surprised to find, however, that he liked this dish! I used canned tart cherries instead of dried since I couldn't find them, and I skipped the oven cooking since my tenderloins were already sliced. 3 minutes per side in the skillet made them perfectly medium-rare, and the sauce was delicious.

This was outstanding! The cooking directions were perfect and the sauce was probably one of the best I have ever had.(My DH and I especially like berry sauces... We used Red Elk tenderloin, farm raised, and it was a perfect compliment. We will be making this again for a special family dinner planned for next month. I was lucky enough to find all the ingredients and it was worth the extra expense.

Wow! This was one of the best venison dishes I've ever tasted! I couldn't find the cherries or the black current jelly so I used cranberries and a mixed jelly (currents, cherries, & blackberries). I'm lucky to have a hunter husband who cuts his own meat, so we had a perfectly sized tenderloin for the two of us for Christmas dinner. I've been searching for our Christmas Day traditional venison dinner and THIS IS IT!

I made the venison this with shallot mashed potatoes, dried cherries, and brussel sprouts three years ago. A good friend of mine gave the medallions to me as a present soon after his hunting trip. I made this dish for another friend who I was interested, needless to say three years later I am married to him.

Wow! I made this for my wife for New Year Eve and it was incredible. I substituted with venison flank steaks from Dartagnan's. These are very thin, so I seared them on high heat, 1 min. per side. This browned them nicely, but left them rare in the middle and they turned out incredibly tender and flavorful. Sauce was awesome. Substituted with dried cranberries. Be sure to reduce the sauce to a nice smooth consistency. I paired this with a wild mushroom risotto and fennel & celery with prosciutto. One of the best meals I have ever cooked.

Rating: 4
Used a slightly smaller tenderloin from a wild yearling that fed mostly on the adjacent cornfield to where I got him. Skipped the first pan searing and roasted for six minutes total (3 minutes per side - rare). No cherries were available so I substituted a mix that included cherries, blueberries, cranberries and golden raisins. The sauce was a thing of beauty, deep red-brown. I rarely give four forks, but this deserves nothing less. Paired well with merlot/cabernet franc blend.

Made this for moose. It was okay, but I probably wouldn't make it again because I have better recipes. To the cook from Ottawa: If you tune in to this again, I'll send you a more "robust" sauce recipe for venison. Perhaps we Canadians appreciate the gamey flavour more. I can't imagine why anyone would want to soak the meat in Sprite to get rid of that flavour. You might as well buy beef or veal.

OUT OF THIS WORLD!! This was my first attempt at preparing Venison.I read the suggestion to soak in half vinegar/water, and did that overnight, then a friend said to marinate in Sprite, 7up or other clear citrus soda instead (for minimum 6 hrs.) Rids the gamey taste, so we did that today, for about 3 hrs. after draining the vin/water. NO gamey flavor and very tender. My husband says this one's a keeper.

We've been eating venison for over 30 years. We have tried cooking it in a variety of ways. By far the pan seared recipe is the best we've ever tried.

We made this tonight, and since we had roasted root veggies with it and we only have one oven, we started at 5:00 and ate at 8:00. But this is DELICIOUS! It had a wonderful flavor - do not stint on the spices, the more you add, the more wonderful it will be! Even my mom, who wouldn't normally eat "Bambi", liked it. We soaked the meat in half vinegar and half water for an hour to reduce the "gamy" flavor. We had a two pound piece that we think is a ham or a shoulder, not a tenderloin.

I didn't have coriander seeds, used ground. and used citrus type jelly for black currant. The recipe was utterly fantastic with wild venison loin from Wisconsin.

Delicious, I'm limited to what ingredients can be found in our small town grocery store, so had to substitute canned tart cherries, drained, for the dried. Also madiera wine instead of red, and added morels which I have dried from last year and need to be used before this spring comes with a new harvest of those tasty morsels. This dish made with my young venison harvested by my husband every year was AMAZING. I served it with spinach mashed potates, and balsamic glazed carrots. Pure delightful blend of flavors.

The sauce was too thin and light for wild deer and didn't really add anything to the meat (but didn't ruin it either). Perhaps with farm raised venison this recipe works but for the beautiful full flavour of the real wild stuff which is more gamey and even more tender, it is blah. Any suggestions for a more robust sauce?
