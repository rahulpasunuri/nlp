Wow, this is one recipe I didn't expect it could be so good. The tarragon and crushed fennel seeds give such exceptional flavour to the salmon. I loved the combination of the herbs that I want to put it on every fish dish I try. It was so light, so flavourful, so tasty~!

Very easy to prepare and definitely a perfect combination of flavors. Impressive for company too! I've made it 3 times and it comes out delicious every time.

I baked it with some kale in the pan which got crispy and delicious. I had no idea how wonderfully fennel & tarragon enhance salmon!

Rave reviews! We shipped ourselves a whole salmon from AK and had about 30 people over to eat it. We prepared my husbands family recipe, this one, and a few others and this one got the best reviews--it was really good!

it was very much enjoyed by all. The relish is a nice touch but it is still enjoyable without it.

Fresh salmon is a staple in the northwest, and our local waters yield a robust, rich & meaty product that stands up beautifully to the flavors in this recipe. I cut the butter in half, added a touch of garlic and thinly sliced shallots. This nice addition to our salmon repertoire. Fennel, both fresh and in seed form, is indeed one of the very best seasonings for salmon, though it may be too sophisticated for less educated or adventurous palates, so if you think your guests are frightened by assertive flavor, cut down on the quantity of fennel or switch to a dash of pernod in lieu of fennel seeds.

This recipe is easy and excellent served with the Cucumber Watercress relish.

delicious and so easy! the fennel adds depth to my 'old standard' salmon preparation of tarragon and lemon. Olive oil was a fine sub for the butter.

This was a last minute meal and I loved this receipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. It is easy and really yummy. I added chopped garlic too!

I substituted olive oil for butter due to my husband's dietary restrictions and it was still delicious.

What a wonderful dish. I have made it many times. It is delicious cold as well. I have served it as an entree (hot) and as an appetizer(cold) at my Passover Seder. It is so easy to make. I have passed this recipe over to many people.

Outstanding! This recipe is our new favorite. A great make ahead, super easy, and a crowd pleaser. Have also used "slabs" of salmon with great success. When made with the filets, tied them with string to form round medallions, a very nice presentation.

I make this recipe at least twice a week. It's easy on a work night, and delicious. I've substituted the lemon with orange juice and lime juice. Still delicious! It's a great way to get your omega vitamins!

I made this just becauseI happened to have the ingredients and was looking for something to prepare quickly. I ground the fennel seeds and used dried tarragon. I must say I was surprised byhow delicious it was. I will definely make it again.

Have made this dish several times now. I add chopped shallots to the butter and a little extra lemon peel. Be careful not to overdo it on the butter even though it's tempting: can cause too much smoke and makes the fish too rich.

Living in Seattle, we have lots of fresh salmon and I have had it many different ways. This is my favorite.

Test tried this recipe before a planned diner. Glad I did. Nothing special, lacking in flavor & delicacy. Lots of other good things to do with salmon.

I had a dinner party with 12 guests. I made this recipe and filet mignon (surf & turf theme). The guests raved about the salmon. Its easy, flavorful, kind of healthy and got me some raves!

We eat a lot of salmon but this is one recipe we won't have again. Sorry to disagree with another Cape Cod cook. Try Seared Salmon on Baby Spinach, Baked Salmon with Mascarpone Spinach, Salmon Wellington or Salmon with Roasted Asparagus --- they're all better.

I have used this recipe over and over again since first seeing it in the magazine two years ago. When I first made it I thought the butter sauce smelled a little gross, the kids even came in the kitchen to see what the heck I was doing. However, they and everyone else I have served this to loved it. Even people who weren't sure if they liked salmon, decided they did after tasting this recipe.

I cook low fat food for clients. I cut down on the butter. My clients were impressed and so was I. I have been a subscriber to Bon Appetit and Gourmet and others since 1969. It is very easy to look up recipes that I remember in stead of searching through magazines. Heaven forbid, that I could possibly get my magazines messy. Sincerely,

This is delicious and can be adapted to use with other fish filets or steaks. I used it with sturgeon and swordfish increasing the lemon to add moisture. Both tarragon and fennel contribute to the flavor just right.

I used half the fennel seeds and dill instead of tarragon. I also ommitted the tarragon sprigs and the lemon slices at the end. My whole family enjoyed this with the cucumber relish.

Easy to make, but fennel seed & tarragon does not go well with salmon in my opinion.

I also made a bernaise sauce to go with the salmon. It was a nice addition but was not necessary. I also made the sugar snap peas with sesame seeds and oil and the roasted potatoes. Very good with the salmon. I will definitely try the cucumber relish next time I make this. The Pinot Grigio was excellent with this. This is a company meal.

Not being a big fish person, I did enjoy this recipe. I cut the crushed fennel seeds in half, and may have used more lemon than specified, but it worked well. I'd make it again...goes well with sugar snap peas, asparagus and red potatoes.

This is a superb way to fix Salmon. My husband says it is the best ever. I used a rimmed cookie sheet and lined it with a double thickness of foil. I used a 2 1/4 lb. salmon fillet, whole, and place it on the foil, and topped it with all the flavored butter. Instead of 12min., I cooked it 20min. It was excellent, and moist. The butter began to brown around the edges of the salmon. This is definitly a company dish.

I thought the fennel was too overpowering. It ruined the whole dish. However, big fennel fans may feel differently.

This dish is easy and delicious and can be done ahead for the most part. The cucumber relish is a must.

So easy and so elegant. I served to my two sister's in law to be and they were very impressed. I would easily make for a dinner party because there is so little work involved.
