I made this as an accompaniment to a Crown Pork roast for our Christmas day dinner. It's excellent and a hit even for the fussy eaters. The flavor is unique and a pleaseant change to typical mashed potatoes. Jerusalem artichokes are also know as Sunchokes.

I thought this was a good recipe. I could taste all three of the main ingredents. The texture was great and the taste was unique. A well blended array of mostly unusual veggies. I will make this again for guest.
