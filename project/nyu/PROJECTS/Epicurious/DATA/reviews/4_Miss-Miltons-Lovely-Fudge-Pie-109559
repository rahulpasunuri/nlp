Very good. I used outstanding quality chocolate and cocoa powder, which is what's going to bring this home for you.If you're not going to do that it might be a let down. I will say the texture is unique; it's like a very light chocolate decadence, more like a light chocolaty meringue cake than a pie. It's great, but wouldn't give it four forks like other reviewers. Incredibly easy to make. But there are more delectable desserts out there.

I thought it was very easy to make. I must have baked it for too long because it wasn't gooey when I took it out of the oven nor when I ate it. But I did share it at a potluck at work and was complimented on it. I marked it as two forks because I thought it was just good, but that was probably because it was baked too long.

Wow!!.Sometimes the reviews are so good that I end up being disappointed. This was wonderful. I had to print out the recipe for "non -bakers" I couldn't find an 8" pie plate so I used one from a pre made graham cracker crust( tossed the cracker crumbs) I served it with whipped cream. Wonderful!!

This was extremely easy to make and very yummy! This is more of a brownie but very fudgey and dense. I used Lindt chocolate and made up some home-made whipped cream and added fresh raspberries (I omitted the confectioner's sugar). I'm glad I used the fresh berries as it was a good balance to the very rich and moist "brownie cake." Cutting into it was messy. This is very good but I wouldn't use it per se for a special occasion. Next time I will try the pecan, caramel fudge pie.

My family are all chocoholics and I know they would enjoy this cake. (Pie is a misnomer, especially if you bake it in a cake tin, like I did.)Delicious, not too sweet, and easy to make.

Simply divine. Incredibly easy & fast. The combination of Scharffenberger bittersweet & Droste's cocoa melded for an intense chocolate - but not overpowering - sensation. I used fresh raspberries & lightly whipped cream. Heavenly. I increased the recipe by 1/4 to fit a 9" pie plate. I think I'll try a cake pan next time for a prettier presentation. This is a keeper.

This received rave reviews at my party last night -- perfect texture in between cake and fudge. I made it in a 20 cm (just under 8 inch) springform pan lined w/parchment, and it set up beautifully and unmolded well. I also used light sour cream and it still turned out deliciously rich.

Intense chocolate dessert. I have made this recipe twice and have received good reviews. I made some changes following the first version that I believe added to the end result: 1) The recipe calls for an 8" Pie Pan which does not appear to be sold anywhere. In the first version I used a 9" Pie Pan, whereas in the second I used an 8" Cake Pan. The second version stood and travelled much better. 2) In the first version I used Ghiradelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet, whereas in the latter I used Sharff Berger 72% Cacao Bittersweeten which produced (as one qould expect) a more intense flavor. I found a vanilla or coffee whipped cream went well with the latter while the Raspberry Coulis was a better match for the former.

Didn't have an eight inch pie pan, so I used the glass cover of a round casserole dish of about the correct size. Now, I'll splurge on an eight inch pie pan...pie was great.

This is a really exceptional chocolate pie. I also skipped the raspberries and served it with whipped cream. The last piece was also delicious chilled the next morning for breakfast.

I made this for my birthday and then my six year old daughter requested it for hers. It is a cross between a flourless cake and a brownie. Really dense, gooey chocolate. So good, never mind the raspberry sauce etc. I just sprinkled it with the powdered sugar and ate it up.

Very good. i only had 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate -- I used unsweetened for the other 2 ounces, and it still turned out to be delicious.

YUMMY!!! Easy to make and just the right sweetness, not too much. The whole family ate it in one sitting. Raspberry coulis is excellent with it and on vanilla ice cream.

DElicious! I took out when batter was just set as stated and let it cool completely. It totally stuck to the parchment paper so I served it as a "relaxed brownie." Also, the top caved in. Any suggestions? I want to serve it again.
