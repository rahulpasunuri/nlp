Great recipe, was a hit for Thanksgiving. Loved the cornbread. Added 1tsp of Herbs de Provence to the cornbread mix. Also used ground spicy Italian sausage instead of cooked Andouille. Browned the sausage with the vegetables. Everyone loved it.

My family's loved this one. I've made it two years in a row for Thanksgiving and now they're twisting my arm to make it for Christmas.

We have made this for five Thanksgivings now, and will probably make it for as long as I can still cook. It is simply the best stuffing, and adds a wonderful dimension to the Thanksgiving dinner. Make extra--you will definitely want leftovers. I have nevera altered the recipe, but some of the suggestions in other reviews look great!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I used pork sage sausage instead. Definitely add toasted pecans and sautéd cremini mushrooms to this recipe. It's wonderful!

This is one of my all time favorite dishes ever! I have been making this stuffing for the last eight thanksgivings and will probably continue the tradition until I die. I never follow a recipe exact so how I vary this one is probably different every time. The green bell peppers are cut in half and replaced with red bell peppers, and I normally increase the cayenne pepper and add white pepper also.

I guess I'm an old-fashioned girl who likes her cornbread, sausage and sage stuffing. This was a little too different for me but my husband and daughter loved it.

More labor intensive than it's worth. There was so much stuffing, I had to use several baking pans to contain everything.

We have made this recipe almost every year since 1994, and many people have requested it over the years, so it is definetly a winner in our crowd. We love the spices, and it is never too dry.

I've made this recipe 2 years running. It's great with or without sausage. This year, I used a spicy Texas sausage that complimented it very well. I've made it with all corn bread and with a mixture of corn bread and french bread: I actually liked the latter better.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. My husband, who usually doesn't like any type of stuffing, took seconds and thirds. It was the perfect balance of spice, veggies, bread, and it was neither too dry, nor too soggy. Even though I perfer the milder stuffings, this one will become a staple at my future Thankgiving dinners.

This was good. The corn bread couldn't be easier to make and the stuffing is basic, so this is a no stressor. I baked it in a carved out pumpkin and served it as was. Everyone enjoyed it. (ok, I thought it was a little boring...but don't tell my husband) :)

This is a great sidedish! I will definitely be making this again.

Just finished a meal with friends. A perfect complement to blackened catfish and home made boudin. We finished the meal with beignets. Would definitely make again for friends and family. Enjoy .... we did!

This recipe was simply wonderful. I made it last Thanksgiving 1999 and 2000, and I plan to make it for Christmas 2000. Everyone has loved it. I even won a family stuffing cook-off. It is moist, full of flavor and very colorful.

This stuffing is very tasty, just the right amount of spices & veggies. We used a premade cornbread & it still was fabulous.

My husband loved it, but I did not because it is not the stuffing I used to know. He thought it was more flavorful than all the other stuffing he's had. He said that the smooth yet bread-like consistency went very nicely with the honey-orange ham I served at our Christmas dinner.

Everyone wants me to make this every Thanksgiving. I have decreased some of the fats and use homemade chicken broth to cut back.

This is one of the best stuffings I have tasted. Always garners raves. This is now a staple in my current rotation of dressings. The cornbread is also one of the best you will ever have, and for those southerners who don't like their cornbread too sweet just cut back on the sugar. I, in keeping with the theme of the stuffing usually use bacon drippings instead of butter to saute the vegetables. If you can't find shallots, this does just fine with onions.

I made this spicy cornbread dressing for my "we all think we are gourmets" family for Thanksgiving. They LOVED it and now want this dressing ever year. It comes out perfect. Great texture, lots of veggies, spices just right. The basic cornbread recipe is one of the best I've made. Worth making just the plain cornbread recipe for chilis and stews. Highly recommend it.
