Should have just made my old recipe...these were doughy and took much longer to bake than 30 minutes...not a very good flavour either...

Just okay. I halved the recipe to make regular sized muffins, subbed brown sugar and cut down a bit on the flour as suggested. Did not find them dense but they seemed a little lacking in flavor with just a hit of cinnamon and lemon. Might be the blueberries not being the best out of season.

Superb recipe which makes 12 jumbo muffins. We regard xs fructose as unhealthy and never use sucrose if we can help it. Here is the recipe with our healthier modifications. We always cook on a wood fired range which improves the flavor!! For fructose free muffins, these are my changes: 3 tsp baking powder. use 1.25-1.5 C glucose(dextrose) instead of sucrose reduce cinnamon to 1/2 tsp increase milk 1/8 to 1/4 cup or substitute buttermilk. add 1/2 -1 C nuts(pecans). add vanilla 1 tsp or grand marnier or cointreau for flavoring.

The muffins are great but the recipe is not it i not disceptive enough and has things in the ingredients that are not in the directions. Make shure you are really good at making muffins before you make these ones!

Loved it, took others advice & used only 2 1/2 cups of flour. Used 3/4c sugar.But I used the frozen 3 BERRY MIX FROM COSTCO. Amazing, moist, lovely. Just mixed the berries in with the flour mixture, did NOT put some in a FOOD processor. TRY THIS RECIPE AGAIN it was a winner for me. THX.

I've had better. Maybe it was an aesthetic thing, I didn't like the purple color that resulted from putting some of the berries in the food processor.

I was testing a few different Blueberry Muffin recipes for my students, I teach a high school cooking class and here is what I thought. These were so dense and not very sweet at all. They did pop right out of the pan, but they didn't rise well either. I don't think I would make this recipe again.

Perfect recipe! I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and had to add a bit more milk to improve the consistency of the batter. Adding blueberries to flour mixture before adding liquid also helps them to distribute evenly. Also sprayed Baker's Secret in muffin tin and skipped liners all together. The muffins flipped right out.

I was expecting greatness and they were so average that I gave them all away at work! Not worth it!

I didn't have a lemon, so I used the zest and juice of one large orange. I also didn't have whole milk, so I mixed 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of skim milk. They turned out great!

i made these after reading all of the reviews. i made some changes based on what people said. i reduced the flour by half a cup, i used high quality italian butter, thick organic milk, i ground up whole mexican cinnamon & pulverized cubes of demera sugar. the eggs i used were local & organic, so were the blueberries. i also added half a cup of local raw honey. they were plenty sweet & not as dense as some people said. it's all about the ingrediants. i made mini muffins & removed the foil as soon as they cooled. the reason the paper sticks is because of the massive amount of blueberries. i also did a couple of mini loafs which really impressed me. i thought these changes made the recipe fantastic.

Muffins these days tend to resemble cupcakes. For people who prefer something that's more of a breakfast than a dessert, I think you'll like this recipe. I say this having made it just once, with a few alterations to the original. After reading other comments, instead of lemon rind, I also used the extra tbsp. of lemon juice. I didn't have regular milk, and substituted almond milk. I didn't have a muffin tin for large muffins, so I made smaller ones (1/4 c) and baked for 20-25 min. yielding 36 muffins. I sugared the top of half of them. There wasn't a huge difference between the sugar-topped version - I don't think it's a game-changer w this recipe. They did not turn out heavy for me as others have found. They were not too light either. I was pleased. I gave 3 forks because they didn't knock me out. I liked them and will make them again, but don't think that they'd get that 'wow' response that 4 fork recipes do.

thought they were on the heavy side and very dense. Also not at all sweet. Agree that the paper liners were a problem. Wish I'd tried the sugar on top.

I absolutely love these muffins. They're moist and flavorful, and I love they make a consistent dozen. I use paper liners in standard muffin tins and fill them to the top and they spill over a bit but work very well like that (I hate having to pull out another tin for that last remaining bit of batter with other recipes). I also substitute a tbsp of lemon juice for the zest and top with sugar for added crunch. I make these at least once a month!

Definitely use only the foil liners and not the paper. They completely stuck to the paper I experimented with. And I sprinkled the tops with Demarara sugar, which was nice for crunch and a bit of sweetness. Also, I baked them 35 minutes and they still seemed a bit heavy and underdone.

edit: the regular sized muffin tins made 18 muffins. The last 6 I greased and floured the pan instead of using liners....they came right out without any problems. Sprinkled the tops of these lightly with raw cane sugar....wowsers, made a huge difference in the taste!

Heavier than I am used to and a bit cake like, but they taste delicious. Stuck terribly to the paper muffin liners. Came out of the foil liners just fine. Will use just foil (no paper) next time or maybe just grease and flour the pan. Made following recipe exactly.

This just didn't work for me - too much flour, I think. Muffins were heavy and a bit dry.

These are simple, easy, and delicious. I substituted 3/4 cup of the blueberries with frozen raspberries - so good.

These are delicious and very easy to make. Processing some of the blueberries really infuses the blueberry flavor throughout the muffins. I forgot the cinnamon and they were still great. Next time I make them, I may add a streusel topping, but they are yummy just as they are too.
