These were gobbled up at my house within days! It definitely takes more labor to make these, but it's worth it. I used mini choc-chips, and a melon baller to form the cookies, and the size was just right. A nice break from your standard chocolate chip cookie.

I love these. I added the extra flour and it makes them puff up and look really perfect. Really good chocolate chip cookie recipie!

So much haterade for these cookies in the first reviews from 2002. The first 2 or so pages of reviews are surprisingly worthless and offer no constructive criticism whatsoever. The reviews range from one worded responses from people who never tried the recipe to people telling you to follow the recipe on the Toll House bag... wow, how enlightening. There are some random knee slappers in there, including one that mentions an "arse", but overall they are very useless. You will find the best reviews amongst the first four pages offering slight variations and additions to this great recipe. I have never made this recipe per the original recipe because the flour and vanilla revisions just made too much sense. Adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour makes them more girthy and the extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla never hurt anyone. Live on the edge and make it an overflowing teaspoon while you're at it. The cookies could be considered salty for some, but they were perfect to me and even the folks who complained about the saltiness ate them up. They were chewy and golden and crispy on the outside edges and heaven in cookie form. I was personally never a fan of the Toll House recipe when I was a kid, and I think this recipe yields much better results. These three are a must: 1. Add 1/4 cup of flour, 2. Add another 1/2 tsp of vanilla (at least) and 3. Refrigerate, refrigerate, refrigerate!

I like the flavor and the consistency of the cookie (I added an extra 1/4 cup flour and used 1 tsp vanilla), however, the cookie had a greasy aftertaste. Any suggestions for how that can be remedied?

Rating: 4
Took other reviewers' advice and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Perfect! I was worried that the cookies were so soft and flexy at 7 minutes so I left them in for 8-9 minutes, but when they cooled they were hard and crispy so if you like softer cookies, the 6-7 minute guideline is perfect.

These are great - I keep bringing them to parties and everyone loves them. Even my partner who prefers just chocolate cookies loves them. For my oven, the bake time is off - I had to bring it down to just over 4 minutes.

Addictive little cookies! Use parchment paper to line your baking sheets. Use less salt than the recipe calls for. Refrigerate or freeze dough before baking. Delicious!

Rating: 3
Great idea and love the crispy edges but WAY too salty!! I used 3 scant 1/4 teaspoons and it was way too much. Will make again but with maybe 1/2 tsp salt. Also I made them normal size -- it made about thirty and took 9 minutes. Turned out very well except for the salt.

Rating: 4
These cookies are absolutely delicious WITH jbrook17's suggestion to add Chinese five spice! Heaven. I have had mixed results with this recipe - once they came out perfectly (and I refrigerated the dough a bit). The second time, they were too delicate and lacy and I didn't refrigerate the dough. I don't know if that's the reason, but they were way better the first time. Also, don't go crazy with the salt. These are wonderful.

Rating: 3
Honestly this deserves another half a star. I've made them twice and find them utterly delicious and actually easy to make. This is a tender cookie with just the right combination of flavors. I added walnuts the first time and pecans the second but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. My one minor issue is that no matter how long I creamed the butter and sugar (in my KitchenAid mixer), the sugar never fully dissolved. Has anybody else had this problem? Other than that, I can say that I've banished every other chocolate chip cookie recipe from my kitchen.

Rating: 4
This is a FABULOUS recipe. My only advice is to make on parchment paper and cook for 5 min only. I actually made a double recipe (which yielded about 300 cookies). It was totally worth the effort - people LOVED them. They were clearly the hit of my party.

Rating: 4
This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made. There is only one thing, and that is do 430 chocolate chips instead of 1 1/4 cups. My mother and I have made this recipe many times, and it was a great improvement when we did it with 430 chips.

Rating: 4
These were oh so good and crispy! Did not have mini chips but chopped up some chocolate and used a small melon scooper for the dough. They turned out so good and crispy. I went later that day and realized my husband had eaten half. He told me to hide them somewhere! Worth the effort of making tiny cookies. Cannot wait to make them again for my dad who only likes crispy chocolate chip cookies!

Rating: 4
These always come out perfect and such a hit with my family! Taaasty! I wouldn't recommend making them if you are on any sort of diet. They are pretty habit-forming and easy to blow any sort of healthy eating habits! But if that's not your case, then by all means...make double the batch! Follow recipe EXACT.

I made this the first time and got really pissed off because they burn so quickly and spread so much. But the ones that weren't burnt so bad tasted really good. So I decided to give it another try. This time I used better quality baking sheets, turned the temperature down to 180c and everything worked out just fine. Use mini chocolate chips! Tasty and crisp!

These turned out great! I did alter the recipe a little - added a bit more flour, used almond extract, added a little apple pie spice and used a 1tsp portion. It made me about 55 cookies this way.

Super tasty, a little crisp even straight from the oven. I baked them on an airbake cookie sheet (costco) using parchment paper. Cooled first on the pan then a wire rack. My boyfriend said I'd have to hide them or he'd eat the whole batch right here.

These are tasty little morsels but for some reason mine aren't crispy or thin. I followed the recipe exactly except I used chopped up dark Hersey's Kisses and unbleached whole wheat flour which I am guessing must be why. They are tiny and spread out nicely, but not like the picture and stayed soft and chewy. Regardless, they are really tasty and easy. Will make again and try regular flour.

I made these little cookies twice. The first time they were good, kind of like homemade famous amos like a reviewer said. The second time, I wanted them to be more unique, so I added a heaping teaspoon of Chinese five-spice. AWESOME! sweet, complex, cinnamony, and just a tad of spice. Yum!

Rating: 4
To update my review which is two down ... I used my supper heavy Cuisinart cookie sheets and they came out MUCH better. I was also able to cook them the proper time of about 5-5.5 minutes. I also left the last batch in a full 6.5 minutes and though they did darken a tiny bit too much at the edges, they are nice a crispy the next day. Even the lighter ones have a nice chew to them and aren't soft like the previous batch. Sorry IKEA, but goodbuy to those cheapo cookie sheets. I also increased the baking soda to 3/4 tsp from 1/2 tsp.

Rating: 4
Yummy! Only problem I had was that I used different cookie sheets and the cookies on the lighter sheet spread way too much and were very fragile. Taste was good though, and the batches on the heavier cookie sheets were perfect!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and they turned out great despite my equipment issues. I also used Callubet 70% chips which made them very sophisticated and not too sweet. The batter is super smooth and delicious even BEFORE it goes in the oven. I have a terrible oven (20" Summit, ha ha ha) so these guys seemed to cook in 3-4 min and were quite dark around the edges. However, I have IKEA cookie sheets and used parchment paper so maybe that was the problem??? They were excellent out of the oven and I slid the parchment paper off the sheet and onto my butcher block counter top and the next day they were too soft and I was hoping for crunchy. Maybe I should have put them on a cooling rack instead. I am going to try again next weekend.

Rating: 3
These were absolutely delicious, and a huge hit (for such a teeny tiny cookie) with my co- workers. I used 1 tsp. madagascar vanilla, dark chocolate chips, added 2 Tbsp. flour for high altitude and used parchement paper on the baking sheet which made cooling a breeze. The little 1/2 tsp. drops gave me cookies exactly as pictured and it was so cool to see the 30 cookies per sheet cooling on the countertop. Next time I'll add about half a cup of toasted pecan pieces & some orange zest. This is a keeper in the original form but will surely see a few mutations in my kitchen.

I used regular brown sugar and it turned out well. I liked the texture of the cookies when you add the egg before the flour. It turned out really smooth despite the chunks in my brown sugar! I used 1 and 1/3 of Guittard chocolate chips for extra chocolate, but it may have been too much. Cooling these cookies is essential and it's best to use a small sorbet scoop or similar to get the same visual results as the picture. I have a gas oven, and found that the first batch would need to cook for a little bit longer (about 8 and a half minutes) but the rest gets to a crispy brown in 7 minutes. I would use less salt next time. Just a few cookies will satisfy your sweet tooth!

Rating: 4
To Minn.regarding soft cookies. I had the same problem and read in a cooking mag that if you leave them on the baking sheets or even silpats until they are cool, they will stay soft. They need air to circulate,etc. It has worked for me. I let them rest for a min or so so they don't fall apart when I move them and then I put them on a rack to cool. good luck. great cookies

I was weary of making these cookies from some of the reviews, but this recipe has become my favorite for ccc by far! I made sure to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour, and 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1/2 tsp. I also made them slightly bigger. So tasty!!!

I love these cookies - small, tasty (not too sweet), mine don't spread out and when they're hot out of the oven they have a nice crispness to them, but are still soft in the center. Question for anyone who can help: my cookies lose the crispness almost immediately after cooling. Any suggestions? I make exactly according to recipe - maybe mixing too long? Do yours all stay crisp?

I actually read all the reviews and decided to give them a try, not only are they delicate little cookies, but their adorable. Everyone loved them. I added some 1 tbl. cinnamon to the batch, including 3/4 cup more flour so they wouldn't spread out to much. They came out like little chocolate chip nuggets. def. a keeper. those other people have no idea what they are talking about

These little cookies are the best! My new fave chocolate chip cookie recipe. I very much prefer a brown sugar chocolate chip cookie w/no white sugar and no shortening, so these are perfect for me. I think that you can and should make them teaspoon size because even with a Silpat mat, they brown almost too quickly. I recommend baking 4- 5 min. & my oven is slow. I too have always thought the Toll House recipe has a funny twang to them. These have just the right flavor.

Rating: 3
I quite agree with the other reviewers on the fact that it spreads a whole lot more than expected but it might be due to the temperature level in my area (Singapore) that disrupts the baking process, or also that my tablespoon used for dropping varies with the ones that the US uses. Looks aside, the texture was crisp & delicate with a nice crunchy finish when bite in the middle I tried a batch w/o the chocolate chips for better flavor and they are just the right amount of sugar in each sugar, not too pale to chase away your tastebuds & not too sweet either. They are a brilliant munch for a mid morning snack or midnight snack really, I might try it without the baking soda or less of it (or a blend of baking powder + baking soda) These cookies are about the closest equaivelent to the local cookie place in my area Famous Amos. Pretty good stuff, for a lady's tongue that is.

Rating: 3
These cookies are absolutely yummy. My kids loved that they were 'teeny tiny' just like them. There was no need to modify the recipe, but I used a teaspoon instead of a 1/2 teaspoon, and they were just right-sized. And, I let them cook about 7 1/2 minutes for a little extra crispy-ness. Goodbye tollhouse...

I almost went insane scooping out a hundred and fifty 1/2 teaspoons of cookie dough. But I suspect most cooks here have more patience than I do, and the end result was as I'd hoped: cute, classic chocolate chip goodness. Would make again, especially if I found a 1/2 teaspoon ice cream scoop =)

To make this recipe work, use mini chocolate chips, then chill the dough before spooning on the sheet. This will make them easier to make. These are crisp, buttery, and delicious. I loved the touch of salt. If you want to make them a little bigger when your patience runs out, they still come out ok.

I just don't see the point to making these little cookies. I like the idea of a small cookie, rather than the bloated ones we see so often, but these don't have any special flavor and take way too much time for the end result.

For the first time ever I read all of the reviews for these cookies and they were so funny. There are some bitter cooks out there. I LOVE THESE COOKIES. They are what they are, perfect, tiny, crisp cookies. For the me, the recipe is so simple, which is part of what I like about them and if you keep them small they do make quite a few. I have made these several times and they are always popular. I like to form the dough into long 3/4 inch roles (like a snake), chill it and then slice them (like slice and bake) What ever you don't bake now can keep for another time.

This is a very nice recipe, but it really only works if you want tiny cookies! If you make the cookies bigger, then they're very mediocre. But as tiny cookies, they're nice, light, crisp, and tender. It is a bit tedious to make so many tiny cookies, but they are quite good!

great! the tiny cookies came out just like the picture. thin and crisp and dainty. usually I wouldn't like that in a ccc, but they are cute and addictive and yummy. I got about 100 cookies. you really do make them 1/2 tsp. keep them small! they are easier to handle when the dough is chilled. I did them with mini chips which is a MUST!! I used a little less than a cup of minichips which was plenty. these are great cold oy of the freezer (unfortunately).

Sticking by the recipe as given yields crumbly cookies that are difficult to get off the sheet. Definitely add 1/4 cup more flour and make the cookies slightly larger -- a very rounded teaspoon instead of the suggested slightly rounded teaspoon. Bake for about 7 minutes. Still a little too sweet and crispy around the edges for my taste. I'd like a more doughy cookie. Not my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I made these for the first time on Mother's Day to bring to a party at my boyfriend's parents' house, where they were a HUGE hit! They turned out just right and were gone before the party was over (only a few hours after I'd made them, in other words), so I don't know how long they stay crispy. I made them again today and they're great - both times, I've used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, which go really well with the butteriness of these cookies. Highly recommended!

I was afraid to trythis recipe becauseof all the bad reviews but today is the second time now that i have made them. I and my family love them! I personally have never loved the tollhouse recipe, and one of my kids hates nuts in cookies so I haven't been able to make a strictly classic recipe anyway, We like the size of these and the combination of crisp and chewey. And the recipe works for me just the way it is printed -- though i also don't as many cookies as it says I should. All in all, my family feels this is the best recipe we have come across yet.

I had great success with these cookies. They were delicious, and everyone loved them, and I made them REALLY tiny. But when my friend tried to make them she had failure. We realized that she used margarine instead of butter. She made them again, and again they were 'wrong'. We finally figured out that if you alter the directions even a little (i.e. not using softened butter at room temperature) the recipe is not the same. I think this one needs perfect compliance to succeed. Good Luck!

CHILL OUT! This recipe was fine. Sure, it's a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe, minus the white sugar and nuts but I'm sure with an ounce of creativity you can rectify that. I made these for a bake sale and they were quite popular. I like the size of them and will consider making smallish cookies all the time now. I substituted grated semi sweet chocolate for the chocolate chips. And they do only make about 75 cookies.

These were a complete failure for me. What did I do wrong? Did they need an altitude adjustment for Colorado? Is there really no white sugar in this recipe? And should it have had more flour? Something went really wrong. I liked the idea of mini-cookies, but I will not try this recipe again.

Before you criticize a recipe, remember the ART of cooking is learning the basics and technique-not reading recipes.As a former chef/owner,it's hard to put some things on a piece of paper.
