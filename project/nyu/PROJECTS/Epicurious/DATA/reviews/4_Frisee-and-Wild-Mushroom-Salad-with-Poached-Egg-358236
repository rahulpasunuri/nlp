I made this as is except I soft-boiled eggs instead of poaching (I'm afraid of poaching; will try it sometime when I am feeling brave). Also used grown-up (not baby) arugula because I couldn't find frisee. It was excellent nonetheless -- perfect summer dinner with minimal effort.

Add crispy pancetta and it takes it to a whole new level.

I've made a version of this salad w/o mushrooms many times, and the mushrooms added a new dimension. Save yourself some angst with the eggs though, and use those silicone cups to poach them -- much easier!

This salad was a wonderful addition to a lovely spring dinner. The runny egg and those delicious mushrooms are the perfect combination. I have a general paranoia of poaching eggs so several years I invested in a French tinned egg poacher and have been poaching perfect eggs ever since.

Simple and delicious. We added crumbled bacon and garlic croutons the second time we made it - I don't know if those additions added that much in terms of flavor, but hey, it's bacon :-).

Excellent, easy and light. I normally use a poacher, but followed the instructions for poaching exactly and the eggs were perfect with no lemon taste.
