Very disappointing. The sauce needs more "bite" such as more ginger or maybe hot sauce. I also had to boil the sauce down to get anything approaching the thick and sticky called for in the recipe which made it far too salty.

Delicious! I modified with brown sugar, and roasted a half batch of wings with baby carrots, a corn cob cut into 3, and 4 whole cloves of garlic. With almond slices in quinoa on the side, this was a HIT.

I have made these wings dozens of times and have always enjoyed them. I find that using a glass baking dish and lightly spraying it with PAM makes clean up a breeze. As far as the wings themselves, I don't expect "complex flavors"--save that for more serious recipes. Do check and turn the wings after the first 45 minutes to keep the sauce from burning.

Unfortunately the site police keep removing my comments. If you see this one, here's the recipe to use: La Brea Tar Pit Chicken Wings 1 cup soy sauce (low sodium is OK) ½ cup hearty red wine (cheap is OK) 9 tbsp. sugar ¼ tsp. dry ginger 2 packages chicken wings (approx. 24)  Preheat oven to 375°F  Cut wings into 3s (discard tips or use for stock) and put into a 9 x 13 foil-lined pan  Mix other ingredients over low heat until sugar is dissolved; pour over wings  Bake for 45 minutes, turn and check after another 3045 minutes The recipe got its name from the La Brea Tar Pits because I was living in LA when I started making them. The sauce doesnt have to be thick, sticky or look like tar to be delicious & but the name stuck.

I am about to make this dish again, around two years after first serving it to guests. (We all loved it. It was gone lickity-split. I don't recall problems w timing, but I tend to check dishes periodically. QUESTION: 4 lbs. or 24 wings? I bought a 2 lb.-pack of wings w tips already removed and there are 24. I was planning on making 1/2 of the sauce, but now suspect I'll need at least 3/4 of the amount since I doubt 24 tips weigh even as much as a pound.

As is, I wouldn't make this again following the directions. Cooking time is way too long, should take 1 hour and 10 minutes MAX for total cooking time. What I do is turn the wings after about 40 minutes, increase the temp to 410~425 and cook for another 20~25 minutes. One should keep a close eye on the wings once it hits the 1 hour mark to prevent burning (especially with the sugar in the marinade.)

I have made this several times. Do use a good-quality soy sauce, low-salt or otherwise, and a decent red wine. I substituted brown sugar for the white and used fresh ginger and plenty of freshly-ground black pepper. I find that lining the pan with Reynolds no-stick foil is a huge help. And I cook the wings for way less than the recipe called for. You want the sauce thick and bubbly, but it proceeds to burnt and yucky in a matter of minutes.

I wish that I had read the reviews before making these. I would have sued a different pan and cooked them for less time. I got the recipe from the new Gourmet cookbook (the one with the yellow print that you can hardly read) and it says you should bake wings for 45 minutes initially and then 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes after you turn them over. Not only did I ruin a pan but also the wings. The wings were over cooked and the presentation looked awful. For something to look so bad, it needs to taste great.

Rating: 3
I used half a teaspoon of fresh chopped ginger with the dry and I liked it. The flavor was different from the standard teriyaki wings and I liked the addition of the wine. I lined the pan with foil and had no problem. The wings were a bit dry but people seemed to like them.

Hi: I'm the cook from Brookline who posted quite a long time ago. I make these wings all the time and love them. What a surprise when I saw you on TV....was it the Jane Pauley show? Anyway, I continue to recommmend these wings highly.

I made this exactly according to the recipe. Used a shallow foil baking pan, didn't crowd the wings, correct oven temperature...took all the reviewer's suggestions for making the sauce gooey instead of runny. And after 1 1/2 hours of cooking the sauce was still runny. Another 1/2 hour of cooking would probably have thickened it, but I ran out of time. I think the flavor was just adequate. But how appealing are tiny chicken wings that have been baked for 2 hours. Nothing outstanding. The sauce tastes like an unexciting teriyaki with not much going on except sweet and salty (no surprise given the ingredients). Not a bad recipe, I just find no reason to repeat it.

We've made this dish several times and we love it. It's just so easy and the flavors are great. It helps to triple-line your pan or baking sheet with foil for easy clean-up. I turn the wings every 20 minutes or so, cooking them for a total of about 60-70 minutes. Wonderful.

Loved the recipe however from now on I will us Lite Soy Sauce because it was to salty for me.

Rating: 4
I make this recipe often with two adjustments: using drumsticks, not wings. I use a LOT of fresh ginger. When bake them for an hour on each side they are too dry so I recommend 45 minutes per side. They are always sticky. Using a glass pyrex baking dish isn't too hard to clean up.

Rating: 3
I'm confused by the reviewers whose wings burned. My wings, while tasty in a teriyaki-chicken-kind-of-way, never developed the sticky quality for which the recipe was named. I cooked them for over an hour. I did use a disposable pan; perhaps that is the difference?

Rating: 1
The wings were sticky, tender and pretty to look at HOWEVER, they tasted terrible. Mine had a pungent, bitter, slightly scorched taste to them. I followed the recipe as written.

I double the sugar-and use brown sugar. A good chianti seems to work well. Fresh ginger root is a nice touch too.

I wish that I had followed a previous reviewers suggestion to use a disposable pan. The sauce BURNED quickly and in the process I scorched a brand new Caphalon roasting pan. Also, the wings cooked much faster than the recpie suggested they would. All this for some pretty boring chicken wings. Sigh. But my three year old son (who requested wings in the first place) is enjoying them. The blackened pan awaits me.

Make sure you use disposable pans. The sauce is sticky, and burns easlily, but if you are careful, is very worth it. Everyone raved, and could not stop munching. Just be sure you don't ruin a dish over it.

Have made these several times after receiving rave reviews whenever we bring them. I use light soy and dilute with a little water (maybe 3/4 cup soy, 1/4 water). Will try with brown sugar tonight.

I'll make this dish again but choose a less pungent soy sauce, so that they're still flavourful but the sauce is not the only thing you can taste. They didn't get very sticky but I didn't mind. The big plus is that they're extremely easy to make.

WE LOVED IT! Excellent flavor, no recipe adjusting needed here. I will certainly make this again.

Unfortunately, could not get these sticky enough! Leaving them in the oven any longer would have overcooked them. I found them bland. Anyone found other good wing recipes?

YUM YUM YUM! Everyone loves this. Used foil once and then parchment the next time to line baking vesel - parchment is better - foil tore (I'm clumsy). I have made it verbatim many times, but have also added powdered garlic, sesame seeds and pineapple juice (was short on 1/2 cup of wine) and it turned out just as well.

I used various small chicken parts and the flavor was yummy. I had to let it sit in the sauce for hours beforehand and it did not get really sticky. Kids and adults both raved.

I loved this recipe! I used "Lite" Soy sauce, and did not notice too much salt in the recipe. Many requests to repeat this one.

Finally figured these out: To get these nice & sticky(not runny), do not use an insulated pan! They become thick when using a single layer 9" x 13" or similar pan...

This recipe was delicious and easy. The flavors blend together so well. I made it for a baby shower that my wife was having for a friend and there were no leftovers. I did not change anything from the recipe although the brown sugar sounds like an interesting idea. Be sure to line the pan with foil.

The wings turned out great even though I lost my head and did not follow the instructions. I marinated with the "sauce" uncooked. Oops.I substituted with brown sugar, added scallions, garlic and red pepper flakes like "mtomlison". I also lined my cookie sheets with foil for easy clean up and they still turned out really good! The sugar burns quickly. I checked after 20 minutes and turned over and finished the other side with another 20 minutes.

I feel qualified to rate this recipe even though I added some scallions and garlic and lots of hot pepper flakes -- the concept was the same, and the sauce wonderfully gooey. My husband loved loved loved them. Maybe just a little too salty, next time I might heed the advice given here about the sugar/soy ratio. But will definitely keep this recipe and make again -- with my additions. I have a great non-stick roasting pan and it cleaned right up, no problem! Served as a main course with the Asian Bow-Tie Pasta Salad with Shrimp and Vegetables (also from epicurious) and the combination was very nice. SHRIMP AND VEGETABLES

I REALLY!!!!! like this recipe. I too used brown sugar because the molasses in brown sugar helps to cut down on some of the saltiness of the soy sauce. On the second cooking time start checking after about 20 minutes or you may burn the whole batch. As others have stated, line your pan or use a throw away pan.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe. Wenever I'm invited somewhere people ask me to make it. I put the wings and the marinade in a plastic bag, bring along large disposable trays and cook them at their house. Don't know why some people said their wings were runny - mine come out nice and sticky. I followed the recipe exactly using a hearty burgandy wine and large wings. Do not reduce the cooking time (I did once and they were a bit runny). Definitely use disposable trays - or line with foil - it's a mess to clean up. This recipe will always be a keeper in my house.

This basically just a simple teriyaki chicken, but without garlic and red peppers and onion and sesame oil. The wine was an okay touch but sherry would have been better. I would just find a good teriyaki recipe before I ever did this one again.

They didn't get sticky, but they did get GOOD! Make sure you line the pan you're using with foil, rather than slug through all that cleanup (even though there are some good tips in other's reviews here).

I almost didn't make this recipe when I saw some criticism others had. But be patient! It's tasty. One key: Get some large and lean wings from the butcher, not the tiny fatty ones from the grocery store. That will cut down on the grease and increase the meatiness. The sauce is sweet and salty. Despite the title, don't expect the sauce to turn thick and black; it will be runny. But the flavor is excellent.

Rating: 4
I have used this recipe many times and it always turns out great! I do use very shallow, disposable tin trays, which helps the sauce thicken and makes clean up easy. And I also trim off the excess fat when splitting the wings, which keeps the sauce from getting too greasy. Always a crowd-pleaser!

Rating: 1
I has very high hopes for this recipe, with all the excellent reviews. I used regular soya sauce like it calls for, instead of light, which I normally always use, and the wings were sooo salty I couldn't eat them! I've never has a worse meal! My boyfriend said they were just "OK", and he likes just about anything. I was really disappointed, but the number of 4 fork reviews this recipe has gotten makes me want to try it again, this time with light soya sauce. That many people can't be wrong.

This was great! I've had my eye on it ever since it came out in the magazine. Hubby finally said I could make something other than hot wings! He is so glad I chose this one. I did cook mine for 1 1/2 hours, and my sauce never got "sticky" but I'm sure that was because I was using a high sided pan (an aluminum turkey roaster left-over from Chex Mix) but that was fine with me. I had 4 wings that I couldn't fit it, so I just threw the leftover sauce in with those wings and I'll cook the others for lunch! And one thing about cleaning the pans. I've found that an overnight soak using denture tablets will get almost anything off, and anything that's left is a lot easier to clean (especially the stainless steel coffee mug and glas tea pot). I think the next time I will just use my cookie sheet and soak it overnight to see this "sticky-ness." BTW..the wings turned out nicely browned, but I don't bother cutting and separating, I just cook them whole if it just us or some close friends. It's easier on the cook, and hubby says it's easier on him (I do cut a little slit in the skin between the drumstick and the 2 boner part so it separates easily, cutting the little tendon thingy."

Baked it less in the second period, as others have said. Still, the sauce never got sticky, though--just sort of greasy. The wings were okay--my guests seemed to like them, but I was really expecting more from the way some people raved. I added garlic to the sauce and some Korean hot bean paste to spice it up, and while the final product was relatively flavorful, I'm sure there must be better oven-baked wing recipes on this site.

This was so salty it was inedible! Even my salt-loving husband couldn't eat it. Also, the wings themselves didn't brown, just the sauce around them, the skin itself was still pale & fatty under the sauce.

A little salty. I use low salt soy sauce. Also, I boil down the sauce either before adding it to pan, or along the way, removing it, boiling it and then returning it. This keeps the wings a little moister as they don't have to cook as long while the sauce is reducing.

I made these for a Halloween party and called them bar-b-qued bat wings. They were delicious and I would definitely make them again. I followed the warning from previous ratings and lined my baking pan with foil, however the sides of the pan were low and they bubbled over. I had the "La Brea Tar Pit" in the bottom of my oven.

This is a winner! A great dish for a Super Bowl party or informal get-together. I used small chicken legs and added granulated garlic and Chinese chile sauce for a kick. I brought them into the office and have shared the recipe with a dozen or more co-workers who raved about them.

I've made this two ways, once where I marinated the wings for hours, and once where I threw it over at the last minute. I would definitely only make this at the last minute. In this case, less is better. It's the coating, not the soaking, that defines the flavour.

I bought wing drumettes - the big juicy part of the wing only, that was nice. I also used fresh ginger and cooked it less time with a little of the sauce held out so it got "tar pit" consistency. I got it ready ahead of time, so I let the wing drumettes marinade for 2 hours as well. It was so good that the 4 pounds served 4 as an appetizer. I tried it 2 days latter with drumsticks, and didn't like that so well - flavor didn't get in, but I didn't marinade it.

I made these wings for a house warming party because it takes minutes to put together then you throw it in the oven and let it go (definitely use one of those throw away aluminum pans, or you'll be sorry). Needless to say, these wings went so fast I had to bribe someone to get the last one!!

I cooked mine at 350 for about an hour, turning every 10 minutes and I found that a bit too long- it's important to catch them before they burn or they'll taste like La Brea! Use a good quality anodized aluminun or a cheap throwaway - cleanup isn't pretty!

these wings were outstanding!! I do recommend no cooking them the full 45 mins after they are turned or else lowering the heat as the sugary mix will burn. Use a nonstick pan or ana aluminum throw away - I almost threw away mine!
