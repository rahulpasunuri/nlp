one fork is generous. I just wasted over an hour prepared these, and they are a huge failure. I should have been suspicious of a latke recipe calling for as much breadcrumbs as potatoes! The no-oil recommendation made matters even worse. A huge disappointment.

Served these with Baked Pork Ribs with Hoisin BBQ sauce (on this site). These latkes have a unique ginger flavor, but I'd question the chef's call for no oil in the pan. For me, they came out a bit dense and puck-like, even though I avoided over-handling them while forming. Might be that I used panko instead of bread crumbs, though previous reviewer seemed to experience no ill effect. Next time I would flatten them further and I'd DEFINITELY cook them with oil in the pan to achieve some improved exterior crunch. Great hoisin rib recipe, btw!

These were great but I must admit I used the recipe as a base and didn't do the Asian flavors. I used and panko bread crumbs and two mini potatoes. And topped with lemon cream cheese and smoked salmon for one of a trio of appetizers for dinner tonight. They were great. Next time I will try with the ginger and some kind of sweet chutney.

My husband paired this with a grilled Asian Lamb, with a coconut peanut sauce....it was a delicious accompaniment. I will definitely make it again.

I made these for Chrismakah last year and they were a hit! We're definitely making them again this year. Yum.

For Chanukah this year I thought I'd try something different and these Latkas were GREAT! They fry wonderful (most likely the bread crumbs). I topped them with some savory applesauce recipe on here. Great recipe ... probably if I make a more traditional recipe I'll add matzo meal but these were great.
