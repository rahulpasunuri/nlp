I gotta say, this sounds more like a granita recipe than sorbet. Granita is yummy, though. :)

i did this recipe with a few small changes and it came out great. First i whipped the Coco Lopes in the food processor, then instead of the exstract I added amaretto. I started the freezing process, and when half way through I folded in toasted slivered Almonds. I topped with Bitter sweet chocolate shavings and toasted Coconut shavings. It was great

Made it by the recipe and again with the variations suggested. I love coconut but this is not a make again recipe - in both instances it was just generally sour as in "gone off" and quite a stomach churner.

So good and so easy. Definitely freeze in an ice cream maker to ensure a smooth consistency since, yes, the Coco Lopez is a gross mix of oil-n-blobs straight out of the can.

The Coco Lopez cream of coconut has lots of additives and a chemical taste I didn't care for. It would probably be better with pure coconut milk.

I used the juice of one lime to cut the sweetness as well. Make sure to shake the can of coco; I forgot and mine came out in a thick blob and oil. I would recommend putting everything in the blender to get the globs out. Also, freeze in small individual containers for easier eating! Fabulous taste!

No creme of coconut at my local grocer so I used 1 can of coconut milk, 3/4 bag of shaved coconut too! Really good, and not very sweet at all (but in a good way). Garnished with some extra shaved coconut for a sweeter topping. Inspired me to buy an ice cream maker...

I made this to go with molten chocolate cakes and grilled pineapple rings, it was great

So fabulous! And easy if you use an ice cream maker. I didn't have rum extract so I used about 1 tbsp rum, but hardly noticed it. My lactose-intolerant/ice-cream-loving boyfriend loved it - creamy w/o the cream.

I agree that this recipe is much too sweet, and that the canned cream of coconut does introduce an odd flavor if it's too strong. I diluted it with one 13oz can of coconut milk and added 2T lime juice and some chunks of fresh coconut meat, and the result was still too sweet. I think I'd use one part cream of coconut to three parts coconut milk or some regular milk product (fresh or evaporated) next time. Watch out that you don't add too much rum; I found 1t worked for my diluted double batch, but if you want to use more than that, add it after the mixture has already frozen.

I made this with cream of coconut, pineapple juice, 1/2 juicy lime. Froze it, scraped it and topped it with Pineapple rum. Wowza! It was so easy!!

Very easy with very good results using an ice cream maker. I used Malibu rum instead of the extract - may take others' suggestions & add lime juice or something to cut the sweetness just a tad.

Coco Lopez is one of my favorite cooking ingredients, and it is delicious in this recipe. It may be a good idea to shake or stir the contents of the can before use. As with most foods, the fresher it is, the better it is!

The reviews for this dish were so high, I was expecting too much perhaps? Maybe someting was wrong with my cans of coco-lopez, but the rum flavoring was foul! Next time, I would try using real rum, or perhaps Malibu. We couldn't get past that taste to enjoy the dish. It was also over-the-top sweet. I will try this again before rating it, and really, really hope it lives up to the high reviews!

This dessert is simply fabulous!! It's quick and simple and can most definitely be adapted to one's palate.

A very refreshing dessert - tastes like a Pina Colada. Couldn't be easier to make.

Very good! Very easy!. If you pour it in an ice-tray and freeze it, you can then use the cubes in pineapple juice, instead of ice-cubes.

ridiculously simple, and sinfully wonderful although i did add half a cup of lime juice, just to make it good (i hate coconut, so the fact that i gave it four stars is evidence to the fact that the recipe is awesome.) anyway, i loved it

THE BEST!!!!! I have worked in several 5 star restaurants, this has topped all of them.

this was yummy....i added just a sprinkling of shredded coconut on top and served it with two lemon wafers.....divine! would i make it again? absolutely....this recipe provides scope for the imagination!

Yummm! Very easy (especially in an ice cream maker). I added chunks of candied ginger, about 1/4 c. Be sure to thoroughly mix the cream of coconut before freezing--I made the mistake of thinking that the ice cream maker would mix it adequately, and it came out a little lumpy.

The is THE easiest thing I have ever made, and it was so good. It has such a creamy texture when frozen, and if you like coconut, you will love this. I might recommend carrying around a timer when you are making it, though, because of the half-hourly stirring thing.
