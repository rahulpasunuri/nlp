As some others have suggested, I make this as a casserole and use buttercup rather than acorn squash. We have access to great wild rice here in Toronto and it is the star of the dish in my opinion. The lemon, sage, onion and cranberry are just accents and they work with flavourful rice. It's a staple for my intermittently vegetarian kids!

I was almost discouraged from making this based on the other reviewers. However, it was terrific. As others mentioned, it's a great starting place to which one can make adjustments. I used bulgar wheat instead of wild rice and pine nuts instead of hazel nuts. Very good!

Everyone liked it, it's healthy and not hard to make; in other words it is an ideal dish.

Alert! This recipe will not win anyone over beyond having a cool shell to serve it in. The recipe is balnd (I shoudl have listened to the poor reviews). I tried everything suggested - cooking the rice is chicken stoce, adding fresh sage isntead of dried, adding parmesan. It was pretty dry and bland.

I make this dish as a casserole with butternut squash that I bake for 30 min at 350 F for for 30, then peel, seed and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. I cook the wild rice in broth, either chicken or vegetable broth. I use fresh sage and substitute pine nuts. Yum.

I have made this recipe at Thanksgiving for my vegetarian family and friends for two year now and they love it. It is not only delicious, but festive. I use toasted almond instead of hazelnuts, as I personally don't like hazelnuts. Also, one of the Lundberg dark rices like "Jubilee" rice give it a very interesting flavor. I make it with olive oil, not butter and vegetable stock so my vegans can have it.

Great starting point recipe! I added leftover turkey and some black kale that I had lying around. Great way to use up bits and pieces. It's like Thanksgiving in a Squash :)

This is a great fall recipe. I had good luck with it the first time around. I didn't use lemon juice and subbed fresh sage for the dried. I also used olive oil instead of butter. I'd recommend giving it a go, especially if you can find some great acorn squash at the farmers' market!

Loved it as is! To make it even better, I would put more cranberries, and add a bit of broth before it bakes in the oven. The portions are a bit big, you can cut the recipe in half and would still have enough for 6!!!

Disappointed. I thought when I tasted the mixture before I stuffed that it was good, but the flavor got old fast when they were done. The hazelnuts were way too overpowering, wish I would have left them out.

can't wait to try this recipe...my favorite ingredient to add to recipes that need a little meat is chorizo (the good stuff, not the pre-packaged). I will definitely add that to see what kind of a punch and texture it gives. Loved reading all the reviews and the suggestions.

This simply does not taste good. The flavors don't meld well together and it's a waste of really good ingredients. The presentation is nice but the filling should be changed in order for the taste to match the presentation.

I made this recipe as written, and it was delicious, easier to make than it appears when served--it helped fool my guests into thinking I'm a culinary genius. The rice stuffing made much more than would fit in the squash shells, but it was tasty as a leftover the next day. Don't skip the hazelnuts, they add a subtle flavor that makes this dish extraordinary.

I have used this recipe for more than 10 years as the vegetarian alternative to my Annual Thanksgiving buffet feast for 30+ friends and family in the UK. Everyone loves it. And this year I will substitute margarine for the butter so my vegan friend may also enjoy! Adding more cranberries can provide extra flavor. Toasted pine nuts are also great instead of hazelnuts.

Rating: 4
This sounded so good! Only after reading all the reviews and noting the changes, did I go ahead! My husband and I both love it. I find it to be very versatile...I used roasted pecans, more dried cranberries than called for and instead of rice, I used KASHI made with chicken broth. It could easily be a main side dish. I'd make it again and continue to play with it!

This was a little too dry and not much flavor. Try SAUSAGE-STUFFED ACORN SQUASH WITH MOLASSES GLAZE. I combined that recipe with this presentation style and it was a hit!

Rating: 2
This dish was so-so. I am disappointed at how the acorn squash did not really stand out at all. If you're looking for a recipe where acorn squash is the star, I would not recommend this. I used the pre- cooked wild rice from Trader Joe's, which is really good. I also added parmesan and used toasted walnuts instead of hazelnuts. Using the recommendations of others, I added apple chicken sausage, which I felt really made the dish. Without the sausage (or equivalent veggie substitute), I think this dish would be a little too bland and blah. I also added twice as many dried cranberries as was called for and I'm really glad that I did. I probably would not make this dish again. Too much effort for a less than stellar dish.

Rating: 3
turned out great! Good call on adding a touch of parmesan. Helped bind everything together.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I made it easier by skipping the sauteing -- instead roasting the onions in the same pan as the squash. I quartered a raw onion and coated it with olive oil, then left it in the oven the same amount of time as the squash. Then I chopped it up and mixed it with the rest of the ingredients in one bowl. I also tucked a couple of unwrapped whole garlic cloves into the cavity of the squash. When the squash was done, I squeezed the roasted garlic into the bowl, too.

I thought this was so good. Used vege broth to cook the rice, as recommended. Plenty of flavor, even using dried sage. I was just making this for 2, so cut down on a lot of the ingredients, though not necessarily proportionately, so my rice/squash ratio was about even (about 1 c. each, cooked). I think the recipe calls for a lot more rice to squash, but not sure. Skipped the hazelnuts and sprinkled parm chs. over the top before baking. I'd make this for guests next time. Incidentally, it was much better than the stuffed squash we got prepared from Whole Foods for Thanksgiving last year.

Rating: 3
My husband and I liked this dish. I added ground beef to the mixture to make it a little more substantial meal for my husband. I also added a little parmesan cheese to the top after stuffing it. I think next time I would add parmesan cheese to the whole mixture and maybe some mushrooms. I would definitely make it again. It's a great healthy dish for the fall. I like acorn squash and was looking for a recipe for awhile.

Rating: 3
Scrumptious, provided you make a few changes, as noted by other reviewers: I cooked the rice in chicken stock, used fresh sage, upped the salt at each stage, and subbed oj for the lemon juice. Terrific side dish with a great presentation! Goes really welly with pork.

Rating: 3
Well, I should have read the reviews a bit. This was REALLY bland as indicated by many, and I ended up making some revisions, in addition to adding lots of salt and pepper: 2T fresh sage (i/o 2t dried), juice and zest of 1/2 orange (this, with the salt, really punched up the flavor), double the cranberries and hazelnuts; left the hazelnuts whole for a different size in the mix. Next time I'll cook the rice in salted stock. This is too yummy, healthy and seasonal to not work on some more. This was a great side with the pork roast w/onion and apple chutney from this site.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and nice presentation. Following other reviewers suggestion, I used chicken broth instead of water for the rice. I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts. My husband doesn't like sweet and savory dishes, so if I make this again, I will omit the cranberries, but add more walnuts, as well as, salting the squash before I bake it.

Wow! This was a really impressive recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and even my non-vegetarian friends went crazy over it! One suggestions- use vegetable stock to cook the wild rice instead of water. It adds a whole lot more flavour.

My husband said this was the best thing I've made. (I tend to disagree, but it was quite good.) Use a good wild rice with a lot of flavor. Omit the lemon juice and parsley. Triple the hazelnuts and cranberries... I actually used dried cherries which I like better than cranberries. Use fresh sage. If you reheat after filling the squash, cover with foil so they don't dry out.

Very tasty! I left out the sage and lemon juice and added hot curry powder and tumeric. I also cut the recipe in half. The cranberries and hazelnuts add a lot of flavor & texture. Highly recommended.

I made this dish for a group of one vegetarian and seven carnivores; all of them loved it. I used four squash and increased the other ingredients by about 25%, but I had a lot of leftover filling. I used fresh sage, and added the curry powder and apple suggested by another reader--I thought the fresh sage was essential and the curry powder was nice but not necessary. The apple was barely noticeable. I served it with lemon cream mushrooms, from this site, and salad. A very satisfying dinner.

This was a lovely dish and had a lot of pungent flavor. It was just the right thing for starting into the holiday season. I made it with just one acorn squash as a dinner for two, and after reading other reviews I probably used more of the herbs than the recipe originally called for. I also used a box of wild rice with a seasoning packet. My partner loved it.

I made this with a few minor modifications, mostly based on earlier reviews. The result was beautiful and quite tasty, but not exceptional. The next day, the filling texture wasn't as good but the flavor was improved. Ingredients: I used pecans (yum!), added chopped apple (a worthy addition), and added curry powder (2:1 sage:curry ratio, which added the flavor many people thought was missing without being overwhelming). Method: Timed it so everything was ready at the same time and I didn't have to reheat the squash/stuffing. Thanks to the earlier reviewer for the tip about cutting the squash (bake it for half the cooking time first); it worked great! I think a much better wild-rice-filling recipe is in the curried chicken and wild rice strudel recipe. I might try that filling in acorn squash in the future. A much better winter squash recipe is the roasted butternut squash, rosemary, and garlic lasagne recipe... it's one of my all-time favorite recipes!

Rating: 3
The seasoning is crucial here -- I under-seasoned and spent a lot of time repairing the damage. However, the outcome was worth it! If you time it well, the baking isn't necessary -- just cook the rice and the acorn sqash at the same time, and toss all ingredients while they're still warm. And for a one-dish meal, I tossed the stuffing with shredded chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken. Yum!

Beautiful dish - I made it as part of a vegetarian Thanksgiving and it came out wonderful. The only annoying part was trying to get the skins off the hazelnuts! That was both messy and difficult. Perhaps I'll try pine nuts next time to eliminate this step.

Based on my experience and what other reviewers have written, this seems to be a dish that pleases vegetarians (like me) and leaves meat-eaters (like my guests) wishing it had been topped with gravy and served as a side to turkey or roast beef. The presentation really is impressive ... I used one 2-lb. butternut squash, and placed the halves on a platter sprinkled with dried cranberries and pecans. I think the dish would be greatly improved if it weren't baked ... the brightness of the herbs and lemon juice vanished after 25 minutes in the oven. If I were to make it again (only for other vegetarians), I would serve it immediately after combining everything in the saute pan and heating it through.

I've made this for friends and it is my boyfriend's FAVORITE dish! It looks beautiful and colorful when served in the shells. I substitute fresh sage for dried, use toasted pine nuts instead of hazelnuts, and brown rice instead of wild. I think these substitutions go a long way toward improving the taste.

I made this for a dinner party with broiled red snapper and red kale. It presented beautifully and my guests really liked it. I used sweetened cranberries as suggested, which worked well, and very handy (and surprisingly good) precooked wild rice from Trader Joe's. I think I would try curry next time, as another review recommends. I did have a hard time removing the skins from the hazelnuts, even after toasting them. Any tips?

I just made this for the main dish in my Thanksgiving meal. It was a really good basic stuffed squash recipe, maybe the best I've tried. The wild rice gave a really nice texture, and the cranberries added a really nice zing. Normally I make dishes with more "oomph" to them, but this was a great basic. Next time I might add curry powder. A few tips for previous reviewers. First, with all recipes from Epicurious, you need to add salt and pepper to taste with each step. They rarely mention this, and it's essential to develop full flavor. If you're having trouble cutting the squash, I just learned a neat trick. Put the whole, uncut, unpeeled squash in the oven for about half the cooking time called for. The squash cooks from the outside in, so by then the skin will be just tender enough to cut more easily. The inside should still be firm enough to be able to spoon the seeds out easily. Then continue to cook as the recipe directs until it is completely cooked. (Do NOT try this with spaghetti squash though!)

We have several vegetarians in the family and this is our holiday staple. It goes well with the rest of the traditional meal, unlike other recipes I have tried, and looks beautiful. I cheat a little and use a box of Near East long grain and wild rice mix, plus the seasonings. I also add a package of Morningstar Farms' sausage patties, crumbled up, to add protein for the vegetarians and flavor for all of us. It really is good this way - even the kids eat it.

Rating: 3
I think that the key to this recipe is the lemon juice. I made it once without, and it was very bland, so make sure that you taste it after you've added the lemon juice and add more if necessary. I always use fresh sage and walnuts instead of hazelnuts, because that's what I always have on hand. I often add a shallot in with the onions (because I love them!). I've used slivered almonds successfully, too. I think that maybe hazelnuts are the wrong nut for this dish, and that walnuts have a depth or earthiness to them that matches the nuttiness of the wild rice and the sweet tang of the cranberries. I use Craisins, which are sweetened some, which may make a difference with the balance compared to other dried cranberries.

The first time I made this, it did look nice in the squash shells, but was rather tasteless. I read everyone's reviews and thought I'd try it with additional spices and baked in a casserole, not in the squash shells. It was still pretty tasteless. There must be something more favorful to do with acorn squash.

This recipe came out delicious and was a nice surprise for my guests at Thanksgiving. Since this recipe produces a lot, we cut the squash into quarters so that everyone had a taste without having to fill up on it. The dried cranberries is the magic ingredient.

This is a great main dish for vegetarians, the nuts add a needed richness. It's good looking on the table. It's too much to serve as a side dish and the squash halves would be hard to cut in pieces and still retain their appearance.

I agree with Sarah, the portion is too much for a holiday meal side dish. I baked it in a 9x13 instead, and while the presentation was not as awe-inspiring, it was still a very pretty addition to the table. Also, I think that folks who would not take a huge portion of this were willing to try it because they could take a spoonfull instead of a "squash full". I had to add what seemed like alot of salt, but overall, this was quite tasty.

Rating: 4
I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit. I used more hazelnuts than the recipe calls for, and I used them whole. The only problem with doing this for Thanksgiving, is that even with small squash, each portion is pretty big, and therefore somewhat dominant. Hard for most people to finish, with a plate full of other Thanksgiving things. It's best as a main dish with perhaps a few grilled vegies. I'll make it again, but if I do it for T-giving, I'll cut the squash into quarters, not halves.

I chose to use brown rather than wild rice, and this was pretty bland, in terms of texture. Also, baking it the second time around made it really dry. If I make it again, I'll definitely use wild rice

After reading the reviews, I also added some spicy Italian sausage and used about 2/3 wild rice to 1/3 brown rice blend. Our guests (whom I consider to be gourmet cooks, also) were very complimentary. I plan to make it later this week again, for a couples' holiday dinner party - I'm bringing the vegetable dish, and don't want to have to opt for yet another variation of green bean casserole to go with the ham. Its festive presentation and flavor will be appreciated. (Don't the others who complained of blandness ever taste their cooking in the process and "adjust according to taste"?)

I have made this recipe many times over the past couple of years, and it has never failed to delight, particularly those who are making the best of a vegetarian Thanksgiving (and I mean the best!)

Instead of butter for sauteing the onions, I diced 2 slices of bacon and fried them crisply. I sauted the onions in the bacon pieces and fat. I added this with the recipe. Also, I left some of the hazelnuts whole for added crunch. Everyone seemed to enjoy the combination of rice, nuts and fruit.

Way-way to much rice for 3 squash. I made 4 and had 3/4 of the rice left over. Doesnt anyone try these recipes out before publishing them?. I was a little worried about the bland comments by other reviewers so added some truffel olive oil, cayenne, and saffron. It turned out well and all seemed to enjoy, except the kids who took a look and said "yuk!".

My boyfriend selected this receipe for Thanksgiving. After reading the reviews I made a few changes and was delighted with the results which were pleasing both to the palate and the eye.

This dish had the makings of something gastronomically exciting, but it really had no flavor. The 12 oz of wild rice was way too much for three small acorn squash and overpowered the squash flavor. It needs more spice; i.e., more sage, thyme, rosemary -- something. This is too much work to have a result that isn't outstanding.
