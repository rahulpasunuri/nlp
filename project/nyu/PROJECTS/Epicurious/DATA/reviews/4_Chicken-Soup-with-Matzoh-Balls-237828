This is a very nice, basic recipe that yields a very authentic result. My only complaint is that it seems a little bit peppery -- next time I would use less pepper. The chicken stock provides a lot of flavor and seasoning, the amount of pepper seemed out of kilter, and I did not even use fresh ground. Definitely make again!

Great recipe - very clear-cut and easy. They were light and fluffy. I didn't bother with separating the eggs, and they came out fine. The "approximately" for the measure on tge matzah is definitely worth paying mind to. I tripled the recipe, and found I needed to added another cup if matzah for it to form a soft batter - it was liquid with the straight measure. Definitely will use this recipe every time!

I would suggest cooking a bit longer. Simmer for 30 didn't cut it. Boil gently for about 25 minutes. Delicous!

Mark Bittman's recipe is the BEST matzoh ball recipe I've ever used. No fail, fluffy, tasty. The minced onion gives them a great taste! Enjoy!
