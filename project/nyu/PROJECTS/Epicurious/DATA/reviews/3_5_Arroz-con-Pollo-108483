My family loved this dish, and so did our company. It is involved - really 3 hours from beginning to end, and that's with only 1 hr. marinating. I removed the skin from the chicken (except wings) to decrease fat. Still tasted plenty rich and wonderful. I did not use olives or pimentos - not a fan - and cut back a bit on the salt and still found the dish rich with varied, complex flavors. The marinade is excellent. Have to remember to use it for other things. It is an effort, so I do save it for a special occasion and/or company. The nice part is that you have time to get other things together during the final 20-25 min when it's in the oven. I look forward to having the reason and the time to make it again.

Delicious. We both loved it and I'll definitely be making again. For me, it took much longer for the rice - about 45 minutes. And like other reviews said, it makes a ton of rice. I don't mind the leftovers because I freeze them. I followed the recipe and used the small (3-4lb) natural chickens so in the future I'll add 3 legs or thighs so there's more chicken left to match the amount of rice. I also used all chicken stock instead of water and added about a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika. Everything else I followed according to the recipe and the flavors were delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe very much and highly recommend it. The spice and marinade combination provided a level of depth and complexity to the overall taste. My chicken pieces were perfectly browned and caramelized thanks to the wonderful marinade; and the cumin/saffron added a deep earthiness to the flavor of this dish. I took the advise of others, by reducing the amount of salt - there was sufficient brine from the olives and pimemtos, as it is. I did change up a few cooking techniques for efficiency sake. I marinated the chicken in a large plastic bag instead of a bowl - making for a much cleaner transfer process prior to browning the chicken in my dutch oven while also containing the marinade in a splatter proof manner. For some reason, the rice was not fully cooked after the 20 minute cooking time in the oven- so I added more chicken stock and finished the cooking process on the stove top for another ten minutes. Overall, this is a wonderful version of arroz con pollo and I plan to make this again and again.

I changed a few things in this recipe because I am not a fan of tomatoes with rice or peppers. I, also, used chicken thighs only plus brown rice so I won't comment on cooking times. I recommend this recipe for the mix of marinade, spices, onions and garlic. They are delicious! The marinade for the chicken left it moist and tender. I imagine if you like tomatoes with rice and peppers this recipe as directed must be very good. Some commenters recommended adding paprika. As much as I like paprika, I would've missed out on the subtle flavor of the saffron. I tasted the onion and chicken broth before adding the rice and I would recommend that for onion soup. This recipe took time but it was worth the effort. I would use it again.

This is a fantastic recipe! I've been eating chicken and "yellow rice" all of my life, and this was the best I've ever had. All of the ingredients were perfectly balanced. The chicken was moist and tender. Be sure to carefully lay the chicken on top of the rice to keep as much of it as possible out of the liquid for better skin texture. This will be my definitive go to recipe for now on!

I loved this recipe! I have never made Arroz con Pollo before so this was my first experience. I made a few changes that others made and it turned out great, the only thing I would have done differently is add more heat (crushed red pepper!) I used smoked spanish paprika, brown rice (add on a good 30 min longer than with white rice!) sherry versus wine (I added a 1/2 cup) and put chorizo in as well. I used boneless chicken because I had some in the freezer, I will definitely use bone-in chicken next time. I also didn't do the olives and used roasted red peppers that I had in a jar (for quite some time, it was the perfect opportunity to clear out a bottle in my tiny pantry!) All in all I think this recipe is a keeper. The man LOVED it and I packed him off with a great lunch today.

Delicious. Reminds me a lot of paella. I made it with all homemade chicken broth and did not add the water. I used chicken breasts, cut into thirds, which I added later, as instructed, so they wouldn't over-cook. Only added half the salt, which was plenty. Be careful of over-salting! Very flavorful meal. I'd serve this to a crowd.

For those wondering about a substitute for the expensive saffron, you can substitute with Bijol. Its a product easily found in Miami, Fla. supermarkets and cuban grocery stores.That's what is probably used in most cuban households there.

I made this exactly as the recipe states (with the only addition of some smoked paprika with the cumin; a substitution of one red pepper for one of the green peppers, and jarred roasted red peppers from Trader Joes instead of the pimentos). It came out beautifully. My 9-year old told me that the rice was so delicious he wants me to make rice for him just this way. There are lots of layers of flavors-yum.

Salty and soggy. I followed this recipe exactly, and I kept the pot in the oven for an hour. Even after an hours, the liquids weren't fully absorbed. It cam out more like gumbo. I decided that I had to eat it since I made it, and I found it to be too salty. Perhaps after playing with the recipe, it can be saved, and it seems to be a good base for this recipe

I made this over the weekend and it was amazing! I used swanson chicken broth, instead of stock. I used Adobo-Goya instead of salt, I omitted the flour from the chicken & I used brown rice instead of white; I was trying to make it healthier. It was great, I added peas and corn and looks really colorful, but most importantly it was delicious! I'm eating the leftovers as I write this. Even my Hispanic roomate said it tasted just like her mom's. Thank you for a simple recipe.Irish Setter

My husband and 10 year old son really enjoyed. I did subistitute red pepper for green as that's all I had on hand, and I also cut back on the salt a bit as it sounded like a lot. Also, I had no pimientos. All in all it was tastey and fairly easy. I will make this again. The cooking times were spot on for my oven.

This variation of the Spanish/Latin American chicken staple is exceptionally good. The combination of flavors and textures really keep the taste buds engaged. It's key to marinate the chicken for an hour before cooking (and turning often) because it not only flavors the chicken but tenderizes it as well. The only change I made was to use all chicken thighs and to use 1 tsp cumin along with 1 tsp hot Paprika. I was skeptical about how the rice would turn out, but it was perfect. Looking forward to making this dish again!

Very yummy. It was my first time to make arroz con pollo and it turned out like I had imagined. The only changes I made after reading reviews was 1. I only used 1t cumin. 2. I added 1t sweet smoked paprika and 1/2t hot smoked paprika. I think this added lots of flavor, could use more of the hot smoked paprika if your not cooking for kids. 3. capers instead of olives. I will make this again!!

As I am eating the leftovers while writing this review, I realize that it is better next day. With that being said, I made a mojo marinade (from a reviewer of mojo recipe from this site), marinaded for 6 hours. I lighly fried the chicken ( I used mostly legs). I used beer instead of water as per suggestions. Up the garlic a bit. The only complain is that it took almost 50 minutes to get ready in the oven. Served wiht Cuban black beans and mango avocado salsa.

This dish has great flavor. I used a arborio rice to give it a little extra texture and creaminess. I also added the rice before the liquid to toast it a little bit (as in making risotto). My one critique is that there is way too much rice for the dish. Next time I will probably cut down to 1.5 cps and use less liquid.

Rating: 3
Husband made this for me for my birthday - it was a huge hit with our family. He took the skin off the chicken (flavorful and very tender) and cooked the dish in a Lodge Dutch Oven. He added a little cumin to the marinade which gave it a little extra boost. Will definitely make again and think the skinless version makes a great dinner for family and friends.

Delicious! .

Loved it, but would like to try it in a big, shallow pan, like a paella pan. That way the skin of the chicken pieces can sit above the liquid and hopefully remain crispy. Aside from lack of crispy skin it was perfection. Flavor was rich but comforting, and texture of the chicken was absolutely perfect. Not really a company dish as is because the lack of crispy skin makes this a bit homey. But if the paella style pan works to keep skin crispy, I think this would be a great company dish. As is, it is still a must have dish for non-company. Changes I made that I think were likely insignificant: used more stock instead of the wine, used orange bell peppers, used a big sprig of thyme instead of bay leaf, and used all dark meat (four cut up legs) with a bit of excess fat trimmed off.

I ended up using what I had on hand, which was salsa instead of the tomatoes, more chicken broth for the water, a mix of green, red and yellow peppers, a mix of basmati and jasmine rices, and no saffron. I'd like to try it with the saffron next time, as my half-Cuban husband noticed it was missing. We hardly tasted the cumin, so I might use more next time. I will also use more chicken, because the amount of rice in this recipe can support it. I appreciate the warnings about the cooking time for the rice. I gave it 40 min instead of 20, but the total time it took to cook the rice was a bit over an hour. The chicken was moist and delicious. This recipe wasn't as good as my husband's Cuban aunt's recipe (which is "in her head" only, and we can't get it out of her), but it was close.

If I were to be served this in an expensive restuarant, I would be very pleased. I think that is the measure of a great recipe, and this one certainly qualifies. I made it EXACTLY like the recipe stated, and it turned out wonderful, with a brilliant yellow color and a pleasing, exotic, perfectly balanced blend of flavors, with a gentle heat. There are several steps in the prep, but they are all clearly explained and easy to follow. I used a large, oven-safe soup pot with a non-stick surface and that made the browning easy. The timing worked out exactly right; although it seems like a lot of liquid, the rice absorbed it all in 20 minutes. Everyone loved this dish and I look forward to making it again soon.

A 4 forker for us. I used basmati rice, and only chicken thighs, added a bit more of the juices to the marinade, and 1 tsp. of southwest seasoning. I would add more olives and peas next time. It was highly flavorable and done in exactly the amount of time specified. A winner!

Rating: 3
Time consuming, but the flavor is worth it. I made it with brown rice, which yielded a really great texture and some added healthy points, but took more like 45 minutes to bake than the 20 they say. I also used all dark meat chicken parts, which saved me a bit of time breaking down my own chicken (and worrying over the moisture-- or lack thereof-- of the chicken breasts). Next time, I'll try others' suggestions and substitute beer for water. Likewise, I'll be adding a bit of cayenne for heat. -Sabrina

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. I think he'd give it more than 4 forks if he could! I use whole chicken legs, cut the cumin to 1 tsp, and omit the pimentos. This time I added about 1/4 pound of shrimp when the rice was about 1/2 cooked--delicioso!!

This was AWESOME. I used boneless breasts and it saved time although I'm sure bone-in breasts, legs, and thighs wold have been even better. I used all water instead of stock (forgot to add the cube) and it was just fine. This is a a keeper and I will make again and again.

yummy, but as others said,the timing on the rice is way off. I had to cook mine 40 minutes and a bit of the rice was still not done. I doubles the garlic, replaced the water with beer and added 1 chopped jalapeno. Next time I am going to give the rice a 15 minute head start before I add the chicken. Maybe that will do it.

Delicious, if time-consuming. Topped with toasted sliced almonds, which is a real coup de grace. I used brown rice, simply precooking it in the chicken broth and water for 20 min. before using it as directed; worked beautifully (though I would reduce the cooking liquid by 1/4 c at least). Omitted the peas. Subbed celery for onion (hate onion). Added some nacho-jalapeno juice to the marinade, which was great. Next time (yes, there will be many) I will reduce the cooking liquid even more and NOT saute the veggies: they can exude their juices into the rice, and I can cut out that step.

I made this recipe without marinating the chicken to save time. Next time I will definately marinate. The flavor was authenic and wonderful. My family wandered through the kitchen asking when dinner would be ready. The saffron flavor is beautiful. The measurements are spot on. I used red and orange peppers instead of green and did not add pimentos. I plan on using only boneless thighs next time, but the skin is essential for flavor and texture. I will use this recipe to entertain guests. I used arborio rice and the texture was perfect.

My husband I loved this recipe. It was pretty simple and turned out great. I even have a pretty bad reputation for cooking rice, yet it turned out perfect. I would have liked it to be a bit spicier and expected the rice to be more yellow from the saffron. I might cut down on the cumin like many others have suggested and add a jalapeno next time. Does any have the secret to good yellow rice?

Every member of the family enjoyed this dish. I made it mostly as written, except for substituting Basmati rice and double the garlic (I can't help myself). The flavor was excellent, and I did not notice the cumin-heavy presence which so many have mentioned. Next time, I will make this with thighs only, probably boneless, because the young-uns do not like pulling the non-edible parts off the chicken. Though, I certainly understand that the whole cut-up chicken is vastly more authentic. The tase of this dish is so far removed from the usual flavors around our house, that it was more than worth the time to make. Loved it.

So good! We really loved this dish, it was a nice change of pace. I used a few of the suggested included here with great results ... marinated the chicken overnight, substituted beer for water and added a jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced. I used a package of chicken thighs simply because I had them in the freezer. I also found that it took much longer than 20 minutes to cook the rice, but that's most likely because I used a pretty deep pot. This made more like 6 servings for me (and we are big eaters!).

Authentic flavor. An easy and delicious "one pot" dinner. Leagues above the scary, synthetic yellow rice and bland chicken that characterize Arroz Con Pollo in far too many "Cuban" restaurants. One word of caution, it took far longer than 20 minutes for the rice to become tender and absorb the liquid in my rather deep pan. Other than extending the cooking time, this is a recipe I will keep and follow to a T.

I made this last night for a dinner party of nine and it was absolutely fantastic!! One of the best recipes I have ever made. I made some of the suggested modifications, such as using beer instead of water and I added capers instead of olives. I also went light on the cumin and I halved a jalapeño and let it simmer with the vegetables. Everyone agreed that the heat kicked the dish up to the next level. I also bought prepackaged yellow rice so I did not have to fuss with the saffron, but I would not make this dish without the saffron flavor. It really added to the dish. I will definitely make this dish again! Everyone raved!

This was an excellent recipe. I decreased the amount of cumin as many of the reviews stated too much of a cumin taste. I also added chorizo in lieu of a suggestion of andouille sausage. I used 1/2 cup less water, and increased the amount of white wine by 1/4 cup. I used a good pinot grigio. For the reviewer who wanted to omit the saffron- you can purchase it on line, or vigo makes both an arroz con pollo seasoning mix and/or a small container of saffron threads that won't impede you from making this dish. You can also add paprika to give the rice that golden appearance. If you decide to add Paprika; use it sparingly-less than 1/8 of a teaspoon. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts rather than the whole chicken. It worked very well, as I cut up the breasts in 1X3 inch strips. My dinner guests asked to take the leftovers home!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Huge Dissapointment!! Tons of work for very little flavor! I used all, I REPEAT all of the ingredients this recipe called for, and the only flavor I could taste was the cumin, which overpowered everything. It tasted like a taco bell taco (too much cumin).

Awsome. Easy to make and enough for a large group or 2 nights dinner. I liked the olives, but was going to leave them out. Glad I didn't.

Or can just brown the chicken and put in an oven-proof dish or pan with a tight fitting lid.

Not only was the recipe wonderful as written, the chicken alone is a wonderful dish. I simply browned the marinated chicken (marinated for 2 days) in a pan and then baked it in the oven in all its juices at 375. WONDERFUL used in a cold chicken salad. Next time I'll try it on the grill.

This was one of the best arroz con pollo recipes I've tried. I changed the cooking directions a little - I didn't simmer the dish for ten minutes before adding the rice. Instead, I added the rice along with the chicken, brought the mixture to a boil, covered it, and placed it in the oven for 30 minutes. Then I added the peas and olives, covered it again, and baked it for another 15 minutes. My family loved it! They were not crazy about the olives, though, and I didn't have any pimientoes to put in the recipe, so I will probably leave those out next time. But there WILL be a next time! This was truly a very good dinner!

I made this dish for my CUBAN husband for Valentines day, and he said it was just like his Tia's (Aunt). I don't like olives or pimentos normally, but I made the recipe exactly as written and, you know, I really liked the olives and pimentos in it. I was very surprised about that. I served this with my husband's favorite,Yucca in a Cuban mojo; i.e. a lot of garlic sauted with spanish olive oil and lime juice, and my favorite, sweet plantains. Both wonderful compliments.

Overall, the dish came out OK, but I'm not sure if anyone really tested the cooking instructions. Timings for each part of the recipe were way off, and I'm still trying to figure out why they wanted the thick chicken breasts to cook less than the rest of the pieces. More hassle than it was worth.
