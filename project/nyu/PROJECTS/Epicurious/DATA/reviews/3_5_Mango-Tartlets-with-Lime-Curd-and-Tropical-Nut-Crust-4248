A perfect Kosher for Passover dish if you substitute kosher margarine for butter. Keep an eye on the crusts, as mine almost burnt at around 14 minutes. It's true that the nuts will run you between $15-$20, but it's worth it for a nice occasion. The four-inch tart shells were actually a little more than one person needs, so next time I will bake them in my very small tart tins. The curd was excellent. I boiled it in a pan straight on the flame (didn't have a metal bowl or candy thermometer) and it still worked great. Just be sure to keep watching it closely so it doesn't scorch. The mangos were the same color as the curd, so I would use strawberries or candied lime peel for a better color contrast. The guava jam was gross. I tried it on a sample piece and decided to omit that from the recipe. Everyone liked this recipe a great deal.

WARNING: Do NOT send your significant other out to locate macadamia nuts with out warning him/her that: A) they're a pain to find, and B) they're extraordinarily pricey. But dang this was good! Even sweetie agreed that the tart was worth the $20 in nuts. The custard set up well and the crust was easily made in a food processer. I have some nuts left over--maybe I'll make another... This was really, really good.

Wonderful recipe! The combination of mango and lime is quite delightful. I changed the crust just a bit by using butter -- and not the egg white.(just didn't have the time to beat the egg whites up) I'm sure it would even be better with the original. I will definately make this again

This is a great summertime dessert with lots of tangy flavor. I used a full-size tart pan and it came out just fine.
