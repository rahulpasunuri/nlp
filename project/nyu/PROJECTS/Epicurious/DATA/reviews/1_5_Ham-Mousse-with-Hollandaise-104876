I am usually able to doctor up a bad recipe but this one is hopeless. It is baby pablum bland. The hollandaise kicks it up a notch, but a great sauce makes even a slice of Wonderbread taste good. Unless you are cooking for chronic complainers in a retirement home, save yourself a bit of trouble and open a tin of deviled ham instead.

My mousse rose well while cooking, but quickly collapsed when cooling. I would give it one more try with changes: 1. omit the salt 2. process ham more or use processed ham, mine had dry crumb-like consistency which I didn't like 3. beat egg whites and cream a little more

This needed sauce just to cover the bland, salty flavor. I am not sure what happened, but I followed the instructions to a tee and the texture was strange-grainy in the top layer and kind of slimy underneath. I have made salmon mousse before and it turned out great. I don't know what happened here.

This mousse is very tasty, but using the amount of ingredients given in the recipe results in a mousse that's only about 1 and 1/2 inches high, when made in the size loaf pan listed. Next time I'll double the quantities.
