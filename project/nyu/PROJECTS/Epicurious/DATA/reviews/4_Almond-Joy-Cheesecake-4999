This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made or ate. It's fairly easy to make and always a crowd pleaser. The only thing I have done is reduce the amount of almonds in the filling. Wonderful!!

I have been making this recipe for years. It's always a crowd-pleaser. I had two people ask me for this recipe today. Brought it to the office to celebrate chocolate day. It was a big hit.

Not much like cheesecake. We really wanted to like it, but it wasn't creamy, almondy, or coconutty, despite the presence of all those ingredients. I'm going to invent my own almond joy cheesecake.

I have been making cheesecakes for at least 15 years and must say this has to be one of the worst cheesecakes I have ever eaten, and I love almonds joys, they are one of my favorite candies. The cake turned out perfect and beautiful, byt overall I would say there was too much coconut and sliced almonds in the filling, and way way to much coconut extract. The only saving grace to this disaster of a cheesecake is the glaze, which was delicious. Would not make again. I am surprised that a cake with very good ratings on this site, failed so miserably.

Killer cheesecake. I had to use 6 tablespoons of butter in the crust and baked it for 1 hour and 50 minutes. Yes. That's one hour fifty minutes. This cheesecake could go up against anyone's.

Outstanding! I've made this over and over with the same results. Good to the last crumb.

Made it for my boyfriend. The best cheesecake I have ever had!!

I am truly amazed that someone could make this, taste it, have others taste it, and still give it a bad review. All I did differently was add an extra Tablespoon of coconut extract. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and couldn't believe how wonderful the results were. I can't wait to make it again.

This is such an amazing cheesecake. Everyone who tried it loved it. Even today, I have a few pieces I was saving to give to friends, but I can't stop slicing slivers off of it for myself!! I will DEFINATELY make this again, soon.

I should have paid more attention to the reviews. This recipe was easy to make but a little time consuming and not worth the effort. It really lacked flavor and wasn't worth the calories. I'll never make it again.

After 20 yrs of cheesecakes, one of the best recipes. Made a few changes. Used macaroons in crust. Mixed choc chips in batter. Increased choc to cream ratio in topping for shelf stability and circled pan with whole almonds.

Outstanding. Very rich. I used a larger springform pan and didn't have to deal with a foil collar. I also increased the extract by 1 Tbl as recommended. A major hit with my guests.

This is the best cheesecake ever- with some modifications. I halved the butter in the crust (the first time I made it there was so much, it was oozing out of the pan!) and used lower-fat cream cheese and grahams. I also used milk chocolate chips for the glaze- in my opinion, semisweet chocolate is overpowering. I get begged to make this every holiday!

I made this cheesecake a few years ago at an office party and it was very well received. I am preparing it again in a few days for another dinner party. Rich and dense yet light at the same time and the flavors blend together beautifully. Certainly is one of my favorites!!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I am a HUGE fan of coconut and chocolate together, and I adore Almond Joys, but this was really disappointing. I made this for Easter dessert and found it so heavy (and I ususally love dense, heavy cheesecakes) and cloying that it was practiaclly inedible beyond the first bite. Plus, somehow the flavor was quite bland, boring actually. I managed to pawn half of it off on my mother to take home to my brother (he'll eat anything)and threw the remaining pieces away. My husband said I should have given the last couple of pieces to the neighbors, (he didn't taste it). I wouldn't embarass myself.

This recipe won a company bake-off that the employees put together. I made it again for my boyfriend's birthday, and he said it was wihtout a doubt the best cheesecake he had ever eaten. I will make it again and again!

I made this cheesecake about 4 years ago and I'm still getting requests. It is so good and worth the effort I don't see how any cheesecake fan (and almond joy fan) wouldn't like this.Yummy!

I'm not a calorie counter, but I couldn't help feeling like this recipe was a complete waste of calories - there is so much coconut and almonds in this that it doesn't even taste like or resemble a cheesecake. Didn't taste like the candy bar to us, either. In fact, it didn't seem to have much flavor at all. A lot of work for something so mediocre. It came out fine, but didn't produce the "oohs and ahhs" you expect when serving a 1000-calorie piece of cake to guests.

Rich but unbelievably delicious. My boyfriend took is up to the restaurant where he works and gave it to co-workers and patrons and everyone LOVED it. Although it takes time, it is not difficult to prepare. The hardest part is waiting for it to chill!

I was looking for a knock out dessert for the Easter table and this was it. Excellant.

Rating: 3
Subtle flavor, I'm just not a big fan of the texture created by adding almonds to the filling (I prefer a smooth, velvety texture). I also sub'd white chocolate chips in the glaze and garnished the top with some toasted coconut and candy easter eggs to form a "nest" - perfect presentation for our easter brunch.

This cheesecake is awesome and very rich. A small slice goes a long way. I, too, used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and the combination of chocolate and coconut is always extraordinary. I will definitely make this again.

All cheesecakes are rich, but this one is especially rich. I wrapped the pan in aluminum foil and baked in a water bath. I do this for all cheesecakes -- tempers the heat and they practically never crack. I waited to glaze the cake until it was out of the pan, so the glaze ran down the sides. Then I pressed toasted coconut into the sides of the cheesecake.

Rich and delicious. This is frequently requested cake for birthdays and special occasions. When baking it make sure to securely seal the aluminum foil around the pan so the butter from the crust doesn't drip in your oven.

It does taste like almond joy but I did not care for the texture of the cheescake - guess I prefer a smooth texture. However my three guests all loved the recipe. I won't be making this again, but if you don't mind the texture the taste is very good.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake. The recipe was well written and I had no problems at all. I have permission to make this cake whenever I feel like it. I have made it 2 times now, and I'm getting pretty good at it. Every time I make it, it is a huge success.

This is a wonderful, but VERY filling, treat! I've made it twice in 4 days (one for the family and one for work). The first time I made it I didn't toast the coconut at all. I enjoy it better with the coconut toasted. I, too, used leftover toasted almonds as decoration on top of the chocolate glaze. Beautiful and wonderful.

Rating: 4
Oh, my! What a slice (or two, or three slices) of heaven! This cheesecake is by far one of the best that I or any of my guests had ever tasted! The only thing that I changed was that I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, as they were all I had in the pantry. The next time I make it, I will again use the chocolate graham crackers. This cheesecake it truly out of this world!

I have made this three times with wonderful results. I do not toast the cocoanut for the filling, but just for the crust. I don't try to put aluminum foil up the sides of the pan. I bake the excess in souffle cups (for 20 minutes or so) and give them to friends.

For me, this is a tried and true recipe. I've made it several times, and without fail. I've also shared the recipe with friends who also cherish it. My best compliment was at my Christmas party last year when I served it for dessert and a restaurant owner who attended begged for me to make him one, which I did. He had an event at his restaurant and he actually passed out slim slices (he was hording it for himself)to customers. The customers kept asking him to add it to his menu! This is a keeper!

Delicious and impressive recipe. Found 12 minutes to be too long to cook crust. 10 minutes or less is sufficient. Could also use the 1/3 fat reduced cream cheese or a combination of regular and fat free. (I used 3 8 oz. blocks of regular and 1 fat free 8 oz. block.) I also sprinkled some toasted coconut and almonds over top of glaze. Will definitely make again!

I guess my expectations were set too high. Made it for Christmas. The amount of chocolate is fine; I also added 2 Tbsps of coconut flavoring. I guess my biggest complaint is that it just wasn't sweet enough for my taste. If I ever do make again, I will add more sugar.

yum! i've made this cheesecake several times since the recipe was published, and it is ALWAYS a hit! i prefer to use coconut from the health food store (no chemicals) and use more. i agree with the others who recommend using more extract. This treat is definitely worth the calories! :)

I've made quite a few cheescakes from Bonappetit before. I am very partial to this one. It tastes just like the candy bar. I think it has just the right amount of everything. You can never have too much chocolate.

I have always loved the candy bar so I had to try the cheesecake. It was great! I also agree that there was too much chocolate and will lessen it when I make the recipe again. I will also take the advice to add more coconut extract. Other than that, all my coworkers loved it. It was a tremendous success.

This was the first cheesecake I ever attempted, and it was phenomenal. I'm a choco-holic, so I added a little more chocolate than the recipe called for. It was pretty easy to make, and everyone absolutely loved it (and I'm not a huge cheesecake fan)!

Excellent cheesecake! I agree that there was too much chocolate, so followed the advice to lessen the recipe. I added whole almonds on the top before covering it with the chocolate, to look more like the candy bar. This was a BIG HIT with my co-workers!

Absolutely wonderful!!! It tastes much like the chocolate bar and I loved it. However I found that the chocolate glaze was too thick for a 9 inch springform pan, so I would recommend reducing the chips and the whipping cream to 3/4 cup chips and 1/2 cup whipping cream. I also increaased the extract and it was a great suggestion! Enjoy!!
