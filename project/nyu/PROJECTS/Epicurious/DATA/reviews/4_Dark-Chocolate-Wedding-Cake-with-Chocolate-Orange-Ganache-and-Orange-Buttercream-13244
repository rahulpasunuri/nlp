This chocolate batter recipe is my go-to recipe for chocolate cakes. It's a wonderful dark chocolate which I'm sure can be changed by altering the type of chocolate used and has pleased everyone who has tried it so far. A really good, solid cake recipe.

Loved this cake! I did half the recipe and adapt the buttercream. I made the layers, ganache (halved) and curd (full) as directed. With the lemon rasp wedding cake here on epicurious and in the yellow gourmet cookbook, I thought the buttercream was too dense, so for this I made a swiss meringue buttercream with 4 whites, 1/2c sugar, and 2 sticks butter, and then added half the curd, and it turned out really nicely. Not overwhelmingly orangey, not too dense. The ganache is incredible! I'd like to make the ganache again just for truffles. It all worked together really well, and I'm looking forward to making it again!

I made this cake for my friend's wedding, and it was fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly. I made the buttercream a day early and stored it in the fridge. It took a good 20 minutes of beating it in my Kitchenaid mixer the next day to make it smooth and glossy again, so don't freak out when you take it out of the fridge and the consistency has changed.

To creativecakes from Indianapolis: did you use unsalted butter for your buttercream? That can make the difference between wonderful frosting and throw-it-in-the-garbage-and- start-over frosting. To KisaVal: do a google search for 1996 gourmet magazine (I found it at oldmags or backissues). It was the cover that month. You can either buy the magazine or increase your browser zoom to 200% and then click on the mag cover to get a closer look. To jnahsu: if you have butter chunks after refrigeration, it's likely the butter wasn't fully incorporated when you first made it (make sure your butter is fully softened before you start adding it to the egg-sugar mixture. I hope you tried whipping it again, sometimes you get lucky. :)

I am planning a September wedding and would love to have this as my wedding cake. Does anyone have any photos of the cake? Was there one in the original Gourmet magazine? I am thinking of curls of candied orange rinds and kumquats as decoration? Does anyone of any other ideas or comments on my idea? Also I am not a lover of buttercream. I notice some of those who posted reviews said they used raspberry jam. I would like to keep the orange flavor and was thinking of marmalade in place of the buttercream. What do you all think of that?

I made the ganache and buttercream, but used a box cake mix. The ganache was to die for, but no one in my family really liked the buttercream. It just tasted too greasy. I will keep the ganache recipe though, and definitely make that part again.

Time consuming, but very worth the effort. I don't enjoy dark chocolate, so I substituted 4oz of milk chocolate chips for the cake and 1/2c of milk chocolate chips for the ganache. It came out very, very yummy. The only issue I had with the buttercream was the salt...I triple checked my measurement, but the icing came out tasting salty. Very odd. Wondering if anyone else had this issue?? I think next time, I'll omit the salt. Planning on using this in my brother's wedding cake next week.

I made this cake for my sisters birthday. Loving orange and chocolate I followed the advise of others and added extra zest to spark the orange flavor. I found the cake itself a bit dry. The ganache and buttercream were fab....I left a good portion of the butter out as others advised.I will make the cake again but need to figure out how to get a more moist crumb.

best butter cream ever! the orange butter cream is heavenly. the ganache is delicious. i use my favorite chocolate cake recipe with this and it always turns out fabulous. definitely worth the effort. you can make the curd ahead so it is not so time consuming the next day. also, a digital thermometer is key when making sugar syrup. yummy!

I was nervous to split this recipe so I used the double chocolate layer cake recipe from this site but used this ganache and orange buttercream with the orange curd. All was incredible beyond words. I also brushed each layer with a syrup flavored with orange zest and Grand Marnier before filling with the chocolate orange ganache. It was by far the best cake I ever made! I'll definitely be making it for family at Easter.

Yummy yummy yummy!! I made this cake for Valentine's Day, using half the recipe. Wherever it called for 5 large eggs I just used 2 extra large eggs since it's a little difficult to get 2.5 eggs :-) The ganache was rich, and I used a different, more traditional buttercream recipe instead of the one listed. Still came out wonderful. The cake itself isn't as moist as I've ever made before, so I will probably stick with my original chocolate cake recipe next time. Rich but not too rich. I think I'll go eat another piece right now....

This recipe is very, very similar to one I have used over and over again, and it has always been consistently good and had rave reviews. So, I shall be interested to try this one because it seems a bit more special and has the great buttercream and ganache recipe too. I am going to use all this to make my daughter's wedding cake in May and she wants a chocolate Chambord cake. I believe this can be adjusted to be raspberry flavored rather than orange, as a couple of the reviewers have noted. What I really want to do is to compliment all the cooks out there who have written in with their thoughts, advice and step-by-step instructions on changes they have tried etc. I loved reading them ALL as I felt... still feel, a little apprehensive about making a cake for 100 guests, never having made a wedding cake before. Plus being the mother of the bride, who wants to have extra stuff to do a couple of days before the wedding, the angst of assembling it and transporting it to the venue an hour away has been difficult. However, I am going to practice many times beforehand and we'll all be eating mock wedding cakes for ages! Thank you all for your input, I feel much more confident now.

This cake was exceptional! I made it a day before I served it and that worked well (had leftovers several days later and cake was still moist) The cake was not difficult to make and had the perfect texture and flavor. I didn't have any Cointreau but the ganache was still alot of flavor. I have never made a buttercream like this before but I didn't have any issues with it. Although it did take a little more time to prepare than a tradtional butter and confectioners sugar frosting, I thought the flavor and texture were well worth it and plan on making it again. I also cut the recipe down to only make a 9 inch cake. I'm not sure how the other reviewers did this but I just cut everything down by 3/5 (since the original recipe uses 5 eggs). The double layer 9 inch cake still served 20 people and could have even served 25 because the pieces were almost too big as this is a rich cake. Everyone who had it loved it and I will be making this again!

Best cake ever! I have been making this recipe since it came out in the 1996 Gourmet Magazine. It always gets rave reviews. I just made it for a baby shower (two separate cakes, not stacked) at my new place of employment. Again, rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. It was nice to find the recipe online to forward. It does take time to make the cake. I usually space it out over two days, making the cake layers and curd the first day, and the ganche and frosting the next. This makes it much more managable. The cake freezes well so I never hesitate to volunteer to make the recipe for events; I deliver one cake and I keep the second in my freezer for myself. I just slice a frozen piece off and let it come to room temperature, perfection! Do not serve the cake cold, it is like eating a stick of butter and ruins what should be a truly gourmet experience. I have also cheated and used two dark chocolate box cake mixes. It results in a moister cake so it depends on your preference and time constraints. Either way, this cake with the orange ganache and buttercream is SOOOO worth the effort!

I have made this several times and it has always turned out well. The last time I made it I added dark chocolate to the buttercream icing, which really enhanced the taste!!!

Very good dark chocolate heavy moist cake. Not too sweet. The orange is a great compliment to the dark chocolate. I reduced the recipe to make 2 9inch layers. Would make again. The reduced recipe of orange buttercream frosting still made enough for another cake - so I froze the leftover buttercream frosting.

I have made this cake 3 or 4 times since the recipe first appeared. I thought the buttercream was amazing and did not experience anything strange with the curd. I actually have the magazine where this was on the cover and the buttercream was not spread on the cake smoothly. It was more whippy, done with a large frosting knife. That might explain why people were having problems piping it. My cakes came out of the pans with no problems. Just be careful not to overbake. Everyone who tastes this says it is the greatest chocolate they've ever had!

I only tried the buttercream recipe, and, like other reviewers, i thought it was WAY too buttery. the curd was a strange recipe as well, as i've made curd dozens of times. this recipe was opaque and very eggy instead of the beautiful translucent jelly-like look and texture it's supposed to have. just not a good buttercream recipe.

this was my first attempt at a cake from scratch - it turned out beautifully. Everyone loved it. The buttercream was not too heavy and was a perfect compliment to the cake and ganache. It was very time consuming - but the impression it made on my family was worth it.

This was hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever made. (To soniah_07 from Austin, you would use granulated sugar for the buttercream - that's the reason for cooking the simple syrup, to keep the buttercream from becoming grainy). Also, to the cook from Boston, I don't see where the recipe claimed to be dairy-free...regardless, I did a cake tasting this weekend - I'm baking the cake for my brother's wedding, and he and his fiancee chose this one, and a coconut cake I made, they'll have tiers of both with buttercream (I'll use this recipe, it is simply the best buttercream I've ever made, although it won't be orange with the coconut layers). For the cake I used Valrhona cocoa and Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate (70% cacao). The combination was heavenly. The cakes were nice and level - perfect for layering, and not too dry or moist. I simply can't say enough about this wonderful cake. Very labor intensive, but so worth it, especially for a wedding.

Rating: 0
This is in answer to the question about what type of sugar to use. (When the recipe doesn't specify the type, you can pretty much assume it's supposed to be granulated sugar.) And by looking at this recipe, I'm pretty certain it should be granulated because you're going to cook it until it dissolves, so there won't be a grainy texture.

This recipe is the BEST chocolate cake from scratch I have ever made. The ganache and buttercream were the first of each that I ever made and they were wonderful. It's a fondant buttercream where you make a simple syrup to add into the egg whites and then also a curd from the yolks. It's a bit of work but you can do the buttercream in advance and it is well worth it. I used trader joes chocolate and I had a mix of duck and chicken eggs. Duck egg whites take longer to whip up but they work, just take more time.

I only made the cake part of this recipe for a birthday party. I made it into 3 9- inch layers, which worked well, and layered it with chocolate ganache and topped with espresso buttercream (Toba Garett's recipe). I loved the chewy brownie texture of the cake, definitely not your average wedding cake. It did crumble a bit when removing it from the pans, therefore I opted not to use it for the wedding cake I made this weekend- stuck with my tried and true devil's food cake. I was afraid it would really fall apart if I made it in a larger size pan. I'll probably try this again.

Made this cake for a Grooms Cake. Panicked a little because it was so dense and heavy, so had to make three of each size, and filled with white chocolate ganache, and dark chocolate ganache, whipped. I used a 10", and 14" pan x 3 because each recipe made a 1.5" layer. I baked the layers at 325 for approximately 45, and 50 minutes or until a toothpick came out clean. The cake was then frosted with the dark chocolate buttercream Frosting recipe on here from The Well Decorated Cake, by Toba Garrett. This was for an outside wedding reception, and the icing held up very well in the 82 degree weather and the humidity. When many people came back for seconds, I knew the cake was a success. I have requests to make this cake again, and people fought over the left overs. I will definately make this cake again!

I made only the cake layers and the ganache, but heard plenty of comments like: "best cake ever!" If you're looking for a good chocolate layer cake, this is it. I made 1/3 of the cake recipe and cooked in an 11 inch spring form, then cut that into two layers. The cake doesn't really rise, so take that into consideration when choosing pan sizes. I can't wait to make it again!

I made the cake part of this recipe as the bottom tier of a 3-tier wedding cake, pouring the whole thing into a 12-inch pan and baking for about an hour, then checking every 5 minutes until it seemed right. It came out perfect! And so yummy! I usually don't like chocolate cake as I'm more of a brownie lover, but this cake was really good. I cut it into 3 layers, used raspberry jam and fresh raspberries as filling, and frosted between the layers and all over the rest with a white chocolate buttercream. I'm not a professional by any means but I feel confident after making this cake, and will make it again!

I wanted to make a large chocolate birthday cake to serve about 20 people. I used 2/3 of this recipe for the layers and frosted them with 1 1/2 recipes of the Swiss Meringue Buttercream from Joy of Cooking. The cake has a unique flavor and texture; moist (but not too moist) and very chocolaty. It was rich enough to serve smaller slices but many people went back for seconds. Very nice!

I made this cake some months ago and was a bit disappionted. Cake was made into 6,9 and 12 inch tiers for a shared anniversary party of 2 friends & their husbands and it was BEAUTIFUL, yet the taste was not so great. Decorated with piped buttercream and flowers. Ganache was great, cake was good & moist, buttercream was ok before addition of orange curd. I won't likely make all components of this recipe together again. I usually like the combo of orange and chocolate, but not in this recipe. Everyone ooh'd & ahh'd over the appearance of the cake, but there was so much cake left over. Haven't made this cake since!

I hate to be the naysayer, but I spent so much time on this, that I feel I have to post my remarks. I did like this cake. It was very good. But it wasn't perfect, and a wedding cake should be, as should anything that I spend 8-10 hours on over 3-4 days. The layers may just not have been to my preference - I prefer a larger crumb and sweeter, but they were excellent to work with. I did think it was a bit dry, but that might just be my opinion. I thought the ganache filling was a bit bitter - would also have liked it sweeter, and although the stiffness of it made cake slices come out perfectly, I thought it should be moussier in texture. The buttercream (I too reduced by 1 cup of butter) firmed up fabulously when chilled so from that standpoint was excellent to work with, but I thought it would be smoother and glossier when completed, and it wasn't. It was hard to get a nice finish on the final cake, which was okay, because I covered it all with flowers anyway, but I was disappointed. When I tried to pipe with it, it was impossible - just not at all smooth enough and when it warmed it just melted through the bag instead of piping out. It was well received, and others enjoyed it. It's definitely good, but I will keep looking for my favorite.

I only gave this three forks because I only made the cake layers! I have no idea how the rest of this comes out. I layered mine with raspberry jam (polaner all fruit seedless), gave it a crumb coat of almond flavored buttercream and then covered in Fondant. It was very yummy that way.

Ok ok, delicious, but so much work! I've achieved similar quality with recipes requiring less labor. Be careful to NOT overbake it because I did with one pan, and it fell apart in 5+ pieces when I tried to remove it. I used only white granulated sugar and it was still delicious.

Rating: 2
This is a wonderfully elaborate production. The cake layers are delicious and relatively easy, as is the ganache. I would make one or the other of those components again. I found the buttercream to be interesting, but not delicious enough to justify the labor-intensive process. Frankly, I would prefer a simple buttercream of butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk (or orange juice). I liked the cake, but I didn't love it, and it wasn't a hit with guests.

I made this cake this past weekend for my 50th birthday party. It was incredibly good. I will make the chocolate cake my standard chocolate cake now and use with many other buttercreams and fillings. It's such a good base recipe if you love rich dark and not too sweet chocolate cake. The cake allows the buttercream to shine as the star, whatever kind of buttercream you use. The cake is very mosit and dense without being heavy. I made the recipe exactly as written and was glad I did. The orange flavor was perfect, just a hint of flavor, but definitely there. The orange ganache was incredible. I will be making this recipe again and again.

I made this for my sister-in-law's wedding and it was fantastic!! My only advice is to make sure you have enough time. I did it over the course of a week, and it was time consuming, but WORTH IT! The cake was moist and rich--similar to a mud cake, and it stayed together and cut well..wonderful!

I made this cake for my brother's wedding with a few variations because he hates orange-flavoured stuff. So I used a regular chocolate ganache with raspberry jam.

Everyone loved this cake, it was perfect.

I made this for a friend's birthday party in July. It took several days, but the only problems I had involved the frosting. I tasted as I added the butter and could tell it was getting way too buttery-tasting, so I didn't add the full amount. I had a really hard time putting the frosting on the cake - in part due to my 90 degree kitchen and possibly because I added a little Cointreau to the frosting for flavor. Fortunately, it tasted so good that it was worth all the work.

I made only the cake portion of this recipe and filled it with chocolate mousse, ganache, and raspberry jam. The cake was delicious but 2 out of 3 layers (I made 3 9-inch rounds) broke. One broke completely in half, the other cracked. I checked the cake several times but it must have been overcooked. It did not taste dry, so I'm not sure what happened. I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter with the broken cake and managed to cut 5 hearts out of it. I cut them each in half and filled them as I did the large cakes and they looked adorable and tasted great. I would make the individual cakes again because they were easier to work with.

Also, the cake seems as if it would be dry when it comes out of the oven but it is as moist as can be when you take a bite! Everything is a perfect balance! A+++ GREAT RECIPE! Oh by the way, I decorated the top tier with chocolate shavings and candied orange slices in the center it was a simple yet elegant finish.

Fantastic! Wonderful! Amazing! I have made this cake 3 times since the recipe first appeared. It is the best chocolate cake EVER! I love chocolate and orange together so I didn't find the orange flavor too overpowering. The frosting takes some time to make but it's well worth it. Start the whole cake process at least a day before you need it so you don't run out of time. A really beautiful cake and so yummy! Try the recipe as written before making any substitutions. You won't be sorry!!

I found the cake itself to be very rich, very decadent and one of the best chocolate cake ever. The texture is dense and satisfying. I found that the orange ganache was too intense with the orange buttercream so, I eliminated the orange flavorings in the ganache and had it soley chocolate. The buttercream is light and fluffy. Once I didnt use buttercream at all and frosted the whole cake only with ganache - also delicious!

This cake was AMAZING! I didn't make the buttercream or the ganache since I was not sure how that would turn out, but I used a chocolate raspberry frosting from Epicurious and filled the middle of the cake with raspberries. A great 30th birthday cake for me... and lots of left overs.

This recipe was a feather in my baking cap..I was truly pleased with the results the party guests enjoyed it thoroughly. I cut the recipe in half and it took 4 hours from start to finish and served it that night. The hardest part was making the buttercream topping--but well worth the effort. Beautiful cake texture and perfectly matching ganache and buttercream. I omitted all orange and used a chocolate buttercream recipe from epicurious and put a tablespoon of chambord in the ganache (I may have needed more chambord because the flavor was very faint). I highly recommend this cake for people that can appreciate a chocolate cake this sophisicated. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This was the first wedding cake I made it was a great success. The cake layers are very easy to work with and are not prone to tearing or cracking especially if you refrigerate them before doing any of the frosting. The denseness of the cake also helps to extend the number of servings. The bride and groom did not like the chocolate/orange combination so I substituted a Kahlua flavored ganache and a mocha buttercream for the ones in the recipe. It's a delicious cake even for people who don't usually like chocolate cake.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent cake, but I found the orange frosting to be a bit eggy from the curd, and not strong enough to compete with the deep chocolate cake. I made orange-mocha frosting the second time around, by adding to it some of the chocolate ganache and some instant espresso crystals (melted in a very small quantity of water). This went over gangbusters. It still contained a strong citrus component.

Rating: 3
The cake in this recipe is to die for! Really scrumptious and not so much work. But the icing is WAY too buttery. If you use all the butter, the butter taste completely overpowers the orange curd. I left out half a cup of butter, but next time I will probably leave out a cup and a half.

I only used the cake from this recipe, so please know my comments are only in regards to it. The cake was LUSCIOUS! It is moist and has a rich depthful chocolate flavor. Do not attempt it without a stand mixer, mine (a 4.5 quart) was close to FULL with the batter. Making just the cake took close to an hours worth of prep & mixing time! I baked three 9 inch rounds. Parchment paper worked beautifully as the only pan prep. Let the cakes cool for a while in the pans (15 - 20 minutes) - I lost a layer by trying to take it out to early, ugg! The cake behaved beautifully otherwise. The cake is a real winner!

Although this recipe was very time-consuming, it was not overall that difficult, and the final product was well worth the effort. I did not make the cake for a wedding, so I chose to make 3 9" layers instead of the recommended 4 layers. It worked out perfectly.

Wonderful! Just a few changes: I made this for my wedding, so I doubled the recipe for the cake and ganache and I made 3 3-layer cakes, 10.5 inches, 8.5 inches, and 7 inches. I doubled the cake mix in 2 seperate rounds and doubled the ganache all at once. I found it a bit dry the first time, so I added 1/2 cup of unsweetend apple sauce per cake mix (I added it to the chocolate after the sour cream). Wonderful! Also, I found the ganache just a bit too bitter, so I used a total of 12 oz of bittersweet and 4 oz of semi-sweet chocolate the 2nd time (remeber, the reicpe was doubled), and I really liked the result. Aslo, chop the zest to make it extra fine so that it doesn't do funny things to the texture! The frosting DOES NOT need to be doubled. Also, the orange curd ends up making the frosting a bit too overpowering. I recommend adding the curd a bit at a time and tasting as you go. Throw away the excess curd when you reach desired taste. Also, DON'T add the zest to the frosting. It makes the texture weird and it looks funny. Add it with the orange juice to the curd, ten strain it out. It goes great under fondant!

Oh my Gosh--THIS is the chocolate cake we dreamed about!! I made this cake for a bridal shower last weekend and everyone's in love. I used an 8" and 10" 3-inch cake pan instead of the 2-inch pans. It took just over an hour to bake, and the cakes came out of the pan perfectly. I split the layers and spread raspberry jam before the ganache. I used the buttercream without the orange curd--didn't match the bride's colors.

This was a wonder chocolate cake recipe. I did not make the orange buttercream icing, but instead used chocolate whipped cream icing (similiar to ganache). It was great. The cake is not too sweet, and is very moist. The combination of the chocolate and the cocoa makes this cake very flavorful. I recommend it highly!!

My daughter wanted a tradational Italian Wedding Cake and she wanted Chocolate. I made this recipe for her wedding but made it larger. Being a Master Chef there were several Chefs from the New Orleans area there including 2 pastry chefs. All wanted the recipe. I still get requests for it and I plan to make it for my son's wedding next year. It is a bit difficult for a beginner but it is a fantastic recipe.

Because I am not a big orange fan, I altered this recipe by covering the cake with buttercream frosting and then fondant. I also used raspberry filling between the layers. The cake was wonderful. It was still moist a full week after I made it.

I really enjoyed making this cake. It was a cinch! The cake batter was beautiful, it baked very flat and was easy to handle once out of the pan. The cake was moist and tender, and held together beautifully when sliced. I didn't make the buttercream, just made a little extra ganache and frosted the cake with the extra ganache. It was a hit at my birthday party, I keep getting compliments a week later. LOVE this cake!!

I made this cake for my friend's 21st birhday party in December, and it was a big hit. I am still getting compliments. It was my first attempt at such a large project, but i found that the recipe was easy to follow. I decorated the cake with thinly sliced oranges and buttercream piping and it looked beautiful. I think you really need a heavy duty mixer to make this cake, though. I only had a hand mixer and it was difficult to handle the quantity of batter and frosting at times. The buttercream was a little hard to work with, but other than that, everything was great. I can't wait for another special ocasion so I can try making it again.

I made this cake for our best friends' wedding. The cake and the ganache were divine, but I thought the buttercream was too difficult to work with, not very attractive (had to mask it with flowers), and overpowered the taste of the cake itself. Next time I'll use a lighter frosting that is easier to work with. In spite of that, the wedding guests all loved it.

Though this cake was deliciously dark and complex, it wasn't outstanding for the amount of effort it took. I made the layers and the orange curd on one day, did the buttercream and assembly the next, and served it the day after that -- whew! One note is that the buttercream comes out looking a little funky because of the orange zest. This doesn't affect the flavor, but for presentation this cake definitely needed some dressing-up. As I couldn't find fraises du bois I used colorful edible flowers.

I made this for my parent's 50th wedding anniversary and it won rave reviews from all! I made in stages: the cake layers froze & defrosted beautifully, the buttercream kept well in fridge for several days. As this was my 1st attempt at "pro" baking I gave myself lots of time. Fantastic!

I made this cake for a birthday and am still floating from all the praise! Everyone raved about this cake. One person told me it was the best cake she'd had in ten years.

I made this cake with my daughter for her baby's Christening party. We made the cakes and orange curd on one day, the ganache and buttercream , plus partial assembly, on the second day, and finished it up the evening before the party. (We catered the rest!) It was beautiful with its fresh flowers and, unlike most white wedding cakes, absolutely ambrosial! Be sure to obtain the cardboard rounds and 6 " cake pan in advance. This is a real winner for a very special occasion.

I made this cake three times: first as a test to see if we liked it, then I made it a second time, froze it and Fed Ex'ed it to Key West for my brother's wedding. I don't think the buttercream was so great when it was defrosted but it was still a hit. Finally we made it again to celebrate at a NY party. That was the best, I had alot of time, was not nervous and had the proper equipment (you nedd a heavy duty mixer). This is a great cake.
