Where are the olives? Wouldn't slice the carrot thinly and add later; otherwise, they turn to mush. I agree with other reviewers: wrong wine, not enough garlic.

Burgundy for cooking Provencal Daube?!?!

Recipe was so-so. I used the suggestion of one of the earlier reviewers and increased the garlic- I think it really helped. It smelled fantastic, but I found the taste to be lacking. But it did give me an excuse to get a great Dutch oven!

This is the same recipe as the "Estouffade de Noel", only a smaller quantity. A delicious and wonderful classic dish albeit not quite an authentic "boeuf en daube" that is perfect for do-ahead dinner parties. I added mixed sauteed mushrooms consisting of fresh crimini, shiitake, portabella and oyster mushrooms. I agree on the extra garlic - I must have added 4 times the amount or more...

Being from The Provence region in France i know a little about "La Daube". This recipe is fair but lacks some very important ingredients found in the Real Daube Provencal. Like Orange peal, morells, black olives and a 1/4 cup of vinegar. Cognac has never been an ingredient of this dish... But... Last note: 1 clove of garlic is not enough... Count 3 0r 4 at least.
