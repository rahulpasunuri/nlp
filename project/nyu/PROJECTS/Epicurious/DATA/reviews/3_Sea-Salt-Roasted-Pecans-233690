Delicious and so easy to make...you could probably cut out a little bit of the butter, though.

Delicious! Big hit with the book club group. Our book assignment was The Sea by John Banville. Assignment was to bring a dish related to the book. Very buttery and addictive.

These nuts just dripped butter. I used 4 cups of nuts and they STILL were dripping with butter. I love butter but this was too much, even for me. I do think they would be good with the butter content cut way back.

Since I grew up with pecan trees in my yard in Mississippi, I fondly remember my mom preparing a similarly simple snack. To add a smokier taste, like she did, cut down on the salt and add worchestershire sauce to the melted butter. Yum! Impossible to stop eating them!
