I am a Maryland native and I love the fact that this recipe does not use Old Bay. I love Old Bay and this is a great optional crab cake recipe. I have made it several times. I do change a few things, I use panko instead of fresh bread crumbs if I dont have time or the bread and I also add one chipolte pepper with adobe sauce in the sauce and it gives it just enough spice! AEWSOME!

These crab cakes were very good. Unlike some of the other reviewers, my husband and I did not find that they were greasy. The crab cakes were really good. The sauce, needed something more since it seemed to lack something. Next time, I will make the crab cakes and not the sauce. Will probably try a chipotle / red pepper sauce to give it an extra kick.

I just made this recipe yesterday to bring to a wine pairing party. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious!!! Everyone was assigned a wine and had to bring an appetizer to pair with it. I won the contest hands down. The only change I made was to increase the mayonnaise a little bit. Again, yummy!

I have made these several times and the potato chips really give it a good change from the normal crab cake. Here in Maryland you get a ton of Old Bay seasoning. I do spice them up by adding one chipolte pepper the to sauce. It is just enough bite to be good!

I'm only rating the chardonnay cream sauce which is why I am giving three stars (to not distort the review rating). I used it with the recipe "Super Rich Virginia Crab Cakes". Excellent sauce(four stars) and easy to prepare. Takes longer to reduce than recipe calls.

I made this about a month ago and they were the best crabcakes I've ever had! This is from someone who grew up in New England, has been to Maryland and has had quite a few to sample over the years!!

the sauce is really the keeper. Very simple but excellant flavors. Use a decent (not neccesarily expensive ) wine. The saying is if you won't drink it don't cook with it...I don't drink vinegar but I cook with it. For a dish lighter on the pocket, try salmon instead of crab.

We make this recipe all the time- we are from the beach and very picky about our crab cakes. Fresh crab and kettle chips with an oaky Chardonnay make a huge difference. I can't even order crab cakes in a restaurant anymore since I can make better ones at home using this recipe. Bravo! PS I broil mine instead of frying!

I'm originally from Maryland. So I know good crab cakes. Had it so much in my youth, that even though I live out in Asia, I get my family to send my pasteurized lump MD crabmeat. The sauce was a bit light (depends on wine?) so I mixed the cream with a bit of marinara and threw in a crushed garlic while reducing. Instead of potato chips (too much fat count here) I lightly coated the cakes w/dried breadcrumbs. When serving dust lightly w/Old Bay seasoning.

I've made this dish several times, and each time can't wait to make it again. The secret to the sauce is not rushing it. It seems like it boils and boils and boils, and nothing happens. Then, all of a sudden, you have this thick, delicious sauce that compliments the crab cakes wonderfully. Also, chilling the cakes before cooking really does help in holding them together.

I did not think the flavor was very good and you could taste the potato chip flavor. I think there are better recipes out there.

Try this twist on the cream sauce--I've been making this for years, and people lick their plates to get it all. Boil one cup of orange juice until it is reduced to one quarter cup. Then boil 2 minced shallots, the reduced orange juice and one quarter of a cup of dry white wine until this mixture is reduced to one quarter cup. You can do this ahead of time and reheat. To this reduced sauce, whisk in one half stick of unsalted butter. Remove from heat and whisk in one quarter cup of heavy cream. Serve with the crab cakes, Yes, I know it's sinfully rich and fattening, but people just adore it, so it's worth it every now and then. Besides, you really only use a little bit!

The first time I made the crab cakes, I did have some difficulty with them staying together, second time was a breeze. A huge hit with everyone! The chardonnay sauce compliments nicely.

Hint. Whatever crabcake recipe, chill for awhile after you make them, it helps them hold together.

I would make the chardonnay sauce again for a different crab cake recipe. We're not a fan of the crab cakes though. It's much easier to just purchase them pre-made a the fish market.

Had trouble getting the crab cakes to stay together. The chips made it crunchy but boosted the fat count way up and I think I'd rather have a lighter coating, such as japanese bread crumbs. Sauce tasted wonderful but needed to be thicker. Will stick with some of my other tried and true recipes.

This was very interesting. I was worried that it would come out too salty and/or greasy, but it was fine. I guess it depends on the brand of potato chips you use. I did have a horrible time trying to get the crab cakes to hold together. Finally, I just gave up on forming patties, but wasn't about to waste that much crab meat. I added some more mayo and baked them in little gratin dishes. Everyone loved them, and no one knew they were supposed to be crab cakes!

potato chips are a great idea but salty. try french's fried onions crumbled well. 30 seconds before sauce ends, add 1tsp. tarter sauce and stir like crazy.

I must say my husband and I did not like the potato chip coating at all. They made the coating too hard and greasy. If you like a coating on your crab cakes I suggest a light dusting of cornmeal...much lighter and tasty! There is a GREAT crabcake recipe that calls for cornmeal on this web site. It's MUCH better than this one!

Great recipe, the crab cakes were not that good, come to think of it we even use the recipe for the other times we've made it. and the cream sauce was great, we even thickened it with corn starch, just a smidge to make it creamier. I just hate a watery/wimpy cream sauce. also you can use green onions chopped very finely instead of shallots. this sauce is great over baked whitefish also. Just Experiment.

We made these crabcakes for Valentine's Day. Although different from other crabcakes they were very good. The sauce is amazing especially when accompanying the cakes. Potato chips seemed like a very odd ingrediant for crabcakes, but they were the secret to the whole recipe. I will definately make them again!

I made this dish for my boyfriend last night.. since it was just the two of us, I divided the recipe in half and it was plenty for both of us. this is the first time I have made crab cakes and will definitly make them again.

Made these wonderful crab cakes for a dinner party of 8. No one really wanted dinner after them. Have made them several times to rave reviews. Really good Oregon Chardonnay and Kettle potato chips are my secret

Fantastic recipe. Make patties thick, but gently formed. The potato chips are a MUST!! The chardonnay sauce is to die for!!!

Considering the fact that I was forced to use canned crab, I was surprised by the wonderful taste of these cakes. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and I'm happy to say my guests loved the combination. These reheat well in the microwave, so they can be made in advance.

Yummy, though I would like to know the trick for cooking the crab cakes just right on both sides and still have the center thoroughly cooked. (The oven I guess!) My family thought the sauce was the best part. I'd probably double the sauce recipe next time - didn't have enough for all the crab cakes it made, and the sauce was very tasty.

The crabcakes by themselves were wonderful! They were colorful and made a good presentation. I did add just a touch of Old Bay. Hey . . . I'm from Maryland. I think they stand alone without the sauce.

The most terrific flavor and the sauce was fantastic. The sauce thickens as it cools, so make plenty and don't try to thicken it yourself. The crab cakes were soooo good. I make very loosely packed cakes and handled them very gently. My husband loved them!

The potato chips really give the crab cakes a nice crunch. I have told many friends about this recipe.

Loved the sauce, after substituting 1/2 c. of the whipping cream with fat free sour cream (after reduction). Found it very flavorful and would use it for other things. Cakes do soak up too much oil, but I tried just browing them on both sides in a little oil, then sticking them in the oven to heat rest of the way and they were good. Used jumbo lump crabmeat, the best, so that may have contributed to its success.

Why add "Breading" to the cakes? It's not necessary.

Rating: 2
To kick up the flavor a notch or two, try substituting the dill with a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning. Aloso eliminate the course grain mustard and use only the dijon. Potato chips will add salt as well as a greasy taste to the cakes. You can get the crunch without the salt and greasy taste by substituting corn flake crumbs for the chips.

enjoyed this recipe but felt the chardonnay sauce needed a little help and I added Dijon Mustard to enliven it.....

is a very different crab cake with not a lot of breading. Company was impressed, however, some of the cakes did not stay together well.

I thought these crab cakes were awful. The sauce was tasteless and the cakes were just plain bad. I'd love to try them in the restaurant in Maryland - maybe that's the difference.

It was very good, and my boyfriend liked it a lot too, but I found it a little too greasy. It soaks up a lot of oil when you are frying it.

These were excellent. The sauce was a little too light. I used a small portion of the red pepper, and felt they were just fine without. Although odd, the potato chips really do make this.

Even though I liked the sauce, I preferred the crab cakes by themselves.
