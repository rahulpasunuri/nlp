I've made this half a dozen times for Xmas or Thanksgiving as a palate cleanser. I cook the base for the sorbet the day before I want to chill it; let all the solids in and let it steep overnight, strain and then freeze. It does bring more of the thyme taste forward. I started using lemon thyme when I can find it. Everyone wants more.

Delicious, subtle sorbet - not too sweet and perfect between courses!

I admit it, I wasn't adventurous enough to include the fresh thyme. Without it, it was very nice and very enthusiastically received. Even yummier: skip the thyme and add the juice of 2 limes, 2 Tablespoons of vodka and 2 Tablespoons of Triple Sec. Just enough alcohol to keep it from freezing solid resulting in an absolutely lovely texture. Mmmm, Cosmopolitan sorbet.

mmmm....delicious! This was #10 of 13 courses and was perfect between the fish and meat courses. It was a pefect balance of sweet, tart and savory. The consistency was lovely, and could be used for either palate cleanser or dessert. I will definitely be making this as a simple dessert for a less formal dinner.Perfectly refreshing.

Excellent palate cleanser in a multi-course meal. I found the thyme to add almost an exotic flavor to the sorbet. Highly recommended.

More of a palate cleanser than a dessert, this sorbet comes out very strong (and hot pink!). But the tannins leave something of an aftertaste if you try to drink water afterward. I'd reduce the thyme to about half, since every time I tasted the sorbet, the first words out of my mouth were, "Very thyme-y".

I made this sorbet for Thanksgiving. It is fabulous! The taste is clean, bright and very refreshing. Definitely the thing to wake up the palate in a big meal.
