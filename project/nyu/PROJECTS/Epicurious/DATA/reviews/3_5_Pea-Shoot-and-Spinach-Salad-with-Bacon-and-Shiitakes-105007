Best use of thinning my garden ever. I skipped the salt, oil, & mustard -- and added leeks with the mushrooms. It's a beautiful compliment, though, to the delicate flavors of the pea shoots.

Tried this only because I had beautiful Trader Joe's organic pea shoots. Delicious salad. Used King Trumpets, sauteed for 90 sec. For some reason my dressing tasted bitter, so chucked that and substituted Epi's 1998 Lemon Vinaigrette, always a crowd pleaser.

This was very good. Unfortunately the radishes in the store looked really bad so I had to leave those out but the pea shoots were so pretty in the salad. I served mine with a seared salmon steak. Fabulous light dinner.

This was wonderful. I did change a few easy things, though: I omitted the mushrooms entirely, and used a mesclun-baby spinach mix as the salad base. After frying the bacon and removing it from the pan, I deglazed the pan with the salad dressing mixture, scraping up the brown bits, and then used that as a warm vinaigrette over the salad. It was yummy. Also, if you're looking for a heartier dish, try tossing some freshly cooked hot spaghetti into the warm dressed greens.

Definitely cut back on the salt--I only used the 1/2 tsp. in the dressing (none on the mushrooms) and this was plenty. Otherwise, absolutely delicious!!

This is a great salad, though I would advise skipping the salt in the mushrooms (I found it a bit too salty that way). It makes a fantastic lunch salad with the addition of a poached or soft-boiled egg on top.

Exellent!! This recipe is one of the greatest! I will keep this in my recipe box and use it several times this spring.
