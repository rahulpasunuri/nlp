Amazing. I've served this at small dinner parties and served it for a larger crowd on New Year's Eve Use the shrimp AND the bay scallops, don't skip a thing. We actually add just a little more capers since we like those so much. You can use a little less oil, but we just throw in more shrimp and scallops. We let it marinade in the dressing for 3-4 hours and serve it just over room temp. We've always used the small-ish tomatoes on the vine from Trader Joes - imported from Holland. It's been a huge hit with everyone.

Excellent salad and easy to make. I followed the recipe with only these exceptions - substituted a yellow onion for the red (I think they're milder) and, since the recipe didn't specify type, I used 6 nice plum tomatoes. Love their flavor and meatiness...

Excellent and attractive first course salad. Used sea scallops cut up

This was great--even with several substitutions. I only had balsamic vinegar, which worked well. I accidentally added green peppercorns instead of capers. The first taste of the dressing was fiery, but after I removed them it was good to go. We also did not have an avocado. Our friends loved it. I will make it again--this time with the capers! I used about half the garlic and onions and I did not regret that.

Too much oil in the dressing and too much garlic (amazingly!) for me. Other than that, a nice salad with decent balance. We used only scallops.

This dish was delicious. I served it as an appetizer at a dinner party and got rave reviews. I may try cutting back on the onions next time, otherwise it was pefect as is!

This was perfectly delicious and I wouldn't change a thing - I usually find there isn't enough garlic but I kept to the recipe on this one. I like how you can make the seafood mixture ahead of time and then assemble when ready. Delicious!

I have to disagree. I think this recipe was only mediocre. The dressing was good on the greens, but I think it was much too blah for seafood. Even after doctoring it up, it just did nothing for the seafood. I wouldn't make it again.

Didn't have shrimp, so I mixed a can of rinsed cannellini beans with the scallops and vinaigrette -- spectacular! Though this recipe is 8 years old, it certainly doesn't taste "dated."

Good. Doesn't need the oil in the dressing.

I love this salad! I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar --still came out wonderful! I'm not a big scallop fan so next time I'll just use shrimp with the salad. But the dressing was out of this world!

Made this recipe twice now and had rave reviews from guests. Just used the seared scallops and not the shrimp. Love those capers and the zing of red peppers!

This dish is consistently a hit. I have left it marinate up to 8 hours and the flavors are still fresh and distinctive. Presentation suggestion -- cover a large platter with the greens and put the shrimp/scallop mixture down the middle and alternate tomato and avocado wedges around the outside.

I liked this salad. I do think that a whole 1/2 cup of oil is a bit too much. But it was really good.
