Made this last night for dinner. I started to make it then realized I didn't have sun dried tomatoes. I was a bit worried that substituting tinned tomatoes might ruin the taste. OMG this was deeeelicious! The olives and goat cheese go beautifully together. The cheese made this thick, creamy sauce. So creamy in fact, I had to keep adding more chicken stock. The combination of flavours makes this an absolute winner. It's the kind of dish you could serve to guests - as long as they like goat cheese. I'll be making this again soon.

I made a variation of this recipe with feta instead of goat cheese and a chicken breast thinly sliced and cooked with the onion and garlic. I made the sauce with the cheese, a touch of pasta water, and homemade chicken broth mixed with an immersion blender. I skipped on olives and instead used on small zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach. This pasta well very well received and was served with a simple arugula and romaine salad.

Very good and easy meal that can be made from staple items that one often has on hand. I added white wine to the onion/tomato mixture before adding the broth. I also added sauteed chicken breast which made it a more substantial meal.

We LOVED this recipe. I subbed fresh basil and used dried parsley. To save time I just put the goat cheese in the pan after I added the pasta to the rest of the ingredients. I also marinated chicken in balsamic vinegar and cut it in this strips. I cooked with the onion and garlic then added the rest of the ingredients. My boyfriend said it was one of his favorite pasta dishes ever...and he's Italian.

Two servings!? Maybe if you are both Sumo wrestlers! We had dinner out of this then had the leftovers for next day lunch! Tasted even better the next day. I substituted basil for the parsley and it was wonderful. Really nice use of goat cheese. Next time I will reduce the amount of pasta and add some grilled chicken. DELICIOUS!

The best prep time/result ratio I've ever seen on a pasta that's beyond spaghetti and marinara sauce! An easy way to combine great ingredients often found in much more complicated dishes. Makes a great presentation, and the foolproof sauce is one of the cleverest I have ever seen. I doubled my olives (a house favorite) but cut corners on the salt where I could, adding no extra and using low sodium chicken broth. Perfect result. Another great thing about this recipe is that it lends itself to endless ingredient variations which do not change the prep much... definitely a winner and very popular with the guests!

I made a few small changes. Cut the oil back to about a tablespoon, used about 1/2 cup of onions and 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, a pinch of dried oregano, an extra clove of garlic, a 1/4 cup of sherry and a cup of left over chicken, chopped. One tip for the oil overload is to squeeze the sun dried tomatoes between multiple paper towels to remove some oil. Oh, I also used 1/3 lb mini-penne (what I had on hand) and used my own homemade salt-free broth which I keep in the freezer in varying portions. By the time the pasta was done the chicken, veggie mix was coated with all the sauce, with none sitting in the pan, so I was worried there would not be enough sauce when the pasta was added. I made the goat cheese sauce as directed and added it with the pasta and it was all sauced perfectly. I was really surprised how creamy and smooth it turned out. It was just as good as alfredo, but the goat cheese has alot less calories than all that cream and butter. Fabulous meal that will be made again.

This was am "O.M.G." recipe. Very good. I did, however make a few "enhancements." I don't like olives, so I omitted them. I used extra garlic, added sliced mushrooms when I was sauteeing the onions, garlic & tomatoes w/ chicken broth (also added a little white wine with this mixture). I used basil in place of parsley (suggested by another reviewer). I used whole wheat penne pasta. Added bite-sized steamed asparagus when I mixed everything together. Sauteed a chicken breast seasoned w/ salt & fresh ground pepper in white wine. When that was finished, I used the leftover liquid from the chicken breast, added a tad of chicken broth to bring it up to 1/3 cup, and used that instead of water to mix with the goat cheese. I sliced up the (very large) chicken breast & added it at the end to the entire mixture. Be very careful mixing the chicken in, as it will fall apart if you mix too vigorously. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I LOVE this pasta. My family has been making it for years and I didn't even know that it was from Bon Apetit. It is my favorite pasta and I have eaten pasta almost every day except weekends since I can remember. It is the BEST. Anyone who didn't like it should definitely try again with better ingredients or something....

This is a very good and easy to make recipe. I followed the advice of some of the other recipe raters and used a cup of chicken broth in the recipe. I also skipped the step with the hot water. Basil also is a good touch instead of using parsley, and I used about double what was called for in the recipe. To finish the recipe, I just dumped the noodles into the broth mixture, then added the cheese. I'll definitely make this one again.

This was really yummy and I made it in under 30 minutes. I added the goat cheese to heated broth instead of pasta water - otherwise follwed it as written.

This was such a simple, delicious dish. I didn't combine the goat cheese with the pasta water. Instead I used less cheese and just added it to the other indredients. The dish came out so creamy and delicious. I served it with a simple green salad and it was a real winner.

This was good, for some reason my goat cheese didn't "melt" like it was supposed to, but it was still tasty. I think I might add some white wine next time.

I made this as a side dish for a Father's Day barbecue. It was wonderful. I eliminated the olives (not enough time to pit them) and used a three cheese Italian blend (parmesean, asiago, romano) in place of the goat cheese. It received rave reviews from both sets of parents. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good! I made it almost as a baked pasta, as I put the mixture in a baking dish, sprinkled some left-over part-skim mozarella on top and put it under the broiler for about 3-4 minutes. I also sprinkled a bit of parmisan on the finished product instead of extra goat. Nice and flavorful!

I agree with the others, easy to make and really tasty. I never use oil packed sun drieds (too much fat for me) but I find in these recipes there's generally enough fat between cooking oil and cheese (I usually add extra cheese--I know, I know! it's fat ;) to make a lovely rich tasting thing. I have added grilled sliced chicken breast on occasion, that was nice. Also nice as is. I use kalamata olives (and more olives and tomatoes than called for), but black brine cured olives, if dry, would be nasty here. Watch out for that! I was very pleased at how the goat cheese melted to make a creamy sauce. I was very skeptical about that...but it was delicious.

This was a great dinner. It was easy to make, and had such a different flavor. Really delicious. It felt like a gourmet dinner. Anyway, I am making it again tonight, and won't change a thing. I did use low salt chicken broth the last time, and that was good.

We made this dish with extra sun dried tomatoes, our guests raved over this. A soft goat cheese melts and coats the pasta throughout, instead of globs of occasional flavor. It is a mouth watering dish, good for a pot-luck or vegetarian main course.

This was a fantastic recipe! It was one of the best meals I've ever made! Next time I'll add more olives and more sundried tomatoes for added flavor. YUM!

This was delicious! I did modify it though... I added extra garlic, extra olives, and an entire can of chicken broth. Because I didn't have goat cheese in the house, I used feta cheese. I realized I had boneless chicken breasts that had to be cooked tonight as well so I sauteed the breasts, thinly sliced them, and added them to the mixture. It was excellent!

I made this last night. I didn't have any onion so I substituted onion powder. The garlic taste was overpowering (since I had no onion, and I browned it a bit too long). I also was expecting more of a goat cheese flavor. I used about 3.5 oz, maybe next time I'll increase the amount of goat cheese. All in all, an OK dish.

My 15-year old daughter decided to make dinner last night, and picked this recipe because she likes goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. Normally I'm not a big fan of either ingredient, but this pasta dish is sensational. Adding the pasta water to the cheese makes it creamy, a perfect backdrop for the salty and assertive tomatoes and olives. It is quite rich, though, so try to resist the temptation to wolf down the whole thing! Easy and delicious - definitely a make-again. Maybe even tonight...

Rating: 3
Yummy comfort food for a chilly and gray winter day. A bit pricey, though, if you have few of the ingredients on hand (it cost me $15.67). Rarely have I made a pasta dish so well-suited for shells...they envelope the sauce perfectly. I agree with other writers that a handful of basil might raise this dish to exceptional status. Even without it, though, it's an indulgence and a keeper.

I've made this recipe many times now. It is my kid's favorite...my daughter named it the "Perfect Pasta". I also used basil instead of parsley. I doubled the chicken broth to make it saucier and I added a little cayenne pepper. One time I substituted the olives with capers. It was good but I think I prefer the olives. This is the best pasta dish I have ever made and my kids request it every weekend! ...I'm adding an update to this since I've seen many people say it is too salty. I never add salt to this recipe, with the olives, cheese and chicken broth it doesn't need it!

On the advice of another review I doubled the broth and used basil, it was very good but a little salty. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use low-sodium broth and will not add any additional salt. A great easy dish, perfect for a week night dinner.

This was fabulous! I also used basil instead of parsley and it was incredibly delicious.

Very rich and tasty.I made this for a casual dinner party and everyone liked it a lot. This was easy to make, although there is a bit of prep work best done ahead of time. I used bow tie pasta which worked very well. Intense goat cheese flavor, quite RICH; I recommend serving with a green salad, some crusty bread, and a light dessert, e.g. sorbet, fruit, biscotti.

I thought this dish was amazing! I just loved it. I'm definitely going to make it over and over again. Next time I will double the recipe and serve it for guests. The only adjustment I made was to use 1 tblsp. of olive oil instead of 2. I would recommend this especially to those who love sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese. Mmmmm.

I did adjust the sun-dried tomatoes as I NEVERuse the ones packed in oil -- I reconstitute the dry ones in boiling water saves calories, fat and flavour. And I reduced the 2 Tbsp of olive oil to just one -- but the recipe is absolutely delicious with those adjustments. The original one, remember, was from a 1991 issue -- we have all learned a lot in the last decade about healthy eating and cooking.

My husband really likes this dish, even though he's not a big fan of sun-dried tomatoes. I use vegetable broth (I'm a vegetarian), and prefer using rehydrated tomatoes to eliminate some of the oil. Its rich,earthy flavors make it a good choice for a cool-weather supper.

Only for BIG fans of sundried tomatoes. The dish is really overpowered by them. Goat cheese adds nice subtle flavor and creaminess. You'll need to double the amount of stock. You'll also end up with a very oily dish unless you drain the sun dried tomatoes well. Might be better with oven roasted tomatoes or even fresh tomatoes added at the end.
