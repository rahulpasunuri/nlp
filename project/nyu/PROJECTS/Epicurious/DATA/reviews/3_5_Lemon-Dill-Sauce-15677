Didn't have wine so improvised with mayo, shallot, lemon and dill. It was great with the fish as written!

This sauce is to die for! Absolutely scrumptious, I thought I went to heaven. I could not find shallots at the market, so I substituted the whites of green onion and a bit of garlic. Divine. Tried it with broccoli too, and it was delicious.

We had this on grilled salmon. Delicious and rich, and very easy. Will make again!

I made this with sea bass and it was FAB! I did however, omit the breadcrumbs and used the walnuts and parmasean. I brushed the dijon and horseradish along with the dill on the fish prior to rolling the fish in the walnuts and cheeze. I also added extra lemon to the mixture.

wonderful with grilled salmon!

I cut back on the butter but went with the full amount of lemon and liked it a lot. Probably next time I'd make a smaller amount, because it doesn't take much sauce to deliver a lemony flavor.

This is a super simple sauce for any seafood dish. I served it over baked lemon pepper salmon from this site and it was a delish. Same ingredients on fish and in sauce made it easy to prep and since baked salmon tends to lack visual appeal, this sauce solved the aesthetic issue.

Our family loved this sauce and I have used it on chicken and vegetables.....really easy and great taste.

I made the this with the recipe for the baked bass with breadcrumbs and walnuts. I used rock fish. I was nervouse because I was making this for the first time and having company for dinner. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this agian

to strong, would reduce the lemon, great with asparagus too!

Be sure to stir/whip butter the whole time while you make it- or it doesn't cream right. Also, the leftover sauce is fantastic on peas.

I thought this sauce went so well with the BAKED SEA BASS WITH WALNUT-BREADCRUMB CRUST AND LEMON-DILL SAUCE recipe. I have made it twice now and both times it was delicious.

I have never rated a recipe here 1 fork. This was just so-so, even with half the butter. If I used all the butter, it would have tasted just like melted butter on my fish, yuck! Fresh lemon adds much more depth to the walnut-crusted sea bass than this sauce- glad I made it on the side and then down the sink!

When I tasted this sauce in the sauce pan my first instinct was "Way too much lemon!" but I poured it over grilled halibut and it seemed to balance it out. It was a wonderfully lite edition to the dinner. Way better than using a cream dill sauce. I will definately make this dish again and again. You must like lemon quite abit to appreciate this sauce.

I did not like this recipe; the shallots too strong. There are other lighter dill sauce recipes I would prefer.

usually a 94 on this site is outstanding but this recipe sucked. i agree this was way too bitter

I thought this was quite pathetic. Way too much lemon (and they were lovely home grown Meyers), way too thin, not enough dill. I tried to improve it with some heavy cream and it was still bad.

This was excellent. I forgot to cut the lemon back as the other review mentioned and it was sooo lemony so, I too, added sugar and it was delicious. I made it with the Walnut Crusted Sea Bass and it received rave reviews from our dinner guests!

This is simply scrumptious! Our dinner guests talked about it for weeks. Too much sauce for the amount of fish though. Otherwise, perfectly perfect AND simple too!!

Delicious! Mad it as the recipe states but with a little less lemon juice, as per the advice of the earlier reviewer. Makes a humble piece of fish (in my case tilapia) sing! I love this site!!

This may seem like an unusual substitution however, we did not have any white wine (we are red wine drinkers). Instead we used Vermouth and the sauce was outstanding over grilled salmon. It is drier and even if you reduce the amount of butter, the result is a sauce that pairs well with any seafood-I highly reccommend the Vermouth!

A little to much lemon for our taste, I added a little sugar to cut the acidity. I will make this again but use a little less lemon. A little sauce does go a long way.

Quite yummy. We served over haddock. We substituted Red onion for the shallots which gave it an incredible red color.

My husband and I made halibut & scallops pouring the sauce over the seafood. It was a light, refreshing taste that we will definitly try again!

as per the previous reviewer, i also used dried dill weed and cut back on the butter. both my husband and i thought the flavor was wonderful and you can't beat this for simplicity! that's what i call a great recipe!

I used half the amount of butter called for and dried dill weed instead of fresh and it was still wonderful!

This was good, & easy. A little goes a long way.

I used this recipe along with poached salmon and it was wonderful!! It had just the right amount of lemon juice and dill. Next I'll use it over chicken breast.

Very rich, use sparingly, but amazing on both fish and chicken.

I made this for the seabass with walnut topping recipe. Very rich, would be excellent with salmon, halibut, shellfish, chicken. I had to substitue dried dill, the fresh would be even better.
