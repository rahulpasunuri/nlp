I've made this pie many times and love it. The apricot preserves give a tart, candied flavor to the crust. I use a generous amount of apricot preserves- a bit more than called for in recipe. One very important note about the crust- The dough easily"melts" into a pool in the middle of the pie plate unless the following two steps are followed. 1) Chill plate with dough in it already formed for about 15-30 minutes. 2) Pre-heat oven fully! I'm sometimes impatient and put things in the oven before it is fully heated. I usually serve this pie with unsweetened whipped cream to off set the already sweet crust and filling.

I've made this on more than one occasion and every one who had a slice thought it was the best pumpkin pie recipe. I agree. The apricot preserves add something special!

This is not a good recipe for several reasons. First off, the ratio of dry and wet ingredients for the crust is off. I tried it anyway, noting that many readers used a different crust altogether. I had the same experience as others with the crust collapsing during blind-baking stage. I threw it in the garbage and started over with my own pie crust recipe. I wish I hadn't bothered because the filling turned out really bland, and I had added some nutmeg and allspice to it. I am very experienced baker and do not understand the high ratings given to this recipe.

Excellent filling texture. I increased the spices a bit, and added cloves and fresh ground nutmeg. I didn't do the crust here, just a basic pie crust. Awesome.

This is so good. I've made it without the apricot preserves as my son is allergic to them. Everyone raves and requests this every year.

Never been a fan of pumpkin pie...at least until now. I used Julia's pastry recipe (have several batches in the freezer) and used Penzey's Vietnamese cinnamon It's more flavorful The pie is out of this world!!!

I cheated and used a frozen pie crust but I added the apricot preserves. Used one pie pumpkin instead of canned (cut in half, take seeds out, put in microwavable dish with some water and cook for approximately 20 minutes or until tender, scoop out flesh and puree with a hand blender). This was the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. The only thing that didn't go as planned was baking time - it took a solid hour and a half at 325 to get it done.

Just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was yummy! Followed some suggestions here and added a half tsp of nutmeg, a quarter tsp of allspice and upped the ginger to a full tsp (I prefer a spicier pumpkin pie). And the apricot preserves, while not necessary, really add a nice punch. Husband definitely appreciated the apricot. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this pie since it appeared in Bon Appetit and ALWAYS make it with fresh pumpkin. The difference is an amazingly light and delicious filling. Once you use fresh pumpkin you'll never go back to canned pumpkin. The apricot preserves add a great flavor.

This is really a great recipe. The crust is so amazing. It's like a cookie crumb crust and tastes so good. The only problem I do have with the crust is it slides down the pie plate when I am baking it so I don't get a great looking pie. But I gave it 4 forks because it's the best pumkin pie as far as taste goes.

I used a store bought crust (Pillsbury, refrigerated) and forgot to put in the apricot preserves (d'oh!) but I would say this recipe turned out great anyway. I had a little trouble figuring out if the filling consistency was good (I used a fork to beat it, then remembered that I do indeed have an electric mixer so I switched to that, it seemed a bit runny and made me nervous) and the timing for baking seemed a little off-- I prebaked my crust for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees until it looked like typical semi-golden puff pastry, poured in the filling, and baked for about an hour at 325. The crust wasn't browning so I turned up the heat to 425 and baked for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. It got so big! Like, the filling puffed up quite a bit and looked weird, but after setting for a half hour it flattened out and turned into one of the prettiest and most delicious pies I have ever made. The ratios of spices are perfect and there is nothing I would really add or subtract to this recipe-- it's just a classic pumpkin pie and I cannot shake a stick at that.

Rating: 4
I left out the apricot preserves and doubled the recipe to make two pies. I ended up with three 9" pies and 3 tarts! I didn't make the crust, either. However, the pie was VERY well received by my family. They really liked the creamy texture and found it "set" a bit better than a standard pumpkin pie. Definitely making this again.

I think the name of this recipe is misleading! I made two pies from this recipe for Thanksgiving last weekend and it was a huge disappointment.

made this again for T-giving & family & I loved it. Wanted to do a gingersnap crust but couldn't find gingersnaps at the store so did one with vanilla wafers. It complemented the pumpkin flavors quite nicely. And skipped the cornstarch in the pie -- didn't have any & didn't see the point.

Rating: 2
Tasty, but the addition of sour cream made it lighter, more mousse-like, than I would have preferred. I missed the dense, pumpkin-y flavor of a more traditional pie. I went with this one fooled by the name (I *was* looking for the ultimate pumpkin pie, after all), not appreciating how much of a difference the sour cream plus so much whipping cream can make in the taste as well as the texture. Should have guessed.

I found the pie crust to be too sweet. I like my pumpkin pie crust to be more on the salty side to offset the sweetness of the filling. The filling for this recipe was good - but, again, the pie crust was too sweet.

I've been making this pie for years. It's a family favorite, truly the ulimate pumpkin pie! As for the crust, I gave up trying the special tabs and cutouts, just use the recipe and finish the top with traditional crimping method. It does tend to shrink some, so I chill mine in the freezer and use extra pie weights when browning the crust, that seems to have solved the problems. Also I use a tradition pastry blender, not a processor. I think the processing might make this dough to soft and sticky. I think the sweet crust adds alot to the pie. Some years I make as is, some years I add extra spices (tsp of ginger, tsp of allspice, 1/2 tsp of cloves). The pic gets raves no matter what. One caution - if you don't have the apricor preserves, DO NOT substitue orange maramalade... that was bad :) Over all, this is my absolute favorite pumpkin pie recipe!! try it, you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 3
I followed other reviewers' advice and used a different crust recipe (Martha Stewart) but followed the filling recipe exactly. The only change I made was to use a metal pie pan rather than glass. However, my cook time was dramatically longer than 55 minutes. More like 90 minutes to get a knife to come out clean 1" from the center. The pie tasted excellent and the crust was saved by putting foil over the edges to prevent over-browning with the extended cook time. I can't explain why it took so much longer for mine when very few others have mentioned this as an issue. I would still recommend the pie.

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe ever. I use fresh pumpkin too. But boiling (and peeling!!!)? No way! I bake my pie pumpkins the day before and chill - much easier and it warms up the house two nights in a row. At the request of the boyfriend, I added some vanilla and was surprised at how well it worked.

Made this last night- my first pie ever (I'm still a newbie) and it turned out pretty well! I think I over processed the crust and it was more like a sugar cookie dough consistency, but it turned out okay. The apricot preserve glaze on the crust was delicious and really added something. My husband was trying to place what tasted so different (and good!) from regular pumpkin pies and once I told him what it was, he loved it! This took longer to bake- about 75 minutes total, but it really came out well. I will definitely be trying to make this recipe again!

I wanted to love this recipe, and did fall in love with the texture - but the taste was a little off. I followed everything to a T, but added 1 tea more of cinnamon and 1/4 tea more ginger, and the pie had an overly powerful spice taste. It was a little off-setting, which was very surprising. I will definitely need to try it again with the actual measurements. Guess you shouldn't question Bon Appetit!

I've been making this pie for the past two years and it has converted many... MANY of my friends who don't even like pumpkin pie. Due to personal preference, I leave out the apricot preserves. I usually have extra filling after I make the pie, so I put it into little custard dishes and bake it into pumpkin custard. Amazing :)

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe that I am allowed to bring to family gatherings. Everyone (even those who don't really care for pumpkin pie) loves it. The apricot adds a nice depth and a little tang that no one can place but everybody loves. And talk about creamy....Mmmmmmmm. This recipe is worlds better than the one on the pumpkin can. *Note I do use my own crust recipe, the one listed here is a pain.

I've been trying various pumpkin pie recipes for years in hopes of finding a silky and creamy filling. I found it! However, I've made several adjustments to get to a fantastic filling, using this recipe as the base. Double the cinnamon and ginger; add 1 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg. I'm an excellent baker so I wanted to try the crust. I agree with others -- it tastes wonderful but is not worth the hassle. I use Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee (all butter crust). I prebaked the crust about 3/4 of the time that a pre-based crust requires in order to keep it from shrinking too much. Then I put the filled pie pan (glass pan) on a cookie sheet and bake on the bottom oven rack to help the crust bake a little bit more as the entire pie bakes. Keep the apricot -- it's unusual but interesting.

for the cook looking to "fix" the pie crust recipe.... first of all it has no salt. and I've never used cream or powdered sugar for a pie crust. This is the flawless pie crust recipe I use. 4 T ice water, plus more as needed 3/4 t apple cider vinegar 1 1/2 cups AP flour 1 T sugar ¾ t salt 9 T cold unsalted butter, cubed make it like a regular pie crust...keep the butter cold...I rarely use ALL the water.

I first had this Pumpkin Pie in 1993 when it was published in Bon Appetit magazine, while living in Vermont. My boyfriend and I went to his best friend's for dinner well ahead of Thanksgiving, and his girlfriend made this pie. I immediately bought the magazine, and have been making this pie ever since. Everyone loves it!! I do not make the crust, because I do not make pie crusts for whatever reason. Everyone loves the apricot jam touch -- please use a good jam like a homemade one or smuckers -- use an apricot preserve with some whole or partial apricots still in it. Also, I sometimes substitue the heavy whipping cream for part that and part light cream, or nonfat sourcream. It still has a wonderful texture and flavor and reduces the fat content. My late father loved this pie, as did all my family, my various boyfriends over the years, my friends and neighbors. Since I don't make the crust from scratch, I have found by trial and error the best store crusts are: Ritz, or Old Orchard, or any crust with only natural ingredients. As a special and fun touch, I bake this in a French pie tart with a removeable side pan! I learned this trick from my cousin's French wife when visiting them for Thanksgiving dinner in Paris back in 1985! I will still experiment with other pies, but this is one of my staples. Thank you for having it on this website, as I have moved recently and all my cookbooks and recipes are still in boxes. Bon Appetit!!

I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie but I have to admit this one was really very good. I didn't make the crust because of the other reviews but next time I will definitely try the crust as I feel it would have been better. I did add 1/2 tea of cloves and 1/2 tea of nutmeg. It still could have used a little more. Next time I will add 1 tbs of Orange rind for flavor. I would definitely make this again. The apricot preserves add a very nice flavor.

First, allow me to say that this recipe is my all-time, hands-down favorite recipe. . .for pumpkin pie filling. That said, it is also my bete-noir. Although the flavor and texture of the crust is wonderful, the crust recipe is fatally flawed. I've only gotten it to come out intact maybe twice, and that entailed herculean extracurricular engineering. . .does anyone understand the chemistry of baking well enough to "fix" this recipe???? Help?

I think I've tried about a thousand pumpkin pie recipes, and this one by far delivers the best consistency. It's very silky and creamy but not too creamy. I tweaked the rest of it considerably, I added 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar. Also used my own pie crust recipe. The texture is what gets my 4 forks.

Good filling though the apricot isn't really noticable. I think it is the crust that makes this stand out. I enjoy tart crusts but my family doesn't so when I made this sweet crust, they fell in love. No mushy problems or really any problems of any kind. I did do a few things different, I didn't use a food processor and I used a spritz bottle to apply the cream.

I only rated 3 forks instead of 4 b/c of the awful crust. Beware, many of the reviewers made the pie filling, which is excellent, but used frozen crust. My crust turned out mushy so I threw it out and used the all butter pie crust from Cook's Illustrated. So one fork for the crust, 4 for the pie. My husband and I were divided over the apricot filling; I thought it added something different, but he thought it was unnecessary and didn't add much.

Add another 4-fork- review! I have been making this pie for YEARS (since finding it on this site.) I will never go back to evaporated milk...yuck. This pumpkin pie has a similar flavor to regular "back-of-the- can" recipes, but the texture is what is most outstanding. It is smooth and creamy, not glopy. I can hardly eat the other kind any longer...the texture isn't the same as this. I just use store bought crust. Way easier when you make a bunch of these pies. I always bake around 7 or 8 of these at Thanksgiving and give them to family and neighbors. I don't double the recipe, just keep repeating (no need to to wash bowl for each batch) Sometimes I have more filling than one pie's worth, so I get the crusts ready, and fill as many as I can, then add more ingredients to what is left in the bowl for the next batch. If there is any left after the last crust is full, I fill ramekins and bake crust-less. I have also tried using fresh baked and then mashed pumpkin. Don't bother. What a time-consuming task that didn't result in any better flavor or texture. Canned is fine in this recipe...heck aren't we busy enough?

Excellent pumpkin pie, very very creamy. Used a storebought crust since I didn't have time to make one, and I'm glad I didn't considering the reviews it got. The filling isn't very spicy, but you could just add more ginger and nutmeg and allspice to jazz it up a bit. I used heavy cream instead of light whipping cream, I don't think there was a big difference. It could be a little bit sweeter too, but overall it is amazing, and the prettiest orange colour! I served it with homemade whipped cream made from heavy cream and it was wonderful!

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas to rave reviews. The one change I make is to use fresh pumpkin. It's not hard, just get a baking pumpkin, bake whole for an hour or until a knife pierces easily. When it cools, cut it in half, scoop & discard the seeds. Then, scoop out the pulp and toss into the food processor or blender and puree. Use the same amount of pureed pumpkin that the recipe calls for. This makes for a unique and outstanding pumpkin pie. You can freeze the extra pureed pumpkin for the next pie.

This is a great pumpkin pie! If you're wondering, you can't even tell the apricot preserves are in there once it's baked, they just blend right in to enhance the flavor. I use more preserves than called for, as well. I do highly recommend using real pumpkin instead of canned, the flavor is more smoky and interesting than canned. It's easy, just get a small baking pumpkin, toss it in the oven for about an hour. After it cools, cut it in half and scoop & discard the seeds. Then, scoop out the pulp and put it in a blender to pulverize. Then, just use it in the same quantity & the same way you'd use the canned pumpkin. It's worth it, and not as hard as it sounds.

I LOVE this recipe!! It is requested by my family every year and has been a tradition in our family since 1993. I also have used a pillsbury pie crust as a substitute before and it worked great. The apricot preserves make it extra special!! You will never make a regular pumpkin pie again!!!

There are easier recipes for pumpkin pie, but none better. I make it for my family, friends and the people at work and everyone loves it.

I am a pastry chef at a well known restaurant. I wanted a pumkin pie filling to add to my new dessert menu. I hate pumpkin pie, and I didn't have any family recipes from which to glean inspiration. My plan was to make a pumkin pie filling and dress it up a lot for a fabulous restaurant dessert. I tested this recipe and was not inspired. And, yes, I can taste things I don't like and know if they are good enough to serve to my customers. When this was tasted by the rest of the kitchen staff, the conclusion was uninteresting (read: don't serve this).

I don't know what happened with the crust but it came out horribly. When I took out the foil after the ten minutes of baking, the crust sides had fallen and there was liquid in the bottom. Then with the foil off for the last ten minutes, the crust bottom puffed up. When I finally poured in the filling, it came up above the edges of the fallen crust! I followed the directions exactly so if anyone knows why this happened, let me know! It tastes great but next time will use a different crust.

This is the first time I've made a pumpkin pie where all the crust (even the bottom) was perfectly baked. I forgot to add the preserves and it was still amazing!

Pumpkin pie has never been my favorite but from all that I have tried this one is the best. My family also loved it (they are more of the pumpkin pie kind). I used a french recipe for the crust though--it calls for only 2 tablespoons of sugar (makes for the European touch:), half a teaspoon of salt, and 5-7 tablespoons iced water instead of the cream (flour and butter are same as the recipe here). For the puree, I just microwaved my halved pumpkin, a 7 min deal, and it was just perfect.

This pie is FANTASTIC! I bought a fresh pumpkin, made 2 litres of pumkin soup and still had plenty of pumpkin left over and no idea what to do with it. Found this recipe and gave it a try (I followed the recipe for "pumpkin puree" on this website). I was a little worried as I am a novice when it comes to pies, but this recipe is so clearly written it's almost fool-proof. Had a little trouble with the crust, however. When I removed the foil after baking, part of the crust came off with it. Maybe I I didn't freeze the crust long enough? All in all, a big success and would highly recommend this recipe.

I have never made pumpkin pie, and so this was my first attempt for our thanksgiving dinner at moms house.

I would make it again but I would increase the oven temp to 375-400 degrees.

tried four recipes this year and compared: this was the least spicy of them, but the sour cream and preserves created a nice flavor and it was a beautiful orange color.

Without a doubt my favorite pumpkin pie recipe and one my friends and family beg for every year. The filling is a snap, but the crust is a little fussy. I've found the trick was to make sure the original round of dough is a generous 14"s, freeze it well before baking and make sure you really press in the tin foil on the sides. I've even had success with the trim that's indicated, but I don't bother with that usually because it has a tendancy to be very brittle and browns a bit too much. Instead I make an extra batch of crust and bake enough leaf cookies to embelish each slice of pie with a couple--they look and taste fabulous.

I cut this recipe out of Bon Appetit in 1993 and made it every year for about 5 years. It was the highlight of our Thanksgiving celebration. It is rich and creamy - almost like a pumpkin pie cheese cake. One year someone stole the recipe from my recipe notebook. I finally found it again! Thank you!

I made this pie last year and I generally do not like pumpkin pie (I made it for my boyfriend). This pie was better than our local piemaker's pie who wins awards for their pies. It is really amazing, the flavours blend together so nicely - the apricot preserves are a wonderful touch and the crust is unlike any pumpkin pie crust you'll ever have. It was difficult to make the crust if I recall, and I do remember not looking forward to making it again. However, after eating it, I believe any amount of work is worth it for this pie. I will be making 3 this year - one for Thanksgiving dinner, one for after thanksgiving dinner, and one to freeze to see if I can eat it later in the year.

I've been making this one for Thanksgiving for years (thought I'd rated it, but maybe it is so far back that it has been deleted. Crust is very short and flaky and a bit difficult to work with, but the flavor of it and the rich filling really do make the ultimate for me. How anyone could eat or prefer a Libby pie with evaporated milk or even worse from the cans of pumpkin pie mix is beyond me!

I made two pies for Thanksgiving. I was a little leary about the apricot (just sounded like an odd flavor to me), but boy was I wrong. I will never make traditional pumpkin pie again! This pie was creamy and delicious! I did use my regular pie crust recipe because I didn't have time to try the one listed (too many people said it was a pain to make). But this is our new pumpkin pie recipe.

Rating: 4
Yes, the crust is a pain, even when well chilled. But the filling with the apricot preserves is so good, it doesn't matter. I've made this pie for several years. This year, 80% of the rim of the crust and some of the sides stuck to the foil and fell off into the oven. Don't worry. Just pour the filling in anyway and bake it. It turned out great, even if a bit cosmetically impaired. Everyone loves it!

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I decided to use a store-bought pie crust, which was bland, but the filling was delicious. Resisted temptation to leave in the oven a few minutes longer when the middle seemed under done and it set up beautifully. The apricots gave it just enough of a zing. I think this will prove a Thanksgiving tradition in my house.

Rating: 2
This was a good tasting pie -- but read all of the reviews before attempting it. I usually have no problem with crusts, but when I took this one out of the oven to check on it (after 10 min, with the foil) and it melted down before I could do anything, ruining the edging decorations, and making it unusable. I had to remake the crust. The second time, I just poured the filling in, with no prebaking or preserves in the interest of time. I will try it again with all of the tedious instructions about to get the crust right, but...required patience!! Good thing the pie tasted so good.

Rating: 2
I think the word "ultimate" is misleading. The pie was okay, but not the best I've ever had. Something just seemed like it was missing to me. I had the pie in the oven for an hour and ten minutes to get the filling to set and the crust edges ended up getting a little too done. I think I would rename this recipe, "Pumkin Pie with Apricot Preserves". Like I said, the "ultimate" kind of builds up your expectations.

This pie has great consistency and it's not too spicy. Plus, we had fun challenging our guests to guess the "secret" ingredient (the apricot preserves). I don't really like pumpkin pie but I liked this one and I would enjoy making it again.

I have been making this pie since the recipe came out in Bon Appetit 10 years ago. Although I use a pre-made pie crust, I love the filling. The apricot preserves add a special surprise to a wonderfully creamy pie. It is a must at every Thanksgiving!

I just don't get it. This pie was uninspiring, uninteresting and too sweet.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I agree, the crust is very tasty, but too soft to have the "tooth" effect. I froze mime before I baked and, it still fell off, I managed to pull it out of oven and patch crust. Filling had a nice taste - very, very cream, but I like pumpkin pies a little denser, so next time I'll cook it more.

Rating: 4
We have made this pie for 10 years. And finally this year figured out how to do the crust. Once you put the dough in the pie pan, you must PRESS the foil onto the dough forcefully so that the crust does not "slip" when it is pre-baked. Now, we still have the original photo that was run with this recipe and I am here to tell you that there is no way the crust will ever have the fancy fluting on the edges that is shown in it. But at least this year, we had crust up to the pie plate rim. We considered it quite an achievement!

Rating: 2
I was disappointed in the finished pie. I have tried a lot of pumpkin pie recipes and found this to be one of the least appealing. It was good, but not special. The only good idea from this recipe was the use of apricot jam to coat the bottom of the pie crust. That added some interest to a pedestrian pie. I'll use the jam again, just not this recipe.

Rating: 4
I have finally figured out the crust after threes years of amking this "must-have" for Thanksgiving. First, roll the very chilled dough between plastic wrap and don't worry about making the top crust really fancy. Secondly, and most importantly, use crisco or butter and grease the foil before you press it to the crust and sides. For the crust not to fall, press hard. For the crust not to stick to the foil, crisco is the charm. Then, only cook for 5-8 minutes without the foil. It really takes the hassle out of a wonderful pie, and it gets easier the more you mke it!

Rating: 4
I love this recipie and I have'nt had a problem with the crust.The reason for that is thatI do not prebake the crust.I make the crust and place it in pie pan the day or night before I bake it and set it in the freezer.On the day of,I make the filling,pour it in the frozen crust and put a foil ring around the edge of the crust.Then I bake it on a preheated pizza/baking stone or you could set it on the lowest rack or the oven floor.These things insure that the bottom crust is not soggy.It always turns out great for me!

I have made this pumkin pie every year since its debut in 1993. It was a hit back then and it remains in the dessert spotlight at the holiday table. The "secret" ingredient of apricot preserves puts an extra zing into a great holiday favorite at our home. Thanks, B.A.

I have made this pie several times and can tell you that its name, "The Ultimate Pumpkin Pie", is not an exaggeration. If you want to make your friends squeal with pumpkiny delight, this is your pumpkin pie. One note of caution, working with the crust does require some patience.

I made this pie for the first time last Thanksgiving. Everyone loved the pie and it was gone in no time flat. The apricot preserves give it a bit of tartness, and the whipping cream aids in the creamy texture that was loved by all. NOTE: I doubled the preserves, and I used the "Gingersnap Pecan Crust" recipe also found on this website. I highly reccommend the gingersnap pecan crust, it pairs well with the pumpkin & apricots. Additionally, it's much easier to make than the crust listed above.

Rating: 3
This pie was delicious! I had a couple of problems, though, that maybe someone here could help me with. First, when I pre-baked the crust as directed, the foil stuck to the crust and damaged it. It turned out ok, but I'd rather it be perfect. Also, when I pured the filling in, I guess it "pushed" preserves around so that there was not a little in every bite, but rather, some here and some there. I will make this again--maybe I can learn to work out these two glitches. The whole family thought it was yummy.

This was my fifth year making this pie. The crust is a devil! It always melts and shrinks but I have to say it is a great tasting crust so I never change it. I will NEVER make another pumpkin pie recipe. The dense custard over that apricot bottom melts in your mouth. It's heaven.

I have made this twice - once with fresh butternut squash and the other with canned pie filling. We actually preferred the canned filling for texture, appearance and flavour. We all thought this was about the best pumpkin pie we'd had. The apricot jam on the bottom was a delightful twist. The only problem I had was baking time. Pie number two was in a slightly smaller pan AND I used metal rather than glass (which could make a difference) and the bake time went WAY up. I was getting concerned. I always have shrinkage problems with fresh crusts and I used another favorite crust recipe, not this one. Anyway, if you like pumpkin pie, I'd definitely recommend this and don't be swayed by the negatives - form your own opinion!

Rating: 4
I used a store-bought crust for this, and when I made the filling, I forgot to put in the sour cream! It didn't matter, though, because everyone who ate it said it was the most delicious pumpkin pie they'd ever tasted. I would high recommend it--the filling is just wonderful!

I have made this pie twice, and the thing that keeps me from loving it is the crust. This crust is more of a cookie crust. It isn't the usual flaky pie crust. It is easier to make, but it can be tricky to work with and a little harder then I like it. The filling is WONDERFUL!! I intend to experiment with a flakier crust and the filling from this recipe next time. All in all it is still worth making!

I always use a Julia Child crust so this review is for the filling only. Where I live canned pumpkin is unavailable so I substitute fresh baked, mashed yams. The filling made with this recipe had a lovely smooth, light texture but all the partakers at our recent Thanksgiving dinner found the flavor a little bland. Next time I'd add allspice and nutmeg.

Rating: 1
Pumpkin pie is my favorite, and thought it would be fun to try something different. A word about crust: it can make or break a good filling. Crust texture and flavor is paramount in overall outcome. The crust in this recipe is too sweet, a fright to work with, and I regretted fooling around with it---will stick with my oil crust recipe, which produces perfect results every time. Agree with several reviewers that filling was bland, and while nobody died after ingesting this pie, I will continue to prepare the Libby rendition in the future (except I use fresh milk instead of evaporated).

I've made this recipe 2 or 3 Thanksgivings running and my family has adored it. I've followed the recipe as written. (Even though I've attended cooking school I'm not comfortable taking too many liberties with recipes until I've tried them as written. I've had too many disasters when I've gotten overly creative, although adjusting and adding seasonings usually works out well for me.) Anyway, as my family and I are year older and a little more health conscious, I'm going to search for a lower-fat recipe this year, maybe something with streusel or something else a little different. But it's a pie to try at least once; it's wonderful!

This pie deserves every excellent review it received and it deserves the title too. If you normally make you own crusts then this crust is as easy as any other crust. However, I forgot to bake the crust beforehand as the instructions called for. Instead, I baked the whole thing at 325°F. Took longer but the result was still terrific.

As a person who is not that fond of pumpkin pie, I am rating this as the best pie I have ever eaten or made. My pie stood up to other pies at Christmas that were made by serious pie bakers and was rated the best by everyone. The crust is the most difficult and time comsuming part, but it is worth the effort. If you like butter cookies, then make the crust. I wouldn't change or substitute a single ingredient, although I do use a bit more of the apricot preserves than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 3
Not your "traditional" pumpkin pie. Everyone love it. Do secure the edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil because it will fall. Interesting that some people rate this recipe so-so but then admit to changing it so drastically. I wouldn't change a thing.

Rating: 4
Everyone in our family loved this pumpkin pie recipe better than the traditional recipe, especially the crust. I noticed that I needed to make sure the crust is securely hanging over the edge of the pie pan because it can melt down the inside of the pan when baking. The foil lining the crust also helps with this problem. I will definitely use this recipe from now on.

Was disappointed with the blandness of this pie. It needs more spices and perhaps more sweetness. However, I think when I consider how much effort it is to make, I would rather buy a pumpkin pie since it came out tasting no better than a supermarket brand.

I have a extraordinarily tender pie crust recipe that I always use, so I made only the filling, which was quite good and ample. However, the apricot preserves change the true flavor of pumpkin pie, leaving an acidic and tart aftertaste. No one that ate the pie thought that introducing the preserves was a good idea. I would make the filling again, but skip the apricot preserves.

HOW DO YOU USE FRESH PUMPKINS INSTEAD OF CANNED??? - KEEP READING Very nice! I used a diffrent crust, and I skipped the apricot, also cut the spices in half - my dad says spices kill most pumpkin pies, then you can't tastes the pumpkin. One guest this Thanksgiving said it was the best pumpkin pie he ever had! I'd say it's a cut above Libby's. I got a few sugar pumpkins and cut a small hole around the stem and a matching one around the thing on the bottom and quartered the pumpkin - four pieces of pumpkin. I scrapped the seeds and stuff from the flesh and baked them on foil at 350 for an hour and a half - let cool and the softened flesh scrapped right off. I pureed it and weighed it out - 15 oz - and put it in the pie. Made a very nice shimmering bright orange color too. When one guest heard I used fresh pumpkins, she said "Wow" :) When I asked my dad if it was like his mother used to make (she used fresh pumpkins, too, he closed his eyes in concentration and said "It's close." I am making it again next year! PS - I am a man (and proud I cook!)

This was the first pie I ever made and it was fabulous! I made the recipe per the instructions, including the crust and the apricot jelly. The crust was difficult, but it is worth the time and very yummy! I think you could use this crust recipe to make short bread cookies. I had extra dough and rolled it out into stars and baked them - they were eaten before we had a chance to try the pie. As for the apricot jelly, I was a bit cautious and almost didn't add it but I did and I wouldn't change a thing. If you are looking for a creamy pumpkin pie, this is it. If you want spice, continue searching.

Rating: 3
I like this recipe because it's about the taste of pumpkin, not what you add to it. The texture is light, not gummy, and the preserves (I use peach) help to keep the crust crisp. If you prefer a dense, heavily spiced pie, look elsewhere. I like this one.

Did I miss something? Did I forget the ingredient that would give this pie taste? While my whole family loves pumpkin pie, this pie just didn't cut it. It wholly lacked the wonderfully rich taste of pumpkin pie. As my son said: "It tastes like baby food."

Please don't give up on the crust! It is really special and makes the pie. Here is how I've mastered the crust: I used a plastic, zippered pie crust bag(sold at most kitchen stores). You flour the inside lightly and place the crust in the bag, zip it, and roll out to a perfect circle. Unzip, place the pie dish upside down over the crust and flip over, and gently form into the pan. However, this method will only roll out about a 9" circle (recipe says 14"). I have found a smaller circle actually works better. The smaller circle is a bit more dense and stays together better. I simply crimp the edges like you would do for most pies. After a lot of trial and error to get this crust right, this has been fool proof for me. Good luck!

I've made this every year since the recipe was printed, but minus the apricot preserves and with the spices increased. For the cook in Maryland who is so appalled by the use of canned pumpkin, perhaps you should, as they say, get over yourself. Unless you grow your own pumpkin, the best pie varieties are grown almost exclusively for the canning industry and are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to find even in major metropolitan areas. Even if they were, the average kitchen does not have equipment up to the task of pureeing the pumpkins to as fine and creamy a consistency as most people prefer.

This is the family favorite Pumpkin Pie recipe for 4 years now Thanksgiving & Christmas. I use fresh baked pumpkin 2 cups. I spice to my liking with 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. fresh ginger, & 1/4 t. ground ginger. I also add 1/4 t. ground cloves and grate fresh nutmeg to taste (I leave nutmeg out of one pie for my brother). I use the Gingersnap Pecan Crust (on this site)...easy and the best. I DO NOT use the Apricot Preserves. Pure Pumpkin Pie only! Happy Holidays!

After reading the rave reviews from other bakers, I was ready to be blown away by this pie. Unfortunately, I found it to be rather pedestrian. From the overly-sweet, buttery crust to the dense filling, I was totally unimpressed. Pumpkin pie should be silky smooth, the pastry flaky and light. With all its rich ingredients, this pie just tries too hard and ultimately falls well short of its billing.

I first made this pie in 1993 and have made it every other year since. I like to substitute creme fraiche for the sour cream to give it a different type of tang.

I've looked high and low for a good pumpkin pie recipe. I finally find it. This is the most incredible pumpkin pie recipe ever. I made it first for Thanksgiving (1999) and have made it three more times since! A couple of comments. This one needs some babysitting. I've never made a crust with powdered sugar. Don't be too concerned that the crust won't turn out. I freaked the first time -- I thought I messed up (the crust "fell" from the rim of the pie pan) but it turned out fine with a "homemade" look. Take the time on this one -- you won't regret it.

For the second year in a row, the ultimate pumpkin pie got rave reviews from the entire family at Thanksgiving. Light as custard and sinfully rich, it is now a mainstay on the holiday menu.

I too cheated and used a ready pastry shell, but I got more compliments on this pie than I've ever received on any dessert. I think the use of real cream and butter makes the difference.

This IS the ULTIMATE PUMPKIN PIE! The whipping cream and the sour cream definitely made the filling silky and smooth. The amount of spices was perfect...very soft and delicate...not too spicy.I agree, the crust was very difficult to work with. Second time I made it I used only 6 Tablespoons of butter and the crust was easier to handle and was perfect! It was delicious and stayed crispy even the next day. There is no need to look for any other pumpkin recipes. This is it!

This is (so far) the best pumpkin pie recipe I've ever had. I don't think I could ever seriously consider making another.

I am a new baker and this pie was a hit!! The apricot was a nice addition, the crust was a little hard to manage but tasted great.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Absolutely fantastic even though the crust was very difficult to work with. Will definitely make it again.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. This pie was the best pumpkin pie I had ever tasted and fairly easy to make. It was also only the second pie I had ever made.

Ho Hum.. We didn't think this was anything special - a little bland. I think the spices could have been doubled - at least. I won't make this one again.

Everyone loved it! It was great (I used another crust - an easy and good one from _Joy of Cooking_), but the filling was amazing. Though I was tempted to exclude the preserves (not a huge apricot fan), I was happy that I included them because they were the reason that this recipe is so special...

The reviews don't lie! The best pumpkin pie I have tasted -- wonderfully light & creamy and the apricot adds a subtle distinction. My family are not big pumpkin fans, but everyone loved this and wanted seconds... and thirds!

I thought this was an above average recipe. I would have preferred a more intense denser pumpkin flavor in the more old fashioned recipes.

This was my first pie ever. The crust came out a little too cookie like. Maybe next time I will use a combination of shortening/lard and butter to make it more flaky. I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of cloves for more flavor. Also, I added a streusel topping for extra crunch and sweetness. The pie was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner. It was the best pumpkin pie everyone has ever tasted. "Creamy," "not too sweet," and "not too spicy" were some comments. I will definitely make it again and again. It was DELICIOUS!!!

I lost this recipe when I moved, I'm so glad I found it again. I have made it with the perserves and without, (recommend with). The crust is difficult to handle, all I can say is cold, cold, cold. Its a great Thanksgiving tradition.

This is the 7th year that I will be making this pie. It is the best pumpkin pie that I have ever had, and I very often get the same statement from anyone who eats it. I have also had problems with the edge on the crust, but just did a regular rim. The preserves are a must. It absolutely makes this pie into something very special. I have always used low fat sour cream. In the crust, I do use the heavy cream, but in the filling I use evaporated milk. Then I use the rest of the heavy cream for whipped cream.

I must admit I cheated and used a frozen pie crust, plus I left out the apricot preserves. The result was still delicious--a very rich pumpkin flavor with a nice creamy texture. The only thing I might do differently is try to substitute for the cream for something a little more low-fat.

This pie is delicious and worth making every year. Because butter is used in the crust, its really important to keep the dough very cold, and not overworked when rolling it out. I just make the crust with a regular edge with pumpkin cutouts laid atop the filling. Major mmmmmm!

This was the best pumpkin pie that I have ever made. My husband said it was smooth and very flavorful, and he usually does not like pumpkin pie.

I just finished a piece of this heavenly pie! YUMMY! I loved the crust,however,it is hard to work with so it wasn't the prettiest. It was a breeze to mix up in the processor but forming the rim was tricky and broke off in bits in the oven. Perhaps if it had been colder.

The filling is the best pumpkin pie filling I've tasted!!

Two years ago I was asked to bring pumpkin pie to my now inlaw's for thanksgiving, my first one there. I was very nervous and poured over my cookbook and magazine collection to find the best pumpkin pie recipe. I chose this one and it was a success. I not only made a good impression but also started a tradition. I now make four of these pies every thanksgiving and they disappear rather quickly. By the way I use my food processor making all the crusts first and then the fillings and it goes very quickly. I also add additional spices (cloves and nutmeg) to make the flavor a little more complex. Every cook has her customizations.

I am not a big fan of pumpkin pie but this rocked. Everyone else liked it as well, and I went very easy on the apricot preserves, but will go heavier next time as it turned out to be a delicious combo. I cheated and used a premade pie crust to save time. Whipped leftover cream with cinnamon and vanilla for topping too. :-)

Loved this Pumpkin Pie recipe. Hit of the Thanksgiving dinner. BUT, the crust was yummy but design, no good. Little tabs kept breaking off in my oven.

I've made this pie several times, with and without the apricot. Without seems to be preferred. Work quickly if doing by hand, preferably on cool surface as the crust is very delicate. Success with this crust is greatly enhanced if you pre-form the foil in an empty pie dish, and make it 2 layers thick. I use homemade puree. "The best I've ever tasted," and "very creamy" are typical comments. I agree, excellent recipe!

I have made this pie every Thanksgiving since the recipe was published in 1993. I don't even bother trying any other pumpkin pie recipe, this one is for keeps (though I make a different crust).

By far the best pumpkin pie I've ever made--creamy texture and not too spicy. The crust didn't quite make it in a 10" pie plate, but it didn't matter. My search for the perfect recipe ends here!

Excellent recipe, I made 2 of them ate one at halloween breakfast with family. My husband is American so we share the spirit with all those down under. The other one is to devour later. Yummm Yumm will make this at Thanksgiving too!

This filling is one of the best pumpkin pie's I've ever had. The crust is good too, however I prefer to use a different crust with less butter in it. This crust is very sweet and not the easiest to handle.

Instead of rolling out the dough on a floured surface, roll it out in between 2 pieces of saran wrap, it won't stick plus you don't need to dust with flour, leftover filling can be baked in hot water bath in heatproof cups along side the pie

My mom told me this was the best homemade pumpkin pie she ever had. I thought it was great too-- although I think next time I wouldn't use this crust and I'd omit the preserves. Otherwise, totally perfect. I will never use any other recipe.

Wonderful pumpkin pie!! Eaten within the hour by family who couldn't wait until dinner. Definitely on the menu for Thanksgiving. Better than the one on the label of the canned pumpkin! Of course I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted. Now, not sure if I'd use the original recipe. I substituted vanilla low-fat yogurt for the sour cream, and half-and-half for the whipping cream in the filling. Used homemade peach jam instead of apricot preserves to line the pie shell. The filling was too much for my 9-inch pie pan, so next time, I will use the pyrex 10-incher.

Awesome. I come from a family of pumpkin pie connosoirs.....it was give the thumbs up by even the toughest critics. I didn't heed the advise about the temp of the kitchen this is important or the crust falls apart when you go to put it in the pie plate.

Pie was fabulous! I had a little problem with pie crust it started to fall in as I baked it. Would cut down on cream! Served it on Thanksgiving. First dessert to go!

The best pumpkin pie I've ever eaten or made. Gloriously rich and delicious. I substitute butternut squash on occasion for more intense flavor. I always bring copies of the recipe with me when I take the pie to an event, as EVERYONE wants it.

I have been using this recipe for 6 years now, and it has never let me down. You can cut back the sugar a bit if you do not like pies very sweet, otherwise leave it alone, its perfect.

This pie was a big hit at Thanksgiving! I especially like the crust - very easy and tasty. Make sure your kitchen isn't too warm when rolling!
