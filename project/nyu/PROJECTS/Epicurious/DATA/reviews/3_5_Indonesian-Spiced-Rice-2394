I also only made the rice, following another reader's suggestion to make it to go with the chicken, beef and shrimp sates with peanut sauce also on this site. Both recipes were amazing! The rice was superb, I wouldn't change anything!

I made the rice (but not the stir-fry) to accompany the chicken/shrimp/beef sates. It was easy, delicious, and nicely complemented the three meats.

This was just wonderful! I added just a pinch of cinnamon, as suggested by other reviewers. I liked this so much I'd like to do it for company with the chicken sates suggested as part of the "Easy Indonesian" menu. But the dessert suggested doesn't appeal to me. Any one have any great suggestions for a dessert for this meal, preferably a make-ahead dessert? Thanks!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I made this with shrimp sates with pistachio chutney (from this site). I'm making it this weekend for company and the only change I'll make is adding cauliflower to the stir fry and maybe some red peppers for color. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!!

I've made this twice so far and the second time I made it with chicken sate and peanut sauce as an accompaniment. Very tasty. I only used less cinnamon as I thought it too powerful.

Visually stunning! Impressive enough to serve to company, casual enough to make in the middle of the week (we used 1 jalapeno - perfect). My husband's only complaint was that it needed chicken ... I thought it was perfect as written, but agree that adding chicken, pork, or shrimp would be a tasty option. The rice was superb.

This dish was very pretty, as well as being delicious. The only change I made was to put in a few slices of red pepper (to add even more color). The rice turned out perfectly.

This is a very impressive dish. The colorful combination of red cabbage, green beans, bright orange carrots, and yellow rice gets everyone's attention. I used just one jalapeno and it was perfect.

I love this recipe...I have made this for years. Very colorful and great tasting. I love to serve it with sates.

This definitely lived up to our expectations... the spices are great, but definitely too spicey for us, too. We'll cut down on the peppers next time, probably 1/4 of what's called for.

I found it a bit too spicy. Will cut down on the peppers next time
