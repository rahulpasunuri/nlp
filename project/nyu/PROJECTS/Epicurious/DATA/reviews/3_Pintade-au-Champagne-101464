I am sorry the one fork review (done by someone who never even made this dish - which is just bad manners in my opinion) may cause some folks not to try it. It is awesome and a little indulgence every so often is good for the soul. Many old French recipes call for a ton of fat, it would be a crime for them to be lost...

This dish does have a scary sounding fat content. However, if you can afford to be adventurous now and then then this is the dish for you. I had my culinary students prepare this dish and it has been their favorite so far this year. Very flavorful. I suggest experimenting with a variety of wild mushrooms, they offer another layer of flavor (we used morels, shitakes, and king bolete).
