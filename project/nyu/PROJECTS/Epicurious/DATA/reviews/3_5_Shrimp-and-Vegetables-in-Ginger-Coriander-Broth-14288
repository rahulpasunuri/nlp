This was okay. It's really a thai soup that doesn't go entirely through with being thai. I added fish sauce after tasting it and that made a huge difference. I agree with the other comments in that this needs more broth. I'd add a cup more of broth. I'd make it again with some adjustments. Needs halved cherry tomatoes and that basil or mint. Also, I think that tofu would be a much better addition than the bean thread noodles.

this was incredibly easy to put together, perfect for a weeknight dinner. I substituted thinly sliced red pepper for the radishes and used extra broth, still turned out really well. Definitely a new go-to!

Really unique, delicious, lovely light dinner. I used veggie broth, omitted the mushroom, substituted bean sprouts for the radish, and threw in some mint and basil with the cilantro. I think this kind of recipe can be infinately modified, but the avocado is critical - complemented the ginger broth and the shrimp so well.

Easy and tasty. I use only 1/2 of a jalapeno or it is too spicy for me to eat. I tend to watch my calories so I make it without the noodles and it still is very filling-- really a nice meal if you're watching your weight.

I thought this was a nice, light and easy soup. I'd definately make more broth for this recipe. I didn't have bean threads so used rice vermicelli (which I wouldn't recommend); I think a flatter noodle or bean threads would have been better. Avocado and radish were nice, but I'd like to try it with veggies I associate more with Asian soups, like bok choy and water chestnuts. Overall pretty good soup. Not my favorite but worth making-- I'd make it again.

We thought this was very good. The broth becomes opaque when the citrus is added (fun cooking science!). My husband said he would have liked more broth. And, I thought the raw mushroom was a bit odd; I'd sautee it first next time.

Delicious! Such a simple and pleasant dish that I make for my husband when I'm too tired to spend more than 40 minutes on dinner. Since we love "second helpings", I just nicely arrange the vegetables, avocado and shrimp on a platter, along with lime wedges, tabasco sauce, and lots of cilantro, and we just scoop more into our bowls as needed!

I've tried over 50 recipes from Epicurious, and this remains my all-time favorite. It has perfect balance, and has been rated favorably by everyone I've served it to.

I agree that this is very like Vietnamese cuisine. When I made it the first time I found there to be too little broth however. I would add another 8 oz broth. I also swapped out some of the veggies--I eliminated the radishes and added about 1 cup of chopped bok choi instead. Might be good with Shitake mushrooms instead too.

I've made this dish twice, and I'll make it again. It reminds me of a Vietnamese soup/bowl. The vegetables seemed wierd when I made it the first time, but it is very tasty and distinctive.
