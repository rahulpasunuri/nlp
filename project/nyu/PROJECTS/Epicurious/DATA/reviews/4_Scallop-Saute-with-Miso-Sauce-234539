Incredible dish. We served the scallops over some arugula that was very lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice, instead of watercerss. Oh, and ditch the parmesan, it's so out of place (with both Japanese cuisine and seafood). Served with a cold soba noodle salad with veggies on the side. Will definitely make this again.

Tremendous appetizer, with exquisite flavor. We also were able to double the scallops to a pound with room to spare on sauce and other ingredients, which is important if you're making for 5 or more.

This is the best scallop dish I have ever made, and one of the best I have ever eaten. The sauce is....I wish to have its child. Amazing. As per usual with Epi readers, I made a few tweaks. To get the carb-count down, I used sherry instead of mirin (and in fact subbed sherry for the white wine as well, since I didn't want to open a whole bottle for two tablespoons-full). I omitted the flour, and seared the scallops naked but for salt and pepper. And instead of parmesan, I sprinkled the dish with some toasted sunflower seeds. Strong men would have wept, had there been any around. Lacking strong men, I just slurped up the sauce. Which, by the by, makes enough for a good pound and a half of scallops. Fabulous stuff. Make this recipe.

I made this with sea scallops and standard brown miso and followed everything. I think the sauce overpowered the scallops a little - I think it would go better with little bay scallops and watercress on crostini as an appetizer than with sea scallops. Next time I'll try it with a light miso - a sweet white or at least a golden miso since that may make the sauce more subtle.

Delicious! Made as specified, but served over cress and brown short grain rice for a meal (for 2). A keeper.

This has become my new favorite scallops recipe - primarily because it has a little less fat (and a more healthy one) than my previous favorite which used bacon fat to sear the scallops and, as others have mentioned, use something lighter other than heavy cream. The mirin-miso sauce is a wonderful compliment to the scallops and you could probably serve this over whatever you like - I used arugula as that was the bitter green that I had in the house, but I think you could use pasta, other greens or even fresh green beans. I also like that it was fairly quick and easy for an evening weekday meal.

I made this recipe using sea scallops with a few adjustments and it came out excceptionally well. First off, I didn't place the scallops over watercress. I served it as the main course to dinner with 3 side dishes. I didn't use any sugar; and instead of heavy cream used non-fat milk! Despite those changes, the sauce was rich and creamy (wine, mirin, miso can do that) though I tasted the whole grain mustard more than any other flavor in the sauce (detracting from the recipe's asian roots I'd say.) Also, it was fantastic as leftovers, providing you use fresh scallops to begin with.

It was absolutely delicious with a bold flavor. I couldn't find watercress, and tore up some spinach instead. It worked out really well.

This is awesome and easy. Everyone raved about it at a dinner party. I've made it three times since..what else can you make in less than 15 min. Definately use dry scallops for pan searing.

Simply delicious! The sauce is perfect over pasta, too!

Very bold for scallops. The sauce has a nutty, rich flavor and is quite heavy and certainly delicious. It should be toned down by placing over rice instead of greens, however I will make this again.

I tried adding rice vinegar for half the wine, went heavy on the garlic (we like garlic) and added some minced ginger (we like ginger too). It's a very good sauce. I used the same on fried tofu and my vegetarian daughter thought it was excellent with that also. Adding chopped shallots also sounds like a good enhancement.

very simple, very rich. the sauce needs something to cut the richness--next time, I think I'd use rice vinegar instead of half the wine, and I'd add some shallots and ginger to wake it up.
