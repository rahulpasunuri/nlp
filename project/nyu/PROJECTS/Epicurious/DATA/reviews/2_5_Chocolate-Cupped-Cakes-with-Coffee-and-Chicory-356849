These looked great coming out of the oven, very rustic looking. However, they were completely dry, not gooey at all and I didn't get any of the chicory or espresso flavor at all. I would not serve this to anyone.

I was surprised by the previous review. I am challenged by anything needing to be baked, but I thought this could be easy.It is all in a cup and not to worry if it did not look pretty. Knowing it is just not a pudding but it is a cake so that means time in the oven... and time! It was a winner as the flavor of chocolate and coffee were GREAT! I thought I would be turned off by the Chicory but it did not over power the flavor. I actually tried all the recipes listed and went out and purchased the cookbook. Nice stories to think about when cooking these desserts which are not hard at all.

I'm a good cook and everything about this recipe said "Whoa" to me. A souffle-like dessert without eggs? A pudding that requires 55 minutes in the oven? Bottomline: I should have paid attention to the red flags. This was perhaps the WORST recipe I have ever made. The entire thing went into the garbage. Thank God that I wasn't planning to serve it to guests.
