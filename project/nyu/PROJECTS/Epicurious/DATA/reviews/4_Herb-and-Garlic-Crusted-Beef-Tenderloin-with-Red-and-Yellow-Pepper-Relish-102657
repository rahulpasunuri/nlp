I am looking for a simple beef recipe that can be made ahead of time. I need to finish cooking the tenderloin at 4pm and bring to a holiday party to be served at 7pm. Would this recipe work? Other suggestions are welcome.

FANTASTIC beef tenderloin recipe. I did not make the pepper relish and it absolutely was not needed. I had mistakenly seared the beef with the mustard and herbs already rubbed on it and it still worked beautifully. The meat was very tender and juicy in every bite - the herbed crust was a wonderful accent. Everyone raved about it and it was quite simple to make.

I first made this years ago for a client's dinner party sans the relish. When tenderloin roasts go on sale for $4.99 a pound, I buy them and make this for us. It's a good recipe and my family loves it. You will not get a crust on this unless you roast high heat (425) for a shorter time, hence browning in the pan first. I do not brown it first; I have been using the convection roast with probe set at 130 and it comes out great. No sauce needed. It is simple and a great Sunday dinner at our house.

I've made this for Christmas Eve dinner several times and it's a HUGE hit each time. I've never made the pepper relish. Instead I serve it with either the previously mentioned mustard horseradish sauce or a demi-glace (which I think is my favorite). I came up with the demi-glace as a combination of this recipe and the Christmas Chateaubriand recipe from this site. Here's what I do: Cook 4 slices of bacon (chopped) and remove from pan leaving 2T of fat. Brown the meat in the remaining fat. I remove the meat and continue with the recipe as written (though I take it out at 115 degrees and let it rest to get to medium rare). For the demi-glace, I add 1 cup of red wine to the pan I browned the meat in (scrape up any bits), add the cooked bacon from above and 2t chopped fresh rosemary. I let this boil (maybe 10 minutes?). Then I remove the bacon and add 1 finely chopped red bell pepper and about 1 1/2 cups beef or veal demi-glace. I let this boil down until I like it (usually to about 1 1/2 cups). This year I plan to serve with roasted vegetables (carrots, turnips, parsnips, onions, and beets tossed in olive oil, salt, and pepper) and peas (probably a variation of the Peas with Bacon and Dill from Gourmet's June 2005 issue). I think the presentation with the red from the beets and peppers and green from the peas will look beautiful for the occasion. I would add potatoes to the roasted vegetables, but I'm serving the Petatou de Chevre as a starter (another outstanding recipe from Park Bistro in NYC - You Asked For It in Gourmet Feb 1996).

I made this recipe for a dinner party for friends. Everybody loved it. I didn't do the pepper relish, instead I made mushroom sauce, green beans and mashed potatoes. I marinated the beef overnight. It's hard to find a recipe that's easy and everybody loves it, but this is IT!

it was just ok. I thought the rosemary was a little overpowering for this cut of beef. Might be better with a strip roast. I doubt I'll make this again.

I made this for the first time on Christmas Day and it was out of this world!! My guests loved it. I did not make the pepper relish but served it with the mustard-horseradish sauce also found in this issue. I served it with green beans with carmelized shallots (Bon Appetit, 12/06), oven roasted ratatouille, and two cheese potato gratin (Cooking Light, March 1999--also excellent) and corn pudding. My daughter has already requested this recipe for her birthday dinner on January 2nd!! Thank you for a great holiday meal!!

Ah-may-zing Christmas dinner! I lucked out and found tenderloin dirt cheap at the market. Smelled/tasted heavenly and it was soooo tender. I regret taking it out a few minutes earlier than stipulated because it was a little too rare (even though my thermometer said 125?!?) Husband loved it though!

WOW!! I made this for Christmas dinner last night and there was not one piece left over -- even my picky little nephew wanted more. Instead of using two smaller tenderloins, I used half of a 6-pound tenderloin purchased at Costco. As other reviewers suggested, I did the initial preparation of browning and covering the roast with the mustard and herbs in the morning, then covered it with Saran wrap and refrigerated it until later in the day, when I removed it from the fridge about forty minutes before I put it in the oven. I roasted it at 375 until the meat thermometer read 120 degrees, as stated in the recipe. I did not make the pepper relish, but instead made the mustard-horseradish sauce also found on the epicurious website. As most other reviewers did, I served it with the balsamic roasted onions (also from epicurious), garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans. I'm not kidding -- every plate was scraped clean. Will make it again and again!

Rating: 4
Made this for Christmas dinner - it was great! Did all the work the day before and wrapped in saran wrap. I used two 3-1/2 lbs. tenderloins for 16 people, and cooked for 45 minutes. It came out medium rare in the middle - such a relief because my new digital thermometer didn't work! Served with mustard horeseradish sauce (didn't need it) and balsamic roasted onions (delicious). Definitely a do-over.

Rating: 2
It was good but not amazing. Beef tenderloin is delicious but expensive and doesn't need alot of added ingredients. In future I would just rub on some olive oil, salt and pepper and roast until medium rare. Serve with a potato gratin, some french green beans and a bottle of cab! Delcious and simple...

Rating: 3
Most guests didn't even eat the sauce with theirs, and I made the mustard horseradish sauce instead of the relish. (The sauce is great.) Don't overcook the meat! Medium rare on a great piece of meat is the way to go. Good dinner for company. (I'd give it 3 1/2 if I could.)

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I made it for Christmas dinner using a sirloin roast instead. I skipped the relish and made horseradish sauce, horseradish mashed pototoes w/ caramelized onions, roasted root vegetables, and the peppermint ice cream pie(all from this site). I was a star!

Rating: 1
Based on all the reviews I didn't see how this one could miss. I was hoping the herb and garlic crust, along with substituting a highly-rated mustard horseradish sauce from this site, would be just the ticket, since beef tenderloin needs all the help it can get. Unfortunately, when you love smoked-roasted meats and barbecue by far over oven-roasted almost anything, you shouldn't expect to be wowed even with a dish like this one. Live and learn, I suppose. Glad others liked it.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved! We served it with the balsamic onions and spinach gratin recipes that are in Epicurious, and it was a truly fabulous meal.

Made this for our Christmas dinner and it was yummy! Served it with the Super Spinach Salad, Gratin of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Balsamic Roasted Onions, Baby Carrots with Tarragon, and Black and White Baked Alaska.....all Epicurious recipes. Had doubts about the relish so I also made the Madeira Sauce I served last year with the Roast Prime Rib with Madeira Sauce (Epicurious). I think I like the Madeira sauce more. Seems a much more fitting accompaniement for this elegant beef rather than the relish. Bought my tenderloin at Costco and the meat was delicious! Everyone said all the dishes were excellent. I smugly said, "of course, they're all 4 forkers!". I explained what that meant. My 6 yr. old granddaughter said "grandma, this is a 5 forker!!". Can't get any better than that.

I have made this for Christmas 2 years in a row now. Huge hit! So tender and delicious. I use a meat thermometer for medium rare at 125 internal temp, and it is perfect every time. I serve with mustard-horseradish sauce on epicurious; easy and can prepare day ahead.

Made this for Xmas 2 years ago and am making it again this year. Elegant entree that makes entertaining a crowd easy. Was delicious with the relish and balsamic onions in same issue.

Made this several years sgo - everyone loved Christmas Dinner. I do a tenderloin every year. Alwasy pay only #.00 - 4.99 a pound in Connecticut for the best tenderloin. You can improvice on the relish and the crust, but it's delicious with both. It's a short cooking time for tenderloin - for med. rare - don't use other meats.. this is so tender it melts in your mouth! I can't wait for this year's dinner at my mother-in-laws house where I am the gourmet cook for the family.

Delicious. I had one 3lb. tenderloin which I cooked at 450F for 30 minutes. It came out perfectly medium rare. Deglazed the pan drippings (I used butter to sear the meat) with Brandy and poured this over the meat slices. The relish is excellent, too, but I would make this dish again even without it.

One of my family's favorite recipes. Love the relish, it's hard to keep it from being eaten the night before we serve the roast, I always have to double the recipe.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe, along with the entire Christmas dinner from the December 1999 Bon Appetit issue, the last 4 years (I have to triple the soup recipe and double all the rest). The tenderloin and the dinner remain a huge hit with all my family and friends. The relish is outstanding and great with other meats also. "Crust" may not be the correct word because the meat is not crusty. I tend to follow recipes exactly the first time and make changes later. The only thing I changed was the relish - I dice the onion instead of using rings. We would highly recommend this tenderloin.

Rating: 3
The crust makes this recipe and could be used on a lot of other meats. Since the recipe calls for a relatively quick cooking time, you really can't use the tough cuts of beef (like I did). I'll try this one again with tenderloin.

I made this for our neighborhood progressive dinner party (24 people) it was a big hit. Next time I will cook it just a few minutes longer so there will be more medium servings.

This is not the best preparation of tenderloin I've made. The coating really doesn't form a crust due to the relatively low roasting temp, which was disappointing. The relish was truly awful, I made it, tasted it, then threw it out and made the horseradish mustard sauce from this site as many others recommended. The sauce was really tasty and a good accompaniment. Thanks to those who recommended it. Next time, I would choose a recipe with a higher roasting temp to get that seared outside-tender inside effect. Also, tenderloing doesn't need so much fuss, maybe just some cracked black peppercorns, salt, and a bit of herbs.

Delicious! My husband proclaimed it the best filet he'd ever had. I didn't make the relish, as I thought the crust would give it enough flavor, and it was so tender the jus was sauce enough.

Maybe.... We made this for 6 people on Christmas Eve...the tenderloin was $19.99 per pound at Whole Foods and dinner ended up costing us almost $150 all said and done. I think for the price we could have done something more inventive; however the beef was very good.

Excellent. I paid close attention to the time recommended and it came out a perfect medium rare. My only mistake is that I did not prep until after the guests arrived and it took longer than I thought it would--silly me.

This was great. The only thing I think I did different from the recipe's instructions, however, was to combine the mustard with the other coating ingredients.

This is the recipe I will always use for tenderloin.

Made this for a dinner party to rave reviews and requests for "seconds." My husband said it was so good, people wept. I served it with a bordelais sauce and the balsamic braised onions. It was a lot of work to peel the onions but worth it. I tried the onion recipe again later with frozen onions but they were tough and not as flavorful as the fresh onions.

I've now made this twice - once with the pepper relish and once using a mustard horseradish sauce instead as suggested by an earlier reviewer. Both were excellent. The second time, I deglazed the browning pan with a little red wine and mixed the reduction with the mustard for the glaze and will definitely do that in the future as well.

Made this for a family Christmas Eve dinner and it was a real hit! Roasted in my convetion oven @ 350 and obtained a delicious external apperance and flavor. 125 degrees (measured with oven's temp probe) was a bit well done for our tastes after resting 10 minutes, I'd go to 115 or 120 next time. Served dijon mustard/horseradish sauce with it IPO the pepper relish with good results. Liked the other reviewer's tip about preparing the tenderloin for roasting the night before and wrapping in Saran wrap until ready to roast. Not only delicious, but a snap to cook and serve while entertaining that way.

Came out looking like the picture. Made it for a preholiday dinner, and it was marvelous. Everyone raved. The relish was a nice touch, but the onions and beans really added the last touch. Perfect rare. Warmed oven at 450l and cooked meat at 325 until thermometer said 130. Wonderful.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, I WILL make it again, and can hardly wait to make it for my friends.

Made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner. The tenderloin was expensive, but worth it. I would probably cook it a few minutes longer next time - 125 was too rare for some of my guests - maybe I'd go to 130. Delicious, especially with the recipe for roasted onions.

Wow, what a birthday feast I had with this! My husband, who is kitchen illiterate, made this with ease! We didn't bother with the relish per suggestions, and we didn't miss it! Make sure you check the temperature early or put a thermometer in for the entire course, because we only cooked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect. Maille Old Style Dijon works very very well for this, as it is not runny like some others. After the other reviews, I am glad I (a meat lover) don't live up north--$6.99 a pound didn't break my bank at all.

Incredibly good...and evidently 'idiot-proof' because now that I've re-read the recipe, I see that I messed it up. *laughing* I forgot to add the additional olive oil to the garlic and fresh herbs. *shrug* Still tasted great. I let it reach a temperature of 130, which might have been a bit overdone. I like my meat pink but not bloody. *plah* And hey!! - somebody might have told me that beef tenderloin costs nearly $30 a pound!! I paid $45 and change for a pound and a half and a wee bit. But don't let that deter you. It's a great recipe and I'll probably serve it again at a dinner party I'm having in three weeks time. Call me Miz Moneybags...*laughing*

Halved the recipe and made it for 5 people, using 2 3/4 lb of tenderloin. The relish adds a nice touch and it works very well with the roasted red onion and "Gratin Of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Bacon And Arugula". As with all roasts, it's easy to overcook in areas where the meat is not uniformly thick.

I almost backed out when I saw the price of Beef Tenderloin but I had no better option for Christmas dinner...I am soooo glad I did it! My family could not stop raving! Based on the reviews of others, I didn't bother with the pepper relish; I complimented the beef with Roasted Root Vegetables,Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Herbs de Provence, and simple steamed green beans. Best meal I've ever made! Everyone loved it! Just a warning - when they say use a non-stick frying pan, they mean it! I only had one so I used a regular pan for the other piece of meat (actually I made three small roasts); my whole house was filled with smoke when I pan-seared the meat. I don't see why you can't use the same pan over again instead of two simultaneously.

B/c I did not make the relish, I can only say how great the crusted meat was! Terrific! First time for a tenderloin for me so I baked as suggested by a friend in a 500 degree oven for 15 minutes(5 mins. per pound) and then turned off oven and left door closed for 1 hour. Let sit for 20 minutes, tented under foil. Perfectly cooked. I used a horseradish-Dijon cream sauce along side and it was outstanding with the herb and garlic crust on the meat. Do not hesitate to try this!

I made this for Christmas and used a 5 1/3 lb tenderloin instead of two smaller ones. I was very pleased withthe results and my family said they couldn't have eaten better than if they were at a fine dining restaurant. Took it out at 120 and let it rest - was cooked to perfection!

I made this with a New York steak roast instead of tenderloin and even though I unintentionally overcooked it, it was still absolutely delicious. I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Honey Mustard instead of dijon and it added just the right hint of sweetness.

I'm not sure if the person who used the dried herbs in lieu of the fresh used the amounts listed in this recipe, but if she/he did, it would surely be too much. If using dried herbs (not nearly as tasty as fresh) halve the quantity called for, at least. Dried herbs have a far more potent flavor.

I did not have fresh thyme or rosemary and used dried. It was too overpowering. It was also too done for me. The directions I have for another recipe is preheat oven to 425 degrees. Adjust to 350 and bake for 45 minutes. This usually gives me a nice pink center. The relish was great. I added a can of black beans (well rinsed) just before serving. The leftover relish was served the next day with scrambled eggs. I thought the relish was quite colorful.

Although it looked almost bloody when I first sliced into it, it continued to cook and was almost well done by the time I finished slicing the roast. I would cut about five minutes off the cooking time next time around. It was really easy to make. I didn't do the pepper relish. Instead, I made the merlot sauce and the whole thing got rave reviews from my guests.

Excellent recipe amd it was a major hit for Christmas dinner, however I would suggest less dijon mustard than the receipe called for (maybe 4 tablespoons) and I found it took longer than the 45 minutes for medium rare. Although it is a very expensive dinner it is well worth the money.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner 1999 and 2000. My family loves it! It is quick and easy and delicious. We added twice-baked potatoes to the menu and it was great!

My guests raved on and on about this dish, which turned out as promised, crusty on the outside and soft and juicy inside. It was tasty without disguising the meat flavour. I used argentinian tenderloin, the best beef ever.

This was the hit of Christmas dinner. Easier to make than expected. The leftovers were even better as you could really start to smell and taste the flavor of all the herbs and garlic. Definitely keep to the 130 in the temperature check. Perfect medium rare. So tender and wonderful.

I really enjoyed this dish and the crowd for Christmas raved. Two notes: (1) beef tenderloin ran about $11/lb at my grocery, though about $8.50/lb at Costco... be prepared for the experience of buying a $50 piece of meat, and (2) 45 minutes/125 had my thick piece raw in the middle, though the thinner pieces were fantastic at this point.

Wow.. what more can I say. Try the Balsamic Onions and the Potatos Gratin with Arugala and Bacon. I have made this dish at least 4 times and people love it..

This dish was fantastic. This was my first attempt at beef tenderloin and I was very happy with the results. Everyone raved about the meat and I will definitely make it again for a special occasion. I found that it took a little longer than 45 minutes for medium rare. I also thought that 125 degrees was extremely rare. Either something is wrong with my thermometer or my idea of medium rare is a little more well done. In any case even the well done end was tender and flavorful.

Great tasting easy recipe. We cooked ours to 130 to please those who wanted it a little more well done. Still plenty of med.rare meat in the middle for the rest. Got an ovation. Will definitely be making this again.

This is so good! I've made it two times already and will make it again. Those of you who are looking for grilled or sauteed onions, this recipe was printed in December 2000 issue of B.A. with recipe for roasted balsamic red onions. They are excellent also.

The entire Family loved this dinner, and it was very easy to prepare. Instead of only using the thick end of the loin, I took the small end and bent it back over itself. Then i tied it like a rolled roast then browned it and preceded on with the recipe. Since nobody liked the peppers, I didn't even try. The only thing about this recipe that was puzzling was the 125 degrees for medium rare. Beef cooked to rare is generally cooked to 140 degrees. I cooked this roast to 135 degrees, then took it out and allowed it to rest. The internal temp rose to 144 degrees(medium rare)

Like other viewers suggested, we decided to forego the R&Y Pepper relish. Good choice. We also followed another viewer's suggested to sear on the grill first & then cook in (an aluminum) pan using indirect (real charcoal!) heat. We sauteed some sliced mushrooms in butter & Teriyaki sauce to serve with the tenderloin. This was an incredible recipe! We served the French Onion Soup (Bon Appetit, April 1993) as an appetizer which was also delicious! Outstanding!

I wish I had read the reviews prior to preparing this dish. The tenderloin was outstanding. The relish sounded as though it would be great, but was very unappetizing looking. Simple grilled/sauteed onions would be easier and more appealing.

This is TO DIE FOR and it's really, really easy. It has to be one of the top five meals I ever made, or possibly ever eaten. I seared it on the grill on high heat, then cooked it on a pan on the grill with indirect heat. The first time I had this was when my cousins brought the recipee for a special family dinner and everyone loved it. You can't go wrong with this. The left over relish is great on bread. In fact, I'd make that alone as an appetizer.

I have made this dish many times and everyone raves about it. It is also wonderful the next day for sandwiches if there is any left. Wonderful for a party but skip the relish.

Easy and delicous Christmas dinner entree. I would make this again!

Really outstanding, despite the expense. A true show-stopper. The relish was reasonably tasty but not as attractive as I would have liked - and there was too much of it.

You want to impress the in-laws? THIS is the main dish (although extremely expensive). I made this on Christmas for my in-laws and now they want me over every year. Two suggestions.....forget the relish, and you can never have too much garlic. EXCELLENT.

I cooked Christmas dinner for 7, and this was the main dish. The meat was excellent, everyone raved. This is especially noteworthy because most did not want to stray from trad. turkey. They all loved it. The Pepper relish on the other hand, while tasty, was not met with enthusiasm. The balsamic carmelized onions that I prepared with the meal complimented the tenderloin much better than the pepper relish. I had a lot left over that I eventually had to discard.

Made this for a friend's birthday. The meat cost $117 Canadian, but was delicious. The pepper relish I threw out. I found it very unappetizing. My husband said he would have liked a bit of horseradish sauce with the meat.

I made this for a holiday dinner party last night. It was divine--and so easy! I made the pepper relish and also a mustard horseradish sauce. I think the mustard horseradish sauce was superior to the pepper relish as an accompaniment. I can say that the meat was fabulous with or without the mustard sauce. Can't wait for leftovers this evening!

This was outrageously good. My guests loved it. I did not make the pepper relish. I just served the roast plain. No one seemed to miss it, and no one asked for steak sauce, gravy, etc.
