This does NOT look like Rouille. What it looks like is a restaurant facsimilie that can be made ahead of time and does not include raw egg. This is a recipie for real rouille: Rouille: 2 egg yolks 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon anise flavored liqueur, such as Pernod 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 small dried chile pepper 1 pinch saffron 2 teaspoons olive oil Put all ingredients (except olive oil) in a blender and whip at low speed until smooth. Slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream, forming a mayonnaise-like emulsion. Serve in a small bowl.

I used a submersable blender to mix it all at once and it was great. I am always looking for short cuts.

I liked it, but I used my imersable blender to chop and blend it all at once. I admit that it's a shortcut that may upset the true to recipe peeps, but it works.

Looks more like aioli to me: rouille is supposed to be orange in colour (*rouille* in French means *rust*) while there's nothing among the ingredients able to give it that colour. Saffron is missing as well. A good dip but definitely not a rouille!
