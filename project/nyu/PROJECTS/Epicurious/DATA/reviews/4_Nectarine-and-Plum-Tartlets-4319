I also made this into one big tart instead of individual tarts. I used white nectarines and rasberry dinosaur- egg plums. Baking time was longer, obviously, but it was worth the wait. Very good recipe - juicy and fresh.

Easy and delicious. My s/o worked out the math to convert from the 6 small tartlet pans to one large and said an 11" would be perfect. So used my closest...10 1/2". Forgot to put on the plum jelly glaze, but it was still beautiful; my guests raved and asked for seconds. I'm sure the jam and berries would have futher enhanced the experience.

Voted Best Dessert Pie at my National Pie Day dinner (okay, it was just an excuse to make pies), this was pretty and delicious. I made it as one tart using a rectangular tart pan, and it earned rave reviews.

This recipe was a pleasure to make and yielded a very professional-looking product. The instructions were clear and the quantities worked out perfectly. Dividing the pastry dough into 6 disks before chilling resulted in exactly the right size portion for each tartlet pan. I garnished the tarts with additional blackberries and served each one on a large plate liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar and trimmed with purple pansies and fresh mint. One guest said,"Too pretty to eat!" and then proceeded to demolish hers. All in all, a delightful late summer dessert.
