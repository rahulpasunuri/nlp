This soup was nice but not great. A bit too sweet. The lobster gets lost.

I am surprised by all of the raving reviews. I found this to be an extremely mediocre soup and would not make it again. The lobster was a nice visual garnish but did not add to the flavor at all. A shame to waste lobster like that!!!

I agree... this was definiteley the most expensive soup I've ever made. The reaction I got from guests at my dinner party was well worth the cost!

An elegant winter first course. REALLY rich, intense, and satisfying, therefore, I would not serve too much of it per person. Would make an excellent amuse too. To "delute" the intensity, thin the soup more w/ broth. Overall, an great dish w/ minimal fuss.

Recipe was OK, but I expected more flavor. I made this soup twice for parties of 14 and 20. I used fresh chestnuts and found peeling them to be too time consuming.

I have decided that one "agog" equals two forks. I served this last evening to five dinner guests. Two "agogs" later, plus a few "ohs" plus the previous two "agogs" add up to four "agogs" which, in turn, equal 8 forks...which is the appropriate rating for this recipe. Very rich! Very good! Very expensive! I used just-harvested chestnuts purchased on line from Delmarvelous Chestnuts.Their website address is www.buychestnuts.com. Good people. Easy to do business with. Best of all, the nuts were delivered on the day they said. "Bestest" of all was that the nuts were in perfect condition...no mold or rot.

The other reviewer was dead on...my guests were AGOG. This is outrageously good, and expensive as it gets...oh MY. I used dry sherry...

What type of Madeira did you use? Dry or sweet? I'd like to make this but I don't want to ruin an expensive dish.
