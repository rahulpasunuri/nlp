I actually made this directly from the directions in the Gourmet magazine from my public library. Love it. I personally like to add just a bit more wine and we always make a double recipe. We have substituted the Manchego/Gruyere for Mozzarella... it worked but it didn't have the exquiste quality the other's did. My mother told me that the first time she had French Onion soup that it melted in her mouth, she hated onions at the time but loved this dish. Also we didn't have a working broiler however we ladled a bit of the broth over the cheese and it melted nicely. This is the kind of soup that takes me right back to France. Especially when we have a baguette, even though the American ones are much heavier, I think the real ones might be too light for this delightful recipe.

Really good! Was worried half-way thru after initial taste testing, but once you get it all together with the manchego and bread, it is great. A little more delicate than the traditional french onion, but we both liked it and will make again.

Why mess with a good thing? This may taste good to some people and that is fine, but don't call it French Onion Soup - that great name is reserved for the original great soup. This is just plain silly, like a recipe I saw recently that included apricots in a beef dish,

I think this is a great change from the classic, and a really atypical but pleasant flavor combination. I left the stock to steep with the anise for longer than recommended, and did not think it was too strong. I also appreciate how quick this recipe is compared to many french onion soups. However, I did have a few pieces of onion that were a little leathery feeling still, probably because the outer layers of red onion can be a little thick. So I'd say be generous with the number of outer layers you peel off.

i think this is a good soup but as jerry springer would say it looks like slugs drowning

This is way more delicate than a classic french onion soup. I am glad that I used the star anise. It adds a nice complexity.

This soup is a nice twist on the French classic. The anise seeds create an interesting flavor. Very easy to make, nice for a middle of the week lunch or quick dinner. I would say that the Manchego cheese is an integral part to using the anise in the recipe, I don't think Gruyere would have worked as well.

We loved the flavors and delicacy of this recipe. However, I think the proportion of chicken stock to water should be 2/3 to 1/3.

I really enjoyed this soup. It was quick and easy to make. I was out of star anise, so I used caraway seed. I also replaced the chicken broth with a vegetarian broth called "not chick'n" which worked out nicely.

Blechhh. This is a completely different kind of soup. Stick with the classic french onion soup. Beef stock, white or yellow onions, french bread croutons and cheese. It's a no- brainer. Rich and tasty.

I was really anticipating this soup, and maybe that's why I was disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly impressive either. The anise was slightly too strong - one would have been enough. I may play off this recipe or explore other options next time I want French Onion Soup.

This was so good my family asked if i would put it on our weekday menu. Although i thought it was a little labor intensive, it is worth it. Kudos on this one.

Uninteresting. I will stick with more complex versions.

Big Hit at the dinner party! I have been looking for a good onion soup recipe for a long time. This is a keeper - we substituted vegetable broth and it was great.

Delicious! I made this last-minute, so used anise seed instead of star anise, and it was still VERY good. I also went with the Low Budget/Low Calorie Version, omitting the bread & cheese (I know, I know) but still FANTASTIC. Next time I'll double it, though.

Very easy and fast. I used only 1 star anise but I it would benefit from using both. Subtle sweetness goes well with the salty nature of the cheese.
