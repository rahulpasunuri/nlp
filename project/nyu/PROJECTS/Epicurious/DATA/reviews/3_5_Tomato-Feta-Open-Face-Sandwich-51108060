Very good as written. I ran out of feta and had one more to make so I used goat cheese, that was tasty as well!

This recipe was simple and quick! I love anything that has feta in it. Simple ingredients, healthy and filling too.

I am lucky enough to be the beneficiary of heirloom tomatoes from my neighbor's garden so it's hard to go wrong with this simple but wonderful recipe. I, too, used good whole grain bread, rubbed the toasted bread with fresh garlic and used French feta which I find creamier and more flavorful. This recipe captures the essence of summer!

it works with fresh sliced mozzarella as well...a little milder...

I'm sure I would give this recipe 4 forks if I could find some truly flavorful tomatoes. I tried Campari tomatoes that were firm and dark red but was disappointed in the lack of flavor. Next I tried Texas "best flavor" organically grown tomatoes and they were completely flavorless. But with the fresh ground sea salt and black pepper, along with lemon infused olive oil, fresh oregano leaves, and the sliced fresh feta cheese, it made a wonderful combination of flavors. I used 8-grain ciabatta rolls sliced and lightly toasted which worked great. The second time I made them I added sliced avocado which was very good.

This takes about 5 minutes to put together, and if you use good quality fresh heirloom tomatoes and feta - simply outstanding!

I am constantly amazed at the number of simplistic recipes epicurious posts and like most, this one has great flavor combinations. I did, however, make some changes. I used a crispy multigtain baguette and added chopped olives to the tomato topping, then placed in a hot oven for 5 minutes. This brought out the flavors and was much more tasty than plain old toasted white bread. Now I can give it 4 forks!

I also like to first rub a fresh-cut garlic clove on the toasted bread, with the warm bread taking in the garlic taste and smell, followed by the tomato, basil and feta, if using.
