Great. Like others recommended I used 1/2 the olive oil and cut the salt back since I knew my clams were a bit salty. So easy and yummy!

Fab, love this recipe. Took a few suggestions like halving the olive oil (and I still thought it was a tad oily, so 1 cup would be WAY too much for me). Lots more garlic. Lots. Used fresh thyme and sage (b/c I had it). Used red pepper powder (b/c I didn't have it) but go easy b/c it can get too spicy, then added Chipotle Chile flakes. Replaced about 1/2 tsp of the kosher salt w/ smoked salt. Finally, replaced half the water w/ more white wine for a tad more flavor. Served w/ whole wheat sourdough. Amazing, this is a SIMPLE staple. Great summer deck dish.

Halved the recipe with about three pounds of littleneck clams. Excellent. Would make following changes in future recipes, would make again in a heartbeat...Easy, tasty, simple: -Reduce olive oil by about half, fairly oily at recipe ratios. -Reduce water by about half -Increase white wine by about half for more flavor -Increase red pepper flakes and sea salt a little while -Lightly boil sauce for a few minutes before adding clams to allow flavors to meld and reach appropriate cooking temp for liquids as well as burn off alcohol from wine.

This is my favorite new recipe of 2007 so far. I've made it about 7 times since discovering it this sprint, and it's always a hit.

this was good simple way to eat clams. I added a ton of more garlic and used sage since that is what I had handy and it was really good. I am freezing leftover and will try to make it as a base for pasta when I thaw.

This was easy and delicious. I plan to thicken the broth a bit, add some canned clams, and serve it over pasta later this week! Broth is too good to waste!
