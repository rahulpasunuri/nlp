The "dressing" is the balsamic vinegar and the oil from the tuna. So no, nothing is missing from yhe recipe. ;)

I took the suggestion of another and added minced onion and celery. This probably made it a little tastier and gave it more texture, but I'm sure it would be very good even exactly as written. (Oh and I never buy tuna in oil so I added olive oil)

Blah...better uses for an avocado...and better uses for tuna. The flavors did not compliment each other as much as flavors should!

I don't understand why people aren't getting that when you mix the oil from the tuna and the basalmic vinager, that is the dressing. Haven't you heard of oil and vinager dressing?

I am always looking for simple, simple recipes and this was a good way for me to jazz up a can of tuna. This was great, and delicious!

To answer the dressing question: the dressing is the oil from the tuna, vinegar, and salt and pepper. This is a very good, simple dish. A basic and standard way to serve canned tuna. Buy the highest quality tuna you can afford as it does make a difference. Make sure your avocados are firm/ripe. And forget adding anything extra. This recipe is what it is. And it's good as is. If you want a "tuna salad" instead, then make a tuna salad and forget this recipe. This recipe is for purist's, as it were, who appreciate the taste and simplicity of recipes that offer the palate an engaging respite from the "gourmet" experience.

There's no recipie for the dressing. What type of dressing is this recipie referring to?

I must admit, I made the recipe with alterations of my own, as follows. A. Water-packed solid fancy white albacore tuna (Avocado is a pricey ingredient whose taste shouldn't be ruined by the use of cheap tuna packed in oil that would carry the strong residue of tuna into the dressing) B. I added the following roughly chopped ingredients: 4 young scallions, 1/4 cup celery (tender inside shoots & a few leaves), 2 tbsp parsley fresh from my garden, and 1/2 of a small yellow onion. C. I modified the "dressing" recipe by using a well seasoned olive-oil-vinegar-and-herb dressing (my own "secret" recipe). D. I topped the whole presentation off by tossing a few tbsp of fresh alfalfa sprouts into the mix, and by serving it on an elegant salad plate with only a clear sparkling water in accompaniment. DIABETICS TAKE NOTE: I am Type II Diabetic managing my condition with diet only, and the recipe I have prepared is well within the parameters of healty eating for Type II Diabetes.

There seems to be something missing from the ingredients...like the dressing?
