My daughter and I just made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit: 30 min from start to eating. Yay!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, just upped the spinach and served with a side of fresh marinara just in case it didn't have a lot of flavor. It was my first time poaching chicken like this and because I was trying to cook to temperature, not time, think it was probably over done. Still, very healthy and very tasty. Was great with the marinara, but would have held its own without. I double wrapped with plastic -- first as directed and then again length-wise just to be safe. Had no problems with leaks or explosions. Will definitely make again with different fillings for sure. Had

So I had to make a last minute change as my goat cheese was bad. Used swiss instead plus added prociutto. I really like the plastic wrap/poaching method, especially for dinner parties. Much easier than sauteeing, baking, etc with guests there. I had no issue with the platic wrap, use an extra long piece and wrap, then tie them. Worked great and didn't melt at all. I'll use this method for stuffed chicken often

Recipe was tasty and looked impressive. I anticipated trouble with the plastic wrap melting in contact with bottom of pot, so immersed wrapped breasts in a big ziploc filled with hot water. Even so, they both melted at contact points with the pot bottom, but the double wrapping preserved their shape and limited dissolution of stuffing. Perhaps an advisory would help that heat-resistent plastic wrap is in order. Surely would not have this problem with foil. Maybe a foil papillote around the wrapped breasts next time. Will try again.

This was very good! I followed the instructions exactly (but used pre-washed baby spinach). The trick with the plastic wrap is making sure its tight around the chicken, with little to no air pockets. When twisting the ends, keep twisting until the it starts to twist upon itself (if that makes sense)...just twist the heck out of it. And letting it sit for 5 min is very important as to not dry out the chicken. This was an excellent low fat and quick technique that I look forward to trying again with a different stuffing.

I used foil,wrap and foil, just to make sure.I stuffed with feta and wrapped in bacon and quick fryed it to give colour.Yummy and much of the work can be done in advance.Great dinner party recipe and looks impressive.

I added nutmeg to spinach & used shallots instead of garlic. My husband does like meat without color so I seared on stovetop & finished it in the oven. Will make again with my changes. Enjoy.

Chicken didn't last past 7 minutes in the plastic wrap. Came undone and the result was a mess of diluted goat cheese and soggy uncooked chicken. Had to pitch it. I'm sure that securing the chicken in a sturdy Ziploc bag would be the better option.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I found it to be bland and the chicken was not tender. It was a lot of work for a disappointing result. Darn!

Does the plastic retain the flavor inside? I think of water as making things taste bland. Excited to try this one. Not a fan of goat cheese so hoping feta might also be good. more to come!

we used tinfoil instead of plastic wrap, not out of any dogma, but because that's what we had in the kitchen. It works just fine. I liked this recipe as is well enough, with some reservations. For me, it was an accomplishment just to say I had stuffed something other than a turkey, and poached it, so the recipe was a great start. Kind of like "hello world" of poaching and stuffing. However, I am really looking forward to trying all the other tasty sounding ways of cooking it next time, and trying different fillings.

THE PLASTIC BURST!!! I endeavored to follow the directions exactly, but two things went wrong. 1) The plastic burst after 5 minutes. 2) The breasts were too thick at 1/2" and didn't roll nicely. I even tied a knot in the plastic so it wouldn't unroll-- maybe that made it burst open. I tried to rescue it even tho it was soggy and the flavor washed away. We ate it anyhow.

The idea that the bad smell of burning plastic means it's toxic is ridiculous. Burning hair smells bad too but it doesn't give you cancer. Also note, the plastic isn't being exposed directly to fire - it's heated in water - completely different methods from the point of view of chemistry. This is a simple recipe with a million possible variations - plus it's quick and easy to clean up. Try it!

Thanks to other reviews, this recipe was GREAT! I added roasted peppers instead of sun dried tomatoes - great w/ the spinach & goat cheese. Although I'm not afraid to poach in plastic, I chose to heat olive oil & garlic and brown the chicken, then I basted it in the oven w/ chicken broth - very moist & flavorful! Another hint: prepare the recipe the night before, wrap in plastic wrap & refrigerate to allow the flavors to really meld together.

Watch out for the scare-mongers - it's an urban legend see http://www.phthalates.org/yourhealth/food _packaging.asp One of my favorite recipes is chicken wrapped with proscutto and fontina, poached in plastic wrap and served with a red wind butter sauce. Soooo good!!

Please, please, do NOT cook in plastic wrap!!! I am a toxicologist who does research on environmental toxins. We have shown, as have many others, that plastics are full of toxins that can hurt your liver, your immune system, and your sex hormones and reproductive systems. This is not a joke. Please do not cook in plastic wrap, and even if you insist on doing so, don't give the food to your kids!

The whole poaching in plastic sounded less than appetizing to me but I gave it a whirl and was thrilled with the results! Not at all rubbery...just moist and flavorful and a huge hit with everyone. My advice...don't knock it until you've tried it!

This dish came out great. The only change that I made was that I marinated the chicken breast for about an hour before preparing the dish. The garlic sauted spinach with the goat cheese made a wonderful combination with the chicken. I served it sliced in half inch pieces so that you could see the filling and surrounded it with sauted carrots and roasted baby red potatoes. Poaching the chicken kept it moist and soft even the next day when I reheated the leftovers in the microwave. I would definitely make it again. For the cook who decided that the plastic wrap did not sound like such a great idea - good for you considering that you put it in the oven you would have had a huge mess on your hands considering that plastic and heat do not mix. So yes, you are right -it is not a good idea to place plastic in the oven. The recipe called for poaching because when you place plastic in constant hot water - not boiling - the plastic does not melt.

This is a great basic recipe. I make it all of the time, but also make some changes. If using frozen or fresh spinach, make sure to dry as much water out of the cooked spinach as possible (paper towels, or a colander for quite some time) before mixing with the cheese. Also nice to add sun dried tomatoes or toasted pine nuts, but not absolutely necessary. The stuffing is really enough for 6 chicken breasts. I like to prepare the stuffing on the weekend, roll each of the stuffed chicken breasts in the plastic wrap, and then place 4 in the freezer and 2 in the refrigerator to cook up for the next night's meal. When ready to uncook, unroll from the wrap (yes, it will retain its shape without needing a toothpick) and bake in a glass baking dish at 180°C for about 30 minutes. Voila! Goes with anything...

I can't even imagine making this exactly as written...ugh, chicken wrapped in plastic and poached? Icky. But the filling seemed like a nice base. So, I added chopped sun dried tomatoes as was suggested, and also some chopped Kalamata olives, and added a bit of chopped shallot to the garlic. Cut about a 2 inch slit in the side of the breasts and poked the filling in instead of pounding and wrapping - I think this is easier - and pan-seared them in some olive oil over high-ish heat for a few minutes to get them nice and browned first, then finished in the oven at 300 for about 10 minutes. Tasty. Personally I find poached chicken rather nasty - kind of squeaky and flavorless - so I would recommend doing pretty much any other way of cooking for these! Stuffed breasts always look impressive, even though they can be quite easy.

I just made this and am partaking it now. Flavor - it is all there. I didn't modify it much. I sauted my spinach with roasted garlic and olive oil. I used a small amount of spinach and a lot of goat cheese and I added feta cheese. Couple it with brown rice and dinner is served.

Overall the chicken came out very good but I did modify the recipe quite a bit. I took a previous suggestion to add sundried tomatoes and a little extra garlic to make the filling a little more flavorful. I also used frozen spinach as it was easier. I was sure to season with salt and pepper both sides of the chicken breast before stuffing. I also wrapped the chicken in prosciutto to give it a little more kick. I did not poach the chicken but rather baked in the oven in a bath of chicken stock. Thanks for all of the great suggestions along the way to improve the recipe.

This was a ridiculous recipe, and the worst part was that after all that work, it was just BLAND.

Not bad, but for all the work I expected something spectacular. It came out way too mild and flat, I guess because of spinach and goat cheese filling, so: use less spinach, serve with slice of fresh lemon for extra zest and whatever you can think to add more spice/flavor to the dish. I severed with wild rice and green beans.

This was really awesome, although as an amateur cook it was a little time-consuming. I poached it in the plastic wrap but will use the oven next time.

This does crack me up!! You did NOT read it wrong. It says to leave it in the "carcinogenic" wrap. But, hey... use an organic chicken. Makes it all ok. : )

Made this tonight for the first time. Followed the advice of adding sun dried tomato and baking instead of poaching. The plastic wrap did not sound like such a great idea. So instead I placed them in foil pockets in the oven at 400 for about 30 minutes. I forgot to make the roasted red bell pepper sauce that is recommended by Tim Diffendorfer in the reviews but will next time it sounds very good.

Dish was very good, I would make the following changes. Instead of wrapping the stuffed chicken in saran wrap (which is not healthy). Buy chicken breast on the bone with the skin. Have the butcher cut off the breast from the bone and save the bone & skin. When boiling the water throw in the bones for flavor. Once you stuff the chicken. Wrap the chicken in its skin and wrap the stuffed chicken, with the skin wrapped around it, with cotton twine. Take the bones out of the boiling water and throw the stuffed chicken with the skin and twine in the boiling water for 14-16 minutes. Now you have a dish.

VERY GOOD. I had some fresh spinach that needed to be used, so I tried this last night. First of all, I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes (for half the time, I covered with a foil tent and added some extra broth to the pan to keep in the moisture). I also used grated gouda cheese and 6 large cloves of garlic for the filling. Finally, I cut kebab skewers in half and poked them through the chicken to keep them together. I found this was easier than using kitchen string or plastic wrap. They cooked quickly and were very delicious. I used a side of brown rice.

This is something I have made for a long time. I do however add sundried tomatoes to the stuffing for an amazing added flavor. I like to roll the chicken up in plastice and place in the frig for about 1hr. I then remove the plastic and bake them in the oven. For a sauce, I roast red bell peppers, seed and puree. I then add some chicken stock and Oyster flavored sauce (believe it or not.) I then reduce the sauce some and spoon over the sliced chicken. I serve it with angel hair pasta and use the sauce on the pasta as well. let me know what you think. I used to serve this in my restaurant.

I find that it is better if you use twine you can bake it off and instead of clompletly baking it wrap it in philo. Add whatever sauce you would like.

I agree with the cook from Tacoma. If you're not supposed to use plastic wrap in the microwave, I can't think it's safe to use in boiling stock either. Downright dangerous, I would think. I used foil and it held together okay but it tasted waterlogged. There are better recipes for this out there.

This recipe was relatively easy, although seemingly sophisticated. My suggestion would be to serve it with some sort of complentary sauce.

A big hit! Delicious!I used eight cloves of garlic and added dried thyme, basil and oregano in addition to salt and pepper to the stuffing. I also salted and peppered both sides of the chicken before rolling. Since I baked instead of poaching, I chose not to use the plastic and they rolled up just fine. Also sprinkled a little paprika on top before baking. Very attractive as well as tasty! Served with garlic smashed potatoes and peas.

just have to ask - - do I understand this correctly that you simmer these things WITH the plastic on? If so, I've read way too many things about what happens chemically to plastic when it's heated up (carcenogens 'o plenty) so won't bother to try this. If I've read the directions wrong, please let me know, because otherwise this sounds great.

The chicken should be pounded as thin as you can get them without falling apart. Make sure that you salt and pepper the breasts BEFORE you stuff them. They can be quite bland if you don't. I used toothpicks to keep the ends together when poaching.

This recipe has become a favorite in our household. I have made it several times and prefer it baked. A good goat cheese with plenty of seasoning is the key. It even tastes wonderful as a leftover.

I substituted feta cheese (probably more like 5 or 6 oz) and added another clove of garlic. I also overstuffed the chicken breasts so they were in a very loose roll. Also to save time I used frozen organic spinach. I served over ratatouille. My husband and I both thought it was delicious.

This had absolutely no flavor! I even added more goat cheese and garlic than it called for, but it still tasted bland. I think maybe if you bake it or broil it it could be better.
