My husband of all people is now searching this site for recipes and came across this one. I made it last night for dinner and it was a winner!! My husband loved it and it will be made again. The one thing I would change though is when making the candied orange peel, I would increase the sugar to 1/2 C.

Really wonderful recipe. The way this recipe is written makes it sound much more complicated than it really is, in my opinion. This recipe is basically the same, but explained a bit more simply : http://butimhungry.com/2012/10/04/pretzel-crusted-pork-chops-with-orange-mustard-sauce/ Will make this one over and over!

Absolutely delicious! My husband LOVED it and so did I. I also liked the fact that much of it can be made ahead of time.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe! Sounded more time consuming than what it really was. Feel that anyone who used marmalade is not getting the depth of the cream/orange sauce. I used thick chops and only adjusted the baking time to accomodate the change. Wonderful! Wonderful! Very easy as a do ahead....

Superb. I made the recipe as is and would not change a thing! The candied orange peel/mustard sauce and balsamic reduction are key to getting that "german-style pretzel & mustard" flavor profile. In my opinion, marmalade (in general) adds a bitterness that I don't particularly care for... so i suggest using the peel. :)

Excellent. I subbed orange marmalade for candied orange peel but otherwise made as written, and it's a fairly easy weekday dinner. The pretzel crust fried up in butter on top of the chops is ridiculously good. I liked having both sauces (I think they complimented each other), plus I made extra and we used them with the (rather plain) rice and veggies served alongside the meal.

I made this as written and was very satisfied with the result. The prep seems daunting, but it wasn't difficult and marched along. We had a Riesling with it and thought it was a perfect match.

Made this exactly as written. The most time consuming part was making the orange peels and to me the result was a lot like marmalade. Next time I will use that as others have suggested. Loved the cream sauce, the approach (the coating didn't come off!), the pretzel coating, and the do-ahead tips. I did the balsamic vinegar thing - liked it but probably it could be skipped.

The pork chops were moist and delicious. Used the same method on chicken one week later...better with pork chops. Did not make the orange sauce so no comment on that.

Great recipe, everyone loved it. To save time and as other have suggested, use orange marmalade in place of making the candied orange peels, it will contribute the same flavor. Also the balsamic reduction can be skipped, the focus is really on the cream sauce so little would be missed.

The directions are so good that this was the first time I didn't overcook pork chops. I made this a super fast meal by buying candied orange peel. The meal went together in a snap.

I made it for Sunday dinner.Every one thought it was the best pork chops that they have had in a long time. I cook for a living and will be doing this recipe at work soon.

THis is a lot of work, and just okay. We make better ones with white bread crumbs combined with shallots and toasted, then baked. From Cooks Illustrated, crunchy pork chops

This recipe is amazing! Time consuming, however deliciously worth the investment. Make sauces ahead of time if possible. Bon Appetit!

This is great, although I subdtituded orange marmelade and used honey mustard pretzels, so it was a cinch. Will make often

Don't skip anything. Yes, it's time consuming, but worth every minute. Every single person I have served this to has asked for the recipe.

Fantastic. I don't think it needs the balsamic vinegar reduction. We ate it without it and it was wonderful.

As promised, the recipe really delivered on a wide range of flavors.It is very delicious. I followd the recipe pretty much line for line, only substituting honey/mustard pretzels for just plain ones. (great addition, I thought). Having said all that, would I make it again? Probably not. Waaaaay to much work for a regular weeknight and as far as a dinner party dish, well those flavors may not appeal to everyone. If you have a couple of hours to play, do try it...otherwise, find something else to make.

So flavorful! Don't be tempted to skip any of the steps... It all comes together to make a wonderful combination of salty, tangy and sweet. YUM!

Due to time, I skipped the orange-mustard sauce and served just with the balsamic vinegar and it was perfect! I'd also recommend serving w/beer vs. wine, like "A Cook" said, this recipe screams "micro-brew"!

This is one of my favorites. Every aspect of this recipe works so well. Regarding suggesting a wine below, i would stick with your favorite beer. This screams "Serve me in a microbrew".

I was out of marmalade so I used raspberry - rhubarb preserves and it was excellent. I also coated both sides of the chop with pretzels and had a wonderfully crunchy,and impressive looking dinner.

I made this dish for a dinner party. It was a huge hit. I followed the suggestions and made everything I could ahead of time. I am glad I did. The prep was more time consuming than expected. But it was worth it. The orange cream sauce, basalmic vinegar, and pretzles were the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and sour. YUM!

The sauce is truly what makes this dish. I was annoyed about having to make the candied orange peel but it really is what makes this dish special. I was however, a little underwhelmed with the pretzel crust. These would be just as good with a panko crust or even just without any kind of breading, since it is the sauce that is outstanding. I also feel like you could skip the balsamic reduction if you were pressed for time, although it doesn't take that much more effort to make it while you are already reducing the orange peel. This sauce would be good with salmon, maybe with some capers added to it....

I was looking for something with some Colorado flare, and this dish from Beaver Creek was just the ticket. I prepared it for the crowd of friends who helped me move into my new CO home. It's become a new most-requested dinner at my house--really beautiful and hearty. Served it with fresh green beans.

Outstanding! The orange-cream sauce made the dish. The pretzel crust was a tasty twist on your standard breaded pork chop. Next time I will make the sauce ahead of time because it is the most time-consuming part.

Lots of work the first time, but worth it, and it makes extra candied orange zest, so the next time is much easier. As far as a wine pairing We enjoyed the dish with a grenache from spain. Excellent. A keeper!

Fantastic recipe...my family was raving from the first bite. I did however make a few changes, instead of going through the trouble of candied peel, i just added orange marmalade to the cream. u have have have to make the sauces, the combination is unbelievable. also i pounded and brined the chops for about 1 hour, they cooked up really quick and were super tender that way. loved the pretzel crust.

Really really good. We've made it a few times now, and it gets less time-intensive each try. My husband loves this, and requests it all the time.

My husband is a meat-and-potatoes man and loved this pork. I paired it with some garlic mashed potatoes and green beans and had a wonderful meal and presentation.

After i made this ( it really does take a while), my wife and i sat down with the kids to eat. As we took our first bite , we looked at each other. We have an expression that we use in restaurants when we get something that is unexpectedly great. She looked at me and said "This is 'are you kidding me good'". Believe me. this recipe is that good . Paired it with prosciutto wrapped asparagus and banoffee pie. 3 for 3 on the evening.

The pork chops with the pretzel crust is amazing and looks even better. Next time I will eliminate the orange component from the sauce recipe and just serve it as a mustard cream sauce.

Delicious recipe. Not a quick week night dinner, but a very tasty weekend one. All the components come together really well. Will definitely make again. Take advantage of all the do-aheads, then it is not too bad. This recipe paired nicely with a grenache wine.

I was surprised at how good this recipe turned out. The pretzel coating is a nice alternative to traditional frying. I was not sure about the balsamic vinegar but it was a great combination with the sauce. Being an amateur cook, it was not difficult to make but a little time consuming given this was my first time making it. I will definitely make this one again and take advantage of the portions that can be prepared ahead of time.

This receipe is fab! Each step is important. The candied orange peel is subtle but adds an important and distinctive flavor to the dish. It is a process, and to save some time I will try store bought candied orange peel. My husband and I both thought it is a necessary flavor. The only pretzels I had were mustard coated and I will use those each time as well! It is a nice alternative to a brined PC but retains the benefits!

I was really excited to try this recipe, but to me the pretzel coating didn't taste that much different than a standard breadcrumb coating. It also took longer than anticipated.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I coated both sides the the chops with the pretzel crust and reduced the balsamic to a real syrup. It was delicious...I would serve it to company to impress them! The second time I followed the one crust side directions and did not allow enough time to reduce the balsamic sufficiently and it was not as good. Also the quality of the pork chop I used the first time was better (differnt source), and I think that made a difference. Those that did not make all the sauces and garnishes really missed out on the good combination of flavors. None of the steps was difficult, it just required some time and planning. I will make this again, hopefully as well as I did the first time.

Rating: 2
The addition of the sauce and the candied oranges seemed like overkill to me. After really taking a close look at the recipe I decided to just make the crusted chops and they were really great. I will definetely make again, however, I don't think I will go through all the trouble of the other parts to the recipe.

Sorry, but I made this the other night and was totally disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly yet it just didn't do it for us. Probably just a matter of personal taste.

Everyone loved it. I didn't make the sauce because the orange peel did not sound that great to me, however,the chops were really good and really fun! They would be great with any kind of sauce that you enjoy (I used a sour cream, dijon, lemon, tabasco mix), but they do need a sauce of some kind. My 9 year old made them with me and thought they were a hoot! Next time I am going to crust them on both sides.

Oh my, you've GOT to try this one! Unbelievable mesh of flavors! Candied orange peel and balsamic reduction really make the dish. Served with a Pahl Meyer Merlot, thought we'd died and gone to Heaven... Made a salad with fresh summer greens and veggies and that's all we needed. Prep does look tedious but was actually quick, as was the cleanup. Impressive for "date nite" or for special company. This one's definitely a keeper.

What a great dish! It was a nice variation on comfort food and had such a great display. The falvors blended well too. While there were a few steps to follow, none of them were difficult. The sauce took more than 10 minutes to boil down, probably twenty. Not having an oven-proof skillet, I drizzled a little butter on top of the pork chops and then baked them on a cookie sheet; they turned out just fine. It was nice to have all the ingredients on hand. I'm saving this recipe.
