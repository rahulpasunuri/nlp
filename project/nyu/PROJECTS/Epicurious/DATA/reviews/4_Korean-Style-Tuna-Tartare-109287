served this at many dinner parties and people thought it was delicious, creative, and unique. definitely add the tuna at the last bit. and be careful with your ginger since it can overpower sushi-grade tuna.

First off- this might be the greatest tuna tartare recipe out there. I have made it several times and it is consistently a total epicurean crowd pleaser. It is exceptionally delicious with a very oaky and buttery chardonnay. Here are my tips- Make the sesame paste yourself by buying toasted sesame seeds and crushing them with mortar&pestle. Use rice vinegar and add a couple teaspoons of sweet rice wine in the dressing(as opposed to rice wine vinegar, hard to come by). this is most important; add the tuna at the very last, and stir minimally so you don't brown out the dish. BRILLIANT DISH!!!

excellent taste, but the presentation is greyish and not appealing. Maybe one should omit the sesame paste, and add a lot of coriander on top to make it look more green.

This recipe is excellent, I have made it several times. I served it at cocktail party this weekend as an appetizer/salad, I had to hold some of my guests back from licking the bowl. I did not use the egg yolk and substituted the red cabbage for the chinese cabbage. I also made it with some Black Fin tuna filets that I caught earlier in morning. I have made this recipe several times with other types of very fresh tuna like Skip Jack. It is excellent and always gets rave reviews. THANK YOU!!!

Excellent as written, but we added 2 teaspoons of red chili paste dimension to the sesame dressing for a little more dimension.
