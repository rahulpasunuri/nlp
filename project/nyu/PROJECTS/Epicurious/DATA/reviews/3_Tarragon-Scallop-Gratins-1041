This was great! Used much less oil, a touch of grated garlic with shallot, put in one large gratin for 1 lb scallops, topped sparingly with Panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and a bit of lemon zest as suggested. Fresh tarragon is key. Quinoa on the side with salad or any green veggie. Great light summer meal!

I am not a huge Tarragon fan, I would not have thought of paring it with shellfish- I am sure some one will object to my rating this given that I made it with shrimp (I am sure its awsome with scallops) and added garlic...I also followed some ones suggestion of adding a little of the bread crums into the mix and ontop...sooo yummy, paired it with a mixed greend salad with the french vinagrette also on this site....good light dinner

This was tasty, light, and easy. A great way to use frozen scallops. I used panko and lemon zest on top instead of the fresh breadcrumbs, which worked well.

We are not particularly fond of scallops, however, this recipe is delicious beyond words. Totally followed recipe except took other readers' suggestion and incorporated bread crumbs into recipe and not on top. Will absolutely add this to my file.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I used sea scallops and cut down on the olive oil. I also used fresh tarragon which is a must, I added quite a bit extra. This is a great meal for a hot summer night as it is nice and light. Next time I'll try some sauteed garlic for an added kick.

I added garlic and mushrooms and sauteed them with the shallots. This added more flavor to the dish. Definitely use fresh tarragon !!

Will make again because it is quick and tasty when you need to have a meal that way....however, as with most recipes I see, here and elsewhere, there is too much fat...much more than needed. Instead of 2 tablespoons olive oil, go for LIGHT and get an olive oil spritzer and just spritz the scallops and then spritz the top of the bread crumbs. You've just made an almost fat-free recipe. If you want the benefits of the olive oil and don't have a weight problem, toss a little in......but not 2 Tablespoons!

I added some leftover cooked spaghetti partway through cooking the scallops. My kids (ages 8, 6 & 3) could not get enough. This is definitely our favorite way to cook fresh Nantucket scallops.

True it was quick and easy but nothing to write home about in the flavor department.

This dish is quick, easy and delicious! I completely disagree with "A Cook from Decatur" and think the tarragon does amazing things to the bay scallops. Definitely worth a try!

I made this with shrimp instead of scallops. It is so easy, and very tasty. An excellent quick dinner.

I totally disagree with the chef from Decatur. Tarragon and scallops are wonderful together!!! There's no accounting for taste, chef or otherwise.

Have made this recipe a few times and it gets better each time. We love the tarragon. It is fast becoming a family fav.

The tarragon added an interesting flavor I had never experienced. My guests all asked for the recipe. I sauted the shallots with a little chopped red pepper for color.

This dish was an absolute nightmare. My boyfriend is a professional chef, and he said he would never mix tarragon and scallops. Anyway, it was so bad we ate a few bites and ordered pizza. Really.
