Delicious and fairly simple. I used 6c. raspberries and blackberries and had no problems. We live in a small town without cake flour at our grocery, but the texture was still light and fluffy with all-purpose flour. I did add the custard sauce for accompaniment with a little lemon to echo the flavor in the cake. We ate it with Easter Breakfast and kept off the whipped cream-- but I will add it for dessert tonight.

I didn't use any blackberries, and the cake turned out great! Raspberries and blueberries were perfect in this recipe, but the cake was more on the sweet side. When I make this again, I will definitely use blackberries because this specific cake needs that sour counterbalance. Overall, a great cake!

Mine tastes like a muffin and looks nothing like the picture. What did I do wrong?

Delicious, with just 3 cups of berries. Lovely texture.

Excellent, unusual recipe. I'm not sure why other people had problems--I used nearly 7 cups of berries and it came out perfectly--the berries cooked down and the cake rose a lot, so the balance was fine in the end. It's very important to use cake flour, not all-purpose flour, to get a light, fluffy result. Also be sure to whip up the eggs and sugar as directed, and only beat in the flour very slightly, or it will become glutinous. I found this cake very light and summery. It was a big hit at the picnic--everyone loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, 6 cups of berries, butter, cream, baking powder and cake flour (key for a light and airy cake) and it was fantastic! Sweet, light and so delicious. I used raspberries, blackberries and blueberries from the farmers market and i think that is important. The berries have to be flavorful or it's just not going to be that good, as they are a major component of the cake. I did use an extra teaspoon of lemon rind though because i love lemon flavor and i think if was a good addition. I also left off the powdered sugar and served it with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum!

I made the cake without the berries and it is kind of like a big chocolate chip cookie (minus the chocolate chips), in both consistency and taste. Since I am living at high altitude I wanted something that wouldn´t need to rise a lot, and this was it. I used it to make a strawberry shortcake. Those who tried it loved it, but had never had the real thing. I think it´s better with angel food cake because this cake is quite dense and sweet, but, it is an alternative.

I made this for a family potluck last night and it was delicious! I used 2 cups of raspberries and a cup and a half of blackberries. It was light, moist and absolutely wonderful. The flavour of the fresh berries really came through. I didn't mind the seeds at all and neither did anyone else who tried it. I will make it again for sure!!

This was so good. Everyone loved it, even people who don't usually eat dessert. I made it again 5 days later, then served it the next day and it was even better. Only used 4 cups of berries. More than enough. Will make it every summer with fresh berries.

I only had 3 c. of berries, and that is not enough. With that amount, there is too much cake and not enough berry goodness. Also, I baked this in a glass pyrex dish, and it was done in only 30 minutes. I do not recommend the glass dish, because the bottom is a little too dark.

Used 4 cups of fresh raz/blue & blackberries. (6 cups seemed extreme) I was out of cake flour so I used 2 1/4 cups AP flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch as a sub. Baked in 9" round pan for 45 minutes. Center was not done, but I cut around it. This was a trial, so next time I might try the rec pan or a bundt.

Delicious. Everyone is right: 4 cups of berries is plenty. I used fresh raspberries and blueberries, and had no trouble with sinking or sogginess. The raspberries could have used a spoonful of (vanilla?) sugar tossed with them, it being early for raspberries hereabouts. The lemon zest is important. This is a lovely, summery cake; perfect for a picnic and it goes together in a flash, with a standing mixer.

This was wonderful. Looked just like the picture. The flavor of the berries came through brilliantly. Served with whipped cream. Yum. We eat lots of berries in season and this is a great alternative to blueberry pancakes, blueberry muffins, etc.

PS - I made it in a round pan, not the 9x13

Y'all are going to think I'm crazy, but I LEFT OUT THE BERRIES! I can't remember why did that, but the cake by itself is fabulous! It's hard to describe, but this cake was very sturdy, and yet has a light texture to it - To serve, I sprinkled it with powdered sugar, and then cut it into wedges. Then, I paired the cake with the fresh berries and lightly sweetened whipped cream - one time for company, i used a biscuit cutter and made "shortcakes" out of it!! It was a huge hit!!!

I made it with 5 cups of blueberries and was still too much berries! It basically just tasted like a blueberry muffin with too many blueberries! Next time I'll save my berries for a pie or cobbler.

Save your berries. It was definitely one of the ugliest cakes I've ever made (a purplish color from the berries) and it had a wierd, spongy texture. It wasn't horrible, just not anything special. A crisp or cobbler would've been a better use of the berries.

This is en excellent cake! I have been making it for 3 summers and it is always a hit. I do want to share a few tips. Be stingy with the berries. Cut by 1/3, 4 cups of berries is more then enough. The only time I made it with 6 cups turned out very embarrassing, I had to scoop it out of the mold and it did not look at all presentable, though tasted great anyway. I have made it with frozen berries (do not thaw). You need to double the baking time, and it comes out the same. If heavy cream not available I substituted milk and 2-3 table spoons of sour cream and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda. Made no difference, came out delicious. Do try it! Yum!

Very good!! Made this for work and everyone loved it. This cake is very light, not too sweet. The lemon really added a certain freshness to it. I used blackberries, blueberries and raspberries. Next time I will leave the raspberries out because they were a bit tart. Overall, a very easy and great recipe, will make this again!

DIVINE! I made this cake to take as a snack on a camping trip and it was wonderful. It was a last minute thing the night before we left and I didn't have any lemons so I didn't put the zest in it. After reading the other reviews I think I will leave it out permanently. It is a very moist cake, you have to make sure you cook it long enough but it will also freeze very well. I used blueberries, raspberries and strawberries cut in fourths. It is a delicious cake, my brother ate four pieces in a row while it was cooling on the counter.

This was a hit at my brunch--lots of recipe requests. I used only raspberries and blackberries (couldn't find nice blueberries). I used all six cups. I did need to bake this about 10 minutes longer than the recipe indicated, but it worked to avoid the gooey interior that some previous reviewers described.

I was delighted with the result of this cake. Not very sweet, full of berries. I only used about 4 cups and thought that was plenty.

Very moist and tasty. I used blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries that I defrosted before adding to the batter. I served it with a simple blueberry sauce. Would work for breakfast or dessert. Some of my friends complained about the berry seeds.

This was great! I used all 6 cups of berries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. At first, I thought that there were more berries than batter. I spooned it in the pan and held my breath while it baked. It baked great! It looked exactly like the picture. I served it with the Vanilla Custard Sauce listed on this web site. Both are a keeper!

I'm not sure if it was amount of berries, but something gave this cake an unappealing "raw-like" texture; it tasted soggy, even though it was fully baked. I also thought the amount of lemon rind was too much; one teaspoon would have been a better amount for me. By the way, for those who don't have cake flour, I substituted 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour + 1/4 cup corn starch. Bottom line, if I have six cups of berries laying around, I'll bake a pie.

I made this cake for a pot luck, adding the custard sauce and whipped cream before serving. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and several asked for the recipe. I used the required amount of berries which did not seem to be too many for me. I would definetly make this again when berries are in season.

I am a seasoned baker and find this an easy and colorful summer cake. Dusted with powder sugar and bursting with fresh berries, this cake got so many compliments that it is now my premiere summer cake.It is requested more than anything I bake!

I tried making this in a Bundt pan like a previous reviewer suggested with just blackberries, since I had a couple gallons to get rid of. I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but all the berries sank to the bottom and stuck to the pan. When I turned it out I had a couple of inches of dry, crumbly cake covered with a layer of purple mush. I'm glad I didn't make this for a family get together as I'd originally planned - it never would have held its own against my mom's fabulous peach cobbler.

Made this w/ just blueberries. Easy and yummy - I thought it would be too many berries for the amount of batter, but I folded the entire amount in anyway. It worked - they made the cake very moist - especially the next day.

Made with 5 cups of berries. Tasted like a berry muffin versus a cake.

This is a wonderful summer dessert, perfect after the standard BBQ fare. I used only 5 cups of fresh berries and would recommend that amount. I also served it with whipped cream (slightly sweetened)which complimented the cake well.

I did use frozen berries, 1 bag of blueberries and one of raspberries, thawed and drained. I also used a bundt pan (baking it twice the amount of time) because, well, it's really the only cake pan I have. I had never made a cake with this technique before - beating the sugar and eggs so long, adding melted butter - and I thought it turned out great. It was easier than I expected (I melted the butter in the microwave.) Not haute cuisine but great, tasty, fruity cake. A word of advice though - make this for friends the first time because if the raspberries fall apart it winds up pink! Confession: I'm eating a slice for breakfast as I type. Yum!

My one tip is DO NOT USE FROZEN BERRIES. I know this is probably obvious, but I did it and it turned my nice batter quite soild. Therefore the cake didn't rise very much but it still tasted quite good.

This cake is so delicious and light and quite easy to make. However, I do agee that you don't need to use as many berries as the recipe calls for.

My fiance is addicted to this cake. Like an addict, by the end of the berry season he was paying top dollar for berries for this cake. I make it in 2 round cake pans and put it together like a layer cake with a rasberry filling. Very yummy and packed with berries.

This cake was wonderful. I did cut down the berries to about 5 cups and used blueberries, blacberries and red raspberries. It is the taste of summer that you are looking for. I will definitely make this again. Enjoy!

A nice change from cobblers and buckles. Listening to some of the negative comments I adjusted the amount of fruit by half. I used wild rasberries and blueberries. I didn't have time to make a sauce so I served it warm with vanilla ice ceam. It was delicious

This was a very easy cake to make. The texture is firm and it cuts well. I used frozen blackberries about 6 cups, since my daughter had gone out and picked heaps. I only just folded in the berries as the recipe said and found there was still plenty of buttery cake around the berries. I also used plain low fat milk instead of the cream and it worked fine.

This cake was fantastic. I didn't think the berries were overkill, but I did use large blackberries along with blue and raspberries. I followed the suggestion to serve with vanilla custard sauce, and I was the rave of the party.

I'm with you Bethesda. Good grief, who came up with this one? Six cups of berries is over-kill. Couldn't really taste enough of the cake.

I made this exactly how the recipe calls for and it was just average. I was dissappointed after reading the other positve reviews. I felt like it was a waste of my raspberries that I picked myself. It was almost to many berries for the cake, every time I would take a bite I wanted to taste more cake but kept getting berries.

This was supercalifragilistic! I used all blueberries as I did not have the other berries called for, and the cake was just loaded with the fruit. I did not make a custard sauce this time, but next time around I may try that also.

I made mine with all blueberries. I also used my favorite, White Lily Flour. It was the lightest, most wonderful cake I've made in a long while. My guests loved it. I might try baking it next time in a 9 in sq pan to get more height.
