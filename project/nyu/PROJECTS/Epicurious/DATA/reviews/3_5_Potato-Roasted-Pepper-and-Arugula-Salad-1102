Given the ingredients I was disapointed. I thought it would be more interesting

Great for hot weather coming up. Subsitutiions: Anchovy paste for anchovy fillets and sometimes I skip charring the peppers but I don't skip marinating the potatoes in wine. Adds allot. Off to the store. Fixing this for another evening !
