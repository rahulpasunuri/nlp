GREAT RECIPE! I grilled a top sirloin and used tangerines instead. Yummo!

excellent recipe! the clemetines can be substituted for tangerines. the chile rub was great with the citrus fruit.

Fast and Easy and that deserves two forks by itself! We thought it was good and that the flavors complemented eachother quite well. I will make it again, especially when I am pressed for time!

my boyfriend and i were somewhat disappointed. the salsa was overpowered by the onion and the olive oil (pan-frying) with the chili rub was a strange combination. i added avocado to the salsa, which helped the flavor some. i think without it, the orange/onion combo would have been a disaster. my recommendations: make sure you get all the "skin" off the clementine pieces and grill the steak rather than pan-frying. still, we won't make it again.
