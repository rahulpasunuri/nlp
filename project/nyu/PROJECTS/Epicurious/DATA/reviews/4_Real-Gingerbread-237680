This gingerbread recipe comes out dense, moist, and with a really wonderful deep ginger flavor. I made it while the boyfriend was putting up the Christmas tree, and the house smelled divine. Will make again.

I made this today for my dad's birthday and it was excellent. I buy fresh ginger from my local Asian supermarket, which only sells it in wrapped packages of a quarter pound or so. That's a LOT of ginger, so I cut it into 1" pieces and put it into a jar and cover with dry sherry. I keep it in the fridge and it lasts a couple of years this way. This is the ginger I used in the gingerbread today and it was superb. Thanks for the recipe!

I was actually a little worried about this recipe based on the few bad reviews here, but I wasn't disappointed. This recipe was PHENOMENAL and is going into my permanent collection. I just want to comment that I discovered that three tablespoons of rasped fresh ginger is a LOT. Luckily, I happened to have purchased a particularly large piece of ginger. It took a fair amount of time to grate that much ginger, but was well worth it. As another reviewer put it, it was dense, chewy and popping with flavor. Perfect.

Given all of the amazing reviews, I was really excited to make and taste this cake. I was sadly disappointed, as I found it just "okay," nothing special at all, even with whipped cream. I won't make it again.

curious -- why not blackstrap molasses?

This was phenomenal! The fresh ginger really gives it an extra bite. My friends and coworkers LOVED it and I'm making more tonight because I have leftover Ginger :). I put a lemon icing on top that was great. Just lemon juice and powdered sugar.

I was hungry for gingerbread but didn't have a tried and true recipe for it. I chose this one because of the fresh ginger and it didn't disappoint. This was moist and spicy and really delicious. We served it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and it was fabulous. I will definitely make this again!

This was an oustanding gingerbread! I used organic ground ginger, being too lazy to grate fresh and it was delish. Best served with real whipped cream !

Dense and chewy with rich ginger and molasses flavor. I liked it personally but rest of the family didn't. I've made better recipes.

Lovely textured cake--especially warm from the oven! Not overly sweet and the flavors linger in your mouth long after the last bite. The flavors are more middle of the road but some of us like it that way. I would definitely play around with the spices and ginger if you wanted a more assertively flavored cake. Though I like it plain, I could envision creme fraiche ice cream or a pool of flavored creme anglaise--yum!

awesome! my first time making a gingerbread cake, and it came out perfect, so spongy. we topped it off with cream cheese icing and cut it into squares..all I changed was added a bit more cinnamon and allspice..next time I think I may add some cloves...there will dinitely be a next time

Wish to add that I baked gingerbread in a 9-inch round pan, and baked it for 38 minutes. Perfect.

After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe with these modifications: add 1/4 tsp of cloves, used 2 Tbl of pureed ginger and one tsp of powdered ginger. I served it with whipped cream made with a pint of heavy whipping cream, Tbl white sugar, dash of vanilla and indispensable packet of Whipit stabilizer (apologies to purists). Brought it to the same Thanksgiving crowd as last year when I made "Childhood Gingerbread with Molasses." Gingerbread was requested (and enjoyed last year) but this time everyone EXCLAIMED how excellent it was and complimented me. I vastly prefer it over last year's gingerbread.

I used an 8" square pan instead of a 9, which I think was a bad idea. The cake was slightly dry around the edges and still undercooked in the very center. I also didn't have enough fresh ginger so I used 1 tbsp fresh and subbed the other 2 tbsps with 1/4" tsp ground ginger. The cake was good and everyone loved it but I have made better recipes in the past. I also made caramel and whipped cream to serve with it, which is really wonderful.

So good! I added about a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped crystalized ginger in addition to grated fresh ginger. Could be even more gingery in my opinion, so next time I will add even more. Yummy and smelled so good baking!

This is by far the best gingerbread recipe I have ever come across. I recommend it to real gingerbread lovers on epicurious.

Outstanding! I just tasted Jamaican gingerbread and was inspired to make this. Very moist! My son almost ate half of it right out of the oven. Didn't have molasses so I used maple syrup and substituted a little fresh-ground nutmeg for the allspice. Will definitely make again.

Made the recipe almost exactly. i didn't use allspice and added a little less than a tablespoon of cardamom. the favor was great and the density was that of a thick cake. very good

I think this is a great base recipe. Normally, I like to try a recipe once before altering it, but I read all the reviews and decided I should increase the ginger amount. I substituted ground ginger for ground cinnamon and omitted allspice completely. I added a smidgen of vanilla to the butter mixture. I added 1/2 cup of crystallized ginger chips(from www.gingerpeople.com) to the flour mixture. I think it's delicious! I like the lighter texture, as well. It's definitely very gingery!

This recipe was good, but it wasn't as gingery as I was hoping with the fresh ginger. I might use more ginger next time or mix fresh and dried. The texture was great.

The cake is moist and was what I thought might be prepared 150 years ago. Therefore, not changing anything in this recipe, I baked the cake in a spider pot in an open hearth baking demonstration. The aroma of the baking cake had people coming from all around, and the cake came out beautifully.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The cake had a nice texture, soft and spongey but I like gingerbread to be moist and dense. It was also very mild. It definitely could use more ginger. Overall it's fine, I just didn't think it was great.

Look no further; this is the recipe you want. Simple, easy to make and absolutely delicious, it needs nothing ... but personally, I like it with whipped cream and apricot jam.

Great basic and easy recipe to put together. I added 1 tablespoon finely minced crystallized ginger and an extra 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I used a short 10" coffeecake pan instead of the square pan; I think round tube cakes are easier to serve and are more appetizing. I also added a simple confectioner's maple icing. Great for breakfast.
