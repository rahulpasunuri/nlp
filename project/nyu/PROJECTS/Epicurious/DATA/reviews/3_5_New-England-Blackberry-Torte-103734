This went over well at a potluck dinner. I used half fresh, half frozen berries. Sifting the cornmeal did get a good 2 tablespoons of grit out, but the resulting texture was still a little bit coarse and toothy. More than I personally cared for, but seemed in keeping with what I expected of the recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer who said that if she'd had really good berries, this wouldn't be the best way to use them, but it seems like a good use for frozen or overripe fresh ones.

Made a few changes: reduced sugar to 3/4 cup; used 3/4 cup cornmeal and 1/4 cup fine polenta; baked for 45 minutes in an 8x8 pan (at one hour it would have burned). With these modifications, this dish was wonderful. It disappeared within two days.

This was really great and really easy. A very earthy dessert. The cornmeal makes an excellent pastry--dense, a little crunchy, almost nutty. I'd definitely make again.

Also fantastic with fresh blueberries!!

Easy and different; would make it again; it came out slightly burnt after 48 minutes of baking time so I would watch it carefully.

I think I used too-coarse cornmeal. It was tasty but too sweet in opinion of another taster, and the pieces of cornmeal could break a tooth. The fact that my cornmeal wouldn't sift should have been a sign. I liked the chewiness though.

This is very unusual from my neck of th woods. I have made this torte about 25-40 times. I have never had complaints by my friends. Always a real hit. Anytime it is pot-luch, I get asked to bring this. I have made variations with fresh cranberries and orange zest instead of lemon and always use blueberries instead of blackberries because I read the original recipe wrong. Fresh or frozen work great. I noticed two things, the batter has to be done with a mixer, if you do it by hand, it taste good but something get's lost in the translation. Another thing I alwasy do is make it in a 9x13. This way I never have any overflow. Always sift the cornmeal.

Maybe my cornmeal was unusual, but I ended up with more that didn't go through the seive than did. No problem. I made polenta the next day. Everyone raved about the torte.

Does this sound like a clafoutis to anyone else?

In a new mistake for me, I accidentally doubled the butter for the recipe. I don't think it hurt it much. The other change was that the cornmeal I had (likely not stone-ground) was a little shy of the amount required, so I topped it off with oatmeal. I think the combination of blackberries and cornmeal was a nice combination, but the whole dessert had too little fruit and too much buckle. If I had had really good blackberries, I would consider them wasted.

This is a great recipe and very easy. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but decided to give it a try since it was so simple. It is delicious comfort food, and yet still something new and a little unique. Despite some comments by other reviewers, I followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen mixed berries (black, rasp, blue) rather than fresh.

I messed up this recipe completely, so much so that it came out of the pan when it was in the oven. MY family still ate it even though it looked like garbage.

Add a little regular flour as the cornmeal and the berries make it just a little too chewy. It ran over the side of the pan, 8" quiche dish. Great with fresh berries from the yard.

An easy, but only okay recipe. I made it into a trifle instead and it was much better. I also would cut back on the sugar as I found it too sweet as well.

A breeze to make and very tasty, but I wouldn't to so far as to describe it as delicious or beyond compare. One caveat, I didn't use stoneground cornmeal, so perhaps the regular cornmeal that I used detracted from the finished product.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for friends who are gluten (wheat) and lactose intolerant -- a real dessert stumper. The lack of wheat flour and a substitution of non-dairy margarine for the butter made it ideal (I used an 8 X 8 inch square glass pan). Everyone loved it (including the wheat and dairy eaters among us). It was a bit sweet, so I might cut back a bit on the sugar -- but otherwise, it's great and an absolute breeze to make.

A dear friend made this for me using blueberries;Wow!Tastes like a good "layered" blueberry muffin (pie form). Our group of friends couldn't stop eating this, until we ate it all!

This was a very easy dish to make and a great new way to use berries! I will certainly be making this again and again, however, the 9" pie tin was no where near big enough and the torte went over...so be sure to use a bigger pan than I did! FANTASTIC EASY DESSERT!!

It was pretty good, a little bit on the dry side. I served it on blackberry coulis and it was better.

Actually "would you make this dish again" is a bit misleading. A friend brought it to our house for dinner and it was incredibly good! She said it was vey easy. I plan to try it with blueberries - possibly apples & peaches. Definitely a 'keeper'!
