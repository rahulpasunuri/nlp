I really enjoyed this healthy and fresh dish! I made substitutions because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used quinoa instead of barley, fresh basil and sage instead of thyme, snap peas instead of haricot verts, and added a little garlic to the side dish. I also didn't have any peppers, so I just put some slices of the red onion in with the swordfish to broil. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I will definitely make this again, it also seems like it would be easy to make for a large group.

I should have mentioned that although swordfish isn't endangered any more, it does have a good potential to contain mercury, so only very occasional eating is recommended.

I gave it 3 forks because I didn't make the barley part, it didn't seem that appealing, only the swordfish and peppers. They were great! I served it with Dama Bianca salad, and good bread, preceded by Spaghetti All'Ubriaco (drunken, cooked in red wine - really yummy). The swordfish was tasty, and the slightly black peppers a nice counterpoint.

Excellent! The roasted peppers gave it a nice touch & haricot verts made it a nice change.

The barley is a great idea, but it needs some additional salt and lemon or red wine vinegar to give it punch - otherwise its bland. Also, cut down the onions by a third and do smaller pieces - they were in the way and too overpowering. The broiled peppers were excellent, and could be used for any fish dish. I used mahi mahi instead of swordfish, and I thought it was bland, needed additional salt and lemon as well...maybe marinating it for a while would have helped.

Made it for dinner with friends. I substituted halibut for the swordfish. I was not crazy about the fish - it was good but not great. The vegetables to barley ratio had to be upped - it was too plain with so little veges.

Excellent recipe. Enjoyed with a nice rose' from Provence. Served with fennel. artichikes, and fingerling potatoes. I grilled the fish because it was a nice warm day for Dec in DC!

We made this for a birthday dinner party - it was relatively easy and very good. We will make it again. For our group, the portions were large. We could have easily served more than eight.

For the swordfish advocates out there... time change.... as printed see.... October 3, 2002 -- North Atlantic swordfish have recovered to 94% of levels considered healthy over the last three years, according to a new report issued by the scientific arm of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

Make the recipe, just don't use swordfish, please? The species need a great deal of time to recover. Someday we'll get to eat it again...Americans keep eating it and we'll never ever be able to again.

We loved this and we are going to make it again this weekend. I have not been able to find pearl barley here so substituted bulger wheat. Everything else was left as is and it was terrific.

Pretty easy to make and a very pretty dish. The barley salad alone is also very good. I am sure you can make this with other types of fish. Also good for entertaining

FYI Swordfish is an endangered species.
