I loved this. Really was the first recipe I have tried cooking from...well, anywhere, ever...and it was super easy. I used 6 eggs instead of 8, and I didn't have fresh thyme but it was still delish! I also put the extra stewed tomatoes in which made it a bit juicier so next time i think i will add a few more potatoes. To make it easy on yourself make the tomato-artichoke sauce a few hours before-hand, overall though, YUM, great recipe and fun to tweak anyway you'd like.

We like this very much, with some crusty bread. No changes; it's good as it is.

As written, it's bland...always taste while cooking! I used extra chili flakes, tabasco & hot paprika to get the flavor right. I followed the advice of others and used extra tomtato puree to make sauce. This sauce gets better with time. Make it early (the night before will work) and let the flavors infuse - meatloaf always tastes better the next day. Next time, I'll add chorizo for a heartier flavor and bigger meal.

Although the eggs cooked perfectly with the recipe as written, we were not impressed with the veggie "hash" and would not make this again

Had it for Easter breakfast today and everyone loved it! Added a wee bit more spice than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed it to a T. Made the veggie mixture the night before and reheated it before adding the eggs. Still, took almost 30 minutes for the eggs to cook.

DELICIOUS! And if the recipe is followed exactly as written, it couldn't be more perfect, just a bit spicey and so much flavor. I served it with bacon baked with brown sugar for the meat eaters, and also some zucchini bread to complement the flavors of the tomato sauce.

My husband and I loved this for brunch. I used dried thyme and oregano instead of fresh and I used 3 tsp of Sriacha for heat. Yum!

Delicious!! I added extra heat because, well, I loooove heat and it was amazing! I used new potatoes and it wasn't mushy at all. Went down so well. We have a lot of chickens and so eggs are common in our house and when I served it, my husband sighed and said, "Eggs again?" But then after a few bites he took it back!! He said it was the best thing to turn eggs into a dinner. I don't know how 'low cal' it really is considering I had 3 servings and my husband had four!!

Delicious! I served this for a Mother's Day brunch with some crusty Ciabatta bread. The only modification I made was to add 1 cup of tomato puree to enrich the sauce. I plated individual portions with sprigs of fresh thyme, which made for beautiful presentation!. See http://www.apricosa.com/2010/05/uova-al-purgatorio-eggs-in-purgatory.html for photos :) This is a definite winner for brunch!

Disappointingly bland and mushy. Was hoping for a lot more spice and textural interest but none of my dinner guests enjoyed and the leftovers were only more mushy. Suprising for Bon Appetit which usually has great recipes.

Really good! Just a few changes: used dried oregano and thyme, only 6 eggs, left the skin on the potatoes, and baked for way longer because I don't like runny eggs. It was super good and easy and I'll definitely make it again!

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and it turned out very well. Even my dad liked it, and he hates artichokes. :) I would like to make it again only this time I will par-boil the potatoes a little bit longer, or cut them into smaller pieces, as some of them were not quite done after baking. I would also add more eggs, as the combination of all the flavors with the egg really makes the dish.

This dish didn't really live up to its name until I made some adjustments. It is however very healthy and flavorful with some additional heat. Make sure you don't over cook the potatoes or they may become mushy. I let my sauce simmer about 45 minutes before adding in the potatoes to re-heat. I added some additional chili peppers and some of my own spice blend that includes paprika, turmeric and cayanne and served with tobasco.

This was very bland and just not good. I didn't really see the point of putting potatoes in this dish but if you must at least put some color on them. They were mushy and yukky by the time the eggs cooked. This dish has no flavor and is a waste of good ingredients.

Surpassed my expectations! I added a bit of oregano to the thyme and onion and think it added more roundness to the overall flavor. Definitely over-cooked the eggs (17min bake time- oops!) so will trim a few minutes off next time. Here's hoping the leftovers are just as delicious!

I made this recipe pretty much to the word, aside from being rather lackidasical with my measurements. I used a whole bag of artichokes and they weren't entirely thawed by the time I cooked them. It didn't seem to matter. I made it in two smaller pyrex pans so that we had one to store for dinner later in the week. It cooked pretty well this way. Would definitely make it again. Easy, and relatively healthy.

If you're looking for a cheap, easy, one dish meal... this is a good one.

Easy, yummy, and healthy--that's the brunch trifecta. Followed the recipe to a T except didn't peel the potato and used a 12-oz bag of frozen artichokes. As other reviewers have noted, it reheats well, too. Served these alongside this site's Cheese Blintzes with Blueberry Sauce--heaven!!

loved it!

Loved it, and so did hubby! Used a glass jar of marinated artichoke hearts instead of the frozen ones. Sauted the potatoes with the onion...otherwise, followed the recipe. I found it had to cook longer than the recipe states, also. A keeper recipe for me!

I liked this recipe as a healthy alternative for breakfast. I used Yukon Golds and didn't peel them. Making the sauce ahead of time is a great idea, and the red pepper flakes really helped. I put some of the veggies in ramekins and baked an egg, individually. I blogged it on my own food blog if you want to see my version. I also made the Irish Soda bread, which paired well with it. Super easy and a keeper.

baking the dish covered will assist in the poaching process since the steam will cook the tops

I loved this dish--especially because it was healthy, hearty and vegetarian. Wonderful use of frozen artichoke hearts too. I already make a great "Eggs in Hell", but I'll probably make this once in a while now as well. The flavors were delicious, and all came together well. I kept the dish in the oven a little longer because of some of the other reviews, and I think the eggs were a little overcooked--not enough runny yolk! I'll try to get it right next time.... Cooking eggs in the oven is tough.

This was SO good. The eggs took much longer than the recipe stated. 21 minutes in our oven at 375. I omitted the capers, but otherwise followed exactly. Nice big flavors and the egg was what really made the dish. The yolk was awesome.

This looks really good, though I'll make a couple of changes, namely subbing the potatoes for something else (maybe brown rice) and scrambling each egg due to my horror of egg yolks. This seems like a huge effort, but my egg yolk horror really is that strong.

The leftovers were a bit more tasty the next day; making the sauce in advance may help mellow it out. I also roasted the potatoes before adding the sauce and placing the eggs (adds a little flavor and texture). Very good!

I'm not a picky eater, but this was just gross. I like all of the ingredients, but they just weren't doing it for me. We ended up eating bread and butter and picking out the eggs.

Different and impresive. Tricky getting the eggs right, needed more than 15 min. Will definately do again.
