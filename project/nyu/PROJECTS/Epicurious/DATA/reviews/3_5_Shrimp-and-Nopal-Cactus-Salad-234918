This recipe could stand for a bigger boost in flavor - the oil, vinegar, lime juice wasn't enough. I perked it up by adding some mango/peach salsa. The added fruit mixture (approx 1/2-1 cup) makes all the difference. I would not make this [complicated] salad again without it!

Having just returned to Palm Springs after 5 years in Mexico, I introduced friends here to eating cactus and received raves. Would not change a thing to this recipe. Also good very cold stuffed in a tomato.

I made this recipe for a light meal while visiting Mexico. Everyone enjoyed this after a hot day on the beach.

Delicious balance of flavors and textures. If you blanche the nopales, they are not too slimy. My husband LOVED this recipe and I will be making it for company in the future and might try it with green beans next time, just for fun!

The salad was overall quite tasty, but I'm not a fan of cactus (and I made this in Arizona, where the cactus is generally more reliable, not Boston, where I don't know if I could even find cactus). It's just kind of on the slimy side, and threw off the texture. However, the recipe is still a keeper, I'll just use green beans next time. The flavors were delicious together. I also added some jicama and radichio, which gave it more crunch.

This is a great refreshing summer or picnic-type salad. We used green beans instead of cactus and substituted turnip for the radish. To blanch the beans, I threw them in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, drained them, and then threw them in a bath of cold water/ice. Worked perfectly. I'd love to try it with cactus sometime.

Napolitos salad has long been a favorite of mine. I use bottled cactus, it's easier. I increased lime juice to 1/4 cup and made a dressing out of the lime juice, garlic, oregano, olive oil, added a couple of jalapenos chili and put it through the blender. Add a little of the cooking liquid from the shrimp if dressing is too thick. Has good kick.
