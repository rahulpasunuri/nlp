My family raves about this dish. It has become my teenagers' favorite meal. I double the onions and gherkins.

May want to experiment with the duck (be very careful not to burn it). Maybe peppercorn is just not our thing, I don't care for the taste when you bite into it.

This recipe is delicious, but the sauce just needs a little corn starch!
