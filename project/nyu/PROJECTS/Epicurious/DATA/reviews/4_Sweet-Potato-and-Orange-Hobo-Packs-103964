I seem to be the lone dissenter. This was ok for a one-off, but no one asked for it again. I can think of better ways to grill/cook sweet potatoes.

After making this for a birthday bbq, I (and every other member of my family) decided that there will never be another bbq that we don't make this. It was delicious.I omitted the raisins and they honey, and also made three smaller "hobo packs" instead of one large one. Preparation was simple, there was virtually no cleanup, and the food itself recieved rave reviews. Will definitely make again!

I really loved this recipe, however, it was quite difficult doing this in one huge packet,so I did it in individual packets. If you are only serving 3-4 people, you definetly want to cut the recipe in half. This would be wonderful year round but would be great at thanksgiving as well. The flavors go together really nicely and the oranges when grilled become almost candied. Very very yummy

Simple dish, great flavors, although the oranges and onions cooked a lot faster than the sweet potatos and I had a hard time keeping them from burning while the potatos finished cooking!

I'm pretty sure the peels are left on to give the whole dish flavor while cooking...

This recipe was delicious! I made it for 2 people, so used 2 potatoes, 2 onions. I cooked it for about 22 minutes, and it was perfect. I'm not sure I undestood about the oranges... you're supposed to leave the skin on??? I peeled mine. Anyone care to tell me what it tastes like with the skin?

I made a one-person version of this in the toaster-oven using one sweet potato, one medium red onion and one orange, with a half handful of raisins. It got a bit charred because I was on the phone during the last 25 minutes, but, aside from cleaning the pan, that was okay, kind of tasty in fact. Here are my thoughts about doing it again. I'd definitely bump up the onion level; the red onion was absolutely delicious cooked this way. At least one onion per potato. I think I'd slice the orange a bit thicker, and then halve the slices. Skip the honey; all the ingredients are sweet and you don't need it--the last-minute lemon, on the other hand, is terrific. I appreciated the pepper in the dish. My feeling is that you could shave 10 or 15 minutes off the cooking time, but perhaps that was because I was cooking only one potato. (A big one, though.) Finally, as others have said, you don't need *nearly* that much fat! I used a tablespoon of butter and one of olive oil (but don't forget, one potato, not eight).

A wonderful dish -- sweet, tender, with fascinating flavors -- even with much less fat than asked for in the recipe.

First made it on the grill with some ribs and the flavors were a great match. Second time, made them in the oven along with Duck. It turned out great - I would absolutely recommend this as an alternative to any other potato dish, especially on the grill.

I made this recipe in the oven. The onions carmelized and the sweet potatos were moist and tender. The flavors were wonderful and even the children enjoyed this sweet flavorfull dish.
