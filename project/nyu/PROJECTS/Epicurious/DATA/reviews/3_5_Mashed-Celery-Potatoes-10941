The flavor was great. My Thanksgiving guests gave it a thumbs up. I used about half a celery bunch, and extra butter, perhaps to supplement the 2% milk I used.

These were a surprise hit. I thought the recipe was strange too, but it was recommended elsewhere on this site. You definitely want to make sure they are served very warm.

This is such a great recipe. You may think it's strange to put celery with potatoes but the flavors of the sauteed celery match perfectly. I served it with sauteed beef fillets topped portabello mushrooms and drizzled with truffle oil. It was a perfect blending of flavors

Came out just as you would want -- essentially the texture of mashed potatoes, but with the flavor of celery. Boiled the potatoes and then dried them in the pan, used the mini-chop to puree the celery since we decreased the recipe. Would reheat them a bit on the stove, since they were slightly cooler than I wanted.
