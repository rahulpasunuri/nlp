This recipe was great. I made it with flounder I had in the freezer that was a little past its prime, however the sauce was good enough that it was delicious.

I have made this recipe several times. I accompany the dish with the small grain black rice from Japan or rice called forbidden rice (which is slightly purple). The yellow fish, dark rice and bright red chutney is so beautiful and really fills a plate. Make extra chutney so you can really blend it into the rice. Very popular dish with my husband and friends.

I started with this recipe - failed miserably (it was too heavy for my taste - fish and tomato!)Then I followed up with a visit to Los Angeles and the Bombay Cafe. My father and I disliked everything we tried...including the tea! My father is from Punjab and together we cook authentic Punjabi meals all the time. It was disappointing to read such a glorious review and then to be so disappointed. There seems to be an abundance of great Indian resturaunts in Chicago (on Devon Avenue) that weren't even mentioned.

I made this after returning from a trip to India when it first appeared in Bon Appetit July '97. I really liked the exotic flavor of the tomato chutney. I pan seared the fish instead of grilling and it was very good.
