I made this sorbet to serve between a cheese course and dessert for our Christmas dinner. The flavor is intense and the color is beautiful. Very easy to make.

I have made this sorbet the past two Thanksgivings. Once I used it as a palate cleanser between the first course and main course and once I used it as a dessert with candied orange peel. I think it is a light, refreshing recipe.

I made this for a refreshing treat after all the heavy dishes at Thanksgiving, It was a wonderful alternative to the regular ice cream that accompanies pies. It was delicious! A treat that will become a tradition at all our Thanksgivings from now on!
