The presentation of this dish is so delightful that my husband actually took a photo. Creating the corn husk boats was easier than I expected. The pepper jack adds a nice little punch of heat. I added some chopped red pepper and fresh basil for color and flavor. Also, a teaspoon of white (no discoloration) balsamic vinegar. It was a great side dish with grilled steak and marinated cherry tomatoes.

This is an excellent summer recipe. To save time, I make it in a husk-lined casserole. It still looks great, and takes less time. I also add a chopped jalapeno and a minced clove of garlic. Delicious!

I make this all the time, and have since the recipe came out. It is a family favourite both with fresh and frozen corn. Usually it is served casserole style and I cut down on the cheese, adding some hot peppers to the mixture instead. Easy, good and always popular!

Great flavor and visual appeal make this one of my favorites dishes. And it is very easy to put together.

Just about every summer I think of this recipe. After a few summers of going without, I made this for company the other night. Everyone loved it. It's a nice change from some of the more expected summer side dishes and serving it in the husk makes it extra special.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 10 people. It was time consuming - but now that I've done it, I would be able to do it faster the next time. It takes a while to figure out how to get that corn out of the husk without screwing it up. Anyway - I suggest that you buy a few more pcs. of corn than you need. I'm used to picking my corn out by pulling a bit away from the very top to make sure there are no bugs, or to see if the corn looks good. This is not an option in the making of this corn, as you want the whole thing to be in tact. After doing about 4-5 ears, I had it pretty well figured out. Still time consuming though. Anyway, my sister, who is a professional chef was here for dinner (she owns a restaurant in Santa Fe)- I wanted to make something impressive and good. This was a WINNER!!! I did add more cheese and more onion. She asked for the recipe and will be serving it for a sit down black tie affair that she is catering next week. Not only does this tast good, but it is just sooooo impressive! Try it - You'll like it!!!

This was pretty good. Looked great and boyfriend really enjoyed it. I found that I actually liked it better before you baked it.

I love this recipe, and it is especially nice for company. Everyone is so impressed with their own little boat! I like to add some rinsed black beans to the veggie mixture or serve rice and beans on the side for complete protien. Add a first course of vegetarian torilla soup and an easy caramel flan for dessert, and you have an impressive, company-worthy summer vegetarian feast!

Great results. The filling is also good in zucchini boats or baked casserole style. Nice that it can be prepared in advance and baked just before serving. A keeper!

A friend at work made this for our potluck and we all raved - so I came to the site to get the recipe. If you like corn, you will love this dish. The boats made out of husks made for an impressive presentation. She omitted the zucchini - which I thought was a good move.

We all loved it. I made it the day before and baked it the next night. It was very easy.

This was the highlight of our Fourth of July barbecue. It's a little fussy to do, but fun and worth the trouble. It tastes as good as it looks.

This one is awesome and is a lot easier to make than it may sound. Take a big piece of outer husk and invert it (inner side down) inside the boat to make it hold together better and provide a nice solid suface to eat off.

This recipe has been a hit everytime I make it. Our extended family has a competition every summer for who can outdo the others. The pickiest eaters loved this. When you need to save time, you can do the whole thing and just put into a casserole dish and it's equally as good but I must say, the presentation in the husks blows everyone away. Top notch!!!

this dish was excellent.If your guests like spicy dishes this is the talk of the evening.It was very easy to do and the colorful corn made a statement on the table.

My husband requests this all summer long whenever we are entertaining. The fact that he's not a huge fan of corn, and actually dislikes zuchini should say it all.

This dish defines summer fun. Relatively easy to prepare and an outstanding, colorful presentation. Never fails to impress our dinner guests.

The presentation is definately the high point of this dish. But next time I would add some chopped red bell peppers for an even more dramatic look and some needed additional flavor

I have made this dish 3 or 4 times since it originally came out - both the original version from a reader and Gourmet's adaptation. Both are excellent.
