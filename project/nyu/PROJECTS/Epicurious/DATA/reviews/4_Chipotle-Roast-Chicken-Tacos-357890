The microbiologist in me hates cooking meat, especially when I have to get my hands all up under the skin. This was worth it. Very tender and flavorful. I have rarely been so excited to eat leftovers.

This is one of the moistest chickens I have ever made and so delicious. This is definitely a keeper!

I cheated entirely with this recipe, but it still turned out GREAT! I used the butter as almost as written, but without the corriander, and substituted chipotle powder for the peppers as I did not have either on hand. I chopped the onion, 1 garlic clove, and colorful bell peppers. I diced 2 chicken breasts and sauteed all with a little bit of oil and the amazing Chipotle butter and tomato paste. I cooked them, covered for about 15-20 minutes, and served them in tortillas with cheddar cheese. Yummmmm........This recipe has the roots for greatness, regardless of how you make it. Next time, I will plan ahead and make the real thing.

Very good. The chicken is moist enough that it doesn't need to broth nor the gravy.

Incredibly tender! Will use the butter for fish next time it was so tasty. Added more broth and wine and used that after the chicken was done for soup base

Yummy! I did NOT however roast a whole chicken for this recipe. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. This was a hit. I foresee this being one of my favorite "go to" recipes in the summer when it's just too hot to turn the oven on.

Thank goodness Epicurious finally decided to put chipotle, chiles, tortillas and other Mexican ingredient recipes in its correct category - Mexican, not Spanish.

Used bone-in chicken breasts and "roasted" it in the BBQ outside...it turned out very moist tasty. Paired it with the Poblano, Corn and Potato Gratin, with homemade salsa and guacamole! Have plenty of chicken leftovers for salads. Loved this!

Wow, I made this last night. The sauce is fantastic. We used hand made (lard) flour tortillas and made wraps with the chicken and avocado. A little sour cream......delicious! I will use the chicken recipe again and serve with mashed potatoes.

Delicious! Made with a store-bought rotisserie chx also, sauteeting onions then adding chx with the herbed butter. And I roasted garlic to smear in the tortilla before stuffing. Sublime flavors!

A great Sunday Roast chicken recipe. Not sure why other reviewers think it's too much trouble for tacos!!! Tacos are only as good as the ingredients that go in them. The gratin featured in the menu was a great side as well.

The chicken was great. I agree with the other reviewers who said that it seemed like a lot of work just for shreaded chicken in tacos. I found that the taco components overpower the flavor a bit. Next time, I think I'll just roast the chicken and eat it as is. I also made the gratin, but wasn't a big fan of it. I also made the tostados later in the week and thought they turned out well...

Made this last night. House smelled so good while this roasted. Thought it was a lot of work for the end product ~ shredded chicken. Everyone ate it but noone was terribly excited.

This was great! I did not make tacos out of it however. I roasted the chicken pretty much in accordance with the directions, except I just chopped onions in to rather large chunks, and then just stirred them around in the roasting pan along with the seasoned butter. Also cut the amount of chipotles a bit. I served with Spanish rice and the chipotle cranberry sauce that's also a recipe on Epicurious.

Made exactly as written, along with the gratin from the magazine menu -- fantastic! We didn't find it spicy at all although there is a nice pepper flavor. Next time will add some heat, at least in condiment form, and more garlic (the roasted garlic is so mild you can put a whole clove in each taco).

Wow... made this last night along with the corn, poblano & potato gratin that was included in article. I followed the recipe exactly & it was amazingly good. The chicken is moist & not overpoweringly spicy. The roast onions, garlic & pan sauce really make the tacos extraordinary. I made this for just my husband & myself, so we'll be having it again tonight, plus the tostadas later in the week. I'm thinking the leftover chicken would be really good in tortilla soup too.

Spicy and delicious. Seemed a little silly to roast a whole chicken just to make tacos from it, but good nonetheless. The roasted onions were fantastic. All these tacos need is a scoop of guac and sprinkling of queso fresco. Yum!

We made a variation of this recipe by using chicken thighs and other boneless parts cut into 1 in squares, then cooked with the spices over medium-high heat in a pan. Use 1 tsp of chipotle butter to cook chopped onions in the pan for two minutes, then add the chicken with the rest of the butter/spice mix and garlic. Cook until chicken is slightly browned. Add 1/2 cup white wine sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth, then continue cooking until liquid is gone. We used this as filling in soft shell tacos with cheddar, a spoonful of plain yogurt, guacamole, some cilantro leaves and cut leafy greens. Very spicy and very good!
