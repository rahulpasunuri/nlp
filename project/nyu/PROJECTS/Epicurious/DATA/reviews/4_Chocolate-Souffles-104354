My first ever attempt to make a souffle and these were very easy and crazy good! My family devoured them! I brought them to my brother and sister in laws for dinner, made them ahead, and baked them off there...amazing!

Mistake proof souffle, who thought there was such a thing? I made this with my French 12 class and they came out wonderfully. Quality of the chocolate (obviously) makes all the difference, but was delicious even using good quality chocolate chips. I also cut the recipe down by 3 for smaller batches and it still (surprisingly) worked out. Good solid recipe that would lend itself to variation (orange, coffee, rum etc.)

I had tried Gordon Ramsay's recipe which is almost the same and I found this one on Epicurious while I was looking for advice concerning the cooking time. Ramsay says 6-8 minutes which doesn't seem to be enough (the soufflé rises, but it tastes like the batter it's made from, just warmed up). This recipe is much clearer, describes more steps and the cooking time is correct.

THis recipe is exceptional! I was glad to read other reviewers say they also had never tried making a soufflé before but that this recipe was the one! It was so yummy and presentation points? 10

Very easy to follow. I was surprised this recipe didn't require cooking in a water bath. It goes straight from the stove to the oven so that made it easier. The final product is very chocolatey, rich, and not overly sweet. I made the mistake of not filling up all the way to the top, instead I only filled up 3/4 of the cup and it didn't poof the way I wanted. Still, it was very tasty. I dusted some powdered sugar on top for a nice presentation.

Fantastically easy! This is a great recipe for the novice souffle maker. I wasn't sure how thick "thick" milk/corn starch is, but after it boiled, and I stirred for a while, I went on with the recipe. Souffles still turned out wonderfully, so I'm happy. I'd recommend this for chocolate-lovers who want a new dessert. Make it!

Very easy and quick to make. I made these for a dinner party and filled 4 large ramekins and kept in the fridge until just before baking. They came out wonderfully. When they say fill to the top, they really mean all the way to the top if you want them to puff out over the ramekin itself. Not too sweet and holds its shape well. Big hit.

The recipe would have easily filled up 8 of my 6 ounce souffle cups. I made the chocolate base earlier in the day using whole milk as listed in the recipe. It is very helpful to have the souffle cups prepared ahead of time. My guests enjoyed the beating of the egg whites and watching me fold, blend and then fill the cups. They cooked in 20 minutes and puffed up beautifully for a dramatic presentation. I dusted with powdered sugar and served with a creme anglaise on the side. These are very chocolaty, with a nice moist texture and not too sweet. Will make these again!!

Very easy to make, got rave reviews. I used fat free milk instead of whole milk and it still worked. Try it with pistachio ice cream and some whipped cream!

I tried this recipe because it could be prepared in advance. I also had to double it to accommodate a crowd. This dessert was OUTSTANDING! I used bittersweet chocolate instead, and dusted it with powdered sugar right out of the oven. A real crowd-pleaser with a huge WOW factor. I will definitely do this again for future dinner parties. Don't be intimidate...it's REALLY easy.

This souffle took longer than 15 minutes to make (perhaps because I cooked it at a high altitude and didn't adjust the oven temp), but I was very pleased with the results. It was good and chocolatey but not very sweet so I was happy to have made some creme anglaise to pour over it.

Made this for valentine's dinner. I had never made one before and it turned out great. Made as written and did about one hour ahead and refrigerated for 45 minutes.

i thought it was really good, ive never had a souffle before so this was a good start, easy to make, just had one problem, the cornstarch got clumpy when i mixed it with the milk, very rich which isnt bad. i would probably make it again

This is a good recipe. But it didn't make enough to get to the tops of 6 3/4 cup ramekins, so they didn't puff up as high as they should have. Delicious, easy, make ahead, perfect. I even messed up at several stages (cornstarch didn't seem to dissolve right, chocolate seemed to break a bit upon mixing w/milk, egg yolks may have clumped a bit when added to chocolate). Nonetheless, it was delicious so don't worry about your skills.

Really easy. These were absolutely gorgeous coming out of the oven - looked like tall brown chef hats! I even goofed while making them, didn't let the milk cornstarch mixture thicken, and still turned out great. Made 6 - 7oz and 3 - 4oz souffles. Perfect for a gluten-free diet.

This recipe was great. I made it for a friend's dinner party. It was perfect because I could make the "batter," transport it a few hours later, and bake it at their house. It worked out well, and it was a big hit.

I made this recipe several evenings ago, and it was fabulous! Wonderful flavor, texture, and appearance. I made a whipped topping by combining heavy whipping cream, bittersweet cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and godiva liquor--everyone was delighted!

All the dinner guests were wowed! And they were so easy, and I was shocked that I could actually make them ahead of time and pop them into the oven after dinner was over. You can double this recipe... just make sure you beat the egg whites enough. Also, because they took up 2 shelves in the oven, the souffles on the top shelf needed an extra 5 minutes. You know they're done when they've puffed up above the edge of the ramekin. My guests plopped vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top.

This recipe for Chocolate Souffle is the Best! Very, very easy. Being able to make them ahead of time takes the stress out of the process.

My first souffle! Easy and fullproof, but if you want something really beyond compare go try the swiss toblerone souffles in this website. They are worth all the time and anxiety!

This recipe was a hit in our house! You can make it in advance, which makes it a great choice for a dinner party dessert. I have served it in the ramekin, and also I have inverted it onto plates and added berries and cream. Foolproof!

Scrumptious! I think souffles are always hard because of the timing issue, so I tried putting these in the fridge like recommended for about a half hour before baking. They didn't seem to "puff up" or get as "light" as I thought they should, but they were still delicious and my girlfriends raved. I will have to try them again without prerefrigeration to see if that helps.
