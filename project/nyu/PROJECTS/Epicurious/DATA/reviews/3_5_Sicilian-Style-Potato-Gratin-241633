Very easy and good. I think the problem with some who found it too soupy may have to do with how thickly the potatoes are cut. They should be very thin so the starch comes out and thickens the dish.

I made this recipe for a small dinner party. It was a hit, even with the picky eaters. For those that are not fans of capers, you really can't taste them distinctly. They add a savory flavor without being overpowering. I used 3 lbs of russet potatoes and 2 1/2 c onions, Increased the capers and cheese very slightly to keep the proportion of incredients consistent with recipe, except that I decreased the chieken broth by about 1/4 c. Used parmesan as I couldn't find romano pecorino. Added some asiaggo to the parmesan sprinkled on top in the last step. Will definitely make again.

it was ok at best, I will make it again because I like the idea. maybe some scallions, and yukon gold potatoes would work better, but it was ok.

I have made this time and again and it's amazing. My go to recipe for Easter. I've never had a problem with it being soupy or watery. The broth turns to a creamy sauce without added fat. Since the amounts of potatoes used may differ try using just enough broth to not quite cover the potatoes. My favourite potato recipe by far - no changes or substitutions.

This was OK. 2 C chicken broth is way too much. It was quite soupy. I could have put a little more salt in it. I would also have liked more capers. I didn't really taste them in it. I would get an occasional bite that was fantastic but otherwise it was average but has potential.

I've made this a couple of times. I add different cheeses also and for easter I put in roasted poblanos. It was a huge hit as it always is.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was sooooo great! Everyone at the table loved the dish and went back for seconds! There was nothing left! I do not know what the others did to their dish to make it too salty or too watery, but mine came out PERFECTLY! It was the best potato gratin dish that I've EVER eaten and loved the complex flavors of the capers and Romano. The potatoes were perfectly cooked - not too mushy, not undercooked and the fact that it was cream-free was a MAJOR plus.

This was so very average. I love using my super-cool mandoline but that was really the only redeeming quality about this recipe. I was excited about making this because it's exponentially less cheesy and fattening than those recipes that call for buckets of cheese and heavy cream. I made it for a dinner party and followed reviews and the recipe and was just so underwhelmed by it; my guests were kind about it as I voiced my own critical opinion but there was a lot left on plates and an embarassing amount left in the dish. I cook a LOT and can say with a fair amount of certainty that, to my taste, no amount of futzing with this recipe will ever make it dinner party worthy. I won't ever make this again; there's a reason the cheesy, creamy ones get all the great reviews!

This was great, and very different! I used 1 1/4 c. broth and it was plenty. I also don't think it was too salty, unless you're watching your salt or are particularly salt-averse. The downside of this, though, is that it takes a longish time, both to cook and to assemble.

Rating: 2
Overall a good dish and I would make it again. Next time fewer capers and less liquid.

Rating: 1
This is a very salty dish. Capers overpower this dish with their crispness. Reducing the capers to 2 tablespoons may help. The Pecorino Romano works in tandem with the capers to give the dish an unyielding salt assault. Parmesan may be more suitable with the capers.

We liked this a lot, and it was nice knowing that we got a very tasty potato gratin without all of the calories that usually come with it. I cut back on the chicken stock as others had suggested and added some chopped red bell pepper for color. I also parboiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes to cut back on the cooking time. This one's a keeper.

My husband & I really like this - I always add a little less butter, and more cheese (usually a combo of 1/3 Romano & 2/3 parmesan) and more garlic and pepper. I haven't had a problem w/too much broth - just cook it a little longer if necessary to evaporate it. We love capers, but be careful with the type and quantity. I've found larger (& cheaper ones, i.e. Costco) are much saltier, and I use less than the recipe calls for or it's just too overpowering. My husband comes from a cream/butter/cheese Gratin background, and this is a healthier substitute that he really likes, and I make this on the holidays in lieu of mashed potatoes with all the cream and butter. Very good re-heated leftovers.

I love this recipe. I'm always looking for a light dish to go with fish and this is perfect with halibut, salmon, and other stronger fish. The recipe does take some time, figure about 30 minutes of prep added on to the cooking time. I use veggie stock instead of chicken and use both cups and despite other reviewers comments I have not experienced issues with too much liquid. And please don't skimp on the capers, otherwise it tastes a little dull. Will definitely be making it again.

First of all: why is two forks classified as a "good" recipe? I'm not giving this two forks because it was a good dish; because it was not! I would think that at 50% it would be a high F. Anyhow, the capers in this recipe destroyed the taste of the potatoes. If you choose to make this, hardly use any salt since capers and chicken broth (even low sodium) have more than enough salt.

Rating: 4
Following other reviews, I reduced the broth to one cup; however, I think it could still be reduced from there, depending on how wet you like your gratin potatoes. I used asiago since it's what I had on hand. This dish was delish! Will make again.

Excellent easy dish. I used red potatoes instead, and felt they worked very well.

Rating: 0
I followed the other reviewers' advice and only added 1 cup of stock. I don't know how you could possibly make this with 2 cups. I also uncovered it after an hour or so of cooking. I think I probably used a little more cheese than the recipe called for (because I love it). It turned out really good, browned to perfection on top and bottom. And I agree that it was even better the next day. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This was great. As per other people's reviews, I reduced the liquid, used only one cup of broth, and more cheese, maybe 3/4 cup altogether. (didn't measure, just grated a bunch) Also, since I like garlic, just as the onions were done, I added two large cloves, chopped. I made this in a cast iron frying pan. Loved the unusual taste of the capers. Better than I expected.

I agree with the cook from Chelmsford. This is Sicilian cooking. NOT potato gratin with cream etc. I made this, following the recipe and it was EXCELLENT. It was not watery. The only tweak I would do is add a few more capers just because we really like them.

Had some trouble with this recipe: I attempted to 1 1/2 the recipe and had some serious liquid issues. At the end of the cooking time at 350 it still looked very liquidy. I had to turn it up to 450, after which after 20 minutes I got scared and turned it to broil (I had $50 worth of filets sitting getting cold). So I recommend using less liquid and keeping an eye on it throughout the hour long baking step. The end result: the dish was pretty good, I enjoyed the caper and potato flavor, and the potatoes were surprisingly firm considering they cooked for 1.5 hours. This recipe probably is misleading in its title as a Gratin..the net result for me was more of a scalloped potatoes type of a dish...very light. Overall, this recipe took 3 hours start to finish...I will not make it again for that reason; otherwise, the results were average.

I am commenting on the comments rather than the recipe itself. Pecorino Romano is not Parmesean. Also, the point of the "Sicilian- Style" title to the recipe is that it does not have milk products in it and it does have capers. If you want a classic gratin, just go to Julia Child.

Rating: 2
I think the reason my family wasn't "wowed" by this dish was my fault -- all I had on hand was Kraft Parmesan cheese in the green can. It also wasn't very creamy like we prefer it; I would make it again with milk instead of chicken broth. But overall it's a recipe worth keeping.

I will definitely make this again! My husband raved about this recipe and said it was even better the next day. I cooked it uncovered for 30 minutes to allow additional browning and let it sit 15 minutes before serving.

Taking from other reviews, I added garlic & herbes de provence, used 1 cup of broth & added extra cheese to each layer. I also uncovered it for the last 30 minutes of cooking time. Excellent!

dioggi from DC... it would be beneficial if you actually made the receipe before reviewing. We don't care so much about your hopes as much as the final product. This was a great receipe if you remove the cover ahead of time and let sit before serving.

This was a big hit with everyone. I did make the following adjustments: added a little more cheese to each layer, reduced the broth and cooked uncovered for 30 minutes. Will make again for sure.

After doing some quick research on "potato gratin" recipes, it seems that oven temperature is usually 375 - 400 and the gratin is uncovered for about half the oven time. This may make a huge difference in the "soupy" and "bland" color and taste of the gratin as described by so many reviewers. Also, a gratin needs to rest before serving in order for the liquid to be absorbed. I did this research before making this version, but will now give it a try. My forks represent my hopes!

I thought this was pretty good. I did add garlic and drizzled a little cream over the top. It does need to bake for longer...to brown as well as soak up the fluids. It was even better the next day!

Can anyone tell me what I did wrong? This was a soupy mess. None of the cheese within the layers stayed put. Everything was swimming in broth. I ended up with basically boiled potatoes in broth. One of my top 10 worst kitchen disaster.

I made this w/only 1 cup of chicken broth and it was too soupy.I also added a clove of minced garlic toward the end of sauteing the onions.The flavor was really nice but I'll have to play around and do some "tweaking" with the liquid ingredients. I will try this again, hopefully it can be fixed.

As with many other reviewers, I found that there was too much broth and not enough browning. It's hard to believe that this recipe was tested as is. But I would make it again. I used more capers, well-rinsed. I think one should remove the foil after about 45 minutes, not 1 hour and 10 minutes. Be generous with the cracked pepper and with the garlic rubbed on the dish.

Pecorino Romano adds a great tanginess to a gratin of plain russet potatoes. Added some thyme to make it an even more special treat

Very good. I agree that it needs more than 15 minutes in the oven--both to get nice and bubbly and to absorb the broth. Garlic is an excellent idea, and some herbs sprinkled on top at the end would make it more attractive.

Blech. I was surprised to see all the good reviews here. My result was pasty, and--with the exception of way too much salt-- tasteless. I thought it was very strange to add all that chicken broth. Not only did it end up as sort of a soupy mess in the bottom of the pan, but pouring it in rinsed all the carefully layered ingredients off the potatoes. I'll take the yummy full-fat version, thanks anyway.

This is easy and delicious. One guest thought it had butter and cream since it is rich. Capers are a great addition.

We loved this! A much healthier but still delicious version of gratin. Be careful of the salt, because the capers are already very salty. Agree that it's better the next day, and will probably add a minced garlic clove or two next time. Will make again.

Wonderful recipe. Delicious, lighter version of potato gratin. I have to disagree with the cook from syracuse. If you use a very good parmesan cheese and capers, the dish is quite flavorful. This dish came relatively guilt free. I have already passed it on to several friends.

Rating: 4
I think this is wonderful and am making for the second time. However, I have a commercial type duel fuel range and after 15 muntes the gratin was still very pale. It took at least 30 minutes to become a little brown on the top. This happened the first time as well and I am wondering if it is the cheese I am using. Thoughts anyone?

For all the effort put into this recipe, I found it bland and boring. It needs more seasoning of some type.Perhaps more garlic and a variety of cheeses would help this. I will not make this again.

Made this for dinner last night and both my husband and I loved it. Followed the recipe as is, except eliminated the kosher salt...we both have high blood pressure and thought there was enough flavoring from the cheese and capers. It really wasn't missed, but neither of us use a lot of salt anyhow. This paired very nicely with the pork tenderloin with bourbon and dijon sauce that we had as a main.
