I use boneless chicken breasts and slice horizontal and pound thin (paillard)and then I grill the chicken. Add a little dijon mustard and touch of honey to the arugula. Then it becomes a similiar dish to the at Nordy's cafe which is so popular!

This was a pretty yummy dish for something that was so simple to make. I was worried about my oven from the previous reviews, but it was fine. The only comment I have is that after 25 mins the chicken was still raw! I had to leave it in for an additional 25 mins which dried it out a tad.

Tasty, easy recipe for a mid-week meal and healthy too!

Easy to make, and yummy. It's nothing exceptional but makes a good dinner when you're pressed for time.

I didn't prepare the arugula part of the recipe, just the chicken, as this was a "I have thawed chicken breasts, now what" night. The chicken was very good -- moist and flavorful. However, beware that the balsamic/olive oil combination will make a mess of your oven, and will smoke badly. I have to assume this is due to the high sugar content of balsamic vinegar. I had to self-clean the oven immediately so that my oven would be useable again. I think I'm going to try this on the gas grill next time (using an indirect heat method -- hot fire on one side of the grill, burners off under the chicken), but I definitely will prepare it again.

My husband and I love this recipe. I try to include it once a week in my meal planning. It is delicious.

I made this with boneless, skinless breasts that I coated with the dressing, then grilled. It looked and tasted great--an easy dinner to include in our regular weeknight rotation.

It was good, but not outstanding. Definitely should have lined my pan with foil as the marinade really just wrecked my pan as it burned into a charred and smoking ruin. That alone really spoiled my enjoyment of the chicken.

Made this...didn't cut chicken off bone. It was delicious. Made it again and cut chicken off the bone as indicated. More delicious. Cooking it a high temperature for a short time makes the chicken so juicy and delicious, but it sure plalys havoc with your oven. Lots of splattering. I used very expensive balsamic vinager in the dressing and it makes all the difference. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did. sbr

made last night, partner loved it, I used arugula from the garden and some asst greens I had. Feta instead of parmesan, chicken was juicy and flavorful. Great summer dinner. Served with French Potato salad and some steamed cauliflower.

Good flavor, and super easy. Set my convection oven to 425 and chicken might have started to char after 30 minutes had I not checked on it. Served with a simple side of steamed green beans tossed with a hazelnut oil, and sea salt.

This was really yummy. Next time I think I will use a little less olive oil and a little more vinegar.

Like the previous cook i added a bit of thinly sliced red onion to the salad and kept the rest the same. I just love arugula! Really delicious, easy to make and quick.

Don't like arugula and prefer dark meat poultry. Think this would work better with romaine and chicken thighs. Also would consider adding another side, such as pasta for the menfolk.

Delightufully Mediterranean. I removed the skin of the chicken for health reasons, it was very good all the same. I also added fresh, sliced mushrooms and some lettuce to the salad; it was delicious!
