Justine is right about the gas. I like to make this soup when my mother-in-law comes to visit.

Amazing that so much garlic could make possibly the blandest soup I've ever had. Forget this recipe.

The soup was boring but the after effects were horrible. I had gas for the next 12 hours. Not worth the trouble.
