I don't understand all of the good reviews. I thought this sauce was too sugary. It was easy to make but I threw the leftovers out.

Very easy and extremely tasty. I ended up eating the leftovers by the spoonful!

Delicious taste and a breeze to prepare. I would never again simmer the can in the pot, I forgot to add water one time and the can exploded! I had hot, sticky caramel all over the kitchen, but at least I didn't burn myself...too dangerous! This will be my only Dulce de Leche recipe from now on.

Yum! I read all the reviews & claims, and was particularly interested with what the Argentinians said. Nevertheless, the sauce is very good whether it's "authentic" or not. Warmed, over any dessert it is great!

I used this one as the ingredient in Dulce De Leche Cheesecake Squares recipe from this site. It's very good and easy (much safer than the heating a can of sweetened condensed milk)!

Absolute heaven. So stinkin easy it should hardly count as cooking! But so divine I could eat it by itself as some others suggested doing. We had it over Vanilla Gelato. YUM!

My husband is from Argentina. He and all of his friends were very impressed with the fact that I made this. No one could b elieve that I was telling the truth at first! So easy and so versitile. My husband eats it on crepes, bananas, pancakes, ice cream, etc. His favorite treat in the world is my pumpkin cheesecake with this drizzeled on top. If my husband, mother-in-law and all of their friends can't tell its not "real" dulce de leche, neither will yours!

To make the perfect dulce de leche sauce.. simmer a can of condensed milk(unopened and totally submerged) for at least 3 hours. cool, open & combine with a small amount of whipping cream (to thin). perfect every time. you can do this ahead of time to save time.

The real Dulce de Leche is prepared with milk, sugar and a touch of baking soda for color. What you call Dulce Leche Sauce is caramel. Different flavor an texture!!!

AMAZING. A delisous dish, but mine didn't boil down at all, it actualy grew, so fair warning: use a bigger pot then you think you need. Great on bannanas.

This sauce is absolutely divine. I made it to top the Mascarpone Cheesecake and it was the perfect accompaniant. The leftovers afforded me the opportunity to taste that it was also perfect with Edy's Vanilla Custard Ice Cream. I imagine that it would be a wonderful topping with almost any dessert. You would be denying yourself a great pleasue by not trying it.

Well, all I can say is YUM!! I used this on the Pecan-Caramel Cheesecake on this website, in lieu of the caramel topping that was provided in the recipe... My husband has been eating the leftover sauce with a spoon! There's not much else to say, except that I continued boiling the mixture for about 5 minutes after I added the evaporated milk, because I wanted more of a burned-sugar caramel taste.

Oh my. This sauce is to be eaten by itself in a bowl with a spoon. I think it's even better withOUT the cheesecake to interfere with its rich, thick -- almost chewy -- flavor and consistency. It tastes buttery even though there isn't any, and I prefer it when it's cool and still thick as opposed to warm and runny. I bet this would be great spread on a butter tart shell with carmelized apples or bananas on top.

Not going to rate, but dulce de leche is also very easily duplicated with condensed milk. Peel the label off of the can and completely immerse in a pot of water. Bring it to a boil and then let simmer for three hours - make sure it stays covered with water; you can cover the pot to reduce evaporation. Allow to cool in the water and then either use or refrigerate. Unopened, it can keep indefinitely in the fridge, so it's easy to do a couple ahead of time and keep them stored. Be sure to follow directions exactly - I've never had a problem, but I have heard of some catastrophes.
