this salad is quite bland, as another reviewer mentioned. and what's with calling it latin? the flavors in it (black bean, corn, avocado, cilantro) are specifically mexican. which is not a part of latin america.

This salad was rather bland and really needs some spicing up. I wasn't crazy about the sauce either.
