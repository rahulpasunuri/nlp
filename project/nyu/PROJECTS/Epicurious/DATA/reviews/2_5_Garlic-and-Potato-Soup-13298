This is a good way to start a soup. I used a mushroom bouillon instead of just water and regular onions instead of scallions. This gave it a bit of a heartier taste. I also threw in a bay leaf. If it is too starchy just make sure you are letting the potato's cook thoroughly in the broth or water. I really enjoyed it but there were a lot of modifications I had to make.

I hated this recipe It was WAY GUMMY and I spent longer trying to bring the flavor out than I did making it. It should be called fried potato soup because that's what it tasted like.

Not sure what to say about this recipe. For some reason I do not understand, the garlic and oil got too hot too fast and therefore the potatoes did not have a chance to absorb the garlic flavor. This meant that the soup was BLAND but adding lots of scallions, salt and pepper helped immensely. I may try making this again but being sure to cook the first three ingredients low and slow. (No, I am not a totally inexperienced cook. ;-)

This was definitely a dish of warm, garlicky goodness for a sullen winter night. I left a few tiny lumps in the potatoes and that was really nice if you go for that sort of thing.

Quick and Easy! I thought the soup was great. I added 1/4 cup of celery and some heavy whipping cream. Then topped the soup with cheddar cheese. Both my husband and I enjoyed it.

This Tasted like very starchy ,thin garlic mashed potatoes. I used chicken broth instead of water and added thyme and marjoram but it didn't help.

This is a great basic recipe for beginners because it's pretty much idiot proof and tastes great. Instant gratification for recipients of new food processors!

It was delicious, I used Yukon Gold potatos and added some chives. Wonderful and very low in fat.
