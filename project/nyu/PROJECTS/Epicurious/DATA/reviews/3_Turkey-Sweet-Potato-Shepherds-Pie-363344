I also cut the recipe in 1/2 and it still fed 5. Didn't have a banana (but can't imagine it was necessary) and added corn instead of peas. I even made this gluten-free by using tapioca flour which worked perfectly. This really was very good, even my kids loved it! Will definitely make it again.

The banana really gave this an odd taste that was completely unnecessary. I would have REALLY enjoyed it without it.

I'm a fan of the beef and potatoes style shepherd's pie, so I wasn't sure I'd like this, but I really loved this recipe. It's a great way to use up veggies. I didn't have celery but I did add corn, and finely chopped broccoli, and I thought it was very nice. Next time I might go a little heavier on the seasonings, but I'll definitely make it again. I also cut the recipe in half and it still made enough for 3-4 meals!
