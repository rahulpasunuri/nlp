This was delicious and very pretty on the plate. The truffles and chocolate sauce were the best! I make ice cream cakes a lot - here are some hints b/c yes the cake can melt fast. I like to use a round springform pan - so easy to just remove the sides. Another option is to take the ice cream pie out of the pan about 2 hours BEFORE serving and it can "firm" up while you are dining. :) I like to put the sauces in a squeeze container (like the bear honey one), which makes it easier to make "swirls" on the plate and on top of each slice. I used Premium vanilla ice cream (from Costco) which was delicious and I also used an entire 1/2 gallon. The mint sauce was delicious, but clumpy so putting it in a squeeze bottle is key.

Great dessert. All 10 of my guests loved it. A few hints - Make sure the ice cream is pretty soft before you make the terrine. Be sure to slice and serve quickly as it melts fast. Put the truffles as close to the middle of the terrine as possible. If they are too close to the top or bottom, the ice cream slices don't stay together.

Made this for dessert when my in-laws were visiting. It was very easy and extremely tasty. The presentation is beautiful. I disagree with one of the reviewers that this is not good as leftovers. My husband and I had it as leftovers the next evening and it was just as lovely as the first night. I agree the mint sauce looks "sort of like pesto" but it tastes nothing like it! I found myself seeking every last bit of mint sauce out on my plate to drag the dessert through!

This was a beautiful and delicious dessert, which I made for a 12 person dinner party. I was reluctant to add too much mint sauce but I wish that I had put more on each plate because it *makes* the dish. As the other reviewer, I used more ice-cream that the recipe called for. The only difficulty I experienced was turning the terrine out of the loaf pan and slicing it. Even though I was in the air-conditioning, the terrine was melting as I cut it. Also, this recipe serves 12 which is exactly the number of slices I needed yet, I think it the presentation would have been nicer and the dessert would have been easier to cut if this recipe yeilded 8-10 servings.

Made this for Father's Day as the finale to a delicious summer menu. We were all practically licking our plates - the presentation was outstanding and the taste was out of this world. I think the recipe would be lacking without the mint sauce - it adds both color and a wonderful minty flavor. The truffles are delicious, and best of all, the recipe is easy enough for my 4 year old to make. The hardest part is planning ahead to allow enough time to freeze and set. Will use the leftover mint sauce to make some mojitos. I used the entire 1/2 gallon of ice cream (more than what the recipe called for), but otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. I will add this to my favorites - as it is sure to be a consistent show stopper.

Very good, and excellent presentation. I served this on Kentucky Derby day, and had served mint juleps, so didn't want another mint dish. I substituted almond flavoring in the chocolate, and made a raspberry sauce. Yummy. Will try again with the mint.

Very easy to do, with a high "wow" factor. This made for a beautiful presentation, although I omitted the mint sauce. The truffles were very rich.

Very tasty and makes for an interesting presentation. But I'm not sold on the mint sauce, which was too sweet for my taste. One guest commented that it looked "sort of like pesto!"

We served this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I liked that it was so simple to make. Just a warning that this is not good as leftovers.
