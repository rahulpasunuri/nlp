While the recipe is relatively correct, it contains a basic error re the tomatoes! Naturally a traditional recipe has many variations, but this one won't really cut it. First of all, lamb knuckles won't be first choice for the meat -- rather a more tender cut. But the most glaring mistakes are the wine and the single tomato!! Malay(Cape Muslim) cooks will not cook with wine. Secondly, this recipe needs 4 - 6 or more red-ripe, peeled, chopped fresh tomatoes. The idea is to use gentle heat, and the tomatoes supply all the liquid. If correctly (gently) stewed, it will not burn, and the meat will turn a tasty reddish-brown colour in the sauce. Personally I would not add cinnamon. Also, I use a shorter method instead of all that frying and taking-out-of-the-pot. A good pinch of sugar is always added because tomatoes can be too acidic when cooked. I don't have the recipe in front of me as I type, but it's a bit too fussy to be traditional. Trad foods are normally quite simple.

Lamb knuckles look like inch thick slices of lamb shank. I assume they are some meaty party of the lamb's leg that is cut in slices. Excellent for stews and curries, with a neat round marrow bone in the centre.

Lamb knuckles? Okay, I figured I could look them up in the food dictionary on this site. No such listing. There ought to be a rule; if it's not in the food dictionary, it shouldn't be in the recipe.
