I needed a dish for vegetarians so made the salad without the shrimp. It was a hit and I'd definitely make it again.

I've made this a few times now. I've determined that it needs about 50% more garlic than mentioned here, and you can replace the fennel with chopped tomatoes. Oh, and roast your own red peppers! :)

we actually really loved this pasta as is, although we did skip the fennel. we'll try it again with the Chef's recommended changes.

I decided to check the reviews on my recipes that I submitted to the magazine because they were changed so much and I wanted you to know the original recipe was made with 15 roasted garlic cloves, fresh roasted red and yellow pepper, 25 basil leaves and no lemon juice in the pasta! The shrimp were cooked after marinating in 2 tablespoos olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and 2 teaspoons of lemon for 30 minutes. They were sauted in a non stick pan for 3 minutes, cooled then added to the salad. I didn't use fennel, I tried it after I received the issue and felt it was very bland. All of these changes gave the recipe much more flavor. I reserved 3 large cloves and added them to the oil that was tossed with the pasta, the rest were thinly sliced and tossed with the pasta and shrimp. Hope this helps!

I am definitely not a fan of bland food so after reading the review of this recipe, I decided to make some changes and it was wonderful. I used more crushed garlic - mincing doesn't bring out the flavor of the garlic. I also used fennel seed rather than fresh and I toasted that and crushed it in a mortar. I increased the amount of pinenuts and crushed them in the mortar, as well. I reduced the amount of macaroni. My husband raved! I liked it, too. Figure on at least eight to ten shrimp halves per person.

This recipe was just a bit bland. There are a lot better shrimp pasta dishes out there.

Very bland, even tho the ingredients all had lots of flavor individually. Definitely not satisfying as a main dish, but might work as a side dish for a hearty or spicy meat. I added onion, lots of salt, black and red pepper, but it still was just boring.

IT WAS GREAT
