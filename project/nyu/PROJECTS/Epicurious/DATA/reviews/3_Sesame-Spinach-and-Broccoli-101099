Sesame Oil and Seeds give it just a hint of flavor without overpowering the deliciousness of the spinach. Have made this recipe using broccoli and mushrooms - both worked well with the flavors.

Very tasty. So simple and easy. Loved the sesame oil.

I thought this was delicious, although I cooked the broccoli alot longer than recommended, as I don't like it crispy. I also added some miso broth while the broccoli cooked. I think it has a nice flavor, certainly better than just plain butter and salt.

I decided to try this despite the poorer more-recent reviews. I was surprised how much we liked it. The sesame oil and salt are key to giving this flavor, so maybe some of the people who disliked the recipe didn't use enough of those. This definitely has an Asian flavor and I think it would go well with fish and any main dish that has Asian flavors in it.

A little bit bland, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

This dish is a good start but it needs to be served over rice cooked with a tsp of concentrated veggie both. The addition of soysauce gives it that needed touch to bring it to life. Careful on the red pepper they can dominate. Classic take out taste with the additions.

This has to be THE worst recipe I have ever tried. The textures are totally different and I LOVE both broccoli AND spinach. I'd like to know what the other "cooks" that reviewed this recipe were smoking!

I don't even like spinach and I loved this (my mom will never believe it). I cut back a little on the spinach because I didn't have enough and doubled the red pepper flakes and it was delicious and super easy!

First off, let me say that I'm not a huge broccoli fan to start off with. I do try and eat it however, and this recipe seemed promising. It was very easy to make, but I found it lacked a little flavour. I wasn't sure what to add to it, either.

I also went heavy on the red pepper flakes and they didn't distribute evenly but it wasn't too bad. I couldn't find sesame seed so I used pine nuts and more sesame oil than the recipe called for to make up the difference. I also threw in some baby bella mushrooms. It's like a warm, nutty salad.

Be carefuk with the hot stuff!! We over did it. Needs to cook longer so not quite so crispy. We added pimentoes at the end for color.

Absolutely divine - the sesame flavor is wonderful. Also, very easy and quick to prepare. The only thing I would change is to add some diced or julienne red bell pepper for a splash of color.
