We use wonderful farmer's market eggs so they vary in shape, size and color but this recipe always makes lovely eggs. The condensation can make them look a little funky or the dye does goofy things but they all get eaten anyways and the color does look good. Really easy to do too!

My problem is the next day. After dyeing the eggs and drying them I place them in the refrigerator. When I take them out for Easter they're all splotchy. Condensation makes the dye run and the porousness of the shell does something. How do I make them look good?

It works! The kids have stained finger tips but thats part of the fun.
