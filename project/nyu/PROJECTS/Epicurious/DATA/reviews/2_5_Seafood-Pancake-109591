This is a great recipe. I don't know what the one reviewer who didn't like it was talking about. I've made it many times and it's always a hit. It's also good without oysters, if you prefer, and with long hot aka tiger peppers sliced up in it. Can even be made with scallions only if you don't eat seafood. Makes me want to buy "My Mother's Korean Kitchen".

I don't know what the previous reviewer's problem is. This is a terrific and tasty dish. Easy to make, too. And if you're in NY, be sure to check out Dok Suni, an excellent Korean restaurant in the East Village.

I'm a fan of seafood of almost all types. I'll not make this one again. Ma
