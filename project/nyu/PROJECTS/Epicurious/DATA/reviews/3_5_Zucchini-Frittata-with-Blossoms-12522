Very good, basic frittata recipe. Recipe implied that the blossoms should be laid decoratively on top before baking. This doesn't seem to make much sense - the blossoms are usually cooked ala frittata as well. Anyway, I didn't do that. The bell peppers are missing from the ingredients list by the way. Using slightly spicier peppers like fresh anchos is a nice variant as is including Spanish smoked paprika in the egg batter.

I grated the zucchini, rather than chopping it, and sauteed it in a non- stick wok with no oil but lots of salt and pepper. Family liked it but found it a bit bland (forgot the thyme but might try oregano and extra parmesan or even feta to boost the flavour next time). It was so easy to make as I poured all the ingredients into a 12" diameter silicone baking dish and baked for 35 minutes. Browns beautifully on top, no oil and no broiling required.

This was a great recipe for me to start experimenting with. I wanted to use Zucchini because I entered a local baking contest. I was able to get the same results from baking in a 425 degree oven for 8-10 minutes and broiling the last minute or two. It turned out great and I wond 1st place. I did add 1/2 cup of roasted red peppers instead of green peppers. I also mixed up a few other frittatas with other ingredients that my family loved. Swiss cheese, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and Canadian baccon was to die for:) Definately mix up what ever you have or think will taste good. Use this recipe as your base and have fun.

My only disappointment was some scortching on the bottom of the frittata--I left it on med. for about 15 min. because it was still so unformed??? The flavor was good and we used herbs from our garden.

This is such a great recipe, I'm surprised no one has reviewed it before! I thought it was very good, and would definitely make it again. I lost it for years, and was able to find it again via the web site, which I'm extremely grateful for.
