A new Passover staple!!!! Everyone thought these were really good and they were easy to make too! I substituted Orange Essence Craisens for Currents (couldn't find currents) and they came out fine

Does anyone know of a recipe for chremslach thatuses prunes or plums, & that has a wine sauce accompanying it? This was a favourite in my husband's household but unfortunately the recipe never was passed down.

This is a very easy and flavorful recipe. I did not use a deep fryer, nor did I measure the oil temperature, so I wasn't surprised that the heat of my pan got a little out of control and the chremslach browned VERY QUICKLY. I served them at a Passover-style brunch and told my guests that they were "Passover doughnuts." They were very misshapen and not very attractive as doughnuts go, but they were delicious. I used chopped dried cranberries instead of currants, and the lemony flavor behind all of that was especially good. Looking forward to making them next year (and will try to be more careful with the oil temp--and to make them more symmetrical)!

i was brought up in South Africa and these were always a delicious treat on Passover and at other times of the year as well. To make these less high in oil and therefore less fattening I use a non stick frying pan and coat with a small amount of butter and then I fry them umtil they are bvrown and crisp.
