What went wrong? This took two hours to make, used every implement in my kitchen, and was a big disappointment. You can't reduce 8 cups of liquid to 1.5 c. in 30 or even 40 minutes. It took a little more than an hour, and I finally got impatient and stopped at 1.80 cups because I didn't have all night. The sherry completely disappeared into the sauce; there wasn't even a hint of it. Ditto the lemon. The sauce was way too rich for us - a whole stick of butter is just too much. Next time: budget an extra hour for the reduction, either use a LOT more sherry and reduce it or stir it into the finished sauce at the end so we can taste it, and cut back on the butter. As written, this recipe was way too much work and time for what we got. I'll give it one more try with my tweaks.

I halved this recipe for 4 people & added scallops and potobello mushrooms. Added vegatable bullion to the stock for little extra flavor. Sautated mushrooms same time as onions. Waited to cook shrimp & scallops to just prior to serving. Did this in a seperate saute pan with some reserved stock and then combined everything together at finish. Served with risotto & asparagus. Fabulous!

Pretty Good... rated appropriately "delicious"... not "exceptional"... it is, after all... shrimp and "gravy". (much more gravy-like if you did what I did... forget the finishing lemon). Either way, it was pretty good. I substituted the following... I used some very strong (head-on) shrimp stock, instead of just the shells. I think this was likely an improvement to the recipe, and made the sauce much more flavorful. I put this sauce over rice, and had a side of spinach. Next time, I would remember the lemon. EASY.

Absolutely delicious. The kids helped pull the tails off the shrimp and put together the stock. It was very easy to make, just the stock takes a bit of time. I assumed too that the flour and butter were cooked together but this is not clear in the recipe instructions.

This was stunningly delicious. Though the shrimp stock was fairly time-consuming, it absolutely made the dish. I sauteed a pound of spinach and a pound and a half of sliced mushrooms and tossed them with the shrimp at the end. I served the mixture over angel-hair pasta as a one-dish meal. Really lovely flavors.

My in-laws told me this: If you want to impress family and friends, cook this again, hon. Delicioso! :-)

Very decadent. It was the first empty dish, and the most requested recipe at a bridal shower.

Well, I don't know what I did wrong, but this turned out extremely bland. With all the work involved to make it, I would never do it again. I was surprised after all of the rave reviews I'd read. I followed one reviewers suggestion and surved it with coconut rice. The rice was my favorite part of the dish.

Absolutely wonderful. Added T browned butter to punch up flavor a bit and served it over angel hair pasta - all left with recipe in hand !

This dish is off the chiz-ain- urban slang for ridiculously delicious. I urge shrimp lovers to make it.

Phenomenal. Went well on top of coconut rice. Tastes a bit like french onion soup in the best way possible.

A knockout dish! The leftovers make a great omlette...especially with some carmelized onions sprinkled on top.

Fabulous recipe!! Would not change a thing - this is also delicious over rice. Next time I will have to make two batches - this keeps very well for a few days and makes an excellent leftover dinner.
