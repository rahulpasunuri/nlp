This recipe rocks! It's so light and fluffy and scrumptous! I've made it 3 or 4 times and everyone always devours it.

This is a really great dish. Perfect for a steak dinner. And great for a dinner party.

This recipe is a twice-baked potato in a casserole dish. It is a great idea for a buffet or large number or people instead of restuffing the potatoes. You could add whatever you like in a twice-baked recipe. However, if you boil instead of baking the potatoes as some suggest then it will completely change the taste and purpose of the recipe. If you make it, bake it.

A huge success at our staff luncheon! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.

A yummy potato dish, the only change I made was instead of using just fontina cheese I used a fontina/asiago/parm blend.

This is a great alternative to regular mashed potatoes. The flavor is so wonderful that my husband (who is always salting his food) didn't ask for the salt at the dinner table! I found it easier to boil the potatoes first rather than bake them, but other than that I followed the recipe.

Delicious, easy, and very popular! Thank heavens I doubled the recipe!

Very good and simple to make. Needed something like this when you have so many other side dishes to prepare for Thanksgiving.

I doubled this recipe for an Easter dinner, to accompany roast leg of lamb. I would agree with other reviewers that the fontina cheese, while adding to the creaminess of the dish, did not give me the oomph in flavour that I would have liked. Maybe a more robust flavoured cheese next time. Nevertheless, it looked beautiful with a golden brown crust, and flecks of parsley. And the dinner guests had seconds, so that says something.

Amazing. I used a potato ricer and the consistency was perfect. Good enough for your finest meal - the compliments will fly!

Liked it... will love it with some "tweeking". I had, to begin with, added nutmeg... will add more. The fontina got lost; it was good, don't get me wrong, but if I am going to use up that many calories, I want "umph". Maybe the addition of a little Parmesan would be good.

These potatoes are just dreamy!!! Even my picky 2 year old ate them. So creamy and perfectly seaasoned. If you don't want leftovers, this is definitely the dish for you. A true keeper that I'll look forward to making again.

Yum. I forgot to buy the parsley and it was STILL Delish. Seasoned w/white pepper and salt... and boiled the potatoes instead of baking. Delish.

This is a delicious and easy dish. The cheese lends a great flavor and a different twist to this recipe.

Have made this recipe three times and have always received great reviews. Even my husband, who doesn't generally like potatoes, loved this recipe.

I boiled potatoes as I usually would for mashed potatoes, and then added the other ingredients after cooking and draining. It was easier and worked fine. I could only find Fontinella cheese, not Fontina, but it was delicious and a hit with everyone at our dinner party.

Very tasty. Served it with grilled chicken, mushroom sauce, carrots, and asparagus. I followed the recipe exactly and the results were top-shelf. One caution (this was my error not the recipe's) - I used a ricer for the mash, but slightly undercooked the potatoes. This is OK when using a masher as it gives good texture, but with a ricer it leaves the final product with a "grainy" feel. It wasn't a disaster, but next time I'd make sure the potatoes are just a little on the overcooked side if I'm going to use the ricer. Again, this was my fault not the recipe's. Overall this was excellent, would definitely make it again. Keeps well in the fridge overnight also.

I made this for a dinner party and it was gone FAST. My very picky husband loved it and so did I. It's very, very good. Make sure you cook the potatoes long enough so they are easy to mash, though. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I have prepared these potatoes twice and both times my guests raved about them. They are a wonderful change from regular mashed potatoes. My mother-in-law also made them using fat-free half and half and said there was no difference in taste or consistency.
