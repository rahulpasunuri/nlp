Great soup to make some adjustments too. I did not use the wine but rather chicken stock. Next time will make this with more potato so it has a bit thicker body. Otherwise very tasty!

Made this soup as a last minute meal for a group meeting at my house. Used gorgonzola cheese, as well as cornish hen stock from pieces from a weekend dish. Per the other reviews, I added garlic and since I had a bunch of potatoes I used three. I served it with a loaf of sonoma jack bread which everyone really enjoyed. The soup is not the most appetizing color so be sure to garnish with Italian parsley.

A very strange soup...would not make again exactly this way, although I might cut out most of the wine and substitute milk instead. Also added thyme and dill to the oil at the beginning.

Excellent soup dish. My brothers' family does not like sharp cheese so I substituted half the blue cheese with cheddar cheese. Everyone had seconds. I served it with home made White Soda Bread

My husband, not a big soup person, loved this recipe. I used homemade turkey stock and 4 smallish leeks and finished with some cream. Maybe next time I'll add some shallots. Very Yummy.

A few minor adjustments raises the rating to 4 forks: I used more leeks rather than onion, used lite cream and omitted wine, sauteed minced garlic with vegetables. I always use a good homemade stock - which makes a world of difference!

Wonderful soup. Like other reviewers, I added garlic to the vegetable saute step and added a cup of half-and-half at the end of cooking. Seasoned with salt, pepper and red pepper. Added cheese directly and used an immersion blender. Husband and I loved it. Teenage son though the flavor was too strong.

Absolutely fabulous!! Simple to make. The leftovers kept very well. I just cooked some more bacon.

Wow! This is hearty, yummy,unique and easy. I had to use regular broth and I was a little short on it, so I used about a 1/4 of cream to make up the liquid difference. Honestly, we just loved it as it appears, peppered it at the table , and gobbled it up. We will be making this again, real soon.

As written, this would have been something Buffy and Jody would have liked. Adding mass amounts of pepper (red & white) salt & paprika made this worthy. I would not mix the cheese in again using the processor (to hard to clean)

The soup as listed is pretty good but I would reduce the amount of chicken broth and substitute cream, add more blue cheese, and add some spices (e.g., a little salt, pepper, and garlic, at a minimum).

I've made this soup several times and really enjoy it. I don't eat meat, so I just use butter. And have even used beer instead of white wine, still delicious!

To put it nicely, we just couldn't quite determine what about this soup we didn't like. It needs a lot of help with seasoning adjustments. Maybe if it were cream based instead. I like blue cheese, so this gives ideas to experiment, but this particular recipe won't grace our table again.

Reminds me of Stilton soups my husband and I enjoyed on a recent trip to London. You do need to correct the seasoning, or even add more cheese depending on how strong the cheese is.

Whoever wrote this recipe forgot one important thing...Spices! Garlic, black pepper,tons of white pepper, paprika, chicken bouillon, and then it was perfect! I had it tonight and it was wonderful and I think with the leftovers tomorrow I may add some clams. I think I have found a new recipe for clam chowder!

Looked forward to great things. Added extra blue cheese to give it more flavor. Family were divided. I thought it wasn't bad and one of my sons did as well. Others thought it OK but not "wow!" May give it one more try making a few adjustments.

My wife said that this is like eating at the Four Seasons, or some other "nifty" place in New York. I can't find any fault with that assessment.

I doubled your recipe and found it bland. I added salt - gound pepper, and approx. 1 tbs. granulated garlic - NOW YOU HAVE SOUP!

My favorite soup of all times! Absolutely fantastic! I had it for dinner last night and took it to work and had it for lunch again today! Very easy too.

Awesome!!! Very rich and flavorful. The only problem is that I would say it's only 4 servings at the most. You should make extra anyway because you're going to want to eat it all yourself.
