I have made this cake a few times now and everytime has turned out perfectly! it is the best cake i have ever had and my guests would all agree. this time I am trying something new by usuing a raspberry reduction in the centre of the cake and a white chocolate gnache with raspberry flavouring I got when used to make candies. Hopefully all goes well and I cannot wait to get started! Wish me luck fellow bakers!

I have made this recipe dozens of times. It is hands down the best chocolate cake recipe out there, for anyone looking for a rich, dense, very chocolatey cake.

Made this delicious cake with Valrhona chocolate and Valrhona cocoa because that's all I have at home. Worked out fantastically, even though Valrhona cocoa is supposedly dutch processed. Still - no worries. Halved recipe since it's just for me and my husband, made in two 9-in pans, and ate with whipped cream and raspberries. Can't go wrong with this.

Just took my cakes out of the oven and they too collapsed in the last 15 min. or so. Others reviews have said the same thing. Any suggestions as to what may have gone wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, preheated the oven, and did not open the oven during the baking process. I do a lot of cooking and baking so I can't figure this one out. I may fill between the layers with chocolate mouse as this is to be my sons birthday cake. :) Have not yet tasted the cake.

I echo all the other rave reviews. The adjustments I made - took another reviewer's advice and cut the coffee to 1 cup, and used 2 cups of buttermilk. I cut the sugar to 2.5 cups. I also made 3/4 of the frosting recipe, which was enough to fill the middle and ice the whole cake. And - I used Trader Joe's brand 72% chocolate (the big 17.6 oz bar they sell for $5). Worked perfectly - sublime flavor.

There are some issues with this recipe. I do a lot of cooking/baking and I followed this recipe to the letter, including getting Callebaut chocolate. The cakes collapsed in during the last 20 minutes of baking. The coffee flavor, instead of enhancing, is somewhat overwhelming. Yes, the chocolate flavor is good, and it delivers a moist cake, but I have never had a cake flop on me. I have also used espresso and coffee frequently as an ingredient in chocolate cakes and other desserts, and never it had it come out as such a forward and obvious taste. Thumbs down on this cake unless there is some reason it flopped that I can find that is my own fault, and if the coffee flavor can be toned down.

I have made this cake several times. It always gets great reviews. It tastes even better on the second day. Very rich, very moist. Reminds me of my Aunt Loretta's chocolate cake growing up. Umm Umm good.

Now this is the deep dark dense and moist chocolate cake recipe I have searched for! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I was able to use (2) 9" pans. Maybe my pans are taller because I had no spillover and ended up with a nice tall cake. Mine baked for 1 hour 8 minutes. If you follow the recipe, and your oven is accurate, I fail to see how you end up with a dry cake! Will most definitely make again for special occasions.

Makes a very good, dense chocolate cake in the American style (as opposed to European style). It is slightly more crumbly than I like, but perhaps my farmer's market eggs were smaller than they should have been. The cake was very good the day it was made, but I like it even better now that it has aged a bit. I didn't have enough pans or time to make two separate cakes, so I used one 10" springform pan with nearly 3" high sides. The batter filled it to the brim, so I placed a cookie sheet on a lower rack to catch spillover, but there was only about a tablespoon's worth. Baking took longer, ca. 1.5 or so hours, but it worked. After cooling, I sliced it in half to create the layers. The frosting is quick and easy to throw together, easy to spread, nice and shiny, and tastes great.

This is an absolutely beautiful cake, and has been demanded for my work christmas party (and considering I'm a chef, I believe that's saying something). This cake is sublime, especially with a chocolate orange ganache (for recipe, search for dark chocolate orange wedding cake). If you can't source buttermilk at short notice, I've used half plain yoghurt and half milk with success, and adding orange zest to the mix gives it an even more lovely flavour.

Rating: 4
I don't know how kid friendly this cake is, it may be too rich for the little ones. I already have a few chocolate cake recipes I love best but I have to say this is hands down the best. The cake is moist and chocolatey. When the cake dissolves on your palate it leaves a distinct chocolate flavor behind. (Some leave a watery taste or powdery residue.) Not being a big fan of coffee and chocolate I happily read the other reviews and agree that this leaves no coffee aftertaste. The cake stuck to the pan when I removed it but a few taps on the back side and it easily slipped out, as it is quite sturdy, it remained whole. Do grease both sides of the paper liner as stated. As always the quality of ingredients makes or breaks your dish and here the chocolate is most important so don't skimp on a less expensive chocolate. You won't be disappointed.

All around excellent cake taste is great, texture is perfect - I used the correct size cake pans though & it did spill over in the oven - 2nd time I made it, I held back about 1 cup of batter & they turned out perfect

Rating: 4
BTW: 1/3 recipe makes a 24 mini cupcakes---I eat the remaining small amt of raw batter....yummers!! I'd recommend using paper liners as the cake is really tender, towards falling apart. BIG HIT! The second time I made the recipe, I was making a 1/3 of the recipe and didn't want to go to the trouble of brewing 1/2 C of fresh coffee so I used instant decaf coffee, accidently making it 2-3x stronger than my normal. BIG improvement in flavor! Highly recommend that you make really strong coffee---don't be afraid. I also add a splash of brandy or scotch (undetectible) to unlock more flavors (chemistry a la Food Network's Alton Brown's suggestion). The ganache is WONDEFUL! I topped the mini cupcakes with mini choc chips--looked nice and added a nice flavor boost.

Exceptional recipe - very moist, very rich, but not as dense as a brownie. I made this recipe for my 5-yo son, so i used only 1 cup of coffee to melt the chocolate for the batter. I made up for the missing 1/2 cup of liquid with extra buttermilk (now 2 cups). SUGAR: i reduced to 2 1/2 cups, and the cake came out perfect - still very sweet to my taste. (Next time, i'll try using just 2 cups, and probably adjust liquid down a bit to maintain proper consistency) BAKING TIME: i two used 9" forms, and should have used three. Mine were full to the rim, and overflowing, so they were thicker than intended and my baking time went up to 1 1/2 hours. Next time, i'll use the proper amount and bake just the recommended hour+. DONENESS: i took them out when the wooden stick came out barely clean - it was still getting slightly brown, but didn't pull gooey chunks of dough behind. Overall a fantastic cake - we got lots of compliments at the party. Thank you!

This cake was delicious. I made it ahead of time for a baby shower and froze it. Freezes very well. Flavor and texture were not affected by freezing the layers. Everyone raved at the end results. Rich, dark chocolate flavor and it was so moist. This is my new favorite recipe.

A simple, non-nonsense chocolate cake. Followed the recipe but followed reviewers and the cake was done at 45 min. in convection oven. Also, there is plenty of batter for extra cupcakes. Went down to 1 and 2/3 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough. Went with 1/2 all pupose and 1/2 cake and pastry flour and it was light and rich.

Unquestionably my favorite cake. I have made this at least a dozen times and have never gotten anything less than rave reviews for this wonderfully chocolaty creation. I sub hot chocolate for the coffee, and try to only use high quality chocolate for the frosting, as this cake really demands it. You will not regret making this cake.

Rating: 4
I made this for a friend's birthday with a few changes. To begin I used 2 9" pans because I didn't have 10" pans and I used the remaining batter to make a dozen cupcakes. I used decaff coffee instead of regular. And I used the marshmallow frosting recipe from the Devil Dog Cake and spread half of it between the cake layers and then used the rest to top the cupcakes. I made half the chocolate frosting recipe and applied it over the top of the cake and it was perfect. I had two people who really dislike chocolate cake say it was the best they ever ate. This is now my absolute go-to chocolate cake.

I would not recommend this for a kids party--its too rich for most kids. It easily serves 15 and is delicious. Dont be afraid of how thin the batter is; it sets well. Make it early as it frosts better after its a few hours old.

So this recipe really does not need another review, with over 1500 already. Just wanted to add that this is THE WORLD'S BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE. It has become the classic birthday cake in our family, without the ganache but with kit kats around the sides and the top covered with m & m's. (We have 3 kids). Here's a picture of what it looks like: http://www.madeinmelskitchen.com/2009/09/kit-kat-cake/

This cake is fantastic!! Extremely moist and very chocolatey. The only thing I did differently was lower the amount of sugar to 2 cups and I didn't make the ganache frosting as I didn't have time. I used a premade frosting. I made the cake for my stepfathers last minute bday party and everybody loved it. Used strawberry jam for the filling and every bite I ate I had to go mmmmmmmm. Oh and I used 2 8-in pans, since I didn't have 10 in pans, and used flower nails to make sure it cooked in the middle and then used the rest of the batter for cupcakes.

This is a great recipe that I've modified here and there depending on the occasion -- last week I cut the recipe to 1/3 to make a dozen cupcakes and accidentally used all 3oz of chocolate instead of cutting that to 1oz... and they were the best I've ever had! Also, I throw in 2T of King Arthur's Flour Black Cocoa to make them super dark and chocolatey. TODAY I made the same 1/3 recipe for 12 more cupcakes, substituting Ibarra Mexican Table chocolate for solid chocolate, and slightly cutting down the sugar (I used 1 round of Ibarra melted in the coffee, and only 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup for a 1/3 recipe) and they turned out beautifully. I'm not sure if I'm going to make a whipped cream topping for them (Mexican hot chocolate cupcakes!) or go with a dulce de leche buttercream. I guess what I'm trying to say is, this is a world class basic chocolate cake recipe that I use for every application I can think of! And yes, it's always a hit.

This is a very impressive large cake, very dark, super-chocolaty, rich and delicious. I added a thin layer of heated and strained raspberry seedless jam on top of each layer, then let it set, and continued with filling and frosting. The batter turns into solid, moist and even-topped baked layers, each one of which would be perfect on its own with a dusting of powdered sugar. The Ganache is easy and works like a dream, perfect amount to fill and frost the cake, and even enough leftover for piping rosettes. A stunning celebration cake. I also like to serve the cake with a dash of Raspberry Coulis on the side.

This is the type of recipe I have been searching for for YEARS!! SO incredibly moist and delicious. I just made it and had a piece--heaven! I am only reviewing the cake, since I made the Cook's Illustrated chocolate buttercream frosting to go with it (instead of the ganache). I was afraid the ganache would make it too rich. I almost didn't make this recipe, because I don't like the taste of coffee. In fact, I initially planned to make it without the coffee. But as I started to make the cake, I realized that if I omitted the coffee altogether, it would throw off the amount of liquid. I was going to just use hot water, but then decided to take a chance. I'm SO glad I did. You can't taste the coffee at all. Just killer chocolate cake. I can't imagine ever using another chocolate cake recipe again! I finally found the perfect one!

AMAZING! I've made this cake (with the ganache frosting) twice. The second time I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount for two 6-inch cake pans. This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever made (and being a private chef I've made quite a few)! I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate once (easy to find at grocery stores), and Callebaut 60% dark chocolate the other time - both were equally delicious! Also, it's okay to use a high quality Dutch process cocoa powder (I always use Callebaut). If you are a chocolate cake lover, skip the others and make this one!

I have made this incredible chocolate cake at least 150 times (I am not kidding) and still have the original clipping from gourmet march 1999. It is amazing moist and always a hit. I used to make a chocolate buttercream frosting but then started making the ganache. It's unbelievable. I am always disappointed in restaurant chocolate cakes as a result. If you have chocolate lovers in the family they will be friends for life.

Disclaimer: I made just the cake from this recipe and skipped the ganache. Easy and excellent. Looking forward to trying the ganache sometime. I made the cake with a classic American (vanilla) buttercream for filling and frosting for my nephew's 1st Communion (his request for choc cake w/ vanilla frosting). Rave reviews from both kids and adults. A couple of folks even asked what bakery my SIL got the cake from. I used double the amount here in two 14 in rounds. I will be doing it again this weekend for a friend's son's party.

I've made this cake three times in the past six months. The first time it was amazing - I decided this was my new go to chocolate cake recipe. Then I made it at my mother-in-laws, it wasn't so great. I had to use inferior ingredients (sanka, ancient cocoa, etc.) and it was definitely less than amazing. I covered it in ganache but it was still just okay. I was wondering if the first time was a fluke. Then I made it last night in my little Nordic roses pan, and I'm again amazed at the recipe. After the first twelve mini-cakes were in the oven, I realized that I hadn't put the oil in the batter. I corrected it for the rest but I have to say the oil less cakes are shockingly moist and delicious today.

I baked this cake today and my lord I must say it is delicious. I didn't quite have enough cocoa powder so I substituted the last little bit with finely ground espresso beans and it turned out really well. Probably the best chocolate cake I've ever had and that's saying something!

I've made this cake on several occasions, always to excellent reviews. It's very moist and a bit dense, so if that's your thing, then this recipe is a good bet. The cake itself is also really good with other frostings- cream cheese was good, as was an instant fudge frosting made with unsweetened chocolate. With regards to the coffee, that depends. In most recipes, the coffee works like vanilla would- not as an additional, separate flavor but as an enhancer. I personally use a very strong brew *and* add a tsp or two of espresso powder, but you can adjust to your taste- I'd suggest using a lighter brew to start and see what you think. :)

I've made this twice now in the past two days for two separate birthday get togethers for my 3-year-old. The adults cleaned their plates! The younger kids couldn't handle all the chocolaty goodness... I still give it "4 forks", but I'd say it isn't the best cake to serve a bunch of little ones. The adults said it was "like a restaurant cake" and "rich enough that you want to keep eating, but not too rich." Everyone, even the people that didn't like sweets, seemed to love it! The cake went well with a couple dollops of whipped cream and a glass of milk :). Also, if you're wondering if I followed the recipe exactly... YES, I did... pretty much at least. I used cake flour (not the all-purpose flour called for in the recipe). Other than that, everything was exact... all the way down to the Callebaut semisweet chocolate. I used a generic Smith's brand cocoa powder on the first cake. For the second cake, I used Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder. I thought the second cake tasted slightly better, but it's hard to tell. They both were delicious, moist, and rich with flavor. This is going to be my go to recipe from here on out. The only difficulty I had with the recipe was the baking time. My cakes were taking at least 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes at 300 degrees F. This is at an altitude of about 4300 ft. Other than this discrepancy, the recipe is right on.

Baked this for my sweeties bday. I used Guittard choc, farm fresh double yolk eggs. We loved the taste, moistness, and dense texture. My gas line was cut while my layers were cooling, garage contruction. So the ganache was made on our grill, no burner directly on the grate. It was tasty but very difficult to control consistency for frosting, it hardened too fast.. I will keep this in my file really loved it, but going to try it with a filling and a buttercream next attempt!

I have been wanting to make this cake for some time now and I finally did it over the weekend. I'm a huge chocolate cake fan, but strangley enough, I don't like cake and icing. I like my chocolate cake to be moist, dense, rich and not bready, crumby, dry with the sugary sweet icing piled on top like you see at most bday parties. I was drawn to this recipe bec of the ingredients. My cake turned out fantastic. It is not as dense as I would have wished for but I'm not complaining bec it really is a great choc cake. Next time i will do thinner layers of cake and spread the ganache in between to add moisture to the finished product. I topped it with fresh raspberries and drizzled raspberry coulis on the side. YUM! be aware: this is a very rich choc cake. You must love chocolate to enjoy this. I used Callebaut chocolate and non-dutch cocoa. You can get these items at whole foods. I'm a fan of quality ingredients and I can def taste the difference. The prior reviewer complained that this cake called for veg oil and not butter but oil adds more moisture to a cake. Creaming (butter) creates air bubbles, which lead to a lighter texture. Oil coats the protein molecules in the flour more quickly, preventing the formation of gluten, making the final product denser, but moist and tender. Since i prefer a denser cake, I prefer the oil. My suggestion: buy Callebaut chocolate and follow recipe as is. As said above, I will use thinner layers next time so that there is more ganache throughout each slice.

Oh my....! I have had this in my list of cake recipes that I have wanted to use for quite awhile, but didn't try it out until last week. I love to bake, so when we were having a work celebration for my supervisors birthday, I jumped at making the cake. Her request was chocolate. Everyone swooned over this cake, and as other reviewers said, you will get tons & tons of compliments. I got "This is the kind of cake that I would pay for at a bakery" and "This is the best cake I have ever tasted in my life" You must make this cake! I used 4 eggs instead of 3, and used Scharffen Berger Semisweet Dark Chocolate Bar instead of the Callebaut. I also did not use the Ganache but used a buttercream frosting instead. Will definitely be making this cake soon!

For non-stick coating use equal parts oil, shortening and flour. Mix well and brush your pans. I also added a round of parchment in the bottom and greased that. No sticking for me. However, didn't work out for part of it to be baked in 8 x 3 pan. Made this today. I made 12 cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes..came out great. Also wanted a small but tall cake so used the remainder of batter to 1/2 fill an 8 x 3 pan. Used bake even strips and a baking nail in the center. Outside still got done and center puckered in and was wet. It won't go to waste as I will turn it into a raspberry and chocolate trifle with whipped cream but wish it would have come out nice. Maybe too wet a cake for a 3" pan.

Made a half batch in 8x2" pan, and edges stuck pretty good despite greasing well with shortening (thank goodness for parchment paper on the bottom).

This is my favourite chocolate cake recipe. I make it in 3 9" pans and torte each cake into two layers and I get 2 cakes 3 layers each. It freezes well if I don't want two cakes immediately. I usually use a chocolate whipped cream frosting as I live in a hot climate where the ganache is not the easiest thing to deal with. Fabulous!

Made this today for our Christmas gathering. One word: FABULOUS! Couldn't find 10" pans, either, so used 9". I did slightly overfill my pans (erroneous guess at the amount to use for pan size), but was able to shave the excess once fully cooled. The ganache easily hid the imperfections. These are beautiful, consistently level layers. Mine did not dome or sink when baked 1 hour in 300 deg oven. Great recipe and a keeper, for sure!

OK, so I am not always the best at following recipes, but I volunteered to make the birthday cake for the party for my friend and guitar mentor, Doug's 60th birthday. Armed with his request for chocolate and raspberries, I found this recipe online. I studied the recipe several times, made my grocery list, got everything together, and started in on creating what I envisioned a fab cake. I correctly referred back to the recipe many times. So ... if you happen to make the cake with the amount of chocolate specified for the ganache, don't worry - it's still good. Yes, I melted 16 oz. of chocolate in the hot coffee destined for the cake - not just 3 oz as specified. (best-laid plans ... insert sigh here). Having used almost all the chocolate, I opted to frost with unsweetened whip cream and whole raspberries. The filling was the same. People raved, and I simply thought "whew" and dug in.

This is truly an amazing chocolate cake. The Mexican chocolate cake also on this site was the cake I always made (with reviewer alterations!) that caused my girlfriends to swoon so I was a bit nervous about trying this recipe and disappointing everyone. THEY LOVED IT. I didn't have the "best" of everything on hand so just used what I had - instant coffee (gasp!), President's Choice semi-sweet chocolate chips and a mixture of Fry's regular cocoa and Camino dutch-process. I added an extra egg. The cake was so dense and most and chocolately and the ganache AMAZING. I added raspberries on top of the middle layer of ganache and also the top of the cake and the tart/sweet combination was divine. MAKE THIS CAKE.

I have made this cake a number of times - all to rave reviews. I made it again last weekend and for the cocoa powder used Hersey Special Dark. The cake was so dark it was almost black. For the icing I did not prepare the ganache frosting this time as I felt it was too sweet. I made the special dark icing from the Hersey's website. It was perfect for the cake. This is a phenomenal recipe. Without a doubt the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I brought the left overs to work and everyone that had a piece were ecstatic. The nicest thing about this recipe is that it is extremely simple to make. I had actually made mine up three weeks ahead of time and froze it. I pulled it out of the freezer the night before and iced it. A definite four fork rating from me

I am not a "sweets" person but i love chocolate. My grandfather brought a recipe from over the pond and it was my fave until this. I did tweak...adding 1 more ounce of the semisweet to the batter, and used a DARK cocoa powder. Moist and delicious beyond my dreams! Please use the parchment paper on the bottom unless you want to have a heart attack waiting to pop them out of the pan! I ran out and shortcutted...all good tho!

This cake with out a doubt is chocolately and delicious. It's definitely super rich and moist. I made this cake in 2 9x2 cake rounds. Since I only have one pan I had to bake them one at a time. The first one I baked I put in for an hour at 350. it was definitely a bit over cooked but it held its shape really well. the second time I turned it down to 325 for 50 minutes. It was sooo moist and perfectly cooked but it was crumbly. After reading the reviews, I definitely want to try this recipe again and see if i can perfect it.

Love this cake. Freezes exceptionally well and the texture and taste even improves by doing this. Usually use for one big cake (not layers) or make a reduced batch for cupcakes.

I made this cake for my daughter's 14th birthday - it was amazing. I put fresh raspberries in the middle layer. The tart & freshness balanced out the intense dark richness of chocolate. Fit perfectly into 2 10inch round Wilton pans - so not sure why folks had an issue with extra batter. Poured ganache over cake while frosting was still a bit warm, so it was more like a glaze. If you chill it, becomes more frosting like. Extra ganache was wonderful as a syrup over the home made ice cream, too. Which was good for the wheat free guests.

Simply delish!! Need to get better pans that don't angle in as it gave the cake an uneven look. Thinking about amousse filling next time to break up the fabulous ganache! It was a huge cake...and a huge hit!

I LOVE this cake and have made it several times. Mine always seems to get stuck in the pans though and I have to pound the bottom of the pans really hard to get them out. The recipe says use greased wax paper. Would parchment be a better option?? Any other ideas? Also, the last time I made it, it completely fell apart when I was cutting. It was still delicious but it was embarrassing. I think it was b/c the cake was still a bit chilled from the park in the fridge and the ganache hardened and made it difficult to cut. I *think* it would have been fine if it were completely at room temp. Next time, I will not park it in the fridge at all. This cake takes FOREVER to get to room temp.

A splendid cake for celebrations or dinner parties; small slices as it's rich! The semi-sweet chocolate may not be a big hit with children, however sophisticated the palates, so I might experiment with a "less-dark" chocolate for the frosting (at some sacrifice to the more experienced palates!!) Batter produces two huge 10-inch layers that required 15 -20 minutes more baking time than indicated in the recipe. It's our family-banner cake!

Rating: 4
made this yesterday with 2 x 9 inch rounds, with 2 inch high sides, and used the majority of the batter with no overflow -- 300 for 55 minutes was perfect. this cake is insanely moist (and yes it was fully cooked), doesn't need an extra egg and is not too crumby (i wonder if the cook times were too generous for those who felt it needed more moisture?). i used a cream cheese frosting instead (modified the one found on this site for the red velevt cake with berries by adding about 50 g of melted ghirardelli semi sweet) and it was to die for.

Rating: 4
Been making this cake since it appeared on Epicurious-simply put the best chocolate cake I know. Dense, moist, old fashion flavor. I use Ghirardelli chocolates (powder and bars), have tried others, but these work best for me. Probably have made about 30 of these- everyone loves it. Make sure you use parchment in your pans, If you ice with the gnache and leave at room temperature, you get a nice soft glaze, if you make ahead and chill the finished cake; the gnache becomes fudgy, both are good, just a choice. Enjoy!

Mine is still in the oven but I have declared four forks based on the batter alone. Followed the recipe to the letter except I substituted espresso for the coffee. Wish I would have read more reviews first.... there was enough extra batter for an extra 10 inch pan and I had a major overflow in the oven.

Rating: 4
This is my dad's all time favorite dessert and he asks for it every father's day! I'm not going to lie, this takes a while to make, but the result is well worth it! I find that Ghirardelli chocolate is perfect for the frosting while Scharffen Berger (although delicious) is a little too dark and distracts from the actual cake.

Rating: 4
This is hands down the best cake I have ever made. I used a raspberry flavored coffee and decorated the top with fresh raspberries. It was simple, elegant, and unbelievably delicious. I agree that good quality chocolate is a must, as the flavor truly shines through, especially in the frosting.

Mousecrash--instead of slicing the cake into very thin layers, you could bake individual ones. It's a tedious process, but probably not much worse than baking and slicing. Here's a technique for baking each layer: http://www.bakerella.com/fourteen-for-the-fourteenth/

Rating: 4
Mousecrash, what about slicing the 9 layers in two, resulting in 18 slightly thinner, but nonetheless, 18 layers? You may need more frosting but that would work...

Rating: 4
Mousecrash, I admire your adventurous spirit! I have made this recipe into some tall cakes, but never even considered nine layers. And you want to double that! The only advice I can offer is to use a very large pan because the wider the base, the taller you can make the structure without it toppling. And then give some thought about what tools you would use to transfer the layers. And consider if servings of your finished cake will even fit on a plate! Or, make your 9-layer cake and give your sweetie two slices and remind him how lucky he is to have you as his girlfriend.

I've made this cake every year for the past four years for my boyfriend's birthday. I usually double the recipe and make a six layer cake (or nine). However, this year he is turning 18 and specifically requested an 18 layer cake....any suggestions on how to do it with this recipe? Thanks!

Just love this cake. Have been making it for 5 years now and it always turns out well. Freezes extremely well - this seems to change the texture too (which I really like) and i find it is easier to carve into party cake shapes with this texture change. I usually just cook it in one large round tin and comes out fine.

Excellent and easy recipe. Wouldn't change a thing. I used 2-9 inch pans and split the cake and made it into 4 layer cake to accomaodate all the ganache. yum chocolatey cake and very mosit too. Next time I will add an extra yolk to eliminate the crumbling. thanks for the recipe, this is now my go to recipe for a chocolate cake

I just made this cake for a birthday and it was amazing!! I used 4 eggs instead of 3 though. Also, I used two 9 inch pans and had way too much batter left over- enough to make 12 extra cupcakes! The cake is so amazing. I used another chocolate frosting recipe from this website. The combo was seriously chocolately and perfect!

To Cake Monster, You said your cake turned out crumbly. Perhaps next time, you may want to bake it less than the recipe advises? I have been using this recipe since 2002 and just use the recipe bake time as a guide. Otherwise, the most fantastic cake, especially with Valrhona cocoa powder, Callebaut chocolate and good quality espresso. If you find the ganche frosting a bit runny, just stick it in the fridge for a few minutes until the desired consistency for spreading is achieved. A good recipe to experiment with too, by using different frosting recipes, liqueurs and so forth. Heaven!

This year, i've decided to make all of my friends cakes as birthday gifts, and this is the third time i've made this cake. I've gotten requests even from people who say they don't normally like chocolate cake. I've found this recipe to be incredibly moist and delicate, hard to work with if you have have a lot of layers, but very delicious. I used a french vanilla flavored coffee, which lends the cake a unique and rich flavor. It's also quite versatile- substituting ingredients or using different pan sizes, it always comes out good. it is also very good with cream cheese frosting. At one birthday party, there were two cakes- one from a professional bakery and the other one this recipe, and this cake was by far the more popular one. if you like rich coffee flavored chocolate cake, this is the one for you!

Rating: 4
I keep thinking about eating more of this cake. Super delicious. The cake is moist and rich. The frosting is extremely chocolatey and amazing. Next time I may try to add a mousse layer to compliment the richness of the cake and frosting. Overall, this is a great chocolate cake recipe.

Rating: 4
Without a doubt the most delicious chocolate cake I've tried. The use of high-end chocolate is totally unnecessary and -- given how much chocolate this recipe uses -- too expensive. Ghirardelli is more than fine. When I was looking for a good chocolate cake recipe, I originally attempted one from Cooks Illustrated, my go-to source for all the basics. They claimed that "dairy muted the chocolate taste" but their resulting cake was VERY dry and disappointing. In contrast, this one is everything a chocolate cake should be: tender but sturdy, intensely chocolatey, and moist. Be aware that the frosting, like all ganaches, is quite dense.

So easy, so delicious! We don't even bother with the frosting. Definitely use good quality chocolate and cocoa powder.

Seriously amazing chocolate cake. Rich and moist. I used 3 9-inch cake pans and I had the perfect amount of batter. The only thing I would do differently next time is add another egg, as other reviewers have suggested; this cake was very crumbly. Also, I would use a different frosting recipe from the one provided. I made the suggested frosting, and I thought it overpowered the cake. It was very good and very dark (which I do love), but with the cake, it just wasn't right. Despite these complaints, the recipe gets 4 forks.

As much as I would like to think I have an independent and skeptical mind, I'm going to have to jump whole-heartedly onto this bandwagon and say this was the very best chocolate cake I have ever tasted! It was a tad hard for me to ice it beautifully because it was so delicate, but that is likely because I have no idea how to do it properly.

Delicious cake! I made this for a dinner party and there was none left over. Truely a good recipe for people who like a fudgey/chocolately type of cake. I split into a 6 layer cake using raspberry filling and added an extra egg and chocolate syrup from recommendations below. Would make again!

I found this recipe to be an excellent one. I stumbled upon it, not knowing about it's famousness due to the today show. I don't bake often (more of a grill/saute/slow cooker kind of guy, as they are more forgiving), but I found this recipe to be very detailed and accurate. I did however make a minor variation that made it wonderfully chewy and kept it from getting too crumbly. I had done a big shop, and was operating under limited time. I suddenly found I had a lot less cocoa powder than I thought I had; I DID however have a can of chocolate syrup (Hershey's classic) in the fridge. So the end result was about 3/4 cup Chocolate Syrup, SUBTRACTING 1 cup cocoa powder, and 25% of the oil. This resulted in a luscious, chewy, tight texture that still maintained a surprising fluffiness to it. It enabled me to carve it easily into the two tiers. I was also a bit more financially constrained, so I found that Ghiradelli chocolate had to suffice.

Rating: 0
This cake is amazing! I saw it on the today show and then decided to make it for my father-in-law. He LOVES chocolate and I know he will love this too. It is so easy to prep and the coffee makes it so moist. The dark chocolate taste is out of this world. I wouldnt change a thing about this cake. And this is the perfect cake to add different fillings to. Job well done on creating such a tasty dessert! I am going to find every reason so I can make this cake many more times soon.

Rating: 4
Like so many others, I love this recipe. It's my go-to chocolate cake. A quick tip: it also makes excellent cupcakes: moist but sturdy. For me, 1/3 of the recipe yields a perfect 12 cupcakes. Fill the cups only 2/3 full, and the cupcakes will rise to be level with the edge of the paper liner: perfect for frosting! For cupcakes, I bake at 300F for 25 minutes.

Rating: 4
The only change I made was adding 1 egg to address the crumbing issue mentioned by others. I used 2 9X13 glass baking pans, and split the batter between the 2 pans. I then baked at 300 for 50 minutes. I will slice and make this into a 4- layer cake. My layers are thinner but they really hold together well, and the cake is not dry at all. I do not understand some of these reviews. One gal said it was "too much cake for her". Seriously, you're going to complain that the cake is too much for 1 person to eat? And that's the fault of the recipe, how?

Great recipe, agree with everyone else who has reviewed. made 4 layers out of 2 cakes, did 2 layers with raspberry puree and a center layer with frosting as well outside and sides. Very moist, not too sweet and quite dark. I think without the raspberry puree it may have been a little too dark even for my family who loves dark, not super sweet desserts.

I am a chocolate lover and so is my family and we absolutely loved this cake. it is very moist and very dark.. I use Callebaut or Dagoba organic chocolate. I love how easy this batter is to make. I put chocolate ganache in center and top with a vanilla buttercream then decorate with fondant.. just perfect.

I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said: this is the ideal, classic chocolate cake. I made it for my dad's birthday and my whole chocoholic family loved it. I didn't have two ten- inch cake pans so I used three brownie pans and made 1.5 times the frosting so I could put ganache between all three layers. The cake was moist and delicious while still managing not to be too dense. The ganache was so delicious I could have just eaten it by itself. Do consider that it can take some time to cool to a texture that will allow you to frost the cake and have it stay in place. It was definitely worth the time and effort it took to make. I will not be looking for any other chocolate cake recipes after finding this one.

I've never had a better chocolate cake, and my 23-yr-old son said this was the best dessert I've ever made. I sliced the cakes into 4 layers, spread raspberry jam between layers 1-2 and 3-4, ganache between 2-3. Other than that, no changes. It was moist, not too sweet, with a wonderful depth of flavor. The ganache was amazing.

This is the best and my favorite chocolate cake. Others can be dry; this one is not! In fact, you have to be careful removing from the pan (use parchment in the pan!) and from the cooling rack as it's quite moist/delicate! Hands down the best. No other cakes needed...

This is a delicious, rich, decadent, almost bittersweet cake. Very, very good. I don't have 10 inch cake pans, so I use 8 inch cake pans and fill them just about halfway, the rest of the batter makes 12 cupcakes perfectly, those bake for 25 minutes at 300 degrees.

Exactly the kind of chocolate cake recipe I've been looking for. Baked this at my mother's house and used what she had on hand - Hershey's semisweet chocolate chips and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa. The cake is awesomely moist, almost black in color, with a nice bitter bite at the end. Most definitely a keeper.

This cake is superb and so easy to make. I make it often and people always love it. I often make it and freeze it and I really like the texture after it has been frozen. It is a very large cake - I usually don't make it as two seperate cakes but as one in one large cake tin and that works fine. It totally puzzles me when I see bad reviews for this recipe as it is such a favourite, and one that people ask the recipe for all the time.

I am back on this recipe because YET ANOTHER friend has asked me to share it with them. This is the best cake ever! I've probably made it (often in cupcake form) 20 times over the last few years and it's become my signature dish. One note - it falls a little bit after you take it out of the oven, so the tops are not round -- don't overfill the pan or you'll have sort of a flat pancake over the top.

So i made this recipe yesterday and i was not happy with the results, first of all, the cake does take like a brownie and then the ganache was just too unsweet for my taste, this was a lot of chocolate cake for me. will i make this again? most likely NOT.

I made this as the cake for a black forest cake, and it absorbed the syrup very well! I'm not sure how it would taste with the icing in this recipe, but I'm sure it would be great. Some words of advice: it is a HUGE batter, or at least I found it so, so if you're thinking of cutting it into four layers it would be much better just to use four cake pans. If you are going to cut it, make sure you wait until it has completely cooled.

Rating: 3
OK, my store only had standard chocolate, so I bought Tollhouse chocolate chips, which added such ease...no chopping. Perhaps that is why I was not very impressed, nor was my family. DO NOT make this cake if you don't like a heavy cake. It is quite fudge-like. The cake itself could use a bit more sugar, and I am not one for too sweet. Overall, even though it was easy to make, there are better recipes for chocolate cake.

Rating: 3
This recipe is overrated. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it. For a chocolate lover, this is definitely a good cake. For the rest of us, it may be a little one dimensional. I also found the caffeine hit from the coffee and chocolate combination to be a bit too much. This recipe could stand a few improvements. If I make it again I will cut the ganache frosting in half and use a chocolate butter cream or raspberry jam between the layers. Certainly NOT a 4 fork recipe.

My son wanted a great chocolate cake for his 18th birthday, so I read the reviews and baked this one. It was fantastic! I was a bit worried about the crumb so I used 4 medium eggs instead of three large, and used greased parchment for the sides of the cake tins as well as the bottoms. My tins are 8 inches across and four inches deep so I had to guess at how much better to pour in (I didn't want overflow). I ended up with two ample layers and 11 cupcakes. I had no crumb issues, cakes slipped out of the tins. I cooled overnight then frosted. This cake is perfection! The taste you get is of lovely chocolate, it isn't overly sweet and the texture was fabulous. A real keeper.

Wow! Moist, light but super chocolatey. My first layered cake and it was a hit! Was short 1/4 cup of oil so used 1/4 cup of olive oil and it actually worked! It gave the batter an odd (but not bad) taste, but once baked, there was zero olive flavor. There is only enough frosting for a thin layer between cakes, so adding something else is good. I used the whole chocolate mousse Gourmet recipe, December 2002. So good!

I just made this cake for a barbecue, and everyone went absolutely nuts for it. They told me it was better than any chocolate cake they had at a fancy restaurant. I did change it a bit. I followed the recipe for the cake, I did bake it in a 10x3" cake pan with a removable bottom. After baked I reassembled in the cake pan. Torted the cake into 4 layers, and used choc mousse filling, and bavarian cream, and a thin layer of ganache. Poured the ganache on the top, and let it sit overnight. When I removed the assembled cake from the pan, it looked perfect, sides were so straight and beautiful, it did look like a very fancy dessert. Everyone loved it.

I have been making this amazing cake for several years. It is quite simply the very best I have ever made! I make it for many birthdays (I even doubled it one year and made a cake for 25, and it turned out excellent), and it is my post-baby must have for myself and closest friends. It freezes wonderfully. A couple of tips- The batter fills 3 , 9" pans. No need for cream in the ganache- whole milk works great, and I usually halve the recipe and give the cake more of a "skim coat". Just make sure there is plenty between the layers. Ghiradelli chocolate works as well as more expensive varieties. This is for true chocolate lovers- moist and super decadent! A WOW cake that even inexperienced bakers can pull off.

I loved this cake. I don't normally prefer chocolate cakes but this one is lovely. The batter, when prepared according to the recipe, easily fills 3 8-inch cake pans (which is what I used) and makes a beautifully high triple-layer cake. I made the ganache frosting as instructed, and after it cooled, I whipped it. The texture was perfect for spreading on the cake and looked so nice in contrast to the dark layers. Everyone that tried it approved. - I didn't adjust the recipe for altitude and instead trimmed the layers flat (they of course sunk). It was perfect.

We made this cake as the basis for a "Scary Alien" cake for a 5-year old's birthday party (wish I could share the photo here -- it came out amazing!). Since we were using two 9x12 Glad OvenWare pans, I made a recipe and half. Like other reviewers, I turned up the oven heat to 350 and watched the cooking time closely. The cake came out perfectly moist with a delicate crumb. It's a delicious chocolate cake for any occasion!

I didn't have 10 inch cake pans....but I did have two 9 inch springform pans and since they are deep they were more than able to accomodate all the batter from this recipe---and the cakes were deep enough to slice and make a 4-layer cake! Surprisingly, they didn't need extra baking time--they were toothpick-test done in just over an hour. The cake was FABULOUS. I used suggestions from prior reviewers for the centers: raspberry jam between the 1st and 3rd layers, and Kahlua whipped cream in the center...and of course, the ganache on top. Everyone loved it.

The cake tasted pretty good but was a little dry and crumbly around the edges. Be very careful not to overcook it. I cut each layer in two to make four layers and put raspberry jelly in between which kept it moist. Definitely make sure the frosting is on the warm side otherwise it's impossible to frost.

Wow. I've never been so disappointed with a recipe. Maybe it was the rave reviews. Unlike some contributors who whine about substituting five ingredients, and then complain about the results by blaming the recipe, I went to purchase 10" pans,and did not sub chocolate chips and purchased enough Valhrona to pull this off. I used a scale to verify all my measurements, was meticulous about beating (but not overbeating) the eggs to the proper color and consistency. I guess I'll look for an imbibing syrup to resuscitate it. I don't understand. It had 4 forks across. It's why I picked it. I'd be very interested to have someone explain the advantage of a slow-baked cake. 300 at 70 minutes? fine. I did that in a calibrated oven with a thermometer inside. It was dry, crusty and unbelievably ordinary. Maybe the magic is in the frosting. The cake certainly cannot stand alone. Boo.

I made this with a Jack Daniels flavored coffee (why someone thought I would like that, I don't know!) and bittersweet chocolate, and had RAVE reviews. I also used light olive oil and told everyone it was a "healthy chocolate cake". LOL It is a restaurant quality cake when carefully made, and I have made it three times so far, and given the recipe out with good success.

I have made this over and over. Fantastic recipe, I even melted some butter and deleted part of the oil for an even more richer flavor. Always get huge hugs from this recipe!

I followed the recipe for the most part. It turned out very well. It is extremely easy to make and looks wonderful. For the people that think it was too dry or crumbly: try not baking it for so long. Test it every so often if you're worried about it getting dry. I am in Germany and I can't find corn syrup, or I don't know the translation, but I used High Tannin Honey instead which is a superb addition to the frosting. I used sunflower oil which isn't apparent either way. I only have 9" pans which worked out fine: i didn't fill them all the way, instead I made on the side three small chocolate torts which only took about 15 minutes to bake. The frosting was immediately a desirable consistency without cooling too much or refridgerating. I am from chicago, and to me this could almost be a Portillos Chocolate Cake substitute which I am very excited about. And anyone from Chicago knows what I'm talkin about. DA bears. I put raspberry preserves in between the two layers and the frosting on the top and sides and it is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it!

Lemme just say, this cake was absolutely amazing! Bakery quality cake that a beginner like me could make. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 8in pans instead of 10in ones, extra batter went into a pan for myself! Mine turned out very moist and yes, sortof crumbly, however just on the sides and I just used a lot more icing :P I did not make the icing they called for, rather bought chocolate and buttercream from the store. The reaction I got was incredible. Stunning looks, stunning taste. "You are the best cook in the world!" One of my friends said. Thank you for this recipe! Phenomenal!

I bake a lot of cakes. I followed this recipe as it's published. This one tastes OK, but it IS too crumbly. I let it sit overnight, then I made a buttercream frosting for it the next day. After applying a crumb-coat, I chilled the cake for 30-40minutes, however, I still had problems with crumbs in the top- coat. The finished cake isn't as pretty as I'd like. I prefer Alice Water's chocolate cake recipe in "The Art of Simple Food" but I was looking to explore.

I made this for my son's birthday party and the adults were floored! I don't bake often, but, if you follow the directions, you receive high-end bakery quality cake. It was rich and decadent. I had to use Ghirardelli Chocolate because that was the highest quality chocolate available at my supermarket. I will eventually try again with higher end chocolate to see if I can taste the difference.

This was a huge hit on Valentine's and I have been asked for the recipe several times! I also use the ganache for yellow cupcakes and they're a bug hit too. I also refrigerate the ganache for about 20 - 30 mins to set up.

I put the frosting in the refrigerator to chill until it was firm enough to spread, then accidently forgot about until the morning. By then it was rock solid. I microwaved it just a little, checking it every 15 seconds, and when I could stir it, I frosted the cake. It turned out perfectly.

My husband made this for my birthday. I usually bring some to work, but selfishly we couldn't part with any, especially with the french buttercream frosting he also made. They mean it when they say 10 x 2 pans. He used 8 x 2 and it ran over, but that made delicious crispy cookies that we dipped into the buttercream - so on second thought we might do that again.

Best in show, best ever, best in a long life of chocolate cakes. Used Chinese peanut oil and there was a wonderful roasted-peanut aroma while the cake was baking, though I could detect no peanut flavor in the finished product. It took only 45 minutes for the two 10" pans to bake, in a 300 degree oven with a thermometer. Twelve 8-year-olds rampaged around the yard screaming and brandishing sticks after this birthday cake: Next time I might use decaf!!!

reviewing based on cupcakes. the cake layers recipe made 30 regular-size cupcakes in buttered muffin tins; they cooked perfectly at 325 degrees for 18-20 minutes. i only frosted the cupcake tops (generously) and the ganache was, of course, too plentiful (not a problem). i used trader joe's cocoa powder and whole foods' 365 semisweet chocolate chips in order to save a little cash -- i thought the taste was excellent though i'm sure the flavor could only be enhanced by finer chocolates. the texture of the cake is incredible - moist and with great chocolate flavor, and the ganache added a fudgelike topping. everyone (served at a party) loved them, and i will definitely make them again.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I made this for a friend's birthday yesterday. I did 2/3 of the cake recipe and baked it in two 9-inch pans for 45-50 minutes. I used the full pound-o-chocolate ganache recipe, but subbed honey for the corn syrup and 1/4 cup malted milk powder for the sugar. Make sure you let the ganache cool and thicken enough before starting to frost! The cake is wonderfully moist and the coffee and buttermilk give it a more complex flavor. It begs for a tall glass of milk to go with it. Ten female college students all agree it's awesome!

I just served this to a group of guys and the general response was that it was "the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten". I made it exactly as the instructions stated, but I did need to substitute lemon juice and whole milk for the buttermilk (not available in the UK). This cake is incredibly moist and dense, but not too sweet. I made it as three layers in a 7" baking tins. The cake puffed up so much that I ended up layering just two of the cakes and serving one as a single layer. The cake was done in about 45 minutes using a fan oven at 300 F. Highly recommend!

This cake was easy to make and delicious. I used average quality chocolate and it was excellent. I can only imagine how good it will taste with better chocolate. I used 9 inch pans and had some leftover batter. I buttered two ramekins and put the extra batter inside and baked. Yum. This way I was able to taste the cake without breaking into the real cake.

WIthout a doubt this is the best recipe for chocolate cake I have ever tasted. The guests at the party just died when they tasted the first bite. It is soooo moist - I just couldnt get over it. In addition - I did not have butter milk so I used skim milk and lemon juice to make the buttermilk substitute and it was still great. I also used Hershey choc chips in lieu of the Callebet choc and Dark hershey coco powder and it was fab.

Rating: 3
I didn't have 10 inchers, so I put the batter in 3 9' pans, and it looked quite impressive--I think that it's definitely the way to go--I also doubled the ganache recipe, which was splendid. I'm not really a cake person, so although the consistency was fine, I didn't think it had much chocolate flavor, though most disagreed with me (I pretty much only like flourless chocolate cakes). The ganache is wonderful and adds a lot to it. My substitution--rather than 3/4 cup oil, I used 1/4 oil and 1/2 sour cream/nonfat plain yogurt mixture, and it was still moist.

This is my second time making this cake. As most of the other 1336 reviewers have said, it is great! I followed the recipe to the letter including the 10" pans. I do have three tips to offer: the first is, the cake is truly better after a couple of days. I made this on a Thursday and the pieces we ate on Sunday night were the best yet. It has not dried out or gotten stale in the least. I did cover and refrigerate as the recipe directs, although admit I'm not sure why the cake requires refrigeration. Perhaps that's why it is keeping so well. The second tip is, it is way, WAY better at room temperature, so if you follow the instructions to refrigerate it, cut the pieces you're going to eat several hours in advance and let them sit out to come to room temp first. The reason is that the ganache gets too hard in the fridge. It's kind of like a semi-hard candy bar on top of the cake if it's still too cool - which isn't a great combination of textures. At absolute room temperature, though, the texture is perfect. The third tip has to do with the frosting. I saw some comments about the ganache being too runny to frost the cake. That is because you didn't let it sit long enough as the recipe says. After mixing, let it cool to room temp (starts out warm), stirring occasionally. For me it took 30-45 minutes. The texture became absolutely lovely - perfect for spreading and looking gorgeous. So, just be patient and allow time for the frosting to set up just enough, and you won't be disappointed.

Very happy family! I don't own oil, so I used clarified butter (ghee), reduced the sugar by 3/4 cup, and the flour and cocoa by 1/4 cup each. Based on the reviews, I used 4 medium eggs and 4 oz bittersweet chocolate for the cake, and mixed the batter in a more old-fashioned way. Baked for 35 mins in 3x9" pans; all three rose perfectly to equal height. Took the hint of making ganache while the cake baked. It wasn't runny; I chopped the chocolate very finely in the food processor and simply poured the hot cream down the funnel with the machine still running. I whipped what was left of the pint of heavy cream, added it to just less than half the chocolate mixture, and used this between the layers; sufficient ganache left for the outside. Perfect texture, moist, not too sweet, no oily taste. Yum...

I have made a variety of chocolate cakes and this is by far one of the best. I've never had it to turn out bad. One of my friends described it as being like a chocolate truffle.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I made this as written except using half bittersweet (60%) chocolate for the ganache. I made cupcakes - 48 minis & 24 regular. The minis were the perfect size for the richness of the cake & ganache. The cupcakes stayed moist & delicious for 2 or 3 days - then they were all gone, but I'm sure they would still be good. I would probably use whipped cream or raspberry filling with whipped cream for frosting for a cake. The cake itself is so intense, it really doesn't need the frosting.

Extremely moist and decadent! It is imperative to let the layers cool completely before removing from the pans. I was making this cake very late at night, and just let them cool in the pans for about 6 hours. The layers came out perfectly! The icing is to die for, you chocolate lovers! What a perfect cake for my daughter's 16th birthday.

I was in Denmark visiting my new in-laws, and, eager to impress, I offered to make a cake for my sister-in-law's birthday. I saw this recipe and it seemed pretty good, so I went for it. I used 70% cocoa, fair trade chocolate, and only found out later that bittersweet is only about 52%.. It was absolutely amazing!!! I loved this cake. I am back home and have just purchased ingredients to make it again. I made it as is, no changes to the recipe (except using darker chocolate), and it was perfect. The only problem was that with time constraints, I didn't cool it enough. Oh yeah, and I didn't use ganache, I made a faux mousse (whipped cream and melted chocolate with a bit of icing sugar) for the middle, and buttercream for the icing. Amazing cake!!!

I know it's annoying when somebody reviews a recipe that they altered, but it's realistic-- sometimes you just have to make substitutions. I had to use some whole wheat flour in this recipe because I ran out of all- purpose, and I had to eyeball the amount of chocolate because my scale was broken. That may have contributed to the delicate texture, but a lot of comments have mentioned it as a problem. I think the best thing to do would be to freeze the cake before unmolding it. I personally baked it in muffin tins to avoid the heartache of trying to frost a cake that doesn't want to stay together. Other than that, it tasted amazing. I was worried that it would taste too much like coffee (the batter tasted more coffee-like than chocolaty), but after baking it just tasted like the most satisfying, dark chocolate cake. The glaze was a beautiful texture, but it really needed a teaspoon or so of vanilla to round out the flavors.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday, and it was delicious and impressive looking! I didn't have 10" pans, so I made three 9" layers - WOW! It was beautiful! My only complaint is that the cake was so moist, that it was sticky and falling apart a little before frosting. Also, be careful of sugar comas! This cake packs a chocolate punch!

Rating: 0
Awesome. I made the recipe as cupcakes, using Green and Black organic baking chocolate for the batter (no need to chop - it melts if you breathe on it) and Sunspire semi-sweet chips for the ganache. The cupcakes took about 35 minutes at 325 degrees (not 20 minutes, as some other reviews state). I used parchment baking cups, which may have been the difference. I also made some mini cupcakes (1-inch, not 2.5) and those took 20. I let the ganache set up before frosting, but after the first few cupcakes I got lazy and remelted it. Then I poured about a tablespoon on each cupcake, let them sit for a few minutes. and then poured another tablespoon. Looks cool, tastes wonderful.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten. Normally, I don't like chocolate cake because I don't think it actually tastes like chocolate... but this one is different. The cake is super moist and very, very rich. I put the ganache in the fridge (and then in the freezer for a few minutes when I got really impatient)to stiffen it up. Perfect! Be forewarned: use the pans recommended or make sure to use a little bit less of the batter if you only have the 9x2 pans. And don't forget to grease it like crazy. Otherwise, this is easy and bakery quality.

Rating: 4
A great recipe, but unlike other cooks, I found it necessary to bake much longer than the recommended 60 - 70 minutes. It was at least 90 minutes. This was true even though I used my convection oven, which usually bakes goods in under the suggested time.

I love this recipe. It makes such a moist flavorful, truly chocolatey cake. I make it just as directed for the true chocoholics I really love. I use the cake recipe alone, with more traditional buttercream frostings when I am making a chocolate cake for kids or when I want something a bit less rich (but still very decadent!). I've also doubled the cake recipe and used it as a 3 layer sheet cake by making it in 3 half sheet pans and then stacking with buttercream frosting in between. A huge hit!

I made this cake for my husband's aunt's birthday and it was unbelievable! I used a different vanilla buttercream filling to breakup the chocolate a bit, and it turned out fantastic. Recommendation: you will need to chill the frosting in order to make it less of a glaze, and make sure the cakes are cold in order to frost in a traditional sense. This is definitely my go-to chocolate cake!

Its an amazing recipe. It is definitely a chocolate lovers dream. If you absolutely love chocolate cake then this is for you. Its a very rich chocolate cake so make sure you absolutely love chocolate and its richness. Also its pretty sweet. But you can alter the sweetness if you want by not adding sugar in the ganache. The cake cannot go wrong if you use all the ingredients as stated. So make it, bake it and enjoy it.....

This is a delicious rich chocolate cake. I used a cinnamon hazelnut coffee, but the flavor of the coffee does not seem to matter. I also used two different sized pans, a 10" and an 8", to give it a small tier(the cake was for a birthday).

Wow. I adapted this recipe to make a three-tier wedding cake. One double recipe yielded three generously sized layers (one each of 14, 12 and 6 inches round). My only modification was to add one whole egg to each double recipe for more solidity- by no means did this compromise the moist, fudgy crumb of this cake. I made two double recipes and wrapped each layer in plastic wrap and heavy duty foil before I froze it in my deep freezer for a week. It froze beautifully. I skipped the ganache and filled and frosted the cake with vanilla flavoured swiss meringue buttercream. I studded the filling with fresh raspberries to offset the sweetness of the cake and the richness of the buttercream. Was it ever a hit! There's something to be said about 100 people applauding your handiwork. What's great about this cake is that you can really taste the chocolate; its texture and taste are a cross between soft, fluffy cake and moist,fudgy brownies.

My high altitude go-to cake. I'm at 6500 ft. I add an extra egg, reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup, add 2 tbl more flour, and cook 20 degrees hotter. The higher temp helps set the cake + keep it from falling. In mid-winter when humidity is routinely 10% I'll probably add extra buttermilk to compensate for the drier flour.

Used Guittard semisweet for both cake and ganache, and instead of buying 10" regular pans I used a 10" springform I already had, which worked well. I will make a bit more ganache next time - but there will definitely be a next time. I'm sure this one will get made many many times.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. Absolutely amazing every time. I have substituted sour cream for buttermilk on one occasion, and a milk/vinegar combo another time. If you do not have 10' pans (most of us do not own them), make 3 layers in an 8' or 9' pan and bake for 48 minutes at 300. I have made these as cupcakes also - baked for 18-20 minutes at 325.

good cake, but not "swoon-worthy." I get really annoyed at recipes that use equipment no one has (10" X 2" cake pans??). I reduced the recipe to 2/3 for use in my regular 2 9- inch pans.

Not sure I'd bother trying it again because I have other standby chocolate cakes that don't give me trouble.

I generally will not write a review if I haven't been true to the recipe. However, I was so impressed with this cake even though I lacked enough cocoa, I think I had 1/2 cup and used nestle chocolate chips. I did take the advice of a previous reviewer and added the additional egg and vanilla. And baked at 320 for 1hr 5 min. It was the best chocolate cake ever!!! As I poured the batter into the pans I thought it was a little thin, but it came out fabulous.

OK. I am on my 3rd try with this cake, and it keeps falling. I live at high altitude (8200 feet) and here are the adjustments I have made so far: Sugar reduced by 6 Tbsp; flour increased by 1 Tbsp; baking powder decreased by 1/2 tsp; buttermilk reduced by 3 Tbsp; eggs increased to 4; heat adjusted to 375F (300 seemed a little low to me even at sea level?), pans near 2/3 full. Rack in middle of oven. Friends want this as a wedding cake - love the flavour, if only I could get it to stop falling (although it falls less everytime I make an adjustment). Any suggestions?

I think I had my hopes set a little high for this cake since it has over 1200 reviews. I mean, it was good, but definately not the best I've ever had. Mine turned out more like brownie layers than cake. The taste was good, but the texture was a little off for me. The birthday boy enjoyed it, but it definately didn't get as many raves as other chocolate cakes I have made. At least I can say I finally made this famous cake!

This is definitely a serious chocolate fan's cake. The chocolate flavor is almost as intense as in a flourless chocolate cake. I liked it, but if I were to make it again, I'd make the layers thinner -- maybe make just one cake pan's worth and cut that in half. The way it was was a bit too giant, as opposed to elegant.

I am planning to make this cake for a friend's birthday, but she does not want to share and she does not want it frosted. Is there anyone who can advise me about baking this in a bundt or decorative sheet cake pan? I have a few interesting molds/pans that would make her smile and I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the end product. - Thanks

Excellent Cake. We all loved it and I will make it again. I found the cake to be a little dry though and wondering if I should have sifted the ingredients before I measured them, especially the flour? Also, wondering if using mayonnaise instead of oil would make a difference...

I am allergic to coffee and used 1 1/2 cups of hot chocolate instead. Delicious cake.

o.k. this is the real deal. remember the last time you went to the best restaurant in town and had the best chocolate cake ever? this is it, after looking at recipe it reminded me of a cake recipe i have made for years, from the cook book "In The Sweet Kitchen" its called All-in-the-Pan chewy Chocolate Cake. if ever you want the same exact cake but only 1/4 of the work and is made in one 8x8 pan, this is it. o.k. so i made the double choc. layer cake exactly as stated only using 3 9" pans, used raspberry jam between layers with the frosting. still had plenty of frosting to do entire cake despite what others say. served for birthday party, all i heard was " you should be selling this" its so good!

I've been waiting to make this cake for months now and even went out to buy the 10" pans. And it was worth it. My parents dislike most sweets but had seconds of this cake. A first! If you are a dark chocolate lover and dislike the cloyingly sweet cakes found in bakeries/stores, you'll love this one. I promise.

I made this recipe exactly as written.I took it to a adult birthday party and didn't get ANY oohs and ahhs. the cake was good, the frosting was alittle too much.I did change one thing. I didn't have 2 10" pans, so I used 3 9". Alot of work...not worth it. Next time I'll use my French Silk frosting that's always a hit.

I made this cake for the first time 6 years ago and have fantasized about it ever since. That was when there were only 561 reviews (almost all 4 forks). 2 things that amaze me about this recipe == if you use good choc (follow suggestions on editorial) the ganache is the best in the world, and secondly, if you're lucky enough to have it in the house for 1 week (my husband doesn't each chocolate) the dang cake is STILL moist!! A miracle cake and one that you'll always love!! Well worth the time and money to make.

the 1st time I made this was for my chocoholic friend for her bday. she raved about it for a year... so made it again for her bday yesterday. I don't eat chocolate, so I am going by her approval. She said WOW!! My friend also cuts it into sections, wraps it in saran wrap, then puts it into freezer baggies and freezes it. She says it is as great the first day as the last bite on the last day. Freezes well, when wrapped tightly! guess i'll be making it for each bday here on out. little pricey with all the choc required and time consuming but worth it.

Best cake by far I have ever made. I made it with the chocolate orange ganache and orange buttercream from the chocolate wedding cake recipe from this site. I also used a syrup to brush each layer before putting the ganache on and flavored the syrup with orange zest and Grand Marnier. It was literally unbelievable. Will be making again for Easter even though its LOTS of work!

Have made this about 6 times and it's my favorite chocolate cake recipe when I'm cooking for a lot of people. It is a LOT of cake, so it gets wasted if I make it for just my family. Everyone adores it, and many have asked for the recipe. My husband is a huge chocolate mousse fan, so I do a mousse icing...have never tried the ganache but it sounds rather sweet for me. The fake "mousse" I make (chocolate combined with homemade whipped cream) and strawberries make for the perfect cake though. Very very decadent and fabulously easy!

This cake with the frosting was fabulous. This would be great for any chocoholic. It is as good as the chocolate frosted chocolate cupcakes from Cheesecake Factory. To me, the chocolate ganache frosting was like eating a rich chocolate truffle. I made the following changes: 1) halved the recipe since I only wanted to use two 9'' round pans with no leftover 2) reduced the sugar by half a cup (and then scaled that amount down by a half since I wanted half the quantity overall 3) halved the frosting recipe since I did not want to use the frosting between layers. Even with this change, I had frosting leftover to dip my strawberries 4) I greased and floured the pan and also the parchment paper. Between layers, I spread a thin layer of seedless raspberry preserves. It complimented the cake very well. Even without the chocolate ganache between layers, the cake was incredibly rich. In the future, I might reduce the frosting quantity or skip the frosting altogether.

Oh. My. Lord. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this cake has me converted - it was sublime!! I made this with a friend and when you divy up the work, it goes fast, and was well worth the effort. We added a raspberry filling instead of the ganache filling, but was so impressed by the result... frosting -Goood, cake - Goooood, and a HUGE SUCCESS!!!

I made this for my son's birthday but subbed cream cheese icing for the ganache. It was truly the most delicious cake I've ever tasted, let alone baked. I was wary about using oil in the recipe, since I normally prefer butter, but it was not at all greasy. The texture is rich and moist, and it was fresh for a week. P.S. To the cook from Glasgow; I believe Golden Syrup is pretty much the same as corn syrup.

Hi made this recipe at weekend and it was amazing. From UK so had to order 'corn syrup' online as we don't have that over here but think next time I would just use a ganache recipe that didn't require it as I don't really know what it contributed if anything. We also don't have the brand of chocolate in the recipe so used 'Green &Blacks' 70%, a very popular UK brand and it came out great. Didn't put as much chocolate in the ganache as the recipe, 10oz instead of 16oz and upped the cream a bit and it was lovely. My mum asked for the recipe and that is high praise!

I made the cake recipe exactly as written but only had 1/2 cup of cocoa powder on hand. The cake came out chocolate-y but not cloyingly sweet, and so moist and delicious. It may be the best regular cake from scratch I've ever made. Frosted it with the peanut butter frosting recipe from bon appetit and it was perfection.

Rating: 4
nkny do you not want to use coffee because of the taste or the caffeine? either way I think you should be ok using is as the final result has zero taste of coffee and chocolate has caffeine anyways, so...in any case if you want to leave it out I doubt it'll hurt the cake much.

I made the cake with vanilla frosting. The cake was fantastic! Before I baked the batter, I tried it, the batter had only a little coffee taste. When the batter was baked there was no coffee taste at all( which is good because I very mush dislike coffee)!

A word on the ganache frosting...I made it exactly to the recipe, but wanted something a bit lighter for the frosting. So after it had cooled to workable temperature, I beat it with a hand mixer for about five minutes. This lightened the color a bit, and also increased the volume slightly. I will definitely make this cake again. However, next time, I will flour the pans, increase the oven temperature to 325, and use 3 deep 9" layer pans, rather than regular-depth 9" layers. The layers fell slightly because the batter was just starting to go over the edge. It all tastes great though--like a big, fudgy truffle!

This cake was excellent. I made it for my husband's Birthday and he said it was too chocolaty (in what Universe is too much chocolate a bad thing?) but everyone else has loved it. I made the two cakes just like the recipe calls. I usually try to bake cakes in the lower end of the time specified because I like the cakes to be moist, but in this case it did need the 1 hour and 10 minutes. As other reviewers mentioned, I did find myself short of frosting as well so I may either make a bit more next time or do as others did, use something different for inside the cake. That actually sounds quite interesting. Would definitely make again.

Rating: 4
I used silicone pans and the cakes were done in less than 50 minutes. the bottoms overcooked a bit, actually, but I trimmed the burned edges before frosting. I'd recommend making 1 1/2 batches of frosting--I didn't have quite enough.

This was divine! I made it on Friday for my son's birthday on Saturday. I also used three 9 inch pans, but had to cook for about an hour. I made a raspberry filling and used the ganache for the outside of the cake. I received many compliments, including a number of "this is the best cake I have ever eaten." Keeping this one handy for all special occassions.

Made this last night and frosted it this morning. Like others here, made 3 9" layers + 6 cupcakes. Ran out of ganache for the 3 layers. Next time will add raspberry type filling between the layers and use ganache on the top and sides. The taste was EXCELLENT!

I really wanted to like this cake, as expensive as the choclate was and with all the rave reviews. But sorry, I might as well have just eaten the chocolate right out of the packageing instead of making it into this cake. It would have been about the same thing. The recipe was followed exactly, beautiful cake, moist, but the taste and texture was too much for us, too heavy. Have eaten and made much better cakes than this one without jumping through all the hoops and spending a bunch of money.

Well, my opinion is that it's a very good moist rich cake and I enjoyed making it. I hid 1/2 in the freezer but kept sneaking pieces anyway and thawing them out while I ate dinner. Note: I get such a kick out of the squabbling going on. We're bakers here...not world leaders....this is supposed to be fun. (OK, now some one is sure to "yell" at me on this site!)

Very moist cake that was a hit at the dinner party I took it to. Since the recipe is rich, I was concerned it would be too sweet for my taste with the ganache. As a result, I used the Tangy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site instead which worked well as an alternative. I would definitely make again.

1st - this is my favorite chocolate cake recipe on the planet, and I am--like Tony's Treats-a professional. Unlike Tony's Treats, however, I'm not going to go all crazy on reviewers who "dare" to challenge my recommendations! Tony's changes may produce an equally delicious cake, but like the other reviewer stated, it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges, especially with the frosting. Ganache is ganache - plain and simple. And to the other reviewer, corn syrup, used in small amounts like this recipe, merely "stabilizes" the ganache, without imparting that "corn syrup" flavor. In my experience, TRUE bakers do so out of love and passion, and are not capable of such vitriol, Tony!

I made this cake for husband's birthday, and it turned out beautiful. I have never baked a cake that tasted as wonderful as it looked. It truly looked like something from a fancy bakery; layers were even in size and perfectly formed. Just two layers, but it stood as tall as a 4 layered cake. I used the Pam for baked goods (with flour in the spray) and sprayed over and under the parchment. It came out of the pans effortlessly. I turned them over while they were still warm , however. My only complaint is the corn syrup in the ganache...I just don't like cooking with it and don't like the taste, but the texture of this ganache was good and it tasted so chocolatey that I didn't notice it.

Rating: 4
YUMMY! Based on other reviews I skipped using the frosting from this recipe and used half the ganache recipe from Epicurious. Didn't have 10" so I two 9" and had enough leftover for 2 dozen cupcakes. FYI, don't overfill the pans like I did. Big, big mess...

KULITA - I believe you criticized me for changing the GANACHE FROSTING? I'll give you 3 reasons on why I changed it? #1 - IT WAS TOO THICK!! #2 - IT WAS TOO HARD!! #3 - IT WAS TOO CHOCOLATY!! You can control how chocolaty it taste as well as the txture by how much heavy cream & chocolate you use. Now if you like the original recipe, like most of you do, that's your preference!! The changes that I submitted worked best for me because when I frosted the cake, it was just creamy enough & not too thick!! I received MONUMENTAL RAVE REVIEWS about the changes that I made on the 2nd cake! I had 2 cooks who work in restaurants tell me that the 2nd cake could've sold for $4.00 to $5.00 a slice, in the right restaurants. The 1st cake was good, but the 2nd one WAS OFF THE CHAIN & it didn't last a day! Speaking of that! Anyone who has made this cake knows that it's best to let it set overnite before frosting. Sorry KULITA, but you didn't make this cake. EASYLYVIN & BFORENOW, again, thanks for having my back!!

EASYLYVIN & BFORENOW, if I knew you, I would make you one of my patented 7 - UP/BUTTERMILK pound cakes in which I use 2 different flours to make these cakes. Have you ever had a VANILLA, BUTTER & NUT pound cake? Better yet, my World Famous 3 or 4 LAYERED PEACH/APPLE COBBLERS in which I incorporate the SACO to make the best pie crusts that you've ever tasted in a cobbler!! Are you getting hungry yet?

I guess I'll have to submit the rest of my review & response to EASYLYVIN, BFORENOW & KULITA in bits & pieces. Anyway, the ingredients that I submitted in my previous review is not something that you can purchase just anywhere. KULITA, I would like to know which stores you purchased these items at? You can't just get these items at just any store. Another thing, unless you're familiar with using the SACO BUTTERMILK BLEND, this is not the cake to try it on unless you are. Most people whom I've told about using the SACO has tried the pancake recipe before jumping into anything else. This stuff makes the best GERMAIN CHOCOLATE & RED VELVET CAKES too. The money you save using this stuff is insurmountable. You can make about 12 - 16 cakes using this & when not in use, you can store it in the fridge like baking soda. Can you do that with buttermilk over the summer?

So I made this cake about 2 years ago for the first time and loved it then, but the more I have made it, the better it has gotten. I use ghiradelli chocolate and cocoa and bake it in three 9" cake pans at 300 degrees for 48 minutes. I agree with everyone else that it is imperative to butter and flour BOTH the pans and then the parchment paper - otherwise the cake just won't come out of the pans. I use a chocolate buttercream in betwen the layers and then use the ganache for the outside. Even doing this, I just have enough ganache to cover the cake. I can't imagine stretching it to use it between the layers as well. This cake is beyond fabulous and I always get rave reviews when I make it for parties.

First let me confess that I don't really like cake, especially chocolate cake -- but this cake was great. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner. I had some baking issues (totally my fault because I didn't use the 10-inch pan), but it turned out moist and delicious. I frosted the cake with whipped cream flavored with a bit of peppermint extract and sprinkled chopped peppermint pieces on top. The perfect end to a celebration meal.

Made this for Christmas Eve and it turned out FANTASTIC. I made the cake layers the day before and let them sit overnight on top of the fridge (wrapped well) and added some very good raspberry jam in the middle of the layers. Served with some great decaf coffee and our guests went straight into food coma! Excellent and would absolutely make this again. My wife cut the remainder up, froze the pieces on a cookie sheet and then wrapped them up. They are keeping well and taste great straight out of the freezer.

This cake recipe is the DA BOMB!!! I am a lover of double chocolate cakes but had never baked a cake before in my life until I baked this cake. I got tired of asking other to make a double chocolate cake for me. As a first time cake baker, I was able to use the original recipe with no problems and my cake turned out awesome. I served it for Christmas day dinner for dessert and my family was blown away!!!

to the reviewer below me.... Why mess up this perfectly fine recipe? You made a lot of changes to this cake. Just for fun I made both versions and brought them to a New years eve party. Guess what? The guests at the party preferred the actual recipe as listed. The only thing I would recommend doing differently is using parchment paper instead of wax paper, every thing else creates a different kind of cake. Also your frosting was not really a ganache. The recipe in calls enough chocolate for a ganache style frosting and this is why so many people LOVE this cake!

BAKERS/COOKS!! Let me tell you something!! I've been baking for over 35 years & this is by far the best Chocolate Cake I've ever made & tasted!! I've been baking since I was 12 yrs old. If anyone is having problems making this cake, then you're doing something wrong!! I made this cake the 1st time out & I did so by reducing all the ingredients by 1/3 so that I wouldn't waste that much in case it didn't turn out right. I used 2 - 9 inch pans along with Hersheys Chocolate. Now I use GHIRARDELLI Semi-Sweet Chips & Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. I've tweeked the recipe just slightly a little to take this cake to another level. The adjustments that I've made is as follows: Use Parchment Paper instead of wax paper. Use 2 3/4 cups of Soft n Silk Cake Flour instead of All Purpose Flour. SIFT TWICE!! Use 4 eggs instead of 3. Brew 3 CUPS, (THAT'S RIGHTY, 3 CUPS) of water with 3 TBSP of Dunkin Donuts Coffee. The Xtra 1 1/2 cups of water in coffee will replace using actual Buttermilk. Instead use 7 TBSN of SACO CULTURED POWDERED BUTTERMILK BLEND. Sift this in with the flour. This powder is the bomb!! Regular Buttermilk can't touch this stuff!! Their Buttermilk pancake recipe is the bomb too. Not only that, it will save you money in the long run for using regular buttermilk. When stirring 4 eggs, add 1 TSPN of Vanilla along with Vegetable Oil & 3 cups of sugar. DO NOT SIFT SUGAR WITH FLOUR!! Mix for 4 mins with egg mixture. Add FLOUR/BUTTERMILK MIXTURE & COFFEE/CHOCOLATE MIXTURE alternately to eggs, sugar, oil, & vanilla. This batter can be used in 3 - 9 inch pans as well as 2 - 10 inch pans. USE A OVEN THERMOMETER!! Oven temperature could change according to what type of pans yu use. Pans should bake in 45 - 50 mins. FROSTING - Use just 8 oz. of chocolate instead of 16 oz. This will help make the frosting more creamier & not as thick. If you have any questions, you can e-mail me at MARYHEMBY@SBCGLOBAL.NET. Happy Baking

This was good, but didn't blow me, or anyone else away. I followed the recipe exactly, except I made an 8 1/2 inch 3 layer cake and a few mini muffins with the leftover batter, also made a larger batch of ganache. It was an absolutely gorgeous cake, chocolately and moist, but very heavy and dense, the ganache was overkill. It was comparable to eating a large chunk of chocolate rather than eating a cake. It sat in my stomach uncomfortably like a brick. This was made for my son's birthday, nobody went for seconds, the room was quite, my mother in law did not finish her slice. Other cakes I have made with my usual recipes for my family are gone in one sitting. Hate to be the odd one out with all the rave reviews, but I've had better cakes and I will not be making this one again.

Loved this! Based on previous reviews, I halved the recipe and make two thin 9" layers. I halved the ganache recipe, but next time I will make the full batch with half the cake. I didn't wait for the ganache to harden, I just poured it over the cake. I used Bake Easy Non-Stick spray and didn't have a problem (I find it works better than Pam). Enjoy :-)

I made this cake for my mom's birthday. I halved the cake recipe to make two 8 inch layers, which worked perfectly. I made the full amount of ganache frosting and was able to thickly frost the entire cake. I did not frost between the layers but instead put in a layer of Bailey's Irish Cream Haagen Dazs. I think I would have had enough frosting for a thin layer in the middle, though. The cake and frosting held up well in the freezer and tasted incredible with the ice cream layer even though I only used Baker's chocolate and Hershey's cocoa. The 8 inch layers took just 45 minutes to bake at 300 degrees in my oven.

Awesome cake. Bakes evenly - without a hill in the middle. Batter is easy to make. I could have preferred the frosting to be less sweet (I had to use honey instead of corn syrup, and I guess it's sweeter). It can work very well with some sort of jam in the middle - raspberry or sour cherry, perhaps.

The cake itself is just delicious- so dark, so moist. However, I found the ganache frosting difficult to work with- first it was too runny, then after chilling it got hard. Also intensely chocolatey. If you have trouble spreading the frosting, use the old hot knife trick, or put your bowl of frosting in a double boiler for just a second. I used 8 inch cake pans and saved about a fifth of the batter. Then I made six cupcakes with the extra, which were just delicious unfrosted!

This was a wonderful cake. I followed the recipe as written, except used a vanilla buttercream frosting instead of the ganache. The cake was very moist, not overly rich but satisfyingly chocolatey. I concur with those who thought the recipe was too large. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly into two 8-inch round pans. That cake fed 10 people with enough for seconds for nearly everyone. (And they loved the cake.)

I followed the recipe using three 9" cake cans and filling the pans 1/2 way. I used a spray containing flour and oil on the pans, lined the pans with parchment and sprayed again - no problem with sticking. The cakes came out perfectly. Had a tiny bit of batter left. I put the frosting in the freezer and stirred every few minutes - it was ready to spread in about 10 minutes. I lined the top of the frosted cake with fresh raspberries and served with barely sweetened whipped cream. It was a major hit. Beautiful cake that looks like it came from a bakery...super moist and cuts beautifully. Very rich - this cake should serve 20 easily.

This cake WAS delicious and over the top rich BUT be careful with your pan size as other reviewers have mentioned. I used two 9" cake pans, which I believe is what most of us have in our cabinets. Although I left some batter in the bowl, I still ended up overfilling the pans, and the batter ran over and burned on the bottom of the oven. It was a terrible mess and I wondered if it would ruin the flavor of the cakes because of the smoke issue inside the oven and the fact that I opened and closed the oven door multiple times during baking, trying to remove the biggest globs of batter. The cakes came out of the oven BLACK because of the dark chocolate and I thought they were ruined, so dark was the color. However, they were absolutely delicious! If you have 9" pans, three would be perfect to use with this recipe. I also second the need for greasing and flouring and then using parchment paper on the bottom of the cake pans(also greased and floured). It's a good rule of thumb to follow in most cases anyway to be on the safe side. There's nothing worse than to loose a layer of cake on the bottom of a pan which always makes frosting it so much more difficult!

The texture of this cake is firm and it has a medium crumb. Very moist. Almost gooey. Very delicious. There is a huge difference with the frosting between using gourmet chocolate and the store bought w/o the cocoa butter. And the ganache handles differently depending on that as well. It is very creamy and over the top delicious with the proper chocolate. You need to let it set to firm up before using, so allow extra time for this. My customers rave about this and come back again and again to order whole ones for gifts. Be safe and bake with trays under your pans. Until you get a feel for it, it can have a tendency to run over while baking. Always use parchment to line sheets. You will be a happier baker if you do. This is moist and chocolately just the way a chocolate cake should be. Not at all airy or fluffy. I have nothing negative to say about this recipe. And neither do my customers. I follow the recipe as written, no changes at all. (except I do vary the fillings, decor, etc....) Try this, you will not be disappointed.

One other thing - 300 degrees is fine if it's convection bake - but too slow if it's not. Try 325 for conventional ovens.

I've made this cake several times; exactly as written and, subsequently, with a little tinkering. I found it at its best when I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and used a half cup of melted butter & quarter cup of walnut oil for the vegetable oil. The results were an even better flavor and texture - really superb. (I find, often, that cakes that rely on oil alone can result in a cake with a heavy, greasy and unappealing crumb.)

I adapted this recipe for a three tier oval wedding cake that was a complete success. The bride & groom are chocoholics and this cake did the trick. I increased the cake ingredients by half. Instead of the raspberry filling, I made white chocolate buttercream that I studded all over with fresh raspberries. There was enough ganache without increasing the recipe, even with some piped bead detail at the base of each tier. The wedding happened on the Outer Banks of NC, so I decorated the cake with a cascade of gaillardia flowers that bloom in the dunes. It was quite lovely and delicious.

Yummy indeed, but do be careful to have the right size bakeware. My cakes boiled over since I wasn't using large enough trays - a fantastic mess. Eating the mess, though, gave me quite a nice buzz!

I too have received raves about this cake. It has been proclaimed the best chocolate cake ever. Guests at a party asked, "where did you get the cake". Be sure and use the parchment - not just baking spray. The cake will stick to the pan.

I made this for my chocolate-crazed husband for his birthday and he loved it!! It was so rich and moist-- like a restaurant would serve! I found even 1 hour was a bit too much so watch out as you are baking it (although my oven is hot.) ALso, make sure to cool the frosting enough before spreading or it will ooze everywhere. We will definitely make this again! (Although perhaps will use decaf coffee next time because between chocolate and coffee we were up all night each night we ate the cake!)

Great cake, but I had an 'I Love Lucy' experience with the frosting - Looked so good - I was about to frost the cake when I decided to sample the icing - UGH - I had used UNsweetened Callebaut by mistake. Remedy was a series of messes - xxxx sugar turned it grainy - additional cream turned the grainy mess into stiff cement - I was determined not to waste a lb of Callebaut! Finally, after frantic efforts and much loud cursing - reheating and an immersion blender gave me a passable icing. I used Chocolate Whipped Cream between the layers (from this site), hoping to offset what was still not especially sweet icing. After all that - it was still fabulous (think I'd do the choc. whipped cream again) BTW,batter was perfect amount for three 9" layers baked for 50 minutes

It is the buttermilk that makes all the difference! This cake was so moist my hands stuck to the top of it when i tried to invert it (not sure if that's good or bad, ha). In tune with that, my cake stuck to the pan like NONE OTHER... It might have been because I used Pam and no parchment paper, but I've made a million cakes this way and never have had the hardened debacle that practically ruined the bottom of my cake pan. After one batch I just had to make cupcakes with paper liners so that I would be sure they got out of the pan. Ganache came out perfectly, and although the cake tasted wonderful, I had a paper plate full of crumbled cake mounds from prying it out of the pan.......

Wow. This is a keeper! Moist cake, rich frosting. I only had 1 minor problem: my cake pans were not quite 2 inches deep and I had a little too much batter (but that's what cupcake pans are for!). This could also be fantastic with a mocha frosting.

After reading almost all of the reviews I was expecting to be pleased but not blown away by this cake. I was wrong. It turned out lovely and my aunt, a chef, asked for the recipe! I made it for my mother's birthday, having never made a cake before, and used boiled white icing instead of the ganache, and she said it was just like her mom's old cake recipe. I used 2 9 inch pans for 43 minutes and then made mini cupcakes with the rest of the batter and baked them for about 15 minutes. Everyone loved how moist it was and I had no problem with crumbling or frosting the cake. Remember, that cooling is the key for cooks who were having a problem with that. Mine cooled for almost three hours and was great! Will always use this recipe!

I made this cake, but was out of cocoa powder. So I used 1#5- chocolate, and took out 1 1/2 cups sugar and out 1/4 c. oil. It is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used. It has almost the texture of a flourless cake.

Excellent tasting cake! The addition of the coffee added a subtle touch, accentuating the chocolate taste. It took longer for the ganache to set up (I used Callebaut semi-sweet) than I thought it would, but didn't pose a problem spreading it on the cake. The cake was very moist and the cake/ganache combo was a good fit.

I have been making this recipe for about 3 years now- it's always a huge hit. I tinkered with 7 different chocolate cake recipes, trying to find "the one" for my husband. This is his idea of perfect chocolate cake and he won't let me make anything else for his birthday (he doesn't even want a cake from a bakery). I bake the cake using semisweet ghirardelli chocolate the night before so it has sufficient time to cool. I also tightly wrap it in the cake pan with aluminum foil right after it comes out of the oven so none of the moisture escapes- this works great and it stays SO moist! I make the ganache in the morning, also giving that plenty of time to cool before applying and then refrigerate the cake inside of a portable plastic cake holder. It's so good cold! Coffee is not supposed to be a distinctive flavor- often coffee is used in chocolate recipes to enhance the flavor of chocolate, not stand on its own. I personally use a chocolate flavored coffee because my husband can't stand coffee (he had no clue it was in the cake) and I didn't want to risk it! The more chocolate the flavor, the better anyway. This is definitely deep and luxurious.

It is a delicious, moist, rich chocolate cake. Maybe too chocolaty for people that prefer vanilla. I would definitely make it again. I used Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate, hersheys regular cocoa powder, brewed chocolate flavored coffee and cultured buttermilk. I wonder it I use espresso it would still be good.

This is an excellent chocolate cake. I have made it several times and everyone loved it. Keep in mind while reading this that it is designed for 10" pans. Those are huge, I only have 9". while that does not seem like much of a change the volume is dramatic. Time to remember your geometry and calculated the difference.

Incredible. This made 2 9" layers and a dozen cupcakes. The only changes I made was to use more bittersweet chocolate that semi-sweet. Leave yourself PLENTY OF TIME to make this cake. The time is well worth it. At the end of the night I realized my guests had stolen cupcakes out of the refrigerator before sneaking out the door. That is the ultimate compliment!

This is a great recipe and a delicious cake. Because I am a baking beginner, I thought my trying to make this cake would be a disaster, but I was pleasantly surprised. The cake actually turned out to be everything I wished it would be  moist and extra chocolaty. It even looked as good as the picture. Not that Im trying to brag (too much), I know my success was due to this wonderful recipe, and not my novice baking skills. Thanks to this recipe I am more confident, and think I may get the hang of this baking thing.

Seriously, this is probably the best cake I've ever made and it's not just because of my cooking skills. Amazing recipe!

I love this cake! I just made it for the second time and it turned out just as good as the first time. a very consistent recipe. both times i have used bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet. the first time i used expensive chocolate and this time all i had was trader joe's 1 lb. belgian chocolate bar. i couldn't tell the difference. i also baked the cake in 9 inch pans and the cooking time was still 1hr. finally, both times i have made the cake at the last minute and have eaten it still warm. i don't think this is how it was intended to be eaten but it is great that way.

It was great!! My first non-boxed cake ever!! I put in an extra pinch of baking soda, and forgot to put the butter in the Ganache frosting...I think that's (no butter) what made it less runny than I read it being described by someone else who made it. It solidified in the fridge and came out of the fridge looking (and tasting) alot more professional. Moist cake, not grainy at all, no crumbling, just right...never knew I could bake like that!! The Ganache is rich though, I used Ghirardelli choclolate, and came out with leftover icing...Enjoy guys, don't make this cake while in a rotten mood....

I had been looking for a moist, dark dense (but not a pound) chocolate cake like this for an eternity. This cake was the answer to my prayers. I have family and friends beg me to make it for them for special occasions. I have learned that the layers do need to be very cool before they are manipulated for frosting.. they are very tender. Also, a fluffier, sour cream based chocolate frosting is a better partner to the cake than the ganache.. the ganache is overkill.

Rating: 3
I have a copy of this recipe from the LA Times S.O.S. 9/17/2003. It gives a double recipe for the ganache frosting. 2c. heavy cream, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. light corn syrup, 1 lb. bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into sm. pieces. (Same prep. instructions) Also that recipe calls for a 350 degree oven and an apprx. 45 min. baking time. Everything else about the recipe is the same.I used 3 9" pans so the baking time was 30 min. I agree it's a bit crumbly but a great flavor. A the double recipe for the frosting is plenty.

Rating: 3
I would like to change my previous rating--this cake is much better the next day! I usually prefer cakes on the day they are baked but this one improves greatly after being refrigerated overnight. I let it sit out for an hour before slicing and found the crumb had "come together" and is much more pleasing. The ganache is smoothly richly chocolatey but I agree with prev poster--I would make 1&1/2 recipes for generous coating.

Rating: 2
I really really wanted to LOVE this cake after reading so many glowing reviews but agree with last post, good but not fabulous. I found the crumb to be very coarse which made the cake seem very crude. I agree with all who said the coffee was not a distinct flavor so do not avoid this cake for that reason. The ganache was very good but barely sufficient to cover the cake. I even whipped it because I love whipped ganache and had just enough to cover. I made 2 10 inch layers, used Callebaut chocolate as specified. Mine required less cooking time than specified, tested done at 45 minutes. The flavor is intensely chocolately but I very much prefer a cake with a finer texture and more tender crumb.

Rating: 3
Good, but not fabulous. Made sure to not overbake, and was still crumbly--very moist, but crumbly. Actually a little bland, the aftertaste is better than the true flavor. Didn't take an obscene amount of time, baked 4 (thin) 8-in. layers and 12 cupcakes in 2 hrs. I think that often people are swayed by popular opion when writing reviews; I feel that the "Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Buttercream" is a better cake recipe than this one-- finer, more velvety crumb, holds together, bigger flavor. I did like the added depth that coffee gave the cake. I will make the other cake substituting coffee for water next time. Did not make either frosting, this review is only on the cake.

Another three hour dessert. Excellent cake. Moist and great flavor, and with the ganache frosting, a perfect match. Just a tip: don't start making this cake at 9 pm, or you won't be fifnished until around 12:30 or 1, and if you use an 8x2 inch round pan, don't fill the cake pans up to high, or they will bake over, and just pur the excess into smaller baking dishes. But again, excellent dessert.

Taste good. Presentation is terrible. This cake crumbled to pieces as I spread the frosting on it. The frosting took forever to "set up" and slid all over the cake as I spread it around. Won't make again, due to the time and effort that was put into it... but it did taste rather good.

I just made this cake as part of a three tier surprise 40th birthday cake. I doubled the cake recipe using Sharfenburger Dutch Cocoa,and Trader Joes Semisweet and Bittersweet Chocolate bars (which are much less expensive and excellent chocolate to bake with). The doubled recipe went in one 12"X3", one 10" X 2" and one 6"X 3" cake pans. each tier was cut in two and layered with chocolate ganache, chocolate mousse (both from Triple chocolate celebration cake from this site) and crushed toffee bars. I frosted the entire cake in a chocolate buttercream. WOW, the cake was fudgey and moist (which did make the 12" layer a little difficult to cut and handle)with a great (not too overpowering) chocolate flavor. The cake as I made it was rich and served 40-50 people. Everyone at the party loved the cake (especially the birthday girl).

This was so disappointing! I was so excited to make this recipe given all of the wonderful reviews that it has received. I followed the recipe to a "T", and used high quality chocolate. Though my family is full of self- professed "dessert snobs" we all admitted that we had eaten boxed mix cakes before with MUCH better flavor than this cake. I will admit, though, that the texture of this cake was lovely.

When I made this cake people said some of the following things to me: I just might have to hurt you., I know you put drugs in this cake, This is the best cake I have ever eaten. I followed the recipe to the letter and used Ghirardelli chocolate. Even the people who say they hate coffee thought this cake was the best. So just know that the coffee flavor doesnt come through but adds a little accent to the chocolate. Hands down this is the best cake I have ever made.

This was an amazingly easy & delicious chocolate layer cake. Everyone has already said it in the reviews. So the only gems I have to add are that I used Omega-3 (Smart Balance) oil and Omega 3 enhanced eggs, organic 72% cocoa chocolate and instead of the frosting in between layers, I used apricot & seedless blackberry fruit puree. So for a very decadent tasting & appearing cake, it was rather healthful - guilt minimizing. If you like chocolate, this is it.

This is one heck of a chocolate cake! I have made it twice, once with cake flour and most recently (like, today!) with all- purpose flour for my husband's birthday. I prefer the all-purpose flour as the cake flour makes the cake a little too soft, and "powdery". It is a rather fudgy cake, but not heavy and brownie-like. My kids adored it. Used Hershey's dutch cocoa and it was black as night. Also, instead of using the ganache recipe as a frosting, used it as a filling for a 9x13 cake along with some raspberry jam. Frosting was a vanilla italian buttercream. It made for a very attractive presentation. This cake was a star!

this cake worked out beautifully despite using cheaper chocolate and yogurt instead of buttermilk- moist, and rich, no coffee aftertaste- i used a marscapone frosting instead of the ganache, which seemed to cut the sweet a bit and went over very well with guests.

OK, so this is a good chocolate cake, but its not swoon material. I paid great attention to the amount of ingredients, weighing them out. It was not crumbly; it was moist. It did not taste like coffee. It was very chocolatey. Maybe a different frosting would have made a difference? This one is, as one reviewer said, basically melted chocolate chips. It was easy to make and good, but not the be all and end all. Very rich.

I made this cake in 3 8.5 inch pans and cooked them for 50 minutes ( with the little bit of extra batter i made mini cupcakes). When I was icing the cake, i ran out of icing and made a half recipe more, and used some to pipe along the edges of the cake. It was delicious and the birthday who I made it for loved it too! Definately a great fall back chocolate cake recipe!!

Fabulous cake recipe - I made it for the first time and it was exquisitely comparable to a renowned bakery's cake in St. Paul, despite the lack of high quality chocolate (I used a combination of mostly Nestle and a little Ghirardelli). Wait for the cake to cool entirely, though (I'm going to make it one day ahead next time). The frosting also should be chilled for more than an hour - mine was too runny and un- spreadable. It gets better as it sits...

Overall, a great cake. But, given the rave reviews here and the time spent making it, I made sure to really taste both parts - cake and frosting - individually, and then together. I thought the cake was moist but crumbly (to preclude this, I'd slightly decreased my dry ingredients per the comments of a baker from Holland), and not as chocolatey as I'd have expected/liked. The frosting was so decadent (w/ Callebaut semisweet choc.) that a few of us felt ill afterwards, and it hardened to the point that it broke into pieces when the cake was cut. In the future, to the cake I'd add more chocolate (maybe 4 oz.), use stronger coffee, and cut the dry ingredients a tad more. To the frosting, I'd add a bit more cream, halve the corn syrup, and cut the sugar altogether. Nevertheless, everyone loved it, and called it "spectacular."

Fantastic! I had a 9" cake pan, and I had enough batter from the recipe for 3 layers. The layers baked for 45 minutes and were done but not dry. I made 1 1/2 times the icing, using 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate. The cake was excellent the first day, but the texture and flavors had significantly improved by the 2nd day.

I have made this cake with the cheapest chocolate I could get (Sam's Choice) up to medium expensive and I have come to the conclusion that this recipe is so good that it's going to produce an exceptional cake no matter what! It is my favorite of all the chocolate cakes, and I agree thoroughly with the reviewer's comments on "brown" cakes vs good chocolate cakes. My grater was dull, so I bought mini chocolate chips and they worked fine. If my chocolate isn't melted in my coffee, I microwave it a little to hasten the process and it works well for me. I also had only one ten inch cake pan and baked the layers one at a time and that worked well. I do agree that timing is important in baking this cake. I take mine out JUST WHEN the cake tester comes out clean(for my oven I start checking it at 45 minutes). I have also used salted margarine for the ganache and, for me, at least, it turned out fine too. I get rave reviews from this cake, even from my brother-in- law who isn't much of a sweet eater - he made my day by having two pieces! I like this so well, I got a bigger cake plate just for this cake. Thank you, to Epicurious, and whomever is responsible for this spectacular recipe.

The cake itself is phenomenal, perhaps the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It's dark, sweet but not too sweet, with excellent texture. You can't taste the coffee (it just adds to the dark chocolate flavor). The color is beautiful as well. Don't worry about "not Dutch process" cocoa -- I used Dutch process and it was fine. Drawbacks: it took an hour and 40 minutes to cook, and even then it might have done better with 5 extra minutes. This didn't bother me (what's more fun than being in a kitchen full of the smell of a baking chocolate cake?) but it might be an inconvenience to some people. Also: the frosting is so so. It's pretty much melted chocolate chips (I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet), with just enough butter to keep is smooth. It tastes good, but is a weak pairing to such an excellent cake. I suggest this cake, but another frosting.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and used 70% Sharffen-Berger chocolate. I loved the dark results, though I think he would have preferred a sweeter ganache/icing. Next time, I may consider either adding some powdered sugar to the ganache or dropping down to a lower cocoa content. We both agreed, though, that the cake is just about perfect (and refreshingly easy, too!).

Cake recipe is very similar to the "Ebinger's Bakery Chocolate Blackout Cake" from Cook's Country. I like that recipe better because it uses one(!) saucepan for the cake layers, you get the same results for less mess and expense, a very moist cake with intense flavor. The coffee is used to enhance flavor of chocolate, can not be tasted in the final product. Parchment paper is better than wax paper, for the user that complained about it sticking...cook's country is a good site for explaining the reasons behind the ingredients..will use their recipe for the layers and the epicurious recipe for the frosting. Also heavenly if you substitute peanut butter mousse (from this site) for ganache, and crumble part of one layer to coat the outside...

I have tried cake after cake to find one that tastes like chocolate, not like "brown" as most chocolate cake recipes (including the one on the back of the Hershey's cocoa container) do. If you are a huge fan of the Hershey's cocoa-type cake, this one might not be for you. It tastes of deep, rich bittersweet chocolate, not a lightly chocolate flavored brown cake as so many are.

I did not like this cake! I ended up throwing 3/4 of the cake out because it wasn't worth the calories! It was a bit dry and coffee flavor too strong. Next time I'll stick with the best recipe ever - the one on the back of the Herseys Cocoa Powder can.

This was indeed an amazing, perfect, black-and- chocolately-as- midnight cake that will replace my other pretty-darned- amazing chocolate layer cake...with one caveat. I made it with my 9 year old daughter and her two friends and we were all initially dismayed that the cake batter, and subsequently the cake, tasted too strongly of coffee. After a day the taste quieted down and blended but next time I might do half coffee half hot water. Otherwise, perfect.

OM freaking G!! This has to be the most beautiful cake I've made. I am not a pro baker and made more of a proletariat version of the cake using Ghiradelli chocolate and hershey's cocoa in the cake and Nestle's mini chocolate chips in the frosting. You don't HAVE to use the finer chocolate, but I'm sure it does lend a more refined flavor perhaps. I made several mistakes making the cake and it still turned out moist and wonderful. I did not let the eggs warm to room temp. I used two 9 inch pans since I couldn't find 10 inch pans. I totally forgot to preheat the oven until the batter was poured in the pans. Oh well. All turned out well. The frosting is easy and divine. To those who said it was too runny, I think they probably didn't let it rest long enough or chill it. I left mine on the counter and, after a few hours,it was fudgey goodness. I did a crumb coat, chilled it in the fridge and then finished it up with room temp frosting. It's similar to a Martha Stewart recipe (Mrs Millman's frosting?) but came out so much better. It's quite good on strawberries as well I might add. All in all, a delicious cake that even a baking flunky like me can make (and look good too).

Have made this a zillion times and it is a winner, no doubt. Few points, for those who do not have "hot brewed coffee" at hand, I put in a tablespoon of instant with equivalent amount of water mentioned in recipe. For those who want to substitute the buttermilk, natural yogurt works beautifully. As for the frosting, 2 points to be made: Definitely make it 1-1/2 the amount for a comfortable spread. 2nd point is the amount of fine dark chocolate ( I used excellent 70% stuff) it asks for is unnecessary and too costly. I buy 4 bars of 100g of dark chocolate every time, 75 g go into the cake as mentioned in recipe, the other 325g are used for the Ganash (remember done at 1 and 1/2 times the amount) and it comes out dark as night and luscious! If I were to follow the recipe (at 1 and 1/2 ratio) I would be at 750g of chocolate, even at the stated amount in recipe, which is 500g for ganash plus the 75g for the cake, total of almost 600g...Unnecessary and too expensive!

This cake was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. I had no problems with it crumbling. Next time, I will use the frosting recipe from the stout cake recipe as it uses less ingredients and is just as tasty. I used Nestle chocolate chips and it turned out great. I can't imagine how good it would be if I used a finer quality chocolate.

I was disappointed. I won't say this cake was bad, because it wasn't, but it definitely was not the fabulous cake I wanted to make for my friend's birthday party! The ganache was very good, but the cake lacked both flavor and a nice texture. It was very grainy and fell apart. Followed the recipe exactly - won't make again.

I have made this a several times now, using 10" pans. 1 hour was plenty of time in the oven. The frosting was easy to work with after it cooled down a bit in the fridge. The frosting made the cake look fabulous! My chocoholic friend swears this is the best chocolate cake she has ever had. I'm not a chocolate eating person, but I make chocolate desserts for my friends. I think they'll keep me around for cakes like this!!

This was an unbelievably, eye-rollingly delicious! I didn't have any corn syrup, so didn't use. Made no difference to taste and "elasticity" was fine, as long as I refrigerated the granache. The best cake ever.

If your ganache was runny you need to let it cool more. If you let it get to room temp you can spread it like anyother frosting.. it's like spreadable fudge.

To a cook in Holland re: why can't you use dutch processed cocoa in this recipe: Don't take it personally !! It has something to do with the acid level in regular cocoa that reacts better with the baking soda. I suspect the Dutch processed cocoa would leave this cake a bit flat! This is a great cake and I make it lately with a marshmallow fluff instead of the ganache for a little contrast to the dense chocolatey-ness of it !! I think what you could use is the same stuff in epicurious.com's "de vil dog cake;" I use the recipe off the cover of Dorie Greenspan's "Baking. "

This was awesome.....Even better the next day. I didnt realize the pans needed were ten in. until it was too late but it didnt matter. A little spilled over the edges, but I end up trimming most cakes I make anyways. Next time I may just use milk chocolate. I dont think the 72% chocolate I used made that much of a difference.

The taste of this cake was great - deep, dark chocolate decadence. The problem I had was with the texture. While it wasn't dry, the cake was crumbly; after cutting 1/4 of the cake, there was a pile of cake crumbs on the platter. Still searching for the perfect chocolate cake recipe...

This recipe is the best - moist and not too sweet. Made for my niece's BD,she wanted a white frosting so I frosted cake William-Sonoma's Cream Cheese frosting and it was great, but will try w/the Ganache next time. High recommend this recipe.

I'm sold. I was skeptical that this cake could be as good as the hundreds of glowing reviews, but it is. I made it exactly according to the recipe, no variations. I used the video techniques to ice the cake, and it turned out even more lovely than the photo here - a glossy, smooth, flawless chocolate surface that I further decorated with little frosting roses from my pastry bag. I used two 9 inch pans and baked for just under an hour. I thought the cake layers were too soft and maybe I should have cooked it longer at first, but once the cake was together, my concerns vanished. It was dense, moist, not at all crumbly. The ganache is amazing and its consistency "holds" the cake together beautifully. There is absolutely no coffee taste in the cake, even though you can still taste the coffee if you lick the batter beaters! Because I used the smaller pans, I made cupcakes with the extra batter, and those were yummy too. I can't imagine really ever needing to try another chocolate cake recipe now.

Really can't believe all the stunning reviews for this cake. It was Good, not great. Certainly not the best cake I've ever made. Used great chocolate and did everything right- to the folks who say that the people who give negative reviews must have done something wrong. It was fine, but nobody was wowed. Annoyed I spent so much time and money on this.

This cake is fantastic - can't go wrong with chocolate, buttermilk and coffee! I made it for my niece's baby shower, and it was a huge hit! I used espresso for the coffee, frosted it with a white chocolate whipped cream frosting, and served it with strawberries and homemade ice cream. This one is a definite keeper!

Rating: 4
We used powdered buttermilk in the batter and only made 1/2 of the ganache recipe, substituting bittersweet chocolate for semisweet. Baked in two 9" deep-dish pans, then split the layers, filled with ganache and iced with whipped cream. Everyone was wowed by the tender fudginess of the cake and just a little ganache between layers was plenty. This cake was fantastic - we dressed it up a lot, but I'm sure it would be a great simple birthday cake, too.

I made this caek exactly as prescribed for a baby shower at my office. Only change was I did not layer it, but created two separate layers to increase the yield a bit for a larger crowd. Despite all the wonderful reviews, I was surprised at how good it really was!

Amazing! Used bittersweet instead of semi-sweet to cut the sugar, and don't skip the wax paper! Otherwise it loses a layer on the bottom, no matter how well you butter and flour the pan. A little crumbly, but by no means dry... Not sure how to fix it.

thank you to all who commented on this recipe reading your reviews was helpful. i used 3 8" pans, 3 cups of batter in each. they baked at 300 for 48". i also used the bittersweet choc. for both the cake and frosting. if i make this again i will use the expresso and bittersweet for the cake but try a lighter sweeter chocolate for the frosting. to compensate i offered a sweet cream and raspberry presesntation on the plate which was quite lovely.

I have been searching for the perfect chocolate cake recipe and I have FOUND IT! The first time that I made this cake I did not own 10-inch cake pans so I used three 9-inch pans and honestly the cake was too tall. It shifts when you try to cut it. The second time that I made it I put fresh whipped cream between the layers and it was fantastic.

Chocolate cakes are my absolute weakness...and this one is by far the best chocolate cake I've eaten. I used Guittard chocolate chips for both the cake and the frosting, just measuring out the amounts needed. This cake is exceptional, as everyone who tasted it also thought.

This cake was even better than expected. I'm not usually a fan of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, but this cake was so incredibly moist and the flavor was perfection. The quality seemed to get even better after it aged for a few days. I love to see the look on anyone's face when they take their first bite. I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips for the cake and frosting. Very smooth and easier than chopping up a chocolate bar. I also used two 8" round pans and a 3rd 8"x8" square pan. I made one double layer cake and and extra sheet cake. Just enough frosting for everything. Since discovering this recipe I made the cake twice in three weeks and shared the recipe with three of my friends.

Made for husband's birthday party. Rave reviews from everyone. Would suggest making it in smaller layers, three 8 inch perhaps, since it is very rich. Also, when cooling the layers wrap in a cloth halfway through to keep moist. Will make this forever. Surrounded cake with chocolate dipped strawberries.

O.k, This is hands down the best cake in the world! The night we made it it was trouble, but when the cake was done, we followed the video on how to frost the cake and we cut of the top like they said. The ganache was warm and the cake was out of the oven. We ate that and we new it would be great! My Grandfather is not allowed to eat sugar but he had a bite to! We used butter and served it with chocolate curls (Which came out like bark). It looked like it came out of a box and tasted like I had died and gone to heaven! If there were more forks, I'd fill them in!

To anyone who is experienced with this or similar recipes, is the batter supposed to be somewhat bubbly or did I do something wrong? It is evident that this continued even after it was in the oven. My non- professional guess is that it has to do w/ buttermilk and baking soda maybe?? It tastes great though!

This was by far the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made OR tasted! Everyone loved it! My boyfriend and his friends attached the remainder with forks the following day. Irresistible! I used espresso rather than coffee and put frozen mixed berries in the middle, on top of the middle layer of frosting! Oh my god! so good!

Being a professional baker, I have my tested and proven recipes. Yet I could not resist to try this one after reading all your concern.Well..I must say: for an American recipe it is not bad. American recipes are usually high in flour,sugar and raising agents, and poor in eggs and butter. So is this one, but the European style ganache frosting supports it a great deal. Alltogether a nice cake; could be served with some raspberry coulis and whipped cream on the side. The cake is indeed moist, so complains from some of you about dryness comes forth probably from the following. As you use the cup system to measure your ingredients, every single person has his own way of filling the cup, being more or less precisely. Fill your cup with flour and cocoa a little higher, and you end up with a dry crumbly cake. So my advice: get away from the cup measuring and use the scale. Write down your recipes in grams or ounces amd everything will be much more precise.

It came out as promised, dark and moist. Would make it again. One thing I found unclear in the recipe: "1-1/2 cups hot brewed coffee" did not specify amount of instant coffee used, I put in one tablespoon, it worked great. Plus being in the Middle East, Buttermilk is not found easily, I substituted it with one cup of yogurt, it came out perfect. Finally, I would recommend doing the Ganache Frosting at least 1-1/4 times if not 1-1/2 times to have a comfortable spread.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent cake recipe. So easy to make. I was a little leery since the recipe didn't call for butter but I swear you don't really miss it. I made a chocolate/whipped cream frosting instead of the ganache (wanted to bring down the chocolate quotient). Anyway, highly recommended!

I made this cake based on the number of positive reviews and the segment on the Today Show. I could not have been more disappointed. I've made many other cakes that were MUCH better than this.

I seen this cake on the Today Show; so I looked it up and made it for a going away party at work. I didnt have 10 inch pans so I just stuck it in 2 9 inch pans BAD MISTAKE... it ran over into the oven and made a big mess. Anyways... it was REALLY chocolatety but it was good, you may need to warn people how rich it is& may need to take out a chocolate insurance policy for those who goes into convulsions from all that chocolate (haha). The cake was a big hit, it was all gone. And I've had people already asking for the recipe. I used Nestle semi-sweet chocolate because I am too poor to afford "Fine quality chocolate" but nestle has the seal of the American Culinary Award, so I thought it would be fine. It worked well. The icing is wonderful. The cake is really good, and I even tried the batter and it was PRETTY TASTY. All together it was a good cake, but make sure you dont use 2 nine inch pans make it 3 if you do...

After all the great reviews, I must say that I was disap- pointed in the end result. While I thought the cake had good basic flavor, I didn't care for the oily aftertaste.Further, I found it dry and crumbly which may be my fault. I did it in 2 deep 9-inch pans and baked it for 65 minutes. Too long! I liked the frosting very much, however, and would make that again, but probably not the cake.

DELICIOUS! So moist, chocolatey, but not overly rich. The chocolate ganache frosting was incredibly smooth - to me, it was the best part of the whole cake. I topped the cake with raspberries and think that they helped a lot in complementing the cake well. I baked the cake in 9.5 x 1.5 round pans, since I couldn't find the 10x2 inch pans in any stores nearby, and it didn't overflow like others seemed to have experienced. It did rise somewhat high above the pans and made me nervous, but it rose somewhat inward and I had no problems with it in the end. It was a crowd-pleaser and I'll definitely make this one again!

I made this in Dec for a couple birthdays and it's my favorite chocolate cake recipe! I used 1 9" round metal cake pan, and poured the rest of the batter in cupcake pans. I happened to use 1 metal cupcake pan and 1 silicone (that was what I had.) The cupcakes in the metal pan turned out perfectly round and nicely risen. For the cook from Berlin - the cupcakes baked in silicone didn't rise as nicely as those in the metal pan and came out really flat and the tops spread quite a bit. They also took longer to bake than those in the metal pan. Even though they looked bad, they tasted as good as the cupcakes from the metal pans. For the single layer cake, I topped it with a simple ganache, spread it around the top and sides and then let it set. It made a really easy delicious birthday cake with a smooth glossy top.

I made it two days after dreaming about it and collecting the best ingredients I could find. Just my luck they don't sell Callebaut in this part of the world. Nevertheless I read another reviewer said it was just fine with lesser quality chocolate, so I decided to try. I'd have to say I disagree. It turned out moist and rich but tasted mostly like all the past chocolate cakes I've made, which also called for coffee, and was none too impressive. I'm pretty sure the cake would taste like all the other reviewers said it would if I had access to better chocolate! Perhaps I used to many subs tho. Buttermilk was also hard to find so I made the usual lemon juice plus milk, waiting until it curdled for substitute. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Has anybody substituted Hershey's semisweet baking chocolate for the cake? Did it work?

I made this cake yesterday and my husband and I could not believe our tastebuds! It is THE best chocolate cake we have ever tasted. EVER. The flavor and moistness of this cake is out of this world. You cannot taste the coffee in it by the way. I didn't have non- Dutch processed cocoa on hand, so I used Dutch processed, but added a hint of lemon juice (to get it's rising effects in the recipe). I also didn't have 2 10" pans, so I used 2 9" pans - the cake is incredibly gignormous. I would opt to half the recipe next time, and make less ganache, as I have tons left over.

Don't bother chopping up the chocolate !! When I'm in a hurry and don't have fancy chocolate around, I use Baker squares and don't even break them in half. The hot coffee in the batter, and then the hot cream in the ganache, when left to sit covering the chocolate... well, it melts just fine as you stir it. Now, the gigantic Scharrfen Berger (sp?) blocks may be a different story, but coarsely chopped has always worked for me. DO be very very careful to look at the pans used in this recipe. I find that three foil pans (8 1/2 inches) work perfectly for a three layer cake, but you have to skimp on the ganache between layers. If you don't have the 10" pans and you glob it all into 9" pans, you will have a volcanic mess on your hands ! The three layer cake is a little precarious to transport and slice but it is lovely. The cake almost tastes like a brownie, but it has a nice satisfying cake texture and is well worth the learning curve. For the people who say it's too complicated: try try again. For the people who say it's a simple cake to make and they did it in ten minutes while simultaneously cooking dinner for their kids: don't sandbag us, man !! Once you've made it, it's simple, but it does involve sifting and melting and brewing coffee and happening to have buttermilk on hand !! But when you've made it once successfully, you'll make it again in ten minutes (who knows, maybe while multitasking even!! and you'll throw all your other chocolate cake recipes away.

If you have trouble cutting the chocolate use a serated knife and start at a corner. Work the edge of the corners only. The chocolate will cut easy and use a easy to wash cutting board and gloves if you have them. Can be a pain to wash off.

I have made this cake a few times now and I must say it is really one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had. I get so many compliments from this one and it makes excellent cupcakes too. My favorite way to present it is to torte the layers and fill with a bittersweet chocolate mousse and then covered in bittersweet chocolate ganache.. a little red raspberry puree for me and.. Heaven on a fork I tell you. If you didn't like this recipe you must have done something wrong because it is amazing. I was skeptical too because of there being no butter in it, but it left me more than pleasantly suprised.

A very impressive and yummy cake! This IS a tricky recipe. Chopping a pound of chocolate is right up there with root canal so I used 2 bags of Ghirardelli chocolate chips  high quality and easy! This frosting recipe is quite a temperamental piece of work. Do NOT over mix and when you pour the mixture into a bowl, use one thats micro safe in case you need this step. Its supposed to thicken up sitting on the counter as it cools. This is good in theory but you would have to baby sit it and catch it at the right time! After a couple of hours on the counter it was still runny so it went in the fridge for a few hours. When I took it out it was hard. Decided to microwave it for 45 seconds at 50% power. It had a few little lumps quite as silky but acceptable. One second longer or a higher heat and it would have been too runny. Next time Id put it in the fridge immediately and then check on it every 30 minutes. The frosting recipe was just enough for the 3 layers but dont spread too generously between layers. You need every bit for the sides. For the cake I used Scharffen cocoa which was expensive but delicious. I put the batter (again do not over mix!) into 3 9 pans which filled the pans up half way (would not go more to avoid overflow). I did 45 minutes exactly but I would start checking at 40 minutes to get a moister product. I greased the pans with Crisco then put in parchment, greased again and coated with cocoa powder. The cakes did release easily but left a small layer of cake in the pan so I would dust more heavily. Is this recipe is worth so much angst? You decide!

Yum! This was super moist and delicious. I was worried about too much coffee flavor but barely noticed it. It has the texture of a boxed cake w/o all the terrible preservatives and hydrogenated fat.

After reading the reviews I was sure this would be spectacular, but it was just average - even leftovers were slow to disappear. There are better chocolate cake recipes

To cook from washington: you can bypass chopping the chocolate by purchasing very good quality semi-sweet chocolate CHIPS...I've done this many times with Ghirardelli choc chips, not as high quality as Callebaut, I admit, but this is one damned fine cake that I've made probably 8 times now and have used a variety of qualities of chocolate and chocolate chips; all 8 times, people were floored by it! Hope this helps!

Amazing cake, I made it for a friend's b-day and she loved it! Instead of coffee, I made 1 cup of espresso and added 1/2 cup of kahlua. I used a processer to chop the chocolate, which basically melted on contact. The only problem I had was the cake overflowing while baking. Will have to use bigger pans next time.

This cake is incredible - very moist. My boyfriend, who is a chocolate cake fanatic, loved it. I think the ganache is possibly a bit too strong, so i may try something else next time. Quick question - does anyone have a good suggestion how best to chop the chocolate? It's incredibly time consuming and hard to just use a knife on it ... I also tried a microplane grater but that wasnt much better. Thanks!

Girls, THIS is the chocoholic cake for you!! This is an exceptionally good chocolate cake--I liked the crumb, which was moist and not too dense, and CHOCOLATY..We are blessed with the best dessert spot in San Diego you'll ever visit called "Extraordinary Desserts" (yes, they are ALL extraordinary). We go there often with our kids, and the best review I had was from my 8 year old who compared the cake(he IS picky) to Extraordinary Desserts, one of the best compliments I could ever have! I used a 10 inch springform pan, and there was a little batter leftover. It took about 2 hours, and unfortunately because I opened the oven door to check on it about 3 times, it went a bit flat (not too much).I had some ganache leftover, and it was great for snacking and dipping strawberries!!!! YUM!!!

the best chocolate cake i've ever had. i decided to forgo the ganache and baked it in a bundt cake pan (greased and flour, no parchment paper). it came out beautifully. used 2 t. vanilla and superfine vanilla sugar. this cake is unbelievably incredible.

I made this cake in a 11 X 15 pan this weekend for my cousin's baby shower (she's a chocoholic like me). Rave reviews! Used cake flour, nice crumb. Next time I'll increase the recipe by 1/3 for this size pan. It was difficult to cut into layers and I ran out of chocolate ganache. The ganache did harden up a bit too much to properly decorate so I heated it up in the microwave and mixed it again until smooth - success!

Rating: 2
This cake was very tasty, BUT I was so disappointed that after all that work, the cake just fell apart when you tried to cut it! And the cake is HUGE! 9 people only got through half of the cake. If I did make it again, I would change the frosting to either milk chocolate or peppermint because it was very rich.

Rating: 4
This cake, while wonderful as it, is my vehicle of choice for all my favorite chocolate flavors. This time of year, I add peppermint oil, and the result is a eating a mint truffle in cake form. I also sometimes add framboise, a little raspberry preserves and fresh raspberries between the layers, and it's perfect for Valentine's Day. I think my next variation will be something with oranges or Cointreau.

This is my first review. I've made this cake twice in the past week! It is fantastic! Also very easy to make. I made 2/3 the recipe and it was still a huge cake both times. The first time, I substituted 1tbsp mayo, 1 tbsp yoghurt, plus milk for the buttermilk. The mayo turned it into one of the moistest most decadent cakes I've ever eaten! This time I substuted cream plus one tbsp of yoghurt for the buttermilk as I again had none. This made for a slightly fluffier, better bake, and still wonderful cake. **Also I have made this with Hershey semisweet Chipits and it is fabulous. And also with fine Belgian chocolate and still to die for. Gotta say - this is the best cake recipe I've tried other than my Grandma's

Rating: 4
I made this for my daughter's sixteenth birthday. Since I live in Japan, it's hard to come by things like buttermilk and quality chocolate, so I had to make due with powdered buttermilk and cheap chocolate; however, this cake was SO DELICIOUS, so MOIST, so...FANTASTIC that I plan on making it again in the very near future. I did not make the ganache because I was in a hurry and used whipped vanilla frosting instead. Still awesome. Can't wait to try it with ganache. I'm in LOVE...

This is an exceptional, and very large, chocolate cake. I made it for Thanksgiving dessert, and it was gone in two days. It was a bit pricey to make, but I would make it again.

Rating: 3
Well, here's my two- cents worth...I have made this cake twice, both times to rave reviews. I have a problem, however, with the presentation and serving. My ganache sets up so hard that it cracks the entire cake when cut and the cake itself also falls apart. So I've always ended up with incomplete slices and a huge pile of crumbs. The ganache is also not shiny, so maybe it's the fault of the Trader Joe's chocolate I use. At any rate, people continue to say that it is the best cake they have ever eaten.

I did not try the recipe for the cake but I did make the frosting. It turned out great. It wasn't too sweet, easily spreadable, and delicious. the texture was smooth and creamy. I will try the cake recipe along with the frosting next time.

This cake turned out perfectly, very moist and you can taste chocolate, not just sugar. I used the frosting recipe from Hershey's cocoa, it is surprisingly awesome...it looks like satin and tastes excellent. The only modification I made was that I used cake flour instead of all purpose.

One more tip re: the sticking issue. I use Crisco (butter has water in it, which makes it absord into the cake) and then dust it with cocoa powder, which helps it pop right out, but doesn't leave white patches all over the nice dark cake.

Rating: 4
If you need to make this in a 9x13, 2/3 of the recipe works perfectly and takes about 55 minutes at 300, at least in my glass Pyrex. Metal would probably be somewhat less. I've made this recipe numerous times and reviewed it more thoroughly a few years ago, but today I needed something super portable, so I thought I'd share the timing for this particular pan.

Rating: 4
I just had to add my two cents. This was simply a wonderful, wonderful cake -- especially when paired with the Milk Chocolate Frosting from the Chocolate Crunch Layer Cake with Milk Chocolate Frosting from Bon Appetit. I baked it in two 9-inch pans, which made layers substantial enough to divide into two for a four-layer beauty. The frosting is to die for. You will have to stop yourself from eating it straight from the bowl. It spreads like silk and makes a lovely presentation when the cake is cut, to boot! My new favorite chocolate cake.

i made this cake as a surprise for my sister's birthday. i consider myself a serious chocoholic, and this was almost too rich for me (just almost...i definitely ate it!!!). i couldn't find callebaut or guittard in my store, so i just used nestle 63%. i'm sure it would have been even more amazing with better chocolate. i also added a splash of vanilla to the ganache (my sister's favorite part of this cake). this cake was beautiful, moist, delicious...everything you could want in a cake. A+!!!

This cake is very rich, but very delicious. I liked it, but some people just really really loved it. I change a couple of things 1) I used espresso (awesome) 2) I made it a 3 layer cake in the 9 inch pans. This required a bit of math, and I needed a huge bowl, but it made the cake quite I sight to behold. People were blown away. I made for my moms 50th birthday and it fit the occasion perfectly. I have been asked to make it again for my grandmothers birthday

A wonderful layer cake. Took the advice and reduced the sugar to 2 cups. I also reduced the oil to 2/3c and reduced the cacao powder to 1 cup. Still rich and moist! I made a lge rectangular cake, and was able to manipulate the layer without cracking or breakage. I used the cake recipe for a Black Forest cake. You can hear the guests sigh with delight when they taste this one!

Love this cake. Very moist, brownie-like and chocolately, bordering on candy (probably due to the sugar/flour ratio). It's my go-to chocolate cake recipe, but I really thing everything should be reduced by a third. Otherwise you get a huge cake. Two layers is plenty.

This is a FANTASTIC cake. I made it for my hubby's 45th and my Godson's 18th and it was gone fast! My recommendation would be to use POWDERED Sugar for the frosting otherwise you're biting into sugar. The recipe instructions do not indicate that. Hubby said it's the BEST Chocolate cake he's ever had. I mixed it w/unsweetened dark chocolate and semi-sweet and it gave a rich chocolatey and not as sweet flavor! GREAT RECIPE!

Rating: 4
I usually use butter over oil in recipes, but decided to try this one as written. The oil allows the chocolate to shine through -- butter would change the flavor of the chocolate with its milk solids. I made this in three 9" pans with 2" sides(need the high sides for all the batter)and baked them for 50 minutes. I've made a million chocolate cakes -- this is a fabulous one!!!

I made this cake and it was delicious. I only had coco powder with sugar so I didn't add so much extra sugar to the recipe and I covered it in the milk chocolate caramel frosting which I made with chocolate that had crispy bits in it,it all turned out delicious and has kept really well, today is the 3rd day and it's still really good. A wonderful recipe that i'll definitly be making again.

This must be the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever tried! It is just rediculous! How could you go wrong with a pound of chocolate in the frosting? I'm not even a big chocolate lover. I prefer a gold cake. It was perfectly moist, it tasted like chocolate - not just like sugar. I even ran out of flour - it calls for 2-1/2 cups of flour, I had only 2 so I substituted wheat flour for the last 1/2 cup. It came out fine, but I imagine it would have been a slightly more airy had I used the white.

This cake was absolutely delicious. It had a rich chocolate taste but not too sweet. My teenage daughter who doesn't eat cake reserved rest of the cake for her. She stuck it in the refrigerator and said it was much better cold. She ate a piece of this cake with milk at every meal until it was gone. Now she keeps asking me when am I planning to make that chocolate cake again. This time I'll make one for her and one for everyone else!

This is the best chocolate cake I have made. It is now my favorite birthday cake. I made it in a 9 X 13 pan, so I didn't use all of the batter.

this recipe is fabulous! After the layers have cooled, I imbibe them with a sugar syrup, sometimes laced with a liqueur of my choice. Everybody says it's delicious.

This is a great chocolate cake! I don't have 10" pans, so I used 9" pans. There was a lot of batter, and not wanting the cakes to go over the top of the pan, I took some batter out and made cupcakes later (they, too, were wonderful). I adjusted the baking time...55 minutes was just right for my oven. I usually stick with recipes that use butter, but this one convinced me that oil in a cake can make a great final product. It was great with buttercream frosting! To Topeka: please don't rate a recipe if you haven't made it. There was nothing difficult about this recipe...and I love walnuts with chocolate cake!

I made this cake once prior to being diagnosed with a gluten/wheat allergy and it was to die for. So, I decided to try and modify it to be gluten free. I changed the flour to Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour (same amounts) and then added 2 1/2 tsp xanthan gum (with the dry ingredients). Otherwise followed the recipe exactly! It was absolutely amazing... please pass this along to anyone you know who suffers from gluten/wheat allergies...they will thank you for it!

I am not a baker by trade, just by heart and very, very good at it ! That being said anyone who says this is not one of the most if not the most excellent Chocolat Cakes ever, has a bad pallet and should not be rating cakes. If the recipe is followed this cake comes out beautiful. All my friends get to choose whatever flavor or type cake they want for their birthdays, I had been wanting to try this one when my neighbor requested a genuine Black Forrest Cake! I added 1/2 times the recipe for the batter for a four layer 9 inch cake , and made the most beautiful black forest cake sprinkle with cherry brandy and brandy soaked tart cherries between the layers of cake and cherry flavored whipped cream. It was beautiful, and he was very, very happy to show it off to his friends and family when they showed up. I can't wait to make it as the recipe calls for it to be made (I might make it 3 layers with chocolate or white chocolate mousse between the layers. Do yourselves a favor, make this cake! And share it you'll be a hero!!!!!

Excellent, very intense chocolate cake, and its extremely easy to make!. I cut the recipe by half and baked in two 8'' pans and it fitted perfectly.

I've never made the ganache, but I've lost track of the number of times I've made this cake. At least five years running now, for my boyfriend's birthdays. said he this morning as he cut himself a slice for breakfast: "Getting this cake IS the special occasion." and by-the-by, this time around I swapped fresh brewed Illy espresso for the hot coffee, and I'd swear by it from now on. The depth of flavour it lends is utterly wonderful.

Really good cake! I didn't love the ganache but that's probably because I'm not the hugest fan of semisweet chocolate. I'd do buttercream next time.

I had to make this cake after reading nearly all of the reviews. I hadn't intended to read them, but with so many, I wanted to see what was going on. It was quite entertaining -- especially the debate about whether this recipe warrants this many reviews. Regardless, I made the cake for my son's 15th birthday to feed a large group of foodies. I used 9.5" square silicone baking pans. The recipe was followed exactly -- baking time and all, although I did use convection. I filled it with a mix of lightly sweetened cream and strawberries, then covered the cake with the frosting by pouring it slowly, and spreading it until it oozed over the sides. Everyone enjoyed this very chocolaty, rich cake. The cream and strawberries were a great accompaniment to the chocolate. The coffee taste mentioned by others was not noticed by any of us -- even those who do not like coffee. The texture of the cake is dense, but not as dense as that of a brownie. I used a combination of Scharffen Burger and Valrhona chocolate because that's what I had on hand. I won't get into the debate about whether this is THE chocolate cake I'll choose whenever we want chocolate cake because there are too many other recipes out there to try. Still, it is an exceptional cake that should be tried.

I've made this 3 times. The first two times I followed the recipe exactly and used the better quality ingrediants and it came out beautifully. Moist, super rich, the best chocolate cake ever. I'd say it is as good as the version served at my favorite locally owned Italian restaurant which sells slices for $6-$7 apiece. This is expensive to make and the 3rd time around I used Ghiradelli and Nestle's (GASP!) chocolate. I then had to substitute a heavy cream/sourcream mixture for the buttermilk. Served with a true vanilla buttercream icing the altered version still tasted great. Wonderful recipe. When using the higher quality ingrediants it is outstanding.

This is a very good rich and somewhat dense chocolate cake. It is almost fudgy. I made a standard ganache (1 cup cream & 16 oz semi-sweet chocolate) instead of adding the butter, etc as the recipe stated. The cake was delicious, but a bit denser than I had anticipated. Overall a great cake though...especially for true chocolate lovers like me.

This cake was simply AWESOME! Nothing changed. I used Nestle Tollhouse semisweet chips and Hersey's baking chocolate (so middle of the road quality chocolate)... still amazing! The cake is best at room temp but even still a little cold, the frosting is great!!!!

This is a keeper!! Both the cake and the ganache were easy to make for something so impressive, and the ganache in particular blew my guests' minds. The combo of buttermilk and coffee for the batter liquids is a terrific idea, adds such depth of flavor without being too sweet or heavy. My rookie-to-this-recipe mistakes were overmixing the cake batter slightly, making it a tiny bit chewy (just follow directions better than I did - personally, next time I would alternate dry and wet in 3 or so additions, to get everything mixed in there faster without splashing stuff all over the counter by adding all the wet first) and trying to ice the moist room-temp cake layers with ganache that had been in the fridge (because I had to make the cake in stages).

A wonderful and beautiful-looking cake, moist and delicious, fancy-restaurant quality. I've made this three times and each time it's a huge hit. I put raspberry jam in between the layers, after frosting the bottom layer, to cut the ganache, to add to the flavor profile. I found that it needed 90 minutes in the oven at 300F with the 10 inch non-stick springform pans I got at Surfas in Culver City, California. They have a website, surfasonline.com.

Rating: 4
I used 9-inch pans and just used about 80% of the batter. The cake and ganache both came together very easily. I had a similar idea to my fellow Minnesotan who used chocolate-dipped strawberries. I dipped Bing cherries in the ganache when it was very liquid and then used those to ring the outside of the top layer. I also cut up about a cup or more of cherries, added some cherry preserves and a tiny bit of kirschwasser. Then I put that in the middle layer over a some ganache. The only problem I had was that the ganache got a little stiff and was then hard to work with. It was very liquid, so I put it in the freezer and then the refrigerator. It took a while to set up but then it stiffened quite a bit. Next time I would watch that more carefully so I catch it before it gets to that point. Otherwise, no problems and everyone loved it.

OMG!! What a wonderfull cake...I have been looking for the best chocolate cake and this is it. I put fresh strawberries in the layer. This is VERY chocolaty. BTW, my kids loved it too. Would be a great cake for any filling. Will try again with a chocolate mousse filling. I had no problem with sinking. I used 10in aluminum pans. Took only 45min to bake. I live overseas and could only get bakers chocolate and it was still phenomenal!!I will hunt down some better chocolate at a German store next time. Just make it!! You will not be sorry.

This cake is as great as every one says. The only new thing I have to add is that I dipped strawberries into the extra chocolate frosting and used them to decorate the cake- do this before the frosting solidifies a bit as it rests. The strawberries were beautiful and tasty!

Before tasting this cake, I told myself that -- in light of 933 other reviews -- there was really no need to me to chime in and make it 934. Well, I changed my mind. The cake is that good. Very (very) moist, very chocolately, and absolutely delicious. I've seen this recipe in the "Buzz Box" for years and years, and I'm only sorry I waited this long to try it!

oh my heavenly! this was my first double cake attempt and my guests LOVED it. i made a peanutbutter icing for the filling and used a store bought chocolate icing for the top. might i say, the peanutbutter icing is an excellent combo with this cake. it melts in your mouth!

I made this cake last night, it fell in the middle and was way to crumbly. The frosting was great! I used ghirardelli chocolate, this cake reminded me of a cooled fudge cake. I will try this recipe next time and modify some things. You should really read ALL the reviews the WILL be very helpful!

I don't know what I was thinking when I decided to make a different recipe for a Memorial Day get-together, called "mom's famous chocolate cake" recipe from the Houston Chronicle that mentioned it was the best chocolate cake recipe.. It wasn't! I wasted $8 on expensive powdered chocolate that the article suggested using instead of Hersheys. I'm never going to stray from this recipe again!!! This is absolutely the best, I've learned my lesson!!!

This is one of the most delicious chocolate cakes I have ever made or eaten. Everyone that has tried it has had the same reaction - it's the chocolate cake you imagine June Cleaver would service the Beaver after school with a big glass of milk. I store outside of the fridge because the texture of the ganache changes once it's refrigerated. Lasts nicely for 3-4 days. Just cover cut portion so it doesn't dry out.

I've made this lots of times--now that I live at 7000 feet I made some modifications and it turned out better than it did when I lived at sea level. Go figure. Used 18 ounces sugar 14.5 ounces flour, reduced both leavening agents by about 1/3, and increased the buttermilk by 3T. Love the look with 10" pans--invested in these after the first time I made the cake. If you have leftovers, they freeze well, and, even better, if you microwave a slice the ganache turns into hot fudge, just add a little mint-chip ice cream. YUM!!

If you're looking for a down and dirty, fudgy, better than Mom's kind of American cake...you've found it. This cake is moist and uber chocolaty. I was searching for a perfect fudge cake to call my own (quite an undertaking for a perfectionist) and with a few modifications this could be it. Go ahead and try this cake before modifying it; you just might LOVE it as is. I personally think this cake is a little too moist (I know, can you believe it) so I have opted to substitute melted butter - slightly browned - for the oil and use 3 medium eggs as opposed to 3 x-large eggs. If this does the trick and gives the cake a little finer texture and a little less moisture as I imagine it will then I can stop the search. The chocolateyness is perfect. Mom thought it was a tad bitter, but being from Oregon means that strong coffee is synonymous with espresso; so weaken the coffee if you want a mellower bite and keep in mind Moms favorite chocolate cake is a pale brown. This cake holds well and maintains its texture even when served right from the fridge. The frosting is fabulous! I threw in an extra handful of bittersweet chocolate to ensure it set up properly...probably an ounce or so. All in all this is a great cake. And for those reviewers acting all snotty over the texture and going on about cake flour and crumb please understand this is a fudge cake this is not a sponge, a financier or genoise. Those are a different animal completely&this will not work as a tort base, a roll or with buttercream. This is a diner style, good ol Chocolate Cake straight up! Enjoy it.

Not such a comfortable shoe, in my opinion... I got these shoes because I thought they looked cool and I like different looking shoes. Although they aren't necessarily uncomfortable, they are the best feeling shoes either, and they are extremely heavy! I would recommend them for the look for times where you aren't doing excessive walking only.

This is an easy, delicious and VERY RICH cake. I read other reviews that said make only half the frosting and I disagree since I used the entire batch and would have really been stuck if I had made only half the recipe. I had just enough frosting. Maybe theirs came out thin but mine was thick. I used heavy whipping cream with the chocolate.

Rating: 4
This cake is so good I used it at the bakery where I worked for the past 11 months and I had trouble keeping it stocked because it was our most popular item. I find that the difficulty of preparatiion is in beating the eggs stiff enough. It will help to slightly warm the eggs before whipping, if they're cold, and you may need to whip longer than the recipe says; they should be pretty stiff! I don't use the filling or icing recipe that accompanines it. Serve at room temperature.

I made this cake once, two years ago, and liked it...but didn't LOVE it. I used 2 10-in pans and baked it well over the required time, and it was still very moist. I'm wondering: Is this cake really supposed to be baked at 300 degrees? No one has ever commented on the baking temperature, which has always struck me as being very low. I'd love to hear about the advice and experience of others on the topic of temperature and timing.

Didn't have the right pans so cooked in a rectangular sheet cake pan, pouring extra batter in well-greased bundt cake pan. Didn't make the icing. ---Preparation: Easy ---Taste: Very good. ---Looks: Very good: dark and moist. ---Texture: Fair. I find I prefer the crumb and substance of a butter cake as opposed to this oil cake. This cake is nicely moist and chocolately, though. --- Preparation: Easy. It did stick to the Bundt cake pan but that was just an experiment. Was fine in a greased rectangular sheet pan with the bottom lined with greased parchment paper. --Best served: The day after making it. Texture improves.

Have made this cake three times and each time it is a hit. Great cake to partially freeze, then slice the layers in half (made two separate cakes) and fill with your favorite ice cream; refreeze. Then put a thin layer of the ganache and refreeze. Served it at a party with adults and kids and all loved it. Now my 9 year old has requested it for his upcoming birthday.

Rating: 4
This is my standard no-fail hit! I love it exactly as the recipe calls for it. Sometimes I simply add all the wet to the sifted dry ingredients and mix in my stand mixer. SO EASY! As for the ganache, I always half the recipe which is more than enough.

I have to laugh at the review from the cook in Erie PA - you thought you wouldn't like the taste and texture of vegetable oil, so you add..MARGARINE, which is an emulsion of water in oil?? Who bakes with margarine? How can you review a recipe if you don't even follow the directions?

Rating: 2
This cake is certainly sweet and dark-chocolately (I used Valrhona for the cake and a mix of Valrhona and Ghirardelli for the frosting), but I didn't like the texture - so moist that it turns to goo in your mouth and disintigrates beneath the knife, even after chilling. That said, I do think this cake is at the top of its own class, superior in taste to the bakery, restaurant, or mix cakes other reviewers compared it to, and of a finer texture. But I feel that cake ought to have more chewy substance, especially with a good, dense frosting like the one here.

Rating: 4
CANNOT believe the previous review! This cake was exceptional - tender, oh-so- moist, delicious even the next day. And although I made this cake with my own french vanilla buttercream frosting in place of the ganache (made for a choc-lover's birthday to serve others not so fond of choc) it was wonderful. My husb has already requested the ganache version for his b-day. Everyone remarked on this repeatedly -- more than just polite words. Even I wanted seconds, and usually I am sick of a dessert that I've spent time making & tasting as I go along!

I am one of those obsessive cooks who will bake five different recipes of the same baked good to come up with my one "ultimate" recipe. This cake beat out six others in our chocolate cake taste test. The buttermilk and the coffee (and I HATE the taste of coffee) are essential to the flavor, which is rich, dark, and chocolaty. I usually do not like chocolate cake--it doesn't taste like chocolate, it just tastes "brown." This one doesn't disappoint. You do need to use the correct pan size to get it to come out just right. Also, I wouldn't make this one for kids. This is definitely a grown-up chocolate cake.

Rating: 1
I agree with Singsgood from Erie, PA. This recipe is a glorified sheet cake. Higher quality cakes use cake flour or pastry flour for a finer crumb and a texture that cannot be surpassed. I have made this cake and expected better results from the positive reviews. I know this will come off as snobish but once you make a great recipe with cake flour and high quality melted chocolate and real butter not veg oil your standards will be higher. This is a decent chocolate cake not the best ever chocolate cake in the world.

Again, as everyone else has mentioned, this cake is absolutely delicious especially considering how simple it really is to make. Two notes: use the wax paper on the bottom of the pan, the cake is so dense and moist that it will stick, also, I used egg substitute in the recipe and it was still wonderful, rich, and moist. Easy and delicious, and gets better each day! Not overly sweet, just a nice balance of chocolate flavors.

Great cake! EXTREMELY chocolatey. Please, make this cake ONLY for those who love chocolate. It's very rich and moist. My husband said it's the best cake I've ever made. I also baked one for a party and people came up to me all evening to let me know how much they enjoyed the cake. I could hear people talking about it amongst one another all night. I made it with a white, light marshmellow type frosting (from a box! It was fat free) but it turned out to be the perfect match for what was such a dense and chocolately cake.I decorated it with fresh flowers so it looked stunning as well. I highly recommend. Follow the recipe to the tea if possible. On a side note: it's not an inexpensive cake to make if you buy the proper ingredients, but it's well worth it.

What can I say but WOW. Wow, because this actually worked. I can't believe I managed a cake from scratch. It was very good but EXTREMELY rich.

I made this cake for my son's1st birthday. I wanted his first taste of chocolate to be REALLY good. This didn't disappoint! He dug in with both hands, massaging it first, and then he couldn't get it into his mouth fast enough. Many cake and chocolate connoisseurs at the party also swore it was the best birthday cake they'd ever had, rich and velvety but not too sweet. (Used melted butter instead of oil. Iced with cream cheese frosting instead of ganache. Came out great in a 9x13 pan.)

I have made this cake two times and everyone loved it. My only issue with this cake is that it came out very crumbly. It was really difficult to slice a piece that would not fall apart. I have recently started to bake more and I am wondering what I did wrong?

I guess this just reminds me too much of a thicker, glorified version of a chocolate sheet cake. I knew the oil would bother me texture and taste wise so I substituted half margarine for the oil...yes, cake came out moist, dark and chocolatey, but was too much like a spongey box cake. I think I have been spoiled by the excellent chocolate butter cakes in books like the Cake Bible and The Simple Art of Perfect Baking - chocolate cakes that are rich and moist but have a finer, more velvety texture (and are also easier to cut), cakes that melt on your tongue like a bar of fine chocolate. So I think I would give this a miss next time. Dolled it up with creamy blender chocolate frosting (no sickly icing sugar in that) and some toasted almonds. Meh. I am a confirmed chocoholic so was expecting to love this one, shame.

As others have said.. why do I need to review a recipe which has been reviewed 889 times? Because it is that good. I used mediocre quality chocolate because I wanted to try the recipe (as well as iron out technique) before I sunk a lot of money into it. It stands up to mediocre ingredients. The cake part isn't all that much more difficult than opening a box and making a layer cake. The icing is very strong and delicious... and it might sound a little difficult, but it was very easy to make. If I had been more patient, it would have looked as beautiful as it tasted, but I didn't wait for the ganache to cool completely before pouring it on the cake! I 2/3 the recipe as previous reviewer mentioned and it fit perfectly into 2 9" pans and cooked in just under 45 minutes.

OK. Here's the deal. I am a 43 year old man who has never baked a cake from scratch in my life. In fact I never cook. As a lark, I got the recipe and decided to make the cake for my wife on her birthday as a surprise. Both she and another food fanatic told me it was the best chocolate cake they had ever eaten. I'm happy to take the praise, but credit where it is due: this is an amazing recipe. I didn't bother with the corn syrup FWIW. Also, not having access to really great chocolate, I used Ghiardelli (and Hershey's for the cocoa) which obviously was fine.

This is not only the best chocolate cake I've ever made, it is the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten! I followed other reviewers' sugestions and was careful not to overbake it, and made only half the granache.

Very, very good. Made this for my own birthday because I so wanted to try it. I used two 9x2" pans.... Using a one-cup measure, I scooped four very messy, dripping cups into each pan, and it was just the right amount for each, and maybe enough left to make a cupcake. However... my frosting turned out too hard. I'm sure it is because I used regular semisweet baking chocolate and not a good quality chocolate as suggested. Isn't it funny how we skimp when we make the cake for ourselves? I'll try this recipe again someday, and get the ScharffenBerger or Valrhona.

We didnt like this cake, BUT, I didnt have 2 round pans, so I just used a regular cake pan, so maybe that's why it was more brownie like...too moist. The frosting was YUMMY though, would definitely make that again!!!

If you're looking for super rich, indulgent, over-the-top good chocolate cake, this is it. I'm not sure if it was the way I made it or it was suppose to be as dense as it was, but it almost had a cheesecake quality to it. It is hard to describe. A used Dutched process but omitted the baking soda. I'm not sure if this created the super dense texture, but it was a great side effect. A few tips: I also used full-fat buttermilk. Considering the calories already in this cake, it didn't make sense to me to use non-fat. Also, check out your store's bulk section for Callebaut and Guittard semisweet chocolates. That's where I found it at my local grocery store. I put a full review on my blog: http://dozenflours.blogspot.com/2007/02/richards-double-chocolate-layer-cake.html

The perfect chocolate cake - rich, moist, decadent & delicious. It was a big hit, even with those who (like me) aren't crazy about chocolate cake. Used 2 pyrex tart pans as they were the only 10" pans I had and the layers were perfectly done in 1hr10.

Rating: 4
I put it in three 9-inch pans (fit wonderfully), but I had skipped out on the parchment since I don't like the crumbling that often happens to the bottom of my cakes that way. I ended up having to chuck one of the layers into a trifle it was so broken apart with the sticking. It almost tasted like a box cake it was so moist (maybe this is the box cake par?) It did pair nicely with the Brown Sugar Buttercream on this site, though it completely overpowered the subtle taste, so I definitely would try this again with the ganache and following the correct pan sizes. I guess I'll have to buy an extra 10" pan.

Rating: 4
This cake turned out excellent and the ganache is to die for. It is very easy to over cook this cake so start checking it around 50 min (even if the top doesn't appear done). I thought it was uncooked by looking at the top and ended up overcooking it. Also I would make it in a 10 X 13 oblong pan next time. The cake is super rich and we ended up with half the cake left since our guests could only eat a small slice. It tastes just like the chocolate cake at Macaroni Grill!

Rating: 3
This is an easy-to-make and versatile chocolate cake. I was hesitant about the absence of butter but I think the oil works better for texture (if not for flavor). The layers are easy to handle and may be complemented by any type of frosting, depending on the occasion (ganache for adults or a fluffy frosting or buttercream for a birthday cake). Although some reviews said ONLY use ganache and others said NEVER use ganache, it really depends on what you're going for. Let it rest for at least a day for the flavors to develop. I also made it as a bundt (baked at 1 hr) and cupcakes (for 15 minutes).

Ehhh, I wouldn't make this cake again. I was really excited about this recipe, but after constructing it over the weekend the end results were a bit disappointing. The cake itself was REALLY dry & unflavorful. It was a waste of good high quality chocolate. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but instead of using the ganache in the middle, I used the hazelnut cream from another recipe. The cream layer cam out wonderfully & has made a permanent home in my recipe box, but I don't think I'll make the cake again. For all the work required, I was disappointed in the end results, especially since this was for Valentine's Day for my sweetheart. Oh well, back to the chalkboard/recipes on what "sweets" to make for V-day!

I love this recipe--Very easy and everyone licked their plates. I think you could easily make it in an oblong pan but don't make it in a heart shaped bundt pan like I did. It almost didn't come out. I was too lazy to make the ganache according to the recipe--just stuck with the classic way--equal parts scalded cream and semi-sweet chocolate. Really good.

Hello everyone, what I meant to ask earlier was: Has anyone had any luck making this cake in a 9x13 in pan? When short on time this would work better me and also for taking it places, such as camping outings, etc. If anyone has done this, how long did it take to bake? Thanks!

Lovely lovely cake. I did a few substitutions though. Instead of ganache in the middle, I made a hazelnut filling with nutella and frangelico and some chopped hazelnuts and dark choclate and a few more things. Just to cut down on the chocolateness of it. Its lovely either way though. I also covered the sides with chopped toasted hazelnuts, because I like the contrast of the crunchy hazelnuts and moist dense cake. For people having problems with ganache, the curdling and gritttines, that's a result if overmixing. for the curdling, just strain and add a bit more cream. Be very gentle when adding cream. For the grittiness, try to strain it to see if that works. Thanks so much, this was great.

Comments ranged from "the best chocolate cake I've had in years" to "the best ever" and "even better than the dessert like this at Macaroni Grill." Forgive me if this serving suggestion appears in one of the ga-zillion reviews below...just didn't have time to read them all.

I've made a lot of chocolate cakes, and thought I had the perfect recipe, but this is my new standard. Moist, chocolaty, easy to make. I did have a problem with the ganache turning out grainy, think that was due to whisking after it cooled. Still tasted INCREDIBLE. I cut down the cake recipe, using only 2/3 of the ingredients, to fill 2 - 8"x2" pans since a 10" cake is too much for us. Didn't cut back on the frosting (more frosting is always good!) but next time, because it is SO rich, I will only make 1/2 of the frosting. Yum! This is a real winner.

The cake was delicious -- moist and dense -- but the frosting curdled!! I followed the directions exactly but ended up having to throw the frosting away and scrambled to find another frosting recipe. What a waste of a pound of high-quality (Swiss) chocolate. I am not sure what went wrong, but given all of the rave reviews I am going to try making it again... this time with a less expensive brand of chocolate!

Even though this has been favorably reviewed over 800 times, I wanted to add to the accolades. This is the most unbelievable cake EVER!!!

This recipe was an absolute dream to work with. The 10-inch pans really made it grand. The layers are pretty tender, so be careful of that when you're assembling. After a night in the fridge the cake was less delicate, but still delicious. I paired it with the hazelnut cream from the Hazelnut Dome Cake recipe to cut the extreme chocolate-y-ness, and thought it was wonderful. Highly recommended!!

Ok, now I can add cupcakes to the many ways I have made this cake (sheet, two and three layers). As usual, this is the best cake ever.

Plus, I had some left over and froze them and guess what? Even better defrosted!!

I was a professional baker for a number of years and I have to say, this is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever found! This cake is superb! The first time I made this I used 9" pans and baked the extra batter in a small loaf pan. I then made a point of going to a Williams Sonoma outlet store and bought two 10" pans just for this recipe. I'm glad I did as they produce a classic, large cake with a large top for decorating. I had a few slices left from the last cake so I put them on a tray covered with plastic wrap and put them in the freezer. When they were frozen I put each slice in a freezer bag. We had them for dessert about a month later and they were perfectly good. A truly amazing cake!

I have been making this cake for years for very special chocoholic birthdays. Definitely one to impress! I have successfully made 2/3rds of a recipe, which fits really well into 9 inch pans, so would recommend that for those who have had issues in that direction. You can also do a full recipe and do the rest of the batter as super-indulgent cupcakes! A cake leveler helps to make the cylindrical glass-smooth shape as in the photo, as well.

Fabulous cake, and got rave reviews from everyone I served it to. I served it with vanilla ice cream (of course) but next time I'll try it with some raspberry coulis as well. The only trouble I had with the recipe is that my cake layers sank in the center. I may have overfilled the cake pans, since I used 9" and wasn't quite sure how high to fill them.

Made this cake this weekend and it was delicious. Easy to make and very moist. I love the icing - not overly sweet. I made a raspberry coulis and whipped cream on the side which was a great compliment to it. I do need to find 10 inch cake pans though - I used 2 - 9inch pans and discarded the extra batter.

I made this for a friends birthday, she feels that if a dessert isn't chocolate, it's not dessert, so after reading many favorable reviews, I thought I would make it. As this is one of the most delicious cakes I have even tasted, I wasn't wild about the frosting choice. The ganache was just over kill, way to fudgy. I found myself eating around it, and just eating the super moist cake. The birthday girl loved it, so I guess for the die hard chocolate lover, it was a hit. She said it was the best cake she had ever had. If I made it again, I might try an orange cream cheese frosting, or just a much lighter whipped cream based one. Also, when serving it for adults, I might just soak the cakes in Grand Marnier, man would that be good!

June, the recipe calls for 10 in pans, I didn't have 10 in so I used 2 9 in and put extra batter in a loaf pan. You just have to fill your 9 in about 2 thirds full, and use the rest of the batter for cupcakes, etc. This cake is delicious, I haven't found a better cake and I've tried almost all of chocolate cakes here, Food tv and other websites. I hope you enjoyed it and that you eventually got the cake out of the pan. Besides the wax paper, I grease and flour my cake pans. It's worth the extra effort.

I haven't finished the cake yet, but had two problems so far. First, are cake pans standard? I thought they were, and substituted my 3 8-inch pans for the 2 9-inch pans the recipe recommended. The cake overflowed, and I realized my pans are obviously too shallow. So what are the measurements of "standard" cake pans? Second, I guess I let the cake cool in the pans too long, because it was quite the chore to get the cake out. Yes, I greased both the pans and then the wax paper at the bottom. I'll rate the recipe after I ice the cake and taste it, but so far, what a mess. Any advice is appreciated.

I made this for my son's birthday. I used dark chocolate because that's what I had. The cake was so moist and delicious. I never made icing like this before. I chilled the icing for a little bit first. The cake looked just like the picture. This was so easy to do, I will definitely make it again. Beware: it is very rich and more than a thin slice is too much. I served it with mint chocolate chip icecream. It served our family of eight for two days.

Without fail this is one of the best chocolate cake recipies I have used. Again and again it is requested by my co-workers, family and friends - I've even had people offer to pay for these cakes for their holiday parties and special events! because there is sooo much batter (way more than two 9 inch rounds can hold) I will bake the extra batter in 6 inch round pans and freeze them for dinner parties or just when I get that chocolate craving. In fact I think they tend to taste even better after being frozen and defrosted - very moist. Also I reccomend trying a flavored coffee and complementing with a jam in the center - raspberry has been very popular lately.

Omitted the coffee and used slightly less sugar but otherwise followed recipe exactly and used Scharffenberger chocolate and cocoa. Made for my son's 5th birthday and cake was loved by both adults and kids. This one is a keeper and will replace my previous chocolate cake recipe for birthdays. Didn't realize the ganache would dry fast when I was frosting the cake, so if you want to add sprinkles or other decorations, make sure ganache is wet enough for them to stick - otherwise they will just roll off. This is a great chocolate cake!

This is the second time I have made this cake and I've already broken my New Year's resolutions by scarfing leftovers! Two tips: make sure the coffee isn't super strong and use the full amount of sugar if you are using bittersweet chocolate. The first time I made this, I used superstrong french press coffee and cut the sugar. The batter was not very sweet, but thanks to other reviewers I made the chocolate caramel icing from somewhere else on the site and it was fine. This time, I made sure to use normal strength coffee plus didn't cut the sugar. I filled the cake with some vanilla buttercream (butter, conf. sugar, vanilla and whipping cream) then frosted it with a chocolate glaze and it was SUPERB. Many miles of bike-riding are now needed....

i have been looking for the perfect chocolate cake base and i have found it! whoever made this cake and did not find it the most moist cake they have ever had... they did something wrong:). it is soooooo soft and moist. it's the perfect density... not too dense and not too light. i have made the triple choco celebration cake from this site a billion times and the components of the recipe are AMAZING. the cake base is like a fudge brownie and is absolutely delicious, but i have been looking for a lighter base that compliments the ganache, mousse and raspberry perserves. my search has ended. this recipe is it!!... and all of my new years guests(who have also eaten all my other cake-base variations of the triple choco celebration cake) agreed, too. things i did different: i used yogurt, because i did not have buttermilk on hand. i also used instant coffee instead of brewed. it took my cakes 1hr 15min to bake. i sliced the bases in half and filled bottom layer w/ rasp perserves, ganache and choco mousse... middle layer with rasp and ganache... and then rasp, ganache, mousse for the final layer. VERY decadent. regardless of what you pair with this cake base, it will compliment anything. obviously... i LOVED this cake:).

This is wonderful. A straight-forward chocolate cake that can easily be made from on-hand ingredients. Beautiful, too! I didn't have two 10" x 2" cake pans, so I used two 9" x 2-3/4" pans with excellent results.

Eaten the same day the cake was made=two forks. Eaten on the second or third day=four forks. The proverb "Patience is a virtue" applies to this recipe. The crumb is not as fine as I would like however the moistness of the cake is worth it. You gotta love a DESSERT recipe that gets better with age.

Wow this is the best chocolate cake I have ever made and have shared the recipe with friends. We have used it as two single layers with the frosting topped with fresh rasberries and sprigs of mint. Also with thin tall rectangles of chocolate standing around the sides tied with raffia and a sunflower on the top. This is the only recipe I'll be using for chocolate cake.

Made this as my b-day cake because I had to have chocolate. This is one unbelievable cake! I tasted a cupcake made with extra batter the same day I baked it and was not impressed-- almost kicked myself for not just buying a cake mix! What I didn't know was that this cake, once frosted and chilled for 2 days(made this ahead for my party) blossoms into a rich, moist, decadent, chocolate masterpiece of a cake just like other reviewers said! I used pretty "low" quality chocolate and this still came out AMAZING! I'm almost afraid to make this with really good chocolate. Can't imagine this cake tasting any better. OMG is right!

OMG! OMG!! OMG!!! A chocoholics dream. PLEASE ignore all those negative reviews. Perhaps the negative reviewers do not like the intense chocolatey flavor or their oven temperatures etc. are not as perfect as they think and lead them to think that the recipe failed them. Their loss. Go on and try it - irrespective of the type of chocolate or cocoa, this cake IS WONDERFUL!

What can I say about a recipe that has been reviewed over 850 times?? Except - those reviewers that said it was crumbly - you overbaked it. This cake was so moist the crumbs stuck to my fingers as I handled it. The taste was soooo rich, so chocolatey, so moist, so flavorful I have finally found the chocolate cake recipe I've been looking for for years!! (and being a chef, I've looked a long time for that just perfect cake) The only changes I made was that I doubled the amount of chocolate in the recipe, and I brushed each layer of the cake with a little Kahlua when I was frosting it to give it that extra kick. I glazed it, then piped a beautiful border, some rosettes,and topped each rosette with a gold-dusted espresso bean. Beautiful and delicious.

I have reviewed this before - but in the past 3 years this cake has become a tradition in our family. My husband's birthday is near Christmas, so each year we have a combination Christmas and birthday party. I make this cake for the birthday cake and it has become famous. People ask if we'll be having THAT cake again. This year we got married and we had the cake for our wedding cake. In three square tiers and decorated with hot pink gerbera daisies. Beautiful and delish. The only cake that comes close is one called the Black Beast - or Bete Noir - also on epicurious.

I have made this cake several times because of the texture and flavor, it is great...but always sinks in the middle, I have tried adjusting the oven temperature but it does not work, still I keep on doind it because of the flavor! I tried making cupcakes and the overflow and then went flat! total disaster. The batter seems to me a little runny, I dont know if that is how its supposed to be...maybe someone can tell me why this wonderful cake does not bake like it should!

Like many other reviewers, I have made this cake recipe several times - whenever I want a surefire hit that serves a ton of people. I usually use extra virgin olive oil - you can't tell and it turns out perfectly. Espresso isn't necessary - good old brewed coffee works great. For the ganache, I switch to a traditional ganache recipe with 1 1/2 cups heavy cream (brought just to a boil and taken off the heat) and stir in 12 oz good quality semisweet chips - it makes more than enough to coat the cake and it's much easier.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable taste and presentation! I followed recommendations below to use butter, espresso, and less sugar, perfect! Then I cut the two cakes in half, in those layers I put whipped cream and ample frozen raspberries. Also put raspberries in middle layer with ganache. The berries added texture and enhanced the flavor, an absolute must if you like raspberries.

After 831 reviews of this recipe my comments seem somewhat superfluous but I have to rave about this cake! I put off trying this recipe for months because it seemed like a lot of work and expense. I have never been a huge cake fan because at the ripe old age of 47 I can honestly say I have never had a really good cake either from box or scratch, bakery or restaurant. Until yesterday. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use "fine quality" chocolate. I used the cheap old Ghiradelli stuff from the grocrery store and instead of 2 round 10 inch layers I made 18 cupcakes and a generous 8 inch round layer. The ganche frosting was quick and set up beautifully so it was easy to ice the cake. I cannot get over the flavor and texture of this cake. Is it the buttermilk? The coffee and the melted chocolate? I took it to a friends house for dessert last night and people could not stop eating it! I am convinced. This is the best cake ever.

Great recipe! I made it tonight for the second time in 8" layers - since the layers were thick and the cake so sinfully rich, I actually decided to freeze one layer for another occasion, and just frosted one layer with ganache. Mmmm...

This cake emits an actual aura of chocolate, and says to you, "I'm a cake that ***ing means BUSINESS!" I baked it for a friend on his birthday and it was a huge hit. However, i can imagine the cake being a bit too hardcore for people who aren't too crazy about chocolate... Luckily I AM crazy about chocolate. Afore-mentioned friends and I only managed to eat half of it, so the birthday boy took the rest home and the next day i got a call from his mom raving about this mysteriously delicious cake that appeared in her fridge, so i gave her the link to the recipe. Good times, good cake!

This cake is a chocoholics dream. I have made this cake about seven times and each time I bake it, it gets better and better. I have had request to bake it for others as well. The secret is not to overbake or let it sit too long before icing it. It must be served at room temperature.

Rating: 3
Great cake - unsure of the frosting at first. I had made the cakes the day before & wrapped them up to put in the fridge. Next day made the frosting, frosted the cakes and let sit out for about 5 hours before serving. Frosting was hard and difficult to cut & serve - tasted okay. The next day had a piece (had sat on table wrapped up all night) and was MUCH better. The icing was smooth - not hard. Will make again - but definitely serve at room temp.

I made this for my father's birthday. I followed the exact recipe for the cake but my dad requested a chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was absolutely outstanding, but it was not complemented well by the buttercream. A ganache would have been much, much better. You must make this cake but PLEASE resist the temptation to use anything but the ganache for the icing.

Rating: 4
While the cake is time consuming (I finished at 2 am and started at 9 pm) the final product merited the lost study time. Next time I will be careful to check the cakes a little earlier as they were a teensy tiny bit on the dryish side. It was everything I have been craving: dark, rich, dense chocolatey cake. I chilled the frosting slightly while the cake cooled and it spread like a dream. I recommend making a raspberry filling or using jam to spread between the layers in addition to the frosting.

Amazing results with this cake- made for a party and everyone assumed that I was running a side bakery business. Cake is very rich so many people wanted a small piece and the easiest thing to do was cut like a wedding cake. Ended up serving 25 people with this cake

A four fork rating and positive commentary from Epicurious raters guided my decision to test this recipe. It was a hit at a loved one's birthday party, served in thinner slices with scoops of hand-whipped cream and whole raspberries. I suggest that the cake be cooled just a bit above room temperature to prevent cake slices from breaking apart upon serving. I will make this fabulous cake again and again!

DELICIOUS! Made this for my husband's birthday and he was very impressed. I followed the recipe to a T and didn't change a thing and it was fantastic.

oh my goodness...i have been baking chocolate cakes my entire life and this is the best i ever had...extremely moist, rich, flavorful, decadent...this is the finest of the finest! instead of 3 eggs, used 2 and 3/4 stick melted butter (moist); espresso instead of coffee (rich); 4 oz chocolate instead of 3 (flavorful), 2.5 cups sugar instead of 3 (not too sweet). used 3 9-inch pans and baked 50 mins. did not tamper with frosting. heavenly perfection!

Holy.... this thing should be illegal it is SO delicious! Got rave reviews when I made it for my chocoholic 4-year-old daughter's birthday -- people who stopped by the house in the days afterwards immediately went to the fridge seeking leftovers. It was easy to make. I used 3 8-inch cake pans cuz that's all I had -- turned out GREAT, I put all 3 pans in the oven and it took I think 45 minutes, maybe 60 (after 30 mins I checked it every 15 or so, tried not to open the oven tho). I didn't have time to buy "fine" chocolate - I actually just used the fanciest chocolate chips available at my grocery store and it was wonderful, I can't even imagine how wonderful it would have been with even higher quality chocolate.

I am not a huge chocolate fan but had two birthdays recently where I made the cake. Both times I used 2 9 inch pans and I baked for about 60 minutes and it was perfectly fine. (maybe even a few minutes shorter would have been good). First time I made a vanilla buttercream (from this site) and it was nice. Second time I made the ganache and holy smokes alive was it not only gorgeous but delicious, and as many other people mentioned, professional looking. I put thinly sliced strawberries in the layer. And I had no problem with spreading the ganache after leaving it on the counter for about 45 minutes and then doing the icing. The birthday brunch attendees were dreaming of chocolate cake for a full week afters. I also don't think this is that complicated at all.

Went for hedonism and combined this cake recipe with the Chocolate Cake with Caramel-Milk Chocolate Frosting frosting recipe also available at Epicurious (thanks to earlier reviews under both recipes for this tip). This cake was for a true chocolate cake lover, so the indulgence paid off -- it was a smashing success! The buttermilk is a key ingredient, perhaps making up for the use of vegetable oil rather than butter (a reviewer below rightly observes the importance of butter, normally, in a good cake). Note: my three forks denote what I consider to be a truly delicious recipe, well worth using when entertaining. Four forks are given very rarely to complex, innovative dishes.

I bake cakes all the time and was excited to try this one since it received such great reviews. I followed the directions precisely and did not skip one step. The cake is okay. It's definitely moist and has a nice texture, but it's lacking in the flavor department. It doesn't have the subtle nuances of butter and brown sugar -- two ingredients I've found in my favorite chocolate cakes. There are some cake recipes (such as the caramel-milk chocolate cake here on Epicurious) that have better flavor and aren't quite as sweet. This one was almost too sweet for me. I didn't bother to make the frosting for this one. I'm sure it's good, but I will probably end up throwing this one out or using it as a practice cake for decorating. I'm really disappointed the cake didn't turn out and pretty shocked at all the great reviews.

Rating: 4
I have reviewed this cake before--I LOVE it, but I wanted to add another review because this time I did two things differently that might be useful for others: because of time constraints, I had to make the cake layers three days ahead, so I wrapped them tightly and froze them. Not only did they taste fine, but because they were cold when I frosted them, the frosting thickened as I put it on--which was great because there have been times that the frosting has been quite drippy. (It always turns out okay, but there are some nervous moments!) I think I'll plan on freezing them from now on. Second, because it was a special day, I spent a small fortune on Sharfenberger (sp?) chocolate. Not necessary. Many of my family have had this cake before and they (and I) both thought there was not a difference between the solid gold version and the ones I've made previously with Ghiradelli. btw, I always put raspberries between the layers and I've found that frozen work better than fresh. yumyum! enjoy!!

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it was amazing. I made it in 3 9" inch cake pans and baked for 45 minutes. The cake was very moist and chocolatey. I didn't have a pound of chocolate for the frosting so I made the Bittersweet Chocolate Frosting (also from this site) and it was excellent. This is the type of cake that I will still be making in 20 years for a birthday or some other special occasion!

The best chocolate cake I've ever made. Baking time is about 40 minutes (way shorter than the recipe says), and then it comes out very light and moist. Only complaint is that the cake is rather crumbly, which makes serving difficult. Don't know what can be done about that. I can't wait to try variations on this - maybe the ones suggested by the reviewer below.

Rating: 3
Really top notch chocolate cake. Some mods made it more worth the effort: I added cinnamon to the mix, which went very well with the coffee. Also, I modified the icing a bit; I used a 3 oz bar of Lindt (80% cocoa), a pint of cream, quarter tsp of salt (for richer, rounder taste), a half tsp cayenne, and deleted the granulated sugar. The icing is really a ganache with corn syrup to make it thick and sweet. I wanted a more "adult" cake with more complex but less sweet icing. Also, I've made this cake with Irish Cream-type liqueur subbing for the coffee, with the above ganache as an icing, which imparts a very rich and deep flavor. Covered with toasted coconut shavings makes it over the top, and my husband's long time favorite birthday cake.

Rating: 3
Yummy, but I've had a few issues. First of all, the baking time for this cake, is WAY over-estimated - I took my cake out at 53 minutes, and I think it was over-done. Number two, cake turned out very crumbly (maybe from over-baking?), and frosting turned out very dense (maybe from over-chilling?) and this made frosting it rather difficult, although the end result was still attractive. Also, serving it was difficult - they're not kidding when they say to leave it out of the fridge before serving. But I'm gonna give this cake another shot, and maybe it'll be 4 stars next time with a shorter baking time. Note - nobody has 2 10" pans.... I used 9" pans, and cut the recipe by a quarter; that was just the right amount of batter.

I made this for the third time over the weekend for my husband's birthday barbecue. Everyone from the extreme foodies to the cake mix crowd loved it. This last time, though, instead of using the ganache (which is fabulous) I used the classic meringue buttercream recipe on this site. It was a spectacular combination--a beautiful black/white visual and a wondeful mix of textures and flavors. I used 2 9" pans and it turned out fine.

Rating: 3
Who owns 2 10-in pans? tried this w/ 2 9-in pans and it was a total disaster. In retrospect, I probably overfilled. After this failure I took one reviewer's suggestion and halved the recipe to make cupcakes, which turned out perfectly. Cooking time is about 30 min. I used mocha chips from the Baker's Catalogue for the frosting.

Rating: 4
W.O.W. - the best chocolate layer cake yet. I followed the cake recipe exactly and used three 9" layer pans, baked at 300 for 50 minutes. Each layer rose evenly and was moist yet firm. I wrapped them and iced the next day. Icing recipe was increased by half since there was an extra layer to cover - the needed to be chilled for a couple of hours before it was thick enough to frost. This cake pretty and as as good any chocolate cake at a fine restaurant. I served with coffee ice cream - together making a winning combination.

An excellent cake-moist but light-- but do not skimp on the chocolate. The better and richer tasting the chocolate, the better the cake. I actualy prefer it with a bittersweet rather than a semisweet. Very forgiving also for an ambitious child baker! Just don't overbeat!

Outstanding! This is an excellent cake - very dense and moist. I used lowfat buttermilk, Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, 60% cocoa "bittersweet" Ghirardelli baking chocolate in lieu of the semisweet chocoate and reduced the sugar from 3 cups to 2 1/2. Watch the baking time carefully. My layers were baked in just about 50 minutes - and I usually don't have to shorten baking times that much. I frosted with the chocolate buttercream frosting that can be found on this site under "devils food cake with chocolate-orange buttercream", Bon Appetit March 2004.

Made this for the 2nd time. Baked in three 9" pans for 50 minutes b/c that's when the toothpick came up clean. Used bittersweet choc. Spread a thin layer of TJ's raspberry preserves between each layer. Cut the gananche recipe in half and poured it over top of cake. Very glossy. Best tasting choc cake and presentation is beautiful.

This is truly a special cake. For the frosting I used the caramel milk chocolate frosting recipe on this site which is simply the best. Anyhow, my review is for the cake layers. I used 3 9-inch pans and baked about 35-40 minutes. They were perfect except that the cake layers were so tender and moist, they fell apart a bit for me. Next time I will try freezing them before frosting. But the cake was simply delicious and so worth making again.

I usually don't eat chocolate cakes but this one is the best I have ever tasted! The only thing different that I did was slice up very thin strawberries and put them inbetween the layer. I dipped strawberries in chocolate and put those on top. I refridgerated the cake over night with the strawberries and when I opened it up, oh my, the smell was so good from the strawberries. Also there was strawberry juice everywhere and sooooo GOOD! This cake takes awhile to make but sooo WORTH IT!! ENJOY!!

I am not a pro but this cake certainly makes me feel like one. It is my cake of choice whenever I need to make a chocolate cake. I've filled it with everything from raspberry jam, fresh strawberries, espresso with marscapone, and even caramel pecans and coconut for a killer german chocolate cake. I've even suceeded in making this cake at altitude. It cannot be beat and holds up well to a variety of fillings and frostings. I prefer buttercreams with this cake but just about anything works and it transports beautifully. Tip for slicing....use a very sharp - not serrated knife. Dip the knife in very hot water and then wipe the knife dry and slice. It is best to do this between each cut or at most two but you'll get a perfect slice - as thin or thick as you want. It sounds like a lot of work...but when presentation counts - this gets the job done.

WOW - yummy! I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I used a good quality bittersweet dark chocolate for the cake. Used 9" pans and then cut each layer into two and put rasberry jam inbetween these layers. I then used a dark fudge ready-made frosting for the middle layer which gave it a little lighter taste (if you can believe that). I used 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semisweet dark chocolate for the ganache and decorated the top of the cake with fresh rasberries. This cake was incredible. Everyone was full before the cake was served, but there was hardly a crumb left on anyone's plate. Definitely a keeper!!!

This was AMAZING. Moist, rich and wildly addictive. I made it for my partner's birthday (he loves chocolate) and his health-nut family. I expected leftovers, but the cake was demolished! I too ended up eating more than I intended. Substituted some of the semisweet chocolate with unsweetened and halved the sugar. Used Dutch process cocoa. Instead of buttermilk, substituted 1/2c. natural yoghurt, 1c. skim milk mixed with 1tbs lemon juice. Used 9" pans. Filled with batter about halfway and used the leftovers for cupcakes. I found it tricky to frost the cake (it's very hot and humid here and the frosting got runny quickly), but any mistakes are very delicious! This is a truly superlative cake!

i made this cake for my boyfriends birthday and it was a great presentation beautifully large and impressive. the frosting was excellent for chocolate lovers. i believe it was a tad crumbly because i served it almost straight out of the fridge. it became more moist as it sat out on the counter and after two days. so the room temperature is a must. i am going to make again. does anyone know if the undutched cocao is a must? does it affect the baking process?

This cake is great! After reading other comments about the sweetness of the cake, I used dark and unsweetened choc.(one time all unsweetened, other times 85-88%) in the cake instead of what is called for. The flavor was great- intense choc. with great texture, and not too sweet. Coffee cream cheese icing on top is great too; this cake is SO good, and impresses every time.

Nice moist rich cake. The icing was good as well, but I can see how it could be too much for others. I'm looking forward to trying this cake with other icings, mostly so I don't have to spend so much money on bittersweet chocolate. I was worried the coffe flavor would come through, but it didn't. This is now my "go to" for chocolate cake.

My boys (5,7,and 9 tomorrow), love this cake. It is baking right now for my son's birthday. Don't sell kids short. Their tastes come from the experiences the adults in their lives provide them with.

I am very picky about chocolate cakes. Most of them don't taste like chocolate--they just taste brown, if you know what I mean. When I can't find a recipe I like, I tend to pick 5 promising ones, bake them all at the same time, and have a tasting party. This cake is heavenly, and won the taste test hands down. I've served it several times, and it's been a hit each time. I even bought the 10" pans necessary to make it, because the first time I made it in smaller pans and it just didn't come out right. I don't have any comments on the frosting, which I didn't use. My husband doesn't like ganache type frostings that harden after time, so I use a food processor recipe from the Joy of Cooking that stays soft and glossy for days. I can't remember the name of the recipe off the top of my head--but if you have the cookbook, you should be able to find it. The authors say that it's a particularly good frosting for children. Rave review aside, this is not a good cake for kids. The buttermilk and coffee give it a definite dark-chocolate adult cake taste.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday, and received rave reviews. The only thing we did differently, was to beat the icing, a lot. It whipped up a bit, tasted delicious, and looked fantastic.

Rating: 4
Made according to directions (Callebaut et al), though cut down cooking time as suggested to 50 minutes and used 9" pans (xtra batter became cupcakes). It was my father's 70th birthday and he's a huge chocolate cake fan. It was a big success. Rich, dense, moist- can understand why some may think it's too much, but it is wonderfully decadent. Highly recommend.

I just made the cake part, as it was a birthday cake and wanted vanilla buttercream frosting. I did not alter it at all, as I was apprehensive about making a cake from scratch for the first time. Everyone thought was very rich and moist, although I felt it was much better after being refrigerated for a while. I would make again and try the chocolate ganache

I have made this several times. This is an AWESOME chocolate cake--like the best Devil Dog you never had. Moist, chocolately, delicious. Hints: use three 8" pans, for a 3 layer cake. Unless you absolutely love chocolate chocolate, think about using whipped cream in between layers or vanilla icing. This cake and icing are VERY rich and very chocolate-ley. But, this is a great recipe, that I would recommend for anyone who loves chocolate.

Rating: 4
this was absolutely, hands down, the best chocolate cake i've ever made! it was incerdibly easy, didn't stick to the pans, and super moist (not to mention decadent). i didn't have 10" so i used two 9" pans. the layers were really thick so it took the whole 1 hour 10 minutes to bake.

Love, love, love this recipe. It's extremely rich and chocolatey. I wanted to bring the leftovers to my office, but my husband wouldn't let me - wanted them all to himself. We'll definitely make this one again.

I have made this cake too many times to count! I have some serious chocolate lovers in my family and this cake is perfect. My husband loves chocolate but not in such a rich dose, as this whole recipe is. I make the cake in 2 9" pans for about 50 minutes. I use parchment circles to line the pans that I've greased and floured. I have never had a problem with them sticking. I ususally make a mousse filling (from this site) and frost with buttercream to cut the richness. This cake is divine - moist and chocolatey. I would do the ganache if you plan on serving this cake to many people, as a small sliver would be perfectly sufficient OR if you are a die hard chocolate addict. Either way, this cake deserves at least 5 forks.

Rating: 4
Made the cake twice as listed. Next time, will try the seedless raspberry between layers as suggested. The chocolate frosting is a bit too much for me. Will read the reviews to find some way to lighten.

Rating: 4
MmmmMMmm. A perfect moist, fudgy, super chocolaty, old fashioned style cake. I chose to serve it frosted with a caramel ganache and it was divine. I have made this twice, the second time I cut out 1/2 cup of the cocoa powder and replaced it with 3T flour producing a less intense chocolate cake that is better suited for a chocolate fudge frosting...The original recipe is soo (deliciously) chocolaty that I almost prefer it with buttercream.Enjoy! PS: I have used both dutch processed (a more intense chocolate flavor) and natural cocoa powders and both work just fine.

Have made this a few times. A winner when your guests are absolute chocoholics!

To the cook from Syracuse NY, try putting the cake into the freezer until somewhat firm before slicing it. Also, try using a non-serrated knife, as serrated tends to rip through the cake rather than slicing it.

Friends raved over this recipe. I enjoyed it, however if I were to make it again for myself I would use perhaps half milk chocolate. I found the chocolate taste to be very bitter-sweet.

Rating: 4
This is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it as a bundt cake with a bittersweet chocolate glaze (which was easier than frosting/ganache). It tasted heavenly and kept well for several days.

Rating: 3
A winner! I baked three 9" layers (40-45 minutes in the oven) and spread raspberry preserves inbetween the layers along with the ganache. The final product looked near-professional and tasted rich and wonderful, but I ran into major problems with crumbling when I cut and served the cake with a serrated knife. The cake refused to stay intact. Any suggestions?

Rating: 0
Wow. This cake is outstanding - I would give it 5 forks if I could. It's incredibly moist, just the right texture and flavor -- perfect. I made it in two 8" pans and used the extra batter for cupcakes. Then I split the layers for a nice tall cake. Watch out if you decide to use this method, however, because this cake is so moist that it's more difficult to split than other cakes. I didn't give a rating since I only made the cake portion of this recipe -- I used the simpler ganache recipe found here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/105133 for the outside of the cake, and filled the layers with chocolate mousse from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104512. It was to die for. To the cooks who claim there are "better recipes out there" -- if there are, please post a link!

I've made this now three times. The first as cupcakes (see previous review) the second as a bundt cake - no frosting, just fresh whipped cream - and the third time i cut the recipe in half and made two six inch rounds. IMO, the ganache frosting for this is far too rich. The best alternative i've found so far is whipped cream and fresh berries. Definately a cake worth making from scratch.

I just made this cake for the top layer of a wedding cake and for the groom's cake (in the shape of a glass of Guinness). The cake itself is great, although, I felt that it hit you almost too hard with the chocolatey flavour. I mean, I know that's what the cake is about, but it lacked a certain smoothness. Anyhow, it was still really great, and I loved the moist texture. I filled it with homemade raspberry preserves and used the ganache recipe. However, I needed extra frosting, so I made the ganache exactly as stated, and after chilling it and allowing it to ocme back to room temp, added 6 T. butter which had been whipped with 1 1/3 c. powdered sugar. This made it like a heavy buttercream and perfectly spreadable. To get a smooth-as-silk finish, I used a hot, wet knife on the outside of the groom's cake. I would highly reccommend this cake, both for the taste and the ease of making and working with it.

I originally reviewed the cake in this recipe on 2/19/04 and this time made the cake with the ganache over the weekend. I again used 3 9" cake pans and baked ~45-50 minutes (keep checking for doneness with toothpick). The ganache was a tad tricky to me. I applied it in phases (between shoveling snow!). I refrigerated it for an hour as it was a bit thin initially and had to soften it on the defrost setting in the microwave for the final application. It was my husband's birthday cake and he thought it was quite good. (Personally, I still prefer a buttercream frosting.)

Rating: 4
made this as cupcakes - unbelieveable chocolate flavor. i used valhrona cocoa powder, which, imo, is the best. I thought the ganache icing was too rich, so i made the following changes: doubled the butter, used half and half instead of cream and used half milk/half semi-sweet chocolate. i cooled the ganache in the fridge, then whipped it until it was pale. the result was a rich, yet light "frosting" that melts in your mouth. (keep refrigerated). i also topped half of the cupcakes with the peanutbutter frosting from the brownie cupcake recipe also on this site - again, whipped the frosting to lighten it. utterly delicious.

The best chocolate layer cake ever-a true chocolate orgasmic experience. Substituted 70% bittersweet chocolate in the batter, but used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate in the icing. Made it for my husband's office staff and they were deliriously happy.

This is a decadent chocolate cake. A show stopper. It is dense, moist, and flavorful. I shortened baking time and also used 9 inch springform pans. Mmm.

Made this cake for a birthday party and all I can say is, "WOW!!". The cake was extremely moist and very rich. Baked the cake in three 9" cake pans using Valrhona cocoa powder and Lindt 85% cocoa bittersweet chocolate (which cut down on sweetness) and used Callebaut 65% cocoa semisweet chocolate in the ganache. The cakes came out perfect after baking for 40 minutes and brushed each layer generously with Kaluhua before assembling and added 1 1/2 tbsp. Kaluhua to the ganache. I also used a strong Italian blend coffee which added to the depth of flavour of the chocolate. Served it with homemade raspberry coulis and fresh whipped cream on the side. Can't wait to make it again!

People who attended my party remember this cake more than anything else - and it was a FUN party! I agree with the previous cook who said to reduce the baking time - no more than an hour - otherwise the cake turns out a little dry. I know this because the first time I baked it I followed the directions to the letter(and it was still good.) It's a wonderful cake with an elegant presentation! Do give it a try.

Definitely use high quality chocolate & full fat buttermilk! Made a black forest trifle and came out amazing. Had plenty of cake left over and even chilled, it remained moist & flavorful, perfect with whip cream and coffee.

Amazing! A big hit at my dinner party. Just make sure to use high quality chocolate.

I followed the recipe but did decrease the bake time to 48 min. when the cake tester came out clean from both cakes. I did use 10 in. pans and greased the pan as well as the parchment paper. After cooling, I ran a knife around the edges and shook the cakes loose before dumping them onto the cake plate. They came out perfect. Had to chill the ganache to a spreadable consistency; made and used the whole amount for the two 10 in. cakes. Was delicious!

I am a chocolate lover, so that said, this cake is a dream. I am currently living overseas where it is not possible to easily find high-quality baking chocolate. I was forced to used plain old Nestle's chips that I had brought with me in this recipe instead. Despite this substitution, the cake turned our perfectly - moist, rich, and well worth the effort. Not one single piece was left at the the birthday party I took this cake to - where there were two other cakes to choose from!

This cake is way to heavy and dense for me. I did not think it was very moist either. I don't get it.

This recipe is fantastic. It is a richly flavoured cake which is a delight to eat. Guests rave about it and always ask for the recipe. I have also converted it into a three layer cake. Sometimes, when I am at work,I get flashbacks to the last time I made the cake and how delicious it was. That has never happened with any other chocolate cake I have made. Just divine!

Rating: 4
Very special! Substituted sour cream for the buttermilk and it was wonderful! You do need 3 pans if they are smaller than 10 inches. When assembling the cake I put frosting on one layer and spread a thin layer of seedless raspberry preserves on the other side so that when I put the layers together there was chocolate frosting and the raspberry preserves between each layer - everyone loved this cake!

This is IT! After searching for a yummy chocolate cake for a while, I believe I have found it. Moist, Luxurious, Decadent...Yummy! This cake is excellent. I made my own icing with marscapone, heavy cream, vanilla and a touch of sugar. Oh yeah, and I dusted it with white chocolate shavings to cover up any imperfections. It was a thing of beauty. One note: your cake pans may overflow while baking if you don't have 10" pans. (I know, I used 8" pans, but they were still fabulous. I caught the overflow on a baking sheet and ate it while still molten, yum!)

This cake is whack! I've made it several times, each time tinkering just slightly...different types of chocolate (Scharffen Berger gets my vote) different intensities of coffee (instant espresso is my choice) different pans, etc. It's an amazing gift for someone you love. I respect, but can't understand the negative comments here..this cake is so foolproof, so delicious, so...completely decadent and rich and sinful, I just can't imagine someone not sitting on the kitchen floor at 2am, eating this cake with full and utter abandon....Ayyyyy!

I have made this recipe twice and I think it is outstanding. I doubled it and put in a 17x11 inch sheet pan. Had to bake longer of course, but it worked and people absolutely raved. I have served it with the ganache frosting and also a boiled 7 minute type vanilla frosting, both of which are fabulous. Preference would determine the better frosting of the two. A simple buttercream worked well on it, too. Love this cake!!!

Move over, Prozac - I think this cake is the ULTIMATE anti-depressant! I made the cake exactly as written, using Trader Joe's "Pound Plus" 70% dark chocolate bars (minus the "plus") for both the cake and frosting. I lined the 10" pans with waxed paper sprayed with Pam, but the cakes still did not come out of the pans easily and some patchwork had to be done on one broken layer - any suggestions??? Still, the cake was very moist and dense, and the frosting was like pure heaven. (By the way, I had no trouble at all with either the frosting's consistency or applying it to the cake.) As I made this as a birthday cake, I put some leftover frosting in a pastry bag and did some extra decorating on the top of the cake - looked very professional! All in all, this recipe is not too difficult or labor intensive and gives great results!

To find the right choice of word to describe - The cake is delectable wicked! It is moist, heavy laden with chocolate and literally melt in the mouth. To create a liqourice after taste, I blended in with 2 tbsp of Kirsch! It's a hit!

The cake looks beautiful, and is fairly easy to make... but it's -- dare I say it, with all that luscious chocolate inside? -- kind of boring. Used good chocolate and still kind of tasted like store mix/store bought.

This was a beautiful and delicious birthday cake for a 50-something chocolate lover and her chocolate loving friends. I used the only pans I had, 3 - 9" cake pans and it worked quite well. Next time I will follow the advice of one of the previous reviewers, to freeze the layers before frosting - I believe that step would make frosting the cake much easier. This is definitely a keeper!

This cake was very easy to make and did bake up even. The texture is a heavier cake and really does improve the day after, left at room tempurature. I made it for a chocolate lovers 80th celebration & tied a fondant bow around it. A truly magnificant centerpiece!

Half a fork --- Followed this recipe and used high quality chocolate. Baked up beautifully, but flavor was off tasting stale. I ended up making a second cake for the birthday party I was throwing.

I made this cake for a birthday dinner and it turned out very well. Because I could only find super expensive cocoa powder, I did skimp a bit on the other chocolate, using semi-sweet Guittard chips sold in bulk at a local store. In a (sort of) unrelated incident, my sifter broke so I could not follow the sifting instructions. I was worried but in the future I would skip the sifting step. I also can't say I was 100% accurate with all the measurements (I don't have a scale so the 3 oz. of chocolate thing was guestimated). Even still, it was great to have a cake recipe that is a bit forgiving. It is also *huge*. I made for dinner for 8 and half was left over. Before frosting, I put the frosting in the fridge w/out even testing the consistency per the other reviewers and it was the perfect consistency. The only thing I would recommend is, when plating, set it atop some wax paper as the cake is so moist, it stuck to the plate I had set it on while doing other prep.

Rating: 4
I made the cake in two 9" springform pans and it spilled out while baking. It would have been no problem if I'd had a baking sheet under to catch it, but it tasted great anyway. It rose evenly in the pans, instead of rising into a mound in the centre, which was unexpected, but perfect for a layer cake. I frosted it with a hazelnut buttercream frosting, and made a hazelnut spread to put between the layers. This is the richest, most delicious chocolate cake I've had.

Rating: 4
Add my kudos to the long list of raves for this recipe! I made this up as a wedding cake this summer (a 5" layer and an 11" layer). It divided into three 1" thick layers very easily! It froze beautifully, too. I also made it up as 9" layers. When I tried the ganache, it was just too hard for the cake, so I used Mrs. Millman's frosting from marthastewart.com: 4 cups whipping cream to 24 oz chocolate chips. Ingredients not as elegant, but it tasted great and was the perfect soft texture for the cake.

The BEST!!!! Everyone goes crazy for this cake. Don't hestiate because of the absence of butter--just a different texture, but still rich, moist, and delicious. I have made the cuban opera cake from this site my standard, but this one is sooooooooo much easier than I find this one becoming my usual. I used 2 9" pans and threw leftover batter in a 6" for my little daughter. I even used regular old Hershey's dark and/or cadbury. Yummy.

A chocolate lover's delight! Superb! Showy! Beaufiful! Bakery quality! Easy to prepare! Wow your friends with this one. I use 2 8 inch pans and make 2/3 of the recipe. I put fresh raspberries on top and serve with whipped cream. Since the chocolate is so intense, the whipped cream or ice cream seems essential. The cake is so easy to handle and goes together in a snap. It freezes well. Reputations are made on cakes like this.

This makes a very decent two-layer chocolate cake. I have deleted this recipe from my recipe box. The absolute best chocolate cake on this site is the Chocolate Stout Cake. It will knock your socks off. It makes a very tall 3 layer cake, but it's worth it. :-)

The cake was really moist which made it little hard to work with but it was worth it. I was afraid that the coffee flavor would be too strong but it was barely detectable. I used the ganache just on top of the cake and made chocolate-orange buttercream (another recipe from this site) to fill it. Delicious!

I made this cake last week for my pregnant sis-in-law. She has called me every day since to thank me. My husband, who could do without chocolate most of the time insisted that this was the BEST cake he had ever tasted. The recipe was perfect. I had no problems- my 9 year old son helped too. Ganache went on flawlessly. My only suggestions would be DO NOT skimp and use cheap chocolate (I used Lindt, it's not the best, but better than Nestle or Hershey), allow frosted cake to sit in refrigerator at least 24 hours for optimum flavor and texture(it was even more moist after 48 hours!), and be sure to let it come almost to room temp before serving. I will surely make it again!

Rating: 4
Amazing cake - and here's a new twist: I added 3/4 t of cayenne to the batter (dry ingredients) and 1/2 t to the ganache (to the cream mixture before heating). Added a tingly burn that built over time - incredible. Don't add cayenne to ganache after mixing in chocolate - it'll break.

Omigod. This recipe is unbelievable and fairly easy to make. I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and baked the cakes in 2 9-inch springform pans which took 1hr and 15mins and turned out great (no spilling in the oven). I mixed some of the ganache with whipped cream to make a mousse filling, and then split the layers and filled with the mousse and fresh raspberries but it made the cake kind of complicated to assemble. In future, I'll make just two layers and pile on the mousse filling in between. My boyfriend doesn't really like chocolate and he ended up licking the bowl and eating a whole piece all by himself. We will be making this again.

This cake is a chocoholic's dream. It's so sinful that I had to get it out of the house just so I could stop eating it! I made it in 3 8" pans, and each was moist and perfect. I followed the recipe to the letter, except for the baking time which I reduced to about 45 minutes. The other reviewers are right, only the best chocolate works; I used 70% south american. A tip: the ganache was overpowering for anyone but the most passionate chocolate fans, so use a simple buttercream icing.

I grew up on cake mixes and had only made about 5 cakes from scratch before this. It was surprisingly easy and it got rave reviews. My favorite praise is always, "you made this yourself?" Yay! I used 3 8" pans and made one two-layer cake that I served at a dinner party and one one-layer cake that I served at a brunch party the next day. I used hot water instead of coffee which seems to have worked fine, though I will probably try coffee next time. I made everything a day in advance and stored the icing at room temperature. It was perfect spreading consistency when I was ready to go.

Oh my!!! This cake IS the chocolate cake you are looking for!! The ones that don't like it, you made a mistake for sure. If you overbeat or overbake the mixture it will be too dry. I halved the recipe and put in a 9x13 glass pan and baked about 40 minutes. I also used boiling water instead of coffee because the person I am making this for detects and detests coffee in anything. The water worked absolutely fine. I did use a bittersweet not semi-sweet chocolate, though, to get that "dirt" chocolate taste. Oh my gosh I can not stop eating this cake, and I am not a chocolate cake fan.

This is a great, dense fudgy cake that is so easy to make. Careful though, I would make it in 3 9-inch pans as it overflowed in both of mine. Delicious and rich with coffee flavor. Good with a simple vanilla buttercream too. I will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe for the cake and ganache in thirds to make cupcakes. They were out of this world. I made 12 but I should have made 13 or 14 because they overflowed the top in an unatractive way. No matter since they tasted so good. I baked them for 15 minutes and then kept checking every 5 minutes. They stayed moist and delicious for a week. Use foil liners because they stick.

YUM! This cake is one of the best (if not THE best) chocolate cake I have ever made. I used a 9" springform pan to make both layers and it turned out perfectly. I skipped the wax paper and simply sprayed the pans with Baker's Secret. The layers came out of the pan very easily.

Thank you Carlsbad. I made the cake again after reading your comment and did not to overmix the batter this time. The cake was moist and good and enjoyed by the teenagers who ate it. It's simply not my favorite style of choc cake - it's gooey and too much chocolate.

I made this cake way back when for a Y2K bash, and, amazingly, forgot about it (though it was the hit of the party). After seeing it on Constant Comment last week, I tried it again, wondering if it was as good as I remembered. Well, my memory didn't do this one justice, and I'm more convinced than ever that this is THE best dessert I've ever eaten. It is the quintessential chocolate cake.

Rating: 4
Perhaps the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used. The best part is it gets better the second and third day, and will keep at room temperature for up to five, if it lasts that long. Doesn't necessarily need the ganache - a sprinkling of powdered sugar and a little softly lightly sweetened whipped cream is all it needs if you want something less formal, but go all the way to really impress people.

This cake is amazing. I prepared it for my boyfriend's birthday and invited his friends to join us. I wanted the cake to impress my beau and his buds, and this one exceeded all expectations.

I've make this cake for most special occasions since it was published by Gourmet. It's never failed to be the showstopper of the meal. Really fantastic. I have no idea how the previous reviewer's cake turned out dry. Perhaps it was beaten too long?This cake borderlines on slightly too moist (it nearly falls apart unless you cut it with a knife dipped in hot water).

This recipe is hyped up, not one of three people liked it. It was dry and the ganache was gooey-fudgy, like a brownie. Not cakey enough for our taste. It did not taste good! I used Ghiradelli chocolate and many organic fine quality ingredients. An awful tasting cake, don't make this one.

This cake is for serious chocoholics. The flavor is intensely chocolate without being overly sweet (I also cut down the sugar by about 1/2 a cup). I feared all that unadulterated chocolate would be too monotonous, so I spread 6 oz of thawed raspberries (did not have fresh on hand) between the layers. Next time, I will put the other 6oz of raspberries on top of the cake, then frost it. Maybe a crown of fresh raspberries around the rim. It's gilding the lily, but the raspberries are wonderful with the cake.

I made this cake and it is just wonderful...I did not have expensive chocolate, and still the taste was divine. The cake itself is very rich and moist, it glistens, and the ganache is the perfect compliment. Helpful hint, definitely let the ganache sit a while to firm up before you start frosting the cake. I used only 2 layers and they are very tall...This cake is truly beautiful and tasty too! Definitely a keeper for anyone who loves chocolate..I had 2 peices!!!

Fantastic. Because of what I was doing i halved the recipe and used the ganache between layers while using an espresso cream cheese frosting (Light[that's right- light] cream cheese, and powdered sugar and espresso to taste - I'm not a measurer). For coffee i used a double hit of espresso and added water. Moist to the nth degree.

oh my goodness gracious! I've been making chocolate cakes for years, but I baked this cake for my husband's 50th Birthday and will never go back to the old recipe. It is amazing and will be made for every birthday from here on out. I reviewed only the cake recipe, as I made a chocolate buttercream frosting, but the cake is truly to die for. It is so moist and even is better the 2nd day after baking. Didn't take the full time to bake, so test it before the timer dings!

One of my favorite chocolate desserts. The last time I made this, I made half the frosting & only frosted one layer ( am freezing the other half for later). I don't usually have groups of people large enough to consume the full size delectibly rich recipe, so this has been a great way to indulge, without too much leftover. I love it with Callebaut semi sweet chocolate & Hershey's cocoa.

I tried it out tonite. Thought the cake was yummy, but a bit too sweet. Same thing for the ganache. Any idea if it is ok if I halved the sugar? And do I have to refrigerate the cake after frosting it? And the cake turned out lop-sided. Do i have to trim the cake to even it out first? The appearance of the cake didnt look very appetising. Any advise on how to improve on the appearance?

WoWeee this is good. I mean really good. I have a favorite buttercream frosting that I pair with this recipe, so I can comment only on the cake but man-o-man is it good. This is not a fine textured, sophisticated kind of cake; it is a down and fudgy, super dense and gooey, chocolaty, chocolate cake. Makes fantastic cupcakes because it won't dry out. Enjoy it...we do!

I have made this cake over three dozen times, trying different chocolates. They all came out wonderfully. I bake the layers in 9" springform pans for 50 minutes. It's important not to overbake. For grown-up parties, some chambord can be added to the ganache as well as in between the layers for even more flavor. Happy baking!

I made this cake and brought it in to work for a birthday celebration, and PEOPLE LOVED IT! I made it the night before and I think being in the fridge overnight really helped with the texture of the cake. It really was delish..like a giand truffle-cake (because of the ganache frosting)

I finally made this cake after checking out the comments for a few months. Went out and bought the 10 inch cake pans which were hard to find, and the Callebaut Chocolate which came in one big chunk and had to be chopped down to small pellet size pieces. It tasted very much like a store bought cake - sickenly sweet - both the cake and the frosting. The texture was very much like a store bought cake rather than a homemade cake (our preference). Even the kids barely ate any of it. I took the other 3/4 of it to work and about half ended up in the garbage. I would make it again if it was possible to cut down on the sugar to about 1/4 of the amount. Does anyone know if that would change the cake in the baking process in terms of the length of time and its height? And about the texture - what method should I use or not use to have more of a homemade type texture?

This cake is very delicious, but not the best of the best. See March 2004 Bon Appetit Devils Food. I did enjoy it and it was certainly a hit with my chocolate cake lover. I did decrease the sugar by half and dusted the pan with cocoa instead of flour. It has a very rich flavor without the weight of a rich cake. I will no doubt will make it again. Very easy.

On the strength of the many superb reviews for this cake, I made this cake for Easter dessert...with a houseful of my daughter's college classmates as guests. I had previously hunted down and purchased the necessary 10" cake pans, and was eager to make what promised to be an exciting dessert. Yes, the cake WAS good, too, but it wasn't nearly as spectacular as I'd hoped it would be. Despite my ordinarily very efficient oven, it took nearly 1.5 hrs to bake the two layers, and even then I wasn't completely convinced that they were done. One stuck a tad to its paper liner, but not terribly enough to ruin the cake. However, both were a bit sunken in the middle, and I was worried about whether upending one layer onto the other would damage it while assembling and frosting the ensemble. As it happens, that worked out well...but there was only JUST enough frosting to fill and frost the cake. The frosting was excellent, however, and handled well. I might make this again and bake the cake a little longer still...or at a temperature higher than 300. (Did anyone else find this temperature peculiar?) I would also consider making 1.5 times the frosting recipe. I have a select stable of winning chocolate recipes that are better than this one, but this deserves a second chance...and it WAS still a delicious cake. Just not the "ne plus ultra" I had been led to expect.

I've made this several times to rave reviews. ONe note, use PARCHMENT paper instead of waxed paper to line your pans--the one time I used wax paper I had a lot of difficulty removing the cake from the pans--had to do a patch job on my bottom layer.

The cake itself is very good. It was nice and moist with a complex chocolate flavor. However, what troubled me was the fact that I baked the cake in two 9 inch pans and was totally dumbfounded by how long I should bake them, and I am no dummy when it comes to cake-baking. The two layers ended up only taking about 45 minutes--entirely half of what the recipe says 10 inch layers would require. That really confused me. It turned out great, but I'm still a little wary of this recipe, especially for less experienced bakers. I'm just glad I checked them after a half hour!

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I made it in two 9" cheese cake pans with removeable sides (as suggested by another reviewer) and it turned out perfectly with tall, sturdy layers that were easy to handle and tasted super moist and chocolatey. The ganache was great and easy to work with. The finished, frosted cake looked just like the picture. Splurge on good quality chocolate, I think it makes a big difference.

A delicious, moist, easy, very chocolaty cake! My daughter requested chocolate cake for her 3rd birthday, and this cake fed 12 adults and 6 kids very well with leftovers! I folded a little whipped cream into a little of the ganache, to make a mousse filling for between the layers, which was a delicious contrast of texture. I spread/poured the ganache on the top thickly, and very thinly coated the sides, not worrying about appearance, as I planned on adding a layer of milk chocolate frosting on the sides, as well. When I chilled the cake, the ganache hardened, and I could spread the frosting on the sides and use some to write Happy Birthday on top. A few requisite sprinkles (very important when you are 3!) completed it. I will note that I had to adjust for altitude (we are at 5600'). I reduced the leavening by 1/4 and added some extra water to the batter. There was a slight dip in the center of the cake, easily filled with frosting, but I can't decide if I should do more or less leavening next time.

This was my first crack a layer cake, and i thought that it was wonderful. I actually used 9" pans with no problem, or modifications... The ganache is amazing, and the cake was light and moist. The only complaint was that it's very rich - so make sure your audience is chocolate-loving.

I follwed the directions but the cake didn't turn out :( It fell apart and the frosting wouldn't adhere .. Even though it tasted fine, I don't see what all the fuss was about. I don't think I'd make this again with all the other recipes here. I'll give another cake a try.

I made this for a Superbowl party (chips and guac are SO passe). Fantastic, even when forced to use Nestle bars and resort to a few modifications: I only had 9-inch pans, which left me with enough batter to bake three layers. Only ended up stacking two, though, and kept the third for my greedy self (two 9-inch layers still made a tall, formidable cake, being so rich). Also, I added a little ground hazelnut to the middle layer of ganache for a subtle but tasty accent. Should have added more, it worked well. And I made some shavings from the chocolate bar to sprinkle on the top, which made the whole presentation quite professional. ("WHERE did you buy this cake?" they asked, setting aside their plates of guac. "Oh, I whipped it up this afternoon," I replied, ever so casually.) My advice on additions: A cake as rich and chocolatey and fanstatic as this stands alone. No reason to overly distract with raspberry jam, especially if you're using good chocolate. Other flavors would have been overkill.

I've made this cake three times, the first time with just the ganache, and the next with the ganache and a buttercream. Much better with the buttercream added, and an earlier reviewer was right that you need to make sure the cake isn't cold when you eat it. If you microwave a piece just a few seconds, just long enough for the ganache to soften...ahhh. Everyone who has eaten this cake has LOVED it. I can only think that the (few)reviewers who didn't think this cake was fabulous must've done something wrong while baking it. Either that or they're the type who like cake mixes.

This was the first homemade cake I have ever baked, and it turned out beautifully! I couldn't believe how moist it was-I think the recipe is foolproof. It was pretty rich though, so the second time I baked it, I added a middle and top layer of peanut butter frosting to break up the chocolate a bit. I finished with the ganache. Everybody loved it!!

Rating: 2
I made this cake with the black forest cherry compote as suggested by another member. I thought the chocolate cake part was a bit overpowering and needed a little more balance. The cake was extremely tall, so there was a high cake to layer ratio. If I made it again, I would either break it into two shorter cakes, or having a stronger flavor in the middle (like rasberry preseves) as suggested by another member. The ganache was good, and the cake was moist and had a good texture, but I suppose I prefer the flourless chocolate cakes.

This cake turned out well in the end, but be aware that the recipe calls for 10 inch pans! I think most ar 9 inch-- at least mine are, and I made the mistake of not adjusting the quantities, and the cake spilled out into the oven! But, I was able to salvage what stayed in the pan, and cut the cake to look right. Not sure why the recipe says to chill-- much better left at room temp! Much more moist when not chilled. Might make this cake with a different frosting next time-- the ganache is just so thick and heavy. Overall, a very good cake.

First time I tried this I didn't adjust the leavening enough for the altitude here (about 3000 feet) and it rose very fast then sunk in the centre. But the taste and texture of this 'failure' was so good I tried again, reducing the soda to 1 and 1/2 tsp and the powder to 1/2 plus 1/8 tsp. Still sunk slightly, but almost perfect. Also used dutch processed cocoa because I don't like the red hue given by natural cocoa, and can only get crappy supermarket natural cocoa here or pay a fortune for organic stuff. Used Callebaut chocolate. Filled it with a not too sweet vanilla buttercream from Cook's Illustrated April 2000(so good!). This cake is what I think a chocolate cake should taste like and all tasters loved it. Can't imagine what the nay-sayers are expecting or doing to not like.

and if you divide the cake ingredients by 2/3, don't scale back on the frosting. If you make a 9" cake, you still need a similiar amount of frosting as the 10" cake.

Rating: 3
You can cut the cake ingredients by 2/3 and use two 9"x1.5" round pans and it comes out to be a reasonable size (even then, we gave some of it away). The cake is very moist, but be sure to check on it every 5min starting from 40min because 9" pans will cook faster than 10" pans. Also, trim the sides if needed to make it even so the ganache covers the edges evenly. The frosting was awesome. One of the few frostings that leaves me feeling choco-bombed (though it overpowers the chocolatey flavor of the cake). It's even more chocolatey than Cheesecake Factory's 10 layer chocolate cake :-)

Loved it. Was skeptical about the hype but am now happy to add to the 4 fork parade. It was fudgy and rich, but has a light moist texture. The ganache is the perfect complement. It's also an easy & forgiving recipe: I goofed and baked at 350 (in 9x2" pans), checked at 50 minutes and found a dry toothpick, realized my error, shreeked and hoped for the best. It was the best, and now replaces my former standard choc. cake (Silver Palate Decadent Choc. Cake). I used the chocolate I had on hand: Ghirardelli semisweet bar from Trader Joes + Toll House chips - next time I'll upgrade to see if I can tell the difference. The cake fed 8 happy adults & 10 equally happy kids. Got Milk?

I've made this cake twice now and it is just as good as everyone says. BUT, it is intensely chocolate. Even my 7-year-old daughter, at one point, couldn't finish it because it was "too chocolate-y." What I will do next time is to make this in an 8- or 9-inch cake pan because it is impossible to cut a modest piece of a 10-inch cake (the circumference is too great to cut a sliver, if you know what I mean). My DH, one of the world's foremost chocoholics, also suggested using a different, lighter, frosting, something more like a ganache. But if you want to kill someone with chocolate, this is the cake!

The BEST chocolate cake!!! I made 3- 8 inch layers that took 55 minutes to cook in my oven. After reading reviews about how rich the ganache was I decided to just spread it only between the layers and let it seep out. I sprinkled white chocolate shavings on top just to add some contrast. I made it on a Tuesday and placed in fridge until Friday night. Tasted like I made it that day! I didn't have much ganache left over...my 6 year old spread it over a banana and my 8 year old mixed some with pecans!!!

The cake is wonderful, and really is fail-safe. As there is a large amount of dry ingredients to put together, I found after mixing wet and dry together that I had ommitted 2 cups of the sugar (by taste) so I stirred more sugar in. This did NOT make the cake tough! Silicon cake pans did not need liners nor greasing. I patted finely chopped hazelnuts around the exterior ganache for presentation and taste. For better than 20 years I have normally made a frosting by mixing equal measures of sour cream and melted chocolate chips, and likely will do that next time as it's even easier than this ganache. I did not have trouble cutting the ganache-frosted cake straight from the refrigerator, but used a serrated blade so that might help. I had taken the time to distill ALL the reviews' information about pan sizes, chocolate options and filling options down to 3 pages so I'd have plenty of options for the future. I normally make the Easiest, Best Chocolate Mousse Cake from "Instant Gratification" by Lauren Chattman or Alice Medrich's Reine de Saba as both cakes are none fail and easy, and easily altered according to my whim of the moment. This chocolate layer cake fits with my desires for ease and adaptability--and that's saying a LOT. Thank you for this recipe, and thanks to all the reviewers whose information is so helpful.

The first time I made this recipe just as written, but the second time I cut the two layers into four and used the ganache to fill the cut layers. Then I made a chocolate buttercream that I adapted from Rosie's All-Butter Fresh Cream Sugar-Packed No-Holds-Barred Baking Book and used it to frost the middle, top, and sides. IT WAS FABULOUS. It made a huge cake, but our family of five ate the entire thing within a couple of days. The ganache is delicious so we didn't want to give it up, but it was pretty overpowering with just the cake and ganache the first time I made it. Believe it or not, the addition of the buttercream made the cake seem lighter. It was absolutely scrumptious. Heavenly. I'm making it again for my mom's birthday on Christmas Eve. My mouth is already watering.

For those folks having trouble with the ganache, try making the ganache as the layers cook. Allow it to cool in the same pot that you cooked it in, stirring every 7-10 minutes. It should be at a nice spreadable consistency by the time your layers are cool. Works for me everytime... =|:-) Ed Kasky

I have had my eye on this recipe for about a year and, frankly, did not believe all the hype. Until I made it this past weekend. It truly is the most wonderful chocolate cake one can imagine.

One of the best chocolate cakes I've had (ate without the frosting)! Very moist, tender, dark and chocolatey. Used Ghirardelli cocoa, lowfat buttermilk, Nestle semisweet chips, and instant coffee. It didn't melt smoothly, but didn't seem to matter with the finished product. I used a wire whip to mix the dry ingredients resulting in small lumps of cocoa floating at the top of the cake batter, so I poured it through a sieve. I also used a 9" springform pan (what I had available) & lined the outside with foil. Just had to bake it a few minutes longer and it came out great. Definitely will bake this again!

I was making this for my friends birthday, but I rushed the recipe and didn't give it enough time to cool down. On top of that I tried to do it in one day. The cake didn't make it to the party, but the next day I sliced it up (by the way it look better sliced) and had my husband take it to work. It flew out of the break room so fast, and now I have people asking for the recipe to make for thanksgiving. Wonderful chocolate cake... I think next time I will try it with a buttercream.

This cake was excellent--moist and super chocolatey. I've made it twice now and this will continue to be my stand-by chocolate cake. I liked the ganache, but for those who aren't as big a chocolate fan as I am, it might be a bit over the top. I'm going to try making it with a vanilla buttercream.

With over 500 reviews this recipe had to be good. I bought chocolate store chocolate for the Ganache at $17./lb! It was like eating a big chocolate truffle. I think I could have used what we get in Canada- Baker's semi sweet chocolate and it would be just as good for 1/4 the cost. Never-the-less my husband was ticked I gave some away to my son- whose birthday cake it was and my 89 yr. old mother who loved it too! The stuff of greed! Enjoy! Guelph,Ontario

I made a double recipe for a huge sheet cake for a Halloween party. As a nervous cake baker, I thought the recipe was pretty easy to follow. The flavor is fabulous and it's incredibly moist. I did use another chocolate ganache recipe though. I will use this as my standard chocolate cake recipe.

Rating: 4
I've probably made this recipe about 15 times since I "discovered" it almost 5 years ago, and it is absolutely THE best chocolate cake ever. It's moist, rich and dense without being too heavy or cloying. I have dreams about all the wonderful variations I could make with this recipe [seriously]. I use Van Houten cocoa and Lindt baking chocolate (not sure if you can get either in North America), and it turns out perfectly every time. I like the ganache, but I find that this cake PLUS ganache is really rich and to be served in small slices on very special occasions. I've made it with Vanilla Buttercream (Gourmet Entertains, January 2004), which is extremely labour intensive but worth the effort - it makes a beautiful cake and is a nice contrast to the chocolate. Re: leftover batter - I use deep 9" pans (instead of the 10" ones the recipe recommends), and usually have enough batter left to make a mini cake which I bake in the oven with the first layer (I have a small French oven...) and eat it while the second is baking! All in all, this is my favourite recipe for ANYTHING EVER!

I have made this cake about 10 times and it is always delicious. I am an avid baker but this cake gets rave after rave. It is really easy to make, just takes a little longer. My son always requests it for his birthday. I use Scarffen Berger semi-sweet chocolate which produces a very smooth, lusterous frosting.

This cake is fab! The buttermilk makes the cake extra moist. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and Ghirardelli cocoa powder in the cake, and made a basic buttercream frosting from the same. Because I didn't have 10-inch pans, I used two 9-inch and threw away a small portion of the batter (what a waste!) and carefully watched the baking progress (about 40 minutes in my oven). Next time I will try the ganache and will use a higher-end chocolate. I think the cake would also be good warm with cocoa sprinkled over it, no ganache.

With regard to the comment on the rock hard ganache, I have had the same problem in the past. Different chocolate brands behave differently, but the more bittersweet, the harder it will turn out. I don't particularly like that. The best fluffy chocolate frosting I've had was a cream cheese frosting (you can't taste the cream cheese). Email me if you'd like a copy. Good luck!

I've been reading this recipe since it showed up here, and finally made it! The cake itself is pretty good, very rich and moist, but the frosting (and I made it exactly as written) turned out rock hard! No one seems to have had this problem, and the photo certainly looks nice, but no one enjoyed a cake with slabs of hard chocolate on top. I didn't refrigerate it, or do anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps if I needed a cake recipe I'd use this again with a different frosting, but there are so many others out there , I don't know if I'd bother.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and he LOVED it. Two of our kids asked to have it on their birthdays. I used Ghiardelli chocolate but next time I'll search for something better. The only problem I had was that I used three 9 inch pans, and I baked them for 50 minutes, based on an earlier review. The layers looked perfect and it was a perfect amount of batter, but it was too long. Next time I'll either get 10 inch pans or bake it for less time. It's easier to store the 9 inch - it fits under my cake dome.

I've never had a chocolate cake from scratch this awesome. They are always dry and bland, but this cake is incredible, moist and very chocolate.

Made this for my husband's birthday. He only ate one piece. My son and daughter had a few over the course of a couple days. I had one. Had to throw the rest out.

At last! The chocolate cake of my dreams! Luscious, moist, reliable, and reasonably easy to make. I have been looking for many years and this is it. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I did the whole thing including the frosting a day ahead and put it in the refrigerator overnight. Took it out in the morning so it would be at room temperature by the time we ate it. (I didn't think that the refrigeration affected the way the ganache looked as a previous reviewer stated.) Everyone loved it and especailly the chocoholics were in heaven. By the way, I have used 2-inch deep 10-inch round cake pans for years. They are always available in craft stores that carry all that cake decorating stuff (like Michael's?)

To really send it over the top, try this walnut filling, courtesy of Shirley Corriher's "Cookwise:" toast 1/2 lb of walnuts, let cool, then whirr in the food processor with 3-4 tablespoons of softened, salted butter. The contrast between the chocolate and the toasted, buttery walnut flavor is remarkable.

I made this cake for the first time with the ganache frosting, and it was delicious!!! BUT, Chocolate overload for even some chocoholics at the table.. I have since paired the cake with a white chocolate whipped cream frosting, found on this site in a lemon lattice cake recipe. Ridiculous!!! Scrupmtious!! I have requests to please make this cake for almost every occasion!! The decadent cake is nicely balanced with this frosting that is so easy, and firm enough to keep the layers from sliding - must be refrigerated though!!! I'm actually making this cake tonight for a dinner party tomorrow! (Special request of course)!!! A real winner!

This is a great chocolate layer cake. I made this cake recipe based on all of the glowing reviews. I wanted to replicate a fantastic dark chocolate cake I enjoyed at a local restaurant. It is an simple recipe. I did use real buttermilk (instead of buttermilk powder). It is worth it for a special occasion. I also used Lindt bittersweet chocolate, instead of semisweet for that dark taste. Everyone said it was an excellent cake.

I made the cake last weekend and it was absolutely fantastic! This has got to be the moistest cake I've ever baked. I did not refrigerate it and it stayed nice and moist. I didn't have high-end chocolate, I used Baker's semi-sweet and part of a bag of chocolate chips (it's all I had!) and the flavor was exceptional. I used three, nine-inch round pans. I also had to refrigerate the ganache for about 15 minutes to thicken it up for frosting.

The best chocolate cake on the planet. For the record the recipe make 8 cups of batter. I made it in a 11x15 pan which called for 11 cups so ended up making 2 cakes.

This cake is fantastic. I made it for a chocoholic's birthday party and got rave reviews from everyone and requests for the recipe. To the cook from North Bellmore, NY, the recipe clearly states to use two 10" pans. You used two 9" pans instead and that is what caused the cake to overflow in your oven. There is no "explosion" factor with this cake. If using 9" pans, you will get three layers out of this cake.

I'd like to make this recipe using a 12 x 18" sheet cake pan. It sounds like the recipe makes a lot of batter, but do people think it would be enough to make a cake of that size? And if not, has anyone tried to double the recipe?

Rating: 4
Be careful!!! I didn't scrutinize the reviews where people note getting an extra layer from this recipe - I made the batter last night, filled 2 9" cake pans and came back into my kitchen 10 minutes later to the smell of burning cake. Both pans were overflowing/bursting/dripping all over my oven; I had to remove the cakes and dump about half the batter from each pan before trying again. The cake looks great (we'll eat it tonight), but I wish I were better warned about the explosion factor!

Very moist cake. I am living in Moscow and can not always get everything I need. I made buttermilk using vinegar, I also had to use instant coffee as I do not have a machine here, and I did not have enough semi-sweet chocolate so I used equal combinations of milk and bittersweet. Everyone thought is was great. A good very easy to make basic chocolate cake recipe.

I'm a very experienced baker, and can say that this is THE best choc cake recipe by far! I modified it to make it more "European" - replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with corn starch (the French do this to make it even more moist), and instead of a heavy and sweet frosting, I sifted high-quality cocoa over it. Family and friends keep asking for it! Looks and tastes just like one served at our favorite 5-star restaurant in Paris!!

THIS CAKE IS FANTASTIC!!! This is my first review and this recepie made me write it!! I am a novice baker but even I could get a great result with this recepie. Folks who ate it eyeballs were rolling back, it was so good!!! The cake itself is moist, light and satisfying. It is not too sweet, nor is grainy. The ganache is out of this world. Put the two together and you have a MAJOR home run. The only small hitch was that I made the ganache the day before and put it in the fridge in a stainless steel bowl. Next day it was hard, so I reheated it over simmering water. No problem. But NOW it was too HOT!! So back in the freezer and checking and whisking until the consistency was right for spreading (not pouring). Took my freezer about an hour. Since the cake was for a special occasion, I used Scharffen Berger semisweet and cocoa powder. It was expensive but I've read that the quality of the chocolate does make a difference. Next time I would try other brands and see what happens. I would, without a moments hesitation, make this recepie again and again. The only changes I might make are to add a thin layer of rasberry jam for the filling layer, and serve some fresh ones with each slice.

To the reviewer from Ontario - are you sure you used 10" pans? There's a lot of batter indeed, but in 10" pans it fits just right. I made this last week for a birthday party - it was very well received! The 3 cups of sugar sort of horrified me, but I was loathe to take them out for fear of screwing up the chemistry of the cake. Very moist, very dark and the frosting tasted great. I chilled it in the fridge overnight and warmed it up over a double boiler to pour over the cake. I found that the glaze was a little oily while warming up - sort of as if the butter had separated from the chocolate and cream...but luckily it didn't taste oily. One person told me it was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had. For another great chocolate cake recipe, try Martha Stewart's Devil's Food Cake with Mrs. Millman's Frosting (it's on her website). It's a truly incredible cake.

Well, the cake was delicious. But I had a tough time with the batter. I filled up 2 baking tins almost to the top, and had so much batter left over I filled up another one! Well, needless to say, all three spilled over into my oven, what a mess to clean up. I was able to salvage two layers and ice them, and I used the third layer to snack on! But I've never made a cake with so much batter - can anyone tel me if this was a double recipe?

My son requested a made from scratch cake for his birthday and I came across this recipe. Since I use the recipes on this website so often, I gave it a try. It was fabulous and even my kids said it was the best cake they ever had! What had I gotten myself into, now a homemade cake for everyone's BD. I did use a buttercream icing from another epicurious recipe, but had a request from my husband for this cake for his BD. Used a raspberry filling and the icing as listed, and it was fabulous. I was in such a hurry, I even left out the 11/2 cups of cocoa this time and it still was great. This even comes out great in Colorado where baking can be a challeng.

This is the BEST chocolate cake ever. I've made it for weddings, birthdays, holidays--it never fails to get raves. Beyond raves--I've had people actually kneel in front of me to thank me for making it... Every time I make it I think the frosting is too thin and every time it chills up perfectly. It's easy to transport--it's so heavy, it never moves on a doily! Strawberries beteen the layers was a great addition this season.

If you love chocolate, this is the one for you! This is a chocoholic's heaven. I used the frosting as directed for the middle layer but heated it to pouring consistency in the microwave and poured it over the cake for a beautiful and fudge-y outside. Next time I would make more frosting and cut the two layers into four with the frosting in between each layer as others have done. It was marvelous and pure chocolate passion!

I bake all the time and look at many recipes before deciding on this one. I cut the layers into 4 layers and ended up having to make more icing. I then decorated it with white chocolate covered strawberries. Looked very professional. The icing is not going to be a normal buttercream icing. It is almost like a rich chocolate ganache. the cake is very moist with great flavor. People at work are already requesting I make it for their husbands birthday.

great! I made it 2 days in advance of a party and it tasted fabulous when served (still moist). Even with mediocre ingredients (Hershey's cocoa powder and Trader Joes Poundplus chocolate bars) it was a hit.

This cake has a deep, complex chocolate flavor that we enjoyed. I paired the cake from this recipe with the milk chocolate frosting recipe(Feb. '04) for my husband's birthday (past experience had me doubting how much he would like the ganache). My husband commented that he liked the cake more than the frosting! I used 3 9" layer pans and had some difficulty with crumbs when applying the fluffy frosting. I covered up the crumbs by adding both white and dark chocolate shavings to the top and sides. My husband took the cake to his office the next day and it apparently received rave reviews! I'll make it again soon with the ganache.

Folks, this cake is awesome. I've made it twice now. Once as a cake and then as cupcakes (baked for 25 minutes). It's incredibly moist, but not greasy. Fluffy, not dense. I don't think I'll use another chocolate cake recipe as long as I have this one handy.

I recommend substituting flavored coffee (I used chocolate raspberry decaf.) The ganache frosting tended to overwhelm the cake, however, and I might prefer a more fluffy cocoa-buttercream frosting. This is a very similar recipe to Hershey's website's "Black Magic Cake" which was the winner in a chocolate cake contest my friend and I held. B.M. is quite a bit less complex to make and less dense(and you can sub whatever kind of cocoa you like to use- even dutch processed because it has both baking powder and baking soda in the recipe.)

This recipe was amazing. I made it for New Year's Eve and there wasn't a crumb left over. I will definitely make it again. The only modification I made was to use a vanilla buttercream frosting for the outside and the ganache only between the layers because it was super rich, a bit too much for me!

Rating: 4
OH MY GOSH! Make this. Use the best quality of chocolate and cocoa [callebaut and ghiradelli] It is worth the splurge. I made an accidental slight modification, I kept on beating the ganache [about 10 minutes in the kitchen aid] until it was of spreading consistency. I didn't chill it but spread it immediately on the cake. Beating it resulted in "truffle". The cake was filled and spread with truffle versus ganache. Sublime! This is THE cake you see in the fancy coffee and desert shops that fetches $7.50 U.S. [that translates to, what, a hundred bucks in Canadian funds?]. I have made 4 copies of this recipe just in case I loose one of them. I think I may will it to my daughter!

Over-the-top chocolate cake! This cake is extremely rich in flavor, but incredibly moist. The chocolate ganache was intense and a dream to spread after a bit of chilling down. The glossy finish made for a wonderful presentation. I made this recipe in 9" cake pans, so check the cake at around 50 - 55 minutes. I used Ghiardelli semi-sweet chocolate and cocoa powder. This cake, made for a birthday celebration, had everyone raving. Definitely will make it again!

This was incredible. I made it for my office birthday party using Callebaut semi-sweet and Ghirardelli cocoa powder, in 9 inch pans (40-45 mins) and it was incredible. The ganache is simple, but keep a close eye on it in the fridge. THe ganache set beautifully and one co-worker, after eating a slice, said she felt she needed a cigarette or a shower ;o) I didn't even need to slice the tops off; each layer was almost perfectly flat. Don't worry if the cake batter appears foamy when ready for the pans. Next time I'm going to cut each layer in half, sprinkle them with orange liqueuer, and use marmalade alternately with the ganache inbetween the layers, and then put some orange liquer in the ganache itself for a new twist.

The ultimate chocolate experience! I am a lifelong chocoholic but very picky, and after making this cake three times, I must agree with all the superlative descriptions. Very moist, dense, and delicious. Got rave reviews from everyone. I used Guittard semi-sweet chips in the cake and ganache, didn't bother with sifting. I live at 7000 ft. altitude so I cut back on sugar, baking soda, and baking powder but it didn't seem to make that much difference from my first try when I made no adjustments. Used two 9-inch pans (had leftover batter) and only needed to bake for 45 minutes or less. The ganache is so easy but tastes and looks like it's made by a pro. Mine needed about 10 minutes in the fridge to be perfect for spreading. I left one batch in longer and it quickly became too hard to spread. Next I'm going to get some 10' pans and also see if a fancier cocoa (used Hershey's and Nestle) changes the taste.

Magnificent! Incredibly dense, moist, chocolatey cake. Got rave reviews. Word of caution during preparation, though. I'm at a high altitude (7500 ft.), and I think that affected the cake during baking. I split the cake into three 9" pans, and it still overflowed while baking. Took about an hour and 20 minutes to cook, too. In spite of all that, though, it was fabulous and I can't wait to make it again.

I couldn't believe how delicious this cake was. I couldn't believe that I made it myself. Very hard to get out of the pan, though. Husband thought it was so good that he declared it the best cake he'd ever tasted. High chocolate flav.

After reviewing the 10 pages of glowing reviews, I decided to make this cake today for my sister in law. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than bars. Big deal--the recipe says to buy semi-sweet chocolate and cut it into small chips. Also, I did use two 8 inch glass cake pans because I had no 9 inches. I remember thinking during the recipe that 1 and 1/2 cups cocoa was a lot, but I trusted the recipe. Bad idea. The batter was very rich and very chocolate tasting--better than a mix, of course. However, when the cake came out (check on it after 50 minutes rather than the 1and half hours recommended or it could burn quickly) I let it cool for more than an hour. The ganache icing I followed the exact recipe, and let cool while we went out to dinner. Came home, tried to assemble. The cake was so moist it wouldn't come out of the pan, finally breaking into three pieces. I used icing to "glue" the cake together and hide cracks. Now for the taste. TOO MUCH COCOA! The cake was moist, dense, rich, but almost bitter...the cocoa was too much, as was 1 and half cups coffee--you could taste bitter cocoa and coffee. The cake was too rich, and didn't even need icing. The icing was also "TOO" chocolatey and had no balance of flavors. The icing was, however, creamy and spreadable after more than an hour of cooling in the saucepot on the counter. Believe me, unless you like a very rich chocolate taste with nothing to balance the bitter cocoa flavor, DON'T MAKE THIS CAKE!

I haven't made this yet b/c I'm not sure what kind of cocoa to use. My favorites are Valrhona or Pernigotti, but both are dutch-process. Any recommendations? I've heard good things about Droste and I'm not really in love with Ghiradelli. What else is out there? Thanks.

This is a fabulous recipe - dense, moist and rises beautifuly that always gets rave reviews. I have made the ganache with both Bakers chocolate and Callebaut, and the Callebaut is definitly worth the expense. One of the best cakes I've ever had.

This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe! Super moist, great crumb, dark chocolate color and very intense chocolate flavor. I halved the recipe (using 2 eggs) and baked in two 8 1/2 x 7 1/2 oval cake pans. Ganache is good for puitans but next time I will probably put in a chocolate mousse(and chambord) with fresh raspberries for the filling.

Talk about chocolate heaven. Moreover, this cake is the closest thing to bakery moist and light that I have ever prepared. Despite using good ingredients, cephalon pans, watching how much I mix the batter etc, so many homemade cakes are dry, heavy and crumbly. Not this one! I used the mocha frosting from this websight (1 1/2 times for two 9" cakes) which makes plenty of frosting. Next time I will split the cakes, do a chocolate mousse filling and go with the chocolate ganache in the recipe. Awesome! I used two cephalon pans as another reviewer did but didn't want to risk the cake overflowing. So I used about 1 1/2 cups of cake batter as cupcakes. This was a good idea as the cake rose quite a bit. This website is just invaluable. Thanks everyone.

This is the perfect chocolate cake. I didn't make any changes at all, and even had luck with no sifting (because I was in a hurry). A foolproof recipe that produces the best, most chocolatey cake I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Even the ganache was perfect after a bit of refrigeration to set. Looks and tastes like it was made by a pro!

I made this cake for New Year's 2004. I love the cake, but the frosting could have been better. I found that if you refrigerate the frosting, the texture isn't that great (and I used the expensive Callabaut chocolate for the frosting!) I think it is much better if you leave it at room temp. The cake however, is exactly what I've been looking for! I used 3 oz of a Ghiradelli semi-sweet baking bar. I ended up using a chocolate buttercream for the middle of the cake because the ganache frosting really wasn't enough for the whole cake. Make this cake, you'll love it!

This is the only chocolate cake I make, and I make it about 20 times a year! I make all the birthday cakes in our family and it is always this one. I make it in 3 8" round pans for the adults and 2 large sheet pans for the kids. I skip the ganache part and use swiss meringue buttercream (martha stewart kids magazine) or chocolate whip cream icing (epicurious) as I like to decorate the cakes. this is such an easy recipe, you cannot mess it up. I actually forgot the 3 cups of sugar once and only noticed (when my 2 year old exclaimed "yuk" when she began to lick the beaters)after i had poured the batter into the three pans and put them in the oven. I quickly poured it all back into the mixing bowl, added the sugar and baked. it was perfect! This cake also freezes well. I slice the leftover cake into one serving slices and freeze individually in rubbermaid containers. It thaws in about 15 minutes and YUM, what a treat out of the freezer. ONE IMPORTANT TIP... I line my pans with parchment and then oil with vegetable oil. Instead of using flour to coat the pan, use COCOA, it won't turn the cake edges white.

Rating: 4
I love this cake every time I make it--easy and delicious! It also works well for cupcakes. Just bake at the given temperature for 20-25 minutes. The recipe makes about 36 cupcakes and one batch of ganache is sufficient for all of them.

This dark, chocolaty cake is easy and great. I'll never need another recipe. I went the lazy route and dumped the whole batter into a professional nonstick 6 qt. pot and baked it for 1.5 hours. Perfectly moist, yum. I drooled a simple choco/cream ganache over the top while it was still warm and hastily carved off my first slab. I highly suggest trying this cake warm. Call it impatience. Call it whatever. I don't even like chocolate very much and this cake rocked.

After eating many chocolate cakes - a variety ranging from home baked to those turned out by upscale, expensive restaurants - most of them on the dry side and too sweet or just not packed with flavor, finally I've found the 'go to' chocolate cake! Furthermore, despite being an inept cake baker (I've more than once sworn to never make another layer cake), I was able to put the layers together and manage the ganache easily. Two things: 1. I used bittersweet chocolate for more chocolate flavor/less sweet 2. I cut out a 1/2 Cup of sugar. Turned out perfectly and my chocoholic friends are raving about it!

Rating: 3
LOVED the cake -- baked in 9.5" springform, very impressive presenatation. Moist, dark -- perfect. Underwhelmed by the ganache -- I doubled the recipe -- one batch seemed insufficient to coat. Might have been the extra, but found with good quality bittersweet chocolate, ganache was just too much -- no flavor other than "pure chocolate." Second time around, made with a sweet cream cheese frosting ("winter white") -- looked and tasted INCREDIBLE. Rave reviews, incredibly impressive. Topped white frosting with purchased mini-merengues... easy easy decoration, very professional looking. Still being talked about a week later.

This cake is excellent. I made one change and that was to use only half a cup of vegetable oil and a quarter cup of melted butter. Kept the cake moist but gave a hint of rich butter taste.

I made this cake for my wife's birthday (she too is a chocoholic). This is, without a doubt, the best chocolate chocolate cake I've ever had, and certainly the best I've ever baked. I unfortunately didn't have access to more exotic chocolates, so I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate and Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa power, but I don't know that it could have been much better (although I'd like to try different ones). The ganache retained a distinct hint of semi-sweetness, primarily because it doesn't have much else in it. But I think this is what makes it ... any more sugar, and the cake would have been too rich. Also, I agree with the other reviewer -- with the Ghirardelli chocolate, the ganache definitely had to be chilled. But it then spread very, very nicely. And the recipe was correct -- after cooling the layers, I needed to store them until the next day, and the plastic wrap worked well. The cake stayed moist after 24 hours like this at room temperature. Lastly, my recommendation to anyone who didn't like this recipe that much ... don't change the recipe! You'll be amazed at what a difference that simple recommendation makes. :)

I made this for the Yom Kippur break fast at my chocoholic friend's house, and she raved about it. It was by far the prettiest cake I've ever made; people thought it was store-bought (and believe me, I'm no garnish expert!) The ganache was easier to work with than expected; I think chilling it helped. I plan to make this for New Years (the same friend will be there!)

I made this cake for a birthday party I threw this past weekend. Let me just say, the cake was fantastic and went so incredibly quickly. The ganache was fantastic (I enjoyed advertising the fact that the frosting alone had a whole pound of chocolate in it). I've already had several people ask me to make them one, or at least give them the recipe. Love it.

Rating: 4
I made it using 9" pans, cooked for just under 1 hour. I made a double amount of frosting though, just to be sure I had enough (glad I made that much). The cake went over extremely well. I admit I'm not the biggest chocolate fan and I thought the frosting was a little tough (could that be?). Overall a big hit with the chocolate lovers.

Rating: 3
I made this in a bundt pan (used the remaining batter for 5 cupcakes), baked it for about an hour and 10 minutes. I had no problem getting it out of the pan (I Criscoed and floured the bundt pan very well before pouring the batter in). I used Ghiradelli cocoa powder and Scharfenberger semi-sweet chocolate for the melted chocolate and the ganache, I also used less sugar (maybe 1/2 a cup less) than the recipe called for. The cake itself was good, not the best chocolate cake I've ever had, the ganache was to die for - delicious.

As a chocoholic descended from a long line of chocoholics, just let me say this cake is incredible. My mother requested a chocolate dessert from Thanksgiving and I decided to try this recipe. We decided to sample a slice before the family meal and then we kept it all for ourselves. It was wonderful. In our mind this is the perfect chocolate cake bar none.

I've already reviewed this fabulous cake (++++!!) and I now have a question for the more accomplished bakers here at epicurious...where (preferably online..I live in the sticks!) do you recommend I buy high quality 10 inch cake pans? I've used 9 inch pans for this cake and they work just fine, but I'd like to go for the dramatic larger diameter. Thanks in advance.

I am swooning as well. I used Lindt excellence for the icing and it was well worth the fortune spent. I agree that that you should give yourself plenty of time before serving this cake to prepare it since the icing will take a while to cool until it's ready to spread. I put mine in a glass bowl in the fridge, and stirred occasionally until it looked ready to go. A memorable cake for birthdays!

Wow! This was excellent! I never make cakes because I am more of a pie person, but I made this for my husband's birthday after reading all of the great reviews. I worried a bit when I soemone said that it was labor intensive, but I disagree. It was pretty straightforward to make, just make sure you have plenty of time for everything to cool. I didn't allow enough time so the ganache was pretty soupy as I poured it on. Made a bit of a mess on the serving plate, but hey, that's what fingers are for. The cake was moist and dense. We all picked at it for day. I will make this again!

The room went silent when this cake was served! I'm not a chocolate cake fan, so the receipe rating is based on the feedback of the chocolate lovers in the group.

YUM! I followed the recipe exactly, using 10" pans and my cake was done in 50 minutes. I was somewhat befuddled by the recipe's instruction to "cool layers completely in pans on racks... invert layers onto racks... and cool layers completely." I allowed my layers to cool in the pans for about 20 minutes before turning them out and they released easily. I tried the suggestion of one reviewer to partially freeze the cake layers before frosting. If anyone else takes this suggestion, please note that the cool temperature of the cake layers dramatically affected the spreadability of my frosting. You may not want to allow your frosting to thicken too much before attempting to spread it. Last, I found that I had more control over the frosting's consistency by chilling the frosting in a bowl in the refrigerator and stirring it about every five minutes rather than placing the bowl of frosting over a bowl of ice water which, even with constant stirring, seemed to thicken the frosting at the bottom of the bowl to a hardness that was difficult to reincorporate into the rest of the frosting.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday and it turned out so well that I made it again for another friend's birthday. I used Ghiradelli chocolate, and experimented with a few different cake pan sizes, and was extremely pleased both times--as were all the folks who indulged in the cake!

This is a fabulous chocolate cake. I made a mistake and forgot to grease the pan so we had to eat that cake out of the pan! It was so good that I made it again the next day to bring to a party. Everyone loved it. The cake is moist and delicious and the ganache is wonderful as well. I will definitely make this one again. I used Guittard double chocolate chips for the chocolate and it was great.

A keeper - cake is really moist & ganache frosting fairly simple to make. The end-product was beautiful. Only challenge was that the ganache was hard to cut through, once it set. We added fresh raspberries on top of cake and in filling.

I'll join the chorus--excellent chocolate cake. I did cut back both cocoa and sugar by one-third (1 cup cocoa, 2 cups sugar) because both amounts seemed excessive, even for 10-inch layers. I also used about 2/3 cup oil. Ghirardelli double chocolate chips worked great for cake and ganache -- I'm sure this is the same chocolate used in the more expensive 4-ounce bars.

Tasted great -- that from a person who never chooses chocolate. Learned some lessons about the levelness of my oven. Used 2 9 inch pans, baked 60 minutes, plus a dozen cupcakes. Used Lindt Excellence for the cake, and Ghirardelli for the ganache. Will only make again if the crowd will consume it -- I've been eating this for DAYS, and it doesn't dry out. Very tasty.

This is by far the best cake I have ever had, and a show stopper when it comes to a dinner party. While a little time intensive, the fact that you can make is days ahead of time (and even seperate days for the cake and icing) makes it very easy. It even freezes well. I have used different chocolates from high quality to store bought Ghiardelli and it always comes out superb. I find the coffee adds a richness and does not ad a mocha flavor at all. My boyfriend LOVES this cake so I plan on trying it in cupcake form so he can easily transport it to work for a lunchtime snack.

I made this cake last Saturday for my wife to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary (and her 30th birthday - same date). It came out beautifully. I had just served a wonderful seared duck breast with a foie gras and apple relish, I went to the fridge and pulled out the cake to let it come to room temperature while we enjoyed the last of the wine. Soon, I heard a CRASH! - you guessed it, our 8 month old Boxer/Black Lab mix learned that day how to jump up to kitchen counter height! The dog's name is Grace, but we're thinking of changing her name to something a little more fitting, like Crash! Luckily we still had the homemade marscapone gelato I made the day before in the freezer. Needless to say, neither of us got to taste the cake, but I'm giving it 4 forks because it looked wonderful.

I baked this cake following the instructions and taking all tips into consideration and this cake blew 'em away! This cake is definitely a show stopper. My one problem was that once I refrigerated the cake the ganache frosting never softened back to it's original shiny, creamy texture even after coming to room temperature. It hardened like a shell- a very rich and decadent shell- but I'm wondering if there is some way to revive a ganache.

Rating: 4
Oh MY...I paired the cake with the milk chocolate-caramel frosting from Epicurious and it was simply outrageous! This cake is better than any bakery cake I've ever had - it's moist and dense and delish. Very chocolatey, though (not that that's a bad thing) - a small piece is more than enough. There are so many ways you could take this cake - I plan on multiple variations throughout the holiday entertaining season. Topped with a ganache, or served plain with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. . .

Wonderful cake! People are so impressed by it, and it's hatbox straight! I made it (and reviewed it) about 2-1/2 years ago, and I just made it again for my sister-in-law's birthday. It is one beautiful, delicious chocolate cake. Make it often!

We have a family of 4 so I didn't want to make too much cake. Made about 2/3 of the cake recipe for two 9-inch pans. The baking time was cut to 45 minutes. Used the semi-sweet chocolate chips from Trader Joe's-good quality and very inexpensive ($1.50 for 12 ounces). I found out later that Trader Joe's chocolate chips are shipped in a box that is labelled Barry Callebaut! Everybody loved it. It was moist and delicious.

Most of the cakes I make are from Marcel Desaulnier (of "Death by Chocolate" fame). They are rich, complicated, and decadent. I was nervous making such a simple cake for my Rosh Hashanah crowd, but was not at all disappointed. I used Callebaut, 3 9" pans recipe (baked 40 minutes) and 1 1/2 times the ganache recipe. It was wonderful. Must be served at room temperature for perfect ganache consistancy. (And why would anyone who isn't a chocoholic make a chocolate cake with chocolate ganache icing?)

Easily three and a half forks. I made this in a tube pan using Lindt Excellence dark chocolate.

I've made this a number of times, and it truly is oh-my-stars fantastic!! The first couple of times I tinkered with spreading raspberry jam in the middle of the cakes, or with different frostings (white chocolate was particularly good) but have found that the original recipe is the best. There is just something so incredibly wonderful about this cake, despite its being so easy to make.

This cake was absolutely wonderful! I've made it several times and served it with different frostings. I think everyone's favorite is when I make this cake and frost it with Seven Minute frosting...it looks and tastes wonderful. I've found that the cake stores very well so I often make the cake the night before and frost the next day. It has such a deep chocolate flavor and it remains so moist and seems to taste better with age!

This cake is unbelievable. It is a moist rich chocolate heaven, without being too chocolatey, sweet or heavy.

With a few chocolate leaves, it looked very professional, just right for a special occasion.

I made this cake for a birthday party to rave reviews. I did three 9" pans baked 40 minutes -- moist and perfect. I made extra ganache (1-1/2)to compensate for the extra layer and had plenty. I used semi-sweet Valrohna chocolate throughout. This cake was decadent and beautiful. Even those who aren't normally chocolate fans loved this cake. I topped it with a spun sugar wreath with edible flowers -- I will definitely make this again, but absolutely for a crowd -- I had enough extra after serving 20 people to fortify my thighs all week long, nibble by delicious nibble.

This chocolate cake recipe is a super deluxe way to end a dinner party, at your home or as a gift at someone else's. Does it get more decadent than chocolate ganash? This cake was so moist and chocolately, it couldn't have been better. I have a terrible oven that doesn't cook evenly, and these cakes came out perfectly--not even a "crown" to cut off so they would sit up straight. The frosting was a little messy--probably could have used some time in the fridge, but I had guests coming over so I went for it at room temp--just needed a wet paper towel to wipe down the cake platter...Best chocolate I could find was Ghiradelli--and it was fabulous! Highly recommend this relatively easy, super delicious cake.

This was a very delicious chocolate cake. It will be the chocolate cake I make from now on. I think the coffee (which you cannot taste in the cake) really makes the cake, giving it a deeper chocolate flavor not to mention color. You could have the cake without the frosting and just use whipped cream (without sugar) or vanilla ice cream if you do not have the time to make the frosting. I used two 9" x 2 3/8" Paton Calvert flexible (silicone) bakeware pans which are wonderful! No more greasing the pans, just pour the batter in and bake. http://www.patoncalvert.co.uk/brandDisplay.asp?idxBrand=4 My only problem with this recipe was I nearly ran out of frosting. I was hoping to have a thicker layer of frosting but ended up having to be a little thin on the sides and top. Has anyone else had this problem?

Here's the deal - you reeeaallly need to love DENSE, CHOCOLATEY cakes. Overwhelming for myself and a friend. Just too rich. Have a sliver, serve to a big group (preferably 20 + chocoholics), cut the intensity with vanilla ice-cream. But don't go into this thinking that this is a light, or casual, weekend cake. Really a special occasion cake, succeeds as a restaurant quality. We think this comes down to personal preference. Just a warning to those who like lighter desserts Note: LOVE the impact a 10 inch cake has. Really impressive presentation, professional baker appearance. The ganache has a lovely sheen and makes for a beautiful finish.

Love this recipe! I was a little worried because the batter was watery, but it came out great. I'm used a thicker batter. I would cook it a little less than an hour and ten min. I only had 9" cake pans and I made two mini 4" cakes with the leftover batter. I took the recommendation of using the Trader Joe chocolate and it came out yummy. Thanks! High end chocolate does tend to get expensive. Also, to thicken the frosting I put it over a bowl of ice water and stirred every 10 mins for 30 mins and it came out to the perfect consistency and was easy to spread. A definite keeper in my recipe box.

As a cooking teacher and after reading all those reviews, I had to make this cake! Made the cakes (two 9" rounds plus one 6" round, each filled about half way--they all rose beautifully just to the top of the pan) on Thursday evening, filled/frosted on Friday evening, served to guests Saturday afternoon, then had the 6" cake on Sunday afternoon with a fellow cooking teacher. All were moist and delicious! This is a very intensely chocolate cake, almost black in color. I used Valrhona cocoa powder and Ghiraradelli semisweet in the cake and half Callebaut and half Hershey's Special Dark for the frosting. I made no changes to the recipe and it came out perfectly, although I did watch the baking time (can't say exactly how long it took, as I just kept checking it every few minutes after about 40 minutes, but I know it was less than the stated time). I let the cakes cool about 10 minutes in the pans, then removed to a rack to cool completely. If you ever leave the cake in the pan too long and can't get it out, just return it to a warm oven for a few minutes (to soften the fat which has hardened). By the way, I can't stand the taste of coffee but couldn't detect it in the finished cake; however, I know from experience that using it cuts down on the sweetness. A wonderful cake, but a certain style that you have to like (my husband, for instance, much prefers the dense, flourless "decadent" style of chocolate cake). My feeling is that there's room in the culinary world for all of them!

I often read the reviews on the site before trying out any recipes...A lot of helpful suggestions. It seems most people say that, in general, a good brand of chocolate will get the job done. I have used Baker's, Ghiradelli, and Hershey's in the past. Seeing as how I do not live in the U.S., those are the brands I can find the easiest. Any opinions about which of these will work better, or will it turn out pretty much the same with all three? Also, I never found a comment from any "Cook from Detroit" that many reviewers had comments for. Is it possible it got deleted?

For the cook from Seattle: I think you could substitute hot water for the coffee and would still have a delicious cake. When made as written, the cake's flavor is deep, rich and chocolatey rather than mocha, but if you really don't want to use coffee, try substituting water. It's a great cake.

I have made this over and over, in a variety of pans, and have only had rave reviews -- it is now all of my family members' "birthday cake" (my youngest son is getting it this weekend)! One tip: this cake & frosting it is very easy to do if made in a bundt pan; once the cake has cooled I make 1/2 a recipe of the ganache frosting and just pour it over the top. It is also very pretty this way, especially garnished with fresh flowers or mint and berries. Please note, that when using a bundt pan, you will have excess batter (like when using 9 inch pans) but the cooking time is not much longer than when using multiple pans (approx. 15 - 20 minutes).

This IS the best recipe website, hands down. I really don't think many cookbooks compare to the edgy and awesome recipes here at Epicurious; have been coming here for a few years now and I know for a fact that my cooking has improved. Many of the recipes at this website are restaurant quality, this cake being at the top of the list, to me!

Do you people have cookbooks or ever try other recipe web sites? This cake was okay, but not the best. Maybe you are just not used to fabulous cakes. Hmm?

I am a pastry chef and this is my signature chocolate cake receipe.I have only ever had rave reviews for the outcome.I love this receipe because it very versatile and can be tweaked for variety.The Ganache is one of the best I have ever made.As to a readers comments about the cake being overly sweet....I dont know how she got this result......the cake is definetly not sweet but rich and a chocolate heaven.Maybe her chocolate was the problem....I suggest Callebut.

This cake was quite good. The color is a really nice dark brown. The one change I'd make is to take out some sugar, it was a little too sweet. In fact, when I made it last night I cut out a half cup of sugar and it was still too sugary. Next time I will replace half of the semi-sweet chocolate in the glaze with unsweetened, and all of the chocolate in the cake with unsweetened. Chocolatey goodness. Yum.

I used Hershey Special Dark (get the big bars in the candy aisle) and it's fabulous. Cook's illustrated rated it one of the best chocolates for baking, and it's a lot cheaper than other brands.

In a word, PERFECTION!!!!! I will never make another chocolate cake. This cake is moist and fluffy. I have always hated chocolate cake. They are always so dry and lack depth of flavor. I recommend a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream alongside. I promise, if you follow the directions, you will not be disappointed.

Couldn't find the semi-sweet Callebaut so I used the bittersweet. I agree that the coffee is undiscernible, and I used strong Starbucks French roast. I also used Pernigotti cocoa which drove the cost of the cake sky high but it was worth it. The results were outstanding. I made the night before an event, and I had some left over that was still great 4 days later. This is a keeper.

Hands down, the best chocolate cake recipe. Made this for the third time as well and received nothing but sincere compliments from friends. Many went back for a huge second helping. I find that using chopped chocolate works best (I used Ghiradelli semisweet). I've tried chocolate chips and found that it just does not turn out as well. Check the cake at 50 minutes---70 minutes is too long and the result will be a dry cake. It's a very moist and delicate cake, so frosting it may be difficult. I semi-froze my cakes (wrapped each in saran wrap), then frosted them. I only use 10 inch pans---end result is a fabulously huge cake. Great recipe!

I have made this three times as well and I will look no further for a chocolate cake recipe. Both times I have used dutch-process chocolate and it turned out fine. Used two nine inch pans and had enough left over for several cupcakes. Made the ganache as directed the first time, which was wonderful. Another time I was running late and used ghiradelli semisweet chips rather than chopping another type of chocolate and it was still amazing and a really effective short cut. Wonderful recipe.

I made this wonderful cake yesterday for just 4 people and cut the cake recipe by half and the ganache frosting by 3/4. It was just the right size for 2 8 inch Wilton cake pans and the finished cake was delicious and beautiful. I used two medium eggs in the cake. If you try this, start checking for doneness after about 35 minutes as it took alot less time to bake. There was still alot of cake left. I really tbink this is the best chocolate cake recipe out there.

Rating: 4
This recipe received rave reviews and was called "better than the best chocolate cake I've ever had in a fine restaurant". I used a darker cocoa (not dutch-processed) and the cake was really black so I whipped the ganache to lighten the color for more contrast and to make it more spreadable. I also baked it in 2-9 in. pans (3 in. deep) because my oven is too small for 2-10 in. pans. I torted the layers to make 4 instead of 2 because they were thicker. I've been begged to bake it again...soon!

This cake is terrific - I've made it three times. The first time, I made the layers as written and used a cream cheese icing - it was delicious, but perhaps a little sweet. I love sweet desserts, and almost never reduce the sugar in a recipe, but the last two times I made this (including last week for my son's birthday) I cut a FULL CUP of sugar from the recipe, and used a regular buttercream icing. It was still terrific, though I felt not quite as moist as with the full complement of sugar. I think next time I would make this with two cups plus three tablespoons of sugar. Also, I have never made the ganache - if it's not too sweet, perhaps three cups of sugar in the batter makes sense. Anyway, a really yummy cake. I too have been looking for a good chocolate cake recipe - they are usually either too dry or too fudgy or not chocolaty enough. This one rises high, is really chocolaty, but is still a cake, not a candy or brownie like some you find. I think the buttermilk makes a huge difference in the height of the cake. By the way, the birthday rendition was in a 9 by 13 pan - worked just fine. This recipe is a major keeper - my search is over. - Regards.

This cake was moist and delicious! Didn't want to make such a huge cake so I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch springform pan...ended up with extra batter to fill two ramekins. Baked for 50 minutes. I also did not bother with the frosting; served the cake with fresh whipped cream and it was perfect. My husband had two slices in one sitting!

Stellar chocolate cake!!!! This cake is better than I've had at upscale restaurants! I accidentally left the layers out after baking late into the night, and the cake remained very moist. We served it with a scoop of Ben and Jerry's Coffee Toffee Crunch on the side, and a drizzle of caramel sauce. I have now retired all my chocolate cake recipes.

This is a great chocolate cake. Very rich, moist, and very chocolatey. You could easily make the cake and use another frosting, like coconut, or use the frosting for a different cake, like a white cake, if you want it less chocolatey. But I made this for my friends c going-away party and got rave reviews. I actually made two cakes as I had over 20 people, and I had an entire cake plus 1/3 left over. You can cut very thin slices and it's enough because it's so rich. I also had frosting left over which I used for cupcakes for my daughter. Definitely a winner and not difficult.

This is truly the best chocolate cake i've ever had and chocolate cake is by far my favorite dessert. This cake is moist and dense and just plain fabulous. I made the cake exactly as described with one small change: i cut each of the two layers in half horizontally and spread with fresh whipped cream then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. OUTSTANDING. I will never make another choclate again. This is the one, the only, perfect recipe!! I made it for my coworkers and received RAVE reviews.

Made the cake only (used frosting from white chocolate truffle cake recipe on this website). It's wonderful. Dark and rich, soft and airy at the same time. Makes three 9-inch layers (reduce baking time by 10 minutes). Relatively easy too... Wowed them at an office birthday party!

WOW! An outstanding recipe that made everyone sigh. My changes -- I used 3 8 inch pans (and even had a little bit of batter for a few cupcakes). My "celebration" cake consisted of 2 layers, with a thin layer of raspberry puree and a layer of ganache between the two. Then I used raspberries, mint, and dusted powdered sugar as garnish. With the remaining layer, I sliced it horizontally, spread only w/ a layer of the raspberries, then iced w/ the ganache. The thin cake went to work and disappeared in less than 1/2 hour. Outstanding!

I used the cake part of this recipe and baked it in little "Bundtlette" pans. They bake for about 23 minutes, you can make 18 1 cup cakes from this batter. I then drizzled them with Ganache. I like the individual cakes even more than the layer cake. The cake is moist and rich a very chocolatey. Perfect cake batter.

Whenever I need a classic, rich chocolate layer cake, this will be the recipe I go to. My changes: I used dry buttermilk powder and bittersweet chocolate because that's what I could find. The result was a super-moist, dense, rich, chocolately cake. You don't taste the coffee at all and I used a very strong blend. I made the cake and frosting the day before I needed them and did not refrigerate either overnight. I had no problems with dryness or the frosting being too hard - it was the perfect spreading consistency. If you have always been disappointed by the lack of chocolate flavour and dryness of chocolate cakes in the past, this is the recipe that will cure those chocolate cake woes forever.

This is a wonderful, old fashioned, moist, coarse textured Devil's Food cake. I made it as a three-layer (9 inch)cake for a niece's 19th birthday. I used bittersweet (rather than semisweet) chocolate and put a layer of fresh raspberries between the layers, piled more on top of the iced cake, and decorated the plate with raspberries and fresh flowers. Rather than waiting for the icing to cool enough to spread, I put the cake on a cardboard round, placed it on a wire rack, and poured the icing over the cake. (I used two coats, and stuck the cake in the fridge to firm up between coats.) To insure I had enough icing, I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe.

Incredible cake! I've made it probably a dozen times in the last year.....my family LOVES chocolate and agrees this is the ultimate chocolate cake! Nothing compares anymore. I prefer to use dutch process cocoa, but that's the only substitute I make for this cake. Incidently, I always end up with more ganache than I need, so recently I made more of it than necessary and rolled the extra chilled ganache into truffles. I lined the edge of the cake with these cocoa dusted truffles......the effect was exquisite. The height of this cake makes it look like it came from my favorite bakery.

Rating: 4
Amazing - true, the ganache's thickness makes slicing the cake a bit delicate but it's so delicious I would never use a different icing. Actually the ganache was what received the most rave reviews from my audience, although I personally thought the cake layers were absolutely perfect. Also the last piece, which I ate several days after baking the layers, was still moist, fresh-tasting and terrific.

I have been looking for years for a good chocolate layer cake and icing, this cake certainly is a keeper. The chocolate taste was incredible and the recipe fairly simple to prepare. I made the mistake of starting prep on the same day I needed the cake and did not have a lot of time for the cake to cool. Definitely try to make at least the layers ahead of time. I used two 8" pans and filled a muffin tray with the rest of the batter. When I make this cake again, I will invest in some larger cake pans.

Rating: 4
This is a great cake! Without a doubt one of the best I have ever made or eaten. I haven't tried the Hershey cake but plan to in the future. If it is even half as good as this one it would be well worth the effort. I used an even amount of both semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate by Ghiradelli. It was fabulous. Plan to make it again and again. I used 9" cake pans and had enough batter left over for 12 cupcakes. This cake was worth the money for the chocolate and the effort. Try it!

by far the best chocolate cake ever! i actually made it with a peanut butter frosting (cream together 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 8 oz package cream cheese, mix in 4 cups conf. sugar and 1 tablespoon milk) last night -- and it was amazing. the ganache can be a bit much -- but this peanut butter chocolate combination was great.

I've made this cake five or six times and it is absolutely delicious--and fool proof. my only complaint is that the ganache frosting (which tends to be very thick) is a poor match for such a tender cake. You have to use pressure to cut through the icing when slicing, and it tends to mangle the cake a little. The last time I made it I used the milk chocolate frosting on this site (it is under the chocolate crunch cake) and it was a fabulous counterpart. I even sprinkled heath bits on top of the frosting in the middle and on top. Wow! Awesome.

I made this for a work function and for my family, and everyone loved it. At work, they didn't stop talking about it for weeks! You really couldn't taste the coffee (even those who don't like coffee didn't notice the taste) and the cake is moist and delicious. Leaving the frosting a bit cool results in a dense, fudgy topping, although I had some trouble spreading the thick frosting without damaging the layers.

This is by far the best cake i have had in a while. I put the corn syrup in the batter instead of the vegtable oil (and added a few tablespoons of the oil) and it tasted just fine. heres a little tip: don't put the frosting in the freezer overnight-it will be rock hard.

For a quick cake with a similar flavor try this: 1 NON-pudding-in-the-mix chocolate fudge cake mix, 3 eggs, 1 1/3 c. buttermilk, 3 TB Cocoa powder, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 c. oil. Mix on low 1 minute, then on medium 2 minutes. Bake the same amount of time as cake mix directions. I've made this both ways, it's almost the same! For the freezing question - I decorated cakes for years and almost always froze the cake layers ahead of time. It also makes leveling and frosting a breeze!

I've made this cake several times. The last time, I sliced half of it for my son to take back to college. I wrapped the slices individually and put them in gallon freezer bags. He likes it best microwaved just till the ganache melts then tops it w/ vanilla ice cream. Can't beat that for "homemade" hot fudge cake! It also freezes well - either with or w/out the frosting.

Delicious chocolate cake. I made this cake in a 3-D cake mold and it turned out really well -- dense enough to stand up but incredibly moist. Also held up great -- baked on Friday but not served until Sunday (stored at room temp), and didn't dry out one bit. The coffee flavor was evident in the batter, but barely detectable in the finished product (and I used very strong coffee). Also I used bittersweet choc instead of semi-sweet, per an earlier reviewer, and I frosted with buttercream frosting instead of the ganache. I've made lots of different cakes for my 3-D molds and am often disappointed in the dryness (due in part to extra baking time usually required) but this cake was fantastic! Will definitely make it again!

Great chocolate cake! I use this as the base for every chocolate cake I make. Try it with German Chocolate pecan filling, or mocha icing, or peanut butter frosting! It is always a hit. I think the coffee helps kick up thecolor and flavor of the chocolate. P.S. vary the strength of the coffee or the chocolate for different flavors.

I've baked this cake a few times a year since 1999, and I think the coffee taste is negligible--not noticable at all. It's really more for moistness than for a specific coffee taste. This cake is so wonderful, I can't even describe it. It's easy to make, though, so try it for yourself. Heed baking times and temp!

This cake is delicious if you like coffe with your chocolate. We are not coffee drinkers so, the coffee after taste was too strong for me and my gang. The cake was very moist and had a great texture. I will probably try this cake again without the coffee. If you enjoy coffee I bet this cake if for you.

This is one of the best chocolate cakes I've made. At first I thought the batter was too soupy, but was amazed at how it turned out. Very moist, rich and simply delicious. I couldn't find Callebaut so I used Ghirardelli. I also didn't have enough chocolate on hand, so I had to settle for the Cocoa frosting recipe that went with the the Old-fashioned Chocolate cake on the same site, except that I used only 4 cups of powdered sugar. It turned out great! It was even better the next day. Will definitely make it again and again, but will also try it with the ganache frosting. Thanks for this wonderful recipe...

I made this cake a year ago, and I made it again two nights ago (frosted it and put it together last night). I can't believe I forgot how incredible this cake is! I made three 8 inch layers (I like tall cakes for birthdays) and baked it for 45-50 minutes. It is so moist- I am sitting here eating a piece that was baked two days ago and it tastes incredibly fresh. Whenever anyone makes a request for chocolate cake, this is the one I will make. And the recipe is surprisingly simple for such a good cake- I have made a lot of cakes that were more labor intensive without the cakes being as exquisite as this one! Also, I used Baker's Joy spray and eliminated the need for parchment. And Ghiradhelli semi-sweet chips worked fine.

Very nice taste, nice height and texture. Only thing -- watch baking time very carefully. I did two 9 inch pans, plus some individuals for 50 minutes and that was too long. We like a very moist cake, next time I'd check at 40-45 minutes. Don't know what it would turn out like if you baked it an hour. Heard some people used a different frosting, I wouldn't. If you use good chocolate, this ganache is the best.

A nice chocloatee, moist cake. Nice crumb. I only had Dutch processed cocao on hand and powdered buttermilk, but that wasn't too bad (dutched cocoa is just a little less chocolatee; as for the powdered buttermilk, better to use the real stuff but if you do use powdered, sift it with the dry ingredients and add the water to the egg mixture). Didn't make the icing - 1lb of choc is a bit much! It's not the best chocolate cake I've ever had, and it did require quite a bit of effort but it was good and I'll try it again.

I only have access to alkali processed cocoa powder and I really think that may have made a difference in the height of the cake layers. The taste was quite good but definitely would have been better if I'd made it a day in advance. I think that next time - and there will be a next time - I will have to try the advice of the reviewer who suggested altering the amount of leveners used for Dutch-processed cocoa.

After reading the rave reviews, I decided to make this cake as a Valentine's Day surprise for my chocolate-loving husband. I wanted to do right, so I bought two 10" round pans and followed the directions for the cake exactly. The flavors were great! (used Guittard chocolate chips from the local supermarket)... but the cake came out a little drier than I would have hoped. I baked the two rounds for exactly 60 minutes and I have a reliable oven thermometor, so I know it was right at 300 degrees. I would suggest checking for done-ness at around 45-50 minutes. Also, I put the ganache in the refridgerator for 2 hours then whipped it for more volume (no shine, but easier to spread). This cake is huge!! I look forward to taking it to a dinner party tomorrow (minus the two slices we had tonight) and testing the theory that the cake is better the next day. Great cake. Would make again... but watch that baking time!

This cake is the best. I use Valrhona Guanaja chocolate and Valrhona cocoa, reduce the amount of sugar to about 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 cups, and increase the cocoa correspondingly.

I have made this cake recipe over and over again (in 2 9-inch cake pans for 20 minutes - plus 10 cupcakes with the left over batter) with consistently wonderful results. Because it is a favorite among family and friends, I have finally invested in 2 10-inch pans for my next go 'round! I have always frosted the cake with milk chocolate frosting (recipe on this site - "chocolate crunch layer cake with milk chocolate frosting") which is a lighter compliment to the somewhat rich cake. For my in-laws anniversary I'm going to try a coffee-chocolate frosting...yum!

Thanks to all the great tips the cake was wonderful. To add my ideas- I used 2 9" Calphalon pans, which are very deep. ALL the batter fit! I used dark chocolate in the cake instead of semisweet.

This is an easy and fantastic recipe. I used smaller pans and had enough batter left for a 2nd 1-layer cake.

This is my first time making this cake - I normally use the Hershey's recipe. Choosing between this cake and the Hershey's cake is like choosing between my brother or my sister - I refuse to make that choice as they are both so wonderful. That said, I do think this recipe seems a bit more sophisticated - maybe because of the ganache. My aunt, who is a chocoholic, was very excited when she saw that I had made a chocolate cake. She assumed that it was the Hershey's. I told her it was not, handed her a piece, and asked for her expert opinion. For those of you who are looking for the ultimate in chocolate, she said that the ganache from this recipe paired with the cake from Hershey's would be the a chocoholics dream.

With any luck,I will get an answer here. My hubby is a fan of the Hershey cake, and I think I can pull the old switcheroo on him with this recipe,unlike others from the site that were too dense for his taste. The last time I made a ganache..he liked the flavor but said it was way too rich for him. ANy idea as how to make the ganache the start of a great chocolate icing? I experiment often, but find myself hesitant when it comes to baked goods. Any help would be greatly appreciated by this enthusuastic home cook. Thanks

I first made this cake as my brother's wedding cake, and three years later, people still talk about it and ask for it! I have typically used Lindt semi-sweet chocolate but after experimentation have found the bittersweet to be more popular. I make this cake whenever someone tells me they're a chocolate lover and I have yet to meet someone who didn't love it. I use 2 inch deep pans and never fill them past half way, so never had a problem with them overflowing. The ganache definitely has to be left to cool in order to be spreadable rather then pourable, but its so rich, it goes a long way if you crumb coat, cool and then finish icing.

This cake is so fantastic. I have never met a person who didn't like it. I am sure they exist but after reading all the reviews, I think it is only one person; a Hershey's employee who signs different names to many reviews! All these comments (good or bad) keep this recipe in the constant comment, so keep them up, then more people will try this cake and the world will be a better place!

I had fun reading everyone's solutions to the 10 inch cake pan dilemma. Here's my version. I have 9 inch pans, and not wanting the batter to overflow during cooking as I saw in other reviews, I used three 9 inch pans. Now I had three layers and wasn't sure there would be enough ganache. So, I whipped the leftover whipping cream from the pint I bought, and added it to 3/4 of the ganache making a chocolate whipped cream frosting for between the layers and put the pure ganache only on the top. It worked well, although, with three heavy layers, the cake wanted to shift. If I were to make it again, I would ice the first two layers, then refrigerate so it could set, then add the top layer and ganache and refrigerate again. Of course, you could also just make additional ganache and be true to the recipe. :-) Highly recommend this recipe though!

I was ready to begin baking and I got to the cocoa. I realized that this was the one ingredient that I forgot and it was 10PM. Everything was closed except the local 7-11. They had Nesquik but no cocoa. Cocoa was the second ingredient on the package so I gave it a try :-) With semi-sweet Bakers chocolate and Nesquik it turned out great! I did have to cool the icing in the fridge, as it was quite runny otherwise.

I made this cake as instructed for my friend's birthday and found it just so-so. I used Ghiradelli's chocolate and overall was disappointed in the results. I will keep looking for another recipe.

This cake was awesome. I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. He put one of the layers in the freezer and is still eating it three months later! Definitely try this one.

My husband and I have been on a quest for the perfect chocolate cake for years. This is a great cake. This is a truly moist, delicious cake. The ganache is wonderful also, but perhaps a bit rich for my personal taste, so next time I will try it with my favorite chocolate frosting and decide which is better. I left the ganache to chill before spreading, so it spead more like a frosting, less ganache like. This wouldn't change the flavor, but it was a bit less messy i'm sure. I think with my frosting...I may have finally found the perfect chocolate cake!! :)

We made this cake and can only comment on what we actually baked, not what ended up on the floor of the oven. Unlike the rest of you who were smart enough to use the proper pans...we used two 8 inch pans . What a mess! We were, however, able to salvage them and they are great. Next time, we will do what several others did and use THREE 8 inch pans!!!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used. I made three 9 inch layers since I didn't have ten inch pans. They rose nicely and made a tall cake. I did make a mistake with the ganache because I was trying to make a little more for the third layer. It didn't harden enough to spread so I added confectioner's sugar until it did. I know it was no longer a ganache, but it was a great chocolate frosting.

What can you say?? It's perfection: it is THE chocolate cake recipe - I won't be using another one unless I'm looking for something other than a moist, rich, not-too-sweet perfect chocolate cake. The best part is that it's so easy - I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate but next time I'm using Callebaut or Valrhona, though I can't believe it could be better... (could I gush anymore??) Stop reading and make this cake!

Good grief, Detroit, enough is enough! You've typed the same snotty review at least a couple of times now. While your opinion is certainly welcomed--once-- you need to understand that not everyone will share it. If that bothers you, too bad. And I didn't find anything grammatically wrong with NYC's review, other than one typo. Ever heard of those? Perhaps those of us who liked this recipe possess a lower intelligence quotient? Now that I've said my piece, on to the important stuff: this cake was incredible. I won't hesitate to make it again. It was moist, tender and delicious.

I have to question why the cook from Detroit seems so angry. It's just a recipe, "dear". Anyway, this cake was unbelievable. It makes a HUGE dessert, though, so make sure you're feeding a crowd with good appetites! Served with unsweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries garnished with a leaf or two of mint. It certainly made a big impression!

Just a great recipe. I usually make one large single layer cake and several in 4 inch spring form pans. As my guests leave, I give them out. Sometimes, so I'm told, they make it all the way home. Also, I usually drizzle individual servings with a raspberry sauce, but the new favorite is a white chocolat (Lindt preferred)and cognac sauce. Melt the white chocolat in some very warm heavy cream to which about a jigger or two of good cognac has been added. A teaspoon of simple syrup or light corn syrup helps to keep it fluid. One friend would swap the cake for a cup of the white sauce. Keep up the good work.

Wonderful! I served this at my husband's grandfather's 80th birthday party to 50 guests (made more than one cake, obviously) and received plenty of ooohs and aahhs. Will make again for sure. I have a feeling it'll become my signature dessert...

this is my favorite chocolate cake recipe, just for the cake alone. i've used it repeatedly with great success - once with white chocolate icing, and several times with whipped cream and mixed berries. using good quality cocoa does make a difference if you want really intense chocolate flavor - valrhona is my favorite

Rating: 4
Excellent chocolate cake recipe. Having made it many times, here's what I have learnt. First, don't use cake flour - this is a recipe for a dense, moist cake and not a fluffy one. Second, you can use dutch process cocoa. Examples include cocoa barry (preferred) and most other imported cocoa. I disagree with a previous reviewer who calculated the required increase in leavening agents. Don't increase them. Just use dutch process cocoa and leave all other quanitities the same. The weakest part of the recipe is the ganache. If you absolutely must use a ganache, then do it the Cordon Bleu way. 1/2 heavy cream and one tablespoon light corn syrup heated and then added slowly, with stirring, to a bowl containing approximately 1 cup chopped chocolate (e.g. Callebaut or Belcolade) of the highest quality you can find. See http://www.cooking.com/recipes/static/recipe1822.htm Personally, I prefer the mousse frosting recipe that got rave reviews on this site. See http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=102230 and the sugar syrup is often a good idea. Finally, we taste with our eyes (French saying) so decorate your cake in the following manner: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105184 and click on the picture icon. One last thing (and I know I'll get yelled at for this) this recipe halves fine and you can actually mix all the wet ingredients in a blender and, space permiting, add the dry mix in their too and stir very much without problems. The "just combined well" part of this recipe applies to many cakes, but not this one.

Outstanding! Hershey's? Don't think so! Perhaps those commending that recipe are guilty of remembering how mom used to make it, and building it up in their minds. As it is, I don't see how any sane person could give this cake less than four forks. Yes, I know we all have different tastes, but come on! Even if you don't like chocolate cake, four forks means a dish beyond compare-- as in, I've found no chocolate cake that tastes better. This one is IT!!!

I was impressed with the taste and rich flavor. Felt the time paid off. What's not to like with the buttermilk, eggs, sugar, etc.? Made it in 3 9inch pans, and decreased the baking time. Very moist. A neighbor got a piece and reported it to be the best cake she had ever eaten. found the frosting be easy to use after refrig. I will make again! Happy in Milwaukee

This is the 5th time I made this cake. Once with recomended Chocolate, 3 times with Hersheys. All Good. 5th was the best! 4 - Six Inch Layers, made 2 cakes using the icing and rolled fondat from the wedding cake recipe from epicurious(cut the icing and fondat by 4)Colored Fondant and flowers Austin Powers, 60's, groovy style. Outstanding presentation and perfect flavors!

Urp. Not so hot. I agree with the reviewer who states the back-of-cocoa Hershey's recipe is better, down to the frosting. Next time I will make that one, because whenever I do, I get asked for the recipe, and I can say "check the back of your cocoa." Plus, I don't have to go to the store for that cake.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday party and my guests all loved it! Even the ones that don't normally like chocolate cake. I made it into a triple layer cake using 9 inch pans and baked for 45 minutes. I put fresh strawberries with some strawberry jam between the layers and decorated the top with strawberries. The strawberries were a nice contrast to the richness of the chocolate and kept it from being too sweet. It was a big hit, so I definitely will make it again!

Dull and boring? Not the way I made it! This cake fed 16 people-- everyone from die-hard chocoholics, to people who claimed not to care for cake at all. Everyone raved. My sister, who works at a wonderful restaurant in town as a pastry chef, even took the recipe home. I'm sorry, but Hershey's could never compare. Make this now, and by no means omit the ganache. It totally puts this cake over the top!

I agree with the reviewer from the South down below.... the Hershey's cake on the back of the cocoa is much better than this cake. Maybe it's the boiling water that you have to add, but I will not stray again. Hershey's is the best! People may feel a recipe from Hershey's is not up to par or good enough to serve, but the recipe has been around for many years and is tried and true. In comparison, this cake was dull and boring.

for a recent b'day party i made 2 cakes - this was the chocolate one - and there were not even crumbs left! chocoholics SWOONED for this cake and it was very very easy - it was a very hot day in the deep south the day i did the icing so i had to chill it longer than usual, but when i iced the cake i chilled it until time to take to the party and it was perfect!

My daughter made this for my birthday cake last week and we all thought it was superb -- densely chocolate cake with a ganache frosting. She used Hershey cocoa and Baker's chocolate too. It was very moist to start with and the flavor even improved as the week went by. My preference was to keep it refridgerated and serve cold.

Gosh I just don't know why ya'll think this cake is so great. It came out as I am sure it should have; i used high quality chocolate, etc. but it just wasn't that great. I have a friend who is a cake maker and he was at two birthdays that I prepared different cakes for - he said that considering all the trouble this one was not so great. The other one took a fraction of the time, was about a fourth of the cost used one bowl and and was really great! It was the cake that is on the back of the hershey's cocoa box. I keep making that one and every time i make it I get ravinf reviews. This cake is dense and doesn't keep well. I suppose it's a great cake if you really like dense cakes. It wasn't even that chocolatey either. Oh well, glad ya'll liked it tho. Happy cooking! Oh - ya'll ought to just humor me and TRY the hershey's cake - it really is good and easy.

This is fabulous cake - moist, excellent texture, rich chocolate flavor. The icing is bowl licking good. I was not able to find gourmet chocolate, so I used Hershey's Cocoa, Baker's Semi-Sweet Chocolate, and Nestle's Toll House Chocolate Morsels. They all worked perfectly. The recipe steps flowed smoothly and I was able to put it all together easily. Leave enough time for the icing to cool before putting it on the cake. I also didn't have the right size pans, but the three 8" cake layers came out fine - I just watched the time. Bravo to the chef who devised this recipe!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried, and I'm a chocoholic! I've made this cake four times now, and each received rave reviews. Another yummy variation is to put a layer of high quality preserves (raspberry or apricot) between the layers and frost the top and sides.

A fabulously easy cake: doubles well (I made 2x8 inch pans for a layer cake and 30 cupcakes with a square of white chocolate suspended in the batter)with some tweaking of baking times. Didn't use the ganache, but a sourcream frosting instead (lighter).Thanks epicurious!

Everytime i make this cake, i get requests from other people for it. It's very moist, but I personally find the frosting too heavy for such a rich cake. To add an interesting twist, when making this cake for a Reese's fan, i used the Peanut butter filling from: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=2867 doubled it and put it between the layers, then i halved the frosting and put it on the top, letting it drip down the sides so that the filling could be seen, and i put a ring of chopped nuts around the top as garnish

I made this for the 4th of July family BBQ and it was gone before I got any! So I made it again, and (after actually eating some) have to agree with the reviewers who thought the glaze was a bit much. So (to use up the rest of the buttermilk!) I made it again, topped with simple vanilla ice cream- fantastic!

I am not an extemely experience baker and this recipe turned out fabulously! Additions/Changes I made: 3 9inch layers--one a little thinner and added some almond extract. I filled and topped it with a loganberry glaze and cocoa whip cream, and toasted sliced almonds. The ganache I found too heavy so I lightened it a bit(a little more whip cream blended in) spread it around the sides.

This is just the best. Years of looking for the best chocolate cake; here it is. I've made maybe 30 or so; I sell them to friends or give for birthdays. My only addition to ingredients is to add the finely grated (then chopped) rind of two oranges. I make this a 3-layer cake by pouring 2/3 of batter in one pan, 1/3 in the other, and leave the heavier pan in oven a bit longer. Then, when it's cooled overnight (tastes so much better on day 2) and just slice the larger one to get my 3 layers. Then I spread a thin layer of seedless blackberry jam on the bottom 2 layers. My usual icing is whipped ganache, whipping it with extra cream, then masking the sides of cake with lightly toasted pecan or walnut bits, then pipe sweetened whipped cream flavored with a little Godiva chocolate liquer on top. Teeny dots of raspberry jam get piped w/paper cone onto the top of each whipped cream rosette. This cake gets so many compliments it's amazing. Fantastic recipe!!

Rating: 4
This cake is amazing! Dark, rich and extremely delicious. I baked the batter in two 8" pans for a birthday party. Of course I had batter left over, which I baked in a muffin tin, making individual cakes which I wrapped and put in the freezer. (They freeze very well, by the way) A week later I thawed them, coated them with fresh ganache and served them at a small dinner party. It was so easy and my guests were VERY impressed.

Just a note to the Vancouver cook (baker). Whenever you alter a recipe (e.g. use a springform pan instead of layers) the cake will be significantly altered. I know, because I've done this, and you need to allow for the extra baking time needed for the center, and the risk of the edges burning. I have yet to make this entire recipe, thus no rating, but the cake itself is wonderful!

Ditto the comment 2 reviews ago - it's the perfect chocolate cake! Not sure what the last reviewer was talking about. I used one recipe for a 12" and 6" (made a 3-tiered wedding cake) and only baked them for 50 min. Everything about this cake is WONDERFUL - and I've never been that wild about pure chocolate cakes. Will make this again and again and again and...

i used the biggest springform pan available as i did not feel like making a 2 layer cake. first of all, it took forever to bake (just over one and 1/2 hours) and i think it's because the temp. of the oven was too low (300 degrees). i've never come across a cake recipe which calls for the oven to be set at 300 , most are usually set at 350 degrees anyway, one the cake was done, it was very moist, almost wet and very fudge like, which was alright, but i was hoping for a more lighter-textured cake. and i was missing the butter flavour in the cake (it was after all made without the use of butter). i probably will make it again but with some modifications as i found a similar chocolate cake recipe but using butter instead of oil.

I've made this recipe several times. Quite easy. Despite the call for superior quality chocolate, I have used semi-sweet chips (store brand, too) for ganache and also for cake - with great results. I usually subsitute soured milk (using fat free half and half with lemon juice) for the buttermilk. And... it makes such a big cake that I find a half recipe is perfect for six. It's not quite as pretty, but the single level slices are still pretty tall and plenty rich enough.

Hands down, the best ganache recipe ever. The cake caused me some problems, but I'm wondering if it was me and not the recipe since everyone else raved about it. The recipe made far too much batter for my 9" cake pans and I filled them up pretty high thinking that it wasn't going to rise much. As it turned out, the batter overflowed all over the inside of my oven. Not a pretty sight! (Or smell!) I had a spare mix in the cupboard so made that as a replacement and went ahead with preparation of the frosting. As I said, the best ever!!! It made an ordinary boxed cake something very special!

Rating: 3
I thought the cake part was wonderful - moist, fluffy, chocolatey. I thought the ganache, however, was too much for this cake. It made the whole thing too heavy, and I noticed at my party last night that several guests ate the cake part but left the ganache untouched. Also, when the ganache hardened on the cake, I found it quite difficult to slice without destroying the fragile cake inside. Since the cake is so good, I next time I would do it justice by giving it a frosting that complements it, like buttercream or even cream cheese frosting (with raspberry preserves - yum!). Btw, lacking 10" cake pans, I baked it in two batches in my (approx.) 9" springform pan. Each layer took about an hour, and boy was it tall!

Rating: 4
Everything a chocolate cake should be........dense,rich, moist and most of all delicious. I made the cake as written but added a layer of cherry jam in the middle. I used two 10" springform pans. I chilled 1/3 of the frosting beating it for a thicker consistancy for the filling and spread the remainder for a shiny glaze on the outside. The cake turned out large and beautiful.

I made 2 of these cakes in 2 days for birthday parties. The 1st one came out fabulous and everyone raved. The second one was nothing great but I am not sure why. I was a tiny bit short on the cocoa (and I mean a tiny bit) but I just added a little extra flour. Could that make that big of a deal? Anyway, based on the first one I will definitely make this again. All I can say is WOW! What a cake!

A very nice, straightforward chocolate cake. I made it in three 8" pans, baked about 45 minutes, which worked just fine. Frosting pipes well if you do it in small batches so that the heat from your hand doesn't melt it. There was just enough frosting to make small stars over the entire cake -- an impressive display on a tall cake, but a little difficult to slice.

Super recipe; I did not have any problem getting the cake out of the pans in one piece, and all I did was follow the directions. My whole family loved it, and some don't care for cake. It lasted for four days in the fridge, and it was just as good day four as day one. Gourmet, indeed!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and it got rave reviews from all. Decorated it with chocolate leaves and brushed them with gold-dust from a cake decorating store... It was recommended to me that I get a pair of cotton gloves to help with the leaves (warm hands) and they were great! My problem was that my cakes (in the specified 10" pans) ran over in the oven and then were a nightmare to get out of the pans because of the cracked rim area due to the run-over. I had to cut the cake down (didn't anyone hear a scream!)I am an experienced cook and know not to "pack" my flour when measuring so I wonder if anyone else had this problem too. It was also touch-and-go putting one layer on top of the other because they are so dense. If I'd used 3 cake pans, it would have been the perfect amount! The cake was delicious. Dense but not too sweet.

I made this the other night..and it was very good...im always worried when I make cake..(especially chocolate) that it will be dry..but it wasnt...I did however cut back on the cooking time.. partially due to a mistake I had the oven set to 350 for about 5 min before I realized it was to high... then I lowered it to 300 and cooked it for 45 min..and it was perfectly done...I highly recommend this recipe

This is just excellent, but a word of warning regarding the ganache: once you've finished preparing it, take out just enough to fill in between both layers and quickly refrigerate it. Then it will be spreadable (it's really runny just off the stove), and you'll still be able to put the remainder over the top for shiny results!

I made this recipe as a present for my office. changed the ganache and used a caramel pastry cream as filling instead and frosted the whole thing with white chocolate buttercream and fresh raspberries.

This is a good chocolate cake, moist, chocolaty, everything you except from a chocolate cake. BUT, it's not aswsome...maybe I'm too picky, but I want more than just good cake.

I took this cake to a dinner party, and it stole the show! The cake has nice texture, is wonderfully moist, and best of all - it has incredible flavor without being sickeningly sweet or rich. I ended up whipping the frosting in order to increase the volume, so it didn't have the nice shiny gloss of a traditional ganache, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I garnished with fresh raspberries and strawberries, which ended up being a perfect complement. Will definitely make again.

A great, rich, dark, and dense chocolate cake. A couple of recommendations: 1) dont overcook it! I found 1 hour 10 minutes to be too much. 2) Use a good quality chocolate! The flavor and quality of the cocoa and chocolate used will definitley be obvious in the final result. 3) Slice a thin top off of the bottom layer to even it up and make it flat. I also sliced off the bottom 1/16 inch of the top layer to get rid of the slightly crusty bottom. 4) The cake is a little dense and mine came out a little dry. Some of the other reviewers have complained of dryness as well. Consider serving it with a raspberry sauce for addition moisture. 5) The rich chocolate ganache is perfect for a chocoholic. However, the cake can stand on its own with another, lighter icing or even with simple powered sugar if needed. 6) This cake is dense enough and big enough to serve 20 if needed.

Fabulous cake, but I had the same problem as another reviewer with the frosting getting too hard in the refrigerator, and then cutting it was a major problem - the frosting cracked into many pieces. Next time I would cut the slices before chilling, or more likely not chill it at all.

A deep, dark, enormous, delicious cake! Amazing, too, because I had to convert to metric measurements, and make substitutions: used cake flour, and most imortant, because all our cocoa powders are Dutch process, I could not use baking soda so had to work out the baking powder equivalent (5 teasp) and used 1/2 t baking soda. AND I made a mistake and used only 2 cups of sugar! I can't understand the few problems people reported. If you butter the pans and shake in a little flour, it comes out so easily and does not break up. The ganache I made out of local dark Cadbury Bournville choc (300g) and 200g Swiss milk choc. (This comes to just over a pound) It chilled to a beautiful glossy spreading consistency. The batter was of a perfect consistency. The lack of a full cup of (castor/superfine) sugar doesn't seem to matter. I baked it for just over an hour. Size of pans not a problem. Glorious, moist, tender and full-flavoured -- death by chocolate! Just follow the recipe and do not (as someone did) use honey in place of the syrup for the ganache. I used golden syrup (cane syrup). Honey has water in it, which could make your ganache seize up into a gritty mess. Three Michelin stars for this recipe!!!

I made this cake for a party, and everyone loved it. It was VERY moist and not too sweet, which was great! The only this is that instead of baking the cakes in two pans, I just poured it all into one...definitly a mistake. It took twice as long to bake, and the inside was more gooey than the outside. I still managed to slice it into a top and bottom piece. I put a custard sauce and strawberry slices in between, then frosted the whole this with the chocolate frosting. Delicious! I would definitly make this again.

This is the second time I made t his cake. Still as wonderful as the first,however I had a problem I hope someone can help me with. I made the cake a day early and put in the fridge. Removed about 21/2 hours before serving. Frosting was very hard and cake was crumbly when cut. The first time I made it the same day as I served it and did not have a problem. HELP

A very dense, brownie-like cake. My batter was so thick, I was afraid I was going to make a cookie. The flavor was amazing, but I think I overbaked it a little--I definitely shouldn't have done the full hour, though when I checked the cake at 50 minutes as recommended by reviews, it was still damp. Unfortunately, by the time I took it out, the cake turned dry and crumbly. Next time I'll decrease the baking time and up the moisture, maybe use a steam bath, and lighten the batter by beating the yolks and whites separately. The ganache looked a bit much, so I basically whipped heavy cream with a cup of powdered sugar, spread the topping on the cake and drizzled a mixture of blackberry preserves and pulverized marionberries on top. The lightness of the cream and the slight tartness of the fruit offset the flavor and texture perfectly. The texture was good, but not quite what I was looking for at the time--a very fine crumb, not unlike pound cake. My favorite chocolate cake of all time is still the Chocolate Crunch Layer Cake right here from epicurious.com. I guess I was looking for a cake to overturn that Platonic Ideal (moist, fluffy, dark, not too sweet), but this wasn't it. Still, definitely worth my while making, and I foresee this being a standard birthday cake for chocoholic friends.

I made this cake for my entire family just after the passing of my grandmother. It was a hard time but my grandfather said it was the best chocolate cake he ever had, and it cheered him up a bit. If a food can do that it definitely deserves four stars....errr forks. I Curled some milk and dark chocolate on tope for garnish. It was great

A great cake. After making it as written a few times, I now use a not-so-sweet fruit jelly in between the layers to cut down on the sweetness of the frosting (which is VERY good, but (gasp) we are not chocolate addicts). I also like to drizzle a little Grand Marnier or Amaretto on the cake after it cools for an over 21 version. Very good, no problems and I will make it again.

For the cook who used the honey instead of corn syrup and did not know why the gnache was a disaster, Hello! honey is certainly not a substitute for corn syrup and why do you need to make substitutions? Go to the store and buy some corn syrup and make the frosting again. It is the easiest gnache in the world to make and by far the best. I have made this cake and frosting at least 25 times and it is pretty a no fail recipe. I own a catering bussiness and written in before that this cake is making me famous. I was not surprized in the least to see that it was still on constant comment

Rating: 3
This was very good, but a bit of a gilded lily. The rich and deeply flavored frosting overwhelms the very excellent taste of the cake. I had the chance to taste the cake in its unfrosted state when I had to trim a bit of cake off to achieve a flat suface. It was fabulous, but once the cake was frosted its flavor was buried by the ganache. I think this frosting could be used with success on a much simpler cake recipe to make the whole thing less arduous. Alternatively, the cake alone would be excellent with just a dusting of confectioner's sugar or a bit of whipped cream.

HELP!! I made this cake last night, and the cake turned out beautifully (sitting in the fridge right now, getting ready for serving). I had some extra batter for scraps, and it is SOOO good!! Problem: the frosting!! Oh my goodness, it was a disaster!! Turned chunky, and the oil started to separate. I used belgian chocolate from whole foods and substituted honey for the corn syrup.....everything else I did exactly as stated. I'm planning on serving the cake this weekend for my roommates birthday, so I have until then to get it right. Please advise!! Thanks in advance. If I can't get it right, i"ll just use sweetened whipped cream and berries, but there are too many positive comments about the frosting to give up this soon.

O.K. Cake experts. Can someone explain how to both "cool cakes completely in pan on rack" AND "run a knife around pan, invert on rack and cool completely"? I loved the cake but had problems with it not coming out of the pan. The pans were properly prepared and I let cool completely "in pans on a rack ". Should I not do this next time ? I'd still make again. Thanks

This is THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE EVER. It is so easy to make and is incredibly rich! The ganache tastes delicious and makes the cake look so beautiful. I used Lucini olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which made the cake super moist and delicious and is better for you! Enjoy!

Love this cake!!!!! I have read all of the reviews and agree with Everyone that rated the 4 forks!! I do not understand why some cakes came out dry... This cake gets better everyday and will last from two weeks!! I over looked the part where the cake should set for 3 days. I only let it set overnight and it was still GREAT!!! To Lynn in TX, I used a springform pan and let it cool for about an hour before taking it out of the pan. This is a KEEPER!!! My family love the cake.

To the cook from Atlanta: I'm quite certain that you made a horrible error while baking this cake, because if you followed the directions properly, there is no way that you could've gotten such bad results. Doesn't the fact that NINETY-FOUR percent of everyone who makes this (factor in how many reviews this cake has gotten) would gladly make it again give you a clue that perhaps it's not the recipe that caused your cake to fail-- it's a mistake you made? Oh well. Quite simply the easiest, most moist cake I've ever eaten. I grew up amongst several baking experts, but this cake by far "takes the cake" for being the best. Sigh, I wish I had some more to eat... but it was devoured.

This is our favorite chocolate cake recipe. Everyone agrees, even our 12 year old who is very picky. I've made it several times and used all different brands of chocolate with great success. Also used instant espresso and frosted with buttercream frosting. Makes a big impressive cake. Wonderful.

Incredible! My cake was not picture perfect -- against my better judgment, I followed the first direction regarding how to cool the cake (cool completely in the pans) and missed that the recipe also says to remove the cake layers from the pans and cool completely! (I prepared the pans properly.) Serve small pieces, because it's very rich and because you'll want leftovers.

All I can say is WOW!!! I needed a cake I could bake with the stuff I had at home. I didn't have great chocolate--Hershey's and Nestle were it. And to the reviewer who was worried about the coffee--you can't taste it at all. It adds a depth, but it certainly isn't mocha tasting at all. My dh also dislikes coffee, and he loved this cake! I can't imagine it any better!

WOW! Best chocolate cake I've ever made! Got tons of compliments at a birthday party -- people even asked if I could make this for their birthday! Didn't have 10 inch pans, so I used our 8 inch pans and made 3 (THREE) layers and baked only for 40-45 mins. Then I doubled the frosting recipe, and BOY, WAS IT GOOD! This is my new chocolate cake recipe!

This is truly a winner,appreciated by young and old,those with discerning tastes and those who only need a sweet fix.So far the best recipe I've come across for a big cake. Rich and dark and deep taste of chocolate enhanced by the coffee. I've made it three times using bakers chocolate and have been totally happy with the results. One day I'll spring for the better chocolate and see if the taste improvement is worth the cost.

I have made this cake three times and it is great! I am not a coffee drinker but did not find the coffee in the recipe intrusive. I keep a small jar of Italian espresso and use this when coffee is called for in a recipe. This is the cake I make when I want a big chocolate layer cake.

To the previous reviewer: I have no idea why such problems with this cake would occur. My advice would be to heed the instructions to butter and use parchment on the tins. My cakes almost fall right out of the pan. Other than that, I can't imagine what the problem could be. Besides being totally easy to make, this cake tastes just fantastic. It's moist and rich, as a chocolate cake should be. Served with raspberry puree.

I've made this cake three times and I do agree with all of the reviews on taste - it's a fabulous chocoate cake. But I don't think it really turns out all that well. Of the three times I've made it, only once did I have any success getting the cakes out of the pans and stacked on top of one another successfully. I bake all the time and do quite well with it, so I don't think it's my fault. I tried making this for a friends birthday this weekend (figuring I would give it one last chance) and had to throw the whole thing away since it came away in so many pieces. What a waste! Any suggestions would be helpful.

Lynn from Texas - you must try this again, I made it twice because I wasn't happy with it the first time. I put 1 1/2 cups cocoa, but baked it not more than 50 minutes! Also, don't substitute oil, use vegetable. This is a fabulous cake. (I am going to use a buttercream frosting next time)

Rating: 0
it does sound like you put in too much cocoa powder. 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces, but not 8 dry ounces. since cocoa's a light powder, i would guess that 8 dry ounces of cocoa is much more than 1 cup. also, too much cocoa would result in exactly what you experienced -- dryness, and since cocoa doesn't have any sugar, too much tastes very bitter.

Rating: 0
This recipe experience was a disaster!!!! The cake layers came out hard and very very very dry. If I made a mistake it would have been in measuring the cocoa. Instead of measuring a cup, the container I bought was 8 oz., so I just poured the container into the mix. I also floured my pans. Everything else I followed step by step. Not only was the cake extremely dry and very stiff, it was tuff crusted, it was exceptionally bitter. And I don't mean chocolate bitter. If you have any suggentions please advise, I was so looking for a great chocolate cake recipe. Not only was the cake a failure, but the cost to make was like burning money. Please help. Lynn

Definitely will use this as my standard chocolate cake recipe from now on. Very moist and delicious. The ganache frosting is too rich for me, so will use another frosting next time. I spread crushed raspberries reduced with sugar between the two layers rather than the ganache, and that was a great foil to the sweetness of the cake & frosting.

One of the easiest recipes to make with the most impressive results. A buttercream frosting would be a great alternative to the ganache, but the cake is perfect just the way it is. It's very important to use very good quality chocolate.

Just made this tonight and it turned out great! I did a couple of things differently, I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and I substituted 1/2 cup of cornstarch is lieu of some of the flour. Extremely moist. Frosting was semi thin but it worked out great. I used nestles semi sweet chips for the chocolate. It is so chocolaty I maybe would put a thin layer of marmalade or jam between the layers to give it a bit of a twist.

Definitely the best scratch cake I've ever made! I baked it in two 9-inch pans for 55 minutes (made a little loaf with the extra batter) and it was perfect, unbelievably moist.

It turned out looking much better than I expected -- the ganache seems to smooth out the imperfections in the cake. Everyone at Thanksgiving loved it!

MAJOR Semi-sweet chocolate to the rescueeeeeeeeeeeeee! This cake is not for your mild-mannered milk chocolate fans. This is one of those easy-to-make, but you-look-like-a-hero kind of a cake. One caution is that most of us do not have 10" cake pans, so I would divide this batter into three cake pans, when I do it again.

Just for fun I went to the site this morning to see if it was still on because I made it again this weekend for my daughters 20th birtday. {she has eaten a lot of cake is 20 years} None like this one though. I am on a diet and yet I have had it for breakfast three mornings in a row. Ha it is truly irresistable. Yes it really is the best chocolate cake in the world. I also made it for a job { a gentlemans 80th birtday {what pressure} and his family thinks I am a chocolate goddess! Pleeeeeeeeease make this cake and don't skip the frosting and DO NOT bake longer than 50 minutes and Do use 2 10 inch cake pans,springform are great. Your friends will think you bought it at a gouremet bakery. I appreciate fine chocolate but I must confess that I made it in my shop and all we had at the time was Nestles chocolate chips and hesheys cocoa. Fabulous! got to go I need to eat the last piece!

Ever since the original recipe was published, I've never been tempted to use another chocolate cake recipe. I made this for the first time in March 1999 for a birthday party, and have since duplicated the spectacular results numerous times. You just simply cannot go wrong. For the record, Baker's brand of chocolate works fine. I use bittersweet chocolate for the ganache, and semi sweet for the cake. This cake is enormous, so make sure you're feeding people with good appetites! This is the only chocolate cake my husband will eat, and will become the benchmark for which other chocolate cakes will be judged! Soooo good! P.S. I found my 10 inch pans at Party Time-- professional quality, and only about $8 each. When I baked this at my Mum's, I used 10 inch springform pans instead of the cake pans-- worked beautifully, and springforms seem to be easier to locate.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've used over the years and I'm an avowed chocoholic. We've made it many times and it never fails. To make the icing less rich, I use 2/3 regular semisweet chocolate and 1/3 unsweetened chocolate (Bakers is jut fine). I'd like to know if anyone has tried decorating the cake with buttercream or other decorative frosting on top of the chocolate icing, for a special occasion? My 6-year-old has requested this cake for her birthday but would like some fancy characters piped on top. Any tips would be appreciated.

This is chocolate cake heroin. My husband asked for chocolate cake for his birthday, delighting me, the rabid chocoholic in the family. All roads pointed to this recipe. I used a mix of President's Choice bittersweet and Neilson's Dairy Milk. Overbought, so I had to eat some. Cake passed the raw batter taste test, several times, with flying colours. Ganache was like a bowl full of truffles sitting in my fridge. Four of us each had a piece after the birthday supper and then my son and I finished off the cake on our own over the next few days. I was up to two pieces a day with a few dips into the leftover ganache that beckoned every time I opened the fridge. Once the cake was gone, I forced myself to drown the rest of the frosting and then suffered through three days of chocolate withdrawal. I'll make it again. But not for awhile. Don't let anyone tell you that you won't get hooked.

Absolutely DELISH!!!! I followed the recipe instructions to the letter, but substituted sour cream for buttermilk and cake flour for all purpose flour... the results where incredible. Even on the first day this cake was scrumptious (I tasted it when I trimmed off the excess dome made during baking on the layers - I made 2 9".) I was good and let it sit at room temperature for 2 days, then frosted it with the ganache. I made it for my birthday (since I'm a chocoholic) and it was a big hit, even with among my family & friends that haven't had a fondness for chocolate in the past. The cake was moist, dense but lightly textured, and deeply chocolate flavored. I will definitely add this recipe to my files and will make it again. Maybe next time just as a plain chocolate cake... it's that GOOD!!! CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!!!

I managed to do a little emergency math and salavaged the not yet completely melted concotion. Bottom line? It turned out absolutely perfect!

This cake did not live up to all the reviews. I used Gharadelli chocolate since Callebaut was not available. After pouring the batter into a 10" springform pan, there didn't look like there would be enough for a 2nd pan, so I used an 8" pan instead. The cake cooked for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. I am pretty sure it was because the layers were thicker than what would have been if I used 2-10" pans divided equally. But I like my cakes to have HIGH layers. So next time I will opt to use 2-8" pans. And I would put EXTRA ganache between the layers. The cake was good, but not to die for. I made it 2 days in advance, but it definitely tasted better on the 6th day!! The ganache was my favorite. And I think the cake tasted a better a little chilled rather than at room temperature. Odd as it may seem.

Rich and delicious!! My daughter wanted the "most chocolatey" cake for her birthday, so I made this. It's definitely a winner... just remember to check the cake after 45 minutes in the oven.

Wow! A great chocolate cake. I took it to a birthday party and it was a hit. I'm funny about chocolate cake but I think this is a winner! I made 2/3 the recipe and baked in 8 1/2" springform pans. Watched them carefully and took them out at 48 mins. The hardest part was figuring out how to get the second layer on the cake without breaking it. It is very tender! The Guittard French Vanilla semisweet is lovely. I found a block of it at a local creamery-grocery. I will make it again!

I tested a cupcake the first day & found it grainy, but by day three it had become wonderfully moist and delicate. GREAT RECIPE ! ! !

This is a wonderful recipe! It requires a fair amount of work and a lot of chocolate, but it's worth it. I, like others, did 3 layers in 9-in. pans, cooked for 50 min., and it turned out perfectly. I highly recommend making it ahead of time, as I felt it was much better the second and third day.

This was an incredible cake - everyone loved it! I also made it in 3 layers and baked for 50 minutes. I used Ghiradelli chocolate and yogurt instead of buttermilk and it worked just fine. WIth three layers, though, it was really enourmous. I will probably reduce the recipe next time by a third and only make 2 layers.

I made this for my daughter's Bday party, and it was a great success. I followed the suggestions in the previous reviews (ie 3 9inch pans, bake for only 50 minutes)and they were right on.

The receipe made a very dense, rich cake. I used Callbeaut chocolate "chips" for the frosting and it worked beautifully. (I bought the pieces at a candy counter for $9 a lbs rather than the brick chocolate for $22 a lb.) Rave reviews from my guests!! I also only cooked the cake for 55 minutes rather than the recommended 1 hr. 10 minutes.

I made this cake for a dinner party we had, and it turned out fantastic! My husband said it was the best chocolate cake he's ever had. It was rich and moist without being too sweet. I used 3 nine inch pans and cooked for about 40 minutes. I also used a cocoa, water mixture (heated) instead of coffee, and it worked perfectly.

I made this recipe for a dessert party and it was a hit! A very rich and delicious chocolate cake...heaven for the chocolate lover! I also only baked the cake for 50-55 minutes...and it was perfect. I used Ghiradelli chocolate in the batter and frosting, since that is the best quality I could find. It worked great...no need to spend more than necessary.

I adore chocolate and this is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I used 3 8.5" pans instead of the 10" ones (which I couldn't find). It worked perfectly and was quite impressive.

I baked this cake for a party bcause the reviews were so wonderful. I baked it in 3 9inch pans, no problem at all. It made a great towering cake. I took the advice of others and did not bake the given time, instead for only 50 minutes. Still, it was too long. I thought the cake was bit dry, although my friends disagreed. The icing was delicious. I had to put the icing in the fridge to firm it up. I'd try it one more time with less baking time and hope for a moister cake.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He's a chocoholic, and said this was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had. It is a rich, moist and dense cake with great flavor. It is nice to find a cake recipe that doesn't rely on frosting for its chocolate flavor. The only downside: I'd hate to know how many calories one slice has. Also, skip the added sugar in the ganache frosting - it doesn't need it.

I made this cake for my husband's family reunion (so there was a little bit of pressure with the in-laws and all :)) and it turned out FANTASTIC. I don't know why everyone says that the 10'' pans are manditory--I used 9" and just left some batter in the bowl (maybe a half or 3/4 of a cup?). I remember thinking that I would need to bake it longer because of the thickness, but it turns out that I only needed to bake it for like 50 minutes or so. The cake is fabulous and wonderfully moist--DON'T OVERBAKE! There is no way I would have baked this for the suggested time. I am going to make it again this weekend and I am praying for the same results! As long as it turns out as well, I will never need to try another recipe! I would make sure to serve it room temperature--I served mine chilled and the ganache was much too firm.

I used 3,8" pans for an impressive towering cake. Deep rich chocolate flavor,but I missed the butter a cake should have. Try chocolate chunk cake (in this data base) for true decadence.

This cake tasted FABULOUS. My husband and I absolutely loved it. I too baked the cake for only 50 minutes. The icing is really to die for. I've never had a better chocolate cake. The only problem is, now I'll never be able to order a slice from any of the great restaurants in town-- they'll all fall short. I passed on some leftovers to my siblings-- loved by all. Thanks so much.

After reading the rave reviews for months, I couldn't wait to try this cake. I followed the directions exactly, bought the proper size pans, checked the cake after only 50 minutes - and it was done. I wish I had checked it sooner, b/c it was not as moist as other chocolate cakes I have made. It was also rather crumbly. My guests all liked it, but I am disappointed to say that I have had better.

Rating: 4
To echo all the other fans here: This cake is amazing. I never bake cakes from scratch, and this one was a breeze, even with instant coffee. To fit 8" pans, I used 2/3 the recipe and 1/2 the frosting, which was perfect. Definitely better with vanilla ice cream (Breyers with vanilla bean specks!); best after overnight refrigeration--it turns delightfully fudgy. Made it for my 1 yr. anniversary with my boyfriend and he is raving about it, weeks later...

Fabulous. Not to sweet or rich - and wonderfully moist. The milk chocolate center gives it a wonderful touch. Made as a birthday cake - everyone raved. I would let the frosting cool a bit before pouring. It makes it easier to control.

This is one of the best, if not the best, chocolate cakes I've ever tasted! It's incredibly moist, and sweet, to solve any chocolate craving! We substituted the buttermilk for homemade sour milk, and we didn't try the icing, instead used a basic mocha butter icing, which was delicious! Don't be surprised if the batter seems thin, and sort of runny, it turns out beautifully!!

This cake tastes like a big fudge brownie. I was surprised at how beautifully moist it came out. Next time I will try a buttercream frosting in place of the ganache. One surprising thing is that after refrigerating it overnight and then bringing it to room temperature the next day it tasted even better!

I can't believe some people had negative things to say about this cake. I've made it so many times I have the recipe memorized. The cake has been to die for every time. Soooo many people had only good things to say, I suggest if you did not like the cake, give it another go. Perhaps it was something you did. Also use a good quality chocolate.

I made this for a recent chocoholic's birthday and while it was good, it didn't get the rave reviews I was anticipating. There is a recipe for a Minnesota Fudge Cake in my mom's original NY Times Cookbook (published in the 60s) which is absolutely amazing. I think that I will stick with that one.

Supurb! What a great recipe. I was away from home and without a mixer and it still turned out delicious. I substituted 1 cup hot water and 1/2 cup creme de cocoa for the coffee, and sour cream for the buttermilk. I also baked it in a bundt pan for the full hour. What a cake!

Yum yum yum! Of course I had to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews! I replaced 1/4 of the flour amount with cornstarch (a tip I learned while in France) and it made the cake even more moist! Have yet to try the frosting since the cake is soooo delish by itself!

The cake is maybe the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I only baked it for about 50 minutes and it was perfect! The ganache is too much, so unless you really like your chocolate pure and strong and never enough, I would use a butter cream. The cake could also stand alone w/ some whipped cream and berries. Best of all, it is easy to make!

Made this cake for the first time last night for my sister's birthday. I even bought the 10-inch cakepans, and expensive chocolate. The chocolate was intense, true, but I found the frosting to be truffle-like, and just too much for this cake. I prefer a buttercream instead. Although this was very good, I could not give it 4 spoons...The very best recipe and 4+ spoons goes to Cooks Illustrated's Classic Devils Food Cake with Coffee Buttercream frosting. I'll make this particular cake again sometime, however, not with the ganache.

Rating: 4
I baked this cake in a Batman shaped pan, per the request of my three year old nephew. And it still turned out great, even though I'm not sure how many inches the pan was. The ganache is to die for... do not pass it up. The best chocolate cake any one in my family has ever eaten. Five forks aren't too many.

Rating: 4
Moist....decadent....fudgy....beautiful. It doesn't get any better than this for chocolate lovers. For a variation, I might try using the ganache as a filling and "frosting" it with whipped cream and serving with a rasberry coulis. My only suggestion would be DON'T skip the greased wax/parchment paper step - I skipped that step and had a devil of a time getting it out the pan. Fortunately, the ganache was able to hide my goofup.

It's beond my comprehension why someone would make this cake if they didn't like chocolate, then give it a low rating. That's like me making a blueberry pie and then stating the recipe was terrible because I hate blueberries and pie crust. Anyhow, for those of us who DO love chocolate (and I dare say we're the majority) this cake will be a pleaure to bake and eat. Really, really moist, and rich. Make this for guests whom you want to impress with your culinary genius.

Delicious! The layers were thick enough that I made 2 single layer cakes, skipped the frosting completely and decorated the top with stenciled powdered sugar. The cake is rich enough and moist enough that this worked well. Everyone commented that they didn't miss the frosting at all. Definitely one I would make again. Simple and delicious.

THIS CAKE IS THE BEST EVER, AND I BAKE IT AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH. I SIMPLY HAVE NEVER FOUND A BETTER RECIPE FOR A CHOCOLATE CAKE. USE A GOOD CHOCOLATE; DON'T WORRY IF THE BATTER APPEARS TOO THIN. TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER: THE DIRECTIONS STATE 10" PANS ARE REQUIRED. IF YOU USED 8" PANS, THEY SURELY WOULD OVERFLOW. THIS CAKE IS WORTH THE EFFORT PUT FORTH TO SEEK OUT 10" PANS. TOTALLY AMAZING-- EVEN IF YOU NEVER BAKE, YOU WILL FIND THIS EASY. ENJOY.

Very moist and VERY chocolatey. But it seems to make more than just 2 8" cake pans -- I filled each pan to the top, and they overflowed like crazy. IF your pans are small like mine, you might have enough left over to make cupcakes.

I can't believe that the fabulousness of this cake is even an issue! I cannot describe how amazing this recipe is, or how awesome the results will be if you follow the directions. I say that if this isn't the best chocolate cake you've ever eaten, you must have done something wrong. (DON'T bake this in the wrong size pan, and then wonder why the cakes turn out dry-- follow the directions!) Try to use the best chocolate and cocoa you can find. I believe this also makes a difference in the outcome.

I love chocolate. This was too much chocolate. The kids thought it was too rich and too strong. It was pretty, if a little lopsided(I'm sure its my oven.) If you make it make sure to serve small pieces with vanilla ice cream, coffee or milk is a must.

I used the "cake" part of this recipe with the mousse and chocolate collar from the Irish Cream Mousse Cake elsewhere on this site. Among guests used to phenomenal desserts, this was a very big hit. Time intensive for the whole thing, but well worth it for a special occasion.

Sorry, but this cake was just OK. Baked it for only 15 minutes (per a reviewer comment) and it was still a little dry. The icing was very very good,but I wouldn't make it again because of the dry cake. Also -- I thought the layers would be thicker because of the 8" pan and they were kind of thin for a cake. I had lots of left overs.

I had heard from a friend that quite a few readers had made the cake and loved it as much as I do. I read all the reviews and have 2 suggestions. 1.) If you don't love chocolate, you're going to be disappointed and 2.) If you find it dry, be very careful not to overcook it. In the recipe development we found that temperature and time are critical in this recipe. If you do a lot of baking, you should have your oven calibrated by a professional once a year or so. I'm glad so many of you like it! Happy eating ;-)

Oh me, oh my! This is too fabulous to describe! A moist chocolate slice of heaven, with no fail instructions to boot! If you're wary of the thin batter (as I was), don't be! I guess it's supposed to be like that, because this cake is perfection! LOVE IT!!

This is such a wonderful cake... I've baked it a dozen times, each time experimenting with different types of chocolates. This last time, I used a superpremium brand from Venezula called El Ray, and it was out of this world. But I've used Baker's from the supermarket as well, and the cake still turns out very well. ALWAYS moist and rich, without being too much so.

Rating: 4
This is by far the best cake recipe I've made, and the only one that has lived up to my expectation. It is easy and doesn't require the gourmet chocolate to be delicious - I have used Baker's chocolate and even generic chocolate chips! This recipe cannot fail! For a smaller (8") cake, use 2/3 the cake recipe with 1/3 the frosting (the frosting recipe makes way too much for a cake this rich). And I have had no trouble storing it covered in the refrigerator for a week. It stays moist, and the frosting takes on a fudge-like consistency that is just wonderful.

I have made this cake twice and have to admit that I am disappointed given all the rave reviews. It's good, but not the best chocolate cake I ever had. I made it for a dessert buffet along with the Triple-layer Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting (Bon Appetit 10/94) and the Strawberry-topped Cheesecake with Graham Cracker Crust (Bon Appetit 1/98). Everyone raved endlessly about the carrot cake and cheesecake but the only comments on the chocolate cake were about how pretty it was.

EXTREMELY dense chocolate cake. A bit too rich for my taste, but guests seemed to like it. I would use the best quality chocolate for this cake. Seemed to be a bit heavy, will try to "lighten" it. Perhaps not so much oil? 50 minutes of baking time was perfect.

This cake is incredible. I made it for a party and I heard comments like "to die for" and "best chocolate cake I've ever had" all night long. It is so rich that a little goes a long way.

Strong, dark coffee helps too.

Made this cake for a 10-person birthday party... believe the hype: I, too, got heartfelt "best chocolate cake I ever had" comments... I cut back on the chocolate a bit, using a pound of Ghirardelli total (7 oz. in the batter, the remaining 3.3 oz. in the ganache), and used a strong dark roast coffee; the coffee balanced the sweetness of the chocolate perfectly! I thought my guests might be too full for desert, but the cake vanished easily

Based on all the reviews, I had to try this,so I made it for a friend's birthday party. I used 3 9 inch layer pans for a very tall, impressive looking cake. It really did look great: especially with tall candles and decorated with fresh flowers. It is really,really rich: fudge like consistency, and I noticed that although everyone seemed to like it, a lot of people didn't finish the huge pieces on their plates: I would suggest cutting smallish pieces and serving with vanilla ice cream. My cake was a bit crumbly, but no one complained. The icing is AWESOME!! Didn't need to chill it for long before icing, but I did chill the cake for a day before serving and then brought to room temp.

This is a chocoholic's dream come true, commanding all of the attention on a dessert buffet. Being a caterer, it has become a demand item on my customer's must list! Match it up with a high quality vanilla ice cream and listen to the "wows" and "raves"!

This is a fabulous cake! I made it for my husband's birthday and he and our guests loved it. I usually don't like chocolate cakes because they tend to be dry, but this cake was very moist and very yummy! In the process of icing the cake, it fell into pieces, but I was able to rectify the cake with icing and gentle "pushing". After chilling the cake, no one could tell their were any problems. I highly recomend this cake. It was my first time making a cake and icing from scratch and I will definetely make it again!

Definitely a good cake for a chocolate lover. I used bittersweet for both cake and icing, and next time would only use it on the cake and go with semi for the icing. I made it in three 8 1/2" pans, cooked about 50 minutes; this was fine. Its not a difficult recipe but all that sifting is really time consuming. While I did like this, I'd be more likely to make the chocolate mousse pie on this site again - its as easy as can be and heavenly. But I'm sure if someone wants a chocolate cake, this is the recipe I'd turn to. It really is very good.

Rating: 4
As good as everyone says. I made 2/3 of the recipe and baked in 8" pans. It overflowed a little, so next time, I'll halve the recipe and bake in 8" pans. A huge, huge hit at my house. I used supermarket chocolate and it was still wonderful, so I think the expensive choc is probably to be reserved for special occasions...

Is this cake bliss personified or what? We LOVED this recipe... so did my dinner guests. A few went home with the recipe, including my sister's fiance, a pastry chef! Some hints: my cakes were done in fifty minutes, so don't take the recommended time as gospel. I also found that it took my chocolate much longer than only ten minutes to melt into the coffee... but who am I to complain even a bit? This cake is just wonderful, and I'll invent any excuse now to bake it. End of summer party, anyone?

Just fyi, if you can get your hands on buttermilk once in awhile, you can always freeze it and then use it in baking with good results. Or, lots of stores nowadays have a buttermilk powder that you add water to to mix up in the quantity you need; personally I dislike the aftertaste with this mix, and gave my whole container away after trying it once, but lots of people do use it. Or, you could always go the home-soured milk route--milk with a little cider vinegar (or lemon juice, but I like the vinegar more). That latter is what I generally do.

How can anything be this good?! After all the glowing comments I had to try it myself. It is absolutely fabulous! Like another reviewer, I too got a marriage proposal based on this cake! The only suprise to me was that the batter was fairly thin. But apparently that's just exactly how it was supposed to be. Rich, decadent, moist, HUGE and a chocoholics fantasy. Only suggestion would be to have a large, cold glass of milk on hand. You'll need it.

Delicious, AND forgiving! I had the cakes in the oven before realizing I'd forgotten to grease the pans. Mistake! My bottom layer was in three, but the top was alright. Even with my major error, everyone proclaimed this the best chocolate cake they'd ever eaten! It's EXTREMELY rich, and is best appreciated when eaten in small quantities. One tip: remember to finely chop the chocolate before pouring in the coffee-- I didn't and my squares did not fully melt. But, like everyone said, this cake is to die for, and deserves every fork possible!

FA-BU-LOUS! I baked this for my daughter-in-law's birthday, for a party of twenty. No one could get over how amazing this recipe is. Usually I don't try cakes (I prefer pies) but I felt like doing something traditional for a birthday party. I'm so glad I did. My twelve year old son ate three pieces! I whipped up a raspberry sauce as suggested and served this cake in a pool of that. It was so good, and next time I don't think I'll bother with the sauce. Though it was nice for a special occasion, this cake stands up just perfectly on its own. PS I used ten inch pans that I found at a party store. The grand size makes this cake look even more impressive.

This is the best cake I have ever made. Everyone at work loved it and I even got one marriage proposal with it. It is very moist and chocolately. I wish I had been able to find a different flavor chocolate for the icing -- I used Ghiraddelli semi-sweet for both. This cake was so delicious and moist it didn't even need icing. Use the cake pan sizes called for in the recipe -- anything smaller and you have lots of batter left over.

AMAZING RECIPE! I never would have tried it had it not been on the "most talked about" site for so long-- I'm a terrible cake baker. But, so many people had nothing but excellent comments, I decided to give myself one more chance to prove myself in the baking department. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This cake is nothing short of wonderful, a real keeper. Fabulous with Breyers vanilla bean ice cream, or another premium brand. I may be getting ahead of myself, but I'm ready to open up my own bakery!

To the cook who couldn't locate the chocolate for the frosting-- I don't know where to find it, but if I were you I'd call the restaurant where this recipe came from and ask for their advice. And if you still can't locate it, don't let that stop you from making this cake with another chocolate......... it's DIVINE!

This was a fun cake. I was nice to admit that I didn't make this cake from a box! I ended up baking it in two 8 1/2 inch rounds for an hour, so I had extra mix left for an additional smaller cake (all for me!). Once I had baked it up it was clear to me by the density and the rate it razed that it was going to be a moist cake. I was prepaired to make the frosting as the recipie described, but I didn't notice it asked for a POUND of chocolate, I was unprepaired. Since my cake was about half of what the recipie asked for, I melted four ounces of chocolate and some margerine, along with some cream and sugar to a boil, (I was out of corn syrup). I wasn't woried though, I ended up with a glaze, and drooled it over the cake and in the layers. The cake is so moist and rich that you really just need a pinch more of sweetness to complement it. You could probably get away with powdered sugar for frosting! Awesome cake, you can't loose. Oh- and everyone enjoyed it.

I have many chocolate cake receipes, but by far, this is the BEST. and easy to do. served this for a dinner party and everyone wants the receipe, even a chef. Thanks, you have outdone yourself.

My best friend made this cake for our birthdays and MAN was it good! It was so delish that I gave the ice cream to the dog, so as not to dilute the rich chocolate flavor of the cake. The texture was also very nice.

I am very anxious to try this recipe, but I have not yet been able to locate the chocolate that the chef used for the frosting. The recipe states that he used Guittard French-vanilla chocolate. I can't even find this on the Guittard website. I know that Guittard makes choc-au-lait vanilla chips. Is this what he used? The picture though shows a dark chocolate frosting. After reading all the reviews, I know that I could use almost any type of chocolate, but I would first like to try the recommended types. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Yes, this is the best chocolate cake I have ever had and that is saying somehting! As good as any cake from an exclusive bakery. Beware, the chocolate and the coffe add up to a hefty dose of caffeine and addiction.

YUM! I've rarely seen such a highly rated recipe on this site, so when my husband invited some of his co-workers for dinner, I did a gutsy thing and made this cake for dessert without sampling it first. (Come to think about it, I suppose the move wasn't so gutsy-- this many people can't be wrong!) Anyway, we all agreed this cake is divine. Probably the best dessert I've ever had the pleasure of making, and I've baked a lot of desserts in my day. SO moist, and rich... needless to say, a keeper.

What a sinful and delicious cake! For a little extra flavor, I added 1T. Kaluha to the batter and then brushed the layers with Kalhua. I made three 8-inch layers--took a 2-layer cake to a friend and kept 1 layer for our family. It was a hit!

Rating: 4
Without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever made. A chocolate lovers dream and so moist. I made 2 - 9" layers and 4 Bundt muffins as I didn't have the 10" pans. Baking time was approx. 45 min. Brushed the cake with Grand Marnier, spread the ganache on the first time and then re-heated and poured it on for a second, glossy layer. What a hit!!

You want to know how much I LOVE this cake? After baking it, I gave a copy of the recipe to MY baker, and asked him to make this for my wedding cake! Almost every one of my guests made a point to come and compliment me on this delicious creation. Enough said.

We made this cake last night for my husband's father's birthday, and I can honestly say it was the BEST we've ever made (or eaten in a restaurant, for that matter.) There were only six of us present, so I was hoping for leftovers, but, no such luck. We ate half the huge cake, then my father-in-law requested he take the rest home. Boo hoo!

TRULY a dish beyond compare! Four forks, plus!

This is a fabulous recipe! By far the best chocolate cake I've ever baked. The best part about it is how moist it is-- I've never made a cake that melts in the mouth like that. Note: I've used both Dutch Process and regular (non-alkalized,like Hershey's) cocoa powder, and could not detect a difference. This cake is simply scrumptious, and had my guests fighting over the last piece. Milk or coffee to drink a must.

I'm afraid to comment on this cake as I didn't think it deserved 4 forks as everyone else did, BUT I must say it was delicious, just not a dish beyond compare. I thought the texture was wonderful as was the frosting, but it was just too chocolatey for me.

I made this for my husband's boss's birthday. It went to his office, so I didn't get to try it myself, sadly. Within 15 minutes of this cake being served, 3 people asked him to get the recipe from me. I increased the amounts by x1.5 to serve more people. This made 2 - 9 x 13 cakes which took about 1-1/2 hours to bake. I split them to make four layers, then filled the layers with a chocolate pastry cream. It was HUGE and very beautiful. I only wish I had been able to enjoy it! Maybe next time, and there WILL be a next time for this one.

Awesome! I made this cake for my friend's 23rd birthday (taking it along on our camping trip!) It was amazingly rich and sinful. The cake was moist and the frosting, when chilled, is reminicent of fudge. I cheated a little... the cake had to travel well, so I made it in a 11x14 sheet cake pan. I couldn't find Callebaut chocolate, but Nestle semisweet baking chocolate worked just fine. Even the "non-chocolate people" raved, braving the rain to stick around for some more. Give it a try... you'll be glad you did!

Oh, how I love this recipe! I'm so glad more and more people are trying it. I too have given only this recipe four out of four forks. I think it's that good. I can't understand the one negative review. I've baked this dozens of times, with an equal amount of requests for the recipe. A real keeper!

I've been making this cake since I saw it in the magazine. By far the most delicious, moist chocolate cake imaginable. Use a good quality chocolate; it makes a difference. (I use Callebaut bittersweet).

Florida, (7/26/00) what are you talking about??!! :) This cake is perfection, heaven personified. NOT MOIST?? This cake is SO moist, sometimes (just SOMEtimes)it falls apart when sliced. This should not deter anyone from trying this. One bite and you and your guests (be sure to serve this to guests-- they'll think you're a genius, plus it makes a huge cake)will demand the recipe. Or demand you invite them over the next time you make it. That's what mine did! SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!

Made this cake for a rehearsal dinner. It was a hit!!!! However, I used bittersweet chocolate for the cake instead of semi sweet to cut down sweetness. I stored a sample cake for 5 days and it was still moist and delicious. I'm already getting requests for another one.

If anyone else is having trouble finding 10 x 2" round cake pans, try the mail order catalogue 'Sweet Celebrations'. They have a huge selection of cake making equipment - much of it professional standard - & these pans are just $9.45 each. Used to be called 'Maid of Scandinavia' & you can call 1-800-328-6722 for a catalogue. The item # for 10 x 2" pans is 606732.

What a cake. I only had one 10 inch cake tin so I used it. I cooked the cake for 2 hours. It was ever so moist. This cake seemed to get moister the longer it sat there. As there were only 3 of us eating it it has taken nearly a week to finish as you only need small slices. A great cake to make for a large number.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I prefer a tall cake so I used 3 8"x2" cake pans, reducing cooking time about 20 minutes. The ganache frosting benefited greatly by the addition of vanilla and rum (Grand Marnier would be good too). Next time I'll brush the top of each cake layer with liqeur before frosting for a more "dimensional" flavor.

Excellent! Made it last night for a dinner party, and everyone raved. Even though I was full from dinner, I wolfed down my piece of cake. I thought the frosting was the BEST, and there was just the right amount -- not too much, not too little. I, too, used Baker's brand chocolate, and it worked just fine. The only downside to this recipe was that it took me forever to find 2 10x2" pans. At least now that I have them, I can make this cake over and over!

This is an amazing recipe. I've been an avid cook for years, however, cakes have alway eluded me. I've been able to produce one's that I could display but would advise against eating. This cake is a solid hit in both catagories. The only thing I would suggest is serving it atop a shallow pool of creme anglaise--spectacular!

This is the most incredibly delicious, dark and rich chocolate cake I've ever served! I used Ghirardelli double dark chocolate morsels and Ghirardelli cocoa. Rave reviews! The only problem I experienced was removing the layers from the pans, even though I used wax paper and greased well. Even so, this is a surprisingly easy cake to prepare. I made it while my granddaughter napped.

Rating: 4
This cake was delicious. I used bakers for the cake and girardelli chocolate for the ganache. I also used a layer of coffee buttercream under a layer of the melted ganache. Since I was not familiar with this technique, the result was an ugly mess,but nobody cared because they were too busy moaning in ecstacy over the cake.

Rating: 4
this is the best chocolate cake i've made -- moist and rich, but still light in texture. i've made it twice, once with the ganache, and once with a plain cream cheese icing decorated with chocolate shavings -- both are incredible! i use 2/3 of each of the ingredients and bake for ~1 hr. in 8-inch pans ... a more manageable sized cake.

Rating: 4
This was a MAJOR hit at my son's B-day. Fantastic , deep chocolate flavor and it was incredibly easy to make! What more can you ask for? Next time, I'll serve it with an very lightly sweetened raspberry sauce to counter the intense chocolate of the cake and ganache. This one will be in my files forever!

WOW! You can't go wrong with this cake - I've made it several times and it is consistently moist, even the time I forgot it in the oven! I've also made it with cream cheese icing and with a white chocolate icing - all to rave reviews and demands for more. It's great with a kaluah whipped cream filling (1/2 c. whipping cream, 1Tbs Kaluah and 1/4c confectioners sugar) Finally, for those without 10" pans it will make three 8" layers or 2 8" layers and cupcakes. Use about three cups of the batter for each 8" layer.

I made this for a birthday party-- it was a good thing that I decided to make it for a large group, because this cake is huge! I probably wouldn't make it again unless I was feeding a crowd. Everyone raved about it, though! It was very easy, and sooooo moist-- people at the party thought that it was my cooking skills that were excellent, but the truth is, this is just a great recipe. I had a bit of trouble locating the 10 inch cake pans. I had to buy them especially for this recipe. That's this cake's downside. But the other reviews were so good, I had to try this! Serve with a nice strong cup of Peet's coffee. You definitely need it to cut through the cake's richness. A keeper!

This cake is the definition of "Death by Chocolate"! I made it for an occasion at work, and my co-workers request it over and over again when we plan an office event. I mistakenly used regular whipping cream, not the heavy, in the ganache the second time I made the cake, but this did not hinder at all. I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet for both the cake and the frosting with wonderful results. The coffee really makes the difference in the moistness of the cake. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

This cake was a big hit at a birthday dinner... I did make some changes to the overall recipe. Callebaut bittersweet chocolate was used in the cake. Rather than fill the cake with ganache (which I consider a coating) I used a milk chocolate mousse filling. The coolness of the milk chocolate mousse was an excellent foil to the rich dark chocolate. Halved the ganache recipe (used 8 oz. of Callebaut semi-sweet) and had plenty to cover the 10" cake. Another addition was candied orange peel for decoration. In future I plan to brush the bottom layer with a combination of Grand Mariner & fresh orange juice to add another dimension.

I have made this cake several times. I recently made it as a wedding cake. I trippled the recipe and baked it in 2 9 inch pans and 2 13 inch pans.

This is all the chocolate cake you'll ever need. I can't believe how moist and delicious. I don't bake much, but this was wonderfully easy. Make sure you let the icing cool a bit, it's easier to handle and not as runny. I'm going to try it with french vanilla frosting next time.

I have made this recipe three times; once for friends, once for my brother in-law's Groom Cake, and last for a birthday cake. Each time I have altered it a little. The last time was the best. I added silver tequila to the espresso coffee and used Valhrona white chocolate with a tiny bit of Maytag Blue cheese for the filling. Scharfenburg for the icing works beautifully.

I'm not a big chocolate fan, or a big cake fan, but I found this recipe absolutely decadent!!!

My friend and i made this a three layer cake and melted peanut butter chips to spread with ganache between the layers. It was very tall and very impressive and cut very very well.

Wonderful! Rich and decadent, but not too much so. Everyone raved, and for the record, a basic chocolate (I used Baker's) works well. I didn't have trouble with the cake crumbling -- used 2 9 inch pans and baked for about 55 minutes. Chilling the ganache gave it the perfect spreadability. Enough extra batter to make an thin extra layer for munching. Yum!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit! The cake is extremely moist and the frosting decadent. I didn't have 10" pans so I substituted 3 9 X 1 1/2" pans. I made a two-layer cake with the frosting and saved the third layer to eat as "snack cake". There was just enough frosting to frost between layers and over the top with some falling down over the sides. Really just a perfect amount. If you love chocolate - this is your cake! Slice in small pieces when you serve - it is extremely rich.
