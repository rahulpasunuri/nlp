This was a really tasty gravy. It looked and tasted fine, so we left out the cream at the end. We forgot to add salt and pepper, and it didn't need it really. Came out just fine without, though you may need these if you want to stretch it. Just thought you'd like to know if you're trying to cut down on fat.

Everyone gobbled this up. I didn't give it four forks because no one raved about it but... there wasn't much talking going on... just lots of eating.
