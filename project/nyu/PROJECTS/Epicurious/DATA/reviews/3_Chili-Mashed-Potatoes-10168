I've made this twice now. The first time around, we thought they were a bit mild. The second time, I doubled the chile...mmmm...very, very good!

I haven't tried this one but it reminded me of a chili pototae recipe I learned in mexico. Saute serranos, onion and garlic and add to mashed potatoes. INCREDIBLE. I eat them plain or stuff pasilla chiles with them.

This is tasty fare -- I also did it using buttermilk and canned chipotles with a bit of their sauce. Beware -- these are *blazing* hot, don't overdo, but very delicious smoky flavor marries well with potatoes.
