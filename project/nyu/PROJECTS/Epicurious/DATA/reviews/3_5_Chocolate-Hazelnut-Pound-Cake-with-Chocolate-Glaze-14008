I don't know what I might not have done correctly, but I thought it was a little dry.

Don't bother. Agree with Memphis, lots of work, little return

Although this is fairly simple to make, I didn't think is was worth the effort. I found it a bit dry and not particularly flavorful. I think if you're going to the trouble to make a cake, it should be spectacular, this was only so-so.

No one mentioned the dryness of the cake. It looks great, and tastes wonderful, but I found the cake a bit crumbly and dry. Next time I make it I'm going to try adding a bit of vegetable oil and guage the results.

This is excellent with a few changes. First and foremost, buy very good European chocolate (i.e., no Hershey; if you must use American, make sure it's Scharfenberger.) For a more chocolaty and nutty desert use five (5) 3.5 oz. bars of chocolate and 3/4 c. sugar (instead of 1 c). Replace the 1 c. flour with an extra cup of ground and lighted toasted hazelnuts (i.e., skip the flour entirely) and use no salt if all you have is salted butter. If you don't have large eggs, use nine or ten medium-sized ones. The chocolate glaze is terrific, but use three 3.5 oz bars of excellent chocolate. If you do the above, your guests will think you're a genius.

This cake was a big hit at an open house I went to. It looks good and tastes great, especially with that rich glaze. It's a good party cake.

LOOOOVED IT! I love the combination of chocolate and hazelnut, I loved the presentation, even my mom, who always loves what she does better than what anyone makes, wanted the recipe!

Had this at a dinner party and it got raves. Served it with whipped cream and chocolate sauce on the side.

This cake is light and has a delicious nutty flavor. Serve slightly warm with whipped cream. Always a hit!

this was not great -- i have had better cakes with less work (not that this was alot of work, but for the results . . .) -- the glaze seemed too heavy for the "lightness" of the cake. the cooking time was much longer than indicated (about 55 minutes?). it was OK but i will not bother to make again. i would just make a good dense chocolate pound cake instead.

I topped it with vanilla ice-cream instead of chocolates and it was simply delicious

The cake is has three main steps, which are all very easy. I made it for my office and it was gone within an hour. Definitely will make it again. I also subsituted unsweetened chocolate it the cake and it had a fuller flavor.

Easy, and everyone loved it! Not quite dense but not fluffy either--and very nutty. The cake isn't extremely sweet, and the glaze provides a perfect balance. If you have guests who are less wild for chocolate, a heated and softened Nutella or similar spread might be a good substitute for the glaze, which is quite chocolatey. It would also make a delicious and sophisticated birthday cake.

Wow. This was wonderful, and easy to make. Tasted better than my German grandmother's Rehrküchen. The glaze makes it--don't skimp. I poured it all over once, then poured the drippings over so it covered the whole cake.
