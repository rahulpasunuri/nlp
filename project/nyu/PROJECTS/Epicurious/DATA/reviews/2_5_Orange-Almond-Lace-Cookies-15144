This recipe did not work out very well for me. Even following the recipe exactly, the dough was thin and the finished product tasted like a soggy cracker dipped in orange juice. They wouldn't even cook all the way through even with an extra 7 minutes. they just burned around the edges.

High altitude (Colorado) I turned the conveciton bake to 350, still took a long time to cook, but better than the 325 the recipe calls for. Parchment can be wiped off with paper towels and reused. I toasted whole almonds then ground them. I also added 1/4 t. almond extract and omitted the orange. Will do this again but roll them after they come out to make pirouettes and will dip the ends in dark chocolate. Kids loved them, so did hubby. Will make agian, pretty easy all around.

I made this a while ago and it turned out really well. I have to say that I made a modification : I ground up some of the almonds instead of leaving them whole -- it added a nice texture to the cookie. When they were hot they were delightfully chewy and when they had cooled down they were very crisp and were wonderful served with vanilla ice cream between two cookies.

Very easy to make and very good.

I don't know if I cooked the batter too long or too short, but it never thickened up. I added about 1 T extra flour and tried re-heating it on the stove. It never reached a consistency where I could roll it, so I dropped teaspoonfulls onto the cookie sheet. Tastes good, but they never spread out. Made about 24 "cookies".
