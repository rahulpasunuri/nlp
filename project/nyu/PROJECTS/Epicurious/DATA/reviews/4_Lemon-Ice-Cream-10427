Currently have a freezing problem. I did increase lemon juice to 3/4 cup and used 4 eggs rather than 3. I followed all other instructions, put cooled mixture into ice cream freezer, and after an hour and a half I still had liquid--not even slush. It won't freeze!

10 forks!!!! Used 3/4 cup 1/2 and 1/2, and 1 1/4 cup heavy cream. The best ice cream ever!!

WOW! Just the right amount of sweet and tart! After reading reviews, to avoid the possibility of curdling or graininess, I made sure to strain after heating and instead of using half-and-half, I used heavy whipping cream in the heating portion. I covered mixture with plastic to avoid a skin and then used half-and-half just before putting in the ice-cream maker. I served with a few blueberries and a sprig of mint! YOWZA!!

What amazing ice cream! A perfect balance of tang, sweetness and creaminess. It tastes like cold, creamy lemon curd. I think it is the best ice cream I have ever made. Two slight deviations from recipe: I eyeballed the zest--I used the zest from one lemon. And I mixed heavy cream and milk instead of the half-and-half.

This ice cream is so good but you need to double the recipe. I tried to cut a few calories so I used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 half & half. I also cut the sugar a little. Make this ice cream you won't regret it.

For those of you who have had trouble with "grainey" or curdled creame, know this: the fat content of the dairy product will determine the amount to which it will curdle if you are adding something acidic, in this case, lemon. If you are trouble with this, then switch half-and-half to full or "double" creame.

I have a Meyers lemon tree in my back yard and am always looking for ways to use my lemons. I made this recipe and was delighted at how easy and scrumptious this recipe is. This one is a keeper.

Made this last night to test out my new ice cream maker. What a wonderful refreshing summer dessert! Served it with fresh berries and everyone thought it was just great! Easy to make as well.

Easy and delicious. A perfect lemon ice cream. A nice change from lemon sorbet which I'm used to making and eating...

Deliciously tart! Used superfine baker's sugar to improve the texture--no graininess at all. Used 4 egg yolks instead of whole eggs, and substituted whipping cream for the half/half. I think it would be just as good with half/half however.

excellent! and very easy to make. my only complaint was maybe a little too much egg flavor -- next time i may try it with 2 eggs or 3 yolks instead of 3 whole eggs. left the zest in, that could be the grainyness that others mentioned; but i didnt mind it. once i cooked the custard before it cooled i put a piece of plastic wrap on top of the surface to prevent a skin from forming during cooling. could a skin have contributed to a grainy texture for some? only other complaint was the recipe didnt make enough for us -- next time i will have to double it!

Loved this ice cream--tastes like the inside of a lemon tart. Like other reviewers I used egg yolks and added all ingredients together and left zest in. I also used all whipping cream and a sugar substitute. I also froze in individual portions using silicon pans -- did some in mini bundt pans and some in a fluted cupcake pan. Wrapped them in saran wrap and popped in freezer ready for anyone who wants a quick snack--funny, there aren't any left!!

This is a wonderful and quick recipe. I served the icecream with a few raspberries and they complemented eachother very nicely. Absolutely a keeper!

I had an ice cream maker for over a year before I used it and now, because of this recipie, I use it all the time. Following other's advice I might start leaving the zest in. Lemon and ginger were made for each other but I often omit that step and serve it alone as a light.refreshing dessert. However, if making the cookie part of this recipie it needs more ginger. If time is tight, piick up Trader Joe's Ginger Snap cookies (I just happen to like theirs a lot - they're good and spicy!) and serve them along side a couple of sccops in a chilled martini glass. I bet it would be great on gingerbread waffles - hmmm?

Just made this. Wow! So yummy! The perfect blend of sweetness and tartness and very lemon-y. Was super easy to make. I left the lemon zest in and found it didn't affect the wonderful creaminess of the ice cream at all. This will be one of the most used ice cream recipes at my house from now on!

The taste was great but the texture was a bit grainy. The cream and milk (I used these instead of half and half) started looking a bit "lumpy" while they were cooking, and I wondered if perhaps the lemon juice had curdled it a bit (??) - although who knows - maybe the milk or cream was on its last leg or somthing. Regardless, I thought this might have accounted for the graininess of the final product. Next time I might try adding the lemon juice (but not the zest) once the mixture has cooled to room temp. Overall, this was very good, though!

Make your own Blue Moon Ice Cream!!! I have never found a decent recipe for this childhood favorite, so I modified this one by doubling the recipe, and adding the zest and juice from one lemon and one orange, and adding the juice from one of those half sized cans of crushed pineapple. I took the actually crushed pineapple and pureed it and added it as well. I subsituted all of that juice, "pulp", and zest and I think it came out about double the amount of juice and zest required. I think you could get away without using all the pulp--just squeeze all the juice out of it that you can. Don't be dismayed if your custard seems to curdle a bit. It still works, and is still creamy and luch. You wouldn't have to, but I did add some blue food coloring so my daughter would get the full effect of "blue moon". I froze this in two batches in my cuisinart ice cream maker. Sublime! Fantastic! Probably better than the commercial blue moon.

This is the first batch of ice cream I made with my Kitchenaid Ice Cream Maker attachment. It turned out really well, creamy and sweet with just the right amount of tartness.

This is the most incredible ice cream I've ever tasted. I made this over two years ago, and I'm just rating it now - in looking for a knock out recipe, remembered how wonderful this was, and looked it up! The cooked custard base makes this ice cream incomparably rich and creamy, but the richness is tempered perfectly by the tartness of the lemon. This is wonderful with either fresh raspberries, strawberries,a healthy sprig of mint, the gingersnaps, or, as I ate it, all by itself, the INSTANT it was frozen. My family went crazy for this! Wonderful, definitely a recipe to hold on to!

I make a lot of ice cream so I did this the usual way -- all the liquid in the pan with the zest, rther than adding more cream at the end. I also used egg yolks rather than whole eggs and whipping cream rather than half and half. All told, delicious -- creamy and tart. Just lovely.

I am a pastry chef and like to play around and try to improve recipes so I used 3 egg yolks instead of 3 whole eggs, a split vanilla bean instead of the 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used cream in place of the 1/2 and 1/2. It was spectacular! The perfect tartness.

Everyone at our party agreed this truly earns the 4 forks "dish beyond compare" rating. Texture is superb. Very simple, but good ingredients and technique will raise this above the crowd. My adaptions: (1) Used Meyers Lemons, and rubbed the zest into the sugar to release all the flavorful oil, until the sugar itself turned gold. (2) Used heavy cream instead of half and half, and added it all at the start, to let the lemon thoroughly permeate the cream. (3) Added the vanilla after taking the custard off the stove, so it would not evaporate away.

This was my first attempt at home made ice cream...Wow! I must say that it turned out better than I hoped it would! I used meyer lemons from my tree, and my kitchen aid mixer and freeze bowl. Creamy and Yummy, but a little too sweet! (hence the 3 forks) I would only suggest to use a little less sugar, as the cook from Boston did, next time I make it I will use 2/3 or 3/4 cup.

I just got a new Cuisinart ice cream maker and this is my favourite ice cream recipe (the Strawberry cheesecake is a close second).The big difference between store bought and homemade ice cream is the intensity of the flavour. This one will make you close your eyes and think "Lemon Meringue Pie"!!!!

1 cup of sugar sounded too much, so I used 3/4 cup. Perfect. I also substituted 1/4-1/3 cup heavy cream during the custard/cooking stage. The ice cream turned out so well--tart and creamy. Heavenly! Next time I will probably reduce the sugar even more, but only by a tb. or so.

WOW! On my first spoonful I thought it had to strong of a lemon flavor. When I continued to eat it, I couldn't stop. My husband and mother-in-law kept spooning into their bowls. It was creamy and refreshing. I used meyer lemons from my backyard and I plan on making it again this week.

Lemon ice cream couldn't get any better than this. Only change I made was using half heavy cream and half milk as half-and-half is not available here. A lovely, smooth combination of tart and sweet, and it's so easy!

This is a wonderful ice cream! It has become my staple dessert - most refreshing. One cook said that the hardest part was mincing the zest. I use a multi-hole zester to get long pieces of zest and don't mince it, since it has to be strained anyway. Very easy.

This, served alone or with a sprinkling of raspberries, is my signature summer dessert. I did not expect such a simple recipe to be so amazing.

I made this a few weeks back and thought it was perfect!!! It came out sweet, yet tangy, almost like a sorbet, which it was too creamy to be. It has just enough lemon to make your tongue tingle, but enough creaminess and sweetness to keep it balanced; keep it from being tart. My neighbors weren't crazy about it, because of the tartness, but my Mother-in-Law and Stepdaughter went ga-ga over it, and I'm making it again for my Mother In-Law. This is a perfect summer ice cream! It just goes to show you, some people have discriminating palates while others want what they know (from the store).

Wayyyy too sweet and lemony for me and my family - and we usually love ANYTHING with lemon flavor. What a disappointment.

Divine! The only change I made was I added 1 cup of HEAVY CREAM at the end instead of the remaining half & half. I have never before had such creamy homemade ice cream. Taste like something from HAGAN DAZ

I am not a lemon fan, however this ice cream is wonderful! It is smooth and creamy with a lemon flavor that isn't overdone. I made ice cream sandwiches using chewy ginger cookies, these worked better than the gingersnaps which were too crispy.

At first I thought I wouldn`t like this ice cream, but now on my fifth batch I think I am addicted! I just love the smooth tangy flavor.....even tried it with non fat yogurt in place of 1 cup of the half & half & it still tastes the same.

Without a doubt, this is the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. Admittedly, I am partial to anything lemon, and this was lemony. The texture was very fine grained and it was just absolutely yummy with the gingersnaps. (I didn't bother making the sandwiches, why wait?)

This one's a keeper. Easy to make (hardest part is mincing the zest) and the ice cream maker does all the work. I also liked the fact that the eggs are cooked. It has a strong lemon flavor and is rather tart but creamy, despite the lack of heavy cream. My guests loved it. I served it in a blue bowl with some lemon-shortbread bars. This would be ideal on a hot summer day.

My husband and son loved this....it tastes like the insides of a lemon meringue pie....I adlibed a bit and added more lemon peel...but we like a stong lemon flavor. I also use a Krups maker...my husband especially liked it fresh out of the maker....soft.

Forget the ice cream sandwiches. The gingersnaps are good but you can eat them on your own. The ice cream is outstanding however and beats anything you can buy in a store. I made it two weeks ago and am making it tonight for company. I have a Donvier maker which has been sitting in the frig overnight. Thus, I can make the ice cream in 20 minutes after making the ingredients this afternoon and cooling them.

For anyone who likes lemon, this may be the best ice cream they've ever tasted. Freeze slowly to avoid graininess.
