i haven't made this yet, so no forks, but brandy, unless specially made, is not allowed for passover

I have a friend that is lactose intolerant. So, I thought this would be a good recipe to try especially since he likes chocolate so much. I was put off by the other reviews at first. Then I realized that these reviews provided a great opportunity to improve the sorbet that I'd be making. I even changed it a bit more and the results were a great success. My change was to add a 4th egg yolk and before chilling the sorbet, I poured it through a chinois. This gave the sorbet a very creamy consistency. I can't wait to make it again!!!

I added 1 cup of water to this recipe. The results were beyond sensational. The recipe is soooo rich, you think you might be eating ice cream. The texture is pure velvet. My guest devoured it with delight asking for seconds and thirds.

This recipe is incorrect. There is way too much chocolate and not enough water for the sorbet to freeze, even after days in the freezer. We melted it down, added another CUP of water, and refroze it to get it close to the right consistency.
