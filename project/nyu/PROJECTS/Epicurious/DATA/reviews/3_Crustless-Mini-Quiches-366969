I used 9 eggs on a 12 muffin tray (coated lightly with olive oil) and added bits of bacon. Why not? With the heavy cream and all those eggs... Enjoyed by all!

This was a fantastic recipe. Like a user suggested, I used 8 whole eggs rather than the mixture of eggs and whites. For cheese used swiss and a pinch of parmesan. Also I choose broccoli and sun dried tomatoes as filler. They were delicious. I will definitely make them again.

Beautifully puffed. Used broccoli in half and cherry tomatoes in the others. Used for a buffet breakfast--they were very popular.

I changed this by using 8 whole eggs instead of the 6 eggs and 6 yolks, and used caramelized onion and gruyere (because the whole point of quiche is to use up what you have) I ended up with enough custard for 24 mini and 4 (4") mini tart pan quiche (for which I used a crust). The main problem I had was that the mini quiche without crust stuck horribly and would not have been suitable for serving to guests. I had to literally scoop them out with a spoon and soak the mini tart pans for a few hours to loosen up what remained. I used almost new, non stick mini tart pans and sprayed them liberally with nonstick cooking spray (Pam professional high heat) I can't imagine that extra egg yolks give this recipe some magical pan releasing qualities. Maybe it was because cheddar is more greasy than gruyere... who knows. They still tasted amazing (because caramelized onions and gruyere), but the presentation left a lot to be desired. Will not try again.

This was really good and easy. For those confused about the recipe, you CAN cook 1 tbsp on the stove to check the seasoning, but there's no need to cook anything on the stove. You just pour it into the muffin tins and cook in the oven. I made with just egg mixture and cheese for the kids and with cherry tomatoes and cheese for the adults. Big hit all around.

I was completely unimpressed with this recipe. It sounded good, but I just took mine out of the oven, and they are simply not servable. I will now be up until the wee hours trying to come up with a replacement appetizer for an event tomorrow (whatever I make, it is NOT likely to come from epicurious). My only consolation is that I can leave this review and warn others.

I have created a similar recipe that does not use dairy or wheat. Mine is yummier, easier and way more healthy than this one. Since I can eat feta that's the cheese I use in mine along with turkey sausage. Here 'tis if you want to try it. Let me know if you do! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/SHOSHS-MINI-BREAKFAST-QUICHE-50149747

I adjusted a similar recipe so it has no cow's dairy or wheat. I added crumbled feta and substituted turkey sausage. My recipe is healthier, yummier, easier & makes 12 that I freeze to take out for b'fst or a protein snack. They disappear from the freezer. If interested I'll try to post here or?

I agree with the comments of the last reviewer. The directions are confusing with respect to cooking the egg mixture.

I think this recipe needs further editing. It appears there are some causes for misunderstanding. Example: Cook 1 T. of mixture and transfer to large glass measuring pitcher(?) Okay, then what? Does that mean you just take 1 T and use as a test for seasoning and then discard? Why can't you just mix everything and use a small ladle to fill muffin cups? It also seems that there is too much volume for the number of muffin cups or else there is enough for 48 instead of 24. Then six muffins per persons seems a very large serving!

I think there is a mistake in the recipe..6 yolk and 6 whole eggs for the amount of liquid. Has anybody tried this recipe?

I believe the photo shows a 12 cup mini tray, of which you would use two. Note the size of the paring knife in comparison with the toppings.

I havent made this, but the recipe says 24-cup mini-muffin trays, but the pic definitely shows a 12-cup regular muffin tray  and it seems like the minis would be so small you couldnt fit any toppings at all. anyone tried it either way?
