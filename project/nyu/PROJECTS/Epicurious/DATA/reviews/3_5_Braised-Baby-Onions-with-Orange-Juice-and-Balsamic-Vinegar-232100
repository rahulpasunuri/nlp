I use these all the time, great with a cheese platter, great with all types of meat. Trader Joes now has pre-peeled cipolline onions in the produce section so we can make these on the spur of the moment !

These are always a hit with guests and perfect alongside roasted meats.

Look for Sweet-and-sour Onion Topping. It's better, and works well as a side dish or chutney.

Not nearly as good as the sweet and sour onions for crostini

Yes the peeling of the onions is time consuming but you forget all about that when the aroma wafts through the kitchen while cooking. Will make again for sure.

I made this to go with a marinated leg of lamb and it was excellent except for one thing; a little too oily for my taste. I will make this again, but cut down the oil to 2Tbsp. Other than that, the sweet, slightly tangy flavor went beautifully with the lamb. For those who are having difficulty peeling pearl onions - Do blanch them, trim root end and remove the outer layer of skin. When you brown them in the olive oil you may see a few that still have a white papery skin on them. Simply lift them out, let them cool for a second and remove that skin. Return to skillet and continue browning. Simple.

To peel the onions, blanch them, cut the root end off (not too much) then "pinch" the other end forcing the inner bulb out. Good luck! I have yet to make these but am looking foreward to it. Sounds like it would be great with a roast.

Great dish, and pretty unusual - just onions and all. I used red and white pearl onions, which was really beautiful. Only qualm was all the peeling time. Other than that, really delicious.

I served this at a dinner party, and everyone loved them! I got so many requests for the recipe. THe presentation was beautiful, as well. The only downfall was that it took so long to peel the onions, but everything else was very, very simple for awesome results.

I have made this side dish several times. It is easy and delicious. It can be served at room temperature as well as hot. If you are pressed for time use the frozen small whole onions.

I made these as soon as I saw them in the magazine and have been searching the site for them ever since. Really good little snack. I'm going to make them for a dinner party this week.

These onions were just delicious. Don't waste your precious time peeling these onions. Buy them frozen. Brought them as an hors d'oeuvre to a party they were a hit! They are also yummy with meat.

I have made this recipe at least 3 times and really love it. The problem is finding the cippoline onions. They are definitely worth using as they are very sweet. But apparently they mold quickly, so our local gourmet grocery store does not like to carry them.

I made this dish right away when I received the magazine. I made it again on Mother's Day and my family and friends LOVE it. I will make this forever. Simply delicious!

I was stuck on Memorial day looking for cipolline onions as the pearl onions looked iffy. I ended up using frozen pearl onions which picked up the flavor but ultimately did not have the right consistency. Will try again when I can find the right onions. It made a lot of onions!

I made this recipe for a supper club dish and it was very well received. I would definitely make it again, although the onions were quite an investment because I doubled the recipe. Has anyone tried it with frozen pearl onions? I bet they would be less expensive.

The balsamic glaze was fantastic - I'm thinking of making just the glaze again to use over chicken breast or other meats. We liked the onions, but, it was the glaze that really made the dish.

Made these yesterday as a side for a prime rib roast and really enjoyed them. Used pearl onions and added 2 cloves minced garlic, fresh cracked pepper and a sprinkling of fleur de sel, otherwise followed the recipe. Flavour and aroma were heavenly and onions had a luscious caramelized coating. A novel way to make and serve these wee gems. Enjoy!
