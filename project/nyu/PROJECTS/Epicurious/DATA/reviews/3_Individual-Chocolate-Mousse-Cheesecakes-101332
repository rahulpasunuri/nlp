Oh, I just submitted my comment and when I looked at the other reviews I see that someone else cleared up the title!

How can this be a cheesecake? There's no cheese in it!

I haven'te tried this recipe yet, but would like to add that the title above is a typo! The title for this recipe in Bon Appetit magazine is "Individual Chocolate Mousse Cakes".

Chocolate Lovers' Heaven! Personally, I thought this recipe was great...although perhaps a bit rich. I would recommend serving after a very light meal and perhaps garnish with a fruit coulis/sauce. I served it with fresh raspberries which brought on the flavor of the chocolate quite nicely! You should definitely try this recipe!

I tried this recipe just for fun and took some for my family and they request it everytime I make dessert

the conclusion of a few dessert lovers was that this was not one to make again

shouldn't a 'cheescake' have cream cheese (or mascarpone)somewhere?!!! sounds good though - may have to give it a try sometime.

Cheesecake? Its not a recipe like I have ever seen for cheesecake. However, it is a must try. The resulting product was light and fluffy like a cheesecake with a great rich flavor. We served this dish with a port coffee sauce.
