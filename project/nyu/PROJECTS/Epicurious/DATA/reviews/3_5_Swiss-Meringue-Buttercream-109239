for those of you concerned about food safety and the ability of this frosting to hang out at room temp, PLEASE cook your egg whites to the recommended 160 degrees. this will pasteurize the whites and make them safe to sit out.

Changed it a little to accomodate warm temps and lesson the butter flavor. Used 6 sticks of unsalted butter, one stick of salted, and one stick (1 cup) shortning. Worked like a charm. Easiest part of this entire wedding!

I had been on the search for the "perfect" butter cream recipe, and I finally found it with this. I don't really care for overly sweet butter creams, and I really love the taste of the butter to come through. I am far from an "experienced" baker, but I found this recipe to very easy to execute and pretty much fool-proof. Next time, I would probably reduce the amount of butter and sugar maybe by half. It makes a LOT of frosting, and the texture was a bit heavier than I considered ideal, but it is an excellent recipe. I would definitely make it again!

I made this recipe just using 1 pound of butter and about 3/4C sugar with 4 egg I was freaked out when I started incorporating the first half of the butter. The beautiful marshmallow fluff I created collapsed and it looked like it was curdling but after mixing it up for a few more minutes it looked beautiful buttercream frosting. I was making a chocolate cake so I needed this frosting to be chocolate as well. I started adding 4 oz of melted chocolate cooled down before adding it to the frosting. I also added about 1 T of a high quality coffee liquor to give it some depth. I didn't feel it had enough chocolate flavor so I added another 4 oz of melted dark chocolate to the frosting (total chocolate added was 8oz) I then found that the frosting wasn't sweet enough so I ended up adding about 1tsp of powdered sugar to balance out the frosting. Some notes: There's no need to heat the egg whites with the sugar. If you get the sugar to about 170 degrees and then slowly pour the hot liquid sugar into your standing mixer whisking your egg whites you will get the same marshmallow fluff effect.

This recipe was awesome! I did not need to frost my entire family, just a 3 layer orange cake, so I used the 10 egg whites and 1.5 pounds butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar. The flavoring was orange extract and Grand Marnier. Delicious!

I am a pastry student at our local college and this is the exact recipe we use everyday. A few hints. The whites do not have to be heated to 160 degrees. That is only if you are making a cream or custard. The white/sugar mixture only has to be heated until all the sugar crystals are melted. Make sure your butter is soft, not microwaved. Plan ahead. Also when whipping the whites/sugar whip on high speed. The idea is to get as much volume as possible. Whip to stiff peaks.It is difficult to overwhip the meringue.It will take at least 10 minutes for the meringue to cool down to room temperature. If it is still too warm the butter will melt and you will have soup. I usually check by placing my clean finger into the center of the meringue. Add butter in large amounts (about 1/2 cup at a time) to the meringue mixture when cool so it wont melt. Dont overwhip at this point. You only have to barely mix the butter in. Then after all the butter is added whip on high until the buttercream becomes thick and holds a stiff peak. It will get soft initially but in a minute or two it will thicken beautifully. This is shelf stable for 5 days meaning it needs no refrigeration. It will keep in the refrigerator for 3 weeks and in the freezer for at least 3 months. Just bring to room temp and then rewhip before using it. Please dont skip the rewhip step. As to the rewiewer who mentioned whole eggs that is classic French buttercream and the eggs MUST be brought to 160 degrees before whipping. The fat in the eggs is what can spoil. Swiss buttercream is a totally different critter.

I have tried other meringue buttercream recipes and this is by far the easiest and yields the best result. This make a HUGE amount of frosting though. (I reduced the recipe by a third and used about 1/3 of that to ice a two layer nine inch cake.)

super recipe! i almost turned away from this recipe because of the whisking over the simmering water (call me lazy...), but it is SO worth the 5 minutes of double-boiling. just as the other reviewers say, this icing is sweet, but not too sweet. and it makes a butt-load (i filled 3 large yogurt containers to store in the fridge!), so be ready to frost everything in sight! i'm making a 2-layer 1/4 sheet cake, so i think it should cover that without a problem. hooray for baking!!

I use Swiss Buttercream for every cake I bake. It is always a hit! I have "doctored" the recipe so that it is still smooth and delicious, but loses some of the overwhelming butteriness. I use 12 large egg whites, 3 cups granulated sugar, and 2 lbs unsalted butter. The consistency is perfect for frosting and decorating. Even if you have sworn off this recipe due to the butteriness, retry it with these changes.

way too much butter. i think the ingredient proportions from other recipes are better.

Great recipe, nice and light. I added 1TB Orange Extract, 2TB Grand Marnier and 1 TB of orange zest and put it on chocolate cupcakes. Everyone loved it. Although after re-reading the rest of the reviews I would probably leave out some of the butter next time...maybe only use 1 lb for a 1/2 recipe. Before I added the flavorings all I could taste was butter!

This buttercream is delicious, not too sweet and super easy to make. It is now my favorite.

I actually got an account on this website to review this particular recipe. As a professional cake decorator I use this recipe every single time--it never fails!!! I LOVE it and so do my customers! I often cover cakes in fondant and this buttercream is sweet enough to stand on it's own, or paired with the fondant it's not overly sweet. It has a perfect texture for decorating, it takes colors well, it hardens up quickly in the fridge, it freezes wonderfully--you can't go wrong with it!

This makes a really nice buttercream, but you don't need that much butter. I made a double batch to do seven buche de noel and I had at least 1 1/2 lbs of butter left. I made it by the method I know, which is to whip the whites until cool, and then add the softened butter and whip until it emulsifies. It came together well before all the butter was added.

Excellent recipe but the eggs should be at 160 degrees, NOT 140 degrees to kill any possible pathogens (salmonella).

This buttercream is amazing!!!!! I've made other buttercreams before but this one by far takes the cake!!!!!!! Very smooth and for sure an adult pleaser!

I reviedwed this below - and I tried lots of frostings preparing for my daughter's birthday. I ended up trying the Cooks Illustrated recipe for "Classic Vanilla Buttercream" which got rave reviews. Several people commented on how good the frosting was, that it was the best they ever had. The key is that it uses whole eggs - but otherwise the method is pretty similar to this one. You heat the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt over a water bath until it hits 160, then transfer to the mixer and beat for several minutes before adding all the butter. It was light and fluffy and tasted wonderful. The egg yolks of course mean that the frosting is not quite as white, but the color was still a fine backdrop for decorating.

This was much easier to make than I expected. It came together beautifully and I think tasted fine - for a buttercream. Maybe it works for a wedding cake but really I suspect buttercream frostings are one of the main reasons nobody likes wedding cakes. I'm probably not sophisticated enough to appreciate buttercream, but I think I'm going to go with a cream cheese frosting for my daughter's birthday cake because I don't think kids are, either!.

I don't usually use buttercream icing but this was great. I used it for my daughter's birthday cake. It went on very smooth and was not too sweet. I would maybe add a little more flavor than called for in the recipe.

I used this buttercream for a wedding cake and I loved it! It's better than other buttercreams I've used before because the meringue base makes it a little lighter, but it's still very nice to work with and holds up very well. I used half the vanilla and mixed 1.5 oz rum, and 1.5 oz frangelico for flavoring. I used it in a champagne white cake, with two layers of this buttercream inside, and a mocha buttercream on the outside, and covered it all with a layer of marzipan, everyone loved it! This would also be great for any basic birthday cake! I'll try different flavoring for fun next time.

Swiss meringue buttercream is the best there is, but I find there's too much butter in this recipe for my taste. I'd use only 1.75 lbs butter for this many eggs (for a 2-layer cake, I'd use 7 egg whites, 12 oz. sugar, and 1 lb. butter). The problem with making this is a tendency to rush: you must beat the egg whites slowly (I do it a little less than medium-high) and then to add the butter SLOWLY. You're making an emulsion, like mayonnaise, and if you go too fast, it will break. On the other hand, you must also have patience after adding all the butter; it can take up to 10 minutes for the emulsion to occur and the buttercream to thicken. But once it does, it's magical (and, if done properly, it will hold up fine unless the temperature gets over 80). Finally, don't be afraid to try other flavorings: my favorite is to add a few ounces of all-fruit cherry spread, or 6 oz. of white chocolate.

I am a pastry student where Toba teaches and in class we added the vanilla and rum (not one or the other). I don't even like rum but I could not keep my fingers out of the bowl, it was so delicious and perfect for decorating too because it holds up well. I think the alcolol is very important because otherwise as with many buttercreams it's like eating straight butter.

This was just what I was looking for...Easy to make, tasty and so smooth/spreadable. Using to decorate cookies at a 3 yr old birthday party. I made 1/2 recipe and divided into three different colors. I'm not a cook but leaving the butter out a couple of hours seemed to insure a smooth frosting. Also, I was surprised how quickly the temp jumped to 140*.
