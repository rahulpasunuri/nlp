This orange lattice crust is my go-to recipe for all fruit pies - peach, apple and berry. It's great for a novice baker. It was my first homemade crust ever, and I return to it when I need to make sure my crust will be perfect.

I made straight apple pie, without the dried fruit. The slight citrus flavor the orange juice added to a normally bland crust was great. It was served it at a Thanksgiving gathering, and everyone loved it.

The best apple pie recipe from Epicurious! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I highly recommend it.

Very much enjoyed the pie as a 'change' from the same 'ol same 'ol. Cardomon adds a lovely flavour but the dried fruit seemed almost non-existant. In the future I will use sugar instead of honey and perhaps use an old fashion recipe for crust.

Ok, I made this again--four times. It's wonderful! The crust is perfect everytime, and the fruit ads a nice zing when you bite into a piece. I still don't like the honey though, I use sugar to taste. The best apple pie ever!

A great pie. The fresh orange juice added a unique flavor to the crust. Chilling the pie dough in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes is all it takes. Also, I eliminated all the fruit except the apples and the pie was still delicious. Adding a small amount of brandy or apple brandy adds to the flavor.

This is a great pie. It's time consuming but worth the work.
