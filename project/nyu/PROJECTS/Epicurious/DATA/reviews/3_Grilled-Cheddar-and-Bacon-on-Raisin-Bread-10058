I was SO disappointed in this--used bakery bread, good cheddar, crisp bacon, looked so forward to it. It was a big calorie-laden yawn at our house.

I made this for my husband and 98 year old mother for Valentine's day lunch. It was great. She ate her whole sanwich!

This is one of the best comfort foods EVER! I variation that I like is to substitute a generous spreading of chunky-style apple sauce and topping it with the cheddar.
