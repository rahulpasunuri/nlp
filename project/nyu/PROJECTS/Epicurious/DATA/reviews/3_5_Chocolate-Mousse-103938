Excelent!! I followed the directions to a T and used Lindt 60% cacao chocolate. The result was a rich delicious mousse. This will be my go to recipe fromnow on, quick, easy and so impressive!

I found this recipe much too rich. We couldn't eat more than a few spoonfuls. I won't make it again, most likely find a recipe that includes whipping cream to lighten it up.

I've made this mousse multiple times to use as a filling for Epicurious' "Double Chocolate Cake" recipe. It's rich, it's fabulous on it's own, combined with the cake and it's chocoholics dream come true.

I am lactose intolerant, so I'm always looking for desserts that I can enjoy. (The higher the butter fat content the lower the lactose - that is why I can eat butter but not other dairy products.) This recipe is decadent enough to last me from one special occasion to the next.

Delicious! Made for Christmas and was very impressed. It did take longer than 3 minutes for the egg mixture to come up to temperature other than that was quite an easy recipe. I agree that using the best chocolate possible makes a huge difference, the higher the cacao percentage the better. Served with fresh raspberries and we were in chocolate heavan.

I have made this recipe every Christmas since it came out in September 2000. It has worked perfectly every time, is super easy and SO impressive when served. I definitely recommend serving fresh whipped cream (it is SO rich) and have also made fresh pizzelle to serve alongside. Best tip: use the highest quality bittersweet chocolate to get the best flavor (NOT chocolate chips--egad) my personal favorite: Scharffen Berger. Then sit back and let your guests marvel at what a great cook you are!!

Very very rich, but gorgeous. The key is to keep the servings small, and serve with some fresh, whipped cream.

This dessert was good, but I agree with the others reviewers - it was very rich ! (and dense).

This is a really rich dessert that is so easy to make. I replaced the water with Kahlua which made it extra rich. I served it in martini glasses topped with raspberries, whipped cream and chocolate shavings...it looked amazing. The recipe says it serves 6 but I think it could easily serve 10. I will definately make this dessert again.

This was delicious! I made it for a group of chocolate lovers--it was rich for me, but they thought it was perfect. I did sub semi-sweet for bittersweet chocolate, which probably made it even sweeter--next time will use the bittersweet. Really easy, from one who is not great at making desserts!

This mousse was delicious! My friends all raved about the richness of the flavor. (I used Ghirardelli chocolate.) The one mistake I made was that rather than 'cooling' the chocolate mixture, I chilled it...a bit too much. I stirred it to warm it up and get the texture back to smooth, but it still had little bits of cooled choc throughout. (I was rushing!) So when I folded in the egg whites, I had to stir more than I should have rerducind the volume. This gave me 5 servings rather than 8. Of course,they were 5 REALLY rich servings! And although I didn't get the light mousse I wanted, I got a great tasting dessert!

I really liked the taste and texture of this mousse. I have also tried the Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse and I prefer this one - it is richer and more dense (and more fatty as the other recipe uses milk rather than butter or cream). I ended up heating the egg mixture about 6 minutes rather than the 3 stated. By adding a splash of alcohol you can really enhance this mousse!

I made this for a dinner party and served the mousse in martini glasses. I added whipped cream, two raspberries and a sprig of mint to each glass. The dessert looked great and everyone seemed to love it. I would make this again for sure!

Made it for a party and everyone loved it! Very rich and tasty... just make sure that after you add the cohoclate to keep stirring until COMPLETELY smooth. I took it off a bit too soon and it ended a tiny bit grainy, but that was my own fault. A great recipe!

I have made this as a dessert for 2 BBQs. It is very rich and very popular. It is a very simple recipe.

Definitely a great dessert for chocolate lovers! I whipped some cream and added it to the mousse mixture. As a previous reviewer mentioned, American mousses are much lighter, and that was the result I was looking for. Served it atop a moist chocolate cake. It was great! A little too rich for me, but our guests loved it.

Served it on New Years Eve to a party of almost 20 with a cranberry red wine sauce to high approval from everyone.

I've never made a mousse from scratch before, but this one turned out really well. It's rich and creamy. Great for chocolate lovers!

A splash at my last dinner party. I added a little espresso in place of the some of the water and it gave it that little extra something.

Easy and delicious. The bowl was licked clean at my last party

Take the time to make this delicious recipe -- and to cut the richness (if that`s a problem), simply divide it among 9 ramekins instead of 6 bowls. It is a true mousse with substance -- more dense than Americanized mousses which are all air.

I give it thumbs up. It was very light and none of my guest had to go to the hospital the next day for samonella. I would definitely make this again.

Have not made this recipe and would not make it. As a person with a comprimised immune system I shy away from anything that has uncooked egg in it. Isn't there a substitution for raw egg?

I was not pleased at all with the outcome of this mousse. It was very dense and sticky, like old gelato, and was not light or fluffy. Plus, it was too rich, even for me, a serious chocaholic.

My husband, who is a chocolate fanatic, loved it. However, it can be a bit rich for those without a chocolate tooth. I could barely finish half of mine.

I've made this twice. The first time, it was perfect. The second time, the mousse was grainy. Think I overbeat the eggs. Use Valrhona chocolate for a simply delicious experience. This a perfect recipe for lactose intolerant people.
