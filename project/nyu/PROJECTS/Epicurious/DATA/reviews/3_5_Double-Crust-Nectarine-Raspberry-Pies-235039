We and our guests loved this pie. Made it again that very week for another party! It's a summertime favorite and definitely do consider making both pies if you are serving a crowd - they will want seconds!

delicious! everyone loved this pie. made it with a lattice top and only a shortening crust (didn't have enough butter on hand). I did not deviate from the original recipe in any other way. I will be making this pie again.
