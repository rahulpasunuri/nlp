I made this with fresh parsley and it was delicious. My husband loved it, too. This is lovely with a nice glass of white wine. Notes: (1) I highly recommend replacing the arugula with parsley. If you do this, be sure (as is noted in the recipe) to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup. Any more would be too much. (2) I used *less* than the 1 lb of pasta it called for (I think using an entire pound would spread the pesto too thin). (3) I only needed 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid when tossing with the pesto. (4) I agree with a previous reviewer that it's worth the investment in a good Parmigiano-Reggiano. (5) A little more of the cheese grated on top is a nice finishing touch. Enjoy!

Fantastic and simple! Only thing I changed was I added some wild mushrooms and cherry tomatoes at the end. Company worthy dish - will be making again.

This was delicious, and easy to make. I've made this twice. The first time I used about half arugula half parsley, and the second I used all arugula. I preferred the version with half parsley. It helped to cut some of the bitterness of the arugula. I found that the leftover pesto kept pretty well in the fridge for a week. Don't leave off the extra toasted pecans. They really bring it all together.

Tossed it with some chestnut fettucine that I had made earlier and dried. Topped it with lardons. Very nice.

I made this using whole wheat pasta and loved it. A great vegetarian dish full of protein and good fat. I will definitely make it again.

I have arugula still growing in my garden and wanted to try it in a pasta dish. Tried this recipe and it was a hit. I wouldn't change anything except that I did not need to add the pasta water as indicated. Definitely to be repeated.

This tasted like grass clippings. I like arugula in salads and other recipes, so that's not the issue. But prepared this way... no thanks! We tried to cover the taste by smothering the linguine with grated romano. That helped a little, but we still couldn't finish it.

Saw recipe, then read the reviews. Have a bumper crop of arugula at moment. Used bunches of young leaves and added some mature ones for the bitter, peppery flavour. Used more parmesan than recipe specifies. It was a delicious linguine. I had oven-roasted chicken and the two went very well together. I will certainly make it again. Husband agrees. Just do not use all mature leaves, which WILL make it too bitter. In fact, it was fairly bland with the young leaves. As to the person who objected to the "green" sauce ... What colour did you expect it to be?? It's bright green and really attractive. Great recipe, and even better with a few more roasted pecans.

Gorgeous! The toasted pecans really make it. I threw in some parsley and used it with wild mushroom ravioli instead of plain pasta, and it was truly amazing. Be warned though, that you need to eat it all straight away - like a lot of salads, the arugula (or rocket as it's called in the UK) doesn't hold up. I made pesto toasts the next night and had to bin the lot.

I liked the pesto, being a fan of arugula. My husband, however, thought it was a little bitter. Considering how quick and easy it was to prepare, I may overlook his complaints.

Well, the point about TJs (and the reason it inspires such loyalty) is that it *isn't* overpriced, in fact, most things are very high quality and cheaper than supermarket, unlike Dean & Deluca, etc (of course, their quality is high as well, but so are their prices). I'm a total TJ addict. And oh yeah, I love this recipe and will definitely make again (after a trip to TJ, natch).

My goodness, folks, calm down! I didn't mean to incite such vitriolic responses to my remark about Trader Joe's. I merely sarcastically joked that TJ must be paying people to mention them by name so often on this website (an indirect compliment, in fact). I made no attacks on them, on Californians, or on chain food stores. Maybe Trader Joe's IS putting chemicals in their products to create a secret army of "foodies" to wipe out Citarella, Dean & DeLuca, etc., and become the nation's sole provider of over-priced produce, baked goods, and boutique olive oils. How diabolical!

I'm not quite sure why Californians get lumped into such generalized negative terms and all sorts of people feel it's appropriate to take pot shots at us. But the dig about Californians and Trader Joe's is totally uncalled for. It's sad that the standard-timer from NYC does not have a Trader Joe's in her own backyard for she'd certainly be shopping there. Trader Joe's scours the planet (or just about) for wonderful food, wine, and housewares at the most incredible inexpensive prices one can imagine. Here's an example: Trader Joe's just bought up a huge amount of wine from a company that was going out of business and now TJ's is passing those savings on to us. Very good wines for way under $10. As-a-matter-fact, Trader Joe's ALWAYS has amazing deals on wine. Oh, and I don't know whether this is just a California thing - but every single employee of Trader Joe's is helpful, cheerful, and amazingly pleasant. So IF someone from CALIFORNIA is plastering Trader Joe's name all over this site - then it is certainly well-deserved. Oh - and in the spirit of the season , you really need to apologize for your unwarranted comments.

To Eastern Standard Time FYI: Trader Joe's is found across the country. And there's no need to be so snotty about living in the City since Manhattan now has as many chain stores as any suburb. You might be seeing Trader Joe's in NYC the near future. And, you might even enjoy it!

I have to stick up for the cook from Eastern Standard Time: I've never heard of Trader Joe's either. Those of us who can't afford to own a car in the NYC area aren't likely to make it to NJ, Westchester, or Boston for our grocery shopping--these places aren't exactly our "backyards." Go ahead and mention your chain if you want to, but don't be surprised when it doesn't make sense to somebody. People all over the globe visit this site.

I am a "fly over" - neither on east or west coast (Chicago, actually). Trader Joe's grocery store has been here for 4 years and is a god-send for those obscure hard to find items that I used to have to go to specialty shops and pay a fortune for. Their cheese section is fabulous for those Franco-philes in search of some of those rich creamy French cheeses. For the person in the eastern time zone with the attitude problem...try it, you may like it! If not, keep your negativity to your self...there is enough that in the world already! Regarding the arugula, when young and tender it is very mild. As the leaves grow larger and more mature, they gain that peppery, almost bitter flavor. So if you want the spice, look for the older, tougher leaves. For those of you that garden, arugula is the earliest crop I harvest in late spring. It grows like a weed. I sow in batches all summer to keep a constant supply.

To the cook from Eastern Standard Time: In our "extended neighborhood" Trader Joe's can be found in Scarsdale, NY and Darien, CT and as an aside, it's far from being upscale.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but for the east-coaster from NYC who was rude to the Californian who dared to mention Trader Joe's: look in in your own backyard! Check out the Trader Joe's in Westwood, NJ next time you venture over the GWB. PS: "upscale" is a laughable term to describe Trader Joe's!!

To the Cook from Eastern Standard Time....Trader Joe's has a couple of stores in Boston - you know...that city on the East Coast. Maybe you have your eyes closed ;o)

Haven't tried this but love arugula & grow it in winter & spring. By early summer in FL, if the weather has warmed up to mid 80s, the leaves become bitter & inedible, as do many leafy vegetables here. Perhaps that's why one reviewer's dish was too bitter to eat.

It appears that the freshness of the arugula affects this recipe -- fresher arugula is more pungent and the sauce could dress twice the pasta. And, for those looking for reasonably fresh herb at a cheap price, go to Trader Joe's if you have one nearby.

This recipe was very bitter due to the amount of arugula. If you're an arugula fan - you'll be happy!

The amount of pesto that 10 oz. of arugula makes completely overwhelms 16 oz. of pasta. I would have liked this better if I had used half of the pesto instead of dumping it all in the pot and finding out it was too much. I also needed to increase the salt to 1 tsp. It does have an interesting flavor but the color (so bright!) and the abundance of pesto was offputing. I won't even tell you what my kids said :)

Man oh man, I sure liked the nutty texture the pecans gave to this "tasty" use of arugula. By all means the use of a real authentic parmasean/reggiano and the "touch" is a wonderful cap to this "do it again" dish. Of course it helps if you have someone like my significant other hitting the switches on the cuisinart.

I grow my own arugula and thought that 10 oz. was very overwhelming. It was bitter, the dish was entirely green not at all like the picture. I used only the young tender plants but it was too much.

To a Cook from San Carlos, CA: In response to your question, it's called "rocket" b/c the leaves are shaped like rockets. But I liked your tongue-in-cheek explanation! Well said!

I wasn't "wowed" with the result, but I liked this enough to try again. I used hydroponic arugula - nice, clean and no tough stems - but lacking the peppery punch I was looking for. I'll look for bunched arugula next time, and reserve some of the smaller leaves to add whole to the finished dish. I tried to save a few dollars by using a good quality domestic Parmesan on hand, but now think I should have splurged on imported cheese. I liked the roasted pecans - gives the dish a nice, nutty flavor. I usually increase the garlic in recipes as a matter of course, but stuck with one large clove, and it was just enough. I'll make this again.

It's called rocket in the UK and Australia b/c in France it's called Roquette. I find it's great in many pastas just thrown in at the end to wilt from the heat of the pasta, kind of like getting your salad and your pasta in one dish.

I haven't tried this recipe either, but it looks good. Try growing arugula with seeds - does very well in a pot, and oh, so much less expensive than in a grocery store.

To cook from San Carlos.. Go to Trader Joe's for the arugula. They have baby arugula in bags and it's much better than buying it in bunches.

Arugula questions: 1. Why is arugula always so expensive? It is typically $2 for a 3- or 4-oz (snail-eaten, woody, and wilted) bunch, putting it on par with herbs such as basil and thyme. In restaurants, it is much cheaper and fresher. 2. Why do the Brits call it "rocket"? Is this a nod to its astronomical price?
