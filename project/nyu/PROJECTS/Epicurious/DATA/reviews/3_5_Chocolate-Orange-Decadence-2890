I made this cake for my son's 16th birthday. I did not like all the orange rind throughout the cake, glaze and in the ganache. The recipe is very expensive - with $16.00 for chocolate, 10.00 for raspberries, plus all the other ingredients. The Bittersweet chocolate ganache is very dense and too intense for even me - and I love dark chocolate... (I used ghirardelli 60% bittersweet). The cake was gorgeous when finished and I made it exactly but the taste was disappointing. I baked the cake for 25 minutes and was slightly dry. I would not make it again - there are too many other recipes that are better, cheaper, easier!!

I misplaced my recipie from the Bon Appetit 1990 issue and was so excited to find it again! This dense cake has so many wonderful flavors it keeps you busy and everyone in my family loved it. It is wonderfully sinful and worth the expense. (You do have to be careful not to overcook the cake so set your timer a little early to prevent the cake from becoming dry.) Don't skimp on the ingredients...you will be rewarded.

Delicious! However, be careful not to over-bake. 38 minutes in the oven is way too long. Mine was ready in less than 25 minutes! If you overbake, it will be dry.

This was okay. The chocolate orange ganache was absolute heaven, but the cake itself was on the dry and heavy side. Also, I could have done without the raspberries. I'll make the ganache again, but with a different cake recipe next time.

This is an extravagant cake! Worth every minute. Definately a special occasion cake. I used the orange juice but next time I will use the Grand Marnier. The combination of chocolate, orange, and raspberry... fabulous. I baked the cake in two 9" pans so I wasn't able to make 4 layers. Wasn't a problem.

Very time consuming, but worth the wait. Needs to be eaten soon, doesn't store well.

30 ounces of chocolate??? Is this correct? I'd appreciate knowing prior to spending my paycheck on chocolate!

Man, I hope this is the recipe. I remember making the magazine cover chocolate cake with raspberries for a friends birthday in January as the elder Bush was beginning the Gulf War. I've lost the magazine and found this recipe here. I thought that I remembered a chocolate cake with the orange peel, the ganache, a mousse like stuff and the raspberries. But the Gulf War started Jan 1991, so the timing is right for it to be this one. It was tons of work; but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO delicious and have had a request for it again.

This was a very very rich cake, but it was also very good. This is definitely a "special occasion" cake. The name decadence really says it all.

This is a complicated and time consuming recipe, however, it is well worth it! The pairing of orange, raspberry and chocolate is #1 in my book. Elegant dessert! My boyfriend took it to work and EVERYONE L-O-V-E-D it!

I usually like rich desserts, but this one was too rich for me- the cake was so heavy it was almost like fruitcake. A lot of work for a dessert of which I could only eat a tiny bit.

Takes a long time to make this but definitely worth it. Great for special occasions - be careful - people request again!
