It was great! I too used wine instead of vermouth, and probably a little more cheese, but not over the top. I used canned quartered artichoke hearts - previous comments referred to 'stringy' artichokes, but I had no issues. I topped it with Chives, green onions and blue cheese. Nice starter to a Beef Tenderloin dinner.

This soup is incredible. I had all the ingredients on hand so we tried it for dinner tonight, and it was a huge, huge hit in our house. The only change I made was using 2 6.5oz jars of marinated artichoke hearts, dumping the entire contents into the soup and then cutting the chicken stock back to 2.5 cups.

I have made this many, many times and it always turns out great! It is quick and easy, and tastes like it cooked all day. I often serve it in mugs around the fireplace in winter months, with some type of bruschetta. This is one of my last-minute "go to" recipes.

I made this last night for a dinner party. Out of 6 dishes it was the favorite. 3 forks due to my alterations: I used shallots instead of onions, chardonnay instead of vermouth, regular chicken stock, and likely used extra blue cheese as I didn't measure it & tend to have a heavy hand when it comes to cheese. I also added some blue cheese, pepper & chives on top. I didn't strain it & it was fine.

Easy to make and especially tasty if you use really flavorful chicken stock (not the canned stuff). Filling and perfect for a winter lunch or dinner.

This was FABULOUS and very easy! One change I made was to use canned artichoke bottoms (aka crowns) rather than artichoke hearts. This eliminated any leafy or stringy parts, which some reviewers mentioned being a problem. The other change I made was to drizzle a tiny bit of truffle oil over the top, along with a small mound of crumbled Maytag and chives, as the recipe suggested. Everyone loved this, I will definitely make it again!

I hae made this recipe over a dozen times, at least. I serve it in cups for a first course, in front of the fireplace sometimes, or in a bowl with a salad and a crusty bread for a main servng. Everyone loves it, and I have had numberable requests for the rcipe. If youb like blue cvheese and artichokes, please give it a try. You won't be disappointed!

Made this recipe with asparagus and gorgonzola instead of the artichokes and BC. It turned out DELISH!!!! make sure you use enough asparagus to make the bisque thick, otherwise you'll end up with just a green broth, still good, but I like a little body to my bisque.

I was really disappointed in the flavors and texture of this soup. It was easy to make, but seemed rather boring given the two main ingredients. I didn't think to strain the soup, which might have helped the texture, but it isn't even worth the effort to make again. Very disappointing.

I used Chardonnay instead of vermouth. If you do not whisk the soup after adding the cheese, it will be lumpy. Delicious!

I grew up eating at Noggin's, so I was excited to stumble on this recipe while searching for something to do with frozen artichokes. I was very disappointed; both the artichokes and the roquefort that I used were diminished, not enhanced, by this preparation. Dull in color and taste, and unpleasant in texture. I never had this bisque at Noggins and, now that they're closed, I'm glad I have better memories of their food than this.

Loved it! My husband loves artichokes, and I was afraid that it just wouldn't cut it from some of the reviews I read - but boy were they wrong! It was a huge hit for my dinner party, and no stringy soup was had. Great suggestion to add some crumbled blue cheese on top and sprinkled with paprika for color.

Rating: 4
Made this one again and boy, what a keeper. I wanted to cut down the fat, so I threw in a couple of small Yukon gold potatoes for texture and finished it with a drizzle of half and half. I also substituted leeks for the onions. Yes, artichokes end up with a drab greyish color, but a few crumbles of the cheese on top with a dusting of paprika and the presentation takes you mind off the color.

this is delicious. simple to make. i used califlower instead of frozen artichoke because i just couldnt find it anywhere. i went to many stores and couldnt find it. i refuse to use canned artichoke hearts, i think canned artichoke is disgusting. fresh artichoke? well im not rich. i had to think of something else that might go well with it, and i came up with califlower. if your going to use califlower, cook it for about 20 to 30 minutes longer or untill califlower is tender, and use a tad less blue cheese.

At my husband's suggestion, we used this as a sauce for some sundried tomato/black pepper ravioli, and it worked beautifully. We halved the recipe and added a splash more of cream and some sherry to get it to the consistency we wanted. I agree with the previous Cook who mentioned to make sure you salt to taste.

Rating: 3
Very Good. Could taste all the flavors. We used our home-made chicken stock and (following suggestions on this site) strained the mixture for a creamy texture. We found that it needed a lot of salt to bring out flavors, so don't forget to "salt to taste".

I used dry white wine, canned artichokes with tough outer leaves removed, then chopped them before putting in blender.I didn't strain because I like it a little chunky and didn't have a problem with stringyness like others did. It was delicious and great for my low-card diet. It's even good cold! I'll definitely make this often.

Rating: 4
This recipe 4 forks up ! I found it silky and warming. The straining is a definite must. I also made a roux to thicken it the 2nd time I made it for a friend (he likes thick soups). I also shared the recipe with a chef a local cafe and his customers RAVED about it. It sold out every time he offered it on the menu.

This soup was fantastic! I don't give many four fork reviews, but this is one of them. Straining is indeed a good idea. But canned or frozen artichoke hearts? Where's my meat cleaver? Have you people lost your senses? Fresh artichokes have incomparable flavor and texture. Yes, more time intensive than opening a can, but if you know what you are doing it's not difficult and well worth the effort, especially if you are cooking for company. I'll post an artichoke tutorial at "www.depaul.edu/~hhealy/links/food/artichoke.html" for those who would like to try.

This soup was delicious. I made it for my husband who is not a fan of bleu cheese, and even he loved it. I used frozen artichokes and it still turned out to be fantastic. I think I will try fresh artichokes next time to enhance the flavor even more. Very velvetty, just great tasting!

I made this soup at work for our employee dinning room. Was a huge hit, had several request for the recipe. It was a little thin but I thickened it up with a basic rue. It was probally a little on the thin because I had to make 3 gallons. Also I used canned artichokes instead of frozen ( because thats what I had on hand). Had no problems with it being stringy like some others had. This one is a keeper!

I made this for my Christmas party. It was a big hit with my guests and several of them requested the recipe. I thought it was ok. Stick to the directions and you shouldn't have any problems; it's very easy to make. I used Danish Blue cheese and will try Maytag next time, following on the heals of previous reviewers. As for Beverly in PA; I too had trouble finding frozen artichoke hearts and found them (Birdseye brand) in the last place I would expect; Cub Foods.

This soup was yummy! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! It IS important to use a low salt chicken broth. I made it with regular one time because it is what I had on hand and it was terribly salty...I won't make that mistake again.

I thought this bisque was delicious, but I am an artichoke lover. Other people at dinner who like artichoke but not necessarily one of their favorite veggies thought this dish was just OK and definitely didn't want seconds. It was very easy to prepare. I made the first half 1 day ahead of time and everything turned out fine. Bottom line - great for artichoke lovers, great for easy cooking, but not a general crowd pleaser.

The frozen artichokes called for in the recipe were very stringy and fiberous (could be the brand, so I can't blame the recipe), so I needed to strain it out. I will now try it with canned artichokes to see if it improves.

I didn't have a problem with the artichoke hearts being stringy. The blue cheese really adds flavor and makes for a rich bisque. I topped it off with a small mound of shredded crab and chives.

I thought it was great and so much easier than other artichoke soup recipes I have made. I used frozen artichoke hearts and found that there is still some stringy parts left even after blending. The next time I make it, I am going to strain it through a coarse sieve.

Challenged by the comments of other cooks recorded here, I made this delicious soup using all fresh ingredients -- including, and especially homemade chicken stock and fresh thyme which grows wild here in the Cévennes. I used Bleu d'Auvergne cheese and fresh artichokes, currently abundant and cheap here. Huge success. This soup will become a specialité de la maison.

This recipe was boring. I love blue cheese and I love artichokes but this didn't bring out the best in either. My family enjoyed it but we weren't impressed. The only benefit is that it is very easy to make-- other than that plus I probably won't make it again.

I enjoyed the lightness of this soup, but was surprised at the blandness. I agree with one of the reviewers about using fresh baby artichokes. Vermouth is a must. Also, I used a very sharp bleu cheese, and it disappeared in the mix. I did not find it any better after it had mascerated overnight.

To those complaining re. lack of flavor. Use fresh small artichokes. Cook, drain and proceed with recipe. To the cook who complained about bitterness--those of us who love and adore artichokes know part of their allure is the bitter edge.

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe, even after reading some of the not so favorable reviews. Can someone tell me where to find frozen artichokes - I've looked in our local grocery stores and have found none. Are canned artichokes in brine a suitable substitute?

Intriguing recipe...but in my experience, billing off the vermouth rather reduces the flavor. I've found just adding it at simmer point is better for the "Juniper" bite...

Addressing the question of vermouth versus dry white wine: Dry vermouth is rather inexpensive & has a very long shelf life. I use it when I don't have a dry white wine on hand to use up. Which is often. It is easier to keep dry vermouth around rather than white wine. But, yes, they are interchangable. In my book, that is.

To the San Antonio cook: many times you can search the site for new recipes prior to the 15th (check your magazine for recipes), but you can also click on the "New Batch" link at the top of the screen (under 'recipes'), and frequently there are some updates done early. Bon Appetit!

This was easy to make and it tasted pretty good too. I used Sage blue cheese, which was very mild. So, I added more than the recipe called for and still found there was very little blue cheese flavor. I will try it with Maytag next time. I also used green onions, instead of chives. This added a nice flavor. I look forward to making this for dinner on a cool night this fall.

It's an amazing soup. The simplicity is probably it's beauty. The powerful flavours of the blue cheese might tend to become a wee bit overpowering, so a little caution is advisable, especially so if you intend to add those bits and crumbs of blue cheese you've collected over a period and which have ripened considerably in your refrigerator. If you love blue cheese however, ripened or not, just go ahead and have a ball.
