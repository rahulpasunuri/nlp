Made it with sea bass and it was delicious. Added lemon zest and capers like others suggested and it was great. The raw garlic was a little strong - next time I will use less or omit. A great weeknight meal, especially if you love olives.

I've reviewed this before but will comment again: add 1 tsp drained capers, 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Heaven on a plate!

This is a great recipe-easy quick and impressive. I always double the salad recipe(but not the oil). I have used it on both halibut and salmon with great success,grilling during the summer and oven-roasting during the winter. Its equally good for entertaining or for a weeknight meal.

Pros: Simple, easy, tasty. Very low-stress (not much time, no fancy prep, etc.). Presents nicely (good colors). Cons: Not particularly unusual, and the olive salad can be a little overpowering vs the halibut. Would definitely make again as a weekday meal or for a simple dinner party.

This is our favorite Halibut dish. We have replaced cilantro for the parsley which gives it an even better flavor. Very good dish!

This olive salad recipe was great. Just used whatever olives I had both black and green. I decreased the olive oil as other reviewers suggested and grilled the halibut istead of baking althogh this salad would be great on any other white fish. I think the olive salad would also be good on some toasted french bread or crackers. Very versatile relish.

Had some kalamata olives and a mixture that my produce market calls "farmer market," used those along with a few capers and some lemon zest as suggested by another reviewer, only used two tbsp. olive oil (more than enough)...loved the olive salad, but definitely thought that it overwhelmed the delicate halibut. Made again with swordfish that I grilled in my Foreman grill...WOW. Now that was a marriage. Served with steamed asparagus and a spinach salad. A glass of a nice dry white wine completed the dinner and my husband was a happy camper.

I thought this was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and the olive relish looked so skimpy -- I nearly tripled it -- there's a lot left over -- but it was great, nice to serve with bread, etc..probably would have given it 2.5 stars...

This is a wonderful dish. I added some capers and red pepper flakes and cut way back on the oil as per other reviewer's suggestions. Also, I grilled the halibut fillets (well oiled grill and oiled fish-no need to turn them over). It made for a nice smoky flavour and crisp crust. The olive salad recipe should be doubled-we were fighting over it. It is very versatile and could be used in so many different ways-If I could, I would rate this dish three and a half forks.

How can something this easy be so wonderful? The olive salad is terrific as is but might benefit from a little lemon zest and a teaspoon of capers. There was quite a bit of liquid left once the fish was cooked; I reduced it and poured it over the fish before adding the olive salad. If I had eaten this in a restaurant I would have gone back to order it again!

I use this recipe for thresher shark, with great results. I make the recipe as is, but with half the oil, to serve two. Then I make a sandwich the next day with french bread and the leftover relish, sort of like a muffeletta without the salami and cheese. So good!

Great make ahead recipe for entertaining or a nice dinner at home alone. I also made the recipe before reading reviews and would reduce the olive oil next time. I served this with roasted new potatoes and a mixed baby greens salad.

The olive salad is so versatile. It goes in pasta, salad and over a variety of fish. It's great as a spread on crackers or bread.

This was very good--the olive salad is fresh tasting and makes a colorful presentation. I made this before I read others' reviews and used all of the olive oil which I thought tasted fine. I spiced the salad up a bit with some red pepper flakes. Next time I'll grill the fish--I think that would add to the rustic quality of this dish.

Agree that this is delicious- very colorful as well. I took other reviewer's suggestions and also cut down the olive oil by about half. And, though I never thought I'd say this, I might add less garlic next time too. Raw garlic is pretty strong. Also, I used a food processer, which cut down prep time a bit.

This is an outstanding recipe. I have made it with halibut, swordfish and sea bass and my husband and I loved it. I like the idea of making the "salad" ahead of time, which makes preparing dinner much easier. Must admit, I have never used the amount of olive oil that the recipe calls for. One or two tablespoons is more than enough for our taste.

I would make this dish again, but next time I'd cut the garlic in half--it really overpowered the other flavors

Made this for a dinner party and it was a wow for all! Served it with a white bean puree, green beans with balsamic and almonds and Pinot Grigio. Put the fish in while we were eating our chilled carrot soup course, was ready to go when the dishes were cleared.

Yum, I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves olives, a wonderful combination of robust flavours!Serve with a "chewy" red wine, such as zinfandel or pinot noir.
