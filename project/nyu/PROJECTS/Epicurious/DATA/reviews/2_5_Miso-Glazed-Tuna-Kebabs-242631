I really wanted to like this recipe since I like all of the ingredients on their own, but it was just bad. The marinade was thick like paste, and though I scraped most of it off before cooking the tuna, the marinade that was left on led to a really strange, goop-y mouth feel. I wouldn't make this again

this was awful and I too felt it was a waste of good tuna. I will never make it again.

Nothing special here at all. Far too sweet, didn't care for choice of mayonaise as a binder/glaze. Only reason for my comment is that sea scallops took to this glaze better than the tuna, despite the flaws. Oh - and I had already cut down the sugar before deeming it too sweet. No thanks.

This is a good recipe, but I agree it is far too sweet if you follow the recipe to the letter. I put in only 3 tbsp of sugar for this recipe and it tasted just right that way. Shiro miso is good, but in Japan you could get those with good 'dashi' (fish consomme) in it that made it already sweeter than plain shiro- miso. I suggest use dashi-shiro- miso,and put JUST ONE tbsp of sugar - they taste better!

I agree with the reviewers who say this is NOT one to use the good tuna on. Also, yes it is a little sweet, even for a miso glaze. But it's an easy- to-mix-up marinade that you can make while unpacking the rest of your stuff you got at Costco ... yes I got the ahi tuna there, along with a bunch of chicken breasts which I also cubed up for the extra marinade. I would make this if I were having a big barbecue and wanted to step up one level from burgers, and serve it with maybe some teriyaki chicken skewers, grilled pineapple and a nice cucumber sesame salad or something. Maybe not for a Saturday date night ... but worth having in the stable for something easy to throw on the grill that people will like.

The edges get really nice and caramelized, and the marinade is super-easy (really no need to cook in advance). It's a fantastic way to jazz up non-sushi-grade tuna -- even previously frozen stuff ends up tasting wonderful.

I tried it again, substituting plain yogurt for the mayonnaise and it was much better, give it another fork or two!

This recipe is great for less-than-sushi-grade tuna. (The assertive flavor of this marinade isn't needed for the really good stuff) But for less expensive tuna steaks it's perfect. I used inexpensive pre-frozen tuna, did not bother to cook the marinade, and it was delicious. This is going to be a regular feature on my grill this summer.

Sorry, but I've had better. What a waste of good tuna!

Way too sweet for my liking. They were good though, it was just hard to finish a full serving.

This marinade is not good. It ruined $50 worth of sushi-grade tuna and I'll never make it again

Easy and delicious! I read the list of ingredients and neglected to read the directions, so I skipped the cooking step for the marinade. It came out great just whisking the marinade together without cooking first.
