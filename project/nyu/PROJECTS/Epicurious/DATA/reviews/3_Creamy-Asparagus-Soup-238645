I omitted celery because I just don't like the taste... And used a big shallot instead of a leek because it's what I had on hand.... And crumbled goat cheese on top for creaminess - and LOVED IT!

boring. chunky. celery was overpowering. wont make again.

As written, it suffers from the onion flavors completely overpowering the asparagus, and also from some truly unpleasant texture issues. Even adding no fat half & half didn't salvage this one.

I would have given this recipe 0 stars if that was an option. A waste of tasty spring asparagus. No amount of tinkering could save this tasteless disaster.

Soup was very good, but we had to add a little fat free half and half to make it creamy. I will definitely make this soup again.

Excellent but I spoiled the low cal part by adding 1 cup of half and half in place of the reserved asparagus water. So good and sooo creamy with a nice presentation.

I was disappointed that it didn't turn out to be creamy at all and didn't look a bit like the soup in the picture. I tried adding a little milk but it still wasn't creamy. The soup tasted good and healthy though and my husband loved it, so did my 15 month old toddler.

Was a little runny and not as exciting as I wanted it to be. I added some heavy cream! With the heavy cream I will definately make this again. Very good.

I loved this soup! So easy to make (i'm all about the blender), and healthy, too. I also added just a tiny bit of cream to the soup at the end just for a little texture, and it came out perfectly. Also good for heating up the next day!

For being only 100 cal per serving this was pretty good. I added the juice of half a lemon to give it a little soemthing extra and omitted the pine nuts. Will make again.

For a low fat soup, this was very good. Originally I made the recipe as written, but didn't like the fact that it wasn't that creamy. Since the calories were quite low at around 90, I used 2 cups of chicken broth and added 1/2 cup fat free half-and -half to give it a creamy consistency. Other than that, no additional changes were made. Served this for my in-laws and it was gone in no time.
