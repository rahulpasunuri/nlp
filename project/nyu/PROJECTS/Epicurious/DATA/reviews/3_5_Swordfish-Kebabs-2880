As made this recipe is rather boring but with the changes that I made it was quite good. After having soaked the swordfish in the marinade I dredged them in cayenne pepper...YUM made them nice and spicy. I would make it again with that change.

These were great! So simple, and delicious. Everybody loved them. I think brushing everything with bacon fat before cooking gave it a great flavor. I also added zuchini chunks as I had a bunch of them in the fridge that needed to be used. Great, simple recipe!

This was delicious! Don't forget seasoning generously w/ S&P before grilling. We kept it on for 8 min, not 5.

This was OK. It didn't really add anything to the fish and was saved by the last minute fresh lemon.

I used shark, instead of swordfish, did not cube it, used whole steaks, and added several extra cloves of garlic, and some chopped onion. Marinated about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. We grilled. It was good, not fabulous or anything, but I may use this recipe again.

This was an average tasting dish - nothing special. The Worcestershire sauce made the swordfish taste sweet. There are better marinades for swordfish out there.

The swordfish was grilled on George Foreman grill for a large group of people who liked it a lot (even smallest of kiddies ate it). Personally I would prefer more assertive combination of flavors but the dish seemed to be a hit with guests.

Outstanding recipe!! This is the absolute best marinade for swordfish that we've ever had. I only had time to marinate for 1 hour, so I can only imagine how much better it would be if marinated longer. We just grilled the Swordfish steaks (didn't do the kebabs). And the bonus? It's really easy to do....

This has become my standard swordfish marinade. Great, and easy. Just make sure you marinate long enough - you could easily go 4+ hours to make sure the fish and veggies pick up the flavor.

we loved this dish! it was beautiful and easy and the fish was sooo moist and flavorful! one of my friends is not a fish eater but couldnt quit remarking on how excellent it was! the dish was complimented with a chickpea, sun-dried tomatoes & cucumber w/ parsley, lemon salad which i also found on this site.

Unfortunately my guests gobbled up all of the swordfish at our buffet dinner before I was able to taste it, but I was told over and over that this is an amazing recipe!

This is the best swordfish recipe I've made, every bite was delicious. I used steaks and didn't make the kebobs and I served with grilled asparagus. I marinated for about 4 1/2 hours and squeezed more lemon on it before serving. Sensational, easy recipe, it doesn't get any better than this!

This recipe converted non fish eaters to fish lovers. I added oregano and skipped the peppers. I also squeezed some fresh lime as soon as they were off the BBQ.

Made for dinner. Husband & I both really enjoyed it. I did not alter the recipe at all. Made exactly as is.

I only had time to marinate the fish for 45 min. Still, it was delicious! And dinner was on the table in close to an hour. My husband loved it so much he asked for it again the very next night!Can't wait to make it again for company. Used red and white onions instead boiling onions

Easy and delicious. Skipped the peppers but added cherry tomatoes and bacon (as in other recipe on this site). The fish was tender and flavorful thanks to this great marinade!

Used the marinade for swordfish steaks, that were then grilled. Very moist and wonderful flavor! I boiled the marinade for 10 min. before basting the grilling fish; it's a safer method.

This one's a keeper.

It was an easy recipe to follow. Everyone raved about it. My kids even liked it and they don't like fish. Can't get a better review than that.

I tried this with steaks as opposed to Kebabs, and it was great. I marinaded it overnight in a ziplock bag, and I used Lea & Perrin's White Wine Worcestershire instead of the classic brown sauce, which I tend to prefer on most fish and chicken. This is an easy, straighforward recipe that I would consider a great old standby.

This recipe was fantastic! The swordfish was very tender and juicy. Good flavor and easy to make.
