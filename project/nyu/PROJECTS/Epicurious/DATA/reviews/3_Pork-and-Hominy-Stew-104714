I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly - to me it made more than 4 servings. After reading that some readers found it bland, I added salt, which was a mistake. With the canned ingredients, I should have known it would be plenty salty. I also prepared yellow rice (the Mahatma packaged yellow rice with saffron) which I was going to serve on the side, but we ended up adding it to our individual servings of the soup. It is a tasty dish.

This is surprisingly tasty for the amount of effort and the ingredients. I love hominy and am always looking for ways to use it. I added some chopped garlic with the onions, but followed the recipe otherwise. I served it with corn muffins. This was satisfying but not too heavy on a humid summer evening.

This was an easy recipe to make with things I happened to have on hand. I used chunks of stir-fry pork rather than ground. Yes, cilantro is essential. Also, a squirt of lime juice and a dollop of sour cream really enhances a bowl of this stew - or you could use a slotted spoon to separate the solids from the broth, then roll them in a warmed flour tortilla with sour cream and lime juice. Delicious!

We love this recipe in our home! I double the recipe automatically, as it is so much better the next day. I also use pork tenderloin, cut it into large (2") chunks, and then pulse in the food processor so it's like very chunky gound pork. So easy and perfect for this recipe. Of course, we live in Santa Fe and so use fresh green chilies! Yum!

This is a new staple in our recipe box. I use pork stew meat, instead of the ground pork. It has wonderful flavor and is great on a cold night!

actually i'd rate it just shy of 3 forks. i like this recipe a lot; it couldn't be easier to make. but i found it lacking in several respects: 1. the pork flavor didn't come through; next time i'll try it with ground turkey. 2. it was a little bland overall, but partly that was my fault. i had a 20-oz. pkg. of pork, and so i doubled up on the other ingredients except for the coriander, which was an oversight-- it IS an essential to the dish. i don't use much salt in cooking, but it was great with green (jalapeno) tabasco sauce. also used one can each hominy and corn, which i would do again b/c the hominy isn't very flavorful. also, next time i'd use less broth and eliminate the flour; it doesn't add much besides calories/carbs. fwiw, i also threw in 1/2 cup soy grits -- this is the perfect recipe to sneak in some more healthful ingredients. (i think i'll add some diced carrots, too.) give it a try; you won't be sorry.

Having never tasted Pesole, I can't say if this is a bad interpretation, I just know that this was a winner in my house. I substituted pork shoulder, cut into bite size pieces, and I doubled the amount of meat, then cooked it for 25 minutes longer so it would stew. I also added some frozen corn. But the main thing was the subtle flavor of the spices. The combination of cumin, cilantro, and chilis is wonderful; not that hot spicy (caliente)that most people think of in Mexican food.

This recipe is a much simplified version of posole, and far from my mother-in-law's authentic dish. However with a few changes- using cubed pork instead of ground cooked in chipotle sauce, using red chili powder (I haven't grasped the art of cooking with real chilies yet,) and serving with avocado and lime, it was satisfactory and spicy enough for my husband to ask for seconds.

Saying that this is similar to real pozole is like saying that Hamburger Helper is similar to real cooking.

This is a great recipe. Very tasty, quick and easy to prepare. Doubled the recipe (used 1 1/2 pounds of pork) and everything blended together very well. Will definately make this one again.

I doubled the recipe and added two 28oz cans of white hominy. I also sauted the onions before I added the pork. I served it with largly diced avacado and finely chopped cliantro on top. This is easy and yummy! :-)

Delicious with the yellow rice. I will make a it a bit hotter next time I make it. My husband could not get enough of it. Easy to make.

I finally made this meal(after finding the recipe months ago.) I wasn't sure what to expect...I doubled the pork (because I had a 1-pound package) and almost all the other ingredients - I only had 3 cans of chiles. I made some yellow (saffron & chicken broth) rice to serve with the stew (which was more of a thick soup,) but the rice wasn't even necessary. We ate the stew with some warmed flour tortillas & it was phenomenal! I did saute the onions for about 10 minutes before I added the ground pork for browning...that was really the only deviation from the recipe. My 2 year old actually tried a few bites & liked it (before she started throwing the hominy around the room...my 4-year-old wouldn't touch it!) We really enjoyed this recipe!

This was great. Its even better the second day when the flavors have had time to meld. I used 1.25 lbs of pork and doubled the rest of the ingredients except the oil and the onions. I only found mild green chilies so added 1/2 a serrano chili for heat. May add a little more next time. Initially it still seemed bland until I realized I needed to add more salt. After that adjustment, it was awesome. Great smells and flavor!

This was really excellent, and very easily put together. I used 1.5 lbs. ground pork and two cans of hominy to compensate and had enough for leftovers. Oddly enough, I left the rest of the ingredients in the same proportions and it was just fine. Yummy comfort food for a cold day!

I increased the amount of cumin in the basic recipe and substituted veal broth (only because I had some leftover from a superlative Blanquette de Veau) for the chicken stock. Also, I used fresh japalenos instead of canned chilis. The results were quite good. Per the recommendation, I served it over Basmati Rice made with saffron and added the grapefruit, avocado, red onio salad (to which I also added a mango, but jicama would have been equally good). Our El Salvidorean neighbor pronounced the dinner "excellent." I thought so, too.

It appears that many of the reviews were for "Stew 2002" rather than "Stew 2001" which this recipe is ...anyway, this was an easy and delicious recipe which lent itself to alterations ... I used 16 oz. of ground pork and 1 can of diced green chilis. Served with warm flour tortillas, my husband and I really enjoyed it, with enough left over for lunch tomorrow!

Am I making the same recipe as all of you? Chili powder? bacon? I loved this recipe except I decreased the amount of cumin and added some heat with the addition of a roasted, peeled, seeded jalapeno. Having moved to Ohio from Arizona, this is a real comfort food on a cold evening with a bonus of being easy to make.

I felt that the chili powder was a bit overwhelming and made the dish taste too much like chili. I didn't think I'd make it again - until my husband said, without prompting, "I really like this!" First time I've heard that one in months....

This recipe was slightly time consuming, but easy to follow and manageable for even the most novice of chefs. It had such a wonderful flavor and was fillinf beyond belief. No side dishes required for a full family meal. I replaced pablanos with cubanelles so there wasn't as much spice and even my three year old daughter thought it was the best dinner ever!!!! Left overs froze and reheated well over the stove, meat toughened slightly in the microwave. Great if prepared the day before and reheated for a quick after work meal!!!!

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great. I used corn instead of hominy and forgot the bacon. I served with warm tortillas, which were great for dipping in the broth. I served it as a burrito filling for leftovers and that was also great.

Outstanding. Really satisfying.

I never ate hominy before because I didn't think I'd like it. My father and I tried this with the yellow rice and it was delicious, but it does make more than two servings. The grapefruit and avocado salad go very well with this dish. It's even better the second day.

My husband and my 2 year old absolutely loved this! I served it with yellow rice and warm tortillas. It makes plenty, so I ended up freezing the extras and serving it again a few weeks later.

This is a terrific, tasty dish that you can make in short order for two or a crowd. We like things on the spicy side so I added a little chopped, seeded serano chile. Another plus is that except for the cilantro, you can have all of the ingredients on hand in your pantry for a quick and delicious meal. Definitely a keeper!
