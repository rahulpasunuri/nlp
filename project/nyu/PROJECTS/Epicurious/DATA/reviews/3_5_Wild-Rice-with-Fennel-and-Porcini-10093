I made a double recipe of this to serve five as a side dish. It took closer to an hour for the rice to be finished, but the final product was very tasty. Please note that you should season the fennel, onion, and porcinis while sauteeing them or you are likely to end up with an under-seasoned dish.

This is a really good recipe. I'll be keeping it and passing it along.

I liked this a lot. Leave a lot of time for cooking the wild rice, as a reviewer said, as different brands really vary in their cooking times. I thought the porcini soaking liquor was a waste until I tasted the rice when the liquid had all been absorbed. Fantastic! I hadn't expected there to be so much fennel and onion, and I might cut down on the proportion, but otherwise a keeper.

Fantastic recipe. The only bit of advice I would give is to be careful not to overcook the rice. I usually remove the rice from heat just when it has become al dente, and let it sit, covered, for 20-30 minutes to complete the cooking process. I served this dish with Roasted Sea Bass with Lemon-Fennel Oil and some roasted cherry tomatoes for Christmas Eve dinner - rave reviews.

No way did the wild rice cook in 50 minutes -- more like an hour and a half. I think next time I will soak it first. Definitely allow for more cooking time. Delicious flavor.

My guests loved this dish. I substituted orzo for about 1/3 to 1/2 of the wild rice.

This recipe has lots of flavor. I used a mix of equal parts basmati, California brown, and wild rices. It is a fabulous compliment to filet mignon and would be great with game. It could be a stuffing as well.
