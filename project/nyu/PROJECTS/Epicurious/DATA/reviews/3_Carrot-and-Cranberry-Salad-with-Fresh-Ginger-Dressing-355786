This is a great salad - fresh, crunchy, and zingy IF YOU USE THE RECIPE as written, and use FRESH ingedients. As noted by another cook, please do not downgrade the recipe if you have altered or substituted and did not enjoy the results.

I made this recipe for Easter and everyone love it! The only thing I've changed is that, instead of 1/2 cup of seasoned rice vinegar, I add 1/4 cup of seasoned rice vinegar and 1/4 cup of Mirin. I also add pine nuts.

I made this as written and thought the vinegar was overpowering, making it too sour. Won't be making this again.

Yum. I love simple salads like this one. I didn't have dried cranberries (and my husband's not a fan) so left them out. Will definitely be making this one over and over again.

I made this as the recipe called for (although didn't have seasoned rice vinegar, used regular); overwhelming comment from testers was "needs something crunchy". I added 1/2 cup toasted pecans, chopped, and it is PERFECT. I made it in the spring (not as a Thanksgiving side), and it is a nice alternative to cole slaw. I used the pre-peeled baby carrots that have lots of flavor; I agree with another reviewer that this is all about the carrot flavor so you absolutely need to use good carrots.

My brother made this for Thanksgiving. It was actually better the next day with Thanksgiving leftovers because the flavors became more intense. Great for a potluck because it travels well.

This simple recipe really delivers when it comes to taste, texture, color, and refreshing flavor. I made it as written but reduced it by half (for 2 of us)and there were still leftovers. That was fine because it keeps nicely and we enjoyed it again for lunches. A great alternative to the usual cabbage slaw.

Made this as written. The taste and the colors are exceptional. The pureed dressing is low-cal and tasty. And, the left-overs were good.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner for 25 people. With the exception of a 13 year old boy, positive comments were heard from other guests. They liked the fresh, light taste to counterbalance the turkey, mashers, stuffing and gravy. (Let's do T-Day again...!)

I used a combo of fresh garden yellow carrots with orange carrots. I followed the recipe with few exceptions: used frozen ginger puree and added mirin to the dressing. I thought it was visually exciting but the taste really didn't WOW me. My Thanksgiving dinner guests loved it and it was a favorite with my mother-in-law who ate the leftovers for two days.

I'd say 2.5 forks. pretty. interesting contrast in texture to other items on Thanksgiving plate. Taste is good, not great. would not make again, but not sorry I did this time.

I LOVED this recipe. It was so easy, especially since I bought preshredded carrots. The only thing I didn't like was the dressing seemed very tart/sour, so I added a little apple cider vinegar and a little sugar. That made a huge different. It was a big hit at my dinner for 12. :)

This was excellent - I agree with other reviewers that the key to this is fresh ingredients, with particular care taken to get good carrots. I used organic carrots from my weekly CSA box. I'll be making this again in a few days to serve at Thanksgiving.

I loved this recipe. So fresh and flavorful. I have made it twice and found it to be very light and tangy and very healthy. May add some cilantro next time

I made this for Canadian Thanskgiving and got rave reviews from my guests. It is a lovely, fresh counterpoint to other parts of the menu. But I think the key is fresh everything and great carrots (I get organic from the farmers market). If you don't have seasoned rice vinegar, perhaps try cider vinegar.

I am trying to decide if I want to try to make this or not. I think it's best if you don't have some of the more important ingredients on hand not to rate and review it. It's not really fair, now is it?

It was good, but I do not know if I would go out of my way to make this salad again. The dressing is very strong, so watch out! But ironically enough, the biggest fan of this salad was my 11 month old.

I'm giving this 3 forks because it was the first time in recent memory that my husband enjoyed eating his veggies. That said, I found it rather bland, but I think that was my fault: don't be tempted to use the pre-shredded carrots from the supermarket--they lack any discernible carrot flavor. I'm sure it's much tastier with good carrots.

My Chief Eater gave this two thumbs up, and I also liked it a lot. I made it with exactly the ingredients in the recipe, although I cut it in half in case we didn't like it. It was perfect with a pork tenderloin and potatoes. I think you need the seasoned rice vinegar for the best flavor.

Can't say that this was good:( I didn't have seasoned rice vinegar so I used plain rice vinegar. The picture looks good but I didn't care for the taste.

Made this salad over the weekend oh my it is delicious!!!! I could eat a trough of this. Serving size on this should say 1. I also made it with pomegranate seeds and a bit of agave nectar. I will make this often.
