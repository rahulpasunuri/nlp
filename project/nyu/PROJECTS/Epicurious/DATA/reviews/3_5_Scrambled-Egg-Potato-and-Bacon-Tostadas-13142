Very good. Time consuming. Suggestions that worked for me: When serving it for a brunch and to avoid pressure in trying to get it on the table in time (1) precook the bacon a few hours ahead of time or the day before and reheat in the microwave just to warm through; (2) cook the potatoes as directed ahead of time, then do the frying 20 minutes or so before serving; (3) fry the tortillas the day before and keep covered as recipe suggests. (4) cook the eggs at the last minute so they are warm. (5) make the salsa ahead of time.

This is my recipe Ive tried off epicurious, but i found it to be as easy and delicious as everyone else has claimed. i I think the instructions for cooking the potatoes should be expanded on though, the recipe mentions they should be boiled, and then it mentions they should cook to a golden brown, so I suspect they are missing a step.

I thought that this was ridiculously good for the effort expended. I made the serrano salsa from Rick Bayless (on this website) which was perfect with it. My boyfriend and I each had two and wanted to keep eating, it was so good. I will make these again soon. In fact, I wish I had one now...

This dish was good...I might have put fewer potatoes in, but otherwise it was good. Preferring breakfast burritos to tostadas, I made the filling, then set up a buffet with flour torillas, the egg mixture, guacamole, sour cream, fresh salsa, grated cheese, jalapenos, etc. Everyone loved it! I also made bacon and potatoes the night before and just added to eggs after partially cooked which made for easy entertaining!
