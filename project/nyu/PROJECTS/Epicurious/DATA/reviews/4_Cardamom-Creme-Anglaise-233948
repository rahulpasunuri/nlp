I have made this recipe many times. I've used it with the Dark Chocolate Souffles and I've used it to make ice cream. I also use the ice cream with a base of chocolate brownie, scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of ganache. Amazing! This recipe never disappoints.

The cardamom creme anglaise was fantastic, absolutely top-notch. Would be a great accompaniment to many desserts. I wasn't particularly pleased with the individual soufflés paired with this recipe. I used 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered cardamom instead of 2 tablespoons of crushed pods.

This is absolutely delicious. I made one mistake by purchasing crushed cardamom and still using 2 tbsp. So there was a lot in it but still tasty.

I made this to go with the chocolate souffles -- which were also great --but the cardamon creme really stole the show. This sauce would go well with any dark chocolate dessert.

I made this to go with some Chocolate Lava Cakes I made. It was delicious - a perfect compliment to the eh warm chocolate. I used the leftovers to make ice cream, yummers!! This is a keeper.

My guests raved about this. They all thought it had a peppermint candy taste and couldn't guess the cardamon.

oh, and to add: a previous reviewer said to strain the cardamom out after a few hours because the flavor was too strong... i totally disagree. i left the pods in for a full 24 hours and i thought the flavor was delightful. but, as they say, in matters of taste, there is no argument... i might agree with other reviewers that it is quite sweet, and might cut the sugar in the future, but it's certainly not cloying. the recipe is lovely as it stands.

I made this with the Dark Chocolate Souffles to bring to a friend's house. This custard really made the dish, and the others agreed. We all had second servings of custard over our souffles as we worked our way through them. Lovely.

This was a fantastic recipe. Very easy and very elegant. I will certainly be making this again.

I was eager to try this recipe, having just had the most divine cardamom creme anglaise at a local restuarant. I would recommend reducing the sugar. While the fragrance of the creme was exquisite, my family (including two children age 7 and 11) found it much too sweet.

This is so yummy, especially with the chocolate souffles. However, if you are making it a day in advance (as I did), be sure to strain out the cardamom pods after a few hours like the recipe says. I forgot to take them out until the next day and I ended up having to make it again because the cardamom flavor had become overpowering. Done correctly, though, this is delicious.

I never did look up the choc. souffle recipe this apparently was first written with, but it doesn't matter. This is a perfect sauce for any spice cake, even to dress up a favourite carrot cake instead of icing. Also, if you double or triple the recipe and don't thicken it on the stove, you can use it as the custard base for a great creme brule!

Absolutely wonderful. I used Valrhona chocolate and the souffles were great. The Creme Anglaise had a uniqueness to them from the Cardamom that complimented the sweetness of the souffles perfectly. Can't wait to make these again.

One word: heavenly! Very easy to make as well. This goes well by itself, or with the Dark Chocolate Soufflés from the same issue of Bon Appétit (Feb. 2006).
