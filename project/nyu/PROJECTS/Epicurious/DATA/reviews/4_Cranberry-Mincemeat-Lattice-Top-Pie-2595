Excellent mincemeat! I've made this recipe every year for thanksgiving & x-mas as per the never-ending requests of my family. I don't particularly like nuts (and my grandmother can't eat them) so I've made many substitutions...dried black currants, dried blueberries and dried bing cherries. the cherries were gross. too tart & sweet for this earthy pie. my favorite nut substitution: 1/4 c dried black currants & 1/4 c dried blueberries. YUM! As always, I was very generous with the spices and i add a rounded 1/4tsp nutmeg. Also, i have had varying kitchen shortages and using light/golden or dark brown sugar doesn't affect it too much, same with molasses. although dark brown sugar and dark molasses offer the deepest/richest flavors. A note on the recipe: i love how this recipe still doesn't tell you to put the filling into the crust and then place the strips for the lattice on top. don't forget that part. it's important! ;-) I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS make the mincemeat at least a day in advance of making the whole pie. i've kept it in the fridge for 5 days and it only makes it taste better. great hot with super cold vanilla bean ice cream!

This recipe is fabulous! I have always liked mincemeat pie but did not want to go the trouble of cooking the meat or using suet. I love all of the fruits in the recipe so decided to try it. I thought it would be way too sweet and not much of a hit with my family. Boy was I ever wrong. Everything about the filling is perfect. Much better than the version with meat. I cooked the filling 3 days ahead so the flavors could blend together well. I made a lattice top which made the pie look just beautiful. Everyone at Christmas Eve dinner was very complimentary about the appearance and most of all about the filling. I have been eating the left over for breakfast! After all the fruits are good for people.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Very easy recipe to make. It looked and smelled great. Won over everyone who claimed they "hated" mincemeat pie. My father even requested it for Christmas. Highly recommend this recipe. I'd make some changes though: double the allspice and cloves as it needed a tad more kick to it.

This is the best mincemeat I have ever tasted. If you don't have time to bake a pie, just warm up some of the mincemeat and serve it over good vanilla ice cream...DELICIOUS!

My husband has made this pie every year for at least 8 or 9 years...it's a family favorite. You put the UNBAKED pie crust on the bottom of the pie plate, fill it with the filling (he always makes the filling the night before he bakes the pie), and he doesn't do lattice - instead he does leaves or some other decorative topping that leaves spaces on top. It looks and tastes very homemade!

Someone please respond...a the previous reviewer stated, the recipe is unclear. Do you fill an unbaked pie crust? and what about the lattice top?

The recipe is unclear. Do you fill an unbaked pie crust and then put it in the oven? Also, there is no mention of the top crust...? Please respond.

Fabulous! Great tasting! A must for holiday dinner. Everyone raved. Don't forget the brandy it gives it that special mellow combination with the fruit.

I am not a mincemeat pie fan, but my husband is and I thought I'd give it a try. It's pretty tasty, although it takes the better part of a day to make it. My Mom really loved it. Reminded her of the one her grandmother used to make. Recommended for mincemeat pie lovers.

Love this pie! Mincemeat from a jar is for people who eat jello for christmas.....Jars have given mincemeat pie a bad name for years. It's about time a true mincemeat was defended....How about a real fruitcake recipe w/ edible fruit?

Like the reviewer below, I've been making this since it debuted. It gets requested every Thanksgiving and Christmas. One friend, who wouldn't touch mincemeat with a ten-foot pole, loves this one. It's worth the effort to make your own mincemeat rather than buying the jarred stuff. Many times I'll modify a recipe to try to improve it... no improvements can be made on this one, as far as I'm concerned.

This was the best "mincemeat" pie I've ever eaten and everyone at Thanksgiving loved it -- even the non-mincemeat lovers. Will definitely make it again and again!

My husband has been making this recipe since it made it's debut in 1995. It is a favorite at his family's Thanksgiving dessert table...it (thankfully) replaced the jar Mincemeat pie he made for years. Use a flavorful apple like Granny Smith and make the mixture a day or two before you plan to use the pie - it "marinates" that way.

Where does the lattice top come in? No instructions for it in the recipe.
