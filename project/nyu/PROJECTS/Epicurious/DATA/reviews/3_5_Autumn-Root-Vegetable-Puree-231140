Try it twice. Much better without the rutabaga! I add some cream and nutmeg. Very good side dish for roasted meats.

I made this for Thanksgiving and tastes ok, but is not a memorable dish, more of a filler side dish. If you are looking for something exciting make something else.

Simole, tasty, and would make this again. I agree with another reviewer that this is a tad bland, but with the flavor of the root veggies, butter, and pepper, this has a nice simple taste to it.

So delicious and different. I didn't have sweet pots or rutabaga, but it was still terrific without them. This tasted very rich even with the small amount of butter.

Wow, this has such a wonderful depth of flavor (even after omitting the sweet potato and rutabaga) for such a simple recipe. Really tasty, and a beautiful creamy orange color.

Good basic recipe. I added 4 oz. of cream (it can take more) and a (heavy) pinch of fresh nutmeg using a ricer and I've made it several times since.

A nice excuse to use unique vegetables. I made this recipe as is and I really enjoyed it! Will definitely make again.

Wonderful Chef...this puree' is SO SIMPLE and tasty. You don't need to add anything as you get the flaver from the root veggies. Goes great with a braised chicken.

This is very bland. I added Cumin and Cardoman, and much more salt. I also added a splash of Balsamic vinegar.
