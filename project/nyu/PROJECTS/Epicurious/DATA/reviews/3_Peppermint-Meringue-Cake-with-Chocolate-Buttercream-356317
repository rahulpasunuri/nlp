I've made this several time and it is always a hit. At first glance, it seems to be a lot of work, but the parts can be broken down into smaller bits to make the task seem less daunting. Apart, the pieces are unimpressive. This dessert should be judged by the final product, not by the unassembled pieces. This cake is VERY rich. Eat a small piece and you will satisfy your dessert craving. I don't think this is a negative, though. In fact, there is no need to eat a huge dessert at the end of a meal. So, to the people who say this is too rich, I would respond, "You served yourself too large of a piece". ** This time, I used gluten free flour with added xanthum gum and the cake turned out great. **

i am in process of making cake and realized the recipe calls for two meringues but when you put cake together you need three. now i have to make more meringue, thank goodness i started 2 days ahead. ganache is very thin, not sure how i will make rosettes?? any suggestions?

Followed the recipe to a "T" only exception was I added extra peppermint extract to the syrup AND the meringue based on other readers thoughts that the pappermint flavor was weak. One fork for looks. Zero for taste and texture. The meringue was too crisp, the cake melted into the butter cream and the peppermint flavor too understated even with the additional extract. Needless to say, I will not make this again

This was an amazing and decadent dessert! I was so impressed with how it turned out. For those who mentioned the crispy meringue, if you read the directions thoroughly, which I did not the first time, you are supposed to let it chill for at least 6 hours. This allows the meringues to soften and give perfect slices. Also, the cake is very thin, so you have to be very careful not to overbake it. It is a typical genoise sponge which needs the syrup that usually accompanies such a cake for flavor and moisture. I love that it is so make ahead friendly and it was definitely a show stopper when I brought it to our party.

I agree with KathyCastro's review. I was so not impressed with this cake. The actual cake part was dry and tastless. The meringue was crisp but who wants something crunchy in their cake ? I made the meringue and the cake but never went any further, threw it all away. Luckily I started in plenty of time to make another dessert for the party on Saturday.

It was an exceptional cake. My only beef with it, it was WAY to rich to be serving so much of it, I had one guest able to eat an entire slice! I had over half of the ganache left and was able to put it to use so no worries there! When I do this one again I will not put it together in the rectangular fashion they suggest rather I am going to stack smaller round versions of the meringue and cake together. Amazing recipe though, finicky but fun to put together!

I forgot to mention that I added crushed candy canes to the meringue layer. It added a bit of color and mint taste.

This was fabulous. I took it as dessert to a friend's christmas dinner. She is a gourmet cook and she and everyone raved about it. I call it my "all day cake" because it took all day to make. Mostly just cooking time. It really wasn't hard, but lots of fun. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I'll definately make it again!

Absolutely delicious. I made it over the course of 5 days and the only thing that took real hands- on time was putting the cake together the last day. I was scared of just about every step, and everything was much easier than I expected (especially the meringue, which I was petrified of crushing during each step). Having read the reviews on how rich the cake is, I decided to do one substitution that worked fabulously and I hope that others will try this if they think the cake is too rich. I made a half recipe of the chocolate ganache (it's not buttercream at all) to use to ice the outside of the cake only. For the icing layers on the inside, I made a peppermint buttercream (1 stick of butter, about 3 cups powdered sugar, a few tablespoons of milk, 1/4 t of vanilla, 3/4 t of peppermint extract. I used very thin layers, and they tasted delicious with the rest of the cake and meringue. It also made for beautiful, clean slices since there were no hard layers of chocolate except for on the top. The inside of the cake melts in your mouth, isn't dry at all, and isn't too rich to finish a piece (or more!). I'm just a little scared to try the end pieces, since they'll be super rich with all that extra chocolate ganache. I'm sure I'll make this again next Christmas, it's unbelievable and gorgeous.

EXCELLENT!!! I followed the directions as written..as well as some reviews and this was PERFECT!!!It was a little crumbly when I cut it...but that was to be expected. I LOVED it as did my guests....just takes a LOT of patience and reading of recipe and reviews! Thanks!!!

This recipe really impressed my guests, even though I completely botched the presentation. Actually the whole thing was completely wrong, but in an edible messy way. My meringue was chewy, and the dimensions for the cake were all wrong. The buttercream was great though and made the messy pile of cake more appealing. Not sure how I did so many things wrong on this one, but I couldn't taste *any* of the mint flavor anywhere. This cake is not for a cake layering newbie. I'll probably make grandmarnier soaked chocolate cupcakes next time, but still cover them in this chocolate buttercream "ganache". So good.

This recipe took no time at all, and better yet parts can be made ahead of time to speed up day of delivery. The directions are much lengthier then needed, not sure why the author felt the need to drag the steps out. I think if the reviewers tried it again (be familiar with what they were doing and relying less on the overly drawn out directions) theyd be surprised how fast they could have it done. I could get this recipe down to 3 paragraphs it is very easy, and yet looks like a lot of work - perfect for the holidays, we LOVED it. My final thoughts after making it the recipe author should go into writing legal documents and give up on recipe writing.

Rating: 4
Highly time consuming. I increased the number of whites in the meringue, made 1.5 x the cake recipe and slightly increased the dimensions. I had buttercream to spare. I, too, made a third layer of the cake. I used orange flavoring instead of peppermint and added Grand Marnier instead of peppermint liqueur. I decorated it with chocolate curls and 1/4 sections of orange slices. It was fabulous and friends are still talking about it.

I loved the taste but I am a die hard chocolate and peppermint fan. I found it very manageable to make and put together if you do it over two days. I'm not sure what I did but my cake portion turned out super flat and dry. I'd happily substitute my regular go-to chocolate cake recipe for future. Like others, I think adding another cake layer is a great idea - just make a little extra peppermint syrup. Also, it's a bit heavy (for the non-chocoholics among us) on the delicious buttercream icing so next time I'll be sure to pipe only a small amount between layers - just enough to hold the layers together.

My mom and I made this recipe for our Christmas dinner. It's true it was a lot of work. I didn't have much trouble with the cake or meringue, but did have a bit of trouble getting the frosting to set so that I could frost the cake with it. This is a beautiful dessert and ours turned out just like the picture. I think the peppermint meringue and the peppermint syrup-soaked cake were a great flavor and texture combination. It was extremely rich and my frosting set very firm, almost like fudge. We all enjoyed the first serving, but after that, it was almost too rich and we had lots of leftovers. I would make it again, possibly substituting a boxed cake mix and possibly a different, less rich chocolate buttercream frosting. I would also like to try making it as an orange chocolate combination instead of the peppermint chocolate. I think that would be very tasty, also.

Rating: 1
Agreeing with quite a few here I would say that while this certainly looked impressive it was not nearly worth all the time. I also made the mistake of not reading the recipe until the very end. l saw that the buttercream could be made only a few hours ahead and so left this as the time by when the dessert should be served only to see at the end that the completed cake had to chill for additional time. It was too rich for my kids and only one diehard choco fan really liked it. Never again!

The cake was a big hit at my New Year's party. I made 6 pretty impressive desserts and this one disappeared. I'm surprised more reviewers didn't comment on making the meringue. I'm no novice but the meringue was tough. Adding all the sugar really flattened it out. And I had to cook it for over 4 hours to get it finally cooked through.

Rating: 3
This cake really wasn't all that difficult to make--just time consuming. I made some homemade vanilla ice thankfully, because otherwise cake was so rich than only die-hard chocoholics would have been able to eat it. No one went for seconds and the leftovers from Christmas Eve dinner went untouched. While it looked impressive, it wasn't worth the investment of time or money for our family. I make the Bon Appetit December cover recipe each year for Christmas Eve and 2008 and 2009 were both chocolate peppermint desserts. Hoping for a different variation for 2010!

this cake was too dye for., But You should have put that is should be made ahead in bold type up front. I put and extra layer of the chocolate cake on the bottom. My friend and I made it together, the results looked just as pictured and we were in "hog heaven" when it came time to eat it. Absolutely perfect. It did take quite a bit of time, but we will make it again! it just might be come a new family tradition.

Great Presentation. Huge hit for my party of 8. Though it would serve 16 no problem. One challenge and two changes - Challenge: Getting the meringue into stiff, glossy peaks was impossible (gtried twice) - must be a secret that no one has shared. Change #1 - add another layer of cake to the bottom - makes the slicing and serving easier and improves the look. Change #2 - make a bit more buttercream. I ran out - though I fixed it at the last minute with a can of pre-made frosting in a can I found in the pantry and no one was the wiser (grin). Also, on cheat - I just bought a $0.88 box of cake mix at Safeway - easy and gave the same result with no mystery cooking time. Overall - will make again.

The cake really does look more impressive than it tastes. I liked the different layers on their own - the mild peppermint-flavored meringues, the syrup-soaked cake, the rich chocolate buttercream - but together it just didn't work for me. The dry, chalky texture of the meringue kind of overpowered the dessert. If I ever attempt this again, I'd try making thinner meringues and using three layers of cake to two layers of meringue.

We made this cake for Christmas dinner - making it a family affair with the preparation and composition. Substituted 1/4 t of peppermint extract for the schnapps. Might have cooked the cake just a tad too long (15 minutes), but the peppermint syrup adequately addressed any dryness in the cake. Substituted peppermint ice (white chocolate with peppermint)for the thin mint wafers. The cake was a major hit. No trouble with the amount of frosting but did not do any piping. The cake is very rich and easily serves twice as many as the recipe indicates. This just might become a new Christmas tradition in our family! Enjoy.

The big hit of the Christmas desert extravaganza. Used peppermint oil instead of extract, worked great. Used Julia Child's recipe for the Meringue. Like others if I hadn't accidentally forgotten a meringue layer I would have run out of frosting.Next time I'll make 25% more. It took a lot of time but mostly in waiting and there was plenty to do so I didn't notice. This will become the new "Wow them at Christmas" desert in my repeatour.

This cake really wasn't hard to make and the result was SO impressive; everyone loved it. I'm not sure why others didn't have enough frosting. The amount the recipe made was perfect but you just have to make sure to spread very thin layers. I think I could've even used less frosting because it was so rich. I also only used about half of the syrup which made it just perfectly pepperminty. I didn't pipe any chocolate and just arranged mint leaves and raspberries all over it. I would definitely recommend making this, just go easy on the frosting.

This is one of the most unsatisfying recipes I have ever made from Bon Appetit. There's nothing hard about it, but it does take quite a lot of time, and there is just no payoff except how it looks. The chocolate cake is very dry and not very flavorful, the end result would be much improved by using a better moist and chocolate-y cake recipe, with a greater proportion of cake to meringue. I would also double the peppermint in the meringue, as it has almost no flavor. I had *just* enough frosting to cover, but would have benefited from an extra cup. We fed 24 people with this cake and had about 1/4 of it left over -- not a hit with anybody in the crowd, adult or kid.

Rating: 2
While this wasn't hard to make, just time consuming (and required a little planning ahead), it was just ok. Not bad, just not worth all the work, or spending $15 on chocolate alone. Pleasantly minty, heavy on the buttercream so it's good, but I've made better stuff.

The cake was beautiful, that is for sure, but the taste just wasn't that good to us. I made for a dinner party of 12 & there was still a good deal left over. No one was eager about 2nds at all. The cake really is almost too rich & you can only eat a small ammount. For the hours it takes to make it, the flavor is not worth it.

I made this cake and everyone loved it - I cut into thin slices when serving. I made the meringue the night before. I used peppermint extract instead of the schnapps. I made the actual cake recipe twice, and had 4 layers of cake (sandwiching 2 together with icing) because they looked so thin. It wasn't overwhealmingly peppermint, which I liked. For the icing I used Ghiardelli Bittersweet chips and did end up with enough icing. I definitely recommend making this!

I made this cake and it was a showstopper! It looked fabulous - just like the cover. I did it in one day which was a bit much because it took all day - better to take a few days. The buttercream frosting goes quicker if you put in the fridge to cool. I found everything worked fine on the recipe. It is super rich - but slice it thin and you can feed 20. It was fun doing the assembly.

I am giving this four stars because of the wow factor and the meringue is said to resemble astronoaut ice cream. A whole new texture. I am going to try this in a different form- small and cupcakecakey... anyway if you follow the recipe- MINUS one layer of meringue-you will have just enough buttercream/ganache to spread. but not enough to make any decor with...you gotta love chocolate for this one. It was not hard to make at all.

I'm not a baker, but had to attempt this based on the picture! It was a 3 day project, but really not that difficult. I followed the recipe exactly and found the meringue to be waaaay too pepperminty. I also found the brittle texture to be more a distraction than an asset. Next time, I'll try this concept with mascarpone instead and coffee liqeur for a tiramiso-like result.

I misread the direction and only made two layers of meringue. It was not very clear the way it written that a third layer was needed. After re-reading, I saw that a third rectangle was called for on another sheet of paper in another pan. I could have easily fit all three on one though. I would suggest re-writing that section to make it clearer.

A show stopper YES! Simple? Yes, IF you take your time and do the recipe in stages over a weeks time. I tried this out on two clients for dinner parties and had rave reviews not only on the looks of the final product but also on the flavor, beautiful slices etc.. For the first one, I wasn't able to get the duplicate mints as pictured so, I used crushed peppermint and white chocolate shavings instead....very snowy, holidayish. Second time around, I did the chocolate rosettes, the mints and dusted with crushed peppermint. Amounts of Chocolate buttercream were right on. Be sure to make your cake & meringue rectangles exactly same size so they'll line up nicely. Just think of the possibilities to try this year round with other liqueurs in place of the extract and schnapps! Orange, Raspberry? Dust it with candied orange zest or as pictured with fresh mint and raspberries. A versatile recipe for sure.

Due to very busy schedule I made this cake over a period of several days so it didn't seem too onerous to make. It looked beautiful because I sprinkled it with gold flakes and chopped dark chocolate and the taste was good (if you like peppermint) however the big complaint I have is that when I cut it the meringue disintigrated and it fell apart and there were bits of meringue dust all over the chocolate - none of them looked good on the plate. Admittedly overall I cut the pieces quite thin but even the few thicker ones didn't stay together. This cake will easily serve 20 people because it is very rich. A few tips I can share are: * make the meringue up to 1 week ahead and store at room temperature wrapped in foil. Mine was not perfectly rectangular so I gently trimmed it with a sharp knife and it was perfect. * bake the cake several days ahead and freeze; thaw just before assembling * I used 1/16th teaspoon peppermint extract in the Peppermint Syrup instead of spending $20 for schnapps that would not be used for anything else * when assembling the cake chill for 20-30 minutes after adding each couple layers - mine starting sliding apart and that kept it together very nicely * If serving 1-2 days after assembling save some buttercream in the pastry bag to repair the bottom of the cake after removing foil - mine was a bit chipped up so I just piped some rosettes all the way around the bottom and it looked great. I had just enough of the very delicious buttercream so no problem with a shortage of buttercream as experienced by other reviewers.

Made this cake for a christmas dinner party andI have to say it is not my favorite cake. I never thought I'd say it but it was too rich. And as another reviewer said there was not enough frosting I had to make 2 batches. last year I made the 12 layer mocha cake and guests were asking to take some home. this year there was cake left on the plates.I won't be making it again.

I too saw the cover of Bon Apetit and HAD to make this cake. However, after doing so, I'm not sure if this cake is worth the work without a few changes. I found even undercooked quite a bit, the cake was dry. My oven temps are dead on, so that's not the reason. Perhaps because it was SO thin? I think It detracted from the flavor of the cake. I think I would sub in another cake recipe for this one or perhaps cook it in a smaller pan and torte it. Or maybe I would thicken the simple syrup a little and really pour it on the cake. I read the reviews and made the following changes: I doubled the cake and used an extra 2 layers. I have 12lbs of different types of high quality chocolate in the house and NONE of them were under 61% cocoa, so I used the Ghirardelli Buttercream recipe that I use for many things. All in all, it turned out BEAUTIFULLY and people seemed to really like it, but I thought it didn't have enough peppermint flavor and was really, REALLY dry. I will make it again, but this one is going to need some help in my opinion. One tip to make assembly a whole lot easier. I made a 12" x 4" mold out of corrugated plastic sign material (available at Staples). I found this made the sizing of the meringue a lot easier. I just put it down on the parchment and used an offset spatula to spread it out in a perfect rectangle. And the inside piece I used to cut out the cake. All in all, there are a bunch of steps, none of them particularly difficult and most being able to be done in stages. It is a stunning cake, but it needs some help.

The picture and the assembly instructions have 3 layers of meringue; yet when I read the recipe, there are only 2 layers. What am I missing?

Fabulous! This cake takes time so if you want something that will really wow your freinds and family you just have to deal with it. If time is an issue use the do-ahead tips and you can't go wrong.

I've been following the reviews, but couldn't resist this cake based on how gorgeous it is, and it did not disappoint. I following the directions exactly, the the meringue didn't yield as much as 1 1/3 c. each, but I got about a cup each and they turned out fine. I really wathced how much buttercream I used so I didn't need to make an extra batch. This was good because - OMG - this is one rich cake. It's good if you can spread this thin. 1/2 slice is enough per person. I enjoyed making this cake and the results were both beautiful and yummy! A real show stopper.

After reading the reviews, both good and bad, I decided to try this anyway even though I am not an experienced cook. Based on the feedback I used a 12X8 pan for a thicker cake and only used 75% of the meringue to keep those thinner. This was perfect - made sure this cake was cakey, and the meringues provided enough texture and flavor but the cake was still suprisingly easy to slice and eat, not messy at all. I also iced the cake while the buttercream was still on the warmer side - thick enough to stick but thin enough to apply nice thin layers, since I could see how this would quickly become all icing. This worked well; I ended up with 2 cups of extra icing which I will take into account next time; and I still found the cake a bit heavy on the icing. Overall this is a delicious cake, very impressive, and takes a lot of time but can easily be broken up into multiple short sessions. The buttercream can be made in advance as well, stored in the fridge, and then nuked a bit to soften back up for assembly.

Before I made this cake I ran to the reviews and there were none. I decided to attempt the cake anyway. The end result was fabulous. Everyone LOVED the cake. The cake is very dense and rich so you need to serve very small servings. Now to the making of the cake. The meringue was more chewy than I was used to meringue being and it stuck to the parchment paper. My cake was dry and stuck to the parchment paper. I was sure that this was going to be an awful disaster. Thank God for the frosting. I had to let the frosting sit all night because I started the cake too late to put it together. I pieced the cake with the meringue together because of it sticking to the parchment paper but because of the icing it looked beautiful when I finished and it tasted devine. I will definitely make this cake again but I need review my other recipes to figure out how to keep the cake and the meringue from sticking to the parchment paper.This is definitely a keeper for very special occasions.

I have a tendency to ignore negative recipe reviews, and presume the reviewer's bad experience was due more to user error than to the recipe itself. I can assure you that this is not the case with this review. When factoring prep, bake, and wait times, this cake takes well over 12 hours to make. Regrettably, the end result was nowhere near worth my entire Sunday. The biggest complaint is that there are more layers of meringue and buttercream frosting than there is cake. The meringue only faintly tastes of mint and for the most part serves as a crunchy, messy distraction from otherwise delicious cake. I also don't really care for crunchy meringue in something that should be soft, chewy, and creamy. The buttercream separated and needed to be whipped for several minutes after cooling in order for it to actually become a buttercream. There is also nowhere near enough of it to cover the entire cake; I recommend doubling the recipe. I can safely say I followed every single step and instruction of this recipe precisely. While it did not turn out disastrously, it simply wasn't good. I strongly recommend saving your time. Or, if you want to spend 12 hours in the kitchen on a cake, make the cover recipe from *last year's* December Bon Appetit. A devil's food peppermint cake that was worth every hour spent.

When the Dec 09 Bon Appetit landed in the mail, I took one look at the cover and thought "I must make that cake." Then I turned to the recipe and saw nearly a full page of preparations which would ultimately take me 3 days to complete (Meringue on Monday, Peppermint Syrup on Wednesday, Cake and Frosting on Thursday evening, assembled Thursday night, served on Friday). Yes, it's a gigantic pain to make, but oh-so-worth it. This cake is a real showstopper and unbelievablely rich and delicious. It's really more like a 10-layer fudge than cake... we ended up serving only 1/2 inch slices which was the perfect amount (so the cake could really serve up to 20-25 ppl even though it says 10-12 servings). A couple tips: use a pastry bag to pipe the frosting layers - the cake is a little fragile and doesn't hold up well under heavy spreading as you get to the top layers. Better to pipe the frosting layers and delicately pat them into place. Also, don't make the same mistake I did - a regular cookie sheet is not 13 x 9. My first version of the cake layer came out like a thin burnt graham cracker before I realized I had used the wrong pan size. Serve with vanilla ice cream and a few Thin Mint girl scout cookies. Yummy!
