The sweet/spicy dressing was fantastic and so easy to make! I doubled the dressing recipe and kept it separate from the salad until just before serving, following the advice of another reviewer. This did keep the salad really fresh and also allowed us to adjust the amount of dressing for ourselves, which was nice. In addition to the steamed carrots, beans, and corn, I added fresh snap peas, which added crunch and texture to balance out the softer vegetables. This is a flexible recipe that could be used for a number of vegetable combinations, either frozen and fresh. It is a flavorful departure from traditional mayonnaise-based pasta salads. This will definitely to be my go-to pasta salad from now on!

I made the dressing and served on the side of the salad. I wasn't sure how it would go with the "rustic meatloaf" I served it with. I used tricolor farfalle, peas, & sliced carrot. It was a beautiful composition and with minced parsley and olive oil, stood on it's own well without the sauce with the meatloaf. To my surprise the ginger/soy did not overwhelm the french flavors I had going. Don't forget the gherkins and mustard. Def' Do-overfor the fourth of july picnic!

This did not turn out well. The sauce looked greasy and my kids weren't into the red color. It was also bland. Not a big hit, to say the least.

This recipe was a hit with my family! The best part about it is that is does not have a mayo-based dressing. It is light and unique, with an asian-inspired taste. You can really use whatever veggies you want. I did corn, tomotoes, bell pepper, celery, and some cucumber. I do recommend leaving the dressing off until right before eating though. Very good.

I don't care for this at all. It lacks flavor and just seems a soggy mess...

The dressing makes the salad! I used soy beans instead of green beans... and chopped celery instead of corn. The only thing I will try differently next time is waiting until the last minute to add the dressing to the pasta. I did it a couple of hours in advance and by the time we ate, the pasta had soaked up all the dressing so it wasn't as pronounced as I would have liked. This recipe is a party keeper!

The dressing makes the salad. It would be fantastic with any veggie added to the pasta. The ginger is the magic ingredient - be sure to use the real stuff.

This salad rates a rare "four forks" because so many pasta salad recipes are such a disappointment (too much mayo etc.). Yet this salad is delightful and unique! What makes this dressing so great is that you can play up whatever flavors you prefer by adding more of what you want to taste (ie. celery or tomato paste). The variety of dressing ingredients gives it a complexity of flavors that is quite satisfying. The only change I made was using sweet peas rather than corn. Next time, I will omit the green beans and try other veggie combinations. Would be great by adding chicken, turkey, shrimp or tuna. Plus, it's super quick and easy to make.

The combinations in this recipe just didn't taste right. The ginger, no matter how little you put in really overpowers the whole salad.

Very tasty and unusual pasta salad. The tri-color pasta and fresh ginger really make the salad. It does definitely taste better the second day.

This was my first recipe to check from this recipe book and I am very happy that I tried it! I chose quite an easy salad to start from but for my surprise its taste was really and very interesting. I added also a bit of hot pepper as was suggested, but looks that it was not very good idea.

Nice, easy-to-make salad -- dressing was great -- though I did use dried ginger instead. Used tri-color pasta, left out tomatoes, added some red & yellow pepper, green peas and rotisserie chicken -- was almost better the second day -- I'll definately make this again.

This is just splendid. And I was skeptical. I forgot the corn and someone suggested, although it might work well. And I added greenpepper as suggested. What a delight!

A really delicious dressing. It's also very good for a salad.

This was a simple recipe. Didn't have the green beans but added chopped green pepper and celery to the salad. Everybody loved it!! The dressing was excellent.

I would leave the corn off, because of the second starch. I feel the dressing is a grea idea for children, they like to dip in.
