This was a very good sauce for my beef roast. Somethings are classics fro a reason. I will use this often.

An excellant sauce. Quick to make with little or no discernable loss of flavor compared to the traditional recipe. I use Clois du Bois cabernet sauvignon and home made stock. I've made it four times now and serve it with rare filet mignons.

I was looking for normal brown sauce. This wasn't any good. Wasted my wine.

A light red wine would be my choice. The second time I made it I added horse radish in lieu of mustard in that option.
