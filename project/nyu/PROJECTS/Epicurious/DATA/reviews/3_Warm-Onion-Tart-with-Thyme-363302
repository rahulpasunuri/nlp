This was a pretty good recipe. The instructions are slightly flawed I did add cream and a few mushrooms the second time I made it to give it more substance and it was a huge hit. I will make it again but with these changes.

This was pretty good. I made it the first time with no tweaks and made a few the next few times. I think that it a good recipe and can easily be adjusted using different types of onions. I have even added mushrooms to make it a little more substantial...

This was fantastic - I skipped the tart portion, making the onions to top toasted baguette slices. I served it with a thyme and honey glazed ham. My husband and I thought it was great! Also great with wheat beer.
