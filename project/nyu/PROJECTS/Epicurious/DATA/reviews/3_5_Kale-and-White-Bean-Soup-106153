I made this for dinner this Sat. and it was outstanding. I've made other similar soups, but this was a notch above. I loved the thickness of it and flavor. I realized later I had forgotten to use the Parmesan rinds, so I expect that will only enhance the flavor.

I love kale and white bean and this looks delicious. Try this vegan version, just add some beans:http://messnkitchn.blogspot.com/2013/03/veggie-noodle-soup-vegan.html

Great recipe. Delicious. If I were making this with meat, I think I'd opt to crisp some pancetta instead of using kielbasa, but that's just me. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken and went 50/50 leeks/onions. Turned out beautifully. A new staple, for sure.

This has become our favorite soup recipe, with two minor changes: we love the parmesan flavor, so I double the parmesan rind, and I substitute a pound of browned and drained sweet Italian bulk sausage for the smoked sausage called for in the original. Made this for a neighbor after the birth of a new baby, and her husband (one of the best cooks I know) pronounced it the best he'd ever had.

This is such a filling and healthy soup, perfect for lunch but next time I will half the recipe because it makes so much. I made a few changes for what we had on hand so no sausage, used less water and had no parmesan rind so used some slices of a wine soaked cheddar/parmesan cheese we had. YumYUm!

A very easy recipe to adapt. I had all great quality vegetables from the farmer's market and ran across this recipe to use them. In the winter months, I make a soup every Sunday night for the week. With my market process, and scrounging with what I had in the house, I made this recipe with these ingredients; 1 sweet onion, 3 leeks, 2 stalks of celery, 3 carrots, 1 large russet potato (skin one), 2 cloves garlic, extra virgin olive oil, 2 strips turkey bacon, 1 quart low sodium chicken broth, fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme. I added 1 cup of dry white wine (sauvingon blanc) and 1 cup of water. I sprinkled a little sea salt in and ground some pepper in (not much). Based on another recommendation, I added the smallest amount of cumin, which added nice depth to the more traditional winter spices. I only had canned white beans so I added them with the tuscan kale at the end. Because everyone said the parmeasean rind was essential, I did not have. But I added quality parmeasan reggiano to the soup. I kept it thick...and rustic. Even though it might be better with dry beans, if you are in the need for a fast soup,doing this way, was "quick and dirty." Start to finish, it was completely done in one hour. It is simple, but it is healthy, thick, and very Tuscan in style. It is perfect as a light supper or lunch, or could be served as a first course.

I had a couple add ins but this was a great recipe...I added more garlic, red pepper flakes, more rosemary, herbs de provence, ground garlic, roasted tomatoes, and used veggie stock instead it was superb!

In order to make this recipe delicious, I changed it to fit the tastes of my family. We do not eat sausage or any sort of processed meat, nor do we eat cheese, other than the yogurt cheese I make from Dannon Plain Yogurt, so these two items were omitted. I did not have a pot large enough for the recipe as written and I only had a half pound of white beans, so I decided to halve the recipe which turned out to be plenty of soup. I knew this soup would be rather watery and in order for it to suit the tastes of my family I was going to have to find a way to bind it. I ended up adding two tablespoons of tomato paste thinned out with the soup broth. That didn't thicken it enough so I then added about three tablespoons of all purpose flour thinned out with the soup broth. Binding this soup made it visually more appealing, but it remained rather bland, so I ended up adding a teaspoon or so of a blend of spices consisting of cinnamon, tumeric, paprika, ginger and coriander. By making these changes this soup went from a rating of ok to delicious.

Rating: 4
Great soup. Made it just as written, using smoked turkey sausage and navy beans. My hubby liked the smaller beans. I am not sure what lacinato kale is but I used kale I bought at our local farmers market. The cheese rind really made the soup! Excellent a few days later too.

Made a vegetarian version with vegetable stock and without the sausage and it was very good. I agree with others that the parmesan rind is essential to a good result.

Rating: 3
I didn't add all of the water and subbed a cup of white wine instead. I pureed about 2/3 of the soup prior to the addition of the sausage and carrots to give it more body. For sausage, I used a venison/pork smoked sausage. Very tasty and to reiterate the others, the parmesan is essential.

I made it with red wine, mushrooms, and New Mexico green chili. Excellent. Next time I would cook the beans a bit in the pressure cooker since they're still a bit chewy and I cooked it for hours.

I did not have high expectations of this ( i never do with kale) but i have to say i was blown away by it, and so was my family. That being said, I basically ignored the recipe. I added courgettes in with the carrots after the onions had cooked for about 10 mins. I also used a bottle of beans, adding them in with the stock about 10 minutes before blanching the kale and sauteeing it with briefly garlic before adding it in. The parmesan is crucial to getting that deep flavour. I also skipped the sausage and just added a bit of bacon that had been sitting in the fridge. This is a phenomenal recipe and is very easy to adapt. This took about half an hour using bottled beans. I will definitely try a poached egg on top next time. I have to say that chilli oil on top is a great addition too, as is some parsley.

After reading the reviews, I used chicken stock in place of the water, half the kale and only six carrots instead of eight because it looked like plenty. I also added a bit of chopped prosciutto that I needed to get rid of, and sauteed that with the onions. With that addition, I didn't need to add salt, and I actually thought the kielbasa was a bit of an overkill. overkill. Next time I'll only use half a pound. But ridiculously good, nevertheless. I just made it tonight and I can't wait to eat it tomorrow, given all the reviews about how good it is the second day. This soup practically made itself; if yours didn't turn out good, you didn't use your imagination.

I have made this recipe probably 20 times because it is so good. Like other reviewers, I add a cup of wine (white or red, whatever needs to be used up). I also use fewer carrots and 2 cans of cannellini beans. I just throw a hunk of parmesan in if I don't have a rind, and it's always fabulous.

Tasty comfort food, and so simple. I've made this twice - once with dried beans and once with canned beans. It's better with dried beans, but still pretty darn good with the canned beans if you're in a hurry. I used vegetable stock instead of water and skipped the sausage.

I did a vegetarian version: vege stock instead of chicken, and no sausage. I added a pinch of cumin and marjoram, upped the pepper content to 1 full tsp and it was great. BTW, olive oil is great but use an oil with a higher smoke point, like coconut oil -still great flavour and you can cook your onions a little longer.

To the reviewer who suggested adding a poached egg: genius. An egg fried over-easy will also do in a pinch. I used chicken apple sausage (loved the sweetness), less water, and added sage and lemon zest. Wonderful, especially with the egg! Hearty, healthy, delicious.

This recipe was so good. It is very easy to customize with things you have on hand. For example, we used Irish Dubliner Cheese instead of the Parmigiano. We did not use a bay leaf. We used ground sausage instead, and cooked it up before adding it to the mix. Loved it!

I also added tomato paste which I think helped the broth a lot. Also threw in some white wine and mushrooms. And I used a variety of beans. I didn't use the parmigiano rind but I'll probably sprinkle with parmesan cheese. I was really happy with how it turned out.

I found this soup to be terribly disappointing. I followed the recipe and I don't think it was an issue of technique. It doesn't get much simpler than this. And it feels as though it makes about 16 gallons of soup. We'll never be able to finish it and i'm not excited about freezing it either.

I will definitely make this again. I used two cans of white beans to save time and they worked just fine. After perusing similar recipes that add wine, I decided to add a cup of a nice sauvignon blanc since I had some on hand for dinner last night. Wow! To balance out the sweetness of the wine, I added a bit more of the parmesan rind, which, as other reviewers have commented, is critical. I did not need to add 2 t salt, as called for by the recipe, because the canned beans were salted and because in addition to adding a pound of smoked saudage, I put in a bit of ham hock that I had on hand. I used smoked sausage from a German butcher in Los Angeles--some hot Hungarian sausage and some sausage called Berliner sausage. The hot hungarian sausage added a bit of heat which really worked well, and the Berliner sausage had some rye in it which really complements the rosemary. I did not sautee the sausage since they were dry. I also found that eight carrots were too much. I used six and that was plenty. I bought a pound of lacinato Kale to use, but, after cutting off the stems, needed to only use half. That was plenty. The recipe was so good, in fact, that I am making it again with the rest of the kale that I have on hand. I cut back on the water by about two or three cups. If you do use all of the liquid called for in the recipe, you may need a pound of kale. But if you reduce the amount of liquid as I did--I simply did not have a big enough pot--half a pound of kale works fine.

Rating: 4
We ate some of this about an hour after making it, and it was really very good. I didn't follow the recipe to the letter so you should take this review with a grain of salt. My modifications; I didn't have the cheese rind so used a Tbs or so of grated parm, I also added a glug of red wine after sauteing the onions, and I felt it needed a bit more depth so added a Tbs or so of tomato paste to balance the richness of the smokey tasting kielbasa. Like previous reviewers I scaled back on the carrots using only 3 and I used canned beans which I put in at the end, with the kale. I think that after mellowing in the fridge over night, this will be exceptional tomorrow.

Rating: 3
What a great, easy soup! I might suggest using canned beans instead of dried beans - even after a few hours the beans were still "al dente" (a problem that probably could have been solved if i had been patient and soaked them for longer.) Two slight modifications I'd recommend. 1) A little cayenne or red pepper flakes give it a great bite with the kale. 2) Poached egg, poached egg, poached egg! This soup tastes AWESOME with one on top - adds just a little extra heartiness.

I used green swiss chard and a small bit of cabbage instead of kale. Used three cheese rinds (I collect them in the freezer) instead of one. And a bit more rosemary. It's an excellent soup.

Great, hearty, tasty winter soup. To save time, I used organic/low sodium canned cannellini beans. I omitted the bay leaf and used chicken apple sausage, which gave it a nice sweetness. While it was good that evening, it was outstanding the next day.

Great recipe...have made it many times. It looks like it shouldn't work, and doesn't come together until the end (too few beans, too much water etc.) The trick is that parmigiano rind, carrots, and kale are all loaded with umami. I usually make it with mild Italian sausage, grilled or sauteed. I've also used other varieties of kale with good success. Tonight I just made it with turkey stock and turkey left over from the Thanksgiving dinner...still tastes great.

In response to the cook natashanese below re: browning the kielbasa to render the fat in the sausage and thereby REDUCE the amount of grease in the soup - it occurred to me that this is probably generally correct. In my case, I buy kielbasa from a Polish butcher who makes extremely lean Polish sausages (e.g., I have to add more oil to get his kieszka to brown properly than I would if I used store bought). So, I definitely did not want to brown his kielbasi and end up greasier than where I would have been. But I agree that my world view was kind of narrow. You could also parboil store bought kielbasi to render the fat. Thanks for pointing this out, natashanese!

Yummy! I love this recipe. My husband is vegetarian, so I make the with homemade vegetable broth and Trader Joe's vegetarian Italian sausage (in the refrigerated area). I also use about half the carrots and add 1-2 chopped sweet potatoes and a bit of crushed red pepper. It tastes even better for the next couple days. The rind is key to the flavor!

0 forks, this was awful, which was such a shocker as these are all some of my favorite ingredients individually. I actually poured this down the drain. In fairness to the recipe though i did not add the sausage/kielbasa as we are vegetarians. Recipe did cite this as an optional ingredient so i thought it would work.

I made this soup last winter, it is delicious and I am not a fan of beans- at all. I will say now that the air is turning cool again, I can't stop thinking about it. It's easy, very flavorful and comforting. I will be making this on a regular basis this winter!

Yummy! I did everything but the bay leaf because I didn't have one. Notes- browning the kilbasa reduces the fat in the soup because the fat of the kilbasa melts out- use a cast iron pan. I hate chopping onions so I food processed mine fine- actually worked out great they were easy to cook evenly that way. I used dried beans but I'm not sure why they would be any better than good canned ones. My beans took a long time to get tender- maybe I didn't soak them correctly.

Rating: 4
I did not brown the kielbasa because it is already cooked (smoked) and because I didn't want to add more grease to the soup. I also added it to the soup with the beans as suggested below. Absolutely delicious. I really hate kale but the CSA sends us loads and the simmering in the soup makes the usually bitter kale actually sweet. Love it.

Soup tastes good but proportions are way off! 8 carrots is way too many for this recipe. I also don't think there are enough beans for the amount of broth. I would adjust the quantities to your preference and it would be perfect.

I decided to make this recipe to use up some kale that I had purchased rather optimistically, considering I'm not a big kale fan. To my surprise, I loved this soup. I used canned beans and browned chicken sausage with the onions, but other than that followed it pretty closely. It is hearty and very flavorful... the parm rind and the fresh rosemary really add a lot. Kale is so good for you, I'm thrilled that I've found a way to prepare it that actually tastes good to me too!

This was WONDERFUL. I made it on a day when I was short on brain power so I inadvertently made some changes to the recipe in addition to subbing a few items that I didn't have on hand. I didn't have a rind of parmesan cheese so I had to skip that. I meant to sprinkle some cheese in, but I forgot. I imagine the rind is tasty. I thought I had cannellini beans but I couldn't find them so I subbed in "pink beans" ("frijoles rosados" by Goya - dunno what they were exactly). I soaked the full pound but then it seemed like too much so I only put half in the soup. I think that was about right. I also put the kielbasa in with the beans (yes, difficulty following directions, don't know what was wrong with me that day) but it ended up giving the soup a wonderful, full flavor and the sausage didn't seem worse for the wear (kielbasa was from most excellent Polish butcher). I think I may have also forgotten the rosemary, I can't remember. The kale was a big bunch from our winter CSA. We waited and ate the soup the next day - WOW!!! The recipe made a lot of soup and we happily ate it for supper every night for almost a week with no complaints. When the pot ran out my husband sighed wistfully. Yeah, it was that good.

We love this soup in the winter. It is great to make once the kale is in season at the Farmer's Market. My husband wishes I would add the sausage, but I want to keep it vegetarian, so he adds some meat (salami or sausage) to his own bowl. The parmesan rind really imparts a hearty flavor. I definitely agree you should not plan to eat it the day you make it--save it for the next day and after, as it is much tastier! Good with some crusty whole wheat/grain bread!

I made this recipe almost entirely as written. I didn't have the full pound of kale, so I used what I had (slightly more than half a pound). I bought my kielbasa from a butcher that makes it. It was the leanest kielbasa I have ever had. It was a bit spicier than store bought, but not as garlicky. The recipe was easy to pull together. I did not do the rapid soak method for the beans; I soaked them in the morning and cooked the soup at night. The soup has a mild flavor that I found very appealing. Those who prefer more bite to their soup can use a spicier sausage and add hot stuff to the soup. I did use two quarts of chicken broth and five cups of water; that is the reverse of what the recipe called for. All in all, I will make this soup again. It is cold and snowy here and this is a nice bowl of comfort.

I read a lot of the reviews and took notes and adapted this for my slow cooker. I cooked the onions and garlic for a little, then added my spices (I used a Tuscan salt bland that did great here) then added some spicy chicken sausage. When that browned, I added vegetable stock until all was integrated and thoroughly warm. I layered my beans, kale and Parmesan in the slow cooker then poured the stock mixture over it and cooked it on low for 8 hours. I do think there was a base note missing. I ended up adding some lemon at the finish for some balance. This is a good recipe but not a great one, though I want to keep working with it. It made a LOT of soup!

I thought this soup was delicious even without the sausage, which I omitted because I forgot to buy it. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth because that is all I had on-hand. I agree with the other reviewers that the parmigiano-reggiano rind is essential for flavor. I will definitely make this soup again -- it is a great healthy meal option.

It was good, but I used all stock and no water. Also, I found that cooking the beans uncovered evaporated too much of the stock.

Such a great cold night recipe. I used purple kale from the farmstand, and it made the whole broth purple, which was exciting for me, but may have scared some palates. All in all, delicious. I used turnips instead of carrots. Had frozen chicken sausage that I added which gave it another dimension. The Parmesan rind is essential, brings the flavor of the cheese to the forefront of the recipe.

This soup freezes decent. The only thing is that the beans start coming apart during defrosting. It's a nice light, brothy soup for cold days when you do not feel like cooking, but don't want to eat pre-packaged foods. I love that there are no tomatoes in this and the cheese essence from the rind is good. It doesn't make the soup heavy, yet you can still sense the cheese in it.

Once the beans were fully cooked (after 4+ hours), it was wonderful! Living in Denver, I had problems with the dried beans, even after soaking them over night. I've made some changes.

I love this soup and have made it many times. It's a great base recipe. I cheat and use whatever canned beans I have on hand. Tonight it was chick peas and black beans (be sure to rinse then well). I think the cheese rind is essential as it adds to both the flavor and texture of the broth.

The soup turned out delicious! I used more beans than it called for. Before I added the veggies and sausage, I gave it a few shots with the immersion blender. That pureed the beans already in the broth, and made the whole thing thicker. Then I added more beans and simmered for another 30 minutes to cook them. At the end, I added the veggies and sausage. I only had two carrots, and while it wasn't enough, I think 8 would have been too much. I'll definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
A good base of a soup recipe. I thought the soup depended too much on the onion, garlic and rosemary to create a flavor. I also thought 1 lb. of beans was far too much. If I make this again i will use 1/2 onion, 1 clove of garlic and half the beans. I will use celery and bacon when sauteing the onions and use fresh thyme instead of the rosemary. I think the amount of liquid is quite necessary unless you want a stew. I used chicken broth instead of the water.

I absolutely love this soup. Like others say, it makes much more than 6 servings. I use only dry beans; canned are a poor substitute for flavor. Do not pass on adding a rind of parmesan to the simmering beans. I use spicier chicken andouille sausage and agree this makes it better. Mine takes longer to cook, though. Flavors intensify if you make it a day ahead. YUM! I've made this soup several times... today it is 80 degrees outside and I'm still looking forward to a bowl at dinner!

This was a nice soup recipe, even if I did tweak the recipe to suit what I had on hand in my pantry. I did not have dried beans, so I used canned beans.

I bought stuff to make a different recipe that called for fresh cranberry beans. I didn't note the "fresh" part and bought dried white beans, so converted over to this recipe. The only meat I used was 3 oz. pancetta. I sauteed onions and garlic, removed from pan, and the crisped the diced pancetta in oil. The soup took way longer than 50 minutes - more like 2 hours, to fully cook the beans. Omitted the kale because I didn't buy any. When all said and done, the flavors were amazing!!!! I think the pancetta was the ticket. I'll try it the right way next time, but it would be hard not to just do this all over again. Yum!

Tasty yet simple to prepare, easy to veganize with simple substitutions; I would recommend subbing seitan (what I used) or tempeh for the sausage because that savory bit of chewiness really makes this dish into a substantial meal. I used Alubia Criollo white runner beans although I'd bet kidney beans would work well, too, and look super pretty. Another great way to showcase leafy greens!

Oh....My....God!!!!! This is so good! And it didn't get a chance to sit a day. Half of it is left, so I can only guess at how wonderful my dinner will be tomorrow. Thanks for the tips from other reviewers - I didn't use the extra water. It was almost like a stew. I didn't use any meat, but may pick up some sausage at the farmers market tomorrow. Oh, and I didn't have Parmesan cheese rind, but I did have a bit of Caerphilly rind - it was fantastic!! I make my own raw milk Caerphilly, which is pretty excellent, if I do say so myself.

Correction: My previous review stated the beans were tender after 50 minutes. I meant to say they were tender after 90 minutes of simmering. I continued to simmer another 30 minutes or so after adding the carrots, sausage and kale. I agree with previous posters that the cooking times are off, and it doesn't need all the extra water (1 qt water would be fine for a heartier soup), but it's still a good basic recipe.

As others have said, the cheese rind is key (I've used parmesan and pecorino romano). It really makes this soup. You can mess with some of the other ingredients but don't omit the rind, or you'll get a completely different, and ordinary soup. After the parboil and a couple hour's soaking , the beans were very tender after 50 minutes simmering with the seasonings, using small navy beans. Italian sausage works, as does the kielbasa.

I made this with crumbled spicy Italian sausage and it was delicious! Will become a staple Winter soup.

I don't mean to unnerve you real sausage lovers, but I made this with Tofurky Italian Sausage, skeptically, and made some other lazy modifications (poured the unrinsed canned beans in with garlic salt instead of salt salt and whatever bits of kale I could salvage from the dying stinky bag o'kale) and it was DELICIOUS. I can't imagine how it'd be better if I were to follow the directions properly! And it's vegan to boot!

Delicious and healthy! My family (kids are 9 and 11) loved it. I used kielbasa and added oak-smoked sea salt to enhance the smoky flavor along with a lot of fresh ground pepper.

It takes an eon to make, but this dish is absolutely delicious, and it keeps beautifully. I served it to four kids under 8-years-old and two adults, and it was demolished. I made two alternations: more garlic (I chopped 6 cloves) and a more intense sausage than called for (I used dried saucisson and diced it, to milk the flavor). I love that it's a one-pot meal: protein, veggies, and complex carbs.

Good hearty recipe for fall kale. I also took some short cuts: used 2 cans of white beans, sauteed sausage in pot first (may have made the broth a tad bit greasy). Improved with time

This is my favorite winter soup. I use canned great northern beans and whatever kielbasa is on sale. I can't wait for the cold to make it again.

Soup was much better the second day. I would cut back on water, as it was too thin for my taste.

I made this with the modifications recommended by previous reviewers. It was good the first day, but GREAT the next day, especially for lunch on a cold, drizzly day.

Great hearty winter soup! I used chicken italian sausage since the flavors are Italian, and it came out great. Even my husband who normally doesn't like soup (the highest compliment for soup is usually "it's ok") said he actually likes this, so this is definitely a winner. Make sure you use the parmesan rind, it contributes a lot of flavor, and let it sit. Navy beans could have used more than 50 minutes of cooking time, though.

Used canned beans but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and this turned out spectacular. It's easy, delicious and healthy (I used turkey kielbasa). The parm rind is essential!

This soup turned out very good. I made a few changes - added two cans of white beans at the end instead of using dried, added a can of chopped tomatoes, added some leftover ham from christmas (instead of the sausage), and doubled the rosemary. Next time I think I will use sausage for a little bit more flavor. Another comment - I found this made a LOT more servings than I had expected - 6 so far, with 5 more in the freezer. I had to switch pots halfway through cooking to accommodate all of the soup. Overall though, great soup for a winter day.

Love this soup, after reading the reviews I used 2 cans of beans and also added spicy turkey sausage, it's a great soup, if you're making this for some vegetarian friends just add more kale and a dash of hot sauce, the provolone toasts are a winner too!!!

I like a heartier, more robust soup so I added the following to this recipe, and think it does the trick: Carmalize the onion and add carmalized fennell as well,then add white wine before the broth,use turkey kielbasa for a smoky flavor,and to simplify, use 2 cans small white beans. Lastly, add small pasta shells or your favorite small pasta.

Really really good! Always looking for a new way to use kale. Use spicy italian sausage for a bit of a kick.

To make this soup vegetarian, I replaced the sausage with chopped up Boca breakfast patties. It was so perfect for a cold winter day. Next time I will double the recipe, because my husband and I ate up the whole batch too fast. So tasty!

Made this for a quick supper, so used 2 cans of Northern Beans instead of dried, also added 1/2 c. of pasta "ringettes". Couldn't find the parmesan rind, but will definitely make it again with the parmesan rind. My family liked it, and I loved how quick and easy it was to make with the canned beans. Served it with french bread with melted parmesan cheese. So, we had some parmesan flavor!

I have made this recipe twice now and have enjoyed it both times. I used a crockpot and by the time I got home from work (about 8 hours later) the beans where ready for the sausage and kale, cooked and hour more and wha la. I thought this recipe was a nice change from the usual white beans with ham hock.

This recipe is Fantabulous!! We added a little of our favorite habanero hot sauce and it just brought out the flavor. This is a definate family favorite!

Very good, however the beans took much longer to cook than 50 mins. I had soaked my beans overnight instead of quick method? Didn't add any salt to beans until after they were cooked because this is suppose to toughen beans and prevent them from cooking fully. I added 2 ham hocks to cook with beanswhich I think added a lot of flavor.After beans were cooked, I pureed about one third of them and added them back to pot to thicken them up a bit.I also added 2 sliced russet potatoes, which i first sauteed in a little of the smoked sausage renderings and then added potatoes about last half hour of cooking. Also added some jimmy dean cooked bulk sausage at end. My family seemed to really enjoy this soup.

My wife and I love this recipe! I always include the sausage, and I prefer some good Texas Hot Sausage. I also don't bother with dried beans. I use 2 cans of white beans and add them to the soup in the last five or ten minutes as the kale gets tender. This way the beans don't fall apart. I tend to make this soup in one pan (medium stock pot), beginning by browning the sausage and then using the fat left behind to sauté the onions and garlic. Once the stock goes in the pot, the fond left from the sausage comes up by scraping with a wooden spoon and adds flavor to the soup.

I pretty much followed the recipe, and it was great. I wanted something on the more brothy side, as opposed to thick or creamy, and this came through. The flavor of the liquid was wonderful. (The rind was probably indispensable.) Keeper!

Safe soup recipe - but I increased the beans and kale and made it into a stew. I usually make enough to freeze to bring for lunch - and I got really bored with this one. Would add some spicy sausage to give it some kick. Might try this one when in a bind.

Very good soup. I used turkey kielbasa which was fine (not great but so much less fat...). I'll make it again with true kiebasa.

This soup is like most Italian bean soups--not unusual, but very delicious. I would encourage people who have not had a lot of experience with bean soups and minestrones to not forget to use the parmesan rind. It is an absolutely key flavoring ingredient. Any supermarket that sells fresh parmesan cheese should be able to sell you--if not give you--the rind. I get mine from a huge, regional chain and have never been charged for them. Throw them in a zip-lock and into your freezer, and you will soon understand their value.

This was a good, simple, and nutritious soup. A grain such as barley might be a nice addition for heartiness, but this satisfied.

This is that rare soup that does NOT taste better after a night in the refrigerator. It was fine just after cooking--nothing special, but good and filling--but the leftovers were terrible. I'll only make this again if I'm feeding a big crowd.

We served this soup on our ski vacation the frist night, as eveyone arrived. I made it ahead, was great the second day. I served it with a beef kilbiese, sliced and sauteed in the bottom of the bowls. It was a great welcometo the vacation.

3 1/2 forks really. I've been wondering why I was saving Parmesan rind - really enjoyed the flavor it gave. Kielbasa is really optional next time will try without it but use saltier chicken broth. Will make this again - yummy on a chilly night with a roaring fire. Makes enough to feed 6 lumberjacks!!

It is definitely better after a few days and the flavors have time to meld and soften together. I used a Smithfield Ham sausage, because I find Kielbasa too spicy for me. The Ham sausage was too smoky for me, (the co. had also added additional smoke.)and had it for lunch the same day. Maybe next time I'll try a turkey sausage. Also, instead of cannellini beans, I added a package of frozen cheese filled tortellini, and used homemade chicken stock. It is wonderfully hearty and is a great soup for very cold and snowy weather; the kind of soup that sticks to your ribs. The kale was a great addition and gave it a little bite.

We really enjoyed this soup. I happened to have spinach on hand and used that instead of the kale (just add at the end as it doesn't take much cooking). Served it with crusty bread, salad, and red wine! Very easy too.

A fine soup. Started with a mirepoix instead of just onion and used ham instead of sausage. Excellent after shoveling out of our first snostorm of the year. My wife said this was a "very pretty soup."
