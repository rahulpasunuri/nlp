it was good and we would make it again. on a snowy nite all i had to make was chicken so i wanted an easy to make recipe with limited ingredients. this was the perfect item -- the kids and adults all liked it! couldn't ask for more. chicken was done and i didn't have to raise temp to 400.

I have a great honey-mustard chicken recipe on my blog - easy and delicious http://shabbatandchagim.blogspot.com/2006/01/best-friday-night.html

I halved the sauce and included it in with 7 large chicken legs (which is all that fit in my roasting pan) and they were done before the additional 15 minutes of cooking time suggested (basted every 15 min. or so). The thickened sauce in the pan was more than adequate for serving alongside the chicken instead of the 3/4 cup uncooked sauce as directed in the recipe and most of the alcohol in the wine is cooked off. My family really enjoys this dish!

We liked this, but we weren't bowled over. Used whole grain (seedy) mustard and thickened the sauce with corn starch. Great weeknight meal.

Trying to replicate a Cheddar's restaurant- type honey mustard chicken. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Deglazed pan with extra sauce. Served over rice pilaf with sauteed mushers and broccoli.

Great sauce!!! It was quite thin, but the taste was pure YUM!!! Had plenty of sauce left over for dipping.

I liked this alright and will probably make it again. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, which didn't require nearly as much baking time.

This recipe was a big hit in my household. I seasoned a whole chicken lightly with salt, pepper etc before splitting it down the middle and marinating it in the honey mustard sauce. Afetr roasting it for the required amount of time, I put the drippings, some chicken stock and the remaining marinade in a sauce pan, reduced it and added a little cornstarch to thicken. It was fabulous. I can't wait to serve this at a dinner party. Incidentally, bow tie pasta in a slightly sweet vinegarette, green salad and mushrooms sauteed in red wine all go really nicely with this chicken. A keeper for sure.

I loved this recipe, however I did do something a little different. I marinated my chicken in all but 3/4 cup of the honey mustard sauce. I then baked it and basted it with my reserve sauce. I chose to make pasta with a jarred alfredo sauce for the side. Towards the end, I had about 1/4-1/2 cup left of the honey mustard sauce left. I tossed it into my alfredo sauce and it was wonderful. The pasta, sauce, and chicken went so well together. It was absolutely delicious.

A HUGE hit with my husband, but I prefer to use boneless chicken breasts!

The Honey-Mustard Sauce had a nice taste to it but I thought it would be thicker. Maybe adding cornstarch to the sauce would help it cling to the chicken instead of run all over the plate. I ended up using a store bought version spooned over the chicken to save dinner which actually fared a lot better. :)
