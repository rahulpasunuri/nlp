Gosh, this was really great. Even for an urban, educated professional woman who does not derive all of her self-worth from pleasing her husband.

this recipe is for the person who enjoys pure pleasure from the combination of interesting flavors. After eating this dish- you'll never think of stuffing an artichoke again- heresy! Please try this, the luscious flavor of tarragon with the distinct bite of shallot is utterly divine. Shortcut: peel stem and chop for filling! Thank you Jacques Pepin!

This was wonderful. Yes, it is labor intensive. But this is a dish that's cooked from the heart, not something that you just whip up for dinner. When you're doing something really special for someone, the preparation can be an act of love in itself. What better way to spend an afternoon when you're housebound anyway, than to prepare something delightful for that fella who's out there in the cold, earning a living for his family!! Signed ... My husband's worth it!!

I guess if you're cooking for the President of France this might be a worthwhile dish. However, the work in preparation doesn't result in a good enough dish to be worth it.
