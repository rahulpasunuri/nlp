I made the shrimp exactly as directed. Guests raved. I made a different Tomato Chutney that we've been addicted to for years (from Ponti Seafood Restaurant in Seattle) so I can't comment on this version.

Everything I want in an appetizer. For the curry powder I used 1 part hot and 3 parts regular curry powder. The dish is extremely flavorful and the phyllo gives it a nice crunch.

The chutney tastes way better when made ahead, we make it all the time. Though it's more work to sprinkle & stack the phyllo sheets, I like it much better than just mixing the shrimp with the powder and the nuts.

Made these for a Christmas party and they were a big hit. I used a bit less sugar and added a dash of balsamic as previously suggested. Also took the advice and cut the phyllo into smaller strips. Highly suggested, but the phyllo is very hard to use since it dries out very quickly in CO.

I made these for a holiday party, and they were a hit! One thing I did differently was to roll the shrimp in the nut/curry mix and then wrap in the phyllo. It dramatically cut down the prep time.

This was pretty tasty, but if I were to make it again, it would be with major changes. The phyllo didn't really add anything (I made it because I had leftover phyllo!). I'd just use either raw or cooked shrimp and toss it in curry powder. While the chutney was good and easy, I would use less butter and sugar; it was very greasy and a bit too sweet.

Made this last night as a test for our wine club next weekend. It is fabulous. Did a short cut and put them into ready-made phyllo cups and it was just as good.

I was disappointed with this recipe until I realized I'd forgotten the chutney. The chutney I'm sure makes this a phenomenal recipe, and it was only so-so without the chutney. I would recommend using bigger phyllo triangles, because they look kind of messy and are hard to fold. I cut my phyllo into 9 pieces and used three shrimp per instead of the 15 pieces recommended and 1 shrimp per. They look more professional that way. I could cut back on the curry and the butter because they are very rich.

I served this as a first course and it was devoured with compliments.I found the chutney a little sweet so added a dollop of balsamic( and some ground dried chilis to perk it up a bit).

This dish is delicious, makes a beautiful presentation and is easy to prepare. Be sure to make the phyllo strips narrow enough, so that both the head and tail show. I made the shrimp a day ahead and froze them. You can also prepare the chutney ahead and just reheat. Just pop the shrimp in the oven (for roughly the same cooking time) and serve!

I first made this for a gathering for our dinner party club and the enire croud of "foodies" immediately started begging me for the recipe. The only person that didn't like it was my girlfriend who hates shimp; however, with everyone raving she even decided to give it a try. The look on her face was classic (sort of like Bill the Cat from the old Bloom County cartoons :-) ) Since then I have tried different variations - the mango chutney was particularly delicious. You will not regret making this dish!

Really great - don't cut down on the spices, or you'll be disappointed. (did that once to please a non-spice loving guest, yuck.) Really not that hard to make once you get going. Also, macadamias will substitute for hazelnuts if you happen to be in that pinch -

I mixed the shrimp directly with the ground hazelnuts and the spices (with the addition of some cayenne and S&P), then rolled them in the phyllo. This is a Fantastic recipe!

Very good. Added more spices(garlic,cilantro and ginger to sauce), and seasoned shrimp w/S&P. Phyllo should be cut in smaller squares, and maybe use less butter so not so soft. Made earlier in day,and put in refrigerator. Cooked in @10 min, shrimp were done but phyllo not golden.

Surprisingly easy...it was my first time with phyllo and it went off without a hitch. I forgot to get tomato paste, so i used slightly more tomatoes and reduced til the sauce was more chutney-like. Impress your naysaying friends and family who think you can't cook!!!

This dish got rave reviews. I served it as a first course with the chutney in the middle of the plate and six shrimp surrounding. I dusted the top of the plates with the remaining spice mix. Based on the response, I will definately make this one again!

Delicious! The chutney was a breeze to make. Only difficulty was wrapping the curled shrimp. I had to break the shrimp to straighten it out. Otherwise, the ends don't stick out of the phyllo.

Made this recipe as written. It was fabulous. The chutney was very very good. All easy to make. It was a hit with our "food knowledgeable" friends. I made them earlier in the day and just popped them in the oven when the guests arrived. Next time I'll try to make them several days ahead and freeze them.
