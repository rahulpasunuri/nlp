Liked it. I probably didn't boil the juice down enough, though. I'll do it longer next time. But, it was easy. Served with Broiled Salmon and couscous.

This is a very good dish and easy to prepare. However, the next time I make it I'll cut the cumin down to 1/2 a teaspoon, as 1 teaspoon made it a little overpowering.

This was easy and delicious. I served it with the veal chops with asparagus and morels as recommended in Bon Appetit.

Nice flavor, easy to make. Went well with the citrus chicken under a brick from the same issue.

Made this exactly as directed and it was delicious. Carrots cooked perfectly and glaze was refreshing due to fresh OJ and smoky from the cumin. Nice combination.

I made alterations and it turned our great. First of all, I roasted the carrots in butter in the oven until tender. Secondly I reduced the orange juice over the stove in a sauce pot until syrupy. I think it's important that I didn't use fresh orange juice, only diluted frozen concentrate. This way you can control the intensity of the flavor. I then combined the carrots with the sauce and everyone loved it. I also sprinkled it with fresh finely chopped flat leaf pasley and ground coriander.

I would give this 0 forks, but then the computer would think that I just hadn't rated it. I'm going to start by saying that I'll eat just about anything and I really hate wasting food. This recipe, however, was so gross that it got thrown over the balcony of my apartment. It smelled so bad while it was cooking that I was afraid that the smell would permeate my apartment and make me not want to eat the rest of my dinner. The carrots tasted a little bit better than they smelled, but if the best thing you can say for a food is that it tastes better than it smells, then it's really not worth eating, is it? If you want a really good carrot dish, check out Alton Brown's glazed carrot recipe on the Food Network website.

The recipe alone does not provide ample time to cook and the flavor was weak. I doubled the cooking time to get to desired doneness, added more cumin and drizzled them with honey before serving. It turned out great.

Used regular carrots instead of baby and they came out great.
