Excellent meal. I did make a few changes: susbtituted red for green bells, omitted the mushrooms, and added an apple. I also brined the chops as another user suggested. Made a pan sauce for the gravy.

My boyfriend and I loved this comfort food dish. I did make some alterations to suit it more to our tastes though. I cut out the mushrooms (it just didn't sound right), added a bit of thyme with the sage and parsley, threw a handful of cranberries into each of the stuffing and the gravy, and followed the cider gravy recipe of another reviewer (adding a bit of apple cider and brown sugar). All in all, not a 4 star meal, but perfect for a cozy fall/winter night. Oh yeah, I used boxed cornbread made the night before and served it with roasted parsnips that were flavored with marjoram and rosemary.

I found the stuffing to be to dry. It could have been my cornbread. For the amount of time it took, one would have to love this recipe. I'll prefer my wifes breaded pork chops anyday over this recipe.

Don't use the mushrooms if serving to me. I am allergic to them. I have found that not seasoning with salt until after browning helps keep the chops moist.

Dear Cook From NC - Try brining the pork chops. I had the same problem with dry pork chops, but no more. There are several recipes on this site- try the brine recipe for Brined Pork Chops with apples. It should work nicely with this recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of salt.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The stuffing is wonderful just a written. The gravy could use some changes but not certain what. Yummy.

Made as stated. The cornbread stuffing was scrumptious. My pork chops were still dry. I didn't care for the taste of the cider gravy as written -- so I tossed the whole shabang down the sink and made it again with 2 c. apple cider, 1 heaping Tbsp. brown sugar, a tsp. or so of apple cider vinegar, cornstartch, and no chicken broth. Much tastier! Would make it all again (especially the cornbread stuffing & new cider gravy) ... but could use some tips on how to make the pork-chop-part of the meal better. Thanks--

This is the second time I've made this dish for my family and both times we have just loved it! I would add a bit more broth to the dressing so it would be more moist. I served pan fried cinnamon apples that I let get a bit carmelized and southern style green beans. This is a wonderful dinner to greet the Fall season! Enjoy!!

I made this on a night when everything that could go wrong, did! I'm not fond of mushrooms so I left them out, and used walnuts after burning the last of my pecans. That said, this was a yummy make-again meal that didn't actually take too much effort if one was reasonably organized. I did make the cornbread from the recipe link, and it worked beautifully. A definite keeper. Thanks!!

Made this last night and it was an excellent pork dish with a nice presentation - so much easier than stuffing chops individually. I had some savoury corn bread muffins in the freezer so used them, deleted the green pepper (was already in the muffins) and added 2 cloves minced garlic all with tasty results. Fresh herbs contributed so much flavour, but I also added 2 tbsp. fresh thyme and a dash or two of ground nutmeg - so very good with mushrooms and apples. The dressing was a wee bit dry so drizzled a little cider over in the pan. Also simmered half a sliced apple with the cider for a few minutes to increase flavour, then removed before finishing the gravy. Served with roasted parsnips and an apple/cabbage slaw. All in all, a hearty supper alive with yummy flavours and perfect for an unseasonably cool and rainy, spring day. Cheers!

To make this dish more South Beach friendly, I used cous cous instead of corn bread. It was delicious and healthy.

on previous review, I meant I omitted green bell pepper, not red pepper. duh. Only because I think when you add green pepper to anything, that's all you can taste.

This is a very nice, delicious cooler weather meal. I didn't use the red pepper however. I'd probably make it on warmer days too, but I can't find unfiltered apple cider in my area except in the fall and winter. The apple cider gravy was fantastic. I loved the meal. My husband said it was good, but he'd just as soon have plain old breaded, fried pork chops with biscuits and gravy. He's a WV country bumpkin though.

YUM! Simple Sunday supper and enjoyed by the whole family. Definite keeper! I used day old Italian bread with some herbed Pepperidge farm cubes instead of the cornbread and added a chopped apple as well. Will definitely do the cornbread next time, but ran out of time today!

This was very tasty and the chops were juicey, I used the cornbread recipe attached and that worked out well too. I will definitely make this again.

It was pretty easy to make. I would add more liquid ot the dressing. It dried out a little bit upon cooking.

Thanks to the previous reviews my husband and I had the guts to make this for the first time for a dinner party recently and it was perfect! I was afraid the cider gravy was going to be too sweet but it complemented the flavors of the stuffing really nicely. We had six guests and every single plate was clean by the end of the meal. We served it with sauteed collard greens (another recipe on this site - 1998 version) and it was the perfect combination. Yummy!

This was an easy recipe to follow and it delivered great taste. I rarely cook with green peppers but this was a delicious combination. I used freshly made cornbread so the kids could enjoy it and they liked it. A "keeper" recipe in our household!

Never trust a cook from Detroit. All the good cooks are from Hamtramck.

We didn't really care for this recipe at all. The pork was bland, with no flavour, and the dish was not enticing to look at. Doubt we'll make it again.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and I because I promised him a repeat of the dressing from Thanksgiving. I should have read the reviews first because I used my old family dressing recipe and it sounds like this corn bread dressing is a hit! Next time. We enjoyed the dish and the cider gravy is easy to make and adds a nice touch to the meal.

This was an easy, satisfying recipe and everyone loved the stuffing. My mother is from the south and I grew up eating corn bread stuffing. I omitted the shiitakes (real southerners don't eat shiitakes)and I didn't miss them. My mother always makes the corn bread a day ahead and leaves it out overnight to get stale. It has more body that way.

This is one of those recipes that has a lot of wonderful tastes all together. Made exactly as per recipe and can't stop eating it. Tonight was a dry run for a dinner party next week. I wouldn't change anything. The mushroom really add an interesting flavor to the finished dish. I will keep this as a winter special meal. Do try this. Easy and great.

I found it to be a very easy recipe to make. I had a dinner party and served it as part of the main course and the men loved the flavor and the tenderness of the pork. It was a very nice winter meal.

With basic autumn kitchen ingredients (aside from shiitakes), and simple directions, this recipe was easy to make and got a "best recipe" and "great for guests" vote from my boyfriend. I used dried shiitakes, which I reconstituted, and then used the boiling water from the mushrooms in making the chicken broth. Also used 2 day old box-mix cornbread, which worked perfectly. Loved it!!!

This was a huge hit with my dinner guests! It was so easy to make, and taste was great! I made Jiffy cornbread, then toasted it slightly, and it turned out great! Am making for another dinner party tonight!

Really a nice addition to my collection of Pork dishes, which are usually our favorites. Well worth the extra effort of making corn bread. An out standing combination of flavors and textures. Give this one a try. If you make the corn bread and put it into the freezer you'll be ready when the mood strikes !
