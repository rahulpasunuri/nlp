The consistency is not correct. It needs twice as much butter.

Having made this about four times, I now think that the consistency is not right. It needs more butter. About twice as much.

I made this with duck livers and it was yummy. I made the fig jam from this website and it was really lovely with some toast points.

I put sliced, fresh figs from my garden around the plate for presentation but everyone was putting them atop the crackers and pate. This was delicious.

This pate really is delicious. It's easy to make and lasts a few days in the fridge. I divided the pate mixture into smaller terrines (used pyrex custard cups) so that it wasn't so overwhelming looking on the serving platter.

This was the first time I had ever made pate, and I was a little afraid of chopping up the livers, but oh lordie, it is so worth it, this is fantastic - and the fig preserves are beautiful accompaniment. The French brands usually make a fig preserve, but also at Middle Eastern specialty stores you can usually score some. Good eating!

Delicious and easy to make. For Valentine's Day, I put it into a Saran wrapped oiled heart shaped cake pan. It inverted perfectly! Bonne Maman, a widely distributed French brand makes Fig Conserve.
