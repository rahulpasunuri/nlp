I only made the cones and what a tedious project with not a pleasing result. The trick is in how long to let them cool before rolling and if it is to be a cone that holds any bit of ice cream, they are too too lacy to hold anything. If you roll them twice so that they are double thickness to somewhat eliminate the holes, they are too thick. I think I will just crunch them up and serve i over the lemon ice cream I made, as a garnish and serve it in a dessert dish. Also, maybe it is me, but they seem greasy. Not a pleasant experience, but now I know not to expect cones!

I have made this several times now and is always a big hit with dinner guests. I still have difficulty cooking the tuile to the right consistency(goey vs. burned) you have to keep a close eye on it. I also mould it in to little cups which makes for a great presentation. For a diet bust, I serve with pineapple ice cream, caramel and chocolate syrups and it's super sweet but great.

Neat looking, but a little tricky to make. Unless you've got a major sweet tooth, make the cups small or the richness of the tuile will overwhelm the ice cream. The Mai Tai sorbet on this site is great with these.

Try these cones/cups with the Mait Tai sorbet (also on this site). A big favorite with guests and often requested by my catering clients.

I shaped the tuile into cups, and filled them with orange mousse and a fraspberry sauce, wonderful!!!

Yummy! I didn't shape them into cones because it seemed harder, but they made great ice cream cups when shaped over a glass bottom. Delicious, different and impressive (and easy to make). Beware of summer humidity--they turn pretty soft the next day.

I only made the tuiles and they were fabulous!! I served them with peach sorbet, blueberries, and topped with toasted coconut. Very summery and yummy.
