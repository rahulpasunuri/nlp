Very good and so much better than trying to time the mashed potatoes with the turkey coming out of the oven and the ensuing mess from the potato ricer and butter and everything else. This is our new go-to potato dish for large groups. We tried both with and without the horseradish and decided it was a bit much with turkey but would be good with a roast or something like that.

Delicious! Made this dish a day ahead for a Thanksgiving feast, and it was a hit. Better and easier than my traditional mashed potatoes and a relief to just pop it in the oven on the big day.

Absolutely delicious. The potatoes had great flavor with the mix of cheese, butter, and horseradish. At first I thought I would add more horseradish but when I tasted them the next day, the flavor is subtle and satisfying.
