Delicious! I marinated some thick cut pork chops and grilled them (using the marinade from the recipe). It was divine with our citrus margaritas! This is a keeper.

Did this with pork tenderloin, on the grill. Served with Yukon gold mashed potatoes, since I had them to use up. Delicious.

The marinade was very flavorful, lots of fun to make. Our guests loved it and wanted to do it again. Need a propane grill, otherwise it's lots of extra work keeping the heat at a constant temperature.

To Cook from Santa del Fuerte: Do you really think that the equipment used in the recipe vs. the equipment used by Cubans out of necessity determines "authenticity?" Have you tated this recipe? Having LIVED in Cuba and learned to cook the food of their culture from Cubans I would say these flavors are authentic; try making the dish and tasting it...

I made this with a boneless shoulder of pork, but I don't have an injector. However, I did marinate the roast in the refrigerator for 48 hours. I cooked it on a gas grill with the outside 2 out of 4 burners on, and the inside ones off. The roast was in the center of the grill. This allowed me to control the temperature perfectly, and the pork came out super delicious, amazingly tender. My guests raved. Next time I would definitely buy an injector and use it. Without the injector I found that a lot of the marinade went to waste.

Absolutely Loved the recipe. Everything came out delicious. The only reason I can't give this a 4 fork rating, the cut of the meat suggested was WAY too fatty for me, and I don't eat healthy At All! But the chicken was very flavorful. I made the entire meal with the rice & beans and the plantains, and the entire menu was great! I will def be making the entire meal again, but with a different cut of meat. =)

Really tender after marinading for 24 hours, but next time I am going to try marinading with just the OJ as the lime is too strong for my taste, even though I usually LOVE lime. I also added one extra clove of garlic in the marinade and then before putting it in the BBQ I inserted about 3 cloves of garlic into the slits.

I have been eating and cooking Cuban food all my life, growing up in South Florida, and this was the best lechon I have had. Was hesitant to inject, but it made it so juicy and flavorful. Will make this again and again! The black beans and rice were outstanding too.

I cooked 5 roasts in the oven for 80. After marinating 24 hrs, I cooked them for 3 hours, then cooled and refrigerated. The next day, I skimmed off the excess fat and cooked them for another two hours. With that much volume it took a long time, but absolutely delicious!

The basting sauce/marinade is soooo tasty.

I made this for Father's day. I didn't use the bbq grill because when I had the temperature to 550F it fired the whole grill. Very disappointed after marinating it overnight. Put it in the oven and after 2 hours and 10 minutes the 4 lb. roast was done. Cooked the black bean rice. My husband and teenage son loved it. The roast tasted better the next day. My son has been eating all the leftovers ever since. If you need to cook in over, cook @ 325F.

I made this along with some other cuban delicacies for Father's Day. The end result was absolutely delicious. I used smaller portions of boneless pork (2 - 1.5 pound "hunks") as I was feeding a smaller crowd, and what was available at my local store. This made the cooking time MUCH shorter, and was very glad I had a thermometer on hand. be very careful when you cook, as to not dry it out. Extremely flavorful when served alone or with the boiled, left over marinade. You will not be disappointed!

Same question @ charcoal user; did you adjust the time at all?

joolieboo: Did you make any adjustments to grill with charcoal? Same cooking time? I have a pretty good sized grill with several removable grates so I could add coals as needs be without disturbing the meat. I might consider using chops instead to make this quicker to grill though it wouldn't be the exact same.

This was excellent!! I marinated it for about an hour and wasn't really able to tast the orange and seasonings. I would marinate it a minimum of 4 hours.

This recipe did not disappoint. Very flavorful and succulent. I was worried about marinating with citrus for the 24 hour time frame because I didn't want the meat texture to be ruined. I went ahead and followed the recipe exactly though and it was perfect. We couldn't stop nibbling on this. The crust was the absolute best. This one goes in my "keeper" file.

Outstanding! My dinner club guests raved about this! The flavors were so complex and the meat so tender. Made the black beans cooked in rice and the avocado salad as sides (both excellent) along with some tostones and fried yucca.

This recipe was a total winner, Even the kids, for whom we'd grilled the usual hot dogs and burgers, were nearly fighting over it. The entire 10 lb shoulder disappeared in 20 minutes among 30 guests. I slow cooked the prepared shoulder with the marinade in a dutch oven for 3 hours at 300F and finished it on the grill, using the pan juices to bast it.

Phenomenal, especially when cooked over charcoal. I used half Seville orange juice and half the mixture of lime/orange juice. Make sure to serve it with the Rice Cooked in Black Beans (Moros Y Cristianos) also on this site.

I don't own a grill. Any suggestions about how to cook this either indoors or in an electric smoker?

Delicious! The plantains were outstanding, too. Good food can't be rushed. (Too bad reviewers have to mark down a recipe when they choose not to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!)

AMAZING! I freshly squeezed the juice for the marinade, lime and orange juice. You won't regret getting a flavor injector for this either. Marinate for 24hrs if you can. My butcher only had a rear shoulder with the bone in. Trimmed off the big hunk of fat on the bottom. Cooked with semi-indirect heat(a few coals below the meat) on a charcoal grill for 3 hours. The meat came right off the bone.

Absolutely FANTASTIC! Very different than your boring backyard barbeque and not that difficult. If you are looking for side dishes, search Lourdes Castro on Epicurious and she's go plenty of Cuban recipes to go with his pork.

You MUST marinate this for the entire length or you'll miss out on one of the best grilled pork recipes out there. My cousin and her husband made this along with grilled Platanos and Moros. I almost dived into the platter for more.

This looks really intersting, but since I don't know very little about Cuban cooking, it would be nice to have suggestions of recipes to serve with. I will still try it and hope that some others will offer sides to make.

I was in a rush and made this with pork tenderloins, marinated for just a couple of hours and cooked at 450 degrees for 30 minutes. It was delicious, but I think longer marination and slower cooking period with the larger roast would be better. Served it with the black beans and rice linked to this recipe and a salad of paper-thin cucumbers and red onions marinated in a merlot vinegar.

Simply amazing! Made this for our dinner club as one of the main dishes and everyone raved about it's taste and tenderness. The only change made was after 1.5 hrs. on the grill, I placed the pork (and some basting sauce) in a foil covered pan to allow it to steam and cook faster. I can't wait to make this again!
