In response to the separating yogurt problem: turn down the heat to about medium before adding yogurt, stir yogurt well before adding to pan. Add yogurt in small quantities to pan, stirring yogurt in pan continuously as you add more. I cook a lot of Indian food. This is a common problem and that's how I've been able to deal with it.

Loved this recipe. I halved it because it was only for 3 of us, and wish I hadn't because I would have enjoyed the leftovers today. This is a sweet dish, but what do you expect for raisins both whole and pureed? I used the required amount of butter for the browning of the chicken pieces in the beginning, then drained the pan before adding the yogurt. I didn't add the cashews and raisins until the very end to allow the cashews to keep their crunch. The blend of spices was perfect, although I did add extra cayenne to give it an added kick to the back of your throat! I made sure to allow the sauce to simmer after adding the lemon juice to create a thicker sauce to spoon over the chicken pieces. My husband who is not a fan of sweet dishes, enjoyed this immensely. I served with jasmine rice and can't wait to make again.

This recipe was not good. It was way too salty for my taste. The chicken was very tender but the flavors do not mesh.

I had mixed feelings about this recipe. I did make some changes, but I'm not sure they'd effect the overall impressions: used boneless thighs, 3T ghee, and an onion. I cooked the onion in ghee, added the thighs, cooked for five minutes, and then followed the recipe. Before adding the raisin puree and lemon juice, I had a very, very tasty shahi korma. Sadly, after adding these ingredients, I add a sickly sweet mess. If you are interested in making this recipe, at all, I would recommend leaving out these two items and making a very tasty stewed chicken dish.

Actually, I haven't made this recipe -- I'm writing to make a suggestion about the separating yogurt, for anyone who has access to a Middle Eastern, Armenian, or similar grocery. Labne, which is basically strained yogurt, works very well (in a similar Gourmet mag recipe I've made for years). You can make your own by putting yogurt into cheesecloth and letting liquid drain off.

I'm a little bit obsessed with this recipe and surprised at all the bad reviews! I used bite size pieces of chicken thighs to make the whole thing more like a curry, and I did cut back on the butter (just 2T of regular unsalted and a swirl of olive oil). I love love love the spices in the sauce, though I would like to figure out how to stop the yogurt from separating--it did become grainy this last time (can't remember the first time I tried it). Served over brown rice and steamed spinach and could eat it once a week easily. I actually really like the soft texture that the cashews take on and love the sweet bites with raisins. Maybe it needs tweaking but I think this recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely fantastic dish, even though I cooked the chicken in regular butter. Also, next time I will add the cashews in at the end - if you add them before simmering, they just become soggy! My only question is: how does one prevent the yoghurt from separating when it's heated?

Absolutely terrible waste of ingredients and time. The picture looks better than the final result. The chicken itself was very tasty but the sauce was a disaster. I used fage brand yogurt like another reviewer but it turned out all clumpy like cottage cheese and not a smooth sauce. I love Susan Fenigers recipes and restaurants. Anything I ever made from her and her partner were excellent but this was not a keeper. Its not even worth saving the chicken bones for stock. Also has too much butter and fat from the chicken skin plus an insane amount of salt. I think Susan F. needs to stick with what she does best  Mexican and Latin America cuisine and leave the Indian up to Padma Lakshmi. If I eve make again I will make the chicken only and not the sauce.

We thought this was okay. We both really liked the chicken by itself, but the yogurt sauce was just okay. I think maybe the addition of the onion and garlic suggested by another reader would be helpful. And the recipe makes a LOT of sauce. I cut the recipe in half and I still had way too much.

Made this last night and everybody raved about it! The only change I made was using half the amount of cayenne pepper. Served this with basmati rice. Will definitely do it again!!!

This recipe was fantastic. Mae it for husband and three friends, everyone loved it. i used the raisin paste, but instead of adding additional raisins I added diced dried apricots because i prefer them, it was a nice addition. also, i used regular butter as i was out of ghee. i felt the salt as called for in the recipe was fine. served with roasted cauliflower and cous cous. will make this again and again.

To NaomiChicago, I read that as whisk it into *the* sauce, not *a* sauce. That is, into the sauce you've been making. At least, that's how I mean to do it. :-)

Great recipe for those who like Indian food. A wonderful combination of flavors. The only change I'd make would be to bundle the cloves in cheesecloth. That way, they can be lifted out and guests won't have to pick them out of the dish.

A question for Susan and for anyone else who has made this before: Does the instruction, "Whisk raisin paste and 1/3 cup lemon juice into sauce." mean A) to make a new sauce out of these ingredients, to be spooned over the chicken already in yogurt sauce, or B) to add these ingredients to the already-made yogurt sauce, which would be left in the pan after the chicken is transferred to a plate? Thanks for clarifying!

Wow! This was really good - a definite keeper. I used Fage yogurt and had no problem with the sauce being too thin. My husband even said he woundn't mind having this again and he doesn't usually care for things in creamy sauces.

Very, very good. Would definately make this again. Drained the yogurt based upon previuos reviews (thanks for the tip).

I made this the other night for dinner and served with basmati rice. I thought it was very good, with a nice tangy flavor from the raisins and lemon juice. I originally tried it because my husband is Indian (from near Delhi) and I love trying new Indian recipes on him. I dont know how authentic this recipe ished never heard of anything like it, and neither had our (South Indian) guest. One criticismthis is WAY too much ghee. It was floating on top of the sauce as I was simmering it and I ended up soaking off as much as I could with paper towels; otherwise we would have been eating plates of grease. Otherwise, very nice recipe.

To A Cook from Vancouver, BC, I can tell you what is missing... add 1 cooked onion and 2-3 cloves of garlic and mash to a paste. It'll round out the taste and make it exotic, as you were expecting.

I made this and was a bit disappointed. It looked great, but lacked something. I think I was expecting it to be more exotic. I agree with the comment that there was a bit too much sauce and I would reduce it if I make it again.

Delicious. The sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it would be, maybe I'll drain the yogurt next time. Love the cardamom!

Fabulous dish. It looks time consuming at first, but I broke it up over 2 days and did not make the clarified butter. I measured out the chicken seasoning and made the raisin paste the day before (refrigerated until I spiced the chicken). While the chicken was sitting, I made the yogurt mixture. I used boneless, skinless chickenbreasts and skinless thighs instead of a whole fryer. This makes a TON of sauce, so consider making half or doubling the chicken for lots and lots of leftovers. I found the salt amounts called for to be too much so when I make this again, I will reduce the salt by half.
