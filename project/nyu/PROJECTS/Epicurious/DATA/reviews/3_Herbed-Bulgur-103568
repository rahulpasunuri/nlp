I have tried a much better alternative to this dish,from an Italian recipe. Don't cook the Bulgur. Cover it with different types of fresh chopped vegetables(Tomatoes,Cucumber,Carrot,Celery etc.what you have available).Sprinkle some lemon juice and a good portion of olive oil. Refrigerate for 24hrs. It is then ready to eat and delicious!

I made some changes to this recipe & it was great. First of all, this recipe would be extremely bland if made with water. I would have used chicken broth but I was out so I used Campbells vegetable broth with onions. I also sauteed mushrooms and onions first, then added the bulger for a few seconds then the broth. It took about 12 minutes on low. I added thyme and basil (whatever happened to be in the garden!). It was great that night and even better left over the next day!

This was easy to prepare, but only so-so in taste. I added some lemon juice which helped -- but felt it needed something else. Certainly not the best bulgur I have had!

I'm not a fan of rice, bulgar, pilafs, etc. but even I liked this one. It might be a tad heavy on the dill though.

I love grains but my wife is a white rice only gal. She is always complaining when I make brown rice or cous-cous. I found this recipie as a recommended side for GRILLED PORK CHOPS WITH ANISE-SEED RUB AND MANGO MOJO - Gourmet June 2000 (also excellent). There were no reviews and I was nervous that it would be too wierd with all of those raw herbs. However, everyone loved it (including my wife) even if they had never heard of bulgar. I did add some butter. It will become a regular in my house.
