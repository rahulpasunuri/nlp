The flavor is great, unfortunately, while the cheese did melt, it never incorporated with the liquid. It was a clumpy mess that not even my trusty immersion blender could fix...How hot should the stove be? Could it be that I had it too hot/too cold? I would be willing to try again, but not if I wanted something quick and easy.

To the cook from Westchester: it sounds like you are trying to use the fondue heating element (sterno or electric) from start to finish and it probably isn't hot enough. Try starting out with your pot on a normal stove where you can control the heat and the transfer to the sterno once it is ready to be eaten. Good luck!

I've made this recipe probably 6 times, and everyone loves it. The key to getting the right consistency is to stir, stir, stir, constantly, from the moment you start putting cheese in. You can also add more cornstarch to the grated cheese so it doesn't start sticking together. We've had to stir in shifts because it gets so tiring, but it's worth it!

This was my second time trying this recipe after failing miserably at the superbowl party last year. This time, I tried it again for a New Year's Eve party, and once again, failed miserably. The first time I made this, I used an electric fondue pot, and it came out very very clumpy. This time around, I used a fondue pot with a sterno, and still, even though I spent a LOT of time trying to melt the cheese, it still was fairly clumpy and I could not seem to incorporate the cheese into the wine mixture. While the taste is delish, I simply could not get the desired texture. As this is such an expensive recipe to make, I will not try it again. Perhaps 3x is the charm, but this was more frustrating than charming.

We liked this, but thought it needed a bit more zing. Next time I'll add more pepper -- perhaps a dash of cayenne -- a bit of salt, and like the other reviewer will leave the garlic in. Still, a tasty dish that we will definitely make again.

This was excellent. We did NOT serve with bread - this is much too good for bread. Steam chunks of carrots and broccoli for dipping. We also grilled chicken breasts which has been marinated in red wine and soya sauce. It was a great meal. We also added shallots to the wine and pressed the garlic rather than halving and removing - just press and leave in. Very good - try it - you will like it!!!!
