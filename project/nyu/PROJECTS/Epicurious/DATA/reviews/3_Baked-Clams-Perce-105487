I do not know why the previous reviewers found this recipe strange or senseless, as I think it quite straightforward. This is a favorite Christmas Day appetizer for my family just as it is.

I thought the recipe sounded a little strange too at first. The only change I made was to chop up the clams a little and mix them with about 1/3 of the stuffing/cheese mix. Then I put the chopped clams into the shells, put the extra crumbs over the top, a drop of Worcestershire and then the bacon. They were outstanding- the best stuffed clams I've ever had!

I liked the sound of this recipe, but it made no sence and I had to improvise. I used a mix of bread stuffing (crushed) and seasoned bread crumbs. To soften I used olive oil and chicken stock. Make the changes and try it was very good!
