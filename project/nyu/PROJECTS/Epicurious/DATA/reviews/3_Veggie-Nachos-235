This was excellent with a small variation of not adding the chips. Instead, arrange the chips on a seperate tray and hten add the baked content just before serving.

This was a quick fix that everyone likes! I like to add any fresh veggies and herbs that I have in my garden to the dish in the summer, as well. Adding fresh herbs, like cilantro,and fresh veggies, like tomatoes and chilies/peppers, adds taste and color! Since I am a vegatarian, this recipe is a great meatless mexican dinner!!

This was a huge hit with everyone including kids. The corn and black beans make it healthier and it even looks pretty

Very easy and quick, also very filling. An excellent choice for anyone who would like a quick, satisfying way to cut down on their consumption of red meat!

I liked the crunchiness of the corn. As I made a 13x9 pan of it, I did not use as much cilantro or green chilies as indicated if you increase the amounts of the ingredients in the recipe. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Good way to start a Tex-Mex meal. Quick and easy to prepare.
