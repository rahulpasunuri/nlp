This was refreshing and tasty, although the mustard was a bit overwhelming (and I like mustard alot). I would reduce the mustard by half.

Great easy way to prepare cucumber. Used less sugar than called for, and extra virgin olive oil, it was so tasty- great after a 100+ degree day.

Simple and delicious way to use up a whole cucumber that had been sitting in my fridge, begging to be eaten. Perfect refreshing accompaniment for a steak dinner with grilled vegetables, and made in 5 minutes!

Love it elegant, quick, easy. The vinaigrette is also great for other salads (with mild lettuces like romaine, butter). I've used light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, champagne vinegar, country and whole grain dijons, as-is... it's aall good.

We put this over a bed of blanched, chilled asparagus spears. Doubled the dressing, used it to garnish the plate with extra dill, a lemon and a punch of shredded parm. Came out very, very well.

It's a matter of personal preference, but for sharper flavors, perhaps a cider vinegar or white vinegar would be better. Fresh dill makes a big difference, and makes it more summery. Was a bit disappointed the time I made it with dried dill.

Very good. The dressing was great - - slightly sweet and sour and the mustard flavor wass subtle - not overpowering.

I really enjoy this salad every time I make it. I use dried dill, which tastes great, but remember to use less because it is more potent!

This is a fast, easy, delicious solution to a surplus of cucumbers. Used regular mustard, dried dill, and apple cider vinegar and it was still good.

I have made this twice. Once - exactly as the recipe calls for, and the second time, I used "honey dijon" mustard instead. I liked it better the second time.

This recipe represents the perfect answer to the eternal question, "What shall I do with this cucumber that I've just picked from my garden?" I came, I saw the recipe, I ate the cucumber. And I would do it again.

This truly is exceptional for such a simple dish. I could probably eat the entire thing. Perfect for summer

Tasty. Looks a little odd with the mustard in it, but I like the flavor it adds.

I recommend this recipe - different, tasty and EASY! I found the mustard to be a little overpowering, so I just don't use as much.

My family and I love this salad. Summer doesn't start until that first cuke comes off the vine. And this is the perfect salad to showcase them. I like to add a little sweet onion. But otherwise, yummy as is.

this is really good and really easy - hits the spot on a hot summer day with some salmon.

Very nice. Would use the dressing (in judicious amounts) on grilled chicken, asparagus, or roasted or raw tomatoes as well. Dried dill works too, although fresh is always nicer.

Great flavours - I've made this recipe about 20 times now. Makes a great light low-fat side dish.

I first of all tried soaking the cucumbers in white vinegar, this can be done and is good but next time I would like to try and use green onions and mustard seed. Maybe if I am ever daring I could throw in some tomatoes as well.

Given all the positive feedback I thought that I would have this one in the bag.....I was let down.

WOWSA!! Hard to believe such great flavor comes from just a few simple ingredients. Will make many many more times.

Great recipe to help me out with all of the cucumbers I have in the garden!

What a delightful change from the traditional sour cream cucumber salad recipe! I used regular extra virgin olive oil and it turned out great. Also used dried dill - my husband took one taste of it and took the whole bowl outside to eat!
