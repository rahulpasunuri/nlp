This is one of my favorite recipes. Warm, crunchy, chewy, savory, salty, vinegary... Using sliced french bread is pretty messy, I prefer a kaiser or other round roll slightly hollowed out like a po' boy.

This was really good. We like garlic so I added a bit of finely chopped garlic to the olive oil for the bread. I think I might grill the steak next time and will broil the bread because it cooked too unevenly in the pan, with all the flavors here you are not going to miss the little bit of pan juices. Great recipe!

This is just a magnificent recipe! I kind of went my own way abit, using plain old toast with a slice of thick cheese to melt once the steak has been put on and skirt steak, but the combination of tomato, (got to be kalamata olives!) and red wine vinegar is just brilliant. I added some lean bacon to the mix, if you want abit more of a meaty flavour. Definate favorite with the hubby! As to it being not authentic texan, so what? Good is good!

Wonderful! Don't listen to the Texan! My friends are very picky eaters and they loved it! We were a little skeptical of the ingredients but they come together beautifully and I don't even like tomatos!

Where did anyone get the idea that this was Texas Style steak? No self respecting Texan would cooka steak this way. Brown sugar and kalamata olives on French bread? Get out of here. This was BAD.

Excellent! This is a very flavorful recipe and great for easy entertaining or a quick weeknight dinner. I doubled the rub mixture, grilled the sirloin, and used sandwich rolls which I also grilled. I made a full recipe of the relish for 2 people and there was a little leftover
