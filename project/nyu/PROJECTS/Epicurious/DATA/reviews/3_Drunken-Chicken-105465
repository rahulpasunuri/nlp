I don't get it. "For the marinade" gives the marinade ingredients, so what are the ingredients above that? salt, butter, sweet white wine, flour, chicken stock, when and where do you put those?

No review, just two comments. (I haven't made this chicken). One cook said that "alcohol dries out" the chicken. I've never heard that in my life! I cook with wine all the time ... Then, I hope no-one actually found "Cape Riesling". It should have read "a South African Rhine Riesling". "Cape Riesling" won't be sold abroad -- it's a name for an inferior grape type which is not a real Riesling at all. An estate-made Riesling should be okay.

It didn't have much flavor. Too Bland..

Wonderful! I used this recipe to feed twenty. Made boneless, skinless breasts and drumsticks. I doubled the marinade recipe, and let the pieces "soak" for 24 hours. Then I browned the chicken, and finished baking in a Nesco. Used the fry pan "remains" for the gravy. The pilaf was delicious -- couldn't get the dried apricots, so I used orange essence prunes instead.

Though I've never made the pilaf part (so you should add that grain of salt to my four forks, I usually serve it with potatoes), this chicken recipe has become one of my all-time favorites. Very easy and turns out delicious every time. That said, to the cook in San Diego, I think it really is the gravy that makes this dish; however, though I've never experienced dry chicken, I've also never had it without the sauce (of which everybody takes seconds and thirds), so that might be why. (Though this chicken seems to cook a bit quicker... I wonder if leaving it in too long could dry it out, too?)

This was nasty. Never again.

Underwhelming. That's what my husband had to say. He was being kind. I should have trusted my instincts on this one before wasting $$$$ on the wine/brandy. Alcohol (as we all know) dehydrates -- so no big surprises that the chicken was dry. Aside from the dryness, the flavors were not complex enough. To be fair I did not make the gravy, but I think the chicken should be able to stand on its own. As my moniker indicates, I am a bit of a chicken fanatic -- so you can imagine my disappointment! It is very rare that I give a recipe one fork, but this recipe deserves no more. With regard to all the four fork ratings, all I can say is that people have different tastes.

I marinated 4 whole chickens in large ziplock bags, transported to dinner party, baked them there. Worked out great and everyone loved it.

I enjoyed this recipe alot and I really enjoyed how the barley complimented the chicken, but I was really surprised by how long everything took me. I will make definitely make this again, but I want to be the first to warn everyone that the results are good, but you'd be wise to set a few hours aside.

This chicken was AMAZING! I did it the faster way, allowing chicken pieces to marinate for an hour and it was really incredible. I substituted white grape juice for sweet wine to save on dough, and it was terrific. Everyone loved it! Soooo juicy!

We substituted cornish game hens for the chicken and it was fantastic. We're having 15 people for a dinner party this weekend and this is definitely on the menu -- and this time around I'll make the accompanying pilaf. We loved this recipe and highly recommend it!
