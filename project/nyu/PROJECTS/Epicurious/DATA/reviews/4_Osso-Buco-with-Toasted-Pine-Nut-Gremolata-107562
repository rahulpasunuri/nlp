This is delicious and great for dinner parties; you can make it ahead and rewarm when ready to serve. I took the time to make the tomato sauce from scratch but I think you could used something from a jar in a pinch. Right before serving I tented the shank and reduced the sauce quite a bit; I wanted it thicker with more intense flavor. Don't skip the gremolata; its spice and acid really compliment the richness of the dish nicely.

Pleasantly filling. The wine added that very special flavor. The ingredients with the exception of the meat are usually found in the kitchen

I make osso buco about once a month--it's so good. To cheat a little, I do 3 shortcuts: 1) I use a can of good Italian tomatoes that I break up with my fingers instead of the tomato sauce. 2) Since veal is so expensive in this country, I often use regular beef shanks from a butcher. Four pieces of about 2" thick only costs about $12 total. It's not as delicate, but tastes wonderful anyway. 3) I add fennel bulb along with the onions, green fronds cut away but reserved for garnish, bulb quartered lengthwise, cored, and cut into about 1/4 inch slices. I used to make this for Italian friends in Rome. Cooking is so regional in Rome that they often had never had eaten it before. I always serve it with a traditional gremolata (no horseradish), risotto alla Milanesa (simple risotto with saffron), and a simple salad of fresh field greens.

I make this once a year in the fall for dinner guests. It is simply amazing. You put in the oven several hours before dinner so you can spend time with your guests and pull out a show stopping dinner and make it look so easy. Never bothered with the gremolata - you don't need it.

Very solid recipe but much prefer without the tomato sauce and with larger amounts of celery and onions.

This was very, very good. I made the tomato sauce (which I didn't care for on its own--and wrote a separate review for that) and the veal/chicken stock which was great! Although I didn't really care for the tomato sauce, it did fine as an ingredient in the osso bucco. I made the gremolata, but went to 3 stores searching for the fresh horseradish, and couldn't find any, so had to leave it out. I made this for a dinner party, and cooked 30 center cut veal shanks, doubling the tomato sauce, stock and gremolata recipes. I did tie each shank w/butcher string to hold it together, but after searing them, the string kinda fell off most of them. Two hours of braising in the oven, and the meat was falling off the bone. Made it the day before using it, so reheated the next day for an hour. The flavor was delicious, although I kinda wish the shanks themselves held together better for presentation, but that's not a big deal. It was a great recipe!

pressed for time, i used some frozen pork loin chops instead of the veal, and basically cut the cook time in half and adjusted the ingredient amounts--the sauce didn't cook down right, but that's my fault. it did turn out very well, and i added a couple splashes of olive oil to the gremolata, which really set it off and opened the flavors up nicely. took me twenty minutes to prep, an hour in the oven, and my family loved it, picky kid included. good recipe with ingredients that should already be in your fridge.

Horribly, horribly disappointing. The sauce was greasy, and the flavors did not meld even though I made the dish (sans gremolata) a day in advance, let it rest, and de-fatted the surface. I can't get over how bad this was. I am an extremely competent cook, so I feel confident that I used good technique. My husband, who is very supportive, said, "I'm sorry, but it is not up to your usual standard."

I have made osso buco before, and this is by far the best recipe. It is saucy and flavorful. Only changes- purchased veal stock (William Sonoma) and made it a day in advance, which really enhanced the flavors. Definetly make the tomato sauce! Served with fettucine and salad...AMAZING

Making the tomato and chicken stock from scratch makes this a very time consuming recipe, not worth all that time. Was very good but too greasy. The Gremolata is dry and overpowering in parsley flavor...it just doesn't go with the veal.

Have made Osso Buco before but decided to try Mario's recipe. Plates were licked clean! I served it over a creamy polenta with fontina - used the coarsely ground corn meal for a heartier polenta that could stand up to the Osso Buco with the sauce. It was a great hit.

Really impressive. This was my first time preparing Osso Buco and there will be many more to come. My guests and I enjoyed the Gremolata and although one of my guests revealed that he didn't like horseradish, he said this was different than anything he tried before and actually enjoyed the Gremolata.

Wow! This is a truely hearty & flavourful dish that is easy to make. I couldn't find veal shanks so I used lamb shanks instead, and now having made it both ways I am sticking to the lamb, a bit sweeter. I made the tomatoe sauce, but used basic chicken broth(w/out MSG)and haven't used the gremolata since the first try...It might appear like it takes a lot of prep, but once you've done it once, it's quick, you just have to account for the time in the oven. This one is a keeper and everyone loves it!

I served this to my supper club this evening, and it was a giant hit. I didn't have the right amount of pots and pans to do 2 whole shanks (I was serving 10) so I got 10 cut shanks and used both a dutch oven and a big fry pan. I made both the tomato sauce and the broth, but used veal scraps that the butcher gave me for free instead of chicken for the broth. I used the amounts specified in the sauce and broth recipes, and it was enough for all 10 shanks, and they were huge. I made it all yesterday, and reheated for nearly an hour before dinner. Actually only 8 people showed up. I was hoping for leftovers, but there is nothing! The meat was so tender and the whole dish was perfect. I made the gremolata also. This dish does take some time, but it's definitely worth the effort!

Made for dinner party - even the professional chef in the group asked for the recipe. Had never cooked veal before but it was so easy there were no moments of panic! Made the chicken stock and tomato sauce from scratch (worth it). Also, the gremolata added a depth of flavor that was wonderful.

This is a really superb rendition of a classic. Veal shank is a knockout but hard to find and expensive where we are. Made it with chicken thighs to rave reviews. Use bone-in, trim excess skin and brown the thighs. Reduce as necessary the gross amount of liquid needed. The Gremolata is the key. Poor Man's Osso Bucco!

This is really grand! DON'T skip making the gremolata! It really adds to the depth of flavours and is very easy to prepare. A truly memorable meal. Served with smashed garlic potatoes and green beans. Great for guests!

I had osso buco for the first time a couple of weeks ago at a restaurant and absolutely loved it so decided to try to make it. This recipe absolutely killed the one at the restaurant though. One of my favorite meals ever.

My husband LOVED this dish. I highly recommend using fresh ingredients- MAKE THE TOMATO SAUCE! It's fantastic! I served it with baked red potatoes/porcini mushrooms and crusty bread. It was delicious. I took the other viewers advice and skipped the gremolata. I plan to make it next time to see how it could actually improve this 'already excellent' dish. Great dish for those who appreciate a lot of flavor! Yum!!!!!

I can only echo the previous raves. I had never made osso buco before; the one time I had it in a restaurant it was so rich and fatty that I was turned off. But when a local supermarket had veal shanks on sale, I decided to try it. I cheated with canned Italian tomato sauce and chicken stock, with a little beef stock thrown in, and it still turned out great. Definitely a meal fit for company, especially since it can be started so well ahead of time.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a HUGE HIT. Easy because it could be made ahead. The home made tomato sauce is the KEY. I started the gremolata, but forgot to make it and everyone still loved this dish. I had some REAL FOODIES over and they still loved this.

I've been making Mario's dish of osso buco for the past 8+ years and still get rave reviews! It's a wonderfully simple dish with very robust flavors. I serve it for dinner parties often over polenta loaded with white cheddar cheese, a huge caesar salad and lots of fresh crusty italian bread. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm good!

I will use this basic osso buco recipe to the day I pass on. With the exception of the chicken stock, where I prefer rich veal stock, and the addition of some orange zest to the sauce, I would never change a thing. Use Gavi for the white wine if you can find it in the Italian section and serve with a nice Barolo. Mmmm..

I have made Mario's recipe for osso buco for over 2 years now and I get nothing but high praises. This is by far the best osso buco recipe!!! This recipe will stay forever in my file.

Had 2 famous cooks over for dinner and they raved. I did make everything from square one. Including the broth. It was the best. It did take time however and I made it the day before.

Fantastic. That the first time I make a Batali´s recipe. I cooked the day before and left in the refrigerator. The flavor was superb, and I even could remove some of the fat. As a side dish, polenta with parmesan cheese.

Delicious...I have never gone wrong with Mario Batali's recipes. We will be serving this dish again. Instead of a whole shank, I purchased excellent shank pieces, 2 " thick, and made the gremola sans the horseradish... still excellent. Great the next day too.

Bursts with flavor, elegant and so easy to make especially for guests. The day before serving them, I cooked 5 veal shanks in an 8-qt stockpot on low heat for 2 hours which was enough to get them to fall off the bone. I brought them to room temperature before reheating again. Don't have fresh horseradish, so I made the usual gremolata from another recipe, but then I even forgot to serve the gremolata and the whole dish was consumed in an instant. Compared with recipes I've used before, what really gives this recipe intense flavor is the "basic tomato sauce" as compared to using simply fresh or canned tomatoes. As for the leftover sauce, my husband used it for chinese noodles.

This was fabulous; I even forgot to serve the gremolata and it was devoured. What do you do with the leftover sauce? We can't figure out whether to put it over pasta, or eat it as soup, or make risotto from it ... any suggestions? It's too good to throw away.

Absolutely fabulous, the veal was so tender and delicious. Definitely worth the time. I served this dish with simple polenta cakes which complemented the the flavor of the gremolata nicely.

I really enjoyed this, and it's surprisingly easy to make. My shank was also cut to 2", but I think it could have used more time in the oven. I reheated a cut the next day, and after it had been in the sauce overnight, it was really much better. I'd say 2.5 hours would do the trick.

This is a very good and very easy osso buco - better than others I've tried. My husband asked for it again only two days after I made it for the first time. This recipe is also in Batali's "Simple Italian Cooking" and is identical except that it calls for the veal shank to be cut into 3"-thick pieces which this recipe, curiously, does not. Mine were 2" thick, from the butcher, which worked quite well.

Talk about comfort food! This is the ultimate. Sooooo good and so worth the time. If you can share it on a winer evening by a fire with THE person in your life. Fear not,this would be really hard to ruin. A completly perfect recipe, this is a favorite at my home. p.s. I used 2 lamb shanks because they were in my freezer-perfect!
