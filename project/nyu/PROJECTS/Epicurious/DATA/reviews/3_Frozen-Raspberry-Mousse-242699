Excellent! A nice light dessert after a big meal.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It tasted like whipped cream - the raspberry taste was completely overpowered. I will not make it again.

I have made this recipe several times and today I chopped up 2 choc/mint pieces and placed them on top of each parfait, yummy and made just a little nicer...chocolate & raspberries what a combo

Tasted like pink cool whip.

I love the unique taste of the sour cream in this recipe and it is very easy to make. I would suggest that the raspberries be strained after pureeing to get rid of the seeds. It makes for an even smoother texture.

Wow! So little effort for something this delicious makes the recipe a great discovery. I made half the recipe and used raspberry liqueur (Razzmatazz). I froze the mousse in four Tupperware parfait glasses from which they can be transferred when defrosted, if the occasion calls for a more formal parfait glass. After making the No-Bake Fresh Fruit pie on this site, I had some extra raspberries and this recipe made good use of them since they needed to be pureed and frozen. If one has a few raspberries and doesn't know how to use them, making this mousse is wonderful idea.

I too loved this recipe, it was easy and fed lots. I used triple sec instead of the Kirsch and it tasted great.

I loved this recipe. I skipped the Kirsch and added less sugar as my raspberries were so sweet I didn't need it. I'll definitely make it again, and next time will layer berries into the mousse itself. Delicious and beautiful.

Used 2 qt casserole instead of individual cups. Of necessity, I substituted cassis for kirsch. This is a delicious, make ahead, refreshing summer treat, our guests raved about it. B.J. Harrick
