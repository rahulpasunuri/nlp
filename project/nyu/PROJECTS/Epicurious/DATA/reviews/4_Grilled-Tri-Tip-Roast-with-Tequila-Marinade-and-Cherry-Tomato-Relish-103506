I'm giving this one 3 forks because the meat wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped. I marinated it for about 9 hours and each bite was hit or miss on flavor. I'm going to give a try again, but plan to marinate the meat overnight the next time. The cooking time was perfect. I sliced the leftovers super thin and soaked them in the ju on the carving board, then used the meat for sandwiches for the next night's dinner - much better than the original meal.

This is perfect as is, it's also great on flank steaks or other grill steaks and even chicken or shrimp (just shorten the marinade time). You can add in some grilled chilis as well- but chipotle chili powder adds a nice flavor as well.

Delicious as is!!

Great recipe, but I changed it up a bit. Instead of cilantro I used parsley, instead of tequila I used red wine, and instead of cumin I added 2 teaspoons of spiced cocoa powder. It was awesome. You could probably get away with 1 1/2 tsp. of cocoa powder. To keep meat from burning or drying out, use some aluminum foil and make a pan, set at on the bbq,and pour the rest of the marinade in with the meat.

Delicious recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. Got many compliments from guests, and several people asked for the recipe. I bought a good piece of meat at a butcher shop; I feel that for a recipe this good it is worth buying the meat at a place that has a really good butcher.

I made this as described and quite enjoyed the dinner and the leftovers, but it required a lot of chopping (the relish) and planning (the marinade). The taste was good but didn't justify the effort for myself. I might make it again for other people.

I chose a new york strip roast for additional tenderness and marinated for 6 hours. Subbed a minced jalapeno for the canned chiles. It's a great meal, especially for dinner parties, as you can prep all in advance.

Amazingly delicious! Followed the recipe but added a little honey and crushed red pepper to the marinade and marinated the tri-tip overnight. My boyfriend was skeptical about the tri-tip and thought it would come out tough, but it came off the grill tender, juicy, flavorful, and perfectly medium-rare. Our finicky, picky friend loved it so much that he stole the leftovers...should have made two steaks instead of just one! Will definitely make again, especially for a crowd, since this is not only an economical cut of steak, but also super delicious.

I've used this for tri-tip many times and like the other reviewers really enjoyed it. This is also a great fajita marinade. I use scored flank steak, marinate for 6- 8 hours and grill along with lots of onions, peppers etc for fajitas. Add some Trader Joe's spicy guocamole and it's easy and quick.

This was excellent!! Very flavorful. I took the left over marinade and heated it up on the stove and added some cream cheese (sour cream would have worked too, but I did not have any). The sauce was phenomenal, made it awesome. I did not make the relish. Be sure to slice the meat thin.

This marinade is OUTSTANDING! I generally use recipes as a guide, but did follow this one as written. I have made it twice, never with tri-tip or cherry tomato relish though. Once with flank steak (marinated 48 hours) and once with filet mignon (marinated for 24 hours). Yum!

I have used this marinade for 2 years now (my first review of it was back in July 06) and have always loved it. I do reduce it on the stove and add cream to make a sauce; this time I used it on a pork tenderloin and tried some of the sauce on the broccoli I served with the pork--it was awesome!

The first time I made this recipe, I used tri-tip. It must have come from an incredibly stressed-out cow, though, because though the flavor was awesome, it was like chewing a yummy, meat-flavored tire. The next couple of times I used flank steaks, and it was perfect. Everyone whos tried it has liked it. My only gripe is that its not one of those marinades that holds up well as leftovers (a flank steak is good for 2 meals and some pickin at for us unless we have help). Guess Ill have to make sure people are over when I make it!

Absolute crowd pleaser!! I made this for a big group and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the tri-tip and some asked for the recipe! I agree with one reviewer who suggested getting your tri-tip at Costco, if you have one nearby. Their tri-tip is awesome. I marinaded for 24 hours, and it was very good. Next time I will marinate for 2 days as I'm sure the flavors will be greater! I will not be serving pre-marinated tri-tip from the store anymore!! This one is a keeper!!

Made this to bring to a bbq tonight and liked it alot. I used fresh oregano and a single 3 lb. tri-tip but otherwise followed the directions, and marinated it for 24 hours. I think 2 days flavor would be even better, as suggested. I'm not a big meat eater, and think this cut can be tough unless it's sliced very thin, but the marinade is very good and very easy. I put it together in about 10 minutes. I reduced the sauce and added about 1/4 cup heavy cream -- it was very lime-y but went well w/ the meat. I didn't try the cherry tomato relish but will next time.

This receipe has potential but, something was missing. I added additional garlic and green onion. I too reduced the oil in half(good call). I think the soy sauce did not offer enough salt.

This marinade is a keeper! I cut down on the cumin a bit and added more oregano, but otherwise made it as written. I also took the advice of another reviewer and reduced it on the stove and added cream to make a sauce, which was fabulous! I have made the marinade for both beef tips in a cold salad and for pork tenderloin, and it works as well with one as the other. The second time I served it with the Tohu Gisborne Unoaked Chardonnay, and it was amazing with the sauce! I haven't tried the cherry tomato relish, but if it's as good as the marinade, I'll love it.

As usual, I adapted this recipe to fit what I had in the house (and garden) and wanted to pass along my variation because it was great! I had Meyer Lemons on the tree needing to be picked so I substituted those for the lime, and I used fresh thyme instead of cilantro b/c it too was in the garden and cilantro wasn't! I cut out the cumin b/c I don't like cumin with lemon. I did follow the tomato relish recipe to the "T" and It was just great!! Next time I'll stick to the lime and cilantro recipe, since it sounds so good, but don't hesitate to try my lemon/thyme version. Once again, I am reminded that fresh herbs make all the difference. Worth the cost at the grocery store if you don't have them in your garden!!! Better yet, plant some!

I cooked this in the oven for about 40 minutes then let is sit out for 10 before cutting. It was perfectly cooked. I found the cherry tomato relish to be a bit much and too oily so next time I will cut the recipe in half. All in all it was very flavorable and easy.

After reading 165 reviews on this recipe I am having a hard time understanding why everyone raved about the marinade recipe.

We really enjoyed this dish. I don't live close to town and didn't have tequila, so I used whiskey (next time I'll be better prepared). Thanks to other reviewers, I also added a few small, seeded jalepenos to the marinade and mixture and then whirred the ingredients in a blender. Very simple. Since I only needed to make one roast, I had lots of marinade left over, so after removing the meat for grilling I put the remaining marinade in a saucepan, brought it to a rolling boil, and reduced it by about 1/3. Then added a good splash of cream right before serving. It was a wonderful addition to the meat. Didn't do the relish, but might try that when cherry tomatoes are in season. This is easy, delicious summer grill fare.

This is a family favorite. It is easy to make and always comes out tasty. Definately use good tequila and don't skimp on any of the ingredients. Yes, 7 cloves of garlic seems like a lot but it really is tasty. We were first introduced to tri-tip when we lived in central CA, but this is definately better than any we had there. For those who think the meat is tough, make sure you are cutting across the grain it makes a HUGE difference!

I have made this numerous times for dinner parties and it is always raved over. I marinate the tri-tip about two days, and then put it under the broiler so the meat is about 5 inches from the flame. I broil it about 10-12 minutes on each side, then wrap the meat in aluminum foil and let it sit while I finish the rest of the meal. Leftovers make FABULOUS soft tacos the next day.

Yummy! Made as written the first time with great results. I do like marinating overnight if there is time. I have added chipotle peppers as another reader suggested.

I've made dozens of very successful and interesting meat marinades, but this is my new favorite. Definitely marinate the meat one day ahead for the best flavor. (When I marinate the meat overnight, I leave out the lime juice and add it to the recipe just a couple hours before grilling).

Rating: 3
Delicious...the longer it marinates the better it gets! I didn't have tequillia on hand, and I'm not fond of the taste. I substituted a white balsamic vinegar(probably any vinegar would do) which was wonderful. I thought 10 minutes per side on the grill was a bit too long. About 8 minutes per., would yield a more medium rare roast. Great, complex flavor, I would make this again!

We've made this three times in the past two weeks. Best, best marinade ever. Using other meats besides Tri-tip is scrumptious, but Tri-tip is, so far, the best. We've never made the relish. This is a guaranteed crowd pleaser. Thank you, Epicurious.

Very good. I only marinated for 1 1/2 hours and the flavors came through, although I will try it for longer next time. I just cooked one 2 lb tri tip so halved the marinade recipe and it was plenty. The blender idea sounds good, I might try that or my food processor next time. I also made the tomato relish and it was very good, although probably not critical to the meat. DON'T do what I did and let your husband sear the meat too high -- it was perfectly medium rare inside, but we had to trim off the edges of each piece to avoid the burn taste from the outside. He's still learning to barbecue...

With no tequila in the house, I used an inexpensive brandy, and it worked fine. The meat was tender and didn't taste of alcohol. This recipe made me realize that barbecuing is really the best method of cooking tri-tip because it renders a lot of fat from what is otherwise a pretty fatty cut of meat. I've had bad experiences with roasting it (even at a very high temperature) because so much fat remained.

It was by accident that I marinated this tri tip for 48 hours. Barbecued it by cooking over the coals and then moving it off to the side for another 15 minutes or so. I don't like it rare but pink inside. While it was flavorful, it was not possible to cut with a fork like some people say. The marinade was fine. I would probably use it again, however, if you want something great for company I don't think this cut is it!

This is my new favorite marinade for tri tip. I've used it twice so far, both times to rave reviews. To add a little kick I put in chipotle chiles (either 3 tbs dried chile powder or 3 canned chiles work well). It adds a great smokey spice flavor that is perfect with the tri tip.

After reading such glowing reviews of this recipe, I was anxious to try it, but was under-whelmed by the result. It tasted ok, but nothing very exciting about it. The Costco meat had a fatty texture that I didn't care for. Maybe if it marinated for a couple days instead of overnight the flavor would improve. I may try this again and tweek the recipe a bit - as suggested by the cook from Snohomish, WA, balsamic vinegar might perk it up.

The marinade was excellent. The Tomato Relish was also excellent with a little modification. We decided to add fresh diced hot peppers (instead of canned) and the juice of one(1)lime.

This is one of our favorite recipes...we've made it many times. I would definitely recommend marinating the meat for as long as you can, because the flavors permeate the meat and it results in a more tender beef. I have adjusted the amount of ingredients slightly to taste. I'd also recommend getting your tri-tips at Costco if you have one in your neighborhood! Their meat is much better than Sams!!!

I have made this several times since I first found it and I just love it. I have 4-5 favorite marinades that I prepare on weekends. Then I go to Sam's and stock up on flank steak and london broils (they have the best meat-always choice grade). I put the various marinades in ziploc bags with the meat, marinade overnight and then freeze them all. That way I have dinner ready to defrost in the morning whenever I need it. This recipe is always included in that process. It doesn't matter what cut of meat you use, its always great!

Maybe it's just me & I'm a very picky person when it comes to flavor. I thought this recipe really lacked in flavor. I marinated 2 tri-tips - one still in the fridge for tomorrow -maybe it will be better since it marinates for 2 days. Maybe some balsamic vinegar would perk it up, I don't know.

I've made this recipe (minus the relish) a couple of times with tri-tip and it's just amazing. But this last time I had lots of marinade left over and couldn't see the point of wasting it. So I tried it with sea bass, figuring a meaty fish was worth a try. I highly recommend it--I think it's even better than with the tri-tip!

Have made this many times and every time it is a major hit! The most delicious marinade. I think the relish is also excellent, especially with the meat. However, you can easily cut the relish recipe in half and have plenty. Great dish for gatherings!

To get it out of the way, I would rate the cherry tomato relish a ho-hum. The tri-tip - that's another story! Great taste! I made more marinade than the recipe called for and used it as a baste while grilling. Marinade for 24 hours and massage the meat through the plastic bag when turning several times during this period. I also sprinkle granulated garlic and Accent on all grilled beef cuts. Try it!!

I didn't make the tomato relish, but the marinade was fabulous! I marinated the roast overnight and the flavors blended together beautifully. Who would've thought that soy sauce and tequila could taste so good together? I wouldn't change a thing, I can't wait to make this again!

There are a LOT of overrated recipes on this web site but this isn't one of them. To go with the margaritas and Corona beers that we were planning on serving at our BBQ party, I thought a tequila marinade would be fun but did not have high expectations as to its culinary merits. I followed the recipe as it is stated and marinated the tri tip over night. Oh gosh, it was fabulous. This is a definite repeat!

This is my very favorite marinade for tri-tip. It's always a big hit. I've made it a few times and always get compliments. I made the cherry tomato relish once and it was OK, but I don't feel compelled to make it again. The meat is so great on its own.

I have used the marinade part of this recipe several times when cooking for a crowd and it was yummy. I never did use the tri-tip roast, but tried several different other cuts of beef - the longer you marinate the meat the better.

After having read ALL the reviews (there are lots) I have made this recipe 3x already, to rave reviews of all! Buying a USDA Choice tri-tip is essential; having marinaded for 4 hrs. the first time, 48 hrs. the next, I feel 4 hrs. is just as good.

I thought the meat was too tough. Perhaps if I had marinated longer than 5 hours I would have been better off. The cherry tomato relish was O.K. but not great.

Fabulous marinade! I marinated the Tri Tips for 2 days as other suggested. The meat was so tender and the marinade flavors really came through. It can definitely be used on other cuts of meat. Our Memorial Day pary guests loved it. I made the Cherry Tomato Relish but forgot to serve it. I tried it the next night and decided it wasn't worth the effort however, it may have made for a colorful presentation.

Many thanks to the reviewer who suggested using this marinade for fajitas. We used chicken and flank steak, and it was the most wonderfully seasoned meat we've had-- makes for a delicious fajita. If I can ever find tri tip here in Canada, I'll definitely make it this way. I marinated the meat for about two full days.

Rating: 4
Marinated the tri-tip about 6 hours and it was absolutely delicious. The cherry tomato relish is a nice accompaniment, though I've used a pico de gallo too. Here's a favorite Pico de Gallo: In a bowl, mix: 2 cups diced fresh tomatoes, 1/2 cup finely diced onion, 2 tbsp minced fresh jalapeno chiles, 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro, 2 tbsp fresh lime juice, 1 clove garlic, finely minced, salt to taste. Cover, refrigerate about an hour for flavors to blend.

This marinade is fantastic! It is so full of flavor that I didn't need to add any salt at all! The tomato relish is the perfect accompaniment to the tri-tip. Carried over the Mexican theme and served with rice and beans. Topped off with a grilled banana split for dessert. MAKE THIS RECIPE!

Excellent Marinade! I kept the Tri-Tip in for 2 days and it was wonderful for Superbowl festivities. I opted not for the relish and it stood well on its own. I did not have enough limes and substituted some lemon juice, and substituted italian parsley for cilantro since we don't care for cilantro. Still had a great flavor. This will go in my book for dinner parties since it is so flavorful and easy to prepare.

The marinade is fantastic. I skip the relish, but use the marinade on shrimp, chicken, flank steak and veggies, grill it all, and serve it as fajitas with guacamole and salsa. It's a hit everytime and so easy to do.

Absolutely delicious! Instead of a roast, I used beef tenderloins for two, and halved the marinade recipe. As for the relish, I used the little grape tomatoes to avoid the extra liquid, and added corn. It was excellent. The flavors and textures are wonderful! Can't wait to make it again.

I've made this marinade 3 or 4 times by now, and every time, no matter what cut of meat I use, it turns out very well. One note -- Use the cheapest, crappiest tequila you can find. No sense in wasting the 100 % blue agave stuff on a marinade. Save it for shots! I have been using a tequila product that can't even be called tequila, due to the 5 % agave that's in it. A two dollar bottle from mexico. Results in a great marinade. Got to do something with this stuff! The worst thing is the person who purchased the $2.00 tequila doesn't even know he got ripped off!

My husband and I polished off the whole recipe in three days and were sorry to see it go. We really enjoyed the tomato relish, but used only 1 T. vinegar and 4 T. olive oil. We have an excellent butcher shop here in Grand Rapids (Van Ball's Meats) that sells only prime beef. Fortunately, the butchers knew exactly what a tri-tip is. For those mid-westerners familiar with sizzler steaks, it's the portion of meat that the sizzler is cut from.

The marinade was excellent. Next time I make it I will set aside some of the marinade to use at the table. I was not as impressed with the tomato relish. If I made it again, I would scoop out the tomatoes before serving.

We had this for dinner last night and will eat the leftovers tonight. It was good, and I plan to save the tri-tip recipe. We didn't, however, really care for the tomato relish. Next time I think I'll make a salsa to serve with the tri-tip.

I have not used the Tequila Marinade on the Tri-Tip Roast yet. I was looking for a Tequila Marinade for Chicken. I have used it on Chicken twice now. It is very good. I look forward to using it on Tri-Tip, if I can find this cut in the Rockford Il area.

I actually did not make this recipe, my dad did. He also just made the marinade, not the relish. He used a sirloin roast and marinated the roast ahead of time to grill at the lake. I have never been a fan of tequila in marinades but this one was very good. I can't wait to try it myself with the relish.

Comment on Tri-tip: I once had a recipe calling for London Broil, and my butcher insisted that I use the Tri-Tip instead (opposite end of the London Broil). It made all the difference and I will never go back to LB again.

I made this with the slaw using napa cabbage as a previous critic stated. Also, I was unable to obtain the "tri-tip" roast, so settled for something similar by recommendation of the butcher. This was very nice with fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden and I would certainly make this again.

This was excellent as written and grilled as the Tucson, AZ (8-20) suggested. The relish could use less oil as suggested. The Spicy coleslaw with cumin-lime dressing that orignally accompanied this is also excellent, with napa cabbage and these recipes make a great meal with rice, white or spanish. The marinade smelled weird at first - boy that was deceiving.

Rating: 3
The marinade is excellent and this cut of meat is very good! I found it to be tender enough to cut with a butter knife. The flavor is great, and the meat is very juicy. The relish went wonderfully with the meat. I accidentally left out the lime peel (doh!) but the food came out great. I will make this again without a doubt (perhaps adding a bit of cayenne pepper or something). The key to getting this one right is to sear the meat on both sides (super hot grill), then turn the temp down, and cook it low and slow :)

This is a big hit with famly and friends; it's just as good cold the next day, if not better. I'm not terribly fond of the cherry tomatoes; next time I may leave them out. Be sure to add the oil slowly to the balsamic vinegar; you want to form a thick emulsion.

The 'cut of meat' is critical. No one in my geography knew what a tri-tip roast was and finally they said that it was a 'silverside sirloin tip cap off roast'. It was tough and we missed the promise of the other reviews. What is a TRI-TIP ROAST??? West coast folks know all about it - South easterner apparently do not! I will try it again if I can figure out what a tri-tip is....

I halved this recipe and used on tri tip steaks. The roasts are hard to find here on the East Coast. I bought the tri tip steaks at Costco. Flavor has a tang to it, but I wish it was stronger. I only marinaded four hours, though.Will make it again and again, marinading over night.

This was the first time I've made a tri tip. It was so delicious and tender. Served 6 with just a little left over. Be sure to marinate it for 24 hours. I did serve it with the cherry tomato relish and everyone absolutely loved it(add a jalapeno).

Very good and easy. I also had never heard of this cut of meat, but my butcher understood, knowledgeable soul that he is. I agree with the cook from Edgewood, WA - every time I see an entry from the cook from Boston/NYC/LA, I know it's going to be a nasty one. I suppose everybody needs an outlet for their anger, and I guess this is a harmless one. I simply avoid reading his (or her) entries anymore. Not worth the annoyance.

Excellent choice for all guests. I marinated it for 2 days - it was SO tender! Even after cooking it to a medium well state! I used the cherry tomato relish - also excellent. However, I, too, would use less oil and I would also mince the chilies into tiny, tiny bits for those who have sensitive palates. Cilantro is also a great addition to this relish (but just a touch.)

This is the best!!! I have many marinade recipes and this one ranks up there at the top. I buy my tri tip roasts at Costco here in Washington.

A wonderful recipe for tri-tip. The marinade was easy to make and had a nice subtle flavor. The relish really makes the dish. Next time I would have the cherry tomatoes at room temperature because refrigerate, it made the relish cold and the tri-tip not as warm as I would like it to be.

Rating: 1
I wasn't crazy about this marinade--the flavor of dried oregano predominated, and while the meat was tender and moist (I marinated 24 hours), other marinades will give the same results. I also thought the tomato relish was boring--all in all, a pretty dish, which presented well, but I wouldn't make it again.

I was SHOCKED at how inexpensive a cut of meat this is... full of fat, a cheaper cut then flank steak!! the marandae was very good, but as I was having a dinner party I only wish that I had purchased a better cut of beef,,, I would think that the sirloin , cut 2 inches think , for grilling would be terrific, I'll try that next time,,, If you "are" trying to keep the budget down, then the tri tip is for you

Rating: 0
Haven't tried this yet but I did have a chat with my butcher. Tri-tips are a triangular cut (makes sense) off the bottom of the same section used for London Broil (comes off the top). So the flavor of a broil and a tri trip are consistent; difference is since the tri-tip is a bottom cut there's more marbling and would be a bit juicier. If you don't see it in the butcher case you can ask for a special cut. A good butcher should be happy to do that. Hope this is useful info.

I made this with a boneless sirloin, and also substituted parsley for cilantro, I decided while preparing the marinade that this might make good fajitas, so I grilled to med. rare, (also grilled some sliced onions ) sliced thin and served with fajita "fixings" and we were very pleased the the result. The meat was tender and flavorful, Nest time I will marinade onions and peppers at the same time.

Outstanding! Having lived in Santa Maria, I used to know only one way to cook tri-tip (Santa Maria BBQ style, with garlic, served with fresh French bread, pinquito beans, and a salad) and have it be tremendous: now I've got two recipes up my sleeve! Thank you, thank you! Also to those looking to find trip-tip outside of California: most butchers know what it is and will cut and trim you a piece. I know. I've done it in 3 states outside of CA!

Just served this for our July 4th barbecue. Very delicious. Marinated it for 6 hours and it had great flavor. Be careful not to overcook it as I did as you will sacrifice a bit of tenderness. I put each tri tip into its own ziploc bag with marinade. I never heard of this particular cut of meat until I moved to California 4 years ago. (I'm a midwesterner) but I think sirloin would work great in its place if you're unable to find it back east.

A very good recipe. The tomato relish is, indeed, delicious. I actually made this with flank steak. Although I grill tri tip quite often, I have begun using flank steak instead for a quick weeknight dinner. I made both the marinade and the relish before work, putting the flank steak in a ziplock bag and refrigerating. When I got home, I fired up the BBQ, plopped the flank on the grill for 5-6 minutes per side for medium rare. Let rest 5 minutes before slicing very thin against grain. My husband made the salad and veggies and we're in business! A very easy meal for weeknights.
