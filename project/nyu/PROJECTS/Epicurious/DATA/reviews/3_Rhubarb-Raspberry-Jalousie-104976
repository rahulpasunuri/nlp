I've made this a number of times and have used apples instead of rhubarb when rhubarb is out of season. Every time everyone loves it. I have lots of leftover filling too, but just save it and use it next time for a quick, but delicious dessert. In Canada, our puff pastry comes in a different size, but each square makes a jalousie for 6 people or so.

Delicious and beautiful! I made the filling the day before, which made assembling this a breeze. Looked impressive, too. Pastry was crisp... don't know what happened to other person's tart. Maybe didn't bake long enough?

Yum! This was a hit at our Easter Brunch -- easy, and unlike the earlier reviewer -- pastry was crisp. I did have extra sauce, which was ideal on vanilla ice cream!

Very disappointed in this one. The pastry turned out soggy though I followed the instructions (I think!) We all agreed we would make the rhubarb-raspberry sauce and use as a topping for ice cream as it was delish!

This was wonderful! The ice cream really complements the tart/sweet of the rhubarb/raspberry combination. Very easy.
