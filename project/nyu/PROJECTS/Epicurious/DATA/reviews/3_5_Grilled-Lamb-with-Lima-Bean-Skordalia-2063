Actually, I think this is a 2.5 fork recipe. Followed the directions precisely, but the lamb tasted way too lemony. I would reduce the lemon rind in the marinade. My dinner guests all agreed.

Terrific! Served this to guests and the skordalia bowl was scraped clean. Recommendations: 1) A really good quality olive oil is a must. 2) Double the skordalia recipe- if you have leftovers, it is tasty on its own.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner and everybody loved it. The Skordalia is a welcome alternative to mashed potatoes--I added a lot more garlic and parsley. We bought fresh lamb from the butcher--makes a good deal of difference. Yum.

I've also used this one as the center of an Easter menu and we loved it - especially the skordalia. My family aren't especially fond of lamb but this recipe passed with flying colors. Thanks for reminding me of it.

Made this last easter, will do it again this year. Crowd is has discerning taste for lamb dishes - no leftovers. I think I made the skordalia a little thin for sauce.

The lamb was outstanding. I've made it several times. So far, however, no one has liked the skordalia.....

This was different and very good. We grilled the lamb leg. I recomment it highly.
