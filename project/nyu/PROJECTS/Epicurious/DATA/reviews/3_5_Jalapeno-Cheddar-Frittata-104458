Easy, great no flour/no meat entree. Caution: don't add salt. For some reason, I thought the recipe could use a small amount; not needed, the result was too salty. This recipe is not as dense as my other frittata recipes, which contain both cottage cheese and Monterey jack cheese. When making this again, consider adding a large can of artichoke hearts. I added red chili peppers, for color, didn't have the sun dried tomatoes. Perhaps they would add the flavor that some say is lacking.

I have made this recipe repeatedly with rave reviews everytime. I've substituted banana peppers for the jalapenos and Cheddar Jack for the Sharp Cheddar and the whole thing still came out D-Lish

This was really an incredible breakfast treat. I used extra jalapenos to challenge the constitution of my friends, but they all really loved it. I'm a bit of a cooking novice, so when I put the eggs on top as the recipe stated, I was more than a little surprised when all the veggies appeared on the top of the dish when it was completed. The eggs had a beautiful consistency and there wasn't a drop left over. I served this with a side of sausages, as I can't eat breakfast without meat. Delish!

This was great. I made it for the office, removing it from the oven at 25 minutes minutes so it wouldn't overcook during the 20 minute drive. I used a small tin of jalapenos, but not the juice, opting instead for green chillies and the juice from it. It was the perfect blend of spicy and mild. For those who found it dry, I would guess it's because the eggs weren't blended long enough. I blended for 10 minutes, and the dish was light moist and fluffy. This will be my new quick fix breakfast staple. I served with mini croissants and bacon.

Made these for Thanksgiving week with relatives. I baked them in mini phyllo shells and it made 7 dozen! I baked them for about 15 minutes on 335 convection. They are VERY spicy and next time I would use less jalapeno. I did add the pickled juice.

Made this for a holiday brunch and got great reviews from guests. I is very nice and fluffy.

I made this with items on hand. I didn't have basil and wanted to keep it more Mexican so I used Mexican oregano instead of basil, Ro-Tel tomatoes in place of sun-dried and added green chiles . I also mixed the jalepeños into the egg mixture to ensure even distribution. Turned out very well.

Didn't know that something this easy could turn out this well. I will make this again and again. Huge hit with guests. Followed other reviewers advice and halved the jalapenos and added 1 lg can of diced chilies. Was the perfect amount of spice. Followed the recipe otherwise. Wonderful! And simple!

This dish is now an absolute favorite. I did add a few ingredients. Organic potatoes and onions gave it a ton of flavor in every bite. I don't like basil or tomatoes so I substituted and found my tastebuds raving. My family was also stunned that eggs could taste this good.

I made half a recipe (enough for 6 ladies) and baked it in an oval casserole dish the night before. Instead of cutting it into pieces, I left it in the dish, warmed and served it like that in the morning. It was pretty, tasty, and not dry. I also used green chilies instead of jalapenos and didn't use any juice. It was enough to give it taste but not make it spicy. Will definitely make it again. Easy, pretty, and crowd pleaser. Everyone went for seconds.

I made this for a holiday brunch, and my family and friends loved it. One guest said this was the BEST egg dish he had ever tasted! It is hot (as in spicy), but delicious.

Easy to make and great for a party. Just make sure you spread the jalapenos out evenly or some bites will be bland and others too spicy.

I've made this dish a couple of times and both times ended up with dry, over-cooked eggs that taste like jalapeno juice. I'm throwing this recipe away so I'm not tempted to try it again.

WOW!! Made this for brunch. It was delicious and very moist. You can even cook it ahead & reheat. I used 1/2 jalapenos and 1/2 diced green chilies. Definitely beat the eggs the full 8 min. The egg texture becomes soft and well integrated. I loved the basil...you can also add bacon/sausage for meat lovers. Super Easy...

WOW! I made this for a party and it was devoured! I tweaked the recipe by reducing the jalapenos and adding some mexican green sauce. I substituted red peppers for the sundried tomatoes and added some caramelized onion and cilantro. I wish I could have this every week!

I made this dish twice. The first time I halved the recipe and it came out great. The second time I made the entire recipe but found that the eggs needed more time to cook... when I pulled it out the first time it was still raw in the middle. You may want to increase your baking time depending on your oven.

I halved the recipe (there are only two of us). Didn't have any basil, but did add in some chopped green onion. Used half cheddar and half pepperjack. Very tasty. A really nice brunch idea, or easy supper.

I substituted cilantro instead of basil and did half jalapenos and half chopped green chilies. It was great and not so hot.

When serving 20+, I've found that not everyone shares the same heat threshold. I was glad I had other dishes to offer at last weekend's buffet brunch. Guests who like spicy/hot dishes really enjoyed this (so did I) - but for broader appeal, next time I'll try the pepper-jack suggestion, or perhaps substitute half of the jalapenos with canned green (anaheim) chilis; this also might keep from overpowering the fabulous sharp white cheddar. (Note - I'd followed the recipe as written.)

My teenage son told me many times how much he liked this dish over the course of several days after I cooked it. He is not usually so excited about food. I thought it was pretty good and certainly very easy. To make it even simpler, I used jalapeno jack cheese instead of cheddar and jalapenos.

To the cook from Calif. - I have made this several times and served room temp. I use mini muffin tins and bake at 350 for about 10-12 minutes. I make them a day ahead and serve room temperature - perfect for a pary! I have also made a week ahead, frozen them and thawed the day before...just as excellent! I am always asked for the recipe.

This is a simple dish that tastes great. I've made it for three parties now, and everyone has absolutely loved it. It's almost like a quiche without the crust. The tomatoes and basil look very pretty in the mixture, too.

Is there any reason that this couldn't be served at room temperature? I'd like to take it to a picnic but am afraid it might not be as good. Has anyone done so and how were your results?

I made it for my first brunch party and everyone loved this recipe. It was very easy when prepped the night before. It was hot - didn't need quite the amount of Jalepeno's. Since one child came I should have kept a section without jalepeno's. Will definitely make this again.

I made this at Christmas and all of my family loved it! Didn't stay around for long.

The "hotness" of this dish depends on the brand of jalapenos used. I made it twice, the first time it was not very spicy, the next time it was quite spicy. Taste your jalapenos first and adjust. Everybody loved it both times.

I love this dish, as does everyone i make it for. I have made this dish numerous times and it has now become a staple for when we have brunches. Recently, we "spiced" it up by adding chipotles-this gave it a bit more of a kick and added a terrific smokey flavor to it

very easy and very good, but if you are looking for a spicy taste it doesn't do it. I could only find jalapeno "nacho" rings. These weren't very hot to begin with. If you aren't afraid to add frech chopped jalapenos on the top i bet they would help. Regular sharp cheddar tasted fine.

Very good! Frittata was enjoyed by all. I was fearful it would be too spicey for kids, but the jalapenos mellowed when cooked. Great for a buffet

Enjoying this (along with the French 75 Champagne drink also found on this site) at this very moment - YUMMY! I reduced this recipe by 1/4 and made it in a pie dish, followed the directions completely except the only ingredient I didn't have on had was fresh basil, so I substituted with crushed/dried. I'm sure it will be even better with fresh and I can't wait to make again and again! You'll love it! KIMBER
