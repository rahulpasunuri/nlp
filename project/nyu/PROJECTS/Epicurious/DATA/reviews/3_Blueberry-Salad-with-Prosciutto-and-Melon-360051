A co-worker brought this in for us to share...minus the prosciutto (we have some non-pork eaters in our group). I didn't care for the onion--way too strong--but liked the refreshing taste of the berries, melon, and fennel with the light dressing. I will certainly try this with my family, along with the prosciutto this time!

Perfect - elegant and sophisticated and DELICIOUS. A fabulous way to spice up the traditional melon/prosciutto combination.

This salad just has way too much going on. I thought the onion/fennel/blueberry mixture would be really good on top of greens, and of course the melon/prosciutto combo is classic. Together though, I was not really impressed. It was hard even getting all the components on the fork at once.

This was a beautiful salad, pretty and using lots of fresh summer fruit. The portions were WAY too big for a side and I would likely reduce this in half to serve as a first course or side again.
