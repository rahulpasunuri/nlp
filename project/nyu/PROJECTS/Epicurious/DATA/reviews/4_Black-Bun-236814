So rich, so full of good things, so spicy, yet so simple! This is almost a meal unto itself. It may be from a Scottish cookbook, or tradition, but I am going to adapt it to the Passover tradition (no leavened bread) as the raisins, nuts and alcohol remind me of "charoset." Please see my website Garden of Lia and join. Thank you.
