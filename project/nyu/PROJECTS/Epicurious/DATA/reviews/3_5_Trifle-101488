This is one version of this incredible dessert. I use preserves and put a complimentary fruit on top of that. Line the cake with sponge cake or lady fingers and the pour about 2 tablespoons of liquor..... put a layer of vanilla pudding or custard,, then repeat the process over 3 times, put fresh whipped cream on top and garnish with FRESH fruits... usually berries of some sort of an artistic look....

An old recipe but one of the best. I used this layered with summer fruits. Guests rave.
