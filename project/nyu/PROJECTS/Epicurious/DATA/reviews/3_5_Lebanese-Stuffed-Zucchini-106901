Some things about this recipe worked like a charm. I used jasmine rice and the dish was cooked in 30-40 minutes, both the rice and the zucchini. However, the color of the steamed zucchini was yellow/gray and unappealing. I admit to some mistakes on my part. I used 12 inch long zucchini from the garden, cut them into 4" lengths and cored them easily with a serrated knife. However, the taste and the texture of these mature zucchini were not worth the effort. However, my biggest complaint was with the spicing of the rice/beef mixture. There was way too much allspice, it overpowered the whole dish. In the end, I threw the whole thing away.

It took an hour for the rice to cook. Also, it needed extra spice.

Excellent. I used mexican squash (calabaza)instead. There are tools in middle eastern or speciality stores to help in coring out the calabaza. Added cumin and red pepper flakes per other reviews. I also pureed a can of stewed tomatoes.

although this has many rave reviews, my sister and I have both tried making this (without realizing we both tried) to the same disappointing outcome in which we literally fed it to the dog. First, I don't have a pot or stove large enough to cook it as the recipe states so I cooked it per the instructions of another commenter at 350 in the oven for an hour 15 minutes. It didn't work. The rice never cooked correctly, the meat over cooked until it was hard and the zucchini was over cooked and limp as a result. In the future, I would precook the meat and the rice. I would brush the zucchini with oil and put it under the broiler for a little bit. Then I would assemble the stuffed zucchini with sauce and a little feta on top and put it in the oven to warm evenly at 350 for 20 minutes. To me, there are too many changes that need to happen to this recipe for it to be adequate; therefore, I can't rate it well. Although the flavors WERE good.

This recipe has been elevated to 4 forks when made with lamb. I followed my notes below, and also added aleppo pepper and cayenne for a kick. Sprinkled some parm on top at the end.

This was delicious. As per previous reviewers, I added 1/2 ts coriander and cumin ea. Used regular zukes. It was hard to get the middle out even with the apple corer. I pureed the seeds with the tomato sauce and it was thick and delicious. I also spiked the sauce a bit with cinamon, cumin, and extra garlic. I think it would be better with lamb.

Yum! I'm not the biggest fan of zucchini but I loved this! Used 5 giant green zucchinis. Followed all the advice of previous reviewers: I add 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp cumin seeds. I did not saute the onions and garlic but added it directly into the mix. I used long grain brown rice. And I also added a handful of chopped cilantro into the mix. The flavor was ethnic, unique and absolutely delicious!

I would give the 3.75 forks. Made some changes based on previous reviews and the fact I was being lazy: sauteed 1 medium onion, 1.5 shallots, and 4 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added 1 lb of lamb and my leftover 1/4 lb of veal. I added two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes as well as 1 overgrown, cubed zucchini and 1 overgrown, cubed squash from the garden. I doubled all of the spices and added cinnamon, chili powder and cumin. To continue with my lazy night dinner (hence the no stuffing and instead cubing), I put 1 packet of instant brown rice into the mixture and then simmered for 10 minutes until the rice was cooked. I topped with mint and a squeeze of half a large lemon. I found this needed more salt than I expected. I served this with a sprinkle of feta cheese (helped with the need for salt.) Amazing and SO easy when done the lazy way! You could easily leave the rice out and serve over noodles. We'll try that next time...

We made this for the first time last summer when we forgot our daily zucchini/patty pan watch and had some huge fresh squash. This recipe is delightful. We make it with lamb or beef depending on our mood. Love what "elliehayes" on 7/09/06 does with the pulp. It is amazing!

Turn your back on the little zucchini for just a few minutes and they grow into baseball bats. This recipe is perfect for those big zucchini. I tried the recipe first as is, then made it with cinnamon and mint as suggested by other reviewers. We preferred it with the tasty add-ins. This recipe has a permanent place in our ever-expanding zucchini repertoire.

delicious, and though it takes a bit of preparation, it is not overall very labor intensive. I plan to make this often. The insides of the zucchini are perfect for zucchini bread.

I do hate when people completely change a recipe and give a plus plus rating, but this one is great as is, and perfect for adaption. I used a variety of vegetables (zuc, eggplant, tomato, and orange pepper) to stuff, and saved all the flesh from them and simply added it to the tom. sauce along with some additional spices and 1/2 cup white wine. As per advice of other reviewers I doubled onions and garlic. I used two shallots and one large onion. Added Indian chili powder, cumin, coriander, and turmeric to the meat and rice mix. Finished with mint. Beautiful recipe. Fresh and multi-seasonal.

This recipe also works well if you simply cube the zucchini and cook with the meat, tomatoes etc. Didn't have a lot of time on a week night. Sauteed everything, then added the tomatoes and simmered until the rice was cooked. Very nice!

Excellent way to use those giant zukes from the garden - I used fresh toms of course and it came out simple but very tasty

This was very good, interesting flavors and a nice change of pace. I accidentally mixed the onion and garlic into the meat, which I think turned out even better as the sauce was somewhat skimpy. I think with a bit of tweaking this could make it to a 3 fork rating.

This was great. It took about 1 1/2 hours, (not the 2 1/4 mentioned at the top). Well worth the time. Exactly the right blend of spices.

This is one of the few accurate stuffed zucchini recipies I have seen, the one I was taught by a Syrian lady had butter added to the meat rice mixture which make these little bundles incredible.

This was actually easier to make than it sounded. I used regular, fat, green zucchini as yellow or Claritas were not available and it was very good. My 3 and 5 year olds ate it right up. I also used brown rice and it stayed a bit crunchy, maybe using pre-cooked brown rice is the trick.

This is an easy (but a bit time consuming) meal. I core out the zucchini with a melon baller. And I don't throw out the meat of the zucchini, I just add it to the sauce and cook it with the stuffed zucchini. That way, there's no waste, and you have your veg. This is a really healthy meal too. And it makes great leftovers.

This was a big hit with my guests. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts to the meat mixture.

My Lebanese Grandmother taught me to make Koosa when I was about 10. This recipe is very close to the one I grew up with. However, I do not precook onion, etc. Simply mix the ground lamb, wached rice and 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes, and plenty of fresh mint with cinnomon, salt pepper and garlic powder. Then to cook, stand the stuffed squash in a large pot - add 1 can of crushed tomatoes and enough water to almost cover the squash. Add plenty of salt peeper, cinnomon, garlic powder and fresh mint(called nana in lebanese) to the zoom. Zoom is a watery tomato sauce - you do not want the sauce to be thick at all. You can add 1 tbls. or so of tomato paste to thicken it very slightly. Simmer on low until rice is tender all the way through, about 1-1/2 hours. To serve, use a knife to horizontially cut a slit in the squash and pour the zoom over it. To make a "litme" the tradional way Lebanese eat their Koosa, tear a piece of lebanse bread and wrap it around each bite of squash. Squash pulp: Cook in large skillet with onion and spices, add 6 beaten eggs and lots of pepper - cook until done - delish!!

I worked in a Lebanese restaurant, and this is almost a perfect copy of their recipe. Easy once you get the zucchini cored.

I had a recipe for stuffed squash from my mid-eastern cookbook which I really liked but it lacked something. I tried this recipe and it was fabulous. It is very authentic. I realize now that the allspice is the missing ingredient from my old recipe. Absolutely delicious; a must use for fresh garden squash.

I used overgrown yellow squash from my garden for this recipie and it was delicious, although the cooking time is way too long. If you are concerned about the rice not cooking, soak it for an hour before mixing it with the meat, and baste with the sauce during cooking. Even my teenager loved it!

This is wonderful. I have made it three times this summer. The first time with yellow summer squash, the second time with with pattypan and the third time a mix of squash and bell peppers stuffed with the meat mixture. I did increase the tomatoes to 4 cups so there would be more sauce. It is a delicious summer dish!

This is a great recipe, jazzed up a notch from the simpler Lebanese way. For the cored portion of the zucchini, chop it up, add onion and saute in olive oil. Add fresh diced tomatoes and a couple of eggs, salt and pepper. Stir it until the eggs are set.

A wonderful dish. We make it every couple of weeks. Its so simple. If you love Middle Eastern food you'll love it. If you've never tried Middle Eastern food make it you'll love it.

I learned to cook from an Arabic lady and this is one of my gavorite recipes. For the "Cook from Atlanta" who mentioned they hated to waste the pulp... Typically the pulp is cooked in a seperate pot with onion and olive oil and a few spices such as allspice then eaten with pita on the side. It's very yummy!

This was a wonderful way to use ground lamb, which my family loves. I chopped the zucchini left from the shells and sauteed it with the garlic and added it all to the sauce mixture. It thickened the sauce and was delicious.

We thought this was a great recipe. Though, instead of the allspice required in the recipe, I used a mixture, which my Egyptian-originated neighbor uses regularly for ground meat, and I suppose that made it even more interesting. It consists of (all ground) allspice, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. You might want to try this.

This was a good week night dish and easy to prepare. However, I hated to waste the pulp removed from the zucchini so I chopped the pulp and added it to the tomatoes in the sauce. This added texture and flavor. Because I didn't have a pan large enough, I cooked the whole thing covered in a large pyrex dish in the oven (@ 350 for 1 hour 15 min.) and it turned out great.

Wonderful! This is a great summertime comfort dish. I have no complaints about any part of it--it was relatively easy to make, tasted great, and made the most of my zucchini. It's important to add a few new zucchini dishes to my repertoire every summer, and this is a keeper.

This was good but not great. I might make it again but if I did, I would partially cook the rice before stuffing the zucchini because by the time the rice was cooked, the squash was a bit too mushy. I did boil the sauce to reduce it and added a tablespoon of butter when I removed it from the heat.
