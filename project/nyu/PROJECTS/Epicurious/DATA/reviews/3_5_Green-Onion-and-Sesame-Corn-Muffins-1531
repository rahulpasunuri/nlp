I'm not always a fan of "stuff" in cornbread, but I love sesame, and love hush puppies (with the onion in the corn batter), so thought I'd give this a try. Made these for a party so doubled the recipe, so keep in mind all notes below refer to doubled quantity. Made as written with only minor changes: 1) I had only one bunch of scallions so could not double those. Sliced a good way up into the dark green part to make maximum use and to get some appetizing green bits in. 2) Sauteed the scallions in 3 tbsp canola oil and 1 tbsp sesame oil to bring out the toasted sesame flavor. Then added 8 oz butter as directed. 3) Didn't have foil cups so sprayed muffin pans with canola oil. Worked fine. 4) Added slightly less sugar and salt (1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3 and 2 tsp salt instead of 3). These baked quickly - done in about 16 minutes - and when filling standard muffin pans 2/3 full the doubled recipe made exactly two dozen. Absolutely delicious! Great flavor and perfect texture - moist inside, crunchy outside. Sesame flavor is noticeable without dominating.

These were interesting. They were a little too salty for my taste, so I would reduce the salt (I did use unsalted butter) if I made them again. They made the house smell GREAT while cooking. Lastly, I have to admit they were delicious "dunked" in the spicy black bean soup recipe on this website. Good soup!!!

These muffins were very good and reminded us of the hush puppies served at a local restaurant. Don't over saute the green onions.
