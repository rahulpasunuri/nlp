Excellent basic shrimp stir-fry. My personal taste is for less ginger and sugar, so I reduced both ingredients by half. For an authentic taste undertone, add a splash of rice wine vinegar (1 teaspoon)and some whole dried hot peppers.

Made this exactly according to the directions, and it was just o.k. Compared to the Thai stir fry (something like gad pai prow) it was a bit dull and lacked a balance of flavors.

This was an easy and very tasty recipe. I have been trying to find a recipe for one of my favorite dishes from a restaurant back home in Minneapolis. I decided to try this hoping it would come close. It indeed did. I added quartered water chestnuts to the red bell pepper, as that is in the dish back home. My husband and I thought this recipe was lovely. This is definitely a keeper recipe. I will definitely be making this again when I start to get that craving from back home!

This is the best! I've made it a dozen times and it's always appreciated by the diners. Substitute Red Wine Vinegar for the Sherry and you end up with a nice Sweet and Sour taste. If you like it spicy, you'll need to add either more chili-garlic sauce or other types of chilis. I used fresh tuna and served it over egg noodles the last time and everyone was delighted.

Very good dish. I used 1 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1 red pepper plus half of a green pepper. Served with rice and sauteed snow peas. Tasty!

Used 1/2 pound of shrimp but kept the sauce at the full amount -- what can I say, like my sauces -- for a two serving meal. Added snow peas and used a red bell pepper for a nice color combination. Will definitely add mushrooms next time, maybe some water chestnuts too.

Mine turned out a lot better than I expected it to. I had no fresh ginger, so I used some pickled ginger instead. I also added some of the juice from the pickled ginger in too. I will definitely keep making it like that, I am going to start making this all the time. The flavor was intense and everyone loved it. I added broccoli and green beans because that is what I had in the fridge, but I agree any vegetable will work. This sauce would be great over salmon, with chicken, even just veggies. I am going to experiment with lime, marinating the shrimps or chicken longer, and baking the sauce over fish.

While I loved this recipe, it is not for those that fear heat. The asian garlic chili sauce I bought at a local gormet food shop was potent. I cut the measurement in half, and my husband still could not tolerate it. I tried to sneak it in the second time around, and he still balked. I will continue to make it, but eat it with those that like a firey dish.

This is a delicious recipe -- and so easy to prepare. It's quite spicy, but we like spicy food so we didn't mind. I threw in some snow peas for color. Very easy to make on a work night.

This packed some heat, I cut down on the chili garlic sauce and added celery for some crunch. Would add more garlic next time.

I asked for an asian dinner and this is what I got. My boyfriend creates some incredible delights in the kitchen and is typically critical of his results, no matter how much I rave. And he really is fantastic! But this was one of the rare times that he said he wouldn't do anything differently. We both truly enjoyed this dish - and it packed some heat. The only variation he made to the recipe is using only 2 tablespoons of the cornstartch mixture. He also doubled the sauce because he loves me and knows what a sauce freak I am!

This is super easy and full of flavor. I will make it again and add more veggies!

This is our all-time favorite shrimp recipe - for family or for company (all preparation except for the actual cooking can be made ahead). Is also very good with cut-up turkey breast

This was so simple to make and to me better than what I get at a restaurant. Added stir fry mix of broccoli, carrots and snow peas. Doubled the liquids to compensate for veggies. Simple and delicious.

I stir-fried some chicken in garlic and ginger, added some vegetables and then put in the sauce in this recipe (tripled the sauce). Very delicious (but I'll put a touch more spicy in it next time)

We really enjoyed this stir fry, though I added an extra bell pepper.

This dish was quick and easy, but left something to be desired as far as flavor goes and it was a little dry. (I like lots of sauce with my stir fry.) I'd fix it again, but with modifications.

I agree with the cook from Charlotte. This is a great staple sauce for any stir fry. I tried it with chicken and lots of veggies (broccoli, snow peas, red peppers, straw mushrooms, carrots) and it was much better than my favorite take-out. I doubled all liquids for a lb. of chicken and lots of veggies.

This is a favorite "quick and easy" recipe in our house. I make it different every time. I have done it with chicken, pork, shrimp and tonight we even had it with leftover cooked steak from our weekend barbeque! Also, I always add veggies...usually broccoli, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, but you can add whatever you have in the fridge. Veggies make it much tastier.

It was delicious with extra garlic! Because I love veggies the next time I will add broccoli and mushrooms. It had just the right amount of heat!

This was awesome!!! Extremely flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. I doubled the soy sauce base and took the suggestion of another writer added broccoli and baby carrots. Instead of traditional rice I used angel hair rice noodles. Served with a traditional green salald with "Old Dutch" Sweet & Sour Dressing. It was a big hit.

It was very good but I expected shrimps to taste more like the sauce. I added less gignger and next time I will use less broth.

Very easy to prepare. I think I'll add some vegetables next time to pep it up - some mushrooms or brocolli stirred in with the bell peppers. Try it with rice noodles.

Specy, Spicy!! I love spicy food, but this has too much HOT and overides the flavor. I think a bit less of the red pepper would improve the overall experience.
