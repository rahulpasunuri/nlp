This is our go-to glaze for salmon. Simple, easy, and delicious.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple. This will be my staple glaze for salmon going forward. I did add some chile-garlic sauce. I am looking forward to substituting some wasabi in next time for the mustard (I used a basic dijon and wanted more spice, but that is just my personal preference.) Oh, and since I don't grill much in February, I just slightly oiled a glass baking dish, poured all of the glaze evenly over four salmon filets, and baked at 375 until the glaze was bubbly and the salmon flaked! YUM!

The glaze is overpowering for the salmon -- probably appeals more to those who don't really like fish

This recipe gets four forks because of its simplicity. I added about a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce since I was using regular Dijon mustard and it was awesome. Totally a do-able weeknight dinner.

I make this recipe often, exactly as it is written (ok, maybe I go heavy on the Chinese hot mustard). It is stupidly simple and always yields a delicious result.

Absolutely delicious. I made the glaze without the rice vinegar and it tasted just fine. I mixed jalapeno mustard and dijon mustard. And I also added some wasabi soy nuts to the sauce as well. It gave it a little kick. We glazed 1 pound of Alaskan salmon and had leftovers for drizzling.

I made this recipe for my husband, who is not a lover of salmon. However, he thought the glaze was "too sweet" and said he'd rather have grilled salmon unadulterated. Hmmm, go figure. I thought the glaze was good, but nothing special. I didn't have Chinese-style hot mustard so used Dijon, and perhaps the glaze would have been better with the hot mustard as some reviewers have said. Probably won't make this again though.

I just tried this one tonight and even my 13 year old son who doesn't like salmon that much loved it. I agree with what someone else said that you really do need to use the hot mustard and you should definitely make extra. I will make it again!!! One other thing...I used Splenda brown sugar and it was excellent with that...

This was very good and very easy to make. I didnt change anything. Probably 3 1/2 forks, but not "exceptional." I had plenty of sauce and did not need to make extra. Will definitely make again.

Hot diggity! THIS is really good! Instead BBQ, we baked it (15 minutes at 350). Before putting the marinade on the fish, we poured a little melted butter into the dish and on top of the fish. Definitely double the sauce (maybe even triple it). When the recipe calls for setting aside some marinade with the rice vinegar...double/triple the amount of marinade you put in the small bowl. That way you can pour the marinade/vinegar mixture on your side dishes. We poured ours on white rice. So good.

We loved this recipe, just like everyone else. I'm on Weight Watchers and it's a very diet-friendly recipe without tasting like diet food. We'll probably make it once a week from now on.

OK people! I am review #327..... for anyone familiar w/ this site... if a recipe has 327 reviews... there is definitely something rockin about it! Awesome way to prepare salmon -- use as directed, with one small, teeny upgrade..... once you pull these babies off of the grill (and add more glaze) douse, and I mean DOUSE the salmon with fresh squeezed lime juice - kicks it up way, way.... trust me on this one! Incredible... served w/ mango salsa, sticky rice and tropical- inspired salad (oh yes, and Blue Hawaiians -- you get the theme on this one.....) Yum!

I remembered this recipe and came to look for it. Always a big hit. Sometimes I will marinate the fish in some OJ and Jack Daniels before cooking adds a nice punch. I have used all types of vinegar and mustards. I love this with sauted spinach or chard and potatoes of any ilk.

this was awesome and SO easy. used fillet, brushed flesh side and put that side down on grill first, then switched to skin side and basted with remaining. I didn't need the additional sauce for drizzling at the end, there was still plenty on it. I will def. be making this one again. Oh yeah, and I used a firey hot IPA mustard from anderson valley brewing company. Certainly a spicy mustard is essential. http://avbc.catalog.com/viewProduct.cfm?item_id=705473

This is a nice recipe. We make it with a large fillet and grill it on a piece of foil. We don't flip it, we just grill it until it's cooked through and baste often. I usually double the sauce recipe so I can have twice as much to drizzle on afterwards which is key. I serve it with "Grill Potato and Onion Packets" (on this site) and a salad. The meal is always a hit. This glaze is salty-sweet so if you are in a strictly savory mood, try a different one.

Simple and delicious. Based on other reviews I used the dijon/wasabi mixture and heat was perfect. Tripled amount of sauce - 1/3 for the salmon, 1/3 to drizzle over after grilling, and 1/3 tossed with onions and carrots and roasted as a side dish. Yummy. Will become a staple for our summer grilling.

This salmon was perfect - it will be a new staple at my house. We ate it all up and wished that there was more. The only adjustment I made was to add some thinly sliced green onions to the sauce. Served with basmati rice and a field green/avocado salad and we were in heaven. I do think that the hot mustard is the key to this recipe....I would not make it with the Dijon. I hardly ever give a dish four forks but this one earned it.

After all the rave reviews, I found this recipe very disappointing. It was way too sweet for our tastes.

Rating: 3
I've made this twice and both time it was really yummy. I guess I forgot to read the directions both times, because I've been marinating the fish in the glaze for 40 minutes or so each time. I also cook the fish skin-side down on a sheet of aluminum foil until the top is alllmost done. (If people are uncomfortable with that, a quick broiling cooks the top quite well.) Fine on its own, the fish was spectacular when rolled up in a sheet of nori with seasoned sushi rice and salty collard greens seasoned with sesame oil. I called them nori tacos and they are really worth trying.

Mmmm...delicious! Really accentuates the flavor of fresh wild salmon without overpowering it, and very easy to make (don't tell your guests!).

Spectacular! We used skinless salmon fillets and took the Chinese mustard option. Needs much less time on the grill than in the recipe -- we found that 3.5 minutes on the first side and 3 on the second side cooked it perfectly. Served with long grain white rice that tasted great when it soaked up the sauce. Amazing flavors -- can't wait to make it again!

This was perhaps the best salmon I've had and certainly the best one prepared on the grill. On a Saturday afternoon, I was looking for something simple and delicious and this was hit. I stuck to the recipe and it was a real hit. Use the dark brown sugar.

We eat salmon all the time here in Vancouver. This recipe has been a staple for me for a number of years now.

I soaked an old lonely fillet of salmon with the skin in buttermilk to thaw out for dinner. I was so sure it would taste fishy, so just prepared 1 serving. Next time it will be for 2. As another chef/cook did, I wallowed it in the glaze sauce after drying it from the buttermilk. Grilled on the George. 4 minutes. Drizzled the reserved glaze over it--so easy. So good.

This dish is wonderful if you like salmon, if you don't it probably won't mask the flavor enough.

Most of the time I would agree that grilled salmon all by itself is terrific - I make an exception with this recipe. I made it exactly as written, with Dijon mustard, and doubled the amount because I had a large filet of salmon. Next time I will make more of the sauce to pass around as it was very popular. The glaze can be put on as lightly or as heavily as you want because it does not overpower the fish and the mustard balances out the sweetness. I served this grilled on the BBQ in the dead of winter and it was a delicious entrée. Try it!

This is such an easy dish with ingredients one would likely have in the pantry at all times that I feel its a definite keeper. Its not a finicky sauce so taste as you go, we would like it a little less sweet. I used wasabi lime mustard but is was so sweet it got a little lost. I made it with rice that I added a scallion with mostly the greens and the zest and juice of one lime for the side along with spinach. Yummy and so easy for a quick spring meal.

I ahve made this dish many times and agin just last night, as usual it was great. Seems it gets better and better each time I fix it. I pretty much follow the recipe, I do make extra sauce as many other reviewers do. I also use fillets and skin them... I served with spring asparagus and a wild and long grain rice mixture.. I added wild mushrooms to the rice. I gave this recipe to a local fine dining restarant a few months back and it was added to the menu eith success.. I use farm raised Atlantic salmon as it seems to be more consistant in this area where fresh fish is impossible to get.. It works out very well..

Just a comment re the cook from Union City's review: it's been said a hundred times over, but apparently, it still needs repeating-- if your fish smells or tastes "fishy", it is not fresh! Fish should have the pleasant, briny aroma of the sea. It should never smell or taste bad. No recipe will mask less than stellar seafood. I urge you to find a reputable fishmonger (with a very high turnover) and make this recipe again using only the best ingredients-- you will be amazed at the difference in taste! By the way, I make this recipe whenver we get a hankering for salmon, and it's great. I love the sweet/hot combination!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years and it's one of my favorites. I use salmon fillet, triple the glaze ingredients and add bourbon to the sauce, cooking it down until the alcohol has burned off and the the glaze has thickened. I also tend to add extra brown sugar to get the correct sweet and spicy balance. Then I cool the glaze and add the fish to marinate over night. The flavor is fabulous!

Loved this recipe! Very easy and all ingredients are pantry staples. I too used salmon filets as they cook more evenly on the grill. To the cook from PA - why on earth would you want well-done fish? Especially salmon Oh you are missing out. I cut down on the sugar just a little bit.

update: Wow, I'm so surprised that folks have turned forks down on this great glaze. We love it! I wonder if they left out a step or something? This is a great recipe that can be used on lots of different fish, but last night we had it with sockeye salmon. I went really easy on the sauce, since this is such a great piece of fish, and served most of the glaze over the red potatoes. What a treat! It's also a fantastic way to disguise not-so-great chicken cutlets if you need to clean out your freezer! The best is when you use just ordinary grocery salmon, it dresses it up and makes it special, even on a Tuesday.

Living in the Pacific Northwest, we eat lots of salmon. Made this with VARIATIONS and turned out nicely. I used the glaze over the salmon and broiled it. Served it with a "relish" of diced strawberries & avocado with basil, olive oil & balsamic vinegar (s&p to season). Kids loved it!

With all due respect to the many good cooks who have rated this dish very favorably, we found it to be a huge disappointment. Everyone in my family likes salmon -- and they especially look forward to nights when I try something new (no 'picky' eaters here!) So I had high hopes that this would be a real hit. Well, NOT! Everyone agreed that the salmon was so-so. It was the glaze drizzled on top (without benefit of grilling) that really turned everybody off. The kid who loves *anything* with soy sauce in it pronounced it "nasty". Bottom line... It's wonderfully quick and easy, so it's probably worth a shot, given all the raves. You may well be in the majority. But I'd sure recommend that you do a trial run before serving to company!!!

I would also say mine came out uncooked after the specified cooking time and required more cooking. I prefer my easy recipe of misting the salmon with olive oil with a sprinkiling of dill to be baked in the oven. Simple and delicious.

Extra chinese mustard made this really a standout. And I'm not a salmon fan. Used filets instead of steaks, and would do this again in a minute.

Very nice. I used coarse grain mustard (out of dijon and didn't have Chinese-style) and mixed with some dry Coleman's, also used light brown sugar. Very, very simple to put together. I was afraid the sugar would burn on the grill, but it glazed perfectly. Served it with Asian Noodles from this sight(using up left over cooked spaghetti!) It was a beautiful and easy presentation.

Rating: 3
I've never seen so many 3 and 4 fork reviews for one recipe; one more can't hurt. Although I'm a big fan of Dijon mustard, this time I used Coleman's mustard powder mixed with an equal amount of water to make what I assume is Chinese-style mustard. I'd continue to do so for this recipe. I used light brown sugar, which may be a good idea for those who thought the glaze a little on the sweet side. Also used fillets rather than steaks, and broiled them indoors rather than the outdoor grill. As my salmon fillet was very thick, I finished cooking it at a high oven temperature after the initial broiling. Do make extra glaze because the small amount, 1 tablespoon, set aside for drizzling probably won't be enough for most folks.

This is a favorite at our house. Easy and absolutely delicious.

We tried this last night with tilapia, and it was amazing! I also substituted honey dijon instead of regular--don't be fooled by the slightly bitter taste of the marinade...once you grill it, it becomes sweet and delicious. We'll definitely be using this one again.

This was ok, but I was hoping for so much more considering the amount of Chinese-style hot mustard. More zip, perhaps a wasabi might do it. I also found that the glaze stuck to the grill I was using, perhaps my fault. If I make it again I'll try some stronger mustard and spray the grill surface with oil prior to placing the glazed salmon on it.

The glaze was fantastic; sweet, but not cloying. This recipe couldn't be easier to make. I used fillets instead of steaks (no bones, less "fishy") and made one and a half times the amount of sauce. I think that's a must. Served this with Potatoes Roasted with Rosemary and Sea Salt, and a Caesar salad. A definite repeat.

This is now one of my favorite grilled salmon recipes. I like to add plenty of sauce while the salmon is cooking to get a rich smokey taste from the grilling -- I don't like the sauce over the fish once it is done cooking because it is too sweet -- the smokey taste from the grill seems to cut the sugar and bring out the mustard flavor more. We love it.

Rating: 3
My guests raved over this recipe! I used salmon filets (not steaks) and grilled on a tabletop grill for three minutes. We did not feel it was too sweet but I didn't top the salmon with glaze after grilling as suggested. I served it with the Wild Rice and Toasted Pecan Pilaf... outstanding!

Rating: 1
I was very disappointed in this recipe. If you like a tangy salmon you will NOT like this dish -- far too sweet. I cut the sugar in half and I loved the taste of the marinade itself, but on the fish it was a disaster, too cloyingly sweet with no zip or "bite" to tame the salmon. This marinade might be better suited to chicken for me....

This recipe has been around a long time. Is it going through a revival or has it been on the MPL continously since 1996? I found the glaze definitely dominated the salmon, but it still was quite good. If the salmon is fresh, I wouldn't use this recipe. If it comes from the freezer, as ours did, it does just fine. Will have to try the basalmic glaze 7/01, or the ginger-honey glaze mentioned by another cook below.

Rating: 4
So easy and so good! I wish that I had found this recipe years ago. I used apple chips on the bbq and dijon mustard in the glaze. I bet it would be awesome if you used alder chips on the bbq. The only regret was not having more fish so we could have seconds (we had 7 oz. fillets each). Be sure to put plenty of glaze on the fish before serving it since it's soooo good. I am going home to visit relatives this week and plan on making this salmon for our families. I think they will love it, too. All recipes should be so simple and tasty!

I have to swim against the current of opinion here; I made this as written with the exception of using half dijon/half chinese hot mustard.

I've made this recipe twice and loved it both times. I think it came out better with filets than the steaks. On both occasions, guests and my husband loved it.

Will try the pineapple suggestion for dessert next time!

My family asks me to make this dish so often that I know the recipe by heart. The secret is fresh, high-quality salmon. I buy a thick filet (not steaks) and have the fishmonger remove the skin. Grill over medium-hot fire. Place the cooked filet on a warmed platter and just drizzle the vinegar sauce on and around it. The outside is crispy and the center is tender-sweet. This is the dish that convinced my kids that fresh fish can actually be yummy!

I made this last night for Easter dinner and it came out so-so. I'm not sure if it was because I used a combination of Dijon and Chinese mustard but I've tried other salmon recipes on this site that I like much better.

This was not a bad tasting dish, but I thought it would be more for people who don't like salmon or fish. It totally obliterated the fresh taste of the salmon (I am a salmon lover, so I don't mind the taste of it)and sort of ruined the dish for me. I can see how it would definitely appeal to those who find salmon's taste objectionable and the color was beautiful.

Still a winner! This is so easy but makes a lovely presentation. I actually marinate salmon filets in the mixture - including the vinegar - for about 2 hours, then broil in the oven - about 4 inches from the heat source for 12 minutes (you don't have to flip them over, either.) The glaze takes on a wonderful shine and color as it cooks. Drizzle a little additional mixture over the filet just before serving. Serve with lemon wedges, wild rice and baby peas in butter and parmesan and you've got a quick and easy meal that looks and tastes great!

I thought the glaze was too sweet, but the fish itself was wonderful-- flaky and grilled absolutely perfectly. I used salmon fillets, grilled skin side up first, then peeled the skin off (easy!), added more glaze and flipped over. I also used half hot Chinese and half Dijon mustard. We love salmon, but this glaze seemed to overpower the fish. I would make it again only if I altered some of the ingredients in the glaze. Disappointing.

Just excellent! My friend asked me for a new idea for salmon. Once I read all the comments, I figured this was a safe bet.

This was very good, simple and tasty. (No choppping!) I used a fillet of salmon too and I left the skin on and marinated it for 2 hrs. (using just the glaze, not the part with the vinegar) in the fridge. Then we grilled it skin side down first and then flipped it and drizzled more of the glaze on and cooked it until done. The skin came off easily and it was delish! We drizzled the rest of the glaze over it and even my son ate it! I used just 1 tsp. of the chinese mustard and the rest Dijon. I didn't think it was too sweet either. Definitely making this again!

This was a wonderful recipe. Up here in the Pacific Northwest we are always looking for new salmon recipies. This one was a winner. I've been saving my Copper River Salmon for something special & I'm glad I did! I brushed the glaze over the salmon & let it marinate for a couple hours prior to grilling. I also cut a ripe pineapple & brushed the glaze on that as well. THis was a birthday barbeque so I also had grilled lemon/soy marinated chicken thighs & my guests was even drizzling the marinade over the chicken as well. Served with a vegetable salad & grilled corn on the cob, this was very hard to beat. Will definitely be making this again

Having said that, I used the oven grill, substituted fillets for steaks, and used a little less sugar as a previous reviewer thought the recipe was a bit sweet.

I too added ginger to the glaze and loved it. I used my over-top grill pan and sprayed it with cooking spray. I would double the sauce though, I used it all and could of used some more.

Used this marinade on fresh salmon fillets my husband just brought home from Alaska. Easy and delicious! I did add 1 t. groung ginger and cooked on grill 5 mins. a side as were 3/4" thick. This a summer keeper! Another great recipe is salmon and brown sugar and mustard glaze from WEBER'S ART OF THE GRILL!!

This is very easy and yummy. It really doesn't need the long marination, I don't think, because it was very good with reserved sauce brushed on after cooking.(I saved some before marinating.)Definitely one of my favorite easy summer recipes.

I bought filets instead of steaks because I was not reading carefully. So, I used the sauce anyway and it was delicious. My friend who is not a fish eater dropped by and loved fish for the first time.

Darn! I wish I loved this as much as everyone else did. We used an indoor grill, and I suspect that made the difference. It is difficult to get the char/sugar caramelization on an indoor grill without overcooking the fish. So my salmon was both overcooked and not crisp on the outside. Will try it again on the outdoor grill, but am not just itching to do it soon.

Excellent! The combination of the sugar, mustard , and soy sauce was great. It tasted very good.

This was a delicious recipe! I too marinated the fish (about 1.5 hours) and ended up baking it instead of grilling which worked fine. Very tasty and I definitely recommend drizzling remaining sauce over the finished product right before serving. Absolutely scrumptious.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I also allowed the salmon to marinate for a bit (about 30 min)before grilling it. I only had a little bit of the hot Chinese mustard, but the dijon worked just fine. I will definitely make this again.

Very excellent salmon recipe! I took other reviewers advice and I marinated it for 3 hours in the sauce before grilling.

This is a simple, yet very delicious way to make salmon. I've also used it with salmon fillets and just cooked them skin-side down without flipping. My kids love this, too!

I used 3 tsp Dijon mustard and 1/2 tsp Chinese mustard and the sweet/tart taste wasn't as strong We give it 3 forks and we would prepare it again. We both agree that the glaze would be very good with chicken.

Best grilled salmon I have tried yet. I marinated the steaks in the sauce in frig. for about 2 hours first. Then followed recipe exactly. Delicious !!!

The best glaze I've ever used on salmon. I suggest brushing glaze on salmon steaks a couple hours before grilling. All the dinner guests were so pleased with the taste. I will make this again soon.

Great recipe - quick and easy, and even my husband, who doesn't care for most fish, asked me to make it again soon. I used fresh frozen salmon steaks, and they worked just fine. The kids especially liked the glaze.

I'm not always crazy about salmon but I loved this one. I posted it on Gail's Recipe Swap. Someone recently tried it and said it was "To Die For." I love it with "Roasted Potato Slices with Lime and Chili" (good with most fish). I'll have to check to see if that easy one is also online and give it the four forks it deserves.

everyone really enjoyed this recipe. i used it on salmon steaks, marinated it and grilled it. since i doubled this recipe, next time, i will cut down on the brown sugar; it was too sweet.

This is absolutely wonderful. It's a great summer dish, but I love to pull a couple of salmon steaks out of the freezer in the dead of winter and grill them with this glaze under the broiler. What a treat!

I was a little disappointed with the results of this recipe. I did add some ginger to the glaze but think it could have used some honey in it to make the glaze work better. I also used a fillet instead of salmon steak.

I will Make this dish today with the ginger so right now don't know but I think it will be tasty. Great Idea from Montreal about the untreated shingle. I also use unglazed clay tiles for my pizza stone which I like better cause you can store them in a pile. (and 1/10th the cost)

Charcoal gives this the ultimate flavor; other type grills don't do it justice. FABULOUS.

add the ginger and try using filet with skin. Place on a water soaked piece of untreated cedar (I use a shake shingle). Place salmon skin side down on cedaer and place over heated grill. close cover and bake - baste a few times. cook to your preference.

This was wonderful and, as everyone has noted, so easy to prepare. I will definitely make this again. I think adding ginger, as someone previously suggested, would work very well with this recipe and I will also try the searing suggestion offered by "A Cook from Honolulu".

My husband (not a cook) prepared this for me several nights ago using skinned salmon fillets cut from the thick end. It was fantastic and couldn't be easier to do. We will have it again, and soon. I agree with those who advise doubling the sauce/glaze recipe. Another incredible salmon preparation is the Honey Ginger Salmon at this site. The two recipes result in very different flavors, both of which are delightful!

I could not believe how FAST this was to make!!! I plan to make this for my inlaws over Labor Day; very yummy and impressive, despite only 5 ingredients!!! I used the fillets, we will use steaks next time for ease of grilling. Also, when I tasted the glaze "raw" you could taste the heat of the mustard, so I didn't use all the mustard the recipe calls for (full strength). But I would add the full mustard b/c it's not as strong with the vinegar added or after cooking. Also, definitely double the sauce, and save more of it for serving rather than basting. Overall, a definite keeper! I also added a little ginger, and I served it over rice and steamed broccoli. (The rice took longer than the salmon to make!!)

Fabulous! For an East-Meets-West kind of twist, try just searing the salmon on the grill really quickly, leaving the inside raw. My family preferred it that way.

Absolutely delicious! My guests & I couldn't stop raving about it. I will definately make this again. I'll also try a bit of ginger as someone else suggested. This is now my #2 favorite salmon recipe. #1 is the Pacific salmon with roasted garlic on this website. It is still the winner!!

This was a great tasting, easy preparation for salmon. I used a filet instead of steak and it worked out fine. I served it with roasted new potatoes and a BA July '99 recipe - Green Beans, Toasted Pecans, & Blue Cheese. A truly great dinner.

Delicious! Very fast and easy to make and impressive appearance for guests. Serving the sauce on the side might be better for those that don't like the little bit of heat from the Chinese mustard. I was going to try a salmon fillet but was glad I followed the recipe using the steak. It holds up better on the grill. I will make this again very soon!

This was primo with the Garlic-White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes. I omitted the Chipotle sauce from the mashed potatoes and added 3/4 tsp. of crushed dried red peppers to the glaze instead. Fabulous! Got raves all around.

I have made this recipe many times since discovering it here at Epicurious. It's a hit time and time again with our varied dinner companions. Sometimes I substitute a Caribbean Hot Mustard for the Chinese Hot Mustard. Doubling the sauce helps. Anyone who loves Salmon should try this one!

We love this and make it often. I use a filet and remove the skin when we turn the fish...then glaze that side.

This recipe is easy and delicious! I quadrupled the recipe for a large half salmon. I basted the inside of the fish, then wrpped in foil and placed on the grill. I also reserved about 6 tablespoons of the marinade to use on the cooked fish. I will definetly make this again!

Maybe it's simply a matter of preference or taste, but I thought that this dish was WAY too sweet to be enjoyable. But it was visually appealing and seemed to come out an acceptable manner, I just didn't like the way it tasted at all. I'll save the sweets for desert.

My husband raved when I served this for dinner. The glaze imparts a wonderful flavor to the salmon and it's easy to prepare. Just remember to cover the grill while the fish cooks so it will cook as quickly as the recipe indicates.
