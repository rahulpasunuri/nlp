This is my favorite recipe when fresh morels are available. Just brush them VERY carefully to retain the flavor. Serve with the BEST white Burgundy that you can afford.

I served this at a dinner party to rave reviews. I made a second batch the nex day and froze the butter is small containters. Try it with Beef Tenderloin - it's even better.

What a wonderful idea to combine seafood and mushrooms! My guests and I were delighted and I am looking forward to making that dish again!

You can get the same effect by using plain butter seasoned with salt and pepper, spreading all of the morels around and over the prawns, saving yourself the trouble of making the special butter. In my opinion, there are many more interesting things to do with morels.

This is a wonderful recipe! We unfortunately do not have morels growing in our yard (lucky you that does!!)and my local grocery store had all mushrooms BUT morels. I stumbled across using lobster mushrooms and it was the best "grudgingly substitute" experience I have ever had! The (dried) lobster mushrooms, once reconstituted, turned a beautful reddish color and really look just like lobster (now appearing like a seafood stew), subsequently resulting in a delightful red au jus to add to the dish (after straining of course!). I served it next to some baby field greens. Ah bliss, welcome spring....

I made this dish with the fresh Morels I picked from my backyard. It was a delicious meal, I made enough for my Parents also. We will make this again. But, We LOVE Morels anyway, plus, Put them with Prawns, WOW!!!

Very good & easy to prepare. Would like to try it with a different mushroom.
