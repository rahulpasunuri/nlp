Very good dish and pretty easy to make. I did add a bit more cheese, garlic, and crushed red pepper.

Just pushed myself away from the table.....very good recipe. It is not as heavy and fattening as i expected with all the cream. We used a full pound of penne pasta and it worked out just fine. This was a great work week "all in one" dinner. Kids loved it, mom and dad loved it. The only reason it doesn't get 4 forks is that it is not a gourmet recipe. If the scale is rating only work week dinners, this gets 4 forks easy. Go ahead and give it a shot! This is going into the regular rotation for us.

This was just OK. On the bland side.

I'm not a fan of peppers so I omitted the red bell pepper and it turned out great! I used a little less chicken and used up all the heavy cream in the container so it was more like 2 cups- so I tossed in a little extra cheese. Excellent weeknight meal and the fresh broccoli was excellent.

Rating: 1
A pot to cook the pasta, a pot & lid to cook the broccoli, a Dutch oven for the chicken & bell pepper, a colander to drain the pasta, and a baking dish -- that many dishes for a mediocre fattening result? I won't be making this one again.

Very, very good. Sprinkled three whole skinless boneless chicken breasts w/ ground pepper and oregano then sauteed in grapeseed oil until almost done and sliced approx 1/4" thick. No bell pepper, so made the remainder of the recipe per many of the other reviews. One carrot cut on the diagonal, 1 TBSP of garlic, 3/4 lb cremini mushrooms, 1 c sweet potato (cut thin and sliced 1.5" long x.5" wide), 3 TBSP julienned sun-dried tomatoes sauteed in grapeseed. Deglazed w/ sherry. Added 1 c of cream and 2/3 c of skim milk w/ 1 c of grated parm cheese. Added chicken and let finish cooking. Added broccoli and whole grain spaghetti with tsp or so of pepper and salted to taste. Absolutely wonderful.

I do not have a Dutch oven, so I just used a saucepan, which seared the peppers a bit. In the future, I'll use a little more Parmesan for topping, but there will be, indeed, a future. Delicious.

Great recipe that was a big hit with the family. Kids really loved it. I would add more cream next time around as well as a little garlic. Does make a lot of food, but heats up nicely if you don't over do it.

Quick recipe and pretty simple. My boyfriend begs me to make this and raves about it every time. Only changes I have made are to use roasted red peppers from a jar and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper. Have also substituted the jack with mozzarella and worked great. Good base recipe.

Rating: 4
what a great recipe this is..i tailored it to fit by using a package of alfredo sauce (cream, milk, butter & sauce mix) and instead of using the bell pepper i used sun-dried tomatoes along with a bag of chopped frozen broccoli - those steamers for the microwave are fantastic! Overall the recipe was quick and easy and just as good as the local italian bistro across town. I will definitely make this one again!

This was a solid dinner and beware, it makes a ton of food! The only changes I would make would be to add a bit more cream (or not cook down the sauce so much) because it was a smidge dry for our tastes. I'd also double the bell pepper (or add sun-dried tomatoes) and add a sprinkling of pine nuts and crumbled goat cheese over the top. It could be a 4 star recipe with that spike of sharpness. By the way, this is the only method to get my husband and two toddlers to eat broccoli!

This recipe is very flavorful. I sauteed crimini mushrooms while sautéing the bell pepper. The only thing I would change next time is adding a little less pasta.

Rating: 4
Incredible! I did add cremini mushrooms and tomato pesto to the sauce. So good! Next time I will use fresh Parmesan instead of the stuff in the shaker - perhaps mine won't turn out as gritty then. But when I reheated it, the grittiness went away? I will also use some sun dried tomatoes. Try this recipe you won't regret it!

Excellent. I, of course, added 2 small cloves of garlic. I can't imagine any dish, save a few desserts and breakfasts, without garlic. I did not use the broiler just mixed all the ingredients in the dutch oven to warm it all up. Fantastic result. Very easy! This recipe will easily feed six.

This recipe was very good....easy to follow...I used linguini cut in half...added mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlics to the saute mixture...our teenage daughter used this and made it for us for dinner....one of the first dishes she has ever made outside of grilled cheese...she did a great job....our 5 year old loved it too...the only thing is I would probably do the grilling of the chicken and also cut it up in chunks...as the strips even thinly cut seemed a little too big at the end and the oil can spit if the temperature isn't quite right....great dish.

Rating: 3
Instead of the florets I used the whole head of broccoli. The next time I would sauté some garlic and maybe a shallot in with the red pepper. I don't think the baking at the end was necessary. Next time I would just server after mixing and have parmasean on the side to sprinkle. I also added some hot red pepper flakes for added heat, and used linguine instead of penne. It was rather tasty!! It reminded me of a thick primavera sauce.

Rating: 4
Hi! i modified this one a bit- instead i made a cassarole penne bake. I made chicken separate on a forman grill. made the alfredo sauce separately starting with leeks, garlic and habenero pepper-saute, then white wine. then added the alfredo ingredients to thicken sauce. added dried wild mushrooms to alfredo. then poured over whole wheat penne in casserole dish. then added cut up grilled chicken and raw broccolli. topped with whole wheat breadcrumbs and more cheese to top. yikes!! and yum

Made this for a pasta party where there were lots of different pasta sauces. This one was a hit and I had many people asking for the recipe. I added a clove of garlic (maybe even more next time) and put it over fettuccine. It wasn't watery at all but ilt did sit for a while before it was served.

Rating: 1
Way too watery: a waste of 1 2/3 of cream. Just didn't do it for me. And how is this healthy? I mean, that's not why I made it, but after seeing the "high fiber" icon I just wondered....

Amazingly easy to prepare and great! I added sundried tomatoes into the sauce before adding it to the pasta and chicken. The tomatoes made this dish unforgettable!

THANK YOU NEW MEXOCO! The wilted spinach and pine nuts took this recipe to the moon and back. Absolutely delicous....my only caveat to readers is...make sure you follow the sauce recipe exactly.

Rating: 2
I was so excited to make this for my family and made the changes suggested by previous reviewers (use half and half instead of whipping cream, double the sauce ingredients) and it was not good. It was way too parmigean-y (spelling?) and had a gritty texture. It was also much too rich, even for my taste. To me it was on the verge of inedible, however I must say that my husband thought it was good. My suggestion: DON'T ALTER THE RECIPE. I feel bad writing a bad review because it probably turned out the way it did because of the changes I made... Next time I will try a more traditional butter and cream based sauce.

Rating: 4
This dish will feed 4 people.... FOR A WEEK!!! I didn't make the casserole, just the pasta, but had a huge bowl of it that was easily 10 - 12 large servings. I doubled the cream and put in 8 oz of jack to make it a bit saucier and creamier and it was perfect. Also added some nutmeg to the sauce which was a nice flavor. Added garlic and mushrooms to the sauce. I think wilted spinach and roasted pine nuts in the sauce would be amazing. Also, I had to cook the sauce for about 18 minutes to get it to the right consistency for alfredo. If you don't cook it long enough, the sauce is stringy and runny. Boiling it down for a few minutes definitely helped. This was super easy and really delicious. Everyone at the table (including my 2 year old twins) loved it.

Rating: 3
I didn't make this as a casserole, just over pasta. I added sun-dried tomatoes to the red peppers, and garlic to the alfredo sauce. I also fooled around with the alfredo to make it less fatty--doubled the cheese and cream, but used half/half and milk, with just a bit of heavy cream. It barely made enough sauce, but I find that's often the case with recipes on this site (not that I'm complaining--I love this site). It was good, but it wasn't great, at least to me. I much prefer the chicken with sun-dried tomatoes in a tomato cream sauce from this site, but I was looking for something different. I also didn't think it was such a snap to put together, as I had to use not only the big pot for the pasta, but two skillets as well, one for the chicken and one for the vegetables. That make clean-up a bit too much for my liking. Overall, I thought this was good, and I'll make it again. Alfredo is just too good not to make every now and then, but it's good to get some vegetables with it.

Rating: 3
I never made an alfredo sauce before, and don't even know what a Dutch oven is, but this came out pretty good. I liked the quick prep time, tossing in shrimp and tofu instead of chicken, and diced a tomato instead of the peppers. I'll do it again if I can get my kid to eat it.

I loved this dish. I accidentally put too much whipping cream, so it came out a bit thinner than I liked. Next time though I will put more cheeses, and a little less whipping cream. Make sure you cut the chicken pretty thin. I added mushrooms to this dish as well, complemented perfectly. Overall, delicious!

After reading the reviews posted here, I would have to agree - add the garlic and oregano, it definately makes this dish stand out.

Rating: 4
This was DELICIOUS and far from bland, the way that I made it. It was easy, but I would dispute the "quick" from some reviewers. I divided the amount of broccoli and pasta in half to serve 2. For my 1/2 recipe I used I small red bell pepper. Using reviewers' suggestions I added 2 garlic cloves, 3 sliced fresh mushrooms, and increased the cheese to 2 oz. (by weight) of "by hand" shredded Pepper Jack cheese (instead of "grated" Monterey Jack). Didn't have whipping cream, so I subbed 1 cup of half-and-half. It was awfully thick before I turned it into the baking dish, so I added a generous splash of milk. It was very filling and my 2 servings yielded 4 servings. I wonder if my recipe turned out too filling because I used canned grated Parmesan. Could they have meant "by hand shredded" Parmesan, which would mean that I used about 2 times too much Parmesan?? Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. It was GOOD!!!

4 forks for ease, taste, versatility, and time. its quick and simple and open to any modification. i cant believe all of the "bland" comments-- add a little garlic or more cheese, maybe mushrooms instead of peppers, and the taste will be great. this is the first recipe i tried from epicurious and i am still making it and getting rave reviews.

This turned out much lighter tasting than i expected from an alfredo recipe. Next time i would leave out the red pepper- i didnt think it added much to the flavor.

This was my first time attempting alfredo and I was delightfully surprised. It took at while to get the cream and cheese to a simmer so I was getting a little nervous as to whether or not it would thicken but eventually it did. This recipe seems like a very basic alfredo recipe to start adding my own touches. I think some asparagus heads and mushrooms would be a delicious spin.

This was a good family dinner; the kids liked it too. I did add mushrooms to it, which were very good but gave it a very mushroomy flavor, which I think affects my ability to accurately review the actual recipe. I don't think the mushrooms would be necessary anyway. This makes a huge amount - it would serve 6 very generously.

Rating: 4
I made this for two seperate dinner parties and both times it was a big time hit. I did change it around a little by adding garlic, deleting the broccoli and adding white cooking wine. For those of you who are alfredo lovers, the MJ cheese adds a much welcomed zip to the "same-ol-same-ol," but be careful not to add too much. The red peppers end up being incredibly sweet, and for more color you can add a yellow pepper. One more tip for the busy cook ... buy the pre-cooked cajun or italian packets of grilled chicken strips. It's quick and everyone loves it!!! One of my guests asked me if this was a family recipie--it is now! I will make this again and again.

DELICIOUS! This recipe is a good base for a pasta dish, but I jazzed it up quite a bit: I sauteed the chicken with LOTS of fresh garlic bits, and then I added chopped fresh mushrooms when I sauteed the red peppers. I made extra sauce, and added some sherry and crushed red pepper to it, which really enhanced the flavors. I skipped broiling the dish, but mixed all the veggies, pasta, and sauce together and served it in a big pasta bowl. My whole family loved it. Served with a crusty bread and a salad, it is the perfect dinner (it's easy, too!)

I actually made this WITHOUT the chicken -- just upped the amount of veggies -- and it turned out great. It definitely needs garlic and mushrooms for flavor.

This dish was disappointing, mainly because of the sauce. I did add garlic and mushrooms, which helped in the flavor department. But, the sauce ended up very thin as the cheese clumped. For some reason the jack, parmesan, and heavy cream did not blend very well. If I make it again, I will reduce the cream and add the cheese at the very end.
