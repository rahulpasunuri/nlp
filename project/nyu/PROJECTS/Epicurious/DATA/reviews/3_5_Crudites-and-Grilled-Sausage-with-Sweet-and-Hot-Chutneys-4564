I have made this recipe since it first appeared (for my Dad's b-day party in January). It has always continued to get raves from everyone. The sweet chutney is easier to prepare, but the hot is also worth the effort. You can cook the sausages in the oven on about 375 and they are nearly as good as grilled.

The chutney recipes were good. I would make those and try other combinations, use them as sauces, perhaps. I didn't like the flavor as a dip for vegetables, but the sausages were good with it.
