Tried this for the first time last night and it was a hit. I did substitute 1 plus cup Italian bread crumbs instead and in my hurry I forgot to add the garlic, but that was my issue, and everyone still that it was really good. I'm sure the next time I make it with the garlic it can only be better. This is a very large meatloaf so for a small family you might want to think of halving this recipe, otherwise you will be eating left overs for days.

This was good but not fantastic because it needs more seasonings. I used extra oregano and added fennell and extra cheese. It was very moist. It took nearly 2.5 hours to cook in a 375 oven.

This was surprisingly good. I made 1/3 of the recipe and only cooked it 1 hour, it was cooked through but moist (165F). I used fresh basil instead of the parsley and just topped it with a can of pelatis in juice but otherwise followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing! My 10 month old loved it too.

This is an incredibly moist meat loaf. Would have appreciated a guideline on how much salt to add, though. Will need to experiment with that. Otherwise, the recipe is perfect.

This was not bad and I am not a meatloaf lover. I will make it again, because my picky eaters (kids) ate it.

I tried this recipe last night and it was a success with my family. I had a question about what size can of tomatoes to buy and chose the larger one but sized it to the smaller one. If the recipe holder could clarify, I'd appreciate it.

I tried this dish for the first time when my friend made it. I was surprised because I have never had such a superb meat loaf. Of course, I started making this for my own family, and meat loaf is now bumped up from a boring filler up dish when you have run out of ideas on what to cook to a treat.

Have made this a number of times with a few modifications that make it a big hit. First, I do away with the bread and add 1+ cup of Italian bread crumbs instead. I also don't use parsley or oregano and instead use a lot of fresh basil. I add some chopped prosciutto to give the loaf some saltiness and flavor, and increase the cheese. I put some of the tomato paste, celery, and carrots right in the loaf, and use a larger can of tomatoes to put around the loaf with the veggies (onions and basil added). We serve the meatloaf with pasta, as there is a good amount of sauce to pour over. Delicious. Might also try blending the tomatoes and veggies after it comes out of the oven for a smoother pasta sauce.

I have never made meat loaf in my life and last weekend I dared try this recipe. It was a success and so delicious that the family specially requested it for a return engagement this week. Thanks to whoever graciously shared this recipr!

I was a little disappointed with this. My meatloaf came out kinda bland, just not a lot of flavor. I had to use dried parsley instead of fresh and spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes and paste. I even used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. There was also quite a bit more liquid at the bottom of the pan by the time it was done. Overall, it was okay.

Excellent. Makes a very large loaf. Leftover ideas: meatloaf sandwiches, filling for stuffed peppers, meat mixture for marinara pasta sauce

This has become a regular meal at our place. I'm not usually that keen on meatloaf but this is great. I make two loaves and cover them both with a sprinkling of chopped bacon, tenting the baking tray to keep in moisture. Once the loaves are removed, all the remaining ingredients can be blended (I use a hand blender) into a delicious, rich sauce. Roast potatoes and cauliflower- cheese with a dash of Thai chili sauce completes a great meal for all ages.

Very impressed with this recipe. Simple and easy to create. Although the meatloaf itself was moist and tasty, the sauce is the important note with this dish. The juices, tomatoes and vegetables were merely blended together to provide the pefect accompaniment to the meat. Roasted potatoes and a rich cauliflower- cheese completed the meal nicely. This one stays in my repertiore.

This recipe for Italian Meatloaf is the basic recipe a dear friend gave to me and I lost. The only variation to it was Parm/Regg cheese instead of peco/Romano. However, I love the Romano in this recipe... I put this one straight into my "Recipe Box", and printed a paper copy. Thank-You, and hopefully I'll be able to hang onto this one. It is a true "Classic".

I made this for the first time last night. It was the perfect entree for an unexpected snowy night in October. As others have noted, it provides delicious leftovers. While it has nothing to do with the recipe, loreen3, what's with the snarky comment? There is no need to be rude to your fellow posters.

Very nice. The mix seemed a bit dry prior to baking, so I did add some steak sauce. Used the filling to stuff portabella mushrooms, and the match was perfection.

I make this meatloaf frequently. It's very tasty. It does make a lot.

Excellent, flavorful meal. I used about a cup of bread crumbs instead of bread, parmesan instead of romano, juice in can from tomatoes instead of water, and added baby bellas right to the cooking sauce at the beginning. It's important that all of the carrots and celery are in the liquid and not on the surface of the loaf so that they braise. I added crumbled leftovers to marinara sauce, which also tasted great over rigatoni.

Super simple and really good. The family liked it.

Beat meatloaf recipe I have ever tried - even if you don't like meatloaf!!! It is simple to make, moist, and flavorful. One serving suggestion - take leftovers and cube - add to a simple marinara sauce and simmer for an hour or more. The flavors from the meatloaf blend into the sauce and make a wonderful spaghetti sauce.

Very tasty. I ate every morsel and almost liked the plate-- which is a definite lack of class but the greatest sign of delectability.

This was a fabulous meatloaf. I made two loaves rather than one huge and one fed 5. The sauce seemed uninteresting so we concocted one using crushed tomatoes, marinara, wine and beef base..excellent. Next time will reduce the oregano by half just to see..not objectionable as it was.

I made it for a small party and it was very well received. Half the guests had second or third servings. It makes a lot. I thought the instructions for figuring when the loaf was finished cooking were too vague, so I used a meat thermometer and cooked the loaf until the center reached 170°F.

The basic ingredients were delicious but I made a few changes because I didn't have time for the veggies. I added some of the tomatoes to the meatloaf, used 1 3/4 lb. veal, pork and beef and added 1 1/4 lb. ground turkey thighs (made the loaf a little lighter and healthier)and 1 extra egg and added only half the milk after the bread soaked. Made them into 2 loaves so they would cook faster. I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce to the diced tomatoes instead of the water and baked it at 400 for 1 hour. It was so delicious, we had the second one the next night for dinner (which I never do!)

Never made meatloaf until this one. It was better than any meatloaf my mother ever made. I went with adding bacon, some mushrooms,extra oregano and fresh basil,all of which enhanced the flavours. I'm making another meatloaf as I write this... great stuff!

I've never made meatloaf before and have eaten it maybe once in my life and don't remember much of that one but I found this really really good- even my stepson said he never thought he'd like meat loaf and he loved it going back for seconds. Odd though my little pieces of carrot were still a little hard and instead of 8oz of tomatoes I used a 28oz can and was glad I did- it gave us lots of sopping sauce. I think next time I'll use mushrooms also in the sauce and cilantro instead of parsley for an even better flavor, but an excellent receipe and this recipe was enough along with mashed potatoes and spinach, to feed 3 big eaters and 2 reg. eaters with a little bit of leftover that got gobbled up the next day. Will definitely keep this recipe as my meatloaf base and take it from there

I'm not a big meatloaf fan, but was looking for some easy recipes to suite our hectic schedule and this sounded good. Made a few changes: added 1 TB of fresh oregano, plus same of fresh basil. Also added crushed tomatoes and paste into meatloaf, as well as topped meatloaf with same mixture. Yum!
