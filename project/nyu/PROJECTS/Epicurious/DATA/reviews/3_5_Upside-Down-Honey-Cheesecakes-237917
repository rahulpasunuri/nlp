It is very good,very creamy,I do not like the crust in the cheesecake so this caramel gives the perfect touch to it.It was a success,everybody love it.

I made this recipe awhile ago and absolutely loved it! I didn't have problems with getting it out of the pan, and the cheesecake, not as sweet as the average cheesecake, went really well with the honey topping. The cheesecake needed something sweet, while the honey topping needed something rich to go with it--pretty much a match made in heaven!

I LOVE this recipe. I made it April 2007 for an Easter Brunch and everyone RAVED, and I've made it numerous times since, I've never had a problem with the unmolding, the honey-caramel is sweet (duh) but it's perfect with the cheesecake and fruit and a lovely espresso. I'm celiac and there are very few caramel-ly desserts that I can enjoy - and this is my favorite...

The cheesecakes were very good. But could not unmold them, the sugar honey was way to hard and too sweet. would do it again but with regular caramel

I made this for for a party of 25. Everyone absolutely loved it. The earthy sweetness of the honey mixes well with the brown sugar in the cheesecake. I did bake them a little longer than directed as I made them larger than in the recipe. All in all, an execellent summer dessert. Light in taste, although definitely NOT light in calories!!!!

yummylicious! This cheesecake is creamier than the usual kinds but tastes just as good. i think i accidentally used flavored honey so it might have brought additonal taste. one of the recipes from bon appetit that i actually like

As a cheesecake fan, I thought these were great. Very simple and delicious. I had frozen mixed berries that I thawed and served with the cheesecake as well. Yummy!!

as a huge cheesecake fan, I thought this came out dry and not very tasty. ASs for the honey carmel, to me tasted more like burned suger. I've made alot from this site but this is one I will not be making again.

Love at first bite; it was perfect because it was not overly sweet like most cheesecakes. I thought the sweetness of the honey was just right. I made a strawberry glaze with mashed fresh strawberries, sugar, water, and cornstarch that I put on top (from a cooks.com recipe). Then I sliced some strawberries and put them on top of the glaze. It was a great hit at the party I went to and not a bite was left!

Made this for guests and everyone loved it. I've never made cheesecake before and it was really simple.

the honey sauce was way to strong for this dessert, have made alot of things from Bon Appetit and can't say that this is a favorite.
