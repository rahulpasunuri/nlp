Good basis for a cacciatore recipe. If you're an IA, then you grew up with this. Some of us never saw peppers in cacciatore, depending on from which region your grandparents or parents hailed. Certainly mushrooms, not mentioned here, would be treated similarly, as well as pepper flakes. I'm not sure who it was at Gourmet that thought "buttered noodles" was a good idea for an accompaniment, but it's not. Totally throws off the flavor profile--no beef stew this. Chicken cacciatore and steak pizzaiola were the only meals I can recall where rice was served routinely. The sauce here, though, is so hearty and worthy of pasta that leftovers will be served with rotini or fusilli. Personally I never use green peppers, so 1 red and 1 yellow makes a sweet upgrade. Mangiare asai!

Excellent as written. Agree with previous reviewer about the quality of wine. Good wine, good sauce, bad wine, not so great sauce. Also great with mushrooms and shredded zucchini if you're trying to bump up the vegetable quotient of your meal.

Thought the basic recipe was good and easy, But I added some things, sort of a combination of items that were in other recipes but not in this. I doubled the garlic, sauteed with the onion etc, 3 strips of uncooked bacon cut into strips and chopped carrot and jalapeno pepper to add the zing I was looking for.Turned out fabulous!

This was a fast and easy recipe. I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey breast, and added drained canned artichokes. It took only about 1/2 hr to prepare, and I served it over linguine. My family loved it and it was a really low- cal, easy way to use turkey leftovers. YUMMY!

This is a really good basic recipe. All it is missing is the seasoning. Once I add in the basil, marjoram, bay leaf, oregano, etc., it becomes one of our favorite dishes. I served it with penne and bread or salad. Yum!

Used cut up boneless chicken breasts, red pepper instead of green and added oregano, basil, thyme, balsalmic vinegar, capers and some crushed red pepper as others suggested. Overall was just ok, nothing special and still a bit bland.

Good recipe and my family liked it. It will be added to my repertoire of recipes I cook for the family. I looked at the other chicken cacciatore recipes on Epicurious and tweaked it a bit. I used a 28-oz can of diced tomatoes in juice. I also added 1 tsp. of oregano and fennel. Next time, I am going to add mushrooms and add 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it more zing!

Very good recipe- like everyone says! I used just 4 thighs...but can imagine all chicken parts and sausage or meatballs added in. I did boil the sauce down a lot at the end. I also added a good dose of balsamic vinegar. I had so much sauce that I saved the remainder and tossed some tilapia and scallops in for dinner the next night! Again- excellent!

Great recipe. Fun to play around with different herbs (fresh basil, thyme, rosemary, etc.) and various wines. Flavor profile is always different but good. Can't mess this one up.

Love this recipe. I have made is so many times. Perfect as written and my daughter and husband LOVE it. I make sure that I use a decent quality wine. Make sure it is something you would drink. The choice of wine really makes a difference in how the recipe comes out. I use a nice Spanish wine, or a good quality pinot noir. The only thing is that I serve it in a bowl and we eat it with a freshly baked french or italian bread,and we dip it in the juice. It is absolutely heavenly. GREAT RECIPE! This has become one of our family's favorite dinners and often requested. Enjoy!

My son - the picky eater loves this. I add some chopped Roma tomatoes and throw in some sliced mushrooms in the last 15 minutes.

I was concerned about the thickness, so I added 4 tbsp tomato sauce. Also I cut the chicken into medallions no thicker than 1", and then pounded them to a thickness of 1/2". Dredged in flour, onion powder and paprika and browned in oil on high heat. I used canned tomatoes with basil. Left out the bell pepper. I also prepared rotini and tossed in butter and olive oil before serving. May consider following other reviewer's suggestions about substituting sausage or meatballs in the future.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I did add a bit of oregano and basil, because it seemed like it was missing just a bit of flavor, but it turned out great. Served it with rigatoni. Next time, I think we'll try it with meatballs or Italian sausage in place of the chicken. The chicken was really wonderful - just like to switch things up. Whatever, this goes into our family favorites list.

I used sweet red and yellow peppers instead of green peppers; it gave the dish more flavor! I seasoned the vegetables while cooking them, using basil and thyme and a little bit of black pepper. Use your imagination with this recipe!

This is a wonderful, simple-to-make dish. I used boneless chicken breasts, white wine, and diced tomatoes to make this and it turned out tasting exquisite! It goes well with rice and there is not much hassle to getting the recipe to work out as described. I would suggest going easy on the salt if you want to capture the full flavor of the vegetables.

The cook from Boston is right. Some times it's the cook not the recipe. Think about it. I think it's good. Would I make it again? No, because I make my grandmother's recipe.That's what I prefer.

Rating: 4
Bland, eh? If you think this dish is bland, then you must think much Italian cooking is also, depending as it does on simplicity and generally focussing on a few elements per dish. I think that the recipe is good. Flavor of individual ingredients of course makes a difference. A "by-the- way" is that a 1948 chicken had more flavor than a 21st century chicken does, a consequence of breed changes and development as well as feed changes.

As others have noted, this recipe is like a blank slate. More herbs, more veggies, more paste, more just about anything, to taste, and you've got a great savory meal.

This was a good weeknight dish for the winter but I did not find the flavour deep enough. I added some dried oregano once the onions were softened but in future would increase the amount and add different herbs too. I'd also increase the amount of wine and add some tomato paste before adding wine. I used chicken thighs which were tender and easy to prepare.

This is a great "add to"recipe, open for substitutions. I like to make it with turkey thighs (skinned,bone-in) and add cremini and even fennel. Good with polenta, bucatini(hollow spaghetti) or even garlic mashed potatoes.

Rating: 0
On its own, this tasted pretty plain. I substituted red bell pepper for the green, added 1 tsp dried basil leaves to the pot along with 1 cup of frozen peas and 1/2 lb. of baby carrots then simmered it all together. I served the sauce with bowtie pasta for a yummy side.

This was very good. The only changes I made were to use less tomato and I threw in ~ 1/4 cup fresh basil and maybe a teaspoon of fresh thyme.

This was very good; my husband thought it was excellent. Made it with organic chicken thighs and legs. I didn't have any garlic or bell peppers on hand; but I used 4 celery stalks thinly sliced and one small zucchini cut into small cubes. I added these when I added the chicken back into the pot. For the wine, I used a shiraz I happened to have open. I also added a little oregano and a few sprinkles of crushed red chili pepper. I didn't add the last 1/2 tsp. of salt or simmer it for the time specified (maybe only for 15-20 minutes since the pieces of chicken were fairly small and had cooked most of the way through the browning process). The celery and zucchini were still nicely firm when served. I served this with kasmati rice without reducing the sauce much. Next time I might reduce it slightly more. I'd also be tempted to add some green olives.

This recipe took a little longer than I had hoped to make on a weekday, but was worth the wait! I tripled the garlic (we love garlic), only used about 3 pounds of thighs, and served over a bed of Jasmanti rice after cooking and it was very tasty. I also added some fresh thyme and oregano to the garlic when I cooked it and it really added some extra flavor. The leftovers were ever better the next day!

Added celery, chopped carrots, 1 cup of wine, 8oz baby bellas & red pepper flakes. Fried chicken & made sauce the day before. Put in cast iron pot. Baked the next day for about 3 hrs at 300. It was a hit.

Good, basic chicken cacciatore recipe. I used boneless breasts of chicken cut into bite-sized pieces and chopped tomatoes instead of whole. Otherwise, followed the recipe pretty exactly. Very good.

I quadrupled the quantities. Great dish to make the day before. I was feeding a large crowd and needed to save time. Prepared up to placing chicken in sauce. (everything was put in roasting pans.) The next day I cooked the entire thing in the oven for one hour. Lightly covered with foil. Served over linguine on huge platters.

Absolute classic... I use 100% chicken thighs when I make this for my family, since everyone fights over the thighs. You can also simmer the meat a bit longer than when breast or wings are in the mix.

I love this dish! I have a family of five, and any time I can get everything in one pot, it's a good time. I added mushrooms (baby bellas really absorb flavors nicely) celery and capers - because I like them. I always make a big pot of steamed rice and smother it with the cacciatore. Even my mother liked this recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe! When making a tomato based recipe - don't skimp on the quality of the canned tomatos. Muir Glen is a great organic brand. Trust me it will make all the difference. Easy recipe and so flavorful. I didn't use the peppers, but did add mushrooms. This has become a regular in my house & I make to take to larger family gatherings. AWESOME!

I absolutely love this recipe! It was easy and fun to make, and it turned out perfectly. This is a light, fresh dish with a bit of wine and tomato, elegant and trustworthy. I will definately serve it for company. We added fresh mushrooms and served it with spaghetti and freshh green beans on the side.

Very good dish that saves well. I served it over pine nut cous cous and it was delicious. Mushrooms would be a great addition, perhaps sauteed first.

This recipe came out great but I made some additions. I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used chopped up tomatoes and added that to the onion and garlic mixture, then added dried oregano, tyme and fresh parsely. Once that started going I added the bell pepper last with the chicken so it would not get mushy. Then I added tomatoe sauce and chicken broth. I don't drink so I didn't add wine. To thicken the sauce I added some flour. I served it with spagetti noodles that I sauted it with lemon zest, parmigiana, garlic, salt and pepper. My husband and I loved the flavors and found it very tasty and filling. I would definately make it again!!!!

this will become a weeknight regular. it was a last minute choice as i am SO BORED by my usual cooking, so i checked the freezer and found i had 'chicken tenders' (i think in the real world they are the tenderloin of the chicken breast. as my husband's family is hungarian (but wish they were itlaian), we always have green peppers so they went in. i used chicken tenders instead of meat on the bone; browned them fast in good olive oil. i added 4-5 extra cloves of garlic; i had no red wine so used a sauvingon blanc; i also had no canned tomatoes so chopped up 6-7 medium sized tomatoes off the vine (and 2 T of tomato paste to thicken it quickly as i did not have 2 hours for it to simmer) and added all the fresh porcinis and black olives i had leftover from a pizza party last week. i then served it over pasta. and i used no salt at all for the meat/sauce part while cooking.just salt to taste at the end.it was amazing. in our house, ruled by a 2.75 year old food tyrant who only wants to eat chocolate, scrambled eggs, cereal and museli bars, the proof of its excellence was that she actually sat down at the table and ate an entire plate of it (except the olives) before she started in on 'i want cake'. it made enough that we will have a lovely, warm dinner tomorrow night as well, and i'm looking forward to the sauce ripening and the dish being even better than tonight. next time i shall add fresh herbs from the garden and use chicken on the bone, but that would be enough to bump this up to an entertaining recipe level. this recipe, with or without changes is really superb and foolproof.

Really not bad. I made it with Morningstar Farms Veggie Chick'n strips instead of the actual chicken. I made the strips and set them aside. I then made the sauce but left out the stock. I added a bit more S&P and included the mushrooms as suggested. I didn't serve it over pasta or rice - as it's Passover, but I bet that would be good too. Even better the next day.

This recipe was simple and absolutely delicious. Mushrooms were a perfect addition and I even added a little bit more garlic. I think it might be a little more "eater friendly" with boneless chicken breasts but all in all, it was FABULOUS!!

Great basic recipe - needs fresh herbs - I used rosemary and thyme, probably more garlic than called for and added sliced baby bella mushrooms half way though. If you like chicken that is moist and falling off the bone try this one. I made it with pasta, but would be nice with polenta also

Used red and yellow peppers instead of green, and added mushrooms. Made a huge batch and served with rice. Delicious and a big hit. Will most certainly make it again since it uses ingredients I can easily find in my local shopping street (Would give it 3 1/2 forks, actually.)

I am not a green bell pepper fan and eliminated both the green pepper and onion and used chopped fennel instead. Added some mushrooms, black olives, oregano and thyme. Delicious.

Easy. Good flavor. Used orange pepper instead and lots more garlic cloves. Agree with others that mushrooms could easily be added. Flavor of wine with canned tomatoes worked well, and chicken was moist. Sauce cooked down a bit too much at the end, so pay attention to that!

Cacciatore, in Italian means "hunter style" and that implies that the dish is rustic and contains tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and sometimes wine. But particularly mushrooms. Without mushrooms it isn't really Chicken Cacciatore.

Rating: 3
It just wanted to remind everyone that if you use the ratings section to discuss a recipe and not to actually rate the recipe, the program reads your rating as a "no-fork", "not make again" dish. Maybe someday Epicurious will add a questions and comments section for each recipe. Until then, all the comments without "forks" unfairly negatively effect the recipe's rating. I did make the dish and my family enjoyed it with the addition of some pesto and other Italian touches. Like my fellow cook from the Golden Isle's commented, it is a bit bland as written.

Re the use of green pepper (capsicum). My grandfather's recipe used chopped celery and grated carrot and a dry white wine rather than red. Yummo.

Olivia, I'm not much on green bell peppers, either. You could easily substitute red or yellow or orange pepper instead, or omit the pepper completely. Sliced mushrooms are a nice addition/substitute, too. You can also stir in some fresh chopped herbs (parsley and/or basil or tarragon) at the last minute for color and freshness.

I don't react well to bell peppers. Would the recipe suffer much if I left them out? Any suggestions for substitutions. I don't care if it would make it in authentic, I'm more concerned about making food that is agreable to me and my family.
