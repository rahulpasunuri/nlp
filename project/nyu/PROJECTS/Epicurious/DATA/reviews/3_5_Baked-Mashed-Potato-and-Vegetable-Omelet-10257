Yummy! I changed the veggies - threw in broccoli and eliminated green pepper. I also used cheddar instead of parmesan. It's one of those recipes you can have fun with and change every time.

The other night, I made roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and a saute of summer squash, red peppers, shallots, and tarragon. This was a perfect way to use up the leftover potatoes and sauteed veggies. I used more parmesan because I'm a cheese freak, and it was delicious!

I halved this recipe, substituting bottled roasted red pepper and green onions for the peppers and onions called for. It made a nice quick supper for my toddler and me. Next time I make it, I will probably vary the types of vegetables I use, and will try adding small cubes of ham. This is one of those recipes you can have fun playing with.

I was searching for a way to utilize left over mashed potatoes for breakfast and Wa-La!! This was it!! It was very delicious. And instead of an omlette, I made it into a casserole. I just combined everything and put it into a pan and baked it. And I just noticed tonight that someone else also used portobellos! Yummy, we all loved it.

Even without the peppers (and with instant mashed potatoes)this was a very tasty, rich dish. I used portobello mushrooms. Yum! I assume the peppers would add even more dimension and less uniform heaviness to this dish. As it was, a little time consuming;would be even more so when using whole potatoes. A very delicious quiche-like brunch entree.
