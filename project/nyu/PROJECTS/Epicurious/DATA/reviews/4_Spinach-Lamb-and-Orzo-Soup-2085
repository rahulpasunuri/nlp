Delicious! Fast and easy!

This is a terrific soup, not at all bland (though I did add garlic). And a heartier broth would overwhelm the lamb, I think. I made the broth the day before so I could skim the fat off the next day, added carrots to the onions in the second step just to get more veggies in (and the resulting color was an added bonus). No need to brown the meat first, as some reviewers did; the recipe does not require it and adding that step makes it a less attractive recipe from a time standpoint. I also did not strain the broth, I like the vegetables. But properly salted and peppered, the broth is sublime. And the combination of the lamb, veggies, and orzo is terrific. This is a keeper.

I added garlic when I sauteed the onion

This is a fantastic soup. Incredibly tasty and super easy to make. Instead of orzo I used bulgur wheat the first time and pearl barley the second time (they are healthier), otherwise kept the exact recipe (used frozen spinach). Both versions are great. I think the soup is better the next day. I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. One of my favorite recipes ever.

This was really good. Used the lamb bone from Easter dinner. Took suggestions of other reviewers and did not strain, added more spinach, the beef broth instead of 1/2 the water. Also added garlic and white pepper. The only thing I will do differently next time is to make the broth portion ahead and skim off the fat, before adding back the veggies and meat, and adding spinach and orzo.

I like the idea of this dish, but haven't made it yet. I really think twenty minutes is way too long to cook the orzo, though, especially if making a day ahead. 8-10 minutes should be plenty, whether you toast the pasta or not, maybe even less if you're not eating it immediately.

Totally yummy. I added 2 jalapenos to broth which I simmered an extra hour and did not strain. And at the end, a bunch of diced beet greens, extra spinach, 1 cup apple cider, and two diced apples at the end.

I really liked this recipe. I browned the lamb first and added a little more spinach than the recipe but other than that I made it exactly as specified. I think it had plenty flavor. To me lamb has a strong flavor no matter what.

I liked the idea of the soup, but modified the technique by first browning the lamb shanks in olive oil. Removed the shanks; sauteed the vegetables (added plenty of garlic) until softened. Then, added all of the liquid and the lamb and proceeded with recipe. Substituted arugula for the spinach.

I had boned a leg of lamb, and used the bones like it was a shank. It worked out very nicely. It was a rich and tasty soup - after I remembered to add the aslt.

Excellent soup. In the interest of a little more heartiness which I like I made a few changes. I minced the "broth" vegetables, adding a few cloves of minced garlic (what are lamb shanks without garlic) and a large onion (minced), sauted them until soft and then continued with the recipe. I also substituted beef broth for half the water. I did not strain the broth and did not add the onion at the end. I used a little extra spinach AND let the whole thing sit overnight before reheating and serving. It got rave review at a dinner party.

This is a bland tasting dish and does not have the hardy flavor one would like in a meat stock soup. I would find a better recipe to use my lamb shanks in next time.

haven't made it yet, but I am going to brown the orzo then add the reserved cooking liquid. I will also add the fresh spinach to each individual bowl the laddle the soup over it. This adds a nice demension to the soup.

Epicurious should include fat, fiber, and calorie (and perhaps other) nutritional information with each recipe.

Wonderful flavor. Reminds me of something my grandmother use to make
