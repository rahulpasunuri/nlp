So good. I used canned chicken and too much chicken broth. It turned into a Mexican chicken soup with the heat of chili. It was fantastic!

This is a delicious recipe. I especially appreciated the lime flavor and the whole chunks of turkey instead of ground meat that one usually gets with chilis. Watch the size of your slow cooker though! The recipe says it's for a 3.5-6 quart and mine is 4 quarts but didn't hold everything and I had to pull some of the ingredients out.

I did everything except the jalapeno. Used cubed turkey vs leftover. Didn't kick it up too much because small children were indulging. I might add a touch more lime, but all in all it was tasty and filling. I will definitely do it again.

Prepared as written except that I substituted flour for the cornmeal. To answer the earlier question: using either of them thickens it. I added 2 whole dried arbol chiles instead of the jalapeno. That and the ancho powder gave it a nice bit of heat. It was noticeable but not overpowering.

Great use of the leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I didn't have the green beans but other than that, made it as written. It doesn't serve 10 however. Maybe 4-6 with small second helpings. Will definitely make again.

This recipe worked perfectly for me and the leftover smoked turkey I had in my refrigerator. The smokeyness of the turkey added some depth to the already full-flavored stew. I didn't add the cornmeal or the green beans, but I did use the chipotle peppers which also added just enough spice to give it a kick, but not be overbearing. Would definitely make this again, big hit with my husband. Garnished with cilantro and avocado and a squeeze of lime.

What's with the "add cornmeal and toss to coat"? What is there to toss and coat? Is this a mistake? Would like to try this recipe but this part seems like an error.
