Different and tasty! Made it with pierogies as a side dish. The only change I made was to heat the olive oil and then simmer the shallots in it for a minute to get rid of the raw taste. In the future, I would slice the apples and cuke ribbons into smaller pieces - it was a little unwieldy to eat.

I borrowed a bit from this recipe to use up my leftovers from "Smoked Salmon, Fennel and Goat Cheese Toasts" which were phenomenal for my birthday dinner party. I used the same dressing as shown here, but the main salad was chopped romaine, diced fennel and the leftover goat cheese (with fennel and terragon) and salmon. Very, very good.

This salad is really different and it is a welcome change. I like it immensely. I will make it again and use the idea of smoked salmon in other salads. I hope the editors will give us more unusual main dish salads.

Simple and clean! I had to change the cut to a small dice to make a sort of "salad shot" in mini cups, but the crunch of the cukes and apple with the rich salmon in the tangy dressing was a great pairing. A nice, refreshing combination - yum!

Easy to make. Excellent blend of tastes. Cucumber in ribbons works great in this combination.

I absolutely loved this salad. It was such a great spring or summer time dish and a wonderful light start to a seafood dinner. Plus it is so easy to make. Enjoy

I liked the combination of flavors but wanted to make a luncheon salad so I diced the cuke and apple, blended with a can of smoked salmon (about 8 oz.), 3 thinly sliced scallions, juice from half a lemon and a good dollop of mayo. I added in about 1/2 t of the caraway seeds, and a grind or two of pepper. I plated the sald with the watercress underneath and sprinkled the top with the remaining 1/2 t of seeds. Nice change from tuna fish.

Mmm. How can smoked salmon not be good? Still, this is a creative way to serve it.

This receipe tasted great and was very easy to make. I substituted the watercress for fresh chopped spinich. I would definitely make this again.

Yum. I subbed some garlic cloves for the shallots and added white wine vinegar, but this salad was good! It would probably be a better first course than a main course, and it would be great at a dinner party.

I made this as a dinner for 2...the combination of vegetables, fruit and salmon sounded odd but it all worked together for a flavor sensation. My husband loved it - I'll definitely serve it again!
