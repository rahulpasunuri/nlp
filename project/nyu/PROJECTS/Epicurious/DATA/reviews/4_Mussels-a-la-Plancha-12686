Warning to the feint of heart: With 8 chipotles, that will be a VERY hot salsa.

My favorite way to cook mussels. I heat up a gas grill and roast them in a grill wok. It gives them a drier, less gooey texture than steamed mussels, and a great roasted flavor. The salsa recipe takes some time, but makes enough for many batches. I serve them with freash wheat bread, which we use to soak up the extra butter.
