A very pretty dish but lacking a flavor element. I added lemon juice, more salt and pepper which helped but not enough.

Great color but not making again. Color of dish is spectacular but taste mediocre. Far too bland!

I made it as a side dish along with Buffalo tederloin that I made on the grill. It was a bit bland, I probably put more lemon peel and parsley than it called for in the recipe to zip it up a bit. The buffalo had a very spicy rub on it so this was to balance it. I was not taken with it but my wife and our guests both loved it.

With 6 tablespoons of butter, it's hard to imagine thisrecipe listing in the "healthy" section.

This was only OK. I have made risotto with butternut squash before and not liked it very much. I love pasta with butternut squash and thought I might like the israeli couscous. The squash is just a little bland and mushy compared to the couscous and the flavor is lacking. I saved it a bit by putting in sage at the last minute (I could tell it wasn't quite right) and then folded in walnuts at the end. Still, I wouldn't make it again.
