Wonderful and easy! I used tilapia, rather than sole, and it was delicious. I made the packets a few hours before dinner and once guests arrived, just popped them in the oven to bake. (It took at least 15 minutes to finish cooking.) Didn't make the ciabatta. Served with scalloped potatoes and green salad. Everyone raved!

Loved this.. Easy, quick and flavorful. Do not worry about parchment pouches, wrap and seal any way you want. Have extra bread for sauce.

I made this yesterday. It was amazingly flavorful. I didn't have Sole, so I used wild caught Hake. After opening the pouch on the plate, I spooned roasted vegetable couscous into the pouch and it sopped up all the delicious sauce created in the papillote. So easy and so delicious.

Mui Bien! This was so easy and I'm not a fish fan as a rule. It's going into the book as a keeper. (My hubby even tipped his plate to savor the leftover sauce?!?! The highest complement. 8-)

Had to cook 12 minutes instead of 8, but turned out perfectly and was delicious

Don't get turned off by the parchment wrap. I do mine lunchbag style. Put the fish in the middle of a large piece of paper, load it up with the tasty stuff, bring two sides of the paper up to meet, fold them back down and fold the ends under like a present, or the way a butcher wraps meat. The idea is to seal in the steam. Parchment is stronger than most people think. That said, this is a really good recipe, looks very sophisticated for not a lot of work. I do it with halibut as well.

Haven't made this yet, but it sounds wonderful! I am bewildered by the parchment cutting...how and what for?
