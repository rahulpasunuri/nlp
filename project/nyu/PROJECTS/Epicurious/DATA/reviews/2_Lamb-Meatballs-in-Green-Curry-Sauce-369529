Used lean beef with this, and added prepared Thai Green Curry Paste. Super yummy. It was a new take on both meatballs and on curry - so don't be dissuaded by previous negative reviews. We made it anyway and were happy we did.

one word: Horrible. Really not a good Curry sauce to start with - certainly nothing like a real Thai Curry - if that's the expectation. Yea, it has coconut milk, but that's really about where it ends as curry. The Sauce & meatball combination just turned into a goop - and when paired with rice, just a starchy mess. The garam marsala was almost indistinguishable in either the sauce or the meatballs. It was edible, but just not very good. Deleted from my recipes.

Wow. This recipe is greasy, greasy, greasy as written. The curry was curry, and lovely as such, but when you cook the meatballs in the sauce, all the fat from the meat just floats on top. Gross. Cooking the meatballs separately is a better option, but I'm not sure it's worth it. There are nicer things to eat in a curry, and it's just not the best way I've ever eaten a meatball, either. Unless I'm making a meatball smorgasbord, I'm pretty sure I'll never bother with this again. I might crib the sauce recipe, though, since it's easy enough.
