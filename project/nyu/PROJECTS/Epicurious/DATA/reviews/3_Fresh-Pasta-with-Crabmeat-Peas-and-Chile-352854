IN Israel, I made this with meat of small crabs (sartanim) which I cooked and emptied myself. The result was beautiful! I used quality dried pasta.

Nice pasta dish. Used dried instead of fresh pasta but it was fine.

With a recipe this simple I really don't get how people can substitute anything for the crab meat or the fresh chiles and still feel they have made the dish. Anyway, with the correct ingredients, it is boss.

I listened to other comments and used whole-wheat pasta, a little bit more oil, and fresh tomatoes... it turned out great! I would absolutely make this recipe again.

I used purchased fresh whole wheat pasta and also added a small plum tomato into the sauce. Used fresh peas. I thought it was delicious--not overly heavy. For company I would probably use more parmesan and oil, but for health reasons I liked the suggested amounts for home.

Extremely tasty and easy. I used pre-cooked prawns instead of crab meat and it was a big hit. Be sure to use a ton of parmesan and olive oil, though, or else the pasta can become a bit dry.

This came together very quickly. I did not have the fresh chiles on hand but the dried pepper flakes did the trick. Next time I will add a little bit of garlic. Nice, easy dish for a weeknight. I'm not sure why the recipe says it feeds eight--2-4 is more like it if this is the main dish!
