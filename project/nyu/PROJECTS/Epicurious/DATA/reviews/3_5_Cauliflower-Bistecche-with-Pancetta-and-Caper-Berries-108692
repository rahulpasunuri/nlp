I also did the floret route and made more of a salad. I doubled the amount of caulifllower because there seemed to be a lot of extras to go with it. Made it for a BBQ and somebody asked me for the recipe.

I loved this dish. I have made it twice but at the moment I dont have cast iron pans to use and cant get the cauliflour to stay together so I used flowerlets the second time. I am living in Spain and I think its very difficult to find salt packed capers here, but the regular ones are great anyway(for the person who asked). And yesterday when I made it I only had moscatel raisins (with seed in).. it was fabulous none the less. Try it!

No salt-packed capers at Whole Foods so I substituted the caper berries I had in the pantry. A week night dinner so I didn't want the bother of two skillets to clean so went with the method of separating the cauliflower into flowerets and sauteeing until golden and then roasting. Also kept a little of the pancetta aside for some crunch on top. All in all it was a very nice cauliflower dish, so I'll keep looking for the salt-packed capers to see what they add.

In a hurry I chopped the head of the lovely light green "Italian Cauliflower" and stir fried it with all of the ingredients that I had at hand - no bacon or raisens - added oven-dried tomatoes I found in the fridge and plain non-pareil capers and it was delicious and colorful on the plate. I will do it again with a proper shopping list when I have time, but we loved my quick version.

Very tasty and more substantial than it sounds. I used bottled capers and Canadian bacon instead of pancetta. I also added a couple of splashes of dry white wine to the sauce as it seemed a bit dry.

In answer to a cook from Baton Rouge, I used the regular bottled capers and it was absolutely delicious. It also looks very pretty and I didn't have any problems with the cauliflower coming apart.

I would love to try this and would like to know if the reviewers actually used the salt packed capers and the caperberries or if they used regular nonpareil variety. Thank you for your response.

Easy to make providing you organize your ingredients ahead of time, the only drawback to this recipe is that the cauliflower becomes very fragile with cooking and needs very careful handling not to break apart in the pan once it is sauteed. Otherwise, terrific flavors and easy to make.

Once I tried this I had to have it again! My "meat and potatoes" husband even loved it - twice!
