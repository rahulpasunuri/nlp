Wow - delicious! Tried it for the first time tonight and took other reviewers' advice and used half dark chocolate and half semi-sweet. Definitely feels very versatile and I didn't feel like the orange flavoring overwhelmed the fondue. Next time, I'll try all dark chocolate just to see how it tastes.

This was requested by my supper club for an encore. I did substitute half and half for cream and it seems fine. The orange zest and Grand Marnier are in perfect balance. I played with using less GM but it really is the right amount. My family loves it, too.

This has been my "go to" chocolate fondue recipe since it was published. There's no point in wasting time looking for another one. Perfect as is... BTW -- I'm so glad that it's still in the online database as I don't have a copy of the magazine anymore. :)

I was making chocolate covered strawberries for work and thought that white chocolate would look better with the orange zest. When adding the the Grand Marnier the color of the white chocolate turned to a buttercream color and was very thin. I added about another 8oz of white choc.; the color was whiter but it now became too thick. I thought back to what others had wrote and added some water, kept it in a hot water bath and stired before each use. In the end the strawberries looked great and the taste was fantastic, we now make them for all VIP parties and guest. I am now looking for a chocolate with a bold color for the fall and other holidays and with the same or similar flavor?

OK - not sure what went wrong here. Made this,and the awesome champagne cheese fondue recipe on this site, for a wine tasting. All went well on the stove and when I first put into fodue pot (on low flame); but then it separated, badly. Stirred frequently, but still was separating - seemed to be the Grand Marnier was settling on top. Looked bad - but actually tasted great!! Will try again, becuase the flavor was yummy, but with a different brand of chocolate to see if that helps. Served with various fruits, pound cake squares, and marshmallows.

Holy crap this was amazing. I used Guittard semisweet chocolate and it was fantastic.

Normally, I would say that it's hard to improve on pure chocolate, but this recipe succeeds brilliantly. The orange flavor is amazing. I thinned the fondue a little bit extra and used it in my chocolate fountain to rave reviews.

fabulous!!! I made this for dessert today after a gr8 meal turned out better than i expected!!! Bananas and pears are perfect for dipping. The grand marnier is not too overpowering like i thought it would be.

I made this for New Years Eve for my family of four (2 kids). My husband and I could have eated it up with a spoon, but the kids didn't like the bittersweet chocolate (and I substituted 1/3 milk chocolate like others suggested). I used Triple Sec and that was very mild. We used strawberries, pears and pound cake, but to our surprise, we liked the pears best in the fondue.

Wow! This was wonderful. I made this for a pre-Easter party. We doubled the recipe and used 2/3 dark Dove chocolate and 1/3 Dove milk chocolate. I soaked the orange peel in the cream while we were eating dinner and used triple sec for flavoring. We made pigs of ourselves and there was almost nothing left!

This made a simple and elegant Valentine's dessert. I halved the recipe for two and still had quite bit left over, which is never a problem! Leftover ganache becomes truffles, rolled into balls and coated with cocoa, or mousse, folded into whipped cream.

I made this for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I do think it was very rich and if you don't like bittersweet chocolate then you could use a milk chocolate instead. To make it more kid friendly you could cut back on the orange liquor and replace it with equal amounts of vanilla or cream.

Very good....simple to make. When I made this, I only served it with bananas and fresh pineapple. Cut the recipe in half for 4 people. I had oddles left. Rich and satisfying

This was the most simple chocolate fondue I have ever made...and delicious! I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, but otherwise left the recipe alone. My favorites to dip are caramel squares and strawberries...YUM!

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it was devoured. I left out the liqueur because the orange zest by itself provided enough orange flavor. Very simple, very yummy. I will definitely make again.

I made the chocolate fondue for a Holiday party. It was simple to make and everyone loved it. It was a huge hit and it was all gone by the end of the night.

Ridiculously simple and sublime. While the fruit and pound cake were delicious in the fondue, they were almost unnecessary, as a spoon worked just fine.

Thanks to all the positive reviewers, I chose this recipe over the large selection of other fondue dessert recipes. Our company was impressed. The combination of chocolate & orange was delicious!

This is a fun and easy dessert for true chocolate lovers. The best chocolate-orange combo I have ever tasted!

Easy and Excellent! Fun, too. Ghirardelli Double Chocolate chips are bittersweet chocolate, can be found in most groceries and work perfectly. I agree with two earlier reviewers: let orange zest soak in the cream during dinner and leave or remove as preference goes (I leave it), and pound cake is better than angel food. Kid friendly? Decrase Grand Marnier to one & a half tbs.

Wow...great for our "private" V-Day dessert! We used Angel food cake, apples, fresh pineapple and banana slices for dipping. It was absolutely perfect!

Made this for Valentine's Day. Was a little messy, but the family loved it. Didn't use pound cake, but should have and left out the angel food cake because it broke apart in the fondue. Certainly was fun though.

Wonderful fondue - Served this at a holiday cocktail party and it was an absolute hit...everyone stayed by the fondue pot - I made it even easier by using Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips - what an easy and elegant dessert - everyone will think you worked all day.

Have made this twice- it's definitely easy and very yummy! People will think you took more time on this than you really did. Definite keeper.

This was soooo easy and delicious. I prepared it early in the evening for a dinner party and left it on the stove at lowest simmer. It turned out beautifully. Delicious with those little cream puffs you can get at Costco or Sam's.

Very, very rich & decadent. We had already filled up on 3 savory fondues for dinner, so our guests were a bit shy with this one, esp. when compared to a caramel fondue from the Bon Appetit Cooking Class on Foolproof Soufflé (http://www.epicurious.com/b_ba/b02_class/souffle/souffle.html). Next time, I would consider heating the orange zest in the cream first, then straining the zest out before adding the chocolate & Grand Marnier (I prefer smooth).

This is an easy recipe that WOWs your guests. After a wonderful meal, we served this fondue on the patio with coffee. It is absolutely delicious and fondue is great for enjoying great conversation !

This is a great recipe! It's the traditional chocolate fondue with a special kick! I have made it many times. I've also tried it with fresh squeezed orange juice instead of the cream. You can add a little arrowroot powder if it needs to be thickened up. Finely chopped almonds or unsalted peanuts are also great to add. Use a double boiler and it will be perfect every time!

I have been making this dish since the recipe was first printed in 1997. I use it all the time when enternaining. It is a quick easy dessert that gets 'em everytime!

This was yummy. I used Frangelico and omitted the orange peel, since I didn't have any Grand Marnier. I had to add water too. It sure tasted good, and was very easy.

My fiance is a huge fan of Grand Marnier, so when I was planning a finger food type dessert for a party we were planning, I chose this recipe. It was a hit, both with him *and* with our company! I used only strawberries, bananas and pound cake, and it worked out well. I also made a swiss fondue and needed my only fondue pot for that, so after I made this fondue, I kept it in a warmer, and it worked out great!

I love the orange chocolate combination. It wasn't melting well, and my friend recommended I add water to it. That did the trick and the fondue turned in to a rich, velvety texture.

I honestly needed a good dessert fondue and decided to try this one even though I'm not a big orange-flavored chocolate fan. I omitted the orange peel and substituted a high quality vanilla cordial for the Grand Marnier and the recipe was a success. I imagine the proportions of chocolate to heavy cream and any flavored liquor would work well. It was very smooth, very chocolatey, and very rich.
