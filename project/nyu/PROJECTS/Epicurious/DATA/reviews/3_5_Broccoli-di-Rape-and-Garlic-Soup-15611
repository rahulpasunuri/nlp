Satisfying! Made this with some pork herb sausage, potato instead of pasta, a dash of sriracha sauce, and an extra cup or two of chicken broth, finally finishing without the parm. I'm extremely pleased with the results and I'll try a vegetarian version on another occasion.

FYI - Admitting up front that I altered the recipe. I had two heads of broccoli that needed to be cooked or risk getting thrown out. I made the garlic broth with the following changes: half Trader Joe's Organic Low-Sodium Chicken Broth, remaining liquid water with 1 veggie broth bouillon cube. I did NOT add any salt or pepper to the broth. I used 2 heads of finely chopped broccoli (florettes only, no stalk). Added the salt & pepper after the broccoli was added. About 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice from 1 lemon off dad's tree. This was delicious. Very refreshing and zingy flavored. It was better the next day than the first night. Next time I plan on cooking the pasta separately and pureeing the soup after the broccoli is cooked, adding the pasta afterwards.

This recipe offers a good starting point from which to work, but it requires a lot of adjustment to create a hearty and flavorful soup. I used chicken broth rather than water, added a smoked turkey leg to the broth as it was cooking, seived the cooked garlic into the soup, added a bunch of swiss chard in addition to the rapini, included four sweet italian sausages, crumbled into the soup as it cooked, and seasoned with a pinch of red pepper flakes, some fennel seeds,some fresh rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Orzo worked well as the pasta addition. I also made a gremolata with lemon zest, italian parsley, garlic, bread crumbs, and oregano, which we sprinkled over the bowls of soup. We all loved this meal, but we all thought the soup would have been hopeless without these adjustments.

sounds good, but I couldn't determine how much and how to make the garlic soup. Please look at recipe and advise. thanks

I could have substituted chicken broth for some of the water, added crumbled Italian sausage, red pepper flakes, onion, etc., but didn't. Went with it as is for the healthy slant. The family wasn't impressed. I thought is was blatantly "light" but nice for every once in awhile. It was voted "thumbs down" by all and just might be made again with some additions.

This is a different way for me to enjoy Rape which is one of my favortie veggies. I did not use kosher salt. I only used about 1/2 tsp of table salt and I felt that was plenty since I knew the cheese would add salt to it.

I was pleasantly surprised by this soup. The garlic took a long time to prepare (peel, etc), but it was worth it. This soup is great for cold winter nights or when you are under the weather.

When my husband and I got the flu this season, we lived on this soup. It made us feel better every time we ate it ... and we ate a lot of it. Even my pickiest friends wanted seconds.
