Prepared this for a Bachelorette Party, a big hit!! We thought it was a delicious way to eat pineapple and low calorie, vegan, dairy free! Will always eat my pineapple this way.

I wouldn't call this dessert, but this was delicious nonetheless. If nothing else, a great way to use up a pineapple!

I've died and gone to heaven. I used my silly Magic Bullet blender to chop the mint, sugar, and bourbon. I had purchased pre-sliced pineapple from Costco previously and didn't know what to do with all the extra. Problem solved. I cut them into chunks, poured on the mint concoction, and set it in the fridge. Who knew there would be a recipe for Kentucky Pesto?!

two words to take this from good to amazing: grill it.

Is there anything better than mint and pineapple? Oh wait - yes there is - mint, pineapple and bourbon! Sometimes the simplest things in life really are most pleasurable. Again, it's another fabulous recipe that lends itself to substitutions and to be played around with. Love it! Summer come back...

Light. Refreshing. Delish. (Oh, and as with most things in life, this was better with extra whiskey.)

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I also used 3 Tbs KY Bourbon (because it is the only kind.) Definitely bringing it out again on the fourth.

The combination of sweet Guatemalan pineapple, mint and a hint of whisky was a great discovery. Never did a pineapple disappear so fast!

Yum! I used candy mint with great results.

Hard to believe that only one other person has reviewed this delicious, refreshing dessert. I agree that letting it macerate for a few hours really improves and mellows the flavors, giving just a subtle hint of mint. The minimal amt. of sugar brings out the flavor of the pineapple as well. Also used extra bourbon: 3 T instead of 2. There wouldn't have been enough liquid to strain otherwise. We had it after a dinner of spicy Indian food, and it was a wonderful ending.

This was the absolute hit with all of the adults at my son's birthday party. I simply mixed everything together and let it macerate overnight. I did add more bourbon than was called for (4T instead of 2T), and it was not at all overpowering. A simple, surprising and tasty blend. One hint...my vac-u-vin pineapple slicer, which I love, does not do well with the new supersweet pineapples, so I had to slice them the old-fashioned way. And don't forget, if it's not from KY, it's not bourbon (Sorry Jack Daniels--had to pull out the Wild Turkey!).
