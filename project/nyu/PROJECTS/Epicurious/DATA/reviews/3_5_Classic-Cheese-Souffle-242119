Not bad, but I thought adding the shredded cheese during the folding of the whites was a bad idea, as the weight of the cheese almost certainly popped a lot of bubbles. I would recommend melting the cheese into the roux instead. I also had to bake this about 20 minutes longer than indicated in the recipe, very annoying.

Excellent soufflé. Highly suggest adding fresh chopped herbs - about 1/2 cup. I used parsley and dill. For cheese, I used a mix of a capricious (hard aged goat) from Petaluma and cotswold (it's what I had on hand). Fantastic! ...... I should also mention that I followed Julia's instructions for beating the whites (rub inside of bowl with salt/vinegar mix and add 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter and a pinch of salt once your whites begin to foam).

My family can't get enough of this souffle. It barely serves four of us as a main course. I have made it as written, and I have made it using a mixture of sharp and smoked cheddar, which was really good, too. The name "Classic Souffle" fits this recipe perfectly!

Great recipe. I added more cheese, Parmesan, Brie and some grilled lardons. It was excellent. Really only serves 4 people, so add 1/3rd of everything for 6 people.

This is a great recipe, I have been making it for a couple years now and even my 6 and3 year old sons love it. Sharp cheddar is nice or really just about any cheese works out. It is also simple to prepare. We like it best with a baguette and lemon dressed salad.

I made this with Irish cheddar, and it was very good. I like the effect from coating the souffle dish with butter and parmesan. And, it was very pretty!

Made this for a vegetarian Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. In fact, my husband called it food of the gods. This was my first souffle, and I modified slightly: used good quality provolone, added pepper and hot sauce per JC's original recipe. Served with good bread and a spinach salad. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was my first attempt at a souffle and I was surprised how easy it was to make. Came out tall and fluffy as pictured. I did use only about 1/4 tsp salt because I was worried with the cheeses that 1/2 tsp would just be too much. Served with an arugula salad with balsalmic strawberries. Don't think it would serve 6, I served it to 4 and it was finished off!

Light, fluffy and absolutely amazing flavor. Much easier than I thought it would be. Reduced the serving size and used a sharp cheddar slightly and it still came out perfect. Added sesame seeds on top--a la Jeno, my husband's Hungarian grandmother.

I'd never made a souffle with a roux base before - and will, from now on. So rich, substantial yet fluffy. Next time I'll halve the salt and add some fresh herbs - maybe with a sharp cheddar.

The Julia Child recipe is the one we've been using at home since I was tiny-- I think where this one goes wrong is with the salt (excessive using almost any cheese-- I'd cut it in half) & the cooking time, which in my oven is at least 35 minutes. Also if you're serving 6 expect very small portions. I've found the Epicurious recipe for the Gruyère & Parmesan soufflé much more successful. Make sure your bowl & beaters are absolutely clean!

I agree that it's a bit too salty- I'd probably leave the salt out. Also, I prefer to add the cheese to the sauce before the egg yolks so that it melts and gives a more uniform texture. Works well with a sharp cheddar.

This was my first souffle and I stumbled through it and it still turned out great! My boyfriend and I were very pleased, We had a simple salad and blackened catfish with our souffles and it was perfect! I've made them 3 times in 2 weeks! They are even tastey the next day heated up, although incredibly deflated.

This recipe was a disappointment. It was my first cheese souffle, and I was really disappointed with the flavor. I did not like the nutmeg taste, and normally I enjoy nutmeg in savory cheese dishes. It also took longer to bake, more like 35 minutes.

i made this with an orphaned chunk of Fol Epi i found languishing in the cheese drawer; i also used some frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry). it is pertty good, but it did not puff up as much as expected. i imagine that it is because of the added weight of the spinach...i think the container i used is bigger than the recipe calls for as well. this was my first souffle. it really is pretty good, but it just did not puff up as much as i had hoped it would--probably my mistake somehow. i will try this one again.

This was my first time making souffle, after reading the article I decided I should try it. It was easy, delicious, and felt like I was making something really impressive.

Have made numerous dessert souffles, but never the classic cheese. This turned out picture perfect! Served it with just a simple greed salad, and got a "10" from my husband. We thought it was delicious and definitely would do it again.

the souffle was too salty for my taste. also, more robust cheese probably would make it more interesting

This was also the first souffle that I have made--I was inspired by a recent trip to France. It turned out wonderfully. I don't think it is a heavy meal at all! It had a really amazing texture, so light and fluffy, and the flavor was really, really good. Will definitely make it again.

This was my first Souffle, and it turned out beautifully. I used the finest ingredients at my disposal, and yet it didn't quite turn out to be what I expected. It was a little bit like a glorified quiche or maybe even egg bake. The only thing that sets this apart is the beautiful texture. I probably won't make it again.

This was the best souffle recipe I have ever tried. I served it with roasted asparagus and balsamic vinegar. During this time of year, all the garden has growing is asparagus and the chickens are giving me more eggs than we can eat so we look for recipes to use both and this was a great discovery and delight.

My husband and I had never made a souffle. Started this at 9:00pm on a whim and we loved it! Easy & Yummy! We are looking forward to trying another.

This didn't work out so well. Never puffed up. Only the sides were puffed and the center was still runny, despite being browned on the top and no jiggle in the center when tested after 25 min. in the oven. Bummer. Served with CI's asparagus, cannelini and arugula salad though which was really good.

I made this last night for a casual dinner with friends and everyone loved it! It was my first souffle and so easy. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk, but that was the only change I made. I also left the souffle base and the egg whites out for about an hour before I beat the egg whites. Served it with leeks and spinach sauted in some bacon and a crusty baguette. YUM! Definetly will make this again.

I've never made a Souffle before so followed the directions exactly & it turned out perfectly. I thought it was good, not great but I think that's because I just don't like souffles.
