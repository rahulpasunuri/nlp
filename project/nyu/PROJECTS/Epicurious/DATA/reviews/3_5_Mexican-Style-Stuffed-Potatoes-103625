Throughly enjoyed this for a change in dinner option. I made some slight additions, went to our local gourmet store, picked up fresh homemade salsa and some homemade chili. Prepared the recipe as noted, topped potatoes off with chili, dollop of sour cream and homemade salsa! Defintely a keeper, especially for a fast and delicious dinner.

Yummy! Made this along with Tortilla Soup.

I thought these were good. I nixed the taco chips inside and added taco seasoning to the mix instead. Then I topped them with some crushed chips for a bit of crunch. My teen-age son thought they were "the best".

I made this dish for my boyfriend and I last night. It was delicious! Very easy to make and to put your own twist to. I used Baked Doritos for the nacho chips and I crushed them to really small pieces, it was a great addition! I would definitely make this again!

I thought the recipe was a great idea, except we found that the nacho chips didn't quiet add the crispness we had hoped for. However for more of a mexican kick I added chopped green inside which still made them turn out quite delicious!

I was not a fan of this dish. I made them with Yukon Gold potatoes as they were smaller and I wanted them as an appetizer. Maybe that was a mistake. However, nacho flavored potatoes apparently don't do it for me.

These were a treat. I took most cooks' advice and added a bit more milk (skim) and some margerine, a dash of Tabasco, and some cayenne, garlic powder, and cumin, and they were delicious. Those who are leaving out the nacho-chip crumbs are eliminating the best part...it's a creative way of adding an interesting spice mix and textural sensation. They were excellent slathered with no-fat sour cream and pieces of avocado. I made half the recipe with lots of cilantro, which I love, and the rest without as my husband doesn't care for it.

Excellent dish, and when using soy milk and no cheese, is a very good vegan main course.

This is a keeper. This a dinner in itself. I used more cilantro and cheese. I did add more milk and salt and pepper. My husband loves this one.

I really enjoy this dish, but I never use the crushed nacho chips. The meat is a good suggestion, down where I live, they use shredded fajitas or brisket to kick it up a notch. I think that using restaurant style tostadas (deep fried corn tortillas seasoned with salt and paprika) could be used on the side as scoops. Quite a tasty and yummy recipe.

Dear Cook ... just keep reading. It's 1 cup packed (shredded) Mexican-style cheeses or grated cheddar. I used green onions and a little Tabasco to up the heat factor.

This was a pretty easy dish to make. I added hamburger to give it more body because I didn't know what "1 cup (Packed) shredded" Is. Maybe lettuce, but we didn't have any anyway. Needs a lot of cayenne.

I love this dish. Twice baked potatoes are our family favorite.

This was a simple recipe but tasty. I did, however, make a few changes: I added milk and butter to make the consistency of the potatoes easier to mix with the other ingredients. However, my guests didn't think the salsa went with the recipe.

This was Ok. I think the Doritos can be left out, they dont really do much for the potato. I will make these again but next time I will season them more with S & P then add garlic powder, chili powder and a pinch of cumin. These did make a nice dinner with a green salad and everyone else liked them alot.
