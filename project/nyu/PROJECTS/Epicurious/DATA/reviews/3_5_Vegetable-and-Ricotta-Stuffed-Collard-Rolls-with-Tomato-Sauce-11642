I have been looking for a nice way to use collard greens and I finally found it! I made some minor modifications, no butter, used olive oil instead. I also added garlic to the sauce. I would definitely recommend this recipe and I would absolutely make it again.

Very good. I really liked the sauce. I probably should have cooked the collards a little bit more, I only boiled them for 2-3 minutes because I was afraid to overcook them. In the ricotta mixture I added leftover cooked vegetables that were in the fridge, and no mozzarella, didn't have any. I sprinkled Parmesan on top instead. Turned out ok!

Instead of butter I used olive oil for all sauteeing. I left out mozarella for parmesan mentioned below. I sauteed shredded zucchini and the bell pepper for the filling. I added two chopped garlic cloves at the end of onion saute. I used 1/2 the corn. I left the wine out and used fresh rosemary in sauce. I also used more filling in each roll and it made twelve well. I used 1/2 cup parsley and put half in sauce and sprinkled half on top along with grated fresh parm. I also did not reduce sauce at beginning or end but put half on bottom of dish and half on top. With all these changes, it wa a winner - but be sure to adjust for enough salt.

Though I am an adventurous eater, I did not particularly enjoy this recipe (nor did the family) though that may just be a personal taste thing. I believe it came out as described I just did not care for the flavor combo/texture.

Nice dish, wonderful flavors. Didn't have to blanch the collards nearly as long, or thicken the sauce. I thickened it before baking. I used the left over filling in a lasagna the following night.

I must confess that I made something of a variation on this recipe, streamlined for a weeknight. To stuff the rolls, used veggies that I had in the house: zucchini, red pepper, leeks and broccoli. Rolled up and baked with a high-quality bottled marinara sauce, topped with shredded parmesan and red pepper flakes. Served with a side of quinoa. Tasty and filling vegetarian dish for passover.

This recipe is really good and versatile. I had a bit of trouble with the collards maybe i blanched them too long? They were a little hard to wrap, blanch a couple extra just in case! I didnt have to thicken the sauce as I left it to boil down enough in first cooking. Added broccoli for a little extra green. served with wild mushroom bread pudding (search for it on here, its great!), super combo! We made it without Mozzarella and with skim ricotta for lower calorie dinner and it was still great and flavorful.

I love the idea of using collards to create a roll! I used what I had on hand for the filling; zucchini, yellow squash and broccoli sauteed up with some yellow onion. The sauce was great... an awesome vegetarian dish.

My daughter's boyfriend introduced me to collards. When I make this recipe, just as it is, he accepts it as a present. He believes he is a great cook, and he is hard to please. But he applauds this one from me.

To accomodate a lactose intolerant person I used a tofu ricotta, replaced the mozzarella with a sheeps milk feta and left out the egg. Really delicious.

This recipe was so incredibly good! My husband liked them better than regular stuffed shells!

I filled mine with a ground cooked chicken and feta and spices with one egg...I would also use the same filling I use for stuffed peppers. I froze as was suggested and served to company last night to raves...I did thawbefore baking and baked uncovered and didn't need to thicken my sauce..

These were great! The collards really held together, yet were tender enough to cut without a knife. The filling almost reminded me of little lasagna rollups. One thing I did change, however, take the sauce after the end reduction, and blend it for a real treat. I then poured the sauce all over the top of the rolls and put it back in the oven until my love returned from work. Came out excellent, only thing I would add would be some jalepenos to the cheese filling material. You must try this recipe now!

I was looking for a new way to use collards and this dish pleasantly surprised me. The recipe is not difficult to make and offers lots of flavor. I made it ahead of time, froze it, then thawed and baked it for an hour. I didn't reduce the sauce afterwards and it was very watery, but still very tasty. The collards weren't bitter at all. I'll definitely make this dish again.
