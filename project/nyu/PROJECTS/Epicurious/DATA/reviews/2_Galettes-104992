The recipe led me to believe that these would come out like crepes, but with the thick batter it produces, not a chance! They are actually exactly like pancakes (in terms of texture and appearance), which for a recipe without any flour OR dairy OR leavening is very impressive. If you're gluten- and/or dairy-intolerant (and are okay with eggs), you'd have a hard time finding a better diet-compliant substitute for pancakes. Dietary restrictions or no, these are pretty tasty - provided that you're okay with the distinctive flavor of buckwheat. The hard cider complements the taste of the grain rather than standing out as a flavor of its own, and as a bonus its carbonation provides enough leavening to make the cakes fluffy. Clever recipe!
