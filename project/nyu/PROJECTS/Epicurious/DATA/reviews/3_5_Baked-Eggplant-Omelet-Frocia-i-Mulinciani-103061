This was a great dish. I love do aheads and serving at room temperature brought out a sweetness in the eggplant that I loved. Salad and crusty bread finished this meal off. Glad to see another Toms River Cook using Epicurious!!

I never would have thought to combine eggplant and eggs. It is a great combination. This dish is good as is or used as a base for a multitude meats or veggies and sauces, which is great for those of us on low-card, high protein diets. I do add about a tablespoon each of heavy cream and water to my eggs for a fluffier texture. Really good cold for breakfast also.

I'm a bit confused, this sounds like a frittada not an omelet.

Very nice for a light supper. Accompanied dish with sauvignon blanc and a mixed greens salad. Broiling eggplant worked to reduce greasiness without compromising taste.

I thought this dish was too oily. I liked the general marriage of the flavors and so I might try it again, but only if I baked the eggplant slices in a hot over. This usually works well and uses a lot less oil. Did everyone who has made this and liked it serve it at room temp? Maybe warm owuld be better.

Easy omelet to make and the results were outstanding. We like spicy foods so I added about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the tomato sauce mixture. Served the salad with fresh greens from our deck garden. This made a great dinner. Based on the other reviews this omelot seems to have a Florida appeal.

It is that time of year! My office mates with gardens keep bringing in stuff to work and as the designated office chef, I have to try to come up with some new ways to use this culinary bounty. Well, this is an excellent use of all the "spare" eggplant from the garden. Except for the firt step, it is fast and simple. A novice cook can recreate this recipe without too much of a hassle. By the way, I substituted feta cheese because I did not have the romano. I do not think the taste suffered. I also add a clove of crushed garlic to the skillet before adding the browned eggplant. This was even good as leftovers.

This was a bit of work, but one of the best omelets I've ever had, any temperature.
