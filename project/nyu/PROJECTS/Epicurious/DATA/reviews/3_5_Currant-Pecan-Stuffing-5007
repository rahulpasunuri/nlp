This recipe is fantastic. I used more sherry and currants, as well as some dried figs. I also used less water and more pecans. I added about 1 tbsp fresh italian parsley and fresh chopped rosemary to the celery and onions. I also used 1 additional stalk of celery. Really yummy...a bit hit at my Thanksgiving dinner two years in a row.

Don't bother. But, if you are like me and dinner is in a few hours, here is what you could do to possibly salvage this bland, lifeless stuffing. I threw in some dried apricots, chopped apple, added poultry seasoning to give it more flavor, and plan to add a little chicken stock and/or egg and bake this about 20 minutes. This is all in hopes of not being quite so embarrased serving this mush. Don't waste your time.

EXCELLENT recipe - this will be my fifth year making it (Thanksgiving Dinner this Sunday). My family and friends beg for the recipe each year :0)

Wasn't all that impressed. I a surprised by all of the great reviews. Caused me to think that perhaps I did something wrong. I followed recipe exactly. It was too dry for my taste...bread cubes too separated. I like my stuffing more congealed (for lack of a better description). Flavor was satisfactory, however.

This was a wonderful stuffing. I am not usually a stuffing/dressing lover at Thanksgiving, but this recipe has turned me around! I made it exactly as written and found it to be lovely. Guests and family raved as well.

Everyone loved the dish. I had to give it to the entire guest list. I think this dish is going to be made a lot over the holidays!

This stuffing has the most wonderful aroma! I adapted it for a vegan guest by substituting olive oil for the butter. The dish was a hit with everyone.

Tried this recipe with roast Chicken, and it was a big hit. So big, I have now been delegated the making of the stuffing for the family thanksgiving:) I put in one more stalk of celery than called for, also poured in the extra sherry as suggested below, and next time will add more than 1 cup of pecans. yummy all-around - and what doesn't taste good with a bit of sherry?:)

I loved this dish. It's easy to prepare and very moist and light. I used dried cranberries, and everyone loved it. I used store brand bread cubes and it tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner at my in-laws'. The ingredients were cheap, the preparation was easy, and it really soaked up the turkey juices and the gravy really well. Everyone raved about it--more than they have for more difficult recipes in the past!

Excellent - have been asked for the recipe - will make it a little more moist next time. Used raisins instead of currants. Toasted the pecans in the "heavy large skillet" just before sauteing the vegetables. I used the sherry that wasn't used up in plumping the raisins as part of the 2 cups of water. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the recipe, but must confess I made it using dried cranberries (can't find currants locally) and cubed, toasted, day-old French bread. I can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving!

Seeing that stuffing is the main ingredient, perhaps I used the wrong stuffing. I couldn't find Kellog's Croquette's (which I heard is quite good), so instead I bought Pepperidge Farms. Ugg. My dogs didn't seem to mind eating this.

We made this recipe during our Thanksgiving celebration. We had 25 people attend our dinner (many from around the world) and everyone asked for the recipe. I consider that to be the highest compliment for any cook.
