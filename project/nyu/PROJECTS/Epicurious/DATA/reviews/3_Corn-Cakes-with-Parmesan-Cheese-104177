not sure why everyone says this was bland. i thought it was delicious - i used a bit more cheese, doubled the green onions, and added a few tablespoons melted butter to the buttermilk mixture. i also used fresh corn kernels that had been boiled for a few minutes.this was great with green jalapeno salsa and/or sour cream.

I used canned corn and I also omitted the cheese. By itself is wasn't spectacular (again, no cheese), but it went great with chili!

Instead of frozen, I used a whole can of sweet white corn (drained). I found this didn't make the batter too thin, and gave the cakes a little more crunch.

This was delicious, and liked by all the family. I made it with fresh corn cut from the cob and microwaved in a little water for four minutes. the recipe is plentiful, and easily could have served six, maybe eight.

I've never tried corncakes before, but I have to be honest that these corncakes were horrible. The batter was far too liquid and hardly any taste to them. Not enough salt and very bland. I used a cup of Green Giant{brand} peaches and cream style corn. That gave it a sweet kick but I would not make them again. Don't be surprise if the batter is really liquid. Use freshly grated parmesan cheese otherwise they'll have very little taste.

Have used many, many recipes from gourmet/bon appetit and have found the reviews where people experiment a bit to be helpful. For this particular recipe, I used one large leek and fresh sugar corn instead of scallions and frozen corn, both of which made all the difference. Not a stellar dish, but a good work night one.

Somewhat bland and nothing special in my book. Kids may love it.
