Be careful the dough is not punctured, what a mess you'll have.

This recipe was exactly what I expected--a great blend of rustic and sophistication. I took previous reviewers' advice and added a bit more more fruit (a handful of cherries, since I only had 6 plums). Added a cinnamon stick to the sauce, too. Other than that, followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out perfectly. Not too sweet, either.

Amazing! The simplicity and the Port make it very appealing. I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe was delicious, easy to make and made the most of in-season plums. We found it unnecssary to pur the extra sytrup over the pie, as it was saucy enough - but it was the right amount for a second pie, especially since the ready- made pie crust comes with two sheets.

This was an amazingly easy and delicious plum tart. I was worried about using a pre-made crust, but it came out wonderfully. Make sure to drizzle with the remaining syrup. The port flavor imparted to the plums cannot be underestimated!

My husband thought it was too sugary but I liked it. I would not have been able to eat it without the vanilla ice cream. I thought the recipe could have been more specific and detailed, I had a hard time getting the liquid to become syrupy and then it almost burned. Since plums are small I would add about 4 more than the recipe called for. It's probably best as a winter dessert but I don't think plums are in season then. I made mine in a glass pie pan because it was small. I agree other stone fruit added to it would be great.

I really wanted to make this recipe, but after sending my DH to 3 different stores, he arrived home with no plums. Obviously, they are out of season. I had already made my port syrup, so had to improvise. I had some frozen peaches and blueberries in the freezer, and some fresh bing cherries. I just mixed them together and increased the flour a bit, tossed with the syrup and put it in the crust. I then topped with a strusel topping. It was delicious!!!! My DH wants it again. Can't wait to try it with plums once they come into season. Reviewers, please don't be mad because I rated this not based on the original recipe. I think the big key to this is the reduced port syrup...it's a real winner and it core to this dessert. Try it!
