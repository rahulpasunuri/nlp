WOW! that was my reaction on the first bite. I usually don't grill chicken because it never turns out the way I like. However, followed this recipe and reviewed the gas cooking instructions and this turned out delicious!!! I will be making this again. I used dry herbs with the following modifications; 2tbsp basil, 1 1/4 tsp rosemary, 1 bay leaf, 1 large garlic, used veg oil with the same amount on recipe. I placed the chicken in a plastic bag and mixed with the herbs and allowed to marinate while the grill was getting hot so about 10-15 minutes. I placed the chicken pieces skin down on the off burner to sear for 3 minutes, then flipped and closed the lid for about 20 minutes. The chicken breast were thick so I added another 10 minutes of cooking and they were done. The chicken skin was crisp and golden the herbs didn't burn and the entire chicken was juicy and could taste the herbs through out the skin and meat. This is an easy recipe to prepare and quick so a winner for entertaining.

Made this with cornish hens, the first time for company, and tonight just for the two of us.....only one word to describe it... DIVINE!!! We grilled both times and it was perfection.

I opted out on the grill and based on some of the other comments I also decided to use my oven with an excellent result. First the normal oven for about 20-25 min. and then I used the grill (most likely the same as your broiler) for about 10 min! The result was delicious. As there were not any (as far as I could tell) ideas for what to serve with the poussins - I decided to boil some new potatoes and made a marinade for them consisting of chopped garlic, a bit of lime, some wide leafed parsley and some olive oil, salt and pepper and also with a side green salads with a dressing of olive oil, balsamico, lime, garlic and salt and pepper. Great colors together on the plate and absolutely delicious! And my first recipe with Epicurious...so I can assure you - I will be back for more :-) Bon appetit!!

This a great alternative to oven-roasted hens. Who wants to be in the kitchen when the patio beckons? Followed the recipe exactly and used our gas BBQ, with hens over the un-lit burner for in-direct heat.

The seasonings come together for an exceptionally savory flavor. I made these in the oven rather than the grill as its winter and it was very easy and turned out great.

Delicious and very easy! Used fresh herbs except used 1 big bay leaf. Used small bowl of food processor instead of blender (worked wonderfully). I made 9 Cornish hens so I couldn't make them all on the grill. I grilled the hens to brown them only. Then I finished them by baking them in a 350 degree oven for about another 25-30 minutes. It probably would have been done sooner if I didn't have so many hens to bake. In addition, my hens were larger than 1 1/4 pounds each, so that slowed the cooking time as well.

Excellent and easy. I let marinade for about an hour before grilling and was delicious. The salt does sound like a lot but it works! I used all fresh herbs except bay. I substituted 1 dried bay leaf for the 2 fresh.

Excellent...super easy to make yet very elegant.

The salt may seem like a lot, but results were not at all salty. Used a mini-chopper instead of a blender for the herbs. Worked great on the grill, even gas. Just turn off the other half and keep the birds on that side with the lids closed. In-laws like to eat with fingers (Chinese). Perfect!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Didn't use bay leaf as I didn't have any. Added just a touch of lemon juice for more luquid. Let the chicken marinade in fridge for about 2 hours prior to grilling. Great marinade!

This is very easy and a great alternative to traditional BBQ'd chicken. We used cornish hens which turned out great on the grill but I will use the herb rub for all kinds of poultry. Everyone should try this.

Everyone LOVED this chicken. I used boneless chicken breast with the skin on. The herb combo of flavors was so savory and perfectly balanced. The meat was juicy. The prep was easy. What more can you ask for? Gourmet recm'd a Spy Valley sav blanc for this dish. I thought it was too light. Next time I will choose a wine with more backbone for this flavorful dish.

Had chicken leg quarters in the fridge, so used those and it turned out to be a fabulous summer dinner. Served grilled leeks alonside with rice pilaf; my husband asked that this be put on permanent rotation.
