I've used this recipe at least a dozen times now. It is excellent!!! My mother used to use canned sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top and I got to the place where I wouldn't even bother to put any on my plate. These are a hugely different story. I could eat these every day! Use the recipe as written (although egg beaters work fine for the eggs). I use a high quality vanilla, fresh lemon juice and fresh butter.

This is very popular with everyone in my family every time I make it. I actually got my extended family to give up canned sweet potato and marshmallows for the holidays in favor of this. I make some changes though: Unless you want this to be a pseudo dessert cut back on the maple syrup and/or brown sugar. The recipe as stated is ridiculously sweet and while the family seems to enjoy it, I find it completely out of balance. I also add more pecans to increase texture. I read a comment regarding the recipe being too "eggy" which I haven't ever heard from anyone I've served this to. Seems that if one is sensitive to that flavor or texture it would be a quick and simple fix to omit an egg.

Rating: 2
We didn't really like this recipe. We found it was very eggy and didn't really taste like sweet potatoes. We could have just made it wrong though. I would recommend making the "Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Banana and Brown Sugar" though (recipe on epicurious). THAT was delicious!

This was my first time preparing sweet potatoes. This recipe was easy and I was able to make it ahead of time and warm it in the oven just before serving. It was a big hit at my international Thanksgiving. Many of my European friends had never had sweet potatoes before, and they loved it! I will be making this a permanent fixture in my Thanksgiving line up.

This recipe is amazing! I did a trial run on the recipe a week before Turkey Day and the only change was that I added 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (I like a little sweetness but not too sweet). I also baked my yams instead of boiling (350 degrees for 1 hour 20 minutes; my yams were large). I made it for 15 people and the dish was empty by the end of dinner. You have to try this.

I also make ahead (EACH YEAR!) a day in advance (might try for 2 days this time based on suggestion). I refrigerate the covered casserole dish, and separately store the topping in a baggie -- then load it on just before putting in the oven. Just allow a little extra time due to the colder temp. Our annual must-have dish for the traditional feast!

Rating: 4
YES YOU CAN MAKE THIS IN ADVANCE. I do it every year. I have made it up to two days early and it reheats beautifully. I also double up on the pecans in part because I LOVE them but also because I think twice as much nutty crunch helps balance the sweetness of the dish.

HELP!! I want to make this dish to take to a Thanksgiving potluck with friends, however, my problem is that the only way I can do this is to make it at home, a day ahead of time, and reheat it after we have traveled to our destination. Can anyone offer any experiences making this ahead of time and reheating? Does it diminish the taste or texture?

I baked LARGE red-skinned yams in the oven. I found this to be quicker than boiling. I washed, cleaned, and dried them. Lightly drizzled olive oil all over them placed them on baking sheet and baked at 350 for 1 hr 20 minutes. Removed them from oven,let cool for 20 minutes & placed in K.A. Mixer w/paddle attachment along with the rest of the ingredients and mixed until desired texture. I then poured into buttered glass dish and baked. They were done in 55 minutes. DELICIOUS!

This recipe is so yummy! I made it as a trial run for thanksgiving and I am so gland I did. I cut the recipe in half, everything the same as recipe stated with the exception to adding 1-tsp O.J. The top was golden & nutty and oh so delicious. The filling is a meld of all the flavors but finishes with a true yam taste. The next time I make it I plan to add 1/4 brown sugar to filling (I like it a little sweeter). Many viewers stated it was too sweet, I did not think so. It is a perfect combination of flavors.

I give this recipe 4 forks, but only because I made some adjustments due to it being too sweet. I cut the brown sugar in half, used 2 eggs instead of four, used 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, used less than a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and used 1.5 tablespoons of lemons. The changes got rave reviews from the family.

This is the ONLY sweet potato recipe that has been allowed at our T-day table since it was first published in 1998. Coming from a family that never served a sweet potato side, this is a big deal. It is a perfect sweet addition to all of the savory sides at Thanksgiving, but not too cloyingly sweet that it overwhelms. After reading the comments, I may try the bourbon substitution for vanilla, and increasing the topping, but it is great as written too.

Here is is, Thanksgiving once again and time to get out the brown sugar and food processor. This recipe has been an annual tradition for several years now. I cut back on the eggs and butter some, but otherwise just make sure the oven is hot enough towards the end of the baking so that the nuts are nice and toasted on top. Enjoy the holiday everyone!

I have made this recipe every year for the last 10 years. Every year I get rave reviews. This year I made it for a thanksgiving party in my daughter's class and I had 10 mom's asking for the recipe. I do make a few very minor changes. I use as little butter as possible (1-2 tbsp) and you can't tell the difference. This year I left off the nuts since there is a ban for nuts at school. The kids loved it!

Heavenly! Melts in your mouth! This was the star of the Thanksgiving table this year (and everything was wonderful - thanks epicurious!). The only change I made was adding another 1/4 cup of pecans and an additional Tbsp of butter for the topping. Next time, I will add 1/2 cup of pecans and 2 Tbsp of butter to the topping, but I have no complaints. This was amazing. It will be on my Thanksgiving table every year from now on.

This dish was AMAZING! I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner in absentia (all of my company was British), but everyone was in LOVE with this! I halved the recipe for a party of six, but it was gone halfway through the meal. It's definitely on the sweet side, but it's worth it with such a heavenly, crunchy topping. Next time I'll double the topping and substitute pumpkin for some of the sweet potatoes. I can't wait!

This was absolutely delicious! I skipped the lemon and pecans just because I didn't have them. There whole thing was gone midway through dinner and people wanted more. I didn't have a processor so I used a soup hand mixer to mash the potatoes. I added a little water and about 2 Tblsp of orange juice to make mashing easier.

This is an excellent recipe. I've enjoyed it a number of times, but be prepared for it to be quite sweet. Not cloyingly by any means but definitely on the sweet side. A couple of additions that I've made that I've been very happy with. I substitute 2 tablespoons of bourbon for one of the Tbls of vanilla and I finish the dish under the broiler for a couple mins (although you have to watch it closely or the nuts will burn) to get a nice crust. Otherwise this is great. Enjoy!!

I have made this quite a few times over the past 10 years! It is good but sweet. This year I used half pumpkin and half sweet potatoes I also used have the sugar/maple syrup in the dish and halved the dish overall. It was very good and not so sweet! It was very popular with the non-americans I feed!

This was great! It is very sweet, but a good balance if most other dishes are savory. I doubled the topping as well, so it would be extra sweet. I ran out of maple syrup and substituted a generic 'light' syrup, and it still turned out delicious.

Delicious. Can eliminate pecans for those who are allergic. Added marshmallows on top. Rave reviews from my guests!

My family enjoyed this on Thanksgiving. Given that so many Thanksgiving dishes can be rich and loaded with hidden calories, I liked that the base didn't have added butter or cream. They were fluffy and smooth, but not syrupy or fatty. The topping was a bit sweet. Next time, I'll add flour to the topping. Excellent for a holiday meal, but I'm not sure if I'll make it for a regular dinner because it seems distinctly holiday-ish.

Rating: 4
I whipped up this recipe every season since it came out in the Nov. issue of Bon Appetit. It's a family favorite and likely to be part of Thanksgiving dinners for generations to come. Additionally, you can make it ahead of time--but guard it close lest it's eaten before the holiday.

I made this as a side dish for Easter to go along with a gigantic ham and some roasted asparagus. It was an easy recipe to make, I made no changes at all...and personally LOVED it. It IS definitely a "sweet" dish, and went over fabulously with the kids in our family! If you're looking for something sweet to compliment a traditional Easter baked ham...this works perfectly. And this works well in place of dessert, too!

I used unrefined white sugar as didn't have brown. No maple syrup either. No salt by choice. It's amazing! Reading the reviews, I was quite confused about whether this was a savoury or dessert with all that sweet stuff. Well, after eating it, I'm not sure either! I'd both have it for dinner and dessert. Magnificent. Yum. I only had 1 lb of potatoes so I made 3 small individual terracota ramekins and brushed with olive oil instead of butter. It's great. Try it.

I made this for the first time in 1998 when the recipe was printed. I don't change a thing. The subtle taste of the vanilla and the maple give a pleasing, rounded sensation and balance the egg which gives a wonderful richness. The lemon juice cuts the sweetness, making it perfect! NO need to modify this one...

I made this twice within 2 days, once for my mother's work Thanksgiving potluck, and once for our thanksgiving. The changes I made (and I've made this for holidays for years) the second time around were noticeable and made the casserole better. I used my mixer to blend the cooked sweet potatoes with the eggs, syrup, vanilla, lemon juice, salt, *and brown sugar*. I sprinkled more brown sugar and the pecans over the top after placing the concoction in the casserole dish. Somehow this dish kicks off the holiday season for my family.

The topping makes this recipe. I even caught my sweet- potato-loathing husband sneaking a bite when he thought I wasn't looking. I halved the recipe but the lemon gave its life for the martinis so I used bourbon in place of the lemon juice. Great flavor with the perfect amount of crunch and sweetness on top.

I have been making this dish for years, and we love it. Here's a tip - unless you don't mind pureeing the sweet potatoes in four or five batches, whip them all at once in a mixer. It makes this go a lot faster and personally, I think it gives the potatoes a better consistency.

I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 glass pan. I made the filling 2 nights before serving, refrigerated, and added the topping right before putting in the oven. YUM. It's almost like dessert to this Northerner, but I guess sweet potato casseroles are meant to be on the sweet side.

We thought this was delicious and did not think it was salty at all! I did use 5 pounds of sweet potatoes and baked them on Tuesday, assembled and baked casserole on Wednesday and just reheated this afternoon - EVERYONE loved it, including the kids (all under 6). It makes a ton, though - there were 11 of us and we ate a third of it at most, so be prepared. Baking the sweet potatoes was definitely the ticket - took no time, and I peeled them and put them in a ziplock so all I had to do at crunch time was put it together. I did double the topping which made too much but I can see how one recipe of topping would be too little, and did cut the vanilla down to 1 tablespoon plus a splash extra. The topping was very sweet but the potatoes were not too sweet so it was a nice combo. A keeper!

Rating: 1
I lost my old recipe for sweet potatoe casserole so I made this one today. What a mistake. It's way too salty, I didn't even add 2 tsp. of salt like the recipe called for. I only added 1 1/4 and it was too much. The vanilla is too over powering and it's just all wrong. I will never make a new recipe for company again. I have no time to make another one so I'll just have to let everyone know that this is a flop! I added about 3/4 cup pumpkin to the filling to try and make it less salty. It did do this, but you can taste the pumpkin which is no good.

Rating: 4
I highly recommend reducing the vanilla to 1 Tbsp and adding 1/4 tsp chili powder to the sweet potatoes. The chili powder adds just a little complexity of flavor without spiciness. Happy Thanksgiving!

The same thing happens every year. My father makes Thanksgiving dinner for the whole family and about a week before, calls me up and says "you're making the sweet potatoes again, right"? Since tomorrow is Thanksgiving, I'm getting out the recipe and getting ready to start peeling. Even with a few complainers in the family, NO ONE has anything but compliments for this.

Rating: 4
Loved this! Similar versions are typically too sweet, focusing more on the topping than the sweet potato/yams, and would be better off as a dessert. This recipe has just the right balance! I even used walnuts (since I discovered I didn't have any pecans), and I know this would be even better with pecans! Served this with pork and cranberry sauce, and it was a perfect fall dish!

I have made this dish on Thanksgiving for the last 6 years. Even sweet potato haters love this one. I have tasted knock-offs of this recipe and they are usually too sweet. Instead of a 9 x 13 pan I prepare this recipe in a deep baking dish and there is no need to double the topping and the amount of topping is perfect. Also, the amount of vanilla is just right if you use a good quality vanilla extract.

Wonderful recipe and served to rave reviews. Next time I'll cut the vanilla in half (did this time, too -- it's a must), but I'd also double the pecans and butter without doubling the sugar -- it's just too sweet. Cardamom was a nice addition. Pureed through a food mill based on personal preference (I hate washing my Cuisinart), but I'm sure the food processor would have been fine.

Use yams (not sweet potatoes), cut the vanilla in half and double the topping! Very easy to make, these only took about 35 minutes to bubble, then we let them rest and re-cooked for 25 minutes at 350 until they bubbled again. Primary comments from guests were "this is fantastic" and "this is more like dessert than a side-dish". It's yum!!

Rave reviews. Not a crumb left. Definitely bake the potatoes. It saves time because you can do other things while they're baking and not perform the tedious tasks of peeling and chopping. I might use 3/4 C. brown sugar next time as the dish was sweeter than I expected but delicious nonetheless.

A real crowd pleaser. I too used half the vanilla and will decrease the amount by a quarter again next time I make it. Everyone loved, loved this recipe but they also said it was like a dessert.

Oh, my Jesus!!!! This was unbelieveable. My wife made it, she gets all the credit. I just ate it. And ate it. It was sublime.

Question for the reviewers: How is this supposed to set-up after baking, very firm?? I thought 4 eggs would bind it enough, but the potatoes never seemed firm at all. Maybe adding another yolk?? Please advise. However, rated as No. 1 dish last Thanksgiving by the family and will make again this year.

I made this dish for our house warming party and it was very simple to make. I doubled the toppings and added an extra tablespoon of maple syrup to the potatoes. I boiled the sweet pototoes a day in advance and assembled and baked all the ingredients the morning of the party. A half hour before dinner, I popped it in the oven to warm for 15 minutes until it started to bubble. It was a huge hit!

All I can say is that if you make this expect to be asked to make it over and over..and over again!!! It's just wonderful!

Had 20 guests for Thanksgiving - every single one loved this! "Better than Grandma's..." was the ultimate compliment. Doubled the topping as suggested. YUM!

We've made this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past three years. It's one of those items that is consistently requested by adults and childern alike.

I made these potatos for Thanksgiving 2002 and it was incredibly popular - the hosts insisted on keeping the little that was left over. I doubled the amount of topping because it seemed a little sparse.

I also made this dish for Thanksgiving and was very happy with the result. I listened to the other reviewers and doubled the topping. Very good idea!!! Will make this again hopefully before the next Thanksgiving...1 year seems so long to wait on this great dish...

Yum. I've tried so many savory sweet potato recipes that didn't work. Just make them sweet and people love em. The only thing I would do differently would be to cut the vanilla amount in half-2 tablespoons was overpowering. Still everyone loved it and I'm doing it for Christmas as well.

I have made this the past two Thanksgivings to rave reviews. I don't even like sweet potatoes, but this one is really good. Make sure you have enough sweet potatoes in the recipe - I think I was short by a bit this time and the vanilla was overpowering.

Have used this recipe several times. Even those who do not care for sweet potatoes like this. I would like to say that if you like the recipe can be made with canned yams. Just start with two large cans (each about 2 lbs) and go from there. Delish!, no appreciable difference. Make ahead, and cover with foil in refrigerator overnight, back wee bit longer to accomodate coldness. I love recipes that can be made the day ahead. A real keeper

I am not a sweet potato fan, but this recipe is THE BEST! I divided it among 8 orange cups (hollowed out orange halves with all pulp and membrane removed) and then baked it. People went wild!

I've been making this recipe since 1998 and it has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas favorite. I'll make it tomorrow afternoon and the baking dish will be empty by tomorrow evening. Oh yes....double the topping!!

Made this in 1998 when it first appeared in the magazine. It became a family tradition immediately. Now I pass the recipe on to friends. Great Thanksgiving dish !

I'm not known as kitchen-friendly, but my family sang a different tune after tasting this dish I brought for Thanksgiving dinner. I'm not even a sweet potato fan, but this was great!

This recipe solidified my reputation as being the 'culinary queen' with friends. I doubled the pecans (2 oz. didn't look like enough) and the butter (what the heck) but kept the brown sugar at 1 cup. Cooked for about 50 minutes, brought it to the party, sat for an hour, then reheated and it was delicious. A non sweet potato eater had to taste to see what the fuss was all about and is now a convert. Happy cooking!

I made this for Christmas Dinner. There were 3 adults and 4 children. My mom and I were the only two that would eat it. All the children refused to eat any. Next year I'll only make half the recipe for my mom and I or the whole recipe if I take it to a party. Very yummy. I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them and also recommend making double the topping.

Took it to Thanksgiving dinner this year and everyone loved it. I also baked the sweet potatoes in foil for an hour at 400,instead of peeling and boiling, as a previous reviewer did, and it was super simple to prepare. Enjoy!

a different approach to serving sweet potatoes

Absolutely fantastic! This is an easy, do-ahead dish with great texture (use processor for a silky smooth consistency) and flavor (topping is yummy). I think this will become by standard sweet potato dish!

Big hit at Christmas dinner. I added a little more lemon juice,plus a few squeezes of orange juice. DOUBLE the pecans! Everyone loved it-even the eight year old wanted more of the "orange stuff."

This is a terrific improvement on the traditional sweet potatoe dish at Thanksgiving. I would be tempted to make this year round!

Excellent and so easy. This was a big hit with the Christmas dinner. Even the "sweet-potato-haters" had to give it a try after hearing everyone rave about it. I'll hand-mash instead of puree the potatoes next time. Would prefer more texture than the puree offers.

For the second Thanksgiving in a row, my family loved this dish. Definitely double the topping.

Fabulous!! I've been preparing my sweet potatoes this way for the past four years and I never have leftovers!! I'm going to double the yopping this year. As a matter of fact, the potatoes are boiling right now! Happy Turkey Day.

Yummy!! My brother-in-law who is a fantastic pastry chef said "put a crust on this, and it's dessert"! Everyone went back for third helpings on this one. Simple to make, it's a new family favoite.

I have made this recipe for the holidays the last couple years and it is always a hit. I use a hand mixer to puree the potatoes and the dish has always turned out great. When I had two family parties to go to, I split the mixture into two 9x9 glass pans instead and baked at the same temperature and duration. The result was just as good!

A big hit every time. I have copies of this recipe ready to give to guests. I also double the topping.

I have made this every year on Thanksgiving for both sides of my family since it first appeared. My father in law (who isn't known for giving compliments) LOVES this and asks me to bring it for Christmas, too. Definately a keeper!

I absolutely love this recipe! I am not the marshmallow-on-my-yams type, so this is a great recipe to use instead. I used a hand blender to whip the yams, and it worked beautifully. I more than doubled the topping so that the entire top was smothered in pecans and brown sugar, and it was the only dish practically licked clean at the end of the Thanksgiving day! I will definitely make it again this year!

Rating: 4
This is an fantastic sweet potato recipe for people who think they don't like sweet potatoes--and for people who DO like them, but are so sick of that marshmallow topped concocction that you see at so many Thanksgiving tables. Be prepared, though--have some printed copies of the recipe, because someone is sure to ask! It's fabulous!

Rating: 4
I've made this dish for the past three Thanksgiving's with great results. To save time, you can make it one day earlier and refrigerate (without the topping), then bring to room temperature, add topping and bake the next day. Also, I tried whipping the potatoes instead of using a food processor and came out perfect as well.

Rating: 4
Delicious! It isn't as sweet as your typical sweet potato casserole. Very easy, and as the other reviewers note, very good as a cold dessert with a dollop of whipped topping. I'd like to add that I didn't have a food processor so the potatoes weren't as pureed as I'd have liked. But it was still very good.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish several times. I always get great compliments. I add more topping for more of a dessert item. It's great leftover cold.

Rating: 3
The taste is excellent and it is quite healthy compared with other similar recipes. I would make this dish again, but I would use a smaller, deeper dish. My preference would be to have more potato/less topping per bite. Also, I baked the potatoes and skinned them when they were cool (I just find it less work), and it came out great.

Rating: 4
Everyone loved it the first time I made it but we were a small group and I kept the leftovers in the fridge. The next day, some of us had it cold and it was the most amazing dessert! Since then I have served it cold in wine glasses as an elegant dessert.

You can get the exact same sweet potatoes at Danny's Steak and Pasta Grill, in Red Bank. The chef from Olde Union House stole the whole menu and brought it to Danny's.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious! Have made it over and over again...Everyone wants the recipe.

Great sweet potato recipe. The only tip I have to give is put in a very large dish to bake. The topping bubbles when cooking and can easily overflow and burn. Trust me.. It took an hour to get the smoke out of the house.. But everyone loved it..

Rating: 4
These were the best sweet potatoes I think I've ever had. I made a half batch for 6 people but kept the same amount of topping as called for. Wonderful! The only change I would make next time would be to bake it in a deeper casserole. I think it would be slightly moister then. Do you think you could prepare the sweet potato mixture with the eggs in advance and then add the topping right before baking?

Rating: 3
Wonderful! I made a trial run at home a couple of weeks before taking it as my contribution to the family xmas dinner. Found the topping to be just a little sweet, so next time increased the pecans and butter without increasing the brown sugar. They loved it!!

I made this for Christmas (with a doubled topping, though I might decrease the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time). It was a huge hit, everyone was asking for the recipe! It reheated okay, definately better fresh from the oven though.

I've never had sweet potato anything before, but my b/f insisted that it was an essential part of a traditional, American holiday meal, so sweet potatoes we had to have! Thank you epicurious.com -- this is an easy, tasty, no-fail recipe. You could serve it for dessert!!

This recipe is destined to become standard holiday fare in our family. We've made this for the past 2 years in a row, and everyone loves it. I added an extra 1/2 or so to the topping, & made it more of a dessert. It's great the day after, served cold with a dollop of whipped cream.

I used this recipe hoping to duplicate something I had had once before, and it was even better than I remembered. Served it for Thanksgiving (doubled the topping) and everyone wanted to make sure they got leftovers in their doggie bags! Delicious!!

I don't like sweet potatoes either, especially the ones with all the marshmallows, yuck. But this was really luscious. Not too sweet. Potatoes were light and fluffy and the vanilla gave them just the right touch. I made them the night before and they heated up just great. This will become a Thanksgiving tradition!

Decided to test this recipe to see if it should be added to the Thanksgiving menu and the result was a definite YES. This was delicious. Doubled the topping as suggested by previous reviewers and put in just a pinch of salt and some freshly ground pepper. Outstanding!

An excellent dish for the holidays. I brought it to our neighbours for Thanksgiving dinner and he ate almost half of it himself! My changes to the recipe were the following. I used more pecans, a but more butter and less brown sugar for the topping, a bit less than 3/4 of a cup of sugar was more than enough. I used only 1 tbsp. maple syrup and 1 tbsp. vanilla and added pinches of ginger and cinnamon.

This beats the usual Sweet Potato Puff! My 12 holiday guests loved it!!! Definitely double the topping, you'll be glad you did.

Sensational!! The flavours in this dish are incredible! Both times I have made this I have received many compliments. The 2nd time I made it I added the seeds from a vanilla bean into the mashed sweet potato which intensified the vanilla flavour a little. I know this one will stay in my recipe file forever - it's delicious!

this went over well, however, i would not use as much as salt as suggested...the potatos were salty. i doubled the topping, which i definitely will do again next time and will use cinnamon. yummy dish overall.

A wonderful alternative to sweet potato casserole. The topping really makes this recipe. A great dish to make a day early. Don't sprinkle the topping on the yams until you are ready to bake it though.

Rating: 3
This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I cut it in half to accomodate a smalller crowd, but I should have made the whole thing, cuz everyone had seconds, some had thirds!!! It is just the right sweetness and really let the yams tastiness come thru. This is will become one of my Holiday dinner menu stables!

I thought these were very good, but not that different from other recipes for sweet potatoes that I've made in the past. I didn't think they were as exciting as some of the other reviewers did.

YUMMY! The only thing I would change is the salt I am going to substitute sugar for the salt in the water and add only 1 tsp salt in the main recipe I could taste the salt in the sweet potatoes-although no one else could.(I knew how much was in there) Otherwise this is a keeper! You could add a little cinnamon in the topping if you like cinnamon in your sweet potatoes.

WOW!!! This was so good I wanted it all for myself. Talk about "pig-out"! I put the potatoes in a glass dish to preserve every ounce of flavor when baking, then proceded. What a wonderful look and taste!

I agree this one is a keeper! Better than your usual yams with marshmallows. Easy to make too!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving 1998 and it was the biggest hit of the dinner. The kids fought over the left-overs and asked to have it again for Christmas dinner. It's almost a cross between a side dish and dessert -- delicious, easy, and attractive to serve. This one is a keeper!
