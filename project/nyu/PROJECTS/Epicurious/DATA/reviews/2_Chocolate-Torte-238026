I attempted this again with plain prunes and chai instead of coffee. It still tastes like non-alcoholic plum pudding. Next time I will substitute applesauce, pumpkin puree, or cannellini bean puree for the prunes, adjusting the liquid as necessary. Not quite ready for public consumption yet as a "chocolate torte"...

I used cherry-flavored prunes and Van Houten Dutch cocoa. This is more of a British-style sticky plum pudding. It won't satisfy a chocolate craving, but I would make it again and serve it to my in-laws (they aren't big on chocolate and can't have cholesterol). Next time I will soak regular prunes in chai instead of coffee. The serving size, if correct, is very generous, and the topping hides the mottled appearance. Are you sold yet? My husband wasn't.
