These were super! The taste wasn't very overt- just a hint of fried goodness. Beautiful presentation, and hard to screw up. I didn't use a thermometer- just guessed at the temperature. It took less than 20 seconds for the noodles to rise to the top. Any longer than 10, and the noodles started to get brown. Works well with ice cream, or would be interesting in napoleons.
