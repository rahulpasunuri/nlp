I made this over the Thanksgiving holiday - I thought the red pepper came out a little mushy. I could have saved time and used jarred fire roasted peppers. I thought the dressing lacked a little pizaz for me.. maybe should have kicked in a little more garlic and maybe some minced onion. If I make this again I will use jarred peppers to save me time. It makes for a nice looking presentation but thought about putting all of it in a salad bowl and using a slotted spoon rather then thread each olive etc.

These are great! For an interesting presentation to add height to a cocktail party buffet, I used long bamboo skewers instead of toothpicks and stuck them into a round peasant bread. Easy to pick up, pretty to look at, delicious to eat.

Great, easy appetizer for a crowd. I will admit to "cheating", though, because I used the marinated mozzarella balls that you can get in a big tub at Costco. I prefer charring the peppers over my gas cooktop to broiling them. They're not as mushy that way. I could have made twice as much and they would have disappeared just as fast!

This is a perfect appetizer for those on the Atkin's plan. Really excellent flavor, nice presentation, and will impress company. Can't go wrong with this combo, plus it's pretty easy. No complaints.
