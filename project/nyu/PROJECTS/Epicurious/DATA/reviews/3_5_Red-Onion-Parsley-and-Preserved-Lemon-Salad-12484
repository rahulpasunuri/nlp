When I read a recipe, I have a good sense as to how the flavors will meld and how the recipe will work and taste. I had my doubts aout this one but decided to make it. The result was red onion with a salty, lemon "dressing" that tasted like red onion drenched in salty lemon. There are way better ways to use preserved lemon. It was so dry and lacking of liquid I added more olive oil. It had no flavor. I added some additional dried herbs -- an "Italian blend". That helped just a touch. Save your preserved lemon. Don't make this recipe.

I was surprised at how delicious this was given the limited ingredients and easy preparation. The lemon completely mellowed out the onions. I added a can of drained chickpeas for a more robust protein-filled salad --- a nice complement.

Given the choice 'salty or sweet,' I would choose the former, except for this recipe. Ugh! My tongue and cheeks are preserved after eating this salad. However, with some modifications, this recipe can be salvaged because the flavors are great. Do not use the juice from the preserved lemons. Use fresh lemon juice and a bit of olive oil instead and you won't be overly salted. Also, I would have prefered the lemon peel to be minced so the flavor was more evenly distributed.

maybe i did something wrong when i preserved my lemons (i used a different recipe for that, and they've been marinating for over a month) but i didn't think this was nearly as amazing as the other reviewers claimed. it was ok, mostly just marinated onions and not much else.

This salad is delicious! I am always looking for new ways to use the preserved lemons I love to make and give as gifts. One of my guests was worried about the onions and only wanted a spoonful. Needless to say, she immediately asked for more after the first bite.

My friend first introduced me to this recipe. It is amazingly refreshing. Goes well with almost any meal, especially fish, and makes a great snack with cottage cheese. I have started making this regularly.

I get rave reviews every time I use the preserved lemons. They do last about six months and are worth the effort of "preserving." This salad is exceptional, but use the lemons with other dishes that call for regular lemon.
