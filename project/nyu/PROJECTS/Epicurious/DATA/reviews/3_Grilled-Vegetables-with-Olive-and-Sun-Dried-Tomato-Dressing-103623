I'm sorry for the immature review of ICK!! But, both of us (who LOVE food of all kinds and flavors of all sorts) hated this. We ate our grilled chicken and drank the beautiful wine and threw the veggies down the drain. They are pretty, the sundried toms and olives are a good start, but somewhere in the citrus it is all wrong.....

I use a large variety of vegetables when grilling. Presentation is key in this recipe. Lay all the vegetables out nicely and drizzle dressing artistically and everyone will rave.

Wasn't too fond of this recipe. I love grilled vegetables, but I thought this dressing was a bit overpowering.

Had tried a similar dish in a Vegetarian Café so when I found this recipe I had to try it. I think the eggs could be left out though, they seemed superfluous to me.

Wonderful - I did not have the olives on hand and made it without. It was still delicoius!
