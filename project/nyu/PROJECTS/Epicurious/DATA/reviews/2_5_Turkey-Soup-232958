I just started my soup. Followed the directions with a few variations, it's about the way I normally start my soup (I usually make without a recipe). I don't know about the rest of the reviewers but I rarely have seen a recipe that I didn't have to alter to my taste. I substituted poultry seasoning (combination of: Majoram, Tyme, Coriander, Salt, Rosemary and Sage), doubled the quantity in the recipe. I also added a few bay leaves. I'm also going to add potatoes instead of noodles, makes for a heartier soup that's more of a meal. I also simmer for 1 1/2 hrs then remove, strain, add my veggies and continue cooking for 1 1/2 hrs. I prefer to let the veggies cook while the soup is simmering, adds flavor. I also have chicken bouillon on hand just in case it needs a boost.

I have made this several times and have had excellent results. The key to a good turkey soup is the stock and this accomplishes it. I add my seasonings at the end when I am adding my vegetables and meat and noodles.

This was a complete waste of time and ingredients. I followed the directions carefully and it turned out so bland it was like dish water.

This is ridiculous to call this a recipe when you in fact need to add tons more herbs and spices to have any flavor. I ended up combining this with another recipe to make a decent soup.

Well, I'm kind of confused here. If you look at the ingredients, how is it that you expect anything but bland? There's turkey (Butterball?), mirepoix, peas, and noodles. After reading all the comments, I decided to try the basic recipe with some minor modifications based on reviewer comments. First, we smoked our turkey on the grill with pecan chunks, and that made a noticeable difference. After we ate the bird for T'day, we removed all meat and skin, broke the carcass, and added the whole lot to a pot of water with the mirepoix (celery, onions, carrots), then simmered for three hours. Next day, I heated the mixture, and roasted further the chunked dark meat from the carcass for 30 minutes at 325. To the mixture, I added two (2) tsps of Penzey's Fines Herbes, one-and-a-half tsps of red pepper flakes, the peas and noodles and, when done, the extra-roasted dark meat. To the diners, it was very good. It wasn't "bland" (as if there's something wrong with that, especially when you're cold, sick, or tired), but it was full-flavored, hearty, and really good with some rosemary rolls and Irish butter. Next time, I might substitute green beans for the peas. I'll definitely make this again.

The comments here are (mostly) from very inexperienced cooks. And, please save me from turkey soup with millet. This is a good, basic recipe. The main point is to make a good stock. I put all the vegetables in at the beginning, and cook the stock for about 3 hours. Then strain everything out. Put fresh vegetables in at the end. Best to cook rice or noodles before adding. (They soak up too much stock otherwise.) Best not to add salt until the end, as the reduction of the stock can make the whole thing too salty.

This recipe needs a lot of help. I put the turkey carcass with celery, onions, and thyme in the slow cooker for 8 hours -- it needs to simmer long and slow to make a meaty broth. And there's no salt in the ingredient list at all. How can you make a decent soup without salt? I spiced it up with lots of seasonings and sherry peppers sauce. And I used regular spiral pasta instead of egg noodles -- the substitution worked fine if you don't have noodles on hand. Still, not exciting enough a soup to justify making it again.

Great starting point for someone who wants to follow a recipe to make soup. Secret of soup is a good broth. I always add more flavor to my broth by throwing in herbs, still on stems (rosemary, thyme, parsley) and a couple of pieces of onion, chunks of carrots, and some celery (parts w/ leaves). Cook carcus long and slow for best flavor. I also add more fresh herbs to the vegetables when preparing.

I'd make this again...but only the way I made it this time, which is to say by adding EVERYTHING under the sun to make it tasty. I used the basic ingredients, then ran to the store when I realized it wasn't going to be very good. I added fresh Marjoram (see previous reviewer..thanks!), Dried Sage, Dried Basil and Sea Salt and Black Pepper. Also threw in some zucchini (no peas or potatoes in mine,) mushrooms (add last of course,) green onion and cabbage...a few slices at the end. Instead of the Egg Noodles, I used Millet...made it beside the soup and put some in when all was said and done. Have rec'd raves..and I rave myself...Really nice soup and quite light without the noodles!!

I just took the basic idea from the recipe and added a dry onion soup mix and the veggies I had stuffed the brined turkey that was cooked on a spit on the BBQ. I also added rice and fresh veggies after I strained it. Very good!

Even using the suggestions in the other reviews, I still found this soup to be bland. The recipe has potential but needs to be jazzed up.

More stock (one large cube) and seasonings (sage, marjoram) are needed before this recipe comes alive.

Watery and bland is right. There has to be a better turkey soup recipe than this, so I'll pass this on this one and keep looking.

I only gave this recipe 3 forks because I changed it - as written, it is very bland. I had brined my turkey and even so, the broth was hardly tastier than water. I added 3 large bouillion cubes, a few chopped mushrooms, used only 1 yellow onion and added 2 green onions. After all that, my family loved it!
