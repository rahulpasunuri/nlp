I like the taste, texture and color of red cabbage, and the dressing was light yet flavorful. I added one ingredient, by accident, which worked really well. Try it with fresh mint next time. What a nice surprise and enhancement!

I was so happy to see this recipe. I had forgotten it. It is so simple and wonderful. Similar to a cabbage salad I make with cabbage, black olives, feta tossed with lemon juice and olive oil.

My husband liked it more than I did, next time I would reduce the vinegare quantity in the dressing. Salad could be really better with lettuce as recipe originally says, I used instead chinese cabbage. But it was OK!

I adjusted the recipe somewhat using only 1 cup of red cabbage instead of 2. I also found the dressing too strong so I added an extra 1/4 cup of Olive oil and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I also used less feta. I got rave reviews on the salad from the supper guests. Simple to make and different.

My half-Hungariarn neighbor wanted the recipe after I served this. I mistakenly used "Hot" paprika - but it made the salad course a bit more fun and entertaining! Used pre-shreadded red cabbage in a package too! Also used a bit less feta.

Delicious! The dressing is not too strong to over-power the taste of the lettuce. And there is extra so you can put some on your salad anytime you want. Everyone loved it! Maybe use a little less cabbage unless you like a strong cabbage taste.
