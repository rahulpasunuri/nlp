I was looking for a recipe to use the candied orange peel that I'd made on a whim, and this seemed perfect! I took others' suggestions and added 1/4tsp almond extract to balance out the orange flavour from the liqueur and peel. It was perfect! Dipping the ends in chocolate is also definitely worthwhile!

This was my first attempt at biscotti, and I enjoyed the soft texture. They were a bit crumbly to slice, but I got the knack after the first couple pieces. I subbed ample chopped dried orange slices in for candied, and thought it added the right amount of sweetness and tang.

These were nice, not too sweet biscotti that ended up perfectly crispy. Per other reviews, I also used a bit of orange juice and peel (actually clementine) rather than the candied peel. I think that the orange juice especially provided a good, light orange flavor. These were good with the whole-wheat flour that I used. Enjoy!

Yummy! Several people have asked for the recipe! I used many of the suggestions of others (zest of one orange instead of candied orange; 1 tsp almond extract instead of liqueur and I replaced the remaining liquid with the juiced orange; omitted egg yolk). I also used slivered almonds, made just two logs for bigger biscotti and had to reduce the first cooking time a bit. My own tip: the final product was made even more delectable by dipping one end into melted semi-sweet bakers chocolate and allowing to cool on waxed paper!

Today was my first time making this recipe, although I have made other biscotti recipes a number of times. I omitted the liqueur and added a teaspoon of almond extract which made a much firmer dough. In addition I cut the first baking time by five minutes which made it much easier to cut the slices. I also reduced the final cooking time to fifteen minutes. They came out perfectly.

This biscotti comes out too soft and is a bit too sweet for my taste. The only change I made was to substitute fresh orange zest for the candied orange peel. Next time I will cut back on the Grand Marnier, chop the nuts less finely (not a problem for my Henckels serrated knife!) and increase the second baking time by 5 minutes.

I found these delicious cookies to be delicate in both taste and look. Because I really like candied orange rind, and because I like a more pronounced tasting cookie, I will increase the amount of orange next time I make these biscotti. All in all I thought this was a very good, well written recipe.

Very nice texture..nice hardness found in good biscotti. I substituted chopped cherries and cherry brandy in lieu of orange. Took the advice and did not use egg wash.

These are wonderful but I left out the candied orange peel and used fresh for a more orangy flavor. I will make these again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'd never made biscotti before and was anticipating it being rather difficult, but this recipe was actually quite easy to follow and came out very well. My one suggestion would be to not brush the lops with egg yolk. It left a very funny slimy feel on top of the biscotti and also leaves a funny aftertaste. Otherwise... superb!

I gave these as gifts and everyone loved them. I can't believe no one else has commented on the size. If you follow the directions, they turn out to be mini-biscotti. I think I'll only make one big log next time to give them that traditional length. Overall, very good.

Although I liked this recipe and the result was good. I have found other biscotti recipes that I think are easier and have a better texture. This is quite a light biscotti, it almost turns out a little " toasty " rather than hard for dunking. I would make it again, but check out the double chocolate and walnut biscotti also on this site. I think it is a better one and was certainly more popular with my family

This is my favorite biscotti recipe. It's fun to make, and the cookies turn out great every time.

This is my favourite recipe for biscotti. I add a drop of almond essence and a squeeze of orange juice just to increase the flavour, but other than that the recipe is perfect. I think freezing the dough makes all the difference.

I like this recipe because it uses so much less butter than my other recipes for biscotti, meaning I can eat many more at one sitting! Chilling the dough before working with it is a tip I will use with all versions of biscotti. After preparing the dough as stated,I put about half of it back into the mixing bowl and added 3/4 cup cocoa powder to make a chocolate log. I baked some of each as is, and also twisted some of the chocolate dough with the plain dough. It was delicious and beautiful!

these cookies were nice and crunchy,although no matter how I tried they seemed to get a little more brown on the bottom.

EXCELLENT!!! Freezing the dough worked great. I made two logs - but - only baked one, leaving the other log in the freezer. I used the peel of one whole orange and 1 cup of whole almonds (chopped). I used Orange Curacao (3TBSP). I plan on making an "Anisette" batch next .....

Excellent recipe. Turned out just right. nice and crisp with the candied peel just like I was looking for. The freezing step seems to be the trick it helped out a lot.

Although this recipe comes out far too soft to be considered authentic biscotti, I plan to use some of these suggestions again. Namely, freezing the dough for a half hour, and then slicing into that rectangle. Other biscotti doughs are always so sticky, and this trick seemed like just the thing to keep the dough together and not all over your utensils or hands! Also, I would use Grand Marnier again. Here, I used 2 TBSP of that with 1 TBSP of vanilla, 1 TBLS O.J. and a bit of clementine rind in place of the candied orange peel, and the citrus was great. Also, I reccomend more nuts, 3/4 cup almonds, 1/2 cup Pine nuts.

I usually make two logs instead of 3 to get bigger biscotti and instead of brandy, I use rum extract. The freezing step makes the log stronger so it will not break when you slice it.
