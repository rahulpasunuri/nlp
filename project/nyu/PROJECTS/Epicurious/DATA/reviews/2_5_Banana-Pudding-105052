No, this isn't the super-foodie, make-it-organic-and-from-scratch recipe, and if you want that, you can find it. But I bet that a lot of people looking up this recipe are looking for the version their grandmother *actually* made, and this is it. The fact is, that when convenience foods came into vogue, people started using them! So, if you want the 'nana pudding of your youth, and you want it to taste right, this is the one. FWIW, I put some pudding on the bottom, then bananas, then wafers, then pudding, etc.Make sure to use really really ripe bananas so they impart their flavor. Save some wafers at the end, top with crumbles for a bit of texture.

Like a previous reviewer said,"I love my family too much to serve them this kind of 'garbage'". What kind of nutrition is in boxed pudding and/or wafers...NONE. Eating a plain old banana would be a much better choice.

Did Mrs. Wilkes rip off this monstrosity from Sandra Lee of "Semi-Homemade" fame? To the powers that be: most of us are here at Epicurious to avoid recipes such as this. If I wanted to use all processed foods I would turn to Paula Deen, Sandra Lee, et al, not Gourmet or Bon Apetit.

I made this recipe using Jello Banana Creme instant pudding and 2 bananas sliced instead of 4. It came out great! My kids loved it and I plan to make it again soon. Forget the meringue and use whipped cream. Serve cold. A WINNER DESSERT!

The "authentic" southern banana pudding uses half the milk called for on the box of instant, a cup of sour cream, and a tub of cool whip folded in. layer with bananas and Nilla wafers, and top with cool whip. It ain't gourmet, but it's a great summer treat. We call it "redneck trifle"

Though I have not used this web site "recipe" I have made this version, with reservation. There is an authentic recipe, using milk, egg yolks, etc, for the pudding on the texascooking.com site. The only culinary tabu therein being the boxed vanilla wafers suggested. Homemade sugar cookies work just as well.

All you egalitarians out there, this website is called "epicurious" as in epicurean. There are many websites with instant pudding recipes out there. Can't we have a website with gourmet recipes? Shouldn't this website be safe from "recipes" like "vegetable soup - open can of soup and add one cup of water." To make matters worse, this was the worst banana pudding. Besides which, this recipe was awful.

1 fork made with instant pudding. 4 forks with "real" cooked vanilla pudding. It is worth the extra 15 minutes to make it right.

Disusting!! Foul after-taste! Never ever again! I love my family too much to serve this. Threw the whole mess away.

I was very skeptial of instant pudding. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. This recipe is very good. If you want something that remiinds you of your childhood, that is fast, simple and non-gourmet, this is the recipe for you. I would definitely make this recipe again and I would not bother making the pudding from scratch.

Since I have lived in NC since 1994, I am qualified to say that this is the real deal! My only wish is that I had a glass of sweet iced tea to wash it down! This recipe is even better than the banana pudding at the Smithfield Barbecue in Clayton. The only adjustment that I made was that I added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract to the pudding to make it a little richer. We also added the whipped cream on top rather than mess with the merangue. My two teenage boys loved it as an after school snack and again for dessert the same evening.

Yuck, I let my daughter make this for a sleepover and then I made the mistake of tasting it. The whole mess was dreadful, I never had instant pudding before - too sweet with a strange aftertaste.

Boxed pudding? Instant? Nasty ol' vanilla wafers? Remind me never to eat at Mrs. Wilkes.

As a born and bred southerner, my mother and grandmothers make cooked banana pudding. I HATED it! I never knew b.p. could be tasty until I went to a church potluck and had it with boxed pudding and cool whip (instead of meringue). Who wants heavy, starchy pudding and hot bananas?

Come on. Instant pudding? You've got to be kidding me. Banana pudding should be made from a homemade, from scratch pudding, with a meringue baked on top. Not this!

Yes, adding sweetened condensed milk to the pudding mix gives this a creamy richness that always gets big raves from family and friends. I'll make this for cookouts or just family potlucks. Being from the south, this is the only way I have ever had Banana Pudding and I would definitely agree with the cook who said that the essence of southern cooking isn't that everything is made from scratch but from the ingenuity of southern cooks who have made the best out of what they had. But then I came from a poor family in the Delta so what do I know?

A custard made with eggs, milk, sugar, cornstarch and vanilla bean would be more representative of Southern cooking; however, this recipe is fast and foolproof (eg. camping).

My boyfriend loves banana pudding. This banana pudding, however, he does not. It's better if you use banana cream flavored pudding instead of vanilla.

I was very disappointed in seeing "instant" pudding in this website recipe. buy a box of pudding and this recipe is on the side. I was looking for how to "cook" the pudding my mother and grandmother did when i was a child. And you can't get more southern than LA(lower Alabama)

I love epicurious and have rarely modified a recipe but I thought someone on this sight gave this recommendation. I can't take the credit but it makes the best banana pudding I have ever had. Add one can of sweetened condensed milk mixed with 1.5 cups of water with the pudding. Fold in 1 pint of cream whipped with .5 tsp of banana extract and you have a winner of all time. Type of think you lick the spoon until 5 lbs are gained. Keep all the same. Just add the condensed milk, water and extract. Truly indulgent.

This is just how my mom used to make it, except my mom didn't use merangue on top. I would not deprive my children of a child hood memory by fancying it up.

How funny that this would be debated. Real, unromanticized Southern cooking is an art form, but it is one that was cultivated by generations of women who knew how to "make do" with what they had. Authentic southern cooking is as likely as not to include a can of condensed soup or a tub of refrigerated whipped topping. Mrs. Wilkes recipe is a classic.

From what I recall from eating as Mrs. Wilkes, she started her boarding house as a way to meet ends meet. She was a darling woman and embodied Southern charm. And her pudding was awesome!

This is a great, easy "old-fashioned" recipe (you'd be surprised by how many restaurants take "shortcuts' with prepackaged ingredients!). When I make banana pudding, I use the cook and serve style pudding mix and make a double batch. I think this gives it that extra flavor that some are complaining is missing from the instant. I also use cool whip instead of making a meringue.

Homemade custard/pudding is generally richer and more hearty, while the boxed pudding is pretty cool and light. Sometimes that is what you want in a recipe. Anyway, why heckle a cute old lady who just wanted to help people? Maybe she didn't have the energy to cook all that homemade pudding every day.

This came out delicious. Next time I will use two boxes of vanilla pudding. My husband and friend loved it.

Has anyone considered the fact that this recipe comes from a 1950's boarding house, and not from the epicurious snob files? If you want to make your own pudding, more power to you, but don't knock this in the process. Would you tell your mother that you don't want to use the recipes she fed you as a kid, because she didn't make everything from scratch?

Quick, easy and delicious! I am a southerner who has never made "home made vanilla pudding". I have eaten at Mrs. Wilkes many times and this pudding one of my "favorites" at the boarding house!

I have made both types of 'Nana Puddin'(as we call it) with the boxed pudding mix and also making the custard from scratch. Using the box pudding is much easier (and people seem to like it more if you add a little banana flavoring to the pudding)...however, when I used to make it with the custard from scratch I'd get rave reviews and EVERYONE always asked for the recipe. And I always top with Cool Whip. Always a crowd pleasing inexpensive dessert that can be made quickly.

This is a good recipe for kids to make or assist. My three year old likes to help out and I had him arrange the wafers and bananas and spread the pudding. He thought it was "excellent".

I tried it and liked it but its the first time I have ever made Banana Pudding from a mix. I am a true southern cook and have always made these from scratch. A true southern banana pudding is like a plain custard pudding with a small amount of banana flavoring, cut up bananas, nilla wafers and NO top except wafers spread around. My Grandmother and Mother always made banana pudding this way. The real thing is to die for.

I've made cook-and-serve banana pudding for kids, layered with Nilla wafers and bananas, and they loved it. Really, lambasting this recipe only makes you look foolish. Why bother rating it? That is TRULY tacky!

This is not authentic Southern banana pudding (except for the meringue). The real stuff should be made with from-scratch custard sauce and not boxed pudding. Real banana pudding is to die for. Mrs. Wilkes' recipe is the equivalent of packaged macaroni and cheese.

This was good - not great but certainly not terrible. I suppose all these pudding snobs mill their own flour and make their own cheese. Get over yourselves. If you can do it all, why are reading cooking web sites?

This was a very simple recipe. I have to agree with the other person that rated this, next time I will try homemade pudding instead of instant. Everyone in the house loved this dessert. After a few hours in the refrigerator the pudding started getting watery. I noticed this happened with a triffle I made last weekend,(also with instant pudding) Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?

My mother (a stellar cook from Silver Point, TN) made her pudding from scratch, with egg yolks, milk, butter, sugar, vanilla and cornstarch. The egg whites became the meringue which she sprinkled with a little nutmeg before baking. It was sublime. Instant vanilla pudding? No way.
