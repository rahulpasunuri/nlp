This is a great side dish on it's own, but I have also used it as a pizza topping - mozzarella base (no sauce), then the chard, topped with feta (in lieu of stirring it in with the chard at the end), then pine nuts. A great 'go to' side with chicken or pork, but amazing as a non-traditional pizza topping!

love this recipe. I usually use rainbow chard instead of swiss, and chicken broth instead of water, and occasionally leave out the currants. It goes well with just about everything. I make this at least once a week.

This is great! I didn't have currents, so used dried cherries.

This is excellent. Served with lamb and Greek potatoes and it was a huge hit.

This was a really unique way of doing chard. I only had raisins, so used them instead of the currents and chopped them really finely so my kids wouldn't know they were in there, and it worked like a charm.

Oh my goodness! This was so good. I added some toasted pine nuts and lemon juice and served it on a bed of black quinoa. It was awesome! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

I picked up my first ever bunch of red chard today at the farmer's market and cooked it tonight using this recipe - it was delicious and I'm a convert to chard! I used 1 tbs olive oil and 1 tbs butter instead of the 2 tbs olive oil and used dried cherries instead of currants. I also used dry white wine instead of the water and sprinkled some of last week's left over toasted pine nuts on top. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added a tiny bit of lemon juice. This dish had a savory and earthy flavor with a hint of sweetness and a very satisfying texture. Before tonight I was scared of chard but this dish turned me on to a new favorite veggie!

This recipe was quick, simple and delicious! I used dried cranberries and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make this again and again!

Really wonderful and flavorful. I threw in some spinach as well, and subbed dried cherries in place of the currants. So good!

I love this. What an interesting way to serve swiss chard. Of course I love feta cheese, too. Made it just as written. Wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious and so easy. I think I also added a little lemon juice to this to bring out the flavors - ready in less than 20 mins including cleaning, chopping, and stemming the chard.

LOVED this. I halved the recipe and followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do. Perfect combo of sweet and savory. This is my new default recipe for chard.

Very tasty and so easy! I substituted golden raisins for the currants- perfect sweet and savory combination.

This is a huge favorite. I am always elated when I find Swiss chard in my CSA vegetable box. My boyfriend likes to sprinkle a little balsamic vinegar on, but it's also good without. Fresh beet greens and stems may easily be substituted for the chard.

I always like to find ways to add more greens into our diet and this is a great way to do that. The whole family loved this sweet and savory dish. I added more feta because I just love it. Very easy and worth making anytime. Enjoy!

This recipe is very easy and tasty. I substituted fresh cranberries for currents, as chard and cranberries are both in season. It is very colorful for presentation and the cranberries soak the water. I would use less salt to taste next time. I served it over spaghetti which was very hearty.

I'm not a fan of chard, but this recipe made it fairly pleasant to eat, and it is so good for us.

This was super easy, and full of flavor. I made a lot of substitutions (broth instead of water, cranberries instead of currants, and gorgonzola cheese instead of feta), but I think the basic combination of flavors is pretty incredible and flexible. Like another reviewer, I served this over couscous and it was a filling, tasty meal. One thing: this made four TINY, side-dish servings. When served with couscous as a main dish, it would only serve two, with no seconds.

This is definitely the best recipe I've found for swiss chard. I substituted dried cranberries for the currants, and used fat free feta from Trader Joe's. It would make a great Thanksgiving side dish.

It was good, but I cut back on the water and added red wine vinegar. It was very tasty and super easy

I thought this was pretty good. Loved the sweetness of the currants with it. Thought the feta tasted a little wierd with it personally, so served it as an optional side. Overall, relatively low effort, good return, nothing mind-blowing.

Wow! This was outstanding. The flavor combination was very complimentary. I usually make a lot of substitutions, but with this one I would not substitute anything else for the currants if at all possible. They have exactly the right flavor to pull this dish together. I did use chicken broth in place of the water and cut it back to 1/4 cup because of other reviewers comments about it being too watery. It turned out just right. I also used super tasty feta from a local farmer's market, but supermarket feta will do just fine. Among the commonly found brands I like plain Athenos the best. Make sure to buy feta in blocks rather than pre-crumbled. It loses too much moisture and richness of flavor when it is packaged in crumbles. Try this, it's fabulous!

Yum! I made this into a one pot meal by adding some Israeli couscous and toasted pine nuts. I also tossed in about a tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a bit more of a kick.

I have never had swiss chard before and was slightly hesitant. I've been eyeballing this recipe since receiving my Dec. issue and I finally made the leap and made this. DELICIOUS! The blend of flavors is perfect. A wonderful dish for any health conscious individual - or someone who simply enjoys food.

A super, quick, satisfying side dish. The flavors are very complementary. This recipe is destined to become a regular among my weekday side-dish favorites.

This was excellent!! A great and different way of serving chard. I agree with the previous reviewer-the water is a bit excessive. I didn't like it that runny. I used the dried Cranberries, but the rasins sounded good too. I might give that a try someday!

Rating: 3
Like the previous reviewer, I had no currants so used golden raisins. The amount of water seemed excessive given the water remaining on the leaves. I liked the combination of flavors and plan to do it again.

Very good. I added a little extra feta and used chopped raisins in place of currants, which I didn't have on hand.
