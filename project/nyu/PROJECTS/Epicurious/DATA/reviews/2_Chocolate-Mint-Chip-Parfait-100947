I thought this recipe had thin mints in it,too. Some one should think of a good one here.

I can not believe that you can put a recipe online that tastes like girl scout cookies for one thing this tastes nothing like thin mints and for another how can you give this recipe out girls like me are out there selling a rare treat that people buy a whole lot of boxes of just so that they can put them in their freezer for a special treat and here you are putting a recipe that you think tastes like ours and affecting our buisness

I thought this recipe had Thin Mints in it. The rest of the Girl Scout Cookie recipes do.
