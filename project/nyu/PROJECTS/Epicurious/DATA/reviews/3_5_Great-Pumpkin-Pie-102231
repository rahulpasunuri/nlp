Just a comment on other reviewers having problems with bottom crust burning.. I always use a glass pie plate so I can monitor the crust as it bakes, and I also never put the pie on the actual bottom of my oven. The lowest rack works very well, but I agree that you do have to watch it closely. If it seems to be baking too quickly, move it up higher in the oven and maybe double the cookie sheet under the pie for an additional layer of insulation.

I make this pie every year at Thanksgiving and everyone loves it. I usually double the gingersnap/pecan layer in between the crust and filling and it really helps with keeping the bottom crust crisp. The custard is delicious and makes a wonderful pudding on its own if you don't want the crust. I do usually up the spices just because I like it a bit more, but that's personal preference. Enjoy!

Against my better judgment, I put the pie on the bottom of the oven and as expected, the crust burned to a crisp! I wonder if this practice should be limited to a certain kind of oven. Or if the pie should have been in a different sort of baking dish.

I forgot to add I didnt bother with the pecans and ginger snaps and it was still perfect (although I still want to try it)

My family said there was too much ginger so I cut the ginger in half and added 1 tsp nutmeg and it is PERFECT!!! I usually make a different recipe every time looking for perfection, and now I found it!!!!!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was big hit! Everyone loved it, and especially raved about the pecan/gingersnap addition. I followed author's suggestion on cooking time, and had no problem with the pie being over or underdone. Took about 55 min. in convection mode.

I was eager to try this recipe because of the highly favorable reviews, and because like the author I am also borderline fanatical about taking whatever extra steps might be necessary to get a pie crust just right. Well, it's almost done, still in the oven, and already I know the bottom is burnt. This is a huge disappointment. I could smell the bottom burning even before the 30-minute mark (when I was about to open the oven to put a ring protector over the crust. I thought the filling had perhaps bubbled over onto the bottom of the oven, but no. How are you supposed to know whether you're one of the ones who should use the bottom rack instead?

I have made this pie every Thanksgiving for 5 years now. I am a pumpkin fan, for sure, and this one is perfectly and positively pumpkinny (is that really a word?). I did cheat a few years (being really pregnant at Thanksgiving) and bought a (gasp) Pillsbury fridge crust...I but always added the gingersnaps and pecans to it. I think that the addition makes this pie great. I do agree, though, that it needs more of the spices. I discovered this the first year and have since always added more.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Overall, the whole recipe was bland, from the filling to the ginger snap and pecan layer. I used a blue Indian heirloom pumpkin for the puree, but I don't think this was the cause of blandness.

Didn't try the crust but the filling was turned out really good. Followed it to a T. The only down side is the filling was a tinny bit bland . Mmaybe more cinnimon. Thought teh ginger would be to strong but It was not.

Loved it! Very smooth and light. I found the crust to be a bit too crunchy, however. I think next time I'll cook it on a higher shelf. I had leftover filling, so I would recommend saving any extra pie crust to make a tart or two.

one of- if not THE best pumpkin pies I have ever had (made). Have plenty of fresh whipped cream on hand---then hope that there is some left for breakfast.

WOW! I was nervous about making pumpkin pie for the first time, but this was well worth the effort! I will never buy a pre-made pie again! I would recommend this to everyone!

I am not a great lover of pumpkin pie, but will have a token piece at the holidays. I made this one for the pumpkin pie lovers on Thanksgiving and was very impressed. I enjoyed it very much and noticed the pumpkin taste was mellowed due to the cooking of the pumpkin in a saucepan before placing it in the crust. The gingersnaps and pecans at the bottom add a wonderful dimension as well.

Best pumpkin pie I've ever had. I made it according to the recipe without changes. The crust turned out great as well!

Delish! Used fresh "Cinderella" squash from a farm stand for the "pumpkin" and half & half instead of the milk/cream combo. The processor worked wonders on the texture and cooking the spices as directed resulted in a wonderful, mellow taste. My guests raved about the pie and the remaining slices mysteriously did not make it thru the night! Yum-E.

Followed the recipe to a T. The extra time and effort required for the crust is worth it. This pie is all about the pumpkin and the spices serve as background for the star of the show the pumpkin.

Haven't tried this, but my roommate LOVES it. I substituted nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in for some of the cinnamon. Just one note...Measure the capacity of your food processor first, mine was NOT big enough and I had pumpkin batter everywhere!

The best pumpkin pie I've ever had. I used a premade crust and added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the recipe (I like my pie spicy). It has the smoothest texture and the gingersnap crust just makes it!!!!

I make two pies for Thanksgiving. One with the flaky crust and one without. Trust me, the homemake flaky crust is worth your time. The other crust broke off and did not even compare to the homemade crust. The pie was light and delicious.

This pie was fantastic. I decided to be anal and follow RLB's instructions to a T: the crust was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten: tender, flaky, superb. Yes, it's a pain in the neck to make it her way, but it doesn't take that much longer than other crust recipes and the results are worth it! The gingersnap/pecan trick absolutely worked and the filling was mellow and earthy and smooth! Can't wait for Thanksgiving to make this again!

Never made pumpkin pie before. This pie tasted great and I will definitely make it again. Tried this crust recipe - disaster. Used the recipe on the Crisco box instead but still included the ground gingersnaps and pecans - great results.

This is the first pie recipe I ever tried, and it turned out great! I used the quick pie crust recipe instead, and made it with fresh pumpkin, which worried me, considering I had no idea how to prepare it for the pie. I grated slices of pumpkin, then cooked the pumpkin with a little water untill soft. It literally disapeared at the potluck, for a first time, it was a great success!

We liked this pie a lot. I used the Joy of Cooking's pie crust -- it was easier than this one. I also added 1 teasp. each of nutmeg, ginger, and all-spice to the filling. Instead of processing it, I used a mixer: the texture was just fine.

I made this pie last Thanksgiving. The crust tasted great but was time-consuming to prepare. The filling was panned by my extended family as being too bland. This year I will use the crust recipe and I am searching for a different filling. I had a James Beard recipe with maple syrup that I will try to find .

I loved this pie. The texture was fabulous! And the crust was flaky (just the way I like it.) I will definantly make this again. All my guests were crazy over it. I truly recommend this to anyone who likes pumpkin pie. If you don't like pumpkin pie (a lot) don't bother wasting your time. This recipe took a lot of effort.

I liked the idea of the ginger snap crust so I made the crust from this recipe and I made the filling from the epicurious recipe for chiffon pumpkin pie. It was delicious.

I was *not* impressed. I thought the crust was heavy and hard, and the extra step of pressing crushed gingersnaps and pecans into it was a waste of time because you can't even taste them. The filling was good, and the pureeing doea give it a nice texture. I made a peach pie using the Joy of Cooking recipe, and that crust was so much better it made the pumkin pie crust embarrassing.

If you are tired of the same old pumpkin pie this the one for you. The gingersnaps on the bottom make the crust. It's spices aren't over done and the pureeing is really worth the extra effort. This is a new classic for the holidays.

I am not a very practiced cook. I cannot say that this was an easy recipe, but by simply following the instructions, I was able to make a nearly perfect pumpkin pie. Many thanks for the many compliments I have received for this pie!

The great pumpkin pie is really an OK pumpkin. Liked the texture of the filling, but the crust was not my favorite and did not like cooking on the bottom of the oven. Will probably try the filling in my crust and a regular cooking method.

This is truly a "great" pie. Pumpkin is my favorite and this is my favorite recipe. The spices are not over done.
