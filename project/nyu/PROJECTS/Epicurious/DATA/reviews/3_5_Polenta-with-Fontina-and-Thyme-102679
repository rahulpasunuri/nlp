This is my second time making polenta, and my first time making it with Fontina. It was fantastic. The Fontina is a great addition, and the thyme and garlic add some nice (if very subtle) flavor. I definitely plan on making this many more times.

I love this recipe--I make it 3-4 times a year for special occasions. It is one of my husband's favorite. I add a little more cheese but otherwise don't deviate from the recipe.

First time making polenta but I used the instant and it was done in 8 mins. All my guess raved and wanted the recipe!

This was the first time I made polenta In cooking the polenta I did not follow the instructions. It was cooked for 1 1/2 hours in a double boiler covered with foil. Did not have to deal with constant stirring. Three time the first 30 min then once every 30 mins thereafter. No lumps.

This dish never made it to my table. It could be that I erred on the directions, but I don't think so. It tasted horrible and I couldn't resolve the texture (for polenta?!!!) - too creamy. Unfortunately, it went into the sink disposal and I ended up cooking noodles instead.

This is the only soft polenta recipe I'll ever use: the fontina cheese gives the polenta such a creamy sweetness, and the thyme is divine!

3.5 forks (there are two of us - one says three, the other says four)Great taste and creamy texture. Thyme and garlic are subtle flavors, cheese stands out. Excellent accompaniment to roasted chicken. Easy to make and will definately make again!
