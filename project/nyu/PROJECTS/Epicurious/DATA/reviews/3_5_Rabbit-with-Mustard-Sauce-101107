This was easy and delicious. I was afraid the mustard would be a little overpowering but I soldiered on and used the full amount. Perfect.

First time cooking rabbit and it turned out awesome! The meat had firmness to it (as oppose to falling off the bone), but it was very tasty. I added garlic to the sauce and used leeks for onions. Use half grainy and half garlic dijon. Served over buttered egg noodles and braised cabbage (Lidia's recipe from this site). This recipe serves more like 3-4 not 4-6 in my opinion.

I too added garlic and tarragon. I also served it with herb spetzle. Great recipe.

It's an incredibly easy recipe to actually prepare, and the results were excellent. I actually replaced the chicken stock with beef stock, which probably slanted the dish to a richer flavor.

As others have noted, the sauce is superb! You could easily use chicken or pork if you don't have rabbit. I served it with garlic whipped potatoes with some Greek yogurt added for tang, and some green beans. Positively delicious!!

Good stuff but with a few alterations. I skipped the starch and pureed the sauce instead and cooked rabbit half and hour longer than recommended in the finished sauce. Really nice over egg noodles. Liked it better than the last rabbit I had at a bistro in Montpelier.

Fantastic, and so easy. I added a bit of tarragon, and substituted creme fraiche instead of cornflower as the thickener (need to simmer for about 15 minutes). Used a mix of Dijon and grainy mustard - about 3/4 of amount mentioned in the recipe. Guests raved about it! Will cook this again. Served with mashed potatoes and pan-seared brusell sprouts with pine nuts.

Terrific! Made exactly as written except did the braising in a 350-degree oven for one hour. The sauce was rich and delicious despite using less butter and oil than similar recipes. Served with buttermilk/chive mashed potatoes and sauteed red cabbage. Paired very nicely with a California Anderson Valley Gewürztraminer.

Made this recipe for Easter Dinner April 12/09. Excellent,a nice change from red wine. Used 2 fresh (3lb) rabbits cut into 6 pcs.ea. with mashed potatoes,red cabbage & cauliflower. A perfect meal for 6 people with left overs.The sauce was to die for. ****

This was a great recipe and pretty easy, too. By all means, if you like tarragon, add some in the last reduction. It really adds an elegant touch. And I did add a little cream to the sauce at the very end. Like others, I didn't use the entire amount of mustard called for in the recipe. 2T is enough. Served it with boiled potatoes with plenty of butter and parsley.Loved it.

My quivering bottomlip over the demise of Thumper quickly stopped upon tasting this! Very, very good, and so easy to make too! This will make many a reappearance when I want to treat someone with top quality comfort food. Served it with mash potato (generous butter and sour cream too...) and steamed leeks. Can hardly wait to have the leftovers for my Monday supper!!

Have rarely made rabbit at home but this recipe makes me want to prepare it more! The sauce is not difficult and compliments the rabbit very well. I halved the cooking time to 20 minutes and the rabbit came out fine. Delicious.

Lowered the mustard slightly, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Served with sour cream & butter & parsley mashed potatoes. Husband gave me a big kiss and did the dishes without anyone asking him to. My 11-year-old, after asking forgiveness of the bunny-gods, had seconds.

This recipe was great! I only used just one pan, after I removed the rabbit I deglaced the pan with a little bit of wine, and pour the browned bits on the rest of the rabbit - no reason to waste them! Then I cooked the onions on that same pan. I cooked it stove-top and followed the recipe beyond that. The sauce was really good. The rabbit itself impressed me less, so I think next time I'll make it with chicken instead.

To the cook from Dallas: I actually skipped the entire third paragraph altogether, so no mustard - I know I am straying pretty far from the original recipe, but it tasted so good at this point that I chose not to mess with it any further.

I made this using the original instructions, and it was very good, but am very interested in trying the technique of the cook from Rome who did the whole thing in a cast iron skillet. Did you put the mustard in before braising? Since an earlier review said emphatically NOT to even simmer after adding the mustard, I was unsure and decided not to chance it. I would really like to try this method, as it sounds much simpler.

I've made this more times than I can count. I like to add some fresh thyme toward the end along with about 1/4 cup of heavy cream. It's lovely with buttered gemelli or egg noodles.

I just wanted to offer a simplified version of this recipe which turned out amazingly good: I did everything in a cast-iron skillet and then when it was time to braise, I put it in the oven at about 350° uncovered. The sauce simmered down just enough, and after about an hour it was ready - I skipped the rest entirely. The onions and garlic (I added a chopped garlic clove and some fresh herbs from the garden) were yummy and caramelized at the bottom of the pan. We were wiping the pan with chunks of bread!

kinda hohum. The rabbit braised in red wine with sage is far superior.

Though with very few modifications/additions, preparing this dish for a friend's birthday dinner whose favorite is Rabbit made me treated like a goddess! It was the first Rabbit I'd ever cooked as well (usually roast Leg of Lamb or cook seafood or broil steak) I cooked this for hard-to-please French folks who said that it was among the best Rabbit they'd ever had. I liked the attention :) and I liked the light delicious taste as well.

i've made this once with rabbit and once with chicken and loved it both ways. it freezes well also.

This dish was a huge hit when I first made it at my dinner party, and I have gotten many subsequent requests from guests to make it again. It is important, however, not to let the sauce boil, or even simmer, after you have added the mustard; otherwise, it will have a slightly bitter taste.

Rating: 3
Very nice. Made a creamy sauce without being too mustardy. I'll make it next time with rabbit stock from the leftover carcass.

EXCELLENT! I added the garlic as others did and a few sprigs of fresh thyme. I too, would agree that this would cook more evenly in the oven. I strained he sauce before adding the mustard. The sraining made it silky. Delicious just same. An absolute keeper. Excellent for a special affair.

We really enjoyed this. Don't believe the "serves 4-6". We started with the recommended 3-pound rabbit, and I'd say that it serves 3, with some smaller pieces left in the pan for people who want another bite of rabbit. We added three minced cloves of garlic once the onions were softened. When I'm in the mood for rabbit, now I'll have a tough time choosing between this recipe and the "Trenette with Rabbit and Shiitake Mushroom Sauce" recipe also on Epicurious. Both are great!

I thought this was a really tasty dish. I also happen to really like rabbit, so that helps. The meat was tender and the sauce was good over the rabbit on a bed of mashed potatoes. It was a little salty by itself (and I added no extra salt and used low salt chicken broth). But one of my guests got up and went into the kitchen to get more sauce, so it must have been okay! This was a nice change of pace, but the all time impress your guests recipe is still Pan-Seared Tuna with Shiitake-Ginger Cream Sauce. Everyone seemed to enjoy the meal and made nice comments, but they weren't totally blown away like with that tuna recipe. I would make the rabbit again for myself and maybe try adding some maple syrup or honey to the sauce for something different. This is a good recipe though, even if you follow it exactly (which I did, except that I doubled it).

Delicious! I added two cloves of garlic with the onions, and a dollop of creme fraiche at the end (as per other reviewers suggestsions), and it was a big hit. Definitely needs mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce, and I think it cooks more evenly (and thoroughly) in the oven than simmering on the stove.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. We had never prepared rabbit before so were a little apprehensive. We used the full 1/4 cup of mustard but added more broth and let it cook about 15 minutes longer. Mashed potatoes were perfect with it to pick up the outrageously tasty sauce. Definitely a keeper!!! Seems like a terrific company dish.

I have lived in France and have tried many rabbit recipes. Often, rabbit with mustard sauce is augmented with creme fraiche (close to our sour cream)--a tablespoon or slightly more is sufficient. You could use heavy cream in lieu of creme fraiche. I don't suggest using sour cream, unless you like to watch your sauce to ensure that it doesn't boil and curdle. I would degrease the skillet in which the rabbit was browned and deglaze the pan to use in the sauce--essential!

Great recipe! I chose this as my first cooking experience with rabbit and was very pleased. Also added fresh thyme which worked nicely. Served it with mashed red potatos and wilted spinach - it was a big hit....very easy and delicious!

This is a decent base recipe for rabbit. It needs jazzing up though-- garlic, at least, and I usually add tarragon, and some chipotle pepper for heat. Our favorite way to serve this is on top of a pillow of garlic mashed potatoes, so that the yummy sauce can get soaked up.

I've never really had rabbit before, so I gave it a try with this recipe. I followed the directions without alteration. The sauce was okay, but the rabbit really didn't do it for me. I would have given it one fork, except I'm not sure if the dish wasn't good, or if I just don't like rabbit. And I tried the Pel-Freeze as someone else suggested - keep in mind that it's whole, and needs to be cut up.

Rabbit is readily available in Luxembourg and this recipe was terrific. The leftovers were even better the next day. I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion and some fresh thyme. Great cold weather dinner.

This recipe is fantastic. My husband is still raving about this dish. Used fresh rabbit and added a large jar of drained white beans (from Whole Foods) at the end, right before serving. Crusty bread and a nice salad are all you need to go with it.

A word of caution: If you own a tail-less cat named "Bunny Rabbit Kitten", NEVER cook a rabbit. Perfectly horrifying. My sweetheart and I could hardly eat it. However, our eight guests delighted in this unusual dish... I'm sure I'll make it again--just not for myself. --t

I used 3 tbsp of Maille Dijon Mustard and it was plenty...... This recipe was a hit among my guests.

Domestic rabbit is not available in this area, so I had to use wild rabbit (snowshoe hare actually). It's great for this recipe, but needs to be cooked longer. I liked this much better than some other mustard recipes I've tried that have the rabbit coated with the mustard first. Delicious!

Great recipe. I will definitely make this again. I had to substitue the dry white wine with a late harvest white reisling, which is on the sweeter side, and this was perfect. Also added some tarragon while reducing the sauce and used the 1/4 cup of mustard. Yum!

Excellent dish, I also served this with egg noodles and chiffonad collard greens. Only substitution was finely chopped baby spinach as I had no parsley. Easy to make and wonderful to eat.

This reminded me of a meal in a french bistro--I substitued boneless skinned chicken thighs, reduced cooking time to 25 minutes and used 3 TB of mustard, since it was authentic Maille from Dijon and very strongly flavored. It was OK to saute onions in the cooking juices from the chicken--not greasy at all. I made it early in the day, and reheated for dinner. Very easy and a big hit!

I recommend the the frozen line of rabbit fryers from Pel-Freeze if domestic fresh rabbit fryers are hard to come by. I would suggest using a smaller fryer up to 3 lbs dressed as the older and heavier the rabbit gets the tougher it is

I loved this dish. Even after forgetting the rabbit 20 more minutes on the stove it didn't dry out. The sauce is very good but I think I'll try something sweeter for the next time I'll prepare a rabbit.

I really liked the recipe. It is hard, sometimes, to find a good recipe for rabbit. I served this with buttered noodles and the mustard sauce was excellent. For rabbit lovers I would also reccomend Rabbit Dukes of Modena from the cookbook'The Splendid Table.'

I substituted 3 pounds of skinned chicken legs and thighs for rabbit (I fully intended to use rabbit, but Andronico's was out of everything two days after New Year's Eve). It was delicious, even better after a day in the fridge. One judgment call I made that turned out to be ill-advised was sauteing the onion in butter _plus_ the oil used for browning the chicken: the dish turned out slightly oilier than it should have been, so I would discard the oil in future attempts at this dish. I served the meat over a bed of lemon pasta; the citrus was a delightful counterpoint to the mustard in the sauce. Oh yes: I halved the mustard as well, and used "country dijon" with whole seeds; at this concentration of mustard, the flavor was distant rather than overwhelming. I might try a bit more next time, but twice as much would definitely be excessive.

Go ahead and use the 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard. This recipe is a real winner, easy to make, if you have the rabbit, available to me through a local farmer's market or from D'Artagnan, and as my teenager said, tastes "awesome."

I used the full compliment of mustard when making this recipe and did not find the mustard over powering. A very good rabbit recipe. Also if any of you heve trouble finding rabbit recipes. You can substitute rabbit in just about any chicken recipe and get excellent results.

I love rabbit and this recipe is pretty simple and turned out great! I used 2 TBS mustard as I thought that seemed about right - and when I read the other reviews it appears others also came to that conclusion as well. I will be making this one for company and ourselves again and again...

agree about the mustard. I used 2 tbs and it created enough mustard flavor. Served with wild mushroom noodles which are great with the sauce.

A very good dish. I thought 1/4 cup of Dijon was too much, so I reduced it to 1/8 cup which was just great with enough mustard taste and no bite.

Each of my 3 dinner guests loved this recipe and so did I! I'm only sorry that it's so difficult to find rabbit recipes anywhere. Do try this one!
