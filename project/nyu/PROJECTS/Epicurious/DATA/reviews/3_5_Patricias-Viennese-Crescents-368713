Nice and easy to make, but I found them a little bland. I was hoping for a nuttier taste, they had more of a flour taste with powdered sugar. I didn't have vanilla sugar, maybe that was the key.

Great recipe, great cookie. Next time, I'll make them smaller. I got exactly 30 cookies out of this recipe, and I thought they were a bit large. Even so, they're really good.

I'm not sure if everyone knows that all cookies are baked at 350 F, but I didn't, luckily I found the 1984 NYT recipe (which doesn't mention a food processor by the way, so if you don't have one do a search for that). I don't think that they took 18-20 minutes, so definitely check them around 10. If anyone could describe in detail how they get a beautiful shape I'd be appreciative. In my case the cookies sort of flattened a bit while baking despite a few shape efforts. They are very tasty but not quite the crumbly, buttery, nutty perfection I imagined that they would be...perhaps I'm missing something in my technique.

I prepared the cookies as written and they were excellent. They are so light and have been getting raves from everyone who enjoyed them. Only recommendation is to let the cookies cool a little more before putting the sugar on. I found if you did it after 2-3 minutes, the cookies were crumbling.

I made these the other day for an office potluck party. I didn't have a lot of time and they seemed like they would be pretty quick to make. Boy were they good! I found it was better to start them on the bottom rack of the oven and finish on the top one, that way they didn't spread out too much. A hreat cookie to include in a gift box!

Every time my husband takes a bite of one of these cookies he oohs or mms. Even my kids love these cookies. They are really simple to make and absolutely delicious. I'll be making them again tomorrow.
