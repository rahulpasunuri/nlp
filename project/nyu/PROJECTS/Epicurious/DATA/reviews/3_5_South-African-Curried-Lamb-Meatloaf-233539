While on a visit to Cape Town, South Africa four years ago I was served Bobotie (made with ostrich) at the Botanical Garden restaurant. Making this recipe brought back memories of that delicious meal. The combination of the meat (lamb), the sweet (apple and raisins) and the spice (onion, curry and lemon) left lingering flavors on my tastebuds ... like a fine wine. Halving the recipe (but using the full amount of apple and almonds) still made enough for four big servings. Tradition calls for serving this with rice, but I had mashed potatoes and it was delicious. And using a Gala instead of a Granny Smith apple did not disappoint. I would make more of the custard next time to provide full coverage of the meat. I may even invest in some nice ramekins to duplicate my Cape Town experience. I will make this again and not hesitate serving it to guests.

If there was a way to give this 0 forks, I would. I love lamb...but this was the greasiest pile of hell I've ever served. My husband, who loves lamb and meatloaf, took one bite and wouldn't eat another. We ended up throwing it out. I drained at least 1 cup of fat/grease off the the loaf over the entire cooking time. It was a loose, non-meatloaf consistency overall. Awful. First time I've ever left a review after many, many years of using Epicurious online and only because this was so very bad. And don't even get me started on the custard. I was so excited to make it - what a vast and expensive disappointment!

I'll make again and try to refine it. Made a few substituitions: used Panko instead of bread crumbs, used buttermilk instead of whole milk, used 1 # lamb, 1/2# turkey and 1/2# chicken. This turned out tasty but it was hard to get it to set. Probably because in lieu of my packed-away pyrex I used a Dutch Oven. Overall, I would say this is flavorful and moist--needs more curry and raisins, throw in some currants if you wanna get crazy. Served with some storebought fig jam and peach chutney.

I cut it in half because I only had a lb of ground lamb and there are only 2 people in my house. I also think I added more lemon zest. Since I used 1% milk, I don't think the custard set up the same so I broiled it for a few mins to finish setting up the custard. I served it with the cilantro chutney recipe on this site (using 1 cup of cilantro because the recipe seems to be missing it). The results were FABULOUS!. This one goes down as a keeper.

Hubby and I love ground lamb. We love all things curry. However, this did not blow our socks off. He says he would eat it again without the custard. I loved the currants and did serve it with chutney. I think next time I would bake it for less time(and I did halve the recipe)as it did dry out.

I really liked this recipe, its a little like picadillo but with some interesting flavors. I agree with other users that you should add more raisins and apple for sure, I also added apricots. Madras curry would have given it a better taste I think, but I only had regular on hand so I added some other spices to try and make it interesting. My boyfriend wasnt a huge fan, but only because he doesn't typically like fruits/sweets combined with meat. I think the custard on top is a must, its really unique that way and doesn't take any effort. I served it with coconut rice and apricot chutney, Id make it again for sure (but maybe just for me!)

This was really very good. I usually make the epicurious turkey meatloaf recipe with sun dried tomatoes - but I was out of ground turkey. I always have ground lamb on hand (brit expat - i love the lamb). Searched for lamb meatloaf and found this! I got started with the recipe and 10 minutes in discovered I didn't have curry powder. Made my own with variety of spices- cumin, tumeric, fennel seeds, cinnamon, mustard powder, ginger, cayenne pepper, black pepper. I also didn't make the custard - just the core meatloaf. After 30 minutes, removed and glazed with apricot preserve (just a tad) and back in the oven for 5 min. Served over israeli couscous with mango chutney (spicy) and apricot preserves (chutney for my husband, apricot preserves for the kids and I). Big hit. Will make again!

This dish was exceptional. I changed a few things, but kept the core of the recipe. My girlfriend and I don't like lamb, so I made the dish with 50/50 ground beef and pork. We didn't have almonds, so I left those out. Also, I skipped the custard at the end and just made the core loaf. When we took the first bite, we agreed it tasted like something we would be served at a nice restaurant - one that served meatloaf.

I made this on the fly for a weeknight dinner, and had to make some substitutions, but I was really impressed! I've never made meatloaf, because it just seems entirely too Betty Crocker, but this recipe was exotic enough that I wanted to try it, and I'm so glad I did. I used nonfat milk and crushed saltines, an unpeeled Fuji apple, currents, and olive oil instead of butter. The worst part: egg beaters instead of whole eggs. I was terrified to spoil the whole meal with the egg mixture but it really works. This isn't bland at all - it's very tasty and well-balanced. Served with baked sweet potato.

The combination of flavors in this dish makes it a hit. I was not sure about the custard baked over the lamb toward the end of cooking, but it turned out to be great. Even my husband, who is not a lamb fan, thought it was excellent.

I agree with the cook from Singapore. I only used 1.5 lbs of lamb, keeping the rest of the ingredients the same, & still the finished product just felt like a big block of meat. Also, while all the drippy juices that form on the top certainly make one want to pour them off, I kind of wish I hadn't. The finished product was a little dry. We used apricot jam as an accompaniment, which was good. The egg custard was thin on the top & gathered at the edges of the dish. Next time, I'll add more fruits (maybe dried apricot, fig) & veggies (celery maybe) to round it out.

A nice blend of flavors and textures. I found it to lent well to not overpowering the great mild ground lamb we used. We eat lamb once a week and this goes into my list of favorite lamb recipes.

Previous reviewers rated this recipe but had issues with some aspects. This is a Cape Malay dish. It is a mixture of Dutch and Malasian cooking from the Cape of Good Hope. The Dutch who started the colony brought in Malaysian slaves from their colony in Malasia as they needed skilled artisans (as all the dutch colonisers were uneducated and unskilled sailers or pressganged down and outs from the streets of Amsterdam). The Malaysians mixed their mild curry styles with Dutch styles. So you have Lamb curry (mild and yellow) traditionally served with white rice (Monday leftovers after Sunday roast minced and spiced). An essential sambal that no South African would consider eating Bobotie (the traditional name for this dish) without is Mrs Balls Chutney, a sweet malay style lightly spiced fruit chutney available in speciality stores the world over. The reviewer was right - a bit bland without the Mrs Balls...

Loved it. My friend throws cooking parties and this was on her menu for an African themed night. We substitued ground beef instead, and the flavors were awsome. Very unusual, but definitly exploded with flavors in a good way.

I used golden raisins, used one red onion and one yellow, and did not peel the apple before chopping, with fantastic results. The apple skin was not apparent or bothersome in the finished dish. I used lamb and am thinking that beef might require more seasoning, although this was seasoned just fine. Draining the fat thoroughly is important. Wonderful and although quite homespun in appearance, is unexpected enough for a dinner party perhaps.

Really looked forward to this dish, but it was a bit of a letdown. Couldn't really taste much of anything but the lamb itself, and the apples almonds and raisins didn't seem to lend any variety in texture. The basic ingredients and proportions are pretty much the same as other bobotie recipes on the web, so I wonder if it isn't just the dish itself. If I were to make this dish again, I'd probably double the curry powder, raisins, almonds and salt, cut the apples into bigger pieces, and not cook the apples and onions so much.

Recipe is good and different. Like the crunch from the almonds. Next time, try with fewer raisins - about 1/4 cup. Doesn't have to be white bread or whole milk.

This has been a family tradition for years and americans as well as ex-pats rave about it. (Hence my username.) However, using a good quality chutney kicks it up a notch. I would go with an english or south african one, you can find those online. Also the traditional version called for ground cooked lamb (it was originally made out of leftovers) which makes it really timeconsuming. It is good with beef too, for those who don't like lamb.

This dish was great! I didn't have all of the ingredients and it still was good. I used soy milk, and spelt bread because of my husband's allergies. I didn't have an apple, but used about a Tbsp cider vinegar instead, and used cashews instead of almonds. Didn't have lemon either, but still good! Very important to poor the grease off as the recipe says. Good leftovers too!
