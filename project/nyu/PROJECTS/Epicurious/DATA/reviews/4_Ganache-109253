First of all, super simple. I made the smaller recipe and the quantity was perfect for some Passover brownies. Secondly of all, just fantastic. I wanted a frosting so I whipped 1/2c. cream and folded it into the ganache making a very simple mousse. Amazing. Would be good with up to a T. of coffee and or cinnamon and or some liquor as well.

i use this for the filling for truffles. it has good texture. When you cover with cling film, please be sure to press it down to the surface of the ganache, getting most of the air out. it makes a big difference.

Brilliant. And so much easier than sifting icing sugar for buttercream (though I still like buttercream). I will be making this more often!

Used semi-sweet...yum. Stuffed between 2 vanilla bean sugar cookies. Excellent and special!

I love how this turned out!! I made this according to the recipe... except...instead of pouring into a bowl, I poured it into 3oz clear espresso glasses, filling only the bottom quarter/third of the glasses. Chilled as directed. Then I folded in an equal amount of stiff, very cold whipped cream to the remainder. After both had set, I spooned my make- shift mousse in on top of the ganache in the clear glasses. To serve, I put still- pourable whip on top and decorated. Beautiful layers in a clear glass. I used half semi- sweet, half unsweetened bakers chocolate. This was perfect for the base, but to sweeten up the mousse, I needed to sweeten the whip. One recipe (and only a few dishes to clean) for a very decadent, beautiful dessert!

Great staple for any baker. I would also recommend folding it into whipped cream while still slightly warm to make a light chocolate mousse or balling it up and coating it in chocolate powder or coconut or nuts to make truffles.

This is very, very good, but makes WAY, WAY more than enough for one 2-layer cake. Consider making 1/4 of the recipe at most.... You pour it (still liquid, just barely beginning to thicken) over a cooled cake, so it really takes very little. I made a sacher torte with it: two layers dark chocolate cake - cooled, raspberry jam for filling, ice with a thin layer of chocolate buttercream spread smooth, and then pour the ganache over and let it harden. Restaurant quality!

Warmed up a bit, it makes a divine topping for a bowl of vanilla ice cream and strawberries.

My dirty little secret: Make a cake out of a box. Nobody can tell when you top it with this simple, fantastic ganache.

Easy, no fail icing.

After this cooled a little, I whipped it in the stand mixer ( adding a little Amaretto ) and frosted Espresso brownies. Chocolate & chocolate & coffee---doesn't get any better!

The white chocolate note was exactly what I was looking for.
