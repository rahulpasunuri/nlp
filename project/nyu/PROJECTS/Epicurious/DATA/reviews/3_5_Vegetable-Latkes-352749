These are great. I just made them for a party at Temple and they were a huge hit. I first grated the potatoes and veggies in the food processor, and then in batches returned half and pulsed a few times with the blade. I also added an additional egg, which holds the batter together better. Parsley is a nice addition, too. I used my Lodge cast iron skillets and they cooked very well, with a nice crispy edge.

Omitting the parsnip and using onion instead of leeks, I got 12 very large latkes with this recipe, which is quick and easy and fine, although nothing outstanding.

Im going to be making these latkes pretty soon because I have all of the veggies needed as left over from holiday dinners. This is just a comment  Im a bit confused Im looking at the ingredients and the weight is almost 3 lbs so how could the recipe yield just 6 servings. I mean what is the typical size for latkes maybe 4 oz. So that would mean that 3 lbs would be like 12 servings. Whenever I look at a recipe I look at the total weight of the ingredients and then divide that by 4 oz (typical serving). I plan to cut this in half if not even less.

I've never made a decent potato pancake until this recipe. The addition of parnips and carrots makes this a nice side-dish for any dinner. Even my husband liked this one! And it's an easy way to include veggies in kids meals. Already passed this recipe on to other family members...with great results. A real hit!

This recipe confused me and I'm not sure it's that much better than the traditional potato latke. The main problem was that the recipe says that it yields 6, so I assumed it meant 6 latkes, so I tripled the recipe for 3 people and had mounds and mounds of it (probably made 50 or more). I personally also prefer a finer texture to my latke so if I were to make these again I'd run the vegggies through a food processor on grate and chop. Also there was a lot of separation of the liquid which I scooped out of the batter with a spoon. Didn't know if I was removing anything important: e.g., egg, flour, or if it was just water from the vegetables. I don't know about this one.

Oladki (or oladyee) - is yeast batter pancakes in russian. Latkah - is also a pancakes in different culture. Ukrainian resipe for potato pancakes tells to grate potatoes finely (we use now food processor, but it's not the same taste though) with onions adding flour and eggs. We fry them in sunflower oil for that nutty taste. For the topping always used sour cream, but I tried different one - cottage cheese with sour cream and green onions and dill. Delicious! Try another variety, little bit more complicated, but great taste. Prepare potato batter as usual. In another bowl make meet filling from pork, chicken or mix with onions and seasonings. Process in food processor adding water to make it very soft and fine. Then put a Tbs of potato batter in a pan, flatten, put a tsp. of filling in the centre and cover with potato batter. It will take little longer cooking time but it's worth it. Don't forget to turn over and cook on the other side. They will be juicy inside, crispy outside and delicious. Enjoy!

a latkah is a potato pancake. The variations all sound delicious and this one is no exception (and yes I use matza meal too) but then you are not making latkah. You are making vegetable pancakes. It is sort of like when a recipe comes out and the reviewers make numerous changes and then review the recipe. It isn't the same recipe that you are reviewing

Topping suggestions: Always top the latke with a dollop of sour cream, then put on other toppings. You could use smoked salmon, other smoked fish such as white fish, herring, etc. Caviar of pretty much any kind (salmon roe, sturgeon roe, either aevruga, osetra, or beluga, depending on your budget. Smoked oysters, and even canned sardines could work. Obviously yyou would drain any liquid from canned items.

These were a nice twist on the traditional potato pancake and had loads more flavor. I will definitely make these in the future in place of potato pancakes. One small complaint, and I knew this would be an issue from the quantities in the recipe, this doesn't make 6 pancakes or even serve six. I got 24 large pancakes (heaping 1/4 c. batter each)out of this recipe. Following the heaping spoonful in the recipe, I would have easily doubled that. This feeds more like 6-8 people easily.

Great! The combination of all of the vegetables gives a nice flavor. I made small sized latkes and used as an appetizer. I put a small dallop of sour cream and a bit of finely chopped dill on top of each. Does anyone else have another idea for a topping?

I've been making variations of this recipe for years. Only difference......never with flour. Always with matzo meal. "Tradition".

I've been making potato latkes since I first met my husband in 1969. It's the Same wonderful potato/onion combo made sweating over hot Crisco oil, sometimes with family members sipping a nice glass of white wine, then served with homeade applesauce. I tried this vegetable latke recipe and was so surprised that they were flavorful and a nice variation from the heaviness of all potato. Family really liked them. I used the ingredients called for but still used my Crisco (hard pack canned) A note: frying time is much faster than the all potato latke. I made them day before using, warmed up and crisped up nicely but in a 350 oven which I watched like a hawk!

Haven't make this particular recipe yet, but when making a different one that used zucchini, I made sure to squeeze out the moisture prior to adding to mixture. This allows them to brown up, stay together and not be soggy. Hope to try these and see if they hold up to the "potato fritters" my guys love so much!

To Steven, I've made basically the same recipe/technique with a mixture of zukes and yellow squash for years. Works great!

Could I substitute zucchini instead of parsnip? Steven

What a great recipe! I am always searching for new/healthy(ish) recipes for my kids and they absolutely loved this one. Definitely a keeper.
