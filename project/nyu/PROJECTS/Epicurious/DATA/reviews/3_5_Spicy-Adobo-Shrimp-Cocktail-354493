Made this twice, most recently for a family party, instead of the usual plain shrimp and cocktail sauce. Everyone LOVED it- from a hip 22yr old to a set in his ways 85 year old. Very ceviche-like and great with margaritas. Made as written adjusting for full pound of shrimp. Used seedless cucumber (maybe 1/2 cup sliced then quartered), 1/2 lg shallot instead of onion, an extra clove garlic, and jalapeno sauce instead of adobo. My new go-to shrimp appetizer.

This recipe is NOT GOOD. The sauce is overly sweet, which, when combined with the shrimp, makes for a gloppy, cloying taste that is the opposite of the refreshing taste you should be left with when eating a real ceviche. I love Gourmet's recipes - this is the worst one I have ever made, and there's no fixing it.

Loved this recipe. It is the perfect dinner on a hot evening. I am surprised that so many don't like the celery, as I find it a great flavor in this dish and not overwhelming at all. Make this all the time.

WE had a dinner party for 8 and everyone loved this. I put the celery in and the crunch was what made it soo unusual with the creamy of the avacado(whcih I doubled). I used halved grape tomatos and a frozen shrimp ring form Sams Club that I thawed, cut of the tails and cut each shrimp in half. Everyone asked for the recipe. Next time I may try to serve it with Trader Jpes Cilantro dressing instead of the Adobo sauce.

We really liked it, left out the celery as well. I don't like celery, so... I never heard of a "kirby" cucumber before, either. I had one of my pickling cukes on hand and used that, and lo and behold, that's exactly what a kirby cucumber is. I think the instructions should have made a note of it, said it was a pickling cuke. I cook and garden a lot too, this whole kirby thing was news to me.

i agree with the celery, but i would definitely make this again. it's quick, easy (especially if you get your shrimp already deveined and cooked) and is a hit with my 6 year-old. i would probably not include the celery next time and sub it with jalapenos instead.

This was fine. I didn't think the celery went with the other ingredients in the dish, although my husband did not find the celery flavor to be overwhleming or mis-matched, as I did. Overally, this was a decent light summer supper, but I won't be making it again.
