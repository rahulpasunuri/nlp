Really good. Fits the same ecological niche as rice pilaf but, you know, different. I realized too late that I was out of walnuts, subbed pecans and it was righteous though not properly Russian. We had our kasha with poached salmon and sour cream dill sauce, a combination I recommend. Here's a helpful tip I learned from elsewhere on the internet: sometimes kasha is called just plain buckwheat on the package, and sometimes you see buckwheat that isn't kasha. If it's reddish-brown, it's kasha. If it's greenish-white, it's raw buckwheat and you need to toast it in the oven first.

A solid three. Easy, and tasty. I guess that there's not much that one can do with buckwheat, but this seems to elevate a very pedestrian grain. The toasted walnuts give it a smoky flavor. Consider adding scallions for color, and of course other vegetables, though it would change the flavor at that point.

Prepared as written, it was delicious. I ate it with a bit of smoked trout - great complement.

A simple classic. Believe the recipe when it says to chop the onions coarsely - you don't want the pieces finely diced. You could also experiment with increasing the amount of onion called for. Don't overload it with the walnuts though.

LOVED this. Earthy good. The onions and herbs and walnuts are a perfect compliment. My 8 and 10 yo wanted 3rds!

This was good. Nothing that I am in any hurry to make again, but it was a nice change from the typical grains I serve and I will keep the recipe for another day I feel like something healthy and different.

Very easy & simple to make. Top with yogurt and it's delicious. Dried fruit or other spices may used to create more intense flavors.

Excellent, easy. Takes the bitter edge off of the kasha. I added lots of golden raisins for flavor.

My first Kasha - that egg coating really helped to allow it to cook in a way that is not gruel-like. Did it with almonds , added chopped apricots and a splash of hot sauce . Next time I would make even more caramelized onions in it.

I could barely stand to have this in the house. Perhaps I just don't like kasha - this was my first try. Still, i usually like healthy foods (love barley, quinoa and kashi cereal) so I thought I would love this too. Sorry..not for me.

The addition of cut up dried apricots made this dish a keeper (go for the kind from Trader Joe's - they're less sulphury) as it added nice sweet and sour balance to the ground pepper and salt. I also did a quarter cup of pine nuts + a half cup of walnuts and added more ground pepper. Great combination of textures as well. And hella healthy, yo!

I love this. So satisfying and nutty with a little crunch from the walnuts. I could sit and eat the whole recipe. Maybe I'll make it as a side dish at Christmas. If you like trying different grains, you'll love kasha. I think this is a good recipe to try if you are unfamiliar with kasha. Maybe I would add a pinch more salt.

I've already made this twice. The first time was tasty, but a little bland. The second time I added raisins and diced dried apricots, which ratcheted up the comments from 'good' to 'delicious', even from my husband who recoils at the sight of dried fruit! It's a different and tasty side dish which I plan to make part of my regular repertoire.

Very tasty. A little tedious to make for a side dish, but I'd definitely make it again.

Great - tasty, and very easy side dish. Wonderful nutty flavor and fluffy texture. I used toasted pine nuts in place of walnuts since my husband doesn't care for walnuts and I'd definitely do that again. We have made kasha before with mushrooms and onions but chose this recipe because I was serving it with a fish with a mushroom topping and wanted the contrast of the crunchy nuts. Beats pasta or rice as a side dish any day.

This worked just right - great taste, light and fluffy texture. I think it's more like 6 servings than 4. Very good!
