I loved this when it was first published, but I lost the recipe. I'm glad it finally dawned on me that I might find it on the internet. It is really good, even if you are a fan of "classic" rice puddings.

I have never tried rice pudding before, so maybe I just am not a big fan of the stuff... but personally the chocolate flavor seemed odd. I WAS able to cook it for 45 mins, and it became thick and creamy in that time. Next time I want chocolate pudding though, I am reaching for the jell-o instant box!

This is a great pudding. The cinnamon flavor was perfect. I defied the recipe and used skim milk (but added 1T of butter) and it turned out beautifully. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate, so I used 10T of cocoa and 3T of butter instead, and 1/3 cup of sugar-- worked great. I also added 1/3 cup of slivered almonds. It is a very rich dish-- so I would serve it with a little whipped cream! YUM! However, it did take 1.5 hours for the rice to reach proper texture.

This recipe was a real disappointment. The rice never reached the proper texture, the pudding lacked volume, the flavors were too intense and and the final product was unattractive.

This recipe was inaccurate (or my stove is really off!); the rice was NOT cooked by 45 minutes, and the recipe didn't describe well enough what "done" looks like. (The rice and milk should come together like a thick porridge). I had to look it up in Joy of Cooking! (I've never made rice pudding before.) The chocolate flavor is strange, if you like traditional rice pudding (very sweet)
