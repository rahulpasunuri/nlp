These were fantastic - a fast, easy, and forgiving dough, and a tasty balance of chewy and tender. I forgot the second batch in the oven and left them in there ten minutes too long, and they were still amazing - a bit crisper, of course, almost like a large cracker, which went perfectly with a pre-dinner glass of wine. The softer ones were also yummy, and could be split to make a nice sandwich. Will be making these again and often, plus experimenting with other toppings.

There is nothing Parisian about this recipe that awakened childhood taste memories of my paternal grandmother's 'tsibele kuchen' - onion rolls that looked and tasted exactly these - which she baked every weekend. My only adjustment was to lightly saute the onions in the 2 tbsp oil. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly, and enjoyed an onion roll I hadn't had since 1964. These would make excellent sandwich or burger buns, but for that I'd fold the dough over the onions to keep them from falling off, and then maybe sprinkle the poppy seeds on top.

This isn't really like focaccia because of the eggs in the dough (or, at least, I've never made focccia with eggs in the dough). But, it is delicious. I ended up using it s buns for some grilled portabellas and it withstood the juiciness of the mushroom.
