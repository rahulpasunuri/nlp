This was delicious. I made up the dressing and marinated the kohlrabi for several hours before cooking the kale. To serve I poured off as much dressing as I could onto the kale, then served on a platter alternating strips of kale and kohlrabi disks,(instead of tossing all together) and sprinkled the pistachios on top. Looked great, tasted great, served to 4 people as a side salad and had none leftover.

Because our urban garden is growing both kohlrabi and kale, I was looking for a unique recipe. We know that kale isn't delicate spinach. We were prepared, and we found this dish to be colorful -- pretty and tasty. I did take the suggestion of reviewers and used walnuts instead of pistachios. The stronger-tasting nut was a match for the other flavors, and lime contributed the perfect zing. I'll do this again!

The first problem with this recipe is that I didn't have a slicer, so I cut the kohlrabi into matchsticks and boiled them for a couple minutes. Another problem was that the pistachios were lost to me. Maybe I cut them too small? I even added extras. I think the biggest problem with this recipe, however, is that I just don't like kale. No matter what I do with it, kale remains bitter and tough. I try to eat more, I just can't do it. I think if the kohlrabi were finely sliced it would have integrated better with the kale.

Only one person out of four liked this dish. Kale too rubbery with the cooking time listed. I quartered the kohlrabi slices and they were still disproportionately large compared to the kale. just a very odd dish.

Wow. This was absolutely delicious. Everyone begged for the last spoonful, including the kids. Responding to an earlier review, as ALWAYS with garlic, let it sit alone in the hot oil for just a few SECONDS, lest it burn. The kale will be tender if you let it really cook fully. I followed the recipe closely, and it was perfect. Best green-veggie recipe I've ever had! Wonderful blend of flavors.

This was a great, refreshing summer dish. I converted two friends who were unfamiliar with kohlrabi into fans. Easy to make, and tasty. I feel that the pistachios didn't add much to the dish, so would consider them optional.

I do not understand these reviews. This recipe was horrible. I could not wait to get home with my co-op Kale and Kohlrabi to try this recipe. My mom and I happily made this together and could not wait to try it. We took one might and tossed the entire thing.

This was amazingly easy and delicious. Recommend cutting skin off of the kohlrabi (easier) and slicing julienne style. Substituted smashed, salted almonds instead. Even my kids enjoyed it. Will make again soon!

Absolutely Delicious. The lime really gives the dish a great flavor.

This was delicious. I sliced the kohlrabi somewhat thicker, as I don't have a mandoline, and tossed it with the kale while it was still warm to soften it up a little bit. For the pistachios, I used salt-and-pepper roasted pistachios and left them whole. Really much better than I expected -- I will definitely make it again.

Have returned to making this recipe again and again. It is super tasty, very healthy, easy, and, in my opinion, just special enough for company. I love kale but this was my first time using kohlrabi and what a delicious veggie it is. I agree with another reviewer that it gives you something to chew, but that is one of the things I love about it--not mushy, just full of body.

yummy. kale and citrus dominate, the pistachios got lost (maybe pecans or walnuts instead). thin sliced kohlrabi was good call, but matchsticks might hold their own against the kale.

I got kale and kohlrabi from my farm co-op and this was perfect. A great late Spring companion to a grilled piece of fish, we had salmon but I'd imagine it would be good with pretty much anything. The lime is great, very bright addition to the salad. A very fresh and Summery way to serve kale.

We've made this twice and liked it both times, though we didn't have pistachios either time. The second time I used some feta to fill it out and offer some flavor contrast, and that worked quite well with the orange zest & juice. I think it would probably be good if you threw the pistachios in with that. Also, if you very thinly slice the kohlrabi, it can make a good visual contrast to the finely chopped kale.

This tasted almost raw and much too chewy to enjoy. I suspect the kale would turn out more crisp and crunchy cooked longer in more oil -- or even deep fried until crisp. Furthermore, I've never figured out how to keep garlic from burning in hot oil, because when it does, it becomes bitter. And perhaps the kohlrabi would benefit from a few minutes of steaming. In any case, the recipe, as is, was inedible for me and my husband.

Had kale and kohlrabi from our CSA. What a great combo with the pistachios!

I used a mixture of kale and swiss chard, and a mixture of julienned turnip and kolrabi. What a colorful and tasty dish. The pistachios were key. The dish would lose it's beatiful color and crunchiness with a different nut

this is easy and excellent. the lime and pistachio maks it.

I left off the pistachios since I didn't have any, but I am not confident that they would've made this a 4 star dish. It was fine to eat, but I wouldn't serve this to guests without making it several times to tweak the recipe.

Made it tonight, but didn't have pistachios on hand, nor a mandoline (on vacation here...) It was very tasty, and enjoyed even by the children. I will definitely make this again, and give the pistachios and thinner kohlrabi a try.

Also really good with orange instead of lime. I just used the kohlrabi greens instead of kale--they're basically the same thing. Also, kohlrabi and kale aren't just in the same genus, they're the same species--along with broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, cabbage...

This was surprisingly good. I substituted the kohlrabi greens and some beet greens I had for the kale, threw in a few sauteed turnips I had, and followed the advice from another review to serve over quinoa. Very good vegetarian main course.

I absolutely loved this recipe. We get a ton of chard and kale in our weekly vegetable box and sometimes I have a hard time deciding what to do with it besides adding it to stir fry. This was a great alternative and a really wonderful way to enjoy some fresh kale. The pistachios were also a nice touch to add some crunchiness to it all.

Pretty tasty and easy. We served it over quinoa and it made for an fairly filling dish. I used toasted almonds instead, cause that's what I had on hand, but I think pistachios would be great. Will probably make again, but not a stand out dish.
