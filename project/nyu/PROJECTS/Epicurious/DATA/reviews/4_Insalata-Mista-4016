This came out really well, some changes that I made were to use half as much fennel because its a very strong flavor, and to add slices of one red apple and sautee two large portabello mushroom caps to make this extra tasty!

Excellent salad. So easy to make and yet a hit everytime I serve it. Very attractive on the plate as well.
