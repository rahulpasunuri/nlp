I use this recipe often. Others have commented that the salmon isn't that good, that the cucumber sour cream is. I think the marinade - and I do love the taste - almost cures the salmon in a way. For that reason, I use Atlantic salmon rather than the less fatty Pacific king or Coho. I cook the salmon for 12 minutes instead of 14 so that it doesn't get over done. When I don't have cucumber, I have used just spinach and /or arugula in the sour cream - its quite good. I've also added a little bit of Dijon mustard when I don't have cucumber, and that works well too. Enjoy!

I gave this two stars because the salmon is a one star and the cucumber sour cream is a three star. The marinade does very, very little for the salmon besides provide a bit of color. I wouldn't bother with it agin. I noted that a lot of the reviews hardly mention the salmon, and with reason. It's just not worth the effort when there are so many other ways to cook salmon. The cucumber sour cream is very good. It is a tasty accompanyment to salmon and is good as a dip with veggies and pita.

This is a great, easy recipe. I've made it several times for holidays because it's easy to do ahead and it's always a big hit with everyone.

I made it last Sunday, very easy to make, no fishy smell in the kitchen, very tender to eat and tasty too, family just loved it. Will certainly make it again. Thank you

This has become a regular feature in our house. It is perfect and easy. I usually half the sour cream sauce because it it is very rich so you don't need much, its a shame for it to go to waste. Great for just the two of us, lovely for dinner guests.

this recipe is perfect as is, simple and delicious.

as others stated, too much mustard. I cut the amount in the recipe in half and it was still too much. The sauce was bitter, probably from the arugula. If I tried it again, I would omit the arugula and try only a quarter of the mustard. Even then, I think it still needs something.

Nice and easy recipe. I used plain yogurt rather than sour cream and halved the mustard. I omitted the spinach because I didn't think it would add to the overall flavor of the dish. This would be great for summer bar-be-ques on the patio and the sauce could go over grilled chicken just as well.

Love this recipe for Cucumber Sour Cream! We made it exactly as the recipe reads, except for using more cucumber than called for. We wanted it to be a more substantial side dish, instead of just a sauce. Yum. The salmon preparation was nothing special.

I've made this a number of times and just love it! Have had rave reviews from friends. Would cut the mustard in half, and can substitute spinach for arugula.

I wasn't planning to keep this recipe, but I ended up making this one night because we had all the ingredients on hand, save for the arugula. Just doubled the spinach and it was great. Next time I would make a 1/2 recipe of the sauce. I thought the flavor on the salmon was perfect, and my fiancé asked me to make it again after just one bite!

Very very easy and really good. Made it for a large party and everyone loved it, plus the easy prep and short oven cooking allowed me to hang out with the guests.

Big hit! The sauce is a MUST for the salmon. I also added couscous as a side dish so it didn't overwhelm the other flavors. GREAT and EASY

Fantastic recipe. Next time I will marinate the salmon overnight, although 2 hours seemed to be okay. Dressing was a big hit!

Rating: 2
Totally underwhelming. I didn't make the sauce, so maybe that was the missing link, but the marinated fish, while easy to make and moist, had no detectable flavor difference from unmarinated salmon, even though I gave it about 2 1/2 hours of marinating time. There are many better salmon recipes out there.

The salmon turned out very moist with good flavor. Nothing spectacular though. I thought the cucumber sour cream was horrendous, mine turned out a very strange green color and odd texture. Would make the fish again if I could come up with a different sauce.

This is a great dish! Especially for an Atkins dieter. My husband keeps asking me to make it again and again.

I've made this receipe 3x in the past month and have gotten rave reviews. Growing up in Seattle I am usually skeptical of salmon receipes but this one did a great job of enhancing the fish and the accompaning side sauce was clean and refreshing for those who choose to use it. All of the people we have served this to have asked for the receipe.

I think the orange flavor would be better with a different fish (tuna, swordfish, sea bass). IMHO roasted salmon is better with wine/choice of herbs; a little soy is okay for flavor.

Afraid I'm with the dissenters. The soy sauce glaze was ok, but the flavors didn't mix. Easy recipe which is always a bonus in my opinion. signed, The Reluctant Cook

This was pretty good. I love arugula, so this is a nice way to use it. The sour cream was very good! Still, my favorite salmon recipe on the site is the Salmon with Mango Salsa (or relish?).

Not a very good combination. The sauce on it's own was good, and the salmon on it's own was good, but, the flavors just didn't seem to blend properly.

Hey Canada, I thought it was funny. We loved this recipe -- the salmon was delicious and the cucumber sour cream was superb. I often make adjustments to a recipe, but I wouldn't change a thing here. Quick, fabulous and looks beautiful!

Sorry to be the dissenting vote - we just found this to be okay - certainly tasty enough and easy, but nothing spectacular.

Hey Canada: too much information. In other words, "so what."

Awesome dish! For a few reasons...1) I'm a relatively new "experimental" cook, meaning I've finally grown up enough to make things other than what my mom taught me as a kid, and this was easy. 2) I don't eat red meat, which means I'm always looking for meals that will satisfy my meat & potatoes boyfriend, who is my somewhat willing guinea pig, and 3) Previously mentioned boyfriend is pretty picky about what he eats - scared I'm going to sneak tofu into something. Which always puzzles me, because his favourite sandwich is microwave-made "grilled" cheese with value brand Thousand Island Dressing!! Anyway, this dish fulfilled ALL our requirements, definitely making this again!

Thought this was easy to prepare and had good flavor. I used spinach only in the sauce - couldn't find arugula --- the sauce was refreshing - I wouldn't serve the salmon without it.

Our son in CA loves to cook, and is very good. He is also a subscriber to your magazine. He mad this dish for us, and we thought is was wonderful, probably better than any of the other suoerlative salmon dishes he has made for us over the years. Highly recommended.

I am not a seasoned cook (pun intented :), however, I found this recipe very simple for beginners. I tried it and bravely invited my in-laws to dinner due to the shining reviews. They went on an Alaskan cruise last summer and ate salmon fresh out of the ocean. My father-in-law said my salmon was better than that which he ate on the ship. It was soft, moist and very flavorful. My mother-in-law doesn't like soy sauce and was apprehensive to try it. She raved as well, telling me the soy sauce was very suttle. She asked for the recipe and said she is adding it to her repertoire. What a compliment! I followed the recipe exactly...marinate for 2 hours only and in the oven for exactly 14 minutes. To my delight, even the thin edge of the fillet was moist. I will definately serve this dish again.

Salmon was delicious. Made the sauce two ways, with and without the arugula (since I don't like arugula). Sauce without arugula was still great. Easy recipe.

Very easy to prepare, and the results are wonderful. Great for impressing on short notice. In fact, I didn't have enough time to marinate for the 2 hours called for, so I only marinated for 30 minutes. The salmon was still delicious.

I made this on Good Friday for my parents who have eaten all over the world. They raved. The salmon was tender (even the thin sections), the sauce was awesome. Did the potatoes and a salad (not a fan of snap peas). Easy too. A real keeper.

This was quick and easy. The salmon had a beautiful galze, but try oiling the foil to keep the skin from sticking to it.

I used half the amount of salmon but the whole amount of marinade. Only soaked in marinade for 2 hours, but like the cook who let it soak for 5 hours, thought that the marinade slightly overpowered the Coho salmon I used. But the pretty green sauce on top cut the saltiness a bit. I think I also used a pretty strong kind of soy sauce. Anyways...beautiful looking dish (gorgeous glaze on the salmon), and so easy to make that perchance next time I will follow the recipe precisely.

Salmon lovers look no further! I tripled the recipe and marinated 7lbs of filets for at least 2hrs before roasting for a mere 14 minutes and results were beautiful to behold and utterly toothsome. I didn't like the sauce at all and will skip it in future. Killer buffet item!

I thought this recipe was very good and easy to prepare. I made it for guests and they really enjoyed it. I served it with asparagas. The first time I made this recipe, I marinated the salmon for 2 hours. The second time I marinated it for 5 hours. I thought it was much better when I only marinated it for 2 hours because the flavors were more subtle. The salad that accompies the recipe is very good. Enjoy!

When I received my new Bon Appetit in the mail, this was the first recipe we tried. It was very easy to make and quite good. The colors are very spring. We will be serving it on Easter with an asparagus recipe in the same magazine.

very mediocre. making the sauce with just arugula would probably be better. My husband and I agreed that it was not a keeper.

Glad to be one of the first to rate this recipe. I have made it 3 times & the the recipe just came out. I have made it with just argula (which I prefer) & just spinach. Have not put both together. Excellent recipe. I entertain a lot & everyone has liked it.
