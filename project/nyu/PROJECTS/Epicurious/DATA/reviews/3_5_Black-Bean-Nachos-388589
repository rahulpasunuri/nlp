This is easy and delish! DIdn't have teh roasted peppers or green onion. Used 1 chipotle pepper in adobe sauce.

I made this with prepared salsa (hot variety) and canned chipoltle sauce with adobo sauce. It was WAY too hot. If I made it again I'd get a milder salsa and opt for the roasted jalapeño instead.
