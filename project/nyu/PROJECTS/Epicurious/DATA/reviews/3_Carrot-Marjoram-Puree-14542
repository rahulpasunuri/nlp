I put the carrots through a ricer and then stirred that in with the rice--gave it a perfect consistency. Done like that it makes a solid side dish

This was very simple, mild but tasty. The texture might not appeal to some people--a thick, smooth, but clingy paste. My little boy thought it was thicker than baby food...

Perhaps the carrots I used just weren't sweet enough, or maybe I used too much rice, but I found this dish too mildly flavored for my taste. I stirred several tablespoons of maple syrup into it, and that seemed to perk it right up. And surprisingly, my husband (who's not a big fan of carrots) thought it was great. So I'll definitely make it again.

An extremely simple recipe which is rewarding in both its simple taste and wonderful texture. Though your guests may feel compelled to make references to "baby food", most of them will probably ask for seconds. P.S. I strongly recommend against freezing this. I did so with leftovers in a tupperware container and a week later when I emtied it out for reheating, all I had was this inedible fibrous sponge!
