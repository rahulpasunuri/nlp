I usually omit the calamata olives but I have served this salad to many people and they've all enjoyed it very much.

This is a great salad. I also added roasted beets and fennel for a bit more color/flavor.

I have made this salad several times and it is always a hit. It is light and the lemon dressing compliments the vegetables very nicely. The olives are a nice touch - I've used kalamata before and that made it even better.

This is a very easy, basic salad. I too added blue cheese. It was excellent!

I just have to respond to Denise, in a spirit of camaraderie. This is no Cobb Salad. The two ingredients that set aside a Cobb Salad from others are crumbled bacon and crumbled bleu cheese...neither of which are in this. It's a great salad, but as a lover of Cobb Salad, "this ain't it"! And by the way, yes, I DO remember the Brown Derby!

Good basic recipe that I will use often. It was tasty and light. I chopped everything long and thin (kind of like slaw), added thinly sliced salame (julienne-style), thin sliced red onions, thin-sliced radishes, the lettuce, and the dressing. Good lunch.

I love this salad, and I make it, and variations of it frequently. For a nice presentation, try molding indivividual salads with a medium-sized funnel, or a small chinois. The sugary dressing aids in this.

C'mon everybody, don't you recognise this as a pre-tossed version of the famous Cobb salad served at The Brown Derby Resturant at Hollywood and Vine St.? The recipe was "invented" in 1936!!!! See Julia Child's "JULIA CHILD AND MORE COMPANY."

I have yet to prepare this recipe, but I intend to for the simple reason that the controversy over the reviews has piqued my interest. I'm afraid this has become "chop the reviewer" instead of "chopped salad". :) It took me five minutes to get to the original comment that created all the hullabaloo, and I'm afraid it was rather anti-climatic (sp?). Just another person expressing their opinion. To the others: why let this upset you so much?

Yum. I forgot how great chopped salads can be. I added a couple of diced chicken breasts and a some crumbled bacon. It was fantastic. An explosion of flavors in your mouth!

We had this for dinner last night and found it to be very flavorful. The combination of veggies and olives was interesting and well worth the effort of all the chopping. I only added 1/2 tsp. of sugar and lots of garlic otherwise followed the recipe. It probably serves 6-8 (not 4) as an accompaniment. I made the whole recipe for 2 people thinking we'd have it tonight as well. LOTS left over.

I liked the look and texture of the mix, but I didn't think much of the dressing.It was too bland and nothing special,I will use the recipe and use another dressng. I am still looking for the ultimate dressing and have not found it yet!

This salad was really good! It was super-simple to put together, had a nice combination of flavours and colours, and was perfect for company. It was also an ideal way of using up some of the vegetables in the crisper. I would definitely make it again. I imagine it would be nicely enhanced by adding some feta cheese or herbs to the dressing.

I can't believe some of the things people say on this site. What a tough crowd!! Anyway,I had all of these ingredients in my refrigerator today, and this salad made a great lunch. I added a pinch of oregano to the dressing, and crumbled feta to the salad. This would also be good with some grilled shrimp I think.

It just doesn't make sense that this "chopped salad" should be number one on the list. Good grief, it's just a salad and nothing special. At least the "fried egg sandwich" responses were tongue-in-cheek witty.

I made this salad on a whim because I liked the name "Chopped Salad." I wasn't really expecting to be surprised by the salad because it is just a tossed salad with a dressing. Nevertheless, I was surprised. It is a very pretty salad, and the cup of parsley and the dressing really make it a tasty salad. I chopped or diced everything, and I think that actually added to its visual appeal. I did seed my cucumber because I don't like watery salads. I made the salad up early and refrigerated it covered with saran wrap. Added the dressing when I was about to serve and gave it another toss.

I thought this was a great recipe. I heeded others' advice and added grilled marinated chicken and feta - delicious and a beautiful, colorful meal. I thought the entire point of feedback was for people to add their 2 cents ....

I can't believe all this fuzz just for a simple salad recipe. There are lots of chat rooms to waste your time and write about stupid things just because you don't have anything better to do. Use this one only to give advice about the recipes and don't waste the time of people who like what this site used to be like. Move your ...from the chair to the couch and watch Jerry Springer. You should be used to this people I'm sure they share the same air in the head as you.

To HEAVEN - Why are you rating the recipe 4 forks? You obviously didn't make it. This is exactly what people are bugged about here. Go ahead and comment on how hilarious all the chit-chat is, but don't rate the recipe if you haven't made it.

I'm always looking for new recipe for a good salad as they do get boring. I'm not by any means an experience cook, but am an experienced eater and love to try new recipe's. I was shocked to read all of the reviews. I know I would rather read about variations which make it taste better than reading about slammage to other reviewers. So as I tell my children, if you can't say anything nice, don't say it at all!

I thought this recipe was great. I love salads, and I will make this again. It went very nicely with grilled chicken and rice w/beans. Yum!

I would also suggest that Epicurious could play a better role in moderating the comments posted in this section. Other bulletin boards I participate in on the web delete irrelevant or unnecessarily hostile comments. Perhaps enforcing some posting standards (i.e. recipe-related comments ONLY, no personal attacks) would help!

I love to read the comments with these recipes. Usually it will determine if I try a recipe or not. But I do have to say that however boring this recipe may be, (according to comments) the comments were certainly spicy enough. I had to read all of them to see what all of the hub-bub was about. I think the first cook from Montreal (the one people were picking on) might be French and probably has trouble writing in english. Make sure you know the whole picture before picking on somebody.

I'm with the writer from Montreal! Leave your snide comments out of it. I am in my 50's and cooking for over 30 years. I am always looking for new recipes, whether it be a simple salad or a gourmet meal. I, at least, have learned that you can always learn something NEW!!

I always look out on how to make salads.Usually, i just have salads with juice of lemon, mainly because no matter how hard i try, i can never whisk up a decent dressing,that is,a dressing that i can relish.i am not a bad cook really,i'm just not sure why i can't make a dressing i like!I'm going to try this one's proportions out.

WHAT is the problem with reviewers like Seattle (& one of the earlier ones) & why does this website generate so many snide remarks & animosity ? I'm an experienced cook now, but can remember a time when I would have been grateful for some guidance on putting together a balanced salad. This is a perfectly OK recipe. Nothing to get excited about, but certainly not deserving of such pointless & silly responses. If you can't make any constructive contribution, why don't you just find some chat-room in which to vent your anger & leave this website to those of us who have open minds about food & accept that cooks of all skill levels need recipes.

this salad was amazing. throw in a chopped avocado and crumbled blue cheese and it was absolutely delicious!

Thought the recipe was a refreshing take on a Greek salad. To preserve the crunch and fresh flavor I used hearts of romaine and increased the ratio of lemon juice to oil slightly (there was no vinegar hence no need for vermouth)and reduced the sugar. Crumbled feta or ricotta salata would extend it to main course status but I think mozzarella is a bit too soft and bland to improve the flavor and texture.

Why do so many people feel the need to add their 2 cents worth on what would make this recipie better, its just a simple freaking salad, my mom taught me how to make salad when I was 8 yrs old its not rocket science, its a decent recipie but hardly complicated.

Rating: 2
I give this recipe "as is" 2 forks... but with the addition of fresh chopped basil, chopped roasted chicken and grated mozzarella this salad gets 4 forks. (And I also included the vermouth)

Noilly Pratt is a French brand of vermouth. It can be either sweet (red) or dry (white).

Rating: 0
Noilly prat is similar to dry vermouth. I think this recipe would be good with watercress instead of the lettuce for a stronger flavour.

Here's how I see this recipe I wouldnt add the chpped romain into the salad instead i would add chopped celery, and may be just the firn stem of the romain I would use the leaves rather to dress the plae,so thast they can keep their firmness.. Also I dont like adding sugar to my dressings..rather i would add a little noilly pratt to cut the sharpness of the vinegar.. I would also add different colored swwet peppars to enhance the visual aspect..
