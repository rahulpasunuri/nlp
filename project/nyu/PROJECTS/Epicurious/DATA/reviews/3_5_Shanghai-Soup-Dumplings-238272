A lot of work, terrible results. The sauce was very bad.

Like other reviewers I am a big fan of soup dumplings. This is a 4 fork recipe, but to get great results at home, you may want to "deconstruct" the dumplings. I made homemade broth the Edna Lewis way (Google the video by America's Test Kitchen for the method). It's quick, easy and much more flavorful than plain boiled broth. The problem with trying to make this recipe at home is that store bought dumpling wrappers are too small to fit a meat ball plus enough soup aspic to get the proper effect. The flavors, however, are AMAZING. I suggest this method as an alternative, much less frustrating & lots more satisfying: 1) Make your aspic broth 2) Make your meatballs and seal in dumpling wrapper like a regular potsticker WITHOUT the aspic, steam them as directed 3) Heat the broth to liquid form and place in a shallow soup bowl, then float the potstickers in the broth and add vinegar sauce to taste. OK you lose the soup dumpling squirt in your mouth, but you also get to enjoy ALL your lovely broth! Trying to assemble the dumplings with broth inside is frustrating & futile unless you can find wrappers that are at least 3 1/2" diameter. Using this modified method I will make this recipe again and again!

I'd've made these, really I would, but my time's been taken up making a life-sized re-creation of the Great Wall of China out of pencil sharpener shavings.

Delicious. Time-consuming but the flavor was really fantastic.

Just got back from San Francisco and was so inspired by the cuisine there that for a dinner party I was having, I wanted to re-create food that I had enjoyed on my trip. I had the most incredible Shanghai Soup Dumplings and this recipe is a great facsimile of what I ate. All guests raved about the dumplings and sauce (see below) and my honey, who didn't enjoy the SF dumplings as much as I, thought mine were better! I did substitute the sauce, re-creating the sauce that I had in SF: red chinese vinegar with thin sliced strips of ginger, marinated ovenight. I got the chinese red vinegar in a large local asian grocer (Super 88). Making this recipe, you do have to start the day before but I think that the results are well worth it!

After visiting China for the Olympics, my friends and I could NOT stop talking about the dumplings, and in particular the soup dumplings. I finally gathered all of the ingredients and followed this recipe. Like the previous reviewer I reduced four cups of stock, 1 beef, 3 chicken with the ingredients for about half an hour as a short cut. The next day I began assembly and let me tell you, it was fun and fascinating! We have a bamboo steamer and found that it took about 10 minutes. I need a better method for dicing the shrimp and pleating the wrappers but it's not going to stop me from making these again! Try the spicy asian pickle recipe for a quick and cool side to have. Obviously nothing will be the same as homemade wrappers but I don't care, this is so close!!

These dumplings are delicious! I was limited on time so I didn't make the broth the way the recipe said. Instead, I used 3 cans of stock. One chicken, one beef, and one vegetable. I added the garlic, green onion, wine and soy sauce, then let it reduce down for about thirty minutes. The next day, after the aspic set up, I made the filling and assembled the dumplings. I didn't mix the aspic cubes into the filling. I added a large cube on top of the filling, then wrapped up the dumplings. They had plenty of soup when they were steamed, which only took about 8-9 min. Time consuming but now that I know what I'm doing, I will definitely make them again!

I too am a very big fan of Joe Shanhai in NYC. I moved upstate last year thus ending my families every Sunday dinner there. The Chinese food her is not very good so me loving to cook as a hobby I decided to see if I could find a recipe on line and I found this one. I have made these plenty of times already but am only writing this review now. The recipe was not difficult to follow but is very time consuming. I have made the meat mixture quite a few times and used it to make dim sum, wontons, Shanghi rolls and dumplings. I have even put it in the freezer and it kept nicely. So the meat can be made well in the advance for future use. My only problem was the wrappers. I originally tried to use the dumpling wrappers from the Asian store but they were too thing and some of the soup came out of some of them. The bamboo steamer is best to use. I will make the wrappers next time. The exact vinegar from Joe's can be found in the Asian stores. Great Recipe you should try.

Delicious flavor! Be sure and use larger skins then 3" so you can add more of the aspic. Most of the dumplings didn't have much soup due to either leakage or absorption by the wrappers. Also, the wrappers were too wonton like so next time I will make my own dough. I must make this again!

Great recipe!! My boyfriend loved it. A lot of work put into it though. It was worth it in the end to see him enjoy it. =)

these were really good-- perfect for wintertime eating. i changed the recipe a little and used ground turkey instead of pork, and turkey ham instead of ham. the recipe *was* time-consuming. when i make these again, i would definitely cheat and use good store-bought broth, and just add in the flavorings and let it reduce for a while on the stove. also, DON'T keep adding water while you're cooking the broth-- it's just more water to get rid of in the end, and reducing the broth took forever. i also put the aspic cubes on top of each dumpling as i made them, rather then mixing the aspic with the filling. i had no problems cooking them-- they were perfectly done after the requisite 12 minutes in the steamer. about the dipping sauce-- i didn't end up liking black vinegar very much. it has kind of a fruity taste. so i would've preferred just plain soy sauce and ginger for dipping. again, the dumplings were delicious, but this (like any sort of dumpling-making) is a time-consuming process.

This was just not worth the time or effort. I've had the dumpling's from Joe's and these don't come close - at all. Maybe it was the wonton's or the overly sweet filling. Don't bother.

I love shanghai soup dumplings especially from Joe's Shanghai in NY City. From trial and error this is what I found to be easiest and most delicious. Use large metal steamers (from asian market), use carryout PHO broth, replace meat with can crab meat, shrimp, and ground chicken. Add extra onions, ginger, mushroom, and seasoning to your taste. Mix gelatin soup with filling. Dumplings do not have to be round, just sealed. Steam for 8 minutes, frozen for 10 minutes. Place lots of ginger and sauce in blender to get good ginger flavor. Enjoy... I make this 4 times a week now. LOVE IT!

This was somewhat a disappointment, even though the flavor of the filling is great and the consistency of the dumplings is nice, they all cracked during cooking and I had no soup whatsoever inside the wrappers. Which is very demoralizing after spending hours making aspic and filling, covering everything with damp towels and all this time looking forward to the result... I need to try this again. Maybe the wrappers weren't the right ones, after all, they seemed very thin, although it didn't say wonton on the package. Next time I'll ask at the Asian market before I buy.

Absolutely fantastic! People can't stop eating them. Better than any steamed dumplings we've had at really good Chinese restaurants.

gatorina: It means that you should incorporate the aspic cubes into the filling and then, when scooping the filling, make sure your scoop includes a few cubes. I actually found it easier to NOT incorporate the aspic and just add a few cubes on top, before sealing the dumpling. Great recipe and not as difficult as it appears.

I'm a little confused by the recipe as written. At one point, it seem to indicate that after cubing the aspic, one should incorporate it thoroughly into the filling. Then later, in the assembly section, it instructs us to place a few cubes of aspic alongside the filling. What gives? Either or both?

Couldn't enter all I wanted... 3. The cooking time was too long using my equipment, causing the "soup" to boil out of the dumplings. I don't use a bamboo steamer as I have a multi-tiered metal steamer that I picked up in Chinatown. Perhaps this made a difference; cook time for me was best at about 8 minutes, tops. 4. If you've never made pork/shrimp dumplings before, be advised that the fully cooked meat inside will be pink. 5. Use less meat filling than you think. The charm of Xiao Long Bao is the soup, so make sure there is room for plenty of the aspic. 6. The sauce is better made ahead as it allows the ginger flavor to permeate the sauce. 7. Dumpling wrappers must be protected from air once they are opened or they will dry out (amazingly) quickly. I keep mine in a Ziploc bag during the "production" phase. Once I've completed the dumplings, I keep them covered with paper toweling that I moisten with water and fully wring out. Dry dumpling wrappers crack and the result will be dumplings without soup. All-in-all a terrific recipe. Not suitable for a school night, but a lot of fun if you have the time.

I LOVE dim sum. Xiao Long Bao are kind of the holy grail for people who enjoy dumplings. When I saw this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it. Although time consuming, this recipe is not particularly complicated. For some, acquiring to the Chinese ingredients will probably be the most difficult aspect. A few notes: 1. The broth recipe, though good, takes too long. I use a recipe from Edna Lewis (you can google it) which involves sauteeing chicken pieces and onion and then simmering in a smaller quantity of water. Although I followed this recipe exactly as written, I would save about 2 hours of cooking time by adapting Miss Lewis' recipe next time, sauteeing the dry ingredients along with the chicken and onion. 2. The filling seemed a little flat, perhaps due to the amount of sugar. Because of my Americanized tastes, I would probably increase the amount of soy sauce and sesame oil in the filling (but only slightly) next time.
