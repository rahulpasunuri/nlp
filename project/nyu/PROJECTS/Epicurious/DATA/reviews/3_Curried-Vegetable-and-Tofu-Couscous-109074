I disagree with the previewer. I have made this recipe for years and have great success. Not only do I like the recipe very much, my guests give it rave reviews (my husband included) and there have been many requests for the recipe. It makes an especially colorful and very tasty lunch menu for guests.

I love couscous and tofu, but together? This was the worst recipe i have found on Epi. I wanted to use up some broccoli and red peppers so I decided to try. I have to admit I added curry powder to plain couscous as I don't buy boxed couscous, but just a terrible combination, spices aside. This is university student food at its worst. Please don't waste your time or money. ( I even went through the trouble of becoming a member just so I could comment on this.)

Loved this dish! It was really easy to make and was so delicious! Plus, it's easy to substitute other vegetables. I nixed the broccoli and added spinach and it was sooo good!

woops...I did added a generous amount of curry, black pepper, & sea salt to this recipe. Also VERY heavy on the cilantro. Together it made for a lot of flavor.

Cilantro is a must for this recipe! Make sure you eat this chilled, and let it sit for at least a day before servign for best flavor. I added 4 tablespoons of yellow curry myself.

My worst fear, a healthy but bland tofu recipe. This dish, although colorful, needs lots of other ingredients to spice it up. If I make it again, I will add black bean sauce, chili paste, soy, sesame oil and/or garlic sauce. You get the idea. Was very disappointed but not discouraged.

Don't even think about making this without the currants (or raisins)! I made regular couscous with 2 tsp. garam masala and a vegetable bullion cube. No need to add salt to the final product if you make it this way. Also substituted italian parsely for the cilantro - it seemed to make more sense. A great, simple, easy, healthy one dish meal.

Good, pretty quick, easy to have everything at hand and ready to go. Nice, as it was something different than the usual pasta we have during the week. We'll make this again.

This is a wonderful weeknight dish! The flavors were good (if you don't want to use a boxed mix, you could replicate it using plain couscous and a couple of teaspoons of garam masala) and the dish, as stated before, was pretty and colorful. I added a minced clove of garlic with the other vegetables, and I tossed my sauteed tofu with a bit of soy sauce and nutritional yeast to give it some flavor. All in all, not fine cuisine but a yummy meal all the same!

So good ! This dish is beautiful and SO easy to make. I served it with naan, mango chutney, and spinach salad with raisins, apple, orange slices, & a dressing with the same curry & chutney flavors. Delish!

Have made this a couple of times with some modifications - we aren't fans of red peppers or cilantro, so I omitted those and made regular couscous and added 1 tsp of curry powder. The result is a tasty, very pretty dish that finally made me try cooking tofu on my own. Will make again!

This is a great dish! The couscous is easy to find and super easy to make. The yellow of the couscous with the green veggies and the golden tofu pieces AND the red peppers makes a gorgeous dish. I don't understand the criticism...it's easy, tasty, and a really pretty dish. I will make it often. I did sub. raisins as I could not find currents in my store.

Who wants to use couscous in a box? Someone who realizes that making your own couscous is a fairly daft idea? Fresh pasta really is overrated anyway, and by definition couscous is dried. Please. Being a food snot went out with neon hightops and power lunches. This is a great dish for a quick meal..very flexible and pretty tasty. It's even faster than waiting on the pizza to be delivered. If tofu isn't your style, try a few bits of cooked chicken.

Terrible recipe. Who wants to buy "currried couscus ina box" what happened to making things from scratch. and what kinf of currant did they mean? terribly written recipe. though it has promise, i will adapt it somehow because it does sound interesting. as it is written, i will not make it.

Cous Cous can be found with the rice in the supermarket. It is made of semolina like pasta but closer to rice in size.
