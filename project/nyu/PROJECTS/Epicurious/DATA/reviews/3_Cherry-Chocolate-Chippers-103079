These are a favorite and always turn out for me. I wonder if those who have trouble with the cookies not spreading are going a bit heavy when measuring the flour? I have noticed I have to go lighter on the flour when cooking in washington, compared to when cooking in new mexico. The humidity in wa or the altitude in nm?

Tried this recipe tonight and the cookies are tasty but the batter baked a tad too dense. And I would agree that they are on the dry side. Is it possible that the recipe actually calls for baking SODA, not powder? Not sure of the chemistry behind it... sounds like we need Alton Brown to answer this question.

These were just OK. I had problems like some other reviewers with the cookies not spreading well, even when I flattened them a bit before baking. I think there is an excess of chips and cherries relative to dough. I definitely prefer the original tollhouse cookies to these.

I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of crisco and the consistancy came out fine. I also baked them for only 10 minutes on an un-greased cookie sheet. I think they are really good.

I've made these cookies several times since the recipe appeared in Gourmet...they always disappear quickly in my house :)

these cookies were really delicious and a big hit in my house - I added a 1/2 cup of dried coconut and they were great - I will definitely make them again!

I like the idea of cherry chocolate chip cookies but not THIS recipe. The cookies never spread out and the dough is very sticky. I also found that they easily burn on the bottoms. If you are going to make them I highly suggest using parchment paper. But better yet... just use a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe and add the dried cherries.

A nice change from plain old chocolate chip. In deference to my husband, who likes his cookies chewy, I substituted karo syrup for the white sugar. The cookies spread less and remain soft even with baking 12 minutes, long enough to brown them. Also, I was low on dried cherries, so I substituted dried cranberries with wonderful results. I will make these often.

I, too, was excited to try the recipie (though the other review made me skeptical). I'm so glad I went ahead and tried them - they were wonderfull! Every one in my family loved them from the chocoholic dessert fan to the sweet-hating meat and potatoes type. I found abot 10 min. to be long enough bake time.

I was really excited to try these cookies. Unfortunately, they were a little drier and thicker than I normally prefer. Next time I am going to try them with more butter and maybe less baking soda.
