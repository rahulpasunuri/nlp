I love papadams. The south Indian version are smaller and need to be fried - the north Indian version may be fried or roasted over open fire or in the microwave. I buy mine at my favorite store indianfoodsco.com. Nice selection there. If you have not had papad - you must try this crispy wonder

to those ppl who said they wanted the real recipe for papad...my grandmother used to make them from scratch. believe me even if u are an extremely experienced cook, it is not worth the effort to make these from scratch. it is a very hard, long and labourous process and the ones in the store taste better.

A really easy way that my Indian-Canadian family prepares the papadams is to nuke each one individually in the microwave for about a minute. The papadam is done once it starts bubbling or blistering all over. They still turn out nice and crispy.

it would be wonderful if you gave a recipe on " how to make" the pappadams from scratch!!!

making your own pappadums is an *extremely* laborious process. and one needs a hot dry indian summer for papad-making! in my home, we use store-bought lentil papads, but we do make several different kinds of sun-dried wafers (called "vadam" in tamil) with other ingredients like rice, wheat, potatoes, and other vegetables. they are all delicious. they are pretty laborious too, but get your family to pitch in and your job's done. well worth the time and effort.

Making papad at home is very laborious. So most people in India end up buying them pre-made. In the "good old days" when they were made at home, it took several days to make the paste of lentil or rice with spices, roll them out ultra-thin, and then dry them on the rooftop. You need very hot, dry, weather or they will spoil. I mean temperatures like 45 deg C and NO humidity, i.e. similar to the height of the Indian summer before the monsoon season. To the cook from Louisville KY, papads are NOT equivalent to Indian bread. They are considered a crunchy snack like chips.

When I was in an indian shop purchasing some dal. They had prepackaged pappadams at the counter. The woman there suggested I get some. And I told her I didn't like fried foods very much.She then told me to just pop them in the microwave. The crisp up much better and are more better for me!!! And it worked. I put them in for about 30-45 secs!

I live in Jamaica and Indian food is also part of our culture many people make rotis and more from scratch but I am unfortunate not to know anyone who makes pappadams, I really got into these when living in England. It would be good to have a recipe on HOW TO MAKE because I already know how to cook the pre-packaged ones. Any help?

I discovered pappadums at our local English shop. I also found them at several Ralph markets. If you have the opportunity to have a well stocked tuck shop in your area, you will be able to find these items in several flavors ie. plain, garlic and pepper. Maybe not homemade, but delicious.

Although I too would appreciate a 'real' recipe, my experience is that the vast majority of people who live in India who eat papads (pappadams) buy them prepackaged. I just came back from a visit to Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and only met one woman who talked about making them from scratch. The people I met who did not have access to markets where papads were sold simply didn't eat them!

Ditto. There must be a real recipe for this delicious bread. I've got two ideas: ask the chef who prepared it for me at Twinn Farms in Vermont, or ask the Cambridge Culinary Atrs School where they offer a class on Indian bread.

I was looking for a recipe on how to make pappadam. This recipe said to buy them at a store. That's o.k. if there is a store that sells pappadam near your house. Maybe someone could send in a recipe on how to actually make the pappadams! I sure would appreciate it.
