This was a nice way to make garlic mashed potatoes, but I found that it was too shallot-y. I even cut the shallots in half, and I thought it was still too much!. Add a bit more garlic and cut the shallots in half and you'll be pleased.

My family REALLY liked this, including the 6 and 7 year olds. I found it needed more salt and pepper than the recipe called for, and milk worked better than reserve liquid for obtaining the right consistancy. Very nice dish.

Made this last night with roasted chicken and green beans. Yum yum

Made these last night with steaks and they were loved by all. Pureed the shallots and garlic with a bit of cream before adding to the potatoes. Will definately make again.

My best friend's father made this dish. He prepared it just the way the receipe details. It is great with sirloin tip roast, salad, and homemade dinner rolls.

I didn't like this recipe at all. That may be because I omitted the butter (to lower the cholesterol) but I found the recipe very bland and uninteresting. Too bad, since I love garlic and shallots.
