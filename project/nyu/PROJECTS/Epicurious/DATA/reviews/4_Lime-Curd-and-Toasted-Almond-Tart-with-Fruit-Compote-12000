I made the lime curd and stirred it with whole milk Greek yogurt. It is delicious over the fruit - whatever is seasonal.

Help! I love the flavor of the lime curd, but it's very runny, I am doing something wrong? I cooked it for a long time and also addes some potato starch, but it was still very runny. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks.

I made this for Passover for the second year in a row (I used mandel bread instead of vanilla wafers). I decorated it with strawberries. Although the lime curd was somewhat runny, it got rave reviews. It was the #1 dessert, even for the chocoholics at the table (I also made a flourless chocolate cake). This is a must-try! As to the person who used the regular pie plate, instead of a tart pan with a removable bottom, nut crusts usually won't work in a regular pie plate.

A nice simple dessert recipe. With respect to the concerns about the curd being runny - in most instances, this will be the result of not cooking the curd sufficiently. The whisk should leave a perceptible mark in the surface of the curd and the curd should be a pale yellow color before you remove it from heat.

Lime curd was good but runny. Not having a 9" tart pan, I used a glass pie pan--big mistake--couldn't get it out. Fruit compote was good but apricots and bing cherries were not available in my markets during April. Substitutions were fine however.

My bookclub LOVED this recipe. In fact, am making it again for one of the members b-day. It looks great and it is really easy to make.

The crust is particularly delicious. I use only raspberries rather than make a complete compote. The tart itself is scrumptious.
