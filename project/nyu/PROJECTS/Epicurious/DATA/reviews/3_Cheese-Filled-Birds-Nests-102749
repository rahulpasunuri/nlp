Even though I'm just an "anglo" I'm pretty obsessed with anything involving kataifi, so it was fun to actually get my hands dirty with it this time! I thought the overall flavors were good, although if I try this again, I will opt for a 1/4 cup measure since I ended up with only 22 pastries, and they ended up spreading out quite a bit. They also were a little tricky to get she shape right for the cheese to not merely just go on top. I'm hoping the smaller measure will enable a bit more control. I also wondered if it could have used a bit more butter when preparing the kataifi; some spots looked a little dry to me after tossing. They're not kidding; you need a very big bowl to work with! And a vacuum. The recipe mentioned by the Egyptian cook sounds like things I've tried at Greek or Turkish festivals, and is where my obsession with the stuff stems from! Good luck!

I came on the website searching for a recipe for kataifi nests since I lost the recipe I used last year. I made them at Easter and instead of filling them with cheese filling as suggested in this recipe, I filled them, when cooked and cool, with an arrray of chocolate eggs and jelly beans. While this recipe is not what I was looking for, it reminded me that the nest recipe I was trying to recall was simply kataifi, melted butter, and a sprinking of sugar. My recipe called for making the nests in a muffin tin instead of mounds on a baking pan and they came out great (you have to experiment a bit - don't push the kataifi down too hard into the muffin forms). Easy to make and a fun treat at Easter.

I am a very good Egyptian cook, but not in my wildest dream I thought I would see a receipe for Kataifi like this one. First it is very confusing, and there is no way you can make this amount with one pound. You should all come over and try mine, my six grandchildren love it. I think you should explain to any cook how to handle kataifi, by the way it is NOT shredded phyllo, but a thin dough that goes through a special funnel with holes over a round stove or heat generating element, so it looks like hair. Some supermarkets carry Kataifi and the best way to handle it is to break it frozen in the food processor for 1 pound add 1 1/2 stick melted butter and pulse, voila!!! divide in two parts and press the first layer in a round cake tray add ground nuts or custard or ricotta filling then the second layer and bake at 350 until nice and golden, invert in a plate and add the syrup. Enjoy. To the cook from Brooklyn, I am back to help, what you have is phyllo dough which is good for baklava or any savory finger food, fill it with feta cheese and roll it like a cigarette, or mix spinach with cheese and a couple of eggs and make a pie with it. Have fun.

Hey Egyptian cook, tell me where you live and I will be right there!! This sounds too difficult to make. I have some phyllo dough leftover from another recipe and am looking for some way to use it. Any suggestions?

I did find kataifi in a Middle Eastern food shop. These were popular; my sister thought they were one of the best things she had eaten. I thought they were a bit too orange in flavor. I agree that there is no way to get 36 nests out of this kataifi. I think I'd like to try this stuff again with a different filling--more like the kataifi you see in Middle Eastern restaurants and groceries.

What a great little recipe! I ended up using twice as much butter as called for in the recipe, I think my kataifi dough was a bit dry from being in the freezer so long. The textural difference between the crispy kataifi dough, the ricotta cheese and the sweet syrup is so intriguing! A pound of kataifi dough will yield 36 pastries, but be careful not to overfill the nests as I did, I ran out of the cheese filling. Too bad, the remaining nests were eaten with ice cream!
