This was a beautiful and different breakfast dish. I started to use plan yogurt and then tried some creme frache that I happened to have and I thought that went great...similar flavor but thicker and not as runny. Next time I think I will also garnish with mint leaves or sprinkle chopped mint on top as well.

What a fantastic, easy recipe to keep with you through the years. Who doesn't like cinnamon and sugar toasted bread. To top it off with some healthy fruit is a huge bonus! Big Keeper!!

Due to a miscommunication with my boyfriend, i left the toast under the broiler too long and scorched them! I served the fruit on top of yogurt instead. Thank goodness it was just for him and I and not a dinner party! Anyways it was soo good and i can't wait to try it with the toast next time!

Oh my gosh! This is so good for being so simple. I used sour cream sweetend with 1 tsp. of sugar. I also drizzled 1/2 lime juice. I choped fresh mint from my herb garden & drizzeled rasberry flavered honey. Even my children raved about this.A keeper in this family of 6

I used raspberries instead of strawberries and a blackberry yogurt instead of plain yogurt. Yummm.

This is a fabulous addition to brunch! I used the juice of half a lemon on the fruit instead of the sugar and Vanilla yougurt instead of plain. Everyone agreed it was delicious!

Served this at a brunch for 14 people. Everyone loved it! I used a honey-wheat-walnut-rasin bread and instead of peach, used papaya -- it's a little mushier and helps all of the fruit stick together on top of the bread. Very easy to make, which makes it great for during the week or when you're serving lots of people.

I almost set my kitchen on fire the first time I tried this when I put the toasts under the broiler. Watch them carefully! Also, best if eaten immediately as they tend to get soggy quickly.

These are lovely little toasts. The contrast of the fruit with the crispness of the bruscetta is a real pleasure.

I made this recipe last night for an informal dinner party and it was the first thing to go!! Try adding nutmeg to the cinnamon mixture.
