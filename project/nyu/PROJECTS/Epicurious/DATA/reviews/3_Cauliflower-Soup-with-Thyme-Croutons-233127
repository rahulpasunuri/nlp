This came out very well. Sauteed one large shallot with a clove of garlic, added the milk and cauliflower and about 1/2 tsp. dried thyme. Needs heavy salt and white pepper, and a touch of chicken BTB and it was good to go. Thanks for previous reviewers' input.

A very simple and tasty soup, the croutons really add alot of flavor.

Very good. After reading the reviews decided I would start by sauteing a half an onion with a little olive oil, added one clove garlic, then proceeded with the milk (just milk no cream) and cauliflower. After tasting, decided a tsp. of chicken better than bullion was what it needed. I'll be making this again.

This was fast simple and easy to follow the soup was amazing! I used store bought garlic crutons, a simple and efficiant recipe!

Milky, even after advice from others and adding cayenne pepper. Not a do-over.

Taking the advice of previous reviews and doing a couple of additional things gave me a great soup. I started off by sauteing some garlic, red pepper flakes and 1/2 of an onion chopped. Then added the cauliflower and milk. I just used skim milk, which may have helped me avoid the milky taste others wrote about. I tossed in some of the fresh thyme when blending the soup, as well. All around a simple and tasty soup.

This is a lovely soup that needed a bit of help. As for the complaints that it tasted like milk - increase your cauliflower. I added some pepper and for presentation, I added a swirl of cheese sauce. Looked great and I have had many requests to make it again. It is a keeper - with these few adjustments.

Very bland as is; needed cayenne to give it a personality,The croutons are the main "spice".

I'm a personal chef, and made this for my clients who like blander foods. They RAVED about it. I actually omitted the cream to keep the fat content down, and blended in some white cannelloni beans for thickening.

Blah. Taste's like milk. Don't worry it can be saved, and made quite delicious I might add. Needed flavor so I added chicken better than bullion, gorgonzola, and finish off with white truffle oil swirled on top. YUM!! White pepper really adds also. I'm using a garlic peppercorn rustic bread for the croutons and using a long spear rather than cubes. I will finish it off with a dusting of chives. Serving as a pre thanksgiving treat...amusing the palate indeed. The finally is a four forker!
