Oh my gosh. I have found a new love and it is this potato salad. What a refreshing change of pace. The lemon, onion and fresh dill are perfect together. I followed one tip from another user and that was to not use the reserved cooking water. It turns out nice and creamy if you leave the water out. Fantastic recipe.

Excellent warm or cold. We used more dill and that made it taste "fresher." we also used light mayo and light sour cream couldn't taste the diference and it was way healthier.

Fantastic. We use red potatoes, Vidalia or Red onions (not soaked, full strength), and loads of lemon zest. Fresh dill is key. Sometimes add a clove of squished garlic. Have tried making it with light mayo, but I find it affects the flavor adversely. Using Light sour cream, however, does not. This is a dish in demand at summer picnics!

A solid side dish. I replaced red onion with a little shallot and tossed fingerling potatoes with lemon juice and lemon zest. Served at room temp with roasted salmon w/cranberry-mustard sauce and steamed asparagus. A fine meal.

Pretty good, I would make it again. Nice not to have to peel a bunch of eggs for a potato salad. Easy enough to do often. Had Vadalia onions, not red. Used fresh dill which had been frozen. Can't say I recommend that, fresh-fresh would be better, but this was fine. I used kosher salt which has best flavor. Star of the show was the fried chicken. This was a nice accompanying salad which was served cold. Don't you just LOVE Epicurious?! So nice to have "a magazine talk to you" !! I am a lifelong subscriber to Bon Appetit, but EppieCurious is nice because it is talking to friends who have BEEN there, I love the comments---thankyew !!

i didn't soak the onions either, i prefer the stronger onion flavor and it was good. if i made this again, i'd leave out the extra water, i thought it made the sauce way too thin. other than that, it was pretty good.

I made this twice, the first time soaking the onion in water and the second time not. I think I prefer the stronger onion flavor. I brought it to a work function and everyone loved it! Delicious!

I just made this recipe for a cookout and it was a huge success. The only slight changes I made were light sour cream and light mayo. With the dill flavor you couldn't even tell the difference!

This is an incredible recipe! It wasn't difficult and I had my father absolutely drooling and begging for more (I made it for an outdoor barbecue and birthday party). The fresh dill really makes it, though.

Quick, easy, and bursting with flavor. A new favorite in our house.

what did I do wrong? This was awful. I used red potatoes and green onion, as others suggested. just so horribly bland.

I, too, made this recipe with red potatoes and green onions. It was delicious! We ate it cold but I would try it warm also.

Used green onions instead of red and red potatoes instead of yellow. (please no comments about substitutions--these are fairly minor!) It was good warm with grilled salmon but I thought it was better cold the next day.

Easy and good summer side dish. Substituted Vidalia onion for the red onion, and skipped the soaking rec.

Excellent! I had to make a couple subsititutions though: shallots for the onion and dried dill, not fresh, and it was superb. I served it with grilled salmon. Definitely a keeper.
