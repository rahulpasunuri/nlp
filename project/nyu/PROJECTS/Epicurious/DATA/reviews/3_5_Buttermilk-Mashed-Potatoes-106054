These were really good mashed potatoes. I didn't peel them because I like my potatoes with the skin. I think they got better as leftovers.

I was never good at mashed potatoes...always trying to to cut the fat caused less than fabulous potatoes. These are great, with less fat than usual. I was 1/4 cup short on buttermilk so I made up the difference wth sour cream.. Still wonderful!!

Loved these potatoes. Followed the recipe as written and used Yukon Golds. I also used a potato ricer instead of mashing them, and they turned out so light yet creamy, with just a little tang from the buttermilk. No more gluey mashed potatoes for me! Definitely will make again.

Just wonderful. I used higher-fat buttermilk to avoid the tart flavor another cook mentioned and added enough buttermilk and butter to achieve the flavor I was looking for. I made these again a couple days after Thanksgiving, as well, to have with Julia Child's pot roast.

A little extra buttermilk gives them great tang. My favorite thing on the Thanksgiving table.

I used nonfat buttermilk and got too much tartness & too little richness. However, when accompanying meats or something (ours wasn't) the tartness might be nice...

Delicious. I used some herbed butter left over from steak. I nuked the buttermilk to save time and probably got it too hot because it separated the buttermilk. Luckily it didn't affect the taste. I'll be more careful next time

Don't know why such a simple recipe is so good. I have made buttermilk potatoes before and thought they had an odd taste (turning buttermilk or differrent potatoes?), but these were just as good as the cream version.

Nice flavor with the buttermilk. Make sure the buttermilk is warm otherwise the potatoes will get gluey.

Great recipe! Instead of using a wood spoon to stir in the buttermilk I continued using the mixer and I thought they came out better that way.

These mashed potatoes are very delicious, and are simple to make. I had a party with buffet-style service for about 18, so I made these potatoes several hours ahead of time, refrigerated them, and about 20 minutes before time to eat, I put them in a crock pot on a warm setting to warm them and keep them warm. I made a "mashed potato bar" by having condiment dishes & spoons with green onions, cheddar cheese, jalepenos, bacon bits, and sour cream to top the potatoes with. It went great with the London broil.

Pretty good - but I think it's really hard to mess up mash potatoes as they are one of my favorite comfort foods :) One needs to be in the mood for the buttermilk flavor, but the texture is great! I added a little more salt to my serving, but that's just my preference - my boyfriend added only pepper. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes are delicious also...

I have made this recipe many times and my husband and I love them. (He has no idea that they contain buttermilk. It's my little secret!!) These potatoes are tasty enough to serve for company.

Excellant way to enjoy mashed potatoes without the fat of all that butter that you would normally use.
