Best shortcake ever. I sliced the berries, added a couple of tablespoons of Cointreau (omitted the sugar) to the berries to let them macerate a little. Bakes the shortcakes a day ahead and then popped them in the microwave in paper towels for a few seconds to warm them. Sliced 'em, plopped the berries inside, put the top back on with cream and sat back to rave reviews. What a great recipe.

The Most Awesome Shortcake Ever! As previous reviewers suggested, I used raw egg yolks, substituted about 1/3 of the flour with cake flour, added about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla. What fragrance can possibly beat that of eggs, sugar, butter and vanilla in baked goods? Nothing! These delightful shortcakes seem to be the perfect blend between a cake and a shortbreak cookie. Smell delicious and taste even better!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and used a heart shaped cookie cutter. I also did not use the hard-cooked egg yolks; instead just raw and it came out perfectly. They came out beautifully!!

These shortcakes where heaven out of the oven! They also freeze well. I followed the advise of other reviewers and used raw egg yolks instead of hard-boiled. I would also recommend halfing the serving size since they are very rich.

This biscuit recipe is amazing!!! I did as suggested by other users and subbed 1/2 cup cake flour, used raw egg yolks, and added 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp vanilla in with the cream. I usually don't like strawberry short cake because of the cake element, however this is fantastic,and will be my go to recipe. Thanks Epi.

The biscuit recipe is amazing-they came out so light and buttery. I substituted half of the flour with non-raising cake flour. I really cannot express how wonderful the biscuits were!! I added some vanilla and sugar to the whipped cream. So good.

Exellent melt-in-your-mouth biscuits. As suggested, subbed 1/2 cup cake flour and added 1/2 tsp salt; used raw yolks and a splash of vanilla mixed in with cream . Creates a texture between cake and biscuit

This is a very nice shortcake. I substituted buttermilk for cream b/c it was what I had on hand and it worked fine. Next time I will work in the butter with a few pulses of the food processor.

Delicious! I used frozen strawberries, raspberries, and fresh blackberries. I also spread some marscapone on the biscuit before I topped it with filling, which I highly recommend.

Delicious. This was super quick and easy! I used 3/4 c. lowfat yogurt instead of the heavy cream. I'd probably go for full fat yogurt next time.

fabulous! we make this several times a week during the summer. best when the strawberries are local and/or organic. then they only need a dash of grand marnier and you are set! the only other alteration is we use the egg yolks raw, it still works perfectly. no matter how much we make our company always eats it all. it's a winner!

I tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out fantastic! I read the other reviews and opted to use the hard boiled egg yolk. I made sure that I mashed it really fine. I also added the 1/2 tsp of salt suggested by onther reviewer and then went one baby step further and added about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of vanilla to the mix. The shortcakes turned out light yellow on the inside with a sugar cookie like taste and an biscuit (very short and light) consistency. A real hit: will use this again.

This was the best Strawberry Shortcake recipe I have ever tasted and we have made quite a few different ones. My friends and family were WOWED! This is definitely a keeper!

i admit, the hard-boiled egg yolks sounded weird. in the end they made the shortcakes look as though they had corn meal in them- small yellow flecks. i made one batch too thin (3/4 inch thick) and they were a bit dry and not fabulous. the other batch i made thicker, more like and inch and a half and those were better. next time i would make these as drop shortcakes because i love the soft insides. i added some grated lemon rind which i recommend.

I also used to raw egg yolks and rolled the dough thicker to about 1". Sprinkle sugar on the biscuits before baking as they are a bit bland.

This recipe is fabulous-- the biscuit is just divine! I was very impressed with how the recipe turned out, and so were my guests! The biscuit was just so flaky and buttery and perfect. If I could give 5 forks, I would!

The egg yolk which is full of fat enriches and tenderizes the dough. These biscuits are heavenly and the only change I might try is to replace 1/2 cup of the flour with cake flour. Also I did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I had to bake them for about 18 minutes.

Very delicate and delicious. Try adding lemon zest to batter. Sprinkle top with cinnamon sugar.

Mmmm. Tender & delicious! I added raw egg yolk (rather than hard boiled). Perfect!

Great recipe and very easy! All of my guests loved it. The only thing that was a bit weird were the hard boiled eggs. I ended up with chunks of the egg yolks in the dough (even though I mashed them as called for in the recipe). Still a delicious recipe though and will definately make again.

So Delicious! You don't have to boil the eggs, just use yolks from the shells. I used to live in the South & without the sugar this is a fantastic biscuit recipe--light, fluffy, high...but you'll get rave reviews when you make it with the sugar for dessert!! I used strawberries & blueberries.

Very easy and very good. Don't be afraid to roll the dough thicker than 3/4 inch so that they come out thicker in the end. I did 1/2 inch or so and next time I'll do closer to an inch. I also pureed fresh strawberries with sugar so the whole dessert had more moistness to it.

These were delicious and v. impressive. To serve I seived icing sugar over them and the plate and added little drops of raspberry sauce on the plate and my guests were v. impressed! My dough didn't bind together at first so just added a little water and no problems. Definately recommend this and it is v. easy.

This was simple, not too sweet, and oh-so-melt-in-your-mouth tender pastry. Great for adults and kids, for casual dinners or when you want to go all out to impress the boss.
