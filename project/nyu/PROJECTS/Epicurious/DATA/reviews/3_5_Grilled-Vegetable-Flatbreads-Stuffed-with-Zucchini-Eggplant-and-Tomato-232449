The spread for this is really delicious. The key on the bread is to use either naan or greek pita, not the cardboard pita pockets (that will definitely not work). I usually grill chicken along with the veggies, which works well. Two eggplants really is too much, unless you REALLY love eggplant. I usually serve everything on a platter and each person can self-assemble.

Excellent; I toasted the flatbread before adding the eggplant mixture.

After the arduous preparation (an hour or so), the only remotely salvageable part of the meal was the bread. We had to cleanse the putrid taste off our palate with gingerbread cookies. i am actually so bitter and crestfallen from this meal that it will take some time before I can eat a vegetable again. And I am a vegetarian. As I chewed the bastardized concoction to a pulp and forced it past my gag reflex, I remembered this one time when I was a kid and ate a handful of sand. That tasted better. Then I cried a little as I recalled how happy I was as a child. And now this abysmal fart of a gut wrencher has made me even more lonely in this big city. If this meal was a movie, I would have walked out before the previews were over.

I was not very happy with how this recipe turned out. The spread for the pitas was absolutley delicious, although the meal as a whole was very bland, even with the additions of my own spices. I will make the spread again, but will not make the meal again.

Wonderful! A great dish for my first review on Epicurious - been using the site for 2 years and just decided to offer a review. Only changes I made were a substitution of lentil for lima beans and adding fresh mozzarella. Will definitely make again and again. The bean paste is a great spread and adds just the right flavor to the veggies.
