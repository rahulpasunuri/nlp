I agree with all reviewers. Steaming is the only way to cook a lobster. Sea water is preferred and if you can put seaweed on top even better. At least one lobster per person. To make it less messy, when lobsters can be handled, use kitchen shears to cut a divet into the tail, hold the lobsters up by the claws and drain all the water out into the sink. Otherwise your plate will soon be awash. I've seen lobstermen spear a steamed lobster and hold it over the fire (this was on the beach). Don't know if it improves what seems to be to be perfect. But haven't tried it. For a nice flavor, add some chopped fresh basil to the melted butter.

I honestly don't think I've seen a Sheila Lukins recipe on this site that has rated over 50%... Well at least now I know what to stay away from.

Steaming is the way to go. And colour is no indication of when a lobster is cooked. They often turn bright red within a few seconds after the heat hits them. Half a lobster per person? No decent maritimer would ever be that stingy.

In my experienc this standard recipe can be improved by steaming as Liz says. Add one inch of water and to this add one teaspoon of sugar. The time required to properly cook the lobster varies by its size. The goal is to thoroughly cook the lobster (they feed on carion)without overcooking, which causes the meat to stick to the inner surface of the shell. For 2 pounders I steam them for exactly 15 minutes after they turn bright orange. In this way the lobster cooks in its own juices and the fat is not diluted. I learned this from my neighbor in Shady Harbor, Rhode Island, an old "swamp Yankee" lobsterman.

OK I didn't make this recipe but I used to make lobster this way until I was set straight by a Maine lobsterman. Lobsters should be steamed not boiled and preferably in sea water. And half a lobster seems pretty stingy to me. I know 5 year olds who can eat a whole lobster!
