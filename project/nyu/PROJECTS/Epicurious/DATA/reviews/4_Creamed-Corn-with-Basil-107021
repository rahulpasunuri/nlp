Let me set the stage by saying that if I can make something from scratch, I always opt for the "all natural" non-processed choice. That said, I would open a can of creamed corn before I made this again. This dish was fine but a bit boring, and definitely not worth the effort. Trust me, there are better uses for fresh sweet corn on - or off - the cob.

Our got to off the cob corn recipe. Try browning the butter a little, it provides a nutty background. This even works with home frozen corn kernels; great in February with steak grilled in the snow.

YUMMY! I've never liked cream corn and I LOVED this recipe. It was a big hit with my dinner guests.

Fantastic! I modified it for the number of ears of corn I had, and it was excellent. Really liked the fresh tomatoes that was suggested.

yum... easy too. I didn't have enough shallots so I added white onion too and didn't have fresh basil so I used crushed frozen basil from Trader Joe's and it tasted great!

Excelent taste- alittle time consuming but worth it!

This dish is simple, good, and easy. Corn is in season and plentiful here in Georgia now, and I look for recipes that include lots of fresh ingredients. I blended a little fresh chopped and seeded tomato with the corn right before serving for color and taste - basil, corn, and tomato really go well together.
