These croutons are wonderful. I wouldn't make the salad dressing again, we found it very ordinary. But the croutons were terrific, not only in a salad but as an addition to appetizers and nibbles for TV watching, etc.

I thought this was pretty good, and my mother- in-law loved it. I think I might have to make extra pita croutons next time, since those were the most popular component.

Yum! Also good with pecans instead of walnuts.

The croutons are delicious! I also add a clove of garlic to the dressing.

This was excellent and easy to make. It gets my family eating spinach easily!

Great croutons...they made the salad! I added dried cranberries and extra goat cheese. However, we were disappointed in the dressing. Next time, I'll make a dressing from another salad recipe.

I make this salad every time I need something easy but impressive to bring to a dinner party. The flavors are subtle but distinctive. Just make sure to bake the croutons until they are very crispy or the walnuts will fall off the croutons

I have been making this salad over and over for four years. It is my favorite as far as salads. I always use baby spinach and red pear tomatoes split in half. It is incredible. The croutons though are definitely a treat. Sometimes I even make the croutons alone as a decandent little snack.

This salad was wonderful. I served it with grilled tuna. Before spreading the goat cheese on the pitas, I brushed on some garlic olive oil. I also added a clove of minced garlic to the dressing. Make sure to cut the croutons into a size small enough to fit into your mouth! Very yummy.

Great recipe. I added a minced shallot to the vinegarette and it enhanced the salad incredibly
