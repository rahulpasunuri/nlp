Pretty good and easier than expected. I put the cheese in the fridge for a bit after dipping. Served with some marinara and the prosciutto/arugula mixture.

Yummy! And quite satisfying. I deviated only for the rollups. As a arugula lover, I blanched the arugala for 20 seconds to concentrate that wonderful flavor. I heated the rollups a bit to get the prosciuto's juices flowing just before serving. Otherwise just as written. For those who found the dish too salty, try a small bite of the rollup combined with the same amount of fried mozzerella. Heaven!

I loved it although it was a little salty for my taste. My buffalo mozzerella was very soft so it was a little challenging to fry it. I don't think the coating and crumbs added too much to the flavor if you use buffalo so I will skip the frying next time.

this was fabulous! The cheese held together really well, It was a little bland with just the bell pepper so I served it with and eggplant ragu which brightened it up a little!

very good and easy to make. I was afraid of a melted mess when frying so I used cow's milk mozz. instead of buffalo mozz. Next time I will try with buffalo as the first ones turned out great with little effort. I just made a mixed salad using the principles of the salad in the recipe. will make again in the summer. winter appetizer with marinara sauce!

Outrageously delicious. I used pr-washed baby arugula to save time. Really easy. I will definitely make this again. My only criticism is that it is too salty and I love salt. I will reduce the salt in the dressing and in the egg white.

DH and I love this recipe and it is AWESOME with a good rose on a hot night. I use lots of arugula (you can never have too much!) and cover the bottom of the plate like a salad, arranging the other components over the top. I leave the peppers out since we don't like them but might try tomatoes as mentioned below.

Thsi is awesome and easy. Coated the cheese ahead of time and let chill in fridge for a couple hours. Next time I will use lemon juice instead of vinegar just because that's what my family prefers. Perfect guick Saturday supper and looked beautiful.

This dish was wonderful and pretty quick to prepare. I used panko bread crumbs, home grown tomatoes instead of roasted peppers and green leaf lettuce instead of arugula--because these were things I had on hand. The dressing really pulls it all together, so I would be sure to make it again with the anchovy vinaigrette. I went ahead and fried the pound of cheese, I used slices about 1 1/4 inch thick, or 8 equal slices. I had left overs and they were wonderful 2 days later heated in the oven and served with a fresh salad.

Great fried Mozzarella. I used bread crumbs I had left over from pasta with spicy anchovy sauce and dill (thyme in my case) Gormet April,08) So, my crumbs weren't dry as the recipe stated and the mozzarella fried up great anyway. The herbs were a great addition

Quite good. I used watercress instead of arugula, and it was very good. Mozz was easy to work with (I've had much more challenging experiences with goat cheese - oy). This is a great recipe for frying soft cheese. We ate it right up (dressing was very good), but I don't know if it will make the weekly or "company" recipe list.

I was a bit intimidated to fry mozz but this turned out much better than expected. I let the dipped cheese rest in the fridge for a bit which I think helped it keep its shape. I also used canola oil which worked well. I think this could work with most combinations of salads, I did have fresh arugula which was a nice contrast to the cheese. I would probably make again, this would also be good in the winter with some marianra and fresh bread.

Delicious recipe! The arugula and prosciutto complement the mozzarella nicely. However, my mozzarella frying did turn into a huge mess. I am not an experienced fryer, but don't think the oil was hot enough and the mozzarella was too warm when I started, so it quickly melted. The amount I salvaged was quite tasty though!
