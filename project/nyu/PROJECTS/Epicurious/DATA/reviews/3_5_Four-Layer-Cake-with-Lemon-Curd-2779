I have made this cake several times. Although I did some tweeking I always got rave reviews. Recently I made this cake for a special birthday. Only 1/2 of the cake was eaten. Knowing I had to entertain the following evening I decided to uses theleftover cake to concoct a new dessert. I cut the cake into cubes and placed in a trifle bowl. I had made extra curd and mixed with an additional 8 ounces of whipped cream . This I spread between layers of the cubed cake. With fresh (and so tasty) berries in season I placed cut up berries (which I had mixed with sugar) and the juices on to of each layer of the curd/whipped cream layer. After completing all layers I placed an additional layer of whipped cream on top and then decorated with additional berries and sliced almonds WOW! The reviews were over the top and every last bite was eaten! This will definitely be repeated especially during fresh berry season

I made this curd to go with a different cake recipe. I had to throw it out is was so gag-me sweet. Curd should be nice and tart and this one is not!

A delicious cake. This is a very basic and southern style white dessert cake. It's simple, but precise. It is not a "dump" cake, i.e. dump ingredients together, etc. Follow exactly the process described for adding the egg whites, and for adding the flour and milk, and it should not result in a too-dense cake. Note that the layers are thin. As for using an additional icing, I prefer the simple elegance of pouring the lemon curd over the top.

Like some other reviewers I found the cake a little dry and dense. I think a plain butter/madeira cake would be better. The lemon curd was absolutely fantastic...definately a keeper.

This cake is a show stopper! I've made it at least a dozen times, and it gets rave reviews. A must for lemon-lovers.

made this on holiday for a birthday cake--it was spectacular looking. being in new england in august i added 1/2 pint of fresh blueberries for a minute when warming the glaze layer for the top and they turned it an amazing purple color--with berries intact.

I made this cake, however the layers were rather dense, not what I had expected. Perhaps a better leavening agent or combination of them. I would try "Rumfords" baking powder next time. The lemon curd recipe was excellent and flavorful. I frosted with a cream cheese buttercream.

I was in a hurry- I halved the recipe and accidentally used the full 1 cup of milk and forgot to beat the egg whites beforehand. The cake turned out strange, but it was still good! I'm making it again tomorrow- I know it'll turn out great once I actually follow the instructions! To decorate, I added sliced kiwi to top off the cake.

This cake was well received by all. I personally was a little disappointed in the texture of the cake (too dense) I used two 9" pans and don't know if that made a difference. The curd was yummy!

This was very well-received at Thanksgiving dinner. I baked two 9" layers and then split them to make the four layers. The lemon curd was delicious. I frosted the cake with whipped cream into which I folded instant lemon-flavored pudding (made with only half the milk) and decorated the cake with thin slices of lemon and candied orange peel. Perfect! The only problem is that the lemon curd slips a little when the cake has sat out for a while (made a mess when the leftovers toppled over in my car on the way home). Also, if stored in the refrigerator, the leftovers harden up and become inedible. Next time I'll just keep it in the cake dome and enjoy it longer!

Since I made this for my son's birthday, I decided to frost it with a cream cheese / buttercream frosting, which worked very well with the intense lemon flavor, and looked great, too.

I was short on time - so I used a good white cake mix - it came out wonderful! Everyone loved it, the lemon flavor is outstanding, I had not a piece left.

We have made this cake several times already and love it! It tastes best served at room temperature and is better on the second day. Although difficult to assemble and frost, it is worth the effort!
