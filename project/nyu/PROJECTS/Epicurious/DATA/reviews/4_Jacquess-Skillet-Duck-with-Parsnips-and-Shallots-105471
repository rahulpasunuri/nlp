This was incredible. Served with the bacon date puree and lentils from a different duck recipe on this website. Jacque and Julia Rock!!

This recipe was fabulous. I had the butcher cut the duck for me, and from there everything was a piece o' cake. I might put everything under the broiler briefly at the end next time for some additional crisp, but it was fabulous as-is.

Loved this recipe. The first time we have tried cooking duck and it was surprisingly easy and well worth the effort. Our parsnips were like candy and the perfect texture. Potatoes and carrots would be nice to add for a one pot meal.

My family really enjoyed this dish as a very cohesive array of flavor.It really was quite delicious. The only issue was that I ended up having to cook the duck a little longer than specified, and the vegetable came out overcooked.

We have made this recipe several times, so the cutting gets easier each time. Loved the recipe from the beginning and it can be served as "elegantly" as you wish. But for four with an appetite, I recommend 2 ducks.

I made this with breasts only and it worked quite well. The shallots and garlic cooked perfectly, the parsnips were a bit undercooked but didn't want to overcook the duck. Next time I may add carrots or celery root instead of the parsnips as they weren't the family fave. But the duck was delicious. I actually didn't bother deglazing the pan (but I did save all that glorious duck fat!), still delicious.

I can really only rate the preparation method, as I left out the garlic and vegetables. When the duck was done I strained the fat into a jar (and labeled it "liquid gold"), then deglazed the pan with duck broth from the carcase and some red wine. Delicious!

Very nice duck recipe. I liked how the duck is separated into pieces -- makes all of the meat on the duck much more likely to be enjoyed, rather than having to cut some of the hard-to-get-at meat from the carcass when it's roasted whole. This duck recipe is a nice "country style" recipe -- it's not a particularly fancy presentation. For that reason, I personally would choose other recipes on epicurious for serving to guests, but would happily make this duck recipe again for family or a casual party.

Epicurious, why is the rating so low on this recipe? All of the reviewers (so far) have given this recipe four fork ratings?

We loved this dish! Pan-fried the duck on both sides for a crispier and more attractive dish. Added potatoes (french cut). Splashed a bit of lemon juice on the veggies after cooking to add different dimension. Will make again!!

Great recipe; I suggest adding carrots and potatoes; If you don't love garlic, you might want to remove it part way through or add less.

This is an easy dish to prepare. It's real comfort food. I would serve a half duck per person, however. Everybody was looking for more. Add potatoes and I guarantee they'll be gobbled up, too.
