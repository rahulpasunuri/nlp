This has become on of our very favorite summertime meals. We actually make it every time we camp as well. I use the Girard's Champagne dressing & basil as the marinade. Even my little brother, a known vegetable hater, gobbled them up. Make sure you grill the veggies until their tender! Try them, you won't be sorry!

microwave veggies untle semi-tender before grilling

Not bad. Very much like a sandwich I've been making for years. I roast peppers, onions, zucchini, summer squash, eggplant & portobellos then hollow out a baguette drizzle with homemade balsamic dressing, layer in fresh basil, grilled veggies and gorgonzola. I make a huge one and we eat it for days. Delicious!

Loved this, but I love vegetarian sandwiches anyway.

Seemed like a lot of trouble for what it turned out to be - good, but not fantastic.

Simple, healthy, delicious! Perfect for an evening when you're short on time. It's on our regular summer time rotation.

Superb! Made this for a gathering, so I used a baguette of bread. I broiled eggplant, zuchinni, and red pepper instead of grilling. Also substituted blue cheese for provolone since the store was out. This sandwhich was a hit - even the meat eaters ignored the cold cut sandwhiches to eat this!

This recipe looked bland, but was not. I added some jarred pesto & red pepper to the dressing. I like this recipe b/c you can add any vegetables you'd like. I added cremini mushrooms & advocado. Was very good!

Love this recipe on a warm summer day! Had this sandwich a least twice a week last summer.
