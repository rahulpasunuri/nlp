I thought these were good, not superb. However, there couldn't be a simpler recipe - mixing everything in the processor was so easy!

Very easy, delicious, sophisticated taste. Be careful not to use more than the 2 tsp size of batter called for when making each cookie. Those of mine that were a bit bigger did not come out as beautifully as the smaller ones. Still taste great, though.

These were great--quick and tasty. A great not-so-sweet alternative on a cookie tray.

This is a great and quick batch of cookies to whip up. A few additional comments -- the second time I made these I made them into small round cookies rather than bothering with the crescents. This was easier, and allowed me to get the cookie dough in the oven while it was still chilled. Second -- do NOT omit the powdered sugar. It makes all the difference in the cookie!

Easy to prepare. Very tender and buttery. On the sweet side. Delicious.
