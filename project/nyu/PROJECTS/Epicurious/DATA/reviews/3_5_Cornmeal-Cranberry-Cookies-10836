Addendum to my last review. I took them to my trivia group (I bring a different cookie every week) and they LOVED these. Said they were better than my award winning (literally) chocolate oatmeal cookies. I think next time I'm going to cut down on the sugar. I still think they're way too sweet.

I'll continue to make these even though they're not my favorite. I used dried cherries. I'm sure any small, dried fruit would be good. My little 13 year old friend said "They practically melt in your mouth". But he also said "The cherries taste weird." They're a nice 'alternative' cookie.

I baked these cookies the other night and I really like elements of them, the cornmeal is delightful and the overall cookie flavor is REALLY good. My complaint is that the cookie is considerably too sweet. When I make them again, I will cut the sugar to 1 cup max. I prefer that the cranberries give the punches of flavor and sweetness and that the rest of the cookie be a buttery background.

Someone that I care for baked them for me and I fell in love all over again.

Excellent cookies! I bake mine for only 12-13 minutes and give them a little dusting of 10x once they've cooled, and that seems to make them just about perfect... not overly sweet, but a good happy medium. Yum!

Another hint/suggestion: roll into relatively thin logs (quarter-sized diameter) and slice and bake. They make very cute (and delicious!) mini-cookies! I really, really love this recipe! Everyone who tastes this asks for the recipe.

This is one of my most favorite holiday cookies. Really is a shame to make this for the holidays only! I've been baking this cookie since it came out in the November 1994 edition - simply the best. My secret success - don't overbake. I personally like a more tender cookie, so bake for only 11-12 minutes. They'll come out beautifully done, but nice and soft.

I just made these. They are SO good! No modifications to the recipe except that I rolled them into a log and sliced them with a serrated knife, like other reviewers suggested. I recommend slicing them relatively thinly--maybe 1/4 inch slices. That way, they'll be more crisp as they cool from the oven. I cooked them about 11-12 minutes.

I like this one the best - for a change try dried currants & pine nuts - & Definitely form into a log & slice...

These turned out great. I took other's advice and soaked the cranberries in orange juice. I also added some orange zest, rolled it into a log (some canola oil on your hands makes it less sticky)and put it in the fridge for a few hours, then sliced it with a bread knife. I would add that its best to use 'fine' ground cornmeal - less gritty but still plenty of flavor. Great holiday cookie.

These are great cookies - all I did differently was to soak the cranberries in orange juice before mixing them in. This made the cookies a little moister and a touch more flavorful. So, so good!

I took the suggestion to roll the dough into logs and refrigerate, and this worked out very well. This recipe produced a dense shortbread cookie, and is easy to "slice and bake" from the log configuration. Also, I do steep the dried cranberries in hot water and then add them, which I think helps to produce a cookie that is not too dry.

dry and tasteless.

Those who wrote that they didn't like them but others did, neither my husband or I liked them. Too much corn meal perhaps? Won't do again.

The suggestion of rolling the dough into logs and freezing them was wonderful; I wouldn't do it any other way. Use a serrated knife when slicing the frozen log - this cuts the cranberries as well and gives the cookie surface pretty flecks of red. Tastewise, they're really good, and the cornmeal adds an interesting crunch the the finished product.

I didn't really like these cookies, but everyone who tried them said they were some of the best cookies they had ever had. The texture is pretty neat--I liked the idea of cornmeal. My cookies didn't get all that hard as some reviewers complained about. Great holiday colors!

I love this recipe! I made this last christmas, and am doing it again. I don't mind the drop cookie look, although I sometimes roll them into balls. Sprinkle a little sugar on top for browning and flavor. I also used apricots in place of the cranberries - excellent!

I thought they were ok but I prefer soft cookies and these are crunchy. Everyone else loved them so three forks it is.

Love these cookies! Yummy, not too sweet, pretty, perky - cranberries are a special touch.

These were heavenly! I doubled the vanilla (this offsets the bitterness of the cornmeal) but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I rolled the cookies into balls rather than dropping them to give them a nicer shape. Everyone loved them, including the picky kids!

delicious! i made them a bit smaller than suggested and baked them for a little less time. i recommend rolling the dough into balls to give the cookies a smoother, more regular shape. great with tea.

I thought these were a solid alternative to choclate chip-especially being a native of Massachusetts who grew up with cranberry and cornmeal based Autumn dishes. I FULLY AGREE with the person who said to roll them and slice them. The dropped cookies were ugly!! I added a little crystalized sanding sugar to the tops before I baked the slices and their appearance was much improved. I only baked them for 11 minutes. Less dry that way.

thought these were great - very easy to make - will use them during the holidays.

I have made these many times and think they're fabulous! They're especially pretty around the holidays.

This is hands-down my favorite cookie recipe. My Gourmet magazine is covered in its batter from so many bakings. The sugar amount is necessary to offset the bitterness of the cornmeal, as is the butter. To be goofy, one July the 4th I put blue food coloring in the cookie dough, which looked cute with the red cranberry.

The dough was was difficult to work with, and the baked cookies were hard and un-tasty, I would definitly not do this again

I take cookies to work each week and this one went over GREAT with the crowd. I took previous comments' advice after the 1st batch and sliced them rather than dropping them on cookie sheet.

My husband loved this recipe. Only thing I would change is to cut the sugar down a bit.

Awesome cookies - everyone loved them. I received requests at the party for the recipe so I printed it and handed it out. VERY IMPORTANT - the cookie dough should be formed into a log,chilled, and sliced NOT dropped onto the cookie sheet. This prevents the cookies from becoming too dry and makes them taste like shortbread. They also look very appealing this way. The second time that I made them I added orange zest. This is a very nice addition and the orange flavor goes well with the dried cranberries. They are delicious!

Dry and not the best cookie ever. I intended it for a Christmas cookie, fooled by the cranberries, but it doesn't look festive at all--lumpy and colorless. I substituted dried mixed berries & cherries for the cranberries and added some finely chopped pecans. My husband's friends all ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

These cookies are a nice change from more traditional recipes. They have become quite a favorite. I often add additional cranberries and have, occasionally, added chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts). They taste best the next day.
