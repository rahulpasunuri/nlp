Cheese layer in the middle was odd - it might have been better scattered throughout batter. I added about 1 TBL of grated onion to the recipe. Overall, it was tasty, but nothing special.

The dough was extremely easy to work with and the taste was great. I cut the amount of dill in half though since the called amount seemed to be a little too much.

Very good, rich tasting bread. My only change is to substiute plain flour for at least 1/2-3/4 cup of the total amount of wheat flour. This will lighten the bread a bit, mine came out rather heavy. With all that said, it still is a very good bread, I just prefer a less dense bread. This is very easy, just takes time since you have to wait for the bread to rise. If you aren't a fan of dill, don't worry - the cheddar taste is much stronger. I couldn't really even taste the dill (might add more next time!)

My friend has a lakehouse where she grows a ton of fresh herbs in her garden. On a recent visit she gave me dill. I made dinner for her and used the fresh dill from her garden to make this wonderful bread. Has a dark rye flavor and the dill really shines through. Very easy and delicious.

This bread was very tasty and easy to prepare. I substituted 2 tablespoons of dried oregano in place of the dill. I will definitely make this again!!
