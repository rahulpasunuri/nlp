Not much flavor. I added 1 tsp dried fennel seeds (crushed), 1.5 tsp dried thyme, and 1.5 tsp salt, which helped, but still didn't make this worth doing again as written. I agree with others who say it needs cream. I'd also caramelize the onions and leeks before adding the potatoes next time - the potatoes don't need to get super-soft as they'll be pureed anyway.

My family loves this soup! It is thick and delicious with no milk products which we need being lactose intolerant. We make it all the time in my house.

This was a very basic potato soup. I much prefer other Potato Leek soups that include celery, carrots and milk. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor in this one.

We have made this soup over and over again. Potatoes and leeks are in season together in the gardens in ME, so a perfect soup to make in the fall. My 2 boys absolutely love it and say it is their favorite soup! Simple to make, & a healthy meal along with a salad and some bread. We usually serve it with a little aged gouda shredded on top. YUM!

Delicious, wholesome tasting soup - I add an estra potato or two for thicker soup.

I make this soup all the time, but I substitute chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and add a little bit of cream after processing. It makes a big difference! Absolutely delicious!

As lovers of potato/leek soup, this recipe left much to be desired and will not be repeated in our kitchen. We attributed our dislike to the vegetable broth. The garlic cheese toasts were wonderful and will definitely make them again.

I liked the soup enough to try it again. I believe the following changes worthy of another fork. Reduce oil to 2 tbsp, season as you go with s&p, add 2-4 Tbsp cream immediately before serving

What a great potato soup! Delicate yet flavorful, I used a bit of milk in the soup and added schallots to the cheese toast to give "more bang for the buck". This is one of my new favorites! Yum, yum.

Not much flavor, even a day later. Would add fresh herbs and a little bit of cream. The garlic cheese toasts, however, were tasty -- something to make with other soups as "croutons."

It was a hit with the adults, not so much with the kids. Instead of the garlic cheese toasts I served foie gras on toasted baguette slices, and that worked very well.

Easy to prepare, great flavor, texture and color. I chose to puree more of the soup for a more hearty texture. It was great.

This was a very good and very filling recipe. I used yukon gold instead of russet potatoes. It was delicious!

Easy to prepare. Quite delicious and very creamy. Try mozzarella on the toasts.

This is a nice soup, filling and tasty on a cold night. The toasts are worth the effort, try them at least once.
