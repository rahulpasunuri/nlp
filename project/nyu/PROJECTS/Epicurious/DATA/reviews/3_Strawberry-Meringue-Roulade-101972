very nice easy to make dessert. I only used 1/4 cup of strawberry preserves and soaked them in Cognac for about 30 minutes and it turned out very well. the meringue looked very "cracked" but rolled well so I topped it with sliced strawberries and sued the juice and cognac as a sauce to top each slice as it was served

I've been making this dessert since 1999 and I think it's delicious. It always gets rave reviews from guests. I agree about the wax paper - it does make it tricky to get it off the meringue, but if you take your time it comes off without too much damage. Parchment paper would be a better bet.

Lovely taste but I wish I had read the reviews suggesting parchment paper instead of waxed taste. I will definitely try that next time because there was nothing easy about getting that waxed paper off and I had buttered it quite well. Otherwise the recipe was straight forward. I used raspberry preserves and that worked well. I will definitely make it at least one more time because I think my mother (a meringue lover) will really like it.

As one of my guests said, this tastes out of this world. It didn't, however, look like a roulade to me and it was somewhat difficult to assemble. The bottom of the meringue broke into pieces when I rolled it up, the middle split and the whipped cream and strawberries came oozing out. Frankly, it didn't look nice. (I left the meringue in the oven for a few minutes longer by accident, and wonder if this was the cause of the bottom breaking into pieces). When you make it, make sure the middle has more meringue than the sides so that it won't tear when you roll it up. Note: this "grows" in the oven! I used parchment paper and it came off with no effort. I think i'll make it as a pavlova next time, and reduce the sugar by a little bit in the meringue as this was quite sweet. All in all, this is a keeper and I can't wait to eat it again!

Delicious. First roulade I've ever made and it turned out perfectly. Added a few teaspoons of cocoa powder and icing sugar to the cream mixture.

I should have followed my experienced intuition rather than this recipe from hell! Definitely do use parchment paper and not waxed paper...and I'm not sure that one needs to bake the merigngue starting at 400F. I added the vanilla with the cream before whipping and never could get it to form stiff peaks. As for the cooled meringue, it tore and the end result looked like vomit! I agree with others that a trifle or pavlova would have done this dessert better justice.

DO NOT USE WAX PAPER!! After reading this recipe I can't believe that its creator used WAX PAPER. Please use PARCHMENT PAPER. If you are an avid cook you will find that parchment paper is indispensable. King Arthur Flour carries it on-line.

I tried this recipe several times now, and it always came out delicious! It also worked well with raspberries, white fleshed peaches or a mixture of strawberries and raspberries. I also tried to substitute orange curd for the preserves - also worked well. If you have to prepare it more than 3-4 hours in advance, I would recommend adding just a pinch of modified starch to cream and to fruit mixture to prevent it from becoming soggy. I will prepare this recipe again and again for sure, as it is amazingly simple and yummy.

This dish can be absolutely delicious if you make it in a trifle bowl as layers of meringue, strawberries, and whipped cream instead of as a roulade. The roulade is messy and not particularily pretty. In a trifle bowl it is an elegant and easy desert! It was a hit!

The paper was difficult to remove but buttering it more helped the second time. It was delicious and got rave reviews. I also tried it with raspberries and actually prefer that.

After reading an earlier review that stated wax paper was "a misery" to remove, I used well-buttered parchament paper instead. Worked like a dream! I also coated the roulade with a dark-chocolate ganache. It was hit at Sunday dinner.

I found this messy and time consuming. The wax paper was a misery to peel off. You can cover up the messy bits when it has been rolled and filled but a straightforward pavlova is simpler and looks and tastes just as good.
