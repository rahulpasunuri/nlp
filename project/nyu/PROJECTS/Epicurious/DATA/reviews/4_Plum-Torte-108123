Correction to recipe below: Use a BLENDER, not a food processor!

SUGAR-FREE, FLOUR-FREE VERSION. I'm on a no sugar, no-flour medical diet, but was determined to try this recipe. It's like one my Mom used to make - she made hers with flour, with sugar. This version works for me! (Note: no butter either. Fats are in the almonds.) 1 cp blanched almonds. 1/3 cp agave nectar. 2 eggs. pinch salt. 1 tsp ground cinnamon, or more. 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg. 1 tsp vanilla. 24 halves pitted prune plums..... Grind almonds fine (flour substitute) in a food processor. Add remaining ingredients except the plums to the processor. Blend mixture til smooth. Pour into the bottom of an ungreased 10" pyrex pie tin (I didn't have the springform pan). Place plum halves face down in the 'custard'. Bake 40-50 minutes in a preheated 350 oven. (Test doneness at centre with toothpick.)

WOW! I'm glad I bought so many Italian prune plums at my warehouse-type store, because I will be making another one of these cakes tomorrow!!!! Very simple, and very, very good.

We are lucky enough to have Italian prune plum trees in our Massachusetts orchard. The one modification I make to this recipe is setting the plum halves on their sides instead of flat on the dough. This allows for MORE plums in the torte than the recipe calls for -- and lovely crescent shaped designs that the dough forms around each plum half. Easy; classic and delicious.

We have a very large cherry plum tree that has a bumper crop every 2 or 3 years. I just tried this recipe for the first time a few days ago using cherry plums and it was scrumptious!! Cherry plums are tarter than other plums and the tartness lent itself well to this recipe. My husband said it reminded him of strawberry-rhubarb flavor. This is now our favorite dessert recipe!

Simple and delicious. It wouldn't be early fall without this recipe. Substitute pear slices for the plum halves and add almond extract to the batter for a wonderful variation.

I really do not like plums very much but as I had some left lonely in the fruit bowl I decided to give this a go. Well  what a surprise, fantastic. My husband and children all devoured it that day. My seven year old said it was fantastic. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and half a teaspoon of allspice to the batter. I baked it in an 8-inch porcelain quiche dish lined with buttered parchment and it came out with ease. It did take 65 minutes to cook through. Another reviewer said hers came out like angel cake? Mine was more like a scone. I ending up using 6 large plums, cut into ½ inch wedges. Will definitely make again and the tip to serve with vanilla ice-cream was spot on!

I had a huge Italian plum crop this year and this recipe has been great to use up my plums. Very easy, very yummy.

I have made this recipe countless times and been asked for the recipe nearly every time. Everyone loves this cake and it is SO easy to prepare. I use a removable bottom 9" pan but no paper, just plenty of butter and a dusting of flour. I have used berries instead, as well, about one cup fresh or even frozen will do in a pinch. Then sub vanilla for the cinnamon.

this was sooo good. i used peaches and pears and sprinkled them with vanilla sugar. my friends were doubtful of this recipe as they watched me make it. it looked too much like cake batter and not the dough we thought it would be. but it was awesome. i used a square glass baking pan, lightly buttered. highly recommended.

This recipe is excellent when prepared with plums, apricots, peaches...I have made this torte at least 100 times. I have prepared it in a regular round springform pan, as well as, a square non-stick springform pan. In all of these times I have never had the need to grease a pan, line one with paper or anything else that people have claimed to have had to do here. What have you folks been doing differently to require such changes? Oops, I have to go. I have to check on an apricot version in the oven - in an ungreased, unlined...

Definitely a keeper. It reminds me of a plum cake my Mom used to make. The dough is thick, but I spread it out in a parchment lined tart pan with removable bottom. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.

A great, simple recipe. I, too, used an ungreased pan the first time -- with disastrous results. Next time, I think I'll put a circle of parchment in the bottom of the pan.

I made it with Splenda instead of the sugar, and gluten free flour instead of regular flour, and even with these modifications it was delicious! (Not every recipe can stand up to such major substitutions!) It got raves. When the plums are out of season I'll try it with other fruit.

i make this dessert weekly all summer with apricots or peaches as well as prunes. everyone loves it. i also put a half dozen into the freezer: line a 9" cake pan with foil and prepare as directed. When cool, lift out the finished dessert and wrap over the top with more foil. freeze in a sealed bag. Reheat as directed and serve in the dead of winter. Your guests will love you forever!

We are inundated with plums in the fall in my area, and this is a wonderful recipe to use them up. It's fast to make, elegant-looking, and delicious. I've made about five of them since the plums ripened this year! (Two are in the freezer.)

I have been making this recipe since it was first in the NYTs. It is so easy and so delicious. In the fall, I usually make several and freeze them. I just picked up a quart of plums at the farmers' market -- can't wait to do these again.

I give this recipe 4 forks because it was simple to make and very delicious. I used a black iron skillet and pushed the plums down into the batter a bit. We didn't have any ice cream or whipped cream in the house so we used a dollop of vanilla yogurt (not frozen). My kids went crazy for this dessert - especially because I made it on a weeknight.

I've made this a dozen times with different kinds of fruit. Everyone loves it, takes seconds and wants the recipe. Some of my friends prefer this to all other desserts. Make extra when plums, apricots and peaches are in season and keep them in the freezer

Wonderful and so easy to make. If using a 10" sprngform pan, double the recipe. Grease the pan too. The dough is very thick and doesn't spread easily, but that's OK. Lay the fruit on top (I think any fruit would work). The dough will puff up around it and the fruit will end up in the middle. Yummy!

Pretty good, and an easy weeknight dessert. I made this with a few adjustments: I added about 1/4 tsp ground ginger powder to the batter while mixing; poured in one tsp vanilla extract; and used 3 small eggs rather than the 2 large called for (my farmers' market was out of the large ones this weekend, so I bought the smaller ones). I greased and floured the springform, and at 42 minutes in the oven it was perfect. It's a light, springy and moist cake -- mine has an almost angel cake-like consistency. Perhaps it's the morning coffee-friendly combination of fruit and cinnamon, but I have to admit that it strikes me more as breakfast food than dessert. Great use for plums, and worth making again, either as a weekend breakfast treat or an afternoon teatime accompaniment.

I used purple pluots and red plums, and sprinkled some mace into the flour mixture. I also added vanilla like a previous reviewer noted. Everyone went for seconds. You could easily double the batter for a 10 inch spring form pan. It is very close to being a cobbler, and so extemely simple and quick to make. Putting it into a spring form pan makes it look very nice. Next time I will slice thickly two cups of fruit, and double the batter.

I tried this recipe after reading all the comments, and I agree that it's simple and tasty. But am I the only one who fell for the bit about using an ungreased pan? Nobody warned me about having to chip out the torte in a thousand pieces. Next time I'll grease the pan!

This is a great recipe. It is a perfect recipe. Each time I bake this torte, I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I do not use 12 small prune plums, but rather 6 full size plums. This weekend I used red plums. It is a very excellent recipe for when you don't have a lot of time to cook.

Pretty ordinary -I'm a little surprised by the raves. It is okay, nothing special. A simple cake topped with sweetened fruit. Good for breakfast, not much of a dessert.

Tried recipe to use up prune plums we had,delicious. Kids thought it looked a little strange before baking,but it bakes beautifully. They want it again. Will also try with other fruits.

Love this recipe! So easy, few ingredients and great! I have made it 3 times in the last 3 days so far. . .the plums have just all ripened and this is a wonderful way to use them. I thought about saying it was terrible and then try to pass it off as my own at a state fair! In one variation that I made I added some cinnamon and some raisins to the batter. Still great - and made the it a little bigger.

I had nectarines, blueberries, and black plums and used them. Can't wait until later in the summer to try the prune plums. I made nectarine ice cream to accompany this torte.

delicous- have made with many fruits and have substituted light olive oil (mix for three minutes) for the butter - definite keeper

I love this recipe! I have made it many many times and it's always a hit. I like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. It's great for breakfast the next day too if there's any left, but it's rare to have leftovers because everyone has seconds!

I have made this probably ten times since plum season began in late August, with both fresh and defrosted plums. I've also made it with apples, with similar success. It's unbelievably quick and easy. I bake mine for only 25-27 minutes at 340 degrees in a convection oven. It freezes well, travels well, keeps well.

This is too simple and delicious to be true. Because of my surplus of plums, I served it with a warm brandy-plum sauce and a little vanilla ice cream.

Everyone that tasted this dessert wanted the recipe. I added 2 tsps. of vanilla and reduced the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp.(I was using a strong cinnamon) It looked as good as it tasted. A yummy dessert!

This is a super late-summer dessert to transition into the warm flavors of fall. I followed recipe exactly. The cinnamon is delightful and the plum is fruity but homey and comforting. Note the test kitchen's remarks about the batter - it is more of a dough and needs to be spread, but don't worry - it still emerges like cake. I'm glad to hear this freezes well, because I do get one big dump of plums but want to spread their bounty to later in the year. This is a great recipe to do that!

This torte is delicious. The first time I made it, I used yellow plums. They were a little too tart. The next time I made it, I used fresh Ontario peaches and wild blueberries. I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Took it to a cottage pot luck last week and everyone loved it. I just made another one for a dinner party tomorrow. It's a winner, and so easy!

My guests seemed to really like it, but I thought it was a bit tart, and it was a little too "cake-y." Next time I might take the skins off the plums.

Like the test kitchen, I used a jar of drained sour cherries, and the result was delicious. I served it with vanilla-cherry ice cream. This is a moist, old-fashioned cake that can be dressed up or down, and that is surprising easy to prepare.

Just finished making three for the freezer. Brought home a ton of plums form the trip to the country and wanted something to do with them. This is delicious and very easy. Anyone can do it well. Do try this one. It is especially good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum.

What a simple and excellent desert! We didn't have plums, so instead sliced 2 peaches and a mango. I also added a little nutmeg to the sugar/cin. topping - just because I like nutmeg. So delicious my husband and I had to toss out the extra for fear of eating it all in the night!

I have made this recipe for years and didn't laminate the final clipping because I've memorized it from making it so often. It is always wonderful. It freezes well, it's great for dessert or breakfast -- well, you just can't have too many of them on hand.

I've made this cake every time the recipe appeared in the NY Times and even in between printings. It's so good that everyone always asks me for the recipe. Even those who do not consider themselves bakers will find success with this recipe. It's foolproof.
