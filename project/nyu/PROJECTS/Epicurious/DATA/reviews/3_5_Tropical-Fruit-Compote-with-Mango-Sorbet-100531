I'm in full agreement with Hudson_Ferris on 04/07/09. Mix some fruit and go buy a pint of sorbet has no place here. That belongs on Martha Stewart, or Sandra Lee's Semi-HomeMade show.

Wonderful recipe by itself. I've made a couple of times now but with REAL mango sorbet. (I'm blessed with a commercial kitchen at my disposal at work) This is going to sound odd to most, but I added seeded minced jalapeno to the sorbet and it turned out to be out of this world. I use it on my seasonal menu in the a la carte kitchen often as a special! If you're brave, give it a try!

I hate to be picky but when I see a recipe title that says mango sorbet, I expect to find a recipe for mango sorbet ... which is what I was looking for. Not to be told to go buy some mango sorbet.

Outstanding! Beautiful! Refreshing! Sophisticated for a Party! A "winner" of a recipe!

I've made this 2 times for dinner parties and each time there aren't any leftovers. I only do the compote part as a fruit salad, no sorbet. The wine really makes it stand out.

Light, very flavourful. Recommended

This is an excellent recipe for either dessert, or breakfast (without the sorbet). I made it for a brunch and it sure was a hit -- it's light, colorful and flavorful.

A very nice desert. It definitely benefits from marinating overnight. I used Sutter Home Chardonnay for the white wine. Light and delicious, but still decadent!
