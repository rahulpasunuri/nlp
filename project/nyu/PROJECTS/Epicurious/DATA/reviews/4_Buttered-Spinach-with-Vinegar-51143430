This is incredibly simple and delicious. I used two bags of Trader Joe's pre-washed baby spinach. I cut the butter in half and thought it was plenty. My oldest son isn't crazy about greens and he had multiple servings saying "it was strangely addictive." I'd be interested in trying it with EVO instead of butter but if cut in half it's not that much butter.
