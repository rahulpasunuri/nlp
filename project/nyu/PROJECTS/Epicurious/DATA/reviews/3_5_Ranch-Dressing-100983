Yummy! I omitted the powdered buttermilk because I didn't have any. Also, it was a little thin so I added some plain nonfat yogurt. The sauce was great with chicken wings and vegetable sticks.

Simple and delicious. I often serve this along side a wedge salad in liu of blue cheese dressing.

I thought this was pretty d*** good the first time I made it, and gobbled up all the salad I'd previously been avoiding. Garlic powder can work for those who don't have onion powder on hand. However: if you're trying to save the last 3/4 cup of mayo in your fridge for your significant other's sandwiches, DON'T think that you can get by using sour cream and a bit of vinegar in this recipe = F-L-A-T...

This is a delicious dressing. The chopped celery leaves are a wonderful addition. I made this with homemade mayo and it was super tasty. I still prefer the ranch dressing recipe found on the food networks website. I am going to try adding chives, garlic and a splash of white wine vinegar to this recipe the next time I make it. This recipe has excellent potential, it is just a tad bit flat, as is.

Yummy. Didn't have onion powder so used garlic powder. Next time will cut back on mustard for more traditional taste and will try with fresh dill.

WAY WAY too much mayo.

MAN is this good! I used fresh dill (about 3 T -- I like dill) and added about half a clove of garlic. And left out the celery, since I think celery is the Devil's work. It's chilling as we speak, and it took a great deal of willpower not to start slathering it immediately on everything in sight.

Very good- this recipe has lived up to all 28 great reviews. Fresh herbs taste great but it's hard for us to always to always have these on hand at the house. Defintely a keeper however...

This is by far the best buttermilk dressing recipe on this site -- I think I've tried them all. Try it with fresh dill in the summer. The powdered buttermilk makes the difference. I sometime add a SMALL clove of garlic, crushed with a pinch of salt--use caution, but a great addition.

pretty good! the only change i made was to use fresh dill instead of dried. oh, and no buttermilk, so i used powdered. next time i think i'll make it with sour cream instead of buttermilk as i'd like something a bit thicker. or maybe half sour cream half buttermilk. anyway, delicious! i've been scarfing down the fresh veggies!

I reviewed all the other ranch recipes on epi and this seemed to be the best from the reviews. I wanted a low fat version, so I used one one part buttermilk to one part low fat mayo - it was very thick. No one else has complained of this with a higher mayo to milk ratio - so perhaps the emulsifiers in the low fat mayo... anyway I would prefer too thick to too thin (hence the need for low fat ranch I guess). Great use of herbs from the garden and very tasty. Does not have that tasty MSG flavor from the Hidden Valley powder. But the freshness makes up for it.

I made a few modifications (using only the ingredients I had on hand) and I was very pleased with the result. So long to buying store bought ranch dressing. This recipe is a keeper.

I couldn't find the powdered buttermilk, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. We enjoyed it very much and will certainly make again.

We added fresh cracked peppercorns and some parmesan cheese, serving it over a salad topped with corn-meal and parmesan crusted chicken breasts. Fabulous!

I wasn't sure how this recipe would turn out since there were quite a few raters who thought the recipe was not that great. But, I've been looking for a homemade ranch dressing recipe to replace the store bought bottled kind my kids love so much. Well, I have found it in this recipe. My kids loved it (ages 6 and 8) and I loved it too. Now, instead of onion powder I used garlic powder (I didn't the the onion powder on hand) and I used some ground celery seed to replace the celery leaves that I didn't have. My spices were dried rather than fresh (2 heaping tsp of parsley and almost double the amount of dill called for). Also, I used a little extra buttermilk to replace the buttermilk powder I didn't have. In my opinion this was a great recipe, perfect balance of flavors and it will be a staple in my fridge from now on.

Due to a lack of things in the pantyr, I used garlic salt instead of onion and spicy honey mustard instead of dijon. It turned out well enough that my kids liked it.

I was really disappointed in this dressing. By the looks of the recipe, it has all the makings of a great combination of flavors but is definitely lacking. I even tried to spice it up by adding tabasco, garlic and lemon pepper but to no avail. This is one dressing recipe that I won't be trying again. Still in search of the fabulous ranch dressing...who knew it would be so difficult??

I was looking for something a little less artificial than store-bought ranch dressing. I thought the reviews made this look promising, but wow was I disappointed. Too sweet and too thin for my tastes. My friends were similarly disappointed by it. Would not recommend this recipe at all.

I added chives and extra parsley and dill to this recipe. I love the fact that this recipe tastes so fresh, unlike bottled ranch that is loaded with chemicals and junk. I used it as a veggie dip. Yummmm!

wow- this is a great dressing recipe! I did not have any buttermilk powder, so I just made it without, but I did increase all the herbs and added salt and lots of fresh ground pepper. I served it over a wedge of iceburg lettuce w/ roasted beets, julienned carrots and snipped chives. my guests raved about it.

Have made this many times. I use fresh dill, and have lovage in my garden which is a good substitute for the celery leaves. I also add a dash of tabasco.

Actually, I have a question to the recipe. Can I substitute something else for the powdered cultured buttermilk blend. I live in Germany and I'm not sure what I can use instead of this.

I hate to be a 'kill-joy' here, but it was just okay. My guests agreed that there just wasn't enough flavor (I was also surprised that it didn't get more flavorful over time). Add a bit more onion powder and use FRESH dill if you like a flavorful ranch dressing.

The first time I made this I swore off bottled and packaged mixes for health reasons. The second time ,I was out of lemons and so I left them out and Wow, it got even better. It seems to get tastier as time goes on too. I now tripple the recipe and have it on hand all the time. We use it as a chip and veggie dip too.

This is a great dressing. We had it last night with spinach,mango and hot shrimp and it was delicious...we made a meal of it.

This dressing was perfect as a dip too, especially with Crudités. I used a food processor to make the whole thing thick and creamy.

Fantastic! I can now enjoy baby carrots and celery again. I gave up on store bought ranch dressings (read: Hidden Valley) since they inevitably contain MSG (to which I am hugely allergic).

Made a big impression on my guests, that being italians, never tasted ranch dressing before....finally I can eat my veggies with my favorite dip away from the states!!!!!!!!!!

I have made this dressing so many times. I use 3/4 c. buttermilk and 1/2 c. mayo to cut the fat a little. I also prefer a little less dijon. Using the buttermilk powder I think really makes a difference, and I never leave it out. Every time I make this I always double the recipe because it just disappears so fast!

This is an excellent ranch dressing recipe. I added extra lemon and a little more fresh parsley. I also added pepper. Much better the next day. I located the celery leaves and powdered buttermilk quite easily in the store. Wonderful with a cobb salad! YUM!

This was a wonderful way to use some leftover buttermilk. I didn't have the powdered buttermilk or the celery and it was wonderful. I'll try it with the other ingredients next time.

This is the recipe I was always looking for. I did't use the powdered cultured buttermilk blend. I also made it without the celery leaves. I made it four times already and love it.

Once you've made this dressing, you'll never go back to bottled. It is fresh beyond compare; however, I find it very labor-intensive and thus do not make it as often as I'd like. Also, finding enough celery leaves on the celery in the market is rather challenging. This is excellent mixed in twice-baked potatoes or even over mashed potatoes.

This was good; next time I would use less mayo and more buttermilk, more like equal amounts of each. "Powdered buttermilk culture" is an item unknown to Miami, so I don't know what I'm missing. The dressing could have used a touch more tang; is that what the extra ingredient supplies?

I have tried both recipes, and they are very good.

I didn't make the Confetti Salad that this dressing originally accompanied, but it is quite good on mixed greens.
