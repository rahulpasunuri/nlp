I added some English cucumber in order to use it up. Following another user's suggestion, I used half mayo and half yogurt. (Next time I think I'd use full mayo.) And because I didn't have almonds, I used toasted sesame seeds that I put right in the salad, rather than on top. Nice, bright and light flavors. Definitely would make again.

YUM YUM YUM!!! this is absolutley delicious! I made this salad with bbq chicken breast marinated with chilli and garlic and it went down a treat. LOVE the crunchy toasted almonds and cumin seeds. Beautiful salad - an absolute crowd pleaser.

This was a great summer dish I made a while ago. Very refreshing. Just serve it with something green, and maybe some bread.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had. I wish I could give it five stars! The flavors complement each other perfectly. I would not change one thing about this recipe.

I found this to be just so-so -- not particularly flavorful, despite the cumin seeds. If I were ever to make it again, which I doubt I will, I'd substitute lowfat yogurt for the mayonnaise to make it more healthful, and add more flavor, possibly cilantro.

I thought the cumin was a bit strong, and will reduce it next time, but the nectarine was a great complement.

Boring! Really disappointed - made according to recipe except for ground cumin instead of cumin seeds.

Very fast and easy. I had most of the ingredients already in my pantry - always a plus! But I still thought it was just okay. There are other similar salads on this site that are better - I like the Curried Chicken Salad much more.

Forgot to include red onion, would have been good foil to nectarine. Don't care for the toasted cumin. Will use ground next time. No lemon in the house, so used grapefruit juice. No lettuce, so ate it straight. Good and light-tasting but filling nonetheless. Takes very little time to make if chicken is already cut up. Will remember this next time I have leftover cooked poultry.

I had this at a dinner party and thought it delicious. I served it recently at a luncheon, to many rave reviews.

A wonderful recipe. I used ground cumin and it was delicious. my mother said she normally doesn't like cumin but loved this salad.

Delicious, beautiful presentation, and easy to make. Didn't have red onion, so I substituted 2 large shallots. It was perfect.

A perfect use for the grilled nectarine wedges I prepared for the previous night's dinner (and then promptly forgot to serve!) And I echo the belief that whole toasted seeds beat the ground stuff for this recipe

Definitely use the cumin seeds. I did crush them lightly with the back of a spoon before adding them to the dressing. Wish I had doubled the batch because I wanted leftovers. Next time I will.

In response to all the reviewers who substituted ground cumin for the toasted seeds, especially the reviewer who suggested they would turn out like crunchy bugs, I would like to suggest they try the recipe again using the cumin seeds as recommended before deciding upon the substitution. This is one of those cases where a close substitution is just not close enough. I've been cooking for years with toasted cumin seeds. (Try tossing some into the oil before the rice when making pilaf.) I can assure you of two things: the taste is subtly but specifically different (like the difference between peppercorn sauce and black pepper from the kitchen shaker) and there is absolutely no bug-crunch effect. If I am ever out of cumin seeds (which is not often since I buy them in huge bags at Indian markets)I delay making a recipe that calls for them till I have the real deal in the pantry. imoh.

I also used ground cumin, as that was what I already had. Served on greens with tomato, avacado, and peach slices on the side. Looked and tasted great!

Delicious and very tasty for a late summer supper. By mistake I used peaches instead of nectarines. Would also be good with papaya or mangoes.

Delicious - I also used ground cumin - and wouldn't change anything. Great combination.

To soulchef: Actually whole toasted cumin is just great. I have an indian dish with carrots, toasted cumin and cocunut. They are small enough that they look like ground black pepper, but you know it is cumin when you bite into one!

Really tasty and unusual. I used ground cumin (toasted it though) and also added lettuce into the tossed salad. Quite nice summer eating.

If you make this recipe with all the ingredients suggested, fresh nectarines in season, it is delicious. I used fresh ground cumin which adds a savory taste to the sweet nectarines.

I haven't made this yet, but it seems that they forgot to say to grind the cumin after toasting. I certainly would, otherwise the cumin seeds would be look and feel like crunchy little bugs! ;-)

I followed the recipe fairly closely, used white nectarines, and we loved it. The salad was even better the next day. Served on fresh greens from the garden & garlic toast!

This was very good - I would make it again but not often because its a little unusual. I cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 teas. of ground cumin instead of toasted cumin seeds and it was just as good. I also, to save time, used a small can of drained yellow diced cling peaches with no added sugar instead of nectarine and a TBL. of cilantro for added color and flavor. Excellent, my husband loved it.
