If you make the sauce and mayo a few days ahead this is not that time consuming. I also sub about 1/4 cup lemon olive oil from Almafi, Italy (try lemon olive oil) for grapeseed for added lemon flavor. I also get peeled cloves from Whole Mo (Foods) that cuts down on time. Not a quick meal but a good weekend or company dish.

Well, I'll try this someday, but this hardly qualifies for a quick meal. Anything that involves 37 peeled garlic cloves as just one ingredient takes some time

This is a great recipe for a quick meal.
