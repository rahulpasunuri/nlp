So, after reading some comments on these being bland I decided to make a few additions and all I can say is WOW! I doubled the recipe and added the following - 6 quick fried jalepnos, finely chopped, 2 large cloves of minced garlic, 6 green onions, greens and all, chili lime seasoning, and a big handful of finely chopped cilantro. Needless to say, these were anything but bland! I served them with a creamy cilantro lime dip. I'm just glad I tried one before setting them out because they were gone before I knew it!

I made these the first time with black bean soup (drained and patted dry), because I accidently opened the can before I reaalized what it was. The result was much tastier than the second time with plain beans, probably because the soup beans were cooked with ham flavor. These are great leftover for lunch straight from the fridge, and mine were not dry at all, kind of a hushpuppy with black beans and cheese. Use very sharp, high quality cheddar.

I thought these were quite tasty. They are a little sturdier than your usual fritter, and still taste good even if not eaten immediately. Best of all, kids really liked them.

I found this dish to be very tasty! My only concern is that it takes a healthy ingredient (black beans) and makes them less so by frying.

I made this as a spur of the moment dish, because i had all the ingedients on hand. They were just OK. Kind of on the dry, bland side.
