I love this recipe. I found it years ago in a magazine but misplaced my copy. I was thrilled to find it on this web site. I make this tart whenever apricots are in season. I believe there is a step missing in this copy, you are supposed to heat the apricaot jam and put it through a sieve before using it.

This was sooo easy and really good! I think it would work well with any fruit/jam combination. A great quick dessert for summer.

This recipe came out just as pictured. I used canned almond flavored apricot halves instead of fresh and it was still delightful!
