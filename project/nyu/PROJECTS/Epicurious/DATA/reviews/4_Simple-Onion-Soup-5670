I've made this several times and it is excellent! I slice the onions very thin and cook them over medium-low heat until they are a dark golden brown. And it only takes a couple of minutes for the cheese to melt in a 500 degree oven.

So simple and the result is great. The onion should be very thinly sliced and don't use the tough outer layer. Also, the cheese could be thicker than called for.

Super easy and tastes great. Make sure to use the full flavor beef broth or it loses a little something with the fat free kind.

Very, very easy and delicious. Only change I made was to saute a couple of cloves of garlic with the onion (I used sweet), which I then removed. I will definitely be making this again.

Great base recipe. With a few adjustments, it was one of the best onion soups we've made. Used 1/2 sweet onion and 1/2 yellow and it was wonderful. Added brandy and dijon mustard. Campbells brand broth made all the difference. Will never use anything else! Wow! Thanks for the suggestion.

Very, very good. Would use four cans of broth (not sodium reduced) and add freshly chopped thyme.

I made no changes to this recipe and it turned out delicious!!!! I wouldn't change a thing. I used homemade croutons using a great recipe from this site (caesar salad with herbed croutons. I only had Knorr beef broth on hand, but next time I will try it with the Campbells broth as reviewers have suggested, to see if there is a big difference.

With a few minor changes, this soup was absolutely wonderful. I added a pinch of sugar to the onions and used 3 tablespoons of butter. Once the onions were cooked, I added 1 Tablespoon of flour to the butter/onion mixture to thicken the soup a bit. For the onions, I used farmer's market red and white onions (looked like huge scallions). I used 1 cup of dry red wine and 1 Tablespoon fresh thyme. So easy and so delicious.

I suggest Campbell's Consumme instead of the broth and sprinkly in a little thyme while cooking. Also, try using several different kinds of onions together.

I made this recipe for a Saturday afternoon where a few friends came over. Paired the soup with grilled cheese, and it was a hit. The only thing I would change would be less onions and french bread.

My husband said this is the best onion soup he ever tasted. I also used Campbell's beef broth...deelish ! Used swiss AND mozzarella on top ! Will definitely make again and again !

I just wanted to say that this is almost the exact recipe my mom has, except she doesn't put wine in hers. It is so simple and so delicious! But we have found that the "brand" of beef broth is what makes the difference. We use ONLY Campbell's Beef Broth. I guess homemade would be good, too, but if you use canned, use Campbells! ENJOY!

This was wonderful and easy -- perfect for a cold winter evening. I added a few bay leaves while the soup was simmering to add some flavor.
