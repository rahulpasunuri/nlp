Served with fresh crusty bread, this made the perfect day after Thanksgiving dinner, especially with the addition of dried mushrooms as suggested by other reviewers (plus some of the water leftover from reconstituting them). I doubled the recipe, added bagged baby spinach instead of watercress, and boiled the tortellini separately. That way I could feed adults the soup the day after Thanksgiving and allow the kids to choose to eat tortellini with a traditional marinara if they preferred. Plus there was leftover soup to freeze for another day.

The whole family liked this recipe. I used chopped fresh spinach instead of the watercress, which was unavailable at our market. When I come across watercress, I'll try it again.

This soup was OK, but rather bland. I wish I had seen the other reviews recommending adding porcinis or parmesan rind, as these might have helped it have more flavor. I added extra leftover turkey meat (about 2 cups) after straining the soup and doubled the amount of tortellini.

This was tasty. I made it the day after thanksgiving and put it in several freezer bags. We pulled it out when we came down with a cold and it hit the spot!

This is a great way to use up a turkey. I too added a packet of porcini mushrooms, strained the soup and then added fresh cut up carrots, a few rinds of parmesan cheese and spinnach. The cheese rinds added a touch of richness and flavor the soup needed.

I made this soup with the leftover Thanksgiving turkey and everyone in my family LOVED it. I heard how "awesome" it was, and everyone asked for seconds (some for thirds and fourths)! I made the recipe just as described and will make it again.

I always forget how delicious this soup is. It's an easy way to completely use the holiday turkey. This time I added a packet of dried porcini mushrooms to the broth while the bones were simmering, and they added a particularly rich flavor.

This recipe is great. I did not make it verbatim though as I thought it may be a little bland. I added some fresh chopped garlic to the stock and used garlic salt as well as salt and pepper to taste. In addition, I added some baby portabella mushrooms and sugar snap peas at the end. It was delicious!

Awesome. The broth is so flavorful! I used spinach instead of the watercress. This will be a definite regular whenever we have leftover turkey.

I used this recipe for my left-over turkey from Christmas dinner and to freeze for later. I therefore did not add the watercress. I used frozen tortellini. Next time, I'll use fresh. I added fresh grated Romano cheese upon serving. It is wonderful!

made some modifications, used turkey stock, made with all the veg from above and apples with sage rosemary and thyme. Then strained it.Then started again with sautee onions in butter, add flour, stir, add stock skip fennel add thyme instead. add roasted root vegetables and 4 cheese tortellini. Boil 20 min, take it down to simmer and add a cup of cream. And oh ma gawd it's good. totally different recipe, i know. But I was inspired by the original, somewhat!

This soup is very easy to make. Unfortunately we could not find watercress anywhere this week, so we substituted baby spinach. The flavor of this soup is great!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe! However, I added the vegetables right back in with the turkey meat. A great blend of flavors. In fact, my 8 year old put it right up there with his favorite meals!

I've made this soup with leftover Thanksgiving turkey every year since the recipe first appeared in 1991. Everyone from kids to grandparents likes it.

This is a fantastic recipe, both delicate and delicious. I recommend using the freshest tortellini you can find, preferably with a hint of garlic. Oh, yum!
