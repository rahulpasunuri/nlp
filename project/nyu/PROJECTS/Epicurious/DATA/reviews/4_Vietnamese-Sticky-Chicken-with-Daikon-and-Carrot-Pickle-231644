We made this as instructed except for the grilling part. It's was snowing so we put the chicken pieces on skewers and broiled them instead. In order to broil them for long enough, I had to switch pans part way through because the sweet marinade was burning and smoking. The overall dish seemed very healthy and was satisfying. But there wasn't a lot of flavor in the chicken itself, and it seemed like a dipping sauce could have helped with this. We also tried to reheat the chicken the next day, and it was not as good. It was a lot of work for rather mediocre reward.

Made this one for at least the third time-so simple and so good. Definitely use the gas grill-great flavor and no pan to clean

I am in culinary school and we made this recipe in class. I am not big on healthy cooking but this was really good. I am going to make it at home for my family. I really enjoyed the recipe

Really love this recipe. I would have given it 4 but I reduced the amount of total sugar (2 Tbs in a doubled batch of marinade) and marinated the chicken all day while I was at work. We enjoyed a mix of boneless, skinless breasts and thighs in these wraps.

I thought this was simple yet fresh and good. I found the recipe because I had leftover Daikon Radishes that I didn't know what to do with. I did have a bit of trouble rolling it in a lettuce leaf as suggested.

Great for a quick summer dinner. I doubled the marinade but only used 2T sugar total, and next time I would cut the sugar in the pickle too. Didn't have daikon, used carrots and cucumbers.

A great find. Had some great daikon from my CSA still in the fridge and as usual went looking on Epi for a new idea. Used the 2x2 disk on my Cusinart to make quick work for the pickle prep but suggestions from other reviewers for coleslaw mix etc. will be handy for an even speedier solution. I was a bit low on unseasoned rice vinegar so used some seasoned along with seasoned a tad less sugar and salt and a splash of apple cider for kick. I sliced the chicken slightly thicker (maybe more like half and inch) and then cooked in a cast iron pannini press. In the summer would definitely use grill. Served it with steamed basmati rice - no lettuce leaves on hand but will remember that part when I have great spring lettuce. Definitely a keeper and can't wait to try as Bahn Mi!!

Excellent! I doubled the marinade. Sriracha is a must! Ate them in lettuce as suggested. I made this for four people, and we had soup, and it was devoured. I would double the recipe for four people next time.

GREAT!!! I decreased the sugar in the daikon/carrot vinegar mixture but other than that kept things the same. I also doubled chicken marinade and tossed 1/2 with the rice noodles as another reviewer suggested. It's easy to serve a large quantity so it's a great meal for guests. I look forward to doing that.

Enjoyed the chicken! I think this might be better on skewers... the chicken strips were a bit thin but very tasty. Definitely will make again.

I just made it tonight and it was delish. Hubby loved it and it's so easy. We love Vietnamese and Thai food, so we usually have all the ingredients handy. Will totally make this one again and again.

Fantastic! The chicken has so much flavor, and it all comes from ingredients I already had in the pantry and came together quickly. I used the shredding disc of the food processor to cut the carrots and daikon. This may be my new favorite chicken recipe.

I too served this on buns with mayo. My pickles I made with carrots, cucumber and onion. It was a very tasty meal.

So yummy and easy -- the daikon gets toned down once you marinate it

Another winner. I made this for a dinner party in a big batch and it was a hit. It's a little on the sweet side for me so I will definitely reduce the sugar. But now I make the pickles frequently to have them around because they are great with this dish and with sandwiches and salads. Super easy and very fast. It's great with the mint.

i made twice the marinade and put chicken in half, then tossed chicken in other half after cooking it. served over cold rice noodles with shredded lettuce and cucumber added to the other veggies. fresh herbs make the dish, don't skimp. also added chopped peanuts to the top. light,delicious and attractive.

Restaurant quality, very tasty. I skipped the fish sauce and used extra lime juice and sriracha instead. I served it as a rice bowl; brown rice on bottom, chicken and pickles topped with shredded Boston lettuce, mint, basil, and crushed peanuts. We'll definitely make this again soon.

very good! I just used some thin- sliced carrots and cucumbers for pickling. Cooked the chicken outside on the grill griddle and it got a nice carmelized flavor to it.

Delicious. I used chicken thighs and cooked them in the oven on 450 and turned up the broiler the last 5 minutes. Also, used red radishes instead of daikon. Will definitely make this again.

This is very tasty. I used cucumbers because that was the only fresh "pickle-able" veggie I had. Also served with brown rice, chopped green onions sliced jalapenos and cilantro leaves. Yum.

This was a huge hit at our Vietnamese-themed dinner party. Super easy to make, delicious and fun to eat!

This was a little bland and I followed the recipe by the book. I have make several Vietnamese chicken recipes and this is my least favorite, it just didn't have that intense flavor I was looking for and expecting with yummy fish sauce. The pickled veggies were pretty good.

This is a fantastic dish! I've made it several times. I make a few changes: english cucumber instead of daikon; it's easier for me to find. Pre-shreded carrots make the work faster. I use the zest of the lime as well as the juice. I make extra marinade to simmer on the side and use as sauce for rice. I've done it with tofu so it can be vegetarian too. Even if you follow the recipe exactly, like I did the first time I made it, it's great!

I doubled this recipe for a party of 9, along with a vegetarian main dish. There was plenty leftover. I was worried it might be too spicy for the general public, but everyone loved it. I didn't make any changes except the use of lemongrass and I let it simmer longer than called for. Lots of chopping, but worth it!

I found this recipe a while ago, and by now it is a true family favorite. My 15 year-old daughter love it, and in fact, the whole family does. I highly recommend this recipe for its fresh flavors, and it is also a fairly inexpensive dish to make. Try it--it's a delight!! (Now I just have to teach my Congolese cook how to make it...)

This was fantastic!! Just a bonus that it happens to be both healthy and easy as well. My boyfriend gave this a 10/10! Used broccoli slaw (preshredded mix of broccoli, carrots and red cabbage) instead of chopping my own veggies...saved a lot of time.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe! I made exactly as directed, but served on a french roll with mayonaise- similar to Bahn Mi, a vietnamese sandwich made from BBQ pork, chicken, or beef with carrot/daikon slaw, cilantro and mayo served on a crusty french roll. So delicious, and tasted almost EXACTLY like the ones I used to get at my favorite vietnamese restaurant that closed down about 9 months ago! I'll be making these again and again.

My family loves this recipe. I have made it just like the recipe, and I have substituted other shredded veggies, and my family just loves the fresh taste every time. This is one of our family's comfort recipes now.

Wow! This was *so* easy and the chicken was extremely moist. Lettuce leaves is a little too low-cal for us, so my husband stuffed his in a pita and I had some rice on the side, which I drizzled with the extras from the pickle. Not a big daicon fan, though. Will use another veggie like the previous person mentioned.

Family loved it; so easy that we made it twice in two weeks. We used other veggies for the slaw - whatever was in the frig - thin sliced onions/red pepper/cabbage.
