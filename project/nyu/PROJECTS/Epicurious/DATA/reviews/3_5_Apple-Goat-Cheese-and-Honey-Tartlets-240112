I thought these were delicious, though my husband was slightly weirded out by the presence of goat cheese in a dessert. I sweetened the cheese slightly with 2 tablespoons of sugar and used pre-made puff pastry shells.

So easy to prepare, and so wonderful to eat! The one thing I heard over and over was they aren't too sweet. Looks like you spent hours, when in fact they're so easy. I mixed half mascarpone cheese and goat cheese, but followed the recipe otherwise. Cheese had great texture and added delicious richness. The honey adds just the right sweetness. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. This is a real autumn winner.

These tartlets were absolutely incredible! I made them for a gourmet dinner group, and they were a huge hit. Since the recipe was fairly simple, I decided to challenge myself by making my own puff pastry. I used Joanne Chang's recipe from the Flour bakery cookbook, and it was amazing. I'm sure the store-bought pastry or pre-formed shells are also great with this. I sweetened my goat cheese mixture with a little sugar (and left out the salt) since I was worried about it not being sweet enough. Other than that, I followed the recipe closely and was thrilled with the results! (Here is the blog post I wrote about it: http://ashleydickson.com/?p=1908)

I made this for Christmas and now have friends who request I make it every time we get together. I used some of the suggestions made by other reviewers, like using the preformed puff pastry shells (although they will be slightly smaller). I loved that when I was in a rush to put this together for a party once and messed up the measurements here or there, it didn't really affect the delicious outcome in a way anyone could tell. :)

I thought this was just okay. As much as I love goat cheese and apples, they really didn't work well together. Another problem I had was that everything came out dry- the pastry, the apples and the goat cheese. Maybe with some tweaking...

So simple and a perfect end to a big heavy meal! My dinner party of 10 guests loved them. I served them warm straight out of the oven with glasses of champagne. I too used the puff pastry to save some time and the only change was i ended up cooking for 25 mins instead of 35 mins. A little trick - do not open the oven while they are cooking, turn on the oven light to keep an eye on them. Puff pastry needs the humidity that grows in the oven to rise! Every time you open the oven you lessen the chance your puff pastry will rise tall and pretty.

This was so easy to prepare, and I cooked them in the toaster oven! I didn't have to heat up the entire house for this. I added a lot more honey when serving because it was so good to dip the pastry in it. This is a keeper!!

This recipe was easy (I too used pre-made puff pastry shells). It had a nice combination of simple flavors and was a pleasant desert though I do not think I would make it again - it was not anything special. For those who don't like sweet desserts or who enjoy cheese plates - this may be a nice substitute.

I thught this recipe was absolutely delicious! I used puff pastry shells b/c I couldn't find the pastry dough. So, the honey/butter mixture ended up sliding right off the tartlets, and burned the bottoms slightly. But I managed to salvage them by adding more honey/butter after they were cooked. They still tasted great! They only thing I would do differently is perhaps add a little sugar to the goat cheese mixture. The lemon juice made it a little too tart for my taste.

really light, fabulous with an Italian Muscato. I did not find I needed all the apples. The Honey Butter mixture was heaven...however would have preferred salted butter. Fantastic!

I made this for Christmas breakfast, and it was a huge hit! It was suprisingly easy as well. Even my sister who hates goat cheese loved it!

I, along with my entire family, loved this recipe!! I used a puff pastry and made it look like an apple turnover, and used regular honey. It came out delicious!!

I also used mini puff pastry shells- baked them for half the time that they were supposed to be baked, them stuffed them with the honey, cheese mixture, topped with tiny slices of apple, and then baked for the remaining time.

this recipe was delicious. i used mini puff pastry shells which need to be baked beforehand. i put the cheese mixture in a baggy and piped it into each shell and topped with small piece of apple. I also added honey to the cheese. Much easier prep, even my kids loved it! I would (and have) use it again.

My boyfriend says this is the best dessert I've ever made. I used regular old honey and it was still delicious. I've made it a couple times and once used the small pre made puff pastry shells (they were too small). This dessert is sophisticated and a crowd pleaser.

Beautiful, impressive, and delicious. Fairly easy, too. This recipe rocked.

Delicious and easy. I used regular honey and didn't make "rings." I just cut up a pastry sheet into four pieces (making half of a recipe) and made them square.

Very good, but I would not use dark honey again. I only used about half dark, and I still regretted it.

looked beautiful but didn't care for the combination of flavors at all

I served this for my guests last night and everybody was amazed!!! Did exactly as written and everybody loved the goat cheese. The mix of apple, honey and goat chhese really gives a sophisticated ttaste, plus the presentation is really imprressive. Idid it ahead of time and reheated just before serving it. Will definitely do it again!

as stated above, this was definitely an easy crowd-pleaser. i've made it twice and the second time substituted cream cheese because i also thought goat cheese was too strong (and i also LOVE goat cheese). next time i think i will add some sugar or honey to the cheese mixture.

Good tastes, but not enough apples. I baked extra apple slices with butter and honey, and added them to the finished tarts.

As a pastry chef myself, I found this recipe to be quite wonderful. It's a lovely and easy dessert to prepare ahead of time and serve to dinner guest, plus it is quite the crowd pleaser. Even if you're not all that inclined in the kitchen, it's very straight forward and the puff pastry is done for you, that's more than half the battle! Great recipe!

This was a great recipe. I but if I make it again, I would make sure to use a more mild goat cheese, because that flavor can be overpowering. I also used less than 5 ounces of goat cheese instead of 6. I would slice the apples a little thicker, because they cook down, and find a way to get the apples to brown a little more. The butter/honey mixture worked really well in browning the crust. This is a unique, nicely presented apple dessert. I would definitely make this again.

This was a delicious recipe and fairly easy to make. There are a few things I would change for next time to make it a "4 fork". I thought there was a little too much goat cheese...and this is coming from someone who LOVES goat cheese! I also though the filling was a little thick and not as sweet as I would like, although the flavors were right. I think I would add some honey to the goat cheese next time and cut the amount of filling slightly. I think this is a great recipe to experiment with and make your own.
