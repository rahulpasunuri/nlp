It is funny how this recipe got me thinking of another recipe (also for Epicurious)cranberry-apple compote. This can take you places if you try.

This made an exceptional fruit salad. I used 2 star anise, which I felt was sufficient, an extra cinnamon stick and no vanilla bean. As there are no nectarines available now, I used 2 tins of a mandarin orange/peach combination. I'll definitely be making this many times this summer!
