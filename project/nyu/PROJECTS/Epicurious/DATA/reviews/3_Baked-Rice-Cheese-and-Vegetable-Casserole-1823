I've made this a few times now and everyone loves it. I usually put in extra fresh cream and cheese (especially on top). My guests have commented how they like the green pepper as it gives the dish more umph.

I gave this 4 forks because it is an exceptional recipe. I, too, changed the ingredients to what I had on hand (roasted zucchini, carrots, red pepper and yellow squash); warmed them in butter, added the rice, dried thyme, half of a bag of leftover baby spinach, mexican cheese blend (again, had on hand) and a can of diced sweet onion tomatoes. Wow, it was wonderful! It's the recipe that makes this....adding the cream (in my case, 1/4 cup ) gave it a scrumptiousness that otherwise might be lacking. As the reviews attest, it can be anything you want it to be! I made it last minute and will be making it again and again with whatever I have on hand!

Excellent side dish for potlucks or home meals! I was looking to use some wild rice that I had slightly oversalted and I thought that a casserole might make it more palatable. I used what I had: a red onion, mixed frozen veggies (green bean, carrot, baby lima and green pea), cherry tomatoes, cheddar, and poultry seasoning instead of plain thyme. I also added a dash of garlic powder. The combination of the purple color of the onion with the brown of the wild rice and the colors of the various veggies was beautiful! It was literally photo- worthy and it was a hit at a potluck. I'll be making it again next week.

I have to revise my prior review of this, in which I arrogantly claimed I could tell it would be too bland as written. I was wrong! This time I made it with water and no garlic, just as written. I did add broccoli florets to make it a main course, orange instead of green pepper, cheddar instead of swiss, and a tiny amount of salt and pepper, but those are not major changes in terms of how assertive the flavor is, in my view. It was delicious and comforting, and not bland. I think you could have it without the cheese topping and broiling, to be honest, which saves calories.

I made this with some changes to the types of veggies and cheese called for, chicken stock to cook the rice, and the addition of some garlic. I am experienced enough as a cook to know it would have been slightly too bland without the changes. But regardless, this is essentially a yummy and comforting recipe, and given that it is intended to be a side dish, I don't think should be held to the standard of a stunning entree. Throw in some garlic, stock, and/or more spice if you want something main course worthy. This is a good base.

Tasty but not excellent. I substituted fresh peas for the corn, but everything else according to the recipe. The Swiss and thyme are an interesting combination. I could see how this would be a good base recipe for different veggies, cheeses, and herbs.

So decadent and so good, this recipe is customizable so you can make it with whatever leftover veggies you have on hand.

I, too, made changes because I expected a bland result otherwise. I added 2 chopped roasted chicken breasts. For veggies I used one orange bell pepper, 1/2 a sweet onion, a package of pre-sliced mushrooms, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I omitted the thyme and added plenty of salt and pepper, along with 4 shakes of tabasco (could have taken even more). For cheeses I used a mixture of cheddar and jack. I spread it in a 9x13 and baked it for 30 min with the cheese on top. Very good - and enough for 6.

The only changes I made were: red pepper instead of green and oregano instead of thyme. It was a good,colorful dish, great for a weeknight.

I recently made this dish for a potluck dinner. I doubled the recipe and added broccoli and a red pepper. This is a very simple dish to make and you can easily add your own touch by changing or adding different spices and/or veggies.

Forgot to add that I use half can evaporated milk for creaminess and one egg to bind the mixture. My husband really loved it and my little niece and nephew had seconds (very gratifying)!

Too much fat, not enough nutritive value or flavor. I thought the corn was overkill for carbs; the rice alone does it for me, and the sweetness of the cheese and onion is sufficient contrast to the savory taste. Brown rather than white rice ups the fiber and texture if you like brown rice. I deleted the bell pepper because it imparted a bitter taste that overwhelmed the mildness of the swiss cheese, subbing chopped pre-cooked broccoli (spinach, squeezed of excess fluid, would work also) instead. I got more flavor and less fat by adding more onion, shredded parmesan (or cheddar) instead of whipping cream, and Pam instead of butter to saute the onion. Mushrooms add complexity. I also added chopped, sauteed chicken for a full-meal dish. Sorry, I guess I've totally changed the dish! Just didn't think it was worth the effort as is.

Made this last night to rave reviews from my vegetarian husband, though the recipe definitely doesn't look like it could garner such enthusiasm! I added Panko based on the excellent suggestion, and I definitely recommend it. Used aged Gruyere, a red bell pepper, real cream and fresh thyme - the fresh thyme really seemed to make this dish. I'm caving into all the begging and making it again today with pepper jack cheese, red pepper, salsa, and cumin in place of the thyme - this is a perfect weeknight dish.

I make this as an entree, adding chopped ham or turkey. Also sub peas for corn sometimes, and add some carribean seasoning to give it some umph. Also sometimes sub 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes if the fresh ones are not in season. I use milk not cream and it tastes fine. It is a good dish to make on the weekend and then heat and eat during the week. Also great to take to a sick friend as it is variety from the pasta everyone else sends.

Rating: 3
I served this dish as a main, and it was definitely filling enough for a good meal. Try substituting canned plum tomatoes and sour cream for the fresh tomato and whipping cream. They made the casserole richer and more colorful too! A great comfort food guaranteed to please a wide variety of tastes. I'll be making this again soon!

I can't figure out why people say this dish is bland... it all depends on how much you're comfortable improvising with recipes. I added a couple of tablespoons of tamari and nutritional yeast to the rice cooker to give the rice some oomph. I used extra onion and also sauteed some garlic (bc I never leave out the garlic). I also added a box of frozen spinach together with the frozen corn and omitted the bell pepper (didn't have any). I wasn't inspired by the cheese suggestion, so I used some delicious Cotswald cheddar with flecks of thyme and a nice smooth Madrigal swiss, 50-50. I topped off the casserole with the extra cheese and then a layer of Japanese panko flakes for some much-needed crunch. It turned out great - panko is a must-have for this recipe.

Use roasted hatch chilies instead of bell pepper, cheddar and parmesan instead of swiss, and omit the thyme for a great fall southwestern flavor.

Very easy and a great recipe to modify. I used a variety of veggies (carrot, celery, cauliflower and broccoli) and two cheeses. It came out great--even my two year old loved it!

I just used vegi's I had on hand. This is one of those recipies where you always have the ingredients in the house. Made the day before, refridgerated and baked for 25 min while finishing main course. Foolproof and tasty-leftovers are great!

This recipe was wonderful comfort food! I used long grain rice cooked in chicken broth for added flavor, left out the corn and substituted green beans, plus added a cup or so of mixed veggies- yellow squash, zucchini, and broccoli. I had chicken left over from previous night's dinner and so cut it into bite size pieces and threw it in at the end. I also used medium sharp cheddar cheese (roughly a little more than 1/2 cup, which I used in the broiler step) and used 1 cup mozzarella instead. With these slight adjustments it turned out great- I am enjoying leftovers right now- yum yum! Oh, and don't forget salt and pepper!

Try this adaptation: rice, green or yellow squash, onion, 2 cans of chopped green chiles, tomatoes, cheese and curry powder to taste

This dish is so yummy it can stand alone. I deleted the corn and swiss cheese and added mushrooms and 1/2 cup of low-fat cheddar and 1/2 cup of monterey jack. I just sprinkled a handful of the jack over the top before broiling (probably not a whole extra cup). I also added a handful of fresh parsley. I'll probably make it again soon!

Made this as a side for salmon. It was delish. Also left out corn and added 'shrooms. The cream makes it so don't leave it out.

I read all the reviews and decided to give this recipe a try despite some of the warnings. I was very pleased with the results. I admit that I "tweaked" it a bit due to lack of some ingredients in my cupboard. I tried the brown rice and chicken broth suggestion. I also eliminated the corn and added mushrooms.I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again as it lends itself so well to adjustments.Thanks!

I used long-grain brown rice, red pepper, and added some yellow summer squash. I also mixed in a little soft goat cheese, for an interesting twist. (I left out the cream and shredded cheese, though I used mozzarella on top.) I served it as a main dish. Not bad. :)

Although I was mindful of the "bland" warnings, I decided to make it as-is the first time just to see what it's supposed to be like. The only thing I skipped was the whipping cream because I don't like buying an ingredient when I know most of it will end up being thrown out. I would only advise others to do this if they're the sort of people who don't mind mac and cheese without the dab of butter. :) Bland? Definitely. I had the salt and pepper shakers out by the third bite. And yet somehow this recipe is a winner and I'm looking forward to next time and the time after that. I plan to ditch the corn for mushrooms since the corn's sweetness seems to detract from the savoury nature of the dish. I didn't have a problem with the amount of cheese on top, but then I love cheese and thought it could even use just a little more. (Keeping in mind that I used Swiss; that much Cheddar could be overbearing.) I also think Orange County's suggestion of broth is an excellent one, although I am going to try it with the other changes first before implementing that one. Also, for what it's worth, the rice I used was long-grain American Basmati ("Texmati") and my onion was a yellow (aka brown) one. Thumbs up!

Thanks, Orange Co! I made the recipe as you suggested and added some leftover ham to make it a main dish. Everyone loved it (kids and adults) and it's now a staple.

My family LOVED this recipe, however we heeded the "bland" warnings below. Based on those reviews the version I made was so delicious -- comfort food at it's finest -- and it was definitely not bland. I think the key was that I made the rice with chicken broth instead of water (vegetable broth would work great too). I used sharp cheddar instead of swiss cheese. I used peas, diced carrots, diced celery and sliced mushrooms instead of the corn and bell pepper. Next time I will use less than half of cheese called for in the broiling step, it was way too heavy and thick which didn't make sense in this recipe. I think this was excellent as a side dish but I would also serve it as a main course (you could add cooked chicken and it would be wonderful).

This was a great, simple recipe. I didn't have swiss cheese so used cheddar instead and it was perfect. I added chicken and peas the second time I made it, but actually ended up preferring it the way the recipe states. Definetly needs a little more salt. I ate it as a main course and took it to work the next two days.

This dish isn't supposed to be spicy or complicated in flavor: it's more of a comfort food kinda thing. My vegetarian husband liked it quite a lot. An excellent way to use up odds and ends.

Quite good but, as is, only as a side dish. As others have mentioned, it is a tad bland. I would add more thyme to give it some pizazz. It doesn't have enough character to stand on its own as a rice casserole. I didn't change anything except I omitted the corn since it seemed like too many flavors competing for attention. To make this a main course, I would add smoked turkey/chicken or shrimp.

I tried this recipe with the eternal leftover ham and it worked out great. I used green peas instead of corn, a mixed blend of cheeses, left out the tomatoe, topped it with the crunchy onions.

This was a delicious, quick casserole to throw together after work on a weeknight. We're vegetarians and thought it a very satisfying main dish. I substituted canned corn, 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes that was in the fridge for the fresh tomato, used milk instead of cream, and cut the cheese to 1 1/2 cups and it was still terrific. Did not find it bland at all, as a previous reviewer said, although I did add salt and pepper. We'll definitely keep this on our short list.
