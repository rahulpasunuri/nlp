This is my go-to recipe for special mashed potatoes - perfect with a roast. I agree with the previous poster about making sure the cooking water is properly salted - I taste and add a bit of Fleur de Sel at the end, as needed. I do not rice the potatoes, I just mash by hand the way I usually prepare mashed potatoes, and usually do not use all of the milk. I like pureeing the leeks a bit before folding the vegetables into the potatoes at the end. I have added chopped chives or green onions at the end. It's similar to colcannon.

This is very good. I added roasted garlic and lots of fresh ground black pepper. I also used cream instead of milk and added a little butter, sounding like Paula Deene now.. Delish.. I have also changed the recipe to carmelized onion instead of leek ( out of leeks, had lots of onions) and we liked it better this way. Not traditional mashers but yummy.

I love all the ingredients and made it exactly which was a little time consuming - ricing the potatoes and cooking the leeks and fennel separately. The taste was okay, did not like texture, and will not be making it again.

This is a great recipe (although I leave out the fennel since I don't like it). Make sure to boil the potatoes with enough salt as you will lose a lot of flavor if you don't. These potatoes are tasty and low fat and are a recurrent dish in my repetoire.

In a word, yuk. The flavors are muddy, the color unpleasant. Better to saute the leeks and fennel and eat them separately from a good bowl of mashed potatoes.

For the traditional mashed potato lover, this was not good.

Made it with russets, about doulbe the amount called for. This is my new favorite mashed potato recipe. It is not heavy with tons of butter, cream, or cheese and the leeks and fennel add great fresh flavor. Better the second day when the flavors have developed.

I selected this recipe, as I needed a recipe I could make ahead of time. I thought making ahead and reheating worked well, but thought the dish lacked in flavor. In addition, I didn't have a potato ricer, so the dish ended up having a bit too much texture for my taste. If I made it again, I would either be sure to have a potato ricer, or use a food processor to get a smoother texture. I would also consider adding a little salt...

I wasn't sure how the fennel would taste with the leeks but made this for my in-laws with the parmesean chicken and my husband is still talking about this 1 week later!! Will make again and again!!

I loved this recipe - easy and very delicious. I must admit that I added a bit of butter to the potatoes before mashing and did not use as much milk as the recipe called for...I also put the sauteed leeks in the food processor for a couple of spins before I put them in the potatoe mixture.

Fabulous dish. And low-fat.

I didn't leave the fennel out, since that's one of the 3 main ingredients in the dish, lol. I used whole milk instead of 1%, came out terrific.

i didn't use the fennel -b/c i don't care for the flavor - or the chicken stock - b/c i found it wasn't needed, they came out great!

A great change from potatoes soaked in butter and cream. The leeks and fennel give it a distinctive, unique flavor, which compliment the naturally buttery Yukon golds. Can be made ahead and reheated, which simplifies entertaining. I also have added left-over sauteed mushrooms for a real lift. Your guests will love this.

This was pretty cook. Didn't use fennel, but liked the leeks in it. Used regular chicken stock & it was a little salty.
