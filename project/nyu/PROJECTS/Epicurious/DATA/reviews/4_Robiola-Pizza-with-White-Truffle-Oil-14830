I didn't have time to make a crust, so I bought the fresh, raw, dough from Whole Foods. The toppings were excellent! I loved how the zucchini added a bit of crunch and lightness to this rich pizza. We'll be making it for a dinner party soon.

I love this pizza! Very earthy and satisfying, it pairs great with red and white wines...yes, there is some expense as noted by other reviewers, but the name of the game is epicurious. Epicurious being the online GOURMET and BON APPETIT, not usually words that pair well with cheap or thrifty.

I don't understand the snotty earlier review. This makes FIVE personal pizzas, or two large pizzas. I made this delicious recipe as two larger-sized pizzas, and purchased truffle oil from a local Italian specialty store. It wasn't cheap, but each pizza priced out at about $11. That's hardly expensive for pizza. With a tomato/mozzarella salad, this was a terrific meal. Next time, I'll make this pizza with the truffle oil I brought back to the State from Provence.

I agree with "Cook from Hell". I thought this pizza is awesome as made according to recipe. Great food does come with a price. I imagine that this recipe can be good with different (albeit cheaper) ingredients, but savoring the taste "as written" is much more than good - it's memorable. My super bowl guests may never make this, but they'll remember me making a truly great pizza.

Hey Michigan, that's the difference between chef and a cook...you my friend, are a cook...

I'd make it again, but not using this expensive oil. I buy mine at TRADER JOE'S for 1/10th the price. The recipe is too involved; and way too expensive. You can simply use a standard pizza dough; forget the corn meal - other than to use it as a base to PLACE THE ORDINARY DOUGH ON WHILE BAKING. Use a good cheese - don't run around searching for this rare and hard-to-find/expensive cheese. Romano worked great; Asiago also easier to find and delicious. I did NOT change the selection of mushrooms because they are VERY MUCH A PART OF ANY GOOD PIZZA (to me). Any nice 'squash' (yellow is great) that has a mild flavor is great. You can 3 or 4 different types to make a robust meal; and not be so 'gourmet' trying to smother this pizza with an expensive oil that has 120 calories for each and every tablespoon you douse it with. After you put all this oil on, you've added 600 calories to the pizza. You've spent $10 on oil - in my case, only $1.00 (if you buy it the way I do). But who needs those calories? No one. So, by the time I 'modified' this recipe, it wound up being a tremendous pizza - praised by my guests, but not being very close to this expensive rendition. One of the reasons I've stopped visiting this board is the high cost to produce; the source of the product being way over-priced, and the guests I have tell me that when I've given them the original recipe to take home, they end up tossing it because it's too time-consuming and expensive. When that's the case, most people just wind up either going out to eat, or leaving out the ingredients that create that expensive meal. I think that' the worst part of so many of these recipes found on this web-site.

The cheese was a bit hard to find, but I love white truffle oil. I bought a bottle in in NY and hadn't yet used it. The taste of the oil is so different - it really makes the pizza special. I'll make it again for Valentines Day
