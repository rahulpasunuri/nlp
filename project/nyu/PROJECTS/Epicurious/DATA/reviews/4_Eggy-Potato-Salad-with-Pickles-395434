Delicious! Everyone in our group of 11 liked this--even the children. I used more parsley and onion than called for to brighten it up.

SO delicious. Make this. You'll love it. The sweet pickles and use of pickle juice gives this a seriously yummy kick. Consistency is great. Really hard to stop eating.

Yeah, you know how this makes 8-10 servings? I made this entire dish for myself and ate all 8-10 of them in 2 1/2 days. And I am not a big eater if you know what I mean. That's just how AMAZING-ING-ING-INGLY delicious this is! (That's amazing to the 3rd or 4th degree. I don't know, I'm not a mathematician.) Make it. Eat it. Enjoy.

Egg-cellent potato salad. The pickle juice adds tons of salty deliciousness. I added a little more red onion for extra bite and texture.
