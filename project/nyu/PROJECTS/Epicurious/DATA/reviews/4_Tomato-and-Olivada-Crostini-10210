This is one of those staple recipes you can bank on being delicious, quick, make ahead-able and always well-received. Home made crostini make a difference, so take the few minutes required to produce your own as per recipe instructions. Freshly grated parmesan is well worth the effort. In addition to using the olivada recipe posted by another reviewer as a garnish for the tomato topping, I have also found pesto makes a lovely taste and colour contrast. Definitely a keeper!

This is SO delicious. It was a hit at a holiday party!! I also added fresh basil.

This is an excellent, easy to prepare hors d'oeurve. It can be made ahead and keeps well in the refrigerator. It's very savory and delicious with cocktails before dinner. It's not too heavy. It can be made year round since it utilizes canned tomatoes- use the best san marzano you can find.

On a whim and out of curiosity I entered Olivada, as I'm about to make some this weekend -- yet there's no recipe given. Try mine, and delight. Can also be served on baguette with fresh marinated roasted peppers and roasted eggplant. Mince 2 cloves garlic, 8 large fresh basil leaves, and 1 tablespoon fresh thyme in a food processor until finely chopped. Add 1-1/2 cups or about 7 oz. drained black olives and 2 T fresh lemon juice and pulse, scraping down the sides of the work bowl several times to form a coarse paste. (For a coarse paste, add 3 T extra-virgin olive oil all at once until it is just incorporated; for a smooth paste, add the oil in a steady stream...) Enjoy...

I've used this recipe since it was first published in Gormet and it has always been a winner. It's easy to make and extremely tasty - every time I serve it to company it gets raves.

I add more garlic, minced basil or pesto, and a bit of tomato paste to make the tomato flavor more rich. this becomes more of a traditional bruschetta recipe- easy and good!
