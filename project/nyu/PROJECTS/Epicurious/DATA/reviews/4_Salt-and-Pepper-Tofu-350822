Definitely 4 forks! This recipe was very good. Flavorful. Perfect over plain rice or rice noodles. We loved it and will make it a staple.

I really enjoyed this recipe. As a note, you don't use all of the salt and pepper mix, just a bit to spice it up, then save the rest for you next recipie. From that perspective, I don't think there's too much salt in this recipe. I modified it a bit by taking a turkey sausage out of the casing, cooking it in a separate pan crumbled, then adding it in when I returned the tofu to the vegetables. I also used a jalapeno pepper as the other wasn't available in my market. The only mistake I think I made was that the oil wasn't hot enough in the wok when I first put in the tofu. I used a combo of canola and peanut oils, but 350 is hot, and I should have waited another couple minutes. Don't save the oil. It's part of the price of cooking this delicious meal.

I have found many good recipes here at epicurious. I've found some that were ok but not good enough to make again. This is one I wish I had never made. It was a waste of perfectly good ingredients. Enough salt to cause a stroke in a whale. I am not normally so negative that I would bother to make a review of something I didn't like, but I think this recipe really needs a bad review to counter the good reviews that are already here. Otherwise, one might get the impression that this really is a 4 fork exceptional meal.

I made this just as written and it was easy and delicious. The vegetarian dipping sauce which was the prefect accompaniment.

To the cook from Brooklyn: 1. Take a large (1 qt) pyrex measuring cup or bowl with a pour spout and put it in your kitchen sink. 2. Place a strainer in said measuring cup or bowl. 3. Carefully pour cooled oil into strainer 4. Remove strainer from measuring cup or bowl. 5. Pour oil into a lidded container for re-use Not so horrible when you think things through...

I made this without the chile and garlic and it was still very easy and tasty; my only complaint is that "saving the oil for later" is a horrifically messy task.

This was great! I added garlic and jalapeno to the seasoning mix and tossed tofu. Lightly fried until golden brown, and added scallions at the end. Yum!

I varied this recipe quite a bit so that I could use what I had and didn't have to go to the store. For example, I sliced a couple poblano peppers instead of the chile, and used shallots instead of scallions. It was simple and delicious. Terrific recipe for a scrumptious quick dinner.
