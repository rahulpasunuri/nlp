I made a few mistakes with this recipe. #1 I didn't have a flat-bottomed springiform pan, so I buttered a pan with a dimpled base and used parchment paper -- the cake stuck to the parchment and left scraps of paper that my guests had to pick off the crust. #2 I only own air-insulated cookie sheets, so when I placed the cake pan a cookie sheet to bake, it delayed baking time to almost 2 hours. Overall the cake was forgiving in that it still tasted good despite the caramelized crust from being baked longer than intended and the bits of parchment paper. The color is a brighter orange than the photo and the flavor is quite pumpkiny. Cracks in the cake top are forgiven by the sour cream topping. I will make this again, with a new cookie sheet & springiform.

This is a great recipe. It's a great combination of flavors and not overly sweet. AND.. for people like me who are not great bakers... it didn't take much fussing to get a very beautiful looking desert. I doubled the bourbon in the topping and might even add more the next time around.

I've been making this every chance I get for 4 years now. It's fantastic. Best of the pumpkin pie and cheesecake worlds combined. Personally, I love the original graham cracker and pecan crust because it's lightly toasty and not too sweet, which is a nice change from the usual over-sweetened crusts. I even go light on the sugar when making it to keep from overpowering the toasty pecan flavor. I also double the spices and add a dash of cloves (because I love cloves and think everything is better with them) to warm up the flavor. The pumpkin still shines through wonderfully. I DO have to cook it a little over an hour in my oven, otherwise the center is soupy. I'm not sure if it's my elevation or my oven, but about 65 minutes has consistently been the *perfect* time. And I add about 4 times the amount of bourbon in the topping....it's delicious!

This was delicious, although I did make some changes. I omitted the cinnamon entirely as I dont like that spice. (I know, I know; Im one of the 7 people in the world who hates cinnamon.) I doubled the other spices, and doubled&. er, maybe tripled the bourbon. I also used gingersnaps for the crust, per previous reviewer suggestions. The cheesecake ended up light and delicious. I made it for an office potluck and it was a hit. One problem I had was the crust ended up really stuck on the bottom of my pan. Any thoughts as to why?

I tried out this recipe during the pastry course at my culinary school when we were allowed to choose any flavor of cheesecake we desired. The flavor combination definitely sparked my interest because it had a nice little ring to it! With a few tweaks here and there, I am now known for this heavenly dessert every where I go! A few changes I made to the recipe are as follows: -- The Crust: Since this is somewhat a "fall" type of dessert I decided to swap gingersnaps for the standard graham cracker crust that is traditional with most cheesecakes. The overall flavor is much better and richer. Also, increase amount of butter going into the crust to prevent it from drying out. -- Intensity of the Bourbon, Honestly, the more you add, the more it will carry over into the finished product. Since alcohol evaporates in baking, you can choose the intensity by adding more than just 2 tablespoons. -- Incorporating the pumpkin mixture, cream cheese and sugar mixture and dry spice ingredients by using a high quality blender gives you a smooth velvety consistency and ensures no lumps from the cream cheese temperature. -- Picking the garnish: depending on the event I either add extra crumbles of gingersnaps and line the edge with pecans or I take an extra step by making my own caramel and dipping pecans into them to create an extra crunch to this dessert. Be creative!

Fantastic! Major recommendation. This dessert drew raves. I was also especially pleased with the results myself, and I'm a veteran of making cheesecakes. Very well balanced and light -- not overly sweet. The sour cream topping was a very nice contrast to the sweeter filling. Perhaps the absence of too much sweetness is due to the unflavored pumpkin (see below). Made with puree of freshly roasted pumpkin but otherwise followed recipe precisely, extending the cooking time to 60' due to concerns about the moisture content the pumpkin puree. Like another reviewer, I noticed that the center was slightly wet when slicing in the kitchen (literally, there was a tiny bit of water at the bottom of the pan). But the slices plated nicely, and the consistency seemed perfect at the table. Enjoy! Dave

I too made this for Thanksgiving this year, but with a few alterations similar to many other reviewers. I halved the graham crackers in the crust and used ginger snaps as the replacement. I also used quite a bit more bourbon (I actually used Jack Daniel's whiskey instead). I'm trying spiced rum in the next one! Also, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream as the topping. It ended up being a little bit soggy in the middle (which was probably due to me getting happy with the whiskey), but it was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. I will just increase the cooking time by just a few minutes to compensate for the extra liquor next time. Definitely making this again! I already have demands to make three more for Christmas!

Can I rate this five stars? This was my first cheesecake ever and it was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year. One sister claimed it was the best dessert *EVER*. Another sister ate her husband's serving as well as her own. My son was scraping the remains on the serving plate before putting it in the dishwasher. When I asked if it should be the traditional Thanksgiving dessert from now on, my nephew exclaimed, "Thanksgiving AND Christmas!" It may be time consuming, but not difficult... and oh so worth the results. Only alterations... gingersnaps in lieu of graham crackers, rum in lieu of bourbon, and I sprinkled pecan praline on top before serving.

I doubled the spices and bourbon in the cheesecake filling, used caramel Bailey's instead of cream, and used ginger snaps in the crust. I would make it again with all those same modifications. The only thing I'm not sure I liked was how the sour cream topping tasted. I was confused firstly that the recipe called for "2 cups (20 ounces)." Wouldn't 2 cups = 16 ounces? Then after I put double the bourbon in the topping, I was afraid it would be too strong so I added a little extra sugar. It came out a bit tangy and I think the sour cream overpowered the other flavors in the filling a bit. Next time I will add some vanilla to soften the taste of the sour cream. Also, I think my filling needed to bake a tad longer than 60 minutes, even though it seemed set. It was still a fun recipe to make and eat. :)

This cheesecake blew the socks off of all of my guests at Thanksgiving! I did what some others suggested, which was to use ginger snaps for the crust as opposed to graham crackers. I'll be making this awesome cheesecake a LOT more!

I made this for a work cook-off and won. Very, very good and easy to make. They aren't kidding when they say put a baking pan under the springform - the whole thing was almost ruined due to butter leaking on the bottom of oven and flooding my apartment with toxic fumes in between the finished cheesecake and sour cream stages. I ended up baking the sour cream layer in my toaster oven. So take the advice even if you think your springform won't leak!

This has been a hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas for years. Based on reviews here, I made the following modifications, which I highly recommend: ►Double the spices (cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg) ►Double bourbon (I think Ill triple it next time) ►Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for the crust ►Secret Ingredient: Vanilla Caramel coffee creamer instead of heavy cream. I forgot to buy cream so I used what I had and will likely do it again ►Always takes 60 minutes to cook in my oven. Center should still be a little jiggly ►When cooling, let it sit covered in a cool place (garage works well) overnight. If it cools too fast the topping will crack.

Even a little too much spice tends to overpower the pumpkin.

Beautiful and delicious cheesecake. For the crust, I toasted the pecans, used French salted butter, and skipped the brown sugar (I used 1/4 cup sugar in the raw only). It makes a perfect crust just sweet enough. I did not make the sour cream topping but served the cake with fresh whipped cream.

This is truly a delicious pumpkin cheesecake. I made the crust with a third graham/third snaps/third toasted, crushed pecans... and I used only the brown sugar (that was plenty sweet). For the filling, I tripled the spices and the bourbon and added a touch more pumpkin. Scrumptious! I did use the sour cream topping with extra bourbon, and enjoyed it as a contrast to the sweet pumpkin filling. In addition, I topped the cake with caramelized pecans (crumbled praline). This provided a nice sandwiching of the creamy layers with nut layers. This cheesecake is definitely worth making!

This was good, but I think the pumpkin cheesecake from Rosie's "All Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar Packed Baking Book" is better. The crust was kind of blah (I prefer one made with gingersnaps) and the cream cheese filling was good but not the deep, rich creaminess I love in a cheesecake. I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the spices and the bourbon, but I would say triple the bourbon. The flavor was very good, and it looked just gorgeous when plated.

I started making this two years ago and it's now a staple- everyone loves it. It's rich and creamy and just a little different from a cheesecake. The graham cracker crust is delicious. But one hint for the cheesecake- MAKE SURE to use paper towels on the pumpkin to soak up as much moisture as you can or the cheesecake will be soggy.

I've been making this wonderful cheesecake every year since it appeared on the cover of your magazine in 1990.

I can't remember if I've rated this one before. I have been making it since it was first published in 1990. I am requested to make it every year. This recipe is perfect as is. I recommend that you make this at least 24 hours before serving so that the flavors have time to meld together and the cheesecake sets firmly. Any sooner than that and you will serve mush. I break this recipe up into sections. A few days earlier I grind the nuts. On another day I make the crust and refrigerate it. On another day I make the cheesecake and 24 hours before I make the topping and decorate it. This way you aren't killing yourself all in one day.

It was delicious, rich but very smooth and creamy. It did take a bit longer to cook in my oven, but it was well worth the wait. I would definately recommend this after a extended family dinner, as there is quite a bit left, which is good because they will all want secods later.

I just made this for a potluck my friends have every thursday. People told me it was the best dessert I've ever brought. I might try and double the spices like the other reviews have suggested.

I like the sour cream topping! Mainly because it really dresses this up. I used crumbled toasted pecans both in the crust and sprinkled on top. Also used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers and increased the spices. But the most important change was to follow the advice of a reviewer to bake this in a water bath. It took about an hour and 20 minutes (I checked by jiggling the pan until the center seemed almost set), and the consistency was perfect. Highly recommend that method. I made 3 of these around Thanksgiving for different gatherings, and everyone raved.

I make a lot of cheesecakes, and this one was a definate winner. I took other readers advice and added more of the spices. I'm glad I did. It had a great pumpkin flavor. I wasn't that crazy for the sour cream topping, I thought it was too distracting from the pumpkin part. It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't what I wanted. I'll leave it off next time. This got some great reviews from my guests at Thanksgiving.

Thank you to everyone! You all gave me some good ideas. I added more nuts to the crust. I didn't cook the crust. However, I did keep it in the fridge for 2 hours instead of an hour, double the spices and the bourbon. If I didn't double spices the dish would have been very bland. I didn't make the sour cream topping. Instead I drizzled with caramel and topped with minced pecans, made my own whipped cream with real maple syrup. Everyone loved it!

WONDERFUL.

People snarfed it up; I barely got to have some myself. Useful ideas from the CI version: bake the crust (including some butter) - YUM. Cook in a water bath (standard cheesecake trick to avoid overcooking edges or undercooking center). To keep it from being soupy, which some here mentioned: press the pumpkin between paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible before combining. Amazingly good! So good, after making it (as my first baking project ever!), I went right out and bought my own mixer.

To me, this is not cheesecake, it's more like a pumpkin mousse. The flavor was very nice, but I must admit I like a more traditional cheesecake and this wasn't it.

Great cheesecake. Satisfies lovers of cheesecake and pumpkin pie at the same time. Great for thanksgiving or Christmas. Can't really tast the bourbon. I doubled it.

Wow, I don't usually disagree with this many reviews, but this was not our favorite cheesecake. Personally I prefer a little denser cheesecake, and even after sitting in the fridge for a few days was still too fluffy for my taste. If I were to make again I would probably add more sugar, more bourbon, and bake the crust (I actually did for 10 minutes and it still was soggy). I might skip the sour cream topping, too -- if you bake in a water bath you can avoid cracks.

(Day after Christmas) Delicious! I read the reviews, & was a little concerned about it being too sweet. But b/c 96% said they would make it again, I decided to make the recipe EXACTLY as stated. A bourbon taste was not even evident, the sweetness was perfect, and the solid-pack pumpkin did not ooze. We all loved it as the Christmas dinner finale, served with Tawney Port. DON'T CHANGE A THING! (Five days after Christmas, and 7 days after making.) MY CRUST TURNED MOLDY!!! GROSS! Be careful about that. That's never happened to me. And I think Houston is making fun of the people who added Chipotle and substituted guava for pumpkin and changed the bourbon to something else... (it's not the same recipe at all)

Against my better judgment, I did as the recipe directed and brought the cake to room temperature before serving (I like my cheesecake cold). Big mistake! The cheesecake is much better served chilled. I served it at my Christmas Eve party at room temp and not many people ate it and I didn't think it was too oustanding, but after rechilling and taking "test bites" straight out of the fridge, the cake was to die for! I wish I could rewind to Christmas Eve, go with my instincts, and reserve this great cake. Followed the recipe to the letter. Yum!

This recipe is fabulous with a few alterations as suggested. Houston, the Bourbon was for the cheesecake. Might want to try making the recipe, taste testing, giving it a rating, THEN drinking the Bourbon. =)

I made 2 of these for Christmas, and each was completely devoured. I am not known for my culinary skills, and many relatives did not believe I actually made this myself. The only drawback was a soggy crust. I will definitely bake the crust for 10 min. next time. I sprinkled my extra crushed pecans on top- looked very pretty with the whole pecans around the perimeter.

I don't know WHAT recipe Houston is reviewing, but it sure isn't this one. I read ALL the reviews before making this for Christmas Day. I doubled the spices and increased the sugar in both the cake and the topping and used shaved white chocolate for decoration which turned out to be a good thing, because I did not bake the cake long enough before adding the topping. It didn't seem to hurt anything by cooking it longer with the topping, but it did crack and the chocolate covered the boo-boos. I reserved one fork because the crust was soggy. I should have paid attention to the person who suggested baking the crust for 10 minutes first. People absolutely RAVED about this cheesecake. But, it would not have been as good without all your help in altering the recipe. Thanks everyone!

This is an easy and outstanding cheesecake. I, too, was told I could sell it. I doubled the crust, keeping some to sprinkle over the top, I omitted the sour cream topping, doubled all the spices and used a combination of chopped pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds in place of all-pecans in the crust. Simply fabulous.

Does anyone besides me think that the Houston review is NOT for this recipe? Either that, or I made the completely wrong dish : ) Anyway, an excellent and easy cheesecake. Definitely try this one.

I loved this recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was devoured instantly. After reading all the reviews, I added more sugar, a bit more bourbon, gingersnap cookies instead of graham crackers, and doubled the crust. I skipped the sour cream topping as I do not like sour cream toppings on cheesecakes. The cake did not need a topping. For Christmas I made the vanilla bean cheesecake on this site instead of this one. Everyone who had both cakes was disappointed that I did not make this cake and so was I.

I served this for Christmas dinner to our guests from Mexico City. I blended one 8 ounce can of Chipolte (found in Mexican Markets) to the canned pumpkins and replaced the Bourbon with Tequila. What a hit! A bit spicy, but it is now a new family favorite Ole!

It took much longer to cook than stated because of the liquid in the pumpkin. Next time I will press the pumpkin between some paper towels. We had a German guest with us for Thanksgiving and he loves cheesecake. He thought this one was the best he ever had. I thought so too.

This was great. I made it for my office Xmas party and there wasn't any left However, I made a few changes. I used all pecans 2 cups for the crust and in lieu of the granulated sugar I used splenda, you couldn't tell the difference. I didn't have any burbon, so I used brandy instead. I baked the crust for ten minutes and then put in the freezer for the hour. I had no problem with oozing.

In the last two weeks I have made this recipe about three times. I took one of the cheesecakes to the office and it was gone in a few minutes. Everyone loved it! I also made a variation of the recipe. I used a guava mixture instead of the pumpkin to give it a tropical twist and the result was delicious!

Rating: 1
A big disappointment. To each his own, but I'm shocked this recipe received so much fanfare. I made it for a Christmas party and, although it looked very impressive, it tasted "blah." The bourbon takes away from rather than enhances the pumpkin-flavor, and the cheesecake batter needs a lot more spice. The sour cream topping just didn't belong there; the bourbon-spiked sourness on top of what was already a dull cheesecake didn't help matters. As for the components of the crust, they're terrific, but when you're dealing with an unbaked crust the butter tends to ooze when the dessert is brought to room temperature, which it did. So for me this was a recipe with a lot of promise that just didn't deliver. : (

I have made this dessert for Thanksgiving for the second year in a row. My family absolutely loves it! Everyone claims it is one of the best cheesecakes they have eaten. I added shaved white chocolate to the top of the cake in place of the pecans. Then I lightly sprinkled freshly grated nutmeg for some bits of color. I think it really makes for a better presentation!

I echo the previous review....OH MY GOD! My first cheesecake as well and it was fantastic. Easy to make, everyone loved it. I will probably do this for Christmas. Are cheesecakes all this easy? If so, why have I waited so long. Oh, by the way, I did not have any bourbon so I used brandy. Seemed to work fine.

OH MY GOD. I made this last year and will absolutely be making it again. I swear I had to put a lock on the fridge so my dad would stop eating it when I wasn't looking! I think what I liked so much about this (in addition to the flavor) was the simplicity. This was my first cheesecake and it turned out absolutely fantastic.

Rating: 4
I gave this 4 forks mainly because everyone who tried this raved about it at Thanksgiving. I liked it, but expected to be blown away after reading all the reviews before mine. The consistency was great, it looked great, the flavor was delicate but nice. But the crust was sweeter than the cheesecake. I'd make it again because it was such a hit, but I might increase the sugar in the filling by 1/4 - 1/3. As is, the filling was almost savory. OK if that's how it's billed, but a little extra sugar could really make the difference. What's funny is I'm usually the one suggesting to reduce sugar in desserts! Go figure.........

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic dessert! Not only does it look beautiful, but it tastes even better. I made it for a dinner party for 12 and it was the perfect amount...even with a couple people going back for seconds. The crust was a huge hit. Will definitely make it again. PS Buy a sample bottle of bourbon. No one in our house drinks bourbon so the tiny bottle was perfect. I used Maker's Mark and it tasted great.

Rating: 4
This was my first cheesecake (other than the no-bake variety), as I do not consider myself a baker. The recipe could not have been easier, and I added a little extra sugar to the topping as someone else suggested. It was delicious, visually impressive, and has kept much longer in the fridge than stated. I was worried, as I think my oven is small and it took closer to two hours thank one hour to finally set! But I took it out the moment the center set and it was great. Next time, I'd add a bit more spice, and I noted the topping "cooked down" so you can pile it on before you bake the topping.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I made this for a party this weekend and had rave reviews. I didn't have a springform pan so I used a 9x13 cake pan. I had to change the crust a bit to fit the pan. I used 3 cups of crushed gingersnaps and 1 1/2 stick of butter. I eliminated the granulated sugar and then followed the rest of the recipe as written. I baked it for 60 minutes and it turned out beautifully! I might double the topping next time to make a thicker layer but that would be a personal choice. Thanks!

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU HAVE AN INCORRECT EMAIL ADDRESS FOR ME. IT IS sodiseos@msn.com, NOT sodiseos@trigen.com. CAN YOU PLEASE CORRECT?! This is a world class recipe. For the last five years I have received family requests to make this delicious variation on cheesecake. They love it. They hope there will be leftovers, because it is great for several days. I use cognac instead of bourbon, which is delish. I appreciate the suggestion from the Norway contributor to reduce likelihood of leaking, which has been a problem I thought related to the springform pan. Next time I will try to make sure crust is packed well and thick enough where the bottom meets the side of the pan and, of course, make sure it is chilled long enough.

It seems every Thanksgiving, I try another pumpkin cheesecake recipe. I've made at least 5. This is by far the best. I loved the crust and the middle and the sour cream topping. I received many compliments and no one missed the traditional pumpkin pie. I didn't have bourbon and a friend told me that Jack Daniel's would have a similar flavor. I used that and it was excellent.

Rating: 3
this is a super recipe. Perhaps my springform is larger than specified, mine only required the minimum amount of baking time. Generally my family does not want me to bake anything, just stick to cooking, but this turned out great. I am intimidated by baking recipes. However, after I watched my sis make the pumpkin pie and I made the cheesecake, I realized it is just pummpkin pie filling folded into whipped cream cheese. When you look at it that way it is not intimidating at all. I did skip the sour cream topping, it just didn't sound like my family's type of thing. I will certainly make this again.

This is a fabulous cheesecake that I have made 5 years running! I'm not very big on pumpkin pie, and this fits the bill just perfectly. For the previous reviewer re: holiday reviews.

Anybody else notice that almost all 30 of the "Constant Comment" recipes belong on a Thanksgiving table?

Rating: 4
Nothing savory about this!! What a fantastic innovative change to the same old same old pumpkin pie. I wouldn't go so far to say it is easy to make, it does take some assembly time as the crust must chill for at least an hour before you fill it. I can't get pecans in Norway so I substituted walnuts, still fantastic. I also doubled the spices and cooked it for 90 minutes as I have a regular conventional oven and the center didn't seem to be setting well. This pie was fantastically delicious and spectacular to look at. To prevent leaking, make sure the crust is thoroughly chilled before filling. Also, the pie does rise a bit when cooking. Before you do the last step (sour cream topping) let it sit out for a few minutes and, using a spatula, try and press down just a bit over the top to compress it to make room, if it rises too much. Will definately make this again.

Rating: 3
I didn't much care for it, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but my overall opinion was this cheese cake was stuck between a dessert and a savory dish. However, every one else that tried it said it was a "TEN", based on that, I will definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe - easy, delicious, impressive, popular with the Thanksgiving crowd! It is also relatively foolproof - I made it half-asleep on Thanksgiving Eve at about 10:30pm. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, nor pumpkin pie, but together...yum yum!

Absolutely perfect. Served it on Thanksgiving. Chef/caterer friend(with very discriminating taste) loved it as did everyone else.Recieved rave reviews including, "It is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten."

Have made this 2 times since running across the recipe. WOW! It's wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly. The 1st time I only baked the cake 50 minutes and it was a little too loose in the very center. The 2nd time I baked it for 60 minutes and the center was nice and firm. This cake is a wonderful substitute for pumpkin pie. Everyone thought the cake had been purchased from a bakery. Only 1 suggestion....instead of decorating the top with whole pecans use ground pecans. This makes the slicing process much easier and the cake is still BEAUTIFUL.

Everyone raved about this. I thought I had not cooked it quite enough (maybe needed 5 more minutes) but it still set up well and everyone loved the creaminess. just thought I would add that Cook's Illustrated did a similar version of this recipe in its Nov/Dec 2003 issue. one suggestion was to dry out the pumpkin by pressing it between layers of paper towel on a cookie sheet. it really makes a difference. Also, the crust on this was good, but I think it is better to just put it at the bottom, not up the sides as well. It looks better for presentation, too. And another change that CI had was in the topping - theirs was a bourbon flavored whipped cream (with a little sour cream too) served alongside. Much better I think. Also, baking in a water bath really improves the consistency and evenness of the cake. How can cheesecake be bad, really?

A huge hit! Everyone loved it and I plan to make it again for Christmas. One note - you may want to almost double the crust recipe, as I ran out of crust after just covering the sides of the springform.

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in the magazine in 1990 and have gotten raves each and every time. The only adjustment I make is to add extra spices (those suggested as well as anything handy that works with the flavors) - I find that these add to the depth of flavor and the lesser amounts get lost in all of the cream cheese.

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks for holiday parties. Each time everyone loved it. LIked it better than traditional pumpkin pie. Thought it would be very rich but it has a light flavor. Don't think it really matters what liquor you use. Used Crown Royal once and Southern Comfort once. The pecans in the crust make it great. Tried it once without nuts because of an person with a nut allergy and it wasn't quite as good. Helpful hint: I learned to drain the pumpkin on several paper towels before mixing. It gets the excess liquid out and gives the cheesecake a better consistency.

I've made this recipe twice in the past 2 months and it's gotten rave reviews both times. I did make a couple of modification though. I used 1-1/4 cups of Sweetzels Spiced Wafers for the crust instead of the graham crackers and pecans. I also added extra sugar in the sour cream topping. It tasted too "sharp" without it for my taste. I actually cook it less than the 50-60 minutes (usually around 43-45) because I prefer to let it set in the refrigerator. Oh, one nice thing about the sour cream topping - if your cake does crack, no one will be the wiser!

I haven't tried this yet, but my sister did and took to her in-laws' for Thanksgiving. It was a big hit - hope I can talk her into bringing one when she visits here over New Years. I just wanted to offer a comment to the cook from Alamogordo about using a 9" glass pie dish instead of a springform pan -- DON'T!!! Among other things, the dish will probably be too shallow to hold all the filling. Plus, translating baking temperatures/times to the slower-heating glass pan can be problematic. Go ahead and buy a good springform pan, you'll have a good excuse to make cheesecake from now on.

Cheesecake baking is a chemistry experiment. You must never beat the ingredients with the mixer set on high because you do not want to add air to the cheesecake mixture. If you add air, you are asking for a cheesecake with a fallen middle. It needs to be baked in a slow oven with a pan of water. I have never had a springform leak but my crust (macaroons make dandy crusts) goes up the side of the pan, not just the bottom. I have also formed a foil collar at times when I thought my filling my overflow the pan as you would do for a souffle. You must let the cheesecake cool without opening the door and creating a sudden change in temperature--you are asking for fissures if you do. Cracks in the cheesecake are not the end of the world but they can be prevented. Freeze cheesecakes after they have cooled down and you will always have a wonderful dessert with just a little notice--they thaw in the fridge. I make a ligonberry sauce for my New York cheesecake that is to die for. My personal favorite has always been pumpkin cheesecake. Good experimenting in your kitchens!

Rating: 3
Delicious! After reading 30 pages of reviews (!)I took suggestions to double the crust (but not the butter in it). It was enough to go up the sides and it did not leak out the springform. In the filling I doubled the spices and vanilla, used low fat cream cheese with no loss of flavor. For the topping I doubled the sugar and chopped the pecans to sprinkle over - looked and tasted great. I included a pan of boiling water in the oven and had no cracking. I added 10 minutes to the cooking time (total 65) and let it sit in the off oven for an additional hour. It was still far too soft in the center so next time I would add at least 20 minutes more of cooking time even going for a full hour and a half to get a good sliceable consistency. As it was, it was good 2 inches from the edge but collapsed in the middle when sliced - consistency of pudding. Delicious all the same but not satisfactory. (BTW: Our oven is new and keeps the temp. accurately) They may have listed a smaller springform than they intended? 9" is a lovely height but needs more baking time!

Like so many others, I've made this cake several times and have witnessed it convert guests who "really don't like pumpkin pies". I find that cooling the cake slowly, on a rack in a microwave oven with the door ajar, virtually eliminates any fissures. The Cook from New York is correct, the photo from the magazine is a much better tribute to this amazing dessert.

Very nice. Rich, yet airy. Easy, yet very impressive. This recipe works just fine as it is written. The filling is creamy and very flavorful. The bourbon is barely noticable; if anything I might even add more (maybe 2 tablespoons next time). The crust tastes great; no, you don't need to double it. It is just the right amount, and yes, it does leak during baking. Most crusts in springform pans do. Just put a cookie sheet beneath and avoid any mess. Enjoy this one.

This was a great recipe! Anyone scared of the bourbon being too much can relax, it isn't at all overpowering. It was the mystery ingrediant, that I didn't reveal until my guests were well into it. (As I feared they may be leary knowing beforehand.) I somehow forgot to add the vanilla, but it was still amazing. I also had issues w/ too much topping and some of it running over. Was glad I had cookie sheet under it. I remeasured my pan, and it was the right size. Maybe I let it whip up more than I should have.

I've never heard of 'graham crackers' and we can't get canned pumpkin in the UK. We can still get fresh at the moment so I'm going to try that, and I'm sure any nutty biscuit base will do. Pumpkin is so delicious and yet rather under-used in the UK so I'm campaigning to get people to EAT MORE !! By the way, how necessary is the bourbon? I imagine it would rather overpower the gorgeous flavours already there....and of course it would put the children off!

I like a fluffier cheesecake but with all the richness of a typical NY cheesecake. I used a 10 inch pan, doubled the crust, and used only the egg yolks with the pumpkin in the early step. As a final step, I beat the 3 egg whites until stiff and folded into the cream cheese-pumkin mixture. Had planned on multiplying the topping by 1.5, but the cake rose above the top of the pan. MMMMMMMMmmmmm. Rave reviews. Also decorated with pecan halves while the topping was warm.

Overall not too bad, although several improvements needed in my opinion. Both the topping and the cake need more sugar, especially the topping (I doubled the sugar, at the very least to get the flavor I wanted). Next time I am going to increase the sugar in the cheesecake itself by 1/4 cup. Additionally I would increase the nutmeg and ginger to 3/4 tsp, and I might also add some allspice to the recipe. The crust had a bit too much of a pecan flavor for my taste, so next time I may cut back on the pecans and add more graham crackers.

Very good. Did many of the suggestions, except I didn't need to double the crust. I made double the crust and ended up using only half of it. I did switch around the order of the ingredients, so I made the cheesecake part first, poured some of it on top of the crust and then put in the pumpkin with the rest of the filling and poured that on top. I accidentally used Libby's pumpkin pie filling instead of plain packed pumpkin and it was awesome! Definitely increase the amount of sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg.
