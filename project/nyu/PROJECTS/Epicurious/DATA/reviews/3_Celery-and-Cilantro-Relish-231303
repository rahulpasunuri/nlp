Very good. Easy, simple, tasty. Nice side dish for sandwiches in the summer.

Fairly unnecessary accompaniment to the beet and carrot latkes - the apple/green onion/jalapeno salsa pretty much overpowered it. I might serve it with lox (smoked salmon) in place of capers, but that's about it.

I used Walnut oil instead of regular oil and added some finely chopped onion. It needed some salt and pepper, too. It is a wonderful way to use up extra celery ribs when you buy an entire stalk and only need one or two for a recipe. Without Walnut oil, I would have added some finely chopped walnuts.
