Should have read all the reviews first (I usually always do but for some reason didn't this time) and found the lemon too strong, but not so strong that it was not good. I also felt that the use of vanilla beans instead of lemon would result in a much nicer flavor. Will absolutely make this again, but with out any of the lemon.

Rating: 4
This was a perfect recipe! I took into account other readers' remarks about the lemon being too strong, so I macerated the strawberries in my homemade limoncello for a bit before pulsing in the food processor to make small chunks. The mellow, lemony flavor is subtle and doesn't overpower the fresh strawberry taste. Aaaahhhh, homemade ice cream! Heaven.

This recipe is great as it is, although I skip the lemon entirely in favor of a vanilla bean.

I liked this, but will omit the lemon, and use vanilla next time. Otherwise, replace half of the heavy cream with either light cream, or half-and-half. It will still be plenty rich, and you won't get that icky butterfat film on your spoon or in your mouth. It is worth noting that premium ice creams get their creamy mouth feel from the addition of corn syrup and chemical stabilizers. If you do a taste test with this and a commerical ice cream, the one you bought-- even Haagen-Dazs-- will have a fake undertone to it compared to what you made.

I used a combination of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries and ended up with a super creamy, berry delicious ice cream. The texture was amazingly light....just as you would expect with ALL of that cream! I served it along side a berry upside down cake and I would say my family was all "berry" happy!

Wow, this is one creamy ice cream. I usually think homemade ice cream is too "icy", and not creamy enough, but not so with this recipe. There is a distinct lemony taste, which my husband and I liked, but my kids did not. They preferred the Perfect No-Cook Strawberry Ice Cream recipe on this site, which tastes like nothin' but strawberry. This one was the grown-ups hands down favorite, though. I used half heavy cream and half whipping cream, because that's what I had on hand, and it was fabulous. Next time I'll try using all whipping cream just to lighten the calorie load since I know I'll be eating so much of this stuff. Yum!!! Keeps well, too.

Great ice cream recipe! Loved the strawberry and lemon combination. Ice cream was very scoopable coming out of the freezer unlike most home-made ice creams.

this was a great recipe. like many reviewers, i found the lemon taste to be too strong as written. i ended up adding another 4 oz of strawberries, though, and that made for a nice balance. next time, i would do about 3/4 the lemon juice.

Based off of a little research and polling, I decided to use 75% cream and 25% milk. The main reason for this was that most said too much cream=greasy, or basically way too fatty, ice cream. I made this for a large gathering so I quadrupled the recipe and used it as a base for chocolate, raspberry and fresh strawberry ice creams. My only really major variation was the omit the lemon juice. The custard smelled lemon-y enough just after the zest (which I did not take out, by the way--it was grated fine enough). Reviews from the gathering: Everyone thought it tasted fantastic. People who said they didn't like strawberry ice cream thought the lemon made it a new favorite for them. Oh, and for the chocolate ice cream, a note: I went ahead and did everything the same except added unsweetened cocoa powder to the chilled custard. Because it was cold at that point, I had to warm it up a bit before it would mix. Next time, I'll add the cocoa powder before the custard chills.

This was delicious. I did not find the lemon overpowering, perhaps because my strawberries were very very ripe. I also mashed the berries so there would be pieces throughout the ice cream. Will definitely make this again.

I have to say, I was a bit reluctant, after reading some of the reviews. Only after the custard was finished, was I reminded how far we have strayed from the "real" into the low-fat and artificial. This is a traditional french custard--absolutely smooth with no aftertaste except for the delicate egg. I do suggest paying absolute attention to the cooking. Ideally a double boiler would be best, but I allowed cream to foam up, and immediately removed from heat. Wisk eggs and sugar, and then add the hot milk to it, little by little, continuing to wisk. Once mostly incorporated, I pour the whole liquid back into the pot, after inspecting pot for no scalding marks. Continue to wisk until slightly thickened so that the liquid leaves a film on the back of a spoon. Then you know its ready to remove from heat. Add buttered parchment paper, so that no film forms while cooling. The texture is velvety and requires no straining. Simple, fresh ingredients, and very versatile. would give up store bought ice-cream for the oh so occasional taste of the real thing. I highly recommend!

This recipe is so bad that I do not have the words to describe it. I would make so many adjustments to the recipe that it would not even be the same recipe anymore--if I were to try to make it again. I would say to find a good base and start out from there.

Okay, I made this ice cream again but with cherries. I pureed all of the cherries and strained them. Added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and small chopped semi-sweet chocolate. Good again.

This is very nice, however I made some modifications... I used a mixture of cream and half and half, and I set the berries aside ahead of time with some vanilla congac (NAVAN- but grand marnier, vodka etc would work), sugar and lemon juice and let them macerate. I used a masher instead of pureeing it as I did want some chunks in my ice cream (personal preference!). I added some vanilla to the base to give it some extra flavor. the only thing I would change is to omit the lemon juice with the strawberries. The zest is great because it slightly perfumes the base, but when the whole thing was churned and done, the lemon flavor was quite pronounced (and I am someone who LOVES lemon). The lemon may work on its own, but it took a little something away from the strawberries. Overall though, a really nice solid recipe.

Rating: 3
I substituted some of the heavy cream with some 2% milk to avoid a greasy feel. Also, I didn't run the strawberries through a sieve because I think they add a nice texture (unlike blackberry seeds). And I would probably cut the lemon juice in half next time. I like the essence of lemon, but I had fresh strawberries and they were a little bit overpowered by the lemon.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this ice cream. I added grated lemon zest, left it in and didn't add the juice. I also mashed the berries. I left about a quarter of the pieces aside, macerated them with a teaspon of Cointreau and added them with about 2 minutes left.

For this recipe, having seen the reviews of others, I comprimised and used coffee cream (18%M.F.) The heavy or whipping cream in my area is 35% M.F., and Half & Half is 10%. It was creamy but not too heavy, I think it would have been a shade too light if I had used Half & Half. I also mashed the strawberries rather than blending them, whick gave it a great texture when it was done, but it was quite the pain when manually churning. This is much better than any store bought strawberry ice cream I've ever had. The custard would make a great base for any other fruit subsitutes, such as blueberry or raspberry. Actually, I agree with another review: you could double the cream ingredients and just make it lemon!

This ice cream was divine. I did not use the lemon juice, merely the zest, and used partially thawed berries I had picked myself and froze. I'll use this as a base for all my future ice cream adventures.

VERY good! and I only had 1/2 and 1/2 still came out rich and creamy tasting. What you mainly notice is the fresh strawberry taste. I too used balsamic vinegar, a dash of vodka, and kept all lemon additions, which I thought only enhanced the taste.

Delicious. Made it exactly as written with fresh local berries, plus 1T of vodka. Great taste and texture.

Absolutely perfect! I really LOVED this ice cream. It had a strong strawberry flavor, even though the berries themselves didn't seem that flavorful. It was a bit firm, but I like that in ice cream. It also struck me as a basic recipe you could use with peaches, raspberries or even blackberries. And I was also thinking of adding whole berries before freezing so there'd be some frozen chunks of fruit in it as well. Definitely going to make this all Summer.

This is a fantastic basic ice cream recipe -- worked great with blueberries... It's very rich, but not to excess. Not, unlike some of the nine-yolk recipes, too eggy. Really, all-around just right.

I have used this recipe several times as a base for other flavors. My husband loves it, so I won't try any other recipe.

The fresh strawberries make all the difference - best strawberry ice cream we've ever had! Made it twice, once with all cream and once substituting half w/milk - both were excellent (depends whether you want lighter and more refrshing or richer and more decadent). Otherwise, followed the recipe as stated. Still great the next day, but definitely best right out of the machine.

I used a one pound bag of frozen strawberries. Added 2 tablespoons corn syrup and 2 tablespoons chambord. I did not strain the fruit puree. I usually do not have to strain my egg yolk custards, but the whole egg custard did require straining. I'm wondering if whole egg custards boil at a lower temperature than yolk only custards. Next time I may make it with egg yolks only.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and the taste was delicious but the texture isn't so great... Dense and not creamy enough. But that's probably my ice cream maker. I can imagine this would be great in ice cream sandwiches.

This was my first attempt at making homemade ice cream. It was very delicious and a lot easier than I thought it would be. I took the recommendation of others and did not strain the strawberries,instead I mashed the strawberries with a potato masher. It did a great job because I ended up with chunks as well as puree. In the future I think it would be a good idea to make the the custard and mashed strawberries the day before and combining ingredients a few hours before dinner for a tasty make ahead dessert.

Made this exactly as instructed, and cooled in an ice water bath before pouring into ice cream maker. My husband and I concur that all the heavy cream put this one on the greasy side, coating your mouth and spoon. Next time I'll swap out about half of the heavy cream for skim milk. Still, I'm very pleased with this one. You'll find it similar to those pricey little pints in your grocer's freezer, but better because the strawberry flavor is so fresh. If you enjoy rich, custardy ice creams, I definitely recommend this recipe.

They are right, don't let the simple name fool you. Wow! I let the strawberries sit for an hour or so in the splenda (lo-carber here) and a splash of balsamic vinegar as suggested. I didn't cook the egg and cream mixture since I was pressed for time and it's worked in the past. I chopped the berries and left some nice chunks and froze it. Again... WOW. The freshest flavors I've ever had. So long store bought.

Used what I had in the fridge (mix of heavy cream, whipping cream & skimmed milk!) and it turned out very well. Also let strawbs sit for a while in sugar and 1 tspn balsamic. Made it yest and it's now rock solid, but will transfer to fridge 2 hrs before serving. Would definitely make it again!

excellent flavor--especially right out of the ice cream maker when it's still soft. froze very hard, so was difficult to scoop after freezing.

Rich and delicious. I left some strawberries in chunks for texture. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to the custard. Regarding the reviewer who had an icy result, finely chopped ice outside the ice cream maker is necessary for a smooth ice cream. The finer the ice used with the machine the better the texture of the product. There's a good explaination but I don't remember the science of it. Ben and Jerry discuss it in their book.

This was my first try at making ice cream in a new maker. I loved all the compnents before they were combined and was so excited to get itout of the freezer. However, the texture wasn't very creamy and there was a lot of ice in it. Im not too willing to put alcohol in it as other reviews suggested. Anyone have an idea of where I might have gone wrong?

Agreed--this recipe is so fresh-tasting, so fabulous...I never buy commerical strawberry ice cream because it can't live up to this. I agree that the zest and seed straining are optional, but I feel the zest brightens up the puree and is quite good. Get a microplane zester and it's really no work at all to get great zest in seconds.

DUDE!!! This is the undisputed ice-cream ruler of the universe. And despite the complaints of a few whiners, easy, too. No need to heat the cream (thanks, Cook's Illustrated!), and the zest and the strain-out-the seeds parts are both optional, too. Try this recipe and leave Haagen-Dazs behind FOREVER.

This recipe was time consuming, but turned out great. A friend who "doesn't like strawberry ice cream" commented that it really tasted like ripe strawberries and not at all artificial. I allowed the berry puree to sit overnight in the fridge while the cream was cooling)and added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. I'll make it again when I have time for the puree which requires dirtying quite a few dishes!

This recipe produces a velvety textured ice cream--very sophisticated. We ate it all right after it came out of the ice cream maker, so I don't know how hard it can freeze, but it is very silky right out of the ice cream maker. People who like to see the fruit in their fruit ice creams may not like this, because the fruit puree blends in completely with the custard.

Adding some alcohol does help it from freezing too hard which is common in homemade ice creams. Try adding about 1/4 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream to your Vanilla Ice Cream!! Wonderful!!

I followed the advice of a past reviewer and used 2 tbsps of vodka in the berries then I let the berries sit for several hours. I use way less salt too. The ice cream was too ice grainy for my liking, not creamy at all. I will try again and use less vodka but I thought by using more it would be really creamy but I got the opposite. Great flavour through

I made this without an ice-cream maker, by just freezing the mixture and stirring every so often, until the consistency was thick enough. This was the first time I've made ice cream that was more complicated than just cream, sugar, and vanilla. It was totally worth it. The flavor combination of the strawberries and the custard is wonderful.

i took the advice about the balsamic vinegar and the vodka(I used rum). The strawberries are delicious and the ice cream is AWESOME.

This is one of the best ice cream recipes ever. Since it uses two whole eggs and not six or eight yolks it is much easier to prepare and easier to justify for those watching their diets. I, too, substitute whole milk for half of the heavy cream and it only serves to make it a creamier desert. I have altered other ice cream recipes to use this custard base and they have all come out wonderfully. Enjoy!

I will definitely make it again. I used 1 cup whipping cream, 3/4 cup half & half and only used 1 tablespoon lemon juice, no lemon zest at all. I macerated the strawberries in the sugar for about 2 hours. My husband, son, and his friends were eating this ice cream out of the ice cream maker - it was so good!

Next time I make this I will reduce or omit the lemon juice. Simmering the peel might be all the lemon flavor necessary. Intrigued by the last reviewers suggestion of adding vodka... going to give it a try!

I have been making ice cream since childhood, worked in ice cream parlours as a teen and generally love all things having to do with ice cream. I especially love fruited ice creams so here is what I do with a recipe like this one -- First, get your hands on the best fruit available. Second, flavor develops with time. Add your sugar and macerate the fruit on the counter for a while. Third, add some vodka (just a little) to your custard as it is mixing in with the fruit. The water in the fruit freezes solidly in a freezer, but when you add the vodka to the custard mixture it lowers the freezing temperature of the water and you end up with a creamier consistency for your effort. I promise. Just don't tell anyone I told you...

Excellent, but because you use all cream, vs. cream and milk, it freezes very hard.

When I first tasted this ice cream, I thought it was just so-so. I put in the freezer and forgot about it for a few days. When I tasted it again, I couldn't believe it was the same ice cream. Time brings out more of the strawberry flavor. Next time I might try it with just half and half or milk-it was so rich.

This is very flavorful ice-cream. I have a lemon tree and a strawberry patch that are currently in production. I used 1/8 a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 the amount of lemon peel. It is easy to make. Since some of my teeth react to extreme cold, so, I'm glad there aren't any chunks of frozen strawberries included.

The first batch was way to salty even reducted by 1/4 tsp. Second batch was much better adding a whole cup of sugar, 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. of vanilla. Do cut back on the salt and you'll have a wonderful dessert.

Before making the ice cream, I looked it up in the magazine and it calls for 1/8 tsp of salt NOT 3/8 tsp. This is one of the easiest receipes to make and the ice cream was flavorful, creamy and udderly (pun intended) delicious. I definitely will make it again.

I'm not a huge strawberry ice cream fan (i love chocolate to the core), but the description of this recipe piqued my interest. Smooth and definitely super premium homemade ice cream. Custardlike.

It LOOKS great, but its way too salty and the lemon taste took away from the fresh strawberries. If I made it again I would only put in 1/4 tsp salt and cut way back on the lemon as well. Too bad, it had a great creamy texture, but I couldn't eat more than two bites.

This is the best strawberry ice cream I have ever made. I pureed the strawberries as suggested in the recipe, but left out about 1 cup (quartered) to give the ice cream more texture. I'd also cut back on the sugar if your strawberries are ripe. Scalding the cream with the lemon peel gives the whole dessert a great flavor.
