This recipe has made me 'famous' for my pancakes! I have been making these for the past 4 years and have served them to many people, including lots of teenagers. I do not use blueberries or make the blueberry syrup, but this multi-grain batter is divine! I haven't had any trouble with it being too thin (I usually let it rest for 20 minutes or so before using).

Delicious. Didn't have that health food taste. Will make often

I thought these were only okay. Too much salt. Got my daily reccommended amount of fiber, though.

I made this dish seeing how 100% would make it again. But I was very disappointed. The pancake was too "eggy" and too watery. I couldn't flip it without it looking like scramble eggs. And it tasted like it too. I added about a quarter cup more flour to thicken it after I made 2 pancakes and it was still too watery and eggy. I compared it to another pancake recipe I pulled from this site and the other recipe had 2 eggs instead of 3 eggs so maybe this recipe may be better with 1 less egg. I made the syrup and that was too watery as well. Making the syrup was alot of work so I am not sure if it was worth the effort. The syrup tasted good though, not too sweet.

I usually make the whole-grain pancakes from this site, but blueberries were on sale this week, so I searched for something new. These were wonderful! Very light and fluffy with a nice blend of flavors. I was out of whole wheat flour so I used oat flour instead. I would add a little more flour to thicken the batter. Time to pick up some more berries and try the syrup - even though they are quite good plain.

I wanted a basic wheat pancake recipe, and I was so happy with the results of this one. I omitted the all purpose flour entirely in place of stoneground wholemeal, and opted for pure olive oil instead of butter. Because this was a spur-of-the-moment Sunday morning trial, I didn't have blueberries on hand, but have some very good blueberry spread to top the pancakes with. The pancakes were fluffy and "eggy" just as I want them. Quite a healthy alternative to regular pancakes. Definitely will make this again.

For those who are thinking of playing with this recipe, go for it - I halved it, substitued apple butter for the butter and, since I didn't have any buttermilk in the house, low-fat milk with enough yogurt (quite a bit) added to thicken it & give it a similar tang. I used giant frozen blueberies and added them to the batter - sprinkling giant blueberries on top makes the pancake stick to the pan & brown unevenly when you flip them (I was pretty sure that's what would happen & tried one that way to test my theory - yup.) We like a moist, not dry pancake & these were that, but not heavy. Tasty. Served them with maple syrup instead of the recipe's syrup.

Wow! Loved these cakes. Didn't make the syrup, just served real maple. However, I did sprinkle a spoonful of blueberries and some chopped pecans on each cake just prior to turning. A buttered griddle adds nice flavor and a little crispy crust. Yummy.

These are spectacular and particularly inviting since the syrup can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 months! I decreased the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups (rather than adding flour) - adding a bit more as needed. I thought the syrup was too watery: adding cornstarch to it made it too pasty-tasting, but leaving out the (3 cups) water made it the perfect thickness (I boiled the strained blueberry mixture with the sugar and lemon/lime peel till it reached 200 degrees).

A good hearty pancake recipe. I liked them with and without blueberries. I used safflower oil instead of butter and they turned out great. If you like hearty, multigrain pancakes and you want the ULTIMATE recipe, email me and I'll send it to you.

My kid just loves these pancakes ! I make them very small and just serve them with plain (real) maple syrup

These were great pankcakes. Very light and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly except took previous advice and added more flour. Ended up adding 3/4 cup more all purpose flour and they were excellent and very easy to flip. Will definitely make these again.

Thought adding 6 TBSPs of butter to a whole-wheat recipe was a little counter-intuitive, so used 2 TBSP of butter plus 2 TBSP of commercial no-fat butter/oil replacement product. Also used dry buttermilk (add to dry ingreds., then add water with wet ingreds.) and frozen, thawed in microwave, then drained blueberries (all we had). Found the batter to be too thin which made it very difficult to turn, so added a bit more flour (maybe 1/3 cup?). That helped a lot. Also used 1/4 cup versus 1/3 measure, since smaller cakes are easier to turn. Ended up with almost 24 4" pancakes!

Best pancakes I've ever had, in a restaurant or at home--very fluffy, very light, tastier than most, and no problems flipping--I used oil instead of butter, sour milk instead of buttermilk, and let the batter stand awhile before making the pancakes. Great!

These were exquisite: light and delicate and absolutely yummy. Had trouble flipping them on the griddle for some reason...but they were worth the effort.

My 3 year old daughter eats pancakes every morning. I had run out of the boxed mix and saw this recipe on the web. I liked that it had whole wheat flour instead of the white flour many mixes have. I made them not thinking she would like them. Not only does she love them, but my husband and baby boy love them too. Good job!!!!

Yum-- I substituted oatmeal for the wheatgerm and skim milk for the buttermilk to make waffles instead of pancakes. If you want to try it this way be sure to add about 3/4 more flour. My husband already wants them again!

Good

My husband loved these. I used frozen blueberries and was too lazy to arrange them on top of the cooking pancake, so I just mixed them into the batter. This was a mistake, the batter was soft and difficult to flip, and the pancakes were blue all over. Next time I will use fresh blueberries and follow the recipie exactly.
