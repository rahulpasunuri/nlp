My family absolutely loved these rolls! I left out the melted butter step and I don't think it was missed at all. I had to keep adding flour right up till the end to make it workable.

I was skeptical about this recipe because it doesn't call for you to proof the yeast before mixing with the rest of the ingredients. But I love pesto and gave it a try, letting it rise overnight. The only thing I didn't like about the recipe was making the potato mixture then having to throw part of it away, I thought that was silly. Why not just make the amount needed? Anyway, if you want to make a lower fat version you can add more potato and less butter. Overall a yummy recipe.
