I agree, good use of leftover turkey. The dressing is very versatile, use it with carrot slaw and sardines in a tortilla wrap.

Quick and fast, good use for leftover holiday turkey. The dipping sauce can be used as a salad dressing for coleslaw.

This was a great change from typical appetizers. Very tasty and everyone enjoyed them immensley. I will make again and didn't change anything in the recipe. Also low fat....a bonus.
