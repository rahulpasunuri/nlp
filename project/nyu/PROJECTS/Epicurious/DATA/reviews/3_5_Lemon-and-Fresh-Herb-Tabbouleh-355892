Had to make tzatziki to help mellow this one. It was just too over powering for my taste.

I don't know if it's because I couldn't get flat leaf parsley and fresh dill, or I'm just that attached to salt, but this was not a hit with me. It was so heavy on the parsley flavor the rest of the mix was overwhelmed. Will try again when I can get flat leaf parsley but will definitely use ALOT less.

Made this with barley instead of bulgar and also used the lemon zest from the lemons I juiced. Delicious!

Wonderful recipe! I upped the bulger wheat to over a cup and the garlic to 5 cloves, as well as adding a cucumber. Very flavorful!

Absolutely delicious! I also added some crumbled feta to this recipe, and it really married well with the already scrumptious recipe. A perfect dish to show off the fresh herbs of spring.

This was so tasty! I needed to make it gluten free and so substitued red quinoa for the bulgar. I also didn't want my organic lemon rind going to waste, so I added the zest as well as the juice. It comes out light and refreshing.

I really liked this recipe. I've tried a lot of tabbouleh recipes and this combination of fresh herbs really makes it delicious. Made the whole recipe for 2 of us so by day 3 I changed it up by adding cooked farro, feta cheese, pitted kalamata olives, & green onions which was sooooo good too!
