The flavors in this are delicious, and it is a fast brunch recipe. It makes a great winter frittata. I baked it 5 minutes longer than the recipe specified (because the top wasn't browned yet), but the inside got overcooked. Next time, I would take it off the stove burner more quickly (or maybe I had it on too hot a burner, because the bottom was a dark brown) and then bake it the extra 5 minutes, so it has time to brown on top. No need to wipe out the skillet after sauteing the greens. At first I thought 12 eggs was excessive, but proportionally it works out nicely - it makes about 8 servings, or 6 really hearty servings.

This was easy and tasty. I can't figure out why the recipe suggests rinsing and drying pan when you're just going to put all the ingredients back in!? There were a few places I was able to streamline the process - I wonder if it was written by a novice cook? I'll make it again, an easy way to use up ham, eggs, onions, potatoes, red pepper, prosciutto, cheese...anything in the fridge!

Great way use eggs from our chickens and the excess spinach and kale from the garden. I halved the recipe to make a quick dinner. It's easy, rich, and satisfying. Definitely a keeper, and would be great to serve guests at brunch.

I wanted make something to use the beautiful kale in my CSA box. This recipe sounded wonderful. I made it just as as written, and was underwhelmed. It took a long time to make and, although it was fine, it wasn't worth the time, calories or fat.

Tried to make this more healthy given the group that was to consume it, and it worked. Subbed some smoked salmon for the bacon; used half eggs and half egg whites (in the carton); used skim or part skim ricotta; and added in some sliced mushrooms (cooked in pan with greens before baking). Agreement from group this was delicious and I'm making it again for Christmas brunch

I made this for an easy, light dinner to serve before we all headed to my son's baseball practice and it was really delicious. The ricotta made the dish! A few changes...I chopped the bacon 1/4-1/2 inch, used spinach for greens and used about 9 oz, used vidalia onion instead of shallot, and added julienne sundried tomatoes. I really liked the sundried tomatoes in it and would definitely recommend them. This would be a great brunch dish.

Loved it! Made this for Sunday Brunch at the beach, when I'm less inclined to watch calories. I will change two things next time, 1/2 the bacon and lower stove top temp to avoid browning the bottom too much. A definite winner...YUM!

Made this for Father's Day and it was great. I never cook with this kind of greens and was surprised at how, after wilting, they are not real strong and all the flavors blend together. I would chop them smaller next time. The other adjustment I would make to is to have lower cooktop heat because the bottom got too browned - kind of a brown film. The skillet should be sprayed as I had a little problem getting the frittata out of the nonstick skillet. I used part skim ricotta.

I lightened this up considerably with Canadian bacon, reduced-fat aged Irish cheddar rather than Parmesan, and using half eggs, half Egg Beaters. That said, I missed the ricotta (will definitely use some version of that next time!) and would like to add a fresh herb of some kind (thyme?) to kick it up. This was a great way to use up giant bunches of chard and collards in my veggie crisper!

I am a true believer in this recipe. It's straightforward, no-fuss, hearty, and satisfying -- at brunch, at dinner, whenever, really. It also works great base from which to experiment.

I have made this several times with fresh kale and I love it! I like to make it the day of a big party. When everyone wakes up with a hangover the next morning, I just pop this in the oven and before long we have brunch. Highly recommended, yip yip yum yum.

I made this for brunch and it was a hit. It's definitely not low-calorie and it is not a quick and easy dish, but I would recommend

I made this today for mother's day brunch. And like the user before me wrote, I thought this was okay, but not great and definitely not worth all the calories.

I made a half recipe for brunch and thought it was fine. Nothing spectacular and not worth the incredible number of calories that must be in each little slice. I'd make a quiche next time-- a good deal lighter and just as tasty.

A runaway hit at brunch for friends. As recommended, used baby spinach, cut bacon to 8 oz, used half an onion instead of shallots, and shredded Parmesan instead of grated. Fantastic. Also added 1/8 tsp of cayenne but it wasn't enough to taste and kick really wasn't needed. Now I just need to find enough different friends to invite for brunch so I can make this again and again.

The ricotta gave this frittata a particularly lovely taste and texture. But I would definitely cut back on the greens, and chop them up much more finely. I thought the amount of bacon worked, but again, I'd chop it up more. Definitely use shredded rather than grated parm. Also, I'd add some cayenne or a shot of Tabasco to give this a little bit of a kick. Maybe some nutmeg too because nutmeg makes everything breakfasty better.

DELICIOUS! I will make this frittata again. Like others, I also substituted frozen spinach for the greens.

Delicious! I used spinach instead of the greens and used light sausage instead of the bacon. Also, I doubled the recipe - it was a hit for my birthday brunch!!

Delicious! We had this for dinner tonight. Both my daughters (9 and 13) gobbled it up, even though it was full of all those greens! I followed the recipe to the letter. My grocery store (Safeway) carries pre-washed, chopped bags of greens that are exactly 12 oz. so it was easy. The flavors are well-balanced and my husband thought the bacon amount was just right. A non-stick pan is a must. I will definitely make this again. I think pre-cooking the greens the night before would make it a quick, easy meal. Give this a try!

This was excellent. I subbed baby spinach for the greens, manchego cheese for the parmesan and 1/2 onion instead of the shallot. I'm going to make two next week to take to a brunch party.

Followed the recipe as is and made this as a thank you for some forgotten co-workers. They all loved it - it was re-heated and gone in 30 minutes.

I made this frittata and another one for a brunch - this one was a huge hit, and barely anyone touched the other (all vegetable) one. To make entertaining easier, I fried the bacon the night before. I also substituted spinach for the greens, and cooked up the greens and shallots the night before. Reheats really well, too. I would highly recommend this.

Loved this recipe! Made a few variations, used yellow onions instead of shallots, spinach instead of other greens and ham from Thanksgiving for the bacon. Fabulous flavor!

Even tho I wasn't crazy about this dish, I'd give it another whirl with a few variations...less cooking time, and i'd switch to shredded cheese, not grated. was easy to bring to an annual turkey bowl breakfast - just left it in the pan.

Forgot to say I'd make again!

I'm making this for the second time as I write this. It didn't seems like too much bacon to me...the other flavors are fairly strong, so it was a good balance to me. Also, this is a pretty large frittata--12 eggs - to serve at least six, so it didn't seem like too much, We thought it was delicious and reheated great too! I love to make frittatas, and this is a pretty, great fall weather version.

Just a comment. I make frittatas frequently, and this sounds wonderful, but be cautious with the very large quantity of bacon! I use 1 oz. of prosciutto for a similar frittata, and it's plenty of flavor for the entire pan. 12 oz. of bacon might overwhelm the flavors of the other ingredients.
