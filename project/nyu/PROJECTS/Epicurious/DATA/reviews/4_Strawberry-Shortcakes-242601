The flavor was good but, with a toddler pulling on my pant leg, I didn't read the 'self-rising' description for the flour. As such, I didn't add a leavening agent (I re-read the recipe - still with toddler on my leg - and thought no baking powder or baking soda was weird but went with it anyway): they, naturally, were flat and under-cooked in the middle. I don't think I should have to read the reviews to learn how to 'make' an ingredient. Spell it out, please! I did add a bit of almond & vanilla extracts to whole milk to brush on the tops... that was a good move, kept them edible. :-)

This recipe was very easy and everyone loved it. However, I did increase sugar to 4 T and used the baking powder as suggested by another reviewer. I also cut the biscuits into smaller rounds (used a regular sized biscuit cutter) and it made about 10 biscuits. Sprinkled the tops lightly with cinnamon & sugar. I would definitely make this again.

These were okay. The shortcakes needed waaayyyyyyy more sugar. Everyone loved them though.(:

add 3 tsp of baking powder to turn regular flour into self-rising (1 1/2 tsp of baking powder per 1 cup of flour)

Totally solid and would make again in a heartbeat. Super easy, and the shortcakes were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside - perfect. For the filling, I mixed lemon zest and a little sugar and let it sit. Then I added that to the strawberries a couple hours before serving and let it all macerate in the fridge. Split open the shortcakes, filled with vanilla ice cream and the berries. Delicious!

UHHHHMAZINGGGG! I also ate the shortcakes on their own, so awesomely good. I made my own self- rising flour, used buttermilk instead of regular milk and brushed the tops with buttermilk before baking. Came out perfect! The saltiness of the shortcake went great with the simple strawberry mixture... lemon juice and a little sugar, seriously?!?! So much better than any spongy, mass produced and tasteless hockey puck you could buy in the store. Everyone loved it!

This is a fantastic dessert! I added a bit of cinnamon in the batterI adore cinnamon on almost everythingand they baked in no time, while tasting delicious. I'll double the recipe next time as to feed more people, but this is a keeper.

I added some raspberries and blueberries and mangoes too. Luxurious breakfast!

Loved this simple shortcake. Brushed with the cream & sprinkled with vanilla sugar and turbinado sugar which added a nice sweetness and a great crisp to the tops. My 6yr old daughter created a filling of fresh strawberries, orange zest, sugar, lemon juice and half and half. We skipped the whipping cream deal and just soaked with our berry & dairy filling... Yup! My favorite strawberry shortcake recipe by far! CookFromScratch.com

I was disappointed after the 4-fork ratings....I thought the shortcakes needed more sugar. The berries also, I added more sugar. I still ended up with a not-too-sweet dessert. If I made this again ~ and I probably won't just because there are other recipes to try ~ I would up the sugar in the biscuits, too. On the upside, it was very easy to make and it WAS still GOOD, but nothing to write home about.

The shortcakes and the whipping cream were great. I ate the shortcakes by themselves!

the shortcake is marvelous - nice and crunchy but not too heavy either. i added some lemon and orange zest in the batter for interest. for the strawberry part, i added some lemon zest and orange zest again as well as some grand marnier. the whole recipe was fairly simple and fast. i can see myself using the shortbread part with banana and whipped cream too when it's not berry season.

Very simple and tasty! Made with skim milk as that was all I had on hand and they still turned out very well. I forgot to grab a lemon at the market, but the berries were fine without - although the lemon would add another layer for sure :) I made for a girlfriend who had never whipped her own cream and couldn't believe how simple it was ... She is a convert now! I also mashed the berries a bit to release more juices.

This was very good. I did add a little Grand Marnier to the strawberries. Next time I will smash them only slightly so that more juice is produced. The cake was nice, light, and moist. And OOOOOOOOOh so simple to make.

Just perfect with sliced strawberries and peaches. Simple and easy, and bakes up in no time. Inexpensive to boot. Would make again.

Excellent dessert! The shortcake is just the right sweetness & texture to compliments the berries and cream. THe natural sweetness of the berries goes so well with this shortcake. I will never know why people use sponge cake or biscuits when THIS is how it should truly be made. Friends loved it!

Very nice shortcake recipe. I've made other shortcakes in the past and have been disappointed. These had a nice crunch, weren't too sweet, and stood up nicely against the strawberries and cream. I didn't have any lemon, so just used strawberries sweetened to taste. I'll definitely use this recipe again.
