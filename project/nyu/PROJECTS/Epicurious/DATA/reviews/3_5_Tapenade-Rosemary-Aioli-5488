This recipe was a winner! the marinade was good and the aioli was a perfect accompaniment. Although I didn't have the tapenade, the remaining ingredients used turned out very flavorable. Used it to spread on a souvlaki and potatoes the next day. Will keep this one!!

I used "lite" mayo and only half what was called for, and it was very good. Next time i'd be sure to make it the day before to allow the flavours to blend better. I'd probably cut back on the oil as well... it was pretty rich. Incidentally, i tossed a couple tablespoons of the leftovers with some spaghetti noodles and chopped plum tomatos, which was delicious.

Delicious! If you have not already made the tapendade, just mix those ingredients with those of the Aioli and make it all together. You can use what's left as a spread for bread or crackers.
