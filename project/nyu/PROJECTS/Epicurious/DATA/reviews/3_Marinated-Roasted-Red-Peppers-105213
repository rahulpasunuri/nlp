I found this to be an intoxicating combination. I didn't have access to the pomegranate molasses but the balsamic vinegar works quite nicely. First time out, I used these peppers as accent for grilled string beans - allowing the string beans to benefit from the marinade too. Nice.

Delicious. I used these peppers to make sandwiches with goat cheese. I pouredthe extra marinade into a bowl and mixed with goat cheese until soft and easily spreadable. I spread the flavored goat cheese onto whole wheat bread, added the peppers, topped with baby spinach leaves and another slice of bread. Secure with toothpicks, cut into triangles. Great finger food, and just amazingly delicious.

The dressing is great and I loved the pomegranate molasses. I wanted to figure out a margarita using it!! I just didn't like it with the peppers and I put cumin in everything. I think if you follow the recipe and omit the dressing add a touch of salt and a little drizzle of olive oil you'll be better off.

I found the cumin to be off-putting. I enjoy roasted peppers but just didn't care for the flavor of these.

These are very good. I cut them up and add them to homemade spaghtetti sauce for great flavor. I also used them to make roasted pepper spread. YUM!
