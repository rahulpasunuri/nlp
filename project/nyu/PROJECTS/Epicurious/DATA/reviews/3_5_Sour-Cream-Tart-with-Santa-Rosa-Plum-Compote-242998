absolutely wonderful dessert. I served it to 6 people and 2 of them had seconds. I did add a little more sour cream than called for as I wanted more of a sour cream taste. The plum compote was outstanding!

Made this for my parents visit. YUM! It is a beautiful and easy dessert - even my husband had seconds and he doesn't ever eat dessert!

Filling never set. Crust didn't crisp. My first failed Epi recipe :( The results looked disastrous although did taste great.
