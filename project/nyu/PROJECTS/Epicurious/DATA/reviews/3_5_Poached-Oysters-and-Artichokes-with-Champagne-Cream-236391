We used fresh chokes (had a nice snack by steaming the leaves separatly), and boiled & trimmed the hearts the night before (keep them in lemon water in the fridge). Overall this was a straightforward recipe and a pretty dish at the table but underwhelming in flavor. Dinner guests ate it, but not much fanfare.

I made this for the second time as a main dish. For time spare: I use whole boiled oysters from a can. I use artichoke bottoms from a can, dashing a tiny bit of salt on each one of them, saute them both side until brown with a dash of champagne vinegar and oil, and assemble one on top of the other before adding spinach and the rest over it. I use baby spinach with saute shallots and garlic. I use creme fraiche instead of heavy cream, and melt a bit of blue cheese for extra kick. Serve with a cup shaped creamy risotto as a side dish. I believe you can substitute oysters for mussels or large clams.

I made this with farm fresh red swiss chard and canned artichoke bottoms. We used wild apalachacola oysters which were plump and as good or better than any of the northern oysters. It was excellent!

I agree with other reviewers: a lot of time can be saved by using canned artichoke bottoms and frozen spinach. While I haven't made it both ways, taking just 15 minutes to prepare seems better than the alternative. This recipe is a perfect starter for Valentine's Day--the flavors are incredibly delicate. The only downside is that they can get a bit messy if served away from the table.

This was good, not fantasic. But it could have "just been me". My husband liked it. If I make it again I would make some modifications.. add some olive oil.

During the preparation of the artichoke bottoms the first sentence doesn't make any sense why the flour should be added in this step. The flour should have been added in the step for the sauce, otherwise the sauce will be running with no consistency. Overall my husband liked it but he said it had a different flavor. It looked really nice in presentation.

For this past Valentine's Day, I prepared a three course meal for my wife, with these as the first. Unbelievably delicious. She'd never had cooked oysters, only raw, and was a little leary. Suffice to say, she came around nicely. The lobster risotto and chocolate ravioli I made for the next two courses, though delicious, paled in comparison. Why is it that appetizers tend to outshine main courses?

This is an amazing recipe, but save yourself some time. Use canned artichoke bottoms, rinse, drain and simmer in the cooking liquid as directed. Purchase frozen chopped spinach, thaw and squeeze out any excess liquid. Continue with spinach recipe as directed. I wouldn't skimp on the oysters though - there is no replacement for the fresh, briny flavor of a just-shucked oyster! This is definitely a show- stopper and is worthy of candlelight and bubbly to accompany it!

I used this recipe as an Amuse Buche for Valentines Day. Added a little Saffron to the Champagne sauce, (just for color). Went over very well.

I don't care for oysters and thought this was super. Just the right portion size for appetizer so you don't feel too full.

This is one my favorite recipes from here! It's a lot of work, but the results are heavenly! I didn't have a problem with the size - my artichoke bottoms were about 3" in diameters and fit the oysters without any issues. I would recommend reading the recipe through first before beginning - I poured out the cooking water for the spinach because I didn't see where it said to save it. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe, though you may want to do the artichokes ahead of time, since that probably takes the most time (actually, shucking the oysters was a pretty tedious process too!). The recipe is easily halved if you need.

I did not think the recipe was bad, it was a lot of work, for only a mediocre result. Use SMALL oysters; I returned from Tomales Bay with large oysters, a mistake as even one is too large to fit onto a large artichoke heart, let alone three. Also, recipe instructions are incomplete - they do not specify what to do with the chives. I might sugggest sprinkling them on, as a garnish, just before serving.

Outstanding oyster recipe.

My guess is that each artichoke bottom is topped with three oysters. This sounds divine, especially as one can buy canned artichoke bottoms now.

I'm somewhat confused by this recipe, perhaps someone could help. The math doesn't work - 4 artichokes vs. 12 oysters. Are you supposed to cut up the bottoms in thirds? P.S. I apologize for rating this recipe without actually having made the dish. I wish there was a way to ask questions about a recipe without rating.

It's awesome

This may well become a tradition at our house as a first course on Thanksgiving. The presentation is elegant and the flavors are exquisite. We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of a substitution of baby spinach - and we used about 6 ounces less. As the previous reviewer noted, it's a bit of a production but worth it, and since we kept the rest of the menu relatively simple, this was the one real showpiece. It helped to have fellow chefs in the kitchen!

Delicious. It was a bit of a production, but it was an elegant Thanksgiving first course.
