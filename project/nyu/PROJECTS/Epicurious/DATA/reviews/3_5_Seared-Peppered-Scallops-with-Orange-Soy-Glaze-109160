I served this over angel hair pasta, and for New Year's Day. It was fabulous, a delicious way to start the New Year. Will definitely make this again.

First, there was nary a scallop to be found at the store so I substituded shrimp. Still, it was delicious. The mix of orange and soy was sublime. It was easy and except for the time it took to clean and devein the shrimp, it was quick to make and serve.

great! A little tricky keeping the scallops warm while searing the second batch. My scallops weren't wet at all, I rinsed them and dried them with paper towels and then directly into the hot pan. So good!!!

This was super for last-minute dinner guests using scallops I had in the freezer. The only change I'll make next time is cook the sauce longer so it's thicker; I thought it was a bit runny (but was good over the white rice I served alongside).

We love this recipe. There are only two of us, but we made the full recipe! Nothing left. Next time we will use less scallops. Served it with the curried rice. Yum..

This was fantastic and really quick to cook as well. I had no problem getting the scallops to brown but I did give the raw scallops a good hard squeeze in paper towels before I started which seemed to do the trick. The sauce did take a while to thicken but I left the oven on at 70C (I think that's about 160F...) and left the scallops in there whilst I did the sauce. I also left the vegetable stir-fry which I made earlier to serve the scallops on, plus the serving plates, which seemed to solve the problem of things going a bit tepid during the wait. The extra time this bought me allowed me to add more orange juice and reduce it down further, so the sugar was all from the oranges and the sauce therefore more intensely orangey. I agree about the chilli (I added a couple of de-seeded chillis in there!) and about using sesame oil rather than groundnut/peanut oil. I also found a good slug of Worcestershire sauce gave it a nice kick.

Just okay in our book. It is impossible to brown scallops in a skillet. They give off so much liquid and you certainly don't need to oil the pan. Also, the searing time is way too long for average size scallops, especially when you pour the hot glaze over them after they've been sitting for a few minutes. The glaze takes more than 2 minutes to reduce/thicken and it still was more saucy than a glaze but it did have good flavor.

Gave this 4 forks for the flavor given the speed of the recipe, plus the fact that the sauce is flavorful enough to compensate for previously-frozen scallops. Made the sauce first, like others, and added ginger. Also put in a few drops of chili oil, and served with fresh cilantro on the side. Served with Braised Baby Bok Choy and rice.

This is a delicious, quick recipe. I use toasted sesame oil instead of peanut, and add a glug of grand marnier to the sauce about halfway through reducing. Yum.

Just ok, probably would not make again. Sauce thickened but took more like 5-7 minutes. Scallops do not retain heat well despite warm dish and returning to sauce for a few minutes before serving.

This dish was VERY good. I agree with everyone who said it...the sauce needs to be started early as it takes longer than 2 minutes to thicken up. I also put the scallops back in the sauce to heat them up a bit, plated them over a fried brown rice with soy sauce and curry powder, then poured the extra sauce over the whole dish. It was really excellent and easy to make.

this was very good and quick & easy to prepare. scallops don't retain heat well so I added them back into the pan with the sauce to heat them and coat them with the sauce.

This one's a keeper. Raves all around. As others have said, the ginger is essential, and making the sauce ahead is a good idea. I solved the reduction problem by flouring the scallops lightly before cooking them, which makes the sauce thicken up nicely when you add it back into the pan. It also helps the scallops brown faster so you don't overcook them. The orange juice/zest is swell, but the recipe would also work with lemon, lime, or even with grapefruit.

I, too, made the sauce ahead of time. It does take a longer time for it to thicken. I added honey instead of the recommended brown suger and ginger. Make sure that your pan is really hot in order to get that nice brown outside, yummy! My husband enjoyed it too.

I liked the simplicity and orange-ness of this recipe. After reading the others' reviews, I punched it up with fresh ginger and a small hot pepper from my garden. Plus I deglazed the pan with a few ounces of white wine, then added a teaspoon of brown sugar to balance it all. Poured it over grilled halibut and served with a Chardonnay/viognier. Yum!

Wow! So simple and really great flavor. Adding the ginger is a must. Will be making this again soon.

Yummy! I added chopped ginger to the garlic. When the sauce was completed, I added the scallops back into the pan for a minute. The meal was great. We served the dish with a simple romain salad tossed with carrot ginger dressing (found on epicurious). My husband went back for seconds. Thanks!

This is a great dish. Here is some advice on the reduction. Use a about a tablespoon of brown sugar. If that doesn't work to reduce the sauce, use a little bit of corn starch. Also, ginger is a really important addition to this sauce. I love this recipe, but the timeing is tricky because it's tough to keep the scallops warm while you reduce the sauce. I like to make the sauce in advance and then have it ready right when the scallops come out. Goes nicely with steamed carrots and baby bok choy.

Rating: 3
lovely! my sauce didn't reduce very good, and didn't get very thick, but i put it on the side so guests could have the option. still, fast, easy, and a real winner. definitely only 2 minutes each side. perfectly smooth, soft and buttery..... yummmy!

WOnderful-fast & easy I did not realize I didn't have an orange for the zest until the last minute, I substituted about a tablespoon of minced ginger & it was great!

Not bad, not great. I liked the orange sauce and served with rice. It is easy, though, and for that this recipe is worth making again, plus ingredients one always has on hand.

I used tilapia instead of scallops since I couldn't find a good low fat tilapia recipe on this site. It was excellent.

Good, quick and easy - but I'll do something different with my scallops, next time. There are better glazes in my opinion - this one lacked complexity of flavor.

Rating: 3
I'd make this again if I were in a hurry, but I have a feeling the sauce needs "something." The scallops browned beautifully in that amount of oil and at high heat. The peppery taste was a bit much for me, but my dining companion loved the scallops as they were; thus the 3-fork rating.

We enjoy several scallop recipes but this might just be our favorite. Simple, quick, and delicious.

This was good, but only 'okay'. A pleasant sauce - light and well balanced with the scallops, but somehow didn't 'wow' us. (We are very stingy with our fork ratings.) The problem may be that we really love the Seared Scallops with Mushroom recipe on this site - and we compare IT'S simplicy and taste to all other recipes. This is a nice sauce and definitely worth making again....but I might pair it with a light white fish next time.

I halved this recipe, but there was so much fond in my skillet, I should have used the entire amount of sauce ingredients. The orange flavor got lost in all the deglazed browned crust. Other than that, it was very good. Ground some white, green and black peppercorns together for the pepper blend. Served with curried rice and sugar snap peas.

i had 7 medium-ish scallops, and 2 blood oranges. made the full amount of sauce and sauteed a couple handfuls of baby spinach as a bed for the scallops. sauce turned out a beautiful color, and looked and tasted great with the scallops and spinach.. served 2 as a nice first course. we squoze a few drops of lemon juice over at serving time. great stuff!

Wonderful dish! The ground pepper, orange and soy combination was quite a hit with my fiancee. This recipe had the perfect kick to it.

This is a must for an easy, delicious dinner. Used the black pepper as that is what I had on hand and made 1/2 the recipe for two of us. Will do it again and again and again as we really enjoyed it. Would make a lovely entree for company. Served with cous cous, asparagus, a french baguette and the perfect white wine. We had blueberry tart for dessert. Whoever said that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach was absolutely right!
