I have been using this recipe for almost 7 years. No one has ever told me they can taste the anchovy in it. They are usually surprised when I tell them! The preparation time is mainly made up of washing and de- stemming the mushrooms.

These mushrooms turned out great with a few changes. I doubled the amount of anchovies, added extra cheese, and used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs. I will definitely be making these again.

These weren't bad, they just weren't too tasty. Maybe next time I should add more anchovies and cheese to the filling. They also don't look v pretty.

Oh man, good stuff! I've been looking for a stuffed mushroom with lots of flavor. I did half store-bought breadcrumbs and half fresh, and added double anchovies. I also added grated peccarino-romano cheese to the tops before i baked them. I like lots of flavor! I was worried that my guests wouldn't dig the anchovy overkill, but these disappeared super fast.

I made this dish for my extended family Holliday party and it was a big hit! I added more sardines than recommended.

I made this for a party I threw and it turned out wonderful. In fact, everyone liked them so much that I'm making them on request for another party!

Yummy! I doubled this recipe and quadrupled the anchovies (my boyfriend loves em) and they were scrumptious.
