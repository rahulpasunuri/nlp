OMG this is soooo bland. I did not add the cornichons, but it certainly needs something. In addition this cooking method does not add to the croquette. As is it is a waste of good gruyere.

What a unique way to make potatoes. I didn't chill them as long as the recipe called for, I also chose to leave out the pickles and I used Panko as the breading. They were fantastic. By the way, they were also great reheated the next day.

While visiting Spain, my husband ate potato croquettes at every meal. This recipe is comparable to many of the croquettes in Spain. Although, I did adapt the recipe to match the Spanish version by adding ham/bacon and not adding the pickles. Very pleased with this recipe!

I also left out the cornichons, and I sauted the potatoes and onions together, then added water and boiled, then drained. I added the cheese, egg, and tarragon, and then mashed everything together. I also didn't wait to chill everything, but the croquettes still stayed together fine. Very tasty!

We make this quite often omitting the cornichons. It is also a great way to use leftover potatoes ... just lightly saute the onions before adding the pre-cooked potatoes. I also like to use 1/2 fresh and 1/2 dried tarragon.

YUM YUM YUM...I love gruyere cheese...if you don't like potatoes just eat the cheese plain on a piece of crusty bread!!!
