The vegetables were too sweet. The skin of the squash was not very good to eat. The nutmeg was overpowering for my taste. The sweet potatoes were better than the squash.

I made this with acorn and butternut squash (no sweet potatoes on hand). I sliced the butternut in the same manner as the acorn, except peeled it. We ate some of the acorn peels, they were ok, but after a while we just wanted the squash. It was delicious! Love the simplicity of this recipe and will definitely make again.

Forgot to mention, when we ate this, I initially took the rind of the acorn squash off but then I was enjoying the dish so much I tasted the rind. I was surprised to find it slightly crunchy and very tasty. My husband and I both ate it from there on out. Will be making this again.

Wow, this was really good. I really don't like sweet potatoes but we keep getting them in our CSA share. I keep trying to figure out ways to cook them that I can manage to eat, but I haven't found many ways. Generally speaking, I don't like sweet vegetables (e.g., carrots, parsnips, peas, etc.). I really enjoyed this, though, even though it was sweet. The brown sugar turned into sort of a crust and provided wonderful texture. Like another cook, I was worried about the flavor of the nutmeg, but it was perfect. Now I'm really excited about all the sweet potatoes (and acorn squash) from the CSA! Will be making this for Thanksgiving to share with my family.

We served this dish at Thanksgiving, and it was one of the biggest hits of the feast! I'm about to make it again for an after-Christmas family get-together . . . . yum!!

I made this just as the recipe suggested. I thought the acorn squash skin added to the visual presentation. Some people ate the skin...some did not. Healthy version of sweet potatoes that does not sacrifice taste

I took the advice from previous reviews and took out the acorn squash earlier, with about 20 minutes still to go. They came out great. I was afraid the nutmeg taste would overpower the dish, but it did not. The other thing I would do different, though the recipe does not spell it out, is to swap the two baking pans half way through the second-phase of baking. Without it the bottom of the sweet potatoes touching the pan in the bottom rack came out all burned!

This tasted pretty good although leaving the skin on the acorn squash was a little awkward. I ended up removing the skin after baking and that helped but it didn't look as nice. This was a nice dish and I'd do it again but maybe not for Thanksgiving.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Came out nice. I didn't use the acorn squash just all sweet potatoes. Nice change from mashed sweet potatoes and a lot better than the sweet casserole. It goes into the Thanksgiving recipe box.

I found this recipe very bland. I did make some changes in the procedure; cooked the potatoes and squash separately as the potatoes take longer than the squash. I cooked the squash for about 30 minutes total and the potatoes about 45 minutes total and then reheated all of it together later in the day. I still think the vegetables were over cooked. I used the same portions of butter and brown sugar as called for in the recipe but I would have liked a thicker glaze.

I made changes to the recipe. I roasted the acorn squash whole and let them cool. Scooped the squash out and placed it randomnly among the slices of sweet potatoes. I roasted the slices of potatoes as mentioned and flipped them 1/2 way through cooking. Made a sauce with butter, turkey broth and butter and added it to the casserole. Sauted whole fresh sage leaves in butter and scattered over the veggies. Delicious. Didn't want to serve the acorn squash with the skin on it. I will repeat this recipe next thanksgiving.

Well, I'm glad that I made this the day before Thanksgiving. I was going to reheat it as the recipe suggested. Instead, it's going straight from the oven into the trash. I'm not sure what I did wrong, if anything, but the veges either burned or were undercooked without many falling in between extremes. Looks awful. I'd recommend finding a different recipe.

This was a delicious side and will be gracing our Thanksgiving table. I recommend serving this with Cider-Glazed Turkey (here on Epicurious from Gourmet Nov'09). I have limited space in my oven, so I had to adjust a little - using one pan and cooking alongside the turkey at higher heat. It worked beautifully, I just had to shorten the cooking time a bit and flip the veggies in the pan halfway through.

Had this as possible for Thanksgiving. Made it on a test run this week. Outstanding! Don't worry about serving the acorn squash with the rind on - it's an outstanding side dish. Definitely on our menu this year.

This is an easy and totally wonderful side dish. We served it to guests last night and it was almost totally devoured between 4 people. I weighed two sweet potatoes to make sure I had 1.75 lbs and my acorn squash was slightly smaller than 3 lbs. The flavor is really good and was a perfect side for a cold fall evening.It was easy to prep and set aside and the baking time was the same as the meatloaf I was baking, so it was very convenient. I can see why this would make a great Thanksgiving dish.

One problem with this recipe is that you leave the skin of the acorn squash on, and since it isn't edible, it's an awkward eating experience. I don't know if it would work if you removed the skin - I suspect the squash wouldn't hold it's shape. Cubes might work better than slices overall. I had to put it all in one pan due to space, so I sliced the sweet potatoes a little thinner than called for, but still some of them weren't fully cooked while others were nicely soft. I used freshly grated nutmeg, maybe 1/2 tsp but it was a little too powerful. I would stick to the stuff in the jar for a more subtle flavor.
