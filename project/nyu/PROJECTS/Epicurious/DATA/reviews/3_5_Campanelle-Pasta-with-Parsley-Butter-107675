Those who didn't love this must have made without the ragu. It is very plain if you don't add a sauce, but the combination of freshly roasted tomatoes (I did mine from scratch instead of canned) and lemon-parsley is delicious!

Good if you want a simple, quick dish after work, but not if you want something more flavorful. Liked the seasoned butter mix (I'd like to try it on Italian ciabatta or whole wheat bread), but the dish as a whole is very blah. Add more salt, pepper, cheese, or something to spruce it up.

it was a little bland, but some salt added a nice touch - but overall, a good way to use up a bunch of parsley given to us and made a nice light-flavored dish to complement a spicy pork dish. my husband added parmesean cheese to his.

Doesn't match picture. Menu or this recipe don't call for ragu.

This was missing something -- cherry tomatoes?

This dish was a big hit. Familiar enough to please less adventurous diners.

This pasta is wonderful with the Chicken and Andouille Sausage Ragu.
