I made this in the oven. I didn't have any apple juice so I used water. I wish I had marinated it overnight (alas, did not plan ahead), but the marinade was still tasty. I used fingerling potatoes from our CSA and bone-in pork chops. I cooked the cops until 145 degrees (the potatoes take about twice as long as the chops, so plan accordingly), and the meat was tender and the potatoes were very tasty. Not going to say it is my favorite chop recipe, but then again, I should have marinated longer.

I've made this twice now. The first time I thought both the meat and potatoes were a little blah so I made the following changes: 1. Added 1 extra tablespoon of mustard 2. Marinated everything for a full 24 hours 3. Boiled the potatoes for about 18 minutes instead of 10. This helped and my guests all enjoyed it very much. I'd still be interested in finding a way to add even more apple flavor though. BTW, I served this with a pineapple salsa (jalapeno, scallions, etc.) and several of my guests REALLY liked the meat with the salsa on top.

I think all I can say about this recipe is blah. I was really hoping for some summer comfort food. This just didn't do it for any of us.

I made this recipe for a dinner party, and it turned out wonderfully. It got rave reviews. I did not have room on the BBQ for the potatoes, so I put them on a cookie sheet at 350 for 20 minutes. They turned out great.

This is a fabulous recipe! I made it for friends years ago and they still remember it. I just found it and will use it again. You will not be disappointed in this recipe. This is a winner!

My whole family really liked this recipe. I used thin cut pork tenderloins and marinated them for about 3 hours before putting them on the grill. I served them with applesauce, mash-potatos greenbeans and a fruit salad...the porkchops are not too sweet and them smell amazing. Will definitely make again.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it was just plain awful.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, and it received excellent compliments at dinner. The marinade's aroma is absolutely heavenly. This is definitely a keeper!

The pork chops were ok, however there is no comparison to the Grilled Spiced Double-Thick Pork Chops that are offered on this site. The potatoes were good but burned a little too much.

Tasty and easy to prepare. The apple taste in the marinade was perfect, not too strong. Perfect for entertaining outdoors.

Another winner from Epicurious. These pork chops were delicious; the apple flavouring was not at all overpowering. The potatoes were an even bigger hit - two picky eaters raved about them. It's easy and convenient because I could prepare everything the night before, then just grill them when my guests arrived.
