This recipe is fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the combination of flavors. I wouldn't change a thing.

pretty good recipe. i added blue cheese and raisins which admittedly make it an entirely different salad but people liked it. adds a bit of heft to it. i would make this again for sure, in simpler version

This is fast, easy, different and delicious. Best of all, except for the apple, the prep work can be done ahead. Makes a bit more honey-mustard dressing than I like but it will be used on another salad. I used coarse grain dijon but made no changes.

This is a a very good salad. I made it exactly as written. My mother always made a mayonaise-based version of this salad every year for Thanksgiving, and I thought it would be nice to try this dijon version. It was very good, tangy, and held its own on the Thanksgiving table. But, I keep thinking that I might add a bit more honey next time, or maybe add something else... perhaps the cranberries and cheese another reviewer suggested. I will definately be playing around with this one.

We love this salad! Started out following the recipe, but then one night I thought dried cranberries would be a good addition, & it was! Sometimes I make it into a tossed salad with whatever lettuce we have on hand. Sometimes I add bleu cheese or feta cheese, too. It's always great!

A very refreshing and delicious salad for summer. The dressing is good for mixing other vegetable salad too. It took me quite some time to cut everything up but will definitely make it again.

I made this to bring to a friend's Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it, kids and adults alike. It was a lovely, cool, tangy, tart, crunchy foil to all the rich turkey and other dishes. It's also very pretty. Made tons! I used all the vinaigrette and it was a little too much--pooled somewhat at the bottom of the bowl. And unlike other dressed salads, I found it was still good the next day, only slightly less crunchy. I will definitely make it again.

It looked strange, but I decided to make it for my office pre-Thanksgiving potluck "event" yesterday. I figured 8 servings would be enough, though about 16 - 20 people were coming. It's a side dish, and some folks will think it so strange that they won't eat it, and some will try it. A day later: I've been asked so many times what the recipe is for this dish, and one guy raved so much that he expects some more on his desk Monday morning. LOL I tried it right after mixing in the vinaigrette, and was totally wowed by the fresh flavor. I was planning on making some for my fam at home this weekend, but I'll save some extra for a few folks at the office (plus the recipe!). I made it strictly as written (will try cranberries or cheese another time), and it was labor intensive ONLY because I don't have a chopper or food processor (which I'm picking up on the way home tonight). Delicious!

Did it exactly as described except for adding a bed of spinach, as others suggested. It is a winner. There is a lot of dressing left over!

Very interesting combination of fresh ingredients. I followed the exact recipes except I use spicy coarse grain mustard. Delicious!

We loved this salad. Simple to make, but delicious - used wholegrain mustard, and left the apples unpeeled. The extra dressing tasted great on a salad of winter greens the next day.

I added arugula to give it some spice with the sweetness of the apples and the dressing.

Too tangy, no sweetness, got soggy too fast, everyone tried some but left it on their plates! added dried cranberries and that did no good...sorry but yuch!

Very tasty and a lovely monochromatic color.I did not peel the apples as stated. I figured it wouldn't make much of a difference anyway. I also plated the salad individually, sprinkling the walnuts on top along with some crumbled goat cheese. I think this is a salad you either love or you hate.

Very tasty and refreshing. Great spring/summer recipe! I added feta cheese and it turned out great! Everyone loved it! Have made it multiple times since!

Nice and fresh. I made it just as written, and found it quite tasty. I wish I had a veggie shredder, though, as it took a while to cut everything up.

try it over a bed of baby spinach with walnuts, crumbled pancetta, and warmed brie.

Very light and delicious (healthy too!). I ended up using 3 lbs. of organic granny smith apples and a little feta cheese. Next time I would add cilantro and possibly some dried cranberries. Very good flavors - the toasted walnuts were a great compliment!

This dish was amazingly good and easy. Since I didn't have any walnuts, I substituted pecans - delicious. As an added bonus, I tossed in some crumbled gorgonzola cheese - a huge hit. I served it after a main course of beef burgundy, and it complemented it beautifully. Overall, it's just a great and very different salad. Make it for your family and friends on a cool fall evening. They'll love it!

This was a favorite at our New Year's Eve dinner. We have some people in our family with hypoglycemia, who cannot eat processed sugars, so I replaced the honey with apple juice concentrate. Also, I slowly whisked in the olive oil, and found that I really only needed less than half of what the recipe called for. This was delicious. I will next try this dressing on a spinach salad.

My guests all loved it. Easy to make ahead of time, fresh light, crispy and delicious.

this was a hit and had many asking for the recipe, also extremely easy. I added more apple due to the amount of dressing. Also I candied half of the walnuts and topped right before serving...

A friend served this at a recent dinner party, and I came here to make it myself. Easy and delicious!

I like that this salad was simple, original, and tasty. Like the other reviewer, I also had more than enough dressing. The salad was crunchy and fresh and the dressing was very tasty.

I made this salad with the rest of the menu and found it to be crisp and having nice flavors. I tend to burn nuts while toasting, and it happened this time, but that's just me. I didn't need the amount of dressing made, but I'm sure I can find another use for it.
