The timing on these have to be impecable! If you don't get it over the custard cup immediately, it hardens. I only got one done and the others broke. Definately not worth the effort

Very good, but I found them to be more hassle than they're worth.

Very tasty and delicate. I filled them with a combination of lemon, mango, and raspberry sorbet. And they were easier to make than I thought they would be!
