I'd say this was 2-2.5 forks; like other reviewers I tweaked the recipe to both thin it a little and add some flavour. Fresh parsley and chives went in the food processor, and instead of plain onion I made a quick "relish" with red onion, cucumber, fresh mint, a little fresh orange & lime juice and a bit more diced avocado (and salt/pepper to taste). That really helped perk it up a bit. Having said that, it was yummy!!

This was surprisingly delicious! It's not the type of thing I would normally make. In fact, I've had the recipe printed out for several years and just came across it while looking for something else and thought it would be a great way to use up some pouches of guacamole I bought from Costco. I followed the recipe pretty much as is, but pureed about half an onion in the food processor before adding the remaining ingredients, used all buttermilk instead of using part yogurt and added some cilantro. I will definitely make this one again!

This was a refreshing appetizer but very rich! I would definitely thin it with chicken broth or milk, I followed the recipe exactly and got a yogurt-like consistency. It was also very tart, next time I would use half and half in place of buttermilk, and cut the amount of lime juice by half. The chopped red onions on top were a nice addition.

I had to make a few adjustments to compensate for the type of avocado available from my South Florida tree: a couple of tablespoons more of yoghurt, half again as much avocado and a bit more of the chili powder. It worked well.

We found this tart,creamy with a bit of a kick--really lovely. I did thin with a bit more chicken broth than called for.

This has a nice flavor but is too thick! Also, you really need to eat all of the soup in one serving--the color changes after a couple of hours and begins to look very unappetizing.

This was a simple and quick recipe. However, I substituted coconut milk for buttermilk and fresh ginger for the chile in order to go with the asian-fusion menu the my friends and I prepared. There were no complaints, except that there wasn't enough.

My husband and I loved it, though I made a few adjustments, Instead of the yogurt I used half-and-half, and I cut the lime juice by half

Too much lime juice probably. It was pretty tart.

Too rich. My husband liked it but it was just too thick. I will try to figure out a way to thin it out without sacrificing flavor.
