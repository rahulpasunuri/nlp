Thankfully, I read a number of the reviews before starting this and I think the modifications gave this recipe the boost it needed. Like others, I substituted Kahlua for the water in the cake which gave it an interesting/different flavor. I don't know if I'd add 1/2 cup next time (Kahlua is not cheap to come by where I live!) but I appreciate the complexity it added to what might have been a bland cake. I also didn't have sour cream on hand, but have a similar cake recipe that doesn't call for it and left it out. Instead I added 1/2 cup of oil. I used the amount of gelatin called for in the Panna Cotta, and used entirely bittersweet chocolate and bumped up the amount of cream to about 4 cups. Don't forget to remove the vanilla bean pod even though the recipe doesn't explictly state it! Also following another reviewer's advice, I baked the entire cake in a springform pan and then simply sliced it in half. I then reassembled the whole thing back into the springform and placed it into the freezer to set. As I was making this, I realized that this uses over a pound of chocolate (!!), in addition to oodles of cream, so this is a very decadent (and expensive!) dessert. I sampled a bit after letting it set overnight and it is very delicious. Should make for a fantastic and special birthday cake! Didn't require as much effort as I had anticipated, it took about 2.5 hours from start to finish.

This cake is RICH. Brought this choco-rama to a friend's place for his annual Feast of the Seven Fishes party. It was such a hit, the host hurried us out the door---and kept the leftovers for himself!

I thought the cake, panna cotta and presentation were excellent. However, my Husband and son did not care for the chocolate cake, but loved the panna cotta. Guess I'll make just that for them next time. Would make the entire cake for company as I think it is company worthy.

With the benefit of the previous reviewers comments (specifically the Kahlua and nixing any milk chocolate which I think is almost always a good idea)this cake went over brilliantly as the groom's cake for my sister's wedding. VERY rich but definitely wonderful. I did spend the money for super expensive delicious chocolate, but hey, it was my sister's wedding. And hopefully when I make it again with less expensive chocolate it will be just as good!

Amazing presentation and flavor, I have made this several times for company and its always a showstopper. Worth the effort.

I used the suggestions and used Kahlua instead water in all parts, as well more cream than milk. I had to use more gelatine as I had problem with thickening of the panna cotta. In overall everybody loved it, best after 2 days in the fridge.

This cake looks a lot better than it tastes. But I do believe it would be fantastic with a few alterations. I found the cake layers to be very tasty and moist. The panna cotta needs a higher ratio of cream, and less vanilla. I will definitely make it again with these alterations.

Excellent and beautiful cake. I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted kahlua for the water in both the cake and the panna cotta. I also added slightly more gelatin to make sure the panna cotta would thicken properly and I had no problems. It does take some time and patience stirring the panna cotta in the ice bath to set, but be patient and it sets up perfectly. I used only high quality semi sweet and bittersweet chocolates and no milk chocolate. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Though the recipe didn't tell how to make the chocolate gelee you see in the pix, I knew how to make my own being a personal chef. I instead made a chocolate Chantilly cream, piped 2 rows using a star tip around cake top, and filled in the middle with choc. cake crumbs left over from trimming the cake. I would suggest adding more gelatin for firmer panna cotta. Everyone who tasted it, loved it. I already have an order for one for the holidays. Also made a 2nd version for home using a blackberry gelee and fresh blackberries for the topping. It is wonderful!

This cake was a major hit among people who are already used to my extravagant baking habits. Follow the user suggestions of using Kahlua as much as possible and ditching all traces of milk chocolate. I also used the higher cream/milk ratio in the panna cotta. The cake will be the opposite of bland if you follow these recommendations. A few suggestions - I make the cake itself in one springform pan since I didn't have two of the same size, and then sliced it. I did all of the assembly back in the original springform. If you are comfortable manipulating cake slices this seems the most efficient route to me, although requires a longer bake time. I found storing the cake in the freezer - during assembly and after - was a good idea. It doesn't freeze rock solid and can thaw out just fine on the table while you are eating dinner. I think the gelatin needs to cook on the heat for a bit to dissolve properly - I was left with gelatin blobs in the panna cotta, which went unnoticed in the cake but would be obvious if you tried to just serve the panna cotta on its own. I also made the chocolate rim much wider (a little too wide even) with the intent of having it pleat over the top randomly and form a space for berries. Again worked great and left people mystified - and thinking it was a lot harder than it was. Parchment works as well as wax paper. In fact - put a parchmant round at the bottom of the springform and save yourself a little suffering.

Fab-u-lous! Like some, I substituted Kahlua for the coffee (just heated it with the water) and half Kahlua to replace half of the water to mix with the gelatin. IMPORTANT for the panna cotta and proper thickening and set - keep your house (specifically the kitchen) at 72-degrees or cooler, as heat and humidity will cause problems. I had no problem with my panna cotta and did not have to add more gelatin. Just for kicks, I also made a vanilla bean pastry cream and folded it into some freshly whipped cream. Just before serving, spread a light layer of this mixture on the top layer of the panna cotta and decorate with fresh (rinsed and drip- dried) whole strawberries (stem on) and blackberries... gorgeous & yummy!

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out perfectly, it had a nice rich chocolate flavor. It looked beautiful as a whole cake and sliced!

Before making make I read all reviews and followed some of the advice. I used Mocha flavored Kahlua instead of coffee for the cake. For the Panna Cotta, I used 4 cups of cream and 1 of whole milk. This gave the panna cotta a creamier, firmer texture. Instead of dissolving the gelatine in water I used 1/2 of Kahlua and only bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate. The Panna Cotta was not bland. The Mocha Kahlua gave it the flavor it needed. Unbelievable dessert.

Rating: 3
The panna cotta was very good but I think the cake brought the overall finished product down in flavor. I didn't have trouble with the cake setting. I doubt I'll make this again, but I will try just making the panna cotta for a dessert. The dark chocolate made it very rich and delicious.

I thought this cake was great. I did add more gelatin because of other reviews but found that I didn't need it. You just have to make sure that it is very cold, I put mine on the back porch and chilled it (stirring occasionally) I didn't have two spring forms the same size so I did the cake and panna cotta in the spring form and the other layer in a regular cake pan. I also forgot to buy bittersweet so I mixed semi sweet and unsweetened. I got rave reviews and I bake for some pretty tough critics

This recipe left me very upset. It is very expensive and does not come out right. The cake is heavy and the panacota would need a bit more gelatin. It was very difficult to give the finishing touch as the panacota was to soft.I had to put it in the freezer so I could handle it.

Used 4.5 ounces of Scharffen Berger 70%in the cake and another 4.5 ounces of Scharffen Berger 70% along with 6 ounces of 41% milk chooclate with nibs in the panna cotta. Superb results and flavor.

I did not have any problems with the Panna Cotta setting, as some reviewers reported. And surprisingly, my chocolate band looked perfect. However, I agree with the cook from Burlington, Ontario - the flavor was nothing special. I used Perugina chocolate, and while the flavor of the panna cotta was promising on its own - after setting and paired with the wonderfully-moist-but-terribly-bland cake, fell short of my expectations. The best part was the chocolate band. In short: Not offensive, great presentation, but the taste was a disappointment.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic. This was one of the most chocolatey-est cakes I've ever had or made. I used Ghirardelli baking chocolate and just two creamy Lindt chocolate bars for the cake and it turned out to be the richest thing I've experienced. My boyfriend devoured two huge pieces then collapsed from chocolate overload.

Rating: 2
This is a very pretty cake - the chocolate band is easy to do and turns out picture perfect. The thing is, the cake itself is not anything special. The panna cotta isn't very exciting - it ends up tasting like not very interesting chocolate pudding. The cake itself is moist and delicious, if a little plain. This is a recipe that falls a little short - the flavour definitely doesn't match the look or effort.

well i have not finished this yet...i have done all the parts up till the chocolate rim. i haven't ad any problems. i did however sub the coffee with Kahlua along with the water in the panna cotta. and used 2% milk. but i must say that the batter of both taste soo good. ill definitely make it again.

This is the most beautiful cake I have ever made AND it tastes delicious. The panna cotta wasn't setting, and I had way more than I needed. I kept on reading the recipe to make sure I did it right. The chocolate band was not as hard as it looks. Follow the directions to the letter (even the 2 minutes and MEASURE the strips of wax paper!) and your strip will come out nicely. Mine was a bit uneven, but it looks like I intended for it to be rustic.

I would use less gelatin. I will try 4tsp next time. The cake is now in the fridge.

Having cooked with BA recipes for 40 years, it did not seem that this recipe had been tested sufficiently. I hope this is not an indication of things to come with a magazine that I obviously use and enjoy. The end result got rave reviews and I would make it again, however, with the following changes. Use parchment paper on the cake pans and grease and flour it. I substituted 9" pans for the 10" so that the cake would have some height. Instead of hot coffee, I used Kahlua, a liqueur,in the same amount. Because of the sugar in the Kahlua, I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. The cake was moist and almost melted in your mouth. For the panna cotta, I used all bittersweet chocolate and substituted buttermilk for the milk. It gives it a tanginess and the flavor that one reviewer said it lacked. Otherwise, I think it would be cloyingly sweet. I agree that you have to be careful with the gelatin to make certain that it all gets dissolved, so I heated it after I had stirred it in the water. With the chocolate band I cut the wax paper 3 1/2" wide and put a thin layer of butter on the foil where the chocolate was spread over the wax paper, don't get too much butter or the chocolate will just slide. With these changes, I will make the cake again

This cake was AMAZING! I made it for a party and everyone loved it. I also had the same problem with the panna cotta not setting, so I did like most added more gelatin. The chocolate band was very easy to make, although I was completely covered in chocolate.LOL Will definately make again, so worth the time and effort.

Everyone went CRAZY over this desert (even I liked it, and I don't care for chocolate!). Probably one of the most decadent things i've ever made. Tips: 1) Although the recipe doesn't say it, remember to strain the vanilla beans from the panna cotta mixture! 2) The chocolate band is a pain in the 'you-know-what'. A better way to do it is to spread the chocolate on the waxed paper, chill it slightly, put it around the cake, put the cake (with the bans attached) in the refrigerator, and THEN take the waxed paper off after about 10 minutes. It just peels right off! SO much easier!

Getting the panna cotta to set up wasn't that much of a problem. I used 7 tsp. of gelatin, metal bowls (the larger one VERY large!) and put both in the refrigerator to help the set up process. It took about 45 minutes or so and was getting really thick at the end. The presentation is very impressive, and guests raved about it. And the cake portion tasted pretty good. Sadly, the problem is that the panna cotta wasn't that flavorful. Perhaps using only bittersweet chocolate would help. Perhaps adding another flavor such as rum, or coffee might boost the complexity of the flavor, but it just wasn't that interesting. I *might* try it again, based upon the presentation and the cake flavor, but I would definitely add something to the panna cotta.

not worth it. i agree with the cook that says the panna cotta tastes like chocolate pudding - what a waste of all my bittersweet chocolate!! and the cake wasn't that great either. do yourself a favor and make the double chocolate layer cake recipe featured on this site and leave this one alone!!

I made this for New Year's Eve, and it was beautiful. I served it surrounded by ripe whole strawberries, which really helped the presentation. As for taste... not that great. The cake was good, but the panna cotta lacked flavor. I will still probably make it again, but will surely make changes - maybe use espresso instead of water, replace the milk chocolate with semi-sweet, maybe add more sugar, vanilla or rum extract or chocolate. I did accidentally happen upon an excellent way to thicken the panna cotta - I ran out of ice and as it was winter in the Chicago area, I set it in a bowl of packed snow. Amazingly effective!!

I made this for Christmas and my family loved it. I had trouble getting the panna cotta to set. I stuck it in the freezer and it wasn't entirely set even after three hours. If you have to transport this cake, I would recommend not putting the chocolate band on beforehand. Otherwise, I would definitely make it again. The cake's moist and suprisingly not chocolate overkill considering all the chocolate that you put in it.

Wow, did I agonize over making this cake! All the reviews had me nervous so I did some research on panna cotta at Cooks Illustrated. The ratio of gelatin to milk looked pretty good relative to their recipe, but the technique was a little different - they softened the gelatin in milk and then brought that mixture up to 135 degrees to dissolve the gelatin. I wonder if some of the reviewers were having problems because the gelatin didn't dissolve? Likewise adding more gelatin doesn't seem like it would work if you don't separately dissolve it first. Anyway, mine did set up fine. It took longer than the recipe suggested, but I was keeping an eye on the temp and it definitely thickened a lot as it got down below 50 degrees (the CI recipe said to stir over ice until it was 50 degrees and it should be the consistency of eggnog. I went a little further to get it like runny pudding. I had more trouble with the chocolate band. I don't t hink it helped that my 2-1/2 year old daughter was "helping". I think I needed to use more chocolate, maybe let it thicken up a little before spreading so that it would make a thicker band. Mine cracked in a few spots, so I made some patches. My guests were very impressed but I wasn't thrilled with how it looked. I will try the chocolate band idea again, though. Overall everyone loved the cake, although it was served at 10pm after many bottles of wine so I'm not sure everyone's judgment was superb!

This cake was delicious. My mom and I made it for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it. I thought it was relatively easy. The panna cotta took a while to thicken, but we used a previous reviewer's advice and put the panna cotta in the biggest bowl of ice and water as we could and it thickened, albeit slowly. Next time I'll put it in the fridge for a while. For those who had trouble with the panna cotta, maybe the gelatin sat in the water for too long?

It seems that everyone who reviewed this recipe either loved it or hated it. Unfortunately, I too am the later. I agree that the cake in this recipe was exceptional. But the pana cotta was SUPER runny, and never stiffened up, even after adding triple the gelatin called for. Ended up pouring the soupy pudding over the cake and stuck it in the freezer thinking that it might harden up...but nope. I too threw it in the garbage. On the bright side, I stuck the remaining half of the pana cotta into my ice cream maker, and it made a nice milk chocolate ice cream. At least I didn't waste all of my fine chocolate. Did anyone from Bon Appitite test this recipe before putting it in print?

This cake was a flop! I had been in the kitchen for 12 hours making food for my Christmas party. This cake was a waist of time! The cake portion turned out well. Yes, it was real runny but dont worry, it will bake nicely. The filling on the other hand was a joke! It tasted just like chocolate pudding. Could have opened a jello box and saved time!. Instead of using a bowl w. ice, I stuck the filling mixture in the freexer for about 1.5 hours alwasy checking on it and stirring. It finally turned into pudding after adding more geletin- 2 Pks more. I place the pudding over the beautiful choc cakes and WHAT A MESS! The pudding ran over the sides. It was just gross all the way around! Thats why they suggests a choc band- because it looks like poop otherwise. So, needless to say- the cake tasted nasty! No one ate it- I didnt even want to eat it. I took a bite and spit it out! The panna cota filling really ruined the cake! Needless to say- all that hard work ended up in the trash!

I made the cake and froze it overnight. It then survived a four hour car drive and turned out perfectly for the party. Everyone loved it and now I'm a star cook!

The panna cotta was a little too "jiggly" for my taste. Maybe because it also took me over an hour to get it to gel. I liked that it was not overly sweet, but I have a better chocolate mousse recipe that I think would have worked better. It looked pretty, but the ribbon was hard to cut through without destroying the rest of the cake.

To mmryna, thanks! With all of my experiences in the kitchen, I still clearly have a lot to learn. I never thought that oil can spoil like you have asserted, but I am not surprised to hear it.

I made this cake for a Christmas party. I got rave reviews. I also had a hard time getting the panna cotta tto set up but with patience and enough ice it was fine. Since it had to go in the freezer any way I am thinking that instead of the band I might pour a ganache over it next time. The band was pretty, but hard to serve without totally destroying it. Some guests were hesitant to dig in.

Great taste, beautiful presentation. It took much longer for the chocolate band to set, almost 7 minutes. I used 9 inch pans and it still worked great, just some left over panna cotta-yum! Does anyone know if there are high quality baking chips available? The most time was spent chopping up the Scharffenberger bars. Other than that, so easy!

Beautiful presentation, and not all that hard to make! I made this for my Christmas party and it totally impressed my guests. For the people who had trouble with the panna cotta setting, I would suggest the biggest bowl you can find to put the ice and water bath into and lots of ice. I was a little nervous that I would have trouble with the chocolate band, but it turned out beautiful and really was suprisingly easy.

Well, after seeing the cake and photo I had to try this. While time consuming, the process is not at all difficult, and the presentation is excellent. However I was dissapointed with the flavor of the cake (Panna Cotta was great). The cake had a very heave vegatable oil taste to it which made me feel like I was eating cheap boxed-mix brownies. Following the recipe closely I could not understand the heavy oil taste which put a damper on my great looking cake! Any suggestions for what went wrong??

Everyone was impressed with this cake - one said it was the best thing she's ever tasted. My panna cotta took longer than the recipe said to set, and I also had more panna cotta than would fill the pan. Overall, it was time-consuming, but not difficult, and worth the results. Not for everyday occassions, although the easy chocolate bands could work with many desserts.

OK ... this was a lot of fun to make and the crowd at work loved it. I had a bit of a problem with the Panna Cotta though. After adding the gelatin and stirring in ice water for 1 1/2 hours it didn't set (as in pudding). I put it back on the heat and added 5 more tsp of gelatin. This time it set but by the time it was time to pour the second layer, it was like jello. Because it was like jello, when it was time to put the outer layer of chocolate on, it has nothing to stick to and when chilled it peeled off. It was still good and I will make it again. BTW I added some shaved white chocolate on the top for garnish.

Like a lot of the other reviewers this turned out GREAT! I served it for a Sunday family dinner and I prepared it over 2 days but the second day was the day it was served (lesson: read the entire recipe, including the last line before preparing). I used Ghiradelli chocolate and it turned out delicious and oh, so impressive to the guests. The chocolate bands were easier to prepare than I thought they would be. When making again I would save a little of the panna cotta and smear on both bands before adhering around the cake to help them "stick". I have already received requests to make this again.

This cake turned out so impressive. My guests were oohing and ahhing just looking at it. It was light, not too rich, but with great chocolate flavor.

The cake was delicious - springy and not too sweet. The panna cotta however turned out rubbery, thus prompting the family to dub it "the Rubber Cake". What went wrong?

I'm surprised by how easy this recipe turned out to be. I'm not an accomplished chef, but I wanted an elegant-looking dessert to take for Thanksgiving dinner. I only have one springform pan, so I baked half of the cake part and turned it out to cool while I baked the second half, which worked fine. I assembled the cake the day before, left it in the fridge overnight, and then finished with the chocolate strips in the morning. I was worried about wrapping the chocolate strips, but that wasn't difficult at all.

This recipe is a little time-consuming, but very, very easy. The resulting dessert is both beautiful and delicious (even my husband, who is not a chocolate fan, said it was very good), and I got rave reviews from my boys. Just make sure to use premium bittersweet chocolate - I used Guittard. My cake turned out just the way the cake looks in the magazine photo, even though I had used 9" springform pans. I can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving, and I really can't wait to present it at Thanksgiving dinner!
