Good easy soup with the addition of carrots, zucchini and a handful of spinach

This recipe exceeded my expectations. I stewed a whole chicken for the meat, and broth. I'm always looking for new uses for my smoked paprika, and this put it to good use. I used a jarred chunky salsa in place of the tomatoes, and Cholula chipotle sauce for the heat. I made 2/3 the recipe with 2 - 29oz. cans of hominy. One I pureed, and the 2nd I kept whole for the texture. Adding the suggested corn, and black beans would have made it more similar to a tortilla soup which I didn't want. Topped with tortilla strips, and avocado. Great soup for this cool fall weather

This recipe is missing something as-is. BUT it's an excellent and consistently reliable base, and wonderful for cleaning out your pantry. I did not puree my hominy, and added a can of creamed corn and a can of fully rinsed red beans (black beans would be great, too). I used less tomato sauce and fresh peppers instead of hot sauce. For traditional flair, top with fresh avocado and a dollop of sour cream. This is an absolutely wonderful soup and worth making again and again.

This recipe makes about 12 cups of soup and ha a great flavor. I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes and a can of mild green chilies but otherwise stayed true to the original recipe. I will definitely make it again.

Thanks for the additions...black beans, garlic, corn, chipolte chili, squeeze of lime and cooked it longer. I did leave some hominy whole.. I did Half recipe with a leftover grilled chix breast. Yummy on a cold nite. Even satisfying for my husband.

I have to agree with some of the earlier reviews. This soup is only ok...and that's AFTER you doctor it up with the addition of black beans, corn, and chipotles. Great for an easy weeknight dinner, but nothing special.

Excellent! Used canned chicken and only 1/2 of hot pepper sauce. Yummy!

Rating: 4
Superb. Blend 1/2 the can and leave the other 1/2 whole. Yum. I use fresh tomatoes when in season. Be sure to use smoked paprika and don't worry about the proportions...this is our staple soup and we just toss in the ingreds w/o measuring. Even w/o hot sauce its is great.

Have made this twice now in as many weeks. Will definitely be the go-to winter soup recipe. Delish!!! I purchased two large cans of hominy. Blended one, and added one whole. I use habanero flavored tabasco hot sauce - even cleared up my sisters post nasal drip! :)

Had no hominy taste which ruined it for me. It was easy to make. It just tasted like more tortilla soup and I'm tired of tortilla soup.

This is a pretty quick and AWESOME soup to make, but to make it a little better add some garlic (because it's good in everything) and a can of green chili (probably 2 if you make the whole recipe, I halved mine).

Love hominy and to find another recipe (other than menudo) was great. Substitute left over Thanksgiving turkey for the chicken. Gives it a different but still wonderful taste.

Rating: 4
Absolutely amazing flavor!! I only made about 1/2 recipe and it was alot...left a few kernals of hominy whole and added a can of mexican corn that I pureed first, left some whole pieces of that as well. Also sauteed minced jalapeno with the green onion just because I had them. I will make this again and again.

This is so quick, so easy and has great flavor! Might cut down the hot pepper sauce a tad if I had guests that I wasn't sure loved hot!

I have made this soup several times for family and friends, it is one of my favorites. I only use 2 cans of hominy. I like to add 1 can of black beans (drained) and 1 can of corn as well. Always top it with tortilla strips

Rating: 4
I highly recommend this soup. It is a family favorite and extremely easy. I only use 2 quarts of chic stock and 2 cans of hominy. I sometimes add a couple of links of cooked chorizo. When I have them, I add 1/2 can of chipotle chilis in adobo. I top with the tortilla chips, cilantro, avacado, and smoked cheddar cheese.

I don't know if my hominy was old, but this turned out like soupy grits. Is that the way it should be? Anyway,the taste was amazing and the texture started to grow on me after a while. I used a can of ro-tel tomatoes with lime and green chiles. Also added lime juice to the soup as others recommended. Boiled my own chicken and served with quesadillas. Will be trying it again.

Despite the fact that I had a run-in with the fire department because I turned away from the smoking oil for a minute, and despite the hominy juice all over my counter because I failed to properly close my food processor ... this soup ROCKS. I was a little suspicious (hominy? what the heck is hominy? Hot sauce in soup?), but I was SO put in my place, because this is the easiest, most flavorful, comfiest meal ever. It took only minutes to make, and is incredibly forgiving to lapses of grocery shopping (I pounded my whole cumin with a frying pan to grind it, and couldn't find smoked paprika at all) and heavy- handedness with super-hot sauce (Portland- made Aardvark really gives this a heck of a kick). Make this soup. Eat it all winter. Your friends and family will love you forever.

Added black beans and used one of the cans of hominy in the soup mixture, while pureeing the other 2. Upon completion, garnished with grated Cotija cheese, light sour cream, avocado and fresh lime juice. Amazing!!

Rating: 4
This was VERY easy and VERY delicious! I only added 8 cups of chicken stock, instead of the recommended 10, and simmered it for a little longer to reduce the soup and marry the flavors. I also added a little more of the cumin, paprika, and hot sauce, and some mexican oregano I had on hand. Top it off with some sour cream and sliced avocado and you have yourself quite a meal!

Rating: 4
Deeeeeelicious! Easy-slice the green onions, chop the cilantro, and pull the chicken off the bones-what could be simpler? I fixed the recipe as written, with the following changes: We like hearty soups so I used 2 chickens instead of 1, I added a can of black beans (rinsed), and about a cup of frozen corn. I cut the 4 tsp of hawt sauce to 2, but will use at least 3 tsp next time. I had a lot left over but froze it. Thanks to everyone for their comments-they always give me valuable information.

This is a stupid recipe-- The whole point of hominy soup is to see and enjoy the hominy, which is impossible if it's pureed.

Tasty!! Sure makes a lot, so be prepared to freeze some. Added about 1/4 c tomato paste, which added thickness to soup. Also recommend using 1/2 of hot sauce.

I'm a picky soup maker/eater and this one is delicious. I add a can of black beans and a can of corn to give it a bit more texture. I always serve with lime wedges as they really enhance the flavor. Sour cream and a little mexican cheese are good additions as well.

This soup was sooo yummy. The smokyness of the cumin and paprika made the broth wonderful. Also so easy it's ridiculous. This will be a new staple.

This soup was delicious, and so easy to make. The only thing I did different, was to add only 1/2 the hot pepper sauce the recipe called for. YUMMY!

The first time I made this, it was by default. I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. Who knew it would become a favorite? Love it made according the recipe. That being said, it tolerates embellishments well and I often add more of the solids to make it a stew. Tinkered with or not, it's a simple, inexpensive and delicious meal.

Absolutely delicious!! I shared this with my friends and family and they loved it too. I leave the hominy whole and add monterrey jack cheese, avocado and tortilla strips once plated. Even better the next day!

So simple and so delicious. I only puree two of the cans of hominy. I leave the last one whole. I added a small can of yellow corn kernels. It is so good the next day. I also add the avocado slices and crumble lime flavored tortilla chips over the top. YUM!

I made this on a cold day when we had a bout of sniffles . . . such a wonderful choice. Top with sour cream and avocado slices; warm (layer with moist papertowels and heat in microwave) and roll up flour tortillas to dip with . . . great.

This soup was so flavourful...which is a good change in the winter time. You can really taste the hominy, which I had never used before...The ingredients worked well together...have done it twice so far!

Great recipe, but it needed a little more flavor, maybe because my smoked paprika isn't the hot Spanish kind. I put in some extra cumin and maybe a teaspoon of Dave's Insanity Sauce. Zippy!

I can't find enough good things to say about this soup. I made it for the first time last night - mainly because I was too tired to REALLY cook - and it came out fantastic! I halved the recipe, since it was only for my husband and I, and it came out perfect. I think it was less than an hour from start to finish. It's quite rare to find a recipe that is this easy AND this delicious. I've already emailed it to a number of my friends. A definite keeper!

LOVED this soup from the minutes I started sauting the first ingredients. One by one each of my family members strolled into the kitchen, curious about the good smells coming from the stove. Also added a handful of shredded Mexican cheeses to just top the whole thing off! If it wasn't for the green onions and cilantro, this would be a GREAT emergency dinner. Even though there is hominy in it, I might consider adding a cup or so of frozen corn OR not puree'ing all of the hominy. GREAT comfort food!!!

Great versatile recipe. Easy, light, QUICK, with a lot of flavor. I used 8 cups of stock (2 boxes) and 2 cans hominy-I ran out of soup pot space. It makes A LOT. Topped with chopped celantro, avacodo, & crushed corn totilla chips - perfect! I forgot the sour cream. Next time I'll vary by adding some sliced chorizo. I recommend.

Not bad at all--and easy--but not quite flavorful enough. I added some menudo spices and a little extra chili. Next time I'll throw in one of my frozen roasted peppers.

I cut the recipe in half and used left over chicken from the Roasted Spanish chicken in the same issue, along with the drippings. It was really flavorful and makes alot. This is a much better lunch soup than dinner soup for a main course since it is pretty light. My husband and son said it did not have enough "body" for a dinner soup, which is how I served it.

Great recipe.Easy to make. Used 2 boneless, skinless breast halves simmered in lightly salted water for the chicken; cut in small cubes.Garnished with sliced avocado, grated Cacique cotija queso seco (mexican cheese) and thin cut corn tortillas lightly broiled in the oven. Delicious!!!

When I saw the ingredient of hominy, I knew this had to be a great soup and indeed it is. WOW, it's so easy to make and such wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and we really have enjoyed this soup during the week, since the weather is much colder now. Planning to make it again and freeze some too, now that our 70 degree weather has passed! ENJOY...GOD BLESS! PS...don't forget to add the chips and the sour cream.
