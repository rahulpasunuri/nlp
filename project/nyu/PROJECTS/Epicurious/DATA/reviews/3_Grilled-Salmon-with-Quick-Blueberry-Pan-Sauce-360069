I've made this many times with blueberries and with strained fresh blackberry juice (no seeds for me!). So, instead of cooking down the berries, I just pour in the juice with the already sauteed shallots/garlic and let it reduce for quite a while. Add the other ingreds, except water, and boom, YUM. Always great raves from guests.

This was wonderful! We have sockeye salmon 1-3 times a week so I'm always looking for a new recipe. Quality ingredients are definitely key, that said I made some changes: basil instead of thyme, a bit of sugar and fresh lemon juice in the sauce, and let it reduce for about 30 minutes. Husband didn't guess it was blueberries, takes on a smoky, earthier taste, very rich and layered flavours. Very delicious!

I haven't tried this recipe but given the awful reviews, I will stick with another great recipe on this site, Brown Sugar-Chipotle Salmon with Honey-Berry Glaze. I can't get enough of the glaze/sauce.

The combination of Blueberry sauce with Salmon sounds appetizing, but I cannot recommend it UNLESS you are somewhere where you can get extremely good salmon. For most of the US, this is not possible- and the salmon will lack enough flavor to stand up to the blueberry.

The blueberry sauce was AWFUL! I was hoping that it would be light and tart, but instead it was heavy and...just...gross.

Had to give it a try. It wan not bad but I probably won't make it again.

I wanted to give this a chance because berries and balsamic sounded so nice. However, it was weird, not exactly tasty, and required a lot of doctoring, the details of which I will spare you because I changed the sauce way too much for it even to be close to the same recipe. I do, however, think that this would be nice with port instead of the vinegar, which I will try next time.

I was dissappointed with this one. Blueberry pan sauce lacked flavor and could hardly taste the blueberries. Fish cooked nicely but with the sauce being so flat, I won't do it again.

As others said, I think the quality of ingredients makes the difference. I used wild salmon, organic blueberries, and 18 year old balsamic vinegar. It was fresh, light, and different.

This was one of the best salmon filets I've ever had. I cooked wild caught salmon on a cedar plank and topped it with extra sliced shallots. I also used dried thyme instead of fresh and skipped the mint. My blueberries were a little tart so I added a teaspoon of sugar at the end. The sauce doesn't taste overly "blueberry". It just has a nice sweetness and the thyme gives it a great earthiness. Slicing the shallots instead of dicing them also gives the sauce some texture so it contrasts well with the soft salmon. Served it with some steamed green beans and a crusty roll.

Really different and a great show-off kind of dish for company. The second time I made it, I reduced the sauce longer and used more blueberries ... It was better! Granted, not so quick anymore, but much more flavor.

The sauce was quite sweet without any added sweetener. I made the recipe as written. If you are looking for a new way to use blueberries and not in a dessert, this is terrific. It is a beautiful color and paired with the pink of salmon makes a lively presentation. This dish also is very good for you. I am definitely keeping this one.

I enjoyed this because of the tartness of the blueberries. It is not cloyingly sweet like many fruit sauces. After reading the reviews I added honey, but I will not do it again. It lost the tartness I enjoyed the first time I made it. I also like that it can be made ahead so it can be easily warmed while salmon is grilling for company. Next time I plan on a little squeeze of lemon. I think this would also be good on pork.

Okay let's be honest this recipe is all about the sauce. Now, I made the sauce to the letter, not impressive. The sauce is missing the balance of sweet to sour. I add honey like another reviewer did, which then improved the sauce considerably. It did work with the grilled salmon. Add your "sweetener" based on how sweet your blueberries are, allow the fruit to dictate.

Good ingredients are key. I found the sauce to be delightful and interesting. I cut the amount of mint to about half - personal preference - and added a touch of honey per some recommendations. Family loved it, would make again.

I have made this recipe as it looked so good on the picture, but only the picture is good as it lucked taste and flavour. I was really disappointed with it. I certainly would not recommend this recipe to anyone. N.

This dish was excellent! It probably had to do with the quality of the salmon we used, which was delicious, but I found the sauce just as wonderful. All the ingredients blended nicely, you could certainly taste each one, but we found none to be overpowering. I really like the combination of blueberries and balsalmic vinegar and will use this sauce in many other places.

As with any recipe, it's crucial to use the best quality ingredients in order to obtain the best results. I made the recipe using fresh, locally caught wild Alaska King salmon fillets, fresh local blueberries, and high quality aged Balsamic -- and it soared. The gastrique was not over powering, rather it provided a sweet-tart foil for the rich, buttery flavor of the salmon. This one is definitely a keeper! (@AKCuisine - "Alaska Food & Wine")

I was hesitant to try this based on the mixed reviews but I'm so glad I did! I think the key is to use an excellent quality aged balsamic - I used an 18 year old vinegar that is very sweet so none of that tart vinegary taste came through at all. SO good.

Wasn't impressed with the blueberry sauce. Maybe it was mixing the sweet blueberries with the savory thyme, garlic and shallots that didn't do it for me.

This recipe lets you get both your omega 3's and anti-oxidents in a very tasty combination. I'm not a fruit lover so I was happy that I could make a sauce of blue berries that worked wonderfully with the salmon. I could taste all of the ingrediants but yet they blended well and the sauce wasn't overly sweet but a perfect partner to the salmon.

Basically, this is a decent sauce. The salmon part is optional. I'm a poor student, so I opted for chicken thighs, which worked just fine. But the blueberry sauce needs tweaking. I agree with the cooks who found the balsamic overwhelming--next time I'll try it with red wine vinegar, instead. I ended up using 1.5 cups of blueberries--it needed more sweetness in the face of the balsamic bomb. I also put about a teaspoon of honey in there for the same reason. But I ended up with a tasty sauce, one that would also work as a super healthy salad dressing. I'll make it again, but mostly because it's blueberry season and I just can't get enough!

I was hesitant to try this recipe, based on the poor reviews. But, we tried it last night and were very pleasantly surprised! We used wild salmon filets (instead of steaks) and I omitted the mint. Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly. The balsamic vinegar in the sauce did not overwhelm our blueberries - the sauce was sweet & tangy, and we could really taste the blueberries, thyme, shallots, and vinegar together. It was a lovely complement to the salmon, and my husband and I will make it again.

After reading the poor reviews, I thought twice about making this recipe, but I went for it. The sauce was delicious, but I used wild caught salmon and I think it would have tasted better on farm raised. Definitely a good use for blueberries. Based on the reviews, I decided to eliminate the balsamic and substitute lemon to taste. Pan sauce was wonderful.

Very easy to make. August is a perfect time because the blueberries are large and sweet.

No forks. Where are the blueberries. Vinegar took over. What a waste. Form over function fails again. BA has to do better.

Not worth trying. I added a dash of honey to balance the acidity of the vinegar, but still this sauce didn't complement the salmon at all. I thought it was passable, but my family didn't like it at all. I'll be deleting this one from my recipe file.

There are so many great ways to prepare wild caught salmon. This is NOT one of them. The sauce is not at all interesting.

Although the recipe sounded interesting with great ingredients, it didn't make the A list with either me or my husband. I didn't feel the sauce added anything to my favorite fish.

Loved the sauce - so did everyone else! Used salmon fillet rather than steaks. Sauce is pretty easy to make and this time of year (July) blueberries are plentiful and inexpensive. Served w. rolls, grilled zucchini, and a blueberry / peach sangria.
