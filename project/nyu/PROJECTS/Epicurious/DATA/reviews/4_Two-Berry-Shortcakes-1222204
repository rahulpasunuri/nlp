This was the easiest/most delicious shortbread I've ever made. Guests raved about it. Instead of suggested berries just did strawberries.

A big hit and easy-to-prepare dessert! I will definitely make this again. I also used blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries.

Outstanding! By far the best biscuit recipe I have ever tasted!! I did the following adjustments... 1. Fage strawberry greek yogurt thinned with 3 ozs of creme that I scraped 1/2 of a vanilla bean seeds into first. 2. Used salted sweet cream butter but omitted the 1/4 tsp of salt. 3. Added a total of 3 tbs to the biscuits recipe. 4. pureed 1 cup of strawberries and 1 cup of blackberries with 2 tablespoons of honey then strained the sauce to remove the seeds. 5. Soaked the other half of the vanilla bean in the whipping cream overnight, scraped out the seeds then whipped the cream without any sugar. 6.Put raw sugar on top of the biscuits. Yum! Yum! Yum!

I've tried several times to make a decent biscuit and failed miserably...until now!! These shortcakes are amazing...and incredibly easy. I used strawberry yogurt instead of buttermilk and it turned out perfectly! The whole family raved about them. I also did an egg wash and some raw sugar on top before baking to give them a little crunch. I'm going to try them again as a savory shortcake with plain yogurt and some herbs. Great recipe!!

Great recipe! Easy, fast, and delicious. These are hearty enough to use with a lot of fruit.

Seemingly great recipe but I had major problems with the moisture when adding the buttermilk -- note: i had to use milk and vinegar as i had no buttermilk or yoghurt on hand -- but the liquid was almost double what i needed to create a nice sticky dough. After putting it all in I had to frantically add more flour to dry up the seeping liquid. Anyone else have this problem? I would advise to add the liquid SLOWLY until you have enough to create a sticky dough but not wayy too much liquid. I also added extra sugar. other than that... deelish!

An emphatic yes to the question of "wld u make it again". I'm not a baker but this was easy-easy and turned out really well!! I just had to keep saying to myself, "don't overwork it" and to stop as soon as the dough came together. Didn't change a thing, ingredient-wise for the biscuits. Berry mix was local s- berries, r-berries with CA blueberries. Husband and guests loved it!

Very good. very simple. I also often substitute yogurt for buttermilk. I made these with strawberry greek yogurt which was perfect (I was making strawberry shortcake, not the 2 berry version here).

Fabulous recipe! Followed some of the tips below and used yogurt (half plain and half vanilla) for the buttermilk. (But if you want to use buttermilk you can avoid the extra buttermilk problem by using Saco brand powdered buttermilk, which we use all the time for buttermilk waffles.) Also added a little extra sugar in the biscuits--sweetness was just right with 3 Tbsp instead of 2. Actually had these for breakfast instead of making scones to use up yogurt and cream I had on hand!

Loved, loved, loved these! So simple, not too sweet, a perfect ending to a meal. One major change: I don't use buttermilk in biscuits, because I found I was throwing it out afterwards. I SUBSTITUTE YOGHURT FOR THE BUTTERMILK! This is from Mark Bittman - a one on one substitution, and they're wonderful biscuits! Also threw in some blueberries because I had them on hand. Sometimes the simplest things are the best.

For our Father's Day gathering, I made this recipe as well as a traditional strawberry shortcake. I actually made this a Three-Berry Shortcake as I added blueberries as well. Everyone really loved the choice.

I used milk/vinegar since I wasn't sure what to do with three cups of leftover buttermilk (the store had only quarts). This is the shortcake I have been unsuccessfully trying to make for years -- wonderful! Any combination of berries will do as long as they are ripe and sweet.

Exceptional. I made it as stated. However I used buttermilk and whipped cream that I made from raw milk. I also used berries that I handpicked. This was my first time making buttermilk biscuits. It was so easy and this dish was so good that it gave me goosebumps. Definitely a keeper!!!

This was a wonderful, traditional shortcake. I liked the contrast between the sweetness of the berries and cream with the not sweet biscuits. I couldn't bear to mash such beautiful berries so I just sliced them and let them sit a while with a bit of sugar mixed in...there was plenty of juice. I think this would be wonderful with fresh peaches or plums and I'm going to try that as well. This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Shortcakes were crumbly on the outside, tender inside. First time, I made as written (and wished the biscuits were slightly more sweet), second time, I doubled the sugar in the biscuits and it was perfect!

Wonderful dessert. The shortcakes weren't sweet so it was just perfect with the strawberries & cream. I sometimes will soak the shortcakes in a bit of orange juice for a little variety. Enjoy!

Taly in Chile To make a substitue for buttermilk you can do any of the following: Combine one cup of milk (or soymilk) plus one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar, and allow to stand for ten minutes OR Combine one cup of milk plus two teaspoons cream of tartar, and allow to stand for ten minutes OR Combine two parts plain yogurt plus one part milk.

I am living in Chile and they don't sell buttermilk here. How can I substitute it, or how can I make it?

Quick, easy and not too sweet. I soaked the berries is a little chambord instead of adding sugar. It worked out very nice!! We ate 2 of the shortcakes for breakfast with jam the next morning. They were very good.

Great dessert for those who like it not-too-sweet (like me). Beautiful presentation. Easy too.
