I use more peas and the same amount of dill (fresh from the garden) and it's always a hit. I halve the recipe otherwise, though, because it takes up too much space in the fridge as written.

I made this for a Swedish Mid-summers party to take advantage of all my dill coming ripe this week and my Swedish friends said it was appropriately Swedish tasting, although they'd never had it. They should change the name to Swedish Pea, Ham and Potato Salad, as the peas are definitely the leading ingredient. This isn't really a potato salad at all. Very delicious and a nice summer side.

Good Salad, I substituted chopped sugar peas, including the hull, and halved the amount. Also, chick peas work well if you don't have black-eyed peas around. The salad was a little bit bland, but when we added a smidgeon of horseradish, it was much better. Also tried adding a half cup of sour cream. That was even better. I'd make again. It was a substantial and healthy meal.

Great New Year's Day salad to get the required black eyed peas. For my small household I halved the recipe but made the same amount of dressing and kept it on the side. It is not "exceptional" or "rave review" recipe, but it is delicious, satisfying, and it was gone quickly ... the extra dressing was delicious on a Salade Nicoise a few days later, and will become a house staple.

I have made this recipe about four times for different groups, and have received nothing but rave reviews, and people requesting the recipe! As with any recipe you can play around and adjust the amounts of certain ingredients. Too many green peas for me, but overall I LOVE this dish!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, and I have to say it was really bland. Normally I get rave reviews on recipes I serve but this one didn't even get noticed. Maybe I'm alone on this, but it was really embarassing to make something that WASN'T raved about. For the amount of effort this took, it just wasn't special. I might add more dijon or more vinegar or something to liven it up if I had to make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as written except that the amount of peas and dill seemed enormous so I only put in 1 package of the former and maybe 1/3 cup of the latter. I served it to my parents and in-laws and someone even spontaneously commented about the ridiculous amount of peas. That didn't bother me, but the dill did. Even after cutting it in half, I found it extremely overpowering. I could tell it would be excellent otherwise. I'm very surprised no one else mentioned it in the reviews. My family was polite but didn't eat much! I would probably make it again with a tablespoon or two of dill. Seriously.

I was suprised at how this recipe turned out, it was not what I was expecting. I thought it would have been more of a potato salad, but it is a colorfull mixture of all kinds of good stuff. It is AWESOME, It is healthy and very flavorfull. I do not give 4 forks unless it deserves it!

My family loves potato salad, BUT they all agreed that this salad was not only delicious but different in taste from the salad to which most people are accustomed. This salad definitely goes on our "favorite" list

This is great summer salad and easy to make. Using all fresh ingredients make the recipe so delicious.

Nice dish for a group. I found this to be too much dressing for the salad, so add in increments. I used one 16 oz. package of peas and felt I could have stretched this recipe further using another 1/2 lb. of potatoes. It needs Tabassco sauce too.

Made this as part of a Labor Day spread and it was enjoyed by all--excepting the children who eat nothing when one ingredient "touches" something else.

This is really a nice salad -- very colorful, a good contrast of textures, and a delicious dressing to bind it all together. It's definitely worth the effort to locate fresh dill for this one.

This is a wonderful salad. I brought it to an Oktoberfest party and it was a huge hit. The dill makes it so fresh tasting, and by using black forest ham in thick chunks gave it a hearty smoky flavor. The colors are gorgeous, too. An overall wonderful dish to present!!

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE. I HAVE MADE IT MANY TIMES AND ALWAYS GOTTEN COMPLIMENTS ON IT. SUBSTITUTE DIFFERENT MEATS, SHELLFISH,FRESH CORN OR ADD GRAPES.
