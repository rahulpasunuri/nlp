We served this cheesecake to our Thanksgiving guests, and we'll never go back to just pumpkin pie again. The cheesecake had a wonderful rich consistency, and the sauce was so good, people were pouring it on the chocolate cake someone bought. A new family favorite!

I made this recipe three times over the past few years. The first year, the whole thing fell on my foot as I was bringing it to the table.LOL. Last Thanksgiving it came out perfect and looked exactly like the picture. None of it was left and my family now requests that I make it every year. Great recipe!

Wonderful! There are so many things to say about this recipe. The crust was mushy for my taste, but guests loved it. The flavor was great! The cheesecake was a bit fluffier than I expected, but a denser cake would be too rich with the heavier flavor of pumpkin. I used 3 1/2 T bourbon in the sauce that was perfect. It made the sauce just spicy enough. I did not use a water bath. I baked the cheesecake at 245 for what seems like forever and let it cool in the oven with the door cracked. I will make this again but try a slightly different crust.

The cake was delicious but tended to melt at room temp. That said, there wasn't any leftover so it was definetly enjoyed by all. The sauce is absolutely amazing with or without the bourbon or pecans. I've made it without the cheesecake multiple times to go with other dishes and have jarred it as a Christmas gift.

This is an awesome recipe and totally worth the time. Smooth texture, creamy yet firm and the spices added a nice balance. A little hint for those of you have a problem with soggy cake when the water bath seeps. I never use a water bath, however I do put a pan of water in the oven. I have yet to have any issues doing it this way. Perfect everytime The only real adjustment I made to this recipe was the addition of 1 extra tablespoon of flour. The glaze is a must.

I am a pastry student and thought i'd offer some tips. I really liked this recipe, but was not completely blown away, I'm stingy with my forks rating. I made it again today for thanksgiving dinner. The sauce was REALLY good, I used all the bourbon, plus an extra splash for good measure mmmm. Make sure to add the toasted pecan halves into the caramel sauce imediately after boiling, it adds to the flavor of the sauce and the pecans, pull them out to garnish. I doubled the spices, this makes a huge difference. make sure the cream cheese, eggs and yogurt are at room temp. this will keep you getting lumps. If you have lumps, put it through a strainer instead of overmixing. make sure to use whole milk or greek yogurt, its thicker. don't bother with the water bath, its a waste of time, and you risk getting your cheesecake wet. bake the cheesecake low at 225-250 F until the center is firm-ish, but jiggles slightly(as one with the edge) this will take a while. if you see waves when it jiggles it is definitely not done.. turn off the oven, open the door and let cool inside the oven. If it cracks, the temperature was too high, or temp dropped too dramatically when taken out of oven. if it is too soft in the middle, was not cooked long enough. the crust was ok, it fell apart a little when cutting. maybe add some ground up gingersnaps. to help w/ stability.

I made this for a birthday at work and it was very well received. The bourbon sauce is truly delicious and so easy to make. I may have slightly overbaked it, but it was very forgiving and didn't crack. I didn't add the pecans to the sauce, because I wanted it to look exactly like the picture. I placed the pecans and drizzled the sauce over. It looked great.

It's embarrassing to admit this, but it's quite a testament to the sauce. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving of 2007 and just found a container of some extra sauce.

I don't even remember that much about the cheesecake, but the sauce is a keeper in every sense of the word.

I had high expectations after reading these rave reviews, so was a little disappointed when this came out tasting like a rich pumpkin pie. Followed recipe exactly, and It was good, but for the extra work in preparing a cheesecake (in comparison to an easy pumpkin pie!), it did't make me swoon like a good, creamy cheesecake can. The caramel sauce was outstanding, though, and really made the dessert.

I didn't eat any of the cheesecake, but my guests raved about it. The caramel-bourbon sauce is divine, either as a topping on most other pies or cakes or swirled into vanilla ice cream. I found that over-toasting the pecans really enhanced the caramel flavor and added more depth to the sauce.

This was my first cheesecake ever. The crust wasn't soggy. I think the key is to just make sure that your springform pan is watertight and if it isn't, wrap that baby in tons of foil (I agree with the commenter that suggested the extra large foil since the water bath will inevitable creep up). My tasters raved (on and on). I used equal parts pecans and ginger thins for the crust. I also pressed crushed ginger thins to the sides when it was all done. All in all, a perfect cheesecake.

There are nut allergies in my family, so all pecans were skipped & I made a gingersnap crust with the spiciest cookies I could find instead. I also used grated fresh ginger in the cake. I baked it in a springform pan inside another larger springform pan which was then inside the roasting pan in order to cut down on the complicated foil business. Perfect! Missed the pecans a bit in the sauce though...

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and everyone was very impressed. I do agree that the sauce makes a big difference. I think the pecans in the sauce don't add much and could be omitted since the cheesecake is already on the pecan crust. I did have problems with a slightly soggy crust and a slightly mushy middle, but I figured that I probably just didn't wrap the pan properly with the foil, and some water got in. Can anyone clarify whether you're suppose to leave the cheesecake in the oven or remove it while it's cooling in the water bath?

Made it twice- awesome both times. The sauce is excellent & can be used on other things as well (icecream, cakes etc). This recipe is easy to make, and you can substitute other nuts, or graham cracker for the crust. Same for the liquor (used rum once instead of bourbon). I used oven cooking bags instead of foil wrap for the water bath. Had to cook a bit longer than the recipe calls for. Guests raved about how great it was.

Very tasty--but it was way too much effort for the cheesecake. The sauce was good and we used the extra for post-holiday desserts. I guess I didn't read ahead for the water bath and that made it really complicated. I might make it again, but I'm more likely to go for something a little simpler.

Texture was good, ease of recipe is good, but I cant help feeling the caramel and wonderful crust would be better suited elsewhere- the pumpkin cheesecake seems to detract from a traditional pumpkin pie and leaves something to be desired as far as a cheesecake goes... why add the cholesterol, fat, and calories of a cheesecake if it detracts from both cheesecake and pie?

Being that I made this recipe in Canada for American Thanksgiving I had to make substitutions as I couldn't find pumpkin in my local supermarket and I didn't have any corn syrup or bourbon.

I really liked that I could have pumpkin and cheesecake (my two favorite things) in a single delicious treat. I also really liked the fact that this cheesecake was special but not too heavy for the end of a big dinner like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

My family thought I was pretty talented - but we know this one was easy!

For a non wet Pumpkin cheese cake, spead pumpkin an cookie sheet layered with 3 thickness of paper towels. Use another three thickness to blot the top removing water from the pumpkin.

If I were to make this cake again, I would not cook the crust for so long in the beginning. After adding the filling, the precooked crust became a little too burnt tasting. The filling was delicious, but a little flimsy. Next time I would add a tiny bit more flour for a firmer cake filling.

This came out great -- no complaints whatsoever about the crust burning, the cake cracking, or the general flavor of everything. The pecan crust and the pecan bourbon sauce itself are what really makes the cheesecake stand out. I could easily see the bourbon sauce being used as a topping for plain vanilla ice cream. My only hesitation in giving this four forks is that I think the flavoring on the cheesecake could've been torked up a bit (I have another pumpkin cheesecake I made from Cook's Magazine that, to me, had a little more "oomph", filling wise.)

What a great mix-up compared to normal pumpkin pie. Normally, I don't like pumpkin pie & quite a few of the family members also don't like to partake in a slice (the condensed milk gives them indigestion), but this was a really nice treat. It still tastes like pumpkin (since its one of the ingredients, hence 1-can of pumpkin), but the cream cheese really makes it velvety smooth & quite rich. We ended up cutting normal slices & then cutting those in half. The crust was heavenly, we skipped the bourbon addition & just added vanilla instead since we were serving to small children as well as adults. My MIL really enjoyed the caramel sauce. I'd have to agree with the other reviewers to cut the caramel sauce in half, otherwise you have too much leftover. It was a yummy treat & I will make it again next holiday, maybe even this x-mas.

This is a wonderful cheesecake and the sauce is out of this world. It would work great with a plain cheesecake. I thought the crust turned out too brown the first time so I made the crust over and left it in the oven for only ten minutes which was a great improvement. I didn't bother with the zest and just squeezed a teaspoon of lemon juice. Unfortunately my supermarket did not carry the "whole milk" yogurt, but I found it at a natural foods market.

This has definetively turned into my favorite pumpkin cheesecake. Its light and spicy, and the pecan crust is just delicious, great change from your regular graham and chocolate (beware the cooking time - mine was good and ready after 7 minutes). But the most excellent part of this dessert is the sauce... I have no words! Perfect combination of butter, pecans, and bourbon, makes for a rich and smooth sauce. I also recommend you don't pour it over the cheescake until it's being served. If there are any leftovers, pour over vanilla bean ice cream... great easy and delicious weekday dessert. Enjoy!

Wonderful. This is a lighter cheesecake than most - a good thing following Thanksgiving dinner. I love pumpkin pie, and this is even better. Great crust. Sauce is outstanding and should NOT be poured on cheesecake until served. If it gets thick after refrigerating, microwave for a minute. I followed directions exactly, but had to make the crust twice since after 12 minutes the first time, the crust was smoking. If you toast the pecans, no need to bake the crust more than 7 or 8 minutes.

THIS CAKE WAS THE LIFE OF THE PARTY! Wow...this is the first time I've made cheesecake and I couldn't be happier with this recipe. Maybe the person who commented on toasting the pecans over-toasted. I placed my pecans in a hot skillet and constantly stirred for only 2 minutes. The flavor, texture and presentation were wonderful! I made this cake for my husband's company party and I'm looking forward to making it for Thanksgiving. Regarding the sauce, I didn't place the entire mixture on the cake. I reserved approximately half to be poured over each piece that was cut just before serving.

Alot of work for the results. The sauce is what makes it taste good, otherwise the cheesecake was soggy. I did pour the sauce all over it and cut it before I poured the sauce. This may have added to the sogginess. I think the whipped like consistancy of the cheese cake was not appealing.

I had this at a party, made by one of the other guests. The pumpkin flavor is quite subtle but lovely. The sauce is what makes it though. The woman who made it garnished the top with pecans and had the sauce on the side, which made for a nice presentation on a buffet (no worries about the sauce soaking in too much while it sat) and allowed guests to choose how much to add. It really was delicious, and I would make it myself!

This was definitely a disappointment to me. I am a pumpkin lover, and have many great pumpkin recipes. Always looking for more, but this is not one. Although I'm an advocate of always toasting pecans before use, the pecans for the crust shouldn't be toasted beforehand, because toasting after making the crust, then cooking for more than an hour after assembly is waaay too much. The picture of this cheesecake showed the topping drizzled around the edges, but the recipe makes so much that I had the cake completely covered thickly, and had to put the whole thing into a larger pan because it was running off all sides. There was not nearly enough flavor. Very bland, although the sauce redeems it somewhat. I followed the recipe to the letter with no substitutions. The best thing I can say about it is that it was very pretty, and sliced well.

This cheesecake was mushy and had a lacked the great tastte I expected. Tried it on some company and none wanted to finish it. Noone in the crowd was overly picky either. Made the Brown Sugar Cheesecake with Bourbon Butterscoth Sauce which was much better.

I have made many of Gourmet's cheesecakes, and this one definately stands out. For those who do not want to waste the calories on pumpkin pie, this is the only alternative. I made a chocolate crust, which worked out beautifully. Leaveing the cake in the waterbath for that extra 30 mins with the oven off is the best tip anyone can get.

This is a good specialty cheesecake recipe. To the person who is worried about cracked cheesecake: Cheesecakes crack when they are overbaked and the internal temperature gets too high. You can avoid the problem by regularly checking the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer. When the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees, the cake is done. If the temperature exceeds 160, the cake will crack.

You can toaste the pecans in a 350 oven for 10-15 min just until you can smell the nuts. Remove from hot pan and cool. If you leave the nuts on the pan, they will continue to cook. As for the bourbon, you could omit, or substitute with 1 tbsp of vanilla, if the sauce is too thick, add a little water while cooking.

Here's a Quick way to do the pumkin...I cut off the top, scrape out the seeds... cut it up in chunks...put it in a pressure cooker...for about 11-15 minutes. Cool down...scoop off the meat of it into a pan...I use a hand blender...(less to clean up)...and, Wella!!!...pureed pumkin!!! I use it in everything...pies, breads, etc. I freeze it in zip bags of 2 cup measures..put on a cookie sheet...freeze...and, so Easy to pop one out for a recipe! And, sure tastes better too! If you can't get pumkin....try a butternut squash..pretty good too! Good luck!

To Swithey from Glasgow. About making pumpkin puree from scratch all you have to do is get a pie pumpkin, place it on a baking pan and bake the whole thing in the oven until it's soft enough to easily slide a knife through it. Then take it out of the oven, let it cool, pull the top off, remove the seeds and spoon the inside of the pumpkin into a food processor. Process it until it's smooth and that's it. It very simple.

can this be made ahead and frozen (say, to the point of making the sauce) - sounds nice for Christmas but too much work at such a busy time. And can anyone tell me how to make the pumpkin from scratch as I can't imagine finding tinned pumpkin in Scotland.

To Washington. The flour is needed to provide a solid enough consistency. I've used cornstarch or potato starch successfully in other similar situations. To the person worried about the cheesecake cracks: if it's made in a water bath and not overcooked, it won't crack. Cheers

I have not yet made this recipe but it sounds delicious. I have one question regarding the toasted pecans. Can I purchase them already roasted or will I need to do that and if I will be roasting them, could someone tell me how to do that? Thank you, :-)

Neufchatel is light cream cheese, you'll find it next to regular cream cheese. marscapone is a creamy white italian cheese, you should be able to find it in the dairy/deli area of a supermarket.

To Btrevino from Minneapolis: what are neufchatel and marsapone? Where can I buy them? I'm planning to make this for our company potluck.

I haven't made the cake yet but don't want to skew the ratings, so I'm putting in 3 forks! I have a question: can the 2 tbls of four be left out? I have a friend with a severe gluten allergy and am always looking for desserts to serve for her. Would something else need to be added in place of the flour?

exchange one cream cheese for neufchatel exchange yougurt for marsapone 3/4 sugar only warm 1 cup of honey with grated ginger and lemon zest...when cooled...add vanilla and double or triple amount use much less clove For the person with the craked cheese cake...buy an oven therometer...your oven is too hot. use a food processor... 5 forks

Can the bourbon be substituted....we don't keep alcohol in the house...or can it be made without that ingredient? thanks

This is OK--not outstanding. The sauce definitely makes it, the cake alone is pretty uninteresting. However, I did think that there was too much salt in the sauce. Although everyone liked it I wouldn't bother to make it again.

To the cook from D.C.; you leave the cheesecake in the same water bath in which it baked to cool in the oven (which has been turned off). I haven't yet made this, but because of the great reviews it will be on our Thanksgiving table.

I am a little worried about making this cheesecake because I cannot stand when cheesecakes crack. Any suggestions??

I made the recipe to take to my co-workers for a taste test before the annual Thanksgiving dinner with friends and they absolutely loved it. More than half said they didn't like pumpkin but loved the cheesecake! They said the taste was perfectly balanced and the sauce was deliciously sweet! This easy, tasty, recipe is a must this Thanksgiving.

Absolutely wonderful. I had 4 guests that didn't like pumpkin and yet they devoured this cake! It was easy to make and the SAUCE... it was SO GOOD, did NOT taste artificial at all, it was perfect.

This was easy to make and very delicious. A nice switch from the traditional pumpkin pie. The sauce was fantastic. Made this twice, one with a graham cracker crust for a neighbor with a nut allergy. The pecan crust adds a flavor that goes well with pumpkin.
