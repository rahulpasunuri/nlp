You must be kidding. This recipe, which I followed exactly (Kalamata olives, feta, etc). We threw literally all of it in the garbage. Dry, feta doesn't melt, not especially tasty . . . I just don't see the rave reviews this recipe has receive!

I found this to be very tasty first time around and as a leftover. The "sauce" is sufficient in quantity given (and I added some marinara with the leftovers). I used kalamatas and soaked (rejuvenated) sun-dried tomatoes (not in oil) and served this with grilled chicken breasts mixed together with brown rice. The chicken helped balance out the saltiness of the kalamative olives. The thing I like about this recipe is that you can play with it. I chopped up the eggplant as well (verses having them as steaks). It was even good cold (possibly as an appetizer with flatbread crackers) or could even use it as a pizza topping.

Pretty good...not as good as I expected after reading the reviews though. After I mixed the cheese, olives and tomatoes, it didn't seem like nearly enough to cover all the eggplant (as asked for in the recipe), so I added a little bit extra of each ingredient, but especially extra cheese, and I have to say, it was a mistake. While eating, I ended up scraping some of it off, because I felt that it overpowered the taste of the eggplant. Point being, you do not need to 'cover' the eggplant entirely, just a very thin layer is more than enough. I wouldn't make it again, but not because it was bad, just because there are better recipes out there.

Loved this; it was easy and delicious! Next time I may try grilling the eggplant because we love grilled vegetables - but it was great as written. We served it along with a simple garic, basil, tomato pasta and the whole meal was awesome! Enjoy!

This was so delicious and easy! I used three small eggplant straight from the garden and didn't bother with peeling or the salting process. I find it's not necessary with fresh baby eggplant. I increased the amount of cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and olives. I didn't think of this at the time, but next time I will use the oil from the dried tomatoes jar to brush the eggplant. Served on a bed of orzo. Will definitely make again.

This was sooo good. I used mozzarella cheese because I didn't have any goat cheese, and replaced the Kalamata olives with green olives. I also chopped some tomatoes and mixed it with the olives and sun-dried tomatoes. The taste was fresh and the olives combined with the fresh and sun-dried tomatoes made it tangy.

Wow Wow Wow! That about sums it up. I made a few alterations. After Broiling the eggplant I cut it in cubes then I mixed that in with greek green olives (I didn't have Kalamata), sun dried Tomato. In a very hot skillet I then did a very quick sautue just to get the flavors all mixed nice, to get the mixture hot for the cheese, and to flavor the pan for the next part. That mix went into a bowl with a very hearty Pecorino Romano cheese. I did not use basil or the goat cheese. Then if you have a Trader Joes in your area I HIHGLY recommend their premade yellow polenta it comes in a log. If not then make some basic polenta (super easy). I cut the log into slices and in a very Hot iron skillet I sauteed them till they got a little crust on both sides about 4-5 mins per side. I then topped the eggplant mix on the slices of polenta. It is heavenly. Would be a good side or appetizer although that was my full meal that night. AMAZING!

Loved this, and I'm not a big fan of eggplant. I left off the Pecorino Romano because I didn't want that much cheese and I didn't feel it was missing anything. I think this would also be good as a salad--just chop up the eggplant and mix all the ingredients with couscous or any other suitable starch.

I don't care for eggplant, however, this is a good recipe. I agree that the cheese topping needs to be doubled. I also was diligent in squeezing the water out of the raw eggplant and therefore, it wasn't mushy. I didn't have the basil and left it off. I think it would be better with this spice. I serve it with rotini pasta.

So simple for such an excellent flavor! I served it over parmesan orzo.

This recipe is pretty simple and yields a lot of flavor. I served it as the main dish but next time I think it would be best served atop a bed of risotto or small pasta. I wished the eggplant could have been less mushy, perhaps I did something wrong. Not sure. Tasted great though!

Excellent and simple recipe. However, I did make a couple of small changes. I added garlic to the cheese mixture. I also tripled the cheese mixture. The amount specified covered 3 slices of eggplant sufficiently. Definitely not enough. Wonderful recipe and I will make it again and again!

Oh. My. Gawd. This is the best eggplant recipe I have ever had! Easy and delicious. I used grated parmesean, but that was the only change. I loved the fact that the eggplant is not fried or breaded but it certainly does not need it. A wonderful blend of Medeterranian flavors. I will be making this regularly!
