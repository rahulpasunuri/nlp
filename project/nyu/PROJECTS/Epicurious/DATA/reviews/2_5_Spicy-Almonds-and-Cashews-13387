If my husband finds these first, our guests never get any! I use olive oil instead of butter, leave out the cayenne and double the other spices. Healthy indulgence!

Thanks for the reviews. I really enjoyed these but added a pinch of habanero, a tsp of chipotle and slightly more salt than the recipe. They were delicious and had the heat I was looking for to go with champagne. Very similar to how the Sonoma wineries serve them.

I've made these nuts for over 20 years and change them every time. Sometimes it's tough to get raw, unsalted nuts so if they've been roasted and salted, I omit the salt, melt everything over the stove, add the nuts and heat and coat, then cool. Last time I substituted pimenton for the paprika. Sometimes I use ancho chile powder. For new guests, I like the heat level here. For friends who like spicy foods, I up the heat.

Not nearly enough flavor or spice.

Made it at Thanksgiving as a side dish when I served appetizers....people liked it as it was a different addition to the menu. Easy to make but it did make my house smell unpleasant for a while from the cumin (my least favorite spice), so I let them cool off on my patio....They weren't spicy at all. Unique flavor.

This didn't turn out at all like I had hoped. There was virtually no flavor on the nuts. This recipe needs a lot more zing.

I followed the recipe exactly and toasted them in the oven for 5 minutes. It didn't come out right and so I left it in the oven for another 5 mins stirring once and it came out slightly burnt! I ended up didn't serving them because I didn't think it was flavorful enough. These were not as good as the "spiced pecans" recipe also from epicurious.com.

I thought these were delicious. I didn't find them to get soggy at all. I cooled them completely on the cookie sheet, and then sealed them in a ziplock baggy. A little more cayenne is nice.

Not quite hot enough for me! Add extra cumin and cayenne...

These taste great soon after they come out of the oven. Later, they get soggy.
