I love this recipe but must admit that I made several modifications when I first made it which I still follow: I make it with 2 cups of vanilla almond milk and 1-1/2 cup milk, use 1/8 cup agave syrup instead of the honey and sugar, reduce the orange peel to 3/4tsp, add 2T chopped pistachios and 1/2 tsp cardamom and have made it with dried cherries rather than cranberries. It is a beautiful color, presents well and everyone has enjoyed it.

Wow - way too sweet and especially way overpowered by the orange flavor. Why bother using something as subtle as persimmons at all if you are going to cover it up with something as strong as orange peel? I will try this again without the cranberries or the oranges, and with just sugar and no honey.

Having made the following modifications I was quite happy with this: Leave out the dried cranberries and orange zest, instead of using both honey and sugar just increase the sugar to 1/4 cup, and add vanilla and a pinch of cardamom at the end. I could still taste the persimmon in it and the creamy consistency was perfect. Also, even though the recipe suggests eating it warm or at room temperature, I think this is best served cold.

It tasted like fruit loops cereal... ICKY!!!

Quite good. There IS a fruit loop thing going on here, but this makes a good consistency, liquid (not completely thick) rice pudding. The cranberries add texture. Nothing amazing but this has a neat different flavour! Don't make this if you want a bland pudding (which rice pudding often is).

I am a Peace Corps Volunteer in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where in late October to early December persimmons are available by the truck load. I tried the pudding for a Thanksgiving get together--made a double batch,using metric measurements. I had too much liquid, otherwise it was delicious. I brought home only two of the 16 servings.

I liked this a lot. I added cinammon and vanilla to the recipe. I actually tasted the pudding right before adding the persimmon puree, and it was delicious. You could simply omit the persimmion, or reduce the amount of it, and that would probably reduce the flavoring issues mentioned by other reviewers.

This was really easy to make and contrary to prior reviewers, I liked this a lot. I did add some cinammon and vanilla to the pudding for extra flavor. The use of arborio rice made it very creamy and was an excellent base. I actually tasted the pudding before adding the persimmon, and it was great. You could omit the persimmon puree or reduce it to minimize the flavor issues mentioned by the other reviewers.

The base recipe could use a tweaking... Prior to the persimmon/cranberry stir-in, the base has a funky "fruit loops" taste to it. I would recommend subtracting the orange peel, and instead using cinnamon, cardamom and a bit of ground vanilla bean.

I was really excited about this recipe when I saw it. I love a good persimmon dessert! However I made the recipe exactly as described and found it to be very lack-luster to say the least. First the orange flavor was very over powering and in fact totally olibterated any persimmon flavor at all (not that orange is bad-just not what I was looking for). The moisture content of the recipe was not sufficient to completely cook the arborio rice. I cooked it for about an hour and still there were some grains of rice that were not completely done. The overall consistancy was correct but the finish was harsh (probably the orange). The recipe should be called "orange cranberry rice pudding"
