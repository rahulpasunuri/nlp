I made these very carefully after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, they were disappointing. They were difficult to work with and only average tasting. I am an experienced baker, and this dough was too crumbly to work with. Almost like an ingredient was missing. I did find a much better version on the internet. Will not make this again.

Not sure what I did wrong here, but my total yield was 29 cookies assembled. Also, the actual cookies were more wafer-like and less ball-shaped. (I could have had the butter too soft in this case.) Instead of chocolate, I filled the cookies with Nutella and they still tasted delicious and no one knew the wiser (except for me, of course). I think that I will hunt around for a better recipe.

These cookies are SUPERB but they really take up a lot of time. But they're definitely worth it. The only changes I made were substituting lemon zest with orange zest and baking them at 325 for 10 min. Definitely worth the efforts. My dad called them the best cookies he has ever had. And be sure to use Lindt 70% dark chocolate - they elevate the cookies to a whole new level.

I put the rolled dough into the freezer for a few minutes before baking and that helped them hold their shape.

These were OK. I was hoping they would have a lot more hazelnut flavor and was disappointed. They were a lot of work - all those marble-sized dough balls. It was hard to balance the rounded side so the melted chocolate could be applied. I eventually gave up, and just dipped half in the chocolate and set on waxed paper. I wouldn't make them again.

I agree that these are delicious but also had the flat problem. Made again with the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and they turned out just like the picture with no noticeable change in texture. I'll try cutting down the flour a tiny bit next time, as the dough was more crumbly and a bit more difficult to shape with the baking powder

I absolutely love these cookies, and so does anyone I feed them too. The secret to keeping them from getting flat is the "stirring until just incorporated (do not overwork)" bit--if you overwork the dough they just melt and die in the oven, although they taste almost the same, just with not as good texture.

I have to say, the flat batches are frustrating - I'm working that out now - trying everything I can think of - I can't imagine that the recipe should be THIS difficult to follow for so many or that the recipe as posted would give results as shown in the photo. It's not rocket science, after all; and having graduated from a professional baking/pastry course, I have to say, this has become something of a mission now. I WILL figure this out. I also have to say, I'm making these very small - so that when baked, together they would be about the size of a walnut. Unless the rolled-up size should be about 1/8".....I'll make it again only because I really feel like I NEED to figure this out.

I made about five different batches of baci di damas. I would add about 1/2 cup more flour and 1/4 tsp of baking powder. My first few batches were very flat. The more flour I added the better. So I definitly would add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of flour. And you can melt the chocolate in the microwave. Also make sure it is confectioners sugar, not regular sugar. I had a different recipe for baci di damas, and it said "sugar" not confectioners sugar. But they did turn out, and I would make them again.

didn't rate.. but about the non-puffing.. shouldn't there be some leavening? picture shows them distinctly puffed with cracks like you would get with oven spring...

These are a lot of work but well worth the time. The smaller they are the puffier they get! Great gift!

I enjoyed the cookies, but they came out flat for me too. THey are just nit as cute flat. I also, wonder if they are light and fluffier if they stay puffy.

I thought these were very dry; they didn't seem worth the time and effort, not to mention the ingredients.

these are amazing little cookies. i agree w/ the previous reviewer, err on the small side. i will definitely add this to my list of staples

I think I made the cookies too big (err on small rather than big) -- they should be small enough you could just pop 'em in your mouth, or dip in your espresso. Yum, yum!

I saw the adorable picture and the description and i just couldn't resist. As cute and simple it was to make (though slightly time consuming, considering the small amount that it makes), it wasn't really worth it. The flavor was all right straight out of the oven but seemed to fade on cooling down. A bit too dry (considering the amount of butter used), it reminded me of a not so good shortbread cookie. The hazelnut flavor was not pronounced at all, and I even shelled and toasted my own. Overall, it wasn't worth the ingredients or my time.
