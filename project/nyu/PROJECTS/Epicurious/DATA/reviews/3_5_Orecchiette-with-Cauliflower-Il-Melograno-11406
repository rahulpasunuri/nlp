So easy and yummy - even for kids! I roasted the cauliflower and thought it was a great change.

Thank goodness I followed the other reviewers suggestions and roasted the cauliflower and broccoli. It really added flavor. I also used some of the bacon fat for the bread crumbs which gave it more flavor. It would have been flat if you followed the recipe exactly. It also needed the olive oil at the end for liquid.

So of course, in the grand tradition of Epicurious, I have altered this recipe...AND THEN REVIEWED IT!!! Just wanted to be upfront about that. I took the advice of a couple other reviewers and roasted the cauliflower with some garlic & olive oil (Hey, the white cruciferous veg is a HARD SELL in my house) also I used maybe twice as many breadcrumbs, which I sautéed, on the advice of another viewer, in the bacon fat. (You can't sell cauliflower in my house without smoked pig) Tossed roasted veg, with breadcrumbs, bacon, some parmesan and some more olive oil, tossed some more parm over same. Result? Pretty damn good!

YUM! If you have time-roast the cauliflower; it adds more flavor.

A typically Italian dish, simple and not too fussy. I don't think my vegetables were very fresh, so this came out nice, but not great. I too couldn't find any green cauliflower, so mixed half broccoli and half cauliflower. I'd certainly give it another try though.

I've read the reviews and don't intend to change up ingredients other than the fact that I've roasted my cauliflower first with some olive oil and kosher salt. I find this gives such a beautiful nutty, buttery flavour to the cauliflower and mellows the taste for my little guys. We like our garlic here so more is definately better...oh, and I've substitued penne cause that's what I have here and it will catch the sauce almost as well. Must agree with the reviewer who stated that changing up ingredients and then reviewing the recipe is ridiculous (smart person)...experience will tell you to leave well enough alone the FIRST time and then "have at 'er". Everyone's palate is different

Great melding of flavors. Easy way to get a one-dish, well-rounded meal (though not low fat, if you care!). Like other reviewer(s), I cooked the bacon first, then sauteed coarse breadcrumbs in the bacon fat. We actually thought the breadcrumbs MADE the dish-- perfect, smoky & crisp topping! All ages in our home said this was a keeper.

Easy and delicious. I used broccoflower and broccoli and both were soft yet firm and super tasty. I tried the recipe with and without the breadcrumbs and didn't feel they added much. Next time I'll skip them. My toddler loved this.

Outstanding recipe. I've made it twice, once with orecchiette and once with farfalle and both were excellent. I cut back the pasta, though, to 1/2 pound - I think 3/4 pound is too much starch in relation to the other ingredients and may be why some other reviewers considered the recipe too dry.

This dish was not only delicious but also very quick and easy to make. I always read reviews before making a dish and I found it quite telling that the person that did not use bacon and cut back on the oil found it "dry". Hmmm. In any case, I used purple cauliflower instead of green b/c that is what was in my CSA share. Also, I subbed veg sausage for bacon. The end result was both beautiful and tasty though I did need to add extra salt to compensate for no bacon. This is definitely a keeper!

I'm giving four forks because this is such a great use of green cauliflower! I reduced the amount of bacon, added a little italian sausage, used whole wheat cracker crumbs browned in a bit of butter instead of breadcrumbs. Was a huge hit with my 4 year old and one year old. A little dry though...

Surprisingly yummy. I was worried about it being a bit dry, so I added a small amount of heavy cream, which helped a lot. It was indeed a nice fall dinner.

This dish was great. I used 1/2 cauliflower and 1/2 broccoli and it ws fast and easy. Served it as a side dish with meat leaf and homemade bread...my 12 year old son and his buddy ate seconds...good way to eat those veggies.

This was a good way to use a lot of leftover cauliflower. I used sausage instead of bacon. Could have used a bit more garlic, and perhaps it was the sausage I used, but a bit more oil, too. All in all, though, quick and tasty.

A hit! Easy, delicious and satisfying on a cold autumn night. This is a keeper!

Tasty peasant food! Yum!

This is a tasty, simple, comfort-food type of dish. I had intended to make it exactly as written, but near the end I realized I didn't have any parmesan on hand, but I did have ricotta. I know it changed the overall texture and taste of the dish, but it was a tasty substitution, and gave the dish a bit of creaminess. Good fall/winter dish.

This was really good & I will definitely be making it again.

This is one of my and my husband's favorite dishes. We make it with lots of home-grown garlic, and sometimes eliminate the bacon. Like a previous reviewer I brown extra breadcrumbs to use with other pasta dishes. Now that I'm on a low-carb diet, I reduce the amount of pasta and load up on the cauliflower. This is just so tasty, I don't miss the pasta.

Wow! My husband ate his first serving so fast I hadn't even sat down. This was good. I drained off a lot of the bacon fat but should have left more to brown the vegetables and for flavor. The bread crumbs added crunch. Usually cauliflower makes me gag but this I will make again.

The whole family (including children under 6) loved this dish. Low cal it ain't, but it is very good and I would highly recommend it.

I make this recipe often. It's one of my husband's favorite. I make a big batch of toasted bread crumbs to use another time with spaghetti with marinara sauce or oil and garlic. I wouldn't make any changes to this recipe. It's terrific as is, and rates 4 stars from my authentic Italian husband!

This is a staple Italian dish. I have to agree with the Cook from New York, if you make changes, prepare to be disappointed. I often wonder how anyone can rate a recipe if they've changed the character of the dish by making changes. Try this just as it is, I think you'll be surprised at it's terrific flavor Simplicity is what Italian cooking is all about. Freshness is a must. Substituting pancetta for the bacon will not give you the smoky flavor that bacon imparts to this dish. The addition of adding olive oil with the pasta will moisten this dish considerably. Bon Appetit.

This dish, which I've made many, many times since 1996, is so delicious I felt I had to contribute my own personal comments to the site. I think the recipe is sort of like that elegant, but simple, black dress with pearls that people keep talking about. Leave something out or overdo it with unnecessary changes and you've spoiled the whole effect. My advice for those readers trying this recipe for the first time is to try it without any alterations. The bread crumbs and Parmesan are wonderful and add to the whole effect. The vegetable combination is terrific. The second time you try it, make your changes if you will. For my family, I don't change a thing.

Interesting, but not enough to make again. I have to admit I made some changes to the recipe to make it more compelling, and worth trying at least this once. I used half broccoli rabe (which I much prefer to broccoli) and half cauliflower. I used pancetta instead of regular bacon, cause that's what they have at the gourmet deli around the corner. I also reduced the amount of oil (by 1.5 T) that I added to the pasta at the end because it just seemed like too much added fat at that point. I also threw in a handful of split grape tomatoes for color and to add a bit of moisture. Still, "it seems a little dry," my husband said as he ate this. My 6-year-old son, Max, found the scent of the dish unpleasant, but this is his reaction to most new recipes, "as well as old ones," my husband notes.

This is a staple dinner at my house. I also make it with broccoli instead of cauliflower, substituting the bacon for sauteed walnuts. So easy and delicious!

My mom makes this with baby broccoli and it is also terrific.

When I started this dish I was not sure if it would be any good, but my daughter was coming to dinner and she is not a big meat eater, but loves pasta. The outcome, to my suprise, was delicious, not only did my daughter think it was great, but my wife and I agreed.
