Delicious! I only brined for 24 hours but the chops were incredibly moist. This is a great way to duo thick hops. I was a little skeptical that the rub would burn on the grill but it was perfect. Note, I used a 80% red curry powder in the rub as I ran out of cumin. Fantastic.

This is delicious. Everytime I make it, my guests cannot stop complimenting the dish, or eating it for that matter! Highly recommended.

I've made this in the oven 3 times, twice with thick boneless chops and once with bone-in. Very tasty. Ina Garten says you should only cook pork to 138, so I usually split the difference and cook it to 145. My chops have never baked in 20 minutes; they have always taken closer to 40-50 minutes.

I couldn't believe that lean pork chops could come off the grill so moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with the results. I'm looking forward to my lunch of leftovers!

This is a pork chop recipe that we have now used for 10 years. It is a keeper and one that we love to have again and again.

I was a bit worried when making the brine it had a very funky smell-but I'm glad that I pressed on, and followed the recipe, the pork chops turned out great and everyone raved. I used a coarse sea salt and didn't have any trouble with saltiness. The only thing I would change next time is a bit more cayenne. Very moist and delicious, mild enough to please even picky eaters.

Took me a while to get this to work for me. Loved the falvor, but don't have an outdoor grill and needed for it to work indoors in a gas oven. Wanted a recipe that served two or four, not 6 or 12. Also needed for brine to work more quickly since I often don't know the night before what I'm going to make for dinner that night. Here's what worked (and didn't) for me. First, the brine. Three cups water, 1/2 cup Kosher salt (or 1/4 cup table salt), 1/2 cup sugar, and the rest of the brine ingredients as they are for 12. Marinate anywhere from 1 to 8 hours. Yes, even 1 hour can make a difference. Cooking: Didn't like the original baking option. I want carmelized edges on my pork chops. Baking didn't give it to me. Neither did an attempt at sauteeing. Finally got what I wanted when I broiled them. Rub ingredients were 1 tablespoon brown sugar per chop, 1/3 generous teaspoon cumin per chop, and (I like spicy, real spicy!) a bit less than 1/8 teaspoon cayenne per chop. Preheat broiler, set rack on the lowest level, spread top of chops with 1/2 the rub, broil 6 minutes, turn and spread chops with remaining rub, and broil six minutes more. Now that I've got it the way I want it, it will be on regular rotation for me. Terrific flavor from the get go, just needed to tweak it to satisfy my preferences.

This could have potentially been a 4 fork recipe - if only I had remembered to make and add the rub! We took straight from brine, dryed meat, and put on the grill, and chops were good. They would have probably been great had we added the rub!

I cut the salt in half and marinated the chops for a little over a day and a half and both my husband and I found them too salty.

Very good & flavorful. The brown sugar practically carmelizes on the grill which gives the pork a crispy, sweet crust. Very moist inside. A little salty - and we excluded the salt from the rub. Next time I'll reduce the salt in the brine as well. Despite the list of ingredients this is very simple.

This is, quite possibly, the best recipe for grilled pork chops that I've come across. Because I wasn't paying attention, I ended up adding more water than the brine recipe called for but I think it still turned out well. I VERY LIGHTLY salted the chops before putting on the rub as I was unsure of how salty the brine would make the them. Served them will grilled asparagus and baked potatoes (didn't have any rice in the house, a staple in Hawaii (gasp!))I will definitely make this again and again, it was so good.

MMMMMM... Pork. Tender and delicious. Will definitely make these again.

This brine and spice rub are also good on pork tenderloins (brined two days, as the recipe suggests for chops). I've made it part of my regular weekday meal rotation.

Found this recipe at work and made it when I got home. Hence, only had about 30 minutes to brine. At first, when I made the spice rub, the cumin made it smell "funny" and I began to doubt the recipe. But just thought I'd continue (due to all the great reviews) and see how it would turn out. It was really good! Good amount of flavoring. I'm sure if I brined longer, meat would be a little less dry (although it was still pretty moist/good). Used the oven and it turned out well.

I made this tonight, with merely 1 1/2 hours to brine and cook and serve, and they turned out well. I rinsed the chops and patted them dry, to take care of residual salt and then grilled them to 155. They were juicy and flavorful. I'd recommend this short cut version to any other cooks who don't plan that far in advance!

I have tried other brines with mixed results but this one was great. I only brined for 6-7 hours and the chops were moist and flavorful. Also only had ground allspice and thyme -seemed to be no problem. Made the rub as written and did not find it too salty. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
Absolutely outstanding. I only had four hours in the brine, but it worked great. The chops were more like 2", so they took longer to cook, but that was fine -- the internal temperature was the right thing to go by. I also substituted fresh sage for dried thyme ('cause I had it around, and sage is always good with pork.) Anyhow, this is a keeper.

The meat was very tender and moist, but too salty. I did not add salt to the rub. It just overpowered the other flavors. I would suggest only brining for only 24 hrs. Then it would probably be amazing.

Both my husband and I have always remembered pork chops being overcooked and bland. I was determined to find a recipe that provides great flavor with tender results. My husband thinks these are the best chops he's ever had!! The recipe is WONDERFUL! DON'T OVERCOOK--we also use a BIG GREEN EGG (smoker) for all our grilling--AND brine the chops for 2 days before grilling.

Yummy! I did cut back the kosher salt for the brine. Used less than 1/2 of what the recipe called for also did not salt the chops after drying them just sprinkled some ground pepper and only added a pinch of kosher salt to the spice mixture. Were not salty at all. Very tender and moist chops.

I had 1" thick pork chops on hand, so I brined them for just a few hours - plenty of time for that thickness. They were rich, juicy, sweet, and full of flavor. The rub had a bit of a kick but was not too spicy for the kids. Probably the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried. I did not have a problem with the saltiness, but I also did not add any salt before the rub.

I had to leave town unexpectedly after two days of brining. After the third day my husband had to grill the chops, but he didn't know about the rub. They were just as spectacular without the rub.

I thought this dish was too salty, but I put the salt in the rub. I also ended up brining the meat for 3 days instead of 2. Both of those things contributed to the saltiness. I'm going to try the recipe again, without adding the salt to the rub. Other than the saltiness, the flavor was good, and the meat was tender.

I have made this twice now and they are awesome for entertaining! My guests did not stop raving! I will never stop making this one! I followed the advise of other reviews and did not add salt to the rub mixture. I served this with marinated grilled vegetables and twice baked potatoes. This can all be prepared a day or two in advanced which makes for an easy party day for you the cook!

I was very disappointed with this recipe, especially after reading all the "good" reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was just so-so. Nothing special. I've had pork chops BBQ'd without all the preparation needed for this recipe and they tasted better than this one. I might try it one more time because everyone rated it so high - just incase I missed something. Guests who ate it said it was just "okay".

The best. Do not add more salt. Patting the chops totally dry is critical to making the rub adhere properly. Have used the brine recipe on pork roasts as well.

This recipe has become a summertime favorite. I've made them about 6 times now and they never fail to be the hit of the party. I do not add any more salt to them after brining.

Excellent. Served to a party of 30. Best chops ever. Not too salty - but I was careful not to add more salt after the chops were marinated in the brine. Patting them dry was key as well. Served them with red pepper and onion chow-chow made with sugar and cumin. Big hit.

These Chops were very good and all enjoyed the meal. The only thing I would change is the amount of cumin that the rub calls for. I would cut the amount by half to lighten up the taste. This one is a keeper !

Easy entertaining! Serve with spanish or dirty rice and "Corn and Bell Pepper Salad" (B.A. July 1990). My own tips: I use 1/3 cup of kosher salt in the brine instead of 1/2 cup (otherwise, the chops are too salty). I also skip the step of seasoning the chops with salt and pepper before rubbing in the spice rub -- instead, I add some fresh ground black pepper to the spice rub mixture. I make double the spice rub mixture (or at least 1 1/2 times the recipe). Be sure to drain and pat dry the chops real well and rub in the spice rub just before grilling, otherwise, the sugar in the rub becomes runny. Add mesquite chips to the coals for more of a smoky flavor. The chops improve with age and taste even better the next day if you can wait that long! Enjoy!

Using brine was new for me, but I found that it tenderized and flavored the meat in a really nice way. I substituted a few dried powdered and crushed spices and would not recommend that. I'd make it again and recommmend it to anyone with a descerning pallete.
