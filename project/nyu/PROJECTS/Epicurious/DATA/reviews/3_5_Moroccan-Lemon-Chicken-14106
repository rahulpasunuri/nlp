So it is in the oven now - I took the whole bird approach, but separated took the leg quarters and left the breast whole and followed the lead of rubbing the spices, honey and oil on the bird. I am thinking, next time, as I can tell by the smell there will be a next time, going with whole lemons in the breast cavity and saving some time. I threw in some garlic (there must be garlic - whole cloves). And people, almost a rookie mistake - tent your bird if applying honey as a rub! I have a box of frozen artichokes that will enter the scene about 20 mins before the end. What kid of green olives did folks use? I think black would have been better.....

Like others, I used cubes of boneless skinless chicken breast. But, other than that, I made as directed. I was skeptical as I was preparing this. The sauce was very thin and the colors of the dish (khaki green olives and drab brown sauce) waa not appealing. But it tasted much better than it looked! In the future, I would increase the amount of paprika and, for a thicker sauce I would use a little more flour and a little less chicken broth. I might add 1/8 tsp. cayenne too.

Made this for a dinner party and browned the chicken and cooked the sauce in a saucepan but then put it in a tagine and cooked it for an hour. The meat was incredible tender. But unfortunately didn't read the other posts before making it! I thought it could have used a bit more punch. And will try some of the recommendations next time.

Delicious. My kids even ate it. I substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in chunks (it was all I had), then added later so as not to overcook. I tossed in about a 1/2 c. white wine too. Great weeknight and pantry dish.

I made this last night for a small dinner party of 5 people who all loved it. I used bone-in chicken thighs, squeezed the juice of 2 of the lemons into the chicken broth (mind you I tripled the recipe) and as suggested by other reviewers, upped the amount of spices, adding 3 garlic cloves to the onion, and ground ginger and a bit of cayenne to the spice mix. I also did the whole thing in a Dutch oven, so after browning the thighs, then removing them to make the sauce, I put the thighs back in and stuck the covered pot into the oven for an hour (pre-heated to175°C then 150°C for the last 30 min). The meat fell off the bone and there was plenty of sauce (also as suggested by other reviewers, I left out the flour). Very easy to make and delicious result! Served it with couscous dotted with yellow raisins. Lots of sauce leftover but no chicken!! (I made 6 thighs for 5 people...)

This was good and will make again. Didn't have olives and wondering if flavour was missed so will include next time. Love cumin so used lots and added garam marsala and garlic. I also added juice of the lemon I zested, very surprised the receipe does not call for this because I tasted before and after adding the juice and definately preferred with.

I made it with a raw carrot and couscous salad. I added sliced red bell peppers and garlic and sauteed them with the onions. I would add more flour to thicken the sauce. Overall, it was a great and different recipe. Very easy to make for company.

A delicious & EZ recipe + the aroma was a cozy smell on a snowy, winter day. I would have liked more sauce & seasonings, so I plan to double all ingredients except for the chicken next time. For ease of prep, I used pre-cooked, boneless, skinless chicken breast pieces & served over plain, short- grain brown rice. The final word on this? YUMMY!

Great. I used chicken breasts, cut into about thirds and added more lemon and some red peppers in the last part with the chickpeas. And more chickpeas. And tripled the recipe, which gave about 8 very good servings. Great if made ahead of time, or the day before.

i know people generally make some changes to these recipes, and that's the kind of review i love to read, soo... I used a whole chicken split, put it in a roasting pan with the chicken stock, lemon juice and onions, then mixed the spices with honey and olive oil and dried cilantro and rubbed in and out of the chicken, and cooked at 375 - 400 for about 1.25 hours. THen i took the chicken out, put all the juices in a sauce pan, added the corn starch (it was closer than flour) and the garbanzo beans and brought that to a boil. If i woudl have had fresh cilantro i would have put that on, but i did throw some sliced black olives on top. VERY VERY GOOD. i used the boxed riced pilaf with almonds and added some golden raisins. Everyone loved it, incl. 8 & 6 yr olds.

Just made this for our gourmet club and loved it. Used boneless and added small amount of cayenne, 2 tsp fresh chop ginger & 3 cloves garlic. Wish I added currants and lemon juice to raise the flavor. Just browned the chicken and let it cook/simmer the rest of the way. It was fork tender and juicey. The sauce did need more thickening. Made the Ksra bread with it...Yum! Can't imagine making this without the salty tang of the green olives. I usually don't like olives at all but this dish was wonderful and really benefited from them. Served with cous cous in acorn squash. Great meal.

YUM! Looking for something different and this was wonderful. Used jarred olives and breasts with bone they were just fine. Will definitely make this again and recommend this to others!

This recipe packs in a lot of flavor and is just delicious! It made the kitchen smell wonderful. I took a few suggestions from other reviews including using boneless skinless chicken breasts, and the addition of garlic and cayenne. I used cannellini beans since those were on hand and I prefer the less mealy texture. I added Garam Masala as well as coriander seed to the sauce for extra interest, plus squeezed in lemon juice right at the end. I did not include the olives and think the dish did not suffer for it one bit. The rice was so marvelous - I substituted brown rice for more fiber.

To make this more kid friendly I cut up boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1 inch pieces and being an olive lover, increased the sliced olives to 1/2 a cup. As suggested by other reviewers I threw in a tablespoon of currants to the sauce to get a nice blend of sweet and savory flavors. Since cumin tends to overwhelm other flavors, I cut it down to 1/2 a teaspoon and increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Lastly, I added a tablespoon of lemon juice. This dish gives off such a wonderful, exotic aroma while cooking!!!!!! The best part: After staring at if for awhile and asking a billion questions my two kids actually ate it and declared it 'YUMMY'. Some other reviewers indicated the honey made it too sweet which I find mystifying with all the other salty, tangy ingredients like the olives and grated lemon rind.

Made this last night and I'm still thinking about it! This will definately be made regularly in my house. I added a couple additional spices based on some other moroccan recipes: 3 cloves of garlic cooked with the onion, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I made basmati rice and added currants and toasted almond slices. I sprinkled everything liberally with cilantro after plating. YUM!

My husband just loved this. I made it "as is" with the exception of deleting the olives (didn't have any and I don't like 'em anyway). Since my husband avoids rice, I added some raisins to the sauce instead. Scrumptious! I'd really call this a 3-1/2 forks if I could.

Rating: 4
Well I RARELY give 4 forks but this was extraordinary; well exceeded my expectations. Stuck inside on a snowy day I chose this b/c I had everything on hand already. However I did not use the chickpeas (but will next time). Also my DH thinks he dislikes olives so I added a generous tablespoonful of black olive tapenade to give the necessary flavor so he would not have to see the olive. Otherwise made as written, and served with mashed celeriac to which coriander was also added (like I said, it's what I had on hand) instead of rice. I used a little less chicken broth but even so I don't see thickening as a problem. I absolutely will make this again.

Gosh. This is delicious. Really delicious. Perfect too as it's one of those "pantry" recipes... Made exactly as written with a few exceptions: lots of lemon (personal taste), used some jarred olive bruschetta from Trader Joe's in lieu of anything else on hand and omitted the green at the end for lack thereof. Could not have been tastier. A new staple at our house.

I made this dish with the suggested rice (I did have to make some changes there, as I did not have golden raisins or almonds in the house. I used dried orange flavored cranberries and walnuts instead. Maybe not authentic, but it worked really well in this meal anyway). As for the chicken, it was excellent. My husband asked me to keep the recipe. I did not have green olives, so I substituted Moroccan oil-cured pitted olives from Trader Joe's. I usually love them in cooking, but in this case there was something missing, so I added two chopped pepperoncini peppers. They added the needed briney taste, and a nice touch of heat. I will definitely make this again.I know all the substitutions can get out of control, but in this case the rice can take almost any dried fruit and nut, and all the spices in the chicken do benefit from something in brine. At any rate, we thought this combination of tastes and textures was phenomenal!

Very nice combination of flavors. I added 1/4 teaspoon turnemic. I thought this added extra color and flavor. I also served this over angel hair egg noodles that were steamed. I would also add extra cumin, a whole teaspoon and 1/2 teaspoon paprika. If you let the sauce simmer for about 20 min before you place the chicken back in the pot, and use only 1 cup it thickens up pretty nicely. I would also add 1 tablespoon lemon zest as opposed to 2 teaspoons. Try 1/3 cup rasins in place of olives, I have tried and loved both! Very good dish!!!

This recipe has become a staple in our home. I made some changes: I eliminate the honey, olives, and cinnamon (because of picky eaters in our family). I double the cumin and paprika. I use zest from one lemon and the juice from 2 lemons. The result is almost a new recipe. The sauce is delicate and light. I have tried the recipe with the honey. My husband liked it, but I felt it was too much sweet/sour going on. For low-carb eaters, the chicken can be served over a bed of spinach. Or you can throw some spinach into the pot to steam at the last minute. I highly reccomend this recipe! Don't be afraid to experiment!

This was a very good recipe, with interesting flavors. It combined well with the almond/raisin rice. I ended up using water, because I didn't have chicken stock, but it still had nice flavor (I'm sure it's better w/the stock, though).

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and ended up with a lot of extra sauce. I would make again, and reduce the amount of chicken broth. It was very flavorful.

Overall, a very nice and straightforward recipe, which can be doubled successfully. The raisins (in the rice) really make the dish, although the olives were nice too. We left the flour out, which worked out fine - but we will make more sauce next time.

This is wonderful. I think it's important to let the chicken really brown very well on both sides, this adds so much flavor to the sauce. After zesting the lemon, I added a squeeze of the juice. I think the olives definitely make this dish special, I wouldn't omit them, they bring so much flavor. I did however leave out the chickpeas as I had none on hand. And the coriander because I find it loathsome. I am eating it cold - it's far too hot right now to eat warm meals - and it's just lovely. The sauce is nuanced and perfectly spiced and works really well with the chicken. This is a real keeper!

This is an awesome recipe. It turned out so good and I thought it was delicious. I subsituted chili powder for paprika (didn't have paprika) and used black olives with boneless chicken thighs. The aroma was extraordinary and the dish turned out extremely well.

I used bone-in chicken parts (thighs and legs). I browned them first, then removed them while making sauce and finally simmered them, covered, for 20 minutes or so till done. Sauce thickened and reduced very well and flavor was terrific. Equally good -- if not better- as a leftover. Would make a good picnic dish (okay, a little messy) with a toasted couscous salad. Better than the grilled Moroccan chicken (Bon Appetit June 2003)

I was disappointed with this recipe. Granted, I made some adjustments: I used dark meat (legs and thighs) with skin and bones -- this gave me a nice frond on which to build the sauce. I also doubled the remaining ingredients (except for the broth -- I used 2 cups) and added 1/4 cup golden raisins. I found the sauce rather flat -- I highly recommend using a good, gelatin-rich homemade stock to give it more body and depth of flavor (I used canned -- bad idea). Edible, but not as great as most Gourmet recipes.

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. We serve it with couscous rather than rice and I increase the amount of cumin. We like a little fruit of some kind on the side, usually dried apricots soaked in port or brandy and stuffed with almonds.

MAKE THIS DISH! I didn't use chicken breasts (chicken thighs instead), and so I made the recipe as if it was for four instead of two.

I made this dish yesterday, and I'm making it again tonight for family. I served it over pine nut couscous with hot lavash (spelling?)/flat bread on the side for dipping. I added 1 shallot and 4 cloves of garlic along with the onion. Also, I cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts and did not remove the pieces from the sauce towards the end of the recipe. I added more cinnamon and added black pepper, paprika and garlic powder to the sauce. Tonight, I'll drop either golden raisins in the sauce or currants in the couscous. I'll also add more chicken broth and flour for more sauce. With a few touches, this recipe could be a 4. My picky boyfriend enjoyed it.

I'm in the minority here - but I thought that this recipe was just ok, not worth raving about. I made it for a gang of people after skiing and no one was thrilled. I'm a very good cook, so perhaps my friends have a higher standard or something. I wouldn't make it again.

This dish has a nice blend of spices and requires very little work. I also used boneless skinless breasts, and doubled the recipe for 4. But I forgot to add the chick peas, which are starchy and therefore might have thickened the sauce a little. I served this with salad and a rice recipe similar to what was recommended here, and the combination was good. I'll definitely make it again!

Simple, delicious. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that is the part of the chicken that I prefer. The dish turned out wonderful; moist and tasty!

My husband is Moroccan and this is one of my favorite Moroccan dishes. However, in Morocco this dish would certainly not be served over rice. Instead, the chicken with the sauce is served on a platter placed in the center of the table. It is eaten with bread (Moroccan flatbread is hard to find, so french baguettes or another crusty bread can be substituted). Moroccans tear bits of crust off the bread and use it to soak up the sauce, and tear off bits of chicken to eat with the sauce-soaked bread. I don't recommend eating it over rice or even couscous. Bread is definately the best way to eat it.

My husband liked this much more than I did. It was very easy to make, but it was a little too sweet for me - I'm not sure I'd use a whole tablespoon of honey next time. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to contrast the sweetness which helped.

I love Moroccan cooking and have had it many times in restaurants. This dish is a lovely dish for all year round. I was unable to find coriander springs so I substituted fresh ground coriander instead (I cut it down to one teaspoon) - you do not lose out on any flavor by making this change. Instead of serving the chicken over rice as you recommended here, I served it over couscous (come on now - that it definitely more Moroccan than rice!). I was afraid that my fiance may not like the dish as he has never had Moroccan cooking before, but he absolutely loved it. He asked that I put the recipe in the keeper box. I loved it just as much as he did and I will be making it again and again.

Are you always on the lookout for ways not to bore your family or guests with the affordable and healthy chicken? This dish fits the bill - and the budget. However, I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for more intense flavor, as I have gotten to the point where the very thought of chicken breast makes me yawn. The amount of sauce produced can accommodate 6-8 amall thighs. Plan on increased cooking time when using thighs and double the recipe. You'll want some leftover for tomorrow!
