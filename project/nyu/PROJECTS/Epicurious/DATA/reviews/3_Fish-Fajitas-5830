I used yellow instead of green pepper for a sweeter taste. Yumm.

This dish was a big disappointment. We could not even finish it, because the flavors combined so poorly.

This wasn't that great. It needed to be spicier. I didn't really care for the pineapple either.

Delicious! I marinated the fish (barracuda) in pureed pinapple chunks and then grilled it. I sauteed the vegetables and followed the recipe otherwise. Everyone loved it - even my kids said "a definite do-again."

All in all, I found this taste a bit strange and will stick to beef or chicken next time we make fajitas. We couldn't taste the cheese as the fish and vegetables dominated. Still, the marinade in the beginning was a good trick, particularly as our snapper had been frozen.

We love this dish!! We've made it many times and shared it with friends. We use plain yogurt instead of sour cream to save on fat. It is still delicious with the cilantro and lime. We have tried substituting cod when snapper was unavailable. It was not quite the same but still pretty good!
