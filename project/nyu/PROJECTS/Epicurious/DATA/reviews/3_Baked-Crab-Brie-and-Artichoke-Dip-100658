Am pretty much sure that this recipe is delightful! I enjoy making this cuisine and it really made me satisfied. More so, this considered one of my favorite dishes! I also love All-American Chocolate Cake, Beef Fillet with Red Wine and  Pigeon with Wild Fountain Cress. I discovered all of these at www.gourmetrecipe.com and www.gourmandia.com. Try to visit those sites and explore your new favorite dishes. Have fun!!

I made such a different version of this recipe that I cannot rate it, but I think that if you're melting brie cheese, it's hard to make your dip taste bland. I added lots of black pepper and a dash of hot sauce, minced garlic and caramelized onion and spinach. It was delicious!

Very expensive and not good at all. It taste like a cream of mushroom soup concoction with tarragon! yuk.

I had a few problems the first time that I made this recipe (crab was bad, no tarragon) but I went ahead and made it. It was great with out the crab and it has become a request for almost every potluck and dinner party. When I make it with out crab I add some bread crumbs to help hold it together. I always add extra parm and a some mozzarella. Not quite how it was written but great just the same

Contrary to some of the negative reviews, this went over very well when I first made it. I've had requests to make it again since, and have.

This is a great recipe, which I have made several times. I do leave out the tarragon - it is overpowering, and I don't think it goes with the other flavors. I use fresh or frozen crabmeat, NOT CANNED, and I always use real brie. Using the new brineless brie cuts down on preparation, but does add to the expense. I, too, jazz it up with a little more tabasco. It is always a big hit!

Please listen to all the bad reviews. I made this dip last year and forgot to add a review. Happened to find it in a search today, and saw all the bad reviews, which were NOT there when I made the mistake of making this dip. So many great (and expensive) ingredients for a horrible dip that I had to bribe some hungry friends into eating the day after our party. There are so many simple recipes for crab dip that are so great. Do yourself a favor and keep searching.

This was a great tasting recipe - I didn't have tarragon anyways, so added a little more parsley and dill, and it won kudos by my friends. A little more work than normal, and more expensive, but well worth it!

Rating: 3
the flavors were superb (I cut the tarragon based on other reviews and doubled the artichokes, garlic, pinch more dill) but this didn't really qualify as a "dip"-- it needs tons more brie or something to give it the right consistency of typical crab dip. However, i'm thinking of using it as a filling for phyllo triangle appetizers or something like that-- some guests said it was too "busy" for a crab dip-- the complexity makes the prep work well worth it...not reaching its full potential if stuck in the dip category though...

Rating: 2
This recipe was a lot of prep work (and fairly costly) for not a lot of payout. I love all the ingredients (except for the tarragon!), but this dish did nothing to really make any of them shine, and instead muddled all the flavors together. If I made it again I would eliminate the tarragon altogether, increase the dill a little, and use a little more brie, though think it would still need a little more "zing" to make it worth while. *a note on the prep work - I did not have a food processor to help me with all the slicing and dicing when I made this recipe. I think this would significantly cut down on some of the prep time.

Rating: 4
A hit everytime, always devoured. I too used cream cheese instead of Brie and cut the tarragon and dill in half. In addition, backfin crab meat works just as well and will save you a few bucks. I also add a bit more garlic and chili pepper since my crowd loves it that way. Keep in mind this recipe does take a bit of time to make, esp. for an appetizer but it's well worth it. I also serve it with toasted baguette slices. Unfortunately, this often tastes better than my main course!

Great recipe that I use each Thanksgiving. Experimenting with different soft cheeses works as well, this year I used camembert. Try not to skimp on the crab either...fresh lump crab as opposed to the canned variety makes all the difference in the world. Will definately make this every year to start off the holidays.

I made this dip a year ago for a wedding shower, and I'm having a dinner party this week - two of the guests have asked if I'd make this again - a year later they remember this dip. I used cream cheese as well instead of brie. Real crab makes the difference for me - and don't skip the herbs!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious (well worth the expense)!!! My guests LOVED this dip and couldn't get enough of it. For a party of six, I cut the recipe in half and it was just the right amount. The only change I made was to use 1/2 lump crab and 1/2 crab clawmeat. Will definately make this again (and again and again).

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this. Did make some changes, though. Didn't have any tarragon, so I omitted that. Cut the brie by half and replaced it with cream cheese. Added a whole package of chopped spinach. Not quite as much cream . . . Didn't feel like the distinctive flavor of Tabasco, but I wanted a little heat, so I used crushed red pepper. (Perfect.) Dijon was good. The wine really comes through in the finished dish. May try sherry some time and will try it with the Tabasco, too.

Skipped the spinach, doubled the artichokes and substituted cream cheese for the brie to save money. Also used canned crab. I've made this two years in a row now at Christmas and people go nuts over it. I'm toying with the idea of adding roasted red pepper to up the color a bit.

what mixed reviews this recipe has had! i made this for a friends 50th b/d party-using 'canned' (read tinned) crab. the flavors were wonderful, the dip a wonderful consistency, tho i longed for a much stronger crab taste. used all the other spices as indicated. for christmas made this dip again-tho in a bit of a hurry as christmas came together this year 'on the fly'. used a already prepared artichoke spinach dip, but added the ingredients in this recipe-spicing, wine, brie, more artichokes,cream and again met with wonderful reviews. as previous reviewer suggested-make ahead and let the flavors meld for a day befor serving. you may need to cook a bit longer than indicated, but results are terrific! fyi-leftovers are wonderful on baked potatoes!!

I was somewhat hesitant trying out this recipe given some of the negative reviews, but figured what the heck: i love crab and artichoke hearts. i used fresh dungeness crab, but only the amount that comes out of one crab--roughly 2 cups--much less than the pound called for by the recipe. i pressed as much of the liquid out of the crab as possible. I halved the amount of brie. I eliminated the spinach (given the comments about how runny the dip turned out), the taragon (thought i had some in the fridge but was wrong) and the dill (yuck), doubled the amount of artichoke hearts and tabasco. baked it in the oven in an au gratin dish, then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. It came out WONDERFUL! It wasn't runny, the texture was perfectly dip-like and scooped up nicely on toasted baguette rounds. The broiler browned the top and gave it that yummy grilled cheese flavor. The receipe did produce a huge amount, the next day it tasted even better cold or hot. Next time i make this, I'm going to make it a day ahead of the party in order for the flavors to better bloom

A total waste of perfectly good ingredients, and a costly mistake! With all the chopping, mixing, sauteing, and baking involved next time I will serve mini crab cakes, a spinach and artichoke dip, baked brie and a nice chardonnay. In the future I will heed others reviews.

I stopped dead in my tracks upon tasting this and had to stand and ponder its deliciousness for a full 60 seconds. I halved the tarragon and thought the flavors blended & complemented each other perfectly. I also used canned crab meat. I did think the dip was too runny -- next time I'll reduce or omit the cream.

Easy enough to make, but definitely too heavy on the tarragon and very rich overall. The brie and the herbs tended to overpower the taste of the crab. I made this for a party of 60 guests and this was the only dish not raved about.

This dish is good, but it is a little watery. I would simmer w/ the heavy cream a little longer so it reduces more. I also cut back on the dill because I'm not much of a fan. Although the dish is good, it's not so fabulous that I would make it without a food processor. It's too time consuming.

I've been anticipating making this dish for quite some time. Waiting for a special occasion and curious as to what this dish would taste like because of all the vastly different reviews.

This is the best crab dip I've ever had. Most people who tasted it agreed. I used cream cheese instead of the brie. The tarragon is essential (fresh), I don't know why others didn't use it. Also, I used a food processor to chop the onion, garlic, and leek. This saved some time. I soaked the loose rings of the leek to wash it..then chopped it. I used Phillip's brand crab meat($7.99 found at Meijers refrigerated with the smoked salmon and kosher foods)..it was very fresh. Well worth the effort!

I took this dish to a Christmas party given by friends who entertain with exquisite taste. I am pleased that this dish lived up to their standards. Because California fresh dungeness crab is in season, I used it instead of lump crab. I also used frozen artichoke hearts instead of canned ones. The trick to thaw spinach in the microwave oven helps to prepare this dish quickly, since I had less than an hour to prepare it given the Christmas rush.

This dip is NOT better than Martha's and hers isn't that good to begin with. It is pretty labour-intensive for a so-so dip. It does make a lot, and I have leftovers. I think it's time to go back to the drawing board and work on perfecting my own Hot Crab Dip.

I also substituted cream cheese for Brie, added twice as much artichoke, left out the spinach and used canned crab meat instead of fresh, and the dip was delish! Much better than Martha Stewart's version, in my opinion. I'll make it for our Christmas party this year.

The name of the recipe sounded so yummy that I bought all of the ingredients. It took ALOT of time to make and I just do not think I could justify the time nor the money for something that I thought was just mediocre. I now notice that everybody previous to me altered the recipe in some way. Too time consuming!

Just made the dip -- my first attempt at an Epicurious recipe -- and I adore it. As the cook from NJ recommended, I switched the crab to the canned stuff and used cream cheese instead of brie to try to save some bucks. I also added the horseradish and some cayenne pepper, per the NJ chef's comments. And it's fantastic! I agree that chopping up some of the ingredients takes a lot of time, but it's worth it. I will definitely make this dish again, as it's a welcome -- and tasty -- departure from the usual, basic crab dip recipe.

Rating: 4
This was a great party dip. In its present form, however, it's a little pricey so to cut down on the cost, I made a few substitutions that worked out really well. First, I used 1 pound of cream cheese in lieu of the Brie and I also substituted much cheaper canned crabmeat ($3.99 to $4.99/pound) for the lump crabmeat. I also added some cayenne pepper for heat and a little prepared horseradish for some zip. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again.

This was my first recipe I prepared from Epicurious. I must say I felt like I was a gourmet cook after all I put into preparing this dish. There are many items that require fine chopping. I chopped all ingredients by hand. A friend who gave me this recipe asked why I didn't use a food processor. I told her I didn't have one - I wouldn't prepare this recipe again without one. This is also an expensive recipe. I was able to use non cooked crab cakes offered in the Publix Store seafood case. I only spent $7.00 for one pound of the crabmeat and the dish turned out great. The jumbo lumps that the recipe calls for were 16.00 for 1/2 pound at Publix and the recipe calls for 1 pound of crabmeat. I wasn't going to spend 32.00 on crabmeat in a dip. Also, there are the fresh herbs and brie that are a little pricy. But I think this is a wonderful tasting dish that I believe should be served as a first course - I believe it's too heavy for a dip and deserves more credit. A tip for the brie - the brie rind must be removed - keep the brie refrigerated until you are ready to remove the rind - this makes for easier removal - otherwise the brie becomes too soft. This is a party size dish!

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it! It took a long time in preparation, so I would only make it again if I was taking it to an "important" gathering. It was also a bit expensive to get all the ingredients. I used 1/2 brie and 1/2 cream cheese.

This recipe was pretty labor intensive. It was very good, though. I made it for brunch and everyone liked it. I was surprised at the quantity - - I had tons left to freeze. Based on past responses I almost entirely eliminated the tarragon. I sprinkled a little of the dried herb early on and it was tasty. I substitued back fin for lump and cut the cost from $40 to $20 per lb.

I agree with other emailers that this recipe was expensive to make but it was fun! i used some brie as well as some havarti. you can go crazy with different cheeses as well, to adjust the flavor. This recipe was bigger that i thought. It was also very good. three to four forks for sure! p.s. in a gourmet issue in late 91. there was a FABULOUS recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, does anyone know of this recipe? It was in the sugar and spice section. It too, was excellent..... I have tried to find it on this web site, but had no luck....

I'm tossed on a 2 or 3 fork rating. I brought this to a wine-tasting and thought it tasted fishy, however people did like it. We had the leftovers with friends 2 days later and we really liked. I think it's a dish that's better made a day ahead to blend the flavors. I suggest that you buy good quality crab meat. I used Trader Joe's and wouldn't again. Costco has really good 1# cans for $12.99 - worth every penny. I substituted evap. skim milk for the cream.

This dip turned out fairly well, but I would omit or reduce the tarragon. I love tarragon, but it overwelms the other flavors of the dish. I also made this with cream cheese instead of brie (for the low fat lovers) and it was great - maybe not as rich as it would be with brie, but I would make it this way again.

I made this as an appetizer for a small dinner party, and it was such a hit, that no one had room for the entree! The recipe makes a huge amount! I used all the brie plus some cream cheese (4 oz.), and I used canned crab meat, because it isn't as strong as the fresh -- I didn't want it to overpower. When I make it again, I will use more dill and much less tarragon, as I discovered that tarragon is not my favorite herb.

I loved all the ingredients in the recipe but found that incorporating all of them into one dish caused some to overpower others. People seemed to enjoy it but were surprised by the crab taste. If I make it again, I'd use less crab and more artichokes and take the recommendation of others who have made it and use 1/2 brie and 1/2 cream cheese. I also used the canned lump crabmeat. My recommendation would be to drain the crabmeat well before adding to recipe.

Wonderful for a party of 8 or more. I used Sue M's suggestion of 1/2 lb brie and 1/2 lb cream cheese with great results.

This is really delicious, but, it took me three and a half hours to make it. So much fine chopping and picking over of the crabmeat. I would only make it again if I felt like going to that much trouble. I used a Semillion Chardonay instead of the Riesling. I didn't make it for a party, just for my fiance and me, so there was a lot left over. The next night I used it as stuffing for fish. I bought four tilapia fillets and put the leftover dip between two fillets. We liked it even better that way than as a dip.
