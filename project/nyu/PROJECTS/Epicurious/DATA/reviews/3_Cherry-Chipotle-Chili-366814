Not the best chili, in my opinion, but good and a novel change due to the unexpected, slight sweetness of the cherries, which marries well with the spices and chiles. But the heat of this recipe overwhelms the cherries. To counter, I used just one chili the second time I made it. It was better, but there are better chili recipes--two of them are on this site and both are called, "Chicken with White Bean Chili."

The cherries were an interesting twist. I would say we knew they were there. Overall a good recipe if you're looking for a variation but not amazing.

I like this recipe, it is easy and healthy and unique. Made per recipe, except used ground red chile powder in place of chili powder. Definitely more than 4 servings' worth, though.

ughhh, i'm glad to read the reviews and see that this turned out good for someone! i couldn't find black cherries (fresh, nor frozen), so i used fresh bing cherries because that was ALL i could find. the chili, overall, tasted like... chili. i didn't really taste the cherries at all? while the yogurt and cilantro is optional, i definitely recommend using it; they're both great flavor addition, regardless if you can taste your cherries or not!

I made this recipe exactly as the instructions directed and had an overwhelming positive feedback from my diners. To be fair we do like spicy and this recipe delivered, however this can easily be controlled by the amount of chipolte sauce that is added. Cherries added a new flavor and texture for a delicious and filling chilli. This recipe is getting added to my recipe box to be made again!!

I thought this was a very interesting recipe. I had some cherries that were sitting in my fridge and did not want them to go to waste. I used all ground beef and used chipolte chili powder in the recipe. I also used diced tomatoes with jalapenos for extra spice. Initially the chipolte flavoring was over powering but that was my fault for going spice happy. I actually thought that the chili was better as leftovers and was not too bad. I would definetly try this again.

I'll admit that I only used this recipe because I had about a pound of black cherries I wasn't going to finish but it was a pleasant surprise. I did make some changes, however: I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, mixed the ground turkey with some ground beef and added some sugar to tone down the tartness of the cherries and tomatoes. I would also recommend simmering it for longer than the recipe calls for (about 45 minutes in my case).
