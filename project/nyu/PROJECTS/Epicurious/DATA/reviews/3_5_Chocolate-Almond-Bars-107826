Excellent! I had no trouble with crumbly dough, but took others' suggestions of pressing the almonds into the cream cheese mixture. I omitted the coffee and added almond extract to the filling.

I made these exactly as set forth in the recipe. I did not encounter much of a problem, if any, with a too crumbly top. I did chop the toasted almonds in a mini-cuisinart--finely, not pulverrized, and got a very nice fine struesel crust. The cookies were fine. I do wonder what would happen if I were to substitute almond flavoring for the vanilla--maybe the next time.

I agree that the top is too crumbly. Next time I will pat more of the dough into the pan and maybe only reserve a cup of the dough (plus nuts) for the crumble on top. I might also increase the cream cheese and chocolate chips and push the crumble into that mixture. Otherwise, I liked the taste quite a bit!

I love hazelnuts and chocolate together, so I substituted those for the almonds. I also didn't have a square pan handy, and used a 10" round cake pan instead, which I guessed would be about the same area. The bars were a big hit at the party I brought them to, and were appreciated for their nice crunch and minimal sweetness. I would like more hazelnut flavor, and next time I will try adding hazelnut extract or oil to the filling along with the vanilla. The same could be done with almond extract if made with almonds.

Delicious sweet snack. I made them as a final note for a tailgate party. Blend of textures and sweet and salt were delightful. Everyone loved them, even the dessert haters in the crowd. Made the recipe as is. Be sure to chop the almonds fairly well to avoid the crumbly dough problem.

I had high hopes for this recipe, given the good reviews and the excellent ingredients. However, there are two thumbs way down at my house. Nothing works enough to even try tweaking.

I made these over Memorial Day weekend for a BBQ, and they were delicious! I was a bit skeptical at first because the "dough" turned out very crumbly, and when I took tried to cut them into pieces after cooling they were a bit hard to put a knife through. But they turned out so delicious! I added some ground vanilla macadamia coffee (2 teaspoons) instead of the instant espresso powder, and I also added some grated Ibarra (Mexican) chocolate to the chocolate chips. Delicious!

The end result of this recipe was very different from what I envisioned, but that doesn't change my opinion of them--they're wonderful. I've made these a few times, and they're always a big hit. I cut the pieces smaller and end up with more than 16. They also freeze well, and taste good frozen. They're easy to make, and still taste just as good when I've modified ingredients to use healthier alternatives, such as the canola oil soft baking butter with no transfats and malitol, a corn based sweetener in place of sugar. The consistency is a little different with the subtitutions prior to baking, yet the end result is fine. I first served these at my daughter's 4th birthday party in October, and they were devoured. Even people who don't like coffee like these.

Yummy--a great bar cookie. I didn't change a thing. I tried these warm and when they were cooled. I served them at a party and received universal approval. I'll definitely make again.

I've gotten raves on this, although I'm not as fond of it as I expected to be.I ground some espresso beans for the coffee. I've made it twice and both times, everyone loved it. I'm e-mailing now to someone who requested it. It's in my permanent cookie file

Taste of butter masked everything -- couldn't really taste much of anything else. Also, I wasn't able to note the textural difference (I was expecting) from the cream cheese layer. . . maybe I should double this mixture? I did refrigerate the bars hoping to "lessen" the butter taste and it did help. But in the end, it really wasn't tasty or impressive -- just seemed like some sugared dough with melted chocholate on top. Too bad because it's gotten some great reviews. :(

I made these for a family get-together and they got a lot of raves! In fact, I received a lot of requests for this recipe so I have to print it out for those family members without computer savvy. I like it that they're not too sweet, yet are rich enough to be a scrumptious little dessert. As others have noted, the topping is a bit *too* crumbly and is something of a mess when you're trying to eat it. I added more chocolate chips than were called for--about a cup, and I made sure the chocolate was bittersweet so that the bars would not be cloyingly sweet. I'll defintely be making these again.

Everyone loved these!!!!!!!!! a keeper. I also added 1 tsp. of Cocoa but I added 1 TBS. of extra sugar,( helps to cut the strong Cocoa flavor.) used the whole amount of instant espresso powder (we love coffee.) I also used flaked almonds, you don't have the outside dark thin shell that you find on whole almonds ( and that dark outside is what gives off a bitter taste.) I was in a hurry so I cooled my crust down in the freezer for about 1/2hr. it worked out great. We had them still alittle warm with ICE CREAM. Just roll us home, but we sure will make them again!

The other reviews were very useful - to avoid the too strong coffee flavor that some commented on, I used only 1 tsp of instant coffee and then added 1 tsp of cocoa. Also used flaked (toasted) almonds instead of whole, and added a thin spreading of melted bittersweet chocolate with a dollop of Baileys added for more oomph. I like them, but the test will be when i take them to the office for my colleagues!

Good flavor. Based on other reviewer's advice I added a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa and a teaspoon of sugar to the filling and it turned out delicious. I am going to continue experimenting with the topping...may try pecans instead of almonds. Really good base recipe.

this was a very simple recipe that turned out to be a big hit. I melted 1/2 cup of semi-sweet morsels in the microwave and spread over the top of cooled bars. You can never have too much chocolate!

These are absolutely delicious! To remove them easily from the pan I lined the pan with aluminum foil and then buttered it. They were easy to remove and cut. I also used suggestions from two previous reviewers. I pressed the topping into the filling so that it was not as loose. I then sprinkled the top with a few mini-chocolate chips.

I too liked these, but they were a bit strange, and seemed to be missing something. I checked here to see what else others did to improve on them! Next time, I plan to add a bit of cocoa powder to the cream cheese mixture to add some additional flavor. As for topping, if you use your hands and squeeze together the crumbs and nuts thoroughly, it comes out perfectly on top. I added a few mini choc chips on top to make the bars look prettier with success. Very similar to Maida Heatter's "Supremes".

The top was a strange consistency and I am not sure what to do about that. I used 1 cup chocolate chunks. The coffee flavor really stands out. I am going to give this another try, though, because it is different and has potential.

Absolutely loved this unusual square, but I would rename it "mocha" almond squares, as the coffee flavor was very noticeable. I did find the topping crumbly, so would suggest perhaps pressing the crumb topping into the cream cheese filling before baking to see if that helps. A wonderful recipe, that would be very sophisticated when served with good quality vanilla ice cream and chocoloate sauce on a dessert plate.
