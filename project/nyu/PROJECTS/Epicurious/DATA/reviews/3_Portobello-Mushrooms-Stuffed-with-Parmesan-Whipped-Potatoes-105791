Served these mushrooms with a prime rib roast. All my guests just loved them!!! Would not use big portobello mushrooms next time, would go with smaller ones. Also, I grilled the mushrooms on the barbecue, brushing them with olive oil first and salted them lightly. They were delicious!

I've made this recipe in the past and it always comes out delicious. I had 2 russet potatoes and 2 sweet potatoes and wanted to use them both up. I made the recipe as directed but broiled the mushrooms first to release a lot of the water. I was right about to stuff the mushrooms and remembered I had some lobster meat chunks in the refrigerator. I added about a 1/2 cup and gave it stir. Topped the mushrooms and onion mixture with the potato mixture. When it came out of the oven, I tried a bit of the filling and it was wonderful!

I agree with others who've said that the portobellos are lost in this dish - mushrooms are in prime season right now in Texas, and their amazing meaty tastiness was overwhelmed by the mashed potatoes. And it was also a bit of a gutbomb - ate this as an entree with just some green beans on the side, and it was really heavy. I didn't serve it with the spinach.

I loved this recipe, it came out delicious. I tweeked it a bit by boiling my potatoes in chicken broth and I used smaller mushrooms which allowed my guests to savor the flavor.

I love stuffed portobellos but this was not a favorite. It was edible but on the bland side. The potatoes lacked the necessary flavor to compete or work with the meaty mushrooms. The spinach needed more than salt and pepper to add anything to the dish.

I usually LOVE the recipes on this sight, but not this one! This recipe was not "so-so". It was "not so good", and I won't make it again! Somehow this recipe takes a bunch of flavorful ingredients and creates a bland, and mealy dish that leaves you too full to enjoy any other courses that are served with it. The unique qualities of the portobellos were suffocated by a heavy and flavor-concealing "stuffing" of mashed potatoes.What a disappointment, and what a waste of expensive and easy to prepare ingredients. I'd much rather enjoy portobello recipes that celebrate their unique texture and taste. Then if i want potatoes, I will likely prepare them mashed, and allow them to be the wonderful comfort food that they can be.

This recipe didn't do much for me. It wasn't bad, but the flavors didn't meld--it was just a mushroom with some cheesy mashed potatoes on top. Also, it didn't look very elegant, but maybe I should have taken more care in shaping the potato mounds. I marinated the mushrooms to give them a little flavor which helped, but overall I wasn't impressed this dish.

This recipe is very popular with my family. I am much more generous with the garlic and a little more generous with the cheese than the recipe provides. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing and they come out perfect every time.

I had some potatoes and portobellos from my CSA box so i decided to give this recipe a shot. I made it for a weeknight dinner for my boyfriend and I and it was great. We each had about one and a half mushrooms and it was very filling. I combined the onions with the potatoes as recommended by a previous reviewer and that worked perfectly. I also used more cheese than called for - probably about 2x as much. I think this would also work well in smaller shrooms as an appetizer.

I used 3 inch button mushrooms, baked them gill side down for ten minutes,dried them with paper towel then piped in the potato mixture,I added roasted garlic and topped with chives. although they tasted good they were a little dry,How other people got a soupy mess is beyond me.

We thought this was great! I definitely recommend adding a little extra onion and some garlic too, just to add a dash of flavor. Also, don't forget the eggs and don't put too much milk in your mashed potatoes in order to avoid the "soupy mess" syndrome. My husband hates vegetables but loves mushrooms and he ate these all and asked for more! I'll definitely make it again!

After reading all your comments I decided to make these. The ingredients looked great so here is what I did to alter this recipe. After baking the mushrooms at 400 I flipped them over and drained the water out, this should help the person who had a soupy mess. I also roasted a head of garlic and added that to the pototoes. I increased the amount of rosemary and parsley and added that onion, mushroom mixture right into the potatoes. It held together much better than using the two separate steps of assembling the mushrooms. I also toasted some slivered almonds and added them and some freshly grated nutmeg to the spinach. Pinenuts would have been good too, but I was out. Then I put the spinach on a large platter topped with the stuffed mushrooms and garnished it with freshly sliced lemons. It was then served as a vegetable with beef tenderloin. The recipe doubles and triples well.

We used this as a Thanksgiving side dish,stuffed smaller portobellos with white potatoes only, didn't serve it over spinach. Fairly bland and uninteresting, though looked nice enough. Surprisingly, we liked them better the next day, rewarmed in the microwave. I like the idea of stuffed portobellos but if I were to make this again I'd use more onions and add garlic to the potato mixture, maybe top the potatoes with the onions instead of the other way around.

What a sloppy gross mess.

Good recipe...easy to make, but time consuming. The mushrooms should probably be marinated prior to cooking. A sauce either over or around the final product would add quite a bit. I would make this recipe again...using smaller portabellos ( I think mine were too big..6" diameter.

This recipe takes some time - and I ended up with way too much mashed potatoes but it was delicious. My boyfriend who doesn't even like mushrooms loved these.

This dish was great. Fresly grated Parmesan is a must along with fresh herbs. I would like to make this for a larger crowd. I am thinking this could be adapted to a casserole dish.

Extremely satisfying- I was surprised at how filling the stuffed mushrooms turned out to be! My only complaint was the time involved in preparation, but it was certainly worth the effort!

With first bite, I did not achieve a nirvana state,but it's definately worth making again: the texture of the potatoes contrasted nicely with the juiciness of the portobellos and the clean taste of spinach. And what an attractive way to serve your veggies. More garlic should be put into the recipie, and one should also use the real parmesan cheese instead of kraft cheese. :-)

This recipe was relatively easy to prepare and got rave reviews. I recommend using mini portobellos and making it as an appetizer without the spinach. Yum!

Invested time was peeling the potatoes & chopping the mushroom stems & onions. Overall impression is the flavor compliments the dish well. I was out of rosemary and subbed it with thyme. Skipped the spinach as well. Vegetarians will welcome this dish! I served this dish as an appetizer.

To Hilton Head - you didn't even make this dish, with all your variations it is something else entirely. While variations and suggestions are always truly appreciated, you're not reviewing the dish in question. It doesn't help others evaluate the recipe!

Oh. My. God. This is absoulty DELICIOUS!!! I didn't have yams, so I just used regular white potatoes, but that turned out great! I was also out of rosemary and parsley, so i used some fresh sasafrass root, italian herbs, and a sasafrass leaf. Also, I love using extra virgin olive oil; the flavor is unsurpassable. I also used regular small white caped mushrooms. It tastes wonderful! I mixed in some cayanne pepper with the olive oil when I brushed the bottoms of the mushrooms, and that added a delightful aftertaste. It leaves your mouth feeling warm; that mixed with the smoothness of the potatoes is devine. I also mixed in about 3/4 a cup of unpacked grated mozarella cheese in the potatoes; I didn't notice any puffing like someone else did. Maybe it was the cheese that held it down? I also put a little cheese underneath the onion/mushroom stem mix on the caps, before putting on the potatoes. It makes a great hidden surprise and taste. I also put a few peppercorns on top of the parmasian cheese crust. I will DEFIATELY make this again!

I made this recipe last night omitting the spinach and serving it as a side dish. My husband and I both liked the flavor and the presentation. If I do it again I would use smaller mushrooms. One was a big serving for a side. Also, for the 4-5" mushroom I thought the potatoes were a little skimpy although after baking they did puff up. I only used half an egg because the whipped potatoes seemed a little too runny and I stirred the sauteed onions into the the potatoes before baking which worked out fine.

This was a bit time consuming to prepare but well worth the effort. I would definitely make it again. It was loved by all that ate it.

This was a very different style for us. We used portobello mushrooms fresh from Kenneth Square, PA, where these mushrooms are a speciality. I made these with yams and reg. potatoes, mashed. The kids enjoyed the reg, the adults enjoyed the yams. So, it was mixed. But, it was a fun side dish! We'd make it again!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The yams did not go well with the mushrooms. I would definitely not make this again.

My husband is not a big yam fan, so I made his without the yams but added them to mine. Both ways were excellent. I think this will be an easy dish to prepare in advance...pop them in the oven and saute the spinach at mealtime. In fact I plan to use smaller portobellas and serve this on our Christmas Eve Buffet.

This was an easy, excellent vegetarian dish. I'm not an egg eater so I only used half of the amount. I think the only difference was that the stuffing didn't puff up as much as if I had used the full amount of eggs. I'm making it without the mushrooms and using it as a potato side dish.
