The sun-dried tomatoes make them brownish, like deviled eggs gone bad, very unappetizing.

I thought the taste was bland and they LOOKED very unappealing. The sun-dried tomatoes make them look brownish, like deviled eggs gone bad. I'll stick with the classic recipe. Sometimes the oldies just can't be beat. My niece would call this recipe "weasle food," (something that's overwrought just so someone can feel like a gourmet.

I've been making these for a few years now and they are always a huge hit. Because they don't contain mayo, a lot of people who typically won't eat deviled eggs really enjoy them. I add a teaspoon or two of light sour cream to moisten the filling a bit.

I also put some mayonnaise in there because of the crumbliness. But I thought the recipe was a great modification of deviled eggs.

The crumbliness bothered me so I added about 1 tablespoon mayonaise...just to hold it together, and it was great!

Delicious! My filling was crumbly as well, but I found that when I sort of packed it together, it stayed.

Vary easy to make and my husband and myself definitely will make them again...great to take to a small get together.

Am I missing something? The filling was dry and crumbly, needs something to hold it together.

The sun dried tomatoes adds an exuberant quality that makes you want to eat more and more.

Have made this one two or three times already. It's a little bit messy to prepare, but the taste is really good. In fact the last time I couldn't even sample them they were gone so fast!
