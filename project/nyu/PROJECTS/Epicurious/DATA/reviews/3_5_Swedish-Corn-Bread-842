I followed this recipe to a T and served it with veggie chili. I found this cornbread to be way to sweet! I would make it again but add only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups. the consistency was great, very moist! and perfect with chili!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I baked for 27 minutes instead of 35. I suspect that may be why some have said it's too dry/crumbly. I thought it had the perfect amount of sweetness. I will definitely make it again.

My favorite sweet cornbread recipe. Try using 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup plain flour for an even more moist, dense cornbread.

Fantastic with the sugar cut in half.

This is by the worst Corn Bread I have ever eaten. My husband didn't even like it, and he usually eats everything. We had to throw it out. It was the driest recipe ever. I thought maybe I had left something out but I checked and everything was put in correctly. As for cutting down on the sugar, it is a big mistake. I used only 1 cup of sugar since others who wrote in said it was too sweet, and it was not very sweet at all. It really needs the full amount of sugar. But it seems something is lacking in order to make it moist. Will not use this recipe again unless someone comes up with a solution to the moistness.

My roommates and I have been on a cornbread recipe quest. This is one of the finalists (Joy of Cooking is the other). We used only 1/2 cup sugar and milk instead of water. It was still slightly sweet and had a cakey consistency. It doesn't need dressing up with honey or anything - it's good on its own.

Made it according to the recipe. Maybe a little sweet, but that's how I like my corn bread. The crumb and the moistness were terrific. I don't know why I was making the recipe on the can of cornmeal for so long! This was really good.

This is a fantastic recipe. The resulting bread is moist and holds together well. Like other readers, I am partial to a slightly less sweet corn bread so I only used 1/2 cup sugar. I have tried the recipe with both water and milk successfully.

This is my favorite corn bread recipe and now the only one I use. It is moist and delicious and keeps well for several days.

Read and tried to yield most of the reviews. I halved the recipe using 1 egg plus 1 yolk, reduced sugar to heavy 1/4 cup, replaced water with non- fat milk (that's what I had), 1/4 tsp vanilla (don't bother) and nearly 1 stick butter. I let the batter sit for 30 minutes (helps to make it hold together and not be crumbly) before baking in 8x8 pan at 390 for 30 minutes. Husband loved it; I thought it good but not the best I've had. Easy, basic recipe and will make again

Rating: 4
Delicious. However, as much as I love a sweet cornbread, this was just a bit too sweet. As per others' suggestions I increased the butter to 1 1/2 and substituted milk for the water, but did not decrease the sugar...will do this next time and expect the results to be even better.

I followed the advice of A Cook from Cypress and the corn bread was fabulous. I would definitely make this again.

Loved it! Thanks to all for the modification suggestions. Also used 3/4 c. sugar, 1 1/2 sticks butter, and milk (skim). Cornbread was amazing. It cooked in about 25 min total, not the recommended 35 min. Great flavor, great texture. Just enough sweetness. So easy!

Halved sugar, used buttermilk in lieu of water, and added 1 tsp of baking soda to account for the buttermilk. Tasty, and I can't imagine what it would have been like with double the sugar, as I found it a little sweet as is. As another reviewer mentioned, this makes an excellent base recipe.

As many other readers did, I used only 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 sticks butter and milk in place of the water. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet. Came out delicious! Slightly sweet and moist. Very good with butter and a little honey.

I was looking to duplicate a wonderful cornbread that we had while in Georgia. Based on the reviews I cut the sugar in half, kept the butter the same and substituted buttermilk for the water (adding 1 teaspoon of baking soda to offset the acidity of the buttermilk). I baked in standard muffin tins at 375 for 20 minutes . It made 18 muffins. The muffins were moist and sweet. This receipe is s keeper.

Made these as muffins (baked them about 25 min) with 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 sticks butter and they were DIVINE. I didn't have a sifter but it wasn't a problem. They turned out perfectly.

I split this recipe into two batches and made one with cheddar and jalapenos and one half with vanilla and sugar. Both were great. Substituted milk for water in both. For the jalapeno version, I added about 1/3 c. of sugar to take the bitter edge off. But in the sweet version, I used a little more than 1/2 c. of sugar and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract. I put the oven at 375 and baked in 8x8 inch pans for about 30 minutes. Guests got to choose their flavor.

Rating: 4
Makes a great muffin too, with reduction in sugar (1 cup is more than enough), more butter (1.5 sticks), and replacing water with milk, as others have suggested. I baked the muffins for approx 25 mins. My batter was curiously chunky but they came out great. I added red bell and jalapeno peppers, and grated cheddar. really great accompaniment to chili.

I will probably make this again because I have everything on hand most of the time but I wouldn't say it's my favorite corn bread. I guess it depends on what you are used to. I don't mind a couple Tbls of sugar in my corn bread but wow this was sweet. I will use less sugar next time.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Of course, I also changed the water to milk, used only 1 cup of sugar and I also added one cup of corn to the mixture. It would also be great as muffins. I will try that next.

I plan on making this recipe but cutting it in half using many of the helpful suggestions. Any idea on what size pan to make it in and how long to cook it. Since there's only two of us, less is more. Thanks

This is a very yummy corn bread recipe. I followed the previous review and only put 1 cup sugar instead of the recommended 1 1/2 cups. It melted in my mouth.

This was great corn bread. I halved the recipe but adjusted the butter and sugar differently. I knocked the sugar back to 1/2 cup. But kept the butter at a stick...I'm not suggesting to do this, I just didn't want it crumbly and holy cow it was good. Also replaced the water with milk. The egg was tricky but just did one whole egg and an egg white, it was fine. I put it in the texas style muffin tins and it fit perfect in 6. Cooked for 20-25 min. We're having them again for breakfast right now!

I have made this recipe twice, once to eat as-is, and again as a base for turkey stuffing. Following suggestions from other reviewers, I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, 3/4 cup of butter, and milk instead of water. Fabulous - best corn bread ever!

I used one cup of sugar and subbed soy milk for one cup of the water (needed a nondairy recipe for kashrut). It was a good basic cornbread that I will probably use as a base for variations in the future.

I wrote the previous review, I forgot to add. I also substituted the water with skim milk.

This is a moist delicious corn bread. I never tried the original recipe. I picked advice from previous reviews: 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup sugar. I prefer a slightly sweetened corn bread. I found the 1 cup of sugar to be perfect. Anything more would be too sweet. Even yummier the next day.

Rating: 4
OMGiH, is this ever good! I took Amy's advice and used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, cut the sugar to about one scant cup, and subbed skimmed milk for the water. Also added about two tablespoons minced jalapeno. My husband, not the biggest cornbread fan, said it was fantastic, and I agree. I can see that if you're not used to a drier corn bread that you might not like this, but the extra butter helps with that. I made one batch to test for a Mexican themed party I'm having this weekend, and I can see right now I'm going to have to make more.

This is definitely the best! One of my housemates said that this beat his mother's home-cooked recipe, and every time I've baked it it's eaten up within a day or two. I use several revisions, based upon previous suggestions: increase butter to 1 1/4 stick, substitute 2 cups skim milk for the water, and only 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I love the sweetness and the stickiness of this cornbread. Those of you who didn't like it must be used to savory cornbreads.

I make this corn bread all the time. People always take a bite and then say 'that's a really good corn bread'.It's especially good for breakfast!

very good, but you'll definitely want to cut back on the sugar. i used 1C vs. 1-1/2 and next time i'll even scale back to 3/4C. also substituted 2C nonfat milk for the 2C water.

I followed this recipe exactly, except reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out to be quite disappointing. The cornbread was dense, not as sweet as I hoped, and dry. I made it for a BBQ, and not many people touched it. Very embarrassing.

The Swede's must really like things sweet: I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was still a bit too sweet and I love sweet things! Next time I will try 3/4 cup of sugar. I also substituted skim milk for the water and did not change the amount of butter used. I have been searching for the perfect cornbread recipe and THIS IS IT. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. And, after reading all the reviews, it's obviously extremely versatile. For those of you who have increased the butter, hey, you only live once right? I'm sure the recipe is even more divine with more butter! I made no high altitude adjustments and it rose beautifully. Bon Appetit!

This is my favourite cornbread. However, despite my preference for sweet cornbread, I definitely cut the sugar to 1 cup. I also use 1 cup water and 1 cup milk (2%) instead of 2 cups of water. I bake at 375, not 400. Truly, truly, this is such good cornbread!

This corn bread was way way too sweet and I even cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups as suggested by some others. It was like no other corn bread I've ever made and it was dense and sticky. I recommend this unless you cut the sugar to about half or less.

Oh my goodness!!! This is the most fabulous cornbread recipe i have ever tasted! I was not able to get my mom's recipe in time so i made this one and it tastes just like it! THe right amount of sweetness and perfectly moist. Definetly a keeper!

This is by far the best corn bread I've ever made. Wonderful-- sweet, moist, but not too dense, either. Definitely a keeper. It also makes great muffins, too-- if you don't mind them being a tad flat-topped. One very nice variation I've tried is to replace one cup of water and one egg with a small can of creamed corn. I did this when I discovered one day I only had 2 eggs. It works really well, producing a lighter crumb that's just as moist, and still holds together well.

Really good--very easy to prepare and better than the average. The addition of vanilla and the substitution of milk (instead of water) were good suggestions by other reviewers. A bit less sugar (1/4 cup) would be better, and the additional butter was NOT necessary--better with the stated amount. I will increase the salt by at least 50% next time.

This is a fine, basic recipe. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and it was still quite sweet. 1 stick of butter was just plenty, and the extra 3/4 c. of corn was just right. my guests loved it; i think i'll try it with milk next time, see if that makes it any smoother.

Before hosting a big summer BBQ, I tested a number of recipes and ended up using this version (with Amy's revisions) and this was a huge hit. I made 4 large pans of this cornbread and there wasn't any left over. We had brunch the next morning and guests were asking for more cornbread. I've since e-mailed this recipe to all my guests. A keeper!

Although I'm not a huge fan of cornbread, this was good. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup, substituted milk for water, added 2 tsp vanilla, and baked at 390 instead of 400. My husband, who loves cornbread, really liked it, as did our 6 year old son.

I made this incorporating various other cook's suggestions, particularly those of Amy from McLean. Although I was very pleased with the texture that resulted, I found the taste of the vanilla to be overwhelming. Next time, I'll do it just as I did, using skim milk instead of water, increasing the butter and slashing the sugar, but I'll omit the vanilla altogether.

I loved this corn bread! Just the right amount of sugar. I also added corn and used milk instead of water. I found that the bread browned a little too quickly so will try it at 375 degrees next time.

The best cornbread ever. I did make the water to milk change based on reviewer recommendation and it turned out great. Even Jiffy is made with milk. It makes quite a large batch, but it halves well. It also freezes remarkably well. I don't know what makes it Swedish, ( I am and we never were big cornbread eaters) but we love it! The only corn bread I will ever make.

I made this recipe for a BBQ dinner party to go with Ribs. Excellent recipe. The only changes I made were to use milk (skim) instead of water, added one can of drained corn and decreased temp to 390* (because of the comments about being crumbly). I should also have taken the advice to cut the sugar to 1 cup or 1 1/4C. NO additional butter was needed. If you decrease cooking temp make sure to increase cooking time at least a few minutes.

Rating: 3
Irresistible coming right out of the oven, but too hard and not so good once it has cooled down. Has a great cornmeal texture, yet does not crumble. I tried this first as written, but it was better the second time -- I used Amy from McLean's excellent changes and also reduced the sugar to 1.25 cups.

I've been looking for a cornbread recipie that can come close to the one they serve in the 'Panhandler" restaurant in Sand Point,Idaho. This is just about there. I followed Amy from Mclean,VA's lead but used only 1 cup of sugar. Stayed moist for 2 days! A definate REPEAT.

Sorry, Seattle, but you had to have messed up. This is the best recipe for cornbread I've found and am always asked for it whenever I've served it at potlucks, etc. Bake at 350F for high-altitude (I'm at 5600 ft.). This is a great recipe.

Finally, finally I've found a corn bread recipe that comes out great! For some reason I've never been able to make a good corn bread, now I do! I followed the previous reviewers suggestions exactly with the milk and vanilla and extra butter and the cornbread came out moist and delicious, with a touch of sweetness that I like. This really is the best!

After a long and tedious search, I've definetly found the world's greatest corn bread. However, after making the cornbread from this particular recipe, I've made a few changes, and I think if you're brave enough to try them, you'll definetly agree with me that impossible as it may seem, the recipe is improved. This is what i do: I increase the butter from one stick to one and a half sticks, use two cups milk instead of two cups water, and add two teaspoons of vanilla extract into the batter, alongside the milk, and bake the cornbread at 390'F instead of at 400'F. Trust me, these rather minor changes really do make the cornbread even more fantastic than it already is!!! Happy eating!!

Okay, the sugar looked to be a little much, and so I halved it. Then, I used 4 egg whites and one egg yolk. I also cut the butter down by a little more than a tablespoon. Next, I added one jalapeno, seeded, and about 1/2 cup of corn. It was unbelievable. Also, I used white corn meal instead of yellow-- just personal preference. It took about 50 minutes to cook...Next time, I will add more jalapeno-- and change nothing else!

I hate to be the one to spoil this corn bread's glowing rating, but neither my husband nor I cared for it. Yes, it is sweet - way too sweet in our opinion. Much more of a dessert than something you would want to eat with say chili or ribs. And in the morning I like to have corn bread hot with butter melted on with honey or maple syrup or something on top, and with the inherent sweetness on this corn bread, this would be impossible. Also, we found this bread to be so fall-apart crumbly that we could not slice it in half. I honestly can not see what all the fuss is all about. I have had better results from Jiffy Corn Bread Muffin Mix!!
