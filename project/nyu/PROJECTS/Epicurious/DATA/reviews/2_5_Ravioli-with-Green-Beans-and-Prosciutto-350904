LOVED IT! It is now one of our new favorites. Forgot to get sour cream, substituted yogurt, flour, water mixture.

loved the idea of this recipe, but the sauce was terrible. i ended up making ravioli with my own simple cream sauce, then added some diced prosciutto and made a separate green bean dish as a side.

This was o.k....anything with prosciutoo in it has to be great, right? The sour cream was an interesting substitution for a red sauce, but it just didn't all come together for some reason.
