Only made 2 pieces of halibut but forgot to half the amount of pepper. Ouch! Harissa was mucho spicy. No problem, cut it with some cream and all was good. Recipe doesn't mention it but it's easy to prep the sauce in advance of the fish and just grill the fish when you're ready.

This was really great and easy. We served it with rice. Realizing too late that my jalapenos were gone, and having some authentic Hungarian paprika paste on hand, I tossed in a bit of that instead. The result was completely un-American and delicious.

Definitely make this recipe and definitely double the harissa. Toast some pita bread too for dipping. Put less (than more) olive oil because the veggies, once blended, will release some water of its own. I didn't grill the fish or jalapenos or lemon. I just pan fried the halibut and roasted the red bell peppers over stove fire. I thought the measurements for cumin and coriander would be too much but they were perfect, with salt nicely rounding out the flavors in the harissa. My cut of halibut fish was really thick so after it cooked a little, I split the piece in three and cooked the flesh thoroughly. I will make this again and again and again.

Wow - this was much better than I expected. It was a little spicy, but that's my fault for halving the recipe and keeping the hot pepper quantity the same. I will definitely be making this again, but next time a double batch to have some harissa left over for other uses.

Excellent and easy recipe. The sauce was great. Substitued one Thai red chile for the jalapenos. Otherwise followed it to the tee and will definitely be using recipe again.

This sauce was fantastic! I had a ton of yellow and red bell peppers lying around so I made extra and put it on everything: chicken, cauliflower, asparagus, etc. I didn't have any jalapenos or any other hot peppers on hand, so I used some sriracha and it still turned out beautifully.

Overall very easy and delicious. Grilling the veggies with some pecan chips made them perfectly smokey. Sauce was exotic, bursting with flavor, and spicy. My dad thought it was a notch too spicy but would taste good similarly with 1/2 seeds removed.

I substituted 2 serrano peppers for the jalapeno which added an extra kick to the sauce. It was a perfect blend of sour, salty and spicy. I would definitely make this recipe again. NOTE: I also paired the fish with a Mediterranean couscous which was also a nice compliment of flavors.

Simple, elegant, and delicious--this sauce will become a staple in my repertoire. I used a combination of red, yellow and orange peppers (1/2 of each) and the jalapeno I used was quite small, so the sauce was quite mild but very tasty nevertheless. It will be great on chicken, too!

Tasty and so easy, was able to make it with what we had on hand. A bit spicy, but it matched our tastes. I made the whole recipe of sauce to go with the chicken dish we are having in 2 days.

The sauce is easy to prepare, tasty and spicy (all great things in my book!). But, my husband and I found that it overwhelmed the halibut. I think we enjoy the simple taste of fresh fish. Since it made more than we needed, I'll try the leftovers with grilled chicken or pork. I will definitely make again when I find the right pairing.

Absolutely delicious! I substituted thai bird chilies which are much spicier that jalepenos. It was a bit to spicy so I added coconut milk to cut the heat and it was excellent! This is a keeper and so easy to make.

This was excellent - especially the sauce, which had a nice mix of subtle flavors. We also roasted the vegetables and pan fried the fish.

I thought this was fantastic. I baked the fish at 350 then I broiled it for the last couple of minutes with the garlic and peppers in the pan under the fish, flipping once and moving the peppers around. I thought it was delicious and serve it with carrots sauteed with a chili arbol, ancho, regular chili powder blend.

This was delicious! I roasted the red peppers and garlic instead of grilling and pan fried the fish. Served with zucchini and couscous. I think its a bit misleading to call this Harissa since that doesn't contain bell peppers, only chilies. It was great, but more like Ajvar in taste.

Used a habanero instead of jalepeno which spiced it up nicely. The charred skins on the peppers make a difference to the sauce if you leave them on, better with them off.

I loved this recipe, and actually used the harissa for many other meals in the same week. I cut it into a spaghetti sauce and it gave it a nice kick. I've also used it on panini sandwiches. Great meal for kids because they can eat the fish apart from the sauce, or just have sauce on the side if they are feeling 'adventurous'.

I made it with Halibut and it was a huge hit for my Sunday night dinner party. I wound up increasing the pepper to give it more of a kick.

Wonderful. I used mahi-mahi and I used a variety of sweet peppers for the red. it added much better color. I decreased the jalepeno a bit. But very tasty.

Really liked the smokiness of the harissa, with just the right amount of kick to it. I used Mahi Mahi and thought it was perfect. I think it would the presentation and flavor could be improved with a little chopped italian parsley.
