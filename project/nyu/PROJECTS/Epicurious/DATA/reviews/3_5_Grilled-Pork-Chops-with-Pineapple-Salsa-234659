Solid recipe. We'll definitely do it again. Another reader suggested using mango...which we will do next time. The sweetness and color of mango would have taken it to another level. Added cilantro to salsa. A little fresh herb never hurt anything! Will do again.

I'm rating this recipe only for the rub because I used the pineapple relish from a different recipe on this site for the rest of the dish due to what I had on-hand. This rub is so simple, yet absolutely delicious on grilled chops!

This is a great recipe. I was at TJ's and instead of buying fresh pineapple chunks, I bought the medley with papaya and mango, Awesome. This was so easy and is a keeper.

I don't have a gas grill and didn't have time for the charcoal to heat up, so I made the rub without the oil, let it sit on chops for 15 minutes then heated the oil in a pan till hot, and pan fried the chops till just done. The chops were flavorful and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. Made the salsa as per the recipe and the mix of flavors was really wonderful. My husband and son loved it. I will definitely make it again!

i just finished this as a dinner for one and want more ~ the pork was delicious and the pineapple salsa a perfect complement to the dish!

Yummy. I'm going to take it easier on the serranos next time, though. Half of one chile was more than enough. I'll trade out some of it for garlic, ginger, or more cumin.

This is a great recipe! I have used the serrano and I have used jalepeno, both were good. I used roasted green chile from Hatch, NM. All good. I did add some chiffonade cilantro to the salsa a few times and we like it very much. I have once used a can of gold pineapple chunks I coarse chopped with okay results, but fresh ripe pineapple is key to this salsa/recipe. Fresh lime juice is too. Here is a taste treat: Add about two minced/pulverized cloves of garlic, and a tablespoon of ground cumin seed to a cup of olive oil, or even corn oil, and shake well, let it sit in the refrigerator for up to a month. Then, brush on meats and poultry for an amazing flavor.

Didn't have the red onion or the pepper, but did have fresh chives and basil so chopped them up and tossed with the pineapple and lime juice. Added some chopped red pepper for colour, and used the pickled jalapeno/banana peppers in my fridge. Gorgeous in colour and taste!

Really great. My husband and I love spicy food.. I didn't have a fresh pepper, so used about 1 Tbsp diced jalapeno. I served this with roasted sweet potatoes and fresh corn on the cob. Wonderful dinner!!

This recipe was just ok. There are only two of us, so we made it twice this week to use up ingredients. Made it exactly as the recipe called for (liked the cumin on the chops). The first time was pretty good, but we thought of a few changes: add another fruit (like mango or payaya) to the salsa - it's just too one-dimensional (which is strange, because it shouldn't be) for us. The second change is to really dice the pineapple smaller (and maybe even mash a bit) because it sort of falls off the pork chop. It still didn't really do much for me, even the second round (although we hadn't added the second fruit.) Epicurious has so many fabulous recipes that I just don't think it's worth it to make this one again. Not that it was bad, it just was ok.

Just made this recipe and it was awesome! I couldn't find the Serrano pepper so i used Jalapeno and just took the seeds out. It was very very good. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for company and got rave reviews. Will definately make it again

This was great! Would definitely make it again! We grilled the pineapple first and deleted the chile. Let the rub sit on the chops for about half an hour. Combination of cumin and pineapple was delish!

December in Minnesota and we had a freak 40 degree day so I pulled out the grill. These were very tasty and quick to prepare! I used boneless pork loin instead of bone-in. Didn't have serrano or red onion but used jalapeno and shallots. Delicious! Salsa would be good on chicken and fish too. Definitely use your outdoor grill.

Perhaps because I cooked this on a stove-top grill instead of outside, I didn't find the chops very flavorful. The rub smelled good, but it should have been on the chops for a while before cooking, I think. The salsa was all right, but only all right and tasted better warm than cold.

I made this recipe at least twice a month all summer - needless to say, I loved it. I make the recipe as written, but will try grilling the pineapple when I make it for guests tonight.

Wasn't as wild about this recipe as the others were. I bought nice chops from the butcher, just think they would of tasted better if I would of used no recipe at all.

Outstanding. Maybe the best pork chops I ever had. Very quick and easy. The salsa was outstanding as well. I have a very high tolerance for spicy foods and will admit the salsa had a bite but it was still perfect with the cumin pork chops. Very nice dish.

Grilled the pinapple as suggested previously (thanks!) Would definatly grill the pinapple again. Used jalapeno instead Great recipe - guests loved it as well.

This is terrific especially if you can find really good chops. We cut the pineapple into thick slices and grilled it with the pork - definitely makes for a more delicious salsa.

Quick, easy and yummy!!!

This is a great dish. I really liked the pineapple and cumin combination. I substituted a jalepeno for less spice and it was just right.

Easy, simple and delicious recipe full of flavor. We served it over some mango couscous and added a side of roasted carrots (roasted in olive oil, salt and pepper). Delicious! It does pack some heat, though - I might also leave out the seeds from the pepper next time as another cook suggested.

My husband loved it but I thought it was too spicy (as did my kids). Next time I might use less cumin and leave the pepper seeds out of the salsa.

really good recipe. The pineapple adds a unique twist on pork. Guests loved it (although some mentioned the "spice" more than once. May tone it down, depending on the audience - but I loved it!)

ensemble3, I think you meant your question to go with the Artichokes wiht Artichoke-Mint Dip. I think you'd have to remove the finer leaves just above the choke before you could scrape out the choke with a spoon. I eat artichokes all the time, but I've never removed a choke! It would make a nicer presentation!

Rating: 0
Did not try this dish yet, but I'm curious how you scrape the choke out of a whole artichoke. If it's been split, it's easy, but quite a trick if it is still whole. Am I missing something?

Didn't have pineapple, used mangos instead. Seared the chops, then finished cooking them in the oven. Didn't want meat to be too tough. Turned out great!

Used the Papaya and Red Onion Salsa on this site, as my husband can't eat raw pineapple in any form. Excellent combination, and the pork chops were tender, and juicy.

I made this last night using the thin cut pork chops. Great combination of flavors! I'm going to make it again tonight with thicker chops because I have some of the salsa left over. I might try a little cilantro in the salsa next time.

Nice balance with the grilled chops and the spicy-sweet salsa.
