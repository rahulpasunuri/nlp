Easy and tasty soup. My 8 year-old son said, Broccoli soup sounds gross but it's actually really good!" I wanted a little more bulk so I added one peeled and chopped potato when I added the chopped broccoli. After the soup was cooked and pureed, I sprinkled in a healthy handful of shredded cheddar cheese and also added a dollop of plain yogurt for a little more depth. Both additions mixed in smoothly. It was a big hit!

I made this soup twice, once as is and once with my own addition. I wasn't floored with this as is, but it was simple and still really good and filling. My second time through I added potatoes for extra texture and thickness, and added another 2 cups of broths. That made it for me. Will definitely make it again. I also ended up serving the potato version with cheddar cheese.

This is so easy to make and a great way to use all the broccoli growing at our home. I did use some extra thyme and some marjoram.

I was thinking that the soup may be a bit bland and the texture so-so given the ingredients, so I made a couple of adjustments and the soup ended up absolutely delicious! I added kale to the pot with the broccoli and a bit of wine in addition to the broth. I added three slices of baguette to the processor, and I finished it all off with just a touch of cream. I just love making soups, and will definitely be making this one again!

I read all the reviews before I made this and decided to modify this. I substituted yellow onions for leeks. I also added a heaping tsp of crushed red pepper and juice from half of a lemon. There was nothing bland about this soup. Before serving I topped with sharp shredded cheddar and broiled. My husband loved it, and he is the biggest food critic of all.

Great soup. I added some lentils to get some protein and bite, and to make it a bit more filling. I also added some bacon on top, and it was delicious.

This is one of the most unappetizing soups I've ever made/eaten. Green sludge is how I'd best describe it. I *tried* to eat it, not wanting to waste the quality ingredients I'd used (organic broccoli and broth), but 24- hours later, I threw the rest out. Disgusting. WON'T make it again. Evah.

Delicious. Based on other reviews, I actually made it too salty by using regular broth (not low-salt) and adding a tsp of salt in addition. Liked the addition of lemon juice as one reviewer recommended. Would definitely make again.

Have to agree with vidman that this didn't have much flavor. I added plenty of salt and still didn't love it. But I wanted to say that I also added some toasted walnuts and a dollop of ricotta, and those flavors and textures seemed to really complement the base. Maybe try those as add-ons if you already like the recipe...

This soup is very similar to the base for Mark Bittman's creamy vegetable soup, without the cream. Very minimalistic and delicious.

I really liked the creamy texture of this soup despite not using any cream. Some advice: Don't use a handheld immersion blender to puree the soup. I did at first and the texture was really gross. I then transferred the mixture to my VitaMix blender and it created a really nice smooth texture. Also, be sure you flavor this soup with enough salt and pepper to bring out all the flavors. My husband who doesn't care for broccoli too much even liked this soup.

I made this last night, I thought it was outstanding! I did add 1 TBS of fresh lemon juice, and it tasted wonderful! My husband really liked it, and it was fast, easy, and healthy!!

Super easy, and really tasty for such a simple recipe. I used vegetable broth and added fresh marjoram (happened to have some around), dried sage and red pepper flakes with the fresh thyme. Four cups of broth was sufficient for a thick consistency (how I prefer it). I used an immersion blender, and it worked out great.

Certainly easy enough. I think the fact that I had homemade chicken broth in the freezer added a big flavor boost. And over-peppering it may have helped, too. Healthy, dairy-free. My husband put in some homemade croutons.

This soup was bland. It does have a nice texture, as pointed out by kaitlinbell, but there's really not much flavor there. I used a rich homemade chicken stock, added extra salt; still bland.

A very healthy recipe; however it was quite bland. I added some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick and served it with a little cheddar cheese on top.

I just made this and was impressed that for 5 ingredients how good it turned out

This soup has a nice, thick, creamy texture, despite its healthy ingredients. I didn't have quite enough broccoli, so I added two russet potatoes, which I threw in for 10 minutes of boiling in the broth before adding the chopped broccoli. It says to use low-salt chicken broth, but I do think it could use some extra salt.
