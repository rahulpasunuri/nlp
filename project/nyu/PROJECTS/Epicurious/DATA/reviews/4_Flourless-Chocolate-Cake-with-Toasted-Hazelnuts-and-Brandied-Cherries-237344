This was hands-down the best and most impressive dessert I have ever made! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly; the only difference was that I skipped the cherries because I didn't have enough lead time to include them. The cake was phenomenal without them and lacked nothing, though next time maybe I'll plan ahead a little more... I will certainly be revisiting this recipe for special occasions many times.

I agree with Drew82 that the dairy aspects of the recipe did not work for my Passover supper. With that said i used margarine instead of butter and used a kind of mix of margarine and vegetable oil to make the ganache and it worked pretty well.

Don't want to ruin the rating, but just wanted to add that I wish they hadn't listed this as a "Passover Dessert" since it is not Parve (it includes dairy). So while it is "flourless" I don't see how this would be appropriate for a Passover Seder (personally have never heard of anyone doing a Dairy seder). Wish Epicurious paid more attention to Kosher rules when posting recipes for Jewish holidays.

I have made some pretty spectacular desserts, but this tops my list. I skipped the cherries, and used macadamias instead of hazelnuts. Otherwise made exactly as written, and it was amazing! My cake also collapsed a bit on the sides (I think the one in the photo did too - look carefully), but it was well hidden by the ganache and the nuts on the sides. Fabulous!

I was very impressed with this recipe. It was incredibly moist, rich, and not overly sweet. Like the first reviewer, I also had a problem with the cake *slumping* along the center but I have no doubt that I did something wrong along the way. I made a fudge buttercream icing, and filled the side in before pouring the ganache. I skipped the hazelnuts and cherries, due to allergies and time respectively, but the cake is fabulous enough to stand on it's own. I just topped with berries and mint sprigs.

The cake is impressive, with a light, melt- in-your-mouth sensation. Ganache was perfect. However, my difficulty came with the cake, itself. Horizontally, around the middle, the cake slumped, almost as if it were two layers stacked. I made extra ganache and filled it's 'waist- line' with ganache. The dried/rehydrated cherries taste quite good, but, their appearance is somewhat unappetizing - flat and brownish. Does anyone have any recommendations as to a 'type' of dehydrated cherry which might have a more appetizing appearance?

So I don't know if I did anything wrong but the ganache was not working for me! I made this for Easter dinner and was afraid I was going to have to go buy a cake because the cake was uneven/bumpy and the ganache wasn't coating. Luckily I'm quick on my feet and whipped the remaining heavy cream and evened it out that way and used the ganache chocolate to make swirly designs and decorated with raspberries (Based on time skipped the cherries). The end product was beautiful and tasted fantastic - was super rich though - was enough to serve 16 because you can't handle too big a piece.

This cake was moist and delicious, and a little lighter than other flourless cakes I've had. (Although that could be partially because I accidentally added an extra egg white.) It was very simple to make and a huge hit for Easter dinner. I skipped the brandied cherries because my in-laws don't drink and substituted a quick blackberry coulis. It was delicious, and people were anxious to take left over pieces home with them!

This has to be one of the best desserts I have made! Do not scrimp on the quality of the cherries (bing) or the quality of the brandy. Longer marination gives greater depth. Part whip cream and marscapone is a nice alternative to just plain whipped cream. DO MAKE AHEAD. Bon Ap[petit.
