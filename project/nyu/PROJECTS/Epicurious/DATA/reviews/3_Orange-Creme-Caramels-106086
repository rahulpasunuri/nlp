This recipe is easy to execute. The most time consuming thing is grating the orange peel. Made it twice in one week, even works with a soymilk as a sub, though not as rich. YUM!!!

I made this as a dessert this christmas for my family. They loved it, but I found it too sweet. I would reduce the sugar next time, and maybe garnish with a little fresh oj, as well

I made these with tangerines and they were superb! I used a bit less sugar in the custards and they came out not too sweet. My husband ate three in one sitting! I highly recommend this recipe!

A favorite in my house since 92. Easy to prepare -- the orange peel adds just the right texture and tart. (and mine looks just like the picture!)

I followed some suggestions and reduced the sugar - and still way too sweet! the sweetness was so overpowering it was hard to enjoy the custard. The best creme dishes are subtle in flavoring to let the richness come through. I think the orange flavor maybe would have been better in the custard and not the caramel. I will not make this again although it was edible, not enjoyable.

The caramel was way too thin, and broke when the custard was poured atop it, and the recipe was too voluminous for a 9 inch pie plate (what was suggested if one single caramel was made.) Clearly needs more testing before publishing.

Having trouble with the carmel layer - the first time I undercooked and the carmel layer was just watery - 2nd time it stayed in the ramekin and is very thick. What am I doing wrong?

Fantastic! The caramelization of the sugar, added to the orange juice, gives a very sophisticated taste to this simple technique.

toooooo sweet!!!!I wouldn't try it again with less sugar; too many other custard/creme/flan recipies available.
