These were good ... but not great. However that may be because I didn't use the onion. It needed some bite but I can't use onion. Think if I can figure something else out to use it will elevate to great. Nonetheless it was a pleasant appetizer as part of a quick and simple meal.

Tried this for a party, served in shotglasses with bamboo forks, passed on a tray. It was a big hit, but a couple concerns: The recipe doesn't tell you how many servings this recipe yields, so it's tough to determine how much of everything to buy; Mixing all the ingredients in a big bag tended to mush the avacado. Suggest mixing in a big bowl gently, then maybe transferring it to a big bag; They were easy to make ahead of time and stack on cookie sheets in the fridge. Also, The Webstaurant Store sells bamboo forks online. If I made it again, I would try the shrimp idea from the other reviewer.

Where do you get bamboo forks in Portland?

Fresh and delicious. I added julienned jicama and a splash of Trader Joe's champagne orange vinaigrette. I also riffed on the recipe and did a shrimp, blood orange, jicama & avocado dish. I served it in small glass cups, with bamboo forks (so much nicer than plastic!) and froze a layer of ice in the serving platter to keep things chilled. Simple and wonderful!
