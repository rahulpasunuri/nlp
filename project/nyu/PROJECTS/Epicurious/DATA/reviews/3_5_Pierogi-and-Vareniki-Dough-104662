I was making pierogi for my husband for the first time and decided to use this recipe for the dough since it had such great reviews. I was so disappointed in the dough that I threw away the dumplings I had made and used a different recipe.

I wanted to love this recipe, but it was barely 'okay' in my books. A couple of issues with it, it had a crepe-y texture once cooked, a bit chewy and stretchy and I'm sure I tasted the eggs. The recipe also doesn't make a large yield - far less than than the 48 indicated, and I did roll them thinly. Perhaps I made them double sized, but I used my existing dough cutter. I grew up in a Polish neighbourhood and have had (made) some great pierogies over the years. These were - meh.... I won't make them again

I was tired of the inedible, tough, rubbery, leaden, hockey puck pierogies that my husband's Ukrainian family devours. (I'm Italian) So I thought I would make some sauerkraut and boletus (porcini) mushroom pierogis and found this dough. THEY WERE FANTASTIC!!!. The cake flour is the secret ingredient as is not using egg wash to seal the pierogies (use just water or milk) and rolling it out thin. Of course, only my husband and I thought they were delicious. Pity for them. I will certainly make them again for my more discerning guests.

Forgot to add--I couldn't find cake flour so just used all-purpose for the whole thing. Still worked fine.

I made pierogies using this dough for my fiance, who grew up eating his russian grandmother's pierogies, and he claims that the dough was just like hers. I still need to work on figuring out what her recipe for the potato/cheese filling was, but I'm amazed that I mastered the dough so fast--this is the part that I thought would be difficult! I couldn't believe that the recipe worked so well on the first try.

This dough is fabulous, easy to work with and tasty. I baked my pierogi instead of boiling, and the results were great. Kids loved it!

I double this recipe to make approx 60 pierogies for Polish Wigilia. I am completely NOT dough savvy, so just one thing I would do differently next time: if doubling, take the total amount of dough and split into 4 portions. Work each separately. I over-worked my dough the first time around and it became very tough towards the end.

While making this dough was labor intensive, it was easy to work with and make UNBELIEVABLE pierogies (I filled them with a mixture of potatoes, butter, onions, garlic, cream cheese, cheddar, and bacon). For a thinner dough, I gave it an extra roll after cutting the circles. This recipe only yeilded 21 three inchers. Next time, I will double the recipe and try making it in the food processor to cut down on time.

This is indeed the best pierogi dough recipe I on the internet! Really worth trying! (P.S.: To the Cook whose grandma who used to be a chef to Polish king: congratulation on longevity in your family! The last Polish king ended his rule in 1795. :o) )

I have tried many times to duplicate my grandmother's (baba in Ukrainian) pierogi dough using her recipe and the dough was always too hard. When I found this recipe I figured I would give it a shot. The additional of the cake flour makes all the difference, they come out soft and wonderful almost as good as my grandmother's. The dough is very easy to work with and does not break when boiling.

This dough is really easy to work and if you feel like it's getting a bit tough, just step back, let it rest for a couple minutes, and by then it'll be ready for you again.

This is really similar to my great grandmother's recipe (who, believe it or not, used to be one of the cooks for the king of Poland). The cake flour is necessary to give the dough that satiny, even roll-out that are made more difficult with the addition of cream cheese, sour cream (what else have I heard). NOTE: The addition of carregean gums and milk products only give the dough flakiness and ease of breakability. Dairy is not needed. Great Recipe!

I made pierogies with this recipe and they turned out really well, no breaking up while boiling, easy to manage. It only made 36 of them, however, using a drinking glass as the dough cutter (your average pierogi size). Worth trying! A pasta maker would help quite a bit.

I've made peroghies many times using my grandmother's recipe and was tempted to return to the tried-and-true when trying the mushroom recipe on this site. But: this was a delightful dough, it handled well, rolled very thin and had no breaks during the boiling process. Try it!
