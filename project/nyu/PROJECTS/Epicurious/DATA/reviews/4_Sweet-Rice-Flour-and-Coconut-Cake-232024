I made this and I looked at all the reviews about how the crunchy sides were the best, so I made this and split the batter between two sheet pans (ungreased). I think it spent about an hour and ten minutes or a little more in the oven until it looked like a big sugar cookie. IT WAS AMAZING!!! The crunchy edges are SO GOOD and the middle is a little like thin sponge cake. I will make this on a regular basis whenever I want a treat. This was especially reminiscent of a vanilla sugar cookie, which is what I miss the most now that I cannot eat gluten!

Horrid. No flavor. texture of clay. Easier to just eat spoonfuls of sugar.

Sadly, there isn't a "zero fork" rating. This dish was disgusting. A pan full of sugar that tasted, even with the addition of unsweetened coconut flakes, like baked eggs and rice. Ugh.

I thought this was delicious, and I stuck pretty closely to the original recipe. I chose to bake it in a metal cupcake pan (very lightly greased), which increased the edges and the delicious crispiness everyone's talking about. I also added a pinch of shredded coconut to the tops of the individual cups, and baked for ~75 minutes (less than called for) given the higher surface area to volume ration of the cupcake pan. Yum!

A really nice gluten-free treat. Only additions were black sesame seeds and some shredded (unsweetened) coconut on top; I make it in a shallow and wide pan to maximize crispy edges. The texture seems odd at first, but it's hard to stop eating it. Best the day it is made for the texture contrast... crispy bits get soft on day two, but it is still tasty.

a classic and easy Filipino dessert!

I was skeptical about the 1.5 hour baking time but it did produce a yummy crust! I sprinkled white sesame seeds on top- which made it pretty and added another layer of flavor- yum.

Delicious. I love the contrast of the chewy cake and crisp sugary crust. I think next time I might reduce the amount of sugar and bake it in a shallower pan to get more delicious edging, which is certainly the best part.

This is the bomb! I told my picky 11 yr old that it was coconut cake and she loved it. I added 1 cup of shredded coconut. I will make this again. Thank you

In case you were wondering, yes, you can make this with regular rice flour if you don't have mochiko. I made it this way last night. The texture wasn't quite as chewy, but the taste was the same--delicious! Overall, the mochiko version is better, but those who can only get white rice flour should still make this. It cooks a bit faster with rice flour, so watch it carefully.

I made only half this recipe (with 3 eggs) because I was afraid it would be too much like a buttery bar cookie, which I dislike, but it far exceeded my expectations. It was really delicious with a fantastic texture, and rich without being too buttery or cloyingly sweet. Everyone enjoyed it, and we seldom agree on desserts. If you're timid and bake only half the recipe, use an 8x8 glass dish, grease the bottom well, and bake for about 70 minutes.

This turned out interesting. It wasn't bad. I agree that the edges were the best part - they tasted kind of cookie bar- ish. The middle was a very interesting texture. I'm glad I made it, but I wouldn't make it again. Also, despite the coconut milk, I didn't think it had a lot of coconut flavor.

Very yummy. Halved the recipe. Used 1C sugar, 3 eggs, veg shortening for butter. Added 1/4C unsweet coconut to batter and sprinkled some on top. Great for a gluten and dairy free dessert. My mainstream hubbie enjoyed it also.

People who were not familiar with the texture of rice flour tried to spit it out after taking a bite, but the taste ended up winning them over. I heard a lot of "this consistency is so nasty, but it tastes soooo good". Now that my audience is primed I would definitely make this again, it fills the whole house with a fabulous smell, and has all the trappings of a comfort food.

Not only would I make this again, I am going to do it right now after I reprint this recipe. Moist, chewy and delicious and very tempting to hoard it for myself.

As others have mentioned, the chewy, buttery edges are even better than the rich interior. It reminds me of the Asian sweets I would have as a child and all the happy occasions when they were served. To maximize the surface area of the crust, consider baking the batter in muffin tins. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Everyone thought this was great even though I accidentally made it in a pan that was too small. Even my brother in law who hates all things that are not meat, potatoes, and chocolate cake thought this was good enough to eat second and thirds

Wonderful and easy. I made it in a square baking dish, cut into cubes, and served in decorative papers as part of dessert buffet. As they were the first to go and none were left, I assume my guests enjoyed them...

I made this for a family function and it was very good. Previous review mention that the edges are delicious and I concur. Great coconut flavor.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. Growing up in Hawaii, butter mochi was a staple treat of my childhood - but this is by far the best I've had. To cut on the fat, I use low fat milk and add coconut extract - honestly I think it is better, more coconut-y - and I usually have milk on hand (cheaper too). I agree that the best part is the burned edges - I leave it in until it gets very crispy.

As I don't like overly sweet desserts, I cut the sugar to about 3/4 cup and added sweetened shredded coconut to the batter as well as on top, just before baking. Amazing. It's like a chewy coconut custard you just can't stop eating. You've got to try this ...

It's delicious, incredible, I could not stop eating it one fattening sliver at a time. I made it initally as a first birthday cake fror my daughter who's allergic to milk, and served it with powdered sugar sprinkled all over because it was not very attractive au naturel. I made it once or twice more because I am not chubby enough (yes, kidding.) Anyone who likes sticky rice type asian meals/desserts will love this for sure.

This was an awesome dessert for my Celiac father-in-law, in fact the whole family loved it. It didn't taste chalky, like some gluten-free cakes can. We will do it often, as it was easy to do as well.

I grew up eating a variety of Korean and Japanese treats made with sweet rice flour and so am both familiar and comfortable with the taste and texture of rice cake. This cake, however, blew past my expectations and sits in a wholly different plane. It is so simple a mix of flavors, yet I agree with the other reviewers that it is very addictive. I especially love the crunchy/chewy browned top and sides. I plan to make this again (tonight, actually) and this time to split the batter between two pans, reducing the cooking time, in order to get a higher topping-to-inside ratio.

I served this - along with the Passion Fruit Nieve from the same Gourmet issue - at a fund-raising lunch, and it was an unqualified success. Everyone loved it and kept coming back for more! The consistency and texture are very unusual but appealing, and it's totally delicious. Incidently, while buying coconut milk at an Asian supermarket I noticed that the fat content varied widely. I made one batch of cake from a lower fat - but not "light" milk - and one from a high fat content milk. The higher fat milk had a much more coconutty taste and made the better cake.

had never tried anything like this before and everyone loved it! it's sort of addictive, actually.
