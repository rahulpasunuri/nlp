I've tried these before and they were good, but this time I didn't have any buttermilk or molasses. I modified the recipe and reviewed it here: http://sctosf.com/pumpkin-walnut-muffins/ These turned out just as good!

A great recipe - it made very moist and yummy muffins. I didn't have dates on hand so I substituted in currants. I'd love to try again with dates. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe in that it's fairly flexible. I change a lot of things too and they still turned out great. Doubled the spices, used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk (because they only sell it around here in large quantities and I didn't want to make any), 1 cup of pumpkin puree (homemade, leftover from a pie), 1/2 c white flour, 1 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup oats, and maple syrup instead of molasses. I also used raisins and pecans instead of dates and walnuts, and also sprinkled pepitas on top. How's that for an annoying review? :) Anyway, the point is that you can't screw it up. And everyone appreciates a recipe like that.

Loved them! Used raisins instead of dates. I'll try to cut butter, and add flax meal next time. Thanks!!

These muffins were really good. If I could give them three and a half forks I would, but they were just a tad on the dry side so not quite four. Very flavorful, though. Would consider adding more pumpkin and switching margarine or crisco for butter for more moisture.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I've modified it by replacing 3/4 cup of the white flour with about 3/8 cup of oat bran and 3/8 cup of wheat bran and it is still delicious. I put the nuts on top and I use pecans most of the time. Always delicious!

This is an easy, very forgiving recipe. So glad I finally made it. Like many reviewers, I cut the butter in half, using 4 TBs in all. Because I reduced the butter, I added 1/4 cup additional liquid. So, if you are reducing the fat by 1/4 add, e.g., 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of 1/4. I love buttermilk, but because I was out of it, used Rice Dream. Other substitutions -- because of necessity not design -- were: I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of regular white whole wheat flour; pecans instead walnuts; 1 cup (not 3/4) of fresh (not canned) pumpkin. Also, I soaked the dates in warm water before adding them into the batter. Sprinkled 1-2 tsp sugar (turbinado) over the tops of the muffins before baking for 24 minutes. OH, I FORGOT the molasses, which I love and had in the cupboard. No matter, muffins were great. Forgiving recipe!

I gave this recipe 3 stars, but it's worth 3.5 really, especially if you're a big pumpkin & spice fan. Very tasty, fluffy, but could have been a little more moist ... goes great with a glass of cold milk. Would definitely make it again.

These turned out fabulously! I did change it a little....I used 1/2 cup of yogurt instead of the buttermilk, 1 cup of steamed pumpkin and 1/2 the amount of butter. Also 2 tablespoons of some flaxmeal, and half the flour was brown rice. I added some green raisins, and chopped up almond slivers, walnuts and pistachios for texture and some choc. chips to keep my kids happy. Fantastic, I will make them again...

I used golden raisins, and pecans instead of dates and walnuts still lots of flavor very nice yummy, Will try with walnuts next time as they will add a real nutty flavor.

As a college student, my resources are limited, so that's why I made the following changes - I cut the amount of butter in half, and used an entire can of pumpkin. I only had cinnamon, so I just doubled the amount of cinnamon and skipped the other spices. I had to sub in yogurt for buttermilk and I didn't have molasses on hand, so I just skipped it. I also stirred the walnuts in the batter. I made this as a bread by baking it at 325 for an hour in a loaf pan. Still turned out absolutely delicious. The dates are a must. So good. I wish I had the other spices on hand, I bet that would've made it even better.

This is about the 5th time I've made these muffins. I love them. This time I reduced the whole wheat and added some oats and flaxseed meal. They turned out great.

Normally I don't review a recipe if I make changes, but mine were minimal and didn't impact the overall result. I've made these several times since Thanksgiving. Since I was going for those holiday flavors I switched out the dates for dried cranberries and the molasses for maple syrup. I also just mixed the nuts into the batter to make life easier. Delicious and moist whether made as muffins or bread. The bread was even better when toasted and spread with cream cheese:) I'm glad I ignored the reviews which said they're dry, anything but!

Rating: 1
I had read through the reviews and made a few recommended changes to this recipe and was a bit disappointed. Reduced the molasses by 1 tablespoon and substituted the buttermilk with 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream (I am always left with and waste a lot of buttermilk whenever I buy it for a recipe) and the muffins came out really dry. I am searching for the perfect pumpkin muffin recipe and sorry to say my quest still continues...

Rating: 4
Yummy! Because so many others here had omitted dates with success and I was feeling lazy, I did so too. They are indeed excellent without them--just sweet enough and with a tender, moist crumb. White whole wheat flour is a good subtle choice for the whole wheat flour. I also added pepitas along with walnuts; they contributed nicely to the flavor and texture. I'll be making these again for sure, maybe even trying the batter as a bundt cake sometime.

I have been making the same pumpkin muffin recipe for 10 years and decided to try this one. I added chocolate chips and skipped the dates, and have a new winner. Really moist and delicious. The buttermilk lends the perfect balance, get the real stuff! I keep bags of them in the freezer because they thaw in minutes.

Rating: 3
These are good. I make muffins every week & these are my boyfriend's favorite. Only changes I make are to up the pumpkin to 1 cup & mix in nuts - still sprinkle a few on top. I am also generous with the spice measurements. These are not too light & fluffy but not heavy for pumpkin. Be careful not to overbake so they stay moist. These muffins double & freeze well. Running out the door for breakfast these are good, toasted or warm with butter these are gorgeous! The flavors develop after the first day so these are perfect if you don't plan to eat them straight out of the oven, when they seem a little bland to me.

Rating: 3
These are quite good but I did fool around with the recipe. I used 1 cup roasted butternut squash, 1/2 cup of oil and closer to 1/2cup of Buttermilk. Dried cranberries were good instead of raisins. 1/2 the amount of sugar was more than enough. Will definitely add this to my muffin repertoire.

Rating: 3
These muffins really grew on me-- they were more moist and delicious at room temp the next day than they were straight from the oven. I omitted the dates, figuring my kids would balk, but added a light cinnamon/sugar combo on top of the nuts. Perfect. I like that these aren't too sweet and include some whole wheat flour; make them a better choice for breakfast and snacks than muffins with a lot of refined flour/white sugar. These are more like pumpkin bread, not the sweet, greasy, cake-like muffins you would get from the mass-market bakery in a grocery store chain. Still, I wouldnn't say these muffins were dry at all. Just had one with a bowl of lentil soup for lunch. Yum!

Rating: 4
Excellent muffins. I increase the buttermilk to 1/2 cup (or use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk) because I find it takes a little too long to mix them otherwise and that can make muffins tough. Instead of the dates and walnuts, I do 1/2 cup each of chopped walnuts, dried cranberries and chocolate chips...and I top them with a few raw pumpkin seeds before they go in the oven. I've tried them with pecans too, and while I personally love pecans and am iffy about walnuts, for some reason walnuts work better in this recipe. If I ran a cafe, these would be my signature muffin...they're a little bit different and everybody loves them.

Rating: 4
These were great. I thought they tasted better the day after they were baked than fresh out of the oven, and they stayed moist for several days in an airtight container at room temp. I substituted semisweet chocolate chips for the dates, 2 T sour cream / 2 T milk for the buttermilk, and (per previous reviews) used a little more than 1 cup of pumpkin.

I have made these muffins for years as well as several other pumpkin muffin recipes. These are definitely the best - wouldn't change a thing.

Good recipe, but I thought the molasses was a bit overpowering. Next time I think I'll cut it by half or more. Also, I used fresh-roasted pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which didn't impart as much pumpkin flavor to the muffins as I would have liked. I'm going to try increasing the pumpkin ratio next time I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned.

Beautiful muffins. Moist - tasty. I did not add the dates. I will probably mix some walnuts into the batter next time and increase the spices. 20 minutes was perfect for my oven. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was wonderful: moist, flavourful, with just the right amount of sweetness. Instead of dates and nuts, we added 1 chopped, peeled Granny Smith apple, which gave the muffin additional moistness and texture. This is definitely a keeper!

I write recipes and bake lots of muffins and quickbreads. This is a great recipe. If you have a convection oven, lower the temperature to 375 so you don't overbake. Pay attention to baking times too; take out the muffins when they are still moist on top. I used FRESH dates chopped with a bit of flour. These muffins came out perfectly sweet and moist with a nice high domed top. I did add my own simple topping of finely chopped pecans and brown sugar.

I made this recipe as written, except I used a whole cup of pumpkin and substituted dried cherries for the dates. These were extremely moist baked for 20 minutes, I would not go over that time. I really, really, really, liked these muffins!

EXCEPTIONAL muffins! I was really surprised at how good these were. I used 1 c. of pumpkin and omitted the walnuts (food allergy) and dates (kids hate them). These were some of the moistest, most flavorful muffins I have ever made. Even my one son who hates pumpkin of any sort at half a dozen himself! I love the molasses in the recipe, and I think it makes all the difference. These muffins are definitely keepers and will be on my "A-list" for gift-giving and entertaining.

I made these as healthy as I could without sacrificing too much of the flavor. Used all white whole wheat (King Arthur), 1 egg and 2 egg whites, half butter, half applesauce, splenda brown sugar blend, 2/3 cup raisins, and fat-free buttermilk. Sprinkled 1/2 cup of chopped hazelnuts on top, they came out great, a little bit on the dry side. Next time I may try a different dried fruit because the raisins didn't plump up as much as I would have hoped and I'll probably increase the amount of pumpkin in the batter. The amount of spice was perfect for my family.

Rating: 4
A wonderful recipe with my substitutions. These muffins are good enough to give away at holiday time. I made some changes to eliminate the refined sugar and cut back on the white flour. Here are my variations: I used a full 15oz. can of pumpkin (no fresh available right now), 1/4 cup soy milk instead of buttermilk, 3TB organic apple butter for the molasses, reduced white flour to 1/2 cup and used 1 1/2 cups King Arthur Whole Wheat flour, I added 1/4 cup toasted wheat germ, increased baking powder to 2 tsp., substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar, used only 1/4 cup each of chopped dates and walnuts, and heaping measurements of all spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg). I lightly greased the muffin tin and baked the muffins for about 25-27 minutes (gas oven). The muffins were moist and filled with flavor. The only thing missing was something more to chew on, like raisins and/or coconut. I plan to experiment some more ...

I would be willing to bet the farm on the hunch that those bakers complaining about dry tasteless muffins neglected to add chopped dates to their batter. It seems like an optional ingredient but I think that the soft moisture and sweetness of the dried fruit compliment the pumpkin flavor and soften the finished texture. I doubled the batch and in doing so made it a bit more hippie-dippie-healthie: Used 2 eggs and a tablespoon of baking powder, 2 cups of philadelphia farmers market baked pumpkin (canned pumpkin is depressing, people), orange juice in place of buttermilk, the ground seeds of two cardamom pods and a dash of cloves as the spice, a scant two tablespoons of butter, and generous amount of good quality organic dates which I pitted and chopped just before adding them to the mix (I think dried apricots or pears would also work well). I replaced a cup of the flour with oats and tossed in some wheat germ. I used perhaps a quarter of a teaspoon of stevia extract and added no sugar at all to the batter. It was my first experiment baking with this natural sweetener and I am very pleased with the results. I pressed a tasty streusel into their tops before they went in the oven: In a food processor combine 1/3 c raw nuts (I used cashews), 2 tbl each flour, melted butter, and brown sugar. Season with plenty of salt and nutmeg to taste. It could use some sort of binder(a bit of brown rice/maple syrup? more chopped dates?)or perhaps fewer nuts. As it is they are deliciously messy.

I don't know why reviewers are complaining of it being dry, maybe there are overmixing them. Delicious, sweet, tasty muffins. I mixed 2/3 of the pecans inside the mix and sprinkled the rest on top. a keeper....

These were great, I wonder why Valerie's turned out dry. I didn't have dates, so used raisins instead; otherwise followed the recipe as written (2 cups all-purpose flour) except adding nuts to the batter rather than sprinkling on top. Lovely fall flavors, nice spice balance . . . my guests really liked them. Quick to make, too.

Despite the generally positive reviews I found this recipe a great disappointment. Although I only cooked the muffins for the minimum time- 20 mins.- they were still very dry fresh out of the oven. Additionally, the taste was very bland in my estimation. Given all the butter, sugar, and eggs, it must be possible to find a recipe that can deliver a better taste for comparable calories and fat.

These muffins were delicious. The smell in my apartment was amazing as they baked, and they tasted just as good once they came out of the oven. Like many other reviewers, I put the walnuts inside the muffins, so I toasted them a little bit first. I made two batches; the second batch I made six jumbo muffins, which were much more visually appealing, but the first batch of 12 are probably better portions for a snack.

These muffins were amazing. It was easy to prepare and my kids loved them. My son apologized to me after eating two and told me I would have to make more soon because they weren't going to last. Re: the recipe I made the following adjustments to it based on other reviews: I substituted 1/4 cup applesuace and 1/4 cup melted butter instead for the 1 stick butter. Instead of 3 tbsps molasses, I used 1 tbsp each of apple butter, brown sugar and pure maple syrup and I omitted the walnuts.

I found these muffins to be moist, dense, and delicious!! The changes I made were (1) to cut down to 2T of molassses and to substitute 1T of brown sugar for the third tablespoon of molasses, which I think turned to be a good thing because the molasses flavor is strong; (2) to incorporate chopped walnuts into the batter as well as on top; and (3) to omit the dates. The muffins got rave reviews, my mother and husband devoured them, and I will most definitely make this recipe again.

Tasty, wholesome breakfast food. I used mostly organic ingredients. I think next time I might try to use maple syrup and maple sugar in lieu of molasses and some of the brown sugar. I added most of the walnuts to the batter, but left some for the topping. For me the yield was perfect - exactly 12 muffin tins (1/2 cup size).

This is one of the better pumpkin bread/muffin recipes on this site. I had just enough buttermilk, nuts (pumpkin seeds) and pumpkin for the recipe - a great way to use it up. I used oil instead of butter, and a lot less of it, upping the buttermilk instead. The muffins turned out quite moist, which I like. The recipe yields 6 large muffins, and 6 mini muffins.

Had to make substitutions as it was a last minute decision to make muffins this morning. So, I used what I had on hand - dried cranberries for dates and toasted pecans for walnuts. I also put the nuts inside instead of outside to minimize their visibility, so my two little boys would try them. These are absolutely delicious. My pickier son ate two of them right away, which is amazing. These would be especially nice in the autumn, but were a welcome treat on a cold and rainy Saturday morning. It is also a great way to use up a little extra canned pumpkin, which we always seem to have on hand.

I made these on a snowy Saturday, and the lovely autumn smell filled my apartment and made me forget the blizzard outside. This was my first attempt and I'm thrilled! This is a hearty and delicious muffin, very easy to make. I made 7 larger muffins rather than the smaller ones, left out the walnuts and substituted raisins for dates (though I may use dates next time). These muffins even pleased a friend who's "not crazy about pumpkin," in his words. I think I'll make more this week...wonderful.

These were wonderful! Seeing as how it is pumpkin season, I will be making these again and again! I used fresh pumpkin, boiled and then mashed. I took others' suggestions and substituted applesauce for half of the butter called for, and used apple butter instead of molasses. I also used nonfat milk to cut down on the fat even more. I probably used about 1.5 cups of fresh pumpkin, so I increased the amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I also left out the dates and walnuts. Tasted just like pumpkin pie!

I had a yen for pumpkin--this completely satisfied it. I've made them twice this week and was asked if I would keep a steady supply at work. I did substitute 1T of apple butter for 1T of molasses since I find molasses can be a bit overwhelming. I also made a few modifications for high altitude cooking. Other than that, I made them as written--very yummy!

I followed another cook's recommendation and used equal parts canola oil and apple sauce to replace the butter and didn't miss the extra fat at all. I also used all whole wheat flour in place of the white whole wheat and thought they turned out great. They were a hit with our breakfast guests on Thanksgiving Day!

I cut the fat in half and used 1/4 cup of canola oil. I also substituted 1/4 cup of flax meal for 1/4 of the flour. And used all whole wheat flour. Used grated ginger instead of dry.
