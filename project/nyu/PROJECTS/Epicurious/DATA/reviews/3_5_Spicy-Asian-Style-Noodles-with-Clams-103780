I just made this last night. When I tasted the broth, I found it a bit lacking in balance as in a prior review, since asian food should have a nice mix of hot, sour, salty and sweet. I added some lime juice, a splash of thai fish sauce and some sugar. I think it really improve the broth. It turned out yummy. Next time I will also use fish stock instead of water, for a additional layer of flavor.

What a wonderful recipe. Spicey, yet delicious. My college age daughter thought that this was great. I used canned clams instead of the fresh. It was all that I had at the time. I served this with a mixed green salad and garlic bread.

I have been making this dish for several yrs. My hubby and I LOVE it. I did substitute the water for chicken stock...we think it makes a better "sauce".

NICE!! We followed the recipe exactly except for substituting shucked chowder clams and their juices for the small clams in the shell. We wondered if the water would still be necessary and it was, though maybe not a whole cup. These flavors are a fine example of spicy, not hot. A Riesling was a good match.

This was a nice change from Italian spaghetti with clam sauce, my usual use for this ingredient combo. However, I see no reason not to use authentic Chinese "lo mein" as opposed to Italian pasta - the real thing is ubiquitous, even in Luxembourg. I used what in the US are called "baby clams" but here are sold fresh as "cocques". (US-type clams do not exist here). Also the fresh cilantro is a must. Could have been spicier. Next time I'll be more aggressive with the hot pepper.

I finally tried this recipe and will make it a habit. Instead of fresh clams, I used the can variety.

Actually, 2.5 forks. The sauce and clams were awesome: skip the noodles unless you have an asian-style noodle.

I make a lot of Asian dishes and didn't care for this recipe as is, which surprised me because of all the great reviews. I found it kind of "sour", I guess because of the vinegar. I did, however, make some changes and it turned out great. Since I used 5 lbs. of clams I doubled the recipe. But next time I will not double the amount of red pepper flakes. It was very spicy (and I do like spicy food)! I used dry white wine instead of water. I added a can of Thai style coconut milk (low fat) and curry powder and cumin powder to taste. It was as good as some of the Thai restaurant steamed clams I've had recently. Everyone raved about it. So although I'm giving this recipe only two forks, I think if you play with it you can bring up to 4.

The broth was amazing, I ran out of bread! Next time I want to prepare the clams as the recipe states, leave out the pasta and sop up the juice with a great crusty bread!

Absolutely perfect. Easy and fast to prepare. Great combinations of flavor not to spicy, not to sweet and not to salty. Can't wait to make it again! I used angel hair pasta because I had it on hand.

I made this dish with one change: I didn't have vermicelli pasta - I only had thai noodles. This dish was excellent. The flavors of the sesame oil, soy and rice vinegar worked perfectly together. Buying 24 clams was a bit expensive so I only bought half. Maybe next time I will buy a can of whole belly clams along with a dozen fresh ones. Can't wait to make this again!

Really great! Easy to make, beautiful and very flavorful. I'll add this to my repertoire.

This dish is the perfect light supper and takes minimal time to prepare. I returned the cooked and drained pasta to the pot I cooked it in and tossed it with the oil; it was easier to keep it warm while I finished the sauce in a separate skillet. Used a lot more garlic than called for and it was not overwhelming but added to the flavor of the broth. Good with a fruity white wine like gewurtztraminer or reisling. A definite keeper!

the dish ended up taking a fair amount of time and just non descript in its result.

to make the sauce a little more saucy or liquidy I added 1/3C of white wine.
