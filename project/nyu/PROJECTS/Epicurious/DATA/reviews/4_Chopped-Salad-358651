Yum. We liked the dressing.

This is my go to salad for elegance and flavor at a dinner party. Chopping the ingredients is time consuming but well worth the effort and can be done a day in advance. There has been no one in the 4 times I have prepared this who did not find it the perfect combination of flavors.

This salad had some interest with the olives and green beans and the herbs added some freshness and it was good, but not amazing.

Loved the combination of flavors though I did skip the marjoram. Not certain the parsley brought anything but the dill was nice.

The fresh herbs make this salad but the iceberg lettuce brings it down. Next time I'll use a really crisp romaine. I think radishes would be a nice touch also. I also blanched the beans.

A very interesting and flavorful salad. I went light on the dressing which worked great just to add a little moisture and additional flavor. I used jarred Roasted Marinated Peppers and Kalamata olives for the black olives. Couldn't find fresh marjoram so added a few dried flakes to the dressing.

Loved the salad, ditch the dressing. Would try a ginger dressing next time.

I love this salad, and have made it several times over the last few weeks. Unfortunately, my children do not like it (it is too heavy on the vinegar and olives for their tastes). I have made this salad as written, but have also used romaine lettuce. I also add in blue cheese sometimes.

Excellent recipe! It got rave reviews from everyone at the party.

Good make-ahead recipe for a crowd. I just kept chopping til I thought I had enough and added the dressing just before serving. I added pepperoncini's which gave it a nice zing.

This is absolutely delicious. I have made this for three events this summer and everyone raves. I did have to use regular string beans and I sliced then almost jullienne and they were fine. Also cut back a bit on marjoram. It's easy to adjust this to individual taste preferences. And even the next day, it's a bit more like coleslaw, but it's wonderful. Bravo

I've made this salad several times and it is excellent - crispy and tangy. It's also very easy to make in a hurry. I garnished with some cherry peppers to give it a bit more colour and a lot more zing!

Yep, this is a delicious recipe. I also made over Memorial weekend, I multiplied the recipe by 2.5 times for 15 people and thought I had waaaay to much, but it was just about gone by the end of the meal. Nice to chop ingredients ahead of time, make dressing, and throw it all together at the last minute. Served with blue cheese on the side.

I made this salad over the Memorial Weekend as a side dish. Everyone loved it. In fact it was soooo good I was asked to make it the next night as well. The fresh herbs are what really makes it delish.

Simply delicious! Such a tasty salad and so healthy (only used the 1/2 cup of olive oil). Loved using all the fresh herbs, followed the recipe exactly. Served for a dinner party of 4 with bbq'd shish kebobs and quinoa. A total hit!

Loved this salad, I quadrupled the recipe and served with smoked brisket to a crowd of 20 - it was exceptional. I added blue cheese, but that is certainly not needed. You can definitely play around with the ingredients on this one. It went wonderfully with the rich brisket. Had lots of dressing leftover.

very excellent, simple & easy salad! we served it along side grilled veg & steak & was awesome! my store didnt have haricot verts this weekend, I used sugar snap peas just washed & diced & was great

Looks tasty. If haricots verts are not available, blanching green beans 'til crisp tender, then chilling should also work.

Haricots verts are the thin little green beans that probably work better raw than standard green beans would.

Haricots verts? Why don't you just say green beans?

Very nice salad indeed. I added some halved grape tomatoes and pine nuts and garnished with very thin slices of Meyers lemons. Yum would be nice as a main dish topped with grilled salmon.

This is simply delicious. I do like a little gorgonzola or blue cheese mixed with the salad. Heavenly with some crusty bread. Such a wonderful meal.

I haven't tried this yet, but want to this weekend. After that I will write a review. Sounds good!

Simple elegance, I am loving the chopped salad craze that is happening. I am tired of large size salad pieces that are embarassing to eat.
