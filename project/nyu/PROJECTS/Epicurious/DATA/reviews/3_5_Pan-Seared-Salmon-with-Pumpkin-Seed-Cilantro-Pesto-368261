This pesto is fantastic. It goes with anything. Salmon is a nice choice. But I have also eaten it with shrimp and pasta, chicken, and other white fish. I even think it would be good on steak.

The pesto in this recipe is delicious. A nice twist on traditional pesto. That being said, I think it would go even better with a less flavorful/fatty fish like a white fish. The salmon and pesto together was just a bit too oily and intense for our liking so while the pesto is a keeper we'll likely pair it with something else in the future. It was delicious a few days later over fried eggs and heirloom tomatoes though! Suzanne www.savorygirl.com

Loved this recipe - so easy. Have made without coriander seeds when I don't have them, and have also put the pesto on spaghetti squash.

Wonderful recipe, wouldn't change a thing. Goes really well with the 5 spice beet soup. Used kosher salt and cracked pepper on the salmon.

Whole family loved this! We served it on quinoa that we had cooked in chicken broth, garlic, and ginger. Very tasty!

I agree with the Test Kitchen. This is delightful because of its ease of preparation and interesting spice combination. The pepitas lend a tasty crunch. This is a great recipe for non-grilled salmon.

Wonderful recipe. Love the pesto and will be using it with many other dishes. This was easy and flavorful. A keeper!

The pesto was so good I couldn't stop eating it. I just love anything made with pumpkin seeds. The flavor was mellow and perfectly seasoned without adding additional lime juice. I could have cooked the salmon better such as in a nonstick pan which seems to put a better crust on the skin and color on the flesh without drowning in oil or maybe I didn't use enough oil in my cast iron pan. And I think I will season the salmon a bit stronger with a touch of garlic powder and more salt too. I will make this again!

This sounds delicious but I can't find shelled pumpkin seeds. Any suggestions?

My family loved this recipe. The pepita's made a huge difference. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was just okay. First, the pumpkin seeds, which I roasted first, didn't have a lot of flavor so the pesto just tasted like cilantro and lime. The pistachio pesto recipe on this site is much more flavorful. Also, the salmon seemed too rich for the pesto -- perhaps because of the amount of olive oil. I have some pesto left over and I may try it on a grilled pork tenderloin tonight. I won't be making this again.
