Loved it! I also didn't have pancetta and had to sub bacon - it was delish, a keeper.

Didn't have pancetta so I used some deli ham (don't laugh, it worked). Didn't have a can of tomatoes so I used a bunch of cherry tomatoes and a broth of white wine, tomato paste, veggie broth and bay leaf-fresh thyme-fresh oregano. And subbed basil for parsley. Added a good amount of parm to the polenta--which was reconstituted from the tube. We were in the clean plate club.

This was delicious, my boyfriend and I loved it-I did tweak it a bit. I added 4oz of goat cheese and about 1/2 a lemon's juice to the polenta after cooking. I also did about 2/3 parsley, 1/3 cilantro sprinkled on top. I used pancetta, which i love, but I think it would be delicious without. Or with a little thin, crispy pancetta sprinkled on top

kids and adults licked the bowls! Had to use bacon instead of pancetta but it was fine. Used can of finely diced fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic for even more flavor. Added a little parmesan and fresh basil to the polenta. This easy and flavorful comfort dinner will find a spot in our winter rotation.

Didn't have pancetta so used bacon. Didn't have polenta so made parm grits. Added some basil instead of parsley. Enjoyed.

Oh my word. We used real polenta, with parmagino reggino and French butter. Plus white corn was added to the polenta. No parsley, basil is much better. When serving, green onion on top. Wow weeee. Do your self a favor and make this dish!

Maybe it was the canned tomatoes I used, but I found the sauce cloyingly sweet, even with the addition of some Worcestershire sauce. Was flavorful, filling and easy/quick to make, but not 4 stars, by any means.

So I thought the recipe was definitely pretty tasty. I made a couple of modifications though. For the polenta: In a saucepan, heat 1.5c chicken stock 2c heavy cream, about 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, and about 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg. Once simmering, add polenta slowly and stir. Then for the pancetta/tomato mixture I added some dried rosemary and oregano and then lots of ground black pepper. This dish was definitely a hit. Thanks for posting!

I think that this is a great weeknight meal. It's very flavorful, easy and very quick to put together. I sauteed some sliced mushrooms separately and added it to the dish with the sauce. I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a truly quick and easy, but delicious, dish. It takes all of ten or fifteen minutes to pull together. I used cous cous instead of polenta and it was great, though I'd love to try it the original way. I did add a bit of extra red pepper, because I love really spicy food, but it would have been just as good without.

This recipe is wonderful for a quick and easy weeknight meal but is also a crowd pleaser! I added quite a bit parm to the polenta and also used more water in the polenta to make it smooth and creamy. I have used this recipe as an appetizer, topping crostini with polenta and then a bit of the shrimp. YUM!!

I've made this dish twice, the first time as is and it was bland the second time I made some changes and got rave reviews from my family. First of all, I do the polenta last, it needs to remain creamy and once it stands it starts to get hard. My changes - I crisped the pancetta in a skillet (did not add any oil) once it started to get crispy I added 1 chopped onion, and 4 cloves of garlic sauté for about 3mins, then I added the shrimp once that got pink I added the tomatoes, and some pepperoncini (depends on how hot you like it) while this is simmering I do the polenta. For the polenta I use a little less polenta than the directons call for, once it starts to get thick I take it off the stove and add in a good handful of grated parmigiana cheese and a few knobs of butter , stir until creamy and serve

I thought this was terrible and my husband said he didn't mind it - I think he was being polite. Not a winner.

This was a great and easy to make dish. Followed the directions exactly plus added fresh parmesan cheese to the polenta. A great week night dish that will go in the make again file.

Loved it--this is comfort food with an authentic Italian twist. I agree that adding fresh grated parmesan helps. Don't skimp on the pepper flakes--this recipe needs that spicy kick.

this was an awesome dish! i will be making it again. i added parmesan to the polenta which gave is some added flavor. otherwise, made the recipe per the instructions and got rave reviews.

I agree with fairfieldfoodie, this is lacking somewhat in the flavor department. I was pleased overall with the recipe, however considering the very little time and effort involved for a good looking and pretty good tasting meal. I'll try to think of some ways to improve upon it.

This was a fantastic meal. The pancetta really added an amazing flavor- I got a lot of taste out of a handful of ingredients. I made it the first time with grits and am making it tonight with pasta. I too browned the pancetta first and then added the red pepper flakes and tomatoes. Simple and delicious!

I make something quite similar using bacon instead of pancetta and oven roasted tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes. I agree with the other reader however - my standard recipe Shrimp & Grits from Bill Neal is tastier.

i made a few changes based on a previous review that the dish wasn't flavorful enough. i cooked the pancetta by itself until it was browned and drained off most of the fat before adding the pepper flakes and garlic. i added basil and good balsamic to the tomato sauce and a little parmesan cheese to the polenta. we loved it!

I was hoping this Italian version would stack up to my favorite southern shrimp and grits recipe, but it just wasn't as flavorful. Using Italian seasoned diced tomatoes might help. I haven't given up on this but it needs tweaking.

So easy and super tasty. A new weeknight favorite.
