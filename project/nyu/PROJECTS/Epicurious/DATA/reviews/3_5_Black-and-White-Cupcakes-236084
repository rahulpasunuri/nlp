My mom has made these for years. Her recipe includes a sprinkle of sugar anda few pecans or walnuts. She just made them for my birthday and they were a hit of the party. I had to hide one to have with my coffee the next day. Delicious.

These are OK, unless they are warm and then they are delicious. Made 16 full size and don't cook so long-about 22 minutes

These were delicious. I iced them with a chocolate sour cream frosting. I put a dollop of cream cheese frosting in the middle of that and then used a toothpick to make a sort of spiderweb design.

I first got this recipe from the December 1980 Bon Appetite. I have made them every year since then. For the holidays, I make mini cupcakes and give them to neighbors and friends. They freeze so well that I can start early. They always bring raves. One of the things my husband looks forward to the most in the holidays is when I hit the kitchen to make these. And, yes, he loves to pop them in the microwave for a few seconds before eating. I was so happy to see that the recipe is still being printed.

these always get rave reviews--especially when served warm and gooey!I have made them with both mini and regular sized chocolate chips and either works just fine.

I have made these a few times to rave reviews from office mates. The secret is serving them while still slightly warm so the chocolate chips are still melted

This recipe is god awful and I think no one should try it. The ingredients were pricey the flavor was bland and there was more calories than you should have in one day. No one that I made this for liked it.

So good. Made these today and am taking to a neighborhood party. I had to try one first and I am very pleased. I used gormet cocoa powder and the chocolate flavor is not too sweet. They look beautiful and were fun to make! I will definitely make these again.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I used to love when my grandmother made these and I thought the recipe was lost as well! I'm hoping these are just as rich and delicious as I remembered. I agree with the one reviewer who cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese. My grandmother went light on the sugar as well and I loved the slight tanginess of the cream cheese with the chocolate.

mmmm.... my mom and I used to make these cupcakes. When we couldn't find the recipe, I though they were gone forever. They are my favorite!! Not too sweet but deliciously rich. We call them Black Bottom Cupcakes.

I followed Racheljo's advice and only used 1/4 cup of sugar for the cream cheese mixture and it was perfect. It yielded 18 cupcakes and only took 20 minutes to bake in my overly zealous oven. Very tasty and easy to make.

These were a little sweet for my taste but they got great reviews from others. I got about 18 cupcakes out of this recipe. The cream cheese "dollop" was almost the same size as the chocolate base, otherwise I would have had lots left over. My memory of black bottom cupcakes was that the chips sink to the bottom, but this was not the case in these. If I did this again I would experiment with bigger chips and maybe less sugar in the cream cheese part.

These cupcakes were good, they taste cheesecake-y and were good with the "black bottom" chocolate. The recipe does not yield 18-20 cupcakes as indicated. I was able to make about 15 normal size cupcakes. They also did not cook in the time indicated but that was probably due to my ghetto-fied oven. Overall, pretty good.
