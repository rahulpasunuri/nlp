Made this for a dinner party last night and my husband cut the cake for me. I told him I thought the pieces were a little large, but there was hardly a drip or crumb left on anyone's plate. I made the recipe exactly as described, but did make my own amaretti cookies since I'd always wanted to make them, anyway. Highly recommend.

Great ending to a meal. Not too heavy, good flavors.

Although the chocolate sauce is divine, as a whole I found this dessert lacking. I do not think the textures and mouthfeel of ice cream and whip cream go well together. This just ended up being over the top in terms of richness without any contrast to add interest.

FABULOUS recipe. A real keeper and so easy to alter to different tastes (thanks to a previous reviers feeback). My only complaint is that I cannot find the amaretti cookies anywhere - I've been to every gourmet market within a 15 mile radius. I know that the light almond flavor would be perfect; however, I had to settle for crushed Pepper Ridge Farms Bourdeaux cookies instead :(

Super easy + I like the fact that it is a no bake dessert. Made some changes: omitted the amaretti cookies and added a little Kahlua into the whipped cream. Used only semisweet chocolate, omitted the amaretto and added instant coffee crystals to the sauce. Over all it was a very cappuccino-like desseert that looked beautiful.

This was absolutely excellent. Very easy to make and beautiful presentation. As another reviewer commented, my guests thought I bought it somewhere until they saw the bottom of the springform pan on the cake plate. I used all the amaretto - loved it. I even offered glasses of amaretto with it. I liked the coffee ice cream a lot but you certainly could adjust it to your liking. The chocolate sauce was wonderful - lots left over.

Great recipe, but don't go overboard with the amaretto. The crushed amaretti already have that sort of taste, and I recommend adding more almonds to help balance things. This recipe works fine with Breyers Vanilla ice cream, I couldn't find any quality coffee ice cream. As with all cold desserts, PLEASE serve it at a reasonable temperature. If it is too cold (or frozen solid) then it is hard and painful (to the teeth) to eat. Let the 'cake' warm up and don't worry, the hot chocolate sauce won't melt things very much because the whipped cream component is filled with tiny air bubbles that act as an excellent insulator.

I saved this recipe on my computer from way back in 1991. I have made it several times and its my all time favourite dessert. It looks and tastes wonderful and you make it ahead of time so on the day, you just have to serve it.

I have been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet in 1991. I use 1/2 cup crushed amaretti, it's much better that way. This is a sophisticated do-ahead dessert that has always received rave reviews. The only problem is it looks so beautiful that I've actually had people argue with me that I didn't make it till they see the springform pan as evidence (happened more than once.) The chocolate sauce makes it really great and the whole thing can be made in advance. I use the chocolate sauce for other desserts too - it's really good. I use 2 tablespoons of amaretto so it's not overpowering.

This was a great dessert to make as far as presentation, textures, and taste. It is elegant enough to "wow" guests at a special event and versatile, just change the flavors of the icecream and cookies to your taste. I highly recommend this dessert.

Great reviews from all ages. Made w/graham cracker crust & crushed biscotti in blender then folded into whipped cream for that layer. Made chocolate sauce but also served w/an orange,brown sugar sauce for those allergic to choc. Warm dishtowel around pan really does the trick!

I made this cake for my husbands birthday and it was a big hit with everyone. I have also used this recipe as a basis for many different ice cream cakes.....my daughter requested chocolate ice cream and crushed milano cookies folded into the whipped cream topping and I topped it with shaved chocolate....My son wanted chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookies in the whipped cream and mini chocolate chips on top.....well you get the idea....in any combination it is always a success......did I mention how easy it is????
