I found this to be a too sweet. I use it sparingly to balance out a meat or cheese. Next time I make it, I'll half the sugar. Also, the mustard seeds are key - they add a nice texture.

I made 18 times this recipe and substituted onion for scallions and it's spicy and delicious... I definitely would make it again!

Great recipe. Goes with anything! I even used it as a low-fat dip for pizza. Amazing on melted brie. Was still totally delicious three weeks later. Mustard seeds are vital.

Super good, made me a star at a function. Very good on meat sandwiches, or with crackers. Freezes well in small batches. Tasted less spicy once it cooled. LIke others have written - takes about 2.5 hrs.

I agree that the flavors are very nice, but in my opinion this is too sweet. I suspect that that those who had no problems with the level of sweetness either used less sugar then called for, or did not have very sweet garden tomatoes to work with. I will try this recipe again either with 1/2 the amount of sugar or tomatoes that are not so sweet. I also needed to cook this about 30 more minutes to reach the proper consistency.

Delicious!! It reallly adds a wonderful flavor to the roast beef sandwich. I believe it did take a bit longer to cook than the recipe said, but worth the effort.

Made it to go with the Roast Beef Lavash Sandwiches. Very tasty

I agree with previous reviewers that this chutney is a great way to use up extra garden tomatoes in the fall--and that it needs to simmer longer than the recipe states. I doubled the recipe, but only put in one cup of sugar. It was still a bit sweet for my taste. Next time, I'll double everything but keep the sugar at 3/4 cup. The pop of the mustard seeds really enhances the texture.

Outstanding, I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I think it took a bit longer to cook than the recipe said. I will make this again. A delicious way to use tomatoes in the summer.Used it on a roast beef sandwich.

I made two kinds, one with small yellow pear- shaped tomatoes and another with the beefsteak variety. Both ended up tasting very different. I canned them and have been giving them to friends and getting raves. I was trying to save these to give at Christmas but they didn't last!

This is the best chutney ever! It's awesome on a grilled cheese sandwich made with some nice sharp cheddar. Cooking time does exceed that given in the instructions. I usually let mine simmer for three hours or so until I get the consistency I like. You can easily double the recipe and substitute ingredients if needed. I ran out of both cider and red wine vinegar, so I used a combination of sherry vinegar and white wine vinegar and it turned out great. The mustard seeds are key!

Amazing mix of flavors. Alittle sweet, alittle spicy... Just wonderful! Easy to make, just takes time on the stovetop.

Delicious. I use dry mustard instead of seeds, and chipotle powder vs. red pepper flakes. Keeps well. It really spices up almost any sandwich.

In my mind this is the worlds best chutney, everyone who has tasted it agrees. Making a large quantity can be a lot of work but it is worth it. I canned mine, it keeps all winter long. Try it on bread or crackers with a brie or goats cheeses.

Delicious. Spicy, too. Didn't have red bell pepper or mustard seeds so subbed 1 tsp of ground mustard and some poppy seeds. Cooked in nonstick skillet for 1.5 hrs. Tasted very good with the roasted fish, but I think this would really shine with grilled chicken. Very pretty.

This was easy to make and tasted great. I served it with grilled pork chops. I halved the recipe and wasn't watching it closely enough while it was cooking and I did burn it a bit. Had to add back some liquid. Made some more the next day. Great way to use those tomatos overflowing from the garden.

This chutney is delicious! I had 3 pounds of fresh tomatoes from a friend's garden - I used all of them, omitted the red bell pepper and doubled the remaining ingredients. I too had to cook it about 2 hours total to reach the right consistency. I served it with grilled chicken breasts and couscous and froze the leftovers. Will definitely make again.

This chutney is beyond good, it's absolutely amazing. I prepared it exactly as written in the recipe, but cooked it about 45 minutes longer than specified so it cooked down to the perfect chutney-like consistency that I was looking for. It's the best. I can see many uses for it beyond this original recipe.

I make this as a dip for the cumin cheese straws and it always gets raves and requests for the recipe. I make it exactly as written and freeze them for use as needed. Straight from freezer to oven.

I am a huge chutney fan, and this is really the best chutney I have EVER tasted! I tripled this recipe to use lots of small, yellow, pear-shaped tomatoes from our garden, used half yellow pepper and half red (also from the garden), and all of the scallion instead of just the green part...also raw turbinado sugar instead of plain white. I simmered it for almost 3 hours to get the perfect consistency. We spooned it over grilled salmon, tucked it under the skin of whole chicken breasts before grilling, and served it over softened cream cheese with crackers. It is just absolutely wonderful!! I'll never eat store-bought chutney again!

Shockingly good sauce that adds sparkle to a dinner of grilled chicken breasts and white rice. It's also a wonderful party dip for shrimp. Don't throw out the leftover sauce; serve it with cream cheese on smoked turkey sandwiches. I used a pound and a half of tomatoes and simmered the sauce an extra 45 minutes.
