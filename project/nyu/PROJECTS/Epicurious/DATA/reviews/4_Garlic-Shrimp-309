Made for dinner with rice and the kids devoured it!! Used hot pepper flakes instead of chili pepper!

Made this for a tapas wine pairing dinner I was hosting. Used less oil and more garlic, as well as a splash of white wine (you could also flame w/brandy) as some other reviewers recommended. It was my favorite dish of the night - I love shrimp in any preparation.

This shrimp is delicious. I doubled it to serve 4 for dinner, but still used 1/4 cup (or less) olive oil. At the end, I added about 1/4 cup of red wine (I had no white and was nervous about the red, but it was amazing!). I poured the shrimp and the sauce over brown rice cooked in chicken broth, sprinkled the whole thing with a few diced scallions and some fresh cilantro, and served it with peas with a handful of chopped Bibb lettuce and a tablespoon of low fat butter.

This is a wonderful recipe! One of my favorite restaurants makes this delectable dish, and I am so happy that I can finally make it at home. Based on other reviews, I reduced the salt and added a splash of white wine at the end. It was wonderful, but my husband & I agreed that next time I should add in the full amount of salt.

Very very easy and delicious. We found that it served 2 as a main dish. Agree with others that it is overly salty and would decrease the salt a bit. Otherwise it's perfect and so easy.

Love, love, love, love this recipe. However, to cut the calories we usually cut the amount of olive oil in half.

I used this recipe as a guide and have made a dish that has always been appreciated. A couple of changes that I think are worthwhile: while cooking the garlic, add an ounce or two of proscuitto or jamon serrano, thinly sliced; when the shrimp are just about done, add juice from one lemon; use less olive oil while cooking, but add a bit more at the end to preserve the fresh flavor of the olive oil. Definitely serve with crusty bread.

This was good and very easy. I too splashed in a little white wine and the end and it helped. I didn't seem to end up with all the sauce that everyone is talking about though; without the white wine there wouldnt have been much of anything. Still, very tasty and very easy.

I made this for 2 with king prawns, red pepper flakes instead of the pepper piece, and a splash of white wine at the end. It was really one of the easiest things I have ever made. Served over rice with crusty sundried tomato bread on the side. My boyfriend, who is not a shrimp lover, really enjoyed it. The pepper and garlic are great together and really enhance the flavor of the shrimp. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was so easy. I followed previous reviews and added a splash of white wine right before the shrimp were finished. Also substituted some chili infused olive oil instead of the chili pepper. Didn't have a bay leaf, so omitted as well. I served this with hunks of crusty bread, and all the sauce was gone! Will definitely make this recipe again.

Good, simple recipe. I used chili flavoured olive oil and a bit of butter, omitted the bay leaf because I couldn't find mine. Fast, simple, good.

This is such a great basic recipe. Use as given, or add in what you like. Easy and delicious as an appetizer or main course over rice, pasta, potatoes, cardboard....

DELISH! Perfect light meal and so easy to prepare. I made several adjusmtents: I left out the salt because my family and I are watching our sodium intake plus the shrimp is already briney. I used red pepper flakes instead of the dried chilis. I added chopped green onions which helped enhance the garlic flavor. Instead of sauteing the garlic, olive oil, bay, and red pepper on high heat, I used medium heat instead. High heat burned the garlic.

YUM!!! I made this dish for a friend's birthday dinner and it was a big hit. I quadrupled the recipe and couldn't find a dried chili pepper so I used crushed red pepper. Just before the shrimp were done I splashed some white wine and some lime juice in. The sauce was perfect for dipping in some crusty bread and our guests were also drizzling it over the grilled chicken we had. Will absolutely make again.

Divine! The proportions are perfect. I added a few splashes of Mirin Japanese sweet cooking wine at the last 30 seconds of cooking and that probably kicked it a notch, giving it a hint of sweetness. I think I'll use smaller shrimps next time cause they have better texture than large ones. Great with warm crusty bread.

This is a sophisticated dish that I would definitely choose to entertain my friends and family. The favor of this dish can be enchanced by splashing white wine on top of the garlicky shrimp just before it is done cooking.

I love this dish!! Anytime I need something fast for appetizer or dinner that's full of flavor this is what I go for. I usually serve on top of pasta or salad.

This recipe is very easy and fast but neither my husband nor I were crazy about it. It was bland and had no depth to the flavors.

I have made this dish twice already, with no substitution --once as an appetizer and once as a main course. May I just say --YUM!!!

Fabulous! I made this as a main course for 2 along with crusty bread, roasted tomatoes and a big salad. It was so delicious and couldn't be easier to make. I'm definitely going to make this often.

I doubled the recipe, squeezed fresh lime juice over it and brought to a tapas party and it was gone in a flash. Very easy to make and delicious.

I have made this dish 3 times and each time it has come out excellent. I HAVE HAD REPEATED REGUESTS TO HAVE IT AGAIN.My guests can not beleave how the shrimp tastes so good.

Guests and husband raved about this dish. It's a foolproof appetizer, and went really well with the Parsleyed Garlic Bread recipe I found here.

Delightful. Made it for 2 and tonight I will serve 8. Try making it with tostones (fried plantains), basamati rice and avocado. It is the definition of a perfect meal!

This is great. After a trip to Madrid, I tried to find a recipe that would replicate what I had eaten there on tapas crawls. I don't need to look any further than this dish.

I used Prawns and it was wonderful... especially dippping the crusty bread into the olive oil seasoned with coarsly ground black pepper.

I cut back slightly on the salt, added sliced mushrooms, and squeezed fresh lime juice over just before serving over brown rice cooked in chicken stock with red pepper flakes and bay leaf. It was a big hit. I also increased the amount of fresh parsley for more flavor and color.

Rating: 3
Fantastic! I used at least 2 Tbsp. minced garlic, some red pepper flakes, and only 2-3 Tbsp. olive oil. I also added the parsley in and sauteed it a bit before adding the shrimp. For such a simple, quick recipe, it has a lot of flavor. We will definitely make this again.

This is pretty good, but being from Maryland it doesn't compare to our steamed shrimp..Why have garlic shrimp, when you can have steamed shrimp??{Maryland style}

This has been a family favorite, since we first made it when it was published in Bon Appetit. It's always the first course of our special family dinners.

Very good and very quick. I cut the salt as suggested. As an alternative to crusty bread, the extra "juice" is really good drizzled over a baked sweet potato.

Excellent! I agree that the salt should be reduced, but otherwise a simple, delicious dish. A little squeeze of lime is a nice finish.

This dish is quick and, the bread was a wonderful addition. The salt gave the shrimp an excellent flavor and the hot peppers gave the sauce a little spicy flavor. The garlic was a bonus. We will be having this dish again.

I've made this dish every year for our Tapas party. It's great served with the Garlic Aioli. The only problem is it's way too salty. I would cut the salt in half. Enjoy!

Wonderful flavors! You must have crusty bread for dipping. I agree...cut back on the salt because it is very salty.

This recipe is great, especially if you are crunched for time. I would suggest going easy on the salt - the only criticism I got was that the shrimp was too salty. I served this over spanish rice (Uncle Ben's, with a can of diced tomatoes thrown in) - also very easy to make.
