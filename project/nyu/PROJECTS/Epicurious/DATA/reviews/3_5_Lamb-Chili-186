Can't review yet, but will definatly be trying it as soon as I can. note to aerice from IN, doesn't sound like you put any effort into it, you need to experiment and the longer a meat is simmered the more tender it becomes. hope to have review on this recipe next week

This recipe was inedible. After following the directions step by step, I was left with a soupy, bitter mess studded by bits of tough lamb. After trying to remedy this I gave up and threw it in the trash. I can't really figure out what went wrong but definitely will not make again.

I've always loved lamb but had never used dried Mexican chilies in a recipe before...what an awesome combination! This recipe is perfect as-is, but my imagination is already working on ways to experiment.

As a lamb producer, I made this recipe for a local chili cook-off contest (very, very local!) and it won first prize. We had wonderful lamb but made it almost to the letter. Enjoyed immensely.

pretty good - seems like a flexible recipe

For those of you having trouble finding the ancho and new mexico chile pods, try this: www.penzeys.com has top-quality dried anchos at $3.99 for 4 oz. www.hatch-chile.com has the new mexico mild pods I use for $4.29. Neither one of these chiles is particularly hot. Great flavor, though! Lately, I have been making this chile with 3 lbs. of inexpensive lamb neck stew meat, and I find I have enough sauce to make the 3 lbs. Then I am assured of leftovers! Also, I use 2 15-oz. cans of black beans, well-drained, instead of the kidney beans. Thanks to Joey for emailing me about this chile.

Ok, I couldn't find Ancho chilis, so I added an extra NM chili and added some chipotle. Overall I thought the recipe a bit spicy. Also, the consistency of the chili after pureeing all the ingredients is a little drab. I would recommend only pureeing 1/2 to 2/3 of the base. Beyond being spicy though I thought the taste was s little bland.

I was really pleased at the texture of the Lamb after allowing it to simmer. So very tender! I did add 2 lbs of meat and an additional 2 c H2O and simmered it down again. I also add a 1/4 tsp of Hungarian Paprika to 'kick it up a bit' and was pleased with the results. Homemade cornbead added on the side and "whee"!!!!

When my family travels and I stay home I triple this recipe and live off of it for weeks. My personal favorite be-at-home-alone food. I highly recommend this one.
