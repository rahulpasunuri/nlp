Incredibly tart. Made it sweeter for our second batch, but we're going back to the original for our third run. Incredibly refreshing mixed with seltzer water, that's how we're going through so much of it.

I rated this recipe three forks, but only after the addition of tequila. My husband made this for me a couple of years ago as a Mother's Day surprise. Boy, was I surprised. So tart I could barely keep it in my mouth, and not at all smooth, more like chunks of ice. Then we hit upon the solution. Fill a little glass with the "sorbet," add a shot of tequila and a straw = heaven. Now we make it every summer as an icy cross between a margarita and a mojito.

I strained out the mint before freezing but it was still quite bitter and much too minty. I used twice the sugar as some recommended and it was still unbearably sour. Don't waste your time on this recipe.

I like the combo of tart and sweet - but if you don't like tart too much, I would follow the other person's suggestion to add more sugar.

Outstanding recipe and easy to make, except it's way too tart. My family loves tart, but in this case I doubled sugar (using same 1 cup water for the syrup). Plus cut back lime juice to 2 1/2 cups. Still very tart, but perfect for us. I used good, ripe limes and found the proportion of 6 limes to 1 cup juice accurate. I would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't had to experiment with amounts so much.

This recipe is all messed up. First, 18 limes only yields about 1 3/4 cups juice, so I don't know what they are talking about. Second, if you use this much juice and this much sugar solution, it is going to be too tart to eat. The sorbet going into the ice cream maker should be too sweet, because things get less sweet as they freeze. I modified significantly with a lot more sugar solution and less lime juice (and got wacky with a half can of coconut milk) and it tasted pretty good.

This sorbet (or more like an Italian ice) was wonderful. However, I am the queen of tart! The combination of lime and mint was mouth puckering, yet refreshing. A great thing to serve on a hot afternoon after a big meal. It was very simple (although the limes took forever to press) and light. One may want to think about dishing it out in small doses, as a big bowl of it can make the tummy hurt (as even I experienced- and I eat a lot of limes!). Perhaps reducing the number of limes a little bit wouldn't hurt. But I would certainly make it again. Yum!

Way to tart. Might make a good base for a mint gimlet.

This was wonderful. Simple to make, cooling on a hot day, and a hit with company.
