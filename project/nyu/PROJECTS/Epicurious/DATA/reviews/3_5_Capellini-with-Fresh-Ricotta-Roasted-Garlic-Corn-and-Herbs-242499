Loved this - came out very well. I was very surprised at how well it stayed crisp even after a day or two in the fridge.

I usually don't love cold pasta dishes and was planning on eating this hot, but it is fantastic at room temperature. Really delicious combination of flavors! I was just cooking for myself so I pared down and eyeballed the ingredients, did not rinse the pasta (that just takes away the lovely starchiness!), used a mache mix with radiccio in the stead of mixed greens and radiccio, and used part-skim ricotta. I roasted the whole garlic head and used about half (I love garlic!) This is a great, very flavorful spring/summer recipe for any occasion. If you think it's bland then your ingredients aren't fresh enough, and/or you forgot to add salt & pepper!

FANTASTIC! The only change I made was to just half roast the garlic, so that it still had some bite to it. I like the taste of raw garlic much more than roasted, just a personal preference. It's absolutely critical to use good ricotta. So creamy and fresh tasting. Yum, yum, yum.

This was a very interesting dish, and I enjoyed it more than I expected to. I didn't have access to fresh ricotta or basil and prior reviews made me a bit nervous it would be too bland, so I decided to add in some (about 1/4 lb.)mild bleu cheese. I thought it made a really nice addition. I am recommending it to others.

I really wanted this recipe to work, but the first time I made it, it left a lot to be desired. Here is how I altered it, using a trusted Italian sauce cookbook. I share it because we thought this was super once the changes were made. Enjoy! To replace ricotta cheese: 2 T softened unsalted butter, 4 oz imported mascarpone (half a small container), dollop of gorgonzola (optional) 2-4 T of pasta cooking water. Add at the end: 5 slices of prosciutto, cut into thin slivers. Preheat oven to 400°F. Place head of garlic on sheet of foil. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil; wrap foil around garlic and crimp to seal tightly. Place garlic and corn on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until corn is tender and garlic is soft, about 25 minutes for corn and 40 minutes for garlic. Cool slightly. Squeeze garlic out of skins into large bowl; add any oil from foil. Add lemon juice, lemon peel, and 3 tablespoons oil; mash garlic, then whisk mixture. Shuck corn; cut kernels from cob and transfer to same bowl. Meanwhile, break pasta in half and cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. While pasta is cooking, combine mascarpone and butter in a bowl with a wooden spoon, then add gorgonzola if using, then 1/4 c. parmesan cheese. Drain pasta and put back into cooking pot. Add the cheese mixture and toss to coat, heating gently if desired. Add pasta, greens, radicchio, herbs (I didn't use dill), prosciutto slivers and garlic mixture to pot; toss to coat. Season with salt (though be careful because if gorg. and prosc. are in the mix) and pepper. Garnish with shaved Parmesan. Serves 4.

Found this recipe to use up the herbs that are over-growing my herb planters. The mix of fresh ingredients gives a great refreshing taste. Prepping the ingredients does take some time. My Corn Stripper helped a bit with the corn kernels. I chopped the herbs before measuring them and seasoned liberally with salt and pepper at the end.

Didn't make sense to cool down the pasta before mixing it all together.

I recently made this for a summer BBQ and the family raved. The crunch of the sweet corn and salad greens together with the lemony angel hair pasta texture is really nice. I think I would not bother if we did not have good fresh sweet corn and herbs. I have found substituting whatever herbs I have from the yard works out fine, since the herbs are not the dominating flavor in the dish. The prep time is longer than I would like but it does make alot!

I made this exactly according to the recipe the first time and it was good, though the ricotta is a bit bland. The second time around I doubled the amount of herbs and used goat cheese instead of ricotta, and it was absolutely amazing!

This is delicious. I love the combination of flavors. It was so filling that we had tons of leftovers. I made it with a little garlic bread. yum!

Very summery! When I make it again, I would omit the dill (perhaps entirely) and lower the amount of parsley. The herbs overwhelmed the more sublte flavor of the roasted garlic and corn. That said, I loved having the salad in my pasta, and am curious to keep tinkering with it.

Served this and everyone raved about it. I made a few changes...added sauted asparagus. The only herbs I used were Basil, Parsley and a little Dill. Was very generous with the ricotta and the olive oil.

Very summery, though it was a bit bland. Could've used a lottle more flavor. Maybe next time I will add something that has a bit more punch to it and omit some of the ricotta cheese. I was expecting it to be a little lighter.

Great dish. I pretty much followed the recipe. Everything was super fresh (picked herbs from garden, greens and radiccio were very fresh, fresh grated parm etc)... I don't think it would be as good otherwise. I don't like chives so I omitted them and just added a bit more parsley, basil and dill. Instead of roasting the garlic and corn in the oven we did it on the grill. I did all the prep ahead of time (wash greens, grate parm, chop herbs, roast garlic and corn) and threw it together just before dinner.

excellent pasta dish--key is to get the freshest ingredients for maximum flavor! Didn't have any problems with following the recipie

A good amount of prep and a lot of calories for just OK results. Somehow even after an entire head of garlic, two lemons, $6 worth of herbs and even some exceptional parmesan, it was bland. Maybe it will be better on day 2.

YUM. Made as written. My only complaint: Man, the kitchen is hot after all that garlic roasting! We took it outside!!

Not good at all. We tossed it and made some yummy pancakes.

Wonderful, interesting dish and especially summery. Followed the recipe to a t, except did not use radicchio; substituted arugula. The parmesan seems really important in this dish. Slightly time consuming with all the chopping & the preparation of the garlic. Worth it, though!

I thought the chives and dill overwhelmed the more subtle flavors of the roasted corn and garlic (and I used two heads of garlic!). All in all, I thought this dish was just too "busy." If I make it again, I'll cut out some of the greens and the herbs.

This is a great light summer pasta. Tastes good hot or cold, the corn and ricotta make it substantial. And the greens and radicchio make it crispy and light. Loved it!

As a left over, adding some sauteed chicken marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, and similar herbs, cut up into bite-sized pieces makes it even better.

I LOVED this recipe. I sauteed canned corn instead of roasting it on the cob and it was delicious. It also allowed me to just throw the garlic in the oven, wait about half an hour, and then finish everything up just in time to pull the garlic out. I didn't have the problem with not enough liquids that many reviewers seem to have had but I also estimated on most of the measurements. The mix of herbs along with the lemon juice was delicious and although the radicchio is a bit bitter, it blends perfectly with the mix of other flavors. I'm not sure why some reviewers were so annoyed with not knowing whether to have it hot or cold, it's great both ways. I will definitely make this again.

I substituted swiss chard for the mixed greens, but otherwise followed the recipe. A very fresh and light pasta recipe. We ate it warm the first night and straight out of the fridge the second. It was good both ways.

Not sure why the first reviewer commented that this recipe is too time consuming. I make this recipe all the time and it is easy and tasty. As the reviewer from Tampa mentioned it is always a good idea to save some of the pasta water when using any type of cheese for the sauce to get the right consistency. I would recommend this recipe!

I really enjoyed this dish and will definitely make it again. It was a very interesting and fresh take on pasta. I did not have time to roast the garlic or the corn so I cheated and sauteed the garlic in a pan and used frozen corn instead. I agree that is was a little low on liquids so I just added some olive oil in order to keep it from binding together.

Totally 4 forks! I read this and thought I have to try it - followed exactly except for 2 things: arugula instead of baby greens and saved some pasta cooking water. Probably added about 1/3 cup to get the right consistency. Oh, and I broke the capellini in half before cooking instead of the Edward Scissorhands bit on the cooked pasta. I think it would have been much too dry without adding the cooking water. The leftovers I nuked on very low power to bring to just above room temp and they rocked but not as much as the original dish.

I thought this was a terrific recipe, but, agreed, pretty time consuming. I roasted more garlic (5 cloves), didn't add the radicchio, and doubled the spring greens. Ate it warm, then had the leftovers both hot and cold. I liked the hotter version but all were good.

This was pretty good, especially the next day. I also thought it was ALOT of work. When you first read the recipe it does not seem like it would be. My family wondered if it was supposed to be hot or cold. My son took some to school for lunch cold and loved it. Not sure I will make again

this was delicious. i forgot to put in the ricotta and it was still tasty. you could put in more greens and it would still work

I was a bit afraid due to the first reviewer, but it came out fine. I wasn't sure if it would be a hot or cold thing, like the previous reviewer, so I served it at room temperature. The lemon made it special. In the future, I may use penne, as I don't see the advantage of cut capellini

Terrible results. Too much time to prepare and too expensive considering the results. Clearly lacks ample liquids to keep from turning into a ball of ricotta. Couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be cold or hot? Give it a zero
