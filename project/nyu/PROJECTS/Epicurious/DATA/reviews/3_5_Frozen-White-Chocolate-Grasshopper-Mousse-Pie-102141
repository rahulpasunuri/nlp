I've made this pie for guests a couple of times now and it's always a hit. I didn't find the egg yolk/hot milk mixture to be a problem, but you do have to watch it when you're cooking the custard or else it could curdle. I will definitely make this again, and again, and again - yummy!!!

This was well-received, but I thought it was way too much trouble. It also was not minty enough, so I recommend doubling the liquers. I think it would be as good simply using softened vanilla ice cream with liquers.

This was an excellent dessert and I will absolutely make it again. I was careful when adding the hot milk to the egg mixture and did not have any lumps. Great ending to a summer BBQ!!!

I made this pie for a dinner party last night, and I have to say, this is one of the best pies I have ever made. Just hearing the name of the pie made my guests mouths water, and they were not disappointed. I'd recommend using a lower setting and stirring constantly when making the custard. Also, if you nuke the chocolate bars in the microwave for 20 seconds (then in 5 second intervals until just soft on the edges) you will get better choclate curls. I just used a vegetable peeler. Now I'm off to eat leftovers!

After reading posted reviews I was reluctant to try this recipe, but really wanted to make a grasshopper-type dessert with St. Patrick's Day coming. I tried it and was quite pleased. Perhaps if the directions reminded people to use the same care they would in making any egg-based custard, others would have been more pleased with the results. I used the following for the base: 1 oz semi sweet chocolate, 3oz butter, melted together; added in food processor to 30 crushed chocolate wafer cookies. Also I made individual tartlets & added a swirl of chocolate ganache before freezing to give some added visual appeal.

i am a pretty well accomplished cook, yet when i put the egg mixture into the milk mixture, it curdled or whatever the word for it is. anyway, taste isn't bad, but what should have been easy, was really not good whatsoever

This dessert was not a bad one, it just lacked the pizazz I was expecting. My husband still enjoyed it, although I was playing the culinary critic.
