I am a Trinidadian and this recipe is almost perfect. But I have a few corrections. Yes omitting salt was a BIG oversight. Of course you need to add salt or as some people like myself do we add enough maggi bouillon cube to the dish that you don't need to add salt. We Trinidadians love to use maggi bouillon cubes in all our dishes. Also it should be clarified that the sugar should be heated until it is almost black but not burnt. If you brown the sugar enough you don't need to use more than a couple tablespoons. Another major point is that Trinidadians ALWAYS season their meat before cooking. We wash the chicken with a little squeeze of lime or lemon and then marinate the chicken for at least a half hour in the ground green seasonings, onion and garlic. This makes a HUGE impact on depth of flavour in the food. But be sure to omit the liquid and seasonings when browning the chicken in the caramelized sugar otherwise the chicken will not brown well. Add it to the food later after adding all the other ingredients. Hope this helps anyone else trying to make this dish. I am happy to see others interested in my unknown island's cuisine!

We enjoyed this recipe. I omitted the meat to make it vegetarian. I also noticed they didn't have any salt included in the directions. I added some and it definitely made the dish better. I also served it with some of the leftover green seasoning. We will be making this again for sure.

use 2tbsp of brown suger instead of the 3/4 cup. brown suger gives more flavour and colour, the ketchup is opt.

My grandmother hails from Trinidad and this is the only recipe I've found that rivals her own. I cut the sugar down just a tad and turned the heat up with a bit more scotch bonnet. Excellent!!

2.5 Stars... We were so excited to try this recipe after my husband brought home pigeon peas and we had to figure out what to do with them. Just finished eating it and it's waaaaaay too sweet! It's also super rich. And I followed the recipe exactly, something I usually never do --but take a look --it never tells you to add salt! This is a huge oversight. It's got enough potential (and we have a ton of peas) so we might try it again with the following changes: -use just a teaspoon of sugar on the chicken (it doesn't clarify if it should entirely melt or how it should look when coating the chicken. for me, it stuck to the spoon, formed clumps, and then just melted into the sauce --more sweetness). -I'd skip the ketchup, maybe use chutney if it's not too sweet. -obviously, I'd add salt to the chicken and salt to the peas when they're cooking. -I'd cut the chicken smaller, into bite sized chunks. --I'd try it with brown rice -healthier and it'll add texture. it'll take a lot longer to cook. -Also, we added some of the green seasoning to our plates on the table and it gave it extra depth of flavor. by the way, even after pre-cooking the peas in a slow cooker, this recipe took me over an hour to cook --and I was moving fast. So maybe if you have premade green seasoning and a rotisserie chicken it'd be faster, but I used skinless, boneless thighs.) I've never been to Trinidad and this is my first Trinidadian dish, so I have no idea what is "authentic." But I know I prefer my entree's to be a little less sweet than my dessert!

Usual my family doesnt agree on my cooking. Im how you shall say, an experimental cooker. So i made this for them and they actually liked it, and had nothing bad to say. So this can do down for the books.

This is the authentic thing, tasted just like my mother's pelau. My shortcuts-use fesh rotisserie chicken, saes a lot of time and cleanup. With canned pigoen peas the whole thing took about 35 minutes (just until the rice cooked). Kabocha squash is a good alternative for the west indian (calabaza) squash.

This recipe is truly authentic and tastes just like my mother's pelau. I did do a shortcut-I added a cut up freshly bought rotisserie chicken instead of raw chicken and that saved time plus all the cleanup. Using that, two cans of pigeon peas, and canned coconut milk it was all done in only 35 minutes.

This was OK, but putting the effort into a good Indian Biriani or Arroz con Pollo would be a much better idea.
