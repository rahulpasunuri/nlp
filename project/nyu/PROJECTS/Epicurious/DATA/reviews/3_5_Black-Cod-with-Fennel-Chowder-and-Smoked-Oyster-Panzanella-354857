This recipe, as written with no substitutions, is divine. (@Madison, WIThe Seafood Center with four locations in Madison usually can get fresh not frozen black cod for me whenever I ask for it. It is expensive, but my favorite fish on the planet: buttery, rich and firm). My only substitution next time will be half and half for whole cream as a symbolic homage to my cholesterol levels.

Very good. Used fresh mexican seabass since there was no black cod available. I ended up cooking for chowder for an extra 20 minutes and it really thickened up nicely. Add the salt to the chowder at the end to taste otherwise it will be too salty.

The chowder is delicious. I did add a few shakes of Old Bay to it, otherwise made as directed. Makes only a small amount, enough for a small bowl per person. I did not serve this under the fish, as I felt the fish skin and bones would make it hard to eat. I served with small bowl on corner of square plate. The panzanella I made with smoked scallops instead of smoked oysters. Flavor was mild but delicious. Otherwise made as directly and was superb on the fish. DID NOT FRY FISH! Baked, basting with prescribed sauce, in baking pan. Did not require any butter in pan. Much easier, no mess on stove. Skin does not come out crispy, however. Perhaps when plating should just remove skin? Then might be able to serve in shallow soup bowls as directed over chowder for best of all worlds. Bake fish at 350 for 23-25 minutes for fairly thick 6 oz pieces.

ubstituted Fresh Chilean Sea Bass for Black Cod as I live closer to East than West(can only get Black Cod ((or Sable Fish)) frozen here)Otherwise made as per directions except for salt(oysters and clam juice had enough for whole recipe). It was absolutely delish..will definately make again..agree with love1siamese about the fat though so will keep for just once in a while.

the chowder was amazing and was a perfect complement to the cod. i subbed chicken stock for the clam juice (don't eat shellfish) and left out the topping entirely and it was STILL perfect. delicious. will definitely make this for company in the future.

Made this for a dinner with friends and it was a hit! I added a bit more onions, black pepper, Old Bay, (as reco'd in another review) and a bit of Himalayan salt to the chowder to give it more flavor. I substituted Chilean Sea Bass for the Black Cod - it held up well to the chowder and the panzanella. The shallot in the panzanella was a little overpowering - I'll lightly saute to bring out the sweetness of the shallots the next time I make this. Adding the puree of parsley and fennel gave the dish a great pop of color! Overall a satisfying dish with a gourmet look. I will definitely make this again.

We made the smoked oyster panzanella over flounder. It was delicious. I understand why other reviewers thought that the oyster would overpower the fish. We ate some of the panzanella with the fish and the other we ate over steamed broccoli. Did not make the chowder. With wild rice on the side the chowder was unnecessary.

Took a little while because of the all the chopping, so set up a food processor and it'll go a lot faster. Easy to prepare ahead of time and reheat the chowder. I liked everything except the oysters - they were much too strong and overpowered everything else. Next time I'll leave them out. Looked gorgeous and tasted great (minus the oysters), so giving 3 forks and sans oysters it could be 4.

I was excited to see this recipe as the ingredients reminded me of a restaurant meal I had locally that was so delicious. I prepared this last evening and made a few substitutions etc. I have not been able to find black cod locally even though it is served in some local eataries so I substituted New Zealand Hoki that was available at our local Whole Foods. I had not tried this fish before but it was wonderful. I did not add the smoked oysters to the panzanella and did not think it detracted at all from the dish as a whole. I did add some Old Bay seasoning to the chowder that I think gave great flavor over simple salt and pepper. This dish when plated was worthy of gourmet status and could be easily served for company as the chowder and components could be prepared in advance. The only negative was all the butter and high fat dairy products. When I attempt this again I will be working on trimming the fat but keeping the flavor.
