Had some leftover phyllo, and stumbled upon this recipe through an epicurious search. Used shaved deli turkey instead of thicker slices, but would chop either and mix with the rest of the filling before assembly. If you are not a rosemary fan, reduce the amount a little.

It was certainly beautiful (that's why I could make it again). The filling, however, wasn't as good as I expected. I think adding another texture would help (examples: pine nuts, almonds).
