I've made this recipe for several years now and it's great. It is not quite a traditional apple butter, which is usually super thick, smooth, and heavily spiced. Personally I'm not such a huge fan of that kind because it tastes only of spices, not apples. But this is more like a cross between butter and applesauce, maybe an apple jam. I make the spiced version, and it's great on toast. My favorite way to use it though is with a pork roast in the crockpot. I just salt and pepper a pork roast (shoulder is best, but loin works too), brown it with a sliced onion, and dump it in the crockpot with a jar of this apple butter, a sprig of sage, and a small splash of cider or chicken stock. Awesome fall and winter dish. I wish epicurious would add more real canning recipes like this to the site!

We made some apple and cheddar scones using homemade apple butter. Mine has less sugar and all the spicy flavors. Check it out. http://yourfoodchoices.wordpress.com/2010/12/05/spicy-apple-pear-butter/ Cheers, Jason

I agree with the previous review- this recipe by itself is more like applesauce than thick apple butter. I pureed the peeled apples, used half the recommended sugar and double the cider, cooked for 4 hours and included the "Spiced" version. The taste is amazing. Takes me back to the Ole Miner's Buffet at Silver Dollar City in Missouri's Ozarks ;)

This is delicious, but it is definitely apple sauce, not apple butter. I kept mine simmering for about 5 hours to get real apple butter. It is wonderful. I am amazed at how much it reduced, though. Filled only about 4-5 jelly jars. But the payoff is that the flavors really condense, and you get a rich, velvety texture.

Delicious! I agree with the other reviews stating that the recipe did not fill as many jars as hoped.

Quite good. I did change it a bit though. I used both brown and white sugar, lemon and orange juice (1 tbs each) and seasoned with cinnamon, clove and ginger. I also pureed it for a smooth consistency. Was really good on a grilled cheese with turkey on Rosemary bread, yum!

This made applesauce, not apple butter. I was looking for a rich, thick apple butter and was sorely disappointed. Even after cooking an additional two hours, it did not develop the rich flavor and consistency I was expecting. A total failure. What a disappointment, especially after all the positive reviews.

I needed guidelines/proportions, and didn't follow this recipe strictly. I used apple/apricot juice in place of the cider, and no added sugar. The proportions and amount of juice were to recipe (also the lemon juice). I added cinnamon and nutmeg. It came out wonderfully well; sweet but not cloying, hint of apricot and spice. Three forks only because this wasn't really the recipe provided.

Loved your recipe. This is the second time that I've used it, but I also used much less sugar and did not use the Granny Smith apples-too tart. I went the chuncky route and family just wants to eat it out of the jar. Gracias!! Gracias!! from Texas

I was so excited when my fiance brought home fresh apples that he had picked from a farm. I thought the apple butter would make great Christmas gifts. I used fresh pressed cider diluted with 1/2 water (it was really too sweet otherwise) The apples were soooo sweet on their own, could have used way less sugar! I had a mix of different apples, not sure what kind. But, keep in mind how sweet your apples are, and adjust sugar. My 10-15 lbs of apples made 16- 8 oz jars.

This is a good recipe. I substituted Martinelli's sparkling cherry-apple cider for regular apple cider, which gave the butter a more tart taste (had to bump up the sugar a bit), and added a nice dark red color. Perfect for autumn!

I just finished making this recipe! Amazing! It's easy and delicious. A neighbor dropped off a ton of apples this morning and I remember doing this when I was a child but couldn't remember where to start. This recipe is great!

If this is the right recipe I used last year- then it is good. I used the spiced version and I remember doubling the spices but turned out great and got rave reviews from all that I shared a jar with. Especially good on hot or cold cheese sandwiches (cheddar, brie, etc). I've also used all types of apples and always good.

I made the spiced version, which is delicious. I used golden delicious apples instead of Granny Smiths, so I cut back on the sugar. I did find that the recipe filled fewer jars than is stated.

I have made this recipe twice and will certainly make it again. The second time, my Mother and I doubled the recipe - it was exquisite. The recipe was more than easy to follow, didn't take very long to prepare and made an extra bottle. The taste is to die for and tastes especially good with vanilla yogurt. Doesn't get much better than this! Trudy from Nova Scotia
