The few, the proud, the people who followed the recipe exactly and then reported back: Me! I prepared this as written and it was indeed tasty. The crust was especially nice, though I would increase the salt a tad. This was my first time making a crostata and it turned out lovely. The previous reviewers who have said that it makes way too much filling were indeed correct. There is no way all those apples will fit into that tiny crust. I would suggest doubling the crust recipe, or halving the apple recipe. I used pippins and did not have an excessive liquid problem as others have had. Next time I will also add a bit of lemon juice to the apples, as I prefer more tartness.

I took a hint from a few reviewers: baked in a pizza-stone-like dish (made it easy to transport for Thanksgiving dinner), sprinkled the dough with graham cracker crumbs to absorb excess liquid (and used 2 Tbsp of the crumbs in place of cornmeal, which I did not have), omitted drizzling fruit and crust with butter (there was plenty everywhere else), sprinkled a bit of lemon juice on filling. The filling was VERY ample but fine, the topping was way too much: next time I'll do half. It was impressive looking and surprisingly light in taste (even with all that butter!) A bit labor intensive but nice for a special event.

Excellent! I shaped the dough into a pie pan rather than folding over. Yummy - would not change a thing!

I have been making Apple Crostatas for years. Just a couple hints might make it easier for others. To avoid apple juice leaking out of the crust, put 1/2 cup of crushed graham cracker crumbs into the center of the crust (avoiding the edges that you will fold over) then put your apple filling on top. You will never taste the crumbs and there will be no leaking. The crust will be lovely and crisp. When I am short on time, I also use a purchased refrigerated crust. I simply roll it out thinner and fill. Then I fold edges and paint with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. It takes only a few minutes and is beautiful.

Fortunately, I did not read the other reviews before making this. I followed the directions almost exactly, except that I always use whole-wheat pastry flour and less salt. It was fantastic! Yes, I felt like I had about 3 times as much filling and topping as I actually needed, but once it was cooked, the apples shrank and the butter in the topping melted, so the giant pile of stuff sort of shrank down to a normal size. It's quite a bit larger (taller) than your average crostata, but that was what made such a smashing presentation. My husband was delighted when he came home and saw it on the counter, and he was bragging about it all night to his family on the phone. The kids loved it too. If I had to do it over again, I would add lemon juice to the apple filling and maybe some cinnamon in with the apples as well as the vanilla. Some have complained about the crust--I put Saran Wrap over top of the crust while rolling to keep it from sticking to the pin, and started off just flattening it out with my hands before rolling so that the butter would soften and loosen up the pastry a bit. That seemed to work great, and I even had the whole wheat flour going on in there.

Great alternative to the usual apple pie and apple crisp we have during the fall. We prefer a real appley flavor so I used Cortlands. Had no trouble with 'gritty' crust. Perhaps the corn meal was too course. Didn't need more crust, but did have too much topping.

when my grandmother (the finest chef i know) tasted this dish, she proclaimed, "girl, i didn't know you could cook!!" it's guaranteed to please. i modified this recipe by reducing the amount of sugar and butter added to the apples; with so much butter and sugar in the crust and topping, you really don't need it, especially if you are using in-season golden delicious, gala, or pippin apples. i tossed the apples with 1/4tsp. lemon juice to add some contrast, with great results. to shave off a few calories, brushing the crust with egg wash (1 egg white beaten with 1tbsp. water) produces the same golden polish. omitting the crust altogether yields a healthier, simpler, yet equally delicious end product. i would love to make this with pink lady apples... so decadent.

Delicious! BUT, do heed advice of the other cooks. The crust should be increased by at least half and the filling and toppings should be reduced by that amount. I had enough filling and toppings leftover to make 4 small cobblers! Also, I would reccomend putting this in a pie dish instead of making this like a traditional crostata. It tasted delicious but looked beyond rustic...and not in a good way. I think a pie dish would have made the presentation much nicer and the preparation a lot easier.

This was fabulous and so easy! I agree with increasing the dough amount for the crust - I made 1.5X the amount, used 2T of sugar and 12T of butter, and it was perfect. I always make several batches of dough for crust at one time and freeze the extra disks. I used Granny Smith and Golden Delicious apples. Found I didn't need quite that much topping; (almonds were fantastic addition). I baked the crostata on a large pizza stone which added to the rustic presentation. My husband thought this was the best crust he had ever had! I definitely plan to make this again.

THIS WAS FABULOUS! As the Milwaukee reviewer stated: "I couldn't keep my husband or kids away from this!" In my case, I couldn't keep the neighborhood kids away from this. Everyone thought it was delicious. It's true: It is rustic yet artistic. Kudos Bon Appetit!

Sorry - "fraisage", not "frissage"!

Don't omit the corn meal, this, in my opinion is the secret to the crust. Don't know why previous reader thought the dough was gritty. Processor is great to use, remember to refrig. and use the parchment paper. Didn't stick, and was perfect!

Fantastic recipe. Would cut down on crumb topping. Crust is flakey and beautiful. Handle crust as little as possible. Coundn't keep kids or husband away from this! Simplistic but yet very artistic in a way! Get ready to hand out this recipe to everyone.

To cook on 10/6, frissage is working (or smearing)the dough using the palm of your hand to create long strands of fat - making the dough stronger. Make the dough in a food processor (process until the dough resembles curds), then turn it on to a work surface and smear the dough bit by bit with the palm of your hand. Gather it together and do it again until cohesive. I learned about this from a Cook's Illustrated recipe for a Freeform Summer Fruit Tart, so you may want to check there if this is not clear.

The cornmeal made the texture unbelievably gritty. Yuck. The crostata was really easy to make, though. If you left out the corn meal and made sure to put something in the oven to catch all the run-off from the apple juice and butter, it would be ok.

I made this dish for some impromptu company and was very please with the outcome. I didn't have a vanilla bean on hand so I used 5 TBL of sugar and a packet of vanilla sugar with the apples, I had Granny Smith in the pantry. Once I folded over the crust (used store bought pie crust) I melted some apple jelly which I brushed on the crust and then sprinkled with raw sugar (turbanado?). My company was impressed with the presentation and taste. I thought it was a great, quick dessert to offer up to friends and family and will surely make it again.

To the cook on 10/3 (with the Golden russets); what is the frissage technique? I don't see the term in the recipe, but I'd love to try this, and am concerned about the leaking apples others have mentioned. Thanks.

Agree with the reviewer to increase the dough-- delicious, but thin, and use less topping. I substituted pecans for almonds, out of a taste preference, Grannie Smith apples worked well. Spectacular blend of crusty crust, tart apples, and great topping! Loved it for brunch!

Great flavors. I substituted Golden Russets. In the future, I will make 1/2 more dough (had to roll it very thin to achieve suggested size) and use the frissage technique to keep the juices from leaking out of the crostada. Also, will make 1/2 the topping.

This recipes was easy to make. My children loved it. They ate it for dinner dessert and then again for breakfast the following morning.

This is one of those few recipes I have to visualise before making. A photograpgh of the dessert would have gone a long way!

Agree with user about KitchenAid pop-up. Very annoying. Didn't save or read recipe because of constant interruption.

Perhaps you should click the "x" in the upper left corner of the pop-up. This is a nice, simple dish. It's also fine without the crust as a quick autumn dessert.

I would love to rate this recipe. Heck I'd love to be able to READ this recipe. Couldn't be done due to an undeletable KitchenAide popup that covered most of it. Tried 3 times. I understand the need for advertizing revenue, but this destroys the site.

I added 2 T. tapioca to my sugar mixture before tossing apples, since these apples were extremely juicy. (The pie I made last week, was too watery, so I adapted). This is my new favorite apple dessert recipe!
