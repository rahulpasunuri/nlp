At first these came out nice and crispy right out of the oven. However, they all went "mushy" and soft after 15 minutes. I put them again in the oven but they ended up turning burt color after 2 minutes. Has anyone else experienced this?

I have been making this for several years. It's always a hit. No one can believe it's curried!

Used a little less than 1/2 the salt called for. I also made only 1/2 recipe of the seasonings because my coconut was kind of small. Everybody raved!!

My guests loved this, but I thought it too salty. I'll make it again, trying a different curry; this was Blue Mountain Jamacian curry.

Different. Also too salty. These were not a hit as an appetizer at a recent dinner party.
