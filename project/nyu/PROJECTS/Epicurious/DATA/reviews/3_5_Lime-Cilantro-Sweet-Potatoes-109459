Our favorite sweet potato recipe. We found that tossing them with the olive oil in the bowl we'll be serving them gives a better initial coating. We also found that tan skinned (white fleshed) potatoes are best (less sweet than the gold skinned/orange fleshed).

Wonderful! Served with chicken thighs in a pepper sauce and I think one of my best dinners for Sunday night. Toast about 1 T cumin seed in saute pan. Remove and Brown chicken, deglaze pan with dry vermouth, white wine or triple sec. When reduced toss in 1/3 cup of onion (I used red), poblano pepper chopped and 1 jalapeno. (I freeze peppers and use them all winter) Add about 1/4 cup vermouth and 1 cup chicken stock and cook until reduced in half. Stir in about 1/4 half and half or whatever you have in frig. Cook a few minutes,put chicken back in with cumin seeds and gently heat. Wow. Seriously great sunday supper.

This recipe has become one of my go tos. I change it a little though. I use Sririacha instead of the cayenne and it is wonderful. Adds a bit of an asian flair to the dish. Also, at the end of the sweet potatos roasting time, I turn the broiler on, put them up on the top shelf to crisp them up a bit. I am making this again this weekend for guests and I always get rave reviews!

This was a tasty, quick and easy way to make sweet potatoes for the holidays. I used more lime juice and a bit of garlic salt. I found the zest to be a bit too tangy and will likely take it out next time I make it. This was a well-received alternative to the sweet potato casserole of previous years.

I've served this countless times to guests that "claim" they don't like sweet potatoes. I toss the potatoes in the rest of the ingredients before roasting in a cookie sheet in the oven, eliminating the additional step. Next time I'll try it on the grill in foil like another reviewer recommended.

Rating: 4
Fabulous. It makes absolute sense that all these ingredients would be wonderful together. The sweetness of the potatos that are given a slight savory edge by roasting, the sour lime, the heat of the cayenne, all freshened with a little cilantro. I loved the recipe as written, but plan to experiment - making this as a puree, too.

Rating: 3
Definitely a solid dish. Easy too. I would do 3.5 forks if possible. I have made this as written, and also by cooking the sweet potatoes (wrapped in foil) on the grill. I liked how they caramelized a little more on the grill, plus it was easy to have all the other parts ready to go once the potatoes were cooked. I did not find this recipe to have quite as much heat as other reviews suggested, but then again, I really like the extra kick. I liked it with extra lime too.

I thought I d sweet potatos before this recipe -- I'd only ever had them the way my mother makes them for Thanksgiving, mashed with sugar and marshmellows, ugh. Now I eat them all the time! I follow the recipe if feeding others; if I want something fast and easy for myself for dinner, I brush the peeled, chopped sweet potato with a little olive oil and stick it in the microwave for a few minutes. Not as delicious as roasting, but add the lime juice and red pepper afterwards, and it works just fine for a 5-minute meal.

This dish is terrific hot and also great at room temp. It's a big hit with everyone I've served it to and goes great with a grilled steak or fairly plain grilled or roasted chicken. I do cut the cayenne a bit and I also cut the prep time by zapping the potatoes (covered, with oil and salt) in the microwave for 5+ minutes and then either roasting or putting on the grill. Grill is particularly good.

So easy and so delicious. Great recipe as is, but the following variation worked well also: added a pinch of cumin and 2 minced garlic cloves to the potatoes before roasting. Added a pinch of cumin to the vinaigrette. Used a mix of carrots, yams/ sweet potatoes and butternut squash.

Wow! Awesome. I made this for a party a few weekends ago and it was dead easy. Also, a huge hit! I'm going to make it again at Thanksgiving. A few notes: for my taste, you actually can't have too much lime, chili or cilantro, so play with the measurements if you enjoy highly flavored things. As for the chili itself, I prefer ground chipotle powder for its lovely smokiness (penzey's has an excellent one). And finally, when roasting, don't worry if some of the sweet potato pieces blacken on the bottom. At first this freaked me out, but they tasted great (not burnt) because the natural sugars had just deeply carmelized, and added a nice flavor note to the dish as a whole. I second the reviewer who said that this works great as a hot side dish or as a cold salad.

This is definitely a keeper - both because it's so easy and because the flavors marry so well. Also great when you need something that can be served room temperature. Perhaps my oven runs cool, but next time I would turn the heat up even higher in order to really crisp the potatoes. Also, I might add more cilantro, which can get lost in complex salads.

This is now one of our favorites. The lime and cilantro really give it a wonderful flavor. I have made this a couple times and each time it is quite a success.

We made this dish for Thanksgiving 2004. I like sweet potatoes, but several at our gathering who claimed not to care for them tried this recipe and LOVED it.

Also, anything with cilantro in it is a winner in my book. :-) Also, very easy to prepare.

Every time I've made this, at least two people ask me for the recipe. It's one of those dishes that is embarassingly simple- you almost hate to admit how easy it is to make.

I'd highly recommend them.

I thought this would be great as we love all the key ingredients. It was a bit of a let-down as the sweet/salty/tart combination seemed to clash with the sweet potatoes. Resurrected them the next day by roasting with a teriyaki glaze, but apparently this recipe isn't for everybody. :)

Since this dish combines some of my favorite flavors, I'm not surprised that I loved it. From previous reviews, I decided in advance to reduce the cooking time, but instead, I got distracted with the rest of my menu and cooked for even longer than 25 minutes so they were a little too mushy, but the flavor was still there. Can't wait to try them again and cook for only 15-20 minutes. I'm amused by a previous reviewer who substituted a russet potato and a lemon and used a different method of cooking only to find the recipe disappointing. I would argue that she didn't make the recipe at all ;-)

I didn't have some of the ingredients for this recipe so I used russet potatoes and lemons instead. The flavors just didn't blend with potatoes. It turned out very citrus-y for my taste.

I hate sweet potatoes but know they are packed with nutrition so decided to try this as a last ditch effort to work them into a menu. I grilled the potatoes to keep the kitchen cool and the slight charring made them even better. The recipe is great because it doesn't play up the potato's sweetness and there is none of that standard mushy, sweet potato texture. Even my non-sweet potato loving guests liked these - I liked them so much I made the same dish a week later!

My son liked it, but he eats anything. Don't think I will make it again, but it sure was easy.

I really like this recipe. I usually just bake sweet potatoes and eat them plain, but this is much nicer when feeding a crowd, and everyone seems to appreciate the unusual contrast of the sweet with the spicy/savory. I made them for the second time last night and our dinner guests asked for the recipe. I did add about a 1/4 tsp cumin to the spice mixture this time which was a nice touch. Also, I ended up serving at room temperature because our guests were delayed -- I thought they were fine that way, but my husband preferred them hot. I think it would be fine to make them up ahead and then pop them back on the baking sheet to reheat before serving.

I served this with a simple roast chicken and green salad last night. My husband and I really liked it. It has an unusual combination of flavors, for sure, but I am glad we took the "risk" and tried it. I will not only make it again, but would serve it to company without a second thought.

Potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams are not related to each other. The common potato, Solanum tuberosum, is not a root crop; it is the swollen tip of an underground stem, a tuber that stores starch in order to support the leafy plant above the soil. If the plant remained undisturbed it would eventually bear a small green fruit, similar to an unripe tomato. The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is the swollen root of a member of the morning glory family. Faulty translations from native Indian names may have caused confusion - both plants originated in the Andes, and the names may have been similar, but the sweet potato is the descendant of a wild plant whose remains were found in Peruvian caves and which was domesticated a thousand years before the time of the Incas. There is no other link between the sweet potato and the common Irish potato. Yams are tubers of a plant from the genus Dioscorea which is related to grasses and lilies. The term "yam" is often used to describe tropical root crops like the sweet potato and taro, but they are not related. It is an ancient plant that probably evolved in Asia and Africa. Its high starch content makes it an important food resource in New Guinea. Some varieties are considered poisonous, but the island people have learned to remove the toxin. The "yams" in our local markets are a safe, nutritious variety of sweet potatoes traveling under an assumed name. Widespread usage will eventually make yams a legitimate term for the sweet potato - accepted by everyone other than taxonomists.

The recipe sounds good; I look forward to trying it. As for the debate on fasting, if I can dignify it with that word: In the Near and Middle East, many holidays are honored by a daylight-hour fast. That is, celebrants do not eat from sunrise to sunset, and may even deny themselves water. (A waver of some sort generally is granted for the ill and infirm, and those performing heavy labor.) Then, after sunset, they will gather for a feast, which usually will begin with foods that are easy to digest and gentle on the stomach. The fast may be for one day or many, depending on the particular holiday that is being observed. Requirements vary, depending on the particular religion and branch thereof.

Great recipe. Not too particular to the taste. But I do love sweet potatoes. For those who are interested... the person below did mean fasting. FASTING does not consist only of NOT eating.

Honestly, this site often contains some narrow-minded individuals who actually go through the trouble of typing nonsense.
