The coffee is a great addition for brisket, but this needs allspice, celery seed, thyme and other chiles for more depth. You don't need a smoked chile (chipotle) when you are smoking meat with wood. Paprika adds virtually nothing but bulk to any rub. Chiles add more flavor and complexity. Don't add salt to your rubs either. Salt your meat, that way you can as much rub as you like without over salting your meat.

Excellent! Lots of flavor! (I had canned chipotle rather than dried, which I pureed and used a bit). I rubbed it on pork shoulder and braised it to make pulled pork. Really tasty.

Used this for enchilada meat. Rubbed on some brisket and seared before slow cooking in beef broth for 8 hours. I left out the cayenne altogether and changed the paprika to even amts of chili powder, smoked paprika and regular paprika. Delish! Might try leaving the rub on overnight to enhance the flavor.

Husband was grinding coffee beans as I was putting this spice mix together. Somehow a teaspoon of the ground coffee made it into the spice mix - Yummy!

Used on Pork Spare Ribs. Went easy on the Chipotle (for the kids) and bumped-up the garlic (personal problem). AWESOME flavor.
