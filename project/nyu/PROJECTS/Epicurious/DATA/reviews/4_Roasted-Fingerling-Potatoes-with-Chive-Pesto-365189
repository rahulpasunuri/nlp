Really good and simple. Chive pesto was a bit bitter alone, but when paired with the salt from the potatoes, really worked well.

This was very well received as a Thanksgiving side. The pesto is a bit pungent, though, and mine didn't come together very well so we had to stir each time we used it. Also, it was a bit pungent, more like eating raw onions than I would have imagined (I am not a fan of raw onions, and snipped chives have never been a problem for me).

Sorry I reviewed the wrong recipe just before!! The potatoes were amazing and everyone thought the chive pesto was amazing!

This was so good! Really moist and flavorful chicken. It definitely takes a little bit of time and you have to read the instructions carefully but well worth it. I only have two hours to brine and it still turned out wonderfully :)

Really enjoyed this pesto. Great way to use up some chives from our garden. we bought potatoes direct from the farm which we need to get through - this was great! We also nibbled at the leftovers after dinner. :)

This is a good, easy way to do fingerlings, which I'm always looking for, and an inventive use of leftover chives. I never have that much boring parsley laying around, however, so if you're not a gardener, it's gonna require a trip to market anyway. Loved the crispiness of the taters and found myself snack-snack-snacking every time I passed.

I absolutely love this recipe. I often make crispy potatoes as a side but adding this chive pesto makes it even more delicious and gourmet. I used pine nuts as it is what I had on hand. I've been craving it since I've made it-- definite keeper. May try the chive pesto next on grilled fish-- yum.

This is fantastic. I used almonds and put it on oven roasted Idaho potatoes. I served the left over spread on sliced baguette with wine to friends that stopped over unexpectedly. They loved it. I'll be doing that again and making it with Pine nuts tonight.

This was so delicious I couldn't stop eating it plain! It would be awesome on anything. Made according to recipe but didn't need all the oil. Made it from chives fresh from my garden. Great spring recipe

Wow! Loved this recipe. Like several others I used slivered almonds. It really turned out perfect and I think this could become the "it" side dish for just about anything you put on the grill this summer. I think it would be great brushed on kebabs. This one is a keeper!

Fabulous recipe. We used the slivered almonds and this was a nice change from the routine basil pesto. The leftovers taste great cold the next day.

Nice variation of pesto -- used slivered almonds. I served the pesto with roasted fingerling potatoes -- didn't use all the pesto. I'm planning to use the left over pesto with pasta; but the pesto would be delicious with chicken, lamb, etc. Will definitely make again.

The pesto was great. I served it with chicken skewers as well. Used pine nuts.

This pesto is amazing. I made a fingerling potato galette and spread the pesto over it. Added about 2 T of pecorino to the pesto but otherwise followed the recipe. It goes so well with potatoes-but it's so delicious I would put it on lots of other things too!
