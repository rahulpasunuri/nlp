I couldn't taste the apricots and the beignets were a little on the eggy side. They were yummy but not what I think of when I think of beingets. They tasted more like eclairs. Also, I didnt "get" the part of the recipe where it says once the dough forms into a ball, put the pan back on the stove until a film forms...so I skipped that part. I probably wouldn't make this again just because I have an eclair recipe that I prefer over this. I would actually give this recipe two forks but the epicurious website is acting up right now and it won't let me change it.

We wanted to serve beignets at a birthday party and tested several different recipes prior to selecting this one. We felt it was by far the best and our guests seemed to concur. People requested second, third, and fourth helpings... We also served cut-up strawberries and whipped cream in order to provide options.

Made the chocolate sauce as a dip with some fresh fruit--gorgeous texture, like satin despite being refrigerated and reheated several times. The flavor was spectacular--smooth and very creamy. I was very proud to bring this to Thanksgiving Day dinner and will look for excuses to make it in the future.

Made these for a small dinner party - everyone was going UMMMM. I cut the recipe in half and it did make about 20 pieces. The sauce is fantastic - smooth and velvety.
