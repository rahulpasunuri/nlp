Great recipe. Nice departure from the standard berry or chocolate cheesecakes.

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. Truly Delicious. But it is very rich and very sweet so small servings are most appropriate.Also, it's pretty simple to make.

I have made many cheesecakes over the years and this was by far the best. Really, really good.
