I would not make this again. My husband and our guests agreed. Rather than make this, you'd be better off to make a classic apple pie. Don't waste your time and ingredients on this recipe. I added a heaping 1/4 cup oatmeal and a large handful of chopped walnuts to the topping recipe, and it was the best part.

I've made this a few times and have received many compliments. I added a generous 1/4 cup of old-fashioned oats to the topping to add a little more texture.

The apples on top came out dry, even though I poured the sour cream mixture over everything. But it's hard to ruin an apple pie, so it still tasted pretty good.

This recipe is always a HUGE success when I make it for holiday family gatherings - all sides of the family love it. Very different from, but still satisfies the need for, apple pie. Definitely go for pre-made crust and I ALWAYS use non-fat sour cream with no problems at all (that's a big selling point for much of the family on calorie-crammed holidays!).

A good alternative to standard apple pie, but only if you like this quiche-like texture. The crumble on top was too sweet... Nuts would be nice.

I'd been looking for a recipe similar to my grandmother's apple pie for years and finally came across this one. I use a ready made crust. Still tastes amazing. Also, I've modified the topping to a brown sugar, flour and butter topping. It seems more crumbly than the one that is in the recipe.

This recipe came out great! I used a ready-made pie crust, 1 cup of sour cream, and chopped walnuts into it. I will definitely be making it again! !

Most delicious apple pie I've ever had. Everyone will be having second helpings. I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this pie for a potluck at work. It was the overwhelming favorite and was gone very quickly. I followed the directions almost to the letter...instead of 1 pound of apples I put in 1 1/2 pounds. I served it at room temperature, but think it would be even more incredible served warm with a little vanilla bean ice cream on top!

I love this recipe and it has become a "standard" in my dessert repertoire.

After reading the reviews, I expected to love this pie. WRONG! It is basically like a custard apple pie. Interesting... It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Don't waste your time.

Since 100% said they would make this dish again I had to try it and I am sure glad I did. It was fabulous. The best apple pie I have ever eaten. I have not been much of a pie maker, in fact this was the first time I have ever made a crust from scratch. I gave some to my business partner and asked how it rated against other apple pies and he replied, "It was the best pie I ever had of ANY kind." I think I just might make it again -- real soon.

Delightful! The topping is to die for and really makes the pie. But be warned that you will have extra filling. I used a deep dish ready made pie shell and probably over filled it a bit. I was worried the granny smiths wouldn't make the pie sweet enough for me but they were perfect. Even my husband who hates apple pie liked this. I will definitely make it again.

I made this and was more or less pleased with the results. The topping was wonderful, the apples cooked through, the custard set. It just seemed to be lacking in flavor. Perhaps it was because I used ground nutmeg from the store rather than freshly ground nutmeg. I'm wondering if more spices could be added to the custard for flavor. Maybe cinnamon or allspice? Any suggestions?

Made this recently with freshly picked local apples. It was a nice change from the regular apple pie. Plan on making it again soon for a group. Delicious!

If your looking for a twist on traditional apple pie, this is the recipe. It was very tasty and enjoyed by all that tried it. I would make this one again in a heartbeat.
