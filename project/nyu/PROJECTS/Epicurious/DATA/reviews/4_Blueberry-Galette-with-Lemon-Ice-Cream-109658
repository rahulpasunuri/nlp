This is wonderful! I made my own crust (Tender Pie Crust from this site)and I made the galette in a 9" pie dish, folding the pastry over the filling as you would if you made it on the baking sheet. The combination of flavors in the filling is perfect and I highly recommend the lemon ice cream!

Great -for a quick dessert - always gets great reviews. I use 1/2 the sugar and most say they like it better that way. Also have used peaches and ginger instead of blueberries and lemon.

Very simple and good with a rustic look to it. We loved it. A homemade crust will always, always beat store-bought one.

Basically a blueberry pie without the pie tin. I made these as individual servings, about 4" in diameter. I used a homemade lemon ice cream recipe also found on this site. That (the lemon ice cream) was delicious and the pairing with the blueberry galette is perfect.

My guests loved this receipe but loved the LEMON ICE CREAM even more. They keep asking me to make it again which I did this morning and took its portrait. I would upload it if I could figure out how.

This recipe is delicious and so easy to make! I made my own pie crust because I did not want to run back to the grocery store. Perfect summer dessert.

I made this 4 times in two weeks while blueberries were in season. Simple to prepare and delicious. I recommend using a good refrigerator pie crust. I used a generic on one occasion and the crust cracked allowing some of the juices to leak out.

I have made this recipe multiple times and my entire family loves it. It is very easy. Fill by piling the berries in the center and then spread to within 1 1/2 inch of the edge. The berries never flow over this way. Bake the galette on a silpat to ensure ease in cutting. The lemon ice is not difficult to make and adds and nice, fresh flavor.

Wow - this is a great dessert. The flavor combination is perfect. Do make the lemon ice cream - it's easy and a perfect compliment to the galette. I didn't have any problems with the galette being too juicy. I only had frozen blueberries. After reading the other reviews, I made sure to drain and dry the berries well. I followed another reviewer's advice and used parchment paper under the galette. I was able to easily transfer the galette to the serving dish and it was easily cut into serving pieces and stayed together well. I've made other fruit galettes before but this is now my favorite. I will definitely make again and again. Plus I use the lemon ice cream recipe for other desserts and try other flavors: orange, peach. Definitely a keeper.

this was delicious & so easy! i put the dough in a glass pie dish which worked perfectly & made it w/ half strawberries. the combination of flavors was amazing. this is so impressive nobody would ever guess how easy it is. i will definitely make it again and again....

Love this recipe! This is my go-to dessert recipe. I must make it every couple of weeks in the summer, with the different fruit. My favorite is peach or peach and blueberry (or raspberry) mix. Everyone loves it. I make it very easy: Pillsbury dough and skip the egg wash. My dough does leak sometime if the fruit is very juicy so if I think that may be the case, I just cook it in a large glass pie dish. The juices are too good to lose!! Be sure to have vanilla ice cream on hand-it is fantastic with the filling (which would be a great ice cream topper all by itself without the crust.).

this was great and so easy! i followed the instructions as they were. i did pay attention to one of the reviews and tightly wrapped the galette using the egg as i went rather than just on the top. the filling did ooze out a bit but not too much. glad to have found this! i'll definitely make it again.

Really great use of fresh Blueberries. Lemon Ice cream was a great hit. Forgot the butter at the end but didn't seem to make a difference. Will adapt this to all kinds of fruits throughtout the year.

Giving this four forks simply for the ease. I followed other recommedations and baked the galette on buttered parchment paper. It turned out perfectly! My guests raved. It was even good the next day. I served with lemon sorbet, but next time will try with vanilla ice cream. It was a bit overpowering.

Rating: 4
the first time i made this, all the filling oozed out. however, i did not seal the crust as well as it was needed. the bottom was also soggy and stuck to the foil. the second time i made this, i used less filling and used the egg to bind the crust together tightly. i also buttered the foil. the second galette turned out perfect. there was little oozing, and the bottom was surprisingly tender, falky, and did not stick at all to the foil. definitely take your time to tightly seal the galette.

This was really a great dessert. I made up a similar recipe using fresh cranberries which calls for both regular sugar and brown sugar. I tried it with blueberries but it didn't work so I was glad to find a galette recipe that works with a juicier fruit.

A unique easy recipe that calls for cinnamon and lemon flavors is unforgettably delicious! This recipe stands strong as written. Try it exactly this way before playing with it. The Ice Cream is optional. An easy, impressive dish that can be served at any time of day. Please use fresh blueberries when they are in season. Everyone will gush over it!

Since I can't bake a pie to save my life I appreciated how easily this went together. I added peaches and extra cinnamon to the blueberries and it was yummy but bubbled all over the cookie sheet. My next attempt will be with peaches only. Thanks for the simplicity of this recipe.

I also tried the recipe with blueberries and nectarines. Score for the ready made pie crust! My berry juice dripped onto the foil too, but no big deal.

This took minutes to put together. I used tapioca flour instead of cornstarch, added a nectarine, and used sanding sugar on the crust. I also used Hagen Das Lemon Sorbet. My family loved it. I'm sure a homemade crust would be fabulous, but I like the speed and semi-homemade aspect of this galette.

This was delicious! I used Oregon blueberries and raspberries for the filling; added some cinnamon to compliment the raspberries. The blueberries really hold their shape and the raspberries breakdown; a great texture combination. I also decreased the amount of sugar.

I used fresh raspberries and blackberries and made a double recipe hoping to get 2 galettes. I followed other reviewers advice and used parchment but it didn't help much with the first galette. The juice oozed out and dripped to the bottom of the oven. The result was a galette that looked beautiful on top but soggy on the bottom. I tried the 2nd galette, this time draining the berry juice before adding it to the dough. Much better results! I can't wait to try it with ice cream or sorbet.

If you really want this to be extraordinary forget the packaged pie crust and follow the recipe for Apple Galette in "Simple Soirees" by Peggy Knickerbocker. I doubled the amount of blueberries (and all other ingredients) but used her recipe for the crust. It is buttery and flaky, her secret ingredient is carbonated water istead of flat. I've been baking for decades but this crust was the best.

Rating: 4
This was truly fantastic--not too difficult and very tasty even with frozen blueberries. I was surprised at how much the lemon adds to the ice cream. I would be careful, though, to use a cookie sheet with edges next time. The juice from the filling ran over the sides and made cleaning the bottom of the oven a less-than-joyful experience.

Fabulous! Easy and attractive. Didn't have time to make lemon icecream. Used vanilla and will again. Perhaps I will try to purchase a lemon sorbet to serve with it. I used premade dough crust. Will make my own crust to make a bigger dessert. I also used about 1 cup more blueberries - it needed at least this much more. Remember to adjust the cornstarch if adding more berries (I didn't and had a bit of a runny dessert)

My galette didn't want to come off the baking pan either, but it didn't matter: I just plopped the baking pan (it was a round pizza pan) onto a large cake pedestal and served it from the pan! It served nicely. Everyone loved it, and the lemon ice cream, too. Yummy! Beautiful, too.

Rating: 1
The dish tastes fine, but was nearly impossible to get off the baking pan, so the overall presentation was significantly less than impressive. Throwing the same filling ingredients into a ready-made crust in a pie pan would have yielded a dessert that tastes the same yet looks 10 times better and is much easier to serve.

I made this recently to finish off a night of grilling out with friends. The lemon ice cream hit the spot! I used frozen blueberries and the dish turned out very well.

Galette: Four forks warranted due to *simplicity, **easily on-hand ingredients, ***delicious results. Used frozen fruit, 16oz blueberries, 16oz blue/black/raspberries from Trader Joe's but left sugar/other ingredients same. Maybe it was the frozen fruit but can't imagine with less fruit; do think other combinations would be equally good. To cook ahead as much as possible, fruit macerated for some hours, then drained juice. Rolled Pillsbury crust a bit thinner but had no trouble handling; will use parchment vs tin foil another time. Lemon ice cream: Good enough but won't go to trouble again. Think topping of choice would be whipped cream w lemon zest or maybe Swedish Cream which is sour cream with whipped cream folded in.

Made this just the past weekend - was absolutely delicious. Fresh blueberries were very pricey in my local store, so I used frozen. The lemon ice cream was the perfect pairing to the blueberry. Every plate was empty after this dessert - always a good sign!

My guests loved this, but make sure to butter the foil really, really well. Both times I prepared this, the galette stuck to the foil a bit so I couldn't present it on a platter before slicing and serving.

This was amazing! I served it after a summer lobster dinner and it was the perfect way to finish the evening. I had a little difficulty with the premade pie crust (it kept breaking and the galette's juices leaked out a little when cooking) but it still turned out deliciously. Also I highly recommend the lemon ice cream. I almost skipped it but I am so glad i didn't -- it was MUCH better than regular vanilla.

I served this last night to rave reviews. Make the galette exactly as described and you can't go wrong. This is a quick and delicious dessert that's fit for family or company. Don't bother spending time on the ice cream: Get Edy's Lemon Sorbet instead and serve a small scoop with each slice of pie. It's tangy and wonderful with the sweet berries.

Excellent galette which all of my family and friends loved. I used my own homemade butter based pie crust which made it taste even better. This is an impressive desert, especially for a cook or baker who is not skilled in pie crust presentation. Other fruits such as peaches or apples can be used, as well.

I got rave reviews when I served this at a BBQ recently. It was a real crowd pleaser and a nice summertime dessert. The only problem I had was that I didn't pinch the crust enough in one section and alot of the blueberry juice leaked out onto the baking dish. Overall, an excellent easy recipie.

Ditto to all the raves! I am pie-phobic so this dessert satisfies but is quick and always turns out beautiful. I used a homemade pie dough (in the food processor), rolled it out, added the berries, and voila! The dinner party guests loved it. We used Dryer's Light Vanilla w/o the additions and it was great. Next time I will leave time to add the lemon to the ice cream. Enjoy!

Mechanical failure! Even though I carefully let the dough come to room temp. for the 15 minutes as specified on the box and I worked very hard at kneading out the fold marks, I still had a quadrent of the galette seperate away from the rest in the oven. I was able to recover and serve it and it was tasty. If I made it again, I would either make my own dough or use a tart pan.

A delicious recipe, and a cinch to make. Like the others, I used top-quality plain vanilla ice cream. One word of caution - if you rinse the blueberries, be sure to dry them thoroughly with a paper towel before mixing with the other ingredients to prevent the filling from becoming too runny and collapsing the crust.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic!! A true crowd pleaser! I was very pressed for time when making this and it turned out exactly like the picture in no time. I used plain premium vanilla ice cream because I thought the addition of lemon ice cream would be over the top. I also held back just a bit and put 3/4 of a tablespoon of lemon zest in instead of the full tablespoon. Finally, I added one teaspoon of water to my blueberries for a little extra juice. TRULY A KEEPER FOLKS!!!!!!

Four forks may not be enough for this wonderful, easily made dish. I make many recipes from this site, but this was the best so far. Used the lemon juice and zest in homemade ice cream which added a bit extra to this great dessert.

I have baked for thirty years and this is one of the best recipes I have ever tried. It has it "all going on". It has eye appeal, ease of preparation, versatility and great nutritional benifits. Because I was not pressed for time, I did make the pie dough from scratch. Next time, I was thinking of using peaches and raspberries as the filling.

I've made this four times since the recipe was first published (less than a month ago). It is the biggest hit for a blueberry pie-like dessert I've ever made. Perfect. It has a lightness that is not often found However, I used homemade crust (all butter). I let the blueberries macerate in the sugar/corn starch for 1/2 hour. I lined the baking pan with a Teflon liner (so that bits of aluminum foil wouldn't stick to the bottom of the galette). I put the baking pan on top of a pizza stone that had been preheated (as is my custom for all pies). And I just served plain sweetened whipped cream, because I thought the lemon ice cream would overpower the blueberries.

I made this dessert for my family as a 4th of July treat, garnished with a few sliced strawberries for color. I found the blueberry mixture absolutely perfect, and it held up well for a free-form pastry. I made lemon gelato quenelles in place of the ice cream. Perfect.

I really like this recipe. I am a cooker, not a baker, so this was perfect for me. I made it once with sugar, then again with splenda with no appreciable difference. Made it again using blueberries and strawberries. Will try again using apples and raisins. A keeper. Didn't make the ice cream, used plain vanilla instead.

I made 2 of these b/c the package of pie dough contains 2 shells. I added nectarines and peaches to the second one. Also, there didn't seem to be enough liquid in the blueberry one to dissolve the dry ingredients. When it came out of the oven, I spread a thin layer of triple-berry jam on the top to help it along. I also used Splenda in place of the sugar. It got rave reviews!

I have found that blueberries, without an added complimentary fruit, are a bit bland. This recipe confirmed my opinion. Next time I will substitute some nectarines or apples for a portion of the blueberries--or perhaps I will use 1/2 blueberries and 1/2 raspberries. The galette looked impressive but tasted only so-so. I made homemade lemon ice-cream to serve with this, and the ice-cream was more of a hit than the galette. Still, with a bit of personalizing and this-n-thating, I think this is a fine base recipe.

This is a very pretty dish because of the blueberries. I found it a little difficult to serve but for just our family it was fine. I only used vanilla ice cream due to time constraints.
