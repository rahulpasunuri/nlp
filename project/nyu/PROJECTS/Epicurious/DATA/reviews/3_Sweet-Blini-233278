I saw this recipe and thought i'd improve on it by using Thomas Keller's blini recipe (below) - it makes for thicker blinis, but definately worth it. sweet & savory at the same time. and, for a keller recipe, it's actually easy! http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2000/laundry/blini.html

This recipe is absolutely yummy! I substituted homemade strawberry freezer jam for the apricot. Being a novice with crepes it took me a second batch of batter to perfect the technique, but it was well worth the effort.
