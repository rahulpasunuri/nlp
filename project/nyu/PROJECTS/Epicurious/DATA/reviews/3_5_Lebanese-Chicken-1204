I'm on a high protein, no fat, no carb diet. This recipe fit the bill exactly and was really good. Easy to make and lots of flavor. Served with Ratatouille from the Grill (Williams-Sonoma).

I have been looking for this recipe since I tasted it at a local lebanese restaurant. So glad I finally find it!! I would have never known that by putting the salt at the end before I bake (NOT in the beginning with the other ingredients) would make such a big difference. It seasoned the chicken but not marring that subtle taste of lemon and garlic and spices. It 's PERFECT. I have been making it with 1 1/2 inch cube of chicken (because that's how the restaurant served - as kebab with red pepper and onion), but I also made it with pork, which is equally good.

My guests and I loved this marinade. It's zesty, tangy and very similar to one a local Middle Eastern restaurant uses. I did deviate from the recommended preparation, though, using boneless skinless chicken thighs on the grill.

Followed recipe exactly (slightly short on marinating time though) and dish came out great. I served with grilled little new potatos and fresh peas, nice mix. Agree with previous comments next time i will experiment ramping up cumin and cayenne pepper.

Great recipe! I didn't marinate for more than 10 minutes, and it was still delicious.

this was delicious and easy. Marinated 24 hours. Used less lemon juice because that's what I had at hand. I will make it again. Served with tabouleh.

This smelled SO fabulous as it was cooking, but I didn't find that the flavors really infused into the chicken, even though I marinated for 11 hours. I didn't rub it under the skin, so that could have been the problem, and I will try that next time. I will probably make this again, because it was easy and pretty, but the chicken pretty much tasted like roasted chicken.

Made this to complement a menu that included Sticky Balsamic Ribs from this website. Thought a second, "lighter" protein would be appreciated. Great flavor. I used dried Thyme (fresh was sold out; it's the holidays...), and it turned out OK. As a Lebanese gal, I agree that this is a delicious middle eastern staple.

This is very comparable to our favorite Lebanese restaurant. I pair this with the taboule recipe on this site, hummus, tahini and warmed whole wheat pita bread. We save $30 every time I make this. The flavors are wonderful.

I love this recipe. I've been making it since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit. I make it just as written and it turns out perfectly every time. The combination of spices in the marinade is so delicious.

I found this recipe years ago and it has always been a crowd pleaser. Last time I made it for my husband's Surprise graduation party and everyone kept asking me what had I done to the chicken. I have baked, broiled and grilled it, used just chicken breast, cut up chickens, wingettes, you name it. I like it best grilled honestly. I have not had a desire to bump up the spices or adjust it but everyone's palette is different. I have an event tomorrow and am trying it with salmon for the first time which I think is hearty enough to stand up to this marinade. I can't wait to see what it taste like. Like others, I find marinating for 24 hours or overnight best.

I think the spices were fine, but drowned out by the lemon. I will try using 1/3-1/2 cup lemon juice and the rest chicken broth.

Easy, especially because you do the messy stuff ahead. I agree that you need to bump up the spices. I also found it really works better with chicken thighs.

Rating: 3
Interesting flavor and not spicy at all! Could use a little more cumin and a little less lemon. I made a sauce from the pan drippings, chardonnay vinegar, nutmeg and sour cream (ran out of yogurt) and mixed it into spinach for an awesome Mediterranean creamed spinach side. Fantastic meal all around!

This is a favorite marinade for chicken in my house and even works when you grill. I do, of course increase all the spices and garlic by nearly twice, but I'm from Louisiana and wouldn't recommend that to just anybody.

We cut the cayenne by about 1/3 and found it very flavorful and satisfactory.

i have made this a few dozen times and you really can't go wrong. this is the lebanese shawarma that i am used to. however, as other reviewers did, i too, slightly increased the spices and then added about 2 tbsp. of fresh parsley (for me the parsley is essential), and cut back on the lemon juice by a third and substituted with water. as i usually don't have whole chickens i've used chicken breast, cut them up raw, and marinated over-night. my lebanese friends love it!!! i usually double the recipe and i still find myself with absolutely no leftovers.

not usually one to eat spicier fare such as this OR food that is distinctly non-american. just prefer down home cookin'. but this has certainly changed my mind; i've even gotten braver in restaurants!

Fragrant and delicious. Based on the reviews I let the chicken marinade for 24 hours and doubled the spices (using sweet paprika rather than hot). It was a big hit.

Rating: 3
3.5 forks, really. Bumped up the spices (thanks to previous reviewers for that), and let it marinate for a full 24 hours. Did chicken pieces instead of halved chickens, and would probably cook only 45 minutes next time. Really wonderful flavors, and very easy.

OMG...this is a wonderful dish! Marinated really good and has a really spectacular taste to it. I'll be making it more often for me, my friends, and my family to enjoy!

I've made this dish several times and just did it again. I like to take the butterflied chicken and grill it over charcoal. This adds another layer of flavor. I agree with others in that I like to use more spices than called for and give it a long time to marinate.

Rating: 3
Simple and delicious. I make this often. It's best if you have time for the long marinade, but still fine if you assemble it at the last minute. Great picnic fare, cold with potato salad.

I have had this recipe clipping in my folder since the day the original magazine article came out but had never actually tried it until this week (you know how it is). Actually my housekeeper made it for dinner this week and it was fabulous! Full of flavor, spicy but only enough to give it a little kick. The thyme adds a wonderful herbal note. We will definitely be eating this more often. Simple everyday ingredients but big flavor. Recommend this highly.

I marinated a whole chicken for 6 hours, then did the "beer-can" trick--open a can of beer, pour out about 1 inch of beer, push chicken down over can, and roast vertically at 350 for about 2 hours. Sounds crazy, but works beautifully, and we got tender, moist, delicious chicken as part of a middle-eastern-themed holiday dinner.

this was okay, nothing special.

Will try this again. I under-spiced the first time but I am very impressed by the recipe. The chicken was so moist and what a combination of flavours!

Rating: 4
The basic marinade was a little too hot so I will use less cayenne pepper next time. The marinade is similar to a carribean dish for grilled shrimp. The difference for that would be in addition add some fresh chopped cilantro and a little vegetable oil to this marinade receipe. The chicken was wonderful!

I have been meaning to try this for a while. It was great. I should have made it sooner. My kids loved it. Will be making it often.

hi, i haven't made this exact recipe, but i make a very similar lebanese marinade -- this one lacks 2 ingredients: tumeric and a mild oil. add both to taste and then marinate skewered chicken/swordfish/lamb/veggies and grill -- you will like it!!

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. In the future, however, I would probobly use more cumin and a little less paprika. The amount of cayenne seemed fine. I have found that you can substitute vinegar for lemon juice if you use slightly less and make up the liquid with stock. It adds a different tang to the dish.

I'm ten years old and I still loved this recipe. Our class had an Egyptain feast and all of us had to bring in something. I cut the chicken into strips, than after baking put toothpicks on them. The flavor is wonderful, I guarntee.

I made it with chicken breast instead, and the results were excellent. I cut the chicken into bite-sized finger food pieces and served it with minted yogurt and pita bread. Next time I'll dilute the lemon juice a bit with water, but otherwise the flavors in the marinade blended well.

Rating: 3
The outcome was quite nice, I did find that the lemon flavor was a little overwhelming so next time I will reduce the amount of lemon juice. I did add some olive oil to the marinade and it came out really well. The recipe is a good solid base for a tasty meal.

I made this for the first time for guests. Not a good idea. The cayenne pepper overpowered everything. Stay away from this recipe if you're not crazy about cayenne pepper.

Delicious! I can now compete with all my neighbors by adding this perfectly seasoned dish to our next get together! I wish you can come up with more Lebanese recipes... they seem to always have the right flavor that pleases most tastes!

We added a little sugar to the marinade and grilled this on the barbecue. It was excellent. We served it with Mjdarra (lentils and rice) and steamed broccoli. Next time we will have sauteed beet greens. There will definitely several next times on the barbecue and in the oven.
