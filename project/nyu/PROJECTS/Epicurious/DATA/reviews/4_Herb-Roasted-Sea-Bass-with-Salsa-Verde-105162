made for a dinner party and was a huge hit. Salsa Verde is wonderful and definitely use half the oil that's recommended. Sea Bass was $35/pound, so I went iwth a monkfish and it was great, but I'm sure with sea bass it would be divine.

at what temperature should you roast the fish?

Will definately be making this recipe again. I left off the salsa and placed the bass on a basmati and long grain rice. Was awesome!!!

Easy to make and delicious! Perfect for a week night dinner, but could also be served to company. We also loved the Salsa Verde that accompanies this dish.

Very tasty and relatively easy dish. I used cod instead of the sea bass and it was just fine. The salsa verde was fresh and tasty. I also used less oil as other readers suggested and was pleased with the result.

Just a thought. It easier to make the salsa in a the blender. The oil can then be added to personal prefernce. I added oil packed sun dried tomatoes to the salsa and omitted the capers. I confess I also tossed in some toasted pine nuts to make the salsa a little more "pesto" in style. The oil did not seperate from the herbs when made in this fashion. Good for casual summertime dining with friends. Served with Venetian Pinot Grigio (cheap wine but tasty in hot weather!)

I love this recipe. I have made a number of times for dinner parties always to rave reviews. The salsa verde is great, and I have also prepared this dish using salmon instead of sea bass. Will continue to make in the future as it is fresh, flavorful & easy!

Absolutely delish. I made this with the frozed bass from Trader Joe's, which is dirt cheap. This is the perfect recipe for it--the roasting cooks the heck out of it and the salsa keeps it moist. I'll make it more often in the summer when my herb garden is busting out, instead of spending $6 on herbs at the market!

This recipe is wonderful. The flavors are subtle and delicious without overpowering the fish. My dinner party LOVED it!

Amazing! I made it when I had my parents and in-laws over for dinner and my mother in law was raving about it for a week! Also, not too complicated. The fish is delicious even without the salsa verde - but the salsa verde is great too. I'd use less oil next time, though.

Substituted a beautiful halibut filet because the seabass at our fish market was past its prime, and didn't bother with the herbs on the fish, just olive oil, salt and pepper. The quality of the fish and the salsa verde made this dish - my in-laws raved.

Your seabass receipe was great, we served it for a guest dinner and everyone raved about it. It is on our list to serve again, and to our family.

I thought it was an interesting dish, but perhaps just not to my specific taste. I grilled the fish and that did work well.

Delicious! The salsa verde makes the recipe a winner!

Delicious recipe, but I agree with the other suggestions that you should use 1/2 cup olive oil for the salsa verde. 1 cup as the recipe calls for is just too oily and not a good consistency for the salsa.

What can I say? This is one of my alltime favorites! I used Chilean Sea Bass, not something I normally do because they are endangered. I served with Salsa Verde,which also was perfect, although I followed the advice of others here and halved the amount of olive oil in the salsa, I suggest everyone do this. You could probably use even a little less than half. Served with lemon asparagus and tomato basil rissoto. I would make this for guests.

Very tasty! Definately use with the "Salsa Verde!"

I made this dish for company, and everyone loved it!! It's so easy to make (I made the sauce the night before). I didn't think it was too oily like other reviewers. The sauce complimented the fish so well. Everyone loved the salsa verde for it's fresh, herby, lemony taste. I am making this again for Mother's Day.

Best if you grill the sea bass, it can be placed directly on the grill & it won't fall apart. It is a terrific, light dish for the summer. Very refreshing & great w/ a light white wine.

Try the salsa verde in the recipe for Pan Seared Halibut with Salsa Verde - it is simple to make and absolutely delicious, not oily at all!

My friend, Ruth H. from Berwyn, PA, is shy about submitting reviews so, with her permission, here are her comments. As did the reviewer from Brooklyn on 12/12/01, for the Salsa Verde, she cut back the olive oil by 1/4 cup, but strongly states that next time the oil will be even less, about 1/2 cup total. The leftover salsa was served with crab cakes, but Ruth feels it would be better with any mild-flavored fish. If the Salsa Verde hadn't been so oily, the recipe would have been awarded 4 stars rather than 3, and my friend Ruth doesn't toss stars around lightly!

All I can say is WOW!!! Absolutely delicious, and not too difficult, even for a beginner like me.

While the recipe for cooking the fish is basic and adds nothing in particular to the flavor of the dish, the "salsa verde" is amazing. I added crushed red chili flakes for spiciness. One thing is that though the sauce calls for 1 cup of olive oil, I used only 3/4 cup and it was still very oily--next time I will use less for a lighter dish. Make this recipe--it is truly incredible.

I can't believe how EASY this was to prepare and how incredible it tastes. The verde sauce would also make an excellent dip for crusty french bread. I served this with the "Sweet potatoes and orange hobo packets" (baked in the oven, not grilled) and a delightful bottle of wine from NW Spain (Burgans Albarino). Bravo!

Followed the recipe exactly, including the Sauvignon Blanc. Prepared a small dinner salad of romane and red leaf lettuce with a olive oil, lemon and fresh garlic dressing. For a vegetable I steamed white asparagus and covered them with the Salsa Verde. My wife is not big on eating fish, but she loved this recipe. I had a small amount left that I microwaved for lunch today. It was every bit as delicious today as it was yesterday. Great recipe and very easy to prepare. I also served it with a fresh loaf of crusty white bread from the bakery. There was no sauce left on either of our plates.

This sea bass recipe is the best I've tasted so far! Seeing that sea bass is such a light, somewhat tasteless fish, the herbs blended perfectly with the slight "kick" of the salsa verde. I used jarred salsa verde for a quicker meal and it was perfect! The meal did not leave you feeling stuffed and goes well with your favorite chardonnay.

The green sauce made the dish. Absolutely delicious.
