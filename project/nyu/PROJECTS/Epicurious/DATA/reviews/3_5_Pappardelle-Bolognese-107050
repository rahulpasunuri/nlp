I agree with "a cook from New York city" that this isn't an authentic Bolgnese without milk to mitigate the acidity of the tomato. While this is a fine sauce, it is not for those who have experienced the simple alchemy of a traditional long-cooking Bolognese.

I have used this recipe over and over again! It it sensational! My husband does not eat veal and likes a little spice, so I substitute ground beef and spicy Italian sausage...otherwise I follow the recipe. We love this!

This is a very authentic and delicious recipe. My husband and I spent our honeymoon in Italy, and found an exquisite one at Nino in Rome, and this is very close! My only suggestion would be to simmer the sauce longer. It took 2 1/2 hours for it to reduce - not the promised 1 1/4 hours. Other than that, wonderful!

I followed the recipe for the most part with a few exceptions. I used ground sirlon in place of the veal, dried thyme and a 29 oz. can of tomato puree. The wine, I scrapped the bottom of 3 different wine bottles to get my 1 cup - chanti, unfiltered port and dry muscatine. Nice flavor. I would make this again. I really liked this recipe, it's even better after it has been refrigerated & rewarmed. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a good recipe to use if you can also experiment. But if you follow the general idea, you can make a delicious meal. Because I'm not a big pork eater, I left out the pork and bacon and added a bit more salt. Also, in the place of veal, I used ground buffalo meat found at the local butcher shop. Some of the reviewers recommended the addition of tomato paste and that may have helped to thicken the sauce. A bit of crushed pepper added some extra zing to the whole thing. Added a cup and a half of Il Poggio, a Sangiovese wine. It costs around $10 and tastes great by the glass as well.

Very good. I substituted ground turkey for the veal and pork. Guests described this as ghoulash.

Not a true Bolognese - too much tomato. I've never heard of a Bolognese sauce without milk / cream. Also, the best Bolognese takes hours to prepare and requires refrigeration overnight to allow fat and ragu to separate. Do not prepare this sauce for anyone from Northern Italy - they will quickly tell you that it's not Bolognese. A better recipe is Mario Batalli's Bolognese for fettuccine - which still has too much tomato, but at least the acidity is cut by the milk.

I bought this magazine in 2002 when it appeared on the newsstand just for this recipe on the cover. I always comes out great, I find to reduce it in 1.5 hrs, I start with quite a steady simmer/boil then turn to low simmer 30 mins before its to be done.

i love this recipe. my two cents: fine to sub beef for veal. add at least one more garlic clove. use one can of tomato puree or cento sauce. use one can of cento paste. well shake a can of low sod beef broth and use just half. cuts simmer time by much. fine to add dried italian seasoning to taste. so easy! yumm!

Four forks after tinkering; added 1 small tomato paste, 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes when tomato puree is added, 1 tablespoon oregano when salt is added.

This recipe is a great base. A three fork rating after modification. 1/4c oil too much, 1 tbs does the job, add in more tomatoes and 1 can paste as well. It really helps to make it more of a SAUCE. The rest is fantastic. The flavor is better the next day as well.

Oh, and I also added about 1/3 cup of marsala, which I really liked.

I liked this recipe, but I made quite a few changes. Tripled the garlic, for one thing, and also processed half of the onion, celery and garlic really finely - I liked that change; it made each bite more flavorful. Added basil, parsley and rosemary. I also added a can of tomato paste to thicken - I agree with other reviewers that it took a lot longer than 1 1/4 hours (I think mine was 2 1/2) - and right before serving I stirred in a little bit of goat cheese, which I think worked to cut the acidity of the tomatoes a little bit and also the flavor was good. Guests loved it; I'd make it again.

This was OK, but there are better recipes for Bolognese sauce out there. We made the recipe as written. The sauce never thickened adequately (even though we cooked it for two and a half hours), was not sufficiently seasoned, and tasted too heavily of animal fat. It was better the second day, with some fat skimmed off and the addition of some ground cinnamon and oregano, but still not worth making again.

I'm not usually a big pasta fan but I wanted to try something different. I substituted sirloin tips and ground turkey for the two ground meats and loved the little bits of tender meat. It was rated as "VERY good" by those who dined.

My husband and I are vegetarians but often miss the fantastic flavors of bolognese and other meat-based dishes. We followed this recipe substituting Smart Bacon, Yves "The Good Ground", and vegetable stock in the appropriate places, as well as adding hot pepper flakes when the thyme was added. It turned out beautifully, and can be a great alternative for vegetarians or those interested in cutting the calories by 75%.

Rating: 3
Prepared this recipe using 1.5# of coarsely ground pork. As always, I use liberal amounts of minced garlic, and also added basil, and oregano along with the thyme. A few pinches of sugar balances the salt in any tomato based sauce, and lends that extra "zing". Another addition I made was 1/4t. of red pepper flakes. Because we are watching our carbs, I served this sauce over crispy sauteed zucchini, yellow crook neck squash, and red bellpepper.

Rating: 3
Definitely a keeper, but there is a trick. The key to this recipe is choosing the right wine to cook with. My partner & I have made it many times with a variety of wines, but it is never better than when made with Velletri Riserva -- an inexpensive ($13 Cdn) Italian red that comes in a smokey bottle with a twisted neck. Also, we agree with other reviewers that it's a better-the-next-day recipe.

Rating: 4
This is by far the best Bolognese recipe I've found. I only made a slight modification: I added about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste along with the tomato puree, as I like a thicker sauce and a more robust tomato flavor. Ths is a fabulous dish I wil make again and again!

Rating: 4
I made this for my book club and everyone went back for more. Many had not sampled papardelle before and loved it. I cut down on the fat in the sauce by reducing the amount of olive oil and cooking the meats separately and draining them before adding them to the sauce. It was still wonderfully flavorful.

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding sauce, with these modifications the best I've ever had...tastes even better the next day or after freezing. Additions / Modifications:...I used 4 slices of bacon, 1/3 cup of Tomato Paste and 1Tbsp. of sugar,salting to taste at the end. I either make my own fresh pappardelle or you can break off pieces of lasagne noodles before cooking for some "down and dirty" pappardele noodles.

The best bolognese recipe on this website or, for that matter, anywhere I have found. I added a chopped portabello mushroom. INCREDIBLE. To the cook who is looking for pappardelle. There is some pasta products by the brand of Rao's. It is a restaurant in New York. They have pasta available online and at some specialty food stores. This is the best pappardelle I have ever had. We buy it a a specialty store named Tony's Meats and More located here in the Denver metro area. Go to raos.com to get more info

I thought this was delicious. Didn't add bacon, and it still came out very tasty. I really liked the pappardelle. I had never heard of this pasta before, but will try to use it again for sure--it was fun to eat!

Rating: 4
Fairly easy to prepare, with the help of a Cuisinart! I had low sodium bacon, so I used four slices. Also, made a mistake and added a full can of tomato puree, so I then skimmed 12 oz of liquid (which included a good amount of the accumulated fat from the meat) from the top. Gradually added most of the juice back - without minus the fat - during the last half hour, along with a Tbsp of tomato paste. Delicious!

Loved it - although I searched 5 different specialty shops and never found pappardelle. Ended up with fettucine which was okay but would love to use the pappardelle. I was unable to even find a source online. Any ideas?

For a big rich bolognese, this definitely does the trick. Out of necessity (no pork mince) I substituted all streaky bacon, half and half with beef mince, tasted lovely. But the real key is: MAKE IT THE DAY BEFORE. On the same day, even cooking it long and slow, the flavours don't fully penetrate the meat. But by day two you've got the full juicy cocktail and I promise you it's worth the wait. Enjoy!

Made this dish for a dinner party last night: fabulous! Its very rich so I'm keeping it to entertaining occassions. I put it on a couple hours before the guests arrived, and just let it simmer away... the longer it simmered, the yummier it got. The best part was how easy it was, and it totally freed me up for socializing, since I didn't have to watch it the whole time. I made a few changes: I used ground sirloin rather than veal (store was out of veal) and I added more wine to give it richer flavor. Everyone raved about it... over pasta, and then people were loading the extra sauce onto crackers and bread and eating it straight!!!

Not worth the effort. Took over two hours to reduce the sauce to an acceptable consistency. Tasted way too "earthy" - not enough tomato taste.

There's no question that the pasta recipe is good. I'd omit bacon, celery or carrot from the sauce, would use fresh basil as the primary herb. "Italian recipe"is an oxymoron. Most true Italian homecooks *always* improvise.

I've tried this as well as Mario's version from awhile back. I prefer his by a country mile. It's more the traditional kind that I'm used to. I know! I know! Like meat loaf, every household has its own recipe. This just turned out far to greasy for me, among other things. And if one follows some of the suggestions a page back, you end up with a close tie to Mario's.

I agree that Mario's taste's better, and it calls for fresh pasta, which is so much easier to do than many people think. However, I'm not trying to stir up a debate worthy of "salted water for boiling," or the plight of the poor, sensative lobster! Go easy on me, folks!

This was a great bolognese. I have now made it a few times (in ten days, mind you!) and since I followed the recipe to the letter the first time (and did enjoy it very much) I am comfortable rating it AND sharing changes I made the next couple of times. I have been really pleased using a thick-cut piece of procuitto instead of bacon, and I have used various combos of veal and pork, beef and veal and pork, and (cheapest) beef and pork. All have been lovely, the last was cheaper and a SLIGHTLY less rich on sensitive tummies. Plenty of fresh thyme is key, but I have also added a few changes: first, a few tablespoons of tomato paste after the meat has browned well and cooked for a few minutes before liquid is added; second, and it sounds a little crazy, but the slightest DUSTING (a pinch) of cinnamon-- it really rounds out the flavors; last, I actually reduced the puree and broth to 14oz of each. It does make a MUCH meatier recipe. And getting the carrot and celery into a really small dice make a difference as well.

Rating: 4
This recipe has good fundamentals. Reading some of the reviews, I made the following changes: pancetta instead of thick cut bacon (be sure to trim the fat from your pancetta a bit), drain most of the fat after you've cooked your meat and before you add your wine. I doubled the tomato puree and added a bit of tomato paste (habit) as well as a bit of sugar (not quite a quarter cup). As with all good sauces, make it in the morning, put it on a low flame, and let it go for the day (I can't see how this sauce can taste "overcooked"). A VERY good sauce that we will definitely make again.

Made this today for a late summer Sunday supper. Took reviewers' advice and added a bit more tomato puree and let it simmer for two hours. Took that long for it to thicken. Also couldn't find pappardelle, so used good-quality penne. We enjoyed it; spouse raved about this and had seconds---and he usually isn't especially fond of pasta dishes. Have lots of left over sauce that we'll freeze and enjoy later on. And will make this again.

This was good and the kitchen smelled heavenly while it was cooking! I added extra tomato sauce and tomatoes because we like our sauce a little more "saucy" and also added extra herbs and garlic.

I have made many a ragu in my years in the kitchen, and this is by far one of the best. It is also one of the easiest! I couldn't get ground pork, so I substituted 1/2 pound ground beef and an extra 1/2 pound ground veal; it worked out fine. I also used penne, as the store was fresh out of pappardelle. It would work with any substantial pasta. Actually, the store was out of a lot of things (I was shopping in a small market while on vacation) and I couldn't get tomato puree so I substituted tomato sauce and thickened it with a bit of tomato paste. I have to admit that I was wary about cooking bacon in the olive oil, thinking that I would wind up with a greasy heavy dish. Nothing could be further from the truth, though, and it seems to me that this step is the secret to the whole thing.

I made this exactly as written (with the pasta as well) except I doubled it knowing it would be great to freeze. It was superb, but I like a little extra tomato sauce mixed in so it's not so meaty-looking. Also, if I could have found some pancetta, I would have used instead. The bacon has too smoky of a flavor for bolognese, but the smokiness actually mellowed after a day or two in the fridge. Excellent recipe!

This was absolutely delicious; I followed the recipe exactly. It made a ton of sauce! Unfortunately, I couldn't find the right kind of pasta anywhere, so substituted broad egg noodles which left a lot to be desired. Will look some more for pappardelle. Recipe was easy to follow; I froze half the sauce for another time.
