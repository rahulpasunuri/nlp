I just made this on a hot summer day at the cottage and was it ever good!! I used a sweet vidalia onion and even added some sweet chili sauce to punch it up and a generous half of lime. Only had one mango on hand and found that a peach (peeled) was a terrific substitute. Fabulous!!! Even without the shrimp it was great. Had something similar in a restaurant and mine was better and of course cheaper!!

One of the most delicious summer soups I have had. I also skipped the shallots, I don't like raw onions/shallots. I am having it for lunch as we speak :)

I'm sorry but I agree. The shallots are way too strong and we ended up throwing it out. Just couldn't handle the taste.

I like the concept and the initial flavor is amazing, but the bite of the raw shallots in this soup cut through the delicate, delicious flavor of the mango, shrimp, ginger and coconut. I would suggest skipping the shallots and leaving them as a side for individuals to sprinkle on.

I loved this recipe! It was very easy to make and came out refreshing and delicious. I am allegic to shrimp and substituted lump crab. It was a great fit.

I made this for a summer BBQ-type party and it was extremely popular. People gobbled it up fast and gave me lots of compliments. I will definitely make this again.

Exceptionally fast, delicious, and beautiful. I made only one substitution, of lime juice for lemon juice, since I had limes on hand. I also threw in a little bit of lime zest. The soup is a lovely yellow color, due to the mangos, and has a creamy, frothy texture that's complimented by the shallots, garlic, and curry. I could eat this every day.
