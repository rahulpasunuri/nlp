I gave this four forks only because it's pretty hard to make plain old summer squash taste good. But this recipe is simple and really quite yummy. I made it exactly as written. I had to add a little more salt than I wanted to bring out the flavor, but it was worth it.

using what i had i sauteed julienned carrots, a bit of diced red pepper, thinly sliced onions, chopped garlic and julienned yellow squash. i used butter and olive oil in equal portions and sauteed veggies to crisp tender doneness. i had no herbs but it was surprisingly tasty as it was. next time will use basil as i don't care for tarragon.i served with pork filet with garlic and pepper rub and sweet potatoes.

I had my doubts as this was cooking up, but the flavors were delicious! I followed the recommendation of adding fresh basil. Will definitely make it again!

Missing a few ingredients, I improvised at bit. With the thinly sliced onion, and chopped garlic, I added green bell pepper, red bell pepper and herbs de province seasoning (in lieu of if the tarragon). Turned out great!

The dish is really light and tasty. The only extra ingredient I added was a bell pepper. The squash take much longer to cook down than the recipe states, but it was worth the wait. Yum!

I thought this was just OK. Tarragon (fresh from garden) was a little overpwoering for me, as squash is so mild. Added some basil, parsely, and dill to perk it up.

didn't have any tarragon handy, but there was a jar of tarragon mustard in the fridge, so i added about a teaspoon of that and 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the onions and garlic. it was great. next time, i'll substitute EVOO for half the butter, just to cut the fat.

I made this according to the recipe the first time but felt it could be taken to the next level. Luckily for me I have access to a wonderful farmers market with a wonderful array of different squashes. I sauteed garlic & slivered walla walla onions, then I added several cut up baby squashes, sauteed them until they were starting to break down, then I had some roasted red peppers in the fridge I added & some heirloom tomatoes from the market. Instead of the tarragon, I added some fresh thyme & then LOTS of torn basil... finished off with a little EVOO, s&p & it was to die for. Oh & I did it in my wok!

Simple and great. I used local organic Patty Pan squash, and it was delicious! It really does not need cheese, bread crumbs or extra butter if you use tasty, fresh squash!

Didn't love, but will make again as it's so simple in case I have squash in the house and need a quick side dish. Put the breadcrumbs on as one reviewer suggested and wish I hadn't--ended up just scraping them off. They masked the good taste of the squash, and didn't convince my DH or kids to eat it!

This is a quick, easy, but very tasty side dish. My family loved it.

this dish is a bit of a staple in my home. Sometimes, after its cooked I will put it in a baking dish and sprinkle it with seasoned bread crumbs on the top and pop it in the broiler for about 5 mins. until browned. this is the way that my husband likes it made..

Very easy and fast. I used half butter and olive oil. Didn't have any tarragon, so I used parsley. Excellent!

Very easy, my family loves it and it can be dressed up (red peppers or green, sauteed mushrooms) or down

I personally am not a big veggie fan, but these were so tasty. I added red pepper for add'l flavor and color and 1/2 parmesian as well. I served with the mortadella pork loin recipe and it was great balance/color. Had a Rhone-style blended red and it was balanced all the flavors.

Very easy. made it the day before-- then heated it up in the oven. I took other's advice and added parmesan cheese to the recipe--probably 1/2 a cup and it was really good.

We really enjoyed this recipe. We added red bell pepper for colour and flavour. It went really well with steak and cilantor sauce.

Planted tarragon in my herb garden this summer. Never really used it before in any dishes, this saute was just delicious! I didn't change a thing...

I have to say, this recipe was extremely easy. I added mushrooms, red peppers, and used 1tsp of tarragon and 1tsp of basil. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese after it had cooked. My family eats nothing but green beans and corn, but they really liked this!

This is a simpler version of an old favorite. I use at least half, sometimes all, olive oil for the saute medium and usually add a sliced red or green pepper for more color. Quartered tomatoes added close to the end are good too, as is a goodly grating of parmesan cheese.

It's a quick side dish, easy enough to make, but I didn't find anything exciting about it. I think I am fan of steamed or grilled squashes, though, so perhaps that is where my opinion comes from.

Very good! Im not a squash eater but I had it in the fridge and said why not. Sub basil instead of Taragon, when placed on plate put small ammound of Feta over then Parmesan. Used 1 sick instead of half, and made some Garlic butter bread, cut into fourths to go around. Tastes wonderful for summer!

Good, easy recipe. I made it with assorted squashes from our Farmer's Market and sweet Vidalia onions.

Great simple recipe, after the I removed it from the stove I covered the top with mozzarella cheese and let it melt into the saute. There were no leftovers.

Nice flavor for a change from the everyday. Goes well with pork tenderloin, also.
