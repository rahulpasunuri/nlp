This was a great quick recipe and my picky toddler asked for seconds. I used brown rice to make it more nutritious and served it with a side of natural balkan style yoghurt.

Ok, I'm not sure what all the negative comments were about - this was no less appealing than any other veggie stew I make; it was surprising to see almost four forks on this and then read such reviews. My whole family found this very good. The only alterations - I'd already cooked some mung beans and had them on hand trying to figure out what to do with them. Also, followed the advice of some reviewers and added more cumin and red pepper flakes. We really liked it and didn't find it "unappealing" at all.

I've made this a couple of times, but slightly different each time since I never seem to follow a recipe exactly. Variations I used: adding soaked soybeans in addition to the mung beans, adding 1 tsp ground coriander in addition to the cumin, extra carrots, cooking the rice in the stew, less rice than called for, and using cilantro instead of mint. Came out tasting great both times, but yes...less than appealing to look at.

Being born and raised in Uzbekistan, mash chiri (mash soup) was one of the main courses and was served not with yougurt but what we call kaimak (in America it will be something between creme fraiche and sour cream). Also forget the mint, we don't really use mint in Central Asia, scallions or cilantro usually accompany every soup or stew. Also strips of dough (not pasta) can be added: just cut dough in 1/2" strips or roll it into noodles. Also for those who have problems getting over the specific aroma of lamb, use beef or veal, try to get the fattier peices and first boil it to make the base for the soup. We don't eat pork and rearely use chicken in this dish.

Being a Middle Eastern, this was not a very special recipe, yet it was filling and satisfactory. I agree with the post that suggests lamb meat. May I also suggest cilantro instead of mint. Could be a good match with cumin. I might cook it again to use up the mung beans left.

This was horrible. I had to throw it away. I didn't use any tomatoes or hot pepper though. I couldn't even fix it- it was hopeless. I don't think I will make it again.

I love central Asian food but this dish was lacking in the warm spicy flavors of the region. We made it without tomatoes but with extra veg, as recommended in the recipe, since it was February and I don't think the styrofoam tomatoes for sale in the market would have done much good. I agree with the previous reviewer that the main purpose for this dish is to use up a bag of mung beans bought for another dish. If I did make it again for that purpose, I would definitely do it with lamb fat and lamb meat and lots more spice.

This was a very satisfying, flavorful dish! The recipe did not indicate whether to use whole or split mung dal, so I just used split dal and did not soak it---added it at the required time, and it came out fine. I was also a little lazy in the tomato-chopping department and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh--still excellent results!

I searched for recipes to use the mung beans that I bought, and that is why I tried this. It was good to use up the mung beans, but otherwise not worth repeating. They tasted much like black-eyed peas. It did go very well with lamb shanks with rosemary and garlic. True... it's not very visually appealing, either. The best thing I can say is it's great if you're craving starch, with the beans, rice AND potatoes!

A very hearty, unfussy meal for vegetarian guests (sans lamb, of course). I really enjoy this recipe and have prepared it maybe 15 or 20 times now. Necessity and curiosity have caused me to experiment with it, but each time it turned out at least pretty good, if not downright excellent. I usually make it extra spicy and use the yogurt for relief. Black-eyed peas work even better than mung beans, and you can use frozen beans if you haven't been planning ahead. The mint is important.

I liked this one. The mung dal have a rather strong and spicy taste so that the use of only cumin is in fact quite sufficient. However, I believe there is a slight mistake in this recipe: in my opinion the potatoes should be added about 10 minutes before finishing, otherwise they will disintegrate entirely. I left them out anyway, as I don't believe they are essential.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I had the same in Kazakhstan and it was delicious! I also just wanted to comment that Azeri is a Turkic language.

Augh! This tasted delicious, but looked really, REALLY unappealing. Any suggestions? As it is, I'm going to be eating the whole pot I made this time by myself, owing to friends' unwillingness to get past the look of it and actually taste it.

I loooooooooooove this recipe! I use less oil, but otherwise make it exactly as written. Really good, especially when it's cold or rainy outside.

OK, this is a great recipe. I used 3 cups of the mung beans, and also added some veggie lamb (seitan, probably) that I got at the asian market. It needed a couple extra cups of broth, as the mung beans soaked up a lot of liquid. Don't skimp on the mint or yogurt- these ingredients really make this dish come alive.

This was easy and tasted even better than it sounded. My husband and I loved it. I used ground cumin instead of cumin seed and added extra carrots and potatoes since I didn't have any tomatoes. I will try it with the tomatoes next time.

In India this is called Kichiri - a staple and a comfort food. It is highly nutritious and my kids just love it. It is great with plain yogurt and potato crisps or pickled vegetables.

Had it with yogurt. Excellent!

This dish was very easy to make and came out surprisingly delicious. I did not soak the mung beans nor precooked the rice, instead I added both at the same time. I noticed that the cooking time was about the same for rice and beans. The dish had a texture of risotto and mung beans added wonderful sweetness. Both my husbund and I loved it!

Really, really satisfying. I used brown rice instead of white, and as moong dal is unavailable here, red lentils. It was delicious, and I am already looking forward to making it again.

This recipe was fairly quick, very easy and remarkably tasty (with a few minor alterations). I added the tiniest bit of smoked pork fat to the recipe and the taste was great. Bacon would probably have a similar effect. I also added a little extra hot pepper (my taste), and used black eyed peas instead of mung beans. Cumin powder seemed to work instead of the seeds. I served it over Basmati rice. Everyone I served the dish to loved it.

This was a very good and easy recipe. It wasn't too spicy, but the yogurt really added something. We used leftover rice and kidney beans, rather than the mung beans, and the recipe turned out great!
