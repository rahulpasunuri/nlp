This recipe was fantastic. I used less mushrooms, and then threw in some grape tomatoes at the last minute, and served it over pasta. I'm definitely making this one again!

A nice side dish for steak. I substituted fat free half-and-half for the cream. I added it last and cooked only until it was heated through so it did not turn stringy.

I didn't add cream and didn't boil off all the madeira (left just about 2 tablespoons) and the first time I made this, my guests loved it. I served it as part of the hors d'oevres, almost like a tapa. People would have the mushrooms with bread to soak the juices.

This is very good. We added a bit more Madeira and boiled it down a bit more. Goes great with the Venetian Liver dish.

This was really quite yummy. We didn't have any madeira wine, but had some marsala wine handy and substituted. Very good. Of course we added lots (tons) of fresh garlic.

I love mushrooms and was so looking forward to this recipe. The madeira give the mushrooms a nice sweet taste. I, however, did not like the heavy cream which I thought dampened the flavor. I've started to make this dish without the cream and have liked it very much that way.
