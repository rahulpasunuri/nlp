Made this for a 'family' dinner at a shared house of seven adults with everyone happy with it following a roast lamb leg. There were several groans of pleasure and much appreciation. Outside of peeling and coring the pears (which are both easy enough), there's nothing to putting the dish together. You can just whack it in the oven before you sit down to dinner, and whip the cream just before serving it, making it perfect for entertaining. A nice, satisfying yet light dessert.

Made this as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving. This was good but not outstanding for a three or four star rating.

Made this for a friend who always refuses "sweets" and it was a big hit. Used almond orange biscotti which added a citrus flavor to the filling, making it more tart for my dessert hater and added a bit more sugar to the whipped cream for the rest of us who like it sweet. It was a perfect finish to a heavy Italian pasta dinner.

This recipe was delicious. I substituted four biscotti (two chocolate and two almond) for the filling. That turned out to be an excellent change. I also was out of almond liqueur, however I had rum. I added 2 tablespoons to the chilled whipping cream, however it turned out way to strong. Overall, my guests loved them and so did we.

Recipes that include pureed sauce are usually good and this one is, but I don't like the PINK of the almond liquer
