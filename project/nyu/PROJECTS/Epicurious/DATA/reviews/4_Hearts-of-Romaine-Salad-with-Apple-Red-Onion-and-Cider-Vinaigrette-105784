Very good. In my opnion, you don't need the pecans but the texture is nice. What it does need is basil, or you could use fennel bulb instead. Either way, avocado would be welcome here. I think Gorgonzola would overpower the sublte taste of the spices.

A very lovely salad! I used grapeseed oil, which has a nice, nutty flavor, but I think the recipe calls for vegetable oil so that the apple and spice flavors can stand out better. Like other reviewers, I crumbled some gorgonzola on top too. I think a nice white cheddar or feta would work well also. This would make perfect finger food if all ingredients (except lettuce) were diced small, tossed with the dressing, and stuffed into endive leaves. That would be a terrific hors d'oeuvre.

I changed this recipe quite a bit, but it was amazing. I used olive oil (and only used a cup). I omitted the onion slices and apples, and added bacon, blue cheese, and craisins instead.

Spiced pecans really add something to this recipe. I bought pre-roasted pecans from the bulk section and followed Epicurious' Spiced Holiday Nuts recipe with the curry, ginger and cayenne. I substituted mixed baby greens for romaine and added some shredded carrots for Thanksgiving color. The dressing as written seemed a little salty, but it went over well on the salad. Next time, though, I will probably cut back on the salt a bit.

Fabulous. Everyone raved. Served individually. I used spiced pecans instead of roasted and added gogonzola cheese. The pecans, cheese, onion, and apple were placed on different "corners" of the salad. Added some red lettuce for color. Followed other reviewers suggestions of more apple juice, but other than that...No changes.

I followed a prior reviewer's advice and used 3/4 c of eevo instead of the vegetable oil. I used baby romaine lettuce instead of the hearts. I thought it was wonderful, and everyone raved about how great it was. Definitely a keeper, and I will make it again.

I served this at a baby shower luncheon along with a quiche. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I will make this for Thanksgiving. It is wonderful.

This salad was EXCELLENT! A huge hit! I added gorgonzola cheese and it really added a nice finish to it! The salad dressing was fantastic; although I added a few more teaspoons of the apple concentrate. I give it two thumbs WAY UP!

I made this recipe last night and we used regular romaine lettuce instead of the hearts and my boyfriend was helping me and accidentally chopped the lettuce up in one-inch pieces instead of three-inch pieces. We didn't have apple juice concentrate so we omitted it and added a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acidity of the vinegar and it was just as good. We also used dates instead of pecans, because we couldn't find them. It was delicious and would definitely make it again!

So YUM!! I love the apples in the vinaigrette!! I left out the apple juice concentrate and it was still amazing! Also I just chopped up the lettuce, tho I'd like to see a photo of what the author had in mind for the hearts.

Very special and simple. Didn't bother with hearts, just used torn leaves.

We really enjoy this salad. I tear the romaine leaves, & mix everything in a large bowl. Also leave the skin on the apples for extra colour. I can't always find frozen apple juice concentrate, so I've used apple jelly, melted in the microwave, with equal success.

I got rave reviews on this salad. Made it for a dinner with 13 adults and 2 kids and it was exactly enough. Per other suggestions, I only used 3/4 cup of oil, and added a little extra apple juice concentrate and it was perfect. I also left the skin on the apples for color and sliced the lettuce into 1 inch pieces, and let the apples sit in the dressing for about 30 mins. I used extra pecans, and put them on the side with the onions so people could put them on or leave them off. Easy and excellent!

This is a delicious salad. Followed the advice below and did not put onions on at the end. Used yellow delicious apples and added pearslices. Boiled down apple juice instead of concentrate and added two spoons of sugar while boiling down. Will definitely make again.

Made this as a light accompaniment to our Thanksgiving dinner....everyone from the youngest (5) to the oldest adult loved it and asked for the recipe....we left off the raw onions on top of the salad and it was still perfect! Would make again for another dinner party or gathering.

while i was preparing to toss this salad i dropped the glass container of dressing so had to start all over. without frozen concentrate i decided to put in some cranberry juice instead and cut down a bit on the amount of vinegar and oil. i was feeling creative and added some avacado,dried cranberries and bacon to the salad. i'm not sure the dropped dressing did much to condition my hardwood floor but it did get my guests up off the couch! we all agreed that this is one of the best salads ever and i won't bother with frozen juice concentrate anymore. yum!

This is also a great quick recipe using just the delicious dressing, romaine lettuce, cut up gala apples and toasted pecans all tossed together.

Yummy and light salad that was perfect accompaniment to a big new year's eve dinner. Easy to make and helped that you could prepare most items in advance. As was recommended by others, I used a bit less than 1 cup of the veg oil which made the dressing delicious. We are not fans of raw onions so for future I will leave out the thinly sliced onions. Dressing was even better the next day.

LOVED this recipe! The dressing was so simple yet superb and would work with any number of salad ingredient combinations. I couldn't stop "tasting" this as I mixed it because it was so good, and one guest indicated he wanted to lick his plate clean. I had a good result cutting the oil down by about 1/3 so that the flavor of the dressing came through more. I didn't have frozen apple juice concentrate so just boiled-down regular apple juice to a syrup consistency, and I ended up adding a little extra to taste.

Delicious salad!!!! I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup and doubled the apple juice concentrate. I let the apples and onions soak in the dressing for about 30 minutes before adding the romaine and pecans.

Excellent salad, lovely flavors. I cut the romaine vertically in quarters and then horizontally in 1 inch strips, put all ingredients in big bowl and tossed with about 1/4 of the total amount of dressing. Everyone loved this salad, but with so much on our Thanksgiving plates. . .well, you know. Will make this again for company dinners. WOW!

This salad is now my and my fiance's favorite fall/winter salad. I have made it several times and every time I make it, he raves about it. I substitute the roasted pecans for cinnamon roasted nuts (which you can find in the snack isle of most grocery stores) and they are wonderful on this salad. This is definitely a winner!

Definitely a 3 1/2 fork rating - everyone RAVED about this salad which was shocking to me since it was so easy and simple. Definitely a keeper and perfect for company!

I made this to accompany a cheese fondue and was fantastic. I altered the dressing slightly by using 8 tablespoons of oil, 4 tablespoons of cider vinegar and omitted the red onion. Soaking the red onion for the salad was a nice way to remove the harshness of the onion. I also substituted walnuts for the peacans. Great salad!

I feel like I'm cheating by reviewing this recipe, since I haven't made the salad in it's entirety, but the dressing is EXACTLY what I've been looking for for months! I wanted something different for http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105714 - the APPLE, ROQUEFORT, AND RED LEAF LETTUCE WITH PUMPERNICKEL CROUTONS (which I make without the bacon or the croutons!) - and this is it. I didn't have apple juice concentrate, so I just added an extra tablespoon of cider vinegar, and some sugar to make up for it.

It was yummy! I had never used vegetable oil as a dressing so I was nervous. (I am new to cooking!) Huge raves. I was a bit more generous with the frozen apple concentrate and I used all of the romaine lettuce, not just the hearts. Enjoy!

I'm not normally prone to gushing, but this recipe is an exception. It was so good that several of my guests for New Years Eve dinner were caught in the kitchen dipping spoons into the bowl of leftover dressing (and this was before the champagne flowed!)I used Gala apples, but didn't peel and dice, rather just cored and sliced very thin. I loved the color contrast, and the flavor was excellent. Roasted the pecans in the oven after "misting" them with a bit of olive oil and sprinkling with just a touch of curry powder. Wow! It's everyones new favorite salad.

If you want to impress your guests, try this one. I used spinach instead of romaine. And I marinated the apples and the onions in the dressing for a bit before tossing with the spinach. My dinner guest asked for the recipe. What better compliment?

This is an unexpectedly superb salad. Four adults and three children all loved it. We made it again the next day, and our guest took the recipe. We only halved to romaine hearts, rather than halving them, then cutting into thirds. They held the dressing better that way.

Want to make a salad stand out - make this one! I was a bit skeptical about the spices in the dressing but it really made a plain-old salad a conversation piece. Just right for the season.

This tangy salad will make a welcome addition to thanksgiving this year. I ommitted the oil. And I used equal parts of apple juice (not concentrated-because you can't buy it here) to the vinegar plus a tsp of sugar. Was really good-and different.
