Tried this on a whim because I was looking for meatless dishes. I'd never even heard of caponata before. It's very good. The recipe didn't specify how much garlic to use so I used 2 cloves, diced.

This was disgusting.

I really loved this recipe, it wasn't a bit bland (like I thought it was) Quick to make if you have the right ingrediants!
