This was good, although I didn't find you could really taste the pumpkin seeds. A nice option if you want pesto and only have parsley available, but otherwise I would just make basil pesto if I had the option.

A delightful variation on classic basil pesto. Very fresh-tasting. I serve it with pasta (it's especially good with filled pasta like ravioli or tortellini) but I agree that it would make an amazing pizza sauce!

I loved this recipe. In the past, I've only made traditional basil and pine nut pesto, but I had a ton of parsley leftover from another recipe and had pepitas on hand, so I decided to give it a whirl. Very delicious, nutty and not over pungent like I thought it might be. I plan on using it as a sauce for goat-cheese pizza with zucchini, I think it will be great!

I made some modifications based on what was available: I used pine nuts and a few walnuts instead of pepitas, arugula instead of parsley, and a couple of tablespoons of toasted walnut oil with the olive oil. YUMMY! We used our fingers to eat every bit of the pesto. Also, I just plunked all of the ingredients into the processor instead of the listed directions, which worked just fine. I put this on creamy artichoke raviolis.

An excellent recipe. We enjoy Basil Pesto with the traditional Pine Nuts regularly, and I was a little sceptical about Pumpkin Seeds and Parsley.....but this preparation is delicious. Many Epicurious recipes call for toasted Pepitas and claim they be made to puff or pop; mine never do although they toast dependably stirred and swirled around in a teflon frying pan. (( My Pepitas are fresh )) I use whole wheat Penne rather than Spaghetti most of the time, including this time. This is a good vegetarian recipe but I cheat to the extent of stirring in a LITTLE melted butter to the hot pasta in the bowl then I drop the Pesto on top and toss the Penne/Pesto/Butter combination a second time with tongs. Just enough butter for subtle flavor and to keep the Penne pieces separate as the bowl cools. Maybe 1-1/2 tablespoons of butter. Yummy....Butter....YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT.

This is great. The toasted pumpkin seeds add an earthy tone to it, while the parsley gives a fresh accent to the earthiness. Very good just tasting it off the spoon. In addition to any pasta, this would be good as a sauce for anything grilled. A tip like with all pesto to keep it green is to keep a thin layer of olive oil over the top at all times when storing (includes after each use before putting back in the fridge).

I made this when I had an excess of parsley and some pepitas left over from another recipe. It's a nice 'fresh' taste that is a pleasant change from traditional pesto. I would make it again.

I like parsley pesto as an alternative flavor to the traditional basil pesto, and the pepitas were a great idea. This is delicious spooned over fish, spread onto a pizza crust, drizzled over veggies, or (of course) with pasta.

I made this and it turned out pretty well. I have family members who are allergic to pine nuts so the pepitas as an alternative was intriguing to me. Next time I'm going back to using basil instead of the parsley.
