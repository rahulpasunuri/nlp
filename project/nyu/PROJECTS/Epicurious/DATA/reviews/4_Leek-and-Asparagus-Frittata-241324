Outstanding recipe, even my kids loved this one, and one of them does not really care for eggs. I made this almost according to the recipe, but added a small ammount of heavy wipping cream prior to wisking the eggs. It was fluffy, flavorfull, and was a dinner in one dish.

This is delicious. I used half the amount of butter called for and subbed half the eggs for egg whites to cut down on the saturated fat. Note to x_isfor_alex: I'm sure what you made was delicious, but you made an entirely different recipe, not this one. *lol* It looks like you substituted all of the ingredients ... so not quite sure what the value is in rating this one.

I made this with a couple substitutions so i didnt have to run to the grocery and it was still delicious. used green onions instead of leeks. did not add mushrooms. 9 eggs, a lil more butter. added 3 tablespoons of milk to the eggs. used mozzarella and topped with a sprinkle of grated jarlsberg. baked it at 375 for about 10-12 min then put the jarlsberg on top and put the broiler on hi. cooked it perfectly

This recipe is fabulous! I make for Christmas Brunch every year. I add chopped Honey Baked Ham to the fritatta. Not only is it good for a little extra flavor, but also good for color.

Easy and exceptional! Made this in a flash after a long day at work. Didn't have fontina or mushrooms, so I substituted cheddar and a little ham and spring onions (instead of leeks) - otherwise, all was the same. It was perfect.

After I made this dish, I took one bite and said, "Wow! I think I am a really good cook!" My daughter promptly said, "No, it isn't very good." So, this gets three forks because I loved it, husband loved it, but it bombed with the bambino (age 6). Also, it was a little salty so would go lighter on the salt than what was required on the recipe.

I was very lucky to get asparagus, spring onilns and eggs all from an Amish farm in PA yesterday. Man this this recipe rocks with that. Added a little proscuitto and corn

This was a hit! I followed the directions exactly and brought it to a break the fast, it was the first dish to go. I used this recipe the following morning as my base and instead of using asparagus, I used spinach and before I tossed it into the oven I added some smoked salmon and cream cheese on top and broiled. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I recently made this recipe for a brunch and it was a huge hit! Good flavor and texture. I added a little olive oil to the butter/leek mixture right before adding the mushrooms and asparagus because it seemed a little dry. Worked out perfectly!

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious! The fontina cheese is wonderful! From perusing the reviews, you can tell that you can take liberties with this recipe, substituting various ingredients. I made mine as the recipe states, except I used regular mushrooms instead of shiitake (what I had one hand).

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe exactly, it came out great. I did sauté the asparagus a bit longer to ensure the asparagus was tender. Make sure you put it under the broiler, until it puffs and the cheese starts to brown. Depending on your oven, it may take a bit longer. Keep an eye on it.

I followed the basic "outline" of this recipe (whisked eight eggs together with herbs de provence, salt & pepper) and used whatever I had in the refrigerator (onions, garlic, asparagus, sharp white cheddar cheese, chicken sausage, and yukon potato slices). I also took the suggestion of others and sautéed all the vegetable together until potatoes were tender before folding in the eggs and putting the pan under the boiler for approximately six minutes. It turned out fantastic and would suggest to others to be adventurous when creating their frittata, anything can go into it!.

Rating: 4
Like others, I sauteed the asparagus, leeks and mushrooms - added to the beaten egg/cheese mixture - poured into a non-stick 8 inch cake pan and baked at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Beautiful and super-easy brunch recipe and perfect for a Spring Sunday morning! Highly recommend! The only thing I may add next time is a little chopped fresh thyme.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used shallots instead of leeks, and left out the mushrooms. I aslo used Gruyere cheese instead of Fontina. Also added some fresh basil... yum! Baked at 325 F for 35 minutes and broiled 2 minutes to give the top some crispiness.

Rating: 3
Super yummy! Not a big shiitake mushroom fan so substituted crimini mushrooms which I sauteed separately to get them golden brown before adding to the leaks. To save some time I cooked the asparagus separately too until almost done then added to the other veggies. I dont own a ovenproof skillet so after mixing in the eggs I poured the whole thing into a pie dish and baked in the oven for about 18min at 350. We all loved it.

I decided to make this frittata and skip the extra fat and calories of a quiche. What a lovely surprise. This was an easy and delicious recipe for brunch! I made some significant modifications that I think made it even better. I used a chippolini onion instead of the leaks, crimini mushrooms, and Comte cheese. I also added a 1/8 tesp of red chili pepper flakes and about a 1/2 tesp of fresh thyme, minced. As per other reviewers, I too poured it in an oil sprayed 8" x 8" pyrex and baked it at 325 for 35 min. It came out light fluffy and cut PERFECTLY into 4 squares and I served it with a dallop of non-fat sour cream, parsely and a side salad. Delish!!

Rating: 3
I followed the directions for the most part, using only 3/4c shredded Gruyere and Fontinella cheeses. I took one reviewer's advice and baked this at 325F for 45-50 mins in a buttered Pyrex pie dish since broiling makes my oven smoke and sets off the fire alarms. It was perfectly set and delicious, and we enjoyed it for breakfast as well as dinner the evening before.

This is my first time making frittata, and this recipe was great. I freestyled a bit using what I had -- instead of asparagus, used thinly cut kale; instead of fontina, used a mix of muenster and another cheese; didn't have mushrooms and didn't miss them; and didn't have parmesan either and anyway, that might have made it too salty for my taste. I think it's a forgiving recipe that allows for mixing and matching... really just used recipe for proportions. Light, fluffy, very nice.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was fantastic! I did make a few changes which I think only improved upon the recipe. I didn't use mushrooms but I added artichoke hearts, (quartered) and red bell pepper, (diced). I also added 1/2 cup of half and half. I doubled the recipe and it fed 7 people with a lot leftover so it wasn't necessary but then it depends on how many other items you are serving. The amount of half and half I mentioned is for 8 eggs. The fontina cheese must of been what made this so darn good! This frittata had a surprisingly excellent flavor! .

You will wish that you had made enough of this dish for leftovers. It's addictive. Also, if you are making a frittata for the first time, there are many how-to step by step directions and videos on the internet--very helpful.

This just may be the best frittata recipe in the world. In any case, it is very, very good. I read all of the reviews, and used a few suggestions. I did not use leeks, but put in some mild onion and some shallots. I cut back on butter, salt and pepper. I added a little ham, and used baby bella mushrooms. I suspect that this is a very forgiving recipe, and can be modified in many ways. I used a well seasoned iron skillet, and had no problems with sticking. I lifted the egg mixture occasionally, to help it to cook. I cooked it slowly, which may have helped. It also was not at all dry. The slightly runny top and edges finish cooking under the broiler. I loved this frittata.

Rating: 2
This was just all right. It tasted good, but I only gave it two forks, because the cheese overrode the leeks and asparagus so that we couldn't really taste them. It was also really rich, and I just prefer a lighter frittata - something more "healthy."

Rating: 4
Hi, I got rave reviews a few weeks ago when I had a brunch. Changes: I cooked in a pyrex dish, and it came out great (like quiche without the crust); used shallots instead of leeks and used substantially less cheese (maybe half to 3/4 cup asiago/cheedar mix), but added a 1/4 cup whipping cream.

Rating: 4
This is such an excellent and easy recipe. I've had wonderful frittatas made by other people before, but had never attempted them myself. But this was such a pleasant surprise. So yummy. As it was my first time I followed it to the letter and I did not experience any 'sticking'. I suspect that is due to gently folding in the egg mixture to the already buttered veggie pan or that I used an excellent non stick IKEA pan that is flawless and a great value for the money. If you're in Turkey you can substitute beyaz peynir (white cheese) for the Fontina and I added a little gruyere. Next time I will use my frittata pan and skip the broiling. I will also play with spices. Hot red peppers would have worked nicely with these wonderful flavors. I will make this recipe forever and every chance I get.

just wanted to add that I went ahead and sauteéd the veggies as directed, but I separately beat the eggs, grated the cheeses then beat them into the eggs, and finally mixed in the veggies. poured into a greased pie dish and baked at 325º for 35 minutes-until lightly browned. (in fact, I made the entire mixture the night before) this recipe makes a wonderful frittata.

this is not a review, but a question. this recipe sounds yummy, just wondering if anyone tried making this like a traditional frittata? I'm wondering why can't you sauté the veggies separately, mix in the eggs and bake in pie dish instead of broiling? that would eliminate the sticking-to-the-pan problem? thanks, -sp

Great, easy recipe. I used a cast iron skillet and it did stick but I'm not sure I cared. Not necessary to use shiitake, the flavor didn't come through enough to justify the cost. I used soy-sation three cheese blend (melts beautifully and tastes good) and a pint of egg whites. Very much worth making for a brunch.

Rating: 4
I trusted the reviews of fellow cooks when choosing this recipe, and wasn't disappointed! It is really very savory and the flavors blend beautifully together. I did cook the asparagus much longer than suggested -- I preferred them more tender than crunchy, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Also, I had trouble with the eggs...I wasn't sure whether to keep folding them in, or to just let them sit and set...any suggestions for a light fluffy frittata?

Rating: 4
OMG I have never followed any recipe so closely as this one. I thought what the heck I am going to try. So the only thing not exact was about 1/2 cup more mushrooms, other than that I did it exactly. It was so good!! I served it with really pedestrian hashbrown potatoes.Christmas eve, alone without the kids for the first time...very sad. Well this did cheer us up and we will make it again and again!! Serve with a good Chardonnay and enjoy!

Made this exactly per instructions with the addition of 1 clove of garlic. Used a cast iron pan and had no sticking issues. It was, however, a little salty for my tastes but my guests didn't feel the same, so it just could be my palate. I'd use less next time, but overall it was simply delicious!

As good as everyone said. I used cheddar instead of fontina, and the vegetables took a little longer to cook than the recipe indicated. But very easy and delicious.

I am very pleased with the way this recipe turned out. I used scallions in place of leeks, broccoli (with stems) instead of asparagus, and substituted plain old cheddar for the fontina. My fritata did stick to the bottom of the pan a bit, but I used a plastic spatula to loosen it up (thanks, Spidergirl1!). It is very light, fluffy, and not at all dry.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used button mushrooms and feta (instead of fontina and parm) because that is what I had on hand. Perfect. I also sprinkled some fresh garlic chives on top before broiling because I have some growing on my deck. I used one leek from my garden, and that seemed to be just right for the recipe.

This recipe was tasty and easy. I added some extra leeks and less mushrooms, but otherwise kept everything the same. Delicious for dinner and for breakfast the next morning. I think I would add bacon or ham next time, but then again, I tend to think most things taste better with bacon.

Made this for a Mother's Day brunch yesterday. Had to leave out the mushrooms because most of my family doesn't like them, and used gruyere instead of fontina. Delicious and so easy. A long flexible plastic spatula works great for loosening the fritatta from the pan.

This was my first time making a fritatta and it came out great. I used a metal skillet and the bottom wound up sticking to the pan, so we did our best to get the wedges out neatly. I used cheese I had on hand - mix of feta and goat and we loved the strong punch of flavor from those. It did seem a bit dry though - not sure how to fix that.

Wonderful recipe. No need to broil if you don't have a broil safe skillet. Bake at 400 until top is browned and cheese is melted. Got rave reviews from my lunch guests today.

This is the sort of recipe that elicits exclamations bordering on the obscene (and I mean that in a good way)! I skipped the butter and used olive oil, and substituted a soft non aged Manchego for the Fontina and a Parmiggiano-Reggiano mix for the Parmesan, as well as drizzling some black truffle oil as suggested by another reviewer on each wedge before serving. Perfection! This will definitely become a brunch staple.

A great dish for the half of a bundle of leftover asparagus I always seem to end up with! I substituted a sweet onion for the leeks and topped it off with herbed tomato slices (I broiled them for five or six minutes and then arranged them on top to finish off with the frittata). Excellent and so easy!

Rating: 1
Sorry, this is, like the forks display, just ok. Love all the ingredients, but it's much easier to saute the vegetables on stove top, & then add the eggs/cheese & scramble. Your method is too much ado for basically the same results. Plus, doing it my way might appeal to soft scramble people better as well.....frittatas are so dry.

Rating: 4
I really loved this Frittata. I used scallions instead of the leeks, as I am not as familiar with them. The only other deviation was that I transfered the contents to a baking dish and baked the Frittata in 350 oven for like 25 minutes. Also, I had the deli thickly slice (1/4") the Fontina cheese for me so it was easier to dice.

This was a hit at a small dinner party. I didn't have the broilerproof non- stick skillet, so I started cooking it in a non-stick wok, then transfered a glass baking dish and broiled for 10 min (I like extra crispy cheese). I'm definitely making this recipe again!

I made this for a family gathering and it was a huge hit. Was looking for a recipe to use fresh leeks and parsley from my garden, and this was perfect.

I made this for breakfast at the lake and it was delicious and a little more upscale than my usual asparagus omelette (leeks instead of onion), Fontina cheese instead of cheddar, etc. I liked the burst of cheese from the diced rather than shredded Fontina.

I made the frittata this morning for Admin's Day breakfast at my office, and everyone is raving! Several are inspired to make it this weekend for brunch.

I thought this was excellent. I made it more weight- watchers friendly (yes, I'll be on program for the rest of my life) by cutting the butter to 1 Tbsp. and using egg substitute rather than the eggs.

A quick and easy weeknight meal. I changed the recipe by reducing the amount of cheese and using 3 egg whites and 1 egg (added some Herbes de Provence to the eggs). I also added finely chopped garlic to the pan when the mushrooms went in. This recipe will work great with any kind of vegetable you want to add. ENJOY!

This was fabulous, so easy to make. I served it at brunch last weekend and my guests went ga-ga over it, stealing bites from each other's plates, etc. The only problem was that I did not find that the recommended cooking time allowed for the fritatta to get totally firm, but that may have had something to do with the fact that I used a cast iron skillet instead of a nonstick.

Delicious and easy. I made this dish for a large brunch today, and since I had to triple the recipe and don't have three appropriate broiler-proof skillets, I baked the whole thing instead of moving from the skillet to the oven. It worked beautifully. I sauteed the veggies as described, then spread them in a greased 9x13 pan (2 pans actually, as I had tripled recipe). I then whisked the eggs, cheese etc as described and poured the egg mixture over the veggies. Bake at 350 for about 15-20 minutes until almost set, sprinkle on the remaining cheese and then broil for about 1-2 minutes. It didn't puff up as much as it might have, but it was a big hit. I served it cut in squares.

A very good dish. Very filling and tasty thanks to a lot of flavor from the fontina cheese. Next time I plan to use only 1T butter as 2T was too much. When the eggs started to set there was a quite a bit of butter that rose to the top which I sopped up with a paper towel. The recipe times for sauteing and broiling were perfect. Would definitely make it again!

We had some "20- somethings" staying with us over semester break. One of them saw the recipe and picture and wanted to try it, so we did. The recipe as published was very good. I grated the fontina rather than dicing it. It took nearly 5 minutes for the frittata to brown under the broiler on high with the rack 7" from the broiler element. I made it a second time intending to add some flavor. I added a minced garlic clove along with the mushrooms and put ½ teaspoon of dried tarragon in with the egg mixture. Finally, I spread a few drops of black truffle oil over the finished frittata and sprinkled a bit of paprika on it to garnish.
