This was an easy and very tasty recipe--for those who say it's too dry, don't overcook the chicken! Duh! My chicken came out tender and flavorful--the butter, lemon juice, and parsley were great complementary flavors and the mustard seeds provided a nice pop for texture. Try cooking your couscous in chicken broth for more flavor. My harshest critics, my sisters- and mother-in-law, all loved it.

This is a very good dish-- the key is to liberally salt and pepper the chicken before applying the mustard seeds and parsley. I often see people review recipes on this site as bland, when they are actually quite good if seasoned properly.

Forget the bad reviews on this. I basted the chicken with some honey dijon mustard on both sides and the dish turned out wonderful! Plenty of taste and very good.

For the past 30 years I've been making dishes from Gourmet and loving them all. I say this, because this recipe for chicken with mustard-seed crust and couscous was a real disappointment. We found the chicken too dry and flavorless, and the couscous uninteresting. The accompanying vegetable salad was o.k., but not really worthy of making again. My advice to future readers: with all the easy and tasty recipes out there for boneless chicken breasts, don't waste your time on this one. It just doesn't measure up.

Truly, surprisingly good. I came on this via the vegetable accompaniment, and the whole meal (chicken, couscous, and veggies) works amazingly well together. Absolutely delicious.

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe. The dish turned out to be rather bland, even with the mustard crust, which I though would add a lot more flavor than it did.

Smells good, tastes good, good texture, really fast and really easy (although I needed longer than 10 minutes as well). Super pick for a hurried weeknight.

This dish garnered rave reviews from friends. I made a rub out of cumin, turmeric, and cayenne with pressed garlic and enough olive oil to make a paste - rubbed on the chicken and then coated in the mustard seeds and substituted cilantro for parsley (thanks to the previous suggestion). I also made it with skinless chicken thighs which I seared then baked.

This is a really simple tasty dish. I made it exactly as prescribed, but used a heavy aluminum skillet. Accompanied it with Israeli couscous (coarser) and frozen peas. The peas and couscous married nicely.

This dish was easy, easy, easy. I took another reviewer's advice and added cumin, tumeric and cayenne, changed the parsely to cilantro. I really enjoyed the extra 'zing' those ingredients lent the dish. I can see how others may find it bland without the extra punch. I think it's perfect for a weeknight and I'll definitely add it to our revolving Epicurious line up.

This was fast, easy and delicious. I substituted cilantro for parsley and added cumin, cayenne and tumeric to give the dish color and make the recipe a little more Indian.

A very tasty dish with interesting textures. I'd definitely make it again.

This was very good and quite flavorful, although I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for. No matter, though...I'll just account for that the next time I make it. Yum!!

Mustard seeds and couscous are a really fun texture combo. I made the couscous with broth instead of water to make it tastier.

I made this delicious recipe lickety-split! My friends absolutely LOVED it -- served the side dish as recommended & it complemented the chicken fabulously. Don't understand Ricki's comment about it being bland, it's definitely NOT... but I did use more mustard seed than the recipe called for. I'm not a "four forks" kind of guy, but this is so quick, easy AND delicious--It's a keeper!

Very bland. It needed a little something extra for 'zing'.

I really liked the crunchy coating created from the mustard seeds. I didn't habe parsley on hand so I used dried dill weed and it was very good as well.

My husband and I didn't care for dish. It may just be a personal opinion, but the taste was bland. Definetly, you will need to double the lemon juice and water for deglazing! This will not be saved in my recipe file!

Quick and easy to make. It might be better if you flatten the chicken before seasoning, etc.

Wow! Quick, easy, and incredibly delicious. Definitely on our list of things to prepare after a full day of work - as it doesn't take long to make and it's really yummy.

Delicious and ridiculously simple to make. Wasn't sure what the whole mustard seeds would be like, but they added a delicate, interesting flavor and a nice crunchy texture. The T of water and T of lemon juice didn't create much deglazing liquid to pour over the chicken, though.
