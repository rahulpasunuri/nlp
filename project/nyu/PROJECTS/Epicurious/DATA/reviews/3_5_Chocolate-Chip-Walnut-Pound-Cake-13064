Great bundt cake! I made it in a 1/2 size bundt pan, and it took ~50-55 minutes to be done (based on a clean skewer). The texture was very good, not too dry. The chocolate and walnuts remained suspended in the thick batter. However, there were A LOT of these 2 ingredients, and I would cut back a little next time. Also would mix them in to the batter more because they don't move much during baking. Would definitely make again.

It's a delicious cake that will feed many. Very easy to make, using ingredients you're sure to already have on hand.

First, I must comment on pan size. This recipe calls for a 3 qt bundt pan which is a standard 12 cp pan. This is a BIG cake and filled my 15 cp bundt pan. Anyone using a 3 qt pan would have this overflowing in the oven. I am assuming that others may have made it in an angel food cake pan. That being said, it was a good cake. I dusted the chocolate chips with some of the flour(adding am extra cp of chips) and mixed them along with the nuts into the batter. Baked for the full time, covering with foil after 1 hr. Dusted with powdered sugar for a tall, impressive cake. It is a dense, heavy cake, but moist with a nice bit of a crust. Think it is the kind of cake that I could keep nibbling away at. Will definitely make again.

after 2 relatively unsuccessful attempts at making a pound cacke, this is the winner. I'm baffled. The ingredients are pretty much the same as the other two but the result was amazing. My conclusion is the sour cream (in my case, crème fraïche) made a world of difference. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested Aluminum FOil to cover bread while baking. The other 2 pound cakes had been annoying ly crusty. I used to think putting metal over it would act like a mirror in the oven, burn the cake, but no.. the top stayed a charming yellow color, I am so pleased with the result. I must add I halved the recipe, because I did not want another large disappointment just in case. I followed other reviewers comments and mixed mini choco cihps in, removed walnuts & glad I did. I probably put less sugar in. (stuff has to be eyed around here) Finally, a pound cake i can keep

Delicious, and sure fed a crowd. Used mini chips stirred in and skipped nuts.

Holy cow! This pound cake is amazing. I used mini chocolate chips and per other reviewers, stirred them into the batter. I skipped the nuts. This recipe made me a legend at the office!

I always play but this was a good base. Based on other concerns about dryness and flavor I added an extra 1/4 C. Sour Cream, more vanilla and a good splash of dark rum. I used Callebut chocoloate chips and coated them in part of the flour to prevent sinking. Lastly, by necessity I switched to cake flour which made it light and lovely. (When you do this you need to add 2T extra per cup.) Lots of tweaks but it came our great!

I followed other's advice and added the chips and walnuts to the batter before baking. This was a yummy cake, very dense and moist. I put a chocolate glaze on to make it a little more special for my husband's birthday. Loved by all.

I made this cake twice - the first time the top came off and looked like hell but I served it anyway because it was soo delicious. So good, in fact, that I made it again with the same results - fab taste, dreadful appearance. On this occasion presentation was more important so I was unable to serve it. I snacked on it myself until I felt totally ill and got so aggravated that I threw the remains out with the darn bundt pan. The point of the story being that I love this site and thanks to the reviews and comments of others I can give this another try!! By the way, my first tries were back in '95 before we all had the advantage of this website.

Easy to make, yet absolutely delicious for this chocoholic. The previous suggestion of using mini-chocolate chips and adding them directly to the batter before putting it in the pan is spot on. You do have to be careful about the top of the cake getting too well-done - have a piece of foil ready to cover it to prevent this.

Delicious! I too used the mini chocolate chips and incorporated the chips and walnuts in the batter. The cake is delicious, moist and a real treat.

I have made this cake many times and have these suggestions. First, use mini chocolate chips rather than regular chips. Second, once the batter is all made, mix the chips and nuts into the batter so they are distributed throughout. This is easier to do, you get chocolate and nuts in each bite, and the mini chips stay suspended in the batter better than the large ones. I also always glaze the cake with a chocolate glaze.

I made this cake years ago but lost the magazine, I'm so excited I found it. Hint: Don't over cook or it will dry out. If your oven runs hot cut back on the cooking time.

This is a great pound cake that's easy to make. Every time I serve it to guests, I get at least one request for the recipe. For those who complain about the topping falling off: I make this in an angel food cake pan (where the base lifts out from the side of the pan) and can easily lift the cake off the base without having to invert the cake.

I also think it is too dry. Maybe 8-10 min. less baking might help. I wouldn't put a layer of choc chips and walnuts on the top and would add more in the middle layer. I also would add more vanilla in the batter to add some flavor.

Can someone help me out please? I followed the recipe exactly, but the second layer of chocolate chips and walunts fell off the cake after I inverted it. It seems like there should be another layer of batter covering the chips so they will remain within the cake. Next time I will mix the walnuts and chocolate into the batter instead of layering them. Overall a good cake though.

Here is a secret I learned from my grandmother who made fabulous cakes. Sift the flour onto waxed paper. Gently spoon the flour into a one cup measurer, leveling off with a knife each time. Don't use any flour left over after the 3 cups are measured. Put small amount of flour in a tea strainer and sift it into the running mixer by gently tapping on strainer with a knife. Always add flour to the mixture alternately with the wet ingredients. Scrape down sides of mixer peridically to ensure all ingred. are incorporated. Great cake guaranteed!

I've been making this recipe since I first saw it in October, 1995. My family and friends love it! It has great texture and flavor. Dusting it with powdered sugar is a must!

I whipped the butter and sugar and eggs for a long, long time to make the cake lighter and fluffier. I added cinnamon and extra vanilla to the cake batter. And then I added a thin sprinkling of cinnamon onto the walnuts and chocolate chips baked in the middle of the cake. I also toasted the walnuts that were baked into the cake, and left the walnuts on top untoasted. Rich and light and beautiful. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top to give the cake an elegant look.

This is a great cake and was not at all dry. I have had several requests for the recipe

This was easy to make, but I was disappointed in the flavor and texture of the cake. A bit too dry and plain-tasting.
