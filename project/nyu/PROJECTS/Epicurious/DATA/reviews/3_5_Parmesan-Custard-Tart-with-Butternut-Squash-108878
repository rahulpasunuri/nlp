This recipe was just OK. I didn't like the dough much and I found it to be very time consuming. The end result was a little bland. I would try to add some more flavor some were for sure. I will say that it was a great make ahead dish for a cocktail party I was having, and was easy to serve. I would try this again but maybe add more sage into the filling and some nutmeg.

This was very nice! I made it as little tartlets and agree that you don't need to strain the cheese. I also roasted the squash. A lovely appetizer! Held up ok overnight in the fridge, but it would be best on the same day as the custard shrinks up.

This is a favorite with children. Take out the squash and don't strain the parmesan. I love to serve it at parties as an update to quiche.

The custard is delicious -- I will definitely be making this again. The sauteed butternut squash was delicious and added great flavor to the dish. I served this more as a dinner quiche, not for a party, and while the kids were hesitant to try it at first they were pleasantly surprised to find that they liked it.

I have made this a number of times to take to parties and it has always been very well received and complemented upon. Bake just as the recipe is written and you will taste the subtilities in the seasoning in both the crust and squash, the richness of the cheese and cream, and the marriage of taste sensations. It is a bit of work but it can be made the day before and refrigerated after cooling. A minute or so in the microwave will bring it back to serving temperature.

I substituted the black pepper parmesan pastry from the heirloom tomato tart (2001), roasted the squash in the oven as other readers suggested, and baked it in a long rectangular tart pan. This is a make-ahead for Thanksgiving dinner with friends! Really, really good.

I took the advice: roasted squash in oven with Herbs d'Provence - ooh delicious!!! Cut the corner with pillsbury dough. Wonderful! Light, smooth, with that extra kick of flavor thanks to the herbs, nutmeg, and don't forget the salt! Looks great and appeasing - since most adults don't like to eat veggies. Served this at a cocktail party. Rave reviews!

Recommendation for the squash: toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried, rubbed sage. Roast in 375 degree oven for 15-20 mins. This enhances the flavor of the squash considerably.

I feel the need to help the ratings for this recipe. I have made it twice for special occasion dinner parties and guests always LOVE it. It is the first thing to disappear. It is a fair bit of work - but really decadent. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe for a New Years Eve party this year. I thought the tarts turned out great. To cut down some time, I used a store bought pastry dough (Pillsbury is the most common, and a pretty solid dough). I also minced an extra tablespoon of Sage and sautéed the squash with it. (I would have done this even if I had added Sage to the pastry dough.) It is important to add extra salt into the custard mixture as well as nutmeg. The squash has a mild flavor so the custard should have a fairly strong flavor to compensate for the milder flavor of the squash. Overall very enjoyable.

This was much too time consuming for the end result. It recieved good reviews from my guests, but I thought it sounded alot better on paper than it turned out in actuality. If you've got the time it's good, but if you're making many items, skip this one!

I found this a little bit bland. Not necessarily the best for a party, as I think it's better when still hot.
