Super fast and easy dinner. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and added extra spices. I also used real salsa instead of crushed tomatoes and that made it very flavorful and delicious.

Have been looking at this recipe for a week and wanting to try it. Today was the day, and it's as good as it sounds!!! Squeezed juice from 1/2 orange for the 1/4 cup of juice that the recipe called for--next time I will use the entire orange. I, too, used fire-roasted tomatoes. I like things spicy, and this is mild to my taste. I boosted it a little with 1/2 tsp. of habanero hot sauce. Topped it with grated extra sharp Cheddar cheese and sliced green onions. Delicious!

It's lent so I was looking for a meatless meal to replace having tuna every friday for lunhc. Once the chopping is done, this is soooo easy to make and the flavors are great. I used more green and red pepper that asked for, didn't have a jalepeno so I used pickeled ones.

This recipe has been in regular rotation at my house for several years now. It's healthy, relatively quick and easy to make, and full of flavor. It's one of the only recipes that I find I don't have to tweak (though I do often leave out the jalapeño so it's not too spicy for my kids).

Easy, healthy, quick and tasty, what's not to like. Used fire roasted tomatoes as recommended by others, and cayenne pepper instead of tabasco...just kept adding til I liked the spiciness. Juice from 1 orange and peppers from the garden. Will make a again.

Yum! I doubled the jalapenos and used fire roasted tomatoes. I topped it with some avocado and plain yogurt. I should have kept the pepper seeds or added another jalapeno, though...I like it fiery. Next time :)

Liked this a lot. Made it a second time as a stuffing for green peppers, added some more hot peppers and once the peppers were filled we baked them in a 300 degree oven for one hour in a tented glass baking dish.

Simple and delicious! I put it over long-grain brown rice.

Salsa is my stand in for the peppers and tomatoes today. With brown rice, I'll try not to eat the whole recipe in one sitting!

Easy to prepare, and I usually have most of the ingredients already in the kitchen. The family loved it and the leftovers were great. It also is a somewhat forgiving recipe if I need to adjust things a bit.

This dish is a winner! We could not get enough of it. I followed the recipe rather closely, but only added half of the jalapeno and half the amount of black beans. We thought it was very favorful, healthy and nourishing.I will definetly make this again.

For simply ease of prepration and taste of finished production, this gets to be 4 forks. It is the perfect side dish. I did add fire roasted tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes and followed one person's suggestion of sprinkling the top with some grated Monterey Jack.

This was easy to make. We both loved it. Thank you

This was so good and easy. I used a can of Caribbean- style black beans -- since I didn't have a jalapeno -- and it was fabulous. My 4yo son inhaled it.

This dish was easy -- although not as quick as I was hoping for -- and benefited from the addition of corn.

Pretty good. I would put in some extra garlic next time and maybe some more OJ b/c I didn't really get that flavor. I decreased the tomato and then I added cilantro to this dish--a must for this fare!!

Quick, easy and tasty. Next time, I'll add more garlic. Used fire roasted tomatoes instead of crushed, which deepened the tomato flavor and made the dish less soupy overall.

I've been making this since college and love it. I always add more garlic and hot sauce, and husband likes it when I throw in chorizo.

I came across this recipe while looking for a vegetarian bean mixture to fill burritos. I mixes the rice in with the beans, and it was fantastic! Good as a side dish or in a flour tortilla with sour cream and guacamole.

We liked this a lot but I agree that there was too much tomato. Next time I'll try cutting back on the puree. Plenty spicy for us (and we like it hot!) - I used home grown jalapenos. Interesting recipe but I'm still looking for something closer to my friends' black beans (they won't give out the recipe!).

I've been making this one for years and it hits the spot every time. Much more interesting than the average black beans & rice recipe.

We love this recipe at our house. I always add chipotle pepper and extra hot sauce.

Pretty good. It lacked zip, but that was probably because I forgot the salt and pepper. (Whoops!)

I thought there was too much tomato in this recipie. The beans got lost in the mix. The flavor was nice with the orange juice. I might try again with a third can of beans (or maybe only 1/2 the tomato puree.

What a delectable recipe! I did not seed the jalapeno, added one canned chipotle chili for extra flavor, and used freshly squeezed orange juice-- made an already great dish even better. I too served the beans with simple white rice, homemade guacamole, salsa, and chicken fajitas. Yum!

My husband and I love this recipe. I always add fresh cilantro, and fresh corn when available. We make this one often!

This was tasty, but I guess I prefer my beans made without the addition of tomato. There's a great recipe for black beans in the February 1999 issue of Gourmet in which the beans really shine through. I couldn't detect the orange juice here, but you can with that one. I've never had beans prepared with tomato, as this one above is, so my objection my not be to this recipe per se. I served the beans with white rice, chicken fajitas, and homemade guacamole and salsa.

We loved this recipe!! We even thought that the leftovers tasted great. I made black bean quesadillas out of the leftovers a day after and they were excellent as well! I will definitely make this again.

This tasty dish is a variation of one that I've made for years. The differences in my version are that I don't use the OJ (it's a nice, but not really essential addition) and I serve it over yellow rice, which I think is a really excellent improvement. I buy the prepared, Spamish-style yellow rice mixes and it definitely adds depth to this. Try that instead of plain rice. I also add a few shakes of chili powder, just because. And finally, if you want to eat meat, this dish is really outstanding with cut-up chicken in the sauce.

Both my husband and I raved about this dish all the way through the meal. We too were surprised at how delicious it was for such simple fare. I was hesitant about adding the orange juice, but it truly blended in perfectly with the other flavors. Excellent! This recipe is a keeper!

This was a surprisingly delicious dish for such a simple one. The balance of orange, tomato, and cumin seems just right, although next time I think I'll add more jalapeno. But there definitely will be a next time; this is going to be one of my staples.

Very Good!! I added some spicy cajun sausage that gave it the perfect kick. Great over rice.

I almost gave tbis four forks because I think it tastes just as good cold as it does hot! I really like this dish, it was easy enough to make, and man, top it with some grated Monterey Jack and you are in business! I used bottled roasted red peppers, which perhaps gave it more of a kick. Definitely will make it again, I think it would be great for a picnic.

I used the juice from one orange and some cayenne pepper instead of the hat sauce and it came out very good. Mine was pretty mild, but I'm a "sissy gringo", so if you like it hot you might want to add more spice. Overall a nice meatless dish.

I changed the recipe by using apple cider vinegar, fresh orange juice, and extra garlic. The bell peppers were roasted over an open flame then sliced and added later to have a better crunchy flavor, instead of cooking until the sauce is thick I wanted the sauce on the rice bed. I BBQed two half chickens and added them to the meal for an extra flavorable meal.

Even my dog didn't want to try this one, although it does resemble alpo.
