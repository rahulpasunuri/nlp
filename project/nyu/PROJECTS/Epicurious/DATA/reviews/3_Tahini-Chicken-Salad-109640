Made it for the 2nd time and added some madras curry and cilantro too. It was perfect!! If you find the recipe bland it means you need to add a little more garlic and salt. That is all!

Added mint and cucumber as suggested - really gave more substance and flavor to the salad. Great with pita bread. Really good weeknight dinner!

if you're looking to save time, buy a roasted chicken from the deli. great flavor-no work. if you're looking for a little kick, add some crushed red pepper to the tahini sauce.

I didn't enjoy this dish. As others said, it was too bland. It really needs a "kick." Vinegar, fresh herbs, cayenne...something.

This is a great recipe, easy as can be and great fresh flavor. To save time, I cut up the chicken and tossed it in a pan with olive oil, salt and pepper. I added some chilli for added spice and tossed in chopped mint leaves as well. And to bulk up the salad, I also added chopped cucumber and tomatoes as well. It was excellent with some toasted pita bread.

I also roasted the garlic (and used 6 cloves). Made for excellent flavor. Tastes great with a good homemade hummus recipe on toasted pita. DEFINITELY not bland.

I roasted the garlic first - yum! This was perfect in pitas for a summer picnic.

Yum, this was great! Cramy, tangy, nutty and crunchy. Other reviewers say it's too bland, but I disagree. If you season the chicken with plenty of salt and pepper (and other spices, if you want) it's perfect. I used some left over chicken that I'd grilled, which worked very well. I had some in a sandwich and it made a spectacular lunch!

Loved it. The flavor was creamy and nutty, the vegetables added superb crunch and color, and it didn't coat the palate the way a standard mayonnaise-based chicken salad does.

I liked this recipe better the second day! And the other reviewers were correct; it was bland. So I added more garlic and lemon juice. However, I also added a little dijon mustard and WOW! I liked it A LOT especially because it is lighter and healthier than using mayonnaise.

WHEN MAKING THIS RECIPE, IF OIL IS DESIRED, I SUGGEST USING PEANUT OIL FOR BETTER FLAVOR.

I just have a question: couldn't you use boiled chicken and save time, energy, gas, and a hot kitchen?

I use tahini thinned down with lemon juice and water all the time,even for a tossed salad. The secret is in the tartness of the lemon juice sometimes I add more or use balsamic vinegar,next is the amount of garlic again use the amount that suits your tastebuds,then for the the finish I add cumin usually not more than 1/4 teaspoon and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Let sit for a couple of hours or ovenight and serve the dressing at room temperature for its best flavor.Yum

I made the recipe as directed and agree with most of the other reviewers-too bland. The basics are good, but next time I will add some herbs and maybe a little olive oil.

Make the recipe as it is and add 3 gloves minced garlic,(you can use roasted garlic as well to mellow the flavor) 1/4 tsp. of Tarragon, 1/2 tsp. of minced Parsley and 1/2 tsp. Ginger (fresh grated is better than dry ground) Adding olive oil to the sauce will be a nice touch. Let the sauce sit in the fridge overnight. Flavors tend to marry into each other a little better that way. Use seasalt as opposed to table salt. Cut back on the pepper. And Enjoy! Very Yummy!

This sounded interesting but the tahini, chicken combo did not work. It was bland and at the same time the chicken was overpowered by the tahini.

I agree that this salad is more refreshing than mayonnaise-based chicken salads. It is pretty rich, however, and would be best served with other salads as in the Gourmet menu. I also agree with previous reviewer that it is too bland. I added some extra virgin olive oil, and that helped a lot!!! Next time I am going to add the olive oil to the dressing rather than coating the chicken breasts before roasting. I think mint or cilantro would be a good idea. Also, what about using a combination of breasts and thighs? Finally, serving this with other salads would provide a contrast of tastes and textures. I think that would make a difference. By the way, I don't think the flavors developed overnight. If anything, the flavor was fresher the first day.

This is a good prototype recipe, but needs alot of work because it is very bland as is. If I were to make it again I would add more lemon juice, more salt and maybe some mint or other herb. It was nice as a lettuce leaf wrap filling.

I'm always looking for a good chicken salad recipe so I made this in the afternoon and ate it in the evening. It was good, but I am interested to see if the flavors will develop overnight. I skipped the chicken part of the recipe as I already had shredded chicken I made in the crock pot. I also added celery for more crunch.
