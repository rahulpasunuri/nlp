I added edamame beans, the fresh cilantro, dried coriander and cumin, some chopped shallot and chopped green pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Quite tasty!

I have made this many times and always following the suggestions from 'ragdoll2525' below: use cilantro instead of parsley and let it marinate overnight, then serve with cherry or grape tomatoes. I find this to be quite delightful! It has so much flavour for such a simple dish. It is light, but filling; perfect for lunch!

This recipe can go from good to great with a few simple modifications----reduce the oil, add a good deal of lemon juice, and use chopped fresh cilantro instead of parsley. Let that combination marinate overnight (use a container with a good seal so you can give the contents a hearty shake every time you happen to go into the fridge for something). Before serving add some chopped black olives and some diced tomato or halved grape tomato---makes a beautiful, tasty and healthy side dish, or a vegetarian entree..

Just ok. I was expecting more WOW factor flavor. Rather have used the chick peas in my curry the next day...

While this salad is very good as is, each time I make it I tend to make slight changes depending on my mood and time available. Taking cues from other chickpea salad recipes on this site, I might add a pinch of cumin and/or ground coriander, minced scallion, white wine vinegar, fresh minced hot peppers, red or green, and so forth. Whatever you do, it's a very good side dish. I think the only caveat might be not to add too much dressing and keep it light.

This was delicious. I also added some raisins which I thought made it taste really good. I will definitely be making this agin.
