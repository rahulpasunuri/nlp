Warning: I used a Teflon simmer cover over my burner so that my pan would have an extra heavy bottom. After the second batch my 9year old daughter came in and said something is wrong with my bird. And two minutes later our bird died. I never use Teflon to cook but this was just a simmer pad. Now we can't even eat the popcorn. In regards to the recipe there is not enough syrup for 8 cups of popcorn. All in all this recipe was not for us.

Delicious, we made it twice now, the first time it was perfect, took the advice of others, I sprinkled the nuts in while my husband poured in the cooked maple syrup. We did not have quite enough maple sauce the second time, so I will make sure to not add too much popcorn, maybe reserve a little and add at the very end if needed. You have to work very fast in combining the ingredients!

I just made this - took off the heat at 270 and it turned out great. I used Cashews instead of Pecans as that is what I had in the pantry. The bowl and pan were even easy to clean. Packaged into cute clear gift bags - lovely homemade gift for the holidays.

i altered it by adding a pinch of garam masala and another of ground chipotle. loved the flavor with these additions! :0) the butter separated too much and i was left with a weird and unwelcome pool of oil in the mixing bowl after adding the popcorn then transferring it to the tray. **erk!** i agree with a prior poster that the nuts i added did not adhere at all ( i roasted peanuts). -kerrita

Loved this! I was nervous that this would make a huge mess and it didn't. I had no trouble with getting the syrup to the right temperature or cleaning either the pot or the mixing bowl. Next time, I will probably divide the popcorn into two large bowls and mix up two batches, since my largest bowl had me knocking popcorn out of the bowl as I stirred. Next time, I kind of want to experiment with spices or herbs. I can imagine a kick of cayenne or alternatively, rosemary and dried cranberries. This is great as is, but I think will have endless variations.

I just made this and it is very delicious! It smelled great while it was cooking and the popcorn/maple flavor is a great combination. I'm making this for an informal gathering and I know it will be a hit. I didn't have pecans so I threw in a bag of mixed nuts, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and watched the boiling syrup like a hawk. For me it took just under15 minutes for it to get to the right temp.

I have not yet made this recipe but I need to comment about the time and temperature for cooking the syrup. Maple syrup will have more or less water in it, depending on the batch. The time it takes for they syrup to reach 300 will naturally vary a lot. And "medium heat" is not going to be the same on every stove. So having a heavy bottom pot and watching this syrup temperature very carefully are extremely important. The time it takes to reach 300 will be inconsistent.

I love this stuff. I make it at Christmas and give it out with my cookies. For cooks who do not do a lot of candy making, and that's me ... it's very important to watch that syrup like a hawk. I've just barely burned one batch and it tasted it. Be very careful to watch that thermometer. I used a Calphalon sauce pan, it is NOT non-stick. Some of the carmel hardens in the pan but there was plenty to cover the popcorn.

I had no trouble with the syrup at all. It took right around 20 min.to get to 300* Mixed together good making sure you get all the pecans incorporated. YUMMMEEE will make again as I think this could become addicting.

I can't give this recipe higher than one fork because the cooking temp and duration are WRONG. The temperature is NOT going to reach 300 degrees at medium heat in 15-20 mins. When cooking with carmel/syrup recipes the instructions really need to be correct. Try again!

This is probably not the fault of the recipe, but I had to throw my whole batch out because I made the maple caramel in a regular old pot without non-stick coating, and it burned. I intiially had it in a small non-stick pot, but it threatened to boil over, so I transferred it to the bigger pot, which doesn't have non-stick coating. Oh well - I'd just say to to try to keep it in a non-stick pot!

Very addictive. I will make this again.

This recipe is fantastic. I added the nuts after the syrup and they adhered perfectly. The only surprise for me was how long it took the syrup to get to the right temperature, probably because I don't cook with sugar or candy very often. Once it got to the right temp, it was perfect. It saved well in an airtight plastic container.

This is delicious! I am making as snacks for the kids at Halloween. My son said they taste like Cracker Jacks.. (only better). One problem: The pecans fell to the bottom of the bowl and didn't adhere when I mixed the syrup with the popcorn. I ran out of syrup, so added butter and brown sugar with the remaining pecans in a saucepan to caramelize, then sprinkled on top of the popcorn.
