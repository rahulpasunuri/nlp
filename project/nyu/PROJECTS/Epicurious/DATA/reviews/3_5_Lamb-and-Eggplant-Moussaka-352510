We received an abundance of eggplant from our CSA box so I naturally thought of moussaka. We used turkey and followed the recipe as written. As long as you multitask this recipe shouldn't take too long. Make the meat sauce while waiting for the eggplant to drain and potatoes to boil. Make the cheese sauce while also frying the eggplant. This turned out delicious and does re-heat very well for taking lunch to work.

I really like this recipe though I will caution: boil the potatoes thoroughly before slicing and baking them. I boiled them for 10 minutes and they were still too crisp; next time I'll try 15. Also, if you're looking for a lower calorie alternative to the white sauce: a layer of low-fat ricotta, thinned with a little milk, actually bakes up wonderfully.

Made this today following the recipe exactly. It took almost 2 hours to make. I would make it again given how good it was and would recommend this: 1 - get all steps prepared and ready, including the cheese sauce, to cook at the same time. Each piece of this meal takes about 1/2 hour to cook - if you have everything ready to go at the same time, your time in the kitchen would be greatly reduced. My family are not egg plant fans - I didn't tell and they didn't notice - just said it was all good. Served with a Greek salad on the side we had a fabulous meal.

This was a delicious dish. I did make a few changes. I didn't have enough parmesan for the cheese sauce so I also used asiago and it was wonderful. Instead of whole milk, i used fat free milk and fat free half & half for the cheese sauce, which kept the calorie count down. Because we don't eat meat, I substituted Yves Veggie Cuisine Meatless Ground. You would never know it isn't ground meat and it was delicious. My only complaint was it was very time consuming to make with lots of steps, but it was well worth the effort.

I've been to Greece numerous times and moussaka is to Greeks what meatloaf is to Americans...a classic home-cooked go-to dish. This recipe is fairly close to a traditional Greek preparation except for the breadcrumbs which I omitted. I, also, omitted the cloves and cinnamon which is a personal dislike in savoury dishes. Like several other cooks, I baked the eggplant (aubergine) and left the skin on. Do parboil the potatoes (about 10-15 minutes). In addition, I cooked the lamb with freshly chopped oregano which is the ubiquitous herb in Greece.

Great flavor My husband & I both like to cook so we put it together pretty quickly. We did not saute the eggplant. We sprinkled it w/ olive oil and baked it in the oven while we made the meat sauce and cream sauce.

Ok tasting but SO much work. Would not spend the three hours this took again.

Completely agree with other reviewers - a lot of work and only an okay result. Wish I had read the reviews BEFORE making this - the potatoes were completely undercooked.

I've made this recipe numerous times with slight variations and it is a definite crowd pleaser. It presents well and tastes delicious. I serve a great salad with feta and olives as a side dish or entree. It also freezes well....Love it!

Made this recipe with vegetarian ground beef crumbles. It came out really good. I liked the potatoes but I undercooked them - next time I'll let them boil a few more minutes than the recipe recommends.

Despite the other reviews saying not to use potatoes, I decided to anyway because my husband loves potatoes. The flavours were good, but the potatoes really just didn't fit. I think I will keep looking for a moussaka recipe

This was amazing. We are on a no/low carb diet so we skipped the potatoes and didn't miss them at all. We did use the breadcrumbs but I didn't notice them and you could definitely skip them. This is a great one dish meal, it's not as much work as it seems, and it reheats extremely well so it's great if you want something that will feed you for a few days. We will definitely be making this again. Only comment is I would probably use more lamb than is called for as the meat to other stuff ratio was not quite what we wanted. I'd probably go with 2 lb.

I have never heard of Moussaka having potatoes in it, and the idea does not appeal to me. Also agree with other reviewer who said recipe was "sloppy."

this was hilariously delicious. made two versions- one with spinach instead of meat, and one with pork. used soured buttermilk instead of milk for the bechamel, because that's all we had. it was yogurty and amazing. the sour sauce balanced out the heavy sauce perfectly. the room was silent for fifteen minutes as everyone crammed as much as they could into their mouths as quickly as they could.

I have made Moussaka many times before but didn't have my favorite recipe with me (It is from a book I bought in the 60's, "How Not to Miss the Cocktail Hour", lol!). I used Top Round Lamb steak and chopped it into small bits, which was very good, but I think it would have been just as good, possibly better, had I not cut it so small and just braised it longer. I actually put more cinnamon in, because my very favorite part of Moussaka is the lovely contrast of the sweet scent of the cinnamon with the savory taste of the other ingredients, If I make it again I will add even more because it wasn't enough (I put in the cinnamon stick and 1/4 teaspoon). I put the breadcrumbs ON the eggplant before sauteing them, (that I remembered from my old recipe). I had read the previous reviews before beginning and also didn't see the point of the potatoes, so I left them out. I agree with the comment that the recipe for the cheese sauce was sloppily written. I could likely make it in my sleep so I didn't worry about it, but I can see someone who is just learning having a hard time... 30 minutes indeed!! I had to raise the temperature of the oven for the last 10 minutes because the top hadn't gotten golden yet and I like it that way. All in all, I think I am going to try to find a copy of that old cookbook the recipe I loved was in. If I am going to make something this complicated and time consuming, I want it to be more memorable. There were lots of other recipes in that cookbook that made spending time with my guests more enjoyable as well.

I found this recipe very authentic based on my numerous trips to Greece except for the breadcrumbs which I omitted. I, also, did not include the cloves nor the cinnamon as I thought these spices would make the dish too aromatic and would overpower the other flavors. My one suggestion would be to cook the potatoes longer. I relied on the cooking time in the oven to thoroughly cook the potatoes but this was not the case.

First of all, potato does not belong in moussaka; its flavor and texture is alien in this dish, as will become immediately apparent to those bold enough to undertake this dish. The eggplant was mushy -- note that the recipe fails to state how thickly it should be sliced. The meat and tomato sauce was good (I used drained canned tomatoes.) But the cheese sauce was awful. The recipe calls for the butter, flour milk roux to be cooked for 30 minutes until thick. Well it is thick immediately one adds and whisks the milk. After 30 minutes of cooking, it was chalky and tasted slightly burned. Note also that the recipe fails to advise on what size baking dish to use. This is a sloppy recipe, and the dish is unpleasant. No forks from me.

I really liked this dish.Used ground lamb for authenticity and upped the spices. Added oregano and marjoram as suggested by another reviewer. I cooked the potatoes for longer than suggested based on reviews.

I was hesitant after reading unfavorable reviews but I did like this dish. I used ground pork because that's what I had on hand. Make sure to use good quality, ripe tomatoes...I also like to caramelise my onions when making tomato sauce as it adds flavour. Overall this was delicious - I omitted the eggs in the cheese sauce and used fresh parmesan cheese. Also added some grated cheese and bread crumbs on top before cooking. I would definitely make this again!

I made this recipe exactly as written except for one thing. The store didn't have ground lamb, so I bought lamb chops and ground them myself. I think this made the results much less greasy, as I was able to trim most of the fat. In any case, the results were fantastic. Be careful on the nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. They could easily take over the dish, even in the small amounts called for. Definitely a keeper.

This was tasty but incredibly greasy. And I cooked it at the correct time and the potatoes were still crunchy, a big pet peeve of mine. The other reviewers' suggestions of adding of oregano and marjoram was a good tip. Next time, I'm going to make this casserole style, I'll cut the potatoes and eggplant into small cubes and just mix it in with the meat sauce, and then add my cheese sauce. Bottomline is this was a lot of work for an underwhelming result. Needs work.

Just returned from Greece and wanted to make moussaka! It turned out fantastic! I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes and kept wrapped up until needed. I did make the cheese sauce first as recommended. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This waa the best moussaka I've ever made (so I was told by my picky husband)! I used beef mince and just used bechamel sauce instead of the cheese sauce, with a sprinkling of parmaesean on top of the moussaka once it was assembled. It turned out great!!

Great recipe pretty close to what I've had at an authentic greek restaurant, I think the only thing that may need a little tweaking was the cheese sauce, but that was my fault as I had to improvise by using parmigiano reggiano. I couldn't find haloumi, but I'll try harder to find it next time I make this.

My husband loves lamb and he loves eggplant, so I thought this would be perfect. After all that work, he said "I will eat this, but don't make it again." I agree with him. It was not that good.

If you've got the time, this recipe is worth the effort. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to add 1/2 tsp. of oregano and marjoram to the meat and tomato mixture as it simmered. I also cut the water to 1/4 cup. The result was a nicely flavored meat sauce with just the right amount of liquid.

This was very good as written, but a bit too subtle for me. I increased the spices and the tomatoes and omitted the water. Also added a pinch of dried oregano and a bit more red wine. But I agree with the previous poster that you shouldn't over-do it or mess with the recipe too much. The potatoes need to be sliced pretty thin as they will not cook through (the 5 minute boiling doesn't fully cook the potatoes). I sliced the eggplant lengthwise into 1/3-inch slices and used the Cook's Illustrated method for preparing the eggplant for frying that removes the excess moisture from the eggplant slices using the microwave. Fast and foolproof. For the cheese sauce, I used a combination of mizithra and pecorino as that's what I had on hand, about 2 oz of each (probably more than the recipe calls for). The topping was excellent.

Tasty, rich, and flavorful. My first time through I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. Romano might be a better sub for kefalotyri than Parm, but any sharp dry cheese would work pretty well. Resist the urge to increase the amount of cheese sauce (or cheese in the sauce) the first time you make it. Though I love rich/creamy foods, I think the flavor balance was just about perfect as written. If anything, I might have preferred a bit more eggplant and a bit more tomato flavor. I used a mixture of three small white and four Chinese eggplants. I didnt bother to peal the Chinese because they are thin-skinned and I liked the flavor/ texture contribution, but the skins on some eggplants (especially white) can be too tough to leave in. The spices are rather subtle as written compared to some restaurant versions Ive had, but be careful increasing them, especially the clove. Adding 1-2 teaspoons of dried herbs to the meat as it browns might work (marjoram, oregano, and parsley would be good candidates). Plan on 2-1/2 hours to make this in one go. To save time, you could add the meat shortly after the onion, use canned tomatoes, leave out the potatoes (more eggplant?), and skip the eggplant salting/frying (maybe drizzle some of the olive oil on the top layer of eggplant to keep the richness). Salting isnt as important if you use a less-bitter variety of eggplant (most light-purple varieties like Chinese and Rosa Bianca), but theres still the moisture issue, so itd be extra important to make sure the meat sauce isnt too wet. Youd also need to cook a bit longer in the oven, maybe 40-45 minutes covered (to prevent the top from turning black) and 15-20 minutes uncovered. The result would suffer some in terms of texture but itd still be quite tasty. Great with moderate or low-tannin red wine (Merlot, Pinot Noir), though Id avoid really fruit-forward wines.

I wanted to make something different and special for my husband's birthday. He loves moussaka, so I decided to give it a try. The flavor in this recipe was amazing. The spices were subtle but distinct -- just right. He's not a huge lamb fan, so I used ground beef, but lamb or half beef/half lamb would be great, too. I couldn't find the right cheese for the cheese sauce, and the suggestion to use parmesan didn't seem quite right. So, I used mostly feta but with some parm thrown in for good measure. I added the cheese to taste, and it turned out to be quite a bit more than the amount specified in the recipe. I probably ended up with 1/2 - 3/4 cup feta and 1/3 cup parm. The recipe was also lacking in the following respects - it didn't specify the size to cut the eggplant slices (I did prepare the eggplant for cooking as suggested, which was probably a good idea) so I cut it fairly thin. I think a bit thicker slice, perhaps 1/4 inch, would be a bit better. The recipe also neglected to state remove the bay leaf (I had small leaves, so used two), cloves and cinnamon. Anyone who has cooked with these whole spices would know to take them out before adding the meat sauce to the dish in final preparation, but just a word to the newbies. Recipe said to slice the potatoes 1/8 inch and my husband said he might have liked those just a tiny shade thinner. The prep time was long given the steps and pre-cook times involved (it took me 2-2 1/2 hrs I think), but the recipe is very very easy. In sum, absolutely delicious. And the leftovers were just as good if not better! Highly recommend for the moussaka fans out there!
