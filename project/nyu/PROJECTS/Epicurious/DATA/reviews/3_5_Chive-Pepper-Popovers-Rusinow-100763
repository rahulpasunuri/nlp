3 1/2 forks. The aroma of these baking nearly drove us mad, and the flavor lived up to the anticipation. Not much substance; three of us devoured the batch and would happily have eaten more. I wonder if a little feta cheese crumbled into the batter would be good?

A classic popover with a twist. I made these last night in a blender, let the batter sit about 20 minutes before pouriong it into a 12 (individual) cup muffin pan, each cup sprayed with Pam. Set the oven to 425, baked until they were crowned nicely, crisp and brown, which took less time because they were smaller. When they were done, I poked a hole into the top with a sharp knife of each immediately to let steam escape and avoid collapsing. Easy and impressive for any meal, with or without company.

My hat is off to the creator of this simple and tasty receipe. To be able to use a mixer, a cold oven and have light and crispy popovers is nothing short of a miracle. The chives added a great twist. Intend to make this regularly as it is just so simple. Used PAM to grease the popover cups. Just got 6 really nice sized ones out of the receipe.

This is an easy recipe, I'd never made popovers before and they came out puffy and brown and delicious. They looked impressive too!
