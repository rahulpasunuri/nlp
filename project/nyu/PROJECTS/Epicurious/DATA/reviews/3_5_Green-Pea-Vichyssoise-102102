Very good and very pretty, served as a first course before a cheese souffle for vegetarian guests. They often feel slighted and this helped create an impressive meal. Topped with sour cream and sprouts, although I was looking for pea shoots. Needed a fair shot of salt before serving.

The first time I made this I didn't add the peas. I thought I had them in the freezer and didn't, so the soup was more true to what a vichyssoise is. Well the next day it was a vichyssoise, one night's leek and potato hot soup is tomorrow's vichyssoise! I made it again last night, with the peas, and absolutely loved what they did to the taste and texture, not to mention the color. I added less cream, to make it healthier, and the peas took it's place by making the soup creamy and delicious. Also- an idea to make the soup more of a meal. I baked white fish, last night it was petrale sole, the first time sea bass, and placed it in the bottom of the bowl. I then spooned the (warm) soup around the fish. The flavors of the fish (cooked at 350F for 15 minutes with just some olive oil, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon) mixed with the soup was amazing. My husband loved it so much he actually said that it replaces my tasty roast chicken as his favorite meal.

Although good cold, I preferred this warm. Very good.

There's no garlic in vichyssoise! But I liked the pea idea, so I made Julia's traditional version and added the peas at the end. One thing about the peas - if you don't eat this right away, the pretty green colour fades. Still tastes good though.

Nice twist on traditional vichyssoise.

Heard of it...never had it....so tried it. This was easy and excellent. We served it cold. It was equally delicious warm when it was first prepared. We donated a french dinner for a charity auction - and as one of the courses, it was a hit.
