I'm not giving this a fork rating because we got bad salmon. There is a lot of work to this recipe and I didn't think the outcome was very good. The orzo was okay but lacked flavor and the wine sauce was BORING and thin. Not worth a repeat in our house even with good salmon.

D-lish! although a bit laborious. I took the advice of the other other reviewer and used white wine and chicken broth. I hate taking the skin off salmon, and would guess that this is not really necessary. Will for sure make it again

Trust me, you want to replace red wine with white wine and beef broth with chicken stock. The sauce is ten times better this way. Using red wine and beef broth creates a stewy flavor which in my opinion is just not a complementary flavor to salmon. My suggestion creates a light yellow glaze that, when poured on the salmon, allows the color of the salmon to show through. I also thinkened the sauce with a bit of flour/water. I chose to pour the sauce directly on the salmon in addition to providing it on the table. The rest of the recipe is wounderful--don't change a thing!

Sauce was thin, but great accompaniment to the salmon, which is rather plain without it. Orzo is good...liked the toasting method, but be sure to add a little salt if you use low sodium stock. Served with a mixed green salad with goat cheese, dried cherries, pecans and a balsamic dressing. Got rave reviews.

Delicious combination. However, I really didn't see the need for the sauce. THe orzo is so tasty that it compensates for a bland salmon. I would definetly make it again.

I would make the orzo and red wine sauce again as a main entree, although I would have to do it on the weekend, given the prep and cooking time. The orzo was good, but the sauce was better and together they worked well. My husband grilled the salmon over indirect heat with oak chips. Prepared this way, the salmon stole the show. Since we didn't follow the recipe to a 'T', I shouldn't comment, but I agree with other reviewers that the three components of this recipe are all great individually, but a bit much on the palate combined. Better to do the orzo and sauce and do something else with the salmon.

Here are two hearthy dishes in one. The orzo is good, a nice alternative to the traditionnal risotto. The wine sauce is delicious, I suggest using creme fraiche instead of whipping cream for a smooth texture. THe combination of such an elaborated orzo and sofisticated sauce is a lot of mixed sensations going on on the same plate. Keep it simple.

This dish was amazing! It was my first time cooking salmon and I followed the advice of some other cooks and made the following adjustments: I cut the orzo portion of the recipe in half since I was only making it for two people. Next time I will add more mushrooms - there seem like a lot at first but they cooked down. Also I seared the salmon in the pan but finished it in the oven at 350 for ten minutes. I let the wine sauce reduce a bit longer than called for and left some of the onions in it when I poured it over the fish. This dish will certainly impress - I'll serve it next time I have guests for dinner.

A no go on this one.

This recipe really impressed my sophisticated friends. Nevertheless, I have a few modifications. The red wine sauce should be further reduced to 1/2 cup so as to achieve a more syrupy consistency. As for the delicious orzo pilaf, I doubled up on the mushroom quantity, using a melange of shiitake, portabello and white varieties. Also, the 1 lb. of orzo was enough for an army; 1/2 lb. would be fully sufficient for 8 servings, which of course would necessitate halving the amount of chicken stock.

I'm rating just the orzo- it was good. I used portobello mushrooms instead of white. Served with the very simple Roasted Salmon recipe from this site.

This is the best recipe for orzo I've ever had. The salmon with sauce were a nice compliment. Everyone loved it, even the picky ones.

Great recipe. Made the sauce and the orzo ahead and reheated while cooking the salmon.

Wonderful dish. Different from the standard boring pasta.

We loved the orzo! I did not toast it first. I also bought chopped mushrooms, and did not think that this recipe was all that time-consuming. We actually made the Roasted Salmon recipe, also on this site. The roasted salmon was outstanding! Company-worthy, and my husband couldn't stop ranting and raving how good it was.

The salmon was good but the orzo was outstanding. I might have used somewhat more shallots, but I don't think that made the difference. I did substitute creme fraiche for the heavy cream, which might have contributed to the silky smoothness of the dish.

I bought salmon fillets with the skin on and seared them skin side down in a smoking hot cast iron pan with just enough olive oil to coat the bottom for 3 minutes and then placed the pan in a 450 degree oven for another 4-5 minutes. Not only were they perfectly cooked but the very crispy skin added greatly to the texture and presentation of the dish. As another reviewer remarked, the orzo only takes about 8-9 minutes to become nicely toasted and would have been incinerated after 20 mins. I reduced the red wine sauce more than the recipe called for before mounting it with butter and found that a little goes a long way as the orzo alone provides plenty of moisture and flavour.

This was a big disappointment; I found it to be bland as well as another reviewer and I followed the recipe to the letter. The red wine sauce was the best part (although it was too thin); it would probably taste better over chicken.

Rating: 3
Very good, and very easy to make. As many others commented, the real star of the show is the orzo. I used half and half instead of whipping cream and I can't imagine it is any better with the cream. The red wine sauce was ok. In my opinion the wine flavor was a bit muted due to all the butter. I also thickened it with a touch of cornstarch/water. As other reviewers commented, the sauce is on the thin side. The recipe is definitely a keeper! Note: I can't imagine toasting the orzo in the oven for 20 minutes. My orzo went from the usual golden pasta color to brown (not golden brown)in about 8 minutes. Looked a little funky, but the taste was still great.

I made this last night and I thought it was easy and had a very different style and taste. I would have given only 3 stars but my boyfriend loved it and his friend who just stopped by for a quick visit and absolutely HATES salmon ate it and raved about it for an hour after dinner. The orzo did not seem to need the whipping cream and the sauce did not seem to need the butter...maybe next time I will cut the fat out and see if it is still as good.

This was a disappointing recipe. Very bland! The salmon had no kick and the red wine sauce just didn't do it for us. I did like the toasted orzo and will probably use it again as a side dish. If I try it with salmon, I'll find something to give it more flavor.

I've made this many times. It's ideal for a dinner party....guests always impressed. Great recipe!

Prepared this for dinner last night and it was just wonderful. I heeded the advice of many and did a lot of the prep work in advance. I also broiled the salmon. I added the orzo to mushroom and hot broth too soon so just removed from heat and covered, When it was time to cook it, I found that it was perfectly "cooked" so just added the tarragon and milk (instead of cream) and heated through.........it was perfect. The whole family loved it!

My Boyfriend and I tried this recipe out for the two of us and absolutly loved it, expecially the red wine sacue (although we do wish it was a bit thicker). We plan on making it for a dinner party this week. We left some of the onions in the red wine sauce instead of draining them all out, giving them a wonderful taste. We highly recomend that you try out this wonderful recipe, which is simple to make yet elegant in taste.

This recipe is delicious and it's really not too difficult to make. It's a great recipe to cook for a small dinner party because everyone can hang out in the kitchen while you stir the orzo (you won't be frantically chopping and doing things at the last minute with this recipe). It does take some time, but it's the kind of time that can be spent sipping wine and talking with your friends.

Unlike all the other reviewers, I wasn't crazy about the orzo or the fresh tarragon. But I loved the red wine sauce! It was absolutely terrific. Next time I will make double the amount of sauce, since my husband & I liked it so much.

People, People, People! This was incredibly exquisite! Just me and my husband tonite but can't wait to serve this to dinner quests. I had little fresh ingredients. I used both dried thyme and tarragon. No shallots on hand and used whites of green onions. Used an inexpensive Sirah in the sauce and 2percent milk as my cream(healthier). Also, left out butter. The toasted orzo was excellent. THIS course could not have been better OR could it? I can't imagine what grandeur would have been...if I'd had everything fresh and proper as recipe calls for. Good people , you must submit....

My husband and I loved this dish. I plan to make it for two future dinners for company. It's so very tasty and elegant. Following someone else's suggestion, I broiled the salmon, with great results. It takes a deceptively long time to prepare, though. Next time, I will do AMAP in advance.

Rather than pan fry, I broiled the salmon with terrific results. The orzo was amazing.....used dried tarragon instead of fresh and was still excellant. Highly recommend. Wish the red wine reduction was a little thicker to coat the salmon better but still delicious all the same!

I agree, the orzo is wonderful -- worth making on it's own. This recipe is fairly simple to make. I plan to make this next time we have company.

This dish took, for a student cook, quite a while for preparation and cooking, but was definately worth it. I have never made anything soo scrumptious. Definate hit with the friends, everyone wants the recipe!

Very good. I made this for my parents and every one loved it. The orzo is great and could go with other fish, or even chicken. The sauce is good, but the butter is not necessary.

The flavors in this dish are wonderful!! I didn't use tarragon and I used a little less butter & cream than it called for. For the red wine sauce, I used a cabernet and it was delicious.

This was an easy and wonderful dish. I especially liked the recipe for the toasted orzo, which I have made several times since. I served with sauted spinach as well, which went real nice. The second time I made it I marinated the salmon in a little soy, garlic, lime and sugar for about 30 minutes. YUM!!!!!!!
