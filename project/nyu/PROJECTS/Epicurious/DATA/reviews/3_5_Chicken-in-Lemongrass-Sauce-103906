Excellent flavor, didn't have oyster sauce, added Tbs of spicy red chili paste instead, added 1 tsp of starch of he sauce to help it sick. Would definitely make again. Really easy to make - could make this after work on weekdays. :)

This was an easy tasty dish for a made-at-home recipe. I cut the nam pal to 2 tbl and used 2 tbl of palm sugar. Did not use the green beans.

In my opinion - this recipe called for too much fish sauce. My family wasn't prepared for the smell and so was turned off from the final product from the get-go. I doubt I'll make it again, but if we did, and used less fish sauce, it'd probably be pretty tasty.

Yummy! I've made this several times and each time it is a hit. I always use a tube of prepared lemongrass (one tube is 1/3 cup), and have sometimes added a little coconut milk. I adore this recipe and it's become a constant on our menu.

Rating: 3
Agreed-- tasty but not amazing. I added 1/2c coconut milk, some diced chili pepper, and a squeeze of lime. It was still rather dull.

Rating: 4
We make this all the time, but we combine 3 hot red chillies with the garlic and lemongrass (finely diced first) in a mini-chopper and blend it very fine and add this after the chicken is partly cooked. Everything else, we follow the recipe pretty much as written (using 1/2 the sugar, as others have suggested). The chillies add the desired heat.

Really tasty, quick recipe that the whole family enjoyed. The one trick is the use of the lemongrass. Make sure to mince finely before using.

I've had this at Le Colonial and this was very close to the original - as I remember it. We liked the subtle flavors and added some Sriracha chili sauce to heighten its kick. I have two hints to add to the discussion: Lemon grass is woody. I sliced it lengthwise then pounded the halves before mincing it with a knife. Pounding it releaes some of the flavor from the stalks. Mince it well or the flavor does not come through. Also, I held the garlic in step 1 until the just before I moved on to the next step. This keeps the garlic from burning and turning bitter. Definately a "make again" for us.

Added lime zest of almost two limes and most of the juice of one lime, and used roasted chili paste instead of oyster sauce. I did this after tasting the sauce and finding it bland. I have found that with Thai and related cuisines, you want to balance the sweet-hot-sour elements, and adding more sour did the trick for me.

I made this for my husband and a couple of friends last night. We all loved it. I can only imagine that the those who did not like this recipe made it incorrectly or did not know how to handle lemongrass. I ended up omitting the oyster sauce and adding corn starch to get the sauce to thicken and some peanuts too. The next time I make this, I may try adding coconut milk as some others have suggested.

Oh, and I did add some sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit, as the oyster sauce I had was not a spicy one.

Really tasty. Lemongrass is tough to work with. If it's frustrating to you, some grocery stores have it in plastic tubes in the produce section and it's pretty good and super easy to use.

Perhaps it was just my wife and I and our lack of an adventurous palate, but we were very disappointed with this meal. I believe that the fish/oyster sauce was the culprit.

I thought it was just O.K. I appreciated the recommendations of others in using a processor to mince the lemongrass...I might try it again just to see if I did something wrong. I thought it was one note and boring which was a surprise because these are ingredients I almost never use, so I expected it to tatse really different and interesting. I was underwhelmed.

Whole Foods was out of fresh lemongrass so I bought it in a jar. The jarred lemongrass smelled like furniture polish and tasted worse. So I substituted a heaping quarter cup of ground fresh ginger root (thereby converting the recipe to chicken in ginger sauce), added some Thai Roasted Chili paste for heat and it turned out *amazingly* good; and even the kids cleaned their plates. Next time I'll substitute chicken thighs for breasts; but the ginger was so fabulous I doubt I'll ever try it with lemongrass.

This was my first time to use lemongrass. I think that I did something wrong. I read in another recipe to use a mortor and I think I will next time. I tasted no lemon flavor and the lemon grass was hard. I stipped the stalk down to the tender part like the recipe said. The flavor was great and I will try this again. But could someone out there help me out? Is a mortor the answer? Thanks to all of you who will help.

Very tasty! I agree with the other reviewer that you should definnitely put the lemongrass in a blender or food processor. My kids even ate some, and they are not big fans of Asian food.

Rating: 3
We loved this one and it's going on my list of "make again" recipes. My local Asian market had some Thai "bird peppers" and fresh Thai basil in stock; these made a wonderful addition without killing the flavor of the other ingredients. I finely sliced 4 or 5 of the chiles and added them with the onion and garlic. The basil was tossed in at the end. The aroma was fantastic!

Horrible....a waste of time and ingredients, even after the tips from the other reviewers. Dumped it down the drain and went for chain restaurant food. That is how bad it was. Does not even resemble Vietnamese food.

Quite possibly the worst meal I have ever had. I used all the other reviewers tips, but nothing could save this one. Did not even resemble Vietnamese cuisine.

Yeah...that bad that chain restaurant food was more palatable.

Since we had a chicken dish a night before, I made this dish with halibut instead. Delicious! I just had regular oyster sauce so I added fresh hot pepper. My "not so hungry" husband went for seconds.

Rating: 3
It didn't disappoint! I wanted a bit more sauce for the rice so I added some canned coconut milk which goes well with lemongrass and chicken. It was awesome! I even threw in some mushrooms. The best part was after it was done I put it on a very low flame (stirring occasionally) for a half an hour and if anything the flavor just got better. Perfect for company because it can be made ahead (mine was excellent reheated the next day too!).

I used tofu instead of chicken and cut back to 1 Tbs of sugar. It had a great taste and was very easy to make.

to Rich, maybe you have used less expensive ingredients which contain a high salt content. Results of most recipes are due to the quality of the ingredients. Overall, good recipe. I have been cooking Thai for several years and this was a fairly typical recipe.

This is a definite winner. Came together very quickly after mise en place. An outstanding recipe for Chinese long beans. We made 1.5 times the recipe. Used trimmed, boneless chicken thighs. Use only the white tender part of the lemon grass stalk and reserve the remainder for use in marinades or asian-style stocks. Chop coarsely then mince in food processor. Used only 2T. total of palm sugar, and 2T. each of oyster, and hoisin sauce with great results. Husband and I enjoyed preparing this together. Served with steamed brown jasmine rice (try it, available at Trader Joe's), and fragrant jasmine tea.

May be the worst recipe I have ever endeavored to make! If you do wish to try it I would try the following: 1) Fish Sauce. Per the recipe, I added in at a high heat, and it effervesced producing one of the most un-appetizing smells ever--cleared the room. My 48" hood couldn't handle the job. 2) Oyster Sauce--you only need a little. Had difficulty distinguishing this from a salt-lick. 3) Use twice the garlic-it gets lost. 4) Use half the turmeric. 5) No need to add any salt--this dish is hypertension on a plate!

To Cook from Dallas: use oyster sauce to stir-fry vegetables with lots of chopped garlic. As for fish sauce, we typically add a dash of it when steaming fish (such as cod fish). Ingredients to add: light soya sauce, 1 tsp of cooking oil, 2 tbsp water, chopped garlics + onions, garlic (julienned), wedges of tomatoes, fish sauce. Put these on top of the fish, and steam for 10 minutes. Easy!

I absolutely loved this recipe. It was easy and quick to make. I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted it with the hoisin sauce I had in my fridge. Can't wait to make this again.

Definitely, definitely only mince the lemongrass right before you cook this recipe. I didn't heed everybody's warning and had to dump in a whole bunch of bottled lemongrass (which does NOT compare to fresh) because I made my mise-en-place about 3 hours before dinner, and the beautiful fresh lemongrass lost all it's aroma sitting in a saran-wrapped bowl. I wasn't that impressed by the dish, but my boyfriend loved it.

Rating: 3
Well, this recipe didn't live up to expectations; although, it wasn't bad. My family doesn't care for spicy dishes, so I used regular Oyster sauce rather than spicy. Not sure what the spicy sauce would have done to the overall result, but I doubt if it would have changed much. I ground the lemongrass in the food processor as others suggested, but wonder if it diminished the overall impact of the flavor on the recipe. We'd eat it again, and probably will. What else am I supposed to do with bottles of oyster and fish sauces?

This was the first time I used lemongrass and I found it very refreshing. I substituted hoisin sauce for oyster sauce as I didn't have that and it added a nice sweet flavour. And the green beans make it a very complete dish. I will make this again.

Yum!! Really tasty recipe. I added some sliced carrots as well as about 1/4c more chicken broth (we like sauce). I also reduced the sugar by about half and used brown sugar as recomended here.

I really love Lemongrass Chicken. This recipe was simple and delicious. I made one mistake by chopping lemongrass early in day, several hours before using. I believe it lost much of its fragrance by the time I used it.

This is a wonderful dish, especially if you like to experiment a little. Using the long beans is much better than regular green beans. Serve with jasmine rice (not a recipe but a type of rice) and Singha Thai beer. Outstanding! I leave out the onions and still find the dish outstanding. I also use non-spicy oyster sauce and the flavor is still wonderful.

This was a very good dish, fun for a quick and easy casual dinner party. It smells AMAZING. Be sure to MINCE the lemongrass. We cut it into small pieces, threw it in the food processor, then minced it even finer with a good knife. Otherwise, you'll have to eat around it because of its tough texture. We threw in two handfuls of fresh Asian basil leaves at the end. We served it with Vietnamese chili garlic sauce (that bright red "salsa" with white seeds) set on the table for color and kick! Starting with a good peanut oil was key. Good flavor, and unbeatable viscosity with the heat.

Simply great! I wasn't sure what to expect, thought it might be a love/hate thing, but really enjoyed this and it looked exactly like the photo. I took the advice of several other reviewers and reduced the amount of fish sauce to 2T and also used 1T brown sugar. I also added 1 very finely minced Thai chile pepper (much too hot/spicy) so next time I will add it whole and then remove it before serving. Re the lemongrass: I used only the white/pale green section and minced it very, very fine and it cooked beautifully, soft and very flavourful. I think if the darker, grass-blade-like parts are used, then it doesn't soften well and is very unpleasant to eat/chew. Garnished with fresh minced cilantro and served with steamed rice and a cooling cucumber salad, this was an eye pleasing and very yummy chicken dish that was quick and easy to prepare.

One word. BREATHTAKING. This tastes EXACTLY like what I'd eat at a Vietnamese restaurant. It captures the complexity of flavors and colors and blended them rather deliciously. Coriander was the secret, elusive flavor. I suggest adding several BASIL LEAVES towards the end of cooking. The punget basil imparts an added zing!

FABULOUS. guests loved it. Used 1 TBSP of brown sugar, also added water chestnuts. I used a rasper to mince the lemongrass. What a great recipe!

A tip for making lemongrass soft enough so you don't have to discard it is to soak the pieces in warm water for a bit (30 minutes or so) before adding them in. Overall, I liked this recipe a lot and I'm planning on doing this again in the future. Quite a tasty dish.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, but then I love just about anything with lemongrass. Had to cut down on sugar and add some red pepper for heat as my oyster sauce wasn't at all spicy. Good quality green beans are important; when I made this in the winter it wasn't nearly as good.

Tasty dish! I didn't cook the green beans in advance though. I also cut back on the sugar based upon the reviews. I used 1/2 tbsp instead of the 3 tbsp the recipe calls for. To the cook from San Francisco: Use your food processor to mince the lemongrass.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I cut down on the sugar as recommended, but I still thought it was too sweet. Way too salty too - the extra salt for seasoning is not needed. The lemon was a bit too overpowering also. Overall, this dish was okay, but I probably won't be making it again.
