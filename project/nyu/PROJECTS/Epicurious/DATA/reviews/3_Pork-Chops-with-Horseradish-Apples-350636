very bland if it were not for the salt and pepper. the horseradish and the apples cancel each other out for flavor. I really wanted to like this dish as it sounded interesting.

I was really hoping for something better with the horseradish and apples -- a blend between the sweetness of the apples and the spicieness from the horseradish. This was primarily the horseradish with little sweetness -- awful. My kids joke about it.

Without the horseradish, this dish is lifeless, somehow. I think a sweeter apple might help. With the horseradish it tastes like pork cocktail.

My kids even like this!!! I served their dinner before I added the horseradish. Quick, easy, delicious...what more could you ask for!!!

I agree with the first reviewer that it was easy to prepare and delicious. I don't know if it was the granny smiths I used or what, but my husband and I agreed that a little more sweetness would be welcome. Will definitely make it again.

This was a delicious easy to prepare meal. It is especially great for weeknight preparation. I ended up putting about 1 1/2 TBSP horseradish in because we like spice but I think it would be great either way! I served this with the roasted cauliflower found on this site.
