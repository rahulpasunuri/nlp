Excellent! Didn't use truffles or parsely, and didn't need to. The foie gras, eggs, and fresh tarragon together were great. Made it in the oven, which seemed to take awhile, but with good results. Served with toasted brioche and a green salad with vinaigrette dressing -- a complete, elegant meal.

Very easy to make and delicious! I made this for an anniversary dinner for 2. Used foie gras, but instead of truffles, used truffle oil. I had trouble cooking it on the stove top, it took quite a while for the whites on the top to cook. I will definitely make this again, just next time I will put the pan (with water) in the oven.

Excellent and very, very simple to make. From start to end (first time and I'm NOT an experienced cook) was about 20 minutes including all prep. Delicious! I used duck eggs to go along with the duck theme of duck pate and duck breast. 8 minutes was perfect to yield a golden, liquid yolk and solid white. I used an organic truffle butter instead of the truffle slices to save on cost (and I had the truffle butter in my fridge - waiting for any excuse to use) The butter made a nice sheen over the egg and was very aromatic. Exceptional! A keeper.

I omitted the truffles and parsley (don't like the flavor) and it was still delicious. Rich and creamy with runny fatty goodness yet not heavy. If you use raw foie gras cubes it will melt into the eggs during cooking. If you sear the foie gras for 15 - 30 seconds on each side first and then cut into cubes it will somewhat retain its shape during the steaming and add some texture to the dish. Both methods were delicious. Since I splurged on the foie gras, truffles were out of my budget. Perhaps I'll try some truffle oil next time.

OK, So you don't really need to use foie gras, and I found a very good substitute: Påté with truffles and champagne. The taste is great and saves you some truffle money. Tarragon and is best to have. I also tried dill, but not as good.

Wonderfully rich and decadent, accompanied it with champagne.

I love runny eggs, love foie gras, love truffles. This seemed like a no brainer to me. I made it according to the recipe, except did not have parsley, only had tarragon. To me, the flavors did not come together. It was OK, but not nearly as good as I had expected.

Deliciously creamy. It is a surprising way to really extract the flavors of foie gras. You can replace the shaved truffles with truffle flavored olive oil.

It's awesome! Warmed foie gras and running egg yolks are amazingly satisfying. Be sure to use fresh eggs of course and not to overcook the eggs. We used a slice of plastic-wrapped foie gras mousse from Whole Foods (Three Little Pigs brand.) Not as expensive as pure foie gras blocks even though I am sure the real thing would be even more amazing. Omitted black truffle shavings and drizzled white truffle oil instead. The perfume of this dish is just wonderful ... Do try.
