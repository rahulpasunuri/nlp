Really tasty. Even though my quinoa package said that it had been rinsed already, I rinsed it several times. The foaminess led me to believe that there were still saponins, which give it a bitter flavor. The recipe itself is delicious! I added some toasted pine nuts. Other than that, I followed the ingredients of the recipe. Didn't do the fluffing step.

I do think the exta step of steaming the quinoa does 'fluff' it up. Not critical, but adds a nice touch to this grain. And I agree with the gist of most reviewers' comments - nice basic recipe to work with as you will. I added craisins, for example.

What am I missing? First, is that steaming w/the towel really necessary? Now I have a towel that's covered w/cooked quinoa - what a mess! Next, it was TOTALLY BORING!! My husband almost never makes a negative comment about food I prepare, but he completely rejected this. We have quinoa regularly and he likes it, but not this preparation. Never again.

I added some fresh basil as suggested by another reader, and also used the organic tri-color quinoa from Trader Joe's. I cooked it in the rice cooker, using same proportions/instructions for semi-brown rice. Came out so perfect! Also drizzled a little of a meyer lemon olive oil that I had on hand. WIll be my new side dish of choice.

Made this last night with steamed lobster. It was delicious and very easy. We eat a lot of quinoa because of my dietary restrictions, and we've learned to love it. The reason for the washing is that some quinoa has a waxy outer coating that can taste bitter. Most quinoa available in the US today is pre-washed, so the rinsing isn't necessary.

You can toast the quinoa in a couple TBSP of oil in a skillet first until lightly golden. No need to wash it! Adds great flavor to the finished dish.

Doubled the recipe and used red quinoa. I suggest making this ahead because the flavor needs to mellow. Used stock instead of water in the final stage. This is a good side for most any recipe but tastes great on its own with chopped, fresh basil.

Did follow the recipe but I too would like to have the need for all that washing clarified. I seem to recall there is an over-coat that would be bitter if not washed off. If that is true, what about the good results reported with just boiling in 2:1 ration of liquid to grain?

This is my go-to quinoa recipe. I use it as the base for all sorts of quinoa dishes. The process described for cooking here may seem tedious, but the results are a lovely, nutty grain. I often add things like golden raisins and toasted almonds to this dish. Also caramelized onions or some sauted mushrooms are marvelous. This is always a crowd pleaser!

This was very nice and good with fish. I love quinoa but have never understood this elaborate washing and steaming nonsense. I tried it once before and it was definitely NOT worth the extra trouble. I did however, make it with chicken broth which adds a richness.

This is a very nice quinoa recipe that I will make again for sure. It's too simple of a side to receive 4 forks though. If you want a great quinoa recipe (w/apricots and pine nuts) go to this site: http://debrastark.com/recipe_quinoa.html

This was a great and simple recipe that we'll definitely make again. I only gave it 3 instead of 4 because I changed it to the juice of 1 entire lemon and 2 tsp of lemon zest. I also just boiled my quinoa in 2 cups of chicken broth. My husband ate the whole batch on his own! It was wonderful, light and delicious.

My first taste of quinoa was delightful with this recipe. It's a warm and corn-like essence with an unexpected crunchiness. This, with the lemon fragrance made it a hit. I do have to consider the caloric content though. Red Mill brand is already soaked, but I did it anyway.

Mildly lemon-scented, a decent side dish. I am still in search of the GREAT quinoa recipe. This was a bit more trouble than simply cooking the quinoa in a pot with the right amount of liquid; the texture was pretty similar to when I have just boiled it and let it sit.

Indeed, ridiculously simple. I made it exactly as written, and I also made it with chicken broth instead of water. Either way it's excellent.

this is ridiculously simple, but very very tasty! Perfect side dish for trout and asparagus... LOVED it! Made exactly as written.

I love quinoa but gave this recipe two forks because the result tasted a bit bland. That may be because I used Meyer lemons that were very sweet. To brighten it up I tripled the juice, added extra zest and fresh dill. Served this as a compliment to sea bass in a lemon dill sauce and my guests gave it rave reviews.

Added chicken stock to cooking liquid and toasted almonds and finely chopped spring onions at the end. Served it with the Chicken Marbella.

this was delicious! i was skeptical that just a little bit of citrus would transform the quinoa, but really it was perfect! i tasted the mixture before adding the additional 1/4 tsp of salt at the end and i'm glad i did! it was quite salty after cooking in the salt water. also, i only had limes on hand, but it was still delish :)

Delicious. Made it exactly as in the recipe. It didn't seem like with so few ingredients it would be very flavorful, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I will watch the salt next time, I may have added a bit too much to the water. Great with broiled fish with basil butter, also on here.

I forgot that I also added fresh chopped dill. Fantastic with fish, or grilled pork loin with dijon & orange.

This is a great replacement for cous cous. We had friends over for dinner, and they loved it! Since it was my first time making quinoa, I prepared per package directions, like rice. However, I substituted chicken broth, 2 parts broth : 1 part quinoa, adding grated garlic in the broth. I simmered on low for 15 minutes, let it stand for 10 mins., then finished with the lemon and olive oil. I'm anxious now to try this cooking method, as mine did turn out a little sticky. That was good, in a way.

I loved this recipe, very clean, delicate and elegant flavours. Like some of the other commenters I used 2.5 cups of organic chicken stock instead of H2O. I also prefer the simplified method of cooking quinoa for 15 minutes then draping with a towel for 5 minutes before fluffing. The addition of a chiffonade of fresh picked basil just before serving kicked both the flavour and aroma of this recipe up another notch. It was the perfect side dish for grilled wild salmon fillet and fresh asparagus with balsalmic glace.

This is a nice, simple side. I added a little cilantro. Went well with beet-and-greens salad and grilled salmon. In the past I have always just rinsed and boiled quinoa for 15 minutes. The extra 10 minutes of steaming for the fluffier texture is a great idea. I like it both ways, but will definitely make it again with the extra step if I'm using it in a salad that contains a lot of other moist ingredients.

This recipe + fresh chopped basil - zest = PERFECT. And easy too!

I loved this recipe, but I'm also a lemon lover! After the leftovers cooled, I made a pita pocket with the quinoa, tomatos, cukes, and avacado that was amazing! The lemon from the quinoa was a wonderful compliment to the vegetables.

I was underwhelmed by this dish, my first try at quinoa. I will look for some other recipes before nixing the entire quinoa idea.

I've made quinoa using the standard method, but the "fluff" factor is better with the extra steaming. The "extra" time involved didn't affect overall prep time for the meal I was preparing. It was a perfect compliment with the seared tuna that I made that night.

i lovee quinoa and thought this pretty good...i think the lemon over powered the quinoa a little...i thought it tasted a little like lemon scented cleaning stuff or something but everyone else liked it

I thought the added time to "fluff" was perfect. I paired this dish with a beet salad with walnuts, onion, and goat cheese- I prepared these while it boiled and then prepared beet greens with grapeseed oil and garlic while the quinoa steamed. The LEMON was key to adding a little flavor to this grain. It will become a household staple.

No need to rinse. Just cook as for rice: 2 parts water to 1 part quinoa. Bring to boil, cover, simmer 20 min. Fluff with fork and add dressing.

I didn't find this recipe complicated and the steaming helped the quinoa become fluffy.

I did not find it so complicated to make, it did make it very light and fluffy. I think I will always use this technique when making Quinoa. I thought the flavor was a bit bland, but will try it with other spices. Cilantro?? broccoli, tomatoe etc.

I paired this stunningly simple dish with white wine braised chicken thighs to raves. It was the perfect compliment to the garlic and wine. I dressed the entire dish with extra lemon zest.

An easy, different side dish. The lemon- scented part is a delicious foil to either seafood (as recommended), but I served it with the rib- eye steaks with red wine sauce on the next page, and it was perfect. I did not wash the quinoa in "three changes of cold water", which did seem fussy as a previous reviewer noted; however the process of steaming it for 10 minutes after boiling does seem to render it drier and "fluffier", which is a good thing. Will definitely make again.

quinoa can simply be cooke without steaming it after boiling it a bit... you can even cook it in a rice cooker. This recipe is making quinoa seem like a fussy grain when it is not.
