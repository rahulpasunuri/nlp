Yummmmmmm. My top round was two slices aka steaks cut from the top round. each was about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inch thick. It was 19 degrees out with a 25 mph wind. I opted for the oven broiler. Cooking time was still spot on and the flavors were wonderful. Perfect medium rare. I also discovered lamb top round which is fork tender. This recipe is going into my go to for a quick dinner. I will also be talking to my butcher of how great the top round is and to keep it on the shelf.

I agree with the last review, that this recipe took MUCH longer to cook than the recipe claimed. As a personal chef, I was prepared to serve the lamb but instead had to postpone serving dinner an additional 10 - 15 minutes while I used a backup plan to broil the meat until it was cooked properly. And it turned out to be quite tough, which I attribute to the cut of meat. It is curious, since other sites say that this cut is a tender cut, but I am not convinced. I think a top round lamb roast needs longer cooking, or maybe it would be best cut into steaks and then grilled. As it was, cooking it over a BBQ as a butterflied roast was not a success.

This dish took much longer to grill then the recipe indicated. I also was not impressed with the 'paste'. I will definitely pick a different recipe from this website next time.
