Please don't get me wrong, this dessert is quite good. It's just that it was a bit of a dissapointment considering the rave reviews. It was also a tad expensive, and I think I would have saved myself time simply buying a completed dessert. The filling was a bit too lemony. On the upside, the candied lemon peel is wonderful, and it is rather fun to make. I want to next try limes, oranges and grapefruit. Everyone just loved it!

Layered in trifle dish instead of assembling as cake. Delicious and refreshing!

A hit in our family--everyone loved it! We made only half the whipped cream, assembled half of the cakes, and saved the rest for the next night. It stored well separately and was easy enough for my son (age 10) to put together. We did not use all the lemon juice, since the kids prefer their filling not too tart. :)

So easy but so delicious! The candied lemon peel is not at all difficult although it is not at all neccessary -- more for presentation than anything. The lemon filling was super easy to make and how hard is it to whip some cream and cut some pound cake? I will definitly be coming back to this recipe for future dessert needs. I much prefer to cook over bake so this was a nice diversion from my usual dessert option of setting out bowls, spoons and various containers of Ben and Jerry's/HagenDaas!

I was surprised at how good this was. Next time, I'll have to make extra candied lemon peel, because we couldn't stop tasting it while we made it. It was nice and tart and not terribly sweet.

Great summertime dessert- quick and easy- I didn't have a problem w/the peel being too sugary once I shook off the excess.

This is a good dessert if you like lemon and very refreshing. I chose this recipe originally because I wanted something I could make quick. It took much longer than I expected. But well worth it in the end. I could have done with out the candied lemon peel, too sugary. That probably would have saved some time.
