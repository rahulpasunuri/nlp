I followed some of the suggestions below and subbed coconut milk, but instead of ginger, I upped the garlic a smidge, and cooked the bulgur longer before adding the veggies and shimp at the same time. Lime juice was added last to retain it's tartness. With concerns about overcooked shimp, I figured adding them later would do the trick, and while it may have taken longer than a few minutes for the shrimp to pink up, they were not overcooked. Great quick recipe for a foodie working mom with a toddler. Whom, by the way (the toddler) could not get enough of this flavor (rare, I must say!)Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummy and easy to make.

This recipe exceeded my expectations. Instead of water, I used 1 cup clam juice (just trying to use it up) and 1 cup shrimp stock. The shrimp I had on hand were shell-on, so I poached them separately, removed the shells, and added them in at the very end. Would make again.

I went the Thai route and sautéed the ginger, used a bit of coconut milk and boosted the lime. I don't think these changes were necessary, but it all worked well together. I also tried a variation using a firm-ish roasted pumpkin in place of the shrimp. Although I prefer the flavors from the shrimp, the pumpkin blended well with the rest while providing the right complementary texture.

This was fine, but it did lack flavour. Also, the shrimp get overcooked easily, I'd almost use pre-cooked ones and at them at the end. Next time I'd add some chopped tomato, or roast the red peppers.

Good and healthy. I crumbled a little feta cheese on top which made a world of difference, would highly recommend. Will swap out the water for stock and add ginger when sauteing the garlic next time.

Made this recipe for the first time with fresh shrimp and corn. Followed the recipe, minus the lime wedge garnish. Husband is a fussy eater (meat and potatoes guy), and scoffed at the idea of "risotto without cheese". Whatever. This recipe makes 4 servings, and my husband had 3 of the 4 in one sitting : )

Really quite tasty. I've made it several times and added pan grilled scallops at the end both with and without the shrimp. The Bulgur wheat is a nice change from Risotto (which I also love). Saved this one to my recipe box!

Very tasty! I threw the shrimp shells into the water for the first few minutes of boiling, then removed them with a slotted spoon. That added a nice flavor to the whole dish without having to use stock or extra salt. I used all of the liquid, and preferred an extra squeeze of lime at the end.

I used a can of coconut milk plus some water. I think it would have been too bland with just water. The recipe sounded as if it was trying to be Thai flavored. I added a little rooster sauce. My guests loved it and so did I.

Used a wild rice blend instead of bulgar and it worked fine; also used chicken broth and as others suggested added ginger, leeks and a pinch of cayenne. Came out well and was devoured completely. Can see this as a versatile base for other additions

I love this recipe. I changed the following. I added leek in the beginning, substituted chicken stock for water and replaced the prawns and corn with asparagus and crab. It is easy and excellent.

The flavors in this recipe are good (added ginger and increased the red pepper flakes) but the times are WAY off. In order to use the recipe as written, you would have to use pre-cooked shrimps. The raw ones took far longer than a few minutes to cook. The bulgur also took longer than written.

I am eating this right now and I love it. Very easy and pretty healthy.

I was out of red pepper flakes, so I used cayenne and a little bit of soy sauce for added flavor. I also had to use more water than the recipe called for. This meal was easy, healthy, and delicious! My husband and I both loved it. Next time I make it I will probably use less shrimp though, because my favorite part was the bulgur and corn.

I made this according to the recipe and found it quite tasty, and the fact that it's healthy to boot is a perk! I would make it again exactly so for myself, but my boyfriend wasn't such a fan of the bulgur. The next time I make it for the two of us I'll probably substitute regular carnaroli risotto rice, and maybe add a bit of cream to satisfy the fat-lover.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It is healthy but full of flavor. I make it at least once every two weeks. I definitely recommend it!

I followed the recipe except I used chicken broth, added ginger, and used carrots instead of corn. Also, I added the cilantro during the last minute of cooking. I had to add a lot more liquid than called for to get that "soupy consistency". But it ended up tasty and healthy and I would make it again, although I am not sure that it was any better than the receipes that call for cooking bulgar the regular way and then adding veggies, shrimp, etc.

I made a modified version of this recipe and loved it. I ate it for lunch for the entire week. Like the other reviewers, also added minced ginger with the garlic. I also added 1 cup of lentils (already boiled in broth, bay leaf, and drained). And used both lemon juice and lemon zest.

I don't know what I did wrong but I followed the dish exactly as it called (but for only two servings.) Next time I would add more garlic and onion and use couscous or quinoa. It didn't stand out for me but it did give me ideas for future recipes.

Question- do you think you could substitute quinoa in this recipe?

Quick and easy meal that not just tastes great, but looks great. I made a few modifications by adding some ginger, using half stock instead of water, and adding some butter (and some calories).

We really enjoyed this recipe, but we did make a couple of changes. First we added fresh ginger with the garlic. A very good addition. Second, we added the corn and bell pepper before the shrimp. A quick and healthy dish.

I am on a detox diet, so I madet this last night when we had guests for dinner (they are very healthy eaters as well). It was only the second time I have cooked with Bulgur wheat, but it won't be the last! It was very refreshing and clean. Grilled chicken would work well over this as well. I would agree with adding a bit more red pepper. The next day I had it cold for lunch and it was even better!

What we did is instead of cooking the Bulgar wheat and garlic together in the beginning -- we cooked the bulgar wheat before hand. I think when we cooked the wheat we either cooked it for to long or we added to much water, either way is went a bit mushy on us.Next time I think we will replace the Bulgar Wheat with something a little bit lighter,like cous cous! We also considered putting a bit of green onion, next time. The dish had great flavour, we love our dishes alittle bit spicy so we added more red pepper flakes. Other then the wheat going mushy, this was a delicous dish for a light dinner or lunch!

I was a little nervous of this one because of the lack of reviews, but I was looking for an alternate to Tabbouleh in order to use up some bulgur. This was quick, easy, and turned out great. It's not too heavy, as many risottos are, and the lime and cilantro make it refreshing. I wasn't sure about just warming the peppers instead of cooking them, but I wouldn't make it any differently next time, as they add a nice texture and keep their full flavour. Overall, thumbs up!
