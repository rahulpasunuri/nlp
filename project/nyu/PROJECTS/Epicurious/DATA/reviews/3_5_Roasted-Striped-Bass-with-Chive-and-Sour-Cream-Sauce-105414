i made this for a holiday dinner, rave reviews. i experimented and made two sauces, one greek yogurt (not low or nonfat) as well as sour cream. the greek yogurt was far better and definitely needed some water. i also made it the day before and the flavors really melded. because of timing and kitchen constraints, i roasted fish at 425 after seasoning with fresh thyme, garlic and olive oil. all of the flavors compliment each other and the yogurt calms the heat from the potatoes. ( don't bother cooking the zucchini, it will cook enough from the heat of the pan and then added potatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe for when you want to entertain but not go all out. The layered presentation with crowning sprouts makes quite a lovely presentation. I substituted rockfish, dropped the water (thank you reviewers!), and served a side of sauteed grape tomatoes for color. Even my boys loved it - a miracle!

This review only for the Sour Cream sauce. I indexed this recipe because I wanted a Sour Cream sauce for some panko sautee'd bass. This was perfect. Thanks for the suggestions to leave out the water - I did too. Also used reduced-fat sour cream with no issues. Rather than chives, I did green-onion and dill, since that's what I had, and used same for garnish. Great sauce, thanks.

I did as other readers said, I omitted the water. I also cut the sour cream back to 1/2 cup, then added enough cream cheese to make up 2/3 cup. Then I added Franks Hot Sauce (about 1 1/2tsp) to taste, I also added 3 Tablespoons of Medium Salsa and 1 tsp chopped garlic. I put everything in the mixer, as I don't own a blender. I seared the fish and flipped the fish in the pan after skin side was done for a few minutes. I placed the fish back into the pan for further cooking. About 5 minutes before the fish was done I pealed the skin, an kept skin side up, and put the sauce on the fish and continued cooking. The sauce was excellent and my company raved about the taste. This recipe is Gluten Free.

Quick and delicious! I too omitted the water in the sauce. Our first time eating striped bass, it was firm but not fishy at all. Will make again!

As recommended by other reviewers, I omitted the water from the sauce, which was the right choice. It paired well with wild striped bass, wilted baby spinach, and whole roasted huckleberry and blue potatoes. My dining companions loved it so much they started dunking bread into the extra sauce!

While I did enjoy this recipe (I only made the fish and sauce), I feel the sauce could be made both stronger and thicker. So I would recommend (as another reviewer already has) cutting the water. The next time I make it, I won't add in any water at all; I'll just blend the other ingredients and add water as needed. I look forward to trying it again! Extremely easy, and pleasing.

Hmmmm..... I guess I'm going against the flow here .... but I didn't like this one -- ditto for my husband. I thought the sauce took away more than it added to the fish ... I'll keep looking for a good rockfish recipe ...

Very nice recipe with a pleasing sauce. Comments from previous cooks about sauce being too thin, I found to be spot on. My suggestion would be to reduce the recommended water amount by half. In addition, since I like buttery taste in my food, replacing the oil with butter would make this a more pleasurable meal. Finally, we had halibat instead of the recommended striped bass and still found the recipe to work.

Simple and nice. Not stupendous, but nice.

Didn't have striped bass, so substituted salmon filet. Prepared fish and sauce per recipe. Spooned sauce on plate, then topped with red potato mash (a rough mash of red potatoes, garlic, butter & shallots). Then placed fish on top of potato and drizzled more sauce, garnished with parsley & lemon. Looked like a restaurant-quality dish. Everyone, including my teen daughters loved it. I used regular sour cream and sauce was fairly thin, so I don't know how low fat would work. This was very easy. I'll definitely make again.

Have made this several times. . .Great! Used low fat sour cream, green onion tops when I couldn't find chives. Will make it again!

I used low-fat sour cream. . .tasted OK but was a bit more watery than the real thing would be. Don't skip the browning of the fish--it gave it a beautiful look and texture.

We made the fish (used halibut) and the spicy potato and zucchini side dish. I substitued watercress for the sprouts. We grilled the fish with lemon and butter. We served it just like in the picture - stacked up. It was fantastic!! The combination of flavors was perfect -you and your guests will be amazed! Making the sauce was a snap. The potatos and zucchini did take a bit of time and effort. Don't even get me started on the cholesterol!! Next time I might make it with low fat sour cream and simply steam the fish and vegetables to cut down on the fat.
