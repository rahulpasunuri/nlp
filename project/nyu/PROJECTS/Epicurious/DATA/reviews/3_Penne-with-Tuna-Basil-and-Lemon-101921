This recipe was OK. I was starving and was easy & quick enough to make for supper. I enjoyed it in a big bowl but I wouldn't really go out of my way to buy these ingredients. Usually when I have basil, I make pesto.

I was really surprised at how such an easy dish tasted so good. The freshness of the basil and lemon is so good! I did add some skinned, chopped tomatoes which added a nice color. I will make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. Makes a great light weeknight dinner. I recommend adding 1/4-1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the mix, fresh ground pepper and sea salt to taste, and tripling the garlic (at least). Will try putting some black or green olives in, next time. Could also work with chopped chicken breast if you aren't big on fish.

I made it with regular spaghetti, I had no penne. I also didn't have a lemon, so I used preserved lemon juice. didn't have a lot of basil, and I don't like garlic. So most of you would probably say it was nothing like the recipe, but I think it turned out great! I'm definitely making it again. it is a great way to make something different for lunch.

This is my new favorite tuna dish. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I couldn't find tuna in oil at Trader Joe's and so I bought the tuna packed in water. So, before I put the tuna in with the other ingredients I drained all of the water from the can and filled the can - with the tuna still in it - about 3/4 full with my finest olive oil. Amazing! The flavors in this one are terrific. It was so good that I could not wait to come home from a night on the town to eat the leftovers!

This is a great pantry recipe and perfect when no one wants to go to the grocery store. It also lends itself to interpretation. I would recommend always using the lemon zest--it really makes this dish. I like adding capers and cherry tomatoes.

This was a great, quick dish. It's something easy to make when you don't feel like cooking, and it's a fresh way to use canned tuna. Kid and college student friendly.

I used angel hair pasta instead of penne. Also would recommend using balsamic vinegar in place of lemon juice.

I thought this was a wonderful alternative recipe to tuna and mayo. I used the given recipe as a base and read over some of the reviews. I added onions, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and olive oil in the tuna in addition to the given ingredients. Instead of the pasta, I served it over steamed broccoli. I also threw in a couple of chunks of colby cheese

This dish was fine--I used a ton more garlic than recommended in the recipe (I put in about six cloves), added pine nuts, and left out the basil. It's an easy way to make canned tuna a little more exciting, and it's a good weeknight meal.

Used salmon for tuna and whole wheat bow pasta for penne. This dish has a full-bodied flavor in the aftertaste. Surprisingly good!

Rating: 3
This dish was delicious, especially considering how easy it was to make. I made it the super lazy way - garlic from a jar, lemon jice from a bottle, and no fresh basil - and it was still very good. I also added chopped olives. I used whole wheat penne.

This was an ok recipe. Very easy to make.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and this is what I think works best: Use another kind of short pasta, such as fusilli or rotini, which grabs on to the other ingredients. Use more of the garlic (three cloves), basil (at least 3/4 cup), lemon (zest from 3/4 of the lemon, and maybe 1/8 cup juice), lots of freshly ground pepper and toasted pine nuts. It's a summer favorite in my house.

I like this dish because it is extremely easy to make (fast) and the kids like it. I would definitely make it again.

Great....I used to make a similar dish when I was a teen. Omit the basil and add cooked brocoli. Yummy

Overall a great, simple dish. We doubled the garlic and added a little more lemon juice as some recommended and were happy with the results. We used a medium shell pasta as a means of better containing the sauce as well.

Three forks for its simplicity & taste. It's perfect for anyone short on time, and it's impossible to mess up. I'll throw extras in depending upon what's in the fridge--a little parmesan, perhaps some olives, a little chopped onion. It's perfect as is, but have fun and be creative.

How can something so simply be so delicious?? Being in grad school and working full time, I'm always looking for something easy and quick to make, and this dish definitely fit the bill! I followed the suggestions and upped the garlic and the lemon and added capers and grated parmesan, and it was wonderful. I had been looking for something to do with that can of tuna in oil that had been in my pantry, and I'm so glad that I found this recipe! I'm giving it four forks because for the effort and time, it is definitely a yummy surprise. It's not dinner party material, but it is perfect for the weekdays. I know I'll be making this one again!

I love this recipe. It is so simple and provides huge flavor for little effort. This recipe introduced me to the wonder of light tuna in olive oil. I have not looked back.

Rating: 4
We love this. I've been making it since it first came out. I have to laugh at some of the reveiws, though---there are many reasons something can be a "dish beyond compare...." this is one because of ease and exellence. This is one of those great basic recipes that is a blast to tinker with depending on what's in season and what you feel like. Though standard is increase lemon, herbs and pepper, I've added capers, kalamatas, tomatoes, celery, zucchini, cukes, and whatever I found in the fridge. Like any recipe, the quality of the ingredients is key, especially when there are few ingredients!

WOW- who would have guessed such simple ingrediants would add up to such a powerful dish. I doubled the garlic and basil but otherwise left it untouched--My five children gobbled it up and my husband and I felt like we had eaten well.

Rating: 2
Easy (I rarely cook and this was no problem) light, but a little too bland. I added black olives. Next time I'd throw in some tomatoes and extra olive oil (the oil from the tuna can wasn't quite enough). I tried to save leftovers for lunch the next day and it was way too dry.

Made the mistake of making this as a family dinner entree -- probably would have been better as a "ladies' lunch" deal. Not very interesting flavor, IMHO.

Rating: 3
An excellent, quick, healthy dinner. We crushed about 2 cups of "Super 100" yellow cherry tomatoes and added them to the pasta. The bright colors and flavors of the tomatoes and basil made the dish. Wish I found this dish at the beginning of summer.

really liked the recipe prepared "as is" (but definitely with more lemon juice). Also, tried it with a "creamy" sauce by adding 6 oz of silken tofu pureed with a stick blender...really made a rich dish, without the fat.

Rating: 3
This is becoming a standard quick dinner in our house! I've made as-is, but as it's so flexible, I've also added (at various times) cherry tomatoes, red peppers, capers, extra garlic, olives, etc. I also don't use the tuna in olive oil, I prefer water packed albacore and just add my own EVOO. Great easy summery supper :)

this dish is great for mid week - increase basil, add some capers and lots of cracked pepper - sundried tomato if you like it.

I made this for my mother's birthday on short notice. There were a lot of people there, so I had to nearly triple the recipe, and discovered I had more than enough of some ingredients but not enough of others. Happily, the dish is extremely flexible. Also, I added some chopped red bell peppers. Everyone loved it.

Extremely easy to make and delicious. It's your basic tuna pasta salad, but with a twist...the lemon, basil, and garlic with the tuna make my mouth water. Also, the olive oil is much healthier than adding tons of mayo (like normal tuna salad). I used lemon-pepper penne to add even more flavor. I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious! One of my favorites!

Well, very easy and nice tasting. A great leftover cold or hot, as the pasta sort of "marinades" in the flavours while in the fridge overnight. But it's yummy the first time as well, and is very easy. If you don't have tuna in oil, just drain it and add some extra virgin for a great taste.

Excuse me, Raleigh. This site is not for you to judge other's ratings. Let's let everyone have an opinion, shall we? No, this is certainly not complex nor would I serve it at a dinner party. But I give it three forks for what it is: a great recipe that can be made in 12 minutes, served on a hot day and prepared with pantry staples. Personally, I enjoyed it. Added tomatoes, extra garlic and crushed red pepper (I add it to everything). Will make it again when I need to do another fifteen minute meal dash.

Very simple dish for those hot days you really don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen. I upped the garlic, as there is never "too much garlic" in our household.

I make this one a lot. So simple to slap it together and it's healthy and delish. I make it often in summer. I always cut the amount of pasta, though, because it's too much.

I thought this dish was pretty good. I love the lemon and basil. It's a great, quick, lunch type meal. However, I found that it gets 'cold' really fast since you don't cook or warm up the tuna mixture. Maybe I'll try warming it up next time...

I agree that this isn't something I'd serve at a fancy dinner party, and I'm still giving it four stars. It's a simple, easy dish that's perfect for dinner on a weeknight, and for what it is, it's terrific. I don't believe that food has to be complicated or pretentious in order to be wonderful.

This is not a 4-fork dish! It's easy, cheap, delicious, light, and healthy ... we really liked it will make it again and again. But let's be realistic - this is a pasta salad with tuna. It's fine for a light summer lunch, but definitely not a dish beyond compare, or to serve to company.

This is a taste sensation. The flavors really come together well. My hubby doesn't really like tuna from a can and he finished off the whole bowl. Definitely a keeper. Great for a summer brunch.

Wow--this is about the best thrown-together pasta dish I've ever made, and the result is a genuinely tasty, light, attractive dish as well. I too used albacore in water, and so had to add some olive oil, and I agree that you need hefty amounts of salt and pepper, but otherwise I made it as-is, garnished with chopped scallions for crunch. Served with a spinach-feta-red bell pepper salad, this is a super, super fast summer meal.

This was fabulous. I doubled the garlic, and we used lots of fresh basil from the garden and added fresh parsley, too. A dash of Tabasco revved it up even more. Next time I'll try the tomato suggestion.

I used canned albacore in water so I had to add some extra virgin olive oil (about 1/4 cup.) I didn't have fresh basil, so I used fresh rosemary then added capers, and a little cracked black pepper and served it all over bowtie pasta. It was delicious and so very easy. I'll definately add this to my "make often" list.

This was a great weeknight dinner. It'll be even better over the summer when I have fresh basil. I used 1 tsp dried basil and 1/4 cup olive oil since I only had water packed tuna.

Yum! I added watercress and dried dill, with pleasing results... unfortunately had to use dried basil. Next time, I'll use fresh, and add capers (though probably not with the dill?), and try angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti, so the flavors will soak in more. Maybe a tad more lemon. Also, I only had water-packed tuna, so I had to add a little olive oil. Worked fine at first, but the leftovers ended up rather dry.

I absolutely love this recipe, which I've made twice, once with thin spaghetti and once with the penne pasta. I also tried substituting pesto when I couldn't get fresh basil. This is one of those dishes that I can remember the taste of -- high praise indeed!

Absolutely wonderful meal...as others had mentioned, I added a chopped tomato (just *had* to, since the basil was in there!). Also used the "little ears" pasta, though I'd probably go for something even smaller. I thought it was incredibly tasty and refreshing for hot weather. A definite keeper!

Rating: 3
An excellent light summer dish--and so quick and easy to make! Since everything but the pasta is at room temperature, the dish is warm, not hot, and not as heavy as you might expect pasta to be. I used canned Italian tuna in olive oil, far superior to regular tuna in oil and available in most supermarkets. And instead of penne pasta, I used orecchiette--"tiny ears"--which caught little chunks of tuna and lemon zest and basil in them, instead of it falling to the bottom of the pot. Any shell type pasta would work. This simple, delicious dish will definitely become a regular at our house.

I really enjoyed this - it was very light and fresh. I used a can of tuna with basil and pine nuts included - the pine nuts were a great addition!

Rating: 2
Good idea, but needs significant work! I would start by using a thinner pasta, like spaghetti, because there is not enough to the sauce to warrant such a thick pasta -- all you taste is the penne! Furthermore, I added capers to liven it up, and fresh Parmesan for richness... I would have also added tomato, but didn't have any on hand. I like lots of fresh herbs, so I wouldn't hold back on adding even more basil, and garlic, to help bolster the flavor. It also needed quite a bit of s&p. After such great reviews, I was more than a little disappointed, but after making numerous recipes from this site, I should know that it takes your own taste buds to truly know what tastes good!

I ground dried lemon peel, dried basil, white & blk peppercorns, and salt together (didn't have lemons or fresh basil). Put spices in olive oil, garlic, bottled lemon juice, tuna (in water, drained) and sauteed. Topped with freshly grated parmesan. Family loved it.

Rating: 2
This was good, but as someone who doesn't use a lot of fresh herbs I would cut back on the basil and use a garlic press instead of mincing the garlic. This was very quick and easy and for that I will tinker with the herbs and make it again.
