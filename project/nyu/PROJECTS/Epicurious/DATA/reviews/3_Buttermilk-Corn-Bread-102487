I love cornbread. Yellow or white cornmeal, doesn't matter to me. What I DON'T like is sugar in my cornbread. If I want to add something sweet it's honey or jam on top after it's baked and cut into lovely squares. I also love this recipe for my cornbread dressing.

This recipe, as written, is ever so slightly dry. It is a good foundation for tweaking though. Not sure whether to add another tablespoon of butter or a bit more buttermilk.

I'm searching for a recipe to replicate the lost recipe for my mother's cornbread. This one looked about right. I made two batches. For the first one, I followed the recipe exactly. The batter looked wrong to me - too stiff. That pan of cornbread was too dry for my taste. For the next batch (which I made before tasting the first batch), I added an additional 1/3 cup of buttermilk. The second batch was much better than the first, texture-wise, but it was a bit too bland for my taste. The next time I make this, I'll add a bit more salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. I'll also add some grated cheese, or pickled jalapenos, or crispy bacon pieces. I thought this was a good basic recipe, but I'm still tinkering with it.

A good recipe for decent, unsweetened, unembellished cornbread, which was exactly what I was looking for. Not too dry.

As a child, I often visited my Grandmother, who lived in Kentucky, and this was exactly the way she made Buttermilk Corn Bread. Always with buttermilk and no sugar! I have never understood why the majority of people prefer a sweet corn bread. To really put this recipe over the top, I use a 12 inch cast iron skillet that I warm in the oven with a film of canola oil on the bottom. This will create a beautiful brown crust and will also be great as a turkey stuffing. Yumm!

As other reviewers have said, this was simple, homey, and hit the spot with good chili. If you're not into sugary, yellow cornbreads, the is the perfect recipe. If you bake this in a 10" skillet as we did, reduce the temp to 350*F and check it after 25 minutes

Follwed the recipe exactly and the outcome was perfect (at least according to my cornbread experiences as a southerner!). Simple and tasty and just moist enough to not crumble to pieces. This is no frills, original cornbread.

Made this again except this time I added 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. hot pepper flakes and about a cup or so of grated cheese. Yum.......

This is a typical non-sweet cornbread recipe. My dyed-in-the-wool-Suth'n husband insists that adding sugar to cornbread is sacrilege, and thought this recipe was perfect. If you're looking for a sweeter recipe, try one of the others...but this one is great for the "true" cornbread fans.

Not very good. Dry cornbread and the taste of baking soda/baking powder was evident in the bread. I'm used to sweeter, more cake-like cornbread.

I love this recipe. The cornbread came out light and not sweet. I added 1/2tsp sage or a chopped jalapeno pepper. It's easy to prepare and taste simply delicious!!!

This was very bland -- like eating a handful of yellow dirt. I tried adding sugar, but it wasn't really worth it.

This is pretty good, but seems to be a little greasy. Though I don't like cutting fat out of recipes, this one is honestly a little better with a couple of tablespoons less butter, a little more buttermilk, and a couple of egg beaters. I also add sugar. It goes well with chili, and is super easy to make.

This is a wonderful addition to a steaming bowl of chile! Also, I find it quite enjoyable to add some small bits of chopped red and yellow crinkle cut jalapeno peppers, you know, the pickled kind you can buy by the bottle. Just don't add too many...you won't believe the result the next day! Ha Ha! All in all, one of the best recipes I've found for cornbread...hmmmmm, wonder what it would be like to create stuffing with? Now where did I leave that Turkey?
