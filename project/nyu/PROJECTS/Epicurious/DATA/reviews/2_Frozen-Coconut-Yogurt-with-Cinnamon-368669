Outstanding. Smooth, creamy, rich-tasting---yet refreshing---and just sweet enough. Pretty with a mint leaf garnish. Easy. I used Fage 2% yogurt and 1/2 tablespoon of NuNaturals NuStevia White Stevia Powder. Next time I am going to triple the coconut milk and the coconut extract. Also, I might toast the coconut and sprinkle it on top of the frozen yogurt instead of mixing it in. I am sure we can all think of variations to fit different menus and different tastes. This recipe is a winner.
