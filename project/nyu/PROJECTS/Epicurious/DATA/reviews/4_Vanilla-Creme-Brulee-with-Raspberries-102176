I love creme brulee so much and have made it so many times, I consider myself somewhat of a creme brulee connoisseur. The raspberry jam completely overpowered the delicacy of the vanilla bean (I used the expensive Thatian beans and it was totaly lost in this dish). The jam spread through the crust and made it look a bit unattractive; a red marbling affect. To me, it tasted like a bowl of raspberry jam top with a custard. The sugar crust just made it more sickeningly sweet. I will stick with my basic vanilla creme brulee and add raspberries on top.

I made the creme brulee minus the raspberries and found the recipe to be quite easy but somewhat lacking. I was looking for something creamy and light and instead got something more in the custard family. Subtracting an egg as another reviewer suggested might help. Still searching for the perfect creme brulee recipe

I am fourteen, and I absolutely ADORE Creme Brulee, as does my father. I made this for my family on a night that we had extra egg yolks. I omitted the raspberry jam and raspberries entirely. Contrary to most people, I loved the brown sugar, and it worked beautifully. I also couldn't find vanilla bean, and regret it, but it was fabulous anyway. I might have baked it maybe a minute longer, but that's the only change I would make. Also, I found that you only really have to chill it for about half an hour after going in the broiler.

If you leave out the fruit and preserves, the ratio of this creme brulee is perfect: 1 serving = 1 egg yolk + 1 tablespoon of sugar + 1/4 cup of whipping cream. If you have any thought of skimping, choosing vanilla bean over vanilla extract is akin to choosing aged cheddar over processed cheese. For the ramekins I use, I will normally make 10 servings to fill 8 ramekins. As for the fruit, I'm of the opinion that raspberries don't really work. If I add fruit during cooking, I'd rather have something a little firmer like peaches or mangos. In truth though, the best accompaniment for a nice vanilla creme brulee is a little desert wine served very cold.

Totally satisfying. A few comments and recommendations: 1. I chose to use white sugar on top, and would do that again for simple clean taste. 2. Friends brought torch, and one recommended a thinner layer of sugar on the surface. Thus we got to compare, and all agreed that thinner was preferable. 1 tsp seemed right -- tap/shake dish to get it to cover evenly. Cracking through to get to custard was still 100% satisfying, and thicker disk both too sweet and a bit more difficult to work with while eating. 3. I preferred seedless all-fruit preserves, and next time will heat it first to get a scant Tblsp to cover bottom of the dish evenly. This will likely help the taste of the fresh berries to predominate and may also prevent runniness. 4. For one friend's fond memories of a best-ever crème brulee, I put thick shavings (aka thin slices?) of dark chocolate in the custard. That worked beautifully. 5. Last but not least, served with berry sauce from "Crème Brulee with Berries" from this site. Half of us loved that extra kick of berries, half thought it overwhelmed the pure pleasure of the lovely rich custard. However, I think the custard in that recipe would be too sweet. The 6 Tblsp of sugar in this recipe is spot on. Enjoy!

Easy recipe and a delicious resulting brulee, but too thick and firm for our taste due to the large number of eggs versus volume of creme.

These turned out fabulous! I switched out the raspberry jam for blackberry jam and fresh blackberries on top only... exceptional! I also agree with the comment below that the jam causes a strange separation and I only chilled them for about 5 hours instead of over night. But any flaws got covered up by the brulee anyway. :)

These turned out wonderfully, even though I made so many changes. No berries, no jam - I just wanted to use my new vanilla beans. Got four deeper ramekins. Many of the vanilla beans sank to the bottom - not sure why. Final result: my svelte valentine said, "If you made these everyday, I would eat them everyday and weigh 500 pounds and be totally happy." Good enough for me!

I've never made creme brulee before this recipe... and it was fantastic. My ramekins were much shallower than the raspberries themselves, so I put down a tiny bit of jam, threw in just 3 berries a piece, and smashed them down slightly. I used a torch and kept reapplying sugar to the areas with berries just under the surface and simply kept torching it until it hardened. It was no big deal. My friends raved!

Even with only 6 egg yolks the finish was heavier than I expected, perhaps I will split the cream with milk next time. I too only yielded 5 portions.

I ended up baking mine in oven about 10 minutes longer than the recipe recommends in order to get the proper consistency. The brown sugar burned too much in the broiler, making them look unappetizing, so I just took off the hardened sugar and drizzled chocolate ganache on top instead, which turned out fabulous!

Very nice texture. I subbed pure maple syrup for the sugar (equally). Perfectly sweet, nice subtle maple flavor. P.S.: I got my vanilla beans at vanilla harvest dot com. Cheaper than my supermaret.

This recipe was very simple and very delicious! I din't use the raspberry's. Instead I made plain vanilla creme brulee. It really does help to have a kitchen torch to brown the tops.

This is an excellent basic recipe for creme brulee - not too custardy and not too thin. The jam is to ensure the raspberries stick to the bottom - a nice surprise if you don't know it's coming when you spoon into it, but I have made it many times without (the berries float) and it's still wonderful. Like so many others, I use white sugar, as it seems to come out better (and I use a hand torch).

Although I have never made creme brulee before, I have eaten it alot. So has my 8 year old daughter. When she told me she wanted to make it at home, I selected this recipe to try. My daughter did most of the work herself (honestly) and it came out great! The raspberries, jam, and vanilla seeds added the special flair we were looking for, and our whole family loved the result. I have to believe this recipe is almost foolproof, although we did bake it longer than suggested (about 48 minutes) and use white sugar instead of brown under the broiler.

I took just the basic creme brulee/custard recipe (everything except the raspberry jam, raspberries and brown sugar). Instead of making the topping from brown sugar I used regular or superfine white sugar. The basic recipe is so incredible - everytime I make it, my guests rave. And, it is so,so,so easy!

This creme brulee's texture is wonderful, but the raspberries and jam do not improve on the traditional creme brulee recipe. The seeds in the jam -- only a smidgen did I use -- are bothersome. I made half the recipe and used very tiny metal molds. Still the creme brulee did not half fill the molds. To fill three custard cups one needs to make an entire recipe. I'll stick to my usual creme brulee recipe and save the raspberries for another delicious dessert from this site.

Whoops... reviewed the wrong berry brulee earlier. THIS is the recipe I loved-- so much easier than most and very delicious. I used vanilla extract and a tsp. of jam in each ramekin and the consistency was great, although I did leave it in a bit longer than the recipe suggested. One tip-- use WHITE sugar on the top, not brown. In an experiment with lt. brown, white, and turbinado sugars, I found that white is by far the easiest to work with and makes the most pleasing, crisp caramel--lt. brown was the worst! It caught fire and puffed into a black crisp much like a marshmallow does and turbinado didn't melt readily... nb--I used a small torch purchased from the plumbing area of Wal-mart (skip the 50 dollar "creme brulee torches"!) to caramelize the tops, and it worked beautifully!

Great. Loved the fresh vanilla bean (though it sank somewhat to the bottom of the custards). I used a raspberry coulis instead of jam and omitted the fresh berries in the custard (put them on top instead). Definitely going to make this again. Also cooked the custards for 48 minutes... they hadn't set yet at 40.

I made this without the jam/raspberries ... it came out a very yellow creme brulee - delicious!! Possibly could reduce the egg yolks by one. Mine also took a lot longer to cook, but that was because my ramikins were large - so it only made 3 servings.

Following other reviewer's comments, I only brushed a bit of rasberry jam on the bottom of each ramekin and omitted the whole berries, and we found this to be incredible.

I love making this because guests always say it's the best creme brulee they've ever had. However, I do make a few changes. I leave out the raspberry bottom, only making the actual creme brulee portion of the dish, topping with the carmelized sugar and the traditional few raspberries and mint for garnish. DELICIOUS!

Made the creme brulee alone and served fresh raspberries on the side. Easier and faster than other recipes for creme brulee that require you to cook it on the stovetop before placing it in the oven, but just as good, if not better. Refrigerating it overnight definitely made it richer and creamier. (I must admit that I ate one early :)) Will make this recipe again and again.

had a nice taste but the custard was not nearly as smooth as others we've made. Custard needs to be strained after mixing. Also tasted a little too eggy for us. try the black and white creme brulee recipe on this site instead.

Excellent egg custard base but the jam made it too sweet. The raspberries also made it a little soggy so it was harder to harden the sugar. Next time I will just add another egg yold to make the custard firmer, maybe that will lessen the raspberry juice. Other than that, it was a nice recipe with a good idea.

I made a version of this with raspberry jam and blackberries on top. The nicest part was that when you torch the sugar the berries that poke out the top of the cream get a bit crunchy. I substituted vanilla bean paste for the bean and tasted just as yummy.

This is an impressive dessert to serve for a special occasion meal. Best part is that you can make it a day ahead. I have made this quite a few times, with some variations each time. One time, the price of fresh berries was incredibly high, so I just used the jam. That was very good as well. Another time, I couldn't find the vanilla bean so I just used extract, that worked just as well. Every time I have served it, I've gotten rave reviews.

This is an extremely easy creme brulee recipe. I've made it several times, and everyone loves it. Using small raspberries cuts down on the chance that it becomes watery. I also used a little less raspberry preserves at the bottom. The recipe is better suited for 4 servings, however. It is easily doubled.

This is also a great recipe for standard creme brulee (no raspberries or brown sugar.) Just follow everything but the fruit and sugar part. The only adjustment that really needs to be made though is that 6tbs of sugar is too much. You can cut it down to 4 - 4-1/2.

i had very high hopes for this recipe, but it wasn't quite what i expected. the recipe definitely made 4 creme brulees rather than 6. i wasn't very fond of the the jam and rasberries at the bottom. it was very pretty and a nice surprise, but the flavors and texture didn't quite go together. i used seedless rasberry preserves, and it was much too tart and sweet. we ended up eating around it... trying to get as much creme as we could and leaving the rasberry stuff alone. i don't intend to make this again, but my suggestion to those who would like to try it out would be to use the jam VERY sparingly -maybe just brush the bottom with it. i let the jam and rasberries sit out for a few hours to "dry" a little, and did not have any problems with wateriness. i believe i will be sticking to the classic from now on.

under a student budget cooking for a lot of people, i skipped the fresh raspberries and opted instead for raspberry preserves...

Quick and easy to make, especially for a dinner party because so much of it you make ahead of time. I used blueberries and blueberry jam instead of raspberries and I like that since there weren't any little "seeds" to get stuck in your teeth and the flavor was remarkable! Also, my ramekins were a little deeper and so it the custard ended up being a little too shallow. Next time I think I'll make only 4 for dinner or just increase the recipe for 6. But everyone loved it and I got rave reviews, and I'm no cook!

My sister and I made this dessert in our tiny apartment along with a huge turkey dinner. We had no room to cook them in the oven so we put the tray of brulee on the barbeque to cook them! They worked! Just make sure you moniter the temp. Then we broiled the *&^%$# out of them and they set on fire, but we took the layer of burnt sugar off the top and they were STILL excellent! These were incredibly easy and delicious! We thought the fresh raspberries were perfect, not watery, but we washed them then set them on paper towel to dry off a bit...Bon Apetit!

I have been searching for a creme brulee recipe ever since I had my first vanilla creme brulee in San Francisco. This recipe tops the restaraunt version by a long shot, probably because I love raspberries. I made this with friends in a cooking class, so we didn't have the chill time, but it was just as delectible as I remember it. I even shared this with a friend who doesn't like custard, and he asked for the recipe!

Made some with the brown sugar topping using my torch rather than the broiler. Tried one without the brown sugar brulee. My husband and I agreed that plain is better, as the raspberry jam added enough sweetness. Also, the fresh raspberries inside had begun to liquify by the time I served them, so I think next time I will make the creme early in the day and serve them that evening rather than chilling overnight. This was a nice departure from the typical vanilla or egg flavored custards that I usually make, and just as easy.

This was excellent but VERY sweet. Next time, I would cut back on the jam. One little dilemma I had was that I used a shallower yet wider ramekin so the rasberries very slightly peeked out.
