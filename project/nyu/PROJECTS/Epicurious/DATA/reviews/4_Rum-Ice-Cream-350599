Great recipe just the way it is. I did a slight modification: I used maple liquor and only put 1/2C brown sugar. Amazing! Doesn't freeze rock hard due to the alcohol. And to answer the other reviewer, whisk the sugar and eggs till it's mixed, and whisk the egg mixture by not holding the bowl. Just don't go all crazy vigorous.

I LOVED this recipe - used it during one of my baking finals when I was making a deconstructed strawberry daiquiri dessert. Based on all of the reviews saying it was very strong, I used 2 oz of rum, and 2/3 oz lime juice (2.67 oz = 1/3 cup). I also omitted the nutmeg, as it didn't seem to fit with the lime. This got RAVE reviews from my chef, classmates, and family - it was SO awesome!

I simplified the method- wisking eggs well into cold milk and cream, and it worked fine, no need to strain. Also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and soaked 1/2 c raisins in the rum before adding. It was just enough alcohol to prevent the ice cream from freezing too solid, as aoften happens with homemade ice cream. Can't wait to try this recipe with kahlua.

I made this ice cream for Thanksgiving. It is definitely an ice cream for adults. I actually followed the hard copy recipe from the magazine. That recipe calls for 1/2 cup of dark rum. The mixture didn't fully freeze in my ice cream maker. I believe that the large amount of alcohol might have caused that. But it did freeze in the freezer and the texture was fine. I also made the Mexican apple pie. I felt that the ice cream over powered the pie.

Nice consistency and flavor. Great with apple and pecan pies. The rum flavor was a bit stronger than I expected but delicious.

I made this outstanding ice cream for Thanksgiving. I used black strap rum resulting in a strong flavor. The addition of the nutmeg makes it perfect for the holidays! I will make this again and again, in all seasons. A Rum lovers delight!

5 days to go and this yummy ice cream is ready for T-Day! I made this from the recipe in the magazine. Great flavor! Be careful when you lick the spoon -- the rum is potent. A few quibbles with the instructions: Whisk the eggs and brown sugar for how long (until it is fluffy? Until the sugar is dissolved is probably the answer, but should it be more? Should you be careful not to overmix?)? Next: How can you whisk the egg mixture at the same time as pouring the hot milk mixture? (I need two hands to whisk, 1 to hold the bowl, the other to do the whisking). Also, the recipe could include some generic ice-cream- making advice, such as placing a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard when it is cooling, to prevent a skin from forming (although the straining would catch it). And should you place the metal bowl into a bowl with ice water to chill the custard more quickly, or should it cool more slowly? Or maybe the recipe is dummy- proof. I 1) whisked the eggs and sugar forever; 2)put the plastic onto the surface; and 3)chilled the custard before putting it into the refrigerator.
