Very easy but the recipe - as it is written - is super bland. I tripled the zest (and diced up the peel as opposed to just using zest) and seasoned the shrimp a lot. Sprinkling with a cajun seasoning worked great (Zatarains). I also used veg oil for the shrimp but then olive oil for the zucchini and let it slightly caramelize. Lastly, retain a bit of pasta water to add to the finished result - helps bind it all together. Looks like a lot of edits but really just a bit of personalizing and the recipe is great.

We liked it. I bumped up the zucchini and used less pasta to make it a little lower carb. Health reasons. Will make this again.

This is pretty good, I added a tomato (I know purists, I know but I'd had a similar dish with baby zucchini and local cherry tomatoes at a neighborhood restaurant). Kept the pasta very al dente since it would cook more in the pan, and being wary of the sequencing added some lemon zest to the shrimp. The spouse, quite a pasta stickler, went back for seconds. Need to figure out how to mix all the ingredients in my saute pan, ended up with layers of shrimp then pasta, bigger pan next time.

good, easy recipe for when you're in the mood for pasta with shrimp. I made this with fresh pasta.

This sounded better than it was! The pasta was dry, the zucchini was over cooked and the sauce had very little taste. The only thing worth mentioning was the shrimp.

Made it last night for my hubby who is not especially fond of veggies; loved it, its much better served at room temp.

This was extremely easy and a perfect summer dish that is also delicious served chilled the following day. I will devein AND peel the shrimp next time. I also used more garlic and lemon zest than was called for. At first I was questioning this recipe a lot. Especially the order of things. Putting the garlic in after the zuccini seemed backwards to me, and the same with the shrimp and garlic. The fact is by doing it in the order the recipe called for allowed the individual flavors of the Shrimp, the garlic and pasta, and the zuccini to be more pronounced. And the lemon zest and basil just tied everything together. Must use high quality fresh ingredients. Delicious

This was a big hit at our house! We made this with fresh pasta (always the best way to go), doubled the garlic and the lemon zest added the special something every recipe needs.
