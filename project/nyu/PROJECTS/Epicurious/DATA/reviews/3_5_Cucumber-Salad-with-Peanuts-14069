Tasty but unexceptional. I had it with the vegetable summer rolls and bangkok salad on this site. It all went well together. I think it lacked the vinegar bite of cucumber salads I've had at Thai restaurants. Next time I'll try replacing some of the rice vinegar with regular vinegar.

This is really quite good but I found it simply didn't go well with the stuffed red peppers I had prepared as the entree'. The flavors of the cucumber salad were simply too strong for the peppers. I did use cilantro as others suggested. I started with a fairly large serrano pepper but it was pretty mild so I grabbed a jalapeno which (amazingly) was hotter. The two of them together were perfect. I didn't have any seasoned rice vinegar, so I used regular rice vinegar with a tsp of sugar. It was fine but possibly different flavor from that intended. Rather than just "salted" peanuts, I used some "Planters Heat Peanuts" which we really love and had purchased at a truck stop and which have a lot of hot pepper. I chopped them up very finely and simply sprinkled them over the salad. That way the peanuts were crisp and I can serve the cucumber salad again later without soggy peanuts lurking inside! I guess this will go with Indian food better than the more pedestrian stuffed red peppers.

For something easy, simple and prepared at the last minute, this dish was tasty. I used Thai chili paste instead of the jalapeno for a bit of spice. I've been trying to cook more simply without sacrificing taste and this salad passes the test.

Nothing terribly special, in my opinion. Simple and easy to make, but the flavors were bland and very vinegary as is. Could use some tweaking as recommended by others. I would change the following: Use a spicier pepper (even with seeds, the jalep didn't do much), less vinegar, ground peanuts, cashews and pecan blend rather than chopped--it would coat the salad easier.

Very quick and easy to make. Made a nice side dish with grilled glazed salmon. I added fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice, which improved the flavor.

Fantastic. Add the cilantro and you've got an outstanding side dish to go with a thai curry

4 forks because it's easy, interesting and a great use of the fruit of an overactive cucumber plant. I kicked it up a notch with a serrano pepper instead of the jalapeno called for. I've also made it with chopped walnuts. And as long as I go a little easy on the vinegar, even the cuc-hating boyfriend likes it.

My guests really enjoyed it. It is light and simple. I made sure to remove all seeds and veins from the jalepeno peppers, so it wouldn't be too hot. And it wasn't very hot at all. I put more peanuts in than what the recipe asked for, just because it added such a nice crunch. Yum.

What could be simpler? I did only use 1/2 pepper and it was plenty-also waited til last minute to throw the nuts in. Cold, refreshing, and healthy.

I've made this recipe several times since it came out. I make it just as written and it is perfect. I'm always looking for interesting salads. This has given me new interest in cucumbers.

Simple and different. Love the crunch. I used cilantro instead of jalapeno. By the time I served the dish, they had softened. I wasn't crazy about the soft nuts, but the guests raved. I think toss in the nuts at the last minute.

Refreshing, delicious - serve very cold. Takes 60 sec with the Cuisinart slicer attachment; no need to seed an English cucumber. Could leve out the jalapeno for a child-friendly, all-purpose salad, or add cilantro and lime for an Asian meal.

This is very tasty and easy. It is quite similar to the little salads that usually come with satay appetizers in Thai restaurants. I think it would make a refreshing accompaniment to any Indian or Asian dish that is spicy.

I added some cilantro, lime juice and a splash of balsamic vinegar - it was a refreshing treat for an afternoon barbeque!

Very simple. A great spacer between appetizer and main course.

I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the vinegar and roasted the peanuts. Absolutely delicious!
