Like others, I doubled the spices and let the chicken marinate a bit before roasting. I put the chicken on a bed of red potato wedges in addition to the onions. The dish turned out really well! It needed a bit longer to cook, but I think that's because I was working with a pretty large chicken (over 5 lbs).

This was a great dish. I added a bit of cumin and substituted chili for cayenne. All eaters involved were satisfied.

This is one of the most exciting dishes I have ever made. I followed the recipe pretty closely using only chicken legs and quadrupling the recipe for a crowd. The brilliant secret of this recipe is what 500 degrees does to paprika on chicken skin. It also makes the tips of the onion strips toasty. The dish packs a bit of a punch with the cayenne but every person in the group had seconds. The cinnamon adds a middle Eastern flair and at 500 degrees the spices meld into something unexpected and exquisite. Kudos to Ian Knauer.

This was good. I doubled the spices and evoo and I do recommend letting it marinate for a white. I butterflied a chicken and cooked it skin side up for 50 minutes on 375. This is good, not exceptional as everyone writes but a welcome change to my normal roasted chicken. It is great complimented by sweet potatoes. I'll make it again.

Like everyone else, I doubled the spices. I also allowed to chicken to marinate in the olive oil/spice mixture for a few hours before roasting, and laid the chicken pieces on a bed of yukon potatoes and vidalia onions. Delicious, and just as good as leftovers the next day!

This recipe is so good- it's quick, easy, and full of flavor. The combination of spices is a great change from more "traditional" chicken recipes (i.e. lemon, garlic, herbs). The one and only thing I do differently is add more olive oil, so the spread goes a little further. This has definitely become a staple in my kitchen!

Pretty yummy. I have a boy sensitive to spicyness, so I omitted the cayenne. I did add a bit of honey, and he ate it up.

I made this last week when my 17 yr old nephew who is picky poor eater came for dinner. I made enough for us to have leftovers...no such luck. Nephew cleaned the platter. I made it again this evening with some variation. Wanted a one dish supper. Cut up yukon gold potatoes, carrots and sliced some garlic. Tossed with the onions and chicken. Baked for 30 minutes at 500. Another positive meal.

I followed suggestions of using honey and doubling the spices & olive oil. The sweet onions were flavorful, but I shredded the chicken for salad instead. I don't think I will make this again.

Made this the other night. Doubled the spices, as suggested by many, then marinated the chicken parts in the rub for a few hours before cooking. Because I was using the same oven for Roasted Green Beans and Cashews, I lowered the temp to 475 and baked for about 45 minutes (to keep the beans from charring). It was moist and tasty. My family loved it. Next time, Ill probably toss chicken pieces in the dry spices since the oil made it a little gloppy and difficult to spread evenly. I might add some other flavor like molasses or honey as suggested, and maybe a pinch of garlic, as well. This was fantastic served with couscous and the roasted green beans.

Rating: 3
I read the reviews before making, and possibly because of this I like this recipe a lot. I tossed the onions (and added yams as per one very smart reviewer) in the spice mixture then smeared the remaining mixture over the chicken. It's also very good with cumin substituted for the cinnamon.

I made this dish exactly according to the recipe. Very tasty and flavorful. I would not want any more kick, though, but it is just right. I served it with relatively "blander" sides (brussels sprouts w/walnuts, basmati rice with toasted vermicelli) because of that. The onions are wonderful--wish I added 2X. Reminds me of Tandoori chicken. . .Anyone else?

Made for dinner tonight and it was delish! I did modify slightly - doubled the spice and added honey. Also added sweet potato wedges. I increased the cook time to 30 min at 500 and 20 min at 450 - I did cook 4 lbs of chicken, two sweet potatoes, and a large sweet onion. I will definitely make this again. It was easy and so good! Even company good!

Very easy and good, not great. I incorporated many changes suggested here--more oil, more cinnamon--and I used boneless, skinless thighs and a sweet Spanish paprika--smoky and great with the cinnamon. I found the favor a little overbearing; I served it with a raw kale salad and that broke the monotony, but next time I'll make a yogurt-cilantro raita too.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. We also tried it on our smoker grill...even better than in the oven! I added a bit more cayenne since my family enjoys spicy food.

Be careful: this recipe is so paprika heavy, and paprikas vary wildly in taste and strength. I used some amazing Spanish Paprika (dolce) and it was way, way too strong. The dish bordered on inedible and was too bitter, even though I added about 1T of honey as others suggested. I wish Gourmet would be savvy enough to specify which paprika to use, especially given its status as a vogue ingredient.

Rating: 3
I used 1.6lb of chicken thighs for this recipe and didn't alter the amount of spices or oil. I also laid the chicken on top of yam wedges in the pan to get a veggie in there. Since I was adding the veggie I altered the temp and time a little bit. I cooked the dish for 30 minutes on 350 and then another 20 minutes on 400 to crisp the skin, all of it in the center of the oven. This dish was fantastically flavorful and yams were delicious as an accompaniment . I loved how quick and easy it was to make. I'll be making it again often.

Really, really good and an excellent weeknight meal. I had some really good, fresh paprika from the Spice House so that helped a lot. The onions are almost better than the chicken! I cut the breast pieces in half so they would be the same size as the thighs and legs.

This is one of the easiest recipes you can make. I would give it 4 forks because it's so good for such little work, but it's (mainly)just chicken and onions so I save the Exceptional ratings for something more special but this was delicious and I will definitely make this again. I was a little nervous if my husband would like the paprika and even myself the cinnamon but we both loved it. I did add a dollop of honey as suggested and left out the cayenne simply because I'm not a fan. I thought it was super flavorful. I did use Hungarian paprika.

Rating: 4
I'm giving this dish a full 4 forks considering how absolutely easy this is to make. For those who said this had no flavor; was bland, etc- toss the old stale spices. As previously mentioned- if you use good quality spices, your palate will be pleased. I am an Indian food lover, so I was a bit sceptical about whether this dish would have enough flavor. That being said, I used the full amounts of spices (it's not too spicy so don't fear the 1/2 t of cayenne) along with 2 TBS olive oil and a dash of honey as others suggested and voila: super easy and tasty dish that took 5 minutes to prepare. I am making it for the 2nd time right now.

Blechh-- Bland, bland, bland. Added the extra oil and honey. The chicken was moist but had absolutely no flavor at all, just a little heat from the cayenne.

I didn't have a sweet onion--I used 2 small yellow onions instead--and made no other changes to the recipe. I didn't have any particularly special paprika or cinnamon either (truth be told, my poor cinnamon had probably been hanging around for two years). I loved this chicken--it browned nicely, and had a lovely smoky-sweet-spicy flavor. I suppose I'd cut down a little on the cayenne if I were going to make this for my small children. I loved the way the onions turned brown and a little burnt and crispy. Can't beat the amount of time it takes to throw this together, either.

The key to this dish is using a high-quality paprika. run-of-the-mill, grocery store spice aisle paprika just won't have the intensity this dish requires. So many people have tins of "spices" sitting in their pantries for years. Dried and ground spices and herbs fizzle out after awhile. I "toasted" my paprika before mixing it to bring out even more flavor.

We enjoyed this a great deal! We did use less cayenne (which gave plenty of spice) and added honey as one reviewer suggested.

Oh - and we marinated the onions, too - while prepping the roasted green bean dish! worked out well!

I read the reviews and thought to modify, taking some ideas from others who posted. I 2x olive oil, added a dollop of honey, used only 1/4 tsp cayenne. Also - I had the onions marinade for 45 minutes with the ingredients prior to adding to the chicken. It worked out perfectly.

I had the same experience as the reviewer who mentioned the sledge hammer. My spices were intense, but I agree that it lacked finesse. The cayenne was very overpowering. I will reduce it next time, and add more oil as others have suggested. Otherwise, the chicken was moist and delicious. I also made the roasted green beans with cashews - fantastic.

I had an almost 6# chicken and needed to double the sauce recipe.Sauce seemed too thick to use as I wanted, so I tripled the oil, and doubled the rest. We grilled the chicken on indirect heat, putting the large breast pieces on 20 min before the rest. It worked great; the flavor was terrific

Intriguing mixture of spices; the cinnamon and cayenne combination was amazing! -- delicious but not one was overwhelming. I followed the recipe exactly in terms of the spices but used all chicken thighs rather than a chicken cut-up. Perfect with white rice and a side salad (easy to make while the chicken is roasting). DELICIOUS and EASY!! Definitely a keeper.

Made this last night and it was fantastic! I doubled all the ingredients, including the cayenne. Even tho it was spicy, the heat didn't stay. I also removed the skin to cut down on fat (plus I don't like the texture of baked chicken skin). The flavors reached through the chicken and gave it a wonderful flavor throughout. Will I make this again? Absolutely!

Made this last night, only change being a bit more olive oil for better coverage. It was good, though the flavor had no finesse. Sort of like being hit over the head with a sledge hammer. I don't know, maybe a bit less cayenne or pepper might improve it.. Chicken was perfectly cooked and the onions were great. Not sure if I'd make it again.

I also increased the oil, used different chicken parts and halved the cayenne, increasing the amount after tasting -- was completely happy with the results and loved that it was so easy. However, the recipe was confusingly written in that the salt and pepper are not in the ingredients list, but instead below in the preparation instructions; I almost overlooked it myself. The inadvertent omission of salt my have caused bland results for some.

Made with skinless boneless breasts & thighs. 425 for about 45 minutes. Not very pretty, but it was delicious. I did pour off fat from pan and thicken to make a small amount of sauce to pour over.

Absolutely delicious flavors, beautiful on the plate and exciting for the palette! I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken, and roasted it at 425 for 45 mins, as I didn't want the onions to burn.

I made this as written, with the green bean/cashew dish on the side, with the exception of one small change: smoked paprika. After finishing two helpings and scraping up all of the little bits from the pan, my husband declared the meal a prize-winner. It gets three forks for being quick, easy, and delicious.

Used boneless/skinless breasts instead of the whole chicken. I made it as written although I halved the cayenne and it was quite spicy. Also, as written the spices are a thick paste that sticks to the meat in clumps. Next time, I'll use even less cayenne (just a pinch) and double the olive oil. I really liked it the first time, but I think with those small changes it will be even better. Served with the roast green beans and plain couscous, both complemented the chicken wonderfully.
