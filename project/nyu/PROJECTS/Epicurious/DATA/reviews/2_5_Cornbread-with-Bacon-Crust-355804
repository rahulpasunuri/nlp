This is my go to cornbread recipe. I always cut it in half and it works fine. I, too wish it were a bit moister but love the flavors. The crust on top is pretty and delicious!

I found that this recipe turned out very well and it was a huge hit. I cut down the amount of bacon but I would use the full 10 slices next time. The major change that I made was to add 1/2 cup aged cheddar to the batter. Cheddar cornbread is an old family favorite from a Paul Prudhomme recipe. The cheese adds flavor and moisture. Excellent recipe and simple to prepare.

This was ok, nothing fabulous. The bacon was a nice touch and went down well with the boys, but the actual cornbread was a little dry.

I was 98% totally pleased with this recipe. I, too, wish that it was a little bit moister. The flavor was great and I would totally make this again!

The bacon on top was interesting but the corbread itself was average. It wasn't moist enough and I don't think the whole corn added any benefit.

Very moist and flavorful. Great comfort food. The recipe serves 12 to 16 people. I'm going to cut it in half and see if it freezes well.

actually.... many, many cornbread recipes call for sugar, honey, or any other type of sweetner. I really liked this cornbread - the salty flavor of the bacon combines well with the rest of the recipe. I think the previous reviewer should maybe MAKE the recipe then comment. I have other recipes that like better - but this was yummy and a good change.

No sugar in cornbread. For god's sake, corn is already sweet!
