Although vague and poorly written, this recipe yields a fantastic pie! We loved it, and plan on making it again for Thanksgiving. It's just the right amount of sweetness from the maple syrup and subtly tangy from the butter milk. A great consistency. You have to read in between the lines and know a thing or two about baking in order to make this work, but it's well worth it!

I made this recipe because I had leftover buttermilk and maple sugar that had been sitting in my cupboard forever. I didn't have enough maple syrup for the recipe, so I covered the difference with honey. My maple sugar is very coarse, so I dissolved it in the maple syrup over the stove first, and I'm really glad I did - it took several minutes for it to dissolve so I know it wouldn't have done so on its own in the oven. I was very pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this pie. It's just got a nice tang and sweetness, but not too much of either. If you're just in the mood to make a simple pie, this was really good.

This is a terrible recipe. The cooked pie formed two distinct layers; a gelatinous top layer with a dense, tasteless, curdled custard-like layer on the botton. I bake for a living and still could not make this recipe work. Keep searching for a good maple pie recipe; this isn't it!

Tastes like a sophisticated butterscotch. Had to bake for 75 minutes. Plan on topping with whipped cream or meringue as I had flecks of egg yolk all over the top of the finished product. Really tasty though.

I had to bake this about 10 minutes longer than the recipe specified, but it came out perfect and was a hit at Thanksgiving. It held up well for leftovers the next day. Nice seasonal flavors and I will definitely make it again. It's nice to have something a little different than the usual pies and this was a nice change of pace.

A great pie for Thanksgiving. Got rave reviews. Took a lot longer than the 55 minutes to set however.

I'm amazed that this isn't breaking on people. I would like to try this as a flan with no crust, but cooking the custard first.

Hate to say it was a waste of good maple syrup

A fabulous recipe - definitely going to become a regular part of the fall dessert repetoire! However, a separate step should be in there to mix up the flour with some of the liquid so as to avoid flour lumps. Add maple extract for a little extra oomph!

Unbelievably delicious! I took out the time to make the crust, and used the merangue(sp?)on top, as someone suggested. Definitly a keeper

Wonderful! I used a 9" premade crust and added maple pecans on top during the last 10 minutes of baking - yum!

Delicious! I was too busy to make a crust, so I made it without one in a 10 in pie pan. I whipped the 6 leftover eggwhites into meringue and topped the custard with it the final 15 minutes of baking...sublime!
