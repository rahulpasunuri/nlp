We liked the flavor profile on this dish a lot. However, I had a tough time getting it in and out of the pan in one piece. We wound up with what looked like lumpy scrambled eggs. I'd probably make it again, but not for company.

This was good but not great. I'll make it again because it uses ingredients I often have around the house. An easy weekday meal.

We stayed at this lovely inn a few years ago, and bought the small breakfast cookbook filled with recipes from the husband of the couple who owns the place. I've made this several times, as well as a number of others in the book...you just can't go wrong! Some of them are SO easy, but people think I'm a true gourmet...LOVE that!
