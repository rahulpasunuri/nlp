I fixed this for lunch today and my husband loved it, eating 4 cups with my home made bread; he told me to save the last 2 cups for his supper. I followed advice of some reviewers, but used all organic ingredients; Italian sausage, and 4 cloves of garlic, 5 oz of carrots, 1 cup Moscato wine. I blended 2 cups of vegetables in the blender at the end with 1/2 cup of half and half to make a richer version of the soup. Next time I hope to have fresh caraway rye or pumpernickel bread with this.

No thank you. Bland, dull flavors. Even the caraway couldn't save it. Neither of us even finished a single bowl. Can I have my ingredients back?

This is not a good recipe even if you add onions, garlic and then blend some of the soup. Tasteless and boring.

Tasty. Sauteed some onion and garlic like others. Am going to try pureeing some tomorrow with the leftovers. Used spicy sausage, thought it needed the heat. Also served with a gremolata for a bright touch. Will try adding some of the wine at the end next time, the flavor kind of cooked out. Added some ground caraway for more zing. Served with cheddar-leek scones and chardonnay. Liked the sliced potatoes for something different, used red, white, purple, and yellow. Will try subbing some mustard greens for the kale for more kick next time. Great easy recipe.

A good, quick recipe that can assist in using up the last of a packet of kielbasa sausages. Yes, I used kielbasa from Pastures of Plenty out of Minnesota. I also used Veramonte Sauvignon Blanc which is my standby cooking wine. I did toss in diced onion & minced garlic with the potatoes for added flavor, and I pureed ~1 1/2 cups of the soup in a blender while adding 1/2 cup of fresh heavy cream to enhance the body of the soup. I served this with a mixed green salad topped with sliced beets and Anchovy & Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette and Bon Appetit's Buttery Corn Bread.

i used russets and vermouth for the mere fact that i dont follow instructions, :) as well as adding carrots cut into coins and the sausage i used was a sweet apple and maple variation, SO GOOOOOOD! no caraway since its not in my pantry, but i did use fresh parsley minced as garnish and a pinch of oregano. oh yes, sliced (?) cauliflower YUM YUM YUM

Really challenging recipe. My 12 year old could have thought this up.

Not the prettiest soup; but it's a really tasty soup. I doubled the recipe using turkey kielbasa sausage, omitted the caraway (because I didn't have them) and only used a cup of wine (again that's all I had). Lovely flavours and great comfort food on a gloomy day. Will definitely make this one again.

Loved this dish! Perfect for a cold weather Sunday. I doubled it, and used both kale and mustard leaf, which perfectly complimented the andouille sausage. Yum! This is going in the recipe bank!

You'd think a soup this simple, with so few ingredients, wouldn't turn out well. You'd be wrong! I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, and a diced small onion, while the soup was simmering. I also added some milk at the end, and blended some of the soup to make it creamier. I used cubed creamer potatoes instead of red skinned ones, which worked just fine. I did not have caraway seeds, so I added a drop of Anise extract instead. And since I served the soup with crusty rye bread (which has caraway seeds), I didn't miss the flavor. Overall, so simple and delicious. A winner!

delicious. took the suggestion of adding onion, garlic, and carrot (only a little of each so as not to alter the recipe too severely). and then, because i like a creamier base, when the soup was done, i put about a cup of broth, potato and kale through the blender before adding it back to the pot. we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Delicious just as written (we used fresh lacinato kale). It is exceptionally good - do try this one!

We REALLY enjoyed this soup. Like several others, we added carrots, an onion, and garlic. We doubled the recipe but added a little less kale and potatoes, and a little more sausage than called for. Will definitely make again.

Very easy, very good. No additions necessary, in my opinion - it's simple and perfect the way it is - the wine and stock combination is great. I used mustard greens as there was no kale available - worked fine. I think the caraway seeds are important and wouldn't leave them out if I could help it, but any greens would be fine.

Crazy Good! I'll do this one again. I used Andouille Sausage - and WOW. Intensely flavored sausage is important or the soup will be bland. Added the Carrots and Onions as suggested by other reviewers. Also added a little tomato paste to pick up the acids. Yum! I bet it will be even better tomorrow.

Great recipe. I'd never tried the combination of broth and dry white wine but it was perfect and the soup needed very little salt. I used garlic chicken sausage from trader joe's and omitted the caraway seeds since I didn't have any. Will make this again, 4 forks.

I made the recipe as it calls however I added carrots, garlic, onion, basil, and cayenne pepper. It was hearty, yet healthy with all the vegetables. Instead of crusty country bread, I opted for corn bread to play against the cayenne pepper flavor.

I added carrots and onion, next time I will add garlic as well. Soup was good, but the broth tasted much more flavorful for dinner the next night. Next time I will make a day in advance.

i've made this recipe for years...it's yummy everytime! Do add onion,garlic and carrot...you won't be sorry!

I have to admit that we doctored this a bit, but it was phenomenal none the less. Being vegetarians both, my wife and I used veggie broth instead of chicken and Tofurkey Italian Sausage instead of regular smoked. To compensate for the changes we added an onion and a minced chipotle in adobo to give it the smoky flavour. Sooo good. Making it tonight for the second time in a week.

This is not quite what I expected, but it's quite good. The broth was delicious - i subbed veggie broth for chicken. I cut down a bit on the kale and added a bit more sausage, cutting both the kielbasa and potato slices in half. The caraway seeds added a perfect touch.

Used andouille sausage and threw a shot of tabasco in at the end, otherwise made it as directed. Topped it with a sprinkling of shredded parmesan and served with crusty bread -- it was so good! Shared it with the neighbors, who also loved it.

First serving, made as directed but added crushed red pepper - a-ok. Second serving, cooked a few hours with remnants of an aged gouda. Removed gouda, let cool and pureed. Served warm with a dollop of sour cream and paprika - sooooooooo GOOD.

The broth is key. We used homemade vegetable broth, which imparted so much flavor and depth that canned broth just does not. Wonderful soup on a winter's day.

This is hearty and fantastic. We used extra-hot italian sausage, plus the carrot, onion and garlic as suggested elsewhere, and a parm. rind. Awesome. From a 6 course dinner this got the most remarks.

Great base of a recipe with delicious results. These were the alterations I made: Sauteed the onion with 2 garlic cloves, 2 parsnips, 2 carrots. Added 12 oz sliced turkey kielbasa; sauteed until vegetables were almost caramelized. Added 8 cups of water and a dash of sea salt, two big bunches fresh kale, stemmed and chopped, and about 1/4 tsp. crushed caraway seeds. Simmered soup on low for a couple of hours. Added a good deep dash red wine vinegar. Cooked penne pasta separately, placed about 1/2 cup in bowls and ladled soup on top. Broth was rich and perfect. Kale was delicious. I think the potatoes would have been great -- we just didn't have any.

I used Dinosaur Kale which has a lot of smooth body, plus white beans and Louisiana hot links in addition to the Italian sausage. I also added a chopped tomato. Yes, I can see it isn't the original recipe anymore but it was good!

I love this soup! The ingredients have a magical synergy. I made it with a little more sausage than called for and ground the caraway seeds slightly with a pestle and mortar to open up their flavor. Have just discovered kale and because of this recipe will look for others that have it.

I made this soup with sweet italian chicken sausage. The recipe calls for too much Kale and too much wine. Next time I would add sauted garlic and onion, reduce the kale to 3 cups and and add 1/4 cup less wine. Not a winner

Rating: 2
I would make this again with a different sausage, one with more flavor, perhaps a mild or hot italian sausage. I used a smoked sausage that did not have enough character to overcome the blandness of the potatoes and kale... although my husband disagrees with my analysis.

I think it's a great basic recipe. The result will depend on the quality of ingredients you're using. I sometimes add small white beans to it, you can even omit the potatoes an add cheese tortellini and beans for a "meal in a pot". Just use your imagination.

I make a soup very similar to this. I find it is imperative to use spicy sausage. Andouille is a favorite of mine for this. It compliments the blandness of the potatoes & kale.

I added chopped onion to browned sausage and substituted 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar for wine. It worked very well. Also I cooked soup about 20 min. longer. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Excellent soup, especially when the chicken broth is flavored with fresh herbs. The soup made with potatoes was good, but the second time around I substituted 1/2 cup of orzo for the potatoes. And that was excellent!

Given the 20 minute simmering time for this recipe, there really isn't enough time for the ingredients to impart any flavor to the soup. For me it ended up tasting like chicken stock with lots of stuff in it. This was not helped by the fact that I used supermarket kielbasa, and not the low fat/sodium/turkey variety either. Disappointing because other soups taste so much better for the same amount of effort.
