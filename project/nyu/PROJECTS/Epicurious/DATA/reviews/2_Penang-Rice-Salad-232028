The ingredients are all delicious (I used everything but the turmeric), but it felt like something was missing. I'd recommend peanuts for crunch and/or grilled shrimp. Also, the lime juice wasn't enough to bind everything together. I put in 4 times the amount and still found it was missing moisture and something binding (oil? gnuoc m'am?).
