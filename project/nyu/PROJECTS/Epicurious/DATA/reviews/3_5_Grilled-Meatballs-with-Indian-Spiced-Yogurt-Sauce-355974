I'm always on the lookout for recipes that I can use with game and thought this one would be great, and it was. I used elk venison and added about a 1/2 cup panko also. I also left out the olive oil in the sauce. I made this full size and because of the venison it cooked up in the same amount of time. I served it on a bed of lightly steamed greens with lightly seasoned cous cous. It was a big hit. My family loved it, esp. my hubby. Highly recommend it.

These were wonderful to make with my youngest one, Diogo. He loved to prepare these delicious and easy-to-make meatballs and everybody enjoy them! Thanks.

Yummy. The meatballs have an Asian flavor from the fresh ginger and soy - the yogurt sauce is a delicious compliment. Also a nice change of pace from the same old crockpot of meatballs often served around here for appetizers. Easy too!

Very delicious and easy to make. Nice for an apetizer or main dish.

DOCTORED RECIPE REVIEW! Because the meatball recipe received such lukewarm responses, I thought to (try to) improve on the original. Sorry Abigail. 1 lb beef + 1 lb lamb. 1 c fresh bread crumb. half red onion minced. 2 garlic cloves. 1 tbs soysauce (will omit next time). 2 eggs. 2 heaping tsp minced ginger. 1 tsp garam masala. 1/2 tsp ground cumin. 1/2 tsp ground coriander. 1/2 tsp chili powder. 1.5 tsp salt. 1/2 c cilantro (used mostly stems - needed the leaves for something else). 1/2 tsp ground pepper. 1 tbs veg oil for browning. Followed directions if not ingredients till the oven part. Browned on the stove in batches, finished in a 350deg oven till done. I just pulled them when fragrant and checked for doneness. Meatballs were pretty good. There is still room for them to be better though. Maybe fresh minced chili? More garam masala?

Absolutely yummy. I took these to a potluck party and they were scooped up really quickly. They had just the right touch of umame. I used turkey meat instead because there were some non red meat eaters at the party and I added some finely diced water chestnuts for extra texture. Delish!

These meatballs were really tasty - moist and nicely spiced - but the absolute best thing about them was the yoghurt sauce- I use balkan yoghurt (6% milkfat) and it was to die for! I will make the meatballs again sometime, but will make the sauce over and over
