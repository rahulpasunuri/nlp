Great and super quick and easy! I baked them for 7 minutes and they came out a little fluffier than the picture. I also rolled some of them in nuts or sprinkles which worked well.

Made them with my 4 1/2 year old and I modified this recipe a bit, turned out wonderful: 3/4 cup sugar, 2 cups wholewheat flor, 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon fresh ginger. made small balls and flattened them a bit. left them chewy inside, great!

These were awesome! Just be sure to not over bake them. I am pretty picky and only use airbake sheets, but they came out perfect on my first attempt.

These cookies are wonderful. The first time I made them I rolled them out to use fun cookie cutters but it wasn't worth the trouble because they spread past recognition. They were thin and on the crispy side, which was perfect for a basic powdered sugar glaze. My friends ate them up immediately. The second time I balled them and pressed them down with a glass and they turned out great.

These were amazing, and very easy to make! I also added some orange zest and a little extra cinnamon to the recipe.

Easy and yummy. Only problem is I used a cookie scoop and only got two dozen cookies instead of four!

Yummy. Buttery. But, reduce the baking powder by at least a half-tsp, maybe a full one. To puffy!

Just popped my last pan of these into the oven. I ended up with about1/4 c. of extra flour (as another reviewer mentioned). I rolled my cookies in oats and stuck a white chocolate chip in the middle of them, pressed slightly and then baked. Very cute, and great flavor. Added a few extra dashes of ginger and a little agave to the dough. I think this would make a great tart crust too!

These cookies are delicious! Mine did not spread as much as the picture and are moist and chewy instead of crispy. I added 1 tsp of vanilla bc my husband wanted more of a chocolate chip cookie taste (w/o the chocolate). This is an excellent recipe to play around with.

Great Recipe. Added a little vanilla and nutmeg.

These are great cookies! I dipped half of each cookie into melted bittersweet chocolate to make them "my own" and the flavors were perfect.

These cookies are amazing. I also made them with the alspice and I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown sugar. They were super easy and delicious! This is a must keep recipe.

I used 1/2 tsp of allspice instead of the ginger, it added a more of a molasses taste to the cookie. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Brown-Sugar-Cookies-367569#ixzz1bj9NZsB3

My mother in law got this recipe off of a land o lakes butter package 20 or more years ago. they make their appearance every winter and I LOVE them. She uses the glass and sugar trick as well.

This is my first review, perhaps my last...but I must share my enthusiasm for this recipe which I first received at a bridal shower in 1954! The "final touch" is a fat 1/2 pecan on top, which toasts as they bake. Even the non-nut loving kids like them. They will spread better if one uses butter rather than marg, etc.

This recipe was okay. Mine took only a little less time to cook and I ended up having to add a 1/4 cup more flour. They were delicious in the end though.

I liked these cookies, but mine did not spread as much as the ones in the photo. I ended up helping them out by dipping the bottom of a juice glass in sugar and using it to flatten the cookies before baking them.
