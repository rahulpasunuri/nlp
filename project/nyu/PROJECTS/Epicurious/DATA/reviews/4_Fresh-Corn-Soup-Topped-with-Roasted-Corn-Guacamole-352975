The topping is fabulous and the soup is kind of a supporting actor. I found the quantity of stock way to little and increased it to 3-4 cups. It made no sense to me to try to blend the corn in the blender with no liquid so I just sauteed the corn with the onions, then added the broth, then blended with an immersion blender. Worked great.

This recipe is quite easy and a wow in my book.

This is my new go-to for entertaining during corn season. The flavors are fantastic and the presentation is impressive. One thing though..in the recipe the jalepeno for the soup says stemmed and chopped NOT de-seeded like in the salsa. Next time I would de-seed the pepper for the soup because the heat way overpowered the corn flavor (and I'm no heat wimp). The blended jalepeno also gave the corn soup a greenish color. I think in the future I may leave the jalepeno out of the soup so I get a vibrant yellow base and use dots of green chili oil to finish and add heat.

Very good! I did add a little chili powder to the soup after it began to simmer just to add some flavor, and it was fantastic. The roasted corn was especially tasty, although I am not sure I would call it guacamole.

Sooooo good! Fresh and piquant. The corn guacamole on top is amazing, in fact I am making some right now as a condiment for hamburgers. I'm sure the key, as with anything, is fresh top quality ingredients. I will be making this for as long as I can get good fresh corn. A keeper!

I made the mistake of not replacing the jalapenos with a different pepper. The soup was good primarily because of the good farm-fresh corn. It was a tad bland, and I even used less chicken broth than called for. Next time, I will definitely put some pepper in as it needs the kick. The roasted corn atop was pretty good - although if I made it again I'd make it "drier" and less of a guacamole as I found it a little weird in texture.

I thought the soup was okay, but the roasted corn guacamole was delicious! Will make that to serve with chips again before I make the soup part again.

I love this soup, but I do strain out the corn kernel shells in a big hole strainer before I serve it. I don't even bother with the guacamole, although one day I will. It is corn essense.

Healthy, light, and wonderful! The texture is so creamy my guests asked if the soup contained heavy cream. The best part is the roasted corn guacamole, which I plan to serve as an appetizer with chips! This soup is also great with a little dollop of sour cream on top.

This was absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. I mashed the avocado instead of chopping because it was really ripe, but other than that I did just what the recipe said. My husband was blown away. It was so rich and flavorful!

Amazing soup, and very healthy as well. It needed about a cup more chicken broth, and even with that still only served only 2 for a main course. If you want to serve more, make sure to double. Corn guacamole would be good just as a dip or even as a topping w/ fish...

This was a really amazing soup. The corn I had wasn't as sweet, so I added a bit of sugar to the soup. The presentation is really great, and the topping adds wonderful flavor to the soup. I served with a few tortilla chips, which were fun to dunk in the soup. Overall--really wonderful. Just be careful cutting those jalapenos!

This is an excellent soup, so excellent that I haven't even begun to digest it as I write this... I had to post about it right away! We used fresh yellow and sweet white corn. It's definitely a lot lighter than a corn chowder, visually more impressive, and delightful to eat! My husband would cringe at the word "guacamole" so I did not call it that... after all, the avocado is not smashed up. He agreed to try it with the avocado and he LOVED it. Pickiest eater ever... and he was gushing over this soup and roasted corn guac. This recipe will comfortably serve 2 people who are eating it as a main dish. If it's going to be served as an appetizer or side dish, you could get 4 small-med bowls out of it. You must try this soup. It's one of the best soups I've tasted!

What an unusual and elegant summer soup. We loved it, and will incorporate it into our rotation of favorites. The soup is so simple, but equally delicious and flavorful; the roasted corn guacamole is a terrific update of the usual-- a take on guacamole much like others we have had in great restaurants in mexico city. I used fresh sweet corn; I did strain the soup and i think that contributed to its elegance.

I would eat the roasted corn guacamole on it's own. Boyfriend made it last night, am eating it again the next day at work. Makes great left overs. Next time we'll probably add another jalapeno, but other than that it was quick to make and very fresh.

I enjoyed this recipe and will make it for an upcoming summer dinner party as a small first course. I did, after reviewing the recipe and reviews, make some revisions. I started by sauteeing the onion, garlic, jalepeno and corn until tender; added a dap of butter to richen and smooth it out. Then blend. This Went a long way. The soup can now stand on its own, but still does not over-power the topping. I also strained the soup, which provided a better texture especially for a dinner party. Just be careful not to over salt. Many soups seem to absorb salt and need more and more. Not this one. Go easy. Finish it off with a fresh squeeze of lime.

I think the ingredient combination in this recipe is great but I did make some modifications for additional flavor. For the soup, I added the garlic and onion first and let get slightly browned then I added the jalopeno (and seasoned with salt and pepper all along). Used veggie vs. chicken stock. Used frozen corn for the soup, fresh for the guacamole. The soup does hold well in a crockpot so you can make that up ahead of time if you have company. Guacamole was a hit - I won't seed the jalopenos for the guac next time. The cool of the guac in the soup was fantastic.

I have made many corn soup recipes and this is, hands down, the very best corn soup recipe I have ever had! I used it in a class and all my students agreed. The combination of the jalapeno, the roasted corn and the lime was such a flavor burst. To those who said the soup was nothing special,I think it needs to be calm to let the topping shine. Otherwise, they would compete with each other. Make it, you will LOVE it!!!

They're not kidding when they say let the corn blacken - much better that way. Avocado in the warm soup is delicious. I used chipotle peppers instead of jalapenos, because that's what i had on hand - it was nice and smoky.

i really loved this recipe. BUT - i was making it for 4 people and when i saw how much it made - i had to double it. as is, this recipe will only really serve 2 people....4 if its a super small appetizer or super small side dish. otherwise - double everything.

The soup was fantastic! The texture was creamy, but without the fat that a lot of other corn soups/chowders require. I used fresh corn for the broth and frozen for the guacamole. The frozen corn toasted up nice and crispy; gave the guac. a nice, nutty flavor. Definitely try this recipe!!

This recipe had a lot of steps for the end result. The soup almost seemed to be an afterthought and not really worth the blending and cooking. I would definitely, however, make the roasted corn guacamole again! It would be fantastic served with some tortilla chips. Either way, this soup isn't quite enough to stand up on its own as an entree, but it's also not quite right as an appetizer.

Rating: 4
Great flavor and easy to make. We substituted vegetable stock for the chicken stock. We also added a bit more salt, pepper and jalapeno. The texture combination of the soup and avocado vs the crunchy corn and raw onion is great. The soup itself stand alone is not interesting, but the combination with the guacamole is fantastic. We also used a food processor not a blender, so that fixed some of the other reviewers issues with lumpiness.

Rating: 3
Separately, I would probably rate the soup alone 2 Forks and the Roasted Corn Guacamole 3 Forks. The soup itself is noting special; it needs more seasoning, and the texture of the soup would be much improved by straining. the guacamole adds necessary interest and flavor to the dish. I particularly liked the lime which adds some liveliness to the soup. The roasted corn smelled and tasted delicious; however it was chewy and ended up stuck in my teeth; I may have roasted it too long.

Rating: 4
I didn't use the extra jalapeño in the guacamole dip, I'm not a huge fan of pepper spice. And I'm glad I didn't! The spice from the soup itself is plenty fine! Otherwise, this is a great recipe. Pretty easy, convenient & quick to make. I probably spent 30 minutes total on this meal.

I loved the guacamole--4 forks for it. Roasted the corn for about 15 minutes and it was great. As for the soup, I cannot imagine that people would have been happy eating this made as the recipe states. The soup had a slightly lumpy texture that was very unappealing. In the end, I took the lumpy soup, added much more stock, simmered for a much longer time, strained through the soup, discarded the corn pulp that remained and added a touch of cream and a bit of sugar. The end result, a creamier, smooth corn soup with the guacamole was wonderful and deserved at least 3 forks, probably 4.

I love this soup! I can't stop making it. Don't forgo the roasted corn guacamole- it adds great texture and flavor to the soup. I find the recipe makes more than enough as a garnish, which is fine by me, I serve it along with salsa and traditional guacamole with chips. The soup tastes creamy, without any dairy. I'll be making this for years to come.

I made this soup and wanted to keep it for the week, so I tried to find a way to make it stand alone, without the guacamole (since i don't have time to make the guac every time I eat, and I wanted it for multiple meals). I think a lot of the previous reviews are correct - the soup is a bit bland on its own, however, I discovered an ingredient that completes it - SUGAR. add a little bit of sugar when it's finished simmering for 15 minutes and it's perfect. will def make it again.

Rating: 2
Be warned! I tried to halve this recipe and I think too much liquid evaporated during the simmer, I had to add a little water which weakened the soup flavor. My guacamole was foiled by a less-than-ripe avocado and 20 minutes totally scalded my corn. I even like that charry burn flavor, but it was still beyond saving. It sounds like all the other reviewers had better luck than I did!

Rating: 4
The flavor of the oven-roasted corn is worth the stickiness. But, I would recommend spraying the foil on the cookie sheet to avoid having to scrape the corn off. I substituted a fresh, fire-roasted poblano for the jalapeno. It makes the color of the soup a little green, but adds a fuller flavor than the jalapeno.

I also found the texture to be little off. I added some toasted cumin and chili powder to taste aswell. I liked this recipe as a base for whatever flavorings you desire.

We loved this soup. Per the recommendation from other reviewers, I roasted the corn for the guacamole on the grill instead of the oven. Also, toasted some cumin seeds and sprinkled them in the soup at the very end. The jalapeno in the soup added quite a bit of heat.

Love this recipe. I followed the suggestion of adding cumin to the soup - delicious. I would suggest roasting the corn on the grill for the salsa. I was concerned as the soup tasted a bit 'simple' once finished, but when you add the guacamole ... WOW .. the combination is amazing. Would definately make this again.

Very, very good. Just darn good. Added cumin and chili powder which helped. There wasn't enough soup, only enough for three good servings, so I'll be doubling the soup next time. The guacamole was superb, I'd serve that with nearly anything.

I had the same issue with the corn guacomole. It sounded delicious and was pretty tasty, but that was completely overshadowed by how chewy the corn became. And yes, it did stick to your teeth. A whole bowl of it sat uneaten at a company picnic because it wasn't worth the annoyance factor.

Great soup--nice thick texture without using any cream. I followed the other comments and added some cumin and chili powder, which gave it a little more personality. Don't be afraid to keep the corn in the oven for a little more than 20 minutes.

Didn't try the soup but made the guacamole to go with grilled flank steak. Guac was delicious but I found the carmelized corn stuck annoyingly to my teeth. I'm surprised no one else has commented on that. Maybe it was just me? Next time I'd give the corn less time in the oven.

Made this for dinner last night and it was a big hit with my husband. Found it too thick to puree in a blender, though, so used an immersion blender. Liked it chunky so wouldn't change that. Did add a few drops of hot sauce just to spice it up a bit. Will likely use the guacamole for other dishes as well.

As the previous reviewer said, the roasted corn guacamole is delicious. I felt the soup was a little bland though, so I added the following: 1 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. cumin and additional black pepper. We garnished with homemade baked sprouted corn chips and a little pepper jack cheese as well. Next time I will double the soup recipe and puree the corn in 2 batches.

The corn guacamole is delicious and I served it with a grilled flank steak. The soup needs to be strained before serving otherwise it's too chunky. Once the soup is strained, there would only be enough for 2 maybe 3 servings, stretched. Gave it 3 forks b/c it had good flavor, but the consistency could have been better.
