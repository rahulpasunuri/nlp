Tasty and super-easy. Not a combination that would've occurred to me, so I find it a nice change of pace.

Very nice. Simple yet elegant. Does benefit from a boost in flavor, though. I used some Calvados in place of the water, some extra orange zest and a bit of the juice as well. Reserves bit of the sliced mint to sprinkle over the top before serving.

I made this with just a tablespoon of butter, and it was delicious!

Great simple recipe. The orange zest and very fresh mint are a great combination.

I found the butter glaze too heavy. It overpowered the fresh veggie taste. I would've preferred just a little salt and pepper.

I would increase the orange peel a bit.

YUUMY!!! Loved the mix of orange and mint (Used less butter). Made for Mother's Day with the May Citrus Grilled Chick under a brick and the June Basmati Rice w/Herbs. All delicious.
