Wow! I love this recipe. Yes, it's work, but it is so worth it. My only change was to not use the saran wrap (I just felt strange putting that in the oven, you know?) and to cook it at 400. When I read the recipe I thought 450 was high, and just decided to change it and see what happened. For the one who felt the citrus overpowered the dish, did you remove the lemon slices when you took the top foil off? I removed them and just set them aside for presentation. The leeks had a light, citrus note and we only needed a touch of vinaigrette on the final dish. This is a keeper!

Osteria Mozza is my favorite restaurant in the world. I have had multiple mozzarella dishes at the restaurant but have never had this one. After getting the Mozza cookbook I decided to try out this recipe first. OMG it is unbelievable. It tastes like michellin star quality food right from your own kitchen. You have to make sure that you watch the leeks so they don't get too brown. I also agree that the temp may have been too high but since i was watching them I knew they were about to burn, but you need to get right there so that the leeks are really golden. Also, Choirgirl21: burrata shouldn't be that tangy...you may have gotten one that had started to go bad. It has a more delicate taste than regular mozzarella. Also, you need to make sure that its really soft in the middle, if its hard its just a waste. This literally is the best thing I have ever cooked, and I am pretty good. My fiancee also was extremely impressed, he said it tasted as good as something you would have at Mozza. I followed the recipe to the T (except I took the leeks out early). It was amaaaaazing.

Was excited to make this recipe for Valentine's Day. Made bread crumbs and vinaigrette the day before and it took a while. Put leeks in oven as instructed and when I went to remove the cover, the plastic wrap had melted. YIKES! Had to throw it out. I would like to try to make it again, but won't use plastic wrap. The breadcrumbs do taste great.

My friends and I enjoyed this dish at a recent dinner party, but I'm not sure I'd make it again. Given all the various components I was hoping for a "wow" dish and just didn't get it. I still think it's worth trying if it sounds good to you, with a few adjustments. One, either braise the leeks at a lower temp (350) or just cover the pan with foil (no saran wrap) and cook for a shorter time at 450. I think either will work. When they're done braising, just take the foil off for a few minutes to brown them. Also, at least 1/2 the vinaigrette recipe, or 1/3 it, or 1/6 it - you get the idea - it was FAR TOO MUCH. Last comment, I supposedly got burrata from my local Italian shop, but it looked nothing like the cheese in the photo. Maybe mine only had a teeny creamy center, or maybe I got something else so that could have affected the dish. My cheese was firm, and a had a pretty tangy taste - much stronger than mozarella.

Very tasty. Breadcrumbs are excellent to use on salads

First time I baked leeks, my family thought it was very tasty. Outside seemed tough will remove more outside layers next time.

the combination of textures is amazing. roasting the leeks brings out the sweet, delicate flavor. amazing.

I agree that a 450 degree oven seems way too hot for this. For one thing, Glad cling wrap can (and will) melt at this temperature. I also agree that the lemon needs to be cutback considerably. The bread crumbs are definitely worth the effort, but they need to be used judiciously. I would still make this recipe again.

On the whole, I was dissapointed with this recipe. I used less lemon juice then it says, and the lemon still really overpowered the whole meal! -didn't even use the vinaigrette, which says a lot because I love cooking with citrus. Fortunately I also made potatoes which helped balance the flavor a little. I really wanted it to be good, but it needs work and modifications before that will be the case. I'd like to try it again, so if anyone has modifications they'd like to share- I'm all ears.

Unique presentation, full flavor, breadcrumbs are worth the extra steps, completely noteworthy!

I have to wonder if the "450" is a typo. I will try this again, but at 350, and after I finish soaking my scorched pan. My leeks were dark brown and leathery on the outside, and I even added more liquid and took them out early. BUT, the flavors were fantastic and worth another try. I liked the breadcrumbs as written, and used my toaster oven. I used regular mozzarella and it was delicious with the leeks. I won't rate the recipe until I try it again at a lower temperature

A lot of work for the result--and too much oven time at two very different temps (works out OK if you have a toaster oven as well as a regular oven). The dressing is lovely, but the mustard breadcrumbs are a waste of time. Toast up some panko with broken mustard seed instead. The dressing goes very well with leftover pork and chicken.
