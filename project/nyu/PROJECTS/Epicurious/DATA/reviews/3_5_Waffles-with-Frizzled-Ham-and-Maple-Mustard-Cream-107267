I made this almost as written. I used english muffins. I added the green onions as I was sauteeing the ham. Otherwise, exactly as written. It was fan-freaking-tastic! Can't wait to have it again.

This recipe was fantastic... I'm making it again :) If you're shopping around for a frozen waffle, you may want to try Van's Organic Frozen Waffles - they're made with whole grain flour and wholesome organic ingredients. Or the 97% Fat Free is a nice option with only 2 grams of fat per serving and 4 grams of protein. More info at www.vansintl.com. Happy cooking! -The team at Van's Intl. Foods

I absolutely love this! This is a great on brunch a menu! I do have to agree with the bitter reviewer on a couple of things, though. I definately prefer this on english muffins, more fitting, and I omitted the green onions, and you have a supurb brunch!

This has been a favorite in our house since it came out in the magazine. It is a quick, flavorful fall and winter supper. I love to serve it over cornbread, my own waffles, or nice frozen ones. I've served it often to friends and visiting family, and they always ask for the recipe.

Great recipe! I made this for a last minute brunch and people are still talking about 6 months later! It is really easy to make. I only gave it 3 forks because I used the regular frozen waffles. Next time I'll try either frozen Belguim waffles or make my own. That will make it a 4 forker for sure.

Reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a good breakfast for us on a day where mosr options seemed boring. Boy was I wrong. I don't know where to start; whipping cream and butter make it too fatty, green onions definitely do not belong with maple syrup or waffles, too much mustard, and waffles are not a good choice for this sauce. I don't recommend at all.

This was a hit! I needed a recipe for some leftover ham, and this intrigued me. It is good enough to serve to company, but quick enough to make for the family during the week. This has become a family favourite!

I had to try this just because it sounded "weird". My husband loved it! Something different for a quick meal - go ahead, try it!

This is actually very good. The ham provides salt for the sauce, and the maple makes it just sweet enough. I made my own waffles, because I like fresh ones so much more than the toaster kind. I served this as a main brunch course, and everybody loved it.
