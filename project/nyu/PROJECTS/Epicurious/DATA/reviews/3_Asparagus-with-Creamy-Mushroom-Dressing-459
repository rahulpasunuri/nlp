Well I had everything to make this dish, but did not realize cream sauce was cold/room temp until reading instruction. Ick..so I warmed up less EVOO and cooked mushrooms then added in dry white wine and cream. I'd add some fresh basil and garlic (delete dijon) instead of tarragon next go round and throw over nice pasta, but prefer my asparagus with red peppers and tossed with garlic and balsamic better.

Like another reviewer this did not work at all. don't know if it was the olive oil or mustard i used, but the sauce was inedible. thank heaven i tasted it before coating the asparagus. wish i knew what went wrong as it would be a great recipe to have on hand.

This is a very good recipe but you need really good asparagus to make it shine. We had large stalks and they were too tough to enjoy. The dressing is a hit and I will try again with better asparagus.

Thia just didn't turn out for me, and I'm not really sure why. It wasn't bad, just not good. Next time I will try patting dry the mushrooms after draining, doubling the tarragon, cutting the oil to 1 Tbsp, and using some leftover vegetable stock to thin it out if necessary.

This was a hit at my Easter brunch, I had several requests for the recipe. I cooked the asparagus ahead and kept in the fridge overnight as directed, and used dill instead of tarragon (which I forgot to buy). Great recipe for entertaining due to ease and wonderful presentation.

Wow! This was amazing. Easy and delicious. It's a great side dish for grilled dishes, beef, chicken, or shrimp. Scrumptious!
