This soup was fantastic! It was perfect for a warm Spring evening. I agree with a previous reviewer to wait to put the potatoes in. They did get a tad mushy. I added a diced jalapenos to the broth and instead of hominy I added some frozen corn. We garnished it with some corn chips, avocado, a squeeze of lime, and some fresh cilantro. I only wished that we had guests over to enjoy it with us because it made plenty.

Easy, relatively quick soup. I like cilantro, lime, and hominy. So this is a very summery, bright soup for me. It's not the most complex of flavors, but it's still enjoyable for me, at least.

Would add potatoes a bit later and pepper to tase. Makes large portions.

good soup but i'd leave out the potato (they got kinda mealy and squishy) and add more hominy and carrots. seems like it's missing something though.... use TONS of pepper. good soup and filling.

soup was delicious. don't omit the hominy! one of my favorite foods, and goya hominy is cheap, too! doubled the lime juice (it's my favorite fruit), but that might not be for everyone. my only complaint is that the chicken tended to be a little bland, but it's chicken, so what else is new?

I added a couple of dried whole arbol chiles, which added some nice heat. In addition, I browned the chicken in a little canola oil with garlic. A very delicious soup!

This soup got great reviews from my family. The hominy and coriander make this dish. The lime and cilantro finish this dish off perfectly. This is definitely a keeper.

This soup was fragrant and delicious. We added a dollup of light sour cream and salsa as a garnish, which improved the flavor. It also took significantly less time to cook than the instructions said. I think from start to finish (including chopping) it only took about 30 minutes total. Paired with a salad, it makes a great quick weeknight meal.

This was some good chicken soup..a hit with all who I tested it on at work. Tried it as posted and also without the hominy and replaced with fideo. Great both ways. A little lemon juice added after cooking and salsa for those of us that nothing is too hot for was good too

One of our very favorite soup recipes! We make this one again and again. The lime, cilantro and hominy give plain old chicken soup and delicous twist.

This was soooo good, I'm making it again. I am claiming it as my mother's secret recipe. Sorry mom! (P.S. I used parsley instead of cilantro and it gave it a much fresher flavor.)

I addded a handful of chopped red pepper and replaced the potato with more hominy. I came out just right.

I've served this soup to both my family and guests. It's a hit with everyone and I've given the recipe out multiple times. The lime gives it a unique taste and the hominy really flavors the broth.

The hominy added an unpleasant chewiness to this recipe. Other than that, it wasn't much different than regular chicken soup (which is nothing to sneeze at, no pun intended).
