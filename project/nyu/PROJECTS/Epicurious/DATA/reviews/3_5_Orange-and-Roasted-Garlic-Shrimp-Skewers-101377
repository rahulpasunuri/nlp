Although this was good I cannot give it more than 2 forks. It was quite a bit of work for a so-so flavor. I didn't taste the orange juice which was dissappointing after juicing all those oranges.

Dont get stuck on OJ-my fave thing to do is reduce nectars (in this case, peach nectar)with the garlic and I added red pepper flakes. Since this is grill season, we grilled the skewered shrimp(saved some of the marinade-reduced further for a sauce)and these were amazing. So light for a summer dinner with tomato cucumber salad and steamed snow peas. Yum.

This is one of my favorite shrimp recipes. I always add 1/2 t. red pepper flakes and 1 t. orange zest. Last time I made it I boiled down the marinade and then stirred in cold butter 1 Tablespoon at a time (approx 6 T.) and added a touch of diced jalapeno. I served the shrimp over rice and poured this sauce on top. It was amazing. You can skip the boiling down of the sauce if you reserve some of the marinade before adding the shrimp. The key to the sauce is waiting until one piece of the butter is completely melted before adding the next, using low heat, and having the butter cold.

This dish was my first Epicurean disappointment. Shrimp never tastes bad so the result was OK, but the marinade added absolutely nothing besides a hint of garlic, and when I think about all the wonderful shrimp recipes that are available, this one rates a loser.

This was good. I think I will finely chop a jalapeno into the marinade to add some zip next time. Maybe use lime juice instead of orange. Next time, I'll use bigger shrimp also. Very good and easy.

Wonderful! Made this skewered on the grill for company along with another great recipie "skewered chicken with lemon butter sauce" and grilled baby portabella mushrooms and grape tomatoes. Make the marinade ahead, marinate the shrimp 1 1/2 hours as indicated and there will be little left to do but spend time with your guests when they arrive!

I subsituted scallops for shrimp (added a bit of salt to the orange juice while it was reducing) and it turned out great.

Very delicious and an interesting combination of flavors. I also liked the tip about the red pepper flakes. It was a welcome addition.

Made this the other night and it was wonderful! As a variation, I added about 1/4t. dried red pepper to the marinade and it gave it just a little extra zip. Also, threaded the shrimp on the skewers around blanched pearl onions and we grilled them!! Already am planning to feature them at our next deck party!
