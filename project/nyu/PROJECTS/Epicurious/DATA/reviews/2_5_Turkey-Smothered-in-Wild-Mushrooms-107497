I used leftover turkey that I heated seperately then added at the end to meld. I used onions (didn't have shallots)added a little garlic, about 50% more tarragon & some black pepper. Was a little bland before. Delicious!

I will make this again if I use turkey thigh meat. Except that the turkey breast was typical turkey breast, it was good. The mushrooms were great. I used a pound of really nice fresh mixed wild mushrooms, substituted fresh chives for fresh tarragon, and substituted Chardonnay for Sherry. They are generous portions when calorie counting. With turkey thighs it will be even more earthy -- great match for drinking Pinot Noir.

This was a disappointment, but then they all can't be winners.
