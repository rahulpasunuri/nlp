Made this recipe and took the advice of adding the lime rind to the rice while cooking. Unfortunately this made my rice very bitter and wasn't palatable. I will try this again without using the rind because I like the idea of the lime and cilantro. I did use brown rice also, which takes longer to cook, but is a little healthier than the white. I guess it's possible this could have added to the bitterness, along with the rind, but will give it another shot, using lime juice instead. Hard to rate at this point, but will reserve the right to change my rating after next time.

my husband made this for our anniversary in the summer, and served it over the "pan roasted sizzling shrimp". we have had it several times since then. LOVE IT! it's simple, but delicious. i love the lime and cilantro flavors, so it wasn't surprising that i loved these flavors infused in my rice, over the spicy shrimp.

Yummy! ( a teensy bit dry - but good flavor - low effort!) I made a quick salsa with fresh pineapple and lime juice and a serrano pepper and put that on top, WOW, it may have been a little boring without it. Took someone's advice and added more cilantro and the lime peel to cook. Didn't bother tying the cilantro - it just pulled out. WOuld make it more often if only white rice had ANY nutrional value.

This is a great alternative to plain rice. I prepared it with basmati, using chicken broth instead of water, and added a few more cilantro springs for extra flavor. Wonderful served with Catfish in Spicy Tomato Sauce (also from this site).

Try this: substitute chicken broth for water. Squeeze lime and set juice aside. Put squeezed lime rind in with the cilantro stalks to cook with the rice. When done, remove rind and cooked cilantro and add juice and chopped cilantro. These improvements keep the dish from being bland.

BED RICE Invented while on a boating holiday but now used at home we have simplified rice cooking. boil water, add rice, wrap pot in towels and stick in your bed.(under sleeping bag, quilt) works like a slow cooker, perfect every time. Ideal for company when you don't know exactly when you need it. stays hot for hours. Works with quinoa etc too

Rice is an art...don't mismeasure, or use a rice cooker!! The first time we thought we'd found a trick by making it in the rice cooker and found we had wet rice that had burned on the bottom!!! Second time 'round, strictly to the directions...DELISH!!!
