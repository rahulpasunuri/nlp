This was a wonderful and easy salad. I used salad ingredients that I had on hand such as mixed greens, radishes, julienne carrots, madarin oranges and La Choy chinese noodles. I used a boneless chicken breast, sliced it very thin in place of the chicken thighs. I served it as a first course with a glass of Pino Grigio. My guests were nuts about it. I think this recipe would also lend itself well to shrimp.

This was not better than mediocre. The dressing was slightly too salty (maybe use low sodium soy sauce next time?) and tasted generic. Up the quantity of fresh ginger in the dressing and definitely don't skip the watercress; its unique flavor is the most redeeming quality of the recipe.

In Chicago you can buy roast duck or fried chicken wings at a Vietnamese shop and then this recipe is very easy. This time I made it with watercress, but I'll try it with cabbage (cheaper and easier) next time.

Great! You don't need to rush out to find watercress (impossible to find in my area), just substitute any greens you like. And you can use leftover fried chicken! Easy to do and just great!
