Deliciously unique and elegant. Suggest you do use 12" pan to make cake layer thin enough for compote to soak through (I used 10"). I used a bit more grappa which didn't hurt; other berries and even a Marsala or rich fruity dessert wine or liquor such as Damson Gin would would work in lieu of Grappa. Confectionery sugar dusted on top works nicely as well.

This is EXCELLENT! I was very anxious to try this and was thrilled at how it turned out. Even the biggest doubters of polenta were blown away. The grappa give amazing dimension to the blackberries. If I could I would give it 10 forks!

This cake is fabulous and definitely needs to sit for an entire day (or even 2!) before serving to let the blackberry compote soak into the cake. I didn't have a 12" pan (and my cake server isn't even that big!) so i used the 10" springform pan that I had. (Seems like the 12" pan would make the cake too thin anyway.) Next time I will cut the recipe in half and bake in a 5" pan. Also substituted vodka since I don't have grappa and didn't want to buy it just for this.

The group I made this for agreed 100% that it is a winner. I, on the other hand, thought the cake was a bit too sweet and will alter the amount of confectioners' sugar next time. I'd also cut the cake recipe in half, which would produce a normal-sized cake that might be better able to soak up the juice from the compote, making it more like a pudding and less like a cake with compote poured over it. Despite these quibbles, it was different and very tasty.

This was wonderful. Didn't have grappa so I used Absolut Vodka. Major hit at party of highly competitive foodies!
