I'd use sea scallops, halved, the next time,so the scallops don't get lost in the vegetables. I'd also add some matchstick slivers of jalapeno, being from the Southwest. I might also try serving it over angel hair, using a little more cornstarch and some clam juice.

This dish wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

This is a high flavor low work recipie. I did not use the corn starch because I wanted to keep it light.
