Not what I expected, but great. It could possibly be because I didn't have garlic on hand, so I omitted it, but the flavor was somehow...one dimensional. The saving grace of course, was the reduction and cream at the end! An easy mole, but the more complex recipes mean a more complex flavor profile! I guess in this case, you get what you choose :)

Based on user reviews, I modified the recipe to have poblano peppers and less canned chipotles. Also, because the store was out of pumpkin I ended up substituting with butternut squash (roasted). It was mild/medium hot and completely delicious baked over chicken and bean enchiladas. yum!

Great recipe! I de-seeded the chipotles for the mole, but ended up adding some of their adobo b/c it wasn't spicy enough for me. Definitely serve this with the lime and cilantro; they bring a lot to this wonderful dish.

Very good recipe, however I only used 1 ancho chili and it was still sinus clearingly spicy. Next time I would try not using chilis and using fire roasted tomatoes instead. I served this with a saffron rice which was a nice compliment.

So, I'm a pumpkin person... I love all things pumpkin. And this was wonderful! A little labor-intensive, but definitely worth it. I ended up with more sauce than the chicken could handle, so I ate it all week.... just sauteed some chicken (sans marinade, etc), and added the sauce, then the appropriate ecoutrements... I froze some of the sauce for another time, and it came back to life wonderfully. I have a can of pumpkin in my cupboard waiting for me to make this again...

This was a lot spicier than I expected! I think if I had seeded the chipotle chiles, it might have been good.

There are few Rick Bayless recipes that disappoint . . . I used bone-in breasts for extra flavor and grilled them slowly, so they were very moist. Mole was very good -- even better two days later. Served this with roasted vegetables the first time and very creamy potatoes the second time.

So... I tried this dish after all of the rave reviews. The outcome was not quite what I had expected, yet it was thoroughly enjoyable. The chicken is quite tasty (the only alteration I made to the whole recipe was adding lime juice to the marinade). The mole sauce is not like a traditional mole that I am used to, but it was definitely tasty and very fun to make. It's a nice Sunday afternoon meal (highly recommend opening a bottle of wine!).

Even my husband, who hates pumpkin, loved this recipe. The mole was the perfect creamy compliment to the spicy chicken. I served with cilantro rice and it was a huge hit.

I didn't rate because I only made the mole sauce for use in a vegetarian cornbread casserole (also on epicurious). I followed the instructions closely and ended up with a delicious sauce. I separated half of it and added a bit of bittersweet chocolate because, really, what is mole but another way to eat chocolate? Both versions were a big hit, though I preferred the chocolatey one. I would use this recipe again.

I made this recipe nearly as written, except by adding an extra teaspoon of brown sugar. My guests loved it. I would definily make this recipe again. It makes about a cup of extra sauce, but that was no problem....the sauce is so wonderful, it can be used on many other things. Give it a try!

Used two corn tortillas instead of bread, fresh tomato instead of canned, and half-and-half instead of cream. An absolutely wonderful, transporting dish, and the Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen I drank with it was the perfect match. Unforgettable!

We made it tonight in honor of a Mexican friend. He had two servings! There is plenty of sauce left over and we look forward to enjoying with other grilled meats in the coming week or two. The taste is rich, complex and surprisingly mellow. It was as fun to make as it is enjoyable to eat. A great choice for people who think Mexican food is nothing but tortillas and heat.

This is my favorite mole recipe! I use it on chicken, steak, pasta and have even made a lasagne with it. My Husband and kids beg me to make it, they love it so much!

I used fresh finger peppers instead of dried anchos because I couldn't find them and was able to skip the whole soaking part. Used an extra chipolte and a whole can of diced tomatos. The sauce was excelent and I am going to serve it over steak for next time. For a side dish I served white corn and pumpkin dumplings in a sage butter. Even my steak and potatoes boyfriend loved this dish!

I love mole. Been to Mexico many times--and this is still my favorite dish of all. I wish this particular recipe turned out a TAD sweeter. Just a little. I like my mole on the semi-sweet side. That said, I thought the flavor was quite nice--a perfect blend of hot and savory. It's currently winter in Chicago, so I'm not really in the grilling mood. I roasted the chicken for 20 min at 400 degrees with the glaze, moved the pan down to the lower part of the oven and added some of the mole for the last 20 minutes. It was fantastic. Though, like I said, not the best I've had. But still quite good--time consuming, but not difficult. Try it out, but if you like it sweeter as I do, add some more sugar perhaps. I don't know...

Hate to be a naysayer, but the mole part of this one really doesn't cut it. Followed the recipe to the letter, but it just isn't worth the effort. The spiciness overwhelms the pumpkin flavor.

I love the smoky flavor of this recipe. I sliced the chicken, poured the mole over it and served it "fajita-style", with flour tortillas and the usual fajita toppings. It was something different from the standard fajita. It was a big hit with my cooking club friends. None was left.

This is a terrific recipe, worth the time. Save a little of the mole for the next night and put it together with goat cheese and a small amount of fresh rosemary, as a filling for ravioli (I used wonton wrappers). Drizzle the cooked ravioli with your best olive oil and top with frizzled leeks or chives or toasted pine nuts. Yummy!

I made this for a birthday celebration, serving it with tortillas and a salad of spinach, black beans and corn. All thought it was terrific, even my 13 y/o stepson who is afraid of spicy food ate it. The mole is fabulous, full of subtle flavors and textures,a great winter dish. I ended the meal with winter spiced moilten chocolate cakes and got raves from all.

A great dish, well worth the effort. We expected the pumpkin flavor to be more prominent (which is why I didn't try the recipe right away) but it was pretty subtle. We liked the way the flavors of the sauce weren't overpowering but seemed to build as we ate.

pumpkin is a nice idea, but this sauce is BORING. and a ton of trouble. better off with BBQ from the jar.

I thought this was a great recipe...and will probably be even better with the right chiles. I could not find ancho, so used dried habaneros instead...they are hotter than jalapenos so gave the sauce a real hot smoky taste. I like a sweeter mole, so I added MUCH more brown sugar (about 5-6 Tablespoons) as well as sweetened chocolate (which is used in some traditional mole recipes). I also threw in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cumin for kicks. It was very tasty. I am going to try it again with Anchos (found them at Roche Bros. in the suburbs of Boston).

so here's what i did.. i did ithe anchos, but i also added a few guajillo chiles, some raisins that soaked right along with the chies more garlic and tomotoes (i used some fresh plum tomatoes that i roasted first) and a toasted corn tortilla. I was VERY surprised at how the pumpkin flavor never got lost among all the pther things that I put in. I'm taking this to a pot luck and so i haven't tried the glaze yet, I just added a bunch of shredded chicken that I had on hand. This is an EXCELLENT recipe. I'm very finnicky about my moles, but this is one that will definitely be made again.

Delish! We couldn't find ancho chiles and just used the chipotles, and it came out just fine. The mole has really complex flavors and is absolutely fabulous. A winner for both of our BFs!

Wonderful. I found that the sauce packs some heat -- some might want to experiment with the quantities of chiles if they prefer milder dishes.

really delicious sauce. i used soy milk instead of cream, and put in an extra spoonful of sugar. i couldn't find any ancho chiles, but the flavour was excellent anyway.

Dearest Apple Valley cook: sorry about your unhappy experience. The recipe says the chipotle chilis come canned IN a sauce, *sometimes* called "Adobo." It doesn't say use the sauce in the glaze. It says take the chilis out and put THEM in the glaze. Was it at least fun to try something new?

Rating: 1
My sauce tasted terrible! The recipe says you can buy adobo sauce, which I did, but it did not specify an amount to use so I guessed. I kept adjusting the sauce to taste and was never happy with it. I added extra garlic and onion. Even after cooking it down and adding the cream and brown sugar I was VERY dissapointed with the taste. Make sure you go to the trouble and buy the chiles and make the sauce from scratch instead of the ready-made adobo sauce.

Pleased with the pumpkin-y flavour mixed with the grilled chicken. Super autumn dish. Might add a bit more garlic to the mole but I am a garlic lover.
