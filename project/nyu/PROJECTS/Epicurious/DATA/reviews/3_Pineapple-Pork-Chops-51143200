We loved this! It was so simple and fresh, a great way to liven up a dreary winter day. Next time I will make more of the pineapple salsa.

I marinated the pork chops for about 5 hours and they were very tender. Unfortunately the only flavor from the marinade which penetrated the pork chop was the fish sauce which is not my favorite taste for a chop. I did save some of the marinade which after some more chopping we used for a salsa with the pork chops.This was okay.
