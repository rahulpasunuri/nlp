Needs TWO 9" round pans, not ONE! I am currently cleaning cake batter off the bottom of my oven! Definitely enough batter (and enough candied fennel) for two 9" pans.

I LOVED this cake! I made it on Tuesday night for some out of town 'foodie' friends. The four of us devoured most of the cake that evening and then I've been snacking on the leftovers every morning with my coffee. I normally don't like cake, but I love lemon flavor and I love fennel. So the marriage was fabulous in my opinion. While the cake itself was definately moist, I would add more buttermilk or maybe some lemon curd next time around to make it even more moist. But again, as far as cakes go, its not dry at all. Definitely worth a try. In my book it will be a revolving consistent dessert for sure!

The candied fennel was delicious, but I agree with other posts that more lemon would improve the cake itself. Mine also required almost an hour in the oven.

This was extreamly delicious and very dense. Really oil down the parchement because the fenel does like to stick to it. I slowly pealed the paper off while using my favorite metal spatula from All-Clad....just make sure it is dry. Even though the recipe called for a 2 inch strip to go around the sides, I skipped this and was very pleased with the results.

The flavor was great, but my cake definitely didn't look like the picture. And it fell apart when it was cut. I used more lemon zest because of the review that said it wasn't lemony enough, and I also used a touch of lemon juice. I think I should have thinned out my syrup with water before reducing. I also definitely should have oiled the wax paper more thoroughly; the candied fennel stuck to the paper. The baking time was forty minutes, and it probably could have stood to stay in longer. I wouldn't make it again unless I had a lot of time on my hands.

Lovely... A great cake for Easter. Mine turned out just like the photo. The flavors are subtle and complimentary. My husband passed on it, but is not a huge fan of fennel anyway. My children (2.5 and 8 mos), on the other hand, loved it.

Tried this last week for a small dinner party because I love lemon and it sounded interesting. It was OK--not lemony enough for me and not really worth the extra time to candy the fennel. It did turn out exactly like the picture but I won't bother making it again. My guests ate it but no rave reviews and no one asked for the recipe.

A very lovely, gorgeous looking cake, completely worth the extra time it takes to candy the fennel (and who would have thought candied fennel would be so good?). The lemon was subtle, so I wouldn't hesitate to put more zest in the second time around. One issue: the 30 minute bake time was nowhere near enough. I think the total bake time was closer to 60 minutes (I kept checking in at 10 minute increments, but forgot to keep track of how many I did!)
