Delicious, super easy, and a great way to do something different w leftover rice. I say you don't need to change a thing.

These are great and more impressive than the effort to cook them. U served them with a cumin-cauliflower soup and they worked nicely. I strongly recommend using "Italian style" or otherwise spiced breadcrumbs over white bread. Delicious and simple go-to recipe!

Enjoyed these a lot, but they could use a little more flair. ... I used 1/2 c flour instead of the breadcrumbs The result was a little bland (probably excellent paired with a spicy main, maybe hchili-rubbed baked fish), but EXCELLENT topped with hot chili sauce and a smigin of mayo. Next time, I plan to try doubling or maybe tripling the veggies (maybe adding roasted or sauteed bell peppers and a little summer squash) and a little bit of sharp white cheddar, grated.

I can't say I made this recipe exactly. I used the left overs from another recipe that I had made with summer squash and onions. I just added the bread crumbs and eggs. They came out perfect with a crispy crust and creamy on the inside. A great use for left over rice.

These were easy and tasted great. I made some changes...used chinese take-out rice(leftovers), instead of the carrots I used roasted red peppers and I also added some grated parmesan cheese. My 2 year old cleaned his plate!. Will be making these again.
