We used this recipe for a template, with many substitutions based on what we already had at home: - yellow onions for the leeks (more seasonal anyways) - hen of the wood mushrooms for the others (waaaayyy more delicious!) - thyme and other herbs for the tarragon Along with having super heady local bacon, this was by far the best stuffing I have ever eaten.

Excellent stuffing. I've made this for the past eight Thanksgivings always to rave reviews. I crave it throughout the year. Just wonderful.

For all the trouble and expense of this dish, I didn't think it was anything special. I cut the recipe in half and even though I added 10 oz. of chicken stock, it was still dry. Most of it was leftover after Thanksgiving dinner.

Made exactly as written. Some of my sausage fans missed the sausage but the bacon fans raved about it. One of my guests who doesn't eat stuffing loved it. All in all a great recipe.

I've made this every year since it came out in the magazine. I've modified it to suit the families tastes, with less mushrooms. This year I'm using a spicy venison sausage instead of the bacon. Looking forward to dinner...

One year later and I made this recipe again. This time I used the shitake mushrooms. Since the 2000 issue this recipe appeared, I have only used button mushrooms to cut the cost of this dish (it is expensive!) Man, were they good and added a rich taste and testure to this dish. Loved it...again.

Every year I want to try a new stuffing recipe from the Nov issue, but my family says " You are going to make the stuffing with the bacon right?" So I do. And it is always a huge hit. The second day it is amazing as well.

This recipe has been a staple with turkey every year since it came out in the magazine. This year it didn't turn out well at all. The reason: ME. I made TOO much and put it all in one roasting tray to bake. The broth and egg didn't get mixed in as well as it should have. It ended up being very dry. When you do this recipe right.....ITS AWESOME.

I am one of those people that likes to make different dishes each year to surprise my guests but since 2002 when I first made this stuffing I realized I couldn't give it up. Even my husband's father who doesn't like mushrooms loved this dish. I made the recipe exact except for a bit more broth and cooked it in the oven in a glass pyrex dish. The top is great when a bit crispy! Can't wait until Thanksgiving!

When I made this dish for Thanksgiving, I really, really wanted to like it - however, certain elements just didn't gel. The recipe was prepared as stated, except for leaving out the button mushrooms. The stuffing had a smoky flavor from the bacon that overpowered the dish. Also, to me the flavors and textures of the bacon and shiitake mushrooms didn't blend well. Finally, it took 14 oz. of chicken broth to make the stuffing sufficiently moist. The dish wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't make it again.

This has been the basis for many stuffings I've made over the past decade. It is one of my favorite recipes. Sometimes I'll use some onion in place of some of the leeks or more or less celery. I also like to use half white bread and half potato or egg bread.

I first made this in 1999 and have been requested to make it every year since. I also halve the recipe and make it vegetarian by omitting the bacon and using vegetable stock. My husband gladly watches the children during the long prep time!

Ever since the first time I made this dressing, it has become a "must have" at our Thanksgiving feast. I double the recipe so everyone gets a little to take home for leftovers. YUM!

Awesome! Everyone at my Thanksgiving table loved it and said it was the best stuffing they'd ever had. Though the preparation is long, the end result is worth it. Didn't have any leftovers!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I did not put it in the turkey (based on other reviews) and I am glad I didn't. I did cut back on the celery and the leeks and it came out just fine. Make sure you add enough broth or it can get dry quickly.

I have been making this since the magazine first published the recipe. It has become a family favorite! Watch your leeks, you don't want to saute them too much or they get mushy.

This stuffing was outstanding! I was dubious while making it, as the recipe called for so many leeks, and the smell of the leeks nearly knocked out my husband in the kitchen! However, when cooked, they were surprisingly mild and tasty together with the bacon and mushrooms. I used a combo of dried (reconstituted) shitakes (much stronger shitake flavor than fresh), oyster mushrooms, crimini, and regular white button mushrooms. The stuffing that was baked in a dish was absolutely phenomenal. I didn't like the stuffing that was stuffed in the turkey as much as it was somewhat mushy. Next year, I'll cook all the stuffing in a pan. Great recipe.

Definitely a keeper! Served for Thanksgiving and gave the recipe to all our guests.

Very good. Have made it every year since 1998. Unfortunately I lost the magazine.

Very good stuffing recipe. Especially if you're looking for something out of the ordinary for your Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago, our family has many vegetarians so I prepared it vegetable broth and a vegi-bacon product. I also had to substitute the bread for cornbread...an absolute must in our family ! Would I make it again? Possibly, but since there are still soooo many other great Bon Appetit and Gourmet stuffing recipes waiting for me to try them out....it might take years and years !! :)

My sister made this stuffing two years ago at Thanksgiving...it has been a regular at fall family get togethers since then. The different mushrooms add so much flavor, combined with the wonderful layers of bacon, leeks and tarragon, it is a spectacular new "comfort" food! I never liked stuffing until this dish....

Simply GREAT. I was cooking too many things at the same time, so...I forgot to add the tarragon and the eggs...Also, I didn't find buttermilk bread so I used cottage bread (white dense bread), and the grocery store was out of shiitake mushrooms so I used portabellos. I'll definetly repeat it someday. I'm sure I didn't used the exact amounts as listed, I know for sure that I used less celery...The message... the recipe is so good that it can't go wrong!!!

My husband said " Dont forget to give this four forks!!!!" I used crimini, oyster, shitake, baby portabelos and button mushrooms. EXQUISITE!

I've made this recipe three times now and each time my guests have raved about it. It's my best-ever turkey stuffing and I will continue to make it ad infinitum. Great!

Not bad, but too moist and not flavorful enough for my taste. Others at our Thanksgiving dinner liked it, though.

I made this recipe last year for my in-laws and they request I make it again this year. Glad I found it again!

I made this recipe last Christmas and the "avid vegetarian" could not help but binge on the bird. Now if that doesn't say how good this recipe is then I don't know what does.
