Made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful! Followed the recipe instructions and wouldn't change a thing!

Deliciously flavourful. Definitely a repeat!! Cooked chicken in its marinade, then set aside and warmed up the tomatoes/olives/feta until the feta became a bit creamy. Then I put the chicken back in for half a minute, enough to coat it, and served with grilled bread slices with olive oil, oregano, pepper and salt. So there were self-made bruschette too! YUM!

I'm always making new recipes, but this had become a household standard. I usually cube the chicken and add it to the marinade. I also only use 1/4 cup olive oil and saute the tomato mixture briefly before mixing it with the cooked chicken and stir in the feta at the end.

This dish is outstanding. I tented the chicken breasts and let them finish cooking in a warm oven while pouring some of the lemon/oil marinade into the warm pan; reduced a bit, and added low salt vegetable broth, a little salt & pepper. Added the tomatoes and olives just to heat up a bit before adding the feta cheese. Served the chicken with sauce and small roasted gourmet potatoes (another cook's suggestion). Yummy. Recipe is a keeper.

I have made this many times and always love. I just recently used this marinade and topping after brining from Foulproof Grilled Chicken (also this site). I tossed the cooked chicken in marinade and then topped with tomato/olive mixture (to which i added alot of fresh basil): It was Great!!!!

I made this instead of the Chicken Athena dish (also on this site) because I didn't have any Ouzo on hand. All in all, a good recipe. I followed other users recommendations to warm the feta mixture and then added a little plain yogurt to make it a little "saucy". This might've been my undoing, because the recipe seemed way too tart for my taste. I'll probably start stocking more liqueurs and just stick with the Chicken Athena.

This was a very good every day meal. I warmed the olive and grape mixture in a sautee pan with a bit of the dressing and added the feta last minute. Yummy

This was one of the most delicious chicken recipes I've found in awhile! I made this dish for myself and my boyfriend, making just two chicken breasts. I didn't have a meat pounder at the time I made this but regardless, it turned out great.

This is a wonderful and simple recipe. I serve it with the roasted potato skewers and zucchini that were included in the original menu.

Perfect recipe, I really liked it. I had fried potatoes with rosemary and marinated mushrooms on the side.

If you love Greek flavor then this is for you. I used three chicken breasts instead of six and doubled the tomatoes. I serve this dish with an arugula, goat cheese and caper salad with the same dressing but substitute oregano for chives, delicious.

Very good recipe, with easy prep. Marinated chicken only for about 45min, used dried oregano, and warmed toms/olives after chicken cooked. Served with greek salad and olive bread. YUM.

This is one of the best recipes I have found in awhile. It has become an entertaining favorite.

I Would definitely make this again, but rather than saute this, next time I would put it in the oven and bake it. It's a winner. My whole family devoured this when they made it for me on Mother's day!

Really delicious, easy and company-worthy. I did pound the chicken, and used fresh basil from the garden instead of oregano. I also warmed up the tomato mixture after removing the cooked chicken from the pan. Fabulous Mediteranean flavors, perfect with orzo pasta salad. Enjoy!

Excellent Flavor. Do sautee the tomatoes first, then add them along with the Feta to the reserved sauce.

This was an absolutely delicious meal that was quick and easy to prepare. Orzo pasta tasted great with the chicken and sauce.

Rating: 3
So simple and so delicious. Like other reviewers, I didn't pound the chicken. As a result, saute time was longer than the recipe indicated: 10 min on each side. I also used dried oregano instead of fresh. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Unexpected guests turned up for dinner and everyone loved this. Will definitely make this again.

This recipie turned out wonderfully and everyone enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again, started the evening off well.

I have to admit that I don't have a meat pounder, I didn't have fresh oregano, I didn't have kalamata olives, and I didn't have fresh lemon juice. I used a can of black olives, dried oregano, and realemon, but this was still fabulous and my husband loved it. I also heated up the tomatos/feta, which I think made a difference. I'm sure if I had the fresh ingredients, it would've been 1000 times better, but I have 2 babies, and can't nip out to the store frequently.

What a really delicious, easy dish. I did add some chopped sun dried tomatoes to the feta/olive topping. Served it with roasted heirloom potatoes and fresh green beans. Excellent dinner!

Just made this dish again, since trying it for the first time in the summer of 03 I have paired it with various sides and this time I tried ravioli glazed in brown butter and balsamic vinegar - it was the best yet!

This recipe is so easy!! Not a bunch of pans to dirty, so clean up is easy. Also, I didn't marinate but for 15 minutes, but it came out great anyway. Next time I will marinate, but if your pressed for time, it's not completely necessary. I also added sundried tomatoes, packed in oil and herbs to the recipe, about a 1/2 a cup which truly put the icing on the cake!! My boyfriend loved it!! I made bow tie pasta and drizzled some of the dressing on it as a side. Paired with a nice chardonnay, gourmet in a minute!! Definitely would make again

This is not the first time I've been let loose in a kitchen so you'd think I would read the entire recipe before starting. I didn't reserve any of the marinade for the tomato mixture and I didn't have the time to marinade for 3 to 6 hours. Oh, and I didn't pound the chicken breasts. So I had to adjust the cooking time. I also added the marinade to the pan a little at a time while cooking the chicken and it turned out FANTASTIC! Maybe next time I'll follow the recipe as written to see the difference. We served it with Concannon Chardonnay.

This was good but I think next time I will heat up the tomato mixtue. 10 times better the next day for lunch when heated.

I just made this for a small dinner party and it was a hit! I was confused as to what 'side' I should pair with it. My husband LOVES sweet potatoes and I'm pregnant so the thought of sweet, meat, cheese, salty, etc. all made sense to me. TG my guests agreed! Everyone cleaned their plates! I also served a yummy crusty bread. I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to beat the chicken. It was still super delish! I rec' using organic chicken breasts. YUM!!!

This is a terrific recipe! I've made it for dinner many times and serve with crusty bread and salad. I have also served this as an appetizer - so far everyone loves it.

Really nice dish. I warmed the tomato-olive mixture, as suggested by other reviewers, and will do so again. Topped the chicken with it, then sprinkled the feta over all. Next time I'll try basil instead of oregano. It's a beautiful entrée.

We loved this. I used basil instead of oregano and pan browned the chicken breasts. Then I coating each with feta cheese and put in the oven until it melted. I also marinated the olive and tomato mixture in balsamic vinegar and served it warm over the chickent breasts.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. The taste is fabulous and the presentation great! I've both sauteed and grilled - either way its terrific. I too have made the entire menu - the sauteed zucchini and the potatoes. Excellent!

A wonderful dish. Makes a great impressive company dish. Our children even requested this again.

"A keeper" from the guys in my house. Minor variations-used fresh mexican lime juice vs lemon and dried oregano leaves for the fresh herb. Made flour tortilla wraps with the leftovers-they liked these almost more than the original dinner.

My family loves this chicken-we make the entire menu along with the grilled zucchini and the roasted red potatoes. If I can't figure out what to do with chicken, I reach for this recipe. A keeper

Delicious! Grilled the marinated chicken (didn't pound them thin)--great meal to serve at a small barbeque since everything can be prepared ahead of time. Kids just ate the marinated/grilled chicken which meant more of the topping for the adults! Served with the Mixed Green Salad with Pecans, Goat cheese and dried cranberries from the same issue! YUM!

My whole family loved this (inc. 11 and 14 year old boys). I did toss the tomatoes and olives in the pan briefly to warm and would do so again. Will definately make again - in fact I plan to marinate and freeze a few batches of the chicken for quick dinners on lazy or rushed days.

Made this for a family gathering and it was okay. I found putting the cold feta, tomato and olive didn't enhance the chicken. The chicken marinade was good though - I would probably make this again and lightly heat the tomato and olives before mixing in the feta.

This was tasty but not spectacular. Because it uses uncomplicated ingredients, though, it's good for a weeknight meal.

in one word - YUM. easy to omit olives for those (like my bf) who don't like them, but SO GOOD as is. also good with basil instead of oregano (when you can't find fresh o).

This was delicious. Since it reminded us of souvlaki, I bet leftovers would be great stuffed in pita bread.

Delicious! I adapted this recipe to be more suitable for fall weather. After browning the chicken, I tossed the olives and tomatoes in the pan and sauted them for about 10 minutes to soften. I added the chicken back to the pan and finished the dish in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. Sprinkled with crumbled feta and served with green beans tossed with roasted garlic oil. The colors stayed bright and the flavors blended perfectly. Enjoy!

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I prepared the chicken 9 hours prior to dinner and it was excellent. The fresh oregano and lemon juice is a must for this dish. A keeper!

To Cape Cod: If you can't find pitted Kalamatas, it's very easy - and quick - to do yourself. Using the heel of your hand, just smash the olive with the broad side of your knife (the same way you would with a clove of garlic) The pit will become exposed and you can literally just pop it out! Hope this helps - BTW - loved this recipe! Served with roasted baby potatoes - yum!

This is my all time favorite dish this summer. I grilled the chicken breasts instead and I didn't bother flattening them since I didn't have time. The flavors of this dish are so incredible. Absolutely fabulous, easy dish!

Delicious. Have made it twice, and can't wait to make it again. Served it with grilled summer squash, and grilled zucchini brushed with garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper. The flavor combination was awesome. Great low carb dinner!

Wonderful! The tapenade of olives, tomatoes, and feta really makes this dish special. EASY to make, but it tastes as if it took much longer. A keeper.

We stuck to the recipe and found it a little too salty. I would make this again..however, next time I think I will stay away from the Kalamatas and use a little less salt when called for.

Dont use so much oregano! I used basil instead, and instead of the salty kalamata olives i used black olives. Still enjoyable.

I added fresh cucumbers to the tomatoes and feta cheese. It was excellent.

This was very good. The marinade made the chicken moist and flavorful and the tomato, olive and cheese salsa gave it some zing. A fast and easy weeknight meal if you can get the chicken in the marinade the night before.

This combination of flavors is as common at our house as mashed potatoes. We love it so I always have the ingredients on hand. This was good but I think I will stick to my normal Chicken Souvlakia with Tzatziki and greek salad in future.
