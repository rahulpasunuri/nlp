This is one of my favorite recipes EVER! They are so delicious and everyone I cook them for is hooked. I make mine small (about 7 to a fry pan and 28 total). I would have never thought to put sweet potatoes together with kimchi. Thank you for a great recipe.

These took A LOT longer than 40 minutes to make, but they were well worth it. This was my first kimchi experience. The cakes are amazingly delicious! I recommend making the suggested soy vinegar dipping sauce with it!! :D

This was a total winner, even for a Hannukah Dinner. Served with a type of applesauce I made with ripe pineapple, lycees and cocount (drained), a cranberry jam and a dollop of marscapone. As a gluten intolerent I substituted the flour for a gluten free flour without any problem. Will make many times again.

Although this recipe sounds absolutely delicious (I'm a huge fan of kimchi and pancakes!), mine didn't turn out so well. Perhaps my pancakes were too thick (although I tried to make them as thin as possible) or the heat too high, but they turned out to be half cooked. I think next time I'll cook the potatoes first and then incorporate them into the mix. I also found cutting them into julienne a tedious process. Granted I'm not the most experienced cook out there. I think for those sticking with the original recipe, using a food processor or a grater makes more sense and probably yields a mixture that will cook faster. I will try this recipe again as it definitely has potential, just differently. I should also mention that I used a mandolin to slice one potatoe into a really fine julienne and grated the second one to speed up the process.

I used (actually my husband who I asked him to be my slave of cooking that day) Food Processor to slice sweet potato and it was really easy. I was scared since I ran out of all purpose flour and had to use wholewheat flour instead. It turned out really good (although we didn't make a lot of them) but guests at the party loved them so much.

These are great and one of the best make ahead recipes that I use. They are liked by people who don't care for the ingredients. Truly more than the sum of the parts.

Delicious. Made the recipe as instructed, with no extra eggs, but less chili. They are kind of like hash browns instead of pancakes, which I like because they get super crispy. Great and easy appetizer.

Delicious. Mixture seemed a bit too loose, so I added an extra egg.

Yum, latkes with attitude! I will definitely make them again. On the minus side, like all my latkes, they were soggy. So in future, will try 2 different things: 1/ Like the previous reviewer, make them more Korean pancake-like or 2/ try frying longer to get them crispier in a latke-sort-of-way.

My mom makes these pancakes for a quick lunch and my husband absolutely loves them. I didn't have serrano chiles or scallions, so they were omitted. I added more flour and used water to create more of pancake consistency. They turned out wonderful. My husband and I gobbled them up for an early Sunday dinner.
