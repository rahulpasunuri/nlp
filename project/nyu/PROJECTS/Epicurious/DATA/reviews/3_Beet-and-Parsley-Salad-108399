If you enjoy beets, this one is not for you. A waste of good ingredients that have the opportunity to be put to better use.

I was skeptical to make this since I am not a fan of beets. I was glad I took the chance! It helps to get gresh beets from the farmer's market, but the combination of the crisp beets, parsley and a little sugar was wonderful! I will certainly make this again!
