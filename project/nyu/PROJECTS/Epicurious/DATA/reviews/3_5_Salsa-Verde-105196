This was delicious! Served it with the Herbed Baked Sea Bass but it would be good on anything. Left out the chives because I didn't have them but I'm sure it would be even better with them. I tasted it with bruschetta and could have eaten it all that way. My guests almost liked the bowl clean!!

Salsa Verde doesn't have to be Mexican. The Italian translation of "green sauce" is also salsa verde and from the ingredients here, I would say this was supposed to be an Italian sauce....capers, olive oil...

No review yet, just a comment for 07/21/01 D.E.Folts from Milwaukee, WI ! Salsa Verde translates to "Green Sauce", ergo; Salsa Verde! When in doubt of the meaning of a language, go to http://ets.freetranslat ion.com/ for a translation. I find this very useful as I'm not versatile in other languages.

We loved this with the Herb Baked Sea Bass. I used all the oil the recipe called for and it was perfect, like a salad dressing.

Three forks only because I had to cut back the oil so severely - I used about 1/3 cup - just added slowly until it reached a sauce consistency. It was wonderful, especially with the roasted seabass. I had lots left over - i'm thinking it'll be nice over potatoes tonight...

With the Sea Bass!! Yes!

Excellent, but it definitely needs only 1/2 cup olive oil at most rather than the 1 cup the recipe calls for.

it was okay, definitely don't subsitute dried spices for the fresh ones, better to skip adding thyme, rosemary if you don't have it fresh.

I served this with the herbroasted sea bass recipe here and it was awesome! One of my favorite dishes! I took the advice of others here and halved the amount of olive oil, and it was perfect. You could probably use even a little bit less. If you are unsure about what to cook tonight, cook THIS! You won't be disappointed.

I make this often, and always to a delighted company. I use is at a dip for crusty french bread (minus the capers), and on the sea bass. There have been some comments regarding the amount of oil in this sauce, so I'd recommend halving the amount at first and add until you're satisfied (I prefere the large quantity, but many find it a bit heavy). This is one recipe that will never leave my shelves. -t

This is a GREAT sauce, salsa, tapenade...what ever you want to call it....just call it delish! I served this with the Sea Bass as recommended, but also used it as a dipping sauce for homemade bread. Didn't last long!

Used this recipe with the Herb Baked Sea Bass and it was perfect. The combination of the mild fish with these herbs, oil and lemon juice make for a wonderful entree. I don't care what you call it, just understand that it is simple to make and the perfect accent to for this dish.

there has been some debate on the naming of this recipe. some think it is misnamed, and is disagree. in spanish, salsa means "sauce" and verde means "green". i think the name of this sauce is logical, because of the green herbs and its...sauciness. :o)

Oh please!! get along. Some of us are just learning!!! I love this recipe. With the salsa that is left over I put in my fritata (sp?)with the rest of my left overs and it makes that dish too. Yum Yum.

To the cook below: salsa is the Spanish word for sauce; it is not synonymous with Mexican salsa as you know it. This sauce recipe has everything to do with the Spanish (as in Spain) kitchen. If you weren't aware...Mexico is not the only Spanish-speaking country on earth.

while this might be a fine condiment, it has absolutly nothing to do with salsa or the mexican kitchen...why call it salsa?
