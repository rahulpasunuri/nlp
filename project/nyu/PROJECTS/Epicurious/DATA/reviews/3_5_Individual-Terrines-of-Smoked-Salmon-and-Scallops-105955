I've wanted to make this for a long time and finally did but what a disappointment! I made sure to pat dry the chopped scallops and cucumber before mixing them but the terrines still turned out watery. It was a total waste of good and not exactly inexpensive ingredients.

Living in Cairo, scallops are not available, so I substituted them with a jar of marinated oysters, it worked perfectly. For the sour cream mixture, I added little of chopped fresh dill, shallots, and few capers. Also reduced the amount of tarragon, mustard and cucumber called for. I stopped at the second layer,and served them on slices of sour bread! Great hit

Had this at a dinner party a few years ago and made it myself for New Year's Eve. Got rave reviews.

I thought I liked tarragon so I made this recipe as written. I was wrong on both counts. The tarragon taste is absolutely overwhelming, almost metallic. Definitely-cut down on the tarragon. The sea scallops and the cucumber tasted nice and fresh. Maybe it was the smoked salmon I used, but it was a bit too strong for the other ingredients and tended to drown them out. I also found the terrines to be a little wetter than I would have liked. In short, I had high hopes, but they weren't realized. Lots of potential, pretty to look at, tasted nowhere as good as it should have.

EXCELLENT! I made it for the first course of Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. After reading the previous reviews, I decided to cut the tarragon in half which was perfect, still had a great tarragon flavor but not overpowering (if you don't like tarragon, do not make this recipe as it is very much the featured flavor). It also occured ot me that the reason people were running short on ingredients is the variance in the size of the dish used and also in the thickness of the salmon - get a pound of thinly sliced or if using a thicker cut, only put the salmon on the top and bottom omitting the middle layer. Also I cut the peice for the bottom of the dish (which ends up being th etop) first using a cookie cutter of the right size for my dish, then pieced together the other layers as they aren't as visible. Its a stunning dish!

I wanted so much to love this recipe -- it's such a beautiful and impressive presentation for guests. But the taste just didn't measure up. The tarragon flavor was too strong and the taste of the scallops was lost, as another reviewer also noted. Most of my guests finished their plates, but we all agreed that it wasn't worth making again.

We made these for a New Year's day lunch and they were just lovely. A great combination of flavors and textures. I can see why ingredient amounts might be a concern. I used 1/4 lb of smoked salmon and about 10 sea scallops. We were able to fill 3 of our ramekins which are larger than 3/4 cup. It is certainly easy enough to do and it can all be made in advance of serving.

I really do not like Dijon or mustard of any kind, any suggestions for substitutions or could it be left out?

I found the ingredient amounts in this recipe were inaccurate. I ended up running back to the grocery store to buy additional smoked salmon and scallops to complete the terrines. They turned out very nice, and my guests enjoyed them, but I would suggest buying a bit more salmon and scallops to avoid my pitfall.

I made this for a "sit-down dinner" for 25 people, and I was amazed how easy it was and how much I appreciate it being able to make this dish a day ahead of time. Your instructions were simply and the combination of scallops and smoked salmon were delicious. Thank you!!!!!! I'll make this dish over and over again. It's a beautiful dish for the holidays.

Looked beautiful, everyone agreed. I thought it was okay, my in-laws seemed to really like it, and my husband didn't like it and didn't finish his. He thought it was too creamy and that the taste of the scallops was lost. Still, I'd make it again for an impressive and do-ahead appetizer.

Made this as a first course of a special birthday dinner. It was delicious, easy and made for a beautiful presentation. Instead of serving them over greens, I served them over a circle of thinly sliced cucumbers and sprinkled chopped tarragon around the plate. The leftover vinaigrett was great over salads the next day.

Served this as the first course at a wine tasting dinner party and it was a huge success. My husband rated it "a keeper". Simple to put together, elegant to serve and most importantly, delicious. Will definitely make it again.

Would not hesitate to make again. Used it at Christmas and an Alsacian wine dinner to great raves.

This was an outstanding start to our Christmas dinner and got wonderful comments from each of our 14 guests. We used large muffin tins instead of individual souffle dishes and that worked perfectly. It was a bit difficult to get enough perfectly cut salmon rounds for all 14 terrines so we simply used the perfect ones on the bottom of each mold to ensure the tops looked wonderful when unmolded. Using odd sized pieces in the remaining layers was not a problem. Can't wait for an excuse to make this again!

This recipe was so easy and elegant to make. I did it for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit, although I had to improvise at the last minute. I substituted the smaller bay scallops for sea scallops because the sea scallops were a small fortune. Then I had every cook's holiday nightmare: missing a key ingredient at the eleventh hour, and all the stores are closed! We didn't have the smoked salmon, so I made it without (although I think it would have been fabulous with it). It made for a lighter, very refreshing "salad", which was perfect because it came after a heavy meal of lasagna, prime rib, mashed potatoes and a vegetable. I also eliminated the tarragon vinegar and used white wine vinegar, instead, because I find tarragon can be too overpowering at times. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I served this after the soup for Christmas dinner. It made a beautiful presentation. Our guests loved it. I plan to keep this with the holiday recipes.
