I love beets, I love tuna steaks, I did not love this recipe. Followed recipe to a T. Trying to figure out why this was rated so high. The flavors were well balanced but the final dish did not impress. I like the idea of tuna gyros, will look for other recipes.

A great recipe and easy to make too. I am not sure I understand the beets in the sauce. They are tasty and we enjoyed using the beet leaf as a side dish, but I could not figure out the purpose of the beets in the sauce. Maybe someone could explain this to me. Also I would recommend making more of the cucumber sauce, seems like we need to make more for left-overs. One sandwich per person is enough (but it is hard to resist a second one). Thank you for this recipe.

This is incredible mix of flavors. I would recommend putting a chopped chili in the cucumber mix, just for some extra heat.

This was very tastey and a nice change from lamb and chicken. I didn't use the beets and the yogurt tahini sauce was still a perfect accompaniment.
