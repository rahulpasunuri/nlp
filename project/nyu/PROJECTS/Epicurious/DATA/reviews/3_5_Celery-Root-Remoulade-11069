Just for the record, for those concerned about the authenticity of this recipe, my copy of the Larousse Gastronomique has a recipe for celeri remoulade that includes cornichons, capers, and fines herbes (which includes tarragon).

The sauce was very easy to whip together and with the food processor and a big sharp knife, the celery root was easy to whittle down to size. I think maybe the sauce needs a little oomph but I'm not sure what. My guests liked it but it wasn't raved over.

I thought it was very good. I had halved the recipe, and did not have tarragon in the house, it was still very good.

Outstanding! I used salted, capers, rinsed, for a more intense layer of flavor and it was absolutely delightful. Pennsylvania, you're right -- and you're wrong. It's true that the classic recipe does not contain the items you mentioned. But we French chefs are not that narrow minded. We'll try anything that sounds reasonably good at least once! That is the delight, heart and soul of a true chef-artiste, and it's what separates the real chef from a short-order cook. Even a newcomer to the culinary arts can have wonderful ideas when it comes from the heart!

Excellent recipe, six dinner guests asked for the recipe, will make again. I have had celri temoulade often in French restaurants, this was as good or better!

Although the flavors of this recipe sound appealing no self respecting french cook would put capers, cornichons or tarragon in celerie remoulade. The only proper way to make this dish is to soften your jullienned celery root in salt and lemon juice(1/2 a lemon per lb. of root) and then mix with good quality mayonnaise, dijon mustard and white pepper to taste.
