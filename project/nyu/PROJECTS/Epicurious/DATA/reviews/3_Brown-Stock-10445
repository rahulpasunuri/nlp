Good recipe. It needed cloves, fresh thyme and a couple of leeks. I didn't pour off the fat, either. I added it and then chilled and skimmed the stock. That way it retained all its flavor.

Very good beef stock recipe. I will make this my standard.

Great - and above all - simple.....would a few cloves enhance the flavor?
