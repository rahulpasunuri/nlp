I only added 3 sticks of butter to the buttercream and it was awesome. I think 4 sticks would be a little too over the top. Fantastic dessert.

Meringue was excellent, but the buttercream was over the top. (I used Plugra butter.) There was too much buttercream for the amount of meringue, and that the layers were too thick. Would suggest 1)using about 1/3 less buttercream on the cake, or 2)making another layer or two of the meringue.

I made this dessert back in 1996 for a bridal shower to rave reviews. Just thought about it again, and thank goodness Epicurious makes it so easy to locate recipes! 7 years later...
