The boyfriend love this. We love blue cheese. I think I used an heirloom potato. Good for summer potlucks or dinner parties. Goes good with fish and is filling.

My mother-in-law served this and it was excellent. I have yet to make it myself, but it would make a great summer salad

This is a winner. I used Maytag blue cheese because I happened to have some in the house. The dressing is insanely tasty and is the key to this dish. I will try it with other greens but did use the cress. Everyone loved it and the little taste that was leftover was just as good the next day. I will be making this all summer long.

Family favorite! Though I do make it more healthy by subbing bacon for the watercress LOL!

Delicious! I made this for my non blue cheese loving family and they loved it. I added halved cherry tomatoes for some color,

I make this salad no less than 6 times per year. It goes great with everything from grilled lobster to hamburgers.

This salad is delicious! I made it last night and it was a huge hit. Instead of grilling the potato slices I broiled them in the oven. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and did 1/2 watercress and 1/2 arugula. This recipie is delicious and easy to make...I will definitely make it again!

This is always a hit and very simple to make most of it ahead of time. Recommend it for your next cook out!!

This is an excellent side dish for grilled meats. I changed it up quite a bit adding tomatoes and olives to the salad, served on a large platter and it was a lovely presentation and received raves from my guests. Very simple as well - will make many more times!

This is too good. Made it for company, who does not like blue cheese, but they tryed it and they raved. I grilled my potatoes til they were nice and brown from the grilling.

Great grilling side dish. Have substituted feta for blue cheese and parsley for watercress (for pickier eaters) with equal success.

Delicious! I substitute arugula for the watercress (per a recipe from Cook's Illustrated). Also, I par boil the potatoes, cut into 2" cubes & then skewer them and grill them on skewers which is much easier than messing w/ individual potato slices on the grill. Otherwise, don't change a thing.

Made again with a different group of people. (My family had loved it). Rave reviews all around

To the cook in Chandler: AJ's Fine Foods always has watercress, FYI. This recipe is absolutely delicious, and I'm not a big blue cheese fan! This salad works really well with the 'Barbecued Cowboy Steaks' recipe on this website. I used Fingerling potatoes instead of the red potatoes, and they were a perfect substitute. This salad also matches nicely with a red wine.

Make this often, without the watercress as it is hard to find

This was fab!! Par boiling the potato slices for 16-18 min's is perfect. Even good left over the next day. Have made several times, well worth the grilling effort!!!!!

Really yummy! I used baby red potatoes, parboiled for 5 minutes, then cut them in half and placed them on the grill for probably 20 minutes, turning fairly frequently, and keeping a close eye on them. One small suggestion - do not pour the dressing over the salad unless you plan to eat it immediately. My French chef buddy told me that the vinegar will "cook" the salad if left to sit there...(the french have a way with words!)

Great summertime side dish that really impresses. Grilling with wood chips is highly recommended as it imparted a smoky flavor to the potatoes. I served the potatoes over baby spinach as the watercress looked anemic at the market and it was simply wonderful. Do serve on a platter for a beautiful presentation.

Loved this dish and got rave reviews...will definitely make again!

A very forgiving recipe. Couldn't locate sherry wine vinegar so I used White wine vinegar. Overboiled potatoes and no charcoal for grill so I finished them in the oven. Initially forgot to blend oil with vinegar, added last when I realized the goof. Yes, I was drinking wine and trying to get lobsters ready at the same time. Served it with lobster boil, lobster stuffed tenderloin and prosciutto wrapped asparagus. Everyone loved it. I can't stop thinking about it these last few days. What a great flavor combination and not as heavy as you would think with the bleu cheese sauce.

I make this all the time with rave reviews. To make it less labor intensive, I peel & slice russets, toss them with olive oil and S&P and put them in foil packets on the grill for about 30-40 min. depending on the heat. (I also spray the foil with PAM before putting the potatoes in.)Flip the packets half way through. That way you can eliminate the boiling & mess on the grill. Totally easy!!

This is fabulous. Have made it several times (quite an elegant summer dish) and each time have had requests for the recipe!

Good salad with a twist and it keeps the kitchen cool in the simmer weather. While no one said anything about the dish, it was totally eaten by my family. Later on I got requests to make it again. Recommended

My husband and I thought this dish was delicious. We did not have watercress available so we used spinach.

Wowed em at a July 4th supper --doubled the recipe for a crowd and used some purple and yukon potatoes with the reds. Not quick but absolutely distinctive -- your guests will remember you for it.

Awesome! I made this recipe for my Supper Club girlfriends - they all loved it! And the presentation is outstanding!

This one was so good we had to repeat it the next day. A little labor intensive, but well worth the effort.

Very good! I actually roasted the potatos under my broiler for easier prep and got great reviews - I'm making it again this weekend for a family get together.

This was really delicious. It's a little labor intensive to grill the potatoes, but the results are worth it. My husband raved to friends about it, so it looks like I'll be making it again very soon!

This is a sophisticated side dish that will elevate barbeque fare. I served it on a platter, rather than in a bowl, for a knock-out presentation along with racks of ribs.

Good flavor and easier to make with baby red potatoes so there's no slicing involved (also cook for less time in boilig water).

Omitted the watercress as it wasn't available and added chopped Kalamata olives to the vinaigrette. Easy to make & nice presentation - it got rave reviews!
