I've made this many times, and it's always well-received. If you have leftovers, save it - it's even better the next day. Delicious!

I've made this several times in several ways, and to me the mint makes this salad a standout - basil, parsley, etc. just aren't the same. I like it as written. My friends grab up potential leftovers at cookouts and potlucks to top grilled fish or chicken.

Very easy and tasty. I subbed basil for the mint (neither one of us cares for mint). I added an avocado, as well. The salt seems like too much, but when the dish is finished, it's perfect. Great salad. Give it a shot.

Very refreshing. Used regular cucumbers, seeded, cut up and drained for a hour. Added vinegar, sugar and salt. Let marinate for a few hours Seeded roma tomatoes, added red onion, mint and oil. Let marinate a few hours. Combined them at serving time. Really a very good salad.

Made this salad to accompany some BBQ, as suggested by the Bon Appetit book, and parsley mashed potatoes. Did half champagne vinegar, half red wine, added a bit of diced jalapeno, and honestly forgot the oil which I didn't realize til halfway through dinner. Everyone agreed that the salad tasted just fine, and if you can leave out 3 tablespoons of (albeit delicious) fat, then why not? Will definitely make again.

Made it with white wine vinegar (didn't have red) and parsley instead of mint. Was good and refreshing but a little too vinegary for me.

This salad is as delicious as it looks.We chopped the tomatoes without seeding them, and it was fine. Sometimes we use mint leaves and sometimes not - good both ways! This recipe is a great way to enjoy summer tomatoes from the Farmers' Market!

I cannot believe how good this salad is, especially when it is so easy to make. I am not traditionally a huge fan of vegetable salads but this was delicious. The only change I made was using white wine vinegar instead of red. I will definitely be putting this recipe into my rotation. A perfect side to almost any grilled meat or fish.

I love this salad, it has made it into my list of "go-to" recipes. I don't add the mint (can't stomach it anymore after an unfortunate bout of "morning" sickness). I also use less salt then called for, maybe a quarter teaspoon? I don't really measure anything and it always turns out great, such an easy thing to throw together. If you don't have an hour to marinade the cucumbers it turns out fine too.

This is always a favorite. My husband will eat the whole bowl if left alone- and he's not a salad fan. I've made it at least 10 times with the following changes: substitute white wine vinegar for the red, plus 2 Tablespoons of balsalmic vinegar. Swap basil for mint and add some feta. It's still perfect without the feta for non-dairy types. Nothing says summer like this salad!

I make a variation of this that is maybe a bit Thai inspired. Instead of the red wine vinegar, I use rice vinegar, sugar, a squeeze of lime juice and some cilantro with the mint. I also add some cubed, uncooked firm tofu for an easy main- dish salad. Such a great summer recipe!

I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and this salad turned out just awesome! I used red wine vinegar instead of white, added 1/4 cup of parsley (as well as 1/2 cup of mint), soaked the red onion in ice water (a trick I didn't know about before and it dumbed down the harshness of the onion just perrrrfectly!), and added small cubes of mozzarella cheese. I brought it to a lobster cookout and it was a perfect compliment to the main dinner. Nice and light on a hot day too! It got rave reviews from everyone that ate it and there was ZERO left over.

I've been making something like this for years. I add avocado to give it a creamy goodness and leave out the mint. Goes great with grilled steak or chicken.

Rating: 3
The recipe is good as is, but I have a few suggestions. The red wine vinegar spoils the color of the cucumbers - instead use white wine or champagne vinegar. No need to marinate them- unless you want pickles. Also, cut the vinegar down to 3 tablespoons and the oil to 2. I've made this with mint or parsley or basil, depending on the rest of the meal. It always turns out great.

This was SO good with a lemon & herb marinated grilled chicken. I soak the onions in ice water for a couple hours to sweeten them up a bit so even onion-fearing folks like it! Perfect summer salad. I saw the mozzarella tip and tried it with feta the second time. Yum!

This reminds me of my grandmother's cucmber and onion salad but with a bit more zip and color. Use any leftovers to make a mixed salad the next day as a lunch. The tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions taste great and the leftover "liquid" works as a salad dressing.

I made this exactly as written and we enjoyed it very much as an accompaniment to salmon teriyaki. It's light and refreshing. As you might suspect, it does not keep well, so I recommend not making more than you can consume on the first day.

This one's definately a keeper! Everyone asked for the recipe. Based on other reviewer's comments I made a few modifications. I added 1/4 cup of parsley, 2 TBS of balsamic vinegar and almost doubled the salt. I combined all of the ingredients, except for the tomatoes & olive oil, and tossed it often for 2 hours. I marinated the tomatoes (half red, half yellow) in extra red wine vinegar, sugar and salt for 2 hours then drained them (reserving the liquid for soup stock) I combined all ingredients after 2 hours so the tomatoes wouldn't get mushy. I was a little worried it was going to be bland but after marinating for 6 hours it was awesome. I was surprised how subdued the mint was. Served in a large black ceramic bowl, several people commented on how delicious it looked before they even tasted it. The yellow tomatoes really add to it visually. Everyone was grateful I made a double batch!

This is a great, simple, and easy recipe that is easy to adapt. I have used dried dill and parsley in place of the mint and it was delicious. It is a perfect no cook side dish. I will agree it is a little "juicy" but still delicious. This is a definitely a keeper.

Made this dish and did like the cucumber-mint combo, but I don't think I would make it again. Maybe I should have used the English hothouse cucumbers instead???

I was looking for a nice, summery salad to take to a cookout, and I chose this based on ingredients and reviews. I'm really glad that I listened to you folks; this got rave reviews from everyone! The mint was a delicious and unexpected flavor...it made this salad really special, whereas using the "expected" basil would have been good, but not very original. I went ahead and added fresh mozzarella; used a pint of grape tomatoes, halved; used regular cukes instead of the expensive English hothouse, and subbed white wine vinegar for the red wine....all this based on reviewer suggestions. Fabulous! This one is a keeper! Thank you!

blech. i was really disappointed in this dish, which is really too bad because it sounded awesome. (1) way too much liquid. i dumped some and then added some chilled cooked couscous to try and soak up some of the juice, but then realized that (2) the marinates, when combined, are just way too sweet. not enough vinegar and too much mint. so of course then i had couscous soaked in lackluster juices. not to mention (3) the tomatoes, which were beautiful to begin with, could not stand up to all of the mixing. they mushed out.

Rating: 3
Yum. The only change was to add some chopped avacado. I think the red wine vinegar is acidic/sweet enough and should not be messed with. This is a truly refreshing summer bounty salad. Served with broiled chicken breasts stuffed with spinach soufflee and roasted red taters. Doesnt get too much better.

I have made this salad twice. I made a few changes the second time which I think improve it. White wine vinegar instead of red. Half red onion and half sweet vidalia onion. Used firm, fresh, "ordinary" cucumbers (peeled); no need to buy the expensive English cukes. Half mint and half parsley. Small cubes of fesh mozzarella make a nice addition too.

This was really tasty and I was surprised that the mint actually shone through the vinegar as I thought it might overwhelm. Defintely let it stand for an hour or two before serving to really develop flavours. I also drained off some of the liquid before serving and topped with a little extra fresh mint. Served with the Lemony Potato salad (also from this site, wonderful!) and a marinated butterflied leg of lamb - yum!

I have to say that I am not a big cucumber fan and I tried this recipe mainly because I grow chocolate mint in my garden. I loved it! The best cucumber salad recipe I have eaten! Don't worry about marinating the salad too long, I had leftovers and the salad was just as good, maybe even better, on day two and three.

This was an excellent addition for a summer meal as the tomatos and cucumbers start rolling in. I served it with Lamb and it complemented it very well. I only had chocolate mint in my garden, but honestly it really tasted great! I used white sweet onion in place of the red onion as red onion can be harsh on the breath when eaten raw!

I made this last night & served with broiled flounder brushed with lemon pepper butter. We really liked it. I thought I had a little more mint in my herb garden (I've been pulling it up by the roots because it's taking over)! I had a couple sprigs that I used. I felt it was enough 'mint' flavor, not sure if I'd add the entire amount next time (I halfed the recipe).Very nice salad to serve with just about anything!!

I went to my friend's house for lunch and she served this salad as a side dish with chilled salmon with dill sauce and herb chicken. What a fantastic lunch! A second helping of this salad was a must! Two days later, I was having a summer bbq at my house and decided to make it because I enjoyed it so much. It is easy to make and the taste is cool and refreshing for summertime! Even if you do not like mint, use it; it is worth sticking to the recipe and being adventurous.

First let me say, I'm not a mint person. I read the reviews from others who said that the mint flavor wasn't too overpowering, and decided instead of substituing another herb I would try the recipe just once with the mint. I used slightly less mint than the recipe called for (about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup) and it was terrific. Next time I'll probably even add more mint. It adds a very refreshing taste to the salad. Definitely a summer salad. Great with the Sausage and Tomato Quiche found here on Epicurious.

Every time I make this salad I am asked for the recipe. It is easy, flavourful, and goes with so many different foods. If you are not a great fan of mint, start with a little and add more to taste. One change, add very little salt, it draws the water out of the cucumbers and makes it watery. Quarter teaspoon suffices.
