I've been making this occasionally ever since I first read the recipe in Bon Appétit. I love the way the raisin flavor blends with tea flavors from the steeping. However, when I first made it, it was basically a raisin brick -- fruit with just a bit of batter binding it. I now usually half the quantity of raisins for a more breadlike result. It seems to be very flexible if you want to adjust fruit amounts to suit yourself.

It's kind of a cross between bread and cake. It was easy to make and tasted really good (though you must like raisins). I couldn't get candied orange peel so I substituted dried apricots instead. The other reviewers were correct -- it's done in 50 minutes.

This is certainly easy to make. I made my own candied orange peel, using the candied grapefruit strips recipe from this website, and it worked well. We don't care for fruitcake, so this was a better version for us because the flavor isn't as strong. Oh - 1 hr 15 min is WAY too long to bake. 50 minutes is better

This originally caught my eye since it was very low in fat. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and easy this cake was. I have made it several times and have modified the dried fruit in various ways, added a jar of baby prunes and 1/4 c of oj concentrate for extra moisture and flavour. I would suggest that checking doneness after 60 mins as this seems to keep the cake from drying out. This is very good and certainly worth trying.

If you like fruit cake you will like this. Its great to have with afternoon tea and it is low fat.
