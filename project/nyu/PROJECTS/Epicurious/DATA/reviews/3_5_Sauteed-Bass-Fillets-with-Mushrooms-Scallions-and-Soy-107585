This looked like it should be pretty tasty BUT using regular soy sauce made it entirely too salty- and I'm usually one who adds salt at the table! I took great efforts to fix it- added water, rice wine vinegar, and white wine to cut the sauce since reducing it concentrates flavor but then went for a cornstarch slurry to thicken as it was way too thin. I think it would be much better over pasta or rice with a crispy veg (snap peas, bok choy, etc), but I'm trying to avoid the carbs. If nothing else, use LOW SODIUM SOY to control the salt!

Excellent and easy. Shiitake mushrooms are key. Added some ginger to the sauce and served over soba noodles with baby bok choy. Great weeknight meal.

Very easy to make. It is very light with mild flavoring.

It was very good and easy to make. We made some fresh pasta to go with it and it was excellent!

The sweetness of the mirin, the saltiness of the soy, and the savory flavor of the green onions combined to make a flavorful sauce for surprisingly so few ingredients. The flavor was soaked up by the mushrooms, in particular, which were my favorite part of the dish. Used mahi, as no bass was available. Served with sticky rice and stir fried veggies. Without the green onions sprinkled on top, it is a brown and not that attractive looking dish. But, quick, tasty, and low in fat... other than the mirin, had all ingredients on-hand. Might consider thickening the sauce further with a little corn starch so it clings a bit more to the fish... but I will make this dish again.

So easy. Bass is now so expensive so I used Orange Ruffy. I overdid it on the shitake mushrooms but was glad they were there. Everyone really loved it and it was easy to make with guests hanging around in the kitchen.

The sauce was fantastic. I used Ling Cod (what we had) which was okay, but made that much better cooked this way. Will definitely try again with a more suitable fish choice.

This recipe is so easy and good! I used tilapia and pre-cut baby portobello mushrooms for extra oomph to the dish. Very good dish when you have little time and don't want anything too sophisticated.

I used shiitake mushrooms and cod fillets. Very gourmet!

Very delicious and quick! We made it with cod (no fresh bass available) and portobello mushrooms.

I expected to love this dish, but I found that the flavor was much too mild and bland. The sauce is very thin and its flavor did not penetrate the fish at all. Maybe it's because the mushrooms and scallions "stew" in the liquid instead of sauteeing, or maybe the added water thins out the sauce too much. Regardless, the only flavor in this dish was in the mushrooms, and even they were bland. If I were to make it again, I'd saute the mushrooms and scallions, deglaze the pan with the sauce (without the water), then add the fish back to the pan to absorb the sauce.

Delicious and easy! I used tilapia fillets instead of bass (tilapia is inexpensive, farm-raised, low to no mercury). This is going to be a regular at our house - even my 4 year old loved it.
