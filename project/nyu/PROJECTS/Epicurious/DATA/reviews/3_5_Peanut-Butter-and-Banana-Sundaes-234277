I didn't have any problems with this not getting thick. To a previous reviewer, any cooked recipe involving half and half will NOT come out correctly with fat-free half and half. It's the chemistry involving the fat itself that makes a cooked recipe work. Anyway, the sauce is fabulous. Try with the home made marshmallows on this site.

This is the 2nd time I made this sauce. The first time, it was very runny and the PB never really mixed in right. It wasn't very good. After seeing the comment from another person about heating the half & half mixture until it thickens, I decided to try it again. I heated for probably 10 or 12 minutes and never saw any thickening. So I went ahead and removed it from heat and added the PB - still no thickening. So I reheated it while stirring and it thickened right up and was delicious! I'm not sure why I had to continue heating after adding the PB - maybe because I used fat free half and half. But as a PB lover, I'm so happy this finally worked for me!

would it be okay to leave out the corn syrup? or is there a reasonable substitute? i never use corn syrup so I'd rather not buy a whole bottle to use just one tablespoon in the recipe...

This was my Easter dinner desert. It is quick, easy and absolutely delicious! This desert has already become a family favorite.

Fabulous. If you really like peanut butter, you will love this and its simple to make!

LOVED IT! Delicious, quick and easy to make. We dreamed up many other combinations of ice cream flavors(choc/peanut butter, perrys panda paws etc), garnishes (choc chips, peanuts, piroulines). The kids loved it. Served in a beautiful dessert dish, this would be elegant enough for a formal dinner party.

OH MY GOODNESS! You have to try this. Made it for friends, who then wanted it the next night, too! The second night we added the toffee. You can go either way with it. Very easy an excellent. I wish I could give it 5 forks!

Sadly, I did not read the previous review or I would have cooked the sauce longer. It was WAY too thin as is. I'll try it again and hopefully that works. Tastes delicious, though. And I think that using natural peanut butter (all i had) did add to the thinness, so follow the ingredients in that case! Finally, this made a LOT of sauce, so I will cut it in half next time.

I loved this sauce but a word of advice...this sauce has to be cooked beyond the "whisk until smooth. Remove from heat add peanut butter..." directions given. I kept it at a low simmer until I saw a thickening occuring. It didn't take long, maybe 5 more minutes. I used a premium chocolate ice cream and vanilla with the bananas plus toffee chips and mini choclate chips...loved it.
