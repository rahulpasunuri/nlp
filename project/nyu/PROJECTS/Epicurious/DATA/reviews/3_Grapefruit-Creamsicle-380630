I thought this was delicious, and a great refreshing grown-up twist on a classic children's treat. I made it as a granita for the New Year and as the sorbet for a supper club and everyone enjoyed it very much. It was on the sweet side for my taste. I countered it with more grapefruit juice. Will be making again!!
