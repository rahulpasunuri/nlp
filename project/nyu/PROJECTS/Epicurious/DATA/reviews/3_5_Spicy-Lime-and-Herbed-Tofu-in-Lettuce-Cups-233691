I'm not so sure how this recipe can be described as flat or bland. I live in Southern California and I am very accustom to spicy Asian and Mexican food and this recipe was lacking nothing. I think the key is using fresh, high quality herbs and veggies. They create a freshness and brightness to the dish. Also get a good fish sauce, the power and depth of a that ingredient brings the "umami." Plus don't sub any sauce for the sweet chili sauce. Again find a good one, the sweet heat pulls the dish together. Finally I do not marinade my tofu instead I make an egg wash with one egg and a squirt of sriracha sauce and stir fry the tofu before adding to the veggies. No oil needed. I make this as meal for my husband and I. We split the whole recipe 50/50 and still come in under 300 calories!

Loved the dressing. I sauteed my tofu in a peanut sauce before assembling and used fresh herbs from my garden. Loved it!

Must agree with others here... After making the dressing and marinating the (pan-fried) tofu in it overnight, and otherwise making the recipe as is, found this surprisingly bland considering all the tasty ingredients involved. Added more lime juice, hot sauce, soy sauce, and fish sauce and still wasn't thrilled. Served this with sriracha and soy sauce, as well as a chunkier garlic chili sauce, and ultimately it was fine by the time everyone dressed their own with the condiments, but wouldn't rush to make this again. One thing I learned, though, is that the lettuce leaves crisp up very nicely after about ten minutes in the freezer.

Over did it when adding the 'hot' factor. Used a garlic pepper chili sauce & about a quarter teaspoon of Sambal Olek + 1 whole jalepeno pepper. Would definitely make this again but with the right chili sauce. I didn't bother to strain the dressing and I think it was fine as is.

My roommate and I loved this. I made it as written, except I couldn't find lemongrass, so I used lemon and lime zest. I also used crushed red pepper in place of the jalapenos. I marinated it for about an hour and a half, I think. We loved it and will definitely make it again.

Even better after marinating in refrigerator for a day. I used a food processor for the dressing and wished I had strained the dressing. The lemon grass chunks were a little too much.

This dish was mildly disappointing. I made it exactly as prescribed, but found the flavor to be a bit flat (which is interesting because I love all of the flavors that are in this dish!) Unfortunately, I probably won't end up making this again anytime soon.

3.5 forks! I agree with the "quick, easy and delicious" comment from another reviewer. I also agree that the dressing/sauce doesn't need to be strained after it's been blended, the texture comes out very silky. One suggestion: I pan- fried the tofu with a little oil and soy sauce, then let cool. I thought it looked nicer and gave a little different texture rather than serving it "raw." But I think this would be good either way.

What a taste bud surprise! This recipe is so quick, easy, and delicious with a lot of flavors hitting your taste buds all at the same time. Served it with spaghetti tossed with a little soy sauce and a tad of sesame oil. Will make again and again and again. Great on a hot summer night.

for those without blenders, fear not! i stirred the dressing ingredients together and added crumbled tofu. it was quite delicious - and plenty spicy. i used Sri Racha sauce and found the result to be similar to a laotian laab.

I loved this recipe after I read some of the comments below and decided to change the recipe slightly... 1. Instead of draining the pulp, leave it in. I found it put a lot of flavour into the salad. 2. I doubled the amount of jalapeno peppers. 3. I used a fine chili sauce (or Sriracha, Vietnamese chili sauce) instead of a sweet chili sauce since I found that the saltiness in the fine chili sauce added more flavour to the tofu. 4. I cut the tofu slightly smaller than a 1/4 inch so that the pieces would absorb more flavour. This worked like a charm. 5. I made this one day ahead of time and the dressing soaked into the tofu and flavoured it very well. Try having this on some spinach in a pita pocket... it was sooo good!

I found the dressing to be overpowered by the fish sauce and a bit too salty. Also, it was not very spicy despite the recipe name.

Good, but mild tasting to me. I added a half a chile more, a dash of salt, and 1 tsp. sesame oil. The second time I made it I crumbled the tofu instead of cubing it, which seemed to absorb the flavors better.

Wasn't attracted to this recipe because of the picture in the magazine - the 2 reasons I tried it were because I love lemongrass and my boyfriend is a vegetarian. The flavor in the dressing is fantastic. The spiced tofu was delicious. Amazing recipe. My boyfriend says if I made this every week, he would never complain. . .I wouldn't either. Made it "as is" - no tweeking necessary.
