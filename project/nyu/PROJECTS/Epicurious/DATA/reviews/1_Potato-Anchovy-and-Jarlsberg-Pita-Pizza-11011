Jansson's Temptation is made with Swedish anchovies which are rather sweet and salty. The regular anchovies cannot be used. The dish is great with the right anchovies. Haven't tried the pita-style recipe; probably won't.

Blech! I love all of the ingredients in this recipe and I thought the pizzas were terrible. The flavor of the cheese was lost - I think it might have been overwhelmed by the other ingredients. Also, even though I cooked them for an extra five minutes, the potato still had a slightly raw texture which was unappealing. Definitely won't make these again!
