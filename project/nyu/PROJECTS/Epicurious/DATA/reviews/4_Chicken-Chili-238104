This recipe is delicious! My entire family ate it and loved it, including the 5 year old who doesn't like tomatoes or anything spicy. Having said that, I did not include any chiles in it and it was still full of flavor. I found that due to the amount of chicken, I needed about 3 cups of broth. The thickness was still like a hearty stew. I used 2 cans of black beans with liquid and homemade salsa+1 can tomato paste since I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes. Also threw in about 1/2 a pint of cherry tomatoes. This recipe lends itself easily to similar substitutions if you don't have the exact ingredients.

I'm not sure what to say about this chili. It was quick and I guess good (2 forks). I added the black beans and some corn. I did not have the chilis so I used the chipotle chilis. I put in two and that was more than enough. We did put sour cream on top which helped cut the heat and cilantro, onions and cheese as wanted.

It's amazing how tasty this extremely fast dish is. I was skeptical but wow, it's wonderful. With the ingredients on hand you can make this in about 15 minutes. I used black beans instead of pink and I used Chipotle in Adobo instead of the suggested peppers. Chipotle gives it a nice, smokey heat.

I made this for a neighborhood chili cook-off. Went over really well. The wife says that it is so good I have to make it once a month now. LOL.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. We live out in the sticks of blandville, so the recommended chilis were not available. Instead, I used half of a 7 ounce can of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. I think the sour cream really added something, and we ate the chili with torn pieces of warm flour tortilla. A keeper of a recipe! Note: the chipotles gave the chili a real kick!

I made this and tasted it before serving but felt it was missing something. I made one change: I added an extra can of tomatoes as I felt it needed more of a tomato taste. Also I felt it was a little too meat heavy so next time I'll use only 1 1/2 lbs of chicken. Lastly I cannot recommend using the sour cream as a topping and most importantly, letting it sit for a day. It was ultra simple to make and perfect for a chilly, rainy, weekday evening meal.

Easy, tasty weeknight dinner. Not too spicy as mentioned by others, but I added some red pepper sauce.

Relatively quick and tasty! Used green chiles and added more spices (ie. chili powder and flakes, etc) since other reviewers said it was not hot enough for their taste. Also added chopped roasted red peppers, which was good but not necessary.

I make this frequently - it's delicious, easy and healthy. The only modifications I make are adding a heaping cup of frozen corn, and a lg. can of black beans instead of pink. It is otherwise perfect. It also freezes well if doubling the recipe.

I was surprised by how good this dish is. I used 4 oz. fire-roasted diced green chiles instead of the chiles called for in the recipe, and I used black beans. It was fabulous! I might add another 4 oz. of green chiles next time, but it's not necessary. I will make this again soon!

Another healthy recipe....I've made something like this before...it called for hominy. I used poblano peppers and added a chipolte...good stuff...over rice as the other reviews said...sounds about right.

This was a fantastic soup/chili. I left out the chiles and instead used some habenero sauce to give it some kick. I also used black beans since I prefer those over pink beans. Pretty easy to make and I will definitely be adding this to the favorites list.

Made this with a few modifications, my husband loved it. It is definitely one of our favorite chili recipes. Used dried chipotle peppers and rehydrated them in water, then added a few spoonfuls of the liquid to the sauce. Added a chopped jalepeno pepper for extra heat and threw in a splash of red wine. Served it over rice latin american style with accompaniments of limes, sliced avocados, queso fresco and garnished bowls with a little chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts.

This was fantastic. I used peanut butter instead of peanuts. When I ran out of white beans I threw in some chickpeas and some chopped parsnip. We served it over rice and it was perfect.

This was great! My kids (teens) and I all loved it. I doubled the cumin and added a little red wine per another reader's suggestion, then let everyone add their own amounts of Cholula hot sauce at the table. used two cans of beans to stretch it for leftovers, which made it less soupy and more like a typical chili.

SO easy! And satisfying!! Total fan! And everyone else loved it too.

This was so easy and so delish. My husband couldn't believe it took less than ten minutes to prep, and tasted so great.

I made this as written with one big exception. I used roasted New Mexican Green chili instead of the dried. This was delicious and SO easy. Even my kids ate it up. I will definitely make this again and again. I may add wine as suggested earlier to add another layer of flavor.

Like most of the other reviewers, I made a bunch of changes based on what I like and what I had in the kitchen. But, the part of this recipe I specifically love is the idea of pureeing the garlic and vegetables first. It created an interesting texture with only the beans and chicken being in full pieces. Topped with cilantro it was tremendous. Very quick and easy too.

My two and 4 year old love this soup. They always eat more than one bowl. I usually omit the chicken broth and use a 1 quart jar of canned tomato juice. I use 1 tablespoon of chili powder instead of the chilies, and I don't use a whole cooked chicken. I just use the leftovers from the previous night's chicken (usually about 1/2 of a chicken).

Made this last night and I thought it was delicious. This is how I made it: I doubled the cumin and threw in some chili powder for more heat. I added extra chicken stock and threw in some crushed homemade tortilla chips and chopped tomatoes to add more texture. I used some canned chipotles in adobo sauce since I didn't see any of hte guajillos at the store. I prefer almonds to peanuts so I used that too. Everything came together so quick and so easy. We made the beer can chicken from this site two days ago and used the leftover meat, and made the stock with the carcass and the beer we used to grill it with. I think that added extra flavor. Served with grated white cheese and extra crushed tortillas. Alot of good flavors goin on here. I know its alot of subbing and adding but I usually use a recipe as a base and do my own thing from there. Thats what cooking's all about right?

Very nice. A couple of things...Boil the sauce for longer to enhance the flavours. Also, substitute 1/4 cup of the chicken stock with 1/4 cup of red wine...it adds more complexity to the flavour of the dish. Otherwise really tasty.

With modifications, this recipe came out tasting like the African Peanut Soup I love to order at the Colifon Cafe in Bellingham, WA. 28 oz can diced tomoatoes, pintos, frozen chicken breast meat, fresh AND canned mild chilis, no cilantro. Sauteed raw ingredients plus crushed dry roasted peanuts (1/3 c) in olive oil, then added to rest of ingredients in a pot, boiled and simmered around 20 minutes. No blending because my kids don't trust disguised ingredients. Served with avocado and jack cheese plus cornbread for dinner, then just with tortilla chips for lunch. A good vegan option would be to sub another can of pintos for the chicken. Quick and yummy.

What kind of chili has the cook from Terlingua been eating? My mom grew up in Texas and her chili recipe is chock full of beans!

I made this recipe for a group of chili fans and everyone loved it. I used Chipotle Peppers instead of guajillo chiles and cut back on the garlic by one clove, added corn and a bit of butternut squash - loved it with a slice of corn bread, a dolop of sour cream and avocado cubes. Will make this again, for sure!

i love this recipe, but i did change some things that i didn't have. i used ancho chile powder and a chipotle chili in adobo sauce, instead of the other chiles. i used pink beans once, and pinto beans the other time, and both were equally good. also, i added corn, just thought it sounded good....and it did!

When I first made the sauce it seemed both bland and watery, so I added more chili and a bunch of cumin. I then added some diced butternut squash and a can of corn to the chili to thicken it up along with the chicken and beans, and simmered everything together for an hour. I think the extra ingredients and the time for the flavours to blend really helped it, because it then turned out really delicious, and quite thick, which is how I like my chili.

OK...so my 8 year old didn't eat the beans...but he didn't complain either!! Which is HUGE! I used 1 Jabanero pepper in place of the the guajillo chiles...was just enough to add spice but not overpower. It took me about 20 minutes from ingredients to the table.

I made this for dinner last night, and brought some for lunch today! I have been experimenting with various chili recipes and thoroughly enjoyed this interesting version. It was very quick to make and had excellent flavor. I used ancho chillies, along with a dash of ground coriander and Mexican chili powder. I will definitely make this again!

Really, really tasty, and easy as well. Didn't have the chilis, so used red pepper flakes.

Great flavors. Forgot I didn't have any beans, so just threw onto some corn tortillas and had tacos, which were excellent. Also used serrano chilis for extra spiciness.

I was intrigued by ingredients and method of this unusual recipe. The step of grinding up the sauce in the blender is a big mistake though. It would've been better to saute the veggies in oil the regular way instead of making it into spicy babyfood. It doesn't really save any time since you then have to spend the same amount of time cleaning out the blender instead. I don't understand why this recipe had such a high fork rating unless coz it's quick. I like beans and tomatoes in chili but it should have a chunkier full bodied taste and texture. The only way I would make it again is if I lost my teeth.

This was surprisingly good - complex flavors and a cinch to make (I think it took about 10 minutes). My husband is a huge chili fan and I've tried lots of variations and he's proclaimed this his very favorite of all. This, from a man who professes not to like nuts! I didn't have anything but jalapenos in a jar, so I used those instead of the chilis called for and it was great. Kudos to whoever thought of the rotisserie chicken - big timesaver and moister than mine.

This was very yummy and so easy! I was surprised how rich the flavor was for such a quick recipe. I substituted some New Mexican chili powder for the guajillo, which I couldn't find at my regular grocery store. Very tasty. I made the cornbread muffins with maple butter from Bon Appetit to accompany.

This was so good! Very easy to make and quick. Served with sour cream and chopped avocado. Super!

Wow! This met my expectations and more. I couldn't believe that I could not find guajillos in El Paso, so used anchos. (They were great!) Also could not get the pink beans so subbed kidney beans, but any bean you like here would work. I did not want to use the bean juice so I increased the chicken broth (used a whole 14.5oz can). I served it in soft corn tortillas with avocado garnish. The flavor is reminiscent of chile colorado, but much deeper and layered with the addition of the tomato, and not at all bitter. I'd actually give this an extra fork just for how easy and quick it is! This rocks!

I thought this had amazing deep flavors for such a time saving week night dinner menu. I used the guajillo chilis which were available in my neighborhood supermarket. Thought it was somewhat interesting "frying" the blended mixture but it worked out just the same. I added tortilla strips to the garnish list
