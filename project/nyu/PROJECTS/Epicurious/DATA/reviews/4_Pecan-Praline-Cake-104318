This is a very nice cake. It wasn't an absolute show stopper like some other cakes I have made. However this is a very good cake to serve after a heavy meal since it is beautiful, but not super heavy. I made the recipe exactly as written, using high quality ingredients and it worked perfectly. The cake was not at all dry as some had previously noted, and the frosting was not too sweet, nor did it taste too much like cream cheese; the cream cheese and sugar balanced each other well. All cakes have to be monitored in their last minutes of baking. People who said it overcooked could have avoided this by setting the timer for about 28 minutes and checking the progress. When a recipe says "about x minutes" it means about, not exactly since every oven bakes differently. The praline topping was yummy by the way, and really easy to make!

I made this cake exactly as written, with the exception of a little extra powdered sugar in the icing. It was delicious, one of the best cakes I've ever made. Sweet but not too sweet, moist but not too moist. Was a big hit with my family, and we tend to be very serious about our eating. I wouldn't change a thing, although the bourbon sauce probably wasn't totally necessary. I will definitely make this again.

Although this recipe is a little time consuming, it's well worth it. I brought this cake to a New Orleans-themed party a year ago and people are still talking about it. I made three layers instead of two for an even more decadent presentation.

This is a standard 1-2-3-4 cake (which is very good) with the addition of pecans. The pecans have the ability to put this cake over the top - providing they are of excellent quality. If the nuts have been sitting in the pantry too long and are stale and/or rancid, they will ruin the cake. (The freezer is the best place to keep nuts for longer term storage). The cake may also be frosted with a caramel icing. While the bourbon is a natural paring for the pecans, you can substitute a bourbon liqueur, Southern Comfort, or a praline liqueur, such as Liqueur Brule, with equally good results (check the larger liquor stores). You can also leave the liquor out altogether and the cake will still be wonderful. For those who complain about this - cake and other cakes being dry: (1) watch carefully - a few extra minutes in the oven can make a difference; (2) substitute buttermilk for the milk to produce a more tender cake; (3) use shiny pans that are well greased and floured; and (4) invest in Magi-Cake strips from Williams-Sonoma or Bake-Even cake strips from Wilton. These strips are moistened with water and wrapped around the pans before baking. The cake layers will be perfectly even and remarkably moist - and easy to layer and frost and they do not "dome" in the middle.

Disappointing. Although I baked the cake for 5 minutes less than suggested, it was dry. Frosting and Pecan Praline Topping are good, though.

This Southern girl thinks this cake is just heavenly! I've made it 4 times to rave reviews.

I have made this cake several times, and have been pleased each time - even when I have made mistakes (i.e., forgot to and the bourbon syrup to my layers). It presents beautifully and is very easy to make. Several people have asked for the recipe. Even my father raved - that is the rareset of compliments.

What a beautiful cake! It has become a tradition in our home for Thanksgiving. I set it out under a glass dome as the centerpiece of our dessert table. Everyone loves it.

Not worth the time and effort. This cake had no taste. I knew when I was making it it was going to be LOUSY!!!

I overbaked it slightly and it was still good. One person told me "it was the best cake ever."

Excellent! This has become one of my favorite recipes. I followed the instructions with no problems. I would highly recommend this cake.

I usually go for chocolate, but this is a very nice alternative. I've made it 3 times and everyone has loved it. The bourbon is not pronounced, the cake is very moist-not too sweet, the frosting is great (2/3 of the recipe is plenty), the pralines are yummy (make extra to eat while you frost the cake!)and we make home-made vanilla ice cream to accompany the cake.

I was very disappointed with this cake. It looks beautiful, but the taste.. blah.. Inoffensive but not memorable. Despite all the pecans in the batter, the cake doesn't have a good nutty flavor. And maybe there is too much vanilla in the batter.. the finished cake tasted somewhat like a vanilla box mix cake to me, although the texture was much better. Also, the vanilla cream cheese icing (which as someone else said tastes like cream cheese, not vanilla)is a little bland for such a subdued cake. Everyone ate it, but the pecans on top of the cake (which are delicious) were the only things that got much reaction.

WONDERFUL!!! This is absolutely the most fool proof cake. Someone actually made the comment, "You made this?" This cake has quickly become a holiday tradition. Make it, you won't be disappointed.

OHMYGOD! This cake is unreal! Made me look like a genius! This cake is easy but involved, stays great in the fridge for a couple days - absolutely wonderful!

Heavenly. I made this for an office birthday and the whole thing was consumed with many "yums" in the background. Easy to make. Moist cake, tasty frosting, and the pecans are a great finale. It's a keeper.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. Everyone liked it! The pecan praline topping would also be great on ice cream. Will make this one again.

This is an excellent cake! Despite my last minute empty-cupboard substitutions (no bourbon - used vanilla extract, used 'white' whole-wheat flour and some unrefined sugar) it came out delicious. It reminds me of some kind of luscious Italian torte more than anything, lovely delicate flavor. And the topping is good enough to eat by itself. I used about half the recommended sugar for the frosting, which seemed to keep it light and complementary. I will definently be making this again!

This cake is terrific, not difficult to make and looks very impressive. The next time I make this I will toast the pecans that go into the cake.

My family had this delicious pecan cake in place of the traditional pecan pie on Thanksgiving. What a hit!! My mom made the cake and I assembled it. I loved the way the whole pecans topped the layer cake, but cutting it was a bit of a challenge. Every pecan-lover must try this recipe!

Why the bourbon? I am a non drinker, so does the cake really need it? any clues?

I thought this cake was quite delicious. I made it for a friends party. It got rave reviews from all. It was a little time consuming to make but worth the effort. The only thing I would change is to chopped the pecans on top of the cake. Slicing the cake with whole pecans on top was difficult.

I have made this cake 3 times since it has been published. I have gotten rave reviews from all who have tried it even from a friend who's fondness for pecans is now questionable. I had great success with the recipe and will definately make this again and again. A keeper...
