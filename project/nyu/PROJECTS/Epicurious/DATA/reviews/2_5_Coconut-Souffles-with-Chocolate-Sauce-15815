This didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. I didn't like the texture of the coconut in the souffle. Other recipes in the original article are much better--chocolate, raspberry, goat cheese and even smoked trout!

I agree that the bake time and/or temp was off on this one. The recipe tasted great, but I had to cook it twice as long as stated and finally put the temp up to 350 for the last few minutes to actually finish the job (and I have a new oven, so I know that wasn't the issue). I suggest changing the cook temp to 350. Ohter than that, good recipe, though.

Exquisite. I added a little rum to the chocolate sauce to play off the sweetness of the soufle. No complaints, but raves.

What an easy and delicious recipe! Since the chocolate sauce and souffle base can be made ahead, putting this dessert together is quite simple. I made the sauce using half the heavy cream so it would be a little bit thicker in consistency. I also omitted the flaked coconut and added a bit more coconut extract for a smooth-textured souffle.

The baking time is way too short.
