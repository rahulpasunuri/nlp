outstanding! - only change was i used Trader Joe's frozen garlic instead of fresh. and i took the roast out at 135 and let it rest....moist and delicious. don't let it go to 160 in the oven or you'll be sorry! making it again tonight :)

Fabulous! My roast was 6 pounds so I doubled the garlic, thyme and sage, omitted the bay leaf and substituted about 2 tsp of finely chopped rosemary. Did not double the salt. Following other reviewers, I added olive oil to the herbs to make the mixture adhere better. Cooked in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours to reach an internal temp of 155. Tented and let sit at least 20 minutes, sliced and served with the juice drizzled over the top. Did not have time to make a gravy with the pan drippings, but will do it next time. Received rave reviews from my dinner guests. Easy, yummy and won't break the budget. Already planning to make again!

This is my stand-by pork roast recipe. You can't go wrong especially when the local butcher has it for $2.99 per pound. I use kosher salt and reduce it a bit. Like others, I add a touch of olive oil. I put in a convection oven and drop the temp 25 degrees.

Great mix of spices; doesn't overwhelm the meat. I doubled the amount of spices (except with the salt, used a little less), and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Rubbed onto meat with a little olive oil drizzled on top, then left in fridge overnight. Turned out delicious, served with rosemary mashed potatoes and spiced apples.

Did not have fresh garlic, so used 2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Rubbed all ingredients on pork only 30 min before roasting. The roast was moist and delicious! Served with Harry & Davids cherry/apple chutney - perfect!

This roast is superb with the addition of finely minced fresh rosemary added to the rub. This is one "left over" that my family will eat daily until it is gone. I always double the rub ingredients except for the salt, and I untie the roast, rub some of the herb mixture into the middle and then re-tie before roasting. I also add a litte olive oil to the rub to make it into a paste. It adheres better than a dry rub.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe..I used a 4lb.loin and used KOSHER salt which seems less salty. I roasted it at 325* until 145* internal temp and it was very "well done". Only took about an hour. I removed it from the oven, covered it with foil and let it rest a good 15 -20 min.Next time I'll cook it until it's 140 so there is a little pinkness to the meat.This is a much better way to serve pork.It was very tender.Easy and great for company.

Rating: 4
This is so good. The only thing I do is add some olive oil to make the spices easier to spread. The first two times I roasted it in a shallow pan (so it sat in juices and was moist) the third time I did it on a wire rack and it was significantly drier. Back to shallow pan. This is one of those meats that make the house smell wonderful as it cooks. Ah, Very comforting! I serve this to my gang (kids) with mashed potatoes, corn, applesauce and nice bread. yum.

I made it late to the butcher and didn't get the roast in time to marinate it overnight, so I had to settle for a few hours in the fridge. It was still very tasty. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices and added some rosemary; however, I cut the salt by a half teaspoon. It came out great. I'm adding this to the arsenal of tried-and-true recipes for company.

Rating: 4
The flavor was good, although the end pieces were very salty. I might lighten up on the salt somewhat. Also, my meat wasn't as big as the recipe, and cooking it for a little longer and to the prescribed temperature, it still wasn't done. Don't know if that was recipe, thermometer or cook's error.

This roast is excellent. I marinate overnight and as previous cook mentioned, I add some olive oil. The SALT is not a misprint. It helps tenderize the meat but doesn't make the roast salty. The pork is excellent for next day sandwichs ~ yummy yum.

This is a family favorite. I've made it a dozen times and always get rave reviews. I usually add 1 tbsp. of olive oil to the rub to make it easier to cover the meat evenly.

SALT! Could this be a misprint? Because good grief 2 teaspoons is far too much salt for one small roast. After making this over-salted roast, I found that other recipes generally call for only 1/2 tsp salt. With less salt, this would be very good and very easy.

I made this for a party and got rave reviews. I am making it a agin for Christmas dinner. I did however, double the spices and I seared in in a pan before putting it in the oven to roast.

No need to make any changes. Let the roast rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing to allow natural juices to remain in the meat.

This really was excellent. I too, cut the salt in half - but I can see that it is the salt that makes it moist (sort of an overnight brine). The only thing I took from the previous comments was to add 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and I'm glad I did.

Alexandria cook is right to suggest browning a crust first. Mashing the rub ingredients in mortar and pestle adding a little rosemary works really well. I invested $12 in a pack of 100 pairs of surgical-quality gloves which makes rubbing flavoring into meat and seeding hot peppers etc much more pleasant. This is a quick and easy dish and was particularly nice with a pepper jelly glazed brushed over the top for the last ten minutes of cooking.

We prepared this roast for our Thankgiving Day celebration and it turned out fantastic! Since it was our first time using this recipe, we followed it exactly (except for injecting garlic cloves) and it couldn't have been better. It turned out moist and full of flavor. Each bite made you anticipate the next! We would definitely use the recipe again and recommend it to first-time roasters!!

Though this is very good and will be a staple recipe in our house, I want to be judicious with the four forks ratings. This is definitely worth a try, great for family or company, but, in my opinion, is not "beyond compare." It is a very solid recipe. Based on previous reviewers' comments, I made the following modifications: doubled the garlic (1 Tbsp); tripled the sage (1 Tbsp); added 1 Tbsp rosemary; added 3 Tbsp olive oil; removed from oven at 150 degrees, tented with foil until temp rose to 160 degrees. Next time, I think I'll brown the roast a little in a saute pan before putting in the oven, just to get a little "crust" going. Quick prep time -- great if you don't have time to marinate. Very moist. We served with salad and risotto.

Sorry to drop this 99% rated recipe down but this was just a moist recipe, not a tasty one. My pork was bought from the best butcher in town so it wasn't the meat. It's not a tricky recipe, and I did marinate it overnight and brown it before it baked to 155 degrees.

This recipe is wonderful! I have made many roast pork dishes and this one is by far the most tasty and moist. I cut the salt in half, added more garlic, marinated overnight in a zip lock bag, and seared each side of the roast in a heavy fry pan in olive oil on the stove top before roasting. It cooked to 150 degrees in less time, where I removed it and wrapped it in aluminum foil for another 15 minutes. It was so juicy and tasty, a dinner party of 8 guests ate 6 lbs.! Everyone raved over it. A definite keeper. Can't wait to make it again.

Okay-for 10 years I've been trying to make a pork roast my husband would like. I've finally found it and he loved it! Moist and flavorful. I seared as others had suggested and put sliced onions on top as well as olive oil all over. Be careful not to overcook.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. I used about a tablespoon of olive oil in the herb mixture to make a paste to slather on the roast. I also "seared" it in the oven by roasting @ 450 for 15 minutes and then turned the oven down to 350 cutting the overall cooking time by about 10 minutes. Also made a gravy with some cooking liquid from veggies, a little white wine and flour.

No doubt this is the best pork roast we have ever had. Used rosemary instead of thyme, seared the roast before cooking. Very moist - even the cold the next day.

To the cook from Raleigh North Carolina..there is a method of cooking the roast that requires allowing the roast to rest on the counter between sessions in the oven. By doing so, the middle of the roast gently heats by conduction --heat absorbed by the outside of the roast penetrates the interior portions as it rests. A return to the oven at a lower temperature finishes fully cooking the roast through the center without overcooking the exterior portion. The result is tender texture and the least juice loss. The recipe is on cooksillustrated.com

As it has been so hot and I did not want to turn the oven on, I thought I would try it on the BBQ. I tied it with string and seared it on the BBQ. Then leaving one burner on, I put it on the other side. Took about an hour and it was awesome.

I made this for a large family gathering and it was well received. Marinating overnight definitely made a difference as well as searing the meat prior to cooking. Following some additional suggestions in Cooks Illustrated, I also added some white wine to the pan to deglaze and poured it over the meat before going into the oven. I roasted it until it reached 150 degrees internally and the meat was rosy and moist. A great recipe!

I used the variation posted by "Shirley ( shirl3773@aol.com ) from Seattle on 02/10/00". This is one of the best pork recipes that I know. Cooking the pork with the carrot mixure gives the meat a wonderful taste. Braising instead of roasting leaves it juicy and mouth watering. I also found that marinating the meat for just a few hours worked as well. One of our favorites!

I had to give this four forks because I have never liked pork enough to eat more than a few bites of it, but this was simply delicious! My family loved it even more than I. Since moving to Geneva from the US I am preparing more pork than ever. I plan on trying the two braised recipes from other reviewers as well. I did sear the roast as suggested and doubled the spice rub, added thyme, lots of coarse ground peppercorns and spicy red pepper flakes as Jay suggested. Because of bad timing, I marinated this part of the day rather than overnight and it was scrumptious, still! I cooked the roast at 325 vs 350 to an internal temperature of 150, as was suggested by other reviewers. (I'm not converted to celsius, yet) I do love this forum! This will definitely be on our table again soon!

This was an easy recipe with great flavor. I used Pork Tenderloin (and Rosemary instead of Bay Leaf) and I seared the meat in a little olive oil on the stove and then transferred the pan to the oven. After cooking to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, I removed the meat and added shallots and red wine to the drippings and reduced the sauce to a silky smooth consistency. It was very tasty. (I also added a little butter/flour to thicken the sauce.) I will definitely save this recipe.

This recipe is so simple, yet so delicious. I have cooked it several times, and it has always turned out well. Mind the temperature, as it tends to dry out quickly. I like adding LOTS of course ground peppercorns mixed with crushed red pepper as a spicy rub. Excellent meal, that always impresses. The chutney found elsewhere adds a great touch when you use the spicy rub.

I used a 1-1/2 lb pork loin and cut the spices in half. Turned out terrific. Kids loved it. I roasted it to a temp of 155 F and that was perfect. I made a gravy out of the drippings, YUMMM. Also, I seasoned it before work and roasted it that evening. 7 hours was plenty to marinade.

We cooked this on our grill rotisseri and enjoyed the aroma. Took it off when the temp reached 160 degrees but I think we should have taken it off at about 150 degrees and then cut into the middle to see just how done it was. It was a very dry roast. But we will definitely fix it again.

This was a very simple recipe to put together, considering the fabulous end result. I prepared my roast in a slow cooker, so the preparation beforehand freed up precious time at the start of my day.

Very Good, I'm not even that crazy about pork, but this was delicious and moist, the only problem was the roll was uneven, so part of it cooked faster.

To the cook from Boca Raton and Shirley from Seattle, your changes to the recipe by adding liquid to a covered pot is called "braising" the meat (like a pot roast). Your version makes my mouth water and I will try it with a less expensive cut of pork but it is not "roasting" as the recipe calls for. Roasting is to cook uncovered. I roasted the pork as the recipe dictated and it turned out delicious, juicy, and lovely.

Using the technique of some of the other cooks, this turned out to be the best pork roast I've ever made. I've never seen my husband be that excited about something I've cooked! Here's my method: use boneless pork loin halves (I cooked 3). Early in the day, make seasoning mix (cut back on the salt)as per recipe and rub it on roasts. Drizzle a little olive oil over to moisten. Let marinade in fridge all day. Brown in a large dutch oven with a little olive until seared on all sides. Remove roasts and keep warm. Add to dutch oven: 3 carrots, thickly sliced, 1 onion, sliced, and 3 stalks of celery, thickly sliced. Saute 3 - 4 minutes. Put roasts back into pan, arrange vegetables around meat. Add 1 can chicken broth and 2/3 cup dry white wine. Cover tighly and bake at 350 for 2 hours. When done, remove meat and vegetables. Discard vegetables. Strain liquid left in pan. Thicken liquid in pan with flour and water paste - 2 tbls flour to 1/2 cup water. Adjust seasonings. Slice roasts and serve with gravy. Meat will melt in your mouth!

We served this instead of turkey for Thanksgiving this year and it was an instant hit! I used a 5+ pound roast, though, and doubled the spices. It was a tad too salty, so if doubling for a larger roast, I would use less salt next time. The delicious aroma tantalized us for hours before the roast was ready to serve. A meat thermometer is a must.
