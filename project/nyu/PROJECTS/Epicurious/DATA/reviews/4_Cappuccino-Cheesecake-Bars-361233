The cheesecake part was fantastic, but the graham cracker crust did not stick to the cheesecake for some reason. I used the amount of butter called for in the recipe, so not sure what went wrong. Such a waste, so probably won't make it again.

This is a great and easy recipe but... it is not easy to cut and look good. I loved the flavor and followed the directions with warming the knife etc... and still had difficulties with it looking party worthy. Sounds picky I know but beware and do ahead to avoid to many breaking bars... oh made with oreo crust and it is amazing and I will make them again.

Creamy with just the right amount of coffee and sugar in it! So simple and easy to make!

I made the crust following nancylynn705's directions and it was perfect! Served the bars without whipping cream, and I don't think they need any.

I made these the other night didn't disappoint. I didn't have a 11x7 metal baking pan so I used a 9x9 pan and had great results. I skipped the whipping cream part. Will make these again for sure.

I first made these as directed, then followed the suggestion of DebW that the cappucchino flavored cheesecake would be even better paired with a chocolate crust. She is right! For the crust I combined 18-20 (2 cups) lowfat Oreos, 5 Tbls chilled butter and the Expresso powder (omitting sugar) and baked the crust 10 min as directed. *Unbelievable!

Unbelievably easy and delicious. My kids liked them so much I needed to make more for the adults!

Absolutely delicious, and easy to make. I spread the whipping cream all over the cheesecake and then cut it up, rather than cutting it and serving pieces with dollops of cream. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

These would be fabulous with a chocolate cookies crust....next time will try chocolate wafer cookies instead (will cut back a little on the sugar as wafers are sweeter than graham crackers). I plan to make these for an office Xmas function....will be perfect.

You can't really go wrong with these ingredients. The bars are easy to make and delicious!
