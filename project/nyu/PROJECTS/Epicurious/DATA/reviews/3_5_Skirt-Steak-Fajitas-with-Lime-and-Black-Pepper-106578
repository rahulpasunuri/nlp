I don't know what i did wrong but the meat was tough. I cut it across the grain and did not over cook.

Excellent, fast recipe. I chose this recipe because all the other skirt steak recipes suggested an overnight marinade and I had an hour. I added 1 Tbl whole cumin, an entire sliced jalepeno, and dashed Adolf's meat tenderizer on the steak before putting it into the 1 g. zip lock bag with the lime, oil, and salt. The grilled onions came out great. After they were done, I lightly wiped off the marinade, sprinkled on coarse black pepper and grilled on med-low for 5 min on each side. They were really delicious.

This has become my go to quick and easy sumer entertaining recipe. I'm making it for my third time this weekend and each time i get rave reviews. I double the onions because I coudl make a meal of them alone and their delish as a sandwich topping later in the week.

This was a winning recipe. The marinade is delicious; we tried both skirt steak and flank steak; skirt has a bit more fat....actually, both were delicious, although we preferred the skirt steak! We grilled red onions which added a nice sweet compliment. Great recipe and easy....Fun for a party!

Our store was out of skirt steak, so we substituted flank steak. I don't know if it was the cut of meat or the marinade, but the steak was fantastic. This was a terrific weeknight meal.

I marinated the steak for longer as some reviewers suggested, and it was tasty. I also made this with "Guacamole with fresh corn and chipotle" from this site, and that was almost the best part.

This is excellent for a no-stress lunch or dinner. I like to jazz mine up by mixing salt and ground cumin as my pre-grilling rub for the steak. Also instead of plain balsamic vinegar, I used a balsamic glaze or reduction. It makes the onion sweeter & more delicious!

I have made this several times. I have used skirt steak, flank steak and top sirloin - depending on what's available at the time. Skirt steak takes the least time marinating, but none of them take more than 30 minutes to an hour. The onions are awesome and add so much to the fajitas. Serve with guacamole, pico de gallo, black beans and the Rice and Green Chile Pilaf from this site. Great party food!

The flavors for the marinade smelled good during the preparation so I was disappointed that the steak was not as flavorful when cooked. I even added garlic for extra flavor. I would make it again but I would let the steak sit in the marinade longer (3+ hours) in the fridge.

Really, I'm completely confused by these reviews. I made this with skirt steak exactly as in the recipe, so of course it was good -- skirt steak is truly a tasty cut of meat no matter what. But the 10-minute marinade in the lime juice did nothing for the meat, and of course you cook meat seasoned...so really, a fantastic recipe would be just to grill the skirt steak with some pepper and make fajitas out of it. Add some grilled peppers, onions, salsa, and fresh lime juice, and then it's super.

This was good and quite easy. I used flank steak instead of skirt steak (easier to find here), and grilled an orange and a red pepper with one onion, which was plenty of onion.

These are fabulous as long as you cut the meat across the grain.

I made this recipe as part of a mexican themed dinner party, and they were the hit of the party. The steak was so delicious and tender (also made chicken fajitas with the same marinade-good, but preferred the steak!). I've been making fajitas for years but this is by far the best recipe I've tried.

Look no further for the perfect fajita recipe! We love this! I always need to find a few meals for entertaining over christmas - this one is always served to a house of 16 guests - everyone can tailor their own with toppings of their choice. Great tasting and fairly easy to prepare - can just as easily make this for a large crowd. The onions tossed with salt and vinegar make a great addition - though, I always add sliced grilled red peppers with mine.

I made this dish last night on the stove. I was not blown away like I thought I'd be. They tasted like regular fajitas you could get anywhere. We used flat iron steak instead of skirt steak and added red & green bell peppers.

This has become a family favorite! I serve it all the time with some variations. I cook the meat in the oven, usually just salt and peppered and doused with lime juice. I also bake the onions, when they are soft, I drizzle them with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and bake them until they start to char. Delicious! I serve this with really good home made tortillas from a local store, diced avocado, a diced tomato and basil salad with pine nuts and walnut oil (from Patricia Wells' Provence cookbook!), some shredded cheese or some mexican cheese, sour cream, different salsas including green, mango and a basic pico de gallo. Really, whatever I am in the mood for. But! I always serve it with bowls of limes for people to squeeze on their meat. I have only gotten rave reviews for this dish!

I really liked this, don't get me wrong - but I feel like I'm missing something having read the other reviews. I found it difficult to taste the lime. The onions are great though. A really nice mid week supper - but nothing more.

A family favorite! The lime is subtle, but that increases the excellence of this masterpiece of a recipe. Try mixing peppers with onions for color.

this was a pretty easy dish & a hit at the dinner table. I didn't use skirt steak but some leftover steak from the day before & it was still really good.

I just made this for my husband and we both loved it. I did everything pretty much as written, however, there was no skirt steak available so I used flank steak. I cooked the onions and the steak on the George Foreman BBQ grill (electric). I also added red bell pepper for color and flavor. I used low fat, low carb, whole wheat tortillas that actually taste good (HA!). I served this with black beans, a corn risotto made with habanero pepper jack and a nice, crisp reisling. Great fast meal and the left overs were good the next day!

Grilled both the onions and steak on a stovetop grill pan (flank steak) and it worked out great! The salt content was a bit much but I limited it by not adding salt to the onions with the balsamic at the end. Would be great with avocado added.

yum... made these fajitas with mexican black beans and quick corn risotto. Will definitely make again.

A super quick, super easy week-night meal. Prepared almost as directed. Marinated skirt steak about one hour. Have made with flank as well and was good. With skirt steak it was great. The balsamic is a must. Yuuuuuummmm.

Made it with chicken breast, too, since my boyfriend shies away from red meat, but it was so good he tried the beef as well! Couldn't grill, so did everything on the stove, adding some tabasco as the meat cooked. Onions were great cooked in the balsamic.

super easy & super yummy. used flank steak & marinated it for about 3 hours to be on the safe side. does anyone have any tips on slicing the meat thinly? I sliced against the grain, but my pieces were still pretty thick...

I made this for a party of 15 people. I marinated both beef and chicken. I received so many compliments! Some people love the beef, some loved the chicken. Easy marinade to make, I used some fresh limes, some bottled.

Fantastic fajitas! Made almost as described... Sliced vidalia onions into thin strips and broiled under gas broiler... did flank steak that way as well. Wife & kids raved! Highly recommended - no leftovers.

This is a delicious recipe. It's the first time I have made fajitas and my first experience with skirt steak. It was delicious. It may have helped that my beef came from Allen Brothers (allenbrothers.com). This is cut of beef that is not normally carried in my markets. It went very well with the black bean and corn nachos that is new to this site (February 2004 Bon Appetit).

This is by far the easiest fajita recipe I have made. The key to this recipe is the skirt steak. I couldn't believe how tender after marinating it for ONLY 10 minutes. I have passed it on to several friends

We found the mat chewy, even though we sliced across the grain. The flavor of the pepper was delicious, and I would try again, slicing the meat ever so thin and marinading at least 4 - 6 hours.

Being from the southwest, where this type of cuisine is everywhere, I can tell you that this is the BEST fajita recipe I have ever tasted. The key to this recipe is letting the meat sit and then thinly cutting across the grain. Otherwise it will be tough. Served with guacamole and black bean salad.

I never had much luck with fajitas until i tried this recipe. The marinade is the key. I miss my Dallas TexMex, but this will do until I can go back for a visit

My husband and I moved from Texas to the midwest this year, and we've been missing our Tex-Mex.... A lot..... We've yet to find a resturant in our new hometown that is even passible. Depressed by this and the cold weather, I decided to try my hand at fajitas with this recipe. THANK YOU EPICURIOUS! These fajitas were great! The recipe is quick and easy (with out without a grill!) I did add green and red pepper to onion mixture (double the bv). And I used a slightly better cut of beef than skirt steak. I served it with black beans and queso.

Awesome fajitas! The dinner party cleaned the serving dishes and begged for more! The grilled onions add a huge dimension. I added grilled red and green peppers, as well as beans for those that wanted it.

This recipe was very flavorful and good but be careful not to cook your steak too long. . . we like our steak medium & 10 minutes way overdid it for us. The salsa is a must have. My husband doesn't like avacados, but I imagine they would really add to the flavor if you do!

This was easy and very good, particularly with the roasted tomatilla salsa

Rating: 3
A quick suggestion: the onions right off the grill were much tastier before I added the balsamic vinegar, which altered the taste significantly. When I make it next, I will add much less or eliminate it all together. To suit your taste, you may want to add a tiny bit at a time to see how much you'd like.

The roasted tomatillo salsa (from this site) made these fajitas 4 forks.

The butcher suggested top sirloin because skirt steak is no longer available to that store. It worked out fine. I pan-grilled the steak for 8 minutes, will cut that to 6 next time. We liked the fajitas a lot.

I followed the recipe completely and also followed the cook notes at the end. I prepared this on our range top and served it with a tomatillo and avacado salsa. The results were incredible. I agree with the last reviewer, it was amazing that these simple ingredients provided such a wonderful meal. Don't pass up trying this recipe and I believe skirt steak is a key in preparing a meal you won't soon forget. Sooo goood.

I followed this recipe to the letter, using the proper cut of meat, and it was fabulous. The only change I made was to use whole wheat mountain bread instead of flour tortillas. I expected it to be so-so because the ingredients were few and didn't seem very exciting. I couldn't have been more wrong, the dish bursts with fresh flavor, and it's healthy, too. It went well with a cold black bean salad (mix a can of rinsed black beans with chopped peppers, celery, and bottled vinagrette). The meat was exceptionally tender, and I only marinated it for about 12-15 minutes. Do try this as an easy-to-prepare summer weeknight meal. Very satisfying.

I used flank steak for this (couldn't find skirt steak)... I just did the steak (not the fajita's) - it was good! Not sure I'd make it again. I think flank needs to be marinated a bit longer than 10 minutes & the lime, oil & salt wasn't quite enough flavor for us... maybe add a garlic clove & marinate longer next time!!

Skirt steaks seem to have vanished from the meat counter, so I made this with flank steak, which worked out fine. The onions were especially delicious. I suggest reversing the grilling order, cooking the steak first when the fire is hottest, then doing the onions. I did it in the order called for in the recipe but found that I had to add extra charcoal to get the fire hot enough to do justice to the meat.
