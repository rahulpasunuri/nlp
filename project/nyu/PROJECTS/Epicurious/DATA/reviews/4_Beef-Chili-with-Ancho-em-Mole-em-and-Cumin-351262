Taking the advice of other reviewers, I eliminated the 2 tsp salt. Even as a salt lover, it's plenty salty without this addition. The second time I made this, I doubled the Mole. Fantastic results. The third time I made it, instead of using the Texas-style chili powder, I used Penzey's Chili 9000. The recipe is pretty forgiving for substitutions. The only thing I've ever done to this recipe that didn't work was adding tomatoes (i didn't have beef broth and thought it would be a good substitute for the liquid. Even though I used a reliable brand, the tomatoes just didn't work-- too sharp and took away from the character of the recipe as is.

I started following the recipe, but didn't have either of the chill powders mentioned, and needed to get a bit more volume, so I used: 7 tbsp Mexican Chili Powder 1litre plus a splash of beef broth I added 2 small cans of organic black beans 1 large can of organic diced tomatoes 1.5 tbsp of the mole paste (instead of 1) 1.5 tsp ground cumin (I didn't have cumin seeds) i bought corn tostadas and melted mozzarella on them in the oven. Then i spooned the chili on top of the tostadas, and added freshly cut green onions and shredded mozzarella to the top (did not have cheddar or monterey jack). Delicious. The reason for adding extras: i had to feed four hungry university students, thus the addition of beans and tomatoes to create a bit more volume. I did not add any cayenne, but did add a tsp of paprika.

Oops, forgot to mention I also did 2 tablespoons of mole instead of one.

I made this for our yearly block party to rave reviews. I made several small changes and believe it helped it not be too salty or too hot for a big crowd which includes kids. Like others suggested, I omited the salt and was conservate w/salting the beef. I used 3 tablespoons of both the ancho chili powder and the chili mix (used Carroll Shelby's Chili kit chili powder mix), thereby omitting 1 tbsp of each. Used 4 cups of beef broth and 1 12oz bottle of good dark beer (used oatmeal stout). Also added 2 tbspn of brown sugar due to tasting it near the end and feeling it could use a tiny bit of sweet. Did not need the thickener/harina masa stuff at the end and did not add cayenne pepper. It was amazing and will definitely make it again. Several of the teenage boys at the event were insane over it!

OMG Great! Little hot, but oh so good.

About salt - In this recipe you have beef broth which I am guessing is going to be canned for most cooks and that contains salt. You have a spice "blend" which I would bet contains salt, mole paste and canned tomatoes all contain salt. You also have a ton of salt as an ingredient in the recipe. No wonder it tastes salty. Wow. So I ignored the "2t or more" of salt and used a little restraint. Pretty good recipe other than that.

This chili is so outstanding!! I've made it twice now, and both times, it got rave reviews. I made it to take to my mom's this past Sunday, and she called me last night to tell me that there were "fights" for the leftovers at her house. I made the following "tweaks" to the recipe, and it turned out beyond delicious: I used two onions instead of one. I added a Tablespoon or so of cinnamon. I added a bottle of beer. I used 3 tablespoons of mole paste (instead of one). I added some sugar to taste. I added a small can of chopped tomatoes. I used two packets of Lawrys chili seasoning (instead of the Gebhartds cuz my market didnt have it). I did not use any Cayenne  it had enough zing without it (probably from the Lawrys chili seasoning). A must try for chili lovers!

Very good but just leave salt to the very end. My family did not find it spicy. The flavor with all the spices makes it taste very good. I also added the black beans to the pot.

This is the best chili I have ever had. Must add sour cream with serving as it is a bit spicy. And don't forget the extra sharp cheddar cheese to top it off. OUTSTANDING!!!

Rating: 3
I agree with other reviewers! I too am a spicy food lover, but this recipie has way too much chili pepper, and I did not even bother to add the cayenne!! It was also on the salty side, so I am glad that I read others reviews so that I was prepared for this! Otherwise, it is a pretty tasty dish.

Rating: 4
I LOVE hot spicy food, but I still thought that this came out WAY too hot. (And I didn't even use the optional cayenne) In fairness, chili powders can vary a LOT, so your mileage may vary. Of course cooking temps can vary too. In my case it came out to a nice thick consistency at the end of the cooking time -- no need to add the thickeners or thinners.

Rating: 4
Great chili! I used my crock pot and cooked it all day (8 hours). Used more mole paste and about 1 T sugar. No Texas chili powder for me. I used the Ancho powder and a couple T of chipotle powder. Nice and spicy. Made some homemade sour cream to add to the neighbor kid's bowl to mellow it (she loved it!) Can't wait to try it with elk or venison. yummo.

At first I had my doubts about the chili, but now I need to edit my last review. My family loved it! I didn't add salt until the end and add extra masa to thicken it. Really nice!

It was ok. I didn't add salt until the end so it would not be to salty. Don't think I would make again.

This is great, well worth the trip to the Mexican grocery store for mole and ancho chile powder. It has a very rich, deep flavor that makes it feel much more refined than regular chili. My guests were impressed. I served it with lime wedges, tortilla chips, crumbled cotija cheese, and a can of black beans. It's true that the servings are not very large, but they are very filling.

Good chili, but even better reheated the next day.

I think there was waaaaay too much chili powder in this recipe (hence some people calling it "salty"). Next time I would put in 1/4 cup total. Since it was so "salty" I tried to thin it out with beans, tomatoes and rice. It helped, but I still couldn't eat a lot of it - too overwhelming. I will try again with all the changes mentioned.

This is hands down the best chili I have ever eaten. I actually never even knew chili could taste like this. It's extremely hearty- just the right amount of flavor. Again, simply amazing. I paired it with rice and flour tortillas- such a delicious dinner and even better lunch!

I made this chili last night for dinner and my Husband said "this is the best chili I've ever had". I have to agree with him. Perfect recipe, at the same time flexible enough for those who don't have the exact ingrediants, can be made mild to hot, according to the Chili powders used. Make sure to use the Mole/chocolate and a Texas blend of chili powder for the rich flavor though!

Rating: 4
Awesome chili. But I do like tomatoes in my chili, so I added about 14 oz. crushed tomatoes plus 1/3 cup of Goya Sofrito. I think any type of chile pepper will do. I used dried pasilla and chipotle instead of the Gebhardt chili mix, and memorgan's suggestion of cinnamon, pumpkin seeds and chocolate for the mole, which I couldn't find.

Rating: 4
This chili is delicious, but next time I'll use something other than chuck - it was a bit greasy for my taste. I used regular cumin and dried dried ancho chilis (my local grocer didn't have cumin seeds or pure ancho chili powder), and it turned out fine. I sliced two chilis (left them big so I could pull them out upon serving) and just threw them into the mix. Turned out great!

I made this for a chili cookoff and had to scrap it all. I was really disappointed. It was SUPER salty and had a strange flavor. Maybe I did something wrong, but I will never attempt to make it again. :(

Excellent chili, fabulous flavors! My teen sons have never liked the standard ground beef and red bean chili so this has become a family favorite! We always add the cayenne pepper-- love the heat-- and use low sodium beef stock. Since my sons are not bean lovers, we use black beans as a topper for those who must have beans with their chili. Sliced green onion, cilantro, avocado, and cheddar cheese also make great toppings. During football season this is our standard chili for game day which is a huge hit with all our guests, big and little! Can't get enough of this chili.

Wow, this was excellent! Even my husband, who is not a big fan of chili, said it was good. I did not have the Texas blend, subbed with fresh pasilla and ancho chiles, plus regular chili powder. Everything else was done according to the recipe.

Excellent chili, extremely rich. I used a Tablespoon of cumin instead of the seeds and a standard chili powder blend I always have on hand. I did miss it not having some heat to it. Next time I'd up the cayenne amount or maybe throw in a jalapeno with the onions. I used Dona Maria mole paste I picked up at Whole Foods. I could only find masa in big 5 lb bags so I just took some cornmeal and ground it up until it was a powder. Worked perfectly.

This chili is absolutely spectacular. I usually double the recipe for parties and it gets devoured in no time. I've become famous among our friends for this chili and follow the recipe precisely, sometimes substituting already chopped stew beef to save time. It breaks up so much you can't even tell the difference. I highly recommend it!

Rating: 4
Outstanding..and worthy of all of the 4 forks its been given. Subbed my own mole using cinnamon, baking chocolate, ground pumpkins seeds; added chunks of pre-cooked sweet potato for added drama, and used more masa flour to thicken. Also added dried and soaked pinto beans..served with a wet style cornbreak to great fanfare, especially hungry men. I have catering business and this will be a staple chili offering..the next best thing to this is the Silver Palate's Mexican Chicken Chili..which also gets rave reviews.

Like so many others, I made this for a chili cookoff and won against 11 others. I made the recipe according to the directions, adding a little more bacon and onion, less beef broth and black beans. After going to 5 stores, I finally found mole at the Latin market. This chili is awesome!

This recipe helped me win the neighborhood chili cookoff. I cut down the meat to 2 1/2 #'s and added two cans of black beans and a diced butternut squash for a little sweetness. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Good rich flavor.

It may be spring, but I had a craving for chili. This really is the best chili I've ever had. I impressed my boyfriend. Very tender meat and thick and rich with lots of chili powder flavor. It was so easy to make, too. I knew as soon as I read the recipe that it was going to be good.

I have to go along with the crowd and give this 4 forks! I made the recipe to serve 4 and followed it to a 'T'. Being from the midwest it needed more 'stuff' so I added 1 can of rinsed and drained black beans and offered sour cream and cheedar cheese as accompaniments. SO good! I served this with a salad

Made this first time for chili contest and took first place. Being from the midwest I added 2 cans of pinto beans, but this recipe is killer without them too. couldn't find Gebhardt chili powder so I made my own with New Mexico, ancho, cascabel, and chipotle. Came out real good!

I don't know. I'd give this 2 forks, and I have tried tons of chili recipes. The guys I made it for gave it 4 forks. I felt it was too salty (and I didn't use all the salt called for) and the spices were overwhelming. In all fairness to the recipe, I couldn't find the mole paste, so I substituted ground pumpkin seeds, cocoa powder and a dash of cinnamon. Perhaps that made the difference.

I couldn't get excited about this chili. I guess it is just a matter of personal taste, but it just didn't go over well. Added 2 cans of black beans for some more oomph, but to no avail.

I live in a small town so I had to make a number of substitutions because I just could not find some of these ingredients...cocoa for mole mix, chipotle chili powder for the Texas mix and I added kidney & black beans. We really enjoyed this chili recipe - we're adding it to our book of "solid" recipes.

This chili is fabulous! I made some minor adjustments to the recipe based on what I had on hand: used ground cumin; had adobo not mole paste so added 1/2 square unsweetened chocolate, grated, and it worked very well. I also omitted the bacon, as I don't use pork products. My guests raved about it, and I've shared the recipe several times already. A keeper, for sure.

I was looking for a great chili recipe and when I saw all the great reviews I had to try it. I brought it into work and most 'tasters' said it was the best chili they ever had. Two colleagues actually offered to pay me to make it for their families. I did add one can of black beans and stewed tomatoes at the very end. Otherwise I did stick to seasonings in the recipe. It did take longer than 2-1/2 hours to cook the meat to the desirsed tenderness but it was worth the wait. I used chopped onion, tomatoes, avocado, pickled jalapenos, sour cream, jack and white cheddar cheeses as condiments and baked cornsticks as a side. Yum.

I made this on Saturday night, and loved it so much I entered it into a chili cook-off on Superbowl Sunday. It won 1st place against 14 other competitors! One of the judges told me "No contest". The only variation was that I couldn't find any Gephardt's Texas-style chili powder, so I decided to use chipotle chili powder instead. The smokiness was awesome.

I made this chili for Superbowl Sunday, it was the first thing to disappear from a table full of food. Everyone loved it, but if you're making it for a party of eight, double up! Everyone got a small bowl but that finished off the pot and all were asking for more. Only one variation: I couldn't find Ancho chile powder so I used a mix of New Mexico and California with some Chile de Arbol for kick.

Added one can of black beans, some chopped jalapenos and halved the amount of meat. Won a chili contest with this recipe!

This chili was just too much; too rich, too salty, too much meat. I can see why one reviewer served it over rice. Maybe I'm just not a fan of this type of chili, but I can't imagine trying to serve this as-is to a crowd...it's basically a big pot of beef. However, I'm glad this recipe introduced me to mole paste and ancho chili powder, which I iwill now use in my cooking and my own version of chili...but with more more finesse than is used here.

Very good flavor, but I like a little more complexity (my go-to recipe also includes bittersweet chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, some beer, a can of refried beans, some crushed tomatos, and some ground chorizo, but this was a nice change of pace). The chuck roast breaks down nicely if its cooked long enough--I browned the cubes then tossed them in the crock pot and left it on for 6+ hours--it was shredding at that point, which adds some texture to the chili. I also cubed a couple of pork country ribs and some sweet Italian sausage, which helped.

This was excellent. Even better the next day. I couldn't find masa so I sub'd flour. I added black beans to it to "beef it up" a bit. It seemed like there was a lot of liquid and I used a 4 1/2 lb roast. Otherwise I pretty much stuck to the recipe. Will do again.

Kick-ass chili! Instantly became my new fav chili recipe. I soaked dried ancho peppers and pureed them with the broth instead of using powdered, and did not use mole. I added 2 cans of drained black beans toward the end. WOW!!

I did some substitution. Used a chipotle chili pepper instead - 1/8 cup. Also added about 2x the amount of mole called for - cause I wanted more of the mole flavor. In any case, I was hopping up and down excited about the outcome. Love this recipe - one of my top chili recipes!

I made this chili last week and it was one of the best versions of chili I have ever tried. I loved the smokiness from the anchos and the mole. We kept it simple and served it with sliced pickled jalapenos, some cheese and a scant amount of sour cream. This recipe is fantastic, a definite winner!

Absolutely amazing dish!! Living in Scotland, it is hard to find Mexican ingredients. If you can source La Preferida or Goya brands though you are set. I found dried Ancho chilis, which I dehydrated and whizzed in a food processor and added much more than listed. I also included a tin of Mole sauce as well as 2 tbsp of paste to make it thicker and creamier rather than the corn flour. The taste was rich, dark and creamy, with a slight chocolatly taste followed by a warm and pleasant tang of the chili. The smell of the dish was intoxicating as it simmered. I served it over a bed of white rice and added chopped cilantro (coriander) as a garnish. The bacon wasn't especially necessary; next time I will just use more beef. My fiance said "no more Tex-Mex chili from now on, this tastes like someone's Mexican grandmother made it". Definitely one for dinner parties or cold winter nights!!!!

I made this recipe over the weekend, and it has to be the BEST chili recipe I have ever tasted. It is difficult to find the Ancho chili powder here, but I had ordered it online a month ago for another recipe, and now I'm glad I did! My husband ate two bowls for dinner, and told me I wasn't to take it to work to share - he wanted to have it later in the week!
