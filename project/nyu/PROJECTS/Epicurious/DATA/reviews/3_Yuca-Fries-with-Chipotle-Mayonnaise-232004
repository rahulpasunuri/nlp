Much tastier than potato fries. Great recipe!

Yeah, Latin and Spanish are not the same, it's true, and categorizing them as if they were is rather offensive. But there's no reason to give this recipe a low fork rating on that account. It's actually pretty tasty. So give it forks for flavor, and write a strongly worded letter to epicurious with your complaint.

I agree with the previous rater from Spain. I stongly encourage Epicurious to monitor the recipes. If classified under Spanish, they should not include Chipotle, chiles, tortillas, etc, which are ingredients used in Mexican cooking. All it would take is a small amount of interest and education about the differences among cuisines, which is what Epicurious should focus on. Spanish does not mean ALL countries with Spanish-speakers. Please take the time (considering this is a website for those of us who are interested in the culinary arts)which includes knowledge about the origin and customary use of ingredients. It would be like saying that a Kosher dish from Israel could have pork in it! Please show some cultural knowledge before you lose me and many others as customers.

I dont know if there is any kind of confusion with Spanish and Latin American. I am having a look at the page from Spain, and I can assure everyone that yuca, chipotle, pumpin or dulce de leche (As I saw in other recipies)are not at all main ingredients in Spanish cuisine. I think a bit of respect for the differences between the two cultures would not do any harm.

I have been making yuca fries (with chipotle mayonnaise, no less!) for years and was surprised to see the recipe! Until now I thought they were my own little secret!! Much better than any French fries you've ever had, and the chipotle mayo is an excellent dipping sauce for these. The proportions of mayo to chipotle can of course be adjusted to suit the amount of fire you're looking for. Yum! Yum!
