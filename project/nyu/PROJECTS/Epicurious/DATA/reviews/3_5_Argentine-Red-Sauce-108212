A very well-balanced chimichurri perfect for a marinade. I marinated one steak for an hour, and a second one overnight as the recipe suggests. The first steak actually turned out better; the overnight steak tasted a bit too vinegary, but still good.

Good basic marinade but WAY too spicy. Cayenne pepper overpowered the flavour of the meat. Next time I'll reduce that spice.

Finally - a really spicy marinade! I used with sirloin steak chunks skewered with red and green peppers and onions, grilled and served with tortillas. One of the few recipes I haven't wanted to change.

Really wicked. Every time I have this sauce on hand I find myself poking around the fridge for something to dip into it between meals. As stated previously, great for marinating, a dipping sauce for brochettes, etc.

Very good recipe. I followed it exactly the first time, and then I thought - why not keep the dry ingredients ready in a small jar, and add the garlic, oil and vinegar whenever I need it - it works very well. Also, as I am not particularly happy with the quality of the red wine vinegar here, I combine a quarter cup vinegar with a quarter cup good quality red wine.

Reserved some of this sauce in a separate container and then marinated steaks in the rest of it for a couple of hours and barbecued them on the grill. Used the reserved sauce for dipping - this is excellent!! Next time we'll marinate the meat overnight.

This sauce is easy to put together, and was a huge hit. I marinaded shrimp and pulpo (octopus) in it, along with red and green peppers, mushrooms (which were especially tasty!), and zucchini. Made brochettes and barbecued them on top of tin foil, and there was none left at the end of the party.
