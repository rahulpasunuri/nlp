Excellent!! I would recommend skipping the added salt, it's unnecessary with the green curry paste and the fish sauce. I sauteed purple onions and mushrooms in a tablespoon of olive oil first, then followed the recipe but did not add the 1/4 cup oil to the pan - it turned out perfectly. I think next time I will add some carrots and broccoli to the saute. Will make again.

delicious! I was looking for a rice noodle dish for my annual detox (no gluten, dairy, sugar, etc) and this was a winner. Lots of garlic and ginger, and fresh grated turmeric. Used 1/2 can of coconut milk. Didn't use lemongrass. I made it vegetarian so added broccoli and thinly sliced carrots instead of fish. Yum.

Salty! I worked hard to overcome that, adding sriracha, a bit more sugar, & lime juice. Good quality green curry paste is essential; the lemon grass is not. Second time I made it, I added the same extra things,to taste, but used a broth I made out of the shrimp shells instead of chicken broth, plus very little salt. Much better!

My wife and I thought that this recipe was quite good. The flavors melded well. I think the key is to use a VERY GOOD quality curry paste and fresh ingredients. Make sure that you adjust to taste. We added a little more curry paste and some Sriracha after is had reduced. We also added some baby bok choy. This is really a pretty simple recipe since most of the ingredients are done in a food processor. Prep should take 10-15 minutes. Cooking time is about 45 mins.

I chose to not use lemongrass fearing it would overpower all the other flavors. But I loved this recipe, I'm on a curry kick right now and this satisfied my need. I also added some sprouts to it for alittle added crunch because I love having cool crunch with my curries.

I'm so disappointed. I was really hungry for some Thai but this is a very bland rendition of the real thing.

I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews here. This is one of our favorite recipes in Epicurious. I don't have access to fresh lemongrass here, but I throw in a little from a jar (gasp, I know). I also don't tend to throw in the whole can of coconut milk...to rich for me. I think the key is to really make sure the broth reduces. I also make the noodles according to the package (I don't boil them). Mine comes out quite spicy but it probably depends on what curry paste your using. IMHO, it tastes very authentic. Making it tonight!

such a lot of ingredients and such a boring flavor. Ok, we did not have the lemongrass to overpower everything but without it the recipe was definitely not a keeper. I made better curries with just the curry paste alone.

I followed the recipe exactly and after I reduced the curry mixture to where it was to the point that I could begin seasoning it, I tasted it and it was horrid! Talking with an Asian co-worker this afternoon, we both agreed that a 12" stalk of lemongrass was entirely too much. It has an intense flavor so maybe cut it by 75% or leave it out next time. Plan on an hour of prep as well.

I used red curry paste instead of green and some shrimp broth I had made instead of chicken broth.It needs a lot of fish sauce, but it came out well. I used thin rice noodles, and I think next time I'd use thicker noodles such as pho noodles so that the noodles could stand up to the sauce better. Still tasty though. Frying the curry paste for enough time before adding the coconut milk and broth is key! That caramelization is where a lot of the flavor comes from.

This is pretty tasty. I used more of the green curry paste than called for, AND still needed some red pepper to add heat, so if you're a fan of spicier food, make sure you adjust. I've never seen a recipe that calls for cooking rice noodles - but that might just be me. I thought they normally just sat in a pot of hot water. I used fettucine instead. Great family meal.

Rave reviews at my house. We love Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. It really is authentic. In fact, perfect, with less oil & longer simmer. I cooked the puree until it turned a little golden. Garnished with fresh cilantro. Taste of Thai yellow curry paste is fabulous with this (the tumeric is already in there). Their packet means you don't have to buy a whole bottle of curry paste. Of course, it is spicy--it IS a Thai curry. Put hot sauce on the table for the fire-eaters.

Delicious! Great with chicken, too. Skipped the fish sauce,cut back on the oil. Needed a little more time than recipe says to reduce to proper texture.

This was OK. My husband loved it, but I thought it was a little bland and that the sauce had a weird texture - too mushy for my taste.

Disgusting!!! Very disappointing considering the time I spent making the curry paste and deveining the prawns. Would never make again.

I added several veggies (asparagus, bean sprouts, yellow pepper) and crushed red pepper, and omitted the chicken broth, based on other reviews. My husband and I both loved it. A bit less salt next time, but I'll lmake it again for sure.

We were missing the fresh lemongrass and turmeric, but figured with all the other ingredients, we'd enjoy anyway, which we did (don't substitute anything for the turmeric). we love asian cooking but this was first experience with green curry paste. we used 2T and found it very spicy, so unsure why other reviews say bland. I did NOT like the smell of the paste and was very nervous but when diluted w/ the coconut milk etc, it all turned out great. I took others' recommendations and only used 1/4-1/2c of broth--this is very important, it must have been a typo b/c i can't imagine it working. we made a batch of rice noodle and regular asian noodle and both worked well.

YUM! I just made this for a quick birthday dinner for my husband before he dashed off to a meeting - it was a hit! I was making it in a hurry, so didn't even notice the oil and chicken broth - so didn't use any. It was perfect, and my 9 and 12 yr old kids loved it too, though a little spicy for them. I added a chicken breast, cut up and sauteed, as I didn't think I had enough shrimp in the freezer - also some cucumbers julienned, which added nice texture. I highly recommend this recipe!

I found this dish to be a little bland and shallow in flavor. I added extra curry paste but that didn't help. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Any recipe with 19 ingredients doesn't belong in the quick & easy category.

Delicious. I used a bit less chicken stock as per the reviews, but I should have used just 1/2 a cup. I used the 2tbsp of the green curry. Very yummy!

This is a really great recipe with some changes others suggested as well as a few changes I made. I subsitituted chicken stock for water for blending the ingredients. I substituted curry powder for turmeric (had no more turmeric). I added more cilantro and ginger than called for, and substituted dried lemongrass I found at the supermarket for fresh. I only added 1/2 cup of stock to the sauce and I was able to maintain a thick consistency. It was truly delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

Sauce was a little thin, but I should have reduced longer. Did not use any water and only 2 tbls of oil. Could not find green curry so used red instead. Also did not puree just chopped garlic, cilantro....

...oh and yes, the other reviewers are correct in that the amount of oil called for is absolutely ridiculous. Two tablespoons is more than sufficient.

As the recipe stands above, it is one fork and I would not make it again due to thinness of sauce and lack of texture and balance in the flavours. However, with a bit of tinkering, the amended recipe is a repeat hit. I did not add any water or broth whatsoever, nor did I puree anything. I did add fresh lime juice (3-4, depending on size and juicy-ness). Also, BF has nasty reaction to fish sauce, so I omitted that and just got more heavy-handed with the ginger and garlic and added some cayenne. And ditto on the leftovers - this will give you a bit of a food-gasm if you like to get up and forage in the middle of the night.

This was a bland, greasy, garlicky, shrimp soup. I have never a thai curry be so liquidy. As far as leftovers I am going to remove shrimp from the soup and toss the liquid.

Excellent but needed to add 1 extra tbs. curry paste and reduce until much thicker.

with no desire to go searching for lemongrass, i left it out and probably would again. there are still plenty of wonderful, complex flavors in this dish, and the curry does seem to have plenty of lemongrass in it already. this recipe is a cinch to make and definitely a keeper!

I really liked this. Per the suggestion in other reviews cut back on the oil, just coated the bottom of the pot. It has a bite but I didn't feel it to be overpowering, good balance. The sauce is really thin, next time I will put it over rice instead of using noodles.

I added red peppers to the mix which I thought would be good... But this dish is S.P.I.C.Y... and with no warning. I thought it turned out O.K., but was WAY too spicy by far for those with a more sensitive pallate. Personally I was a little bit disappointed. Doubt I will make again (have to find another use for all that green curry paste I have leftover).

This is one of those rare dishes that made my husband go back for seconds. And he had the leftovers for lunch. We never seem to eat leftovers most of the time.

Delish! SOOO easy, and a gorgeous green color, with a very seductive taste. I made with Udon Noodles, and used light coconut milk with great results. Will definitely be making this again, and again as a quick and tasty weeknight meal.

This was wonderful. I was a little nervous that the shrimp were not done, so I cooked them longer. It didn't affect the meal, but it did make the leftover sauce smell very fishy the next day... so no leftovers :( Not the easiest recipe I have ever made but definitely worth it. I served it with Chicken Satays and spicy cucumbers to round out the meal.

I really liked this recipe. I followed the recipe closely and it turned out perfectly. The curry was medium to hot and had a nice bite to it. I reheated it the next day for leftovers and it was perfect!
