the spices for this recipe, did not work well so next time I will leave out the cinnamon sticks, the cumin over powered the flavor of the dish, and the chili powder did'nt taste right, oragano did'nt work, I will go back to my old ways, chicken,onions,garlic, canned and fresh peppers tomatillos salt and pepper.

I modified this to be an excellent burrito filling by doing the following: replace the bell peppers with a small amount of serrano (this recipe lacks heat); reduce the amount of chicken broth to 2 cups; skip the flour altogether, and grill the chicken and then dice into small pieces. Very easy, and very popular results!

I'm dubbing this my Green Bay Packer chili because of its beautiful green & gold colors. I followed the recipe & am glad I did. I like the texture of the chunks vs. shredded chicken. Did take the cinnamon sticks out after the first hour of simmering, though - it was strong enough.

Makes a fantastic burrito filling if you cut way back on the amount of chicken broth.

Amazing! Great complexity of flavors. Try it with a frozen hatch nm roasted green chile and you won't be sorry. Followed others on skipping green peppers and shredding the chicken. Mexican oregano too. Yum!

I don't really consider this to be "chili," but it's a good dish, and I would make it again with minor adjustments. I used only 1 cinnamon stick just because I don't like too much of that flavor. I think that jalapenos are a must, and I used pickled jalaps because they are always in my fridge. A good splash of lime juice at the end of cooking brightens the flavor, and I was generous with salt and cumin. Next time, I'll shred the chicken and omit the flour step because the texture of the chunks wasn't very appealing. I served it over rice and will make tostadas with the leftovers. This makes a ton of food but that's great for the freezer.

I love this recipe. I think using chicken thighs adds to the flavor, but I don't coat them with flour. I use poblanos instead of green peppers and add 2 serrano peppers and 1 jalapeno--seeds included to make it nice and spicy. I make sure to char the corn kernels if possible. And I just include a dash of cinnamon so it doesn't overpower. Serve with cilantro and dollop of sour cream to cut the spice. Yum.

Overall, I got rave reviews with this one and fared well in my office's annual chili competition. I made the following changes: 1. Reduced to 4C broth and added two jars of Herdez Tomatillos salsa instead of cupping up tomatillos. Made for a consistent base. 2. Used two cans of white hominy instead of frozen yellow corn. The hominy absorbed the flavor better. 3. Added 2 medium sized jalapenos instead of Anaheims ... didn't use seeds. Couldn't get Anaheims. 5. Added a can of black beans during the last 15 minutes of cooking. I didn't want the beans to break down and change the flavor of the base, but still wanted to add some additional bulk to the chili.

I really liked this recipe. It definitely took a while to make...but really good. I also used pablano peppers instead of green and added in one yellow and one red pepper since I had it in the house, and also a can of navy beans and black beans. Everyone loved it!

This is an outstanding recipe. Like many of the other reviewers said I left out the green pepper. I added 4 roasted and peeled poblanos and some jalapenos.

Excellent chili! Instead of using chicken thighs, I did some substiuting... I used a pre-cooked chicken from the store. I also used tomatillo salsa instead of husking and chopping them. The little shortcuts were such a time saver and everyone loved it. I can't wait to make it again!

Great if somewhat unusual recipe. My guests said"It's not chili, but it's good!" Used the advice of others - chicken breats, no green (bell) peppers, just a variety of chilis. Also the Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn works great here. The only caution I have is that it makes a ton - too much for my large crock pot, so I separated some as I was browning it and froze to finish later.

I made this for our Cookie Day Open House, and it was huge hit--completely gone by the end of the day. I read all the reviews, and based on the feedback, and my personal preferences, here's what I changed: -used two poblano and two anaheim peppers, omitted the green pepper entirely (don't particularly like green pepper) -added one can of drained navy beans -used about 2 Tbsp. of very good ground cinnamon instead of the sticks -also added a few chopped green onions when I added the cilantro I made it a day ahead, and reheated that day. Gave the flavors lots of time to mellow. Also, I was continually adjusting the spices to taste, and recommend that you do the same. I had never made a chicken chili verde recipe before, and this one has become "mine."

My guests liked it, but I didn't think it was worth all of the time it took to make. There are better chicken-chili recipes out there.

Overall this was good. Easy to make ahead, and then heat on the stove, or crock pot. The one thing I would change, is not so much cinammon, this flavor just stood out a bit too strong.

This is a family favorite. Some of the changes that I make are... breast meat instead of thighs... cook the onions for a much longer time - til limp and w/ a little color, then add the garlic for just a minute or so. Instead of green bell peppers, I roast poblano peppers. Add a couple of seeded roasted jalapenos. I use Mexican oregano (just 1 Tablespoon) and Mexican cinnamon sticks. For the corn I use the frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. It is SO much better the next day and also freezes well. I think it would convert easily to vegetarian by substituting tofu b/c there is so much flavor here, but I haven't tried it. I serve this topped with a dry Mexican cheese like cotija or ranchero. Also good served over rice, which cuts the heat a bit.

I also made this for the super bowl, it came out great thanks to the tips from other reviewers. I used a mix of poblano, jalapeno, and green chili peppers (not anaheim or bell) and added 2 cans of white kidney beans (one drained/one not). I reduced the stock and corn by 1 c. each - but I don't think this last change was necessary since the chili was think and the corn was not overwhelming.

I don't know if I made it wrong...I am pretty sure I followed the directions but it was really not great. The chicken fell apart so I had to add more. And, it tasted burned even though I didn't burn it. Very weird. I was disappointed, especially since it got such great reviews! Also, it turned red from the chili powder so it didn't look "verde" and finally, it didn't taste like any chili verde I've ever had before. Oh well!

My hubby hates beans, so this is one of the rare chilis he'll eat--I've been making it since it was originally published(10 years!) and it is always a hit with a crowd and has become a family staple. I've played with it--but the original works best--and sauting each layer until well browned is a must(especially the corn!) or it really loses its flavor. Thieghs work best as well, they have a deeper, meatier flavor than breasts. Garnish with cheddar cheese when served for an added layer of comfort food! This works equally well when halved.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was delicious. Based on the prior feedback, I made some adjustments. Roasted 4 very large poblano peppers and used to replace the Anaheim peppers. Skipped the bell peppers, cut the corn amount in half and added one very large jalapeno (with most of the seeds - threw in the pan with the corn). The results were delicious. Really liked the hint of cinnamon.

Rating: 3
The recipe needed a little help. I used a combination of breast and thigh meat, omitted the green bell peppers and increased the Anaheim as well as adding jalapeno (I sautéed them with the corn, only using about 1/2 the qty called out). Also added crushed corn chips at the end of the simmering time to thicken and add lots of flavor. If more heat is needed use Poblano peppers instead of Anaheim or add some Serrano chilies. Also, the seeds and ribs are where all the heat is, so don't remove them if you want to add that heat. Chili was better the second day like all chili is!

This is a tasty soup. It isn't exactly what I was looking for, but it is close. I made it according to the recipe, with some minor exceptions. I had poblano peppers on hand, so I used those instead of Anaheim. I exchanged the green bell pepper for red bell pepper. I omitted the cinnamon sticks (didn't realize I was out and my neighbor was not around!). It needed a bit more zing, so I added the zest and the juice from one Meyer lemon. The soup was quite spicy, which we loved. We served it with Jalapeno corn bread, as suggested. Everyone ended up breaking up the cornbread into the soup to soak up the wonderful broth. This would be a good soup for a cold wintery day.

This was so tasty! I'm not a big fan of bell peppers, so I used roasted poblano peppers instead - delicious! I also added jalepeno peppers for some added kick. Food Saved the left overs and brought them camping - made for a great meal by the campfire! YUM! A keeper for sure.

This is a great chili recipe. I made it for our friend's Super Bowl Chili Party. It received 1st place for the "Best Chili". I did tweek it a bit- I omitted the corn and added a can of black beans. I also added one red pepper- mostly for color. Hum! May be I should change the name since it's suppose to be a "green chili". Either way, it's delicious. I'm making it again for a weekend ski trip.

OUTSTANDING! However, I love chili with beans and like it spicy so here's how I changed the base recipe: Used 1 lb. Empire (Kosher) ground turkey sauted in the 1 Tbl. of oil without the flour, but using the salt & pepper. I didn't break it up completely, but allowed the turkey to chunk into traditional sized chili-sized pieces of 1/2-inch. I omitted the corn altogether and added two very healthy large fresh jalapeno peppers which I chopped very well and sauteed along with the bell and Anaheim peppers. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I added 1 healthy teaspoon of ground cinamon - it just adds the nicest flavor! Also, since I was going to add beans, I used a Trader Joes 32 oz. box of Chicken Stock to get more liquid. I drained one can of regular Pinto beans and threw them in and threw the entire second can (bean juice and beans) into the stew. Believe me, with the 2-hour cooking time this is the perfect amount of liquid to cook down onto the extra beans. I used "Mexican" oregano which I feel has a nicer bite for Latin foods than Greek oregano. All the rest of the ingredients I used were exactly as stated in the recipe. This chili is outstanding and do add the cilantro, it adds a second bite at the end. I serve my chili topped with chunked fresh avacado, chopped Roma tomatoes, some Mexican cotija cheese, chopped red onlions and a dollop of sour cream in the middle. Then everyone can just mush the toppings down into the chili or eat them as garnish as they want. This is a 4-star green chili, but start around 9:30 a.m. if your football game is at 1:00p.m. Enjoy!

This dish rocks. To save prep time, buy 3 pounds of boneless, skinless thighs. I made the recipe as presented and loved it. Next time I'll spice it up with more jalepenos. This is a great filling for enchiladas.

This had a really good flavor. I browned tofu and used that as a meat substitue, and it worked surprisingly well. I compensated on flavor by including some cayenne pepper and some diced jalapeno. Great dish for the fall.

i did not make this recipe but i have an easier more processed version. one big can of green enchilada sauce (i try to find medium heat), around 3 cups cooked chopped chicken, a can of black beans, an onion, 2-3 cloves garlic, 1.5 cups corn and cilantro. throw everything except cilatro in a pot and simmer 30 min. garnish with cilantro. i serve it with warm corn tortillas or chips. it is a cop-out and looks ugly but it tastes really good and everyone loves it. i also doctor it with chili powder and cumin.

I made this with a few alterations, but it worked out great and I was really impressed with the flavor. I omitted the corn entirely (corn tends to overly sweeten things, in my opinion, and didn't seem authentic (I am not from New Mexico but I have family there and visit often and I have yet to eat Chile Verde with corn, let alone this much corn)). I also used ground turkey instead of beef. I cut down on the chili powder a bit and aded more cumin (I wish I had cut out even more chili powder...maybe only using 3/4 of a tablespoon or so). Anyway, it turned out really good, and i will definitely make it again.

I had to reduce the volume to serve a smaller number of people so pretty much divided everything by 3, except the chicken. I used 2# of chicken in order to follow some recommendations for more meat. I also left out the cinnamon as it's a flavour I don't fancy. Everyone loved the results and I'll definitely make it again.

I used vegetarian "chicken" pieces and browned them as you would the "real thing". I thought it was delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like the texture of the veggie chicken but raved about the sauce. I will definitely make this again. We both thought it was excellent albeit different than we expected due to the cinnamon flavor. Really good!
