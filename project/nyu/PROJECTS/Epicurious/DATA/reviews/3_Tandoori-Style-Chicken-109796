My hubby loved the spice, my son the picky eater did not too spicy for him, may try again for hubby or try a different Tandoori"

Very spicy and a little dry. Would recommend using 1/2 of the spices and 1/4 of the yogurt it calls for.

Made this last weekend. Was it just me, or did this chicken taste like a salk lick? When I saw the call for TWO TABLESPOONS of salt, I almost fell of my chair. I used one and it still tasted like the chicken had been dipped in the ocean...I did brush some cilantro on the chicken just before serving to try and jazz it up a bit...

Pretyy good, not great. If you've eaten this in an Indian restaurant you will think this recipe is dull.

This was good, not great. I drained the yogurt as suggested. The chicken was tender and moist, but there are better recipes with the same type of ingredients.

I used only boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1/2 the yogurt and made my own garam masala. The chicken was very moist and tasty. My family and guests loved it. I didn't have the mess that others have referred to, perhaps because I used less yogurt. I simply rolled up the foil and threw it away and the racks came clean easily despite looking like a mess.

I thought this was delicious. We served it to a large group at a birthday party and everyone really liked it. So nice to find an Indian-style recipie that doesn't include curry! The cucumber raita that goes along with it really made the dish.

I wouldn't chage a thing. The chicken had the perfect spice balance and was so moist and tender. Easy, quick, and a great party dish!

Lacked flavor. Panned by family of 6.

Enjoyed tandoori chicken with salad in Christchurch, New Zealand. Have tried to duplicate it ever since...and this chicken recipe does! When done, slice the chicken and serve over large green salad. Drizzle with yogurt & Thai chili sauce (in a bottle or jar). Top with cashews - and you have an excellent meal in a dish.

Wonderfully spicy. Not quite like my favorite Indian restaurant, but given the ease of the recipe, well worth it! And the house smelled so good! Will definately make again. Only problem was cleaning the rack--what a mess!

Terrible, boring Tandoori. Chicken was nice and moist but boring flavour. Have had much better success with other recipies.

I think this is a great recipe: easy to prepare, easy to make, spicy, and delicious. I highly recommend it to people who appreciate Indian food yet don't have time for the intense preparation that such recipes often require. Also, I substituted non-fat yogurt, and the taste was still good.

Good, but cut down on the masala. Also, I marinated for 2 days, and I think that helped the flavor sink in. Yum!

Not sure whether to make again or not. It was not as great as I'd anticipated. Based on other reviews we cooked it on the barbeque to avoid messy clean-ups but unfortunately my husb. was in charge of the grill and the chicken ended up a little over-cooked. I just can't decide if it would still be worth making again. I served it on top of some mashed sweet potato to which I'd added the same blend of spices and a little of the yoghurt and I LOOVVED the potato like this.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I didn't like the taste of the onions in with the yogurt mixture; too crunchy for us all (and I chopped the onions up quite a bit). I've made tandoori chicken before using an Indian prepared sauce in a jar (I forget the brand) and liked it quite a bit better. Wouldn't make this again -and the clean-up was a mess, even using foil underneath.

Sorry folks but this was a disappointment and I cook quite a bit of indian food including tandoori...the flavor was a bit bland as well.

We loved this recipe and I have made it a few times already. I use lowfat plain yogurt, I line a sieve with a paper towel and allow the yogurt to drain and thicken for a couple of hours. Also, I squeeze out the juice from the grated onions so that I have a nice thick sauce for the chicken.

Delicious! I was hesitant to serve it cold but it was great!

I lived in an Indian neighborhood in NY and still work in one. This is not like any of the Tandoori chicken I get here, nor is it comparable. The spices in this recipe seem out of balance and the Garam Masala already has cumin and cardomom in it which made the cumin the predominant taste in this dish. I followed the recipe to a tee and found it sorely missing the traditional garlic, ginger and red chili pepper or cayenne. Sorry but I would not bother making it this way again.

to the cook from Atlanta try draining the yogurt for an hour or two before using - just line a sieve with a coffee filter

I am a personal chef and made this for 2 of my families. I only made one change...I cut the turmeric in half. Both families thought it was excellent (even the kids!). Personally, I didn't like the way the yogurt sat on the chicken...it was too wet. The recipe calls for you to lay it on thick. Next time I'll shake it off first.

This was easy and awesome. I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

They say that necessity is the mother of invention. I wanted to make this recipe but didn't have enough plain yogurt. Mixed in sour cream. I didn't have garam masala either. The Joy of Cooking had a recipe for it and I had all the ingredients--just mixed them in to the recipe. I didn't find the clean up a problem at all. I wonder if the sour cream helped. My husband said the tandoori was better than any he had had in NYC Indian restuarants. Wow!

My husband suggested I cook this, and I'm glad he did. I used brined boneless skinless breasts and thighs which yielded moist, tender results. Like the other reviewer, I grilled the chicken (less messy and tastier). It was sublime--perfect summertime fare. Serve some basmati rice and a salad, and you're set! Be sure to pour a Navarro Gerwurztraminer with this as well. Yummmmm!

My husband loves spicy indian food and I was never able to emulate the taste until now. We both loved it! Lots of kick and flavor.

Very tasty but I agree clean-up is a bear. Steve...Grill it! I often grill chicken marinated with yogurt with either Greek spices (mint lemon garlic) or Indian spices. Your final result will not be the same as baked but still very good. Just watch the temp to avoid drying out.

How well would this work if I used boneless chicken breasts, pounded them to a uniform thickness and grilled them? I hate to cook indoors during the heat.

So tasty. Only complaint is the cleanup of the baking rack! It is definitely worth it though.

This was delicious and very spicy. I used half bone-in breasts, turned out good. I had to cook a bit longer than recipe stated. The pans were very messy to clean up even after using tin-foil. Would be perfect for a outdoor summer picnic with lots to drink.

Very tasty and easy to make. I happened to have all the spices on hand but only skinless/boneless chicken breasts......worked great with those as well.....would imagine grilling the chicken would make it even better
