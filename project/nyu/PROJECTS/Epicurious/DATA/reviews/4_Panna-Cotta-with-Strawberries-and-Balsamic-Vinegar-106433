I've used this recipe for several years, and people ALWAYS ask for it. My daughter and I tried every panna cotta we could in Italy, and this one tops every one of them!

used 2% greek yogurt and vanilla beans simmered with the cream instead of the extract--fantastic recipe!

The panna cotta is fabulous. I found the strawberry/balsamic topping to be too vinegary and I didn't like that the strawberries got discolored with the balsamic. Next time, I will try the balsamic sauce maybe with some pureed strawberries and less balsamic, and then do fresh strawberries on the side.

I was intrigued by the combination of flavors, so I had to try and it didn't disappoint. It worked well. Everyone loved the flavors. I added 1/2 tsp. more gelatin for firmness. The pepper was interesting. After serving for dinner, several guests commented that they put vinegar and pepper on other fruits, such as melon, as well. Try it, you will not regret it, refreshing and flavorful ending to a meal.

I have alot friends who are always dieting. I changed the cream to 1 cup and the yogurt to 2 cups ans it was divine!!! Now everyone wants my panna cotta instead of birthday cake. (I multiply the number of recipes I make acording to the number of people attending and place the panna cotta into a souffle dish and unmold before serving. You can write Happy Birthday ........ in chocolate if you like and surround with seasonal fruit).

I also used full-fat Greek style yogurt, and increased the gelatin to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons. It was perfection. I macerated fresh raspberries with about 2 Tbsp. sugar and and 3 Tbsp. Chambord. I poured the panna cotta into martini glasses, let it set overnight, and spooned the raspberry mixture over the top just before serving. It was a beautiful sight, surpassed only by how yummy it tasted! Perfect do-ahead recipe for a dinner party. Can't wait to try other panna cotta recipes.

Recipe adjustments: I used Greek style goat's milk yogurt, a vanilla bean while heating the cream, an extra 1/4 tsp gelatin as others suggested, and 2 extra tablespoons of sugar in the sauce. I was worried when I tested a small amount the night before, just 4 hours after putting it in the fridge. It was super tangy and just tasted like yogurt, plus it wasn't very set. However, it turned out just magically wonderful and was a total triumph. I might use a little less balsamic next time. It was practically strawberry soup, and wasn't nearly sweet enough with just 1 tbsp of sugar. I highly recommend this though. Easy to make, impressive, and sooooo creamy delicious.

this was so simple and turned out great. I used quark as I had no plain yogurt, for anyone who lives in quark country... the day before making of it made it perfect for an easy dinner party dessert.

This was my first panna cotta and it was a total winner. My husband described our guests' reaction as "groveling". It was simple, refreshing, and delicious - the perfect summer dessert! I made it in pretty teacups and didn't unmold it - I just heaped the strawberries on top. The only thing I would do differently is that next time I am going to be a little bolder with the black pepper and balsamic vinegar on the strawberries - not wanting to over-season, I used a light hand with both, so it was very subtle.

This was really wonderful and very easy! I used Greek yogurt which worked out perfectly and had a great texture. I also did not unmold them. Instead I put them in little 5 oz plastic cups and topped them with the strawberries. Still a very nice presentation and easier to serve and clean up! Definitely recommend this!

This is an excellent panna cotta recipe. I have tried a few, but this one takes the prize so far. I made it exactly as the recipe called for (with the exception that I also used a vanilla bean when heating the cream) and it turned out great. Great consistency, great flavor, great presentation when unmolded and served with sauce on top and sides. Don't skip the sauce, it may sound unusual, but it tastes delicious.

very good - seems high-class with little effort. i had sheet gelatin instead of powder and used 5 sheets to make sure it set (4 sheets for 2 cups liquid). It was ready to eat and perfect in several hours.

I have made the stawbery sauce a couple times, WOWOW! It is amazing, and very very easy.You can use this sauce so many ways, esp on a baquette, with goat cheese.Very uptown and 9 o'clock. I say, this is a 10 Fork recipe!

Like other reviewers I have made this many times and every time have wished I had made more (I sometimes get hungry around midnight). For those who didn't think that it was firm enough, I found that instead of adding more gelatin I drained the yogurt, particularly when using low fat yogurt (for the amount of this I could eat I have to cut calories somehow). It is my go to dessert recipe especially in strawberry season.

Made 4 x quantity for a party with no changes to the recipe and got lots of rave reviews. Tried Pernot instead of balsalmic vinegar with the leftovers - a good alternative.

My husband and I are big fans of panna cotta. We've eaten a lot of it in restaurants and tried a lot of recipes at home. This among our top two favorites for all panna cotta we've consumed! (The other being the recipe created by chef Nancy Whims at Nostrana restaurant in Portland Oregon.) The balance of tart and sweet in this recipe for panna cotta is perfect as is the silky texture. The berry sauce is delicous too, but other accompaniments also work well.

I added extra gelatin, like the others suggested, and I'm glad i did, since it just barely came out firm. Also, the sauce was runny, so I would just reduce the liquids a bit. The taste, however, was excellent. I think making it in clear tubular cups would be great presentation, with a sprig of mint on top.

This panna cotta is very creamy even with the extra gelatin recommended by reviewers. Tastes great, but some people (like my husband) might insist it's not in the true panna cotta spirit. I used twelve year aged balsamic for the strawberries, and it was wonderful. Be careful to grind your fresh pepper as finely as possible, as I was left with some pieces that were too large for a dessert (not subtle.)

Rating: 4
This recipe is a knock-out! I've made it plenty of times. 18 hours is the perfect amount of time to let it set. I'm not to fond of the strawberry-balsamic sauce, so instead, I add fresh vanilla bean as well as the extract, and top the dessert with lavender honey, or honey with lavender infused in it, as well as freshly sliced kiwis! YUM!!!! Will be working on one where gelatin is dissolved in orange blossom water or rose water for a delicate floral flavor...keep you posted. :)

This recipe was phenomenal. I also added the additional 1/4 tsp of gelatin as recommended by others and it was sufficiently set to eat after only 4 hours in the fridge. The balsamic strawberries add a sophisticated touch and shouldn't be left out.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday who loves panna cotta. This was so easy and it was excellent. I was lucky to find great strawberries this time of year. I used the greek style yogurt and it gave it a nice touch. I also added 1/4 tsp extra of water and gelatin as others suggessted. I will make this again and my party guest insisted on the recipe and I sent them home with the extras!

I have made this two times. The first time I made it exactly as directed. The flavour is great but it was too runny. The next time I used 1 1/2 tsp gelatin and it was perfect. The strawberries and balsamic were delicious with the sweet creamy panna cotta. My husband could not believe there was pepper in a dessert. This is my new easy, fast but very impressive dessert.

This recipe was a hit. Be sure to let it refrigerate overnight and avoid temptation. I added the 1/4 tsp extra gelatin and 1/4 tsp extra water for perfect consistancy. I also sprinkled fresh ground cardamon on top of the panna cotta before putting it in the refrigerator. This version of Panna Cotta works great with the Blackberry Sauce recipe from Lemon Pana Cotta with Blackberry Sauce. I will definately be making this one again.

The taste was terrific. The panna cotta was very rich and creamy. I would use another 1/4 tsp gelatin next time to make it a little firmer. The strawberries were delicious.

I didn't use whipping cream but used heavy cream instead. I also put the mixture into my Oster blender and whipped for a minute or two to blend everything together. I thought the strawberries in the balsamic vinegar need a little more surgar than the recipe called for so i increased it SLIGHTLY. The panna cotta set-up beautifully in the refrigerator within a couple of hours. My dinner guests LOVED this. This was very easy to make......simple and elegant dessert!

To the person using goats milk, I am not sure, but I read the recipe to mean goat's milk yogurt, or regular yogurt, not goat's milk. In the instruction it says to mix the cream, yogurt and vanilla, not cream, goat's milk or yogurt. So, that is what I think, made with goats milk yogurt this tastes great.

i made this for a dinner party and it was fantastic! i recommend putting it in small, tall glasses instead of ramekins, for presentation...my friend and i served it without the sauce (and with a chocolate-balsamic vinegar sauce) for a chocolate-themed dinner party. it's very creamy, and the tang of the yogurt is fantastic. instead of vanilla extract i split a vanilla bean and put it in the cream that got heated.

I used whole milk greek yogurt (Fage). You can get it at Trader Joe's if one is near. It is not like any other yogurt you've tasted. It has been strained and has the consistency of sour cream. Made with the greek yogurt, this recipe came out so delicious it was to die for. You could also use Karoun Dairies yogurt....found in middle eastern markets. Same thing.

In response to the issue with Goat's Milk, you were likely using canned goats milk, yes? Canned goats milk is a far far cry from fresh, and should be avoided at all costs(in my opinion...

Very good panna cotta although the yoghurt adds a bit of tang which detracts a little from the richness of the recipe. The strawberries are an excellent accompaniment to the rich vanilla though.

I wanted to respond to the person who found the goat's milk yogurt too strong. As a former dairy goat "milk maid" I would like everyone to know that good goat milk does not have an offensive taste or odour. If you find this to be the case, search for a new source of goat milk. :)

Is everyone else making this using the goat's milk? Or the yogurt milk? I was a little hestitant of using the goat's milk, because it has such a distinctive taste. This recipe got such rave reviews though, that I thought maybe the goat's milk taste somehow wouldn't be as noticeable (over the vanilla, whipping cream and sugar). I was disappointed this morning when I tasted it. That goat's milk taste was still apparent enough to distract from the creamy, vanilla-y taste. Next time, I will have to try something in place of the goat's milk. Regular milk, Marscapone cheese maybe? Or maybe I'll just use more whipping cream (would that make it too heavy?)? Any advice?

I make this dessert for almost all of our major parties--my husband won't let me admit it. However, I do not use the strawberries, rather, I just make a balsamic sauce with sugar and vinegar, and then ladle a a tablespoon on or two per dessert, with the instruction to make sure that no one get too much balsamic. I also think it is IMPERATIVE to use the goat's milk. Yogurt makes it taste like, well, yogurt. Every time we have this, I have to harrass some people about eating it, and every time, I have a devoted follower after they've tried it.

This recipe has become a big favorite. Awesome as described ... however for New Year's Eve I did a ginger variation ... Skip the vanilla ... cook all of the cream with approx 1/4c chopped fresh ginger ... bring to a simmer ... turn off heat and let sit for about 15 minutes ... strain and reheat a touch before adding the gelatin ....

The flavor was amazing but it didn't get as firm as I would have liked. If I make it again, I'll use a little more gelatin. I also substituted a real vanilla bean for the vanilla extract.
