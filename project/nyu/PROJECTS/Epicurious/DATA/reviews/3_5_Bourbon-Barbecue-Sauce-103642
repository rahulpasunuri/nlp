Replace bourbon for whiskey, and paprika for hot pimenton which gave it a wonderful smoky flavour. Delicious with BBQ ribs.

Great sauce!! Followed recipe except I did not have Worcestershire sauce. Served sauce over sauteed chicken thighs and onions with mashed potatoes and green beans. Family LOVED it!!!

Very good! Because I was using it in Vietnamese Spring Rolls, I added a little (2T) lime juice and 1/8 tsp. Saigon Cinnamon to enhance the flavor notes I wanted.

Fantastic made exactly according to recipe. This will be a standard in our home.

I've made gallons of this stuff. I like it because it has flavors not found in store sauce (bourbon) and it omits flavors that are always in store sauce (no horrid liquid smoke). I go light on the bourbon, about half. It's a little jarring. Why doesn't it have vinegar? Because that's another kind of sauce, bucko.

It did smell really bad. It also didn't have enough flavor; had to add a bunch more brown sugar, some ketchup, and VINEGAR. How can you have bbq sauce without vinegar? A bit more hot pepper sauce too. I'll just try a different recipe.

I made this for class, we were serving pulled pork sandwiches. The amount of sauce wasn't enough (even after I doubled it), so I ended up dumping in more ketchup, some soy sauce, more tabasco, mustard, and some vinegar to bring out all the flavors. It turned out great. It went really well with the smokey taste of the pork.

this was delicious. i added 1/4 cup extra ketchup and bourbon. i also added 1/4 cup of OJ and pinch of chili powder and cayenne. It was a great sauce. My first application of it was on bbq chicken and pineapple pizza and it made the pizza.

Overall fantastic. I subbed in chipotle mustard and blackstrap molasses because that's all I had on hand. The combo of added spice and dark flavor of molasses were over powering. (ok, lesson learned) Yet an addition of some honey and more ketchup evened things out just fine and made for a great "on fuego" bbq sauce. Very thick.

Spec-friggin-tacular! I use heavy molasses, real onion and garlic minced super-fine, and add some real maple syrup to the mix. It is simply the best I or my family has ever tasted, with the immeasurable added benefit of being smokey without using the gut-wrecking liquid smoke!

Very good sauce...like any bbq sauce, it is open to your imagination and personal taste. I used all the ingredients in the recipe and then added to taste. We used more liquor (Jack Daniels) than stated in the recipe and added liquid smoke (a must in my book). I agree that it doesn't smell particularly good when cooking but it had a nice smokey flavor with some heat that sneaks up on you. I made this in advance to give the flavors time to meld. I found that the heat diminished somewhat over a couple of days so next time I plan to add some chipotle chili powder for a bit more depth. Another future addition will be pureed smoked tomatoes substituted for some of the ketchup, yum! We served this over shredded Boston Butt that we slowed cooked for about 13 hours....it was delicious! Will definitely make again.

This sauce was very yummy - the only complaint being that the aroma was overbearing. We made this for a party, and people seemed a little scared to eat it when they first had a wiff. But it turned out to be not as spicy hot as the scent seemed. Turned out really nicely - we served it over roast beef on onion rolls.

I carmelized some finely diced onion, green pepper, jalapeno and garlic in a bit of olive oil. added some ancho chili pepper and then deglazed with a bit of the bourbon. came out awesome

A little on the sweet side, but a great sauce overall. Used carmelized onions, smoked paprika and a little balsamic vinegar...YUM!

This was hands down the best barbecue sauce I ever made. My fiance is a huge fan of KC style spareribs and sauce and he thought this was very good. Wasn't sure about "light" molasses. Couldn't find any. So, I used 1/2 c. packed light brown sugar. Also used 2 tablespoons of hot pepper sauce (Crystal) instead of 3. Yum, yum. Finger lickin' good is an understatement!

Not all hot sauces are created equal and do not confuse Tabasco sauce with generic hot sauce. My experience with hot sauces such as Frank's is that they are much milder. Therefore judiciously choose your hot sauce and the quantity that you prefer, and I think you will get much more consistent results.

I had to modify this recipe by putting 1 teaspoon Tabasco, thought 2 tablespoons must be a misprint. I also used 1/2cup brown molasses sugar instead of molasses, and added 1 teaspoon of beef stock powder. I'd suggest cocking a lid in the simmering period so it doesn't splatter everywhere. The bourbon flavour is also mild and more could be added (aqs in all alchoholic recipies ;).

I think this was a great recipe. I substituted colemans mustard powder and vinegar for the Dijon.I think a suace with heat that sneaks up on you is a real treat.

My favorite homemade sweet barbecue sauce. People always notice the bourbon flavor, but don't recognize it. I think it's better after it sits a few days, but I use it right off the stove all the time. Adjust the heat to your taste. I use it pretty much full strength. If you use hot paprika (vs sweet) then skip the hot sauce.

Couldn't taste the sauce because of the heat of tobasco. Will try only because it's Steve Raichlin and will leave out the hot.

This recipe was very easy and delicious! I didn't use hot chilli paste for our 2 year old daughter, but it still turned out great! This dish would definitely be added to our anual July 4th barbecue.

This is a delicious BBQ sauce - rich and spicy. No comparison to store-bought sauce!

Well, I followed most of this recipe, with the following exceptions: I used dark molasses because that is what I had on hand; used much more garlic powder, probably closer to 1 tablespoon than a teaspoon; I used more bourbon (Jim Beam), probably double what the recipe called for. The results: Wonderful. I made this for a friend and I, and used it for a pork tenderloin I did on the grill. It had a tanginess yet a kick from the bourbon. I used it on chicken breasts the next day, didn't think it did much for the chicken. I would definitely use it again on pork and would love to try it on beef.

Excellent Texas-Style (sweet) sauce. I think it's better after it sits in the fridge for a few days, but it's fine right off the stove, too. If you have store sauce in the fridge, you should throw it out and keep this sauce in the empty bottles.

Those that didn't like this sauce seem to lack the ability use the recipe as a point of departure and to adjust to taste. Recommended changes/enhancement: caramelized onions in lieu of powder. roasted red pepper balsamic vinegar with or in lieu of W. sauce, a little honey, shallot pepper...have fun! Wild Turkey 101 highly recommended! And use the Cooks Illustrated rib recipe (slow cook 4 hours @ 270 after brining)! Broke da mout!!!

This recipe is a complete waste of good bourbon (Makers Mark) as well as the rest of the ingredients - just a mish-mash of stuff with no flavour that I found realy great. WOULD NEVER MAKE AGAIN

I don't think so, but maybe I mismeasured the Tabasco. This sauce burns to the point of not being edible, and I generally like spicy foods.

Quick and tasty.... and very respectable in a pinch - for a spectacular variation - see Barefoot Contessa's recipe - makes alot and keeps well in the fridge - has alot of ingredients but the end result is beyond compare!

Finally a sauce that is as flavorful and spicy as my husband likes. It's fabulous and embarrassingly easy. For those who like a milder sauce, try cutting back on the red pepper sauce by 1 or 2 tablespoons.

This sauce has replaced a recipe that I had been using for over 20 years. It is easy to prepare, stores well and even the most sensitive of users find it not too hot.

This was a great base to marinade as well as basting. If you use enough you won't need it for extra sauce. I put it on ribs and chicken and both worked very well! I will definately use this sauce regularly/

I loved this recipe because it is as delicious as many other barbecue sauces I have made that were more time-consuming. Used with grilled chicken--on to ribs!

Ribs were great, as always. Sauce was nasty. I did like the bourbon flavor, though. Won't be making it again.

YUM - I'll never buy bottled barbecue sauce again! This was very easy to prepare and fabulously delicious - my husband and I really savored our slow-cooked BBQ chicken with this sauce frequently applied during the cooking process. The one revision I made was to use 2 TBL of Tabasco hot sauce and 1 TBL of Tabasco green jalapeno sauce, and it was spiced just right for us this way. I will definitely make this a staple for barbecuing.

Wonderful -- and sooooo easy! After my big disappointment with a different barbecue sauce from this website, I was worried about that this recipe would be too sweet and soupy like the other one. However, I soon discovered why Steven Raichlen is The Barbecue King. For me, this sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and tang, and I was finished in about 20 minutes. I used up most of it on my Kansas City spareribs (also on this website), but I think the leftover sauce will taste fabulous on some grilled chicken.
