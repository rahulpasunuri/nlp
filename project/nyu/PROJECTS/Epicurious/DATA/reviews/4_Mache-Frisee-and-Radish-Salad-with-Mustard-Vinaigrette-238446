My whole family loves this salad. The dressing is great and the chives, I think, add something special. We used our cheap Japanese mandolin to slice the radishes into very thin slices which vastly improves the taste (more subtle) and texture of radishes. We've used various packaged lettuce mixes and all worked well. Thumbs up!

A really nice vinaigrette to keep on hand, although I must admit that we used it not on the salad in the recipe but on bitter greens, roasted pears and red onions, a little bit of feta.

I made the recipe exactly as written & it was wonderful! A great light salad before a big heavy braised short ribs meal, perfect for the occasion! My 10 guests loved it & asked for the recipe. The ultimate compliment in my book! I think the key is a really good quality coarse ground mustard, really gives the salad the "zing".

I used a "mache mix" which included frisee (the store didn't have frisee heads). I also didn't have shallots so I used minced sweet onion. I wasn't sure about the vinaigrette when I tasted it, but when tossed with the salad it was wonderful. I passed crumbled blue cheese at the table, which made it even better. I served the salad with a spicy clam linguine and it was a great meal. My guests raved!
