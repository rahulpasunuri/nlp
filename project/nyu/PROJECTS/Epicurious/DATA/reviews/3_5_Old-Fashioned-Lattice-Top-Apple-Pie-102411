Fantastic Recipe! My first time making a pie and I'm on my 4th time making this now. I add cinnamon but that's the only difference. It is delicious and not too difficult!

It was my first time making an apple pie and this recipe worked out so magnificently. I used peanut butter instead of shortening and put maybe 3-4 drops of lemon juice. I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. The pie was delicious and a great hit amongst friends and family!

I used a different crust recipe since i did not have vegetable shortening. The filling was absolutely delicious! I also added cinnamon and followed the advice of other reviewers by cutting the lemon juice in half. There were no Golden Delicious apples in the market I went to so I used Gala. It tasted great, but not crunchy (the way I like mine). I would definitely make this recipe again.

Here's how I made this fabulous...the crust is perfect, no need to alter anything. For the filling, I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the lemon juice and peel drastically. I used a combination of granny smith and golden delicious green apples. I also added spice, cinnamon and more nutmeg to the filling. Tasting along the way was imperative. It was a crowd pleaser!

Hands down the best apple pie my family and I have made to date. I tend to use the crust recipe from the cook book Julia and Jacque because it is the best. This recipe embodies the ultimate in tart pie. If you love an apple pie with a tart flavor you will simply adore this.

does anybody have experience with freezing the unbaked dough? The dinnerparty I was supposed to bring dessert to was moved from tomorrow (sunday) to tuesday, and I prepared the dough last night (saturday)- so I would be over the 2-day limit. What do you suggest I do?

I just made this delicious pie (my first pie actually) and it turned out great. The only thing is that even though I lowered the lemon to half, it still turned out a little bit sour. So next time, just a little touch of lemon to give some flavour.

The crust on this pie is AMAZING!! But the pie was just OK. I added less lemon and added some cinnamon and it was pretty good. I will definately use this crust recipe for all pies in the future.

This pie was delicious!! Just like grannies=) I live in Austria and couldn't find vegetable shortening, so I just left out the salt and used peanut butter. Then I added a little more butter and flour (I just followed my intuition there) until I felt like the dough had the right consistency. Make sure to try it!! If your peanut butter is too salty, you may need a bit more sugar. Or do what I did (I forgot to try the dough=) ) and melt some apricot marmelade, mix in a bit more sugar and glaze the crust before filling in the apples. It was soooo good!!=)

This was fantastic. Cut back on the lemon peel and all else is great. The crust is the best I have ever made. I use this crust recipe for any pie I make now.

I've made this pie many times. While I've always really liked it, I thought it was a bit heavy on the lemon, so this time, I halved the amount of lemon and lemon zest, and added about 1/8 tsp of cinnamon. I think next time not cut it down that much - maybe I'll lessen the lemon and zest by 1/4. All that said, I'll most definitely make it again....and the crust is amazing.

Crust tasted great! Crunchy and flaky. Needs more dough because the lattice can be challenging. Make at least 1/4 more so there is extra to work with. Thicker pieces were easier to work with. Filling was definitly too lemony and tangy. Tolerable but not the best classic recipe.

Forget the filling--what's good here is the crust recipe--the best I've found. Consistently gives a flaky golden crust that lightly sweet and not at all pasty. Work the dough between sheets of saran wrap for best results.

Pretty. That's it. Delicious apples are the most boring of all apples, especially for pie. Why not use really great pie apples, (greenings , Pippin, heirlooms , etc. )or a mixture?

I totally did not like this recipe. It looked amazing but once you bit into it, i realized that looks can be deceiving! The lemon zest was a bit too much and the nutmeg was not enough to give the pie flavor. I honestly had to throw the pie away.

This pie looks great and the braiding is easy once you get the hang of it. However, beyond its aesthetic merits, its a rather boring recipe. Everyone certainly raved about the pie but I think it had more do with how it looked than how it tasted... thanks but i'd rather have it taste, rather than look, good.

Very easy to make. I froze the crust for about 10 minutes and then pre-baked it for just 10 minutes. The lattice top looks great (don't roll the dough out too thin for the lattice pieces).

This was a hit with my entire Thanksgiving party, I've already been asked to make it again! The only modifications I did was use Granny Smith apples and left out the lemon peal. The apples were sour enough to give it that zing, so I knew the lemon peal would be too much. Very good recipie, will use again!

I made this for Thanksgiving desert and it was perfect. The crust was buttery and the filling was great with the golden delicious apples. I added a couple of granny smith (just for good measure!), a few pieces of candied ginger, and a bit of cinnamon. The family loved it and I will be making this again.

I love to bake, but have never had good luck with pies ... until now! This pie was amazing! Simple, yet delicious! (I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and didn't even taste the lemon peel.) My son has never liked apple pie until he tried this one, and my husband and daughter (both apple pie addicts) thought it was the best one they'd ever had!

I have made this recipe a couple of times now, and it has become one of my favorite recipes. The only changes I have made...I reduced the lemon juice to 1/2 Tbls., and I used pink lady apples.

I really liked the pie crust recipe, but the filling was a little sour.... way too lemon-y. I think it was the lemon zest. I think I'll try a new recipe next time.

This has become a signature dish for me. The crust is fantastic and flakey and the lattice top, while easy to do, really impresses family and friends. Or maybe my family and friends are easy to impress! I've made this apple pie at least three times now - always to rave reviews.

A very good, straight-forward, simple apple pie. I added cinnamon and allspice (1/8 tsp. ea.) which was perfect if you like a little spicier pie. Topped with vanilla ice cream.....delicious!

I never have good luck making apple pies -- the apples turn out mushy or the center turns out soupy, but this pie was awesome. I used Granny Smith apples instead of Golden Delicious, so the pie was a bit tart, but a scoop of ice cream balanced that just fine. The crust was the best part -- it was flaky and moist without getting soggy. Be careful to keep the crust a bit on the chilly side when you roll it out, as it becomes impossible to work with as it gets warm. I will definately make this again.

everyone who tried it loved this recipe. I would deffinitly make it again, and give out the recipe.

This is the best apple pie ever. My s/b is an apple pie afficianado and he loved it. In an email the next day he wrote, "I had two more pieces last night ... I liked it a lot. One of the best, if not the best, apple pies ever. The crust was just right - flaky yetfirm, with a good amount of cinnamon sugar, and the filling was just right."

I have tried several other apple pie recipes, and this one is my absolute favorite. I'll use this one from now on unless seriously prompted to try something else. I used Fuji apples, which turned out delicious, and placed a baking pan covered with foil under the pie to catch the juices in the oven. I also went ahead and put a little cinnamon in it.

I have made this crust twice now. Everyone who tasted it said it was the best apple pie - ever. I had to cut back on the amount of ice water because the pie dough was too mushy. Also I used Stayman apples that we had picked the same day in a local orchard, not Golden Delicious.

Apple pie is too lemony. I would change your recipe as published here by: My favorite uses 1 to 2 T. flour depending on how juicy apples are. Eliminate lemon, add 1/8 t. salt, 1/2 t. cinnamon, and most importantly, dot with 1 T. of butter or margarine on top of apples before putting on crust top, which thickens a watery filling liquid.

This was my first Apple Pie, so I ran the recipe by my Mom, and she said "all the tricks" were there: ice water, chilled shortening, etc. The crust was fantastic, VERY tender, due to mixing and handling it as little as possible, as suggested. The filling, on the other hand, was a little too "lemony", which was mentioned as a positive in another review, but I found it a little overpowering in such a subtle recipe, and will cut back on it when I make it again.

I have not had much luck with apple pies in the past; they always tasted boring. This one was great! It tasted quite fresh with the lemon flavor shining through. It takes alot of work so I'll likely do this on very special occasions.

Where did I go wrong? This was my first homemade apple pie. The crust was delicious, but the filling was sorely lacking-not enough sugar juciness. It ended up being dry in the middle, which didn't fly with my applepie fanatic boyfriend.

I usually use granny smith apples for apple pie but golden apples were fabulous in this recipe. I didn't quite get the hang of the lattice, but the taste was wonderful and my guests felt the same way. I couldn't resist adding a bit of cinnamon, though!

By far the best pie crust I have ever made. My daughter-in-law loved the pie and wants the recipe. Now does that tell you something.

I agree, lots of apples, and makes a very good pie. One of these days I'll be able to make a lattice crust like the one in the picture, but until then it tastes just as good.

a lot of apples and great crust
