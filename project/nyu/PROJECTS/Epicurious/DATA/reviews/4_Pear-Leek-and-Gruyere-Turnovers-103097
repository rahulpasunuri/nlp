I cut dough into squares. Found them too much dough to filling, but filling more would have burst them... so next time I would roll them out thinner. Drizzled with truffled honey. It was good- but not great- considering the calories. I just thought the filling could have used 'something'.

These have become a Thanksgiving tradition in my family over the last couple of years. I make a double batch ahead of time, freeze them & then bake them off to have as a starter with some bubbly while we make dinner. They are time consuming, but I make them a little easier by cutting the dough into squares instead of rounds (it makes the dough go a little further too). To me these are the perfect combination of fall flavors. Every time I serve them someone who is trying them for the first time asks for the recipe

These were lovely and tasty, but I felt like the filling collapsed so much that the ratio of filling to dough was a bit off. I like the idea of the phyllo cups and will try that next time. Guests liked it and asked for the recipe, so I will try again.

Very time consuming for me. End result was lovely. I did make 2 kinds, one with puff pastry and the other with phyllo. I liked the phyllo more due to the texture (crunch). Will make again for special occasion.

So i Freeze them before i bake them right ? do i need to defrost before i pop them into the oven , and does the baking time change?

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful. I couldn't find any puff pastry at the store so I bought phyllo dough, cut them to size, and created little phyllo cups in a cupcake tin. I put the filling inside of each little cup and baked it like that, semi-open faced. Each guest got their own mini quiche type thing!

To cook from Washington I tried these open and they were delectable. I did make the rough puff pastry from the site that is so easy and freezes well. l like it when serving squares as our puff in Oz tastes a bit dry, but wouldn't bother for enclosed. 2" worked well to get a good amount of topping on. I added fresh Thyme & did some w gorgonzola. (Caramelized onions topped with wild rocket and a drizzle of caramelised balsamic and shaved parmesan is good too!) everyone had different favorites

I wonder if you could make this open-faced, on squares of pastry, like a tart rather than like a turnover? Has anybody tried that?

This recipe is definitely going into my appetizer repertoire. Made appetizer size (32 pieces from two sheets of puff pastry) to bring to a dinner party and they were devoured. Smaller size worked fine.

Served these to friends (along with many beers) while watching the rugby (Wallabys) at home. Halved the sugar and included a bit more Gruyere. Cut pastry into squares and made smallish triangles. In addition to egg, smeared the top of each pastry with a good swipe of bought honey/mustard stuff in a jar (very good with cheese). Pulled two trays of these lovely golden puffs out of the oven to absolute raves! Will make another batch and freeze ahead ready for another occasion.

so wonderful! it was too cold out to go to the grocery so i used onion instead of leek, and brie & pecorino instead of gruyere. so, pantry staples are all that are really required here - you can't go wrong with any classic pairing of fruit and cheese in puff pastry. it turned out fantastic!

i doubled the recipe for a brunch... used smoked gouda. YUMMY. rolled pastry out.. cut into 12 pieces. didnt use honey but will try next time. leftover filling great in omelet...

These are absolutely delicious. It is also possible to make them as appetizers by using a glass to cut out smaller turnover shells. The smaller versions are a little harder to close but worth it for parties and such where finger foods are called for.

I tried making these with the smoked Gouda that was recommended and I thought it was horrible. I've been a professional chef for years and I hated the ham-my taste it gave it and it covered up every other taste in the recipe. What's the point of even bothering to put other ingredients in if you only taste the one ingredient? I'll have to try to make the recipe again with plain Gouda and see how that goes -- I had such high hopes for this recipe...

Made these for the first time tonight, and I will be making them again and again! Based on a previous review, I tried to make them into 2x2 inch squares. I also rolled the dough out quite a bit since many reviews noted a high proportion of dough to filling. WOW! Wonderful little purses of well balanced taste!

My dinner guests and I loved these. I cut the pastry into eight squares and made triangle shaped turnovers. Next time I'll make extra filling as I found the puff pastry-to-filling ratio a little high.

Cut the pastry into six squares, and added some brandy and chopped sorrell to the mix. Yummy.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes, and I've been making them for 5 years. I won an appetizer contest with these. I have made a few adjustments, though. First, I cut them 2x2 squares and serve as appetizers. Second - and this is key - I use SMOKED GOUDA. It makes them more savory, and they taste like they have ham in them. I also drizzle w/ honey. I know it sounds wierd, but that is what makes them outstanding. You have the smokey cheese with the leeks with the sweet. Yum. I also garnish with the green part of the leeks cut on a diagonal. Outstanding!!!!

This is delicious! I cut the puff pastry into 9 or so little squares and made bite-size turnovers and sprinkled extra gruyere with the chives on top. They were gone before I knew it, thanks to my boyfriend.

I loved this - the rich taste of the sweet pear with the Gruyere cheese was excellent! I simplified the process & cut the dough into four equal rectangles - they looked fabulous, and none of the dough was wasted.

We served this for lunch with a green baby green salad and it really hit the spot. It was verly good for the amount of time that it took.

Although these were delicious, they were not quite savory enough for me. I think next time I will halve the sugar and sprinkle a savory cheese on top of the puff pastry before baking. Yummy!

There's enough extra pastry dough to make around 2 more turnovers, so next time I'd make 1.5 - 2 times the filling, stuff the turnovers more generously and have 2 extras!

Fantastic and easy to make. I made them smaller, appetizer size. We finished them the next day for breakfast. Don't scrimp on the filling, stuff 'em up good.

Excellent mix of flavors, creating a savory treat! I used crescent roll sheets instead of puff pastry sheets (Couldn't find puff pastry. Are they the same thing?) and they turned out well.

I've made this quite a few times and it's always fabulous. I use white truffle honey instead of regular honey. It adds to the already interesting combination of flavors. This is one of my favorite appetizers!

I made a double batch for a baby shower brunch I was involved in. They were delicious, but a fair amount of work. I had quite a bit of filling left over. I would definitely make them again, but not if I had a lot of other cooking to do.

Got great reviews. It smelled so good baking. I made some adjustments with what I had on hand and they turned out fine. I used apple pear and fuji apples, dried chives and added chopped poached chicken and made them triangular in shape. MMMMM, good eating. I also cannot imagine drizzling honey or maple syrup over these as others mentioned.

I had to make appetizers for 2 vegetarians at our party...what a hit! I had to give out the recipe to meat lovers as well. I used the processed gruyere in the cubes (what husband brought home) and just cut them into chunks. I made these quite small, just a two bite nibbler. Great companion with hot, spicy appy's or meat appy's.

Rating: 2
These were not as great as all the rave reviews lead me to believe. The pastry was the best part, while the filling was boring and ...dare I say...weird. The pear was too sweet and didn't mix well with the savoury leeks. I was disappointed and won't make these again.

Rating: 3
More like a 3.5 than a 3, this is elegant and delicious. As appetizers (16 mini-turnovers per sheet of puff pastry), these were a bit troublesome to make. I substituted Fuji apples for the pears, since I needed to use them up. In the future, I'll leave these as full-size turnovers for a starter course or a light lunch with a salad, as recommended.

This recipe is a keeper! Made it for a small dinner party - everyone raved! Perfect as is and hide a couple for the next day - yummy leftover!

I never would have thought to put these ingredients together, but they are delicious. The leeks are great to use since they aren't as potent as regular onions. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who needs an appetizer.

When I saw lovely pears in the supermarket I came to Epicurious and looked for a nice pear recipe - made these turnovers as an appetizer. They were very savory and subtle (and went very well with red or white wine). The ones I made were a bit too big so I'll make them a bit smaller next time. I have some leftover pecorino I'll add when I make them again tonight. [Frankly, I can't imagine putting honey or syrup on them.]

Made these as an appetizer for a New Years Eve party and they were a huge hit. I cut out the puff pastry with a large glass and made small half moon shapes. I also added a little bit of a sharper cheese. Made them and froze the night before and just popped them in the over frozen. Had some leftover filling which I put in an omelet the next day - YUM!! Can't wait to make again.

Excellent combination of flavors in the filling! This is a definite possibility for the menu for my wedding reception.

Rating: 3
Going into my party menu. Looks good, can be formed and chilled ahead of time, tastes great hot but still tastes fine at room temp. To be less wasteful and to save time, I cut each sheet of pastry into (3x3) 9 squares instead of 4 circles -- worked great and I plan to do squares again in the future. The only thing I'd change is to increase the proportion of filling to pastry, so next time I will roll the pastry even thinner and increase the overall amount of filling somewhat. I didn't try drizzling this with syrup or honey because I didn't think it needed any more sweetness.

Ah, the aroma! Mmm, the flavor! I froze them (both baked and unbaked), and they were wonderful either way. Definitely an audience-pleaser. Wish I had one now...hot!

This was a fantastic appetizer, easy, make ahead, and delicious. Rather than making only 4 large pastries, I made 12 small individual pastries. I didn't drizzle them with honey, I'll have to try that next time, but everyone loved them! They were gone with in minutes!

I don't know what happened, but the filling had a sour aftertaste. I don't know if maybe the leeks weren't fresh enough? They looked fine but smelled "off" as I was cooking them (only my second time using leeks). I can see that this could be delicious, though, and will give it another try, but not on the day of my party!

I've made this recipe twice now, and each time it has received rave reviews. I served it with asparagus salad with sweet balsamic vinegar and sausage links with apricot mustard glaze, also from epicurious. The turnovers seemed to seal more securely without using the egg glaze, just pinching the dough together and then crimping with the fork. One time I drizzled the turnovers with honey as suggested by a previous reviewer, one time I didn't, and both times they were delicious. You can't go wrong trying this recipe!

Oh My. OK: FOrget thge honey, in my mind, as it does not need the distraction. I have done this two ways: cut them in sqares like ravioli, and wrapped the whole darn thing in one puff pastry and then cut in slices. both work well, but the second makes it a first course as opposed to appetizer. This freezes like a dream!

I made these one day in advance, separated them w/ wax paper & refrigerated them. We had an emergency the day of the dinner party and had to wait until the following day to bake them. They were still excellent! I used a 3" biscuit cutter and rolled them to 4", and substituted smoked gouda. They were sweet enough w/o the honey.

Amazing...served as an appetizer at a dinner party. Everyone loved it. I also drizzled the honey on top after they finished baking and used smoked gouda cheese

My guests would not stop raving over this appetizer - they loved it. I drizzled honey over them as suggested, and served them hot. Make sure you seal them tight and poke enough holes in the pastry so the filling doesn't leak out. I may try substituting a different cheese next time.

I made these turnovers for a holiday party and they were a huge success. I made them the night before and froze them, separating them with parchment paper. Worked like a charm! I added a key ingredient when they came out of the oven that made a huge difference: I drizzled honey over them. Yum!

I've never worked w/ puff pastry but have with phyllo. It was amazingly simple compared to phyllo and actually fun to make. I followed the directions except made smaller rounds for appetizers and used Swiss/Gouda as recommended by reviewers. I was in a big rush and threw them together. Put them in the freezer for 10 min instead of fridge for 20 as recommended. They still came out great and looked perfect. Got lots of compliments. Next time I'll try Smoked Gouda and make ahead.

Make this and blow your guests away! The flavors are a wonderful blend. Be careful closing up the packets so that the ingredients don't seep out the side.I made squares because they waisted less pastry and were easy to cut when filled - think ravioli.

My first ever experience working with phyllo and i wouldn't call that part of it a success. What a mess. Would help if the instructions were clearer, but in the end it tasted delicious, and I'll just have to learn how to work with phyllo. Am contemplating making this with flour tortillas as a less difficult (and admittedly less delicate) treat next time.

I made this recipe as one of several appetizers at a party celebrating my son's baptism (I scaled down the portion to bite-size). It was the hit of the party, and several people requested copies of the recipe! The turnovers were fairly easy to make, and I was able to make them ahead of time, freeze them, and then bake them when the party got going. The combination of ingredients is unique, with a combination of sweet and savory flavors. This is a recipe I will definitely make again.
