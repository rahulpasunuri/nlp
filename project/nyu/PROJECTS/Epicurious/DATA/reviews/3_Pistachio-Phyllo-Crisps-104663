These are great with the custard. You could also make a funky shaped "shard" and stick it in the custard then garnish with the berries. I prefer this, as you can see the crisp better.

To the cook from Cooklyn- "It" is a chai-spiced creme caramel...The recipe is in here. Yummy!

Okay, so I'm really desperate to make these... just as soon as I figure out what I'd be making. The photo looks like a creme framboise number but the recipe is nothing of the sort. Either way, I'll go with it if you (who've made it B4 will just please tell me what "it" is.

A simple enough recipe, although I prefer to increse the amount of the pistachio paste.
