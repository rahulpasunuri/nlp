Really needs something-perhaps jalapeno? I read other reviews then divided in half and tried both the chicken broth and water and used smaller amounts as suggested. Hmm - didn't like the chicken broth one, just odd. Maybe omit onion and add sweet red pepper as some suggested and either jalapeno or green hot sauce. Not sure I'd make it again.

I tested it before I made it for a lunch buffet. I agree that it needed something so I used chicken "better than boullion" - triple strength - instead of plain water and added much less liquid overall. I used the pre-cut/peeled fresh mangoes from Costco (couldn't find frozen) so that saved a bunch of time (but not $$). They are pretty hard so the soup didn't get too mushy but it wasn't all that mango-y either. I personally love cilantro but I had it in a bowl beside the soup so that people could add their own since some folks hate it. Also added both green onion and chopped red pepper for color.

I used red pepper instead of the onion and chicken stock instead of the water. It was delicious! For a large buffet lunch, we served it in small stemmed plastic glasses.

Ugh, Where oh where did I go wrong? I agree with all the negative comments...too bland...not salty, not sweet, not limey, not anything. I used a touch of regular onion, maybe that's what wrecked it..maybe. I will not make again. Disappointed because the recipes on Epicurious have, up to now, been sensational. And I live in Thailand...the best mangoes are here. sigh......

This soup is wonderful, very refreshing. We both want to have it again soon. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the salt and the extra two cups of water.

I'm not used to cold soups, but I thought I'd give this one a try since I love mangoes and cucumbers. The result was remarkable. I didn't have red onion, so I replaced it with chopped red pepper. The soup was refreshing, and it reminded me of a green mango popsicle sprinkled with salt.

My idea summer food - light and refreshing. Make sure your mangoes are nice and ripe!

Excellent. I used fresh mango, cukes from my garden, and also used chicken stock--thanks for the tip--and served the soup w/ a dollop of sour cream and fresh chives.

I didn't have the problems with the soup being thin that other reviewers mentioned. I was really happy with the way the flavors worked together and the texture was really nice. I used kosher salt and upped the amount just a bit.

Always get rave reviews when served. Make it a day ahead, and add cilantro and salt just before serving. Flavors blend beautifully.

I made this with some of the suggested changes (primairly, chicken stock instead of water). I thought it was pretty good. My guests liked it quite a bit. I also made the pureed portion with frozen mangos, which saved some time (both in cooling and chopping). I think it still needs something else - maybe jalepano or more mango?

THE SOUP IS TOO "BLAND" NEEDS MORE MANGO. CHICKEN STOCK IN PLACE OF WATER.

This soup was wonderful. The best word for it is zesty. I did only add a third of the water suggested in the recipe. From what others have said in their reviews, I suspect that change made all the difference.

This soup was way too thin and needed something else to give it a more complex flavor.

Super lunch with some crusty french bread and great white wine. Perfect on a hot summer day. We love cold soup and this one was fabulous...would recommend highly!!

I followed this recipe to the letter, using measuring spoons and cups, and the end product was something that neither I nor my husband enjoyed very much. My husband called it a 'one timer' soup--he'd eat it this one time, but no need to make it again for him. I liked this recipe even less. It didn't feel great to have spent so much time and expense buying/prepping the ingredients and find the soup very strange tasting--a marriage of flavors that was never intended to occur!

We enjoyed this soup as did my guests. I used it as the first serving for a Breast of Duck dinner. I will make it again and share the recipe with others.

Fabulous on a hot Florida day

FYI, I used frozen mango chunks (available at Costco or grocery stores), much, faster to prepare...

It was very easy to fix. I did not add all the water. All my guests enjoyed it.

No one would believe how easy it is to make this delicious soup! I think the salt is a little much, though--I'll cut the amount next time. This is my new favorite summer soup.

Extremely easy and tasty summer dish. I used one cup less water than the recipe suggested and it was perfect that way.

The taste was wonderful. Great complement of flavors. I changed the recipe and added apple cider ( read one other comment about adding apple juice and it sounded interesting)in the place of the water and cut the liquid by 3/4.I like a thicker soup.

My boyfriend and I liked the concept of this soup, and how easy it was to make. We thought it would turn out to be really subtle. I think that adding 2 cups of water at the end made it watery and bland. I would try 1 cup of water to taste.
