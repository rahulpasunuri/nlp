Cripsy, flaky, cheesy, fresh. The flavors of this recipe unfold in layers as you savor each bite.

Excellent party appetizer - good warm or cold. Would recommend buttering edges before baking.

This recipe was a disappointment. The pesto part was really good, but the rest of it was really bad. I don't think I'll make this again.
