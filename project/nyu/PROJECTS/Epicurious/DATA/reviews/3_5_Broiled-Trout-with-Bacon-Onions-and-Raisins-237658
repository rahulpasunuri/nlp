We enjoyed this greatly. The blend of sweet (raisins and caramelized onion) and salty (bacon) and tart (vinegar) was very good. I didn't think it too sour but perhaps just a touch less vinegar would be okay. I wouldn't want to lose too much of the tartness that balances the sweet and salty flavors. I'll definitely make this again, especially for company.

Quick and easy to prepare this delicious recipe. We didn't have raisins, so I used dried cranberries, a perfect substitute for the holiday season.

As suggested by other reviewers I reduced the red-wine vinegar to half of the suggested amount. Unfortunately I don't have a broiler in my new oven and had to pan fry the trout. My wife loved the dish just the same.

most definetely make it again, I will just use half of vinegar next time, because sauce turned out a bit tart. Overall - excellent recipe!

i added rosemary at the end bc i felt like the sauce was too tart/vinegary. i also added a tablespoon of butter at the end.

Delicious. Only had half the red onion on hand, but I think it was plenty.

Loved this recipe! Delicious and simple. I was worried that I would find the sweetness of the raisins overwhelming but found that the red onion balanced it nicely. Will definitely make again.

Used trout fillet instead of the whole fish, but other than that stuck to the recipe. Very tasty, definately exceeded expectations. Next time I would use a finer dice on the onions as the big chunks were too big, and would use thick-cut bacon.

Delicious and quick. My husband loved it, so did my chef sister. Substituted dried tart cherries for rasins and apple cider vinegar for red-wine vinegar. Also just broiled the trout with bones and pulled them out after cooking. Would make this for company.

We grilled the trout instead of broiling and it was great! The onion relish w/raisins and bacon really added alot of flavor to this dish.
