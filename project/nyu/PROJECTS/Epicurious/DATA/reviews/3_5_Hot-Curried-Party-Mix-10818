I substituted arare for the sesame sticks and, as another reviewer suggested, wasabi peas for the half of the pecans. I am not even a big Chex Mix fan and I loved this. I gave it as xmas gifts and people have been asking for the recipe.

A great addition to the Party Mix repertiore. I substituted Cheerios for the sesame sticks (a traditional ingredient for Party Mix for us-called nuts & bolts). Also used whole almonds in most batches (made a few this holiday season) and for most used a combo of hot and sweet curry powder and little or no cayenne (Christmas gifts-so ?? on heat tolerance) Also used salted butter and omitted the addition of salt.

Great recipe. I tweaked it by substituting the the 1 tbs. soy sauce with 1 tbs. sesame seed oil.

This is very similar to my own jacked up version. I add curry powder to the prescribed onion salt, garlic salt, seasoned salt & I use 1T worchestershire sauce as the original calls for. It tastes much better after 2 weeks, and even better after a month. Try to keep it in the house that long though. Just make more than 1 batch. One year, this mix began my weight demise, the slide into overweight-ness, so be warned!

I added rosemary to the mix (yes, I am serious) and sauteed garlic with the butter (took it out before combining. I upped the spice amounts. I also used bagel chips and other treats. Fabulous.

Delicious. A familiar recipe given a little oomph... for a subtle change. Do not compare just enjoy. Be dangerous and experiment with the recipe. Pass the party mix please!

This is a base of a great party mix. Cut down on the nuts, add wasabi coated peas, some worchestersire (sp)?, onion salt and hot pepper. It really needs to cook for 1 hour & 200 degrees and cooled completly. Add broken up rice/sesame crackers (before baking) for additional crunch. I needed more salt (seasoned salt would have been better.

I liked it but thought it needed something to counteract the spiceyness so I threw in some fennel seeds along with the mix.

Tasty, but it will never replace the original classic party mix.

My family has been making this mix since we first tried it when it originally came out. I'm always afraid someone won't like it -- people can be funny about tradition -- but time and again, people have told me how much they love it.
