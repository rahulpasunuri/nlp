I added some chopped prosciutto and instead of marjoram, I used chopped sage (no more than a teaspoon)...it turned out amazing ! easy and delicious !

This was disappointing. I love all the ingredients, but it just didn't come together well. There was a little too much marjoram, and the wine left a bit of an acrid taste. I added a dash of cayenne in response to the comments from others that the recipe was bland - it helped, but just didn't fix the galette. Too bad, but there are many better options out there.

This is an easy dinner and quite good if you add some flavor. I add a couple of tablespoons of sun dried tomato paste to the leek mixture, top the gallette with canned artichoke hearts and sprinkle the whole gallette with a handful of grated parmesan cheese before baking.

Super easy recipe, visually pleasing - but lacked flavor. The goat cheese and leek combo with marjoram was just too mild. Pizza dough was simple, will use cornmeal next time instead of flour to avoid sticking to the pan. Would try it again but not sure what spice to use to kick it up a notch.

This recipe is good but the goat cheese and green onion galette in Weir's "Cooking in the Wine Country" is so superior (and easier to boot!). To the cook who was looking for a crust alternative try the pie crust in the Red Box. Crispy and never sticks, never rubbery and still keeps the recipe easy. I will not make this recipe again since I like the other better but it was worth a try!

Overall, this is a very good recipe, and I've made it several times with great success. However, I think the tube crust is lacking something. I know the purchased crust makes it an easy recipe, but if anyone has any ideas to improve that cardboard-y crust, please share.

This is a very good recipe. The marjoram is a bit overpowering - I would reduce it next time. I had a problem with the crust sticking to the baking sheet - Make sure to either use a pizza stone or grease and flour the baking sheet.

Delicious. Used a pizza stone. Had some trouble with the crust sticking because I forgot the cornmeal. Thinking of all kinds of variations.

We liked this, but found it slightly dry. A drizzling of olive oil might do the trick. The combination of leeks and goat cheese is really very nice, and its easy to do the leek ahead of time.

This is such an easy and delicious dish! I served it with a mesculin salad with balsamic vinagrette and marinated tomatoes. I also substitued basil instead of the marjoram. Tasty, tasty!

This was delicious and very simple to prepare. The flavor was identical to the leek and goat cheese tart served at our favorite French restaurant.
