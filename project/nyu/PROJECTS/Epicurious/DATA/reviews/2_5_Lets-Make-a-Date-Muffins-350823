I think I've cracked the code on these! I made them as written and they were dry and the tops were crumbly. This time I made these changes/adjustments: blended the topping thoroughly in the mixer before I made the muffin butter; that way it clumps together and sticks to the tops. Used a whole stick of butter (sorry). Didn't soak the dates in one layer, but put them in a bowl and covered them with water -- so, more like a full cup. Used an immersion blender to puree them, which yielded a homogeneous thick liquid to blend in. Pureeing in food processor yields little bits + watery liquid, and you have to wash the FP. They were moist and delicious. They taste like sticky toffee pudding but aren't too sweet.

I was a little hesitant to make these after reading the reviews. Made them I did, and while I thought they tasted great, I think the recipe could be ordered more efficiently. Toast the nuts and get your dates ready first; the streusel is the least of your worries. I don't have a food processor, and frankly, even if I had, I don't think you need to use it for this recipe. I just used a potato masher for the dates after they soaked. I also might recommend baking these in muffin cups. They came out of the tins okay, but some of the topping was lost along they way. I agree, too, that they don't really taste like sticky toffee pudding, but they were delicious all the same. One last suggestion: if you, like me, wonder where the spice is and are tempted to add some, don't! These are very good as is.

there was nothing wrong with this recipe, it wasnt bad, but it wasnt worth the calories either. I love the idea and was so excited to make this. Sticky Toffee pudding is a favorite (you must try the haagan daaz ice cream with the same name - divine!) I was sorry to see this didnt live up:(

I only baked these for 20 minutes and they came out dry. Otherwise they tasted fine.

To a cook from Sequim: for what it's worth, isn't it possible that afer that review, epicurious.com fixed the problem? Can't wait to make these-- I've been salivating over the recipe ever since I got this book (Eat Feed Autumn Winter) for the holidays. :) To a cook from Tigard... so, how did they work out? (after you took them out?

This recipe needs proofing! The muffins are baking as I type, but I had to "wing it" on a few things...when to add the date puree, says cream butter and eggs, should be cream sugar and butter. I hope the measurements were accurate! Thanks.....
