Wonderful sorbet...but please don't make the mistake I did. Used 3 T crushed peppercorns instead of 3 T peppercorns crushed! Made it waaaaaaay too spicy!

Wonderful recipe -- will make again. My error - I used 3 T of crushed peppercorns instead of 3 T of peppercorns, crushed -- so it was much too spicy.

wonderful and unique! i have very fresh peppercorns so only used 1 1/2 tbls .also just very coarsly ground it. for the rest just followed the directed amounts. the amount of heat from the pepper is a perfect team with the strawberries and balsamic.

I loved the color and texture of this sorbet. At first I found it a bit too spicy, but I loved the balance of sweetness and spiciness from the peppercorns. Next time I will probably reduce the amount of peppercorns by 1 tbl. I put the peppercorns in a heavy duty plastic freezer bag and crushed them with a cast iron skillet.

I think this is one of the most amazing sorbets I've ever made. Sure, the crushed peppercorns are a bit of a hassle, but well worth the trouble. And I've never had anything but raves for this dish. Haven't made the crisps -- this is great with Nabisco Chocolate Wafers -- but one of these days I might get around to them.

I really enjoyed the flavor of the black pepper and strawberries together. My only complaint is that the resulting sorbet was way too sweet. Our strawberries were really ripe -- we should have used half (or less) the amount of sugar in the recipe and it still would have been plenty sweet.

The sorbet was very tasty. The flavor was great, but the texture was off, but that is really because I don't have an ice-cream maker, so I just froze it as is. At first, I thought the pepper didn't come through, but after a day or so, it was perfect. I agree with a previous reviewer about the beautiful color of this sorbet, and the brilliant combination of strawberries and balsamic. I will make this again, even without an ice-cream maker.

Well, I didn't get an extreme pepperiness from this (I suspect it may be due to age and grind of my peppercorns). The vinegar added a wonderful jammy quality to the strawberry sorbet; giving it a lovely rich hue. didn't bother to make the phyllo crisps.

Original 6/03 - This is a great recipe. The ingredients are one of our favorite summer desserts. It's a great bonus to make it into a sorbet. (Ok, I have not made the crisps yet) I suspect that the spiciness depends on the freshness of the peppercorns and how you crush them. I had very fresh Penzey's peppercorns and smashed them in a plastic freezer bag with an empty wine bottle. I would use only 2 Tbs the next time. I strained the syrup before crushing the strawberries in the blender. But I found no need to strain again. This is a really tasty, elegant sorbet that I plan to make every summer in strawberry season. Update - I have now made the phyllo crisps. They are superb. Easy to make and go nicely with the sorbet; but, they are also delicious by themselves.

We love spicy and used a covered mallet to insure relatively uniform size on crushed peppercorns. Then cheesecloth in a strainer. Flavor there without teeth grinding the pepper.

(From 7/11/02): I think the biggest variable is in the quality, age, and grind of the pepper. Perhaps a previous reviewer might have measured 3T of ground pepper instead of whole peppercorns? Not having a proper pepper mill, I crushed my peppercorns in a plastic bag (and proceeded to spill pepper bits all over the table), with uneven results. As a result, not all of the peppercorns released their oils, but some were crushed fine. The problem is that those small particles passed through my sieve into the sorbet, so the peppery flavor came from the pepper pieces instead of the oils. The sorbet was tasty, but the flavors didn't meld together quite that well. I feel as though some ingredient is missing that would blend the result better. (From 3/23/03): On my second time around, I tried the pink peppercorns as suggested by a previous reviewer, with my new pepper grinder on its coarsest setting. I like the flavor of the sorbet more this way, where I can taste the strawberries, the pepper, and the vinegar. But I still would prefer a smoother texture. In the future I'll experiment with adding dried strawberries or a small amount of alcohol to reduce the iciness of the sorbet.

I didn't taste the pepper in this at all and I even added a few extra grinds from the mill before I froze it. It just tasted like ordinary strawberry sorbet to me. I can't imagine that this would ever be too spicy for someone.

delicious. i used frozen strawberries -- cheap & easy. as for the pepper: the first time i made this, i measured 3 tbps of peppercorns, crushed them a bit with a mortar and pestle, and added that to the recipe. the mortar was a pain to use and many of the peppercorns didn't get at all crushed. i thought that technique was not spicy enough for me, but probably would have been fine for most people. the next time i made the sorbet, i measured 2.5 tbps of very coarsely ground peppercorns (using a mill, so all of them were somewhat broken, allowing them to release the pepper oils) and added that. much more peppery, although i thought the extra spiciness balanced the sweetness much better than the first version.

I served this between salad and entree at a formal dinner party. My client's dinner guests were of VERY conservative palate so I took that into consideration and substituted the black peppercorns with 3Tbls of Pink peppercorns and only a teaspoon of the black peppercorns. They loved it! After a long night, I settled down with a glass of this sorbet and it was quite delicious. (I'm doing a batch for myself right now with the 3T of black, along with 1T of pink. I'm looking forward to it!)

I would make this again, but not use nearly as much pepper. Way too spicy to eat as is. Halve the pepper and then halve it again.
