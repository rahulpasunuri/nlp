I, too, used unpeeled potatoes. Be sure to get them nice and browned and crusty as described. The green onions and lemon really make the spuds taste bright and delicious. Simple and what I call "good grubbin".

Distinctly dissapointing. I'm used to the herbed potatos recipe on this site, so this one didn't compare at all. It was edible all right, but really turned out kind of bland

excellent side dish. Be sure to use nonstick pan, as one of attractions of dish is that it doesn't use too much oil Can increase lemon zest, to taste.

a real superb yet very simple and easy to cook recipe. I even used unpeeled potatoes and somewhat more lemon zest, it turned out excellent!

Nothing to say except - excellent - I have a son who does 'currently' eat potatoes but devoutred the entire dish. I kept looking for it and when I asked him about it, he replied, "oh, that. I ate it". Incidentally he's an adult (25); I think the lemon and lack of grease made it for him. HE IS TICKY!

THE LEMON IS A NICE TOUCH. I ADDED SOME HOT PAPRIKA FOR COLOR AND ZIP!

This is easy and appeals to everyone. Sort of like "hash browns" without the fat. I used new potatoes and left the skins on. A Winner!
