I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a hit! I substitute out the mushrooms and I add spinach, peas and diced tomatoes. I cook the meatloaves in four separate 3" x 5" pans and they come out great - super holiday gifts. When cooking in smaller containers they only need 30-35 minutes in a 400 degree oven. An amazing recipe!!!

This is an amazing recipe. Once made you won't believe that it is made with 50% mushroom or with Turkey, tastes like an amazing beef and pork meatloaf with out the greasiness. one cation though, the preparation is pretty time consuming but well worth it.

LOVED this recipe. Instead of white bread crumbs, I used whole wheat and instead of real milk I used Almond Milk. I also made four individual meatloafs and only needed to cook it for 40 minutes and it was DELICIOUS! My fiance absolutely loved it and never loves meatloaf.

The best turkey meatloaf ever. Have made this more than 10 times. Takes a lot of labor but the outcome is fabulous, healthy and worth the time. Will forever be a staple!

I added a lot more spices than the recipe calls for including sage and more and more garlic and onion, since ground turkey tends to be tasteless and dry.

I've been making this recipe for at least 5 years. I follow the recipe exactly, I just add Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup glaze used in the last step. We're in Italy and the ketchup here is ridiculously sweet (not that it's not that way in the US) so my next sub will be maybe tomato sauce with a tiny bit of brown sugar and worcestershire sauce for the glaze, just to cut down on the sugar. Best meatloaf I've had.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used regular mushrooms because I had them on hand. I served it with cranberry sauce to compliment the turkey. It was delicious and everyone at the table agreed. I'm about to make it again tonight. It's also delicous cold. I know this will be one I'll go to often when company comes.

I've made this several times and decided to try it by carmelizing the onions. This made a real difference in the flavor which was only made better by the carmelization. All in all, a good recipe with a lot of opportunities to improvise as some have suggested.

Loved this. Great "healthier" version of beef meatloaf. I think it even tasted better than my regular meatloaf, and it was more tender. Don't bring it all the way to as high as they say, it'll be dry I'm sure. Use your instincts!

This recipe is as good as my meat version of meatloaf which is my grandmother's much loved recipe. I added 2 eggs and omitted the egg white. I also added some wheat bread soaked in milk in addition to the bread crumbs, plus some chopped celery to the veges. I topped it with low-fat bacon. YUM. I will make this again for sure.

I actually like this better than regular meatloaf. I find it lighter and more flavorful. I served it to a friend who hates mushrooms, but this passed his radar and he happily ate two pieces. It was also happily gobbled up by another friend's child, who proclaimed that he doesn't like ground turkey (we just told him what we were giving him was just meatloaf).

I'm a huuuge meatloaf man, and I eat just about everything, but the texture of the finished loaf leaves a lot to be desired. I couldn't put my finger on it for a while, then I realized it's just like a crab cake. I mean, I like crab cakes, but I don't like crab cake meatloaf.

This recipe was amazing! I love the turkey w/ the mushrooms. You must make the sauce, it is really good. I made it the night before to cut down on time. It was really easy & I am going to use it on everything. I also did as others suggested & doubled the meatloaf batch to freeze one.

Very good. I used lean turkey and lean ground beef. I didnt have creminis on hand so I rehydrated a gourmet mushroom mix. I didnt have worcestershire so I subbed in Harrod's brown sauce (its like a fruity A1). It was moist and wonderful. Per other suggestions, I basted it with a combo of whole grain mustard, Harrod's brown sauce, and a bit of brown sugar.

Rating: 3
very good recipe overall. here's a fun suggestion for making it kid-friendly. instead of shaping a loaf, scoop about 2/3 cup of mixture into greased muffin tin (i lined mine with lightly oiled tin foil for quick clean up). then bake at 420 for 40 min. each person gets their own mini meatloaf!

Great recipe. It's full of great, healthy ingredients and tasted wonderful. I added roughly ground walnuts instead of breadcrumbs (because of gluten)

I love meatloaf, and this is a nice version. The only change I made was using italian-seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain. The flavor was very good, and didn't seem like a turkey loaf.

I'd say this is a delicious recipe (3 forks) but I have to now revise...I've been making this meatloaf for over 2 years and my husband and kids would probably vote it their favorite dish. The mushrooms make all the difference in moisture and meatiness...I make it as written w/o the red pepper sauce...just ketchup is fine.

Made this last night and it was fabulous! Yes, there was a lot of prep--I used my chopper for everything and it was well worth it. I didn't have any of the issues that other reviewers had with it falling apart. Did use the suggestion in the reviews to glaze with ketchup/brown sugar/mustard (I used whole grain) mixture. What a fabulous way to use ground turkey.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! I didn't add the mushrooms because I didn't have any. I also added two whole eggs probably because I'm lazy. Instead of using bread crumbs, I used crackers because that's what I had. I had to add a little more crackers because I used two whole eggs. Overall, it was delicious. I think the only change I will make next time is to add more salt.

This was really good. It was different enough that I would make it again. The only thing I left out were the mushrooms, as part of my family doesn't like them, and I didn't make the sauce...we like mustard

This is a GREAT recipe for everyday meals. It's relatively low fat and very healthy. And best of all it really does taste like meatloaf. I have yet to make the sauce (looks time-consuming). The only change I made was using steak sauce in place of the ketchup (hate ketchup). Slight variation: in addition to the creminis, reconstitute a package of dried mushrooms, chop, and add half to meatloaf mixture. When the meatloaf is done, make a quick gravy in the pan with the liquid from the mushrooms, chicken/turkey broth and sherry. Add the remaining mushrooms. Throw in fresh parsly, rosemary if you have it.

made this several times and its always a huge hit. i leave out the breadcrumbs and milk and instead food process zucchini, carrots, mushrooms and (this time) chard to add in to the mix. i also use only breast meat. i always make at least one extra to freeze for an easy dinner another time.

Basically, I loved this recipe. I'm not a mushroom person, so I used diced celery (read it in previous review) and it worked quite well. I sure would like to find something less sweet than ketchup to put in the mix though! Mine also came out a little moist/fall apart-y.

This is one of the most delicious meatloaf recipes I've ever tasted. Definitely the best I've ever made.

Rating: 4
I rarely take time to comment on recipes, but this one is an exception. I used extra lean turke only, egg beaters, and 8 oz baby portabella mushrooms. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty exactly. I used the food processor to make the bread crumbs, pulverize the carrots and mushrooms, then to chop the parsley. A huge time saver and eliminated the "chunks" that would have turned off the kids. I'll do the same with the onions next time. This was very moist, extremely flavorful, and no sacrifice at all. A huge hit with hubby and two picky kids.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was really delicious. It had such good flavor. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe, just used more breadcrumbs and spread some ketchup over the top before cooking. My husband, who is a chef, raved about it. It's just the two of us, so I made two mini-loaves, cooked one and froze one. Already looking forward to having it again.

For those complaining the recipe is a little to crumbly with the low fat turkey: try adding a bit more egg white to hold the loaf together better. I use pasteurized egg whites from a bottle, almost no fat and a ton of good egg protein.

i made this with lean ground turkey and it was MUCH better than any other turkey meat loaf recipe i've made. the only thing was that it was a bit crumbly. this didn't affect the taste and i would make it again in a heartbeat - but does anyone else have suggestions on how to fix this? (i understand it might be from the lower fat content of the meat, but would still be curious to hear if anyone has a suggestion on how to fix it). either way - delicious!

I found this quite a surprise at how delicious this is. I took the suggestions of added garlic and worcestershire sauce. I could not find cremini mushrooms so used brown. (Will try another store for cremini next time). I cut back to 1/4 cup on the milk as it looked too soupy. I used a family favorite topping instead of just ketchup, I mix, 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 T brown sugar and 1 T prepared mustard.

Excellent and tasty recipe. I followed the other recommendations, doubled the garlic and Worcestshire sauce and added celery. Also used skim milk and only 1/2 cup of whole wheat bread crumbs. This was so good my husband -- who is sadly deprived of red meat thanks to me -- actually licked the plate!

i've actually reviewed this recipe before, but because it's just earned me yet another round of compliments, i thought i'd send my compliments to the recipe again as well! :-) truly, i've been making this meatloaf for years; it's wonderful. and so flexible! i've bent the ingredients a million different ways: gluten free one time, changing the vegetables another and the quantities another time still-- not to mention how good it is followed to the letter! no matter what i've done, this recipe has never been anything except delicious. try it!

Rating: 4
This is probably the best turkey meatloaf I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe pretty closely, only substituting honey wheat bread for the white breadcrumbs, because that's what I had, and using lots more ketchup to brush on top because I like a really caramelized, sweet crust on my meatloaf. I also used 2 carrots instead of one. The flavors were great, and I think the cremini mushrooms really added a nice richness to the meatloaf. Also, cooking the vegetables in advance is worth the extra effort, because they are tender and mellow - the last turkey meatloaf recipe I made tasted like the onions weren't cooked enough, and they were overpowering. My only complaint is that it takes awhile to make this meatloaf; there's a lot of chopping, sauteeing, etc involved. But it's worth it!

I will be making this wonderful recipe for the 5th time today! Every time I make it my family and friends love it! The only change I make to the recipe is I used Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs for a little more seasoning.

This is a wonderful recipe that I am sure will become a regular favorite. I made a few changes. I added minced celery, one stalk, and I doubled the amount of garlic and added two tablespoons of Worscestshire sauce. I also used whole milk. Additionally, I used only dark meat turkey. Finally, I wrapped the loaf in parchment paper before placing it in the loaf pan, cooked it slower at 350 for an hour and increased to 400 for an additional 20 to 30 minutes. It was really outstanding.

Just made this for the second time...first time around I followed the recipe pretty closely, and found that the mixture was very soupy when raw, and when cooked it fell apart very easily, BUT, it tasted great. This time, I did not use the milk and used only one egg, and the consistency was closer to what I wanted to see. The whole family loves this recipe. Even my daughter, who claims to hate mushrooms, enjoys this meatloaf. I think it would also be great with spinach mixed in, and for health nuts, I think 1/4 cup bulgur, wheat berries, or cooked lentils would be also be fun additions.

Rating: 1
I really expected to like this, the ingredients sound great; I didn't change anything in the recipe. But we thought it was just so-so. I didn't have the problems others mentioned with it being too wet or soupy, the texture was fine...just didn't like the flavor that much.

I opened my freezer and found an overlooked - must use or lose package of ground turkey. I love to improvise and the changes I made were great. (and I am sure the original and other suggestions are as well - but since I love to read other suggestions.....here goes) I cut the onion to one cup, doubled the garlic, I left out the carrot - but i did add in 10 ounces of thawed/squeeze dried chopped spinach and some chopped (not in oil) sundried tomatoes (not to the skillet, to the big mixture with hands part. I substituted salsa for the ketchup - but only used about 3 tblsp. I was a little shy on bread crumbs so I added oatmeal to reach the 1 up mark, and lastly I used two eggs (not one and a white) Cooked to 170 as instructed and we gobbled it up!

I followed the directions almost exactly but did not have mushrooms so increased all the other veggies. THe consistency was terrific.

Okay - pretty good but too moist for our taste. We're going to make this again but we will use less milk.We may not use any milk. We also didn't use the carrots or the mushrooms, but we used whole wheat bread crumbs (we made them ourselves) and we used Paul Newman's Sockarooni sauce (which is delicious!). So it was good, but we want amazing meatloaf. If there are any other people who make delicious turkey meatloaf out there that can top this recipe - please let me know!!

This is really good meatloaf - consistently moist, except for the one time I made it with brown mushrooms. That was a mistake. I do cheat on the healthy part and use KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce in place of ketchup. A food processor is a must unless you are doing penance for breaking your diet.

I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I too left out the mushrooms. I substituted radishes for it. I know that sounds weird but it's actually very very good and I recommend you try it sometime.

Based on reviews my expectations were very high! My challenge was it seemed very "mushy" verses 'meaty". And, I have to agree with a few others regarding the blandness factor. For myself, if you factor in the time involved and compare it with the finished product - it's just not worth it.

Rating: 3
Very good. Based on feedback here I also added extra Worcestershire, some of my own homegrown sage and fresh thyme. I substituted portabella mushrooms and decided to break out the Cuisinart to save prep time. I should have "pulsed" the mushrooms but turned the machine on and ended up with a Portabella paste. But when it was cooked down it still worked perfectly. The brown portabella mushroom paste made the ground turkey look a little more like beef once the loaf was made. I shredded the carrots to disguise the fact I was serving something healthy and my daughter didn't notice. I'll add more carrots next time to lighten up the calories. I used mini-loafs for portion control and got to a temperature of 180 in 50 minutes. It was still fine. I did use the extra egg white but this is such a moist recipe I think you could skip it. Egg beaters would work well too. It was great as left overs for my lunch today :-)

This was good but not great. It is moist but does not really have enough taste! I would add spices and probably cayenne pepper next time. The red pepper sauce makes it. For the amount of prep work, the result is not worth it. There are lots of other, easier turkey meatloaf recipes out there.

Fantastic meatloaf recipe. I use ground turkey breast and it still turns out moist and delicious. I only use one egg and do not add an additional egg white. Don't be concerned if it seems a little wet before baking -- bake for 50-60 minutes and it turns out perfectly. Be sure to check with a meat thermometer. My husband and my five- year-old son both love this recipe.

Having never made turkey meatloaf before, I was curious about this recipe. Instead of ketchup, I made a quick tomato sauce from one tomato, garlic and some leftover wine. I used a combo of shitake and regular button mushrooms and it was fine. I recommend chopping everything about the same size if you can. I added a lot more of the tomato sauce on top and a bit more Worcestershire than called for. Will definately make again!! My husband ate two slices the first night and another the next day! (and he hates lefovers!)

I make this all the time and my whole family loves it -- rare for all three kids to be happy. The only thing I do differently is to use whole wheat bread for the bread crumbs (I use the heels) and I bake it in muffin pans to make it more kid friendly. Easy to make and a household staple.

Excellent recipe. I made it at Christmas when staying in a hotel with only a toaster oven and it turned out fantastic. I used store bought breadcrumbs and chopped the mushrooms finely with a knife. I omitted the parsley because my children are opposed to green things in their meat and used a basic poultry seasoning instead.

Fantastic turkey meatloaf! I've never made meatloaf before and this recipe made it turn out really well. I used white beech mushrooms instead of cremini and also added a little bit of crushed red pepper for more spice. I would add a dash more of Worcestershire sauce for more tang next time around. If you don't have a meat thermometer (which I didn't), this recipe definitely takes between 50-60 minutes as it says if you use all white turkey meat like I did. The best part is adding the ketchup to the meatloaf after you've put it in the baking pan and watching it form a beautiful red-brown crust on top as it bakes (exactly like the one in the picture). Unbeatable recipe.

This recipe is so good can easily be modified to taste. I was lazy and didn't want to go to the grocery store, so I omitted the mushrooms, skipped the saute step and grated the carrots and onion directly into the turkey. I omitted the eggs (watching cholesterol--they weren't necessary anyway). I also added a packet of onion soup mix (decimating the Gourmet patina, but whatever). I glazed the outside with a mix of 1 c.tomato paste, 1 T. of brown sugar, and a T. of Worchestershire sauce. I cooked it to a slightly higher temp, but only because the potatoes weren't done yet. It turned out amazingly moist and held together nicely.

This is a very good turkey meatloaf recipe. Usually turkey meatloaf is very dry, not this recipe. I didn't have a carrot so I used celery. I don't like ketchup so I used red wine in the recipe and didn't put anything on top. This meatloaf is moist and has a great flavor. I also made a mushroom gravy (1 onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 lb sliced mushrooms, dash of poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper sauteed with a little white wine until onions are soft and mushrooms are sweating a little; mix 2 tbsp flour and 1 14.5 oz can of low sodium chicken stock add and cook until thick then let sit) and served with mashed potatoes. Excellent, be prepared for the meatloaf to be gray but don't let it stop you from eating it, it is delicious!

This turkey meatloaf was moist and delicious. Highly recommended. I did substitute a few ingredients however. Upon finding some celery in my fridge, I decided to add this to the onion, carrot, and garlic mixture (i doubled the amount of garlic as well). rather than make my own breadcrumbs, I used the store-bought crumbs i bought from the store. i also chose to add barbeque sauce in addition to the ketchup. if you love barbeque sauce, this recipe is for you, try it.

This was pretty delicious. I used portabella mushrooms since my supermarket had no cremini mushrooms. I was worried about using a different kind of mushroom, but it was still very good. If I did it again, I would make sure that when sauteeing the mushroom mixture, ALL of the liquid is evaporated. You might need to let it simmer longer than the recipe says. I used a loaf pan and cooked it for an hour. I also made the red pepper sauce, which was a very nice accompaniment.

Okay, I modified in a big way but, I used the basic premise and this was excellent. I increased the reipce by using one lb. of lean ground turkey and one pound of lean ground pork. I used about the same proportion of onion, perhaps a little more garlic, and added some sauteed fresh poblano peppers(about three) the poblanos really tasted great. Also, I added shredded chedder and jack cheese in the center and then covered the cdheese leaving a nice cheesy center. Awesome!

Great recipe. We sauteed the mushrooms well to ensure all liquid was cooked off and the loaf held it shape fine. We did use a glass baking dish instead of metal with no problems, cooked in 50 minutes.

This was the first meatloaf Ive ever made and I loved it. The sauce was a great source of flavor. It was defintely better the next day microwaved and for a college student, this was a good "meal of the week" type of thing where you eat the same thing two or three times over with some friends. It took a good amount of prep work and cooking time but it was worth it.

I used a red pepper marinara sauce instead of ketchup and it was delicious! Also add red pepper paste if you like it ultra spicy.

We enjoyed this version of meatloaf. It's lighter and healthier than traditional beef. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. I did not really understand why they wanted me to use a 13" X 9" pan so I took a chance and used a normal bread loaf pan and it turned out great. No problems holding it together, cooked about an hour. Loved the suggested roasted pepper sauce! Enjoy!

I followed the directions to a 't' and both I and my GF enjoyed it. The flavors where nice, and with the mushrooms the texture is enjoyable and it there isn't too much meat to overload on. My one complaint is that the mix is very moist and doesn't hold it's loaf shape very well and the finished product was a bit too moist and soft. Leftovers were great, however, so next time, I think I'll just extend my cooking time, to 'dry' it out a bit.

I thought this was great. I like the roasted red pepper tomato sauce. And I liked the light and dark turkey meat. Instead of the ketchup, I added a sweet barbeque sauce. Think it perked up the flavor.

have made this twice, whirring the vegies in the cuisinart. Fast and easy. I used wheat germ the first time and panko the second for the bread. I think this meat loaf is delicious. Next time I may spice it up a bit more with other herbs and a hot pepper or two

I've actually never eaten an old soggy boot...but I imagine it would taste a lot like this meatloaf. It's a mushy, tasteless mess. Almost palatable when served the next day cold in a sandwich...but just barely.

This meatloaf is excellent...worth the effort. I've made it several times, always to raves. Several people have said they prefer it to regular meatloaf. The recipe is good as is but I find the ketchup coating to be too sweet. I now use a spicy roasted garlic tomato sauce and vary the mushroom types. I make a double batch and freeze one. Only problem with this recipe is that when I serve it to friends, there's never any leftovers for sandwiches the next day!

Incredibly moist and flavorful! I put an apple in the food processor to substitute for the carrot, added a little five spice powder and substituted hoisin sauce for the ketchup. The kitchen was filled with fragrance and the result was a sweet and savory meatloaf with an asian twist. This will become a regular on our table.

excellent recipe. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used dried porcini. I also substituted fresh basil & oregeno for the parsley and last but not least, used canned fire roasted tomatoes instead of ketchup. Could not wait to come from work tonight to have leftovers!

I would give this four forks, but it was my first meatloaf, so I can't speak with much authority. Regardless, it was delicious, easy to make, much lighter than I expected and my boyfriend (a big meatloaf fan) devoured it. I made it as written, but used more ketchup on top than the recipe called for.

As I was making this, I was thinking, this is going to be gross. The initial vegetable saute is chunky. And mushrooms and carrots in meatloaf??? But, I remained optimistic based on the rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. This meatloaf is amazing! The vegetables are soft and delicious and impart wonderful flavor. Like the recipe says, after all the ingredients are combined, the mixture is VERY moist. It barely holds its shape. I made the mistake of putting the full 1/4-cup ketchup into the mixture (might have had a little something to do with the excess moisture). But I might make that "mistake" again because it came out great. But don't forget to add the ketchup to the top before putting it in the oven because, yummmm, that's the best part. I also recommend the roasted red pepper sauce. It's worth the extra step if you have time.

I made this tonight, followig the recipe exactly as is (except for baking it in a 9" diameter pyrex dish). Also made the red pepper sauce to go with it. Overall, my wife and I liked it a lot, as it tasted great and was still pretty healthy. I thought the red pepper sauce was a great accompainiment. Only downsides were that the combined recipes were quite a bit of work and resulted in a ton of dirty dishes.

I liked the texture of this meatloaf, but found it far too sweet. Next time, I'll try it without the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and up the garlic and parsley instead. I made it with whole wheat bread crumbs and 1/2 ground turkey breast and it didn't taste lowfat at all

Followed the recipe as written, but used shitakis because that's what I had. The turkey loaf was light and moist with a good flavor. The mushrooms really add to the texture and the flavor. This is good to have in your everyday recipe box and can be even healthier with the addition of more veggies. Next time, I think I'll also add grated zucchini. Will definitely make again.

I am a huge meatloaf fan but my boyfriend doesn't eat beef. This turkey meatloaf was awesome!

I made this years ago and found it moist but a little bland. Just made it again yesterday and with a few tiny changes, it was excellent. I added extra salt and pepper, some dry thyme, cayenne pepper, went a little heavy on the carrot, onion, and egg, and added a little red wine to the pan when the veggies were cooking. Also put the dry spices in with the carrots and onion in order to extract the flavors better, rather than waiting for the watery mushrooms. With just a little more flavoring, it became a real keeper, and I did not even make the roasted pepper sauce this time.

This is a tried-and-true recipe for me. Last night I made it for my mom, who has made many a meatloaf in her time, and she declared it her favorite meatloaf ever.

I *liked* this recipe, didn't love it. The flavor was very good, but I thought it had a mushy texture.

Excellent! I'm a huge meatloaf fan and am pleased to find a healthy, tasty alternative. I used extra lean ground turkey and it wasn't dry at all, (though 7% would have been even more flavorful). I also substituted button mushrooms and added tomato paste to the ketchup. Chop everything in the food processor to save time. Going onto permanent rotation.

I think this is meatloaf beyond compare. This tastes a lot like my usual ground beef meatloaf recipe, but it didn't give me indigestion, even with twice the onions -- how is that possible? I threw all my veggies into the food processor; liked it that way. My mushroom-hating husband gobbled up two thick slices. I topped half the loaf w/ ketchup, and half with ketchup spiced with some Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning (paprika, garlic, chipotle, thyme, rosemary, S&P) and a little extra groung chipotle powder. Nice zip and depth of flavor; I might try adding some Northwoods to the meat mix next time!

Amazing dish and very easy. I also used the 99% lean turkey breast, and in place of the breadcrumbs I used 1/2 oatmeal, 1/2 oat bran. Otherwise I followed the recipe, but you can make so many alterations, I can't wait to experiment. Also a plus is that it's very filling and will get me through the afternoon without having to snack. It makes about a week's worth of lunch and is relatively inexpensive since most of the ingredients are already sitting around the house.

Delicious! My health food store (the only place where I buy meat) didn't have ground turkey, so I used venison, which combined very well with the other flavors. Used oatmeal and ground flax seed to substitute for part of the breadcrumbs, and mixed some barbeque sauce with the ketchup. I think the egg white helps to lighten the loaf -- will definitely remember that trick for future loafs.

I'm very happy with this recipe - especially with all the veggies in it with the rich taste since my better half does not like eating vegetables as much as I do. My first attempt was a mix of the recipe plus previous cook comments. Thank you all for inputting them!! It went over so well that I'm making it as my guy's birthday dinner except with a few other considerations: 1.25 lbs of lean turkey plus 3 links of hot italian sausage (I squeeze the meat out from the casings). Fresh ground basil and 2 pinches of herbes de provence along with the parsley. Finely grinding the veggies and simmering them down with some spare Barbaresco wine. Using teriyaki sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce. Adding 1/3 rolled oats to the bread crumbs for additional healthiness and the big item for me...chilling the mixture for a couple of hours in advance of cooking in order to get a great meld.

This has become a staple at our house! I usually substitute oat bran for the bread crumbs and increase the amount of onion, carrot, and mushrooms to make it healthier (only to top it with bacon!). I usually use button or portabella mushrooms and all white meat turkey too. It always comes out great no matter how closely I follow the recipe. Great healthy comfort food.

I've made this a couple of times with good results each time. It's somewhat time consuming for a week night meal but whatever night you decide to make it, the effort is well worthwhile. I don't change anything but the recipe lends itself to tweaking as others have commented. I think of it as classic comfort food. Served it to guests last night along with sweet potato puree (Gourmet 2005)and roasted broccoli and apple frangipane galette for dessert. It all made for a delicous bistro-like meal.

I've made this several times with good results. This time however, I used barbeque sauce instead of katsup, and added some herbs de provence like another reviewer. I did add some bourbon but not enough to taste. Next time I'll add more. These changes made it ever better for us.

Since we are at the height of vintage food couture, meatloaf has again resurfaced in our household. This meatloaf is INCREDIBLE!

This recipe was simple!! I couldn't tell (neither could my picky kids) that it wasn't beef! I thought it lacked salt, though. I would increase it to 1 1 1/2 tsp. next time I make it, but other than that, the texture was terrific, though I did allow the mixture to chill before forming the loaf, as it seemed awfully wet! I ended up adding a small handful of dried breadcrubs (Probably 1/3 C.) to ensure that it wouldn't fall apart or flatten out during cooking. It did the trick! I think I will top with BBQ sauce next time for a change, but this recipe is my new GOLD STANDARD!

I think my rolled oats probably kept the loaf together, as I had no problems with it falling apart as others did. A keeper.

Excellent! You will feel satisfied AND virtuous because it is a very healthy recipe. How strange, though, the preparation. As a last minute "what can I have for dinner" move, I chose this recipe. Not only did I have ALL the ingredients - SIX of the ingredients I had in the exact amount needed. In other words, after I finished this recipe, those items were gone. To top it off, when I cracked open the two eggs, one did not have a yolk (we have our own chickens - not all eggs are perfect). So even the eggs came out exact. Anyway, it was meant to be. Will fix this often.

I eliminated the carrots and mushrooms and substitued the catsup for tomatoe paste. This was a great dish!

I made this with 1/3 turkey, 1/3 pork, 1/3 extra-lean beef (I was cleaning out the freezer) and it was great. I skipped the mushrooms as I didn't have any, substituted egg beaters for the eggs, and I didn't have enough ketchup for the topping. Even with the changes it was very moist and had a great texture. I always form a loaf and bake on a jellyroll pan as the recipe says for two reasons: first, I think more fat drains off and second, you can make any size loaf you want. Will definitely make again, and will top off with a spicy tomato topping next time.

This is incredibly moist meatloaf with tons of flavor - no one will guess it's turkey. I served this with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach; a fabulous comfort food meal!

I really liked this recipe - I prefer a little more texture than how it came out, so maybe next time I'll hand chop the mushrooms so they aren't so fine and maybe that'll add texture. I also use a red pepper relish (which I make, but you can buy it easy enough) instead of the ketchup. Enjoy!

This was a very satisfying dish for how low fat it is. I used egg beaters instead of the eggs and left out the milk because we keep kosher. I used matzo meal instead of bread crumbs since I couldn't include the milk. I'm sure it would be even better with the milk & bread crumbs. For those who question baking the meatloaf without a loaf pan, I ALWAYS make meatloaf this way. It is much better!

Simple comfort food! No mushrooms; though, certain it would add complexity to this dish. Per a friend's suggestion, I soaked a cup of oats in milk in lieu of the bread crumbs. Much more healthy for us and very moist (sounds crazy to some but trust me)! My little 13 month old loves it too!! Thanks.

Didn't think much of this recipe. My boyfriend loved it but I thought it was kind of boring.

Might change ingredients somewhat in the future.

Finally, a reliable meatloaf recipe! This was very easy -- and I made it more so by using canned mushrooms (which I never usually use, but after reading the reviews decided to try, and they worked perfectly), and store-bought Progresso breadcrumbs. It was easy. Also, have never made meatloaf by forming into a loaf instead of cooking in a loaf pan, but it turned out great! Will definitely make again. You could use any combination of meats. Next time I might put more sauce on top to give it extra flavor. Enjoy!

This was a great alternative to regular ground beef meatloaf. I often have a hard time coming up with new things to make with ground turkey (besides turkey burgers and white bean chili) and this meatloaf was a big success. Chopping and sauteeing all of the vegetables was a bit of a task, however.

My family has not been hot on ground turkey, but this recipe was a hit! It was really easy to make! It browned nicely and the color was appetizing. I did take advice from a review to use teriyaki sauce(I was out of Worchestershire)and I added some fresh sage and thyme with the parsley. I also added 1/4 cup +/- of hearty Red Zinfandel to the simmering veggies. I would omit the extra salt if you use teriyaki. I used 2 eggs instead of the egg white and did not add milk because it seemed too soft already. I added a tbsp. of mayo to ensure it would be moist.(Sorry, low fat fans!)I suggest simply grating the carrot. I also made it just fine without any mushrooms for the kids. Also, use a butter knife to shape it, because it is mushy before baking. Finally, a decent ground turkey dish!

I made this a month or two ago and forgot to review it, but I remember well how delicious it was! My husband doesn't eat red meat so we were really in need of a good recipe for turkey meatloaf. This was it. I couldn't find crimini mushrooms so substituted button mushrooms with a few oyster mushrooms thrown in for flavor. Other than that, followed the recipe pretty much as written. It came out great, super moist and delicious, maybe a tiny bit too soft. I might use a little less milk next time and hope it comes out a little firmer.

First time I made this turkey loaf, my family felt it was very bland, had way to many mushrooms and intensely disliked the carrots. So when I made it again recently decided to change the ingredients a bit. Instead of cremini used a small box of fresh white button mushrooms which I coarsely chopped, added one large diced jalapeno to the onion/garlic/mushroom mix and cooked everything in a really large skillet so the onions were caramelized when the veggies were done, substituted teriyaki sauce for the worchestire sauce (adds more depth), dried sage and thyme for the parsley, dried breadcrumbs for the fresh and two beaten eggs for the egg/eggwhite combo. Also brushed the top of meatloaf with a mixture of ketchup and teriyaki sauce before cooking. What a difference!! It was so good that it has now become a family favorite...........

I chopped the onions by hand, but the carrots and shrooms were grated in the processor. I also added some kale (which I chopped using the blade of the processor) to add even more veggies. The pan I cooked the veggies in was piled so high, my husband took a look and said, "I thought you were making meatloaf!" I used 1 lb turkey with 7% fat, and 1 lb ground chuck. I thought it was very good, but I don't go into raptures over meatloaf. My husband, however, despite the veggies, ate twice as much as usual, and said that I should never make meatloaf any other way!!!

Since I'm not afraid of egg yolks... I used two whole eggs in this. It was amazing! Even better cold. I chopped all the veggies in the food processor... it saved lots of time. I made up the loaf on a Sunday and cooked it on Monday. Moist and wonderful

Rating: 3
Delicious. I used the food processor for the onions, carrots, mushrooms, parsley and bread crumbs, which made it very easy. When assembling in the pan I was worried because it was so wet, but it came out with a nice texture -- firm enough, and very tasty.

This was the second time I made this, and it was delicious. I had about 2.5 lbs of turkey, so I increased all the other ingredients, but didn't pay much attention to exact proportions. Also used 3 whole eggs instead of 2 whole and 2 whites. Tossed in some dried sage and thyme, which added a nice flavor. Next time, I'll add some tabasco or other similar hot stuff. Didn't make the red pepper sauce cuz I didn't have the ingredients. It was lovely and moist without, didn't even need ketchup. It's a keeper! I do have to admit, tho, that beef meatloaf sandwiches are WAY better than turkey.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be fair. Waiting for the meat thermometer to register 170 was a mistake because it was over-cooked and dry. The next time I make it, I will take it out earlier and add something to give it a little kick (ancho chile powder or chipotle chile powder)

I really enjoy this turkey meatloaf recipe. I usually make it with ground chicken instead, since that's what we usually have in the house. It's moist and warms up nicely for a second night of leftovers.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, I used half pound mushrooms to one and a half pounds of turkey breast only. Also, I placed the loaf into a loaf pan so that it would keep its shape. The recipe required at least an hour of prep but it was well worth it.

Rating: 4
This has become a favorite at our house. I shorten the prep time a bit by chopping all of the veggies and making the bread crumbs in the food processor. To reduce the sodium, I omit the salt and use unsalted tomato sauce instead of the ketchup.

Rating: 3
I used no mushrooms since I am not a fan. I mixed in 1 link fresh hot Italian turkey sausage and used 1.5# turkey. This was really delicious! My husband thought it was awesome!

Rating: 2
This dish was good, not great. The carrots pick up a weird flavor, so I would grate them next time. We love mushrooms, but found the loaf has too much mushroom flavor, I would decrease the amount used by half. I would increase the amount of garlic and onion. I made the Roasted Red Pepper sauce to accompany this. The sauce is great, however I felt not a good partner to meatloaf! The ketchup on top is all you need, the loaf is very moist, no sauce is needed.

Rating: 3
Very good for a turkey meatloaf. If you use the food processor, it goes together in a few minutes.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor. I substituted ground beef for the turkey and used 2 pounds instead of 1 1/4 pounds as it was just too moist. The flavor was outstanding. The prep time is way way off. It takes more like an hour or more instead of the 1/2 hour prep stated.

Love the loaf. My guests loved the loaf. I've made it twice now, and it just totally rocks. My first experiance with any sort of loaf based meal, and although it did take a while, it's so worth it. Yum!

Loved this dish. Pressed for time so threw all the veggies in the food processor, and then right into meatloaf without cooking first. Also used prepared breadcrumbs, regular white mushrooms. MOIST and delicous! Great leftovers.

Rating: 3
THE DISH WAS A HIT. EVEYONE LOVED IT.I OMITTED THE CARROTS AND USED SOY SAUCE IN STEAD OF "W" SAUCE AND TOPPED IT WITH ROASTED PEPPER /ONION TOMATO SAUCE INSTEAD OF KETCHUP. I FOUND IT TO BE TOO MOIST DURING THE PREPARATION STAGE AND I ADDED 2 MORE SLICES OF BREAD. ALL IN ALL IT WAS WELL LIKED!!

Rating: 3
Good stuff, and the "suggested" Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Sauce is a must; however, the meatloaf taken by itself was a little bit bland for my taste. Some ideas I plan on trying next time: adding more garlic, maybe some spicy peppers (chipotle, jalepeno, etc.), and substituting cilantro for the parsley.

Rating: 2
I was a little disappointed. I have made turkey meatloaf before, and my family loved it. This time, they said it didn't taste like much. I agree. It was very moist and had a good texture, but it was bland. This time I only had turkey breast meat instead of turkey dark meat or a mixture of both. That likely made some difference. However, I spent a lot of money on mushrooms and like another reviewer said, you couldn't even tast them. This is a good recipe, but not a great one. It needs to be jazzed up a lot. By the way, forget the red pepper sauce... no one liked it, even though the taste of the red pepper came through really well. Serve catsup instead.

Rating: 3
This was a hit with the whole family. I don't usually like meatloaf, but this was juicy and surprisingly flavorful. Yum!

Rating: 4
It's not a gourmet dish, but it's perfect for what it is: healthy comfort food. I've made it a few times so far and haven't really felt the need to make any changes. It's so moist and tender and the tiniest bit sweet (probably the ketchup and carrots). I've never made the red pepper sauce (too lazy), but it's great just on its own.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I cobbled together other readers' recommendations and substituted red & green peppers instead of carrots, used half ground turkey (lean) and half ground beef, and incorporated a mix of pasta sauce & ketchup. Don't be startled by the amount of mushrooms in the recipe - you can't detect their flavor (my husband doesn't like them) and they impart a great moistness. I used cremini as the recipe calls for. Also, instead of making the roasted red pepper ketchup, I purchased "ajvar" which is (I think) a Greek dip made from roasted red peppers, eggplant, spices. I've seen in both the ethnic & condiment section of different stores. It is so tasty! It also makes a great dip for tortilla chips.

Rating: 3
Made this for a friend who just had a baby and they loved it - saved the other half for my family and we loved it, too! I didn't use cremini mushrooms - used baby portabella instead...they add a wonderful flavor, and the meatloaf is very moist.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I've made it several times now and my husband has even made it once. Last time, I forgot to precook the vegetables and I just threw everything together in a bowl and mashed it together. It turned out a litlle overly moist, but I still enjoyed it. The thing that I like the most about this recipe is the huge amount of veggies in this meatloaf! It must be like half and half! The mushrooms come off like part of the meat in the final dish so you feel like you're getting a big portion of meat when really it's half vegetables. We've also prepared this recipe with ground chicken and it works equally well. Oh also, I shred the onion and the carrot as my family prefers no vegetable "chunks".

Rating: 3
Delicious! Be skeptical of the negative remarks about this one...Follow the recipe and don't think of leaving out the parsley..Husband and I loved it. Also, we used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground beef.

I'm not all that crazy about meatloaf. I wanted to try this recipe because it looked great in the picture and it seemed pretty easy to make. I also thought my niece and nephews might like it. They did, but I wasn't all that thrilled with it. I'll make it again for the kids. What I did like about it was how moist it turned out, even when reheated.

After the great buildup everyone gave this recipe, I must admit I had high expectations, which were somewhat thwarted when I actually made the recipe. It was good, but not my best recipe, and a lot more work than the payoff. I do like using the ground turkey, and it was indeed moist. I liked absorbing the milk in the breadcrumbs. In the future, I will likely incorporate several of the ingredients into a different recipe that is less labor intensive.

I didn't have fresh bread crumbs so I used the Italian progresso brand, and it came out delicious.

Fabulous - moist and delicious. I used regular button mushrooms, had them on hand, and Egg beaters (1/3 C). Otherwise followed recipe precisely. This will replace all other meatloaf recipes in this house! My husband who refuses to eat meatloaf LOVED this.

Rating: 4
Easy to prepare. Can add or change the veggies depending on what is on hand at home, for example add bell pepers or celery or more carrots. I never add the milk, but use matzo meal instead of bread crumbs. Can use any steak sauce for Worchester sauce. This recipe tastes great for several days.

I forgot to say that since I rarely have white bread in the house, I always use French bread. I've made it several times with Egg Beaters (egg sustitite) and you can't taste the difference.

Yummy! I skipped the carrot and added a small green bell pepper, diced. I also didn't have any breadcrumbs (or want to make any!), so used Stove Top instead. Have made it with and without bell pepper, but the bell pepper added so much flavor to the meatloaf. I've also used baby portabella mushrooms instead of cremini, which my grocer does not have. This is a terrific alternative to your standard beef meatloaf, plus its much healthier!

This is now my standard meatloaf. It's moister, more flavorful, and healthier than an all-meat loaf. I throw all the vegetables in the food processor and glaze it with a mixture of ketchup and Worcestershire. (I never make the sauce, though.) When I'm out of fresh parsley I substitute about 1 tbsp. dried, but the fresh parsley makes a big difference.

This meatloaf was great! I used spaghetti sauce instead of the ketchup. I cooked it for about 40 minutes to reach the temperature indicated. I've tried other turkey meatloaf recipes and this was the very best.

Made this for the first time- it was just ok. Tasted much better the second day as turkey meatloaf sandwiches. I would not make it again-not special, wouldn't even rate it as good. My husband who eats just about anything, said it was not disgusting,but not pleasurable either. Enough said.

Rating: 3
I'm pretty skeptical of meatloaf, but this was great! I added spicy chicken sausage to the mix and omitted the mushrooms. The sauce was tasty and not such a big deal to make. I used canned plum tomatoes and just cooked it all in the same oven with the meatloaf. Would definitely recommend!

I dont usually give 4 stars but this dish was incredible! I did top the meatloaf with bacon which added the nice smokiness but otherwise stuck to the recipe. The sauce was pretty sweet but really really good. Everyone raved and it was just as good for meatloaf sandwiches the rest of the week

i used a small handful of dry parsley instead of fresh, and i omitted the mushrooms for the mushroom-hater and the meatloaf came out fine. i wasn't crazy about the carrots, or the mild sweetness overall of the dish. i, too, thought it would be more savory. not a bad way to use ground turkey though.

Can I just say, yuuuuummmmy! :) My husband absolutely loved this recipe, as did I. I didn't have a couple of items that it callef for on hand so I just made do with what I did. For example: didn't have white bread, used wheat; and I didn't have the recommended mushrooms, but used portabellas. Even with the changes, scrum-dilly-umptious! ~ Chef in San Berdo, CA

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever had. My husband says it reminds him of the one his grandmother used to make, with sausage!! (Go figure...) It is time consuming, but the mushrooms really add the flavor and texture. I haven't tried the sauce. I bet that puts it over the top. Served with mashed potatoes, how can you go wrong!!!

Rating: 2
This was definitely labor-intensive and also took me about an hour to prepare, with a food processor, although making breadcrumbs out of some stale homemade bread I had accounted for some of the extra time. As I was making it, I was thinking, "this really better be great for this amount of work," and while it was good, it wasn't terrific. For some reason, it had kind of a sweet undertone - maybe the carrot? and definitely would have benefited from the addition of some thyme, or something to add a more savory note. I made a turkey meatloaf a couple months ago that was really outstanding; wish I could remember what website I found the recipe on.

Rating: 4
My partner and I made this on a whim as a change-of-pace Thanksgiving meal. Turned out to be the best meatloaf I've ever had; the cremini mushrooms are the key. Red pepper sauce works perfectly with the loaf. Takes some extra work, but well worth it.

This is a delicious dish, and a real favorite in our house. Great when just out of the oven, and equally great the next day (cold turkey meatloaf sandwiches). I make it once a month throughout the winter.

This was much better than my usually dry and boring turkey meatloaf. I even made it with low carb bread and ketchup and it turned out fantastic. I did however add fresh thyme. Serve with mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes and you'll never miss the carbs.

Great recipe, but I accidently used 2 1/2lbs. ground reg. turkey, and it turned out great. I've made this 5-6 times now, using more ground meat, and my clients love it. For the topping, I use a jarred chili sauce,,homemade type in round jar. It's great. Yes, labor intensive, but the more you make it, the easier it becomes.

Rating: 2
While this meatloaf was tasty, it was definitely a lot of work. Half an hour was not an accurate estimate of the prep time for this dish - more like an hour (even with using a food processor). For this amount of work, I have a much tastier meatloaf recipe - not sure if I'm allowed to mention who's recipe it is here...

Rating: 3
Update: made this again since first review -- first time around I didn't like the heavy worstershire flavor (though my husband did) so I cut that to 3/4 tsp, and added some fresh thyme, a few fresh sage leaves, and a small sprig of rosemary, minced. Everything else the same... yum!!! And I don't even *like* meatloaf! This went from a 2 to a 3 with the above changes (for me at least).

I agree this is a little labor intensive - not something to whip up after a late night at work - but definitely worth the effort! I doubled everything and split it between two pans - they came out wonderful. Everyone I served it to over the weekend has been raving about - and we had a pan for lunches/leftovers for the week. My husband says it reheats in the microwave unbelievably moist. It's become an instant hit!

I made this without milk or bread with the sauce from the three cheese lasagna. I can't have the lasagna anymore, being on a lo-carb diet, but we found the combination of the turkey and the sauce excellent. This is the 2nd time this week my husband has had me make this. It's a little bit of work, but overall worth it, in our opinion.

I used 100% breast meat for the turkey, 100% wheat bread to make the crumbs, and it was still moist, flavorful and totally delicious. Also used homemade tomato sauce instead of ketchup (which has a lot of High Fructose Corn Syrup) to make it even healthier. This is the best turkey meatloaf I have had, and this includes anything prepared at the famous NYC "comfort food" restaurants like HOME and PEASANT. Will definitely be making this a lot more, especially once fall arrives.

This is a great recipe, but I do understand some of the criticisms ... I doubled the Worchestershire sauce to counteract the slight blandness. I also topped it with the Balsamic Tomatoes that are part of the recent Pasta Primavera recipe on this site, which worked really well and added lots of tang. Definitely worth a try.

WOW! this was soooo good. my first meatloaf-making experience and it came out wonderfully. after reading a few of the negative comments (divorce papers!) i was a little hesitant, but wow. adjustments made: i cooked 2 pieces of bacon crispy, chopped up and added to final mixture, as well as half a chopped jalapeno w/seeds. also added a pinch of cajun seasonings to the veggie mix while cooking. also cooked veggies in bacon grease instead of olive oil...so much for lo-fat! ahh what we sacrifice for taste! :) - a definite winner.

I have to say that I browse this site a lot. This recipe has soooo many reviews that I had to make it. I did make a few adjustments. I added hot turkey sauage as well as a little creole season. Cut back on the bread and added only one egg. I only had baby bella mushrooms so I used them instead.I also roasted a red pepper and added that was well. This was a very good meatloaf.(and my Mom made the worlds worst meatloaf) Not dry nor bland nor to me seemed hard to put together.A no brainer. Serve it with some nice bread, salad, and a good shiraz...very good indeed.

It was the most flavorful and delicious meatloaf I have ever made. Dicing the carrot took a long time, though.

I've made this several times and it is always well received. It is time consuming, however. I've used both ground turkey and ground buffalo meat which claimed to be low fat also. Used cilantro this last time as that was what I had on hand. I've made the turkey meatloaf with sun dried tomatoes also on this site. This one is now requested more than the sun dried tomato recipe.

Very tasty with a rich flavor despite its being a lowfat, high-protein dish. I added a bit more garlic, Worcestershire sauce and basted with a bit of extra ketchup to add tang to the loaf but otherwise the recipe is well-written. It is prep-intensive (20-35 min) but there were plenty of leftovers for sandwiches.

Sorry, I'm not actually writing a review, but I wanted to give the cook from Wenatchee a tip regarding fresh parsley going bad. I used to keep it in a glass of water, but all that did was rot the stems. Then, a friend told me a little trick that works like a dream. Keep it in the plastic produce bag that you get at the supermarket. Scrunch up the top and blow a bunch of air into it and seal it with a twist tie. The carbon dioxide is exactly what the plant needs to keep it fresh. I've had a bunch in my fridge for 3 weeks and when I used it last night, it was still crisp and green!

I thought this meatloaf was REALLY good, as did my family. It is time consuming, though, so if you are going to the trouble to make it, double the recipe and freeze one. The changes I made were: Buttermilk for the milk, 1/2 oz dried porcini mushrooms, reconstituted then finely chopped for the criminis, wheatberry bread for the white bread and dried parsley for the fresh (I never use it as it seems to go bad on me), also homemade BBQ sauce for the ketchup. I did have to cook it longer than 55 minutes, though. I think it was closer to 65-70. It was really, really tasty and I will definitely make it again. I love that it is as good as regular meatloaf (to me, anyway!), and way lower in fat. Thanks, Gourmet!

I made this dish due to the overwhelming responses to it and was very pleased. My family really loved it and they all took the leftovers (I made a double recipe) for lunches to school and work today! I would definately make it again but next time I might add a little more sauce or ketchup inside to give it a little more kick.

Rating: 2
I thought this meatloaf was way too labour intensive. Meatloaf should be easy! After all the work (and not making any substitutions) my meatloaf turned out sorta soft and mushy and I had to cook it almost 20 minutes longer than called for. Taste was good, but after all the work I could have cared less.

After all the comments, thought I would make it myself to see. If you like meatloaf (like my husband), you will probably love this one. If you are at all iffy on meatloaf (like me), you probably won't care a lot for it. Loved the addition of the mushrooms though. I likely won't make it again, but that's only because I do all the cooking and didn't think it was all it was all that.

Rating: 3
Good grief -- I don't care what side you fall on, but stop trying to politicize meatloaf. I thought this was particularly tasty and satisfying, especially as leftovers. If you go all-organic on the ingredients though, the mushrooms make it a little more pricey. It's not the *best* meatloaf recipe ever, but certainly an enjoyable variation. I don't make meatloaf often but I'll keep the recipe on hand for down the road.

This is a great low fat alternative to meatloaf. I prefer the Martha Stewart recipe in her 'comfort foods' cookbook, but if you're trying to cut fat, this is great. I didn't think the mushroom flavor was overpowering. I don't think anyone would know this wasn't beef if you didn't tell them. However, I did have to use about 2 tablespoons oil to saute the veggies...why do authors always underestimate the oil? Anyway, I made it exactly as written otherwise and my family loved it...even the 1 year old! I really think you could throw the veggies in without sauteeing them, I may try that next time.

This is a fabulous meatloaf...incredibly moist with delicous mushroom flavor. Use cremini shrooms for great flavor. I used tomato paste instead of ketchup since ketchup is loaded with sugar. Was delcious. It takes time..but well worth it.

For a turkey meatloaf, this recipe is more work than any other meatloaf I've ever made but indeed "beyond compare." Moist, tasty and even better the day after. I prepared it in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day before baking. I also liked the sauce but would remove the tomato seeds beforehand.

Excellent dish. My friends raved. Doesn't even tast like turkey. I only had white mushrooms. Next time I will get the cremini. Will then rate this dish with 4 forks.

Great recipe. To simplify my life, I processed all veggies in the food processor and then cooked until the water was mostly evaporated. Fresh parsley is a must. The ketchup on top was the best part. This is a great way to get your kids to eat their vegetables. Season well since this is ground turkey.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed making this recipe, although it was somewhat labour intensive. Thank goodness for food processors. I used extra lean ground turkey and it turned out very nicely. Perhaps I didn't use enough of it because it was very, very moist. But then I think the moistness was good because turkey can tend to be dry. I did find, however, the roasted red peppeer and tomatoe sauce to be very disappointing. It was kind of bland and the turkey meat loaf tasted fine without it.

This turned out very good -- tasty and moist. Following it as the recipe reads, it is perfect for turkey.

I thought the meatloaf was very good, not great. I did like that it had all those vegetables. A lot of effort, even with my Cuisinart. My 18-month old liked it, my 4 year-old didn't - they are the primary reasons I make meatloaf - so I'll stick to mom's recipe, which we all really enjoy, and it takes half the prep time! P.S. Grind the carrots as finely as possible.

Very, very good. Definitely the moistest meatloaf I've ever had. Nice flavor.

tried it. I liked the red pepper sauce, but I just dislike the taste of ground turkey. I prefer the meatloaf mix of beef, pork and veal. The mushrooms kept the meatloaf moist, but my husband and son covered it in catsup.I would not make again. I was disappointed because of all the rave reveiws.

New Haven, you're not much of a "wordie." The cook from Beverly Hills was referring to the fact that the recipe came from Gourmet magazine, January 2003 when she wrote, "Like most Gourmet recipes, the preparation was quite involved. . ."

I made this with a mixture of ground beef and pork rather than turkey, which of course made it less healthy, but it was delicious! I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, and it was a big hit with my boyfriend. Like most Gourmet recipes, the preparation was quite involved, but the result was more complex-tasting than its traditional counterpart. I will definitely make it again!

I haven't made this recipe yet, it looks pretty good though. This is a comment on the use of the word "chili" and "chilies". I am a chef born and raised in the Southwest. It is CHILE or CHILES. Chili is the tex-mex dish made with chili powder and beef, sometimes beans (although not if you are a chili purest). I don't mean to get off on a rant here, but if you are going to write recipes for Mexican and Southwestern dishes at least have the common courtesy to spell the ingredients correctly. I know that this is sometimes accepted, but that is by people who frankly do not know any better. We would never write fwa graw, or bree, so lets not bastardize the Mexican and Southwestern cuisine ingredients. Thanks, Chef P

I was never one for meatloaf, and since I don't eat red meat, I never thought I'd see meatloaf in my kitchen. Then came this recipe--fantastic! This meatloaf is moist, flavorful, delicious, and even better the next day. I can't wait to make this again! I would not, however, bother with the roasted red pepper tomato sauce--the meatloaf was delish without it. To those who thought it was mushy, try cooking the mushrooms without covering them--you've got to let the liquid evaporate.

Rating: 2
I thought this was a lot of work and time for meatloaf. It was blah. Perhaps it needed the roasted pepper sauce - I just used ketchup -it needed something. It was much better the second day for meatloaf sandwiches. But next time I'll use my mom's 10-min recipe with ground beef.

I can take or leave meatloaf.My family likes it, so I make it now and then.But I really loved this.I feared it would be bland and/or dry.It was neither.Incidentally,I used only 10 oz.of white mushrooms,as creminis were unavailable, and the whites came in 10 oz.cartons;whole wheat bread and skim milk,as that's what I had.My husband rarely takes seconds,but did with this.I promised everyone we'd have it again soon.

This was such a surprisingly delicious, flavorful dish, and my husband absolutely loved it. Plus, it's so much healthier than the conventional meatloaf because you're using turkey and all those vegetables.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. The diced mushrooms give up their water while the loaf is cooking making the dish oh so moist. I was very po'd I had to leave the leftovers at my mom's because I thought the sandwiches the next day would be superb. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork for the meat.

I love meatloaf and this is hands-down one of the best meatloaves I've ever had. Period. Very moist. The flavors were wonderful and full. I didn't make the roasted pepper tomato sauce and simply stuck with ketchup. Turned out just fine. Dinner also featured mashed potatoes w/ mushroom gravy, and sauteed sugar snap peas. I could eat this all week.

Rating: 2
I don't know why this seemed so time consuming, as I routinely saute the veggies for my meatloaf prior to mixing, and I used the processer for quick chopping of everything. Nonetheless, it seemed to take forever! I made it exactly as written, and it was pretty good, but not fantastic. My husband liked it, as did my son, and that in itself is enough to repeat the recipe! I'll try it cold for sandwiches to see if that improves it.

Rating: 4
This was very time consuming, but worth it, super moist and the flavor was very intense. I think next time I will skip roasting the peppers myself and just use the jar kind, save some time, but definitely don't skip the relish altogether, it really makes the dish!!!

Rating: 3
More time-consuming than the recipe indicates, but very good flavor and texture. Nice and moist, and it LOOKS like regular meatloaf (my previous turkey-based meatloaves were pretty pale). I used spicy ketchup -- and more of it --for the topping, which I think is a good idea. I might try adding some green pepper next time, too.

Rating: 4
Great recipe !! Used portabellos(had them aready)and didn't have the time time or tomatoes to make red pepper sauce, so, I pureed roasted peppers in a jar and put in a saucepan w/ ketchup,apricot preserves, balsamic vinegar, and a touch of honey, spread on meatloaf for 10 mins. and put back in the oven at a higher temp, turned out FANTASTIC !! My boyfriend agreed, and he is quite picky about his meatloaf !!

I thought this meatloaf was a tad bland but we love gah-lic. Will add more garlic and spices and try again. It is a moist meatloaf, though, and I haven't had much prior success with cooking ground turkey and not drying it out.

Great, healthy meatloaf... I used all white turkey, and it was wonderful. It was a little soggy at the bottom, but I might not have cooked the mushrooms long enough. Great for leftovers the next day. It did take longer to make than a half hour, but it was good enough that I didn't mind...

This meatloaf was very good. I subbed 1 c of cooked barley for the white bread crumbs. I also subbed portabella for the cremini mushrooms. I didn't try the sauce that comes with this meatloaf. Instead I put some wonderful peach salsa over the meatloaf. This recipe is time consuming but the result are worth it. Also you don't have to feel guilty eating this. I used 99% fat free turkey.

Not a recipe for when you're in a hurry (unlike other meatloaf recipes), especially if you make the tomato sauce, but ABSOLUTELY worth the effort. Brown mushrooms give this a wonderful color & added texture, unlike most turkey meatloaves I've had.

I'm a househusband and do all the cooking...I tried this and my wife thought it was the best meatloaf she ever had. She told me to throw away all other meatloaf recipies and feel free to make it again soon. Not finding cremini mushrooms, I substituted baby portobellos. The red pepper tomato sauce was perfect with the dish, and after sharing the recipe with my daughter, she also raved about the results and told me she's also going to make the sauce for lots of other dishes.

This meatloaf is delicious. It was my first meatloaf and it was very simple. Prep time is my only complaint but it's definately worth it. I made it in a 9x5 loaf pan and it came out great. Next time I will cook as directed so it will brown all around. It is so moist you'd never know it's turkey!!

I used regular button mushrooms and ground chicken breast only(white meat)instead of the part dark and white ground turkey. I also added 1/4 cup of white wine and it made the meatloaf juicy and delicious. I doubled the ingredients to make a second loaf-you might as well when prepping all the veggies.

For a low-fat meat loaf, this is pretty good, though a bit more work than one might anticipate. And, all by itself, the roasted red pepper and tomato sauce is also good. The loaf and sauce together... I'm not so sure. Next time I make this meatloaf, I think I'll make a mushroom sauce. Next time I make the sauce, I'll put it on fish, perhaps, or pasta.

I consider this the "gourmet" meatloaf. Husband loved it, even though he dislikes mushrooms. Chopped the mushrooms so fine that he didn't even know it was in there. Does take some prep time with all the chopping and sauteing. I increased the ingredients and made one big enough to fit into a large loaf pan. Made the sauce, which was fabulous over pasta. Good, tasty, healthy recipe. No guilt eating this meatloaf.

This was excellent! I hate mushrooms so I added a little bit more of the other vegetables. This was very moist, and so far I've had it for dinner as a leftover, and made meatloaf sandwiches (cold of course). It stayed moist for all versions. I didn't make the tomato red pepper sauce, because I had leftover Roasted Red Pepper Relish" from the "Goat Cheese Stuffed Turkey Burger" recipe (this site) which is fabulous. But I look forward to making this again, and trying the sauce too. Make this, you'll be happy you did!

I have made the meatloaf twice. The second time my grocer did not have ground turkey so I used ground round. Both times it was delicious! Instead of using the bread crumbs I use rolled oats. I really think it is a lot of work for meatloaf. It won't be a "staple" but will make it again. YUM!!

What a great comfort-food recipe! My husband absolutely hates meatloaf, and I think he was really dreading dinner last night. However,he ended up being pleasantly surprised and even went for seconds!

Once in a pinch I subbed for Worcestershire sauce with half soy sauce and half balsamic vinegar. I know, it sounds weird, but it sort of mimiced the tangy and the salty/depth flavors. Would probably work here, especially since you only need 1.5 tsp total.

I gave this one a try because my husband likes meatloaf but I can't stand it. I thought the turkey would satisfy his need to chew on some meat and my need not to eat a big hunk of dry beef. We were both very happy. The meatloaf was very moist--I didn't have to drown it in the red bell pepper sauce or katchup. The spouse liked it the first time and for lunch the next day.

Made this twice already with excellent results! Second time I used 1/2 plain wheat germ 1/2 bread crumbs and white mushrooms. Both times came out wonderful. I love the unique flavors from the mushrooms, carrots and onions. Wheatgerm gave it a tad bit looser texture but still tasted great. A bit time consuming but worth it! The red pepper sauce is a must have. Will definitely be making this one again !

I wanted to love this recipe. I did like it, but found it disappointing after all the rave reviews I had read. The carrot gave it a sweetness that didn't seem to blend well with the other flavors. We did like the mushrooms very much. My food processor stopped working in the middle of prepping the ingredients, which turned this into a lot of work. I probably will not make it again as written, but may take some parts of it (the mushrooms) and incorporate them into the turkey meatloaf I normally make. Could not make the sauce due to the food processor breakdown, but will definitely try it sometime.

This is the first time I have made a recipe with ground turkey and actually liked the result. I tolerate turkey burgers, tacos, loaves, etc. because they're healthful, but I never really enjoy them.

I have one thing to say about this turkey meatloaf and the accompanying sauce: MAKE TWO. It was so delicious I'm ready to make it again, even as time consuming as it is. I left out the mushrooms since the hubby hates them... tasted fine. Whenever I make this from now on I will double the recipe and freeze one. The sauce was incredible.

Very good. In the interest of ease, rather that sauteing this and that, I just mixed all of the ingredients (using buttom mushrooms instead of fancy ones) and baked the meatloaf as directed.

I agree with other cooks that the prep time was a lot longer than 30 mins. This dish tasted great, but I'm not sure it was worth all the effort for a meatloaf.

i was interested in the fiber discussion regarding this meatloaf, so i decided to look up the actually nutrient content using my food values book (i am a dietetic intern, so i have all of those handy books around...) the mushrooms actually do not contribute any fiber to this recipe, but the onions and carrot give about 2-3 grams of fiber (for the WHOLE recipe). so, yes, this recipe is very low in fiber, which is unfortunate because it would be quite easy to increase the fiber content. just thought i would add my 2-cents regarding fabulous fiber!

If you are at all receptive to the idea of eating meatloaf, this is the recipe for you. Even if you have not had a meatloaf in years, give this a try. It is moist, loaded with veggies, healthy and extremely tasty. As a meatloaf purest I had to serve it with ketchup, though I am sure it would look eloquently dressed with some decorative greens and the suggested red pepper sauce drizzled over it. Call it "le meatloaf", and watch your diners swoon.

This was the first meatloaf I ever made and it was delicious! My husband ate half of it. It took a little longer than the 30 minutes of active time, but I think I would do it all over again. I served it with the roasted red pepper sauce, which was a fantastic addition to the meal. I am definitely making this again...soon.

To make this recipe quicker, combine all of the ingredients together. You may lose a little flavor, but save a lot of time. Sauteing the onions, mushrooms, etc. and soaking breadcrumbs in milk etc. make this more time consuming. Traditionally, meatloaf is made by combining all of the ingredients and baking. You can also add green pepper. Creamed corn is good with it. Meatballs are fun and fast as well as mini-meatloaves are faster. Great leftovers.

This was a little time consuming to make...but well worth all the effort. This was really delicious (and I don't even like mushrooms). This will certainly fall into our regular meal rotation.

This recipe is flavorful, MOIST, tender, and rich! The minced mushrooms and onion give it a rich texture and flavor~ and my 10 year old son did not guess he was eating the dreaded mushroom!! It took me kind of a while to prepare, but it was totally worth it! I served it with a seperate beef gravy since i didn't have time for the roast pepper sauce. Big success! I cooked it longer than it said to (by accident) and it didn't even matter!

Having recently started Weight Watchers, this recipe fit right into the plan and has been the best meat loaf that I have ever made! I look forward to making it again.

Turkey meatloaf was a big hit. Moist, light and perfectly flavored and we don't think of ourselves as meatloaf people. We are converted. Will serve next time with mashed potatoes and broccoli. MMMMMM!

The best Turkey Meatloaf I ever had! Only problem is the time to prepare. Would love to find a few shorcuts and this will become a regular!

I'm always looking for dishes that can hold their own for a few nights of reheating, and meatloaf does have a tendency to turn into cardboard, so I hesitated to make this. But my expectations have been exceeded. This meatloaf was just as moist on the third night as it was on the first. And while the roasted pepper and tomato sauce is a nice addition, the flavor of the meatloaf is outstanding on its own. This meatloaf is also firm enough to slice thinly for sandwiches, which means that if you?re only feeding two people with moderate appetites, you can squeeze three dinners and a lunch out of this recipe.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made! It is moist, tasty and contains a lot of vegetables. I'd recommend it for family dinners and casual entertaining.
