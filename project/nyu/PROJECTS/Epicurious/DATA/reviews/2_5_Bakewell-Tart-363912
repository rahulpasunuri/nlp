Not nice, sorry. Visionism is correct. The filling should contain a high proportion of ground almonds, plus almond extract. It must be possible to find an authentic Irish dessert. [Thinks: a steamed sponge pudding, or something using oatmeal]. To be sure, this isn't one.

I concur with Visionism. This was good but not a Bakewell Tart! I lived in the UK for many years, have been to Bakewell in the Peak District-eaten authentic Bakewell tarts-and its not even close. It's good however....but not the real thing and definately not an Irish thing!!

I'm a certified pastry chef..I tried this recipe and it came out great. As far as the butter being a large amount..it's completely normal now-a-days. A shortbread is a short dough because of all the butter...that's what gives it that consistency as opposed to a pie crust or puff pastry. I think it would be gross with any other type of crust other than what the recipe calls for..and shortdoughs with custard/lemon/jams are VERY european as well as very common in areas like Ireland, Scotland and England..So I think it fit the menu pretty well. Ireland is not known for their "gourmet desserts" let alone their food. I'd give it 3.5 forks!

Bakewell tart is made with shortcrust pastry, almond frangipane and raspberry jam. Nor is it Irish. This is just a cake with puff pastry around it.

This was excellent. Also added some fresh blackberries with the jam. Amazing results. For the busy homemaker using packaged store bought puff pastry works well also.

I did not have good luck with this. I bought the pastry so can't comment on that part of the recipe. Used Huckleberry Rhubard Jam. The filling seemed strange. It did not set up in the 45 min called for the recipe but took over an hour and a half, overcooking the crust. Tart inedible. Will not try again. Will make flan instead.

I bought the pastry which was fine, but I was not crazy about the filling. I know that the British and Irish do not go in for sweet desserts, but this just tasted a bit odd to me and my guests. The raspberry jam helped, but it was not something I will make again. (And I love Chef Armstrong's restaurants. I'm fortunate to live in his town.)

excellent, I used frozen pastry, interesting how many people have something to say about the recipe and have not read it in its entirety, or took time to make it. I will make this again on St. Patricks day.

I'm sorry,who would make a recipe these days that calls for 5 1/2 sticks of butter? No, I did not make it.

Wake up and smell the yogurt. Anyone in the world who cooks borrows and/or steals recipes from everyone else and adapts them to their own tastes, requirements or ingredient availability. Just because this isn't the way Gram used to make it doesn't change the fact that it's bloody good.

How in the world anyone can claim that this is either anything other than thoroughly English, or halfway between a Bakewell tart or a Bakewell pudding, is beyond me. Necessary to read up on the history of the thing, if you ask me (and no one did). But why not make the real thing, if you are going to bother?

Did anyone read the introduction to the recipe? It said you could use frozen puff pastry. It also said that different chefs from different areas have come up with their own versions as did this chef, it never said this was the original recipe. So don't obsess over the almond vs. flour issue. Try the recipe before judging or just go on to something else and leave it alone

Not an Irish dish, Bakewell Tart and Bakewell Pudding hail from Bakewell, in Derbyshire, England (representing a certain irony here). The pudding is puff pastry and a custard style filling. The tart is made with short crust pastry, raspberry jam with a sponge top (traditionally made with flour and ground almonds) and is topped with a few almonds.

This tart was incredible. It's delicious as published but I'm glad I read the reviews and found out the filling can be made with almonds. As for puff pastry, yes, it can take the better part of a day but that's why most people make enough to freeze a six month supply. Even professionals use frozen puff because making it from scratch is labor intenstive. Just think of it like stock - you don't make enough for one batch of soup, you make enough to freeze 15 containers.

It looks like you'd have to live in the kitchen for an entire day to make this, that's why no one has done it. I like doing things from scratch, but puff pastry in the frozen section of the supermarket is the only way I would attempt this - too much work!

Why rate a recipe & write a review without making the tart? It just don't make no sense!!!

The previous reviewer was correct, the filling for Bakewell Tart is traditionally made with ground almonds instead of flour. However, don't miss the chance to eat at Restaurant Eve; it is an excellent restaurant!

I question the quantity of puff pastry. 4 cups of flour and a pound of butter for a single-crust, 8-inch tart?

Why make puff pastry and certainly not for this recipe. My mother made Bakewell tarts with ordinary pastry and taught me. They were cheap to make. With almonds it is a "maid of honor"

I have no preconceptions about what a Bakewell Tart "should" or "should not" have in it, so I'm giving this four stars to counterbalance the 1 given by the other reviewer who has obviously not tried this recipe yet, either.

I thought a Bakewell Tart should have ground almonds in it.
