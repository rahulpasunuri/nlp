I loved the dill taste. I used fresh dill flowers for the 1 1/2 T. We cooked them on a grill pan outdoors. I froze them for less than an hour after I mixed them. They did not fall apart even though I used lean ground beef.

Quite unremarkable! I was very disappointed after all the good reviews. I couldn't taste the meat at all, only mustard. I used sour cream and the burgers completely fell apart. Oh well, lose some once in a while :-).

I liked the dill flavor, but otherwise I think these burgers were quite unremarkable. They didn't fall apart - they were quite large and I only turned them once on the grill.

This was very delicious. I think next time I will try the yogurt instead, make a lowfat version. The meat fell apart even with the sour cream but nonetheless it was delicious!!!

I made these with ground turkey, added a little grated lemon peel to the sauce--maybe 1/2 teaspoon--and "stuffed the turkey burgers with mozzarella cheese. Yum. The sour cream kept the turkey burger moist and the lemon peel added a nice zing. We rarely eat ground beef, but, based on reviewer comments, I think I'll try this recipe next time we need a beef burger fix.

Very flavorful. I used low-fat yogurt in lieu of sour cream. As per other readers,the meat fell apart somewhat. But overall, it's a very delicious interpretation of a hamburger.

Made this with dried dill, added a little more than called for, it turned out delicious. Moist, juicy and it held together, did not break apart on the grill. We had left overs and WILL make it again! Thanks for a great recipe.

These are very tender juicy burgers. Real easy and quick. The recipe has become a staple in my kitchen although the first time I was a little skeptic about the dill (which I usually associate with fish, not meat).

I substituted dried dill weed for fresh, and creme fraiche for the sour cream. Also used 4T and a full pound of ground beef, making 3 burgers and reserving 2T for the buns, which proved to be more than adequate dressing. I'm not a huge burger person, but the ingredients put a fresh spin on the tired, old burger. I will definitely make these again.

These burgers were delicious!! The sauce made them very tender. Theres nothing worse than a dry burger, and mixing the sauce in really made these tender and tasty! Highly recommended!

I loved this - Used lean ground turkey instead of beef, and the burgers came out absolutely wonderful. I will definitely make these again.

As many other cooks noted, the burgers do tend to fall apart while cooking. There are ways to remedy that, however. Increase the amount of meat, or only put a tablespoon or so of sauce in this amount of meat. It's really the sauce that makes these burgers so great anyway. (Especially with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles,and onions. No other condiments needed!) I always double or triple the recipe anyway. Don't like to heat up the grill for only two burgers, and I even like them reheated. The sauce is also delicious served over grilled fish, particularly salmon. I like to add capers to it for that purpose.

I liked it. I was nervous about putting so much sour cream/mustard in the meat, so I used only about half. After eating it, I thought I could have put a bit more in, but my boyfriend thought it tasted too much of mustard. All in all, I thought it was a good change from regular hamburgers.

Oh, how can I ever find the words to describe this recipe? I guess nasty, foul and just plain wrong will have to suffice. We followed the recipe to the letter and ended up throwing the burgers out and inhaling the rest of the the meal in a desperate attempt to cleanse our palates of the horrible taste. As other reviewers have pointed out, they do not stay together, which made a bit of a mess. Absolutely terrible.

Excellant receipe but I took the advice of some of the previuos critics and increased the ground chuck to 16 Oz. I would also increase the amount of sauce by half and increase the reserve to 6T. The extra will be needed for the table.

I am usually am not a dill person, but my wife made me try it and wow! I would certainly do this one again. The patties do fall apart very easily, so we ended up pan frying them. Also we decreased the proportion of mustard/sour cream/dill sauce that was added to the meat. Rosemary roasted potatoes went very well with this burger.

This is a great way to make a "new" hamburger. I made this for my family the other night...it took no longer to prepare than regular hamburgers,and we all liked them...even my finicky son. We will make them again. We used other condiments as well, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, mayo and ketsup.

I made these burgers for my parents. My carnivorous dad saw me grilling them and came out with a slice of cheese- I told him that these burgers wouldn't need cheese and he became VERY skeptical. However, after dinner he looked at my mother and told her that from now on they should only have mustard-dill burgers. They are unbelievably tasty and go great with whole wheat buns.

This is very popular in my family. I do sometimes substitute sour cream for plain yogurt, and it's still very good.

These were delicious! Very easy - and so much more interesting than plain old burgers. I will definitely make again and again.

I didn't have dill, but I added fresh garlic to it, along with some seasoning salt and coarse pepper; I cooked the burgers with a little butter on top of each one. My boyfriend says that I have to make burgers like this every time, and wanted them again the next night, and he is picky!

Delicious!!! My partner was more than a bit skeptical over the sour cream in the sauce, but was ecstatic with the end result. We cooked them in the pan on the stove as it's way too cold to stand outside and grill right now (Winter here in OZ!)Such yummy moist burgers-can't wait for summer to try them out on the barbeque for the whole family. I served it with the Macaroni with Prosciutto-great meal!

This was an unmitigated disaster. When all the ingredients were mixed together, the patties were barely firmer than a very thick batter. It's not surprising that other reviewers complained that the burgers fell apart on the grill. Mine did, too. I ended up with burgers made of beef "crumbles," and the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. Very unsatisfying. I've been cooking from Bon Appetit for years with great success. Where on earth did you come up with this fiasco of a recipe?

What an upscale hamburger. I will never again just grill plain ground beef. Refreshing summery dill and tartness of mustard are a great combination. I also didn't have problems with the burgers falling apart. Being the newlyweds that we are and not having a real grill, our George Foreman grill worked wonders. No Flipping!

Used closer to a pound of ground beef and had no difficulty keeping the patties together. The whole family enjoyed, including our 15-yr. old! Moist and tasty.

As a rule I don't like grilled burgers. They are on the dry side and so bland, kethup sure doesn't help it much. On the other hand I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this recipe. The burgers are incredibly moist and flavorful! To the cook who said they fell apart, you probably didn't form them into firm, thick patties and place them on a greased grill. I never have any problems with this.

Man were we hot and tired! It was the evening of out 43rd annaversary, the day was hot and NOBODY wanted to cook. I turned to dear old Epicurious and came up with this gem. It was easy, fast and delicious! (Shame on us, we had the Strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert).

This is a keeper! I really loved these, they were a nice change of pace from the normal burger, and easy too! Took me only a few minutes to throw together. I stuck to the recipe, but I used more like 1 1/8 lbs. of meat. They held together pretty well. First cooked them on foil and then once they were almost solid, moved them off the foil to finish them off. Didn't have hamburger buns, so we used toasted English muffins which worked out great!

The flavor of the burgers were very good, although they would not stay together. I just put them on top of aluminum foil on the grill to keep them together.

Oh my gosh....this was a disaster!!The ground beef became way too soft and unmanageable, despite the fact that I followed the recipe exactly and did not overmix. Sounded delicious, but the burgers fell apart as soon as they were placed on the grill.

AH! Something great over Hickory or other flavored wood chips. I also tried this recipe with ground lamb and cooked them just to the medium stage, added a few pieces of fetta cheese at the table and soooo good.

An excellent burger for the grown-up taste...don't think the kids liked it as much, but we added quite a bit more mustard and LOTS of dill. WILL make again.

A succulent patty with a unique and yet mouth watering sauce! The dill released a fabulous aroma while the mustard added a subtle kick. I put this recipe in a safe and secret place! Love it!

Great taste and flavor, a nice change from just the "burger". Our grill isn't out yet, so I made them in the frying pan-still good, but doesn't compare to being grilled. My patties broke apart too while flipping (?).
