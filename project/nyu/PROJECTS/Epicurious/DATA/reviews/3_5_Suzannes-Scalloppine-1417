This is too much like my boring old stanby when I can't think of anything else to make -- so I resort to chicken parmesan. How long does the chicken stay in the oven? The recipe doesn't specify.

Delicious. Quick. Easy. What more could you want? It goes well with pasta.

We have been making this recipe for years. We first found it in the magazine we bought when it first came out in 1990. This is a delicious easy recipe. Even my husband who likes to cook has made it and it is always a hit whether for a quick weekday dinner or for company on the weekend.

This has become one of my household favorites. I add some mozzarella on top and bake it. It's wonderful. Pounding the chicken breasts makes them very tender and tasty.
