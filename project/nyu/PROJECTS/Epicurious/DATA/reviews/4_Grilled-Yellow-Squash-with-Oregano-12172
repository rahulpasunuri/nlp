I made this tonight to accompany crabcakes and a late summer tomato salad. I used olive oil spray on the squash as opposed to brushing with oil - a bit lighter. I did not use dried oregano, but chopped some fresh oregano with the parsley to sprinkle on top. I also added a minced garlic clove to the dressing. Awesome!!!

Grilled this outside. Otherwise no changes. 2nd time was grilled in pan still great. Oregano adds an interesting change to the squash. Good stuff.

First of all--I don't even like squash and seldom eat it unless it's uncooked in a salad. This recipe however was delicious and we all felt that way. I made it last night and we're having it again tonight only this time I'm making enough for me too.
