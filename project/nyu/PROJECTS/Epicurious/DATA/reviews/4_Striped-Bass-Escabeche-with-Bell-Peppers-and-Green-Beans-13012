Great summer dinner party dish: you can do all the work the night before and keep the oven off! I used a cast iron skillet to brown the fish before putting in the marinade. I used black olives, added grapefruit juice, red and yellow bell peppers. I used a mandolin to slice the red onion and peppers. Also used white cannellini beans instead of green beans. It was a huge hit! Served with corn on the cob and flan (also made the night before).

I used the marinade for leftover grilled smoked scrod. I heated it and mixed in the peppers and onion and let them simmer for a few minutes before pouring the mixture over the fish & adding olives. It marinated for 3 hours in the refrigerator and was at room temperature when served. Even the non-fish eaters loved it.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I made if for our Rosh Ha Shana celebration. I marinated for only a day, and it was perfect. My guests gobbled it up. It sounds far more complicated than it is.
