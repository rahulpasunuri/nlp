Super yummy. Made it for my book club and everyone raved. Time consuming but relatively easy recipe. Well worth the effort.

I meant to say eaten, not "eated"--oops- in my previous review. The other comment I got was that it tastes like buckeye candies for anyone who is familiar.

This was easy to prepare and tasted like a frozen chocolate p.b cup. Recipe was easy to follow. Wouldn't make any changes.

This has a nice look on the plate. It takes some time to make, but is not overly difficult, and can be made ahead. My husband is the peanut butter lover, so this was really for him. In my mind, it tastes good, with a nice silky texture, but is so rich it almost makes me feel sick. Just remember to eat in very small portions. I have eated leftovers diced as an ice cream topping, and find it more enjoyable that way.
