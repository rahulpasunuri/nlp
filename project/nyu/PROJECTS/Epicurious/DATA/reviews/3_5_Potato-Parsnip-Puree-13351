Tasted great! I'm a big fan of roasted parsnips, and although the parsnip flavor was only subtle in this recipe, it was worth making for some variety. I did not have ricer, so I used a hand mixer, and it seemed to work just fine. I added a little bit of salt along with the white pepper.

Shh...don't tell anyone else that parsnips are one of the great comfort foods. That means more for me and you. Pureed parsnips--with potatoes or sometimes carrots--are a staple in my household. I use 2x the amount of parsnips vs. potatoes (better flavor that way) and a ricer for a great consistency. Roasted parsnips are a real treat, too. Bon Appetit!
