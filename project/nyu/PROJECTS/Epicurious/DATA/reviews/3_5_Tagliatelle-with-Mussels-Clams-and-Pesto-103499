I thought this was very good. We didn't have mussels so I added 4 shimp and a could of king crab legs, shelled and add the meat to finished dish. I also don't use all the reserved clam juice but do use just enough to make the ingredients mix well. Very easy and nice dish.

I didn't love this...I agree with the reviewer that thought the pesto was a little overwhelming. The recipe is missing something, but I'm not sure what it is. The kids hated it! I'm waiting to see what it tastes like the next day...maybe by then I'll figure out what it's missing.

This is wonderfully simple for a week-night. I like an all-mussell version. Last night we forgot the tomatoes and didn't really miss them...

This is my most favorite seafod dish. It's the easiest thing to make and looks beautiful. I warm up some high-quality, plain marinara sauce and add a tiny bit on top of the dish for color and a little flavor.

This is a delicious dish that's amazingly simple to make. I've made it two times - once with both mussels and clams, once with just clams - and it's been a huge hit both times. Try this recipe!

Excellent. Made it for the first time for guests. They were wowed. I added sea scallops (sauted them in olive oil and S&P, and added white wine to the pan), and upped the amount of pepper flakes. A bonus -- its not too rich -- no cream like so many shellfish and pasta recipes.

This is a fabulous recipe. I used home-made pesto using the Pesto recipe on this site - Gourmet Sept. 2002. I will make it again and again. Husband has been spoiled by his immigrant parents - Dad (Exec. French Chef) and Mom (French country cooking)and he is my toughest critic. He was blown away by this dish.

This is really delicious AND easy. I took others' advice and used only 5 tbs. of the pesto instead of six. My husband said it's the best pasta I've ever made. Took about 12-15 minutes total...can't beat that!

loved it! added calamari (wow!) and took out the tomatoes due to an allergy, it made a wonderful "romantic dinner for 2" main course.

This is a very good and easy clam linguine to make on a hot summer day that goes well with white wine. I would increase the number of clams. I have made this several times.

Nice, with reservations. I made this with 30 littlenecks (mussels n/a), and sorry to say that that wasn't enough. Also very pesto-ey: overwhelmingly so. I'd ratchet up the shellfish component, and also the tomatoes. But still nice, and nice for lunch the next day.
