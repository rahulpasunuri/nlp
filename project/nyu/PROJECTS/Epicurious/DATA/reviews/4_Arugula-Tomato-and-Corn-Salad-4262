I loved the recipe! When putting it all together, I was worried that the taste would be too powerful, but it wasn't at all. It was very well balanced with taste and texture. I added a dash of salt, half an avocado and a drizzle of lemon juice. It is delicious! All I'd recommend is to read through the recipe first - you may want to change the order (i.e. get the corn and pecans toasting ahead of time.)

There is plenty of dressing for this recipe. I could have almost halved it. Used roasted garlic, tomato paste and dried french tarragon to replace the fresh tomatoes. Also added a dash of sugar and salt. Added an extra ear of corn since I had no tomatoes and used excellent asiago instead of parm. It was great.

I diced up all the tomatoes instead of quartering some (I like tomatoes in small doses) and sliced up some flank steak to make it heartier and absolutely LOVED this. Have made it 3 times in one month and think it's exceptional - comes together very quickly too! My new go-to summer salad!

I liked this as well and read the other reviews. Instead of basil, balsamic vinager, pecans I used cilanto, sherry vinager and walnuts. I didnt have parmesan on hand so didn't add cheese and it was still delightful. WILL definitely make this one again!!

This is a wonderful, crisp, clean salad. I also made the rosemary flank steak recipe on this site it was great. For lunch I threw the leftover steak into the salad...Yummy!

This was such a simple and fantastic salad! I will only add 1/2 the dressing next time, I like my salads lightly dressed, but other than that, perfection as is.

I've been making this salad ever since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit. After following it exactly a few times, I modified it by eliminating the rosemary, corn and pecans (baby greens can also be added or substituted). It's much easier that way and still fantastic. It's now known as my specialty salad among my friends, and I'm ALWAYS asked for the recipe.

I added an extra ear of corn, and substituted toasted pine nuts for the pecans. In the future I would halve the dressing amount and just put all the tomatoes in the salad, instead of half in the dressing. Great with grilled steak.

We really enjoyed this! Followed the recipe to a T.

This was outstanding! I made it with an extra ear of corn, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served with flank steak and grilled focaccia, it was the perfect backyard feast! My husband said he liked it even better the next night. Fresh and delicious.

I don't want to be a downer but, I wasn't all that impressed with the flavors. Granted I took some shortcuts, I used much less arugula, boiled the corn (fresh from the Green Market as were the tomatoes) and used freshly ground Parmesan instead of shaving it but, for some reason the flavors were a little jarring. Perhaps just too much going on when, individually, all the flavors were terrific. However, if everyone else loves it perhaps I just had a bad day.

add 1/2 a pint of fresh strawberries(sliced),1/2 a cup of cashews(lightly crushed) and 2 manderin oranges segmented and this is a 5 star salad.also add a bit more garlic to the dressing

this is a great recipe and much more flavorful than the other arugula and corn salad on this site. It does make a lot of dressing and the first time i made it I made the mistake of adding it all and it was a bit much...so make sure you add only enought to coat everything nicely.

I'm sitting in my apartment eating the salad right now, enjoying every frond of arugula. Incredible flavor combination. I didn't have basil because it wilted and died in my fridge, so I substituted with cilantro, and it tastes perfect. Quick enough to make for lunch, elegant enough to make for a dinner party. And the "delicate" color combination of the ingredients makes me feel like Martha Stewart!

Made this for a small dinner party - goes great with grilled t-bone steaks!

This is my favorite salad recipe!

I have to say, to the cook from san mateo, how can you claim that the ingredients are in the wrong proportions when you only used 1 T of olive oil? that severely alters the acid/oil balance. also, the recipe says to toss with enough dressing to coat, not to pour in the full amount. so you shouldn't have had liquid in the bottom of the bowl. I'm not trying to be hypercritical, but you seemed perplexed about why it didn't turn out for you.

A perfect summer salad! This is a great combination of flavors, although I sub pine nuts for the pecans, and sometimes add quartered small bocconcini (fresh mozzarella balls). Toasting the corn adds another flavor dimension, this is my favorite salad in the peak of summer when the produce is good.

I hate it when a recipe receives glowing reviews but when I make it, it doesn't come out well. It makes me feel incompetent or something! Anyway, I love the ingredients, so I was looking forward to the final result. Overall, the amounts of individual ingredients were not in the right proportions to each other, even though I measured. I would recommend using only half a pound of halved cherry tomatoes in the salad part, halving the balsamic vinegar, increasing the basil to 4T, using 2t rosemary (that's what I did by mistake and it seemed just right), and doubling the corn and pecans. (I think one ear of corn is 1/2 c?) Also, the dressing left a fair amount of liquid (balsamic vinegar) at the bottom of the salad bowl, and I even had used only 1T instead of 1/2c of olive oil!

Lovely salad. I am so thrilled that we can now buy arugula in the grocery store.

This is truly a fabulous salad. Excellent flavor blends-really great texture. Always a hit! If you want to impress, make this!

I have made this several times "as is" and also a homemade dijon vinaigrette version...all very fresh, crunchy and refreshing salads. Toasted pinenuts worked well also. How can you go wrong with corn and vine-ripened tomatoes!

I make this recipe exactly as it is and it's GREAT! My family, who are not the most adventurous eaters, love this salad.

This salad is YUMMY! I substituted pine nuts for pecans and cherry tomatoes for plum. I also fried a piece of procuitto crumbled on the top. The dressing is excellent.

I have been making this salad whenever I can get arugula. I'm not crazy about the walnuts -- I either leave them out or substitute toasted pine nuts. I get rave reviews from friends & family.

Truly a taste sensation. My husband who is not a salad-lover, requests this one. It's fairly easy to make. I take a shortcut on the corn when it's out of season and just steam the frozen variety instead of grilling whole cobs.
