I wouldn't make this recipe again for two reasons: the first is that the shrimp, while not bad, were nothing special. The second was that the vinaigrette was a bit runny and tasted too strongly of the rice vinegar. Cucumber is such a subtle ingredient that it was overwhelmed by the pungent flavor of the seasoned rice vinegar. Perhaps the reviewers who complained about a lack of flavor used the unseasoned version...Also, it was difficult to get it to adhere to the shrimp without constantly remixing the sauce.

I really wanted to like this recipe more than I did, but I was disappointed. I took it on a picnic and the shrimp was really cold--I really didn't like the texture as a result, and I just couldn't get over that. I loved the cucumber vinaigrette, but I just can't give the dish a thumbs up.

I love curry, so the shrimp turned out well. I used Morton and Bassett's (a great line) yellow curry. The dip, however, was a little on the bland side so I added a little plain yogurt to thicken it, and then some salt, pepper, coriander and a dash granulated garlic. I like a lot of punch in my cooking.

Instead of using the curry as directed I got a pre-made Curry paste I found in the International section of the supermarket. I brushed the shrimp with it and followed the rest of the directions. Yummy! We've made this new favorite dish of my husbands several times. Easy quick and even better served cold.

Looks much better than it tastes. To its credit, it is easy to prepare. Be sure to put a wooden skewer through the shrimp before sauteing or they will curl up into a tight little spiral.

Super! I've made it twice. Make sure you use a non-stick pan.

The shrimp were okay but the cucumber dip was very bland, and a bit too salty. I'd make the shrimp again but would find another dip.

Killer. Make a double batch.

The shrimp were delicious and incredibly easy but the sauce seemed to be missing something. I would make the shrimp again, but I would most certainly omit the sauce.

These were very good, and easy! Actually made as a main course. Served with the pickled cucumber and radish dish, and the corn and green onion cakes also from Epicurious. Great dinner! The vinaigrette is yummy. Am going to try the leftover over salad tommorrow.

Deliciously Simple ! This recipe packed a lot of flavor into a simple dish with the use of the cooling vinegrette.

So simple and tasty! I didn't make the vinaigrette; the shrimp were good on their own.
