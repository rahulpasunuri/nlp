Comment on the above review: InstaCure is intended also for use in sausage etc. The figure 1 tsp. per 5 lbs. is appropriate when all of the curing compound remains in the meat. This recipe uses InstaCure as a brine, and so a majority of it will not be absorbed.

I have not made this recipe, I just want to point out the mount of instacure called for. The manufacturer recommends only 1 teaspoons for 5lb. of meat.
