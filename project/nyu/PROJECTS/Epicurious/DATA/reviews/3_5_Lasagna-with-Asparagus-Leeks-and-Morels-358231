I thought this was a wonderful and unique recipe. The only change I made was adding more cheese. I also cooked one big dish rather than doing individual ones.

Just one thing to add to the other reviewer's tips- grate a light parmesan you love, and keep a little extra on hand if you're using one large baking dish.I used a bulk pre-grated parm to save time, and it was too salty.

The flavors in this recipe are good, but the cooking directions are poor. Really, 4 1/2 cups of liquid are going to be thickened by sprinking in 2 T. of flour? I had to back up and make a conventional bechamel, or my noodles would have been swimming in cream diluted with chicken stock.

I made this last evening and i too found it took longer to thicken even slightly. Used shitake mushrooms as morels were not available. Loved it, but would add more veggies next time. I used gratin dishes and they worked out well. Nice for dinner guests. Very impressive.

Great dish for a dinner party. All of the reviews here were very helpful - the sauce does take a very long time to reduce. Delicious!

This was a wonderful spring-time dish. The white sauce was so flavorful with the bay leaves, but DID take way longer to thicken. I added the flour, as directed, but it all turned to lumps and i had to strain it. I used "wondra" flour the second time around and it worked fine. I, too, doubled the ingredients to make it in one big pan. Very tasty, not too heavy, and elegant. I'll make again, for sure! Everyone enjoyed.

What a soupy mess. I boiled the sauce as noted and even longer as it was not thickening. It would have been nice to know what the writer expect the reduced and thicken sauce to be in cups once it was done. I had cups of sauce and directions to use spoonfuls???? HUH???

Unlike the other reviewers I was not impressed by the recipe. It could have been because I substituted buttermilk for the cream in the sauce which resulted in the sauce never really coming together. (I had buttermilk that needed to be used and I prefer not to cook with cream due to the fat content.)

Fresh tasty spring treat! Increase the recipe ingredients and place in a 9x13, works great. Also, the sauce took longer to thicken for me as well. I used shitakes. Earthy goodness!

Creamy and delicious. Maybe due to the thickness of the asparagus, I was unable to do the third layers in my 2-cup round ramekins. It was very good though, and makes more than 4 servings - more like six or seven. In fact, I doubled the recipe and ended up with 8 ramekins, 6 teacups (for the kids), AND a 8x8 pyrex!

This was amazing - we made a few additions to the recipe. We used shiitake mushrooms which we browned before adding the asparagus. We had some pancetta so we chopped that, browned it and added it to the veggies. We used some cognac to deglaze the pan and add some acid to the sauce and used truffle butter instead of regular butter. Was a perfect spring meal!

I tried this because we had beautiful morels at our local farmer's market. I made a few changes. I soaked some dried porcinis and used that liquid along with flour and some half and half to make the cream sauce, which I made in the skillet after sauteing but didn't make it quite as rich. And I made it in a 8x8 pyrex pan. I think it would be great with shitakes too

I loved this recipe. I can't wait to make it again. It did take me longer for the sauce to thicken then what is stated in the recipe but was worth the wait. Yum!
