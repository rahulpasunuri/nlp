One Fork for this one. I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce for this recipe, and as "A Cook from Los Angeles" wrote, i had to increase the cooking time; for me at least twice as much time, which resulted in dry chicken breasts. I think the flavor concept of raisins mixed with curry has "legs" but not with the heavy tasteless roux that goes along with this recipe. I would not recommend this to any foodie. I will be removing this one from my recipe box.

Easy and tasty, but as several previous reviewers noted, a kid-friendly entree (probably because the flavors are on the blander end of the spectrum, as several other reviewers noted). I used dried sweetened cranberries and pistachios instead of the raisins and almonds called for in the recipe...yum!

Excellent and so easy. The entire family enjoyed it, kids included. It would appear that you spent the day in the kitchen.

Delicious! I took this recipe to a Moroccan themed potluck and it was a hit! A simple and quick recipe that is sure to impress. I was amazed at the flavour. The sauce is delicious. Serve it with couscous as a side and it makes for an easy an impressive meal.

I didn't like this dish at all; I found the sauce too heavy and the flavor cloying, even though I made the dish with free range chicken thighs and fresh homemade curry powder. Instead of smothering the chicken with a creamy sauce, next time I'd grind twice as much onion with the almonds, curry powder, sherry, and a little oil, and rub the chicken with the result. That way the chicken could brown and the apples would have a chance to caramelize while they baked. I'd also use perhaps half as many raisins.

Excellent recipe and not alot of kitchen time for the end result! The sauce does thicken a bit to much, I added a touch more milk and doubled the curry powder. My kids even loved this recipe... This is also a great recipe for entertaining, its easy and delicious.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I tripled the sauce however and was glad that I did. The flavors meld perfectly together and leftovers are even better the next day

This was the first time I ever used fruit in a main dish, so I was a little concerned. My concern was unfounded as this dish was fantastic! This may not be authentic Morrocan food, but it is tasty just the same.

This was surprisingly good. I usually make chicken grudgingly, only when certain guests are known to be non-experimental or finnicky eaters. In this case it came out very well. Also, this is the only recipe I know that you can actually make with boneless-skinless breast meat, something I typically abhore. What this recipe fails to tell you is that you're really making a roux, so don't be surprised when your "sauce" thickens before you smother the chicken with it...a great idea, it keeps the meat really moist in the oven. Just make sure you make a lot of the sauce, more than the recipe calls for. I needed longer oven times, but the temperature was sufficient.

I loved this recipe--I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco--and although I never came across this dish in particular, the tartness of the currants played off well a/g the curry powder and apples. I served it with cous cous, baby carrots and a starter dish of harira (Moroccan soup)--highly recommend.

I don't know where this recipe came from but it is not Moroccan. It looks like a recipe that substituted things out of the original dish. I know of one that is similar but it is not bland like this and we Moroccans don't use this boneless, skinless chicken like here. Nor do we use sherry in most dishes because of our country being muslim. This could be a form of a Moroccan-jewish recipe, they are the only ones in our country that use any alcohol or wine in cooking. But the recipe is still off because they have as much seasoning in their food as we do and there is just somethings missing.

For once, I followed the recipe exactly as written. But, this one didn't do much for me. It was rather bland. It could use some zip. Perhaps, my curry (I used Madras) is milder than other curry powders.

Very easy to make...good dish for a week night. I made wild rice with apples to serve with it and it was very good. Don't think I'd serve it to company--but excellent for "home use".

My husband raved about this dish, the kids even liked it (one picked out the rasins). I made a theme dinner with this and couscous and Moroccan spiced carrots, then discussed where Morocco is, etc.

Dear NY NY cook, Your comments are misleading: the recipe does call for "skinned" chicken breasts. It does call for apples (not kumquats), and it does get topped off with slivered almonds. Perhaps you were reviewing another recipe?

Rating: 2
this was good, but not a great dish. i substitued apples for kumquats and topped also w/ toated slivered almonds (having had a look at another moroccan recipe). if i make it again, i will probably use skinless chicken breast to reduce the amount of fatty oil, which i thought detracted from the flavor.

Had this for two, and made plain rice, and peas. Was very tasty, and we really enjoyed the recipe. Preperation and cooking time is minimal, and the sauce we prepared ahead of time, so with guests being entertained, you can have the appetizer while the main course is cooking.
