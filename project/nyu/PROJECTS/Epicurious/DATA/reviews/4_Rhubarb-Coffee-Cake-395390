Made as directed but reduced ingredients in half, as suggested by another author. Baked in a square 8 x 8 pan and it was delicious. My husband thought a little ginger would be interesting, so may add this next time.

Easily converts to an 8 x 8 pan by just cutting it in half. Baking time is about 30 minutes longer, as other have noted. Very nice cake, but didn't have a huge amount of rhubarb flavor.

Not sure at all what went wrong with this recipe. A friend had recently made it and said that it needed to cook longer than the recommended time, but even with 35 extra minutes, this turned out way too undercooked in the center. I think I agree with an earlier reviewer who suggested splitting the batter into two smaller pans for prettier presentation and perhaps more even cooking. The cake is really very tasty, so I will try this one again with two pans.

Delicious! My family has grown rhubarb for 50+ years, and have tried nearly every recipe we can find. This is a new family favorite.

Would have liked a little more rhubarb 'presence' in this recipe. Tartness was lost. May try again with Granny Smith apples. Cake itself is delicious!

This was delicious. The sweetness balances nicely with the slight tartness of the rhubarb. I only used half the topping, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I gave it only three forks because the cake took about twice as long to bake as it was supposed to. As the first reviewer said, when the cake was finally done, it was still quite moist despite the extra time in the oven.

I just made this cake for my mom for her Mother's Day brunch. I assembled all the ingredients last night; it was a snap to put it together this morning. I didn't have the dark brown sugar so used light brown and added 1 T of molasses to give it that rich flavor. Used one small vanilla bean and scraped the seeds. As another reviewer suggested,I only used 1/4C sugar & 2tsp cinnamon and lightly sprinkled it over the top and pressed it into the cake top. It gave just enough "crunch" to the topping. It did't have enough time to cool for an hour..we cut into it after a 30 minute rest and it was fine. Best of all, my mom loved it.

I made this coffee cake this morning; everyone loved it. The buttermilk and rhubarb are a rich and surprising combination ---- not the usual cinnamon coffee cake. I made one substitution and would do one thing differently: Prior reviews and the ingredients indicated it would be too sweet for my family's taste, so I used 3 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat. Plus, I reduced the sugar cinnamon topping, using 1/4 cup sugar with 2 teaspoons cinnamon. The cake turned out great --- slightly darker appearance with the wheat flour. It was plenty sweet.... And I think the cake would be easier to serve and slightly prettier made in two rounds, rather than the recommended 9x13 pan.

So sorry about the misinformation. This cake does need 2 sticks of butter-- 1/2 lb. I submitted too soon! It is an amazing cake, and big! Perfect for a brunch potluck.

This was exceptionally moist and tasty. Sweet but not too sweet, the rhubarb adds that nice tart counterpoint. Mine cooked in 40 minutes (it was moist inside, but done). The sugar on top got crunchy and was a nice contrast with the soft fruity bottom. BTW half a pound of butter *is* two sticks, the recipe is correct. A pound is four sticks.

NOTE: I have a correction to this recipe. it asys 1/2 lb of butter is 2 sticks, but it is really 1 stick!

Very nice and moist cake - not too sweet tasting. It could do with far less sugar on the topping, maybe just a light sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. I used the amount in the recipe and shook off the excess after the cake cooled and was cut. In my oven, the cake too much longer to cook (nearly 30mins longer than the specified 45 mins for the toothpick to come out clean, and the cake was not at all over-cooked...very moist). Would make this one again.
