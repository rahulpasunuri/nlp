Tasty, however slightly bland. I much preferred a similar soup on this same site "Kale and White Bean Soup" which was much more flavorful. This soup was fast and easy - good on a weeknight.

There are some wonderful suggestions by other cooks here that I will definitely try next time. I made this pleasing, homey soup with low- sodium chicken stock and still added a little water, so it turned out to be just slightly but comfortingly bland, reminding me very much of the brothy soups my Dutch grandmother used to make. I'm avoiding too much salt in my diet, so to bring up the flavour next time I think I'll try sauteing the beans, as others have suggested. I also added pepper. Plus, I topped the soup with wonderfully simple boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I seasoned with a pinch of salt, pepper, sage, toasted celery seeds, and a tiny bit of cumin, then pan-fried in a pat of salt-free butter. Believe me, don't skip the butter. It's worth the extra calories. Delicious!

I've made this soup a few times and really love it. I haven't tried cooking the beans ahead of time but do add bacon, mushrooms, and use the escarole water instead of plain water. It definitely needs seasoning but is really delicious with a bit of salt and a touch of vinegar and some smoked paprika.

This soup has 4 star potential. The changes I make are to use all LOW-SODIUM broth (no water)and to the vegetable mix, I also add chopped fennel (anise) and a chopped leek. And at the end I add browned, cooked through and thoroughly drained and blotted sweet Italian Sausage. It is utterly delicious!

I did take a recommendation and cooked the white beans in olive oil with some crushed red pepper and garlic for 5 minutes. I also added a splash of vinegar with the broth. Overall, a healthful and delicious dish for a chilly night.

The recipe was just what we were in the mood for on a cold night. I also sauteed the beans a bit before I added the broth. I used all broth and it turned out really well. I also added a little hot sauce at the end for little kick.

To make this very good recipe excellent (more like how my Great Gramma made it) I follow these steps: - saute cannellini beans until crispy in olive oil to add depth of flavor and texture before adding to broth. - make Italian soup meatballs (85% lean beef, freshly processed bread crumbs soaked in milk, sauteed onion, fresh garlic, Worchestershire, eggs, parmesan, parsley, and S&P. Roll into marble sized balls and saute until brown and crispy. Add to soup for last 10 minutes. - add as much parmesan rind as you have available - More broth, less water. - Serve with additional shredded or grated parmesan and crusty bread When making soup, always double the recipe! Fast, inexpensive and delicious!!

Soup was missing a layer of flavor for me. Next time I would use less water and more stock and perhaps a parm rind for substance. Would also try the pesto suggestion from earlier reviewer.

this was great with a spoonful of pesto (or in my case, a pesto cube--i made some this summer and froze it) added to the soup bowl when serving, in addition to romano cheese. it was big hit, and inexpensive to make.

I make this soup whenever we get a little cold snap down here in Texas. Simple and delicious. A family favorite

This soup is fantastic! I used more stock that it suggested (only 1 cup water) and added salt to taste and it really turned out great. It was the hit of the meal. I usually have no patience for soup, but this one is quick and easy.

GREAT soup recipe! I added an extra clove of garlic and ommitted the carrots and we loved it. I also added a couple drops of green tabasco sauce for added flavor -- not spicy, just good flavor.

Simple and delicious! Even better the days after you prepare it. This soup is anything but bland. The escarole gives it a wonderful bite. And you must use parmesan!

Good, healthy soup but a bit bland. I didn't add cheese, which surely would have added some flavor.

I made this soup with 6 cups of low fat chicken broth and 1 cup of water. Also added some canned peeled tomatoes and crushed red pepper when the liquid was added to the pot. The beans make it hearty enough for a dinner meal. Pinto beans give it a slight bacony flavor. Very tasty soup packed with goodies.
