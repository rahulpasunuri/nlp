One of the easiest receipes I have made. No processer needed, I used my hands and patted it into the pan. Simple and a perfect base. I shortened the cooking time by about 4 minutes as a base for Lemon Bars.

Wow! Nice and easy preparation with quality a result. The food processor definitely saves time. I've used this for lemon bars and it holds up well though I do bake it for an additional two minutes. Very worth the little effort for a great dessert.

This recipe is fantastic (and I don't usually bake)! After reading all the other reviews, I decided to give it a try. The shortbread is incredibly easy & very yum! I've made both the lemon bars and the pecan pie bars and received rave reviews on both. And the highest compliment ever, my sister-in-law who's a fabulous baker asked for the recipes!

These are incredibly delicious! My kids were swooning! The butteriness of the shortbread combined w/the cake-iness of the brownie is unique and tasty together. I recommend cutting them into small pieces as they are very satisfying. We're selling them at our school fall fair and calling them "Shrownies" - where SHortbread meets bROWNIES! Great holiday gift idea too.

Boy, I was really excited to try this with all the good reviews on the shortbread, but, boy, was I disappointed!! I used it for the lemon bar base and found it to be fairly flavorless and soft. I prefer a firm, crisp shortbread base for lemon bars. Used this and the lemon bar recipe because I could not find my regular go-to lemon bar recipe. I will dig harder - didn't compare to the one I got from a friend and have used for the last couple years.

Great shortbread recipe, extremely taste and easy to make, even without a blender. Just lovely!

This was the easiest shortbread recipe I ever made. And you definitely need a food processor or blender. I tried it at first with a mixer and that didn't cut it. Quick and simple. Loved it!

I love the simplicity of this recipe, and the quantity is just right for a 13x9x2 pan. As a base for lemon bars, I substitute 1/2 ground flax for an equal amount of flour, add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and grated lemon peel. It's wonderful!

These are FANTASTIC! I made the pecan bars, and dipped one end into dark melted chocolate. They look and taste great, very easy and quick, too. Will be one of my standard Xmas cookies from now on.

To the cook from Albany, you can cut the butter by hand into the flour as you would for making a pie. Stop when the butter bits are smaller than peas, and the mixture clumps together with a gentle squeeze. I have made this shortbread base with the lemon bars and they were great.

I'm curious, these bars sound great, but I don't have a food processor. How would that affect the dough? could i do it by hand, or mixer?

Great! I made it with the blueberry cheesecake bars - yum - and I am looking forward to making it again with some of the other toppings. The base is very good - a solid recipe.

This is one of my absolute go-to recipes for quick and great desserts. I've made the lemon bars, cheesecake bars, and pecan bars using this base. It is never fail for me and everyone loves the outcome. I love the lemon bars best, but the pecan bars get the most raves. Just a great, convenient recipe.

Rating: 4
I have used this base for every recipe that requires a shortbread base. For those of you having problems getting the bars out- forgo the heavy greasing and line the pan with parchment paper instead. It's non-stick, plus the overhang gives you something to hold on to when you pull the bars out. I let them cool completely in the pan, remove, then cut.

I won a dessert contest with the lemon bar recipe. Everyone loved them!

I used this recipe to make the pecan pie bars, and I must say that I've had better shortbread crusts than this one. My lemon bar recipe (not from Epicurious) uses confectioner's sugar in addition to the flour to give a more tender crust. If I were to make any of these bar cookie recipes again, I would use that other recipe for the crust instead of this one.

Response to Buddy7744 for his/her response to Nadiat's post. Nadiat asked an honest question. The option we have to review or to comment is to help fellow cooks/bakers. There is no need to belittle someone or to somehow elevate yourself as a "more experienced" cook. There was nothing negative about the question, but it is noted that we are invited to post comments, positive or negative... Presumably without being insulted for doing so. Let's keep these reviews in the spirit they were intended to be and let no one ever feel they cannot ask a question for fear of ridicule.

In response to the review from nadiat, you use the ingredients as they come (in this case cold UNSALTED butter from the refrigerator) and the crust recipe turns out fine. I have made the pecan bars many times with this crust and have always gotten rave reviews. Perhaps you need a bit more cooking experience before you send in a bad review of a good recipe.

Usually Gourmet's recipes are quite specific, so I'm surprised that they did not specify the temperature of the butter. Should it be room temperature? Chilled?

I followed the recipe exactly and made only one change: I added the rind of a single lemon. My neighbor, who is a fan of tart lemon bars, said these were nice and tart but that they could still be a bit more tart. I'm not sure how I could acheive this as I used very tart lemons. Also, for folks complaining of crumbling bases: generously butter the pan and then really flatten the mixture with a metal spatula. I really put some muscle behind the flattening and I had a perfect base. Follow the directions for baking til golden, too.

I was very disappointed in this dish. It ended up way too crumbly, and I followed the directions to a T. I literally had to fight with the bars to get them out of the pan. The blueberry topping was great, but the shortbread ruined the whole thing

I followed the 20 minute cooking time suggestion. It worked perfectly. The lemon bars were a big hit. I will make them again.

I made these and everyone really enjoyed them. Made some of the adjustments that other bakers suggested. Then I tried the Double Lemon Bars, also from this site -- I wish I'd have left well enough alone! Those bars weren't very good. I'll stick with this one: good crust, lemony custard, easy.

lemon filling was perfect. shortbread base needs some work. way too hard, not at all flakey. will try the blueberry next time with a different cookie base....

Rating: 3
I made both the lemon bars and the pecan bars from this recipe and, while both were tasty, the base was definitely a little too hard and crumbly if you wait for it to become golden. Cook it ONLY for 20 minutes and they're much better. But try both, because they're both delicious!

This recipe is a winner. I made the lemon bars and everybody loved them. Each Xmas (for 3 years now), I make the richer version of the pecan bars and everyone just loves them..

Rating: 2
Exceptionally easy with a food processor. In response to the reviews, I made 2/3 of the recipe but still used a 13"x9" pan. The shortbread was very thin and barely covered the bottom of the pan. I also reduced baking time, but only by 1 min. Finally, I always line the pan with some kind of foil/paper to make the contents easy to remove! BTW, I used this base for Pecan-Pie Bars.

I made the recipe for the lemon bars and it was great. Very lemony--be sure to sprinkle with the confectioners sugar. I gave the recipe to my boss and she made the chocolate macaroon--they were great, too. This is a fun idea--a single base with multiple alternatives for the topping.

I made this shortbread for the lemon bars and it was great, although it came out a little too golden around the edges. Next time I will try baking it for a shorter period, maybe 16-17 minutes instead of the full 20.

I made mine with raspberry preserves in the middle and it got rave reviews at two different parties I took it to! It was delicious! And much easier than I expected... I did the whole thing in the food processor - even the cheesecake part of it!

I made the lemon bars for a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl. Everyone absolutely loved them. Play around with the recipe a bit. Be a little creative.

In regards to using this for the Lemon Bars, there was just too much crust. Not that the crust was bad or anything, it's just that there was too much there. In terms of area space, there was more crust than filling. Don't be afraid to experiment with this shortbread, even though one reviewer said no. I once made a Lemon Tart with a slightly-lighter crust, which had less sugar, buttermilk, and sour cream. It was darn good, one of the best crusts I've ever had. Don't be afraid to experiment...

I did this crust with both the lemon and the blueberry toppings. It was dried out and not at all appealing. Not a winner in my opinion.

My sister introduced me to this recipe. She tops hers with sliced strawberries and maybe a mint sprig, then glazes with a light berry jam. Beautiful and delicious...I'm making them for my daughter's graduation party.

yuck. It was too thick and tasted like flour and nothing else. Next time, back to the graham cracker crumbs!!!

Oh, this is so yummy. I've made the lemon bars a few times, and noticed that the base is pretty thick--so I scooped some out and baked it in a custard cup. It was a treat to nibble while the lemon bars were baking. Try this--it's so simple you can't go wrong.

I've made this twice with the leomon bars and it was excellent both times. I generously buttered the pan, both sides and bottom and had no problem removing the bars. Also, I don't have a food processor, so I made it the old fashioned way using two knives, then a pastry cutter. I think it turned out fine and apparantly so did everyone else!

I thought this base was too dry - I must have not measured something correctly. I also thought the recipe made too much base for the bars - next time I will try half the shortbread base and add a tbs more butter.

Exceptionally easy to make and an ideal base for any sweet dish requiring a pastry base. I found it easier and tastier than doing a biscuit crumb base. To make things easier I line the base and sides with alfoil so that it's easy to remove.

A perfect shortbread base and it doesn't take 5 minutes to get it in the oven if you use a food processor. Sooo glad I have the recipe. I made both the lemon bars and the blueberry cheesecake bars with the base - delicious with both.

Oh my, oh my, oh my!!! What a wonderful crust this made. And it was just too easy to make. I couldn't believe how flaky it became. The directions say to bake for 20 minutes, but because I did not preheat my oven I baked the dish for 25 minutes and it came out so flaky and just down right perfect! I was so pleased with my handy work. I served the shortbread base with the blueberry-cream cheese bar dish; however, I used boysenberries instead. I hate blueberries. The Boysenberry-cream cheese mixture was a wonderful tart contrast to the sweetness of the shortbread. And the soft, creamy topping compared to the flaky crust was another treat. A dish that looks like it takes hours and so much effort, but only took a few minutes to make. A most definite keeper!

This is a versatile and tasty crust recipe that will replace many of my more expensive and complicated ones!!

This shortbread base is excellent. I created my own recipe with it, which shortened completion time. After I took the shortbread base out of the oven, I added a jar of English Seville Orange Marmalade as a topping. The tartness of the Seville Oranges balanced nicely with the base.

I used this recipe to make a base for a "conventional" cheesecake baked in a springform pan. At first I tried halving this recipe for an 8-inch diameter cake. The second time I made three-quarters of the recipe for the same size springform pan. This one was better. It makes an unbeliveably good crust that everyone loved!

This is a delicious (sinfully) base. So far, I've made the pecan pie bars, blueberry cheesecake and fudgy brownies-all terrific, but extremely rich. They're delicious with coffee and vanilla ice cream/whipped cream.
