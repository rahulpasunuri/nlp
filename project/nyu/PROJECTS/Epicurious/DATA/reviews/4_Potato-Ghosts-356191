I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and fashioned them into snowmen. I piped 3 graduated circles and used finely minced black olives for eyes, mouth and buttons. Didn't have time to fashion a nose but I planned to use roasted red peppers for a scarf but didn't have any on hand. The grandkids went wild for them.

I make this every year, a couple of times in October. The kids love it, tastes good, and is perfect for the season. The only time involved is sticking the "eyes" on the ghosts.
