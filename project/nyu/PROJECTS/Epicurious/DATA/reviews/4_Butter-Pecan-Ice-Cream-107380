Absolutely DIVINE!!!!!!! I didn't use 4 whole eggs; just used 3 egg yolks and scaled down on the nuts. I love nuts, but I want less nuts than ice cream; used 1/2 cup nuts. Plus, I cut the recipe in half, so my calculations are based on 1/2 the recipe. This is a KEEPER......with a few tweaks here and there.

Butter pecan is my favorite ice cream so when I found this recipe I couldn't wait to try it. YUM! I also cut down on the pecans by 1 cup. Having made other ice cream I also used 6 egg yolks instead of 4 whole eggs. I think it made the custard more creamy thus the ice cream had a very smooth and rich texture. Can't wait to serve it to friends and family.

This is really delicious! It was a little softer than most ice cream I make with my KitchenAid ice cream attachment but oh so yummy! I may try fewer nuts in the future.

When I used my KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker for the 1st time this is the recipe I tried. Is is soooo good I would like to leave it at that, however, I am making it again now and have cut back on the pecans to 1 cup.

Tried several butter pecan recipes and this is the best. Delicious. Don't take the shortcut eliminating the egg custard suggested in another review. The custard method isn't that difficult, doesn't go wrong if you pay a bit of attention and really makes a better ice cream.

Absolutely divine! First time making my own ice cream from scratch and with the way this turned out it won't be my last. The salty buttery pecans with the sweetness of the ice cream is a perfect combo. Ice cream base was spot on and surprisingly easy to do. Better than anything you'll get in a carton at the store. Making my mouth water now...yum yum.

debuted to rave reviews at the church ice cream social. We used this as a starting point for our own version of "chunky monkey"... added mashed banannas to the custard mixture... omitted pecans. took toasted butter pecans & spread on melted chocolate chips... making a chocolate/pecan candy bar. Broke into pieces & stirred in after freezer had completed. will definately use this recipe again :)

Best ice cream I've ever made, though I did make a few tweaks to the recipe. I dropped the number of pecans to about a third, slightly reduced the sugar, added a little brandy and dark rum to the mixture. All in all, this ice cream blew us away.

You don't have to go to all this trouble to make ice cream. The cooked custard method is delicious, but it's a huge hassle and can easily go awry. Equally delicious and much simpler is the tried-and-true sweet cream base method: whisk or beat 3/4 cup sugar into 1 cup whole milk until dissolved, then stir in 2 cups of heavy cream. The base is ready to go into the ice cream maker like this, and you add extra ingredients through the ingredient spout at the end. Here, you'd use brown sugar in the base instead of white sugar and just add the buttered pecans (and perhaps a splash of bourbon) at the end. A splash or two of vanilla in the base wouldn't hurt, either. Missouri summers are too hot to mess around with custards. Make this the easy way -- it's just as delicious!

This ice cream is delicious and easy! I added about 1 1/4 cup pecans. I will definitely make it again!

This is some of the best ice cream I've ever tasted. Rich and delicious. I used fleur de sel and a nice Irish butter. My guests went nuts for it.

I have tried so long to figure out how to make butter pecan ice cream, and this is it! The pecans have that perfect texture, though like other reviewers I agree less is more. . .

My guests went crazy for this, but we all agreed that less pecans is the way to go.

Fuzzy math going on here. 1 quart is 4 cups. You have 2 cups milk, 2 cups cream, 4 whole eggs and 2 cups pecans. Even if you cut the pecans in half you will have some air incorporated and end up with close to 2 quarts.

This was to die for! I used organic milk & 52% bf cream from my local farmers market. I cut back on both the sugar (used Demerara - all I had, but yum!) & the nuts, and it was still plenty nutty & sweet. It was so rich that a very little bit was satisfying. Can hardly wait to make it again!

Hands down, THE best ice cream recipe on this site. I too halved the pecans. I always wondered why the "butter" in butter pecan ice cream--now I see that it's because the pecans are buttered. Shall serve this to company tomorrow with fresh peaches macerated with bourbon. Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

Very good. But both my son and I agree that about 1/2 of the amount of pecans would be adequate. And I'm a praline lover! Mind you, I didn't chop the pecans finely, so perhaps this makes a difference. One thing I found interesting was tasting the pecans before putting them in the ice cream, they didn't seem sweet enough. But once mixed, the salty/sweet balance worked nicely.

I've made this ice cream several times and ALWAYS get rave reviews. I frequently double the recipe but need to adjust the cooking time for the custard; mine, usually around 12 minutes.

I've made this twice to rave reviews. Both recipients said this was better than any highend brand at the supermarket. It is definitely worth the money to get the Plugra and the Fleur de Sel. The only thing I did was to make the pecans and refrigerate them overnight along with the base mixture. Just added a certain something.

This is a delicious ice cream recipe, but for some reason, it made FAR more than the 1 qt claimed in the recipe. So much so, that it overfilled my ice cream machine (which was a clean up nightmare). My machine holds 1.5 qts, so this is kind of insane that it would make so much more. That said, it was really tasty.

The best ice cream recipe i've found. easy to make perfectly again and again. I only used 1 cup sugar and add extra cornstarch to help it thicken more. Needs to chill at least 8 hours before putting in an icecream machine

Really great! Only used 1 cup pecans and 1 cup sugar...I served with the caramel- chocolate sauce on the site and candied pecans with a shot of bourbon. It didn't seem to set up much in the ice cream maker but froze nicely none-the-less.

oh yeah, watch the salt. I had to throw out the first batch of pecans because I accidently added to much salt

This is a wonderful recicpe. My only change was to reduce the pecans by 1/3 then making a pecan 'butter' out of 1/3 cup of browned pecans.

OMG!!!!!! This is the most decadent and creamy butter pecan ice cream my family has eaten. It is simple to make, and requires a GOOD instant read thermometer! I did temper the egg/sugar mixture with some of the hot cream/milk to avoid curdling the eggs. I had very few lumps when I strained it:) Both my kids and husband were taking turns licking clean the beater from my icecream mixer clean! They all proclaimed it was the worst think I had ever made and it was their responsibilty to hide all incriminating evidence! Such a scrafice:)

This is a fabulously rich ice cream, and very easy to make. I might take the advice of some other reviewers next time and reduce the quantity of pecans just a bit so I can enjoy the ice cream more!

This is an absolutely delicious ice cream, one of the best butter pecan. I agree with reviewer that 1/2 of nuts is enough. The ice cream is fabulous without nuts. I also recommend processing in ice cream maker (mine is a Krups electric) in two hatches as the consistency is better. Try a small scoop of this (without nuts) a small scoop of eggnog ice cream and a small scoop of ginger pear sorbet as accompaniment to Chocolate Mink desert. That is remarkable!

This is great ice cream! I cut the nuts down to 1/2 cup & the sugar to 3/4 cup. Perfect! It is best to leave the custard in the fridge overnight when making any ice cream - it enhances the flavors

One of the few 4 forks I've given. My wife pronounced this the best ice cream she has eaten and we have sampled many. This is only my 2nd try at home made, however. It has kept it's creamy texture sofar after a couple of days. It has a creamy almost maple flavor. Hmmm. I wonder if it would be even better with a little maple added. It does have a lot of nuts, but they do not detract from the delicious flavor. .

Delicious! However, a real pain in the neck to prepare. It took me ALL DAY!! To say nothing of the mess. I wouldn't make it again, but only because I don't have so much time to spend on ice cream. I must say, though, that I now understand why good ice cream is so expensive... BTW, I also used less pecans than the recipe calls for, and it was enough.

delicious! great texture and flavor. made as written , and used plugra (found it at sam's club) and regular kosher salt. i might try the base recipe and add skor bits instead of/in addition to the pecans for a different twist.

I scream, you scream, we all scream for this butter pecan ice cream. Okay, I'm taking liberties. I'm just so happy to finally find a recipe for butter pecan ice cream that tastes as good or better than store bought. Other recipes I've tried of this old fashioned favorite lack the charm and finesse required of a great standard. This recipe, however, has it all. It's easy to make. The texture is smooth and rich. The flavor has a mellow sweetness under the nutty, buttery richness. And the butter and pecans remain loyaly wed even when mixed with the ice cream at the end. My only nit, too many pecans. I know, they're the star of the show. But sometimes less is more. In the end, this recipe is going in my keeper file.
