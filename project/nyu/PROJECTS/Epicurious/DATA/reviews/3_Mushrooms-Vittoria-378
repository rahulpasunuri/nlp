I agree with the person who had an unfavorable final mushroom dish when she finalized this recipe. I'm quite sure that it was the wine that made this dish unedible. I used an inexpensive (3 buck Chuck) Charles Shaw Sauvignon Blanc and followed the recipe to the "T".

I make this dish all the time when I'm invited to a pot luck. I leave the garlic in for a little more intense flavor and add salt and pepper. It's perfect as a vegetarian side and people just seem to love it. If I have to make it ahead of time to bring, I put it into an insulated case so it's warm and bubbly when served.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was B-A-D. I seriously wonder if there was something wrong with the mushrooms because of the great reviews that have been received here. I may try it again just to see if it was the mushrooms -- but this was not even edible! Sounded great, as written, though!

It's amazing how simple this is and how good it tastes. I am one of those people who tends to think the more ingriedients in a recipe, the better it will be. Definitely not the case with this one. I made a dinner with asparagus soup, pasta with homemade roasted tomatoes, a spice cake, and all anyone talked about were these mushrooms. If you have mushroom lovers in your crowd, make this dish.

The perfect side dish! Works very well with red wine as well. Have made it many times, and always think about it when I entertain.

A very elegant side dish.

This recipe is great as written. You may enhance it by adding just two tablespoons tomato sauce (or less} and cook two minutes before the wine is added.
