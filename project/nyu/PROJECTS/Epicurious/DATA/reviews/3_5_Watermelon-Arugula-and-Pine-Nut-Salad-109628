Everyone loves this salad! I think the 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the dressing is too much...just add to taste knowing that you will be adding the additional fleur de sel at the end. I also like the pine nuts slightly toasted. It is very important to mix and serve this salad as soon as you dress it. I have also used white balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.

This was a big hit. I made it as written except I omitted the nuts.

This was a hit with a large crowd. I was pleasantly surprised as I'm not a fan of sweet and savory but needed to do something with a lot of left over, very ripe watermelon. I didn't change a thing. My only recommendation is to be sure not to add the dressing until right before you eat it as you want to be able to taste all the different flavors. Delicious and easy!

Terrific first course, followed by paella. Switched the feta out for crumbly goat cheese and added some roasted baby beets. A colourful, flavourful treat.

Perfect summer salad. We had it as an additional side with steaks and asparagus. The meal was perfect. The salad was easy to make and looked and tasted wonderful. I will definitely make it again.

Couldn't get arugula and substituted watercress and a bit of fresh mint. The flavors complemented beautifully. I served the salad accompanied by a variety of cheeses, crackers and summer sausage for a light, easy meal on a hot, humid evening. A glass of well chilled Pinot Grigio was so refreshing and a perfect match.

I have an obsession with watermelon, but I wasn't sure if I would like this recipe because I haven't found anything that compares to watermelon alone. However, this was the perfect summer salad. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

I made this and added in watercress and mint, used just a little bit of argula, and more watermelon. I also substituted pistachios (as recommended by another reviewer) and used shaved parmesan cheese. My guests loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Amazingly good and amazingly easy. The only thing I changed was to add a small amount of mint to the arugula and I agree that it's a good idea. One of the best summer salads ever.

This is a fantastic salad for the summer, but if you want to make it extra good, replace the arugula with mint, using less, so the watermelon takes center stage. Look for special mint like chocolate or lemon.

A very easy, delicious and unique salad! Tossing in a few slivers of onions and fresh mint tastes great.

Easy and delicious, especially with farmer's market arugula and watermelon. No pine nuts, so used almonds, and plain old kosher salt. I might try adding some scallions or cucumbers next time for a little more crunch.

Rating: 3
Very good, but I feel the ratio of Arugula to dressing/cheese is too high. 1 cup of greens per first course seems more appropriate. (4 cups total instead of 6)

Light and unusally delicious summer salad. The combination of ingrediants went suprisingly well togther. Thought that a lage dose of pepper enhanced the overall flavor.

This recipe works with all kinds of lettuce, but including some arugula makes a difference. It is best to combine everything just before serving so the salad doesn't get soggy. The Fleur de Sel worked beautifully!

I've made this recipe with mint instead of arugula. Absolutely fantastic! Nice light, fresh taste. Also, something exotic like a little pommogranate molassas in the dressing makes it quite special.

I used a mix of baby greens so the taste of the greens would not be that strong. I also used a champagne vinegar for a more suttle taste in the dressing......It was yummy!!!

Salads with fruit can be divisive - you like the diversity of taste & texture, or you don't. If you don't mind an adventurous salad, this one is exceptional. There are lots of enhancements suggested in the comments, but try it as-is first; it's near-perfect. Be sure to go with the feta if you can; ricotta salata is less flavorful & adds little to the dish. And don't forget to drain the melon!

I used half spinach and half arugula and balsamic vinegar. I liked the blend of flavors, especially the feta and watermelon with the vinaigrette.

Wow - fabulous. This was served after dinner, but before desert. Perfect. The only things done differently, we drained the watermelon for about an hour and we used toasted pistachio's instead of the pine nuts. Not one person didn't want seconds.

Here's my update: I brought the balsamic and mint version of this salad to a Fourth of July picnic (oh, and I added onion per a previous suggestion, which makes this basically a totally different salad) and several of the guests saw it and thought it was the Nigella version. After tasting the balsamic they also voted for it over lime juice. One actually said that she would never go back, though she had sworn by Nigella's recipe. Anyway, to each her/his own but I thought I would report the verdict among my friends (who might just be humoring me.)

Rating: 1
I found the dressing (as listed in the recipe) to be very bland and the salad just bitter even with plenty of sweet watermelon. I tried adding a small amount of sugar to the dressing - didn't help.

Rating: 3
Ok, I looked at Nigella's recipe and decided I had to try both. After taste testing each here's my verdict: I may be in the minority, but I found the lime's sourness overwhelming and misplaced in Nigella's recipe. However I would tweak this one too. Arugula is unusual, but I prefer mint in this salad. I also prefer balsamic vinegar rather than plain old red wine vinegar. White balsamic is nice for preserving the colors but either will do.

I've made this salad for several dinner parties and everyone enjoyed all of the delicious ingredients. I toasted the pine nuts, added sliced red onion and fennel. I also substituted goat cheese for the feta.

Absolutely delectable. Don't forget a dash of salt at the end. I might try this as a main course with some grilled shrimp on top.

This is an amazingly good salad! I admit I approached the recipe with trepidation given the odd combination of ingredients, but the results were divine. And I have to disagree with the other reviewers who said that they believe goat cheese (presumably a chevre or similar?) compliments the other flavors better than the feta called for by the recipe. On the contrary, I think the slightly dry, crumbly, salty feta contrasts wonderfully well with the juicy, crunchy, sweet watermelon. Not that I dislike chevre, mind you, but if you use it instead, I think you are missing out on the startling yet delicious juxtaposition of flavors that this recipe provides.

I hesitated about the number of forks to give this. The concept got me off the ground, but I made some of the changes suggested below. I prefer goat cheese to feta with any fruit, so I substitued that, then I also used the balsamic-based vinaigrette as another reviewer mentioned. Additionally, I would probably choose a different fruit next time. So, as written, this recipe is okay - but for it to be really good it is pretty much a totally different salad!

Rating: 4
I use watercress, partly because good arugula is so hard to find, and I like watercress more. It still has a peppery bite to contrast with the sweet watermelon.

Rating: 4
Guests consistently cite this recipe as their favorite course when I make dinner, and it could not be easier to do. One suggestion--add a dash of sugar to the watermelon if it doesn't taste sweet enough, to offset the peppery arugula.

I have to agree with the reader who used goat cheese with the watermelon, a variation of Jean-Georges' recipe from "Cooking at Home with a Four-Star Chef." I used a melon baller, the toasted pine nuts, tossed in a bit of Olive Oil & Balsalmic Vinegar and topped with with chunks of goat cheese. I tried both the feta & goat cheese and think the goat cheese is a much better compliment. Brought it to the beach for a potluck and got rave reviews.

I loved this salad! My friends did too. I also toasted the pine nuts. I cut the watermelon a few hours before assembling the salad. I left it in a colander in the fridge so it could drain. There was pretty much liquid that drained out. I couldn't find baby arugula, so I just bought what they had. It was gritty and sandy so I had to wash it seven times. Next time I see baby arugula I'll buy it and make this salad again. It was a perfect salad!

I really loved this..very refreshing and tasty. My wife thought the individual ingrediants were good, but that something was missing to bring all the flavors together. Since I'd give this recipe 4 forks and my wife 2, our average is 3 forks.

I did not like this recipe. I did toast the pine nuts. I did not like the watermelon. I think that it did not have enough substance, it was too watery, it detracted from the other ingredients. I used a sweet good melon so that wasn't the problem.

There has not been one person who has not fallen in love with this salad. I do toast the pine nuts before which gives them a better flavor.

We liked this salad, although my family thought the watermelon in it was a bit odd -- it was the consistency -- it just seemed weird in this salad. Will make it again but use strawberries or tomatoes next time.

I had dinner at a local restaurant last night and this salad was on the daily special list. It was delicious and refreshing. Imagine my surprise when I went on Epicurious today and saw the exact same salad! The only additional thing they did was to toast the pine nuts.

My friend brought this salad for a bbq today and it was absolutely delicious. It did get soggy quickly but the flavors were so fantastic. I would suggest throwing the arugula in at the last minute before serving it. There was nothing left of the salad since I finished every last bit of it. I will definitely be making this myself. Note, she used fat-free feta cheese and it was so light. Thanks for another great recipe!!!

I personally really liked this recipe, but I made it for family for whom "salad" requires a dressing poured from a plastic supermarket bottle. They thought it was just weird. The flavors are intense, yet summer light, and not for the unadventurous.

I suggest to substitute the wine vinegard with some drops of balsamic vinegard, in this way the taste is less acid and more flavoured.

for years i have been making a salad i poached from chef jean-georges vongerichten, from his book "cooking at home with a four-star chef", which is just watermelon, goat cheese, olive oil, salt and pepper - it is amazingly simple and delicious - this recipe takes that one a step further.

Try toasting the pine nuts in a skillet first, adds yet another dimension of flavor!

I loved this, though did get a couple of comments of "interesting" from a guest or two. People seemed to eat it, though, so I'll assume it was acceptable. It's very easy-and the feta really makes it work. Might be interesting with a little spiciness...
