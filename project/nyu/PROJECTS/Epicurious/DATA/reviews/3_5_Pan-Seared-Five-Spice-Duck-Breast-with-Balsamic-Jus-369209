Loved the flavour combo. Never would have thoght of combining the five spice with mediterranian flavours such as in the lentil salad.

I followed this recipe as it is written. The result was very, very tender meat with a delicious sauce. I will definitely repeat this recipe. It is easy and delightful.

I tried sending an email to Epicurious to point out an omission in this recipe, but all I got was an automated reply and the recipe has not been corrected. The first step is a marinade, but there is no liquid in the recipe. I don't think it is intended as a rub because it doesn't say to do anything with the ingredients other than put them in a zip lock bag with the duck breast. I put in some soy sauce and it was just okay. I would really like to know what it was supposed to be. Maybe someone else can figure it out.
