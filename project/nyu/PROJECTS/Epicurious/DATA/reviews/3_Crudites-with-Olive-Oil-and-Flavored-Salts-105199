This recipe was very disappointing. Both the curry mix and paprika mix were way too salty. The sesame mix was okay....toasting really brings out the flavor of the seeds, but overall...not all that remarkable.

A fabulous and unusual appetizer. But next time I would cut down the salt a bit (by 1/4 tsp) for the paprika and curry mixtures. Everyone must try this.

Could not be easier and really a nice change from other crudite platters. I use yellow, red and orange bell peppers, radishes, blanched green beans and blanched asparagus. Very pretty!

Served this at a party and everyone loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Wonderful and tasty appet. Try it with melon. We tried strawberry's and melon. The melon had the best flavor. Wouldn't use berry's again. Big hit with all who tried this.

We served this at an appetizer buffet and it was a smash -- both pretty and tasty. It will be on our next buffet
