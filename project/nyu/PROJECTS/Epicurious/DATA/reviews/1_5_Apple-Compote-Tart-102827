Followed the previous reviewer's comments and added ground cinnamon and raisins soaked in rum which saved it. Although it was not bad, I don't think this is the best I've made. I only made this tart because I had leftover apple compote and was trying to use it up.

Too bland.Maybe with a pinch of salt, some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg might be more interesting. Will try again that way.
