On my first attempt, I made two of these in the afternoon and that evening my book club declared them the 7th Wonder of the World. These cooking class recipes are invaluable as they give step by step instructions, which, when carefully followed, produce something special, as in this case. Have made it again and again, sometimes with almonds instead of hazlenuts, with perfect results.

Advice for Artroom below: I would suggest you purchase a thermometer for your oven (any hardware store will have them). I had all but given up on baking until someone told me the internal thermometer of my over was likely off, and it was. Now I know that if I set my oven at 350F, it is heating at 425F. A big difference when you're baking!! Good luck!

I like the recipe, especially the high meringue topping, but I have trouble with the crust. My oven is not the top of the line, and cooks much faster for baking. Even though I lowered the temperature of the oven, the crust was more brown than I would have liked. Any suggestions from anyone with a similar problem?

Okay, wait- I feel bad! The pie leftovers were far better the next day (surprising for a lemon meringue??); the slightly bitter aftertaste from the filling had mellowed, and though the crust really is rich, it's worth trying if you enjoy a rich pie. I wouldn't suggest making it a day in advance, but I guess the trick is to chill the pie and serve it cool. I took mine out of the oven, and served it around room temp. My mistake- give this is a try (though again, only if you would like a cookie-type crust). :-)

I have been making this pie for a few years now and it is one of our favorites. Someone in my family requests it at every holiday. It is well worth the time.

The lemon curd for this pie is terrific - good tartness, no runny center - however, the meringue and crust did not cut it. I thought it sounded delicious, and usually I can tell a good recipe when I see one, but I was disappointed in this one. I found the crust, delicoius on its own, overpowered the fresh taste of the lemon curd. The meringue, gorgeous out of the oven, fell to a normal size overnight. It was not unsightly as some say, but it was odd...not really a cookie meringue and rather sticky after spending 10 hours in the fridge. I let it cool completely before refrigerating and it did not weep, but it was difficult to slice through without ruining the appearance. I'm tempted to make this curd in a plain pie crust next time with my normal meringue recipe.

This is not a review. Just wanted to let you know that you have a lovely photo of a shrimp dish that accompanies this recipe.

Definitely labor intensive, but well worth it! The lemon filling was deliciously firm and the crust was to die for! (if you like hazelnut shortbread) As for the meringue, I did NOT mix it in a stainless steel bowl, but a ceramic one. As to be expected, it never got as stiff as I hoped, but it tasted just fine. It also didn't crack, as I've read that other's have. The meringue did fall by the next morning, but it wasn't unsightly. All in all, I'm going to give it another go today. Still the best tasting pie I've had.

After reading all the reviews, I was prepared for a luscious meringue pie. I was extremely disappointed in the entire pie. The crust was tasty, however, it took a pile driver to get it out of the pie pan. The filling was delicious, but the meringue was hard like a candy meringue would be. And it not only cracked while baking, it then fell when it was removed from the oven, making a very unsightly dessert. I much prefer to cook the pie till it's hot and then put the meringue on top and cook at a higher temperature until the meringue is just slightly golden on top about 5 minutes so that you get a soft, cloud-like meringue with golden peaks. I won't make this recipe again.

I have just compared the original printed recipe,located in the February 1998 issue (page 111), to the recipe printed here and so far all ingredients match EXCEPT for the meringue. This recipe calls for 1 1/8 cups powdered sugar and the original called for 1 2/3 cups. I made this pie last week, from the original printed recipe, and it was absolutely fabulous. Best lemon meringue pie I have ever tasted. All of my guests agreed. It also kept well in the fridge for leftovers. I was pleased that it wasn't overly sweet as most lemon meringues are. Once I tasted the crust (and had to stop myself)I knew the rest of the recipe was going to be as delicious. This recipe is by no means perfect: Although I didn't get that puddle of moisture on top of the filling, my meringue did fall as it cooled. It also had a thicker (meringue) shell than I care for and it cracked while baking. As other reviewers noted, the filling did not take 20 minutes to boil, only half that time. Lastly, I would heed the advice of others and press the crust into my pie plate next time instead of rolling it because it did tend to crack and was challenging to shape. It really is worth making and I will make it again and again even though I'm not a big fan of pies.

This is the best pie I've ever tasted. Crazy about hazelnuts, I love the shortbread crust. A little labor intensive but worth every minute. I'll never use another lemon pie recipe

Crust and filling were fabulous, but meringue was way overcooked at 50 min. - deflated badly and had a tough exterior. I would also cut back on the number of egg whites next time. I have made better meringue using regular sugar and beating in a little cooked corn starch paste to stabilize it. I don't like the uncooked starch flavor in powdered sugar. Lots of lemon zest makes the filling very lemony and delicious. I am looking forward to making this again with a better meringue.

This is the BEST meringue recipe you'll ever find! Couldn't believe that it should bake for 50 minutes, but it works!

I made this pie with meyer lemons, and the given amount of lemon zest-ugh. It was bitter. I made it again, and cut the zest to 1 tsp. It was perfect. The cooking time was less than the recipe called for, and with my adjustments, I would make this again.

I substituted pecans for the hazelnuts (no toasting necessary) and ended up patting the crust into the shell as other reviewers had. Be careful when you remove the shell from the oven to take the beans out. I knocked an edge off. Thankfully it went back together with a little repair work. The lemon filling cooked up alot faster than called for. It only took about 8- 10 mins. tops!! Also, using an upright mixer the meringue whipped up alot quicker taking only about 4 mins. to form stiff glossy peaks. Also, the baking time seemed too long also. After reducing the temp. to 275 I cooked it for only an additional 10 mins. or so. I just kept an eye on it until it was a light brown all over. It held up quite well (3 days) !!

I absolutely hate to be a wet blanket but I had a terrible time with this pie. It looked absolutely beautiful and we were all anxious to did in. First of all the crust stuck to the dish really badly and it was not over cooked or anything. The worst part was the lemon filling. It was horribly sour, my sister felt that the 2 tablespoons of lemon rind was the culprit. Maybe it should have been 2 teaspoons or something I don't know. It really tasted quite horrible and we actually threw it away when we were cleaning up, no one wanted to take a piece home with them which is usually the case with my desserts. A complete loser but I still feel that maybe it was my fault somehow because this recipe got such rave reviews. It was so bad though I won't even attempt it agin, I will try another one on the site.

I asked the elderly people for whom I was cooking Thanksgiving dinner what their favorite pies were and one lovely gent asked for Lemon Meringue. This is the recipe I chose to make. It was absolutely delicious. I used a regular homemade crust, and of course, there's no way that filling cooks on the stovetop for 20 minutes - try 5 to 10. Perfect and a mouthwatering presentation.

I've made this pie twice now. It turned out even better the second time around since I knew what I was doing. I cut back the amount of sugar ( to 1/3 cup pwdr and 3/4 cup granulated) which in turn made it so much tangier. Everyone said this was the best lemon merengue pie they had ever had.

Very very good I added more lemon juice (as a child I used to eat lemond....weird) Used white suger with th egg whites very good

Don't know what I did wrong, but my meringue cracked and as it cooled it fell. Looks pretty bad. I'm thinking that the cooking time on this recipe is too long, or perhaps the beating time is too long. Checked my other meringue recipes and they call for a significantly shorter baking time.

Very good, and not too difficult in the end. The texture of the lemon filling is lovely and the meringue is very impressive. I made two for Easter, one for my family and one for my boyfriend's, and both were finished in one sitting.

I found this recipe searching for a cookie crust to use with my own lemon meringue pie. I'm glad I did. I didn't have any hazelnuts and substituted toasted pecans. It turned out fine although I look forward to trying it with the hazelnuts. Rather than using a pie plate, I used a springform pan and pressed rather than rolled the dough. I took it up the sides about 1-1/2 inches. The amount of dough was perfect. I liked the resulting look of the pie. It's a keeper.

The consistency of the pie was wonderful. Our only complaint was that the meringue wasn't flavorful enough. Any suggestions? I'm afraid putting more powdered sugar in would change the texture.

This was absolutely the most divine lemon meringue pie I've ever made and served. I make a different one every year at Christmas for a guest who considers lemon meringue his favorite and himself, an authority. He agreed that it's the best and sealed the deal with a second piece!

I have made this many times and it is wonderful. Very easy,tasty and best of all company just raves about it. There is nothing like a lemon meringue pie made from scratch. Once you make one you will never go to back to using pudding for the lemon filling.

This was a perfect Lemon Meringue Pie for us! For the cook from Houston who couldn't find the recipe in her 1997 Bon Appetit magazine: it's in the February 1998 one!I had to search for it because I always enjoy seeing the pictures.

I made this pie for thanksgiving, knowing my sister-in-law has a weakness for Lemon Meringue. It was a HIT! She loved the real lemon flavor of the filling, and everyone loved the crust (which I didn't bother to chill or roll-just pressed into the pan) The meringue turned out perfectly. Definitely a keeper.

Great!!! The mound of meringue was spectacular, the filling was delicious. Yummy. Not as labor intensive as I thought it would be. I would recommend this to anyone. Four days later the refrigerated leftover piece of pie was still quite good.

I didn't screw it up like I have done before with other recipies, it was delicious and easy. Don't bother rolling out the dough - just press it in.

This pie was delicious beyond belief and was a great hit for a special anniversary dinner. I also pressed the crust in (great tip). I loved this recipe but I wanted the lemon filling to be a bit more tart. Next time maybe more zest next time. But a big hit none the less!

My friend brought this pie to a dinner party I had and it was fantastic. I've never been a fan of lemon meringue pie but this recipe definitely changed my mind. My husband and I were fighting over the last piece the following day. My friend mentioned that she did not toast the hazelnuts. I'm going to attempt to make it tonight and I'll try toasting them.

This pie is out of this world! Like another reviewer, I pretty much pressed my crust into the pie pan (although I did roll it out into a almost-pie-pan-sized circle first). Worked fine. It's a cookie crust, so there's not much danger of overworking it like you could with a regular pie crust. And the filling was a breeze! Mine didn't take 20 minutes to thicken, though -- more like 5 minutes. Putting the egg yolks into the cold mix really speeds things up. I love all the lemon in this recipe, too -- in the crust, and LOTS in the filling. Great meringue technique -- beautiful, high, firm meringue. I love this pie.

Like several other reviewers, I was confused about the amount of lemon juice to use for this recipe, so I went to my magazine files and got out my Feb 1997 issue of Bon Appetit, to look it up. It's not there! So not only is the ingredient list confusing, apparently the reference is incorrect as well.

I have not yet made this recipe. The reason being the amount of lemon juice is not clear. It looks like a 8 or 3 cups. Please clarify this as both of these sound excessive.

My family loves lemon pie. My wife was concerned about the details involved and thought I (a man) might have trouble with this. We took one with us to a friends for dessert at thier dinner party. It is the most delicous lemon pie ever and well worth the efforts. Never use a mix again!

What a great pie! I had never made this type of pie before and was pleasantly surprised. The crust is time-consuming like the other reviewers mentioned, but wonderful! A tip: Rather than rolling out the shortbread crust (mine cracked some), I just pressed it into the pie pan by hand. Worked just great.

This pie was delicious! A good change from the usual. Crust is a little more work, however well worth it. This meringue held up better than any other I have made. The recipe should show 1/2 cup of lemon juice for the filling. Hopefully it gets changed.

Having just seen this recipe at another point on this site, the amount of lemon juice should read 1/2 cup. How did anyone make and rate this without an amount printed?

I have made many pies as a previous foods teacher, but this pie is outstanding. The crust is great but time consuming and there have been times when I have made a simpler crust. The meringue and filling are wonderful. Have made this many times and this will be a definite keeper.
