Pretty easy to make and it really doesn't matter if the phyllo sheets break up when you bake them -- the dish ends up like an Egyptian bread pudding. I added extra raisins because we like them and used shaved almonds instead of whole. But it tastes very good indeed on its own, although with the cinnamon/clove ice cream recommended it's fabulous. Exotic comfort food.

this is an awesome recipe! really easy! we used only almonds as don't like raisins and didn't have any pistachios in the house. my Egyptian husband said that this was the best om Ali he has ever had! tastes great on the reheat in the microwave too!

This recipe should be called yum Ali! I made it last night and my husband pronounced it "heaven". It's so easy to make. I substituted half currants and half dried cherries, but made everything else the same. Served with cinnamon ice cream as suggested--was the perfect note at end of mediterranean meal. An eggless pudding that tastes just as good as traditional bread pudding. I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews of this since the recipe came out in 1995. Maybe it's our little known secret.

Don't let the fact it's phyllo dough scare you. This is a very approachable dish -- I prepared it the night before, stored in the fridge, and baked it during dinner so that it came out ready to serve piping hot. I recommend it with cinnamon ice cream.

om Ali, Oh my! Excellent, easy to follow recipe. I was a little apprehensive at the thought of working with filo dough but it worked just as the recipe said.
