A friend of mine made this using the Meyer lemons from her tree and it was incredible. I can imagine it accompanying a cheesecake or a panna cotta. I can't wait to make it.

Um...this made SO little. I tripled it and still, not much more than a cup. Too much effort for such a small amount.

Brilliant! Great on yogurt, ice cream, and any dessert where you want a lemony accent. Was incredible in cranberry sauce...

This is excellent with fruit. I omitted the pepper, though. I've used it with sliced pears, and with raspberries and a tiny dab of creme fraiche.
