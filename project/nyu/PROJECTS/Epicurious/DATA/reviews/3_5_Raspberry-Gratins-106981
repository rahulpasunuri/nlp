Halved the recipe, replaced the framboise with blackberry brandy, and followed reviewer's recommendation below to go with texture instead of temperature to decide when the sabayon was done. This dessert was loved by all.

I was introduced to this dish at a wonderful resturant," Au Chien Qui Fume" in Paris. I was so impressed that I raved about the dessert for the rest of my trip through Europe. Recently a friend sent me this recipe and reluctantly I gave it a try. It's fantastic! I followed the recipe carefully with only one substitution - I used Prosecco instead of the Raspberry liquor. I can't wait to serve it at my next dinner party. I know everyone will be as impressed as I was in Paris.

This was a disaster! I followed the instructions for making the sabayon to the letter. After 9 minutes of beating the mixture above barely simmering water, it reached 82 degrees. By 20 minutes, I had a bowl of toffee-colored gluey glop that wouldn't get warmer than 120 degrees. I threw it out and served the raspberries over ice cream. Later, I looked up the recipe for a classic sabayon sauce in one of Julia Child's books and learned that she says the sauce should never be so hot that you can't put your finger into it. I suppose this recipe has been adapted to make "safe sabayon" in this era of filthy farming and salmonella, but for me, anyhow, it was a dismal failure and a big disappointment.

Oh my God, this is so delicious. Simple and elegant. My guests were breathtaken and still talk about it. I used Chambord liqueur and it work out well. This is on my favorite recipes list!!!
