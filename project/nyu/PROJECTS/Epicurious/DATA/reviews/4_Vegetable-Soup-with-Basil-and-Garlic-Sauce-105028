This recipe is nothing less than "WOW" in my opinion. This soup is worthy of serving in a restaurant, at your next dinner party, or with some crusty bread and wine on a cold night. Here's what I did different from the recipe: 1. used low sodium chicken broth instead of water 2. used strips of pancetta (instead of chopped) so I could fish them out before serving 3. omitted the fennel, not available the day i went to the grocery store. You will not regret making this soup. Your family, including young children, will jump up and down and think you're a Super Mom. Enough said.

i thought this soup was just ok- almost too salty tasting. i found the veg soup with pistou to have a cleaner, fresher veggie taste for the same amount of work.

Delicious! I took the advice of many other reviewers and used chicken broth with water - made good sense. Used olive oil instead of bacon; added tomato paste to arrive at a good depth of flavor in a healthier way. I look forward to swapping out the veggies seasonally. The parm rind and pistou are not negotiable!

What a great way to use up our farmers' market vegetables. We substituted baby bok choy for the cabbage and turnip greens for the spinach. We also took other reviewers' suggestions and used chicken broth instead of water. Splendid.

Great soup. Clean and complex. The Pisou works with the broth beautifully.

Fabulous soup! I was worried it wouldn't have enough flavor but the cheese rind and thyme added just the right flavor. Plus the Pistou was amazing in the soup. Loved it. Added fresh corn to it also and dropped the potato. Served with naan. Yummy!

I got this recipe from another source that suggested making it with homemade vegetable stock instead of water. The results were great. The vegetable stock recipe used vegetables that were roasted first and the depth of flavor was amazing. Here is the stock recipe. ---------------- Vegetable Stock Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr serving size: Makes about 2 quarts. Ingredients 1/2 lb portabella mushrooms, caps and stems cut into 1-inch pieces 1 lb shallots, left unpeeled, quartered 1 lb carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 red bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces 6 fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs (including stems) 5 fresh thyme sprigs( can substitute dried thyme leaves if necessary) 4 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup dry white wine 2 bay leaves 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes 2 qt water + 1 cup Preparation Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss together mushrooms, shallots, carrots, bell peppers, parsley and thyme sprigs, garlic, and oil in a large flameproof roasting pan. Roast in middle of oven, turning occasionally, until vegetables are golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer vegetables with slotted spoon to a tall narrow 6-quart stockpot. Set roasting pan across 2 burners, then add wine and deglaze pan by boiling over moderate heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes. Transfer to stockpot and add bay leaves, tomatoes, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes. Pour through a large fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing on and discarding solids, then season with salt and pepper. Skim off fat. Cooks' note: " Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week, or frozen 3 months.

AMAZING - We absoulutely love this soup and have made it several times now. We have made a few changes though - chicken stock instead of water, and 2 rutabagas instead of turnip and potato. DO NOT LEAVE OFF THE PISTOU!!! The basil/garlic/cheese addition is delicious.

This soup is so versatile! I made it using what I had from a recent trip to the farmer's market (turnips with greens, carrots, potatoes, and fresh peas). The parmesan rind and pistou are essential. Also works with sausage instead of pancetta and chicken broth instead of water. A must have guide to vegetable soup for anyone trying to eat locally and in season.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe was written... and it was just OK. I think it needed more depth of flavor. I wish I had used stock instead of water. Or added tomatoes to the soup. But I certainly felt virtuous after eating all the vegies!

Very good soup. Had it for dinner on a damp Nov. evening with some yummy bread and cheese. Made for a very satisfying meal, though I might add some tomatoes to give the broth a brighter flavor next time. Very forgiving of veggie substitutions, but the cheese rind is essential.

What an amazing idea with the pistou!!!, I wish I had had that secret many years ago, changes I had to make due to what was around: broth was 8 cups water with one frozed (Christmas)ham bone, simmered for 2 hours, yeilded 2 cups ham chips, so omitted the need for bacon, added 2 cups chopped red onion, 3 med carrots, julienned with gadget(=2 minutes prep), 2 cups shredded raw coleslaw from bag, rind from Parm,2 chopped potatoes, sprigs thyme and savory, 2 cups chopped green beans, and one jar of homemade canned tomatoes (always worth taking time in fall to can them for amazing soups) and then the pistou, didn't have that much fresh basil around, so used two heaping tsp. pesto from a jar, so no blender, resulted in little chopping and little mess and this soup is the best...wish I had company now!!

This soup is delicious -- easy to make, only labor intensive portion is chopping. I, too, used chicken stock instead of water. I also added several more sprigs of thyme and an extra bay leaf. Because there was already enough flavor, I did not add the basil and garlic sauce to the soup.

Omitted the fennel, turnips, and lima beans. Substituted bacon for pancetta (kept some of the drippings), and homemade chix stock for the water. Delish! And good leftovers too.

I gave this recipe to a guest to make for our dinner group, and it was a huge hit. In fact, I need to make it myself now because I'm still craving it! He used chicken stock instead of water, and being short on time used a high-quality purchased pesto instead of the pistou. We topped it with croutons spread with a little goat cheese and baked until crisp. Fantastic! The pancetta and the parmesan rind add a richness that makes this soup - don't omit them.

This is a very delicioius, healthy soup. After chopping the veggies, it's a breeze. I used bacon, instead of pancetta, quart of chicken stock for part of the water, fordhook limas(what I had), no turnips(which I hate). I cook for a large group of people, and they all loved this soup.

I made this soup tonight, followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the bay leaf(didn't have one and didn't feel like a trip to Whole Foods to get one) we loved it! You must serve this soup with the pistou, it makes the soup!

One of my favorites. Here's my changes Mama Mia: Use thick cut bacon instead of pancetta (if hard to find). Also added a bit of the bacon runoff (2tsp) with the olive oil. Now that's heart smart. 2x the thyme, 8 cups water, 30 oz beans, 6-7 oz spinach, and skip the green beans. FOR THE PISTOU: 2 cups basil, 1/2-1 cup parmesan. Lastly, DO NOT go without the pistou or reggiano rinds or you'll miss the boat. Ciao.

Like some other reviewers, I found the recipe as written to be very bland....I used vegetable stock; maybe with chicken stock it would be tastier, also, to make it more appealing, I added fresh salsa and a dollop of sour cream.

This is a great soup. I made it with home made chicken stock rather than water.

I used a large can of chicken broth and 3c water and it was great. Even my winter basil made a good pistou. It was great without the pistou and parmesan too.

We fell in love with this recipe last May and made it all summer (2001). It is quite simple to make aside from the vegetable prep work. I am quite frankly surprised by the range of opinion here about this soup. It has wonderful flavor. I agree with the comments about how flexible the ingredients are. Just use what is fresh from the garden or stand that week.The flavors just sing of sunny Italy and Provence

This soup was mediocre at best. Very over rated here.

This was a good one for me to try because I usually don't care much for vegetable soups, but this one was pretty good. I didn't have any fennel left from my dinner party the other night so I put in a dash of ground fennel. I also chopped up fresh brussel sprouts in lieu of cabbage since that's what was in the fridge. This recipe allows for variation in veggies because the pancetta (I used bacon) gives so much flavor. I made the mistake of adding the pistou to the leftovers overnight and it overpowered the soup the next day. The next time I will keep them separate until serving for a fresh taste with each serving.

The pistou really makes this. It's so fresh and green tasting! The better vegetables you use, the better this soup will taste. I ate it for days happily, usually with parmesan cheese toasts on the side.

My impression about this soup is that what makes it so good is the base and the pisou. I used just what I already had at home to make this, which meant that I left out fennel bulb, turnips, cabbage, squash, potato, lima beans, cheese rind, and canellini. And yes, those are half the ingredients. But I added extra onion, celery, extra carrots, extra green beans, garbanzo beans, added a pinch of fennel seed (to replace the fennel bulb) used purchased pesto with a couple extra cloves of garlic added, and cooked with chicken broth instead of water. Added pesto and salt to tastse. I'm sure it sounds like my version is qualitatively different from the original, but I believe that the main flavor is probably still the same, and that was WONDERFUL. My husband, a vegetable lover, agreed.
