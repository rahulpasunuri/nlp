Outstanding! I added garlic to the mushrooms and shallot. Freezing the Brie definitely helped with removing the rind and cubeing it. Serving with thinly sliced grilled beef, potaotes, blanced asparagus and crusty bread cubes made a cheese fondue into a main course!

This has become my fallback fondue because I always know it will be a hit. Have never had a drop leftover. Works with everything from beef tips to bread to fruit.

It was delicious. I thought the blue cheese was a little strong, but my husband really liked it. I put the brie in the freezer for a few minutes and that made it easier to work with. Served with broccoli, cauliflower, bread, potatoes and the pear. The potatoes and pear were delish!

This was absolutely wonderful! I served it with apples, cauliflower and bread. Delicious!

This was wonderful, I was cautious about how much Roquefort I used and added to taste, I didn't think two ounces was too strong, I would recommend dicing the shitakie very fine in order to produce a better texture, I used a Chardonnay, but I think a drier more crisp white would have been even better. I serverd potatoes, multigrain bread, and granny smith apples, all were amazing.

the flavors are good, but the chunky texture of the mushrooms made it difficult to dip and get any mushroom. Next time I will chop them fine in a food processor. Pear was delicious in this, along with the bread and veggies.

This came out fabulous and was a huge hit at my party. I used more esoteric mushrooms (Chanterelle, Moucheron) and I finished it off with a nice generous drizzle of white truffle oil. Delicious!

I've made this fondue several times and I love it. I did have it turn out lump on one occasion (for no reason I can figure out) and had to run it through a blender to get the right consistency but wound up losing the different flavors from the mushrooms, roquefort, and so forth. As for removing the rind from the brie, try putting the cheese in the freezer for five minutes first -- makes a huge difference. Also, if you happen to have any leftovers, it makes for a GREAT omelette stuffer the next morning.

Very good. To my surprise, I liked it best with the steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Also good with apple slices and green grapes. A nice change from the usual cheese fondue. Cutting the rind off the brie is a bit of a pain though.

I doubled the recipe and served this at my quarterly wine tasting party with baby carrots, boiled fingerling potatoes, French bread, and steak bites. Everyone loved it. The flavor was nice, but I'm not convinced that it was so spectacular that it's worth the expense and trouble to make it again.

Happy New Year everyone.. Well I made this for our NYE party.. It was a party just for my wife and I. I followed the directions to the T and only added 4 cloves of Garlic. Top Notch recipe. I highly recommend it. I grilled a Med. rare center cut fillet and chilled it for a few hours slicing it to serve with the veggies and bread. Very very good..

Absolutely fantastic! I didn't find this *quite* as easy as some of the reviews might lead me to believe, but it was well worth it.

Wow! I served this as an appetizer at my last dinner party and my guests went crazy for it. I added a couple of more ounces of Roquefort to give it a stronger flavor because I wanted to serve it with grilled beef tips instead of bread. Turned out perfectly. The only problem was that the conversation practically came to a halt because we we couldn't stop dipping and eating!

The fondue base was excellent on its own, and also quite good once I added the mushrooms and shallot which I had previously neglected. I would however recommend following the instructions and remembering to saute the shallot to avoid a strong oniony flavor.

I have been making this for years and just made it twice in the last 2 weeks. What a hit! It's easy, elegant, and divine. Try it with baby purple potatoes that are precooked and split in half and with blanced asperagus.

This is the best fondue I've ever had...served it at a Golden Globe party and it was a huge success. One friend loved it so much he wouldn't let anyone near the pot!

I loved this recipe. I had a fondue party and made three types of fondue. This was by far everyone's favorite. I'm making it again this weekend for my parents. Additional Tips: Double the recipe and make sure you don't subsitute on the mushrooms - they made it.

You should double the recipe to start out.

Made this for a holiday party and everybody LOVED it! Next time I will use a milder bleu as I found it overpowered the brie a little. Also, I used button mushrooms for half of what was called for and it was delicioius. Already thinking of when I can make it next!

WOW! I actually do not like either mushrooms OR roquefort, but this was sensational. We had 5 fondues last night at our party, and this was the hit- honestly. go out on a limb and try it- it is a treasure. Perfect for the cold weather!

If I were to make this again I think I would use a more delicate wine - or use about half the amount. The one I used (I think it was a california chardonnay) seemed to overpower the other flavors.

I thought this recipe would be great-how wrong I was. I think the Roquefort cheese is way to strong. I made it for a party and no one ate it. They tried it and that was enough for them. Boy did I feel like a "chump".

This recipe was fabulous! What a hit for my monthly Gourmet Club, in fact I ate so much of it I barely had room for the leg of lamb. I would definitely make this again.

This was a great dish. I love that it was cooked in wine - I looked for a fondue specifically for that, and then served the same wine with dinner. I added a whole 7 or 8 oz. of Roquefort, which was too much! but it still was quite good in a tangy way. I served it with vegetables and bread, and it was well received. I didn't even have a fondue pot, but a pan in the middle of the table was more than sufficient.

We took some of several suggestions; our recommendations are: 3 cloves roasted garlic with the shallots and 6-7oz mixed wild and button mushrooms, 3oz Roquefort. We tried the beef, good, but the bread and vegetables are enough. Mild cilantro vinegarette on mixed greens; too much vinegar fights the cheese. Wine: Gustave Lorentz Reserve Gewurztraminer, medium dry with a nice spice was perfect. Finish with a simple apple tart with apricot glaze. Wonderful! Not a drop left.

Outstanding! I added more mushrooms. We dipped bread and beef. The mushrooms were a perfect complement to the beef. The flavors in the cheese exploded with the bread. We reduced the recipe to half since there were only 2 of us. We scraped the pot clean and wished we would have made the full recipe!!! It will definitely be enjoyed again!

I must say that this recipe is a special mix !! But ok, we need to be open minded to new things... My point is to correct the editor by approving the fact that fondue is originally from the French part of Switzerland, Gruyère exactly, BUT it is NOT made with Emmenthal or Appenzeller (this is the Swiss German version). The fondue is a mix of Gruyère and Fribourg Vacherin, a smooth yet very flavoured cheese made in the exact same village as the Gruyère. Mature Vacherin, which you could unfortunately not find anywhere else but in Switzerland, is the best. The reason why you cannot find good Vacherin is that it is made with non-pasteurised milk, which give it its beautiful tangy taste and melts like a dream. The locals also make an only Vacherin fondue usually done with a few drops of water instead of wine, it's my favourite but it is a bit heavy for a first timer ! Bon-appétit !

This fondue was the hit of the party, my only addition was roasting a head of garlic and adding the whole cloves to the mixture. Delicious!

Classic cheese fondue is wonderful, but this rich, smooth and distinctive version is far and away our family's favorite. Your guests will rave. We like strong cheeses so I add a little extra roquefort. Relatively sweet white wines seem to stand up to it best, and once the bowl has been scraped clean, I usually serve a mesclun salad (with honeydew melon vinaigrette) to refresh the tastebuds. Does anyone have a dessert suggestion for a meal as rich as this? We usually just serve coffee and liqueurs. There's a big storm heading for NYC this weekend--perfect excuse to stay in and make this!

We made this fondue with friends on a winter Saturday night and it was a big hit! I used a gourmet blend of 3 types mushrooms (crimini, shiitake and oyster)...delicious. A keeper for sure.

Great stuff! This was loved by everyone, and the fondue pot was scraped clean. A nice twist on the usual swiss cheese fare. Only complaint is the mushrooms tend to gather at the bottom of the pot as the meal progresses. Stir stir stir while eating.

This was a smash at our bi-monthly dinner club. Using it again for our next party! Forgot to rub the pot with garlic, but no one noticed....Strongly recommend Sourdough bread instead of french bread
