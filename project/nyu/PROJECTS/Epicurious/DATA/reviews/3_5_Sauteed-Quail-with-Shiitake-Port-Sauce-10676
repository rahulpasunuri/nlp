Excelence.

Even though I did not have all the ingredients called for I found this a wonderfully delicous recipe. I had no shitake mushrooms or port, just buttons and sherry, and certainly did not bone the quail. I even used rye flour for the dredging. The taste was fabulous and I can't wait to try the recipe again using all the proper ingredients.

I used roast game hens, same as the cook from Texas, but the sauce was simply too sweet for me. I may try this recipe again using wine instead of port to cut down on the sugar.

this was a great altenative to a turkey dinner for Thanksgiving. I used cornish game hens instead and roasted them whole, basted with broth and port and worstershire sauce. The sauce was wonderful, though to get it to a good thickness it reduced to less than 3/4 cup. fabulous flavor - like a five star restaurant. I paired it with a wild rice shitake stuffing from the Nov 2001 issue of Bon Appetit. The carmelized onions in the stuffing went nicely with the shitake port sauce

Delicious, but 1/2 cup of flour for dredging is plenty. I substituted porcini mushrooms for the shitake and we loved the earthy flavour they imparted to the dish.

I made this dish as a first course with a 'gourmet group'- it was great. I used 4-5 oz semi boneless quail - 1 per person. Less flour is needed. I browned them early in the day and then roasted them later for 20 minutes at 400. Served them with Risotto Cakes.

Delicious. Would make an elegant company meal. I used a red wine instead of the Port and only needed 1/2 cup flour for dredging four quail.
