I have made this recipe 2-3 times and each time it has turned out great! It has such a homey taste (at least for me who grew up eating a semi Chinese household). I also use fatty ground pork in place of the ground pork butt and the meatballs still turn out very well. Highly recommended!

This recipe is pretty authentic. I add a pack of firm tofu to the ground pork mixture and add a little bit of dried shrimp to the broth. It turned out delicious and have made it a million times since.

Simple, satisfying. Changes? Added sliced fresh shiitake (abt 12oz), both napa and baby bok choy. When the ginger is added to the stir fry of cabbage I added 5 cloves of garlic microplaned. I omitted the water chestnuts (don't like them). To the stock (used homemade) in the braise I added white pepper, black pepper and some soy. Serve with sriracha on the side for the hotheads.

this was very labor intensive. The dish was good, but I won't make it again. I would order it at restaurant.

This recipe turned out delicious. I substituted ground pork butt with 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 super fatty ground pork. And instead of peanut oil I just used EVOL. I also divided it into 8 meatballs instead of 4 gigantic ones. I really love how the cabbage that's on the bottom just melts in your mouth with it's sweet aroma. I will definitely make this again. I think it'd be good too with a few of those small dried shrimp thrown in.

This totally reminded me of what my mother used to make when I was a kid. I'd recommend using Napa cabbage if possibly mainly because the sweetness of the cabbage is essential for the flavor of the broth. The only thing I would do differently is probably make it a day ahead. The dish came out a bit greasy from the pork and it would have been nice to have let it sit in the fridge overnight in order to skim the fat off it.

Great meal. My husband loved it, will definetly make it again. I served this with rice noodles stir fried with shrimp using the drippings from the meatballs. I also made eight meatballs as opposed to four, this made them easier to turn a took.

Just great. I didn't use the mushrooms (can't stand them) and still loved it. Make sure and use ground pork butt, the texture was amazing.

This dish was fabulous! I added a little bit of 5 spice powder to the meatballs and felt that added depth to the taste.

This soup is so incredibly deelish that I'm reviewing it in spite of the new awful format for submitting reviews. I've been making this soup since a similar recipe appeared in Gourmet in October 1996. It was super without the shiitakes and bok choy instead of cabbage, but the addition of shiitake mushrooms takes it from 3 to 4 forks. I'm staying with the bok choy though.

This is one of the best Chinese recipe that represents the Chinese comfort food. It can be used both for family dinners and formal parties.

This is one of the most fabulous dishes I've ever made. I did not use the chicken broth but added a little soy sauce and sesame oil to the shiitake mushroom broth. A little messy to make but worth it. My family loved it, even the little ones. I used it as a 1st course. Can't be beat for Thai food.

When i made this i skipped the step with the cornstarch and i used bok choy instead of napa because that is what i had on hand. The prep time was more like 30-40 minutes and very simple; the length of these instructions makes the recipe seem fussier than it is. The flavour was very nice, similar to wontons. This would make a good winter meal.
