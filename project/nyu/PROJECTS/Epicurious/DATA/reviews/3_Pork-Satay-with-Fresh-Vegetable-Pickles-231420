Too salty and fishy. Perhaps I need advice on what kind of fish sauce to buy. It was edible but not something I will make again.

Delicious and quick. Instead of the metal skewers, I used bamboo which made cleaning a breeze. I will use less fish sauce next time, since it seems to overwhelm the dish.

Great recipe, I added more garlic than neccessary, but I thought it was fine.

Followed the recipe to the letter and we thought it was a bit boring. It seems to need something to punch it up - more garlic, some freshly grated ginger, red pepper and some sweetening, maybe honey or brown sugar.
