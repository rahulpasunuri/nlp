What a horrific waste of a great piece of beef. Made this for Thanksgiving guests and was completely underwhelmed. Had a hard time keeping the bacon wrapped and while the stuffing had good flavor the beef itself was bland. Wouldn't make again.

I've tried lots of recipes here and am generally pleased, but I have to agree with others, this one was disappointing. Followed it exactly except I added thyme and rosemary to the stuffing based on other reviews. I used a 3.25 lb tenderloin and had to cook it maybe 10 minutes longer. Beef was tender and perfectly medium rare, but overall lacked the wow factor to make it worth the price. Next time I want a special occasion beef dinner I'll make the Herbed Rib Roast (Gourmet, Dec. 2000) founder here I made last Christmas - everyone still raves about it! If you love the simple beefy taste of tenerdloin then you might like this recipe, but if you prefer beef with more flavor than skip it. 2 stars for easy recipe, though getting the bacon to stay wrapped while frying takes some effort.

Great dish, but to jazz it up a bit, I added sauted minced shallots and wild mushrooms to the stuffing.

It was good but not great. I used a rub on the meat before wrapping it in bacon, I should of just salt and peppered it. Most of the bacon fell off when I cut it so the presentation wasn't as beautiful like the picture. My guests enjoyed it.

This recipe yields impressive results. I added fresh thyme and rosemary to the stuffing and served this with a decadent red wine sauce made with demi-glace and this was a perfect holiday meal for guests.

I've been wanting to make this since Dec. 2004! Finally did and we were not disappointed. Bought a small 2.5 pounder for myself and 3 peeps and we had a good 5 slices left over. Made the potatoes w/o truffles that go with this menu and they were fabulous as well!

This was the hit of Chrismas Dinner. I bought a whole tenderloin and cut the center myself. I also put a rub on the meat before wrapping in the bacon. Made it the night before and put in fridge. Laid out for 1 hour prior to cooking. It was perfect and just delish! Going to use the tail of the tenderloin for another recipe.

Mine didn't look that pretty, and wrapping the bacon around such a large cut of meat was difficult. It tasted amazing though.

Made this for a dinner party this past December. Bacon was great addition, not greasy at all. The entire 8 pound roast was gobbled up. A different twist on a tenderloin roast.

Yes, I have used recipes for pork or beef tenderloin interchangeably and this one particluarly would be quite good with a pork roast.

Stunning presentation and great flavor. I made for a family birthday party and everyone was impressed. I used thinly sliced bacon and sauteed longer than recommended to ensure bacon would be crispy (per the complaints by a few reviewers.) I also used a rub prior to wrapping in bacon as a reviewer recommended. Will definitely make again, although with a different cut of meat. The flavors were good overall but I think a little more fat in the meat would help.

This was soooo easy to prepare ahead of time. I stuffed and wrapped tenderloin in bacon and chilled in frig. Took out 1 hr before to bring to room temp. Seared on top of stove and popped in oven. Everyone loved it so much, had to make again the next week!

I made this for my family's Christmas celebration and people could not stop raving about it. The herb stuffing was excellent, but I did add a little thyme that I had left over, but it smelled wonderful even befor that. Make sure the bacon you use is thin. I bought thick and it did not cook up enough for my liking and people just pretty much took it off and discarded it. It did however impart a wonderful flavor to the meat. Everything came out tender and delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I've made this three times and got it perfect on the third attempt. First, use only 1 - 1.5 cups of bread crumbs. Second, add more herbs - I add thyme, ginger and rosemary to the stuffing and then prepare a beef rub for the exterior consisting of olive oil, pepper, salt, basil, sage, paparika and garlic. This slight adjustments truly add to the flavor.

I made this last xmas exactly to the recipe and no one really liked it. (A few tears of disappointment were actually shed.) The presentation was lovely, the stuffing was very tasty, but the overall flavor just wasn't there. I decided I would never again prepare beef tenderloin--it's so bland. But, if you value tenderness above all else (including flavor) in your beef, this is the best tenderloin I've had. My bacon must've been thicker than it should've been because the inside of it was smushy and gross, but it did add some flavor to the bland cut of beef and looked pretty. Be sure to use really thin slices when you make this so that it cooks better.

Great recipe. I just made it for a small dinner party. It got rave reviews from everyone. I would definately make it again. I made one roast of about 3 lbs. I halved the stuffing recipe and had a ton left over. I froze it to be used in something down the road...

This was a fantastic meal! I bought Chateau Briand so it was one solid piece of meat and it made the wrapping much easier. I made half the stuffing per the suggestion of others' comments and still had some to spare. I substituted fresh, finely chopped rosemary and thyme for the parsley. It added a very nice flavor to the meat.

This is a delicious dish. I made it during a weekend away at a cabin. Easy to make and looked and tasted great. I agree that the recipe called for too much stuffing. I had tons left over, even though I had a rather large tenderloin. I would definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and was greatly rewarded! The tenderloin came out perfectly and all my guests raved about it! This is one of the best dishes I have ever made. Only thing I would suggest is less breadcrumbs. I had about 1 1/2 cups left over.

I served this for Christmas dinner, due to the high price of the meat, it should only be used for special events. Got rave reviews for all guests, there was not any left overs as everyone ate every crumb on their plates. Did not think it was too salty. Just right!

I was not impressed with this recipe. It was very heavy and the bacon made it so fatty. The entire tenderloin could use salting, inside and out, not just on the inside like it called for. I really wanted to like it more, but it just came out ok.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS, although the meat was quite pricey. My wife and I loved the recipe. Although, I could not figure out why I had extra stuffing and when I cut the meat, the stuffing fell out. Also, brown the meat in a large saucepan. It will reduce grease splatter and allow the roast to lean against something when beowning the smaller sides.

This gets 3 forks because the first time I made it, it was a fabulous 4-forker, and the second time it was worth only 2 forks. The first time, I made it with a full tenderloin, as called for in the recipe, and it was sublime. The second time around, I tried using a lesser cut (a large top round, if I remember correctly) because the meat that's called for is rather pricey. BIG mistake: don't bother making this dish with anything but tenderloin. Yes, it's expensive, but honestly, using anything but the tenderloin results in a very chewy piece of meat, which was a shame, since we loved it the first time around. My fault, and I learned my lesson! In any case, when you make it, try adding some finely chopped rosemary to the stuffing. An excellent accompaniment is the Pommes Anna from this site.

I enjoyed this recipe but thought it needed something. I used the same pan to brown the roast and make the stuffing. Then I sauted mushrooms in the pan and added a bit of sherry and poured that over the roast when I served it.

for cook from Chicago: try rosemary and thyme instead of parsley. This a version of an old recipe from Argentina, I think. Very easy, tasty, well accepted by everybody. Make it in advance and serve the cold cuts for breakfast or brunch: a winner

I haven't made it so I'm not rating it, just responding to "Cook from Chicago" who wants to know what to substitute for parsley since the spouse won't eat it....personally, I'd sustitute the spouse. But if that's not an option, make it with the parsley AND DON'T TELL!!

This is good. I make it with a pork tenderloin and stuff it with a paste made of garlic, gorgonzola cheese, black pepper and chopped rosemary. Bon app!

A very easy recipe to make with great flavor. Make sure to tie the roast well so as to insure that the bacon will not fall off when being browned in the pan. I served it with a red wine reduction suace made from the pan drippings while the roast rested, and everyone felt it add considerably more depth to the dish.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, the only change I made was to use Prosciutto instead of Bacon. It turned out fantastic! Big on flavor, most definitely. I agree with a previous reviewer that the recipe makes too much stuffing though, any ideas for what to do with the leftover stuffing that isn't used in the recipe? Next time I may halve the stuffing.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Don't be intimidated. It holds together and carves easily, provided you tie it well and handle it with care. My roast (about 3.5lb) was very long so it didn't fit in a fry pan to brown before roasting, but it still cooked perfectly. The stuffing recipes makes a ton, you can easily cut it back and add more fresh herbs to jazz it up. I thought the bacon would add adequate salt, but if making it again I would season the beef before wrapping in bacon.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was outstanding. The stuffing had great flavor and the bacon gave the meat a smokey flavor. It was very good. The only problem was getting the meat cut in a way that the bacon and stuffing stayed in place and didn't fall out. I also found that it took longer to cook then the direction indicated. We like very rare meat and it still took about 30 minutes longer to cook.

Rating: 4
Very tasty. I definitely recommend halving the stuffing recipe. I made one tenderloin, halved the stuffing, and still had way too much. The bacon was a nice touch, although I needed twice as much of that - a result of overstuffing, I think. The frying made the bacon crisp, and was a nice touch. I only left mine in for 20 mins, as I prefer it more rare than not. This carves beautifully, and tastes divine.

We really enjoyed this. We used only one tenderloin, and even halving the stuffing mixture left us with leftovers, which we plan to use for Shrimp de Jonghe!

I dont get it. I cook, very well thank you, and I found the stuffing to be horribly lacking in flavor and complexities. The bacon destroyed the delicate flavors of an oven roasted beef tenderloin, the only thing browning did was make the house smell like a breakfast diner. A total waste of time, meat and taste buds. Save the time and grill the tenderloin over an open pit of mesquite and apple wood. Toss back a BIG cab. and enjoy the way meat was supposed to be prepared, simply delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe. I had never cooked this cut of beef before (very pricey) and served Christmas dinner. No one could stop talking about it, and eating it! The presentation is great and the flavor is awesome. I too made the mistake of getting one tenderloin and just cutting in half. I took almost twice as long to cook but had some rare and some well done pieces to suit everyone at the table. I too will cut the dressing in half as I had trouble closing the roast and wrapping the bacon all around. Defineatly a keeper, once you can afford the piece of meat!

I love beef tenderloin, and find it supurb no matter how you prepare it. So, I am constantly looking for a way to "wow" guests w/ a tenderloin recipe. This recipe was very salty, and I wasn't that impressed with the overall flavor. My guests liked it, but I wasn't impressed. Not bad, but I was expecting much more.

I made this for a holiday dinner and it was a big hit. The flavor of this was amazing! The bacon added an incredible smokey flavor and the meat was tender and moist. The bacon that I got was too thick which made wrapping the tenderloin extremely difficult. Also, I got one relatively large tenderloin instead of two which didn't help matters. I ended up draping the bacon over the tenderloin securing it with toothpicks. I did not brown the tenderloin, I simple placed it in the oven. Also, the stuffing recipe was too much and the tenderloin was difficult to close...next time I will cut the stuffing ingredients in half! I took it out of the oven when the thermometer reached 119F, covered it with foil and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. My guests could not stop raving about this entree!
