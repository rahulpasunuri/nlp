I found this recipe to be way too sweet, and I didn't even add all of the honey. This was an okay recipe for me. If you really like sweets for dinner, you might like it more than I did.

Very pleased with this recipe. Couldn't find shallots and didn't have any port, so I made it with 1 lb of small sweet onions, roughly chopped (I think there were cippolini), and 1/3 c of bourbon. I also used baby carrots, and made the whole thing in a dutch oven. Served as a side dish to my bourbon pecan chicken, and the flavors worked really well together. My new favorite way to make carrots. I hope to try it with the shallots next time.

I'm giving this four forks because it's tough to find a carrot dish that wows people. This dish is simple but packs two big punches: first, the non-chopped shallots (unusual) and second, the white port (also not usual). Very good combination of flavours. I cut the dill and chives and then like an idiot forgot to add them after. Will make sure to do that next time.

I had to use red rather than white wine port, but still ended up with a lovely, thick, sweet caramel like glaze on the carrots. My girlfriend just cant get enough of the onions. Definitely making this one again

I'm not sure how long it would take to boil more than a quart of liquids down to 3 tbsps. This recipe didn't work.

Made mostly as directed but with vegetable broth and baby carrots. Will watch the pan as the glaze boils down more closely next time as it went suddenly from very liquidy to a dark glaze that was sticking to the pan. My husband loved them and wants them for Thanksgiving dinner.

This recipe is delicious - I've made it for Christmas dinner the past couple years and love it every time. The flavour really permeates the carrots and shallots. I use sherry instead of port.

Very Tasty! Used Brandy because that is what I had on hand and it worked wonderfully. Will definitely try it with the Port next time to see what they are *supposed* to taste like, but my experiment worked too.

My boyfriend's elderly mother--who won't touch most of what I cook b/c it's too "newfangled," absolutely loved these--and consequently loves me all the more! They really are perfect and I plan to wow at Thanksgiving with them. As per others' suggestions, I did not add fresh herbs and really didn't feel the dish was missing a thing. Also, used some Jack Daniels instead of port b/c I already had it on hand. Bravo!

This was delicious--my neighbor who said she doesn't like cooked carrots loved it. The port really makes the dish. I used a tawny port, which worked fine--just gave it a bit more color. I didn't have the herbs on hand, either, but we still really enjoyed the dish.

I used bourbon instead of port and used extra honey--yummy!

Just made this for the third time and continue to find it appealing. Agree that the chives/dill add little.

This is delicious! And it is also very healthful, which makes it an absolute keeper in my book. I might increase the port and the honey to make it sweeter and more intensely flavored, but it is still quite good as it is.

The recipe was a little light on honey flavor. I think glazed carrots should have a pretty sweet glaze, so I doubled the honey. I also substituted a nice fino sherry instead of white port, which worked well. The dill and chives look nice, but don't add much flavor. Unless you have some on hand, I'd say don't bother with them. I'd suggest shredded parmesan cheese instead.

I...I am the FIRST to rate this recipe. Bow down before me, Honey-Glazed Carrots and Shallots, I am your MASTER...First impressions are DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME--THY READERS SHALL BE STUNNED BY MY SEVERE AUTHORITY. That said, use a bit more salt, and throw in another shallot or two.
