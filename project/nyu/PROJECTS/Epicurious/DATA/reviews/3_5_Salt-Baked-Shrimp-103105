I love Salt Baked Shrimp and was delighted to find a recipe for it here on epicurious. I did find that it needed a little modification to make the shrimp as salty and crusty as I've had in restaurants. Follow this link to see my blog post (at http://betweencourses.blogspot.com) on how to adapt this recipe, as well as some sides to accompany it: http://betweencourses.blogspot.com/2008/11/from-mirandas-kitchen-salt-baked-shrimp.html

We have been trying to recreate "shrimp in spicy shell" from our sadly defunct favorite chinese restaurant. With the addition of a quarter teaspoon of cayenne and ground white pepper and some garlic powder to the cornstarch, we hit the mark! By doing this you can eliminate the stir fry at the end and still attain the Szechuan spiciness with simply deep frying for a minute longer. I have made it according to the recipe, and then modified. Both are good, one is shorter and better for the Szechuan effect.

I wanted to make this dish because it's my favorite at a local Chinese restaurant. I followed the recipe precisely and thought it was delicious, but some of the shrimp had a bitter flavor. Maybe from the baking soda? I'd want to figure out why before I made the dish again.

The heat was perfect for my South Western Palate. This is served in many Chinese restaurants here.I love it.

Great recipe!!! I did not find it to spicy at all but for who do minced scallions in place of the peppers makes a wonderful subsitute.

This is a wonderful dish. I agree with another's comment that it is a little hot for western taste, but this is such an easy receipe (I do have a deep fat fryer) I will serve it frequently, as it is exotic enough to impress company as an appetizer or main dish.

I served this dish to my husband and he responded with kudos and compliments. However he advised that it was a bit spicy for Western palates and tasted great on a bed of chinese style fried rice. I suggest that it be served for special occasions only.
