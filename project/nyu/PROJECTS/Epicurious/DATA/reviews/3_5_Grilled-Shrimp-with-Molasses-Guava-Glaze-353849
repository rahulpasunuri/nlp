I was really dissapointed with this recipe. It sounded really good but the sauce ended up being WAY too strong.

For some reason, my mind converted light molasses into light corn syrup, so I went with it. Also substituted pear jelly for the sweet and lemon for the lime. Initially, I thought it was non existant for taste. After the cooked shrimp sat for a few hours in the frige, the pear flavor emerged and was fabulous as a first course with Ch St. Michelle Champage Blanc de blanc. A happy way to enjoy the Academy Awards show.

Great. I used apricot jam and cane syrup and added some blueberries and a dash of cayenne pepper. Grilled on a cast iron griddle. My guests loved it.

I really wasn't crazy about this recipe. Maybe it was because I made them on the stove instead of on the grill because I live in an apartment, but I don't think so. Something was just off with the flavor.

Very good and very easy to make. I used apricot jam. I also squeezed in the juice from the lime I used for the peel. The recipe can also easily be halved. We did not have grill skewers, so I just cooked them in our grill vegetable basket, which worked well.

I made this recipe as part of a cook-out with other items. We ate it as an appetizer and everyone raved about it. I thought the marinade was too sweet, so I squeezed in the juice of one lime and added some garlic powder. Worked out well. I also used olive oil, not butter. I used regular Grandma's molasses, not sure what "mild-flavored" is, but, again, it worked out fine. Everyone loved the shrimp. Will most definitely make again.

I thought this was awfully sweet and just not savory enough. Good, but not great.

I used guava jelly since I was not able to find the jam version. I increased the jelly to 6 T and used 3 T of full strength molasses since that is what I had in my pantry. I served these as appetizer putting 2 on a 1/2 wooden skewer. My guests enjoyed and several asked for the recipe - which is always a good sign. Bon Appétit!

Amazing! I made this for a BBQ on Saturday evening and it was a BIG hit. I used Apricot jam and added about another 2 Tbsp to balance out the flavor of the molasses (I only had yellow-label Grandma's). Just make sure that the BBQ temperature is med-high so that the glaze will carmelize while you cook the shrimp. Definitely a keeper for my recipe box!!!
