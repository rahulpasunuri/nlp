Excellent! Made for Xmas 2012. Bought a 9 pound for 6 people-way too much meat. Should've done 6 or 5 pound. Gravy was killer--I took the advice of others and bought Veal Demi-Glace from Williams-Sonoma and it was outstanding. I used about 1.5 oz glace in 1 cup water to equal 3 cups stock and then reduced 1 cup red wine (cabernet) to about 3/4 cup. It was outstanding. Also doubled the dijon, added horseradish to rub.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. And, it's very easy to prepare. I found that taking the meat out of the oven at 125 degrees was too rare so I suggest 128 to 130 degrees for medium rare. Make sure that beef is at room temp before it goes in the oven. The meat is very rich so I made an au jus instead of the roux based gravy. I deglazed the pan with 1 cup red wine and added the Zinfendel beef stock and reduced in half.

I ended up making a 4.5lb roast (only had 6 at the table). It was delicious and easy to prepare. What really made it was the sauce. A bit time consuming, but worth every beautiful dark brown drop. Good gravy!

Made this for Christmas dinner and served on top of mashed potatoes. It was a big hit with my guests. The beef was very tender, however I didn't think the flavors of the herbs and mustard came through as much as I would have hoped. The meat marinated with the rub for about 15 hours before cooking. I added the vegetables when the meat temperature hit 100 and then cooked the meat until 135. The vegetables were perfect. As many others suggested, I mixed a Zinfandel wine reduction with purchased veal demi-glace. The sauce was very rich and flavorful.

Bought a boneless eight pounder for this recipe. Used Wegman's own brand of beef stock (that I simmered for about an hour with the parsley, thyme and peppercorns before straining). I cooked it to an internal temp of 137 degrees F for a more medium cooked meat. It was so tasty and juicy! If I hadn't cooked so much other food, I'm sure my guests would've gone back for seconds. There were rave reviews all over and the level of juiciness was unreal! I had the roast on a carving station board under the light and had to keep paper towels hands as the juice wasn't always contained on the board while slicing!! Can't wait to make this again next year!

Absolutely fantastic! I made this for a Christmas dinner party and it was a hit. I roasted the vegetables in a a separate dish because they did not fit in my roasting pan. Just used some of the drippings from the roast to coat. I bought a pre-made veal demi glace and added some reduced wine, which was perfect. Will definitely make this again!

OMG, have now made this recipe countless times, it has become my staple preparation for rib roast. As for the rub, I always add minced garlic(approx.3-4 cloves), and mix it together with the mustard,rosemary and thyme. After applying the rub to the roast I then put it in a x-large ziploc bag and leave marinate at least 24hrs. AMAZING. The simple "jus" that seeps from the roast with the first slice is heavan alone, never mind the gravy.

I made this recipe Christmas Eve. I did take the time to make the zinfandel stock the night before and made the sauce. It was good, but honestly, not as good as a reduction or mushroom wine sauce. I also felt the mustard competed with the wine sauce. This was good, not great. My guests all raved. I'm the picky one.

Incredible taste! I took the time to make the sauce and the taste was unbelievable. I added garlic to the seasoning and cut tiny holes in the roast and inserted small pieces of garlic. This dinner is my new Christmas tradition.

I grill a standing rib roast for a group of friends every year and tried this recipe for the first time this year. I combined the ingredients for the herb crust with another recipe I like so I doubled the amount of dijon mustard to 1/2 cup and added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 2TB of horseradish while keeping the same amount of herbs. This got rave reviews all around but the star of show was the zinfandel sauce. It's very easy to prepare and so, so savory. Our guests are still talking about how good it was. This is on my 'must make again' list

Made for Christmas dinner. Good simple, yet elegant recipe. The root vegetables did not cook in the time listed in the recipe and since you add them when the temp is only 325, they did not brown. Zinfadel sauce was a big hit.

This is a wonderful recipe. DEFINITELY invest the time to make the stock. I made this for my parents and aunt/uncle when they came for Christmas last year, and my mom and aunt (both of whom are gourmet cooks) said the gravy was the best they had ever had. I will make this every time for Christmas.

This was delicious and very easy because I used store bought demi- glace to make the sauce. Next time I'll prepare ahead and make the stock as well, so I can see if it is worth the extra time and effort. I think prepared demi-glace is a great product; I use it frequently with reliable results.

Easy and delicious. I used more mustard and herbs than called for, skipped the zinfandel stock recipe and instead mixed 1 cup of red zin with high quality beef stock to make the gravy (with good results). I also threw in some sweet potatoes in with the carrots and shallots. Also served with a mix of horseradish and sour cream on the side. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it's really fabulous. The herb crust is delicious. I followed the cooking instructions exactly, except that we took our 10 1/2 lb roast out of the oven when the internal temp was 130. Let it rest about 20 minutes. Absolutely perfect, medium rare beef. Everyone raved. This is a keeper. I'll definitely make it again. Served with potato gratin, yorkshire puddings and a lovely green salad.

Made this for a Boxing Day family dinner for 14 including young and old and it was delicious, even had non vegetable eaters raving about the carrots. I made the Dijon and chopped herbs into a paste and covered beef with it-easier than doing separately. I also used a high quality premade beef stock to make gravy.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for New Year's Eve dinner, and all 12 guests were raving about it. I used a boneless tenderloin instead of rib roast, and the only problem was that not enough juices were expelled during the roasting to coat the vegetables. The zinfandel beef stock is fantastic even with canned stock (no need to make your own). I served it with creamed spinach and "Polenta with Shiitake Mushroom Ragout" (from this site).

I've made this recipe twice - once with a three-rib roast and once with the ribs removed. Both times it came out excellent. Only used the Zinfandel Stock sauce once and it wasn't that great. But the dijon-rosemary-thyme crust was a huge hit. If anything, I think some horseradish on the side wouldn've helped, but we like things on the spicier side.

Everyone in our family enjoyed this. How thick should it be sliced? We really liked the dijon-rosemary-thyme crust.

This dish was a big hit on Christmas Eve. I bought a 5 rib roast for our party of 11 and we only had a couple of slices left over. I don't really see the point of all the herbs and dijon on the top. Didn't seem to flavor the meat at all, and since you don't use the drippings to make the gravy, you don't get the flavor there. There was plenty of fat that could have been used to make Yorkshire pudding, for those of you who enjoy that decadent treat! I wouldn't bother with the zinfandel stock recipe. I made it and found the gravy very blah. Certainly not worth the expense or effort. I think a traditional gravy made from the drippings would have been better.

A tradition for many years in our family has been standing rib roast dinner on Christmas Eve. This is the best yet! The herb crust is magnificent and very easy to do. Instead of the zinfandel gravy, I made Yorkshire pudding with the drippings, which were also herb infused...excellent! In addition, I studded the whole roast with slivers of fresh garlic. The roasted vegetables rounded out the the whole presentation. My family raved and raved. Definitely a keeper in my recipe file!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderful! It's an easy recipe and I put it on the roast the night before. It looked so good that it should have been on the cover of a magazine! The taste was so wonderful that I am using this recipe on my leg of lamb for christmas dinner. YUM!!!

I have made this for Christmas the past 2 years and am seriously considering it for this year (I'm looking at 16 people for Xmas this year!).

I have to admit I was a bit leary to put mustard on such a wonderful cut of beef. In the past, I have made prime rib the way "my Mom" used to. This recipe is beyond compare and well worth the time. The sauce that it is paired with this is absolutely amazing (and I don't like gravy). I made this for a group of friends and everyone raved!

My husband said it was the best roast he ever tasted and I agree with him. I believe beef and garlic go hand-in-hand and added roasted garlic to the dijon mustard mixture and raw garlic to the stock. It was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try the dijon mixture on steaks on the grill.

Made this with a 4.5-lb. rib roast, which cut the roasting time down to about 100 minuntes, or a bit more. Roast came out juicy and tender, medium-rare. As suggested by others, I marinated the meat in the salt, pepper, dijon mustard, rosemary and thyme overnight. Made the gravy with beef broth instead of demiglace and cabernet instead of Zinfandel, but it still turned out pretty well. Everyone had seconds. Great recipe, very flexible, very easy.

Fantastic. Tender and flavorful. The herb crust is to die for. Definitely do the veggies--they're easy and my guests inhaled them. Making stock for this recipe seemed like a lot of work for one meal, and just for gravy at that! Jeesh! Buy demiglace and save the time. Or, if you've got to make stock, make lots so you have it for multiple recipes. I made a basic beef stock the week before and froze it. Then for this recipe, I took took 4 cups of the basic stock and reduced it with a cup of red wine for a couple hours. Then I made the pan gravy per the recipe. Very tasty.

My first time ever cooking a rib roast and it was great. Took the advise of previous reviewers and skipped the sauce and veggies. It's wonderful on its own!

Rating: 4
Excellent. The crust was great but the real winner is the sauce. I made the stock from scratch and highly recommend it. I'm afraid the sauce would be greatly inferior with bullion of any sort versus the stock - the bone marrow and sheath adds a richness that just can be captured in a bullion. Not to mention the reduction is what takes a lot of the time and you need to do that anyway to get the concentrated flavor.

Rating: 3
Very impressive. I served this to a bunch of foodies and while they loved the roast itself, the gravy garnered the rave reviews. Granted, the making the beef stock requires time and some advance planning, but stock is so simple to make and produces a far superior result. I was more generous with the mustard, thyme and rosemary and the kitchen was full of a glorious aroma while the roast was in the oven. Definitely worth repeating.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and easily adaptable to a very low sodium version. I skipped the mustard and salt all together and used Herbes de Provence and pepper for a crust on the beef. The homemade stock did take time but I used oxtails for the bones and it was delicious with no salt added there, either. Everyone enjoyed it and didn't seem to miss the salt.

Made this on Christmas Day and it was outstanding!!! A definite keeper. Used a 4 lb roast so cooking time was a lot shorter. Meat came out really tender and flavorful. Added garlic to the seasoning crust. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a really good beef bouillon or demiglace, water + hearty red wine to make the 'zinfandel' beef stock for the gravy. It was a tasty complement to the meat and took approx 15 min. After reading mixed reviews on the beef stock, would not try to do itfrom scratch as I am not sure it would be worth the effort.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner lastnight. Everyone raved about it. I prepared the stock 2 days in advance. It tasted like a glorified gravy. If I were to spend the time to do this sauce again, I would not add the butter and flour, I would serve it more like an Au jus. The beef was incredibly tender. I marninaded it overnight and let it stand at room temp. for two hours prior to cooking it. I added more seasoning(plus garlic) than the recipe called for, because the crust is really your main source of seasoning. Overall, great dish!

I made this roast for Christmas dinner last year to rave reviews and my family has requested it again this year. Instead of making the beef stock from scratch, I purchased a good beef demi-glace and made the stock using that with zinfandel. It saves a lot of time and really works.

I made this for the second time in several weeks, today and once again, it was delicious. I don't bother with the sauce. the roast is so flavorful and juicy that a sauce is superfluous. I didn't even add the veggies this time. I found cooking it to 125 degrees was plenty rare for us, and we love our beef rare. Both time, I made it for just my husband and myself, and for leftovers. So with a 3 1/2 lb. roast the cooking time was much shorter. Great! I'll definitely make it again, and again.

Made this tonight as a special dinner...used a black angus rib roast and served with garlic mashed potatoes and some outstanding red wines. Everything was great. The zinfindel stock is a lot of work...must be made at least a day ahead. The gravy was yummy, but if stock is not prepared ahead of time, can't imagine it would not be worth the effort...the stock is a half day affair on its own.

Well, we only had 4 people so we had a two rib roast and our neighbors were only 2 people, also with a 2 rib roast (approx 3 12/ pounds)and both of ours were over-cooked. For those of you who have a small group and a smaller piece of meat, we determined 20/25 minutes per pound would be right. My meat gage was way off. The stock and crust still work well with a smaller amount, just don't over cook it!.

The rib roast was a smashing success for Christmas dinner. I used the same recipe for a 7 lb roast and the temp was medium rare. I was fortunate enough to have a beautiful cut of meat. We let the roast sit in the oven (temp turned off) a little while longer while we were finishing up a visit with family. The zinfandel sauce was great; although, it did taste like a tasty stew to me.

I LOVED the zinfandel sauce and thought the roast was also quite good. I agree that it was pretty rare for my tastes, though. Also, the recipe called for (I think) 9 lbs. - I bought a 6 lb. roast b/c 9 seemed HUGE and it fed 10 people easily.

My Mother and I recreated the entire Bon Appetit Dec. 2003 Holiday meal for Christmas Eve dinner. It was phenomenal. We halved the recipe and still had days of leftovers waiting for us. For the two of use, we had a 5lb, bone-in roast. I took it out at 120 deg. F. This gave us a roast that was med. rare to rare throughout, with consistent doneness throughout. The entire menu from BA 12/03 was phenomenal.

I also had virtually no drippings - when I checked the roast I added some red wine as liquid for the veggies. I didn't make the beef stock recipe noted with the recipe, but some of my own and a little red wine as part of the liquid. I found the rosemary overpowering, and didn't like the taste in the gravy. I would make this again, but without the rosemary, and maybe trying a few different herbs. The mustard added a great flavour, and smelled fantasic when cooking.
