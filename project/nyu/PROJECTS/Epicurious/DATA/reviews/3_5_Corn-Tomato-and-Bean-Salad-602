Used thawed, frozen corn and a can of white beans. The texture was soft, soggy and unpleasant. I definitely would NOT make this again without using fresh ingredients.

Here are my thoughts to make this a more spectacular salad the kids love. I added two cups of chopped english cucumber (one whole cucumber, peeled); add 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint; Also, I used kidney beans rather than pinto. This is great when paired with the "Rotini and Black Bean Salad" (with the changes I made to it under the reviews).

This was a nice salad, but nothing spectacular. I think I'll try a different recipe for a corn-based salad next time. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but it just wasn't to my taste, I guess.

Yummy! As someone else said, this is dramatically more than the sum of its parts. I used frozen white corn, canned pinto beans, and quartered cherry tomatoes, and it was still delicious. I will definitely make again this summer when corn and tomatoes are in season. We ate this as a vegetarian main dish with soup, and it was plenty.

I tried making this two different ways: 1. Beans and corn from cans vs. Fresh beans and thawed corn. Corn from a can was crisper and tastier than thawed frozen corn. 2. Basil vs. Cilatro and chile powder versions. Both were good, but really lack flavor. If you're using a very salty chip for scooping, or adding it to a dish, then the recipe is perfect. Otherwise, on it's own it is very bland and needs more salt or other spices of choice.

This is one of those recipes where the end result is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Delish! Made exactly as written, but I can see how it may be adapted (with cilantro, chili powder, etc, as suggested by other reviewers) to suit different cuisines (Mexican, etc). Served with a roasted chicken and orzo w/ parmesan - a basic mid week meal. My hubby raved, the kids were ok w/ it (not big bean lovers) - and we polished the whole bowl! We were hungry, this was good, it hit the spot, and I strongly suggest you try it! You'll like it!

My boyfriend ate it for dinner, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Next time I will make twice as much. This recipe is definatley a keeper. I used black beans instead of kidney, and added parsley, 1 tbsp of low fat Italian salad dressing, 1 tsp hot garlic chilli sauce, and a pinch of chilli powder. I will be making this one again soon.

Delicious! I followed dbuerk's suggestion for a Mexican twist and used cilantro instead of basil. Also followed the suggestion to use chilli powder. I initially wanted to avoid olive oil, but ended up adding about 1/2 tbs to cut down on lemon's acidity. Will definitely make it again!

This is such a great salad. Simple and full of great fresh flavors. I have made it twice and followed the recipe exactly and it has gotten rave reviews.

Very simple, easy and tasty. Pretty too! Skipped the olive oil - wasn't necessary.

This is great. The tomato keeps the corn and beans from being too heavy. I used corn and tomatoes from the farmers' market. Yum!!

This is so easy. It's also good with cilantro instead of basil with lime and chile powder for a mexican version. I like to make it as a bring along salad to back yard BBQ parties.

This was delicious. I added some cooked brown rice and made a little extra dressing and it was very satisfying.
