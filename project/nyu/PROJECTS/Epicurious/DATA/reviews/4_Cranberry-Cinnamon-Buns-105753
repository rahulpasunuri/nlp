These are the MOST AWESOME cinnamon rolls ever!! They are a Christmas tradition and we also have them during the winter months. The dough is the best sweet bread dough I have ever done. The recipe makes enormous buns so I make them smaller but that's the only change I would make in the recipe.

Only my 2nd attempt at baking with yeast, and these turned out perfectly. Followed the recipe very closely. I don't have a dough hook for an electric mixer so I just mixed the dough by hand and it turned out great! Loved the suggestion of using the leftover syrup from the cranberries in the glaze.

I followed the advice from the Vancouver cook and used fresh blueberries instead of cranberries. What a great idea! I completely skipped the syrup making step, which saves time and sugar. Blueberries are naturally sweet, not tart like cranberries, and are in season righ now in Vancouver. These buns turned out fabulous. Very moist and soft. These buns would also be great using raspberries or blackberries.

Instead of the stick of butter called for in the filling, I spread a thin layer of soft butter over the dough, probably only ended up being a 1/4 cup. Instead of cranberries, I sprinkled frozen blueberries over the cinnamon/sugar, pressed them into the dough, and rolled it up! The water in the blueberries makes the buns moist in the middle. I found I needed to bake them an extra 10 minutes. Delicious!

These are amazing. I made them for my boyfriend and he loved them. The cranberries really take them to the next level. I added 3 tablespoons of the leftover syrup from preparing the cranberries to the glaze, which gave them a little more cranberry flavor, as well as making the glaze an attractive pink color.

This has been our Christmas morning breakfast for the past 5-6 years and they are a hit, year after year. This year, I made the glaze with the zest and juice of one orange and mmmmm a delicious new twist.

These are amazing. Couldn't find cranberries in Oregon in April, so used raisins and pecans. Delicious. As good as any I've had from a bakery. We're already planning on having them at Christmas with the cranberries. Make these, they're totally worth the time and calories!

What a great addition for a holiday breakfast. Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I made these with the cranberries and their tartness contrasted nicely with the sweet/rich dough. Had some powdered sugar with a ground vanilla bean in it leftover from holiday cookie baking which I used in the glaze. Used the cranberries left over after straining in some homemade applesauce and that was delicious too.

A pleasure to eat and to make, these buns look exactly like the photo and were a big hit at the brunch I threw on Sunday. Instead of the 2 cake pans they recommended, I used one, large shallow ceramic baking dish, and it worked beautifully. Don't be afraid to really slather on the glaze.

This is my first time rising yeast and making cinnamon buns. The dough turned out perfect and I added some walnuts which made them marvelous!! Great recipe!

This is a perfect dough, I've made this recipe several times and have double the amount of filling it asks for and every bite is then filled with the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar, leaving the nuts and cranberries out. It is wonderful!

Added the whole bag (9 oz) of fresh cranberries plus a little vanilla extract to the glaze (for a little flavor). Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. These were to die for!

Didn't do the cranberry filling, just cinnamon and sugar (not so much butter, either). The buns were great, though. One of the best cinnamon roll doughs I've made.

I made this yesterday for Sunday brunch with a few changes. Used raisins instead of cranberries and pecans instead of walnuts. Worth the time and effort. I used a silicone cake pan, the buns didn't stick and baked perfectly.

I rolled the dough to a 16" square as the recipe indicated, but when I rolled the dough, it elongated to about 21"! I cut into 1" wide rolls and made 19, after taking 1" off each end. We really liked the dough texture. Thought buns needed more cinnamon.

These are the best buns I've ever had! The husband said he would have liked more sugar, but I thought they were sweet enough. Used rasins and pecans for the filling.

It's me again, from Palos Verdes. What I meant to say was that you don't need quite a stick (not a cup) of butter to spread on the dough before forming. I used 6 tablespoons and calculated the calories to be . . . (don't read any further if you're on a diet). . . 485 each.

Definitely worth the effort! The light, tender texture of these buns was outstanding. My husband is allergic to cane sugar, so I used maple sugar in the dough and the filling. For everyday fare, instead of the cranberries, I used a cup of raisins and a cup of coarsely chopped pecans. I don't think you need quite a cup of soft butter to spread on the dough before forming, so here's an opportunity to save a few calories. I don't know why the recipe says to use two round cake pans. These buns fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan. I used a Williams Sonoma metal pan with the Goldtouch surface. When the buns were still a little warm, I popped them out of the pan, cut them apart with a small, sharp knife, and put most of them in the freezer. Otherwise I would have eaten three.

I've looked all over for a good cinnamon bun recipe, and this is most certainly the one to keep. You don't even need to use cranberries for filling, necessarily, you can use walnuts, or pecans, or craisin - or any other variation of your choice. The recipe is, as other reviewers mentioned, slightly time-consuming, but not overly so. And it is worth the time - they come out tasting great. I recieved many compliments on these! I will definitely make them over and over.

Instead of 2 cups of cranberries, I used 1 cup of dried raisins (didn't have cranberried, but had lots of raisins) and kept the walnuts. Of course, I didn't do the whole simmering with sugar bit. I mean raisins are already sweet. Great recipe. Sometimes we skip raisins and just use walnuts. Definitely a keeper!

I agree with the other reviews- fabulous and worth the effort. Not that the recipe is difficult but my mixer didn't have the juice to do the work with the dough hooks so I kneaded the butter in by hand. I didn't have cranberries so omitted, also not quite enough flour so topped up with 1/2c of hemp flour. It gave the dough a slightly green tint which may work well with the cranberries for a Christmas look. As for freezing after baking, my source suggests freezing ASAP, don't let them cool first so that more moisture is trapped in the buns.

What a wonderful recipe! I have made these exactly as the recipe states, and they are wonderful. This is a wonderful way to utilize fresh cranberries, which are in such abundance at the holidays. I have made many times, and these quicly became a holiday tradition. Though, I have never made without cranberries, I believe this recipe could stand up to changes, such as dried cherries, no fruit at all, or any other kind of dried fruit one might want to try.

I impressed myself with these tasty buns! I do however recommend that you have 11 other people over to eat these with as you may (as I was) be tempted to eat quite a few. Any tips on freezing these-at what stage would I freeze them??

Wow, what a success. My guests said the buns looked like they came from a bakery. The inside was so soft, especially the middle bun. I baked it in a tin with removable base and that was a big help. Parts of the bun were stuck to the base because the sugar caramelized but I had no problem loosening it. Would have been harder in a tin which did not come apart. The buns were not so soft the next day - to be expected - but just as delicious. We only managed to eat 6 and I have frozen the other 6 without letting them rise the second time. Have to wait and see.

Loved this recipe. I've made this a couple times now and I find that under-baking it by just 5 min. makes it much more moist and gooey. I also added softened cream cheese to the icing for extra flavour and creaminess.

We left the cranberries out of our first batch of these cinnamon buns so that we could really compare them head-to-head with our old cinnamon bun recipe, and boy were we ever suprised! These are our absolute new favorites! They are always gobbled up at workplace gatherings, and are consistantly terrific.

Wonderful! And, I thought, easy to make (incredible brioche like dough with little effort). I used dried cranberries and orange zest in the filling. I don't like icing or glaze, so instead brushed the tops with a mixture of OJ, melted butter and a little powdered sugar before baking and then again right out of the oven. They were delicious and perfect for the holidays.

Wonderful! A Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition. Assemble them the night before, wrap pan tightly with wrap, take out for final rise and bake in the morning. Great cranberry flavor contrasting with brioche-like dough. I make these for host[ess] gifts for neighbors who have holiday parties - they can wake up to these for breakfast. Time-consuming, and worth every minute

This was a great recipe. The cranberries were an excellent addition and cut the sweetness. I used fresh cranberries and I would add even more next time. I have tried many cinnamon bun recipes and these are by far the best thanks to the cranberries.

These were awesome as they are, but they also offer a lot of room for improvisation. I simmered the cranberries in OJ, and added a dash of orange extract to the frosting. Next time, I'd double the filling . . . chocolate chips, dried cherries, there are so many variations on cranberries. Mmmmm . . . so good.

wow. this were scrumptious. i made them for my brother, who doesn't go for the cranberries or nuts, so i left those out, and halved it because they were only for him, but it was so delicious my mom and I had so many I'm going to remake this recipe again and again. the perfect cinnamon bun recipe!

We put this together on Christmas Eve and baked them in the morning for eating while opening presents. They were wonderful, moist & chewy. No problem with rolling out or forming. However, they really stuck to the pans and were a little difficult to remove.

A deliciously interesting variant on the traditional cinnamon bun. Definitely a keeper. Only one minor nit was that the dough was REALLY wet and sticky. Almost overly so. Had to use a very generous amount of flour to keep it from sticking when rolling, and it was tough to keep them in a roll shape. Nonetheless, definitely recommended.

This is a delicious twist on the usual cinnamon bun because the tartness of the cranberries compliments the sweetness of the cinnamon and sugar so nicely. The men in my house don't usually go for pastries which are too sweet and they really liked this recipe. I am going to make another batch soon and see if I can freeze them (unbaked).
