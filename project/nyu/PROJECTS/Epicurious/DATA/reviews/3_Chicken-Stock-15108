I use chicken thighs and I make this in my crockpot. The clove and leaving the skin on the onion were great additions. I also used shallots and the flavor was wonderful. My partner is on a low sodium diet and canned chicken stock is a no no so we keep this on hand.

Good basic recipe, but I'd make the following changes: 1) roast the chicken and vegetables for about 1 hr, defat and deglaze the roasting pan. Then put chicken, veg, and deglazing liquid into stock pot. 2) Omit the clove. 3) Don't even partially cover the stock pot as it may cause the stock to boil, which will turn it gray and greasy (fat will become emulsified).

I'd suggest leaving onion whole and unpeeled--the skin adds a wonderful color. Adding a leek instead of garlic makes for a richer flavor.

We use chicken stock a great deal. This recipie uses some ingredients which we have not incorporated in ours. It is a great improvement
