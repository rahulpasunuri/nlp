Having grown up in southeastern PA, this recipe is very similar to the ones passed down to me from my grandmothers. Though we always add a little saffron to the broth to give it some nice flavor and that golden color, as someone else mentioned. I often serve this with peas on the side, which some people like to mix in with their pot pie. Altogether a really wonderful stew!

Similar experience for me that by A Cook's review said. I grew up in South Central PA and "Pot Pie" as we knew it was very similar to this recipe. When I was a kid my grandma would roll out the dough and let me help her cut out the dough. I have not tried this recipe but agree its "looks like the real deal" as said before

Good recipie except it's missing the most important ingredient. I was raised in Lancaster County PA, the heart of 'PA Dutch Country' and my Mennonite aunts always used saffron in their chicken pot pie to give it that wonderful yellow color and flavor. Without saffron, this recipe is just chicken stew with pot pie noodles!

I grew up in southeastern PA eating a potpie almost exactly like this, so when I needed the recipe to comfort a friend and my mom was away, I was happy to find this. And about 10 batches later, I'm still happy. I rarely make the broth a day ahead of time and, consequently, don't worry about removing the fat. I up the carrots and celery a bit, plus typically double the recipe in generally because I start with a larger chicken. This reheats well in serving sizes in a microwave, and my friends love getting a quart or two when I feel like sharing. Chili is passe; THIS is what I'm serving at my Super Bowl party.

Great dish. I have made this for years, a hand down from my mother. We add a large sweet potato in place of the carrot and make a simple dough of flour milw eggs and salt.

My grandmother from Northwestern Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German) used to make this. She always said it was a German recipe passed down through the family. This is what I have always known as "pot pie." Outside of my family I always had to explain to people, that to me, "pot pie" was not chicken stew baked in pastry. It's nice to see this recipe in print. I know it's very old fashioned and an heirloom recipe. Although, my family recipe is slightly different: First the chicken is left whole and removed from the pot just before eating. Second, the potatoes are boiled in another pot and served on the side, sometimes mashed. The "pot pie," or noodles, are strained and served with a sprinkle of cidar vinegar (sometimes the pot pie, or noodles, are placed on top of the mashed potatoes). It's less of a "stew." than this recipe, but basically it's the same recipe. I only have one real objection to this version. Skimming the chicken fat! I know it's not p.c. now to actually keep fat, but the pot pie noodles soaking up the fat is what makes this dish. Over the years I've started adding a little fresh rosemary or thyme. If you like tasting history, and you don't mind that this is not a "yuppie," or "in vogue" style recipe, you'll love it.

I haven't made this-YET, but I did want to add my 2 cents and say that living in true Pennsylvania Dutch country, this sounds like the real deal. This would probably also work well with beef as opposed to chicken.

This dish was excellent! It tasted like a dish my Grandmother made many years ago. It was great to fnd a recipe for a meal that I remember eating but had no idea how to prepare. Thanks!!
