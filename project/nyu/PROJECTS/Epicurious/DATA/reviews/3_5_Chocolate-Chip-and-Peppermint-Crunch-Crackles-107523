I am having a hard time with these cookies...and I don't think there is anything wrong with this recipe but I thought I would chime in. These are way too rich for my taste. Too intense. Too much. If you go for over the top then these are your cookies. Beware!

LOVE these cookies! Second year making them - they are so delicious with a nice fudgy texture, and with the peppermint very festive. The only thing to be aware of is if you refrigerate the mixture overnight you will need to take it out of the fridge at least an hour or two before using as it sets hard as rock!

Just made these again for the 4th year in a row. I follow the recipe exactly with the exception that the crushed mint goes into the cookies right out of the oven so that they stick once the cookies cool. I only chilled the dough for about an hour and that was sufficient. I also put the crushed candy through a coarse strainer to separate the dust from the crushed pieces, and put the finer candy dust into the dough and saved the bigger pieces for pressing into the tops after baking

Rating: 4
BTW... If you're using the crushed candy for decoration, don't wait for the cookies to cool,put it on right away or the candy won't stick. I used a small cookie scoop to shape and measure and the recipe made over 60 cookies. I like these cooked for the 11 minutes called for in the recipe.

I have been making these for many years. I am writing this as much for you as for a note to self. It's important to use FINELY crushed mints for the first step. Every year I forget and think the larger pieces will melt in the chocolate and they don't. Try to use the bigger pieces for the garnish stage and the ultra fine for the melted stage. that being said these cookies are fantastic! I love brownie like texture and the bittersweet chocolate/mint combo. Use good quality chocolate.

These cookies came out great, but when I tasted the first batch while cooling, they were very bitter. I added some more sugar and candy cane pieces to the remaining batter and those came out amazing. Surprisingly, the bitter cookies tasted great two days later! These were a huge hit at our holiday party.

To crush peppermint: use a box of candy canes, unwrapped (less to unwrap than starlight mints, plus you can use the green and red peppermint ones for visual pizzazz), put them in a freezer bag, lay the freezer bag between two kitchen towels, and whack them with a heavy metal measuring cup (we use the 2 cup). This is an excellent job for your junior assistants (kids). We've used this technique to make peppermint bark for years!

These were amazing! I made a three-times batch for a large crowd and people loved them. After testing with a few, I only baked them for about 6 minutes because I love that moist texture. These are quite sophisticated tasting and will become a repeat holiday cookie for me.

These are fantastic! A bit of work - crushing the candy canes etc. - but well worth it. Be careful not to overbake, as they'll lose their chewy texture.

Very good. One of my favorite Christmas cookies. A huge hit. I do suggest instead of using the starburst mints on top to use "milk peppermints" on top, they aren't as hard to chew but look just as good.

Decadent! Like little brownies. The peppermint wasn't as prominent as I was expecting; I would have liked a little more of a peppermint aftertaste. But overall very good if you're looking for a pepperminty chocolate brownie-cookie.

My husband and I ate the first whole batch. I should have JUST DONE THESE for Christmas baking. Mini peppermint chocolate lava cakes. Enough said.

I've made these several times for christmas over the past few years and they always turn out great. This year I had chocolate nibs that I didn't know what to do with and used them instead of chocolate chips. Wonderful!! An extra punch of strong chocolate flavor with a bit more crunch and not as sweet. Just great!

Rating: 3
These cookies were a hit last year with the inlaws and many others, BUT I did not finish them per the recipe's directions. Rather I rough-chunked a fine quality chocolate mint bar (you can probably find one in your store's candy section) into 1" x 1/2" triangles and poked a triangle into the top of each cookie while they were fresh from the oven. The added mint flavor and extra smoothness were wonderful. I'll definitely make them again this year.

Rating: 4
I have made these cookies, as written, every year since printed in 2002. They are my favorite beating out my homemade rainbow cookies! These are fudgy and minty and addictive! The crunch only comes from the peppermint decoration on the top. Make sure to use good quality chocolate and peppermint candies. It's a winner!

Rating: 0
I made this last year and they turned out GREAT. Beyond the flavor, everyone loved the texture of the cookie, which was the perfect blend between chewy and crunchy. Try it!!!

Rating: 1
This recipe was super disappointing to me. They are the kind of cookies that look better than they taste, surprisingly given how much good stuff is in them. They are sort of flavorless. I can't believe I'm saying this, but they aren't sweet enough. They have a strange bready texture. There is nothing 'crunchy' about them. I made them exactly as directed by the recipe. If anyone wants to try these, be sure to slightly under-cook them to achieve a more fudgy texture, not that that would change the flavor problems.

Rating: 4
I always thought it was such a shame to make these cookies only at the holidays (the peppermint in my opinion=Christmas)...so I got creative and followed the recipe exactly, but in place of the crushed peppermint and peppermint extract, I used Almond Butter and Almond extract and decorated the top with slivered almonds. Because the Almond Butter really isn't sweet, I did make 1 addition, a Tablespoon of powdered sugar, added w/ the Almond Butter. These got RAVE reviews. Now I can make these all year long!

Rating: 3
I was in too much of a hurry while making these, so I didn't let batter sit in the fridge long enough AND I forgot the chocolate chip step: still they turned out beautiful and delicious! Next year, with better planning, I'll try them again and hope to get the 4+ fork rating I can imagine they deserve.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe--as is. They were delicious. Yes, a little bit more high maintenance because of the mess grinding and crushing the peppermint candy. But they were worth it. I did them on a big baking day so they had plenty of time to rest in the fridge while I did other things. These will be on my regular rotation from now on.

Rating: 0
I have made these cookies twice. Both times they were a hit. I had no problem with them keeping thier shape - I live at 6,300' elevation. I've used both candy canes and the peppermints - just crush them in a plastic bag with a hammer. To form the balls I use a melon baller - simple to scoop out and form. I only bake them 10 minutes and let them sit 2 minutes before I take a small amount of the mints and press them into the cookies.

Rating: 4
These are fantastic. Took them to Christmas dinner and everyone devoured them. Definitely a keeper. Refrigerated dough overnite but the cookies didn't stay in the shape of balls after cooking. I expected this since I live at an elevation of nearly 6000 feet (2000 meters). They did, however, come out very thick and I followed another cook's suggestion and gently pressed the crushed peppermints on top right after coming out of the oven. Used my coffee grinder for the 'finely crushed peppermints - I used candy canes - and it worked like a charm. These will definitely become a part of our holiday cookie reportoire from here on out.

Chewy and delicious but not too heavy or overpowering. Definitely a new favorite in our house.

Awful. Bready and bitter. Followed the recipe except didn't have peppermint extract so didn't add it. Used high quality chocolate, too - this was an expensive mistake. In retrospect - maybe the chocolate was too high in cocoa content. Regardless, the texture is still unappealing. Was planning on giving these away for Christmas. Maybe lumps of coal would be kinder.

These were fudgy and minty everything they say it is. pretty simple but a little expensive over all. i didn;t wait long at all to shove the peppermint candies in the center and i think it produced a nice minty flavor

Rating: 2
I used the overnight option, perhaps that was too long. In cooking they puddled down into a traditional cookie shape. That wasn't so bad. At 11 minutes cooking though, yikes, no cracking. So I went to 14 minutes which produced suitable looking cookies BUT, they were raw in the middle, very unpleasant. So back in the oven they went, for another 8 minutes which finally cooked them. In the end, a somewhat expensive, rich but somehow unrewarding cookie.

Rating: 4
I have made these cookie every year since the recipe was published in 2002; friends and family have grown to expect them in their Christmas cookie tins. Very rich and indulgent. But don't pack them with other cookies if you do assorted gift tins -- everything will be redolent of peppermint and chocolate!

Rating: 4
These are amazing cookies. We made them for Christmas 2007...ate them all, and made some more! We shared the 2nd batch with the neighbors, THEN had to give them the recipe! Really, these are just very good. They do take a lot of effort to make, but are worth it!! We used regular hard candy mints, put them in a bag and used a hammer to break them up - very easy. I'm actually on this site right now getting the recipe again to make them for Xmas 2008!

These are incredible! Super rich and chocolatey. I took one reviewers advice to use the Ande's peppermint crunch pieces rather than candy cane. Wonderful! I put some more on top as soon as they came out of the oven.

I just finished making these cookies and they turned out perfect! Crackled on top and soft and chewy in the center. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
These were great. I rolled the balls of dough in powdered sugar, however, before I baked them, to give them a nicer and more "crackled" look. (That's the way my mom used to do it.) I left out the peppermints and peppermint extract entirely because I can't find them here in Egypt, and they were still great. They came out very round if the dough was extremely chilled before baking, and a little flatter for the second cookie sheet (because the dough sat out on the counter for 15 minutes.)

Rating: 4
YUM! My family devoured these. I appreciated the tips to chill dough really well and use candy canes. A meat mallet worked well to crush the mints. Can also top with coarsely crushed mints before baking; they melt and give a different look. Now I need to make another batch!

Just made these this xmas morning and they were simple yet delicious and quite beautiful too. Definitely a classic hit for each upcoming season.

Delicious. I used a combination of WilliamsSonoma Peppermint Snow and Andes Peppermint Crunch for the peppermint candies. I drizzled the tops after they were cool with !/2 cup powdered sugar mixed with 2-1/2 tsp milk. Then I sprimkled more of the Peppermint Snow over the tops. They did not remain ball shaped as the picture shows but were soft and chewy with a melted fudgy inside. Delicious!

I followed the directions exactly but omitted the peppermint extract. I wanted a less intense peppermint flavor. I refrigerated the mixture overnight before forming the balls. They came out perfect. Just like the photo. My husband loves both mint and chocolate and gives these cookies a "solid four".

I made my cookies a few days ago, and I agree with one reviewer that they are better the first day. But I have a suggestion for when they get not-so-fresh. Micorwave a cookie for about 10 seconds - it really freshens them up and brings out the mint flavor again.

Rating: 4
Yum! This is one of my favorite cookies! They do turn out better after chilling, but I've never had their surface crackle, don't know what I'm doing wrong. As the previous reviewer mentioned, sometimes the crushed peppermints don't stick very well - I've found that it helps if the cookies are still hot, no more than a couple of minutes out of the oven before pressing them into the crushed mints.

Rating: 4
These cookies are very yummy. Everyone loves them, and I can't wait to bring them to my cookie exchange! If someone could help with the decorative mints on top, I'd be grateful. Crushing the mints finely worked well with a coffee grinder, but the pieces were too uneven for the top. Also, I was unable to "press" the coarsely ground mints on the top of the cookies after they sat 5 minutes - they didn't stick at all. Can someone help me with that? None of the 46 previous reviewers mentioned this problem, so I'm hoping there's an easy solution.

Rating: 4
This was a very yummy! It was like fudge brownie with mint. I only omitted the mint extract, used 3oz unsweetened chocolate (rest was semi-sweet), and they turned out moist and crackled. Chilled it 3 hours and they did not flatten out that much. Though my hands did get messy by rolling, it's a winner. It was very difficult to stop eating them.

A little messy to make, but worth it in the end. My newest cookie to my holiday collection!

Like many reviewers, my cookies flattened slightly when baked. I followed the recipe exactly -- except I used chips for melting, rather than bar chocolate. This recipe was very easy to make, and the flavor was delicious, but I had to under cook the cookies by at least a minute to get them moist and tender. This meant they never got that lovely crackle on the top. The cookies I allowed to crackle (about 12 minutes) were dry and crumbly. My husband liked them so much I had to hide the tin outside in my car.

My husband called these chocolate pillows. These were so delicious! They do take a little bit more time, but I used my cookie scooper and that saved a lot of time! I crushed my candies too fine so it didn't quite look like the picture. As others said I did cut my peppermint extract in half and that was perfect. Next time I will plan on doing a double batch of these for my cookie tins that I give away. I definitely plan to make these again!

I just had to defend this recipe! I have made these cookies several times now and always get rave reviews. I follow the recipe exactly, they turn out looking perfect, and everyone loves them. Maybe my cookies don't flatten because I usually chill overnight. They are messy to make, and a little time consuming, but oh so worth it!

These are the worst cookies I have made in a long time. The cookie was ok...a little dry and crumbly; I felt the crunch from the peppermint chunks was out of place in such a light delicate cookie. I can see this working in a fudgy, brownie type cookie, but this combination was off.

Great taste, but I wonder can anyone get these to look like the picture??? Mine flattened out a little bit, and reading the reviews, it seems that everyone says this. Does anyone have advice on how to get them to keep their shape?

Fantastic flavor and texture. My only comment is that my kitchen was cold when I made these, so I found it hard to add in the flour mixture; I had to work hard to incorporate the flour. And I don't think the chilling in the refrigerator was necessary. I had to wait till the dough softened before I could form the cookies. I only wish I had doubled the recipe.

A nice addition to my regular xmas mix (including the cranberry turtle bars on this site...a must have for any holiday gathering).

I have always wanted to make these cookies because they look so delicious in the photo in Bon Appetit.

I have made this recipe twice now and wouldn't change a thing. The second time I even had to make a double batch as the first didn't last long!!

I will definately add these to my annual holiday baking list.

just a comment on the previous review- chocolate chips melt totally different than bar chocolate & could have accounted for the sticky/ gooey mess

Rating: 3
I had some red and green candy canes I wanted to use up, so I decided to try this recipe (~ 8 canes for 1/2 cup). They are very yummy and taste like brownies. But I doubt I'll make them again: the dough is super sticky and made a big mess of my hands and utensils trying to roll into balls. I don't know if mints would be easier to work with than candy canes, but they were impossible to crush - I ended up putting them in a coffee grinder to make powder, and that worked well, but for the decorative ones, I had bits of candy flying all over my kitchen trying to whack them with a meat tenderizer. As far as the other ingredients are concerned, I didn't use different kinds of chocolate - just all semi sweet chips (and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup). I also left out the peppermint extract. They were plenty minty AND plenty chocolatey even with these omissions. The final result is good, but it was a lot of work. I must have made mine smaller, although they seemed right, because I got over 50.

I thought this was a very good recipe! I have been looking for a cookie with a little "holiday flair" for my cookie swaps and this is definitely it.

I think this will be a big hit with the kids for the holidays!

I'm not great at following measurements so I don't bake much. These cookies were great but relatively more work because of melting the chocolate and the prolonged chilling.

These were really good, with a brownie-like texture. I left out the chocolate chips and rolled the balls of dough in coarse turbinado sugar before baking, which gave them a nice, crisp sugar coating that is a good contrast with the soft interior. Use a food processor or blender to crush the candies - so much easier. These were a big hit with my chocolate/mint loving family.

Excellent! The best chocolate cookies I've made. We love peppermint and this cookie got rave reviews from everyone. The best part was how soft they were, and stayed that way -- even a week later! My only complaint was that they were small, but I think that is my fault. I was more worried about having a lot of cookies than how big they were. Next time, I'll make a double batch!

I was dissappointed with this recipe. My girlfriend had won a bake off with it so I was excited to try it. The cookies took a long time to make and they were just "so so" in the end.

Great recipe. Fairly easy -- if you have the time to let the batter chill. Regarding the cook who's cookies came out dry, I didn't have a problem at all...still moist 1 day later. I used Baker's unsweetend and Ghiridelli semi-sweet chocolate. Big rave at the office.

This cookie was great and easy. I cooked mine for 9-10 min's and they were moist and fudgy. I didn't have any peppermint extract and used a T of peppermint schnapps instead. It provided a hint of mint, just right for me (who is not a peppermint fan). These are just right for the holiday season!

These cookies were excellent, the only downfall is that you can't eat just one, or two. This is my pick for my annual "Sweets Swap", I found the cookie to have a wonderful chocolate/mint taste while being very moist. This will be a holiday staple for years to come.

I enjoyed the flavor of the cookies, chocolate and mint can't be beat. I used a blender to crush the peppermint candies, which saved time. The cookies came out looking just like the ones in the picture. However, I olny give the recipie two forks because the cookies came out quite dry and I tend to like moist cookies. The fault may be mine, my oven is slightly off. Next time, I'll use higher quality chocolate (I tried it with Bakers this time around) and see how that helps.

Everyone loved these. Will definitely make again. The candies took some pounding with the mallet to crush - those things are hard!
