Really wanted to like this; in fact thought I'd love it, but such a disappointment. Needs a ton of salt or something. Used roquefort and still left us unsatisfied. Would be much zippier if cooked in beef broth with a gruyere cheese.

Very good, very simple. I ended up having to make it on the stovetop in a heavy cast iron Dutch oven (I don't have an oven in my new house!) but it still worked beautifully, and the sauce thickened nicely. I used half anf half simply because I was out of cream, but I'd recommend doing it that way any time. Was still very creamy and delicious. The time honored test of tastiness: even my three year-old loved it. A bit of crumbled bacon would be a nice addition as a topping.

at first this recipe came out "soupy," but i put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes before i added the blue cheese, and it came-out well!

this was only OK, not the best gratin out there.

This dish is simply amazing! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out splendidly, not soupy at all. The total prep time was less than five minutes and the taste was out of this world.

Mine came out bland and kind of soupy, despite plenty of time to thicken. I won't make this again.

I rate this four forks on the basis of my family's enthusiasm. I happened to have horseradish cheddar on hand and it worked extremely well.

I favor simple recipes, and this one is now high on my list of regulars. So simple, and so good. I agree with others that this one needs a little more garlic and I also added more cheese. Even my wife, who is my chief critic, loved this one.

These potatoes were delicious. A quick, simple preparation of au gratin potatoes. Like some other reviewers I increased the garlic, salt, and pepper-sublime!These will become a regular in our repetoire

My husband, who is not a potato lover, thought these were very good. I added 4 cloves of garlic and some shallots...I also added more blue cheese and lots of white pepper. We had this with the balsamic glazed ribeyes from the site...what a wonderful (and easy) meal for a Thursday night!

A more bland potatoes au gratin I've never tasted. Even the blue cheese didn't do much to liven it up. Interesting, though, how the cream "becomes" a lovely, smooth sauce when boiled away at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. Easy to construct? Yes! Delicious? Not for me. If I ever do make this again, I'll add more spices for some zip. As the recipe is written, these potatoes are barely breathing.

So easy and so good. I may have used a bit more blue cheese than called for because I love it.

This was very good. For those who shy away from heavy cream---yoghurt works very well.

This dish was delicious. I made some mild adjustments as my oven does not have a broil feature. I also did not have a 10-in skillet with fireproof handle. I used a pyrex 9" by 9" and put my oven to its highest level for the final few minutes. Came out fantastic.
