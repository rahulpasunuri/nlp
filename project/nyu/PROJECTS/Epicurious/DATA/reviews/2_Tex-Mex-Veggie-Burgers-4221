Not a fan. These didn't even hold together all that well after I added 3 eggs and fried them up like pancakes. I would love to see this recipe as a corn fritters recipe or some sort of polenta concoction because that's more like what it turns out to be. I really don't think they should be called veggie burgers. That being said, they were fairly tasty and I'll probably be eating them with avocado slices, salsa, and sour cream (no bun or tortilla, because why eat starch w/ more starch?).

The "burgers" didn't hold together enough to grill so I panfried them, warmed the tortilla in microwave and served this as an appetizer cut into wedges - more like a quesadilla - I also added shredded lettuce and diced avocado - really good flavor, everyone raved!

I didn't care for these. While they were easy, they weren't good enough to make again. I guess I prefer veggie burgers based in beans rather than corn -- I also would have cooked the jalapeno to mellow the flavor a bit.

I have NOT tried this recipe but would like to recommend the "Chick-Pea Walnut Burgers" on this site. It does contain an egg thou.

Gotta be honest...I didn't want to make this, though it seemed the closest I could find to a traditional garden or veggie burger on epicurious. Searching Google, I found a pretty good "Best Veggie Burger" recipe at www.vegweb.com/food/subs/veggie-burgers5.shtml. I'd give it 3 forks.

One problem with the recipe is that it doesn't indicate what you are supposed to do with the other 1/2 cup of cornmeal. I added it to the corn mixture before putting it in the pan to cook. I also added additional spices to give it some zinginess. My 4th of July vegetarian friends gave it a thumbs-up. A good recipe that I'll make again, but they are not out-of-this-world fantastic. I'll continue on my search for the amazing veggie burger recipe...
