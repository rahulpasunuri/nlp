Excellent! Lots of work, but it has a lovely and impressive presentation. Used baggies because I don't have pastry tips/bags. Lovely peppermint flavor, but only used 1/2 the amt called for as I prefer just a hint of peppermint.

The peppermint cream is great, very subtle and holds up well. The glaze isn't the best, if you have a never fail ganache recipe use it instead. Otherwise great item and looks impressive.
