Really good! Simple to make!

I'm giving 4 forks because it's so simple to make and very versatile. I used a cheese blend of provolone, mozzarella and cheddar. I think it would taste great with other cheeses and seasonings as well. It's basically a stripped down arancini recipe, but works really well. I didn't bother with the sauce; I think next time I'll try a red pepper sauce or a salsa verde. I'll definitely make this again.

LOVE these! I didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce suggested here so I went another way - a sweet and spicy red pepper sauce that worked out perfectly. The fritters themselves are just a bit bland so a sauce with a bit of oomph is a must. I'd also suggest adding just one of the two eggs recommended before deciding if the second is required; my second egg made the mixture a tad too wet. But a super simple recipe and one that's got me thinking about different variations.

The fritters were very tasty and rather easy to make.... I thought the vinegar sauce, while good, wasn't the right match for the cheesy flavor of the fritters. I found the vinegar had too much sharpness and bite for the subtle taste of the cheese and milky rice. I think I would have preferred something a little more smoother in taste; such as an aioli or mustard based dipping sauce. Nonetheless, I would recommend this as a great appetizer and would certainly make it again.
