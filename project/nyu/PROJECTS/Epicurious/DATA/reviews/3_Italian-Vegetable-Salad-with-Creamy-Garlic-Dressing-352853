This recipe gets 4 forks the way I made it...slight variation of what is written. Used a mandoline to slice the cauliflower and fennel...had no asparagus. Used mayonaisse, anchovies,dijon,lemon juice and 3-4 cloves of garlic blended in f.processor for the dressing. It didn't need any extra oil. I kept eating more salad just to get a bit more of the yummy dressing.Kids loved it too.

It seems to me the asparagus and culiflower should be parboiled. Someone else try it and let me know if parboiling helps or hurts.

Made this salad with a lamb shank main and found it to be a great counterpart to the meal. It added a fresh, delicious crunch to an otherwise heavy, rich meal. Got great reviews and will definately be a new regular. I made it with mayo instead of the egg yolks and oil. Made it super easy.
