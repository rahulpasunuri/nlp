This was awesome at a brunch for 25 people. instead of poaching the eggs individually, I spread the hash in a roasting pan, cracked (12) eggs on top, and let the pan keep in a 300-F oven for 5-8 minutes until the eggs were set. Served with fruit salad; seaweed salad; and almond-ginger biscotti.

My daughter and I started making this for Christmas brunch when it first appeared, and it has become a family tradition. Once,I prepared the ingredients, put them in my dehydrator, and took it on a backpacking trip - it was fantastic after a day of walking through the Monongahela National Forest.

This was a big hit at my sunday-after-thanksgiving brunch. Some hints: you don't really need the fresh salmon if you don't have it handy. The smoked salmon adds plenty of salmon flavor. Because I was cooking for a large buffet party, I didn't make poached eggs (though it would be better with them) but opted for creamy scrambled eggs on the side, which still worked nicely. Also, don't be scared off by the requirement of two skillets. I just used one dutch oven and stirred often to keep the bottom from burning. To the person who had trouble with the sweet potatoes cooking: if cut small enough, they should cook perfectly, but don't forget to put the lid on the skillet - the steam is what does it. I wouldn't cook them first because they'd get too mushy. Final note: be aware that more people than you might guess have an aversion to sweet & salty tastes mixed together, in which case they are missing quite a treat here, so be careful when making this your only breakfast dish.

My husband and I have made this dish several times to rave reviews. Unlike the other reviewers, we use the specified amount of maple syrup and find it to be well balanced.

Made this for bruch for my law school roommates - they raved. I did cut back the maple syrup somewhat.

I love this recipe! It tasted as fantastic as it looked, but be aware it is fragile in it's final stages. I plan on using this recipe for a small dinner party but have served it as a brunch in the past.

The best thing I can say about this recipe is that it looks wonderful. I did not like the taste of sweet potatoes with salmon. I took the recommendation of the previous reviewer and cut the syrup by a 1/3. Was not too sweet. Also, poached the eggs in the pan with the hash at the end. Cut down on the work. (cover pan)

This dish was so good! However, my husband and I found it to be a little too sweet with the maple syrup. I would definitely make it again, but either omit or cut down on the maple syrup.
