I make this dish all the time - and have been asked for the recipe on several occasions. It is great on a hot summer day especially when you need to make something in advance. If you are going to substitute olive oil for the walnut oil be sure to use a really nice extra virgin olive oil - keep in mind that like wine not all olive oils are the same. For this recipe splurge on a good bottle!

My friend made this yesterday for her Mother-in-law's birthday. She added dried cranvberries and used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts. We all loved it! I plan to make it for dinner soon.

Based on other reviews, I added quite a bit of lemon zest, and cooked the orzo in salted chicken stock, it came out nicely, but not the best recipe ever...

I, too, found this dish very, very bland. Will not make this again.

This dish is perfect with a more elaborate dinner. It is somewhat simple but pleasant and would be a great counterpart with more robust or richer dishes. I used the wanut oil it called for and increased the walnuts a little bit. Since it can be prepared ahead of time it would be a great help in blancing a more elaborate presentation for say an Easter dinner.

An easy and fairly quick dish to make. I eliminated some of the oil and lemon juice when I made it and it came out rather bland ... stirred in a little curry power @ the end and thought it was wonderful!

Although this is pretty and easy to make, I found it very very bland. I read these great reviews and I am surprised it was so well received. I wouldn't make it again unless I really dressed it up with some other ingredients so it had some flavor.

This dish was the biggest hit of a pot luck barbecue honoring visitors from Singapore. I also made it for this year's Christmas Eve buffet. It is easy to make, travels well, and I usually have all ingredients on hand.

I served this dish to my gourmet lunch group and it got rave reviews!! A great side dish for grilled meats that can be done ahead.
