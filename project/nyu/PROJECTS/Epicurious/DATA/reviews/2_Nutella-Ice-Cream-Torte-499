Nothing special and that's from someone who loves nutella. Used a good quality ice cream, so it was just a basic ice cream cake.

Very disappointed. It would have easier just to serve the icecrean and then the let everyone put there own nutella on the ice cream

Have made this twice. First time using homemade icecream and the second with store bought. There are two critical parts to remember. First, is the quality and flavor of the ice creams used - which effects presentation and taste. Second, I found that if I heated the Nutella slightly in the microwave than "poured" it on the icecream it was better distributed when served and did not have intensive chocolate "hot" spots. Of course, make sure to leave enough room in the top of the container used so it doesn't slide off :>)
