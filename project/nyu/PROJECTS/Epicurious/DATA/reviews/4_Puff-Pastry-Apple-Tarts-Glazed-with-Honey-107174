The flavor of your apples will probably determine if this will be a two, three or four star dessert. We added a squirt of lemon juice to the apples, some cinnamon and orange juice to the honey and used cinnamon sugart instead of plain sugar. They were great....glazed a few with a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze instead of the orange honey...and they were preferred by some to the honey-glazed....but I loved the honey glaze....

I really enjoyed this recipe but prefer a version I found in a French cookbook that, in addition to the steps here, involves cooking finely-cubed apples in simple syrup with a vanilla bean, spreading the cooked apples on the puff pastry & layering the thin uncooked slices of apple over that, then reducing the vanilla-infused simple syrup (reserved from the cooked apples) to a jelly that's brushed over the top when the tart comes out of the oven. It's a bit more of a rich, complex flavor while still very simple, good and impossibly French :)

These were great and easy to make for a novice tart-maker like me to make. I made the tarts in the shape of hearts, apples and rounds by cutting stencils from a piece of paper. My lessons learned: 1. Don't roll out the dough too thin or the crust will stay soggy and not get puffy. 2. Cut the apples as thin as possible. 3. Watch out for lots of juices running off the baking sheets into the oven. For pictures of how the tarts came out and of the shapes I used, visit my blog, Recipe Mashups at http://www.recipemashups.com/.

Wonderful, easy, delicious. What more can you ask for? I used a giant heart shaped cookie cutter and doubled the recipe. Guests were fighting over the last one.

Impressive and delicious and soooo easy! I added cinnamon to the sugar as suggested and drizzled with warm caramel sauce instead of honey - excellent variation! Vanilla ice cream a must!

Really good recipe to show off the flavor of fresh apples in simple way. It just looked and smelled and tasted like fall! Like others, I left off the honey, and embellished with cinnamon and vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again.

A simple recipe, but a wonderful dessert! I made this for two, so I rolled the puff pastry into one rectangle instead of the individual circles. The tart required about 10 minutes of extra baking that way, and still finished wonderfully.

This was wonderful! Tastes great, easy to make and pretty presentation. I'm making it again tonight for guests.

Excellent and easy to make. Crispy crust, sweet apples, a simple and yummy dessert. A keeper!

as simple and tasty as everyone says... i left the pastry out on the counter to defrost all day (a lot longer than the required 40 minutes) and skipped refrigerating the dough for an additional 30 minutes after rolling it, and mine turned out fine. added plenty cinnamon, ground ginger (would have used crystalized if i'd had some) and allspice.

So simple! I wowed my guests with this easy dessert. I served this with fresh maple syrup and homemade vanilla ice cream. Yumalicious!

Yes this is a good one if you're in a hurry - I guess it kind of defeats the purpose to gussy it up too much! I made them with my 3 yr old and because it's so quick it was a short enough project to hold his attention & he loved them. I had a glut of black cherries so with 2 of them I made a layer of ground almonds and then placed the cherries on top. Also very nice indeed.....will make sure i have some puff pastry in my freezer from now on!

This is a lovely recipe! Simple easy and quite delightful. If you are looking for fast cure for a sweet tooth you can't go wrong.

Consistent, simple and delicious...I love this recipe. Instead of shaping this into rounds, I rolled out the puff pastry and cut the entire sheet into 8 rectangles, which made individual servings. I trimmed the apples to fit so they looked pretty. Pleases kids, but not too sweet for adults---great for a crowd.

Used box tart shell mix from Williams' Sonoma...bought fresh apples from local farmers market mix of cortland and empire...great recipe...not too sweet...simple...served with vanilla ice cream

I'm rating this a 4 as it is so simple, yet impressive. I got the idea to add chopped fresh rosemary from another recipe on this site and it took this recipe up another notch. Don't roll the pastry too thin.

A very easy, very fast recipe that is sure to wow. I have made it a dozen times and it has never failed to amaze the crowd.

This is a showcase dish. I have a similar recipe for tomatoes, and it's really a way to let the best of the season shine. So use good apples, not tired old ones. Make sure the honey has a delicious flavour, because it adds a lovely twist. You could probably vary the dish by using different flavours of honey, in fact. There's not much to change to improve it; its strength lies in its glorious simplicity. My oven seems slightly hot though; next time I'll use a marginally lower temperature. Mine came out more brown than golden.

With both apples and honey, this is a perfect Rosh Hashana recipe. I made this in rectangles (no wasted dough), used gingergold apples and didn't manage to arrange the apple slices in very tidy rows. I did toss my apple slices in a little bit of lemon juice before putting them on the pastries to wait in the fridge until the last minute. Then I sprinkled on the sugar and butter and baked the tarts while we ate. They had a "rustic" look which, oddly enough, my dinner guests appreciated. And they were delicious!

I started making this recipe 2 years ago for Rosh Hashanah. My son ate the entire thing the first year so now I double it.

Good and easy. But I think the next time I will cook the apples in the butter with the sugar and then put it on the pastry, the apples turned out a little hard for my taste. But overall these tasted really good. The ice cream is a must. I also rolled it out just a bit and cut it into 6 pieces.

These are so simple to prepare, but look and taste as though they were very time-consuming. I like them as a light dessert, but love them as a brunch/breakfast pastry. For a breakfast pastry, I just cut the puff pastry into rectangles about the width of apple slices instead of making circles. This way the tarts are smaller, and your puff pastry goes further.

I made this in an 11 inch round tart pan and it came out okay, but the pastry isn't as light then. I also skip the butter and put applesauce on the puff pastry before putting the apples on for a healthier variation.

I've made this wonderfully simple recipe quite a few times now. As I like a thicker pastry base, I make two to three tarts per pastry sheet utilizing the whole pastry package. I get a better lift from the pastry, especially around the edges. Easy to make in advance and re-heat for guests. For me, the addition of ice cream is a must and I must try the cinnamon ice cream as other reviewers have suggested.

I made this for an improptu dinner for 8. I also made it smaller than the recipe states (6") and found that it was enough. Everyone loved it and thought we didn't even need the ice cream.

I liked it but thought the puff pastry is a little rich - so would make the servings smaller. Make 6 instead of 4. Also when halfway cooled- add raw sugar on top. Ice cream is a definite.

We served it with cinnamon ice cream and it was a great combination - - easy to make, yet elegant.

This is a very quick and easy dessert that can be assembled beforehand. I am not a great pastry/dessert chef and this comes out great every time.

This was perfect for a last minute no fuss dessert that presented well and tasted great. It is so easy you can actually do it again without even looking at the recipe.

I loved this recipe. I'm usually a terrible cook, but this was easy and delicious. It's great for beginner cooks.

A very good, easy recipe. I added crushed ameretti to the top of the puffed pastry before adding the apples. You can assemble tarts (I buttered mine before putting on the sugar - the opposite of the recipe) and refrigerate. Take them out, sprinkle with sugar, and bake. Serve with a good vanilla ice cream.

I needed a last minute dessert last night for guests and this was perfect. I just used a whole sheet of puff pastry, used cinnamon sugar and baked. I did not have any honey so I used caramel dip to drizzle over the tart, served w/ good vanilla ice cream and accepted the praises. Very easy to do, will try during the summer w/ peaches and @ Thanksgiving w/ pears. Perfect quick dessert.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I didn't want to go through the trouble of cutting the pastry into circles, so i just cut the puff pastry in half and made two rectangular ones. It turned out great. I also added cinnamon to give it additional favor.

Very quick and easy; tasty to boot!! My teen-aged son made this for a small dinner party, and everyone fought over the last crumb. We would definitely make this again, and we are going to try it with other fruits.

When I saw the ingredients in the recipe, I knew it would be a cinch! I was able to roll out the pastry dough and make 4 tart shells. I love it's simplicity. I'd like to experiment kinds of fruit. Can't wait to make it for my friends and family!

Excellent and easy. Will definitely make again although there was no way I could get 4 seven inch rounds out of 1 puff pastry sheet.
