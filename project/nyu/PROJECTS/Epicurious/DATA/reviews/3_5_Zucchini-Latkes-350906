I made this last night using a slightly overgrown zuke and it was delicious. I used parsley and oregano in place of marjoram and added minced white onion. They were a delicious side dish served with plain yogurt instead of sour cream (tell yourself it's sour cream right before you take a bite and it tastes exactly the same). Great option to feed my vegetarian friends.

Remember that when using zuke, the bigger ones hold more water. The center of the zuke where the seeds and membrane are is mostly water, so the bigger the zuke the more water you are likely to be dealing with. This is still easy to work w/ though. Just keep adding bread crumbs until the mixture sticks together in one big ball. If it still seems like they might not hold together, get a plate of flour and dip them it before you fry them. Now for my review- good recipe. I had a small carrot I shredded and added as well as minced onion. It was light and summery. Very good. The sauce I made was a little mayo, a little sourcream, and a squirt of wasabi paste. It adds a nice zing since the flavors are a little muted. I would make this again.

These latkes were a hit at Chanukah this year. This is my second year making these and they were tasty!! These Zucchini latkes are a great way to spice up your Chanukah menu!

Made these for Chanukah last night with moderate success! But it is true that this recipe does not hold the latkes together -- I definitely needed to add another egg for binding. It also helped to make the latkes bigger -- about 4 inches across -- and I fried them first for browning, and then baked them on a cookie sheet to make sure they really set.

You know, it kind is unfair dissing a recipe because of operator error. If they fall apart, next time try using a salad spinner to extract water from the fresh zucchini. Add more egg to bind larger batches. Play with it. THEN evaluate on the taste. Thanks.

Please be diligent about getting all the water out of the grated zucc - this likely determines whether they will hold together. Needs a flavor boost! Suggest adding ingredient(s) such as: onion, carrot, herb/spice OR an accompaniment like cilantro cream, caesar dressing on side. I could have gotten more out of my lovely homegrown if I hadn't chosen fried as cook method.

I was surprised to find this recipe here; my family has been making these for more than 20 years as a bastardization of the okonomiyaki a Japanese exchange student taught us to make. My mother does not salt the zucchini, but you do have to make sure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Also, my mother uses Italian style breadcrumbs to add flavor, and another egg or two, depending on how much zucchini you have to hold together (for us, usually depends on what comes out of the garden). I recently made some for some houseguests to get rid of extra zucchini from the garden. They gobbled them up and begged for more.

YUM! I used parsley instead of marjoram and they were great.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Like others, my latkes wouldn't stay together and I found that they had absolutely no flavor. I would consider mixing zucchini with other vegetables for next year, but I would find another recipe. This one stinks!

I have no idea what you could alter, but these could not (and would not) stay together. They kept on breaking. My friends ate I enjoyed eating the broken pieces (so the recipe was good) but it was just sad how only a couple really held together.

Grate up some onion and toss with the zucchini and make sure you don't skip the draining step. I usually add one of a variety of garlic-peppers I have on hand as well. I also use olive oil for frying these.

This is an interesting twist on traditional latkes, but I wouldn't make them again. I just didn't find them all that tasty, although they were definitely better once I ate some applesauce with them. One specific piece of feedback - I found them super salty. I'd recommend NOT adding the additional 1/2 tsp of salt when you combine everything together. Salting the zucchini adds more than enough saltiness - that additional 1/2 tsp was overkill.

To lskohn: Potato starch should work fine--but you need to use sufficiently less potato starch-- maybe only half (?) the amount of flour called for (so 2/3 C. potato starch). Too much potato starch will give them a gooey taste/texture which you certainly do not want! Also--make sure you do a good job of squeezing out the excess liquid after you salt and drain the zucchini--so you have less liquid to bind together.

I'll definitely try adding the carrot, potato and onion! Thoughts, please - I have a guest coming who avoids gluten. Is potato starch likely to be a sufficinet substitute for the matzo meal or bread crumbs?

I've been making a variation on these for years, called crispy vegetable latkes. My recipe uses potatoes, carrots, and onion in addition to the zucchini. It also calls for a small amount of matzo meal. I'm not sure that makes them Jewish, but they are good.

i make a variation on this all the time. I am Jewish. Is this "Jewish cuisine"? Hardly.

These are delicious! I did a test run for our early feast. I used thyme and Rosemary instead of marojam and used olive oil to fry them in. They turned out wonderfully! Even my 6 year old loves them, and getting kids to eat anything green is very difficult. I would highly recommend these as they are easy, quick, and tasty to make.
