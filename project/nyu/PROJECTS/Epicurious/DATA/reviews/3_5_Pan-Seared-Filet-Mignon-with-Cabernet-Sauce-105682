Grilled the filets, no shallots so I substituted minced white onion, and no cab so I used Montepulciano. Only added one tablespoon of butter at the end. Despite the unsettling color of the sauce (lovely purple), it was really tasty! Definitely adding to my recipe box!

The pan sauce is delicious! Used a good quality cote du rhone and whole grain dijon. Don't skip the capers -- they add an interesting flavor.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as written however I used mushrooms instead of capers (my kids hate capers) and they turned out FABULOUS! HOWEVER, the steaks did not taste as flavorful as they do when grilled and they were hard to get cooked through without overcooking the outsides. Next time I will grill the steaks and do the sauce in a separate pan.

I made this and followed the recipe to a T. It was a big hit. My boyfriend found it to be better than the same dish in some restaurants. For a side we did roasted baby red bliss potatoes and French beans. We did it on a Friday night after a long week. It was so good though, it felt as if it should have taken much longer to prepare.

I have made this many times and now prefer it without the capers altogether. I add some crumbled bacon to the sauce too and in addition to the wine reduction, I use some beef broth, to give the sauce a more please color and taste. Like the other posters have said, you must use a good quality cabnernet for the wine reduction. I love Justin California Cabernet and use it and for the drinking with the meal.

Quick and easy recipe with great results. I used half the butter called for and it turned out fine. Be sure to reduce the sauce and you will avoid the too winey flavor some reviewers commented on. This will be one of my go-to recipes.

Quick and simple and very good. I've made it several times and will again for dinner tonight. I like capers but didn't add them as my children aren't fond of them. For those who find it too buttery, taste the sauce before you add the remaining two tablespoons of butter - if you don't want more - don't add it. And as often said, bad wine, makes for a bad sauce and will ensure its sour. I've also made this by sauteing mushrooms with the shallots and the recipe is good with them as well. My sides potato croquettes or fries, salad of romaine or spinach (both with fruit & fresh parmesan), glazed carrots, green beans...hard to go wrong!

I made this recipe as directed, except per the recommendation of other reviewers, limited the amount of capers to just a teaspoon. I love capers, so thought I would enjoy this sauce, but I have to agree that it did not turn out as delicious as I anticipated. For my palette, it was altogether too buttery, a little sickly-sour, and had a funny pickled aftertaste (my husband, however, enjoyed it immensely). I agree with an earlier reviewer: perfectly seasoned fillets need no sauce. If I try this recipe again with the sauce, I will definitely leave out the capers, try to reduce the butter content, and see about adding some shallots/onions and/or mushrooms instead.

This was very good except, I think to get a medium filet took longer than 4 minutes per side. I didn't have cabernet so I used Shaoxing rice wine which was excellent. And I used chopped green olives in place of the capers. simple, delicious!

I made this tonight and it is to die for. I used a decent $14 bottle of Mondavi Cabernet and added some mushrooms and tarragon. Excellent sauce! Despite what other posters have said, Cabernet goes perfectly with meats...just use a good quality wine! I'd serve this in any of the restaurants I worked in ANYTIME!

Rating: 3
I felt a need to reiterate what previous posters have said. Bad wine makes bad sauce. I have ruined this recipe twice by using bad wines. Too much tannin, too much acid and you can throw it away. I think the capers are great, but optional. Any diced pickle-ish component will work. Used diced pickled zucchini last time with great results. Just had them around.

Simply seasoned steaks (salt and pepper) seared properly will rarely need any kind of sauce, and this recipe is no exception. I rarely rate anything terribly but this sauce was just that... terrible. I'll make the steaks again but without the sauce.

What a delicious sauce for steak! Do not be dismayed by the flavor of the sauce right out of the pan. At first, my boyfriend and I thought that we had sacrificed a good bottle of cabernet and I was about to scramble to make a different sauce. Luckily, I took that leap of faith and spooned it over our sirloin steak topped with sauteed onions. What a surprise! It was fantastic! The flavor was absolutely complimentary to the steak.

I made this dish exactly as specified, in terms of the sauce, and substituted our favorite skirt steak for the filet mignon. Used a very good Spanish cabernet and fine bulk-purchased capers from Sahadi (Brooklyn's answer to Zabar's and the Fairway). The result was perfectly acceptable, but not as satisfying to us as other preparations involving filet mignon (w/ vinegar and bleu cheese) or skirt steak (w/ shallots, tarragon & sherry vinegar). Despite our affection for capers, we will probably not make it again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is perfect for those looking for an easy but still gourmet and elegant way of preparing filet mignon. It is so simple that it can not go wrong and the flavors are fabulous!. I made it almost as listed with the following exceptions and the results were very good: I grilled the filets, before grilling I used kosher salt, black pepper and butter as a rub. For the sauce I used fresh onions and minced garlic (about 1 clove) instead of the shallots. If you like capers, use the whole amount listed on the recipe. I used capers from the Spanish brand "Goya" and they were just perfect.

This recipe was outstanding. Indeed, it was simple. I particularly liked the flavor that the capers added; very subtle, a bit of a piquant touch to a very well-balanced array of ingredients. I will definitely make this again!

Recipes like this are why I LOVE EPICURIOUS.COM!!! It's my "inspiration". I find a recipe that closely fits what I'm looking for and improvise where necessary. My husband and I just finished dinner and this one is a WINNER. I became concerned about my husband's reaction when he asked why the grill wasn't ready. I told him I had alternate plans because of the rain. He was sure I was going to ruin about $25 worth of meat...not only did he eat his words, he devoured his filet and some of mine, too!! This recipe is SO SIMPLE! I improvised dried onions for the shallots and "deli" mustard for Dijon, since I was out of both. Omitted the capers based on previous reviews and added a few sliced mushrooms I had left in the fridge. Was absolutely delicious and the sauce was great on the mashed potatoes I served. Also served a cold baby asparagus salad (Blanched and chilled baby aspargus with balsamic roasted garlic vinaigrette dressing.) This one's going in the recipe box.

Use GOOD Cabernet Savignon. Research it. Use it and save the rest for dinner. Get rid of the capers, they do not compliment good Cabernet/Bordeaux. Add a splash of port. If you use inferior wine to cook with (I don't care what school of thought one belongs to), don't trounce a recipe. 2 buck chuck don't make a good reduction sauce.

I just searched for this recipe so I can make it for dinner tonight. It's one of our favorite dishes for "date night" at home. It's spectacular tasting! It's also elegant without being too fussy. Though we like capers, I always make it without them and we like it so much that way I've been reluctant to add them in... maybe I'll break the mold and add "just a few". If you like to try filet mignon with a different twist, you'll probably enjoy this!

Excellent; my whole family liked this. My 11-year old rated it 10 out of 10. The cooks who found that their steaks weren't cooked enough when they followed the recipe may have had thick pieces of meat. Cook on one side until brown part way through, turn, and cook until meat juices just start to show through (don't push on the meat; that pulls the juices through faster) - that's perfect medium rare. By the way, I doubled the recipe for 4 people, and we finished it, but my family loves this stuff!

Okay, ever since I made this for my family on Valentine's Day, I have been dreaming about this filet! We went away the next day for a week and no restaurant could come close to a filet mignon like this. I didn't have cabernet so I used Merlot and it worked wonderful. Served this with Rolled Potatoe Dumplings, and Spinach and Pear Salad with a Strawberry Vinaigrette ( I made up the Strawberry Vinaigrette using the Citriuse vinaigrette recipe from this site) I also substituted fresh strawberries for pears being it was Valentine's Day. Ended the perfect meal with Tripple-Chocolate Fudge Brownies with homemade vanilla ice cream. Couldn't have done better even in a fancy restaurant. It was the best filet we ever had. I would have to say even better then grilled! Yummy!!!

This is great - the sauce makes it - It's wonderful! Ignore the controversy and use the capers in it too

Rating: 3
Outstanding and easy. Sure to impress. Not a big capers fan, so I left them out. Instead, I sauteed mushrooms in butter (in another pan) at the same time the filets were cooking. When the steaks were finished, I drained the liquid from the mushrooms, and dumped the cooked mushrooms into the steak pan along with the remaining ingredients. After that, it's just regular reduction to taste. Next time I'm using just a pinch of salt on the steaks before cooking. It doesn't need much more than that.

Maybe I am not a pro, but I had a hard time getting the filets to be done beyond rare, rare. The second time I made it, they ended up cooking at different rates and were done at different times. Definitely not for the inexperienced meat cooker.

This is a low-effort recipe that yields delicious, restaurant-quality results. I omitted the capers simply because I don't like capers, but this recipe was a big hit with my guests. Keep in mind that most filets will be more than the 4 ounces listed in the recipe. I didn't weigh mine, but I cooked them 6 minutes on each side, and they were still medium-rare.

My husband and I thought this was recipe too tart. Even after replacing the capers with green peppercorns. It was so acidic between the wine and the mustard. We added a little sugar so that it was edible, but we would not make this again. So, we are in search of a cabernet sauce, yet again.

This was certainly easy to make with minimal prep time. It wasn't bad. However, I did have an issue with the capers. They were drained thoroughly, but they made the sauce very salty. Next time, I would either halve or omit them altogether. Of course, if you really like capers, go with the recipe as published.
