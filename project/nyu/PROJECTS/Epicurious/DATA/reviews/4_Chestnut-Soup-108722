Made this soup as directed (except used pureed chestnuts from a can--all I could find). I thought it was just OK--even though I made it two days in advance. It was quite thin...I had hoped to dress it up a bit for my Easter first course with a swirl of cream, but it sank...and even a tiny piece of parsley sank as well.

Just made this for the first time. I love chestnuts. I am freezing half of it. Seems like it will freeze well because there's only a 1/4 cup of cream in it. I didn't have Sercial Madeira but I used Brandy instead (it was the only fortified wine I had on hand). It didn't seem to affect the flavor in a negative way, so I think any fortified wine will do. I like the suggestion someone made of using Sherry as well. I made exactly as listed, and I too thought it was a bit on the mild/bland side so I added 3-4 pinches of truffle salt. I also noted that the soup tasted better the second day, and I'm sure even better the third day. Lastly, this soup tastes much better when it isn't so hot. A warmer soup brings out the flavor of the chestnuts I found. Delicious!

I have made this soup quite a few times getting great compliments. I found these cooked and peeled chestnuts at a Japanese food store which makes this soup super easy to prepare. Another tip I have is adding heavy cream whipped with truffle oil! YUMM

I should note that we did this with fresh chestnuts (scored them and roasted for about 20 minutes at 425; peeling is a pain). We also left out the cream and Madeira, but I can't imagine they would do anything but improve it. We also didn't have parsley. So the point is: This soup is great even with a bare-bones version of the recipe.

I wholeheartedly agree with the cook from Tucson (an 06 review below) that this benefitted hugely from two full days in the fridge. It got thicker and the flavors deepened and rounded out. I wouldn't have served it on day one, but on day three it was a big hit as my Thanksgiving starter course. I made it exactly as directed.

I had this soup at my sister-in-law's hosue over Thanksgiving. WOW!! I was so impressed at this tasty soup, I had to have the recipe. I should have know that it came from Gourmet. I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner...to more rave reviews. We topped it with a bid of creme freche, which was a nice touch. This is soup is so flavourful and yummy. And, it's not difficult to make! Plan to make it a holiday tradition....

Delicious. Had a jar of chestnuts in my pantry that I found will I was putting in my newly purchased jars for the holiday. Decided to use it up in soup and glad I did!

Well I dont know what to say because I dont think this recipe is exceptional. But in all my years I have never had as many rave reviews for anything I have ever made.....Best feedback ever......Made the recipe a day ahead and reheated and added the cream before serving. garnished with chives

it was delicious and a huge hit. however after making exactly according to the recipe the consensus (from all of my taste-testers, you know the people that don't do anything except tell you what they would do differently) was that it was missing something as has been mentioned before. the flavor of the cloves did come through. rather than go in that direction a la the ginger that was suggested i went the more savory route. i first added some salt but then added ground sage (after all it is Thanksgiving) and some ground thyme. this really seemed to do the trick. i like to make a different menu every year but this recipe is a keeper and will definitely be put back into circulation.

This was easy to make and delicious. I used fresh, roasted chestnuts and dry sherry vice Madeira. With fresh breadsticks and salad a meal or a great first course on New Year's Eve.

Excellent recipe as is. Made this for Thanksgiving and three people have asked me for the recipe. The only things I changed were to use thyme instead of parsley, omitted the heavy cream and cooked it down about 20 minutes longer than suggested. Since it was going with a heavy T-day meal, I thought the heavy cream would be overkill. I used the vacuum packed chestnuts from the local Asian store. Only $1.99/5 oz. pack!

Honestly, it tasted like squash. It was very good, but just not what I expected. Followed the recipe exactly. It was easy. Used whole roasted chestnuts in a glass jar (excellent brand from france). Used Rainwater madeira. Let it rest over night. Over all disappointing because we all thought it tasted like squash soup. Good squash soup, but still.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. I still think though, and my boyfriend agrees, that it's missing something. We can't put our fingers on what. I followed the recipe exactly, but used fresh chestnuts that I boiled and peeled. I also made this the night before, to let the flavors meld. We ended up adding a touch of red pepper to the recipe day of, but I don't think that's it. Maybe a twist of lemon? Sugared ginger? I don't know. I'm not ready to give up on it yet, so I'll let you know.

OMG! Everyone loved this! I made it first at christmas and then several times since then and it's always a hit!

P.S. I used olive oil in place of butter---to add even more to the rich complexity of the flavor.

I substituted amaretto liqueur for the madeira---wonderful taste! I used frozen chestnuts (available in the winter months from Trader Joe's) which need only to be shelled; I've also made the soup by roasting the chestnuts myself. The flavor is complex, rich, subtle. There is some time and work involved, but it's well worth it, as this soup cannot be found on grocery shelves or in restaurants, and always gets rave reviews from guests!

This was delicious. Jarred chestnuts were not to be found so I used fresh that I halved and boiled for 25 minutes. Halving, not just scoring, was important as a good number of chestnuts have worms or mold inside. Boiling, as opposed to roasting, acheived a nice smooth texture.

blegh, this was so disappointing, especially after reading all the rave reviews. I love chestnuts and every other ingredient in this recipe, but for some reason it tasted totally blah to me. There was nothing interesting or particularly tasty about this recipe.

Yummy. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made it a day ahead (I think soup is better the second day.)

I just made a batch of this soup and it is truly divine; very simple in texture but with a flavor that is complex enough to create an amazing balance of "comfort food" and gourmet taste. I strained it through a fine sieve to get it as smooth as possible, and added 1/3 cup of cream instead of 1/4. I also used a 15 oz. can of chestnuts, which was definitely less than 3 cups but still seemed to be sufficient in the recipe, and substituted sherry for the Sercial Madeira. I look forward to seeing how the flavors develop in the next days, and making this soup again and again!

I tried this recipe, trying to immitate a soup I had in a really high end french restaurant. This recipe was almost spot on. A lot of work for what amounts to a thick broth, but so tasty.

This soup is outstanding! I didn't bother with the buttered paper, but otherwise followed the recipe. I've made it three times now. So unbelievably good!

I've always used fresh chestnuts before when cooking but the prep time is wearing-so for this recipe I found canned cooked chestnuts in water and used them. I made and refrigerated the soup several days before serving-easy. It looked rather delicate, thin and not too rich, a good start for a big meal. I found, though, that I didn't like the taste at all and considered not serving it. It was too thin and very bland, with no discernable chestnut flavor. Just to be sure, my husband and I sampled it the night before the dinner and it was 300% better, had a distinct deep, sweet chestnut background flavor and had thickened slightly. We served it after all and the guests loved it! My advice: Make it well ahead and let it sit in the refrigerator, knowing that every day, in every way, it's getting better and better.

This dish is outstanding. The earthy, nutty sweetness of the chestnuts really shines, the soup has great complexity, and the recipe is sooo easy!

I served this during the cocktail hour of our Christmas Eve dinner. I used small white cups, no saucer or spoon needed, and people went back to the tureen over and over. This will be a holiday (and maybe other times) staple. I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. I doubled the recipe and wish that I had tripled it so I would have leftovers.

Loved it, as did my guests- served it for Thanksgiving dinner. Made the mistake of thinking it would be a wonderful holiday idea to roast fresh chestnuts on an open fire and use those. While it did add a wonderful complexity to the flavor, i was up half the night before peeling them!

This was incredible. Strained it to make it extra fine. Topped with crab meat and a happy new year message in creme fraiche. Just don't tell them what it is until they try it.

I made this soup for "lunch-bunch" at work. All five of my coworkers asked for the recipe. I will be making a ton of it for Thanksgiving this year.

Delicious, elegant and comforting soup. Try purchasing chestnuts at Trader Joe's - they were only $ 2.99 for the jar! I would have liked some kind of garnish though - perhaps next time I'll try the version with lobster on this site! I also used Rainwater Madeira as I have never been able to locate Sercial.

I have made this recipe several times and always to rave reviews. No one can quite tell there are chestnuts in the soup since most people have not ventured into that area. I add 1 small peeled and diced celery root and skip the celery. The madiera is essential (I used Rainwater) and have used both freshly boiled and cleaned or jarred chestnuts. It's a great starter for a change and is worth the price of chestnuts. My husband loves the small amount of leftovers the next night!

I served this soup at my Christmas dinner last night and it received rave review from all--even my 10 year old son who, like Mikey, hates everything! I followed the recipe exactly, something I rarely do, and found the flavor to be subtle yet rich, and simply put, one of the best soups I've ever eaten. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious even before you add the cream. I substituted a 15.5 oz can of chestnut puree to save myself some time.

i made this soup with DRIED chestnuts and got superb results. this made the dish much less expensive to prepare--a good thing because i needed to double the recipe for thanksgiving. the nuts cost $4 at an italian specialty grocer, compared to $18 for packaged chestnuts. i used 3/4 lbs dried chestnuts pulverized in an electric coffee mill. i simmered the soup for an hour to make sure the nuts broke down. the flavour was very rich and had a smokey quality. everyone loved it. even the finicky cousins emptied their bowls

I made this last night, i couldn't find sercial madeira so I used rainwater maderia (also dry) I also increased the heavy cream to 1/2 cup. I found I needed to put the pureed soup through a sieve to get all the gritty bits out. The result was quite wonderful, a subtle soup with a mild chestnut flavor.

For those interested, chestnuts have only 27 grams of carbohydrates per 100-gram serving (not necessarily a typical portion size) making this fairly good for those diabetic low-carbers out there, like me.

I didn't use chestnuts in a jar or the Madeira. I roasted my own chestnuts and they were difficult to peel and inconsistent in flavor and texture which lent itself to a gritty texture in the soup. Otherwise the soup was delicious. Homemade chicken broth adds much more flavor and depth than the store bought.
