Oh, now I see why the rating is so bad. I read the reviews from two idiots who didn't see asparagus on the recipe for asparagus soup and knocked maple syrup on sausage... MMMMMMMM! Try it, it's great!

I can't believe this gets such a low fork rating! My girlfriend and I have been making this for 4 years and have never gotten a complaint. We use creme fraiche instead of sour cream and maybe some extra tarragon. We also don't bother with the melon or mint. Delicious. One of our favorites, and we don't fool around when it comes to cooking.

If you like aspargus, you will enjoy this soup. The leek and parsnips give it depth and make it a bit "homey". I used canaloupe for the melon balss and thought they were fine, not quite the "natural combo of maple sysrup on sausage, but the flavors worked well together.

J-kamps the asparagus is the 9th item down...the recipe calls for 2 lbs. of it.

Hey cook from NOLA first of all maple syrup on sausages is delicious and second of all did you even try the recipe? Don't knock it until you've tried it. BTW...brush up on your spelling. San Diego....the asparagus is there...read again.

This is STOOPID!!! What's wrong with you? Watermelon balls as a garnish for a soup? Maple syrup on sausages is bad enough but this is a whole another level of WRONG! Bleah!
