Bleh, I made this last night with gala apples, it had a weird taste to it. It should call for some nutmeg or cinnamon or something. I will alter it and try again. Though I must mention it looked gorgeous.

This was an incredibly easy recipe. Next time I will make the crust one inch larger in diameter, as it shrinks when baking. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Wow, this is definetly the best tarte tartin recipe I have used. It certainly recieves four forks from myself and guests. Added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom, used wine crisp apples.

I don't know, but this didn't turn out well for me. It looked good, but the apples were too tart and soggy and the crust was soft too. . . not very impressive tasting.

Excellent recipe! Easy with wonderful results. I used all Granny Smiths and squeezed a half lemon over the apples before cooking them. Added a wee bit more sugar to offset the tartness. Went around the pastry with a knife to loosen after baking and presto, it came right out. Family raved over the tarte, which I served with freshly whipped cream. A real keeper

I have used several recipes over the years for tarte tatin and this one is by far the best and the easiest (although mine looked nothing like the photo which appears to have a additional glaze on top.) I followed the recipe very closely -- I assume the process for cooking the apples is to assure a carmelized flavor and texture. Just add whipped cream on top! My family loved it!

This is so simple to make, the sisters Caroline and Stéphanie Tatin must never have imagined that over 100 years after making this delicious mistake it would still be pleasing so many people so far away from Motte Beuvron. Now that is immortality....Bravo les Tatin.

beautiful recipe... one note: mind the handle of the pan after you lay the pastry round... I instinctively grabbed it, forgetting it had been in the oven for 20 minutes, and scotched myself good...

wow!! this recipe is so simple! i used granny smith apples as recomended and it definitley was not overly sweet. a great recipe and very popular with the family.

This is a super easy "wow" dessert. My new favorite fast and impressive finish to a meal! I love fruit desserts/pies, and the puff pastry crust makes this one simple and yummy. Don't change the recipe. Follow it to a T.

A simple straightforward recipe for an excellent traditional French apple tart. I use Granny Smiths as I prefer the tartness of their flavor with the caramel. I also use small hard apples, rather than larger and possibly softer and watery ones. They hold their shape better in the tart, whereas softer fruit tend to cook down to mush.

Per other reviewers, I added some lemon juice to the apples. With this modification I didn't think the dessert was too sweet. A long recipie but simple. I will certainly make it again.

This tasted great. It was a little more involved than some Tarte Tatin recipes I've made before, but I liked the results, so I'll make again. I ended up needing 10 apples. Also, my cooking time for the initial carmelization was less--about 16 minutes. I also took out the pastry about 3 minutes early because it was already quite brown.

I have never had tarte tatin before, so my only measure for judging this one was how quickly my family gobbled it up. I would caution, however, that the instructions to cook the apples on the stovetop "until juices are deep golden and bubbling" is not very helpful - the juices will begin bubbling almost immediately. Wait until the juices are fairly viscuous (this requires close watching so that they don't burn). Otherwise very delicious and very easy.

I make Tarte Tatin all the time. The problem with this recipe is that puff pastry is NOT the correct dough for this tarte. Stephine Tatin would roll in her grave thinking of what happened to her "mistake" from 1888. The proper dough is a variation of pate brisee. Grimod

Rating: 2
I found this to be a little bland, although, what's not to like about puff pastry with anything? I would make it again, based on the other reviews, because I really don't think I let it carmelize enough on top of the stove. I would also add a splash of Calvados, cinnamon, etc. to add SOMETHING to it.Time consuming, but easy.

Since first having an AUTHENTIC French Tarte Tatin in Paris 7 years ago, it has become my most favorite desert and I have been in search of a recipe that could match what I experienced in Paris. Well this is THAT recipe!! I've made this recipe so many times since finding it, I now know it by heart. I serve it warm with Creme Fraiche, just like in France!! C'est manifique!

My friends almost keeled over with this tart. I let it cool down and as the recipe directed, I then heated it back up. It was even better when the juice had had time to seep into the crust. Served the tart with a whipped cream with a bit of cointreau...people have been asking for the recipe for weeks now.

This is by far the best tarte tatin recipe I have tried, and I tried many. To the cook who found it cloying, try adding less sugar. That's what I do. I use Royal Gala apples as that's what's available here in France, and I soak them in a bit of lemon juice first. To the cook who found the tart too liquidy, try experimenting with the amount of butter you use. I have found the right amount to use in proportion to the size of my tatin pan, and it always comes out fine.

After years of reading reviews, I am finally ready to write one, because this recipe has several problems. (Yes, I made it.) First, Gala apples are very sweet, so this tart is cloying. If you want to use Galas, you should cut them with another type, such as Granny Smith. Second, many cooks only have access to Pepperridge Farm puff pastry, which is made with vegetable shortening and therefore tastes like nothing. There's no point in peeling all those apples just to toss on a piece of bland pastry. If you can't buy puff made with butter, just make your own crust, something simple. So, different apples, different crust: different recipe. Search for "tarte tatin" and you'll find several good options.

Apart from substituting pears for apples, I followed this recipe exactly--and it was incredible. No need for ice cream or whipped cream, just the tart, trust me. One caution: whether due to my overripe pears or some other mystery, when I flipped the tart, caramelized juice oozed everywhere and made a big mess. Next time I'll turn it out onto a platter, instead of a small, flat cutting board. Despite the mess, the caramel/juice was lickably delicious.

I liked (not loved) this tarte when I made it last night, but I admit it was entirely my fault. I used a nonstick pan instead of cast iron, thinking the tart would slip out easier. But I feel like the apples came out with a slight chemically taste. I would definitly make this again just next time with cast iron. Thought it was very easy to make - just make sure to keep the sugar at a high enough heat for it to carmelize. Watch it carefully during the carmelization period and it should come out perfect

Ick. What a mess. When mine came out grey-brown and wet, I went back to Julia Childs' recipe to see what went wrong here. I think she has the right idea in exuding the apple juices first by letting them soak with some lemon juice before starting. She also carmalizes the sugar before adding the apples. Since this recipe skipped those steps there was WAY too much water/apple juice for the sugar to carmalize. I will go back to her methods.

I have made this 7-8 times in the last 2 months. One occassion I added 1 Tlbsp. of Orange Juice and 1 Tblsp.Lemon Juice to the mixture and this gave it a subtle freshness. Will do this again in the future. Highly Recommend this recipe. Very Easy.

After a few times of trial and error, we were able to get this right. You have to keep an eye on the sugar, and don't let it burn. We tried it with d'Anjou pears instead of apples too, and it was really nice. Used Pepperidge farm puff pastry sheets, which were very easy to use.

Cinnamon? Is this a French dessert, or an American apple pie? Do not add cinnamon to your tarte Tatin, my friends. Enjoy the tarte and the lovely caramelised apples as it is, enjoy its simplicity and its French heritage. Save the cinnamon for another day.

I failed miserably by walking away in the last few minutes from the first 20 minutes of stovetop cooking, and I burned the sugar. I finished the recipe anyway and could tell it would be amazing if I hadn't screwed up early on. Watch that sugar simmer!

It was absolutely delicious!! My french teacher spoke about her favorite dessert being tarte tatin so we decided to make it for her and she loved very well received!! And very easy to make.

Very good and surprisingly simple. Pay attention to the instruction about standing the apples on their ends -- I mistakenly put them on their round sides (the photo misled me) and therefore used fewer than recommended; the tarte was fine anyway but would have been better if I'd followed the recipe. Using DuFour brand puff pastry, you don't need to roll it out and will use just over half the package, which seemed correct. I made one tarte in a cast iron pan and one in a nonstick (oven-safe of course) pan; the results seemed the same.

I've made this at least 4 times, and it is always great. The past 2 times I've added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the sugar, and it makes a darker, richer caramel. The trick to buttering the pan is to melt the butter, then pour it in and coat the sides about 1/2 inch up. Set it aside and swirl it once in awhile while it solidifies. Then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. This makes the butter very uniform.

Everybody loved this - even my husband who does not really like apple pies\tarts... I have made it at least three times now... so easy! You have to try this!

Rating: 4
Awesome! After making it once, I used 1/2C brown sugar instead of white and sprinkled the apples with just a bit of cinnamon. The brown sugar creates a thicker carmel and better taste. I've also used a mixture of Gala, Northern Spy, Cortlands and Ida Reds with much success.

THE RECIPE YOU SHOW SEEMS WELL BALANCED.ONE OTHER REVIEW TELLS ABOUT COGNAC (!),I HAVE ABOUT SIX RECIPES FOR TARTE TATIN,AND NONE OF THEM TALKS ABOUT COGNAC.SOMETIMES CHEFS HAVE A MANIA TO HAD TO TIME OLD RECIPES...ONE OF THE WORST MANIAS I KNOW...I THINK THE TATIN SISTERS WOULD BE VERY PLEASED!!ALTHOUGH FROZEN PUFF PASTE IS TOO MODERN !!

Lacks the cognac that authentic tart tatin would have. In Paris one can get drunk from one piece. I also would like it to be a little more tart. We don't have access to the French apples, but the gala apple was a good substiute.

After placing the apples in the skillet, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg and cinnamon.

I make a variation of this recipe a lot. Carmelizing the butter and sugar first is a nice improvement; just melt the butter in the pan on the stove, add the sugar, and cook until a deep carmel color (don't overcook or will taste burned). Add the apples and cook on stove until apples soften. THEN, for the piece de resistance, roll out a tube of marzipan to a ten inch circle, place on top of apples, then put puff pastry dough on top of that. Pop in the oven to bake, and follow directions as per the original recipe. The carmelized sugar and marzipan rally make it special.

I couldn't believe how easy this was. Since I didn't have a cast iron pan, I used my non stick Calphalon 10" skillet. It worked perfectly. This tasted just like the ones we ate in Paris. Thank you!

My family and I were really surprised. This smelled, looked and tasted like a French bakery pie. It is a perfect blend of apples, butter and sugar encased in a puff pastry. We love it so much and it's so easy to prepare, I serve it frequently as a side dish with meals.

This was the best apple pie I have ever made - it actually looked and tasted like something from a good French bakery. I followed the recipe closely with the exception of substituting filo dough for pastry dough. I thought this would be a disaster - but it crisped up wonderfully and turned a beautiful golden brown. Gourmet outdid itself on this one. It's very easy too.
