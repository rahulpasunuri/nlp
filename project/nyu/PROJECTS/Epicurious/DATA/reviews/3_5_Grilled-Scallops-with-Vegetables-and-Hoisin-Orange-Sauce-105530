Very good. Like other reviewers, I served this over a small bed of angel hair pasta. I also doubled the chili garlic sauce and the fish sauce since we like Asian flavors here. The sauce is probably 8 times what is needed, so half or quarter the recipe and you'll still have plenty left over, which is great because it's quite tasty. I plan to use it on a pork tenderloin tomorrow night.

I will never make this again, ruined 8 beautiful scallops. Should have just used olive oil while grilling. The dressing was not very good. The sauce for the slad lacked a lot also. The maranade was just too much much. Oh well live and learn.

This dish was okay. The sauce is too strong for the scallops, and the salad was blah (perhaps b/c we can't get watercress where we live and sub. spring mix). Might try this again with angel hair pasta as previously suggested and skip the salad.

I also made this as a main course and enjoyed it but I have enough sauce for 4 more meals. I plan to grill porkchops and use some of this sauce but you either need to plan ahead or cut the recipe in half if you don't want waste.

Used as an Hors d'ouerve. Good, but needs sauce on scallops for flavor. Makes a lot of sauce.

I thought that this dish was absolutely fabulous. Will definitely make it again!! The dinner guests requested the recipe.

This recipe was great. I added angel hair pasta which I used as a bottom layer, then field greens instead of watercress for the middle layer, then the scallops on top and finished with the hoisin mixture for a dressing. It tasted exactly like one of my favorite dishes at a local vietnamese restaurant and made a light, satisfying meal.

This was a very light and delicous meal. I served this as a main course, both my husband and daughter requested this again.

This was a waste of beautiful scallops. Not hard to make but the oriental flavors just totally overcome the natural sweetness of the scallops.

I was impressed with this extraordinary dish. Everything had a lot of flavor and made one wish for a bigger belly- which is always the best indication of a well made meal. 3.7 Forks

This was great, but as I am one of those people who love to taste rather than sit down to a big meal - this was the main course! Yum!

This was GREAT!!! I served as a main. Most can be made ahead.

Excellent recipe especially the sauce which can be used on any fish or poultry maybe even pork. I made the full recipe for 2 of us as a main course and served it with a quinoa side dish. The sauce recipe makes about 1 1/2 cups so you could halve it if you don't want leftovers.
