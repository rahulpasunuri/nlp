I made the recipe exactly as written and both my husband and I thought it was delicious!

I agree with the other reviewers. However, when doubling the spices, I suggest not doubling the cardamom. It seems to overpower the other spices. Honey worked well as a substitute for sugar. We used couscous and found it to be a good complement to the lamb.

I would have given 3.5 but since we can't do half forks. :( Anyway, I think this recipe is great because it allows for easy adjustment of spice and flavor. I tweaked, but didn't change, the recipe. I actually did toss the lamb with the spices and 2 T of flour which worked great for 3 pounds of cubed lamb. I also added chickpeas as suggested and substituted honey for sugar since I have a tagine recipe like this that utilizes honey and I think it's a lovely flavor instead of just sugar. After 45 minutes of low, low, low simmer, I added a little bit of beef broth for flavor (low sodium) and adjusted the seasonings by adding 1/4 teaspoon more of everything. I served it over toasted Israeli couscous with slivered almonds, saffron and a little turmeric for colour. Overall lovely.

My luck with epicurious is so consistently good that when I stumbled over this recipe my first worry was a technical mistake on my end. My wife actually got up and made a PB&J. Here are some thoughts - 1) There are a lot of strongly aromatic spices here, and balancing them may be a problem. (What are the chances that the 2:2:2:1 for cardamom/cinnamon/cayenne/clove is spot on?) I found it a little over bearing and a little bitter as well, so ended up leaning hard on the sugar at the end and adding some raisins as well as the chick peas to try and mellow the sauce. 2) One thing I'd recommend is, after coating the lamb in spices, tossing the pieces in flour as well. There's plenty of moisture left on the lamb after the spice rub, and the flour makes for much nicer browning early on and sauce body later on. Good luck, I'll probably not do this one again.

This was great, and incredibly well-recieved by guests. To make it easier (and cheaper) next time, I would just buy precut cubes of stewing lamb and use that instead of the semi-inscrutable description used in the recipie of the kind/cut of meat (which I guess would make more sense if I actually had access to a real butcher). I used the spices to toss the lamb in the measurements called for, but near the end of cooking it needed more flavor, so I added another round of cinnamon, cloves and chipotle pepper (which I used instead of cayenne for its lovely smokiness) -- but not cardamom, as that flavor stood out already. I would absolutely salt the lamb before tossing next time, as I think it would have helped the lamb absorb the flavors and become tender more quickly. Like others, I did add approx 1/2 to 1 additional cup of liquid in the last half hour, but I used red wine (cab sav) instead of water, which was a nice addition. I also upped the amount of apricots (use the extra fancy kind, the concentrated flavor is worth the extra cost), and used both red and white onions. I served it with the suggested rice dish, which was great, and a side of garlic toast dusted with Penzey's Northwoods spice mix (the smokiness of Northwoods again complimented the lamb dish). I finished the meal with the chocolate zucchini cake also on this site, which was spectacular!

I'm pretty much a novice with this whole cooking thing, and this dish still came out great when I made it. I followed the suggestions to add chickpeas and I think that made a great addition and gave it more substance (and more protein). I think next time I might leave out the sugar because I found the dish a bit sweet, but I'm not sure whether this would actually be an improvement. I also added the apricots a little early like someone suggested and they came out rather soft, which I liked but some people might not. I also used more of the spices (but in the same ratio) than the recipe called for, maybe about twice as much, and it was kind of spicy but in a good, flavorful way. Anyway, overall quite delicious!

Had 1 1/4lb meat left after deboning a 2lb lamb shoulder roast. Used 2 onions and kept all the other ingredients as stated. Added 1/2 cup dried chickpeas soaked overnight as suggested. This was delicious although it was not a hearty stew as I had expected. Served with saffron-cardamom rice and spinach braised in milk. Very good.

If I didn't triple the spices I am not sure that this recipe would taste like anything other than lamb and onion. But, with the extra spice, it was wonderful. I also added some extra apricots for good measure.

Pretty good, we quite enjoyed it. Would up the spices a bit next time, but the proportions were great. Needed to add a lot more water, as it really cooked off. Added the apricots about 10 miniutes before called for so as to let their flavor permeate. Also added the chickpeas as suggested, it really made the dish come together. Served with plain rice the first time, and the Saffron-Cardamom Rice the second. The second was much better, really made for a nicely complex dish. Next time, I'm going to try couscous prepared in the same manner.

A wonderful dish that I would give four forks as a rating, except that the guide lists a four-fork rating as "a dish beyond compare." Delicious, sweet, spicy, and hearty but not heavy. It can be simmered longer if desired to increase the tenderness of the lamb and mixing of flavors (don't boil it!). The recipe calls for one cup of water, but I added one and a half, then about another half a cup fifteen minutes before serving. Since it's not a true "bowl stew," this is best paired with a grain over which you can serve it. The cardamom-saffron rice suggested worked admirably, to compliments all around from our dinner guests.

I love complex lamb or beef stews, especially those calling for dried fruits. This sounded like a quicker version of a lamb tagine which I make with figs, prunes & apricots. Having all the ingredients on hand, I used this recipe as the foundation for dinner last night. A few modifications to enhance the richness and complexity of the sauce - adding some chopped shallot in place of some of the onion, adding garlic at the same time as the ginger, and using a tablespoon of honey instead of a tespoon of sugar. I did cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp and found the dish spicy enough to my heat-tolerant taste, while not putting of my more mildly inclined husband. A longer simmer at the end, (about 30 minutes) while a prepared a side dish of kasha varnishkes, produced a thick and aromatic sweet/hot sauce. Am having the leftovers for lunch right now.....delish.

My husband would have preferred this dish a little spicier (meaning hot!), but it was our general opinion that it was very flavorful and hearty. We like asian/mediterranean flavors, and I felt that the spices blended well together. I added chickpeas as suggested by Keith from the Isle of Mann, and they went perfectly with the stew. Served with the suggested rice dish, but I felt that the sweetness of the stew was enough, without needing the additional sweetness of the raisins in the rice. Could have served with a saltier accompaniment.

A wonderful recipe; very tasty. Great with the suggested rice recipe. The stew is very flavorful and spicy. Don't be afraid of the spices the recipe calls for--I found the amounts to be just enough. I will definitely make this again.

I thought it was, at best, interesting. My family hated it. I did alter the recipe a bit by cutting in half the "spicy" ingredients, but the taste was still overpowering. The flavors just did not blend well. Also, a word of warning to the new cook, cardamom is a very expensive spice with a very distinctive flavor...I wouldn't advise buying this spice unless you are familiar with its taste.
