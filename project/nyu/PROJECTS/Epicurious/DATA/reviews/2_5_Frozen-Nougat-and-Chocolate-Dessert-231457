This was a HUGE hit!!! I made it for work months ago and people STILL ask when I'm going to make it again. The blend of textures is amazing, and the rum flavor is just perfect. I'm planning to show it off at my next family event!

I made this based on the 4 fork rating (I only now discovered no one has reviewed this recipe so where do these forks come from?) and my love of semi-freddo which this closely resembled from the ingredients but I was terribly disappointed with the results. The rum taste "sat on top" and never really blended into the flavour and all in all it was bland (except for the rum which was overwhelming). I love nougat and chocolate but taste of the former never made it through. Never to be made again I am afraid!
