I just returned from Barcelona where I had this at several restaurants. My favorite place was a Michellin 2 star restaurant where they put the toasts, garlic, olive oil and tomatoes for guests to prepare fresh themselves. It was fun and very yummy. High quality olive oil is a must. We served the same way to guests as an appetizer and everyone loved it. This is a very authentic recipe and will definitely do again.

Excellent - just like Barcelona, except when I make it at home it is possible to enjoy the bread while it is still hot.

Had this north of Barcelona 10 years ago and it's a quintessential Catalan starter. Amazing. An alternative to rubbing the tomato directly across the bread is to grate the tomato into a rough pulp and spoon or brush it on. Same effect. One other thing not mentioned in the recipe is something we loved in Spain - some places will set out best-quality anchovies with the dish and you can lay one or two across the bread, atop all the rest. Kicks it up a notch.

This is a prime example of how amazing good, simple ingredients can be. My husband and I make this whenever we want an interesting alternative to garlic bread. It's also great as a snack alongside a glass of Spanish red wine.

This is what they serve at an amazing restaurant on the island of Mallorca, and I didn't know how to duplicate it until I found this. Delicious!

Delicious and SO simple - we've been doing this for a couple years - my husband just made this as part of a grilled dinner for me the other night - yum!
