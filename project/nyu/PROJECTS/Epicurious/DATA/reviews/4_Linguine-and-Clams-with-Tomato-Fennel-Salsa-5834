This was not really what I think it is meant to be. I cooked the linguine separately but I think the fennel, onion and tomato needs to be fried in olive oil to soften it and give it better flavor.

I think there's a typo or some verbiage missing here. It doesn't seem possible to cook the pasta WITH the tomato mixture that has since been removed from the heat. Go with your instinct and cook the pasta separately adding it to the rest at the end. Nice, nice flavors and so very light.

Wow! So glad I discovered this recipe. Will definitely make it again and again. Didn't have basil so substituted fresh parsley. Used a dry Reisling for the wine-fabulous. Don't eliminate the orange peel. It is definitely a key ingredient. Cooked the linguine to al dente then added to the salsa mixture to heat through with the clams.
