I still think this is one of the best gingerbread recipes on the planet. I not only make this as muffins but also in a loaf pan. And I always get asked for the recipe.

I added freshly grated nutmeg (1tsp), extra ginger powder and replaced 1/3 cup of the cold water with bourbon. I also added freshly grated ginger to the lemon glaze and it was fantastic. Experimentation gone well.

turned out great for me- added some allspice, substituted some brown sugar for the white, and 1 cup buttermilk with 1/3 cup cold water. also loved the lemon glaze. super light and moist.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but too sweet. I think of muffins as being less sweet than a dessert like gingerbread, and this recipe tasted just like gingerbread. So if I ever made them again, I would cut back on the sugar. I didn't make the glaze so I can't comment on that.

Incredibly light and fluffy. As others I subbed plain yogurt (didn't have buttermilk) and water for all the water, added fresh grated ginger and some grated apple just for fun. Subbed brown sugar for regular. I think it's a versatile recipe but moist and light no matter what. The lemon glaze is a zingy must-do!

Fantastic muffins! Super-fluffy and flavorful with a few alterations: 1) Used 2 TEASPOONS ground ginger, but then grated a pile of ginger and squeezed out 2 tsp. ginger juice (so no one had to chew on ginger strings) - added to the buttermilk. Nice, but I think I'd use a full Tbsp ginger juice next time. 2) Used 1 c low-fat buttermilk + 1/3 c. water. 3) Added 1/8 tsp allspice and 1 tsp vanilla extract. 4) Made mostly mini-muffins - 10-11 min baking time was perfect. Also made a few full size for my boys' afternoon snack - 20 min was perfect for those. 5) For glaze, used one cup powdered sugar with the juice (~2 Tbsp) and zest of one small lemon. Perfect - fresh and lemony.

The muffins were very tender. The flavor was somewhat muted. I only had 12 muffin pan so I baked the remainer as a small cake in a 4" casserole dish. On that one, I added crystalized ginger to the top before baking. I thought that zinged them up nicely. I liked the lemon glaze, though there sure was a lot on the foil rather than the muffins, I hate waste. I prob won't make again but if I did I would include stirring in some crystalized ginger to the batter before baking.

I don't like to give the appearance of being negative, but these muffins reminded me of something from the local grocery store, and the glaze reminded me a bit of, well...bile. It just didn't go with the muffin. A cream cheese icing with tidbits of candied ginger might have made all the difference in the world, though. All in all, I won't be making either the muffins or the glaze again... :-(

Muffins looked pretty, but weren't anything special. Followed some of the suggestions (brown sugar instead of white, added some allspice). I also subbed maple syrup for some of the molasses (not a big molasses fan). I didn't glaze the muffins either. So they could be better w the original recipe, but mine turned out too doughy and the flavor wasn't anything special.

Rating: 0
Very good muffins. I substituted the buttermilk (1 c) plus 1/3 water, added vanilla, and added some allspice. I also could not find light molasses, so used dark. I think it would be better with a lighter taste. I also grated fresh ginger, which I think is important for "real gingerbread." I had some ginger "man" muffin pans. If you use these need to sit in these type of pans a long time as this is more a cake-type muffin and I lost a few arms :) I see no need for the glaze...unless you are serving on own, perhaps for a tea. These are a very original muffins and could be served as a dessert or tea as easily as breakfast/brunch. They would be lovely in mini bundt pans, perhaps then with the glaze. Could even see a dollap of whipped cream or creme fraiche alongside.

I thought these were simply divine. I left the recipe as is. I thought the tarty sweetness of the lemon glaze offset the gingerbread quite nicely. I'll definitely make this one a keeper!

Very good, 'light' muffins, do rise high. Made 12; left out cloves; ordinary molasses. Plenty of ginger flavour, make sure your..dried...ginger is somewhat fresh. Adding chopped candied giner is a great idea! And so skip the glaze. Maybe sprinkle a bit of sugar *granulated) mixed with lemon juice before baking, but that's it. Also could leave maybe 1/3 or 1/2 the water out and make a quick bread. Mmm...

I really liked the muffins and only changed the following: Added 2 Tbsp ground crystalized ginger with 1 tsp ground ginger, used 1 c buttermilk, 1/3 c water. Made lemon glaze with less juice, a little milk and 1 t lemon zest. Great!!

Rating: 3
Made 12 huge muffins using "Fancy" molasses, 1 cup buttermilk and 1/3 cup water and 1 Tbl ground ginger and mixed 1 Tbl grated fresh ginger into buttermilk. For glaze used 1 cup icing sugar with 2 Tbl fresh lemon juice and zest of 1 lemon - perfect amount and taste; poked a few holes in the tops with a skewer to allow more glaze to soak in. 20 minutes baking was just right.

Rating: 2
I would make it again but I would be adding more ginger and cloves.... I could barely taste it. Maybe some raisins or shavings of ginger too. But overall its ok. At first I was worried because most muffins recipes your not supposed to over mix. And it was really gooey getting it into the tins but it turned out to be the best rising muffins I've had ever! Oh also I only used 2tbl of sugar and it turned out fine.

Delicious - nice light texture. I'll cut back on the ginger next time. It was a little too much for us. We tried one with the glaze, but preferred them without it. I got 2 dozen cupcakes from the recipe.

Rating: 3
Very delicate texture, lemon glaze very nice but I used juice of 1 and a half lemons, and 3/4 cup powdered sugar. Very nice served warm with cream or caramel sauce or vanilla custard. Has a stronger ginger flavour when cold and is very nice with just butter. I misread the recipe and only put 2 TBSP sugar which seemed to make no difference, I also cut the water down to only 1 cup. I used golden syrup rather than molasses which is not available in New Zealand.

These muffins are wonderful! They are quick, easy and moist, and the glaze (I only use half) adds a nice zing. It makes 20 generous muffins that bake in 15 minutes, not 25.

This was a big hit at my office. Like others that have reviewed this recipe, I used regular molasses as I could not find the light kind. Turned out great. Used dark, nonstick muffin tins so I didn't have to butter the pan. All came out in one piece. Completely baked through in 18 minutes, not 25 and you could definitely cut the lemon glaze recipe in half as there was a lot left over. Recipe made over 25 medium sized muffins.

These are outstanding, I did adjust the glaze, due to other comments. I gave them to friends, they all wanted the recipe.

These muffins are delicate, and I agree with several other reviewers that the glaze proposed is too strong. I tried this one with success: 1 1/3 c. powdered sugar, 3 T. sour cream, 1 T. maple syrup, 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. vanilla (I used Mexican), and 1/2 tsp. grated lemon peel. Glaze the muffins when cool. YUM!

Rating: 4
Delicious, Delicious, DELICIOUS! Changes I made to the muffins: 2% milk instead of water, fresh grated ginger, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and brown sugar instead of regular. For the lemon glaze I added a little more lemon than suggested, as well as minced lemon and crystallized ginger. I only had a 12-muffin tin, so I filled each cup to the top and that used all of the batter. Needless to say I had nice fat muffins. I also didn't use an electric mixer, because I prefer not to use electronics, and that worked out fine too. I tried spooning the icing on the hot/warm muffins, and as has been stated, it ran off. So what I ended up doing was using a paintbrush to paint a double layer of icing over each muffin, and then when I served them I poured it over them with a spoon, letting it run off in four directions. It worked great. As to taste: These were THE MOST DELICIOUS muffins I have ever had! I was dancing about the kitchen in ecstasy. I gave one to my dad, who basically scarfed it down--and he dislikes muffins! These muffins are HEAVEN and a smash. Make them!

I made these yesterday, and they were fabulous warm from the oven, and equally nice when cooled. I replaced 1/3 cup of the water with buttermilk and thought the texture was perfect. I did not care for the lemon glaze...may try another lemon glaze next time, but truly, after tasting one with the glaze, I tossed the remaining glaze and left them unglazed. Everyone who tried them thought they were lovely as is.

I was really excited about this recipie when I saw all of the reviews. I made these for my team after they had worked really hard on a demo. I thought this would be a good treat. They appreciated the effort, but they were disappointed in the result. They were a bit dry and lacking in flavor. The glaze was just so-so, nothing spectacular

Rating: 3
These muffins tasted great, but they truly were "tender" which is not usually a quality I look for in a muffin. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used some fresh grated ginger in addition to a bit of dry powdered ginger. I did appreciate the fact that they weren't overly sweet. (The lemon glaze obviously changes that.) I would probably make these again, but I'd have to be in the mood for a flimsy muffin instead of a i'm-running-out-the-door-and-need-a-breakfast muffin.

This recipe for gingerbread was average i would say.It was extremely moist, but I think it could have used a bit more sugar(about half a cup). My boyfriend and i did eat 3 a piece in one evening though.I will make it again simply because you really can't beat how quick and easy it is to make and how well they turn out.

These were great! My boys and I just made these for breakfast this am. Very easy, moist, and yummy! The lemon glaze is a must poured right over the warm muffins. It is messy, but just soaks right in and adds a nice zing to the sweet muffin. I used milk in place of water for added calcium and used half whole wheat pastry flour/ half all purpose flour. Also added turbinado sugar on top of muffins before baking for a nice sweet crunch! We are muffin "addicts" here and if there are others out there, get a muffin top pan...they have them at bakerscatalogue.com. There's nothing better than all " muffin top"... the best part!!!! We will add these to our "regulars".

I LOVE IT. This recipe is not only good as muffins, also makes a great gingerBREAD, i made them in muffin and loaf tins. Perfect!. Except i substituted less of the sugar for raisans, and for the lemon glaze, i learned this in cooking class, that all you need is about 1/4 cup water, 2 tbsp to 4 of lemon juice and about 1/3 cup sugar, yummy, it tasted like lemonade alone. yummy. i loved it and so did my fellow classmates. I will definetly make these muffins and loaves again.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use dark molasses. I followed the recipe to the letter, even the water, and these came out delicious. I didn't even bother with the glaze, and they were still delicious.

Rating: 3
I love gingerbread, and this is basically gingerbread cooked in muffin tins. Used dark molasses, as that was all I had. I ignored the glaze proportions - added enough confectioners' sugar to the juice and zest of one lemon to make a thick glaze, in which I dipped the cooled mufins. This icing, like all lemon icings, intensified with age and lent a lovely kick to each bite. Very yummy, but more dessert than breakfast!

Rating: 4
I made these for the open house I did for my son's first birthday/holiday get-together and everyone raved about them. One thing I learned is that if you premake the muffins with the intention of putting the glaze on later (so you can store them easier) you have to reheat the muffins to get the glaze to set.

AAAAmazing muffins! Incredibly soft and tender -even the next day. I took the advice of others and also used buttermilk in place of water, and added more spices - extra cinnamon and some nutmeg and allspice (maybe 1/4 tsp of each). As well I used 1 Tbl of fresh ginger and 1 Tbl of dried. We omitted the lemon glaze and sprinkled the tops with turbinado sugar before baking to give a nice sweet crunch. Next time I would not change a thing!!

Ver tast muffins. I added the fresh ginger as suggested (better to grate this rather than mince with a knife, as grating gets in all the juices), substituted whole milk for the water and added a generous amount of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.

They were good basic muffins. Good light and fluffy texture. Next time I might add a bit more spice, a bit more cinnamon or some vanilla or something, or maybe some raisins. The lemon glaze really perks up the flavor for me, but maybe that's just because I love lemons.

I have to say, that I usually agree with most of the postings/reviews, but I must strongly dissent. I made these for a very special brunch and had I had time would have pitched them, dashed to the bakery for replacements. I followed the recipe and cannot imagine what went wrong. I think my guests were too polite to be honest, but curiously, no one requested a recipe!

This was good. I used some of the earlier suggestions such as substituting 1 c. buttermilk and 1/3 c. cold water,used 1 1/2T ground ginger and 2 t. grated fresh ginger. The best suggestion was to add raisins. I added LOTS of golden raisins which made the muffins so sweet and moist. Also I made these as minis and baked for about 13 minutes. I used another lemon glaze and just dipped the tops of the muffins into the glaze while they were warm. It gave the tops a very nice sheen.

I thought the recipe was great. I ran into some problems and it still turned out fine. I ran out of all purpose flour so I used whole wheat flour for most of it. It called for mild flavoured light molasses, but ended up using dark molasses. All these did not change the recipe at all. For the glaze you were supposed to make it lemon but not only did I not have the stuff to make the lemon glaze, I don't like lemon all that much. This is the glaze that I made up: I used milk, vanilla, powdered sugar, and ginger ( I guessed at all the measurements. My only problem with the recipe was that it only made 12 muffins, instead of the alloted 16. I will make this again and again because I think this is the best muffin recipe I've ever had. Next time I make it though I am going to add some crystallyzed ginger to the batter.

These are light and tasty. The recipe made 24 muffins for me, and I only needed to bake them for 19-20 minutes. Next time I would add raisins and maybe cut back a little on the sugar. I like the contrast of the lemon glaze, and I think it helps to keep them moist.

These muffins were excellent! made them for Thanksgiving breakfast and will definitely make again. Took other cook's recommendations and used fresh grated ginger instead of powdered; 1 c. buttermilk, 1/3 water and added lemon zest to the glaze.

They are also keepers - made them a day in advance and were still extremely fresh tasting.

Standard Baking Co. is one of the best bakeries every. Any trip near Portland requires a visit. These muffins are just typical of everything they offer. These are my new addiction. Don't be hasty like me though, take them out of the pan before icing. Almost impossible to get them out once the glaze is on. I ended up with lots of muffin tops...oh darn! Oh and I made them mini muffins and you get about 60 muffins, so great for large groups.

Fresh ginger brought this muffin up to 3 forks. Was unimpressed with the glaze, but very good overall.

A tasty, moist muffin. The texture is almost "cake mix" light, which is different from most muffins that I make. The lemon glaze was a little runny, so I added more icing sugar, dipped the top of the muffins into the glaze, which worked very well. I also added some lemon zest to the glaze, which added a little extra pizzaz. I only baked them for 20 minutes AND the recipe made 16 plump muffins.

I thought this recipe was tasty and moist. I think I ended up adding twice the ginger--fresh ginger is a really good idea mentioned by another reviewer, but I didn't have any. I'll try fresh next time. I ended up making this in my bread machine because I wanted a loaf instead of muffins. I set the machine to start baking before I woke up and it was the best morning treat!

I must have done something wrong. A recipe doesn't get this many outstanding reviews and serve up the results I ended up with. Mine were on the dry side and lacking the spicy flavor I was looking for. Will definitely give this recipe another try and maybe increase the spices.

great muffins! I also could not find light molasses, which did not seem to make much of a difference.

The muffins tasted good and I thought they turned out pretty moist. Mine were not dry by any means.

I have already made these muffins twice and each time they were a big hit!! I never thought to combine the taste of lemons and gingerbread, but the combination works out perfectly. However, the second time I made them, I was out of regular powdered sugar for the frosting and only had lemon flavored powdered sugar, which left the frosting a little too sweet and not enough lemon flavor.

These muffins were tasted by 32 people and the raves were unbelievable. I began with buttering the tins and found the muffins quite difficult to remove from pans even after more cooling. Recommend using paper liners and nice for serving in. I was glad to find that I got 24 muffins instead of the 16. The glaze is not messy and ends up dry even after spending a night and a day in the car at below freezing temperatures. These are very gingery but all thought they were perfect.

I can't believe I'm first to rate this recipe! These muffins are the perfect balance of richness and tartness with the glaze. I just made them for a neighborhood holiday party tonight. Everyone LOVED them. "They're so moist!" "This lemon glaze is incredible!" "How many can I take home?" The recipe is pretty much perfect - and easy - but I did add a 1/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg. And I used mini-muffin tins and baked for only about 18 minutes. For the glaze - which really makes the recipe - I squeezed lemons fresh from our trees. Merry Christmas from Southern California!
