I have used this recipe for 3 years. Don't bother with rolling them. Chill the ganache in a loaf pan, remove the block, slice it into cubes with a warm knife, and dredge the cubes in cocoa. It takes a MINUTE.

Chocolate is too strong. It was impossible to cut after cooling. I had to re-melt and use a scoop to make the balls.

I love these truffles. In my opinion the anise isn't all that strong - barely an essence, but a good essence. One great thing about these is the ease of preparation. In a happy accident, I removed the block of ganache from the loaf pan after chilling overnight and found it was set hard. Rather than waiting for it to soften and individually rolling the cubes into balls, I simply coated them in cocoa and served the truffles in squares. They were delicious and looked rather rustic and elegant that way.

These are very simple to make and they are delicious. The anise flavor is not overpowering. To make 40 truffles they are on the small size.
