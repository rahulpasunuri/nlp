This probably rated 2.5 forks, as it was good, but it didn't have a good balance between the pears and cranberries. I measured my pears by weight and used 3-1/2 lbs to the 1 c of fresh cranberries and I did not change the sugar in either component. So I made this recipe, exactly as printed and it did fit in my 8 x 8 Corningware pan, which has higher sides. I was worried as it was piled in, but it did not ooze over at all. Next time I will reduce the amount of pears and add in more cranberries. But this was easy and a great change from the usual apple crisps.

I had a full can of pears leftover from another recipe I had to get rid of so I thought this would be perfect. Not quite enough pears so I added one can of peaches and a 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries. I chopped the fruit into large chunks and drained all the canned juices. We didn't add anything to the fruit base as I figured as it would be sweet enough. The raspberries gave it the zing it needed. Delicious!!

The cranberries add a perfect tartness to the sweet pears. Next time I make it I'll throw in a bit of extra cranberries.

Couldn't be easier. I cut the sugar in half for both the filling and the topping and it was perfect. Plenty sweet.

I find all crisps delicious. This was no exception. Next time I would cut the pears in chunks rather than slices.

Friends gave us a bag of fresh pears and this was a good use for them! I used a 9"x12" pan and cut the sugar to 1/2 c. in the crisp. Should have cut the sugar in half on the pears as they were sweeter than I realized and the cranberries are also pre-sweetened. This was really good with hubby's homemade plain yogurt which was a good counterpoint to the sweetness of the dessert. I'll make this again.

This was very good. I was short a few pears, and they were a little too ripe, but it was still good eatin'! I agree with other reviewers about needing a bigger pan size; even without all the pears I could have used, this fit better into a 7x11 pan. I used craisins instead of fresh cranberries, so I cut back on sugar. I would like to try to make the topping with a little less butter, which is shocking to say here in Wisconsin, but it did seem a bit too rich.

I also cut the sugar by half in both the fruit and topping. It was plenty sweet for my taste.

I've made this three times in the last month which means I really like it, and it is easy to make. There is no way this would fit into an 8x8 dish even using medium pears. I've used a 8x12 and 9x13 glass baking dish. I guess "large" pears could vary from one part of the country to another.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I reduced the amount of sugar in the filling only; I found the topping to be cloyingly sweet. That version would have rated only 2.5 forks. Next time I cut the sugar in half for the topping as well, and it turned out out just perfect - 4 forks, easily! I used firm but ripe Bosc pears both times; they kept their shape and texture really nicely.

I was a little skeptical about the blend of ingredients here, but this dessert turned out very delicious! I have always been an apple crisp girl...not anymore! I baked for just a little less time than the recipe recommended because I didn't want the crumble top to burn. It was perfect. I doubt I will make apple crisp again!

Made this following the recipe. The pears seemed a little mushy (over cooked) so I traded them for apples - perfection! Also made into a pie (just add pie crust on bottom) My family loved it so much I made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Try pecans in place on walnuts.

Well, it couldn't be easier and it's delicious -- loved the tartness of the cranberries. I didn't give it 4 stars only because it's so easy!

Great! Added some extra cranberries and a bit of sugar to cut the tartness. Only comment is this was way too much to fit in an 8x8 pan- I used a 9x12!

Sweetened dried cranberries also work great. I always have them on hand for salads and snacking, and have found them a wonderful addition to baking - including in coffee cakes.

Had some ripe pears not being eaten, so made this very quick recipe and decided to add a few Italian plums also. I found that it had the right amount of spice and a nice texture. We all enjoyed it warm from the oven with and without vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again!

Very good. I did not measure the pears or the cranberries and ended up doubling the recipe. Didn't peal the pears either. Next time I will. Baked in a 13x9 for 1 hour. Also used low fat marg. Next time I'll put in more sugar as this was a little tart. More thank likely because I did not measure the cranberries.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner. Cut the sugar for the filling in half as suggested by other reviewers. Perfect, not too sweet.

I made this years ago when I was married. This year our pear tree had an abundance of fruit. I lost this recipebut decided the Internet could help me and it did! Thank you!

Made this (double batch) for a fall dessert party, to supplement my favorite chocolate gooey things for those annoying guests who "don't like anything too sweet." Cut the sugar in this recipe? Not a chance. Sure enough, all my picky friends loved it as-is. So, it's easy, I thought it was okay-tasting, and lots of other people liked it. I'd probably make it again, but there are better pear recipes out there if you have a really sweet tooth like me.

I used Royal Rivera pears and the crisp came out delightfully delicious. I did not use as much sugar as called for in the receipe for the filling.

Quick, easy and very tasty - and well received by my picky eaters. I used considerably less sugar and this turned out to be a good decision. Will make again.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I've made it many times, sometimes with apples instead of pears. It's always a been a big hit.
