Very nice garnish for compatible soups and salads, particularly the chicken adobe salad from this site.

This was the only Epicurious recipe that didn't work for me. They had the texture of shoe leather, and the combination of spices was spicy, but not that flavorful.

I made these for one of my Supper Club contributions, and my two-year-old was trying to grab multiple handfuls before I packed them up. Flavorful and addicting.

Very good, very easy, well liked by family, great way to use up leftover tortillas. I served these, still hot, with Beef Chili with Chipotle Chilies and Cilantro, also from Epicurious. A well-liked meal!

I rarely rate a recipe at 4 forks unless I think it is special. We had some left-over corn tortillas to use up and this seemed like a good idea for dinner last night with guests. It was a big hit, although I confess to changing the recipe slightly. I think the cook from Calgary is right on. I brushed the tortillas on both sides with oil, put the spices in a shaker and seasoned each layer of the stack - cut them into random strips and baked as directed. Mine turned out spicy hot and wonderful because I used an extra hot New Mexico chili powder. The beer drinkers especially loved it! No more store-bought tortilla chips in this house again.

Not one of my favorites! They were pretty blah and too crunchy. Everyone will hear you munching on the chips and I hate to hear that even over a football game!!!! I think if you are going to try this recipe increase the cayenne to give it some heat or else they are just so-so. Don't forget to sprinkle them with some salt after you take them out of the oven.

These were a big hit, however, I think next time I would change the method. With all those 1/4" strips it was pretty difficulty to scoop up any salsa unless you shoved 3 or 4 in your mouth at the same time. Next time I'd cut into narrow triangles. (Also far less work as you lay all those fiddly strips side by side on the cookie sheet). Also, next time I'd brush just the oil on the tortillas, then combine the spices, put them in a shakeer, and sprinkle them on. The spices sink to the bottom of the oil/spice mixture, so unless you stir and scoop each time you brush the oil on, most of the seasoning will be left in the bottom of the bowl. I would certainly make them again, and a big wicker bowl of the strips looked so pretty!
