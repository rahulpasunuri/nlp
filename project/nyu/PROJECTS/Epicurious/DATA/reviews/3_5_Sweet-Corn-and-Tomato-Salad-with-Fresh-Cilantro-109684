Forgot to add that I used heirloom baby tomatoes, and the color and taste were exceptional.

I love this salad. It makes perfect use of seasonal farmer's market items. If your corn and tomatoes are fresh, the salad almost needs nothing else. However, like other reviewers, I spruced mine up a bit. I added garlic (grated, so you don't chew the chunks), thyme (because I don't like cilantro), shallots instead of red onion, and champagne vinegar instead of red wine. So delicious and even better the second day. This is going in my permanent repertoire. I boiled some shrimp along with the corn for 3 minutes and it was a perfect accompaniment.

I love this salad, it is very easy to make and very versatile. I use lime juice instead of the red wine vinegar and usually double olive oil and juice. I also usually use baby grape tomatoes and one can of rinsed black beans and use about five ears of corn instead of ten. Sometimes I add tabasco to give it an extra kick. Overall a great summer salad recipe!

This is a wonderful summer salad and really pops on the plate with all of the wonderful colors from the corn, tomatoes and cilantro. The only changes I make are to replace the red wine vinegar with lime juice as others have suggested and to use quartered grape tomatoes rather than plum tomatoes.

great way to serve summer corn to a crowd, cook corn early in the day and there will be no heat in the kitchen from a big pot of boiling water.. excellent

This is a great summer salad, especially when served with tortilla chips as a salsa. This recipe called for only one tablespoon of red wine vinegar but I actually added 5 to give it more zing- and a bit of tabasco sauce. And if you're in a pinch, a bag of frozen corn will do.

A disappointment. I'd say that tomatoes are not the right choice - perhaps red peppers were the way to go.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I added a can of black beans to the recipe and that makes it even better. I have brought it to parties and it is the first thing everyone flocks to. Definitely worth making!

This really isn't all that. If you read the reviews, these people made changes then reviewed that apparently. Without making changes this recipe needs some help.

I made something similar recently with rave reviews. make a dressing of 1/4C olive oil + 1T apple cider vinegar + 1/2 tsp sugar, and add avocado to the corn, tomatoes, onion & cilantro.

I steamed fresh corn and used the tomatoes from my garden, but still this was a bland salad. I served it along side a potato salad and a healthy cucumber salad and at the burger party, the corn salad was barely touched. There is a black bean, tomato, corn, heart of palm salad on this site that is excellent.

I LOVED this recipe and my husband who is very particular about his food loved it as well. I replaced the red wine vinegar with lime juice. Also, it needs salt, but not too much to bring out all of the flavors. Perfect for a summer picnic.

I added a can of black beans, eliminated the vinegar and oil, and added fresh squeezed lime juice and a dask of sugar instead. Very quick to prepare for a BBQ or picnic.

This is a delicious salad. I too used lime instead of vinegar. I made it yesterday and ate the leftovers today at lunch and it tastes much better after the flavors have had time to mix together. I would recommend making this at least 12 hours before serving.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried that showcases the fresh taste of corn and tomatoes. My family loves it, and any time I want to wow someone, this is the recipe I make, no matter what the season (as long as I can get fresh sweet corn). It is so easy--this recipe is a keeper!

This salad is bursting with the taste of summer...freshness and top quality ingredients are the keys to outstanding flavour. Have made this several times over the summer and has always been well received with many requests for the recipe. Must confess to a few changes: I added one chopped green bell pepper and 2 finely minced jalapenos to the salad, and subbed the juice/fine zest of 1 lime for the red wine vinegar and corn oil instead of olive oil, also added 1 tsp. sugar, generous amounts of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to the dressing. The lime really brightened and enhanced the other flavours. For those averse to cilantro (as recent guests were) try adding fresh mint instead...imparted a refreshing combo of cool/spicy/sweet flavours that complemented each other very well. Best served on the day of making as becomes a little watery by the next day. Also makes an excellent salsa/dip for chili and lime tortilla chips. Love, love, love this salad!!!

Whatever you do, DO NOT use frozen corn. I had too much frozen corn and tried using it in this recipe. I tried to compensate, but the corn just was not crisp enough. With the other ingredients, the 'fresh' taste of fresh corn is really necessary.

One of the reasons I love Epicurious.com is to read all of the other people's reviews and suggestions. This recipe is delicious, and made even BETTER by the addition of the Fresh Garlic and the Avocado. I did not add the black beans, but imagine that would be a good add. This is just such the perfect dish to make with the sweet corn and tomatoes that can only be had in August. Delicious with burgers off the grill, grilled chicken, etcetera. I am definitely going to make this with the Ribs we always have for Labor Day weekend. This recipe gets written in ink in my favorites file!

This was a lovely addition to a potluck, and not as nit-picky to make as I originally thought, what with having to shave the ears of corn. I added a bit more vinegar and oil, and some cubes of cheese - but I wouldn't add cheese next time. It took away from the 'freshness' for me.

This has been a summer staple for years. I sometimes add black beans, diced avocado, jack cheese and a bit of garlic. Always a huge hit.

This is one of the great, versatile, goes-with-nearly-anything summer vegetable salads. I also used corn oil and threw in 8 oz. of cubed pepper jack cheese, but the delicious possibilities are endless. I will make this salad again and again. It got raves at a Memorial Day barbecue.

Fantastic, easy salad. I think grilled corn is overrated, so went steamed it. I substituted scallions for the red onions. I don't think extra dressing is necessary.

Great for a tailgate party. I grilled the corn in advance and added diced avocado just before serving.

This would have only been 3 forks were not for the small revisions we did: Instead of boiling the corn we grilled it the day before - and cut it off the cob for the salad the next day. Then we only used 4 large ears of corn instead of 6, and added a can of rinsed black beans as another cook suggested - we also substituted the lime juice for the red wine vinegar and doubled the dressing amounts. Divine! I agree with the other reviewers, this is only as good as the ingredients are fresh - we used garden tomatoes and corn from the farmer's market - our eight guests over labor day weekend enjoyed it very much.

Rating: 4
Really excellent. Served it according to the recipe, undercooked the corn, added a bit of scallion and wee bit of lemon basil. There were some gourmet cooks at my table - we all raved. Wow!

There is a much better way to make this salad (my mom has been maaking it for years this way) - substitute the juice of half a lime for the vinegar, use corn oil, courase salt, and fresh black pepper. You can also add black beans, and it becomes a great side dish that kills the heat and brings out the flavor of anything spicy - jerk chicken, grilled fish and steak. Throw some plantains on the grill (look for goya brand tostones in the ethnic freezer aisle), open up a corona, and you're waaay south of the border!

Excellent summer salad but only as good as the fresh ingredients you use. Can only see this being good late summer with great sweet corn and very ripe tomatoes. I've made this twice now and it's great side dish for salads and main course - great with fish. It looks pretty and is very refreshing and healthy. I'd recommend this, especially if you are a Cilantro lover! I didn't use plum tomatoes but substituted the best looking ones I found in my market.

This was delicious BUT, aking my cue from previous reviewers, I used Wishbone red wine vinagrette instead of what was called for in the original recipe. The vinagrette added just the right zip so the dish wasn't bland. The second time I made it I added some diced celery and a mild diced banana pepper. Yum! Everybody loved it.

Rating: 2
This was good, tasty and pretty but nothing to rave about. I used lime in place of vinegar. Think that maybe vinegar would have more zip. Used zest of one lime and juice of two. Added red pepper as it needed to be eaten. Overall, nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either.

Rating: 3
I thought this salad was pretty to look at because it was so colourful and was very refreshing. While I enjoyed it, if almost felt as though there was something, flavour-wise, missing, so I think next time I make it, I would like to add some lime wedges to give it a little more zip, if wanted and I think the addition of lime would compliment the flavours of the cilantro.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I thought the cilantro would be odd and was tempted to substitute basil but my hosband's daring prevailed. Wonderful use for the tons of cherry tomatoes we mistakenly planted this year.

The adults in our family liked this, but the kids didn't. Building on some of the earlier suggestions, I added lemon juice and zest and substituted lemon basil for the cilantro and scallions for the red onions. Next time I think I'll stick with the original recipe, which is probably zippier than this variation.

This a great light salad that's easy to make. I adapted it for my husband and I using two ears of corn and less of the other ingredients. It was a delicious accompaniment for one steak dinner, and the next night, a great relish for hamburgers.

Fresh corn from the farmers market as well as black plum tomatoes and some chunks of a beefsteak variety, thai basil and about 1/4 cup of cilantro. But my add-on was an orange bell pepper. It is a sweet dish with the right corn and I would add chopped garlic next time too. It's so beautiful and uses late summer's bounty so well. I even added some nasturshim blossoms for decoration. I'm going to make again this weekend!

Im a Personal Chef and decided to try this recipe out. Wow, it was really great. I did take the advice of a previous reviewer. I add lime zest and scallions. I hollowed out a butter lettuce and served it in the middle as the bowl. The entree was steak. It really was very, very good.

Excellent salad! Using beautiful summer-ripe local corn and cherry tomatoes is key. Subbed scallions for red onion and used both cilatnro and fresh basil. Really fresh young corn only needs about a minute to boil(maybe even less). Followed another reviewer's suggestion and added diced avocado and lime juice....Great addition to a BBQ. Looks beautiful too!

I made this salad but did not have cilantro. My back yard herb garden was bursting with basil so I substituted basil. It was wonderful. I also added a bit of lemon zest and 5 oz fresh mozzarella cut into small cubes. It was a hit. A wonderful salad to serve when the fresh corn comes on.

I had this as an appetizer at Il Forno in Providence - except it was drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was $13, and was good, but not quite THAT good. This one is fabulous. Maybe because, even though they said it was made with fresh native corn, we bought ours from a farm stand and it had been picked about 2 hours before I cooked it. I sauteed some chicken tenders in a bit of oil, salt, and pepper and it was a perfect accompanyment. We halved the recipe as it was just a quick family dinner. It was all I could do to save the left-overs for lunch tomorrow and not eat it out of the bowl standing in the kitchen. Definitely a make-again recipe. It's perfect for a hot summer night.

I've made a simpler version of this dish for years in the summer with fresh corn, garden ripened tomatoes and a vinaigrette made simply from lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and honey. Though I like the additions in this recipe in general, the simpler version is SO easy and yet so incredibly perfect. (Relying, of course on the perfection of the corn and tomatoes--also good artisan honey doesn't hurt either...).

I agree with Morristown. When the corn is just-picked, it needs no or very little cooking. I just drop it in the boiling water for about 30 seconds. This is an easy and delicious side dish for hot summer days (or any time).

I agree this is a great dish. I made it 'almost' as is for a dinner party and got raves. The only change was to stop cooking the corn at 3 minutes, and I'm glad I did but maybe it was just the corn I had.

This is a wonderful recipe which I, too, have been making for years. My additions are cucumber and sugar snap peas or haricots verts, blanched, a little cumin in the vinaigrette, and a squeeze of fresh lime. While fresh corn is the absolute best, I make this in winter in Buffalo with canned corn which I dry toast in a saute pan.

I thought this recipe was great. But, I did change a few things. First, I bought only the best white corn and tomatoes I could find. I only cooked the corn for 2 1/2 minutes because I like the extra crunch. Also, for the dressing, I used 2 tablespoons of sherry vinegar (rather than 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar) and the regular amount of olive oil. The sherry vinegar--make sure to get the good stuff from Jerez de la Frontera--gives the salad that "something" the recipe lacks. With those changes and the cilantro on top, the salad was great! I brought it to a 4th of July barbecue and it received rave reviews from everyone there.

I agree that this should be done with fresh corn only. Next time, I am going to try a similar recipe from the new Bon Appétit issue (August 2004), with some cheese in it. Though this is a recipe that I would do again and that tasted great, I thought there was a little something missing to make it wonderful.
