Delicious. I doubled the recipe and made it in a larger pan. Don't put it under the broiler for more than 1 minute. I did. It was fine, but the salmon was more cooked than I like. I used neufchatel cheese. Still delicious and very simple. This is going to become one of my standards.

This is really delicious! The sweetness of the leeks is a perfect contrast to the smoked salmon. I used feta cheese and it was just right. I was afraid the salmon would dry out under the broiler, but it didn't.

This is delicious and has become a breakfast standard at our house.

I agree with a previous review that this is basically like an OK quiche without the crust. This was fine for a one-time weekday dinner. 8" skillet worked well for thickness, btw. I think goat cheese would've worked better, flavour-wise, than cream cheese.

Made this for gastronomically-challenged Nordic in-laws for brunch - ingredients are typically used in Scandinavian kitchens. Served on top of a slice of dark rye bread (rugbrød) with a dollop of creme fraiche and garnish with caviar and fresh sprig of dill. Big hit and will definitely do again for brunch, with or without guests.

Lovely recipe .. tripled (but just 2 TB. dill) + added 1/2 c. heavy cream - very popular with everyone.

This is the first frittata I've ever made. I'll be making more! This was easy and delicious, although I made some changes to use stuff I had on hand. I substituted chevre for the cream cheese (prefer it anyway) and left out the dill, which I forgot to buy. It still came out great. For a basic frittata recipe that you can play with, this is a great place to start. The only change in cooking instructions that I had to make was that I had to keep it under the broiler for 3-4 minutes.

A light, crisp tasting brunch dish. The flavours of the cream cheese and salmon really come through elegantly. Alter the pan size to make the frittata thicker or thinner. And as alway, make a day ahead so flavours can meld.

Delicious. Thought it tasted even better the next day cold. I had low-fat chunky cottage cheese on hand - which worked well. Also added another egg because my skillet was large and used more cheese than written. A great high protein meal.

I usually do not like eggs, but LOVED this - very flavorful. I had to broil it for ~3 minutes instead of 1. Presents nicely.

This was a big hit Christmas morning, with everything bagels. I added a few more eggs, because my skillet was larger and after reading others comments. I also added a large dollop of sour cream, because I was out of cream cheese. It was perfect. The dill and smoked salmon were an awesome addition to a fritatta. (The eggnog french toast with cranberry/ apple compote from this site is also wonderful and easy!! Will be doing both again!)

Even my kids ate this one. I had some leftover lox I had made, and this was a great way to finish it! Note to Cook from Austin: Just because you didn't love it doesn't mean the rest of us are inflating our ratings. Maybe you just have different taste than the rest of the reviewers, or something didn't work out for you.

This is a great weeknight supper or weekend brunch dish. Simple and very satisfying. Everyone always loves these, and cutting them into wedges makes for a nicer presentation than scrambled eggs, or having to make individual omelets.

In a word, yummy! I made this fritta for dinner last week out of desperation for not going to the grocery store sooner! Definitely use a medium skillet. I overlooked this key instruction and my large nonstick was way too big! I compensated by adding two more eggs. I like my eggs fluffy/creamy, so I also added a quarter cup of whipping cream to the egg mixture. Freshly ground pepper is a must, and salt was not necessary as I used the entire 3 oz. package of salmon instead of the mere two ouncescalled for. Served with fresh fruit and toast with jam, this made for a fun weeknight meal and allowed me to put of the grocery store one more day! I will definitely make again, especially for a brunch! Happy cooking!

Think there might be some problems on this site with "grade inflation". This was ok...not great. Not sure its worth the time when an omlette would be much faster...

Nice combination of flavors. I think 'medium' sized skillet is key. Using a larger skillet resulted in a more desiccated final product, but still a good taste. Definitely will try this again.

Very easy and delightful recipe. I've made it twice now and it is so tasty. Make sure to add some fresh ground pepper--that is important. You might even add a bit of thyme or rosemary. Don't be afraid to let it puff and brown on the edges. It gives a MUCH nicer presentation than scrambled eggs--a "quiche" without the work of a crust. A mixed green salad with a rice wine and garlic vinaigrette plus a piece of sourdough toast really balance the meal.

For some reason this didn't ring my chimes as much as I expected. I added half as much again to all the ingredients to try to make it bigger and puffier, but it still just seemed kind of flat and so-so to me. A lot of work for the final product. Why not just make scrambled eggs with chopped salmon and dill?

I've made this frittata several times and it always gets rave reviews. I triple the recipe for brunch and leave out the salt as the smoked salmon is already quite salty.

Rating: 3
Very good. I tripled it for six people, so it had to cook about three times as long.

This is the best frittata I have ever made or eaten. The cream cheese is like a delighful surprise.

This makes a wonderful Sunday brunch. My husband made it with shallots instead of leeks, and it turned out really good.

I made this for my husband on Father's Day for a breakfast in bed. It was really fantastic. It came out so nice and fluffy, broiling was something I never thought to do with eggs. Served with a raspberry streudel and bagel, cream cheese and fresh juice. Great presentation. Very happy husband.

I had visitors from out of town. I made this dish. It was a sensation. I served the dish with bagels (dah) cut up fruit and a noodle pudding. Try it! You'll like it!

We started making this dish as a staple for breakfast while on a low carb diet. We've found that it makes an excellent meal even off the diet, to serve to guests or just for a fun Sunday breakfast. We made it as is and LOVED it.

easy, quick and delicious. used onions instead of leeks and had some salmon cream cheese which simplified the whole process. to serve, added a dollop of sour cream and spoonful of inexpensive caviar to each serving which made a very elegant presentation. excellent sunday brunch option. very strongly recommend!

Excellent, easy breakfast. I used smoked trout, and it was great! Also used dried dill instead of fresh - in the future I'd use about 3/4 t (I used about 2 t and it overpowered the leeks!) Also, definitely no salt needs to be added.

I made this recipe twice(my first time making a frittata). The first time I tried it out on my husband, it was flat but still very good. The second time I served it to a group of girl friends for a holiday brunch. I increased all ingredients by 50 percent (6 eggs instead of 4, etc.) and it turned out very puffy and looked beautiful. I served it with spinach salad and a wonderful Korbel Rose' Champagne. The whole thing was a hit!

This dish was easy, quick and quite tasty. However, the smoked salmon made it much too salty even tho' I added no salt. Next time, I will use leftover salmon from the grill.

This was a simple dish to prepare and very flavorful. I used a 10" cast iron skillet and it made a flat frittata. Next time, I would try it in an 8".

Rating: 3
Wonderful with bagels and spinach salad as suggested. However, next time I will be sure not to season with salt, as the smoked salmon was already salted. Otherwise it is a really fast delighful recipe!

Delicious, simple to prepare and very pretty on the plate. As the recipe suggested, I served a spinach salad with apples and crispy almonds alongside the frittata and it made for a very lovely Winter brunch.
