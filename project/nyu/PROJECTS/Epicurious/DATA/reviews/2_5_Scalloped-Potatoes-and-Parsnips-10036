I love parnsips and potatoes, but just didn't think this dish was all that great. It was healthy- which is a bonus - but I won't make it again.

My family likes this recipe a lot and the fact it's easy to make and lo-cal makes it that much better. Baking it as directed until golden and then letting it sit in the turned-off oven helps to absorb any remaining liquid that might still be there.

I would make this dish again but with quite a few alterations. I don't know what went wrong but I found this dish to be bland and watery.

This was a "yummy" dish. Great for entertaining a large group. Many were surprised to find that they enjoyed parsnips after never having tasted them (by choice). Reduced calories is also a good selling point for this dish. We found that the dish was more flavorful with some salt and pepper added in the cooking process.
