So delicious! I made these and put them on the baking sheets, then covered in saran and put them in the fridge until I was ready to bake them. It worked perfectly and even people who don't like blue cheese loved these.

I didn't have any Stilton so I won't rate the recipe. Still, it made for some tasty basic cheddar biscuits. I brushed a few of them with a butter, roasted garlic, and oregano mixture, and they were gobbled up immediately.

These were absolutely fabulous. I made them with blue cheese instead of stilton and halved the recipe. My ingredients could have been colder and my biscuits came out a bit flat. The flavor was exceptional. I will definitely repeat these again. They would be a great with anything!

These biscuits came out delicious!They were easy and quick to make. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used a mix of sour cream, plain yogurt and milk. I think next time I will add more Stilton and less Double Gloucester since I love Stilton.

Just got done making 72 of these Cheddar and Stilton Drop Biscuits and they ALL turned out FABULOUS! Will make again and again!

Delicious. There are a few negative reviews on here and honestly, I don't know how they could've found these unappetizing! These were easy and wonderful. Served them with steak.

I was very disappointed by this recipe, especially since I found it while looking for something new to try instead of our usual Cheddar Dill Biscuits (on this site -- they are wonderful). I think the only nice thing I have to say about these is that they freeze well.

I love this recipe! It is worth every calorie. I usually exclude the stilton but they are delicious either way.

Just made 8 dozen for my parents' 40th anniversary party -- perfect for our smoked ham/scalloped potato etc. buffet dinner. Used Danish blue instead of Stilton, and copied food processor method below -- quick and easy. Also made them slightly smaller (1/4 cup vs 1/3 cup batter each), but still generous size. Excellent!!

These biscuits deserve 4 forks for ease of preparation, taste, and texture. Used ingredients that I had on hand, cheddar/jack cheese, and half and half. I made this using my food processor. Add all dry ingredients, and pulse to mix. Add large pieces of butter, along with the cheese. Pulse just until mixture is crumbly. Transfer to mixing bowl and add milk/egg mixture. Drop onto Silpat mat. My oven is forced air convection so I reduced the temp to 375, and baked for 13 minutes on middle rack. Perfection. Might try with chopped green chilies mixed in during the addition of milk/egg mixture next time. Served with homemade black bean chili, and simple romaine salad.

I have made these several times and they always receive rave reviews. This is definitely a keeper - easy and delicious, but not very health conscious. Enjoy!

these biscuits were great with tomato soup. I used sharp cheddar and monterey and nonfat milk instead of buttermilk. The easiest biscuits to make. Leftovers good the next day for ham sandwiches in the toaster oven. I will definately be making these again.

Too easy! I omitted the stilton and used 1 1/2 cups extra sharp white cheddar. Definitely not health food, but worth breaking the rules for. Beautiful!

I have to say, I just made these again for the bajillionth time and I am always amazed at how easy, forgiving and tasty these little biscuits are. For a last minute dinner I whipped up these and some winter veg stew, took about 1 hour for the whole thing and my guests were blown away.

These rate 5 forks! DELICIOUS and simple. Very versitile, I serve these with homemade soup, stew and are wonderful on a buffet table with ham. A keeper!

These were SO good. Doughs normally don't like me, but this one was very easy to work with. (I used a pastry blender, not my fingers for the butter). Baked on a Silpat, one sheet at a time, and kept it in the middle of the oven for the full 20 minutes. The top and bottom were both golden brown. Serve this with a bowl of soup, and you have the perfect lunch.

These are g-o-o-d! Rich and tasty. We like Stilton, so next time, we'll decrease the Cheddar and increase the Stilton accordingly. Didn't have cream of tartar, so omitted it. What does it do to biscuits?

Very tasty biscuits - made them for Thanksgiving and got great reviews. I use an airbake pan and no burned biscuits! YUM!!!

Rating: 4
These are wonderful. I have made them three times. The only complaint that I have is that all three times the biscuits burned on the bottom, even when I strayed from the directions and only used the top rack. I also tried baking them on a silpat which helped but was still not perfect. I was surprised none of the other reviewers mentioned this problem.

yes this is terrific even with milk instead of buttermilk and any old cheese that is around e.g. parmesan and a mild soft blue cheese from Tasmania. And no cream of tartar. And NO SALT - cheese is so salty, why would you add salt?

Superb! I omitted the cream of tartar and used only cheddar instead of cheddar/stilton (couldn't find stilton), but they still turned out great. Recipe made 10 HUGE biscuits, which were devoured promptly.

Delicious biscuits. They reheat well in the oven -- I make a batch on the weekend and then have them for breakfast all week. To the cook who felt the Stilton taste was too strong: instead of crumbling the Stilton, try grating it, which will eliminate the little nuggets.

These biscuits were delicious...easy to make. The cheddar and Stilton were a wonderful taste treat. I thought they were even better the next day!

Made these for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. They were easy and added their own flavor to the meal.

WOW! I've made this twice and will make it many more times. Incredibly rich and yummy. Using Stilton is desirable, but when I could only find Danish Blue, the recipe still produced great results.

These were so easy to make! You definitely need to be a blue cheese lover to enjoy these. The next day I used them for sandwiches and stuffed them with turkey!

These are great. You have to like blue cheese, but if you do, I think you'll like this recipe.
