Really great flavor combination. Sweet from the squash and hosin, spicy from the ginger and 5 spice and tangy from the orange juice. I made the oj/spice mixture according to the recipe and poured it into sesame oiled squash halves and baked. This made the recipe much easier to make and eat.

I didn't like this at all, the flavors simply didn't mix well with the squash, there are far better recipes out there, this was just a waste of time.

My husband thought it was ok. I didn't like it. I guess I'm not a Chines 5 powder fan. That's all I tasted.

Very tasty and easy. Cooks quickly, but broiler gives nice crust.

This sounds time consuming for a side dish but it's really not that bad,but oh so worth it!! I didn't cut the squash into wedges I simply cut the squash in half (so i could fill it with Mushroom risotto) and baked as directed. There is plenty of sauce left over to drizzle on pork or chicken.

I made this for Thanksgiving for the whole family, and it got rave reviews. They are not folks who normally eat squash, but they all really enjoyed it. I substituted Butternut Squash for the acorn squash, and it was very good. I would definitely make it again, and its been added to my "book" of favorite recipes.
