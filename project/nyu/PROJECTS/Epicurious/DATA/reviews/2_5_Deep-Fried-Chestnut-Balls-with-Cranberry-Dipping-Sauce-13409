We have a chestnut tree in the back yard, has anyone tried this recipe with fresh chestnuts?

Our dinner guests were all pleased with this appetizer. We served it with a cranberry chutney and it was a lovely compliment.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I made these and everyone thought they were horrible.

Great recipe! I have made it many times for the hollidays. Make sure to prepare it ahead of time and leave overnight in the refrigerator. That will make much easyer to roll for deep frying.
