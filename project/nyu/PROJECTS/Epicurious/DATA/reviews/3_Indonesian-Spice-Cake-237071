It was not terrible, but it definitely wasn't that great...it's a little bland. For all the butter and eggs used, mine turned out kind of dry, and I didn't bake it any longer than called for.

IT'S OK, NOT OUTSTANDING IN ANY WAY.

My husband and I loved this dish...the flavors and textures mingle to make a wonderfully aromatic and flavorful dish.
