This was just okay. I used chicken apple sausage and mozzarella. I added 1 tsp of Penzey's Pasta Sprinke and 1/4 C of cream cheese because the sauce seemed too runny and not flavorful enough. I will not make again.

Easy weeknight dinner. I used chicken sausage and skipped the red pepper in an attempt to please picky kids. Next time I'll add other colorful veggies to make the plate prettier and motivate my kids to try some more. Overall, great flavor and very little effort -- a winner at the end of a long day.

This recipe is a huge hit at my house, even with my husband who doesn't really love pasta and my kids who aren't huge fans of spinach or mushroom. I've made it several times with whatever kind of pasta I have on hand, and it definitely turns out much better with pastas like rotini or gemelli than penne. The sauce and veggies kind of clump to the sausage if there aren't enough nooks and crannies in the noodles.

I love this recipe. It's a staple in our home. I use sweet Italian Sausage and I remove it from the casing and cook, breaking it up with a fork. I have never deviated from the recipe because it's so delicious that I don't need to!

Good recipe overall. I felt that the sausage was a bit overwhelming. The flavor of the sauce is not overall full-bodied, so next time I'll use chicken. I also felt the recipe called for too much cheese. I would cut it at least in half, and would perhaps even consider using parmesan instead. Also, I think a grating of lemon zest would brighten this dish right up. As a side note, with all the mozzarella in the dish, I went through four scouring pads to clean the dishes for dinner for two! I will make this dish again, but with several alterations.

I made this for my boyfriend and a friend that was visiting and they loved it - despite this being meant to serve 4 people they finished the lot! I used button mushrooms and French pork sausage for this, but half the mozzarella. I also omitted the pepper as my boyfriend can't eat it. It was delicious but I would use the amount of mozzarella stated in the recipe next time. Will definately make again - quick, easy and very very tasty!

I made this last night for company and they loved loved loved it. For the sausage, I used 2 links of chorizo and 2 links of sweet italian sausage which I cooked in some sherry while I was chopping and prepping everything else. When I added the the chicken broth to wilt the spinach, I also added the liquid from the sausages. It worked beautifully. I'll make this one again.

YUMMY! I used baby bella mushrooms, red onion in place of the shallots and bow-tie pasta in place of the penne. I also used Italian sausage.

Rating: 3
I made a good number of changes...which probably was a bad idea. I didn't have any mushrooms so I decreased the chicken broth to 1 cup and slowly added parm (roughly 4 oz) instead of motz. Also, I threw in a healthy splash of 1/2 & 1/2. Hubby liked the dish more than I did. So, maybe it's worth revisiting another day... when I have the actual ingredients on hand.

This really didn't do it for me. I thought it was a pretty boring combination of flavors. Maybe it was because of the mushrooms I used? I used enoki, bunashimeji (also known as jade gill mushrooms), and oyster mushrooms. In the future if I want a cheesy mushroom pasta, I'll stick with the Baked Penne with Wild Mushroom Ragout from this site.

I make this also with rapini (broccoli rabe) instead of spinach, and sometimes add sliced chicken. A sprinkling of toasted pine nuts on top adds a little more depth of flavor, too. It's one of my husband's favorites!

Dinner time was approaching and all I had in the fridge was some fresh spinach and a mixture of shiitake, crimini, portabello, and button mushrooms. I did a search and came up with this recipe. What a great surprise for something literally thrown together at the last minute. I used Italian sausage, about 1/2 cup each of sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese as it was all I had on hand. This dish was comforting and had a bit of a kick to it. Would definitely recommend for an easy dinner!

Pretty tasty, but I thought there was way too much cheese. It ended up more like macaroni and cheese that just happened to have sausage and spinach in it. But, with that lesson learned, I would definitely make it again.

I made this because I had the ingredients. It benefits from adding the goat cheese recommendation. It also benefits from adding one can of Diced tomatoes. Leftovers are a little dry but can be eaten cold. Husband liked it and he is not a pasta fan. Will make it again.

I'm not sure I've given any other dishes 4 forks before, but this dish, and more to the point, the MULTITUDE of variations I've made on this recipe, is fantastic. I've done it with cheese and without (actually prefer the latter); I've probably tried it with 6 different kinds of sausage (though always chicken or turkey), and I think every single ingredient has been toyed with along the way. And yet IT ALWAYS WORKS! And it always works with ingredients I have on hand - in fact, we call it "pantry penne" here b/c we never have to run out to the grocery to make it. My favorite changes: try a little goat cheese (maybe 2-3 oz, max) tossed in at the end instead of mozz - it nicely coats the pasta without causing the dreaded clumps. Shallots are lovely but onions do just fine. I use TONS more spinach than originally called for to make it healthier. And if I have them, I throw in some tomatoes (tonight some halved grape tomatoes) at the end for a little extra tanginess. I've used whole wheat pasta with this recipe many times, too, and it still tastes great - there are so many other strong flavors it makes the whole wheat more bearable. I'll stop, but I could go on - this dish is fantastic - just delicious and so user-friendly, too.

I would definitely make this again! So easy! I used chicken apple sausage and added more red pepper (we like it spicy) It was ready in no time. A nice alternative to saucy pasta dishes.

The first thing that struck me about this recipe is that there's too much cooking before you start cooking. So I came up with a pressure cooker version. Saute the shallot, garlic and red pepper in the oil in the pressure cooker. Turn off the heat and add the raw mushrooms (slice them quickly with your egg slicer). Pour in 15 oz of broth (1 can, almost 2 cups). Stir in the uncooked penne. Pierce the skins on the uncooked, uncut sausage and throw them in. I used whole basil leaves instead of spinach. They go next. Cover and bring up to pressure. cook 8 minutes at low pressure. Use a quick release method. Remove the sausage, slice and return to pan. Stir in the cheese. I used grated parmesan and romano mixed. Almost all broth was absorbed after the pasta sat for a few minutes.

I altered portions for a two person meal -- substituted reconstituted shitake mushrooms and cut way down on garlic and mozz cheese (like down to about 1/4 cup at most and added slowly at the very end). Fast and easy. We'll make it again some time. Good Fall meal.

I used hot turkey sausage and as another reviewer suggested, added cheese on top instead of mixed in. Very good, will definitely make again!!

Very easy and flavorful--didn't have any cheese problems, but I used very finely grated mozzarella. Crimini mushrooms were very flavorful and the dish tasted even better the next day reheated.

I liked all the flavors involved, but found that the cheese didn't melt smoothly, and tended to make the spinach clump up. I think I'll try again, but I'll mix the mozzarella directly into the sauce before adding the pasta. Also, I used turkey sausage with sun dried tomatoes and they were a great accent!

Rating: 3
Okay, so I changed it a bit... I didn't use mushrooms (didn't have any) changed the shallots for yellow onions, used used only 1 cup of chicken broth, and just used some shaved parm. cheese at the end instead of the provelone or mozzarella. By reducing the cheese, I saved a bunch of fat from the dish... It was a much lighter version, which I was looking for, and delicious. I didn't even miss the mushrooms!

Rating: 2
I made this for my parents, and they both enjoyed it. I was less enthusiastic about it, but I think it's because of the sausage I used, an Italian pork sausage that didn't give it the flavor I was expecting. Next time I'll try some of the more exotic chicken sausages or this trusted Italian turkey sausage I've used before. To avoid the clumping cheese problem, I served the cheese in a separate bowl and let everyone put on as much as they wanted. I think that made a difference.

This was very good. I normally make pasta dishes with tomato so this was a good change of pace. I used rotini instead of penne, hot italian chicken sausages and I think it turned out well.

I have made this dish many times, since it was first published and love it...as do my friends. Who says every pasta dish has to have tomatoes? I quite like the chicken broth...it's different. I always use hot Italian sausage (and pork, not turkey), frozen spinach works fine, by all means use the hot pepper flakes for a kick, and as for the cheese, I don't think it's too much...make sure it's grated, don't add it all at the same time, and you shouldn't have a problem. Love this site and use it all the time, and it's great to see what other cooks have done to improvise and/or improve a dish.

I made this recipe and found (a) it's easy, but it does take awhile because of chopping the mushrooms and cooking the sausage, and (b) the cheese completely clumped all the ingredients together. I love pasta dishes with spinach and a chicken broth base, but this one really lacked flavor. I thought this would be such a hit because we love all the ingredients involved, but it was pretty much a flop. I can't figure out how you'd add 2 cups of cheese without it clumping. I wonder if using fusilli would make a difference?

This was just so-so. I thought it was missing tomatoes. There was a lot of liquid after cooking the mushrooms, I just let it evaporate out before adding the spinach and broth. There was too much cheese. Maybe a finely grated mozzarella or parmesan would have worked added slowly.

This turned out very well. I would stick to crimini or baby bella or white mushrooms -- I threw in some sliced shiitake mushrooms, but they were lost among the flavors.

This was a really weird recipe. It was very watery! I would suggest draining after sauteeing the mushrooms. There was too much broth, not enough spinach, and way too much cheese. The cheese/spinach/sausage clumped together and separated from the pasta. I poured out most of the broth so it would mix beter. The cheese made this a heavy dish. We probably won't make it again.

This recipe calles for WAY to much cheese. I suggest cutting the amount of cheese in half, but add a little parmesean to garnish. I also added some sundried tomatoes and really liked how the flavors blended. I also substituted a little red wine for some of the stock. Overall not a bad recipe, but heed my words: To much cheese = unhappy pasta.

This is a great, easy recipe. I used turkey sausage and removed the meat from the casing before cooking. As you brown the sausage meat, cut it up into bite size pieces with a wooden spoon. I also used about twice the amount of garlic. Other helpful hints: cut the fresh spinach up and add the shredded cheese slowly. I would also undercook the penne a bit. This dish is even better the next day but the pasta becomes overcooked in the microwave.

My family raved about this recipe. They actually fought over the leftovers. I did use Italian sausage and probably was a little generous in my use of red pepper flakes. The sauce was lovely and creamy -- no cheese clumps at all. I've even used frozen spinach (lacking the availability of edible fresh spinach at the grocers') and had no complaints.

This was great...fast, easy and the sauce was light. I didn't have enough mushrooms so I added 1/2 sweet red pepper (diced) to the saute. To avoid the mozzarella from clumping I added it slowly and stirred after each addition ~ worked fine. Great leftovers!

This is one of my wife's favorite pasta dishes to eat. I usually make it after work since it doesn't take a lot of time. She doesn't like the pepper flakes, so I sprinkle them on my own plate at the table. I also have had trouble with the mozzarella clumping. Next time, I'll try serving the cheese at the table and see how that works.

This recipe had great flavor. I had to cheat a little, as I had about half the spinach & sausage called for. I tried to adjust the amount of broth, etc., but still ended up having to drain it off. Despite all this, I'd make this again in a heartbeat.

Wow, i can hardly imagine not enjoying this. It tasted fantastic.. our dinner guests thought so too. I made it as a first course.. no one wanted to move on to the main event! Now i did experience some difficulty with "clumping mozzarella".. perhaps the cheap part-skim brand was to blame? But it did not combine into a creamy sauce, as i'd expected. No problem since i dished it out in the kitchen, carefully including some stringy cheese clumps in each serving and pouring the somewhat brothy "sauce" over it. The sauce absorbed into the dish well.. and the guests liked the cheese just as it was. On visual presentation, I may have been less happy about setting a bowl of it out at a pot-luck! However, on taste you cannot beat this one. This one could easily become a main-entree family dinner staple. I used shiitake mushrooms. You could probably substitute half the shiitakes for regular mushrooms, to save on cost. But as the 'wild' flavour is a major attraction of the dish, i'd always be sure to include a few.

I made this dish for a pot luck event. I made the following changes: Sweet onions (maui, I think) instead of shallots, cremini mushrooms, roasted chicken sausages flavored with peppers and onions. I then baked the whole thing in a 13 by 9 baking dish, and topped it with halfthe shredded mozzarella cheese and a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese. I baked it at 375 for about 25 minutes, until hot and bubbly. It came out good but I missed the tomato sauce. I might try this one again with that addition.

When you have to fill a whole magazine with recipes every month, I guess they can't all be winners. This one is a stinker.
