Boring, bland, and SO not worth the effort. The cod was more flavorful than the "sauce!"

I have made this recipe twice now with great success, and am now adding it permanently to my recipe rotation because it's so simple and fast (and I receive many complements from my dinner guests). The first time I made it with Atlantic cod and the second I made with Sea Bass. A few tips for those of you who have had poor results: -Be sure to continually taste your sauce, as the acidity of the lemon juice and saltiness of the olives can quickly overwhelm the sauce. I use olives and lemon juice sparingly until I've reached the right taste. -Some olives are quite salty, I used good Cerignola olives, which I think are less salty then canned olives. -I've substituted picked lemons the first time, which were excellent, but very salty. -I fried the fish for exactly 3 minutes and baked the fish for exactly 8 minutes, which seemed ideal way to cook moist fish -If you sauce is too thin at the end, take out and cover your fish, and reduce the sauce again on the stove until desired consistency. - Black pepper and tons of fresh oregano have really made my dish sing.

This got so many good reviews that I expected a WOW!! I bought cod from whole foods and it wasn't the best. BUT, sauce - what sauce? Runny liquid with olives? that's what I got. I did find picholine olives.

I sauteed some garlic in the frying pan before searing, and also seasoned the fish with some jerk rub (I am jamaican!). A keeper!!!

Crazily enough, despite not really liking olives, I was a big fan of the extra dimension they added to the fish in this recipe. Really good, even with dried oregano.

This turned out VERY BADLY for me. I had to throw everything out as it all became too watery and salty/sour tasting.

The olive oil base goes really well with halibut which tends to be a lower fat, drier tasting fish.

The flavors were absolutely delicious. We used castelvetrano olives, which have a fresher flavor, but that was the only substitution. (Just smashed the olives to remove the pits and added smashed.) The only problem we encountered was in getting the fish good and seared. It just would not release. Hot pan, dry fish, but 4 minutes were not enough and it stuck like the dickens. Even with that problem, the dish was lovely and would definitely risk a repeat sticking to have this again.

Wow. This was really good for the time and effort it took. Fantastic weeknight entree - I think it took all of 20 minutes to pull together. We thought the olives really made the dish, but we also spooned the sauce over prepared frozen mixed vegetables (all I had in the house) and they were actually edible with the sauce spooned over them!!! Wow! I ended up making this with catfish because I thought I had some halibut in the freezer but couldn't find it. I was a little worried about the strength of the flavor of the fish, but it turned out great. I should've read more reviews before making it - the artichoke hearts sound like a great idea. Will be doing that next time.

This was a very simple fish recipe. Thought I grabbed olives at the store only to find mid-through that I didn't have any. Still had great flavor, nice quick and easy dish.

I had fresh oregano and I wanted fish. This was lovely. I actually used basa swai fish. Which is apparently Vietnamese farmed catfish. The fish was very mild so the brine from the green olives really stood out in a good way.

I agree...quick, easy & yummy. I used halibut and decreased the amount of oil by half. It was still very good.

This was an easy, fast and tasty recipe for fish. I used Dutch Seawolf fish for the recipe. Alias known as Atlantic wolf fish, which is a mild white fish that is very meaty and on the thick side. I chose to follow several of the reviews and added lemon zest and some artichoke hearts (the ones bottled in oil)to the recipe. It turned out fabulous. This is definitely a great way to make a quick and delish weeknight meal.

Lovely fish entree. I added the zest from the lemon to add a bit more flavor and zing. Works very well as "packet fish" on the grill if you put all the ingredients in the packet first"

This was such an easy recipe. This is the first time I've cooked fish at home & this was a good introduction. I also added artichokes which I thought was a nice addition. I used striper fillets that I bought from Trader Joe's. I would definitely make this again!

Made this using Rainbow Trout and skipped the olives - Awesome. Piece of cake to make... just be sure to cook down that wine enough to get rid of the alcohol taste.

Great recipe and one we make probably twice a month. My wife hates olives so we use two tbsp of capers and we use tilapia filets instead of halibut.

this was a really easy, and relatively cheap fish dish to make...i am always on the look out for interesting week night meals, and this one definitely suits that criteria...but i can think of a million different ways i'd rather prepare fish

Fantastic!! Love the olives!

Good and delicious but not beyond compare. What surprises me is that it needs so few ingredients; and it is quick and easy to prepare. Even my eldest daughter, she's 19, who doesn't really fancy fish, ate up every bit of it. I used capers instead of olives and reduced the olive oil to two tablespoons. I used only a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. The fish didn't cook at 450F after 8 minutes even though the oven heat circulation was assisted by a fan. Mine's an Electrolux built-in electric oven. It's the latest model which I bought six months ago. So, I baked the fish for another 7 minutes also at 450F and it turned out just nice. All in all it took 15 minutes of baking time. Next time I'll reduce it to just 12 minutes to see if the fish will turn out jucier. I'm thinking of serving this to my guests over the weekend.

Followed recipe as per instructions - a big hit! Have added this plate to my "Sure thing" section.

We used the tiny picholine olives -- delicious but a pain to pit -- and fresh oregano. This is a nice, quick after-work dish, but kind of bland, we thought.

Great and easy recipe for the newly *epicurious*! The key is having a great fish fillet, but overall it's pretty hard to screw up. The olives are really just to season the fillets, and I wouldn't recommend eating them afterward!

simple, quick, delicious, looked beautiful. used white trout which worked well, not too dry.

terrific fish dish

Great taste. I, too, used kalamata olives...fresh out of picholines!! I suggest that the fish be baked at a lower temp. or for a shorter amount of time. The halibut was a little dry.

This recipe added a nice flavor to our halibut and it was very easy, but I will most likely try another the next time. I would suggest this simple recipe though if time is limited.

We enjoyed the flavor of this but were a bit disappointed in the halibut...it seemed slightly dry...I will make it again using talapia,sea bass, or even orange roughy.

We made the recipe as written with halibut filets. We really loved it. Very easy and delicious. I do plan to make this for company.

This was an easy to prepare and tasty dish. I agree with the previous reviewer that this would be a good dish to make for guests. I used talapia instead of halibut and it tasted fine.

I usually prepare a recipe exactly as it is written, the first time however, I had only Kalamata olives in the larder, so I used these. It was very easy, tasty and fast! I will make it for company as it looks attractive plated. I cut back on the oregano a tad, as it is a very pungent herb. I served it with "minted peas" which made a very colourful and active presentation
