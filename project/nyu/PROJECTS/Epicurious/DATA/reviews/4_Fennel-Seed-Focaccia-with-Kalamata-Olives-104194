I followed other people's advice and used 2tsp salt instead of 4 and it was fine salt-wise. I didn't have fennel seend so I used a mixture of rosemary and herbs de provence which came out interesting. The texture is great, better than other foccacia recipes I've tried, although it didn't have as many holes as in the picture and I like holes in my bread. I'm not sure what I have to do or not do to get that effect. This recipe is time-consuming though, not something to do during finals.

I wish I had listened to the previous reviewer, this really was too salty. I think it's worthwhile to try it, but cut way back on the salt.

This was very good and worth all the waiting. The only problem was that it ended up being much too salty. Next time, I will be sure not to use brine-cured olives. This is coming from a true salt-lover, so beware.

A super focaccia!...just don't make it when you have a lot of other things to do. We did it like the true Italians and had a dish of balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping. I substituted anise seeds for the fennel and I'm guessing I got similar results.
