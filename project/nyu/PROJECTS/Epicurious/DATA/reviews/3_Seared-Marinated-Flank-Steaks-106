My wife and I usually only cook from these best cookbooks. So we had to try this, and it was great.

I thought this was way too wine-y. Maybe because I marinated at the upper length of time. But there are other better marinades out there.

Delicious low-fat marinade. I added the juice of 1 lemon and grilled it instead of pan cooking. Plan to make again soon.

Overall I thought it was a good recipe. I added a little hot sauce and dijon mustard to it along with a little olive oil and I got great feedback from everyone.

This is a very easy do ahead recipe. Great for sunday dinner with the family. I also pepared a deglace with mushrooms from the skillet drippings. Family enjoyed it with brown rice and a nice salad.

I left the steak whole, cut it acros the grain after it was cooked. Sauteed mushrooms and chopped green onions in butter, added a little marinade and served this over the top of the steak. Ummm good!

To this marinade, I add 1/4C Red Wine Vinegar and 1/4C Olive Oil, 1T Dry Mustard and 1T Worcheshire. Marindade overnight. DO NOT over cook. Slice thin on bias with sharp knife. Very good.

I liked this recipe, but I would turn the heat down just a little bit so that it gets a little more done on the inside. I sautéed a red bell pepper & served it on top of the steaks to add some color and a different flavor. All in all, it was pretty good.

the steak became very tender, even though it was low-grade meat and tit was very tasty on the bbq.

ONE OF MY HUSBANDS FAVORITES. WE HAVE MADE THIS DISH SEVERAL TIMES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. ORIGINALLY MADE WITH (8) SMALLER STEAKS AND SEEMED TO HAVE MORE FLAVOR.
