These are outrageously good. They are labor intensive and require patience but the recipe delivers. I did take a signifcant shortcut with the ice cream filling. I used a quality vanilla ice cream, softened it and quickly mixed in some freshly grated orange rind and Dundee's Orange marmalade, spread it on a lined cookie sheet to freeze (about 5/8") and refroze the preparation. Procede with recipe as written. These sophisticated little ice cream sandwiches are the perfect last bite.

Much too little flour. Recipe too iffy...not practical at all. Classic Florentine cookies have more flour, more structure and better results (and taste). If you've never made this type of lacy delicate cookies, try a better recipe in a relialble dessert/baking cookbook. Even experienced will have problems with this one.

a few suggestions...keep the dough chilled between baking batches or they will become too lacy. Keep them well apart on the cookie sheet too or you will get a sheet of florentines instead of individual ones( as I did..no tragedy, I just cut them into shape) I think maybe a couple more t of flour would be good

I can only vouch for the florentines, not the ice cream, although it sounds great. I made the florentines for my mother's birthday, and shipped them across country to her overnight delivery. I included a copy of the recipe, and a note saying that this gift "requires some assembly"!! She has an ice cream maker, and she makes her own fabulous orange marmalade... so I figured she was better equipped. A note about the florentines: make absolutely sure they have begun to turn golden... a moment's difference in time means they never turn crisp or fully dry out. I took one batch out a tiny bit too soon--actually it was the same amount of time, but they were cooler (dough is chilled) than the second batch going IN. The second batch sat out waiting its turn, so was warmer. I used Valrhona 71% dark chocolate. WOW.
