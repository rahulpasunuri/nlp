This was a great pound cake. I used it in my lamb mold for Easter, and frosted it with a mascarpone whipped cream frosting--Wonderful! (The recipe did make enough for a second, smaller loaf as well, but no one was complaining.)

Exceptional cake! I made this for a July 4th party, and it was a huge hit. The lime zest and 2 juices are a perfect complement to the pistachios. I had to bake the cake (in a loaf pan of the proper size) for about and hour and 45 minutes. This recipe is a keeper.

Amazing! Delicious, simple and good looking cake. BUT I made changes. I have not made this in a loaf pan (used a tube pan like some other reviewers), but I am inclined to agree with other reviewers that there may be a mistake in the measurements. I used all lemon zest/juice because that's what I had on hand, and I love lemony deserts. However, I'm sure it would be great with the mix of citrus flavors as well. Also, I added some extra pistachios on top. My boyfriend who is not a bigger sweet eater loved this cake. Will definitely be making again.

I have made this twice already. It is so delicious and turned out perfectly. I did not have any of the problems other reviewers mentioned. Last night I served it accompanied with Creme Fraiche Sorbet (BA 4/09) which was scrumptious!! There was barely a crumb left! This one is a keeper!

This cake is delicious, I made it in a tube pan as I could see that the amount was too big for a loaf pan, yummy and lovely to look at too, I have made it twice with rave reviews

I totally agree with Joy, exactly the same thing happened to me! All over the oven, the misshapen cake that resulted tasked good, but I believe there is an error in either the measurements or instruction for a loaf pan! I even measured my loaf pan to make sure it was correctly 9x5x3. I think the ingredients are yummy, but I am disappointed that after using such expensive ingredients the recipe failed!

This was very tasty--the citrus flavors play nicely with the salty nuts. I didn't have any limes on hand, so I used the zest of the lemon, and instead of oranges, I used minneolas. YUMMY! However, I made the mistake of using a standard size loaf pan, and the batter baked up and out and spilled onto the oven floor to burn. The cake itself was therefore deformed and took nearly TWO HOURS to bake! I should have gone with my first inclination and baked it in a bundt pan, reducing the bake time as the first reviewer did. Oh well! Live and learn...

Absolutely outstanding! Simple yet rich. Needs no adornment. I did not make in a loaf pan, I prefer a tube pan and reduced the baking time. Dusted with a little powdered sugar and it was gone in no time. A great "go to" recipe that is easy and different.
