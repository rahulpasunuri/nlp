I make this with frozen pearl onions. Works just fine and saves on tons of prep. You can definitely sub some milk or lighter cream for all the heavy cream w/o losing taste but do NOT lose the cloves or parsley and do NOT add breadcrumbs or cheese or you'll lose the subtlety.

I've been looking for a good recipe for creamed onions and I think I've finally found it. These were really good and very simple to prepare. I too followed the peeling instructions on the bag and parboiled the onions before popping them out of their skins, then I prepared them exactly per the directions. Just before serving, I transferred them to a serving dish and sprinkled them with a combination of equal parts bread crumbs with freshly grated Reggiano-Parmesan, then placed the dish under the broiler for a few minutes. The topping gives them a little added flavor. These were a big hit with everyone at Thanksgiving this year !

It's really simple folks! when a recipe calls for cream, try using evaporated milk. It won't curdle and the flavor and texture are excellent without overwhelming what you're cooking

I made these along with brandied mushrooms, shrimp stuffed potatoes and Standing Rib roast. Great combo, these were a hit and one guest said they were better than his traditional creamed onions on Thanksgiving. Cloves are the key. Use lighter cream, for sure.

This is a tasty dish. I made a few modifications based on other creamed onion recipes on this site. I used whole cloves instead of ground cloves, starting with them in the onion-boiling water and leaving them in while the cream sauce was cooking, then taking them out before serving. This made for a more subtle flavor. I also topped the finished dish with breadcrumbs and put it in the oven to brown, using the gratin technique from the recipe for Four-Onion Gratin.

This is the best recipe for creamed onions I have ever tried. I made it for my father at Thanksgiving and he loved it! My husband did too! I did make some substitutions though, and I have made it again and again to much acclaim! I followed the recipe on the onion bag for peeling them and therefore blanched them in water whole, drained and cut off root end to pop peeled onion out. Also, boiled the onions in chicken broth (can use instant boulion) for a long time, to ensure proper cooking. I tripled the onion quantity, keeping everything else the same. Also, I used light cream to make it a bit less heavy and I don't add the parsley. Trust me, if you do this, the dish becomes OUTSTANDING! The cloves are a wonderful idea by the way.

This was very tasty, I think because of some changes I made. I left the baby onions whole. The only way to easily peel them is to blanch them first for a minute in boiling water. To the sauce I added a pinch of ground mace and cayenne pepper. I noted the other review and used just over half a cup of heavy cream, and the rest 2 percent milk. It does need plenty of salt and pepper. Since I was cooking for two, I used half the amount of onions, but the entire amount of sauce. To the sauce and onions I added a generous handful of lightly cooked baby green peas. This was an altogether satisfying side dish for Thanksgiving dinner. Note: I saw somewhere else the suggestion for topping the onions with buttered bread crumbs and running the dish under the broiler - that sounds good to me.

Just so-so. I thought the cream was too heavy, maybe it's better to use some extra onions (as the other reviewer suggested) to cut down on the heaviness. Or use some milk instead of some cream. They definitely need salt. I was disappointed, I won't make them again.

Absolutely delicious. So good that my houseguests were digging into the onions first thing Friday (after Thanksgiving) morning...even before they hit the stuffing. The cloves lend such an intriguing flavor to the sauce. I added an extra bag of whole onions, because the small pieces seemed to be lost in such a substantial cream sauce. It worked well to have some onions in small pieces and others whole.
