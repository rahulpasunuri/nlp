I made a lot of substitutions since I didn't feel like going to the store and spending money (used ground beef instead of sausage, dried basil instead of fresh) but it still ended up tasting great. Next time I'll cut back on the oil and maybe add another can of tomato paste as the sauce seemed to slide off the pasta instead of stick to it.

Made this dish the other day and it is amazing but it is important to get a good quality sausage. Freezes great and overall this was a very good meat sauce. Takes a while to reduce though:(

This is a fabulous red sauce recipe. I use the Italian sausage that we have specially made each year out of our portion of a friend's farm-grown pig. I highly recommend this sauce exactly as written - it is very flavorful! Thank you!

I made this for a baked ziti a couple of months ago and it was so delicious. I froze what I had leftover and just had it now on a bowl of Barilla's "pipette" pasta with some grated Locatelli and I cannot think of a more satisfying dish of pasta. I will make this again and again with no changes to the recipe.

I omitted the tomato paste and added in a bit of fennel. It was outragous!

My teens loved this! They would not have eaten it if they kwen sausage was in it but they didn't notice. This was gone in 24 hours!

Great sauce, made a few changes...used chicken sausage w/italian seasoning, sauteed and then put in food processor...used plum tomatoes from our garden I put some of the tomatoes thru a press removing the skins and seeds...others I just chopped and put in skin & seeds the whole tomato...used oregano & basil from the garden...added red and white wine and sauteed mushrooms with olive oil and Grated Pecorino Romano...best sauce I have ever had! Leaving it to simmer for 3 hrs or so...and then I'll freeze some...to have in the cold New England winter!

Since I was using meatballs, I thought sausage was a bit of overkill, so I substituted mushrooms. This was delicious, and it stuck to the pasta better than some sauces I've made. Good stuff.

Very easy to make. I added a few large fresh tomatoes, some horse radish, red pepper flakes to make it a bit more spicy. I let it simmer for two hours and it was delicious!

Very good on any kind of pasta. I sometimes add up to a pound of sliced or whole mushrooms (button, wild or a mix of both, sauteed first in butter.) Like many others, I also cut down on the oil.

Great all purpose sauce. I usually substitue a little wine for the water and add a handful of fresh oregano.

A very nice, simple sauce for any pasta. I made it by the recipe last night and it was delicious. Next time I might add something to make it spicy, but the sauce by itself was very good.

This sauce will be the red sauce of choice in our house. We served it last night over my wife's excellent three-cheese and spinach manicotti. Adults and kids both gave it very high marks. I added some fresh chopped oregano and a little more garlic. Outstanding!!

A really good, rich tomato sauce. I'm going to use it for baked ziti.

Great, with a few minor variations. Too much fresh Basil for me, I reduced it to 1/4 c. or pinch dried basil and a pinch of dried oregano. Remember you can always add more to taste. To the tomato paste, add 1/2 c. red wine and 1/2 c. wa ter, mix together then add to pot. Add a pinch of sugar. I like my sauce a little chunkier, so I add 4 fresh ripe plum tomatoes - chopped. Adding 4 chopped sun-dried tomatoes can intensify the flavor also. Other added variations: 1c. carrot - finely chopped, and/or 1 zucchini - fine chop, also eggplant. For meat sauce, add 1 lb. ground chuck-browned or Italian sausage. Reduce olive oil to 2 Tab.. Add meat or meatballs before simmering,as it adds more flavor to the sauce.

EXCELLENT! Great flavor, I served this sauce over linguine. I changed it some. I used 3TB of oil and used crushed tomatoes Italian style and only 6oz of water. This is a keeper.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! Although I changed it quite a bit, the flavour was very good. I cut the recipe in half, used Hot Italian Sausage, used only 2 TB of oil (you do not need anymore than this), ommitted the tomato paste, added an extra 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and ommitted the water. I served it with penne (pasta). This made enough for my husband, myself and two kids with some left over. My husband enjoyed it very much, I will make this over and over.

This sauce is excellent with the Ricotta and Red Chard Cannelloni here at EPI, http://food.epicurious.com:80/run/recipe/view?id=2165. I reduce the olive oil and sometimes use turkey Italian sausages.

I made this sauce a month ago when I had a lot of fresh tomatoes from the garden, then froze it. Thawed it yesterday and served it with spaghetti last night. It was great. I also used far less oil than called for.

I made this sauce to serve over pasta. It is flavorful and so easy to prepare. I couldn't find fresh basil so I used dried. I agree about not having to use so much olive oil. I doubled the recipe (always do, to freeze some), I think I used, at the most two tbsps of oil.

Very, very good. I made this to go with the Meatballs in Red Sauce, and it worked well. A word of caution: don't overdo it with the olive oil. The recipe calls for starting out with 1/2 cup olive oil, but 1/4 cup -- or even less -- would work fine, I believe. The sausage gives off a bit of its own fat, so I think a tablespoon or two of oil would be plenty. My resulting sauce was a bit oily, especially when I combined it with the meatballs, which had also been fried in plenty of olive oil (cut back on that too) and which gave off some of their own fat. Don't overcook the sauce, either. If you're making it to cook the meatballs in, I would add the meatballs at the very beginning and cook the sauce WITH THE MEATBALLS for no more than an hour. Very rich and dark -- the color of mahogany wood. Very filling, too.
