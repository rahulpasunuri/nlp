Didn't have safflower oil so I subbed 4 tb flaxseed oil and 1 tb walnut oil. Added some parsley and 1/4 cup toasted walnuts. Delish!

just a small tweak...add a grated carrot or two with the beets. Tastes great, and the colors are gorgeous!

These twin salads were a great complement to venison for a midwinter dinner party. Guests kept going back for more.

Simple and healthy! I just eyeballed amounts of liquids and tossed cabbage with basil instead of mint. Also, used nama shoyu in place of soy. I also added the slightest dash of dijon mustard. It tasted excellent on top of a grilled turkey burger.

This was very good - simple and delicious. I didn't use sherry vinegar (I used red wine instead).

Decent recipe. I prefer a little more flavor, but still very good. www.EntertainingRecipes.org

Oh, and use a food processor to grate your beets! It took less than a minute!

Can't stop snacking on the beet salad! No changes necessary. Just simple, lovely ingredients. I'm serving it alongside pot roast and spaetzle for dinner. And I will have it for lunch tomorrow topped with some sharp sheep's milk feta.

My friend bought this over and I loved it. I am new to eating beets and thought that it cut the sweetness perfectly. We changed the recipe by adding a clove of pressed garlic and cutting the sherry vinegar to 1 tbsp and adding 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar. I am trying to add more veggies to our diet, so this is a great alternative to a green salad.

These were really yummy. I used them as the side dishes for the cantal cheese tart, which is also great. However, if you grate and slice by hand, it's a lot of work and a huge mess, so in the future I would invest a little more in complicating the flavor, at least if using them as sides rather than as mere condiments.
