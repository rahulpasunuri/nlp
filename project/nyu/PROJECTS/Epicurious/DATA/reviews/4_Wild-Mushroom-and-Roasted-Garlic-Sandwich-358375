Nice flavors here, but the sandwich idea didn't work for me. I modified it slightly--used a yellow onion instead of a shallot, cilantro instead of parsley, Promise instead of butter, and used the mixture as a pizza topping, using Trader Joe's pizza dough on a pizza stone, with low fat shredded mozzarella as the first layer. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes. That was 4 forks. I'll bet a little truffle oil drizzled on top would be even better.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and the results were quite tasty. I think it would benefit from the addition of cheese. Perhaps Gouda as another reviewer suggested. Also, perhaps I was making hearty sized sandwiches, but the recipe only yielded 4-5, not 6.

Really delicious. I cooked mushrooms longer than the recipe called for to get them nice and brown/carmelized. This is my go-to mushroom recipe.

Fantastic Flavour!! This sandwich can be a real crowd pleaser. I made it with vegan margarine, organic panini, and cooking onions instead of butter, country bread and shallots. The roasted garlic and wine are absolute necessities of this recipe. We added the mushrooms and roasted garlic pre baking and topped with eweda (sheep gouda) to bake then broil, be sure to put the sandwich together after cooking.
