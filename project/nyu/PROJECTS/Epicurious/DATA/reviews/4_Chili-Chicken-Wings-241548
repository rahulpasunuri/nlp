A very delicious sauce  a big hit at dinner tonight. Though it lacked a little something  perhaps some chipotle would add some depth. After reading a couple notes about the sauce burning, I tried a different technique: I lightly coated the wings in rapeseed oil and then baked them at 400 for nearly an hour. Lacking a big enough rack (I made 7 pounds), I drained the schmaltz a couple times (it's in my fridge now, destined for great things). Once the wings were crispy on the outside, I took them out and coated them in sauce. I then put them back in the oven on 250 for about 15 minutes. Gold!

I used aluminum foil on the baking sheet with non stick spray and turned the chicken twice during baking. OMG will definitely put this in my cookbook of recipes. I also made yellow rice and green bean medley

Best wings

I should have added that I baked the wings unsauced - I coated them in the sauce AFTER they were baked. The wings stayed crispy.

These were fabulous. I use a seeded Scoth Bonnet pepper and measured everything into my Vitamix, mixed it up and then heated the sauce to blend the flavors. What works nicely if you like your wings crispy is to roll them in oil, then in flour, tapping off the excess before baking them. this gives them a nice crunch.

P.S..it was not only my baking sheets that got burnt to a crisp but the bottoms of my wings as well! I don't know what I did wrong..made as written..but I was SUPER disapointed..that being said the parts that weren't burned to sh*t were delish! I will perhaps consider making again but will use an entirely different cooking method.

I am making these as I type. Although the sauce smelled delicious when I made it..it is currently turning into a putrid charcoal on the bottom of my baking sheet making the whole house smell horrific. Has anyone had this problem? My baking sheets will probably have to be thrown out..why has this not been mentioned in the recipe or any of the reviews? If these are worthy of being made again I will either cook on a rack or in a greased casserole. For future reference...don't make on a baking sheet...unlees you deem them disposable...and have a bottle of Febreeze handy!

This was awesome! The only addition I made was adding the zest from 2 fresh clementines (an orange would work just the same) and the juice of 1 (saved the juice of the other for the vinaigrette on the salad for a nice pairing), as well as 1 cup of white wine. This is going on my catering menu.

very good recipe. This is my favorite way to make chicken wings

Great recipe. I marinated the wings in all the sauce overnight. To bake, I removed the wings from the sauce onto a baking sheet and started baking. They looked really pale. I boiled the sauce then basted a couple of times (still pretty pale) so I drained the liquid from the wings and broiled them about 8 inches from the heat for about 4 minutes; turned, basted and broiled to finish. A nice color and lots of flavor. They were a big hit.

Fantastic! Sweet and spicy at the same time (I added a little hot sauce too, definitely recommended). It does make tons of sauce (even with basting) so you can almost double the number of wings you prepare. I made this ahead so marinaded the wings in it until I was ready to cook -- I don't think this is necessary, but it worked well.

Too sweet and had no dimension in flavor.

I agree with the other reviewers--these were fantastic; the sauce is the best I've ever made for chicken wings! Will definitely hold on to this recipe.

Made these as written instead of Buffalo wings for a party--they were devoured...the sauce carmelizes nicely, great flavor--a keeper

Wow, this was really good. It makes a lot of sauce, and since I have some left, I'm going to try it on pork tenderloin. I don't know why more people haven't reviewed it - it's tremendous!

I found that marinating the wings for one or two nights worked really well for this recipe.

Easy, flavorful and sticky. This would be a great BBQ sauce for just about any meat. Loved it!

mmm...mmm good!

wonderful! I found this recipe so simple and easy. I added a few extra ingredients to kick up the spice (we like it really spicy at home). Because it made so much sauce I'm making them again tonight!

The sauce for these wings is absolutely delicious. The sweetness contrasted with the spiciness of the peppers is great. I added a few tablespoons of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, which helped with the spiciness, otherwise I followed the recipe. I think that this sauce would be a great sauce for BBQ chicken.
