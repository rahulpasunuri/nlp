delicious!! I only made a few changes. I didn't want to get scotch so I used some bourbon whiskey I had on hand and had to debone the chicken breasts. I also baked them and they were awesome. My boyfriend has decided it was his favorite meal! Gonna make again and maybe put more stuffing in the breasts.

Delish! I used apples from my tree in my back yard and the slaw kept perfectly for days in my back yard. Oh, and I did not use the whisky... didnt have any on hand (unfortunately...)... added a little cream to hold the chicken stuffing together.

Delicious! We only had pounded, thin cutlets and rolled them around the cheese filling. It was definitely messier, but it worked! The combination of sweet, savory, and tangy in this recipe is great.

Very good. I baked the chicken instead of barbecuing. A little too much of the taste of sage.

For this dish, I made a fair number of changes based upon what I had in the house and the fact that I read the recipe wrong - but it actually turned out delicious. I began with skinless chicken breasts, and pounded them until thin (1/4 in.). For the stuffing, I combined extra sharp cheddar cheese (approx. 3/4c.), 1/4c maple syrup, 2 tsp. rosemary, one small sauteed shallot, 1/4c whiskey (used Seagrams 7), and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. At this point I realized I had been distracted in conversation with a friend, but decided to proceed anyways. I then placed some of the mixture across one length of the chicken and rolled it into a tight cylinder. Then I secured with toothpicks, seared the outside on the stovetop and then baked them at 350. I also melted a small amount of the leftover cheese mix and drizzled on top of the chicken. Sounds bizarre, but was quite wonderful.

This dish is wonderful. I have made it several times and my family loves it each time, my 4 year old even asks for it on a regular basis. The cheese was a little difficult to find in my grocery store (it's with the speciality cheeses in most stores, mine just had a weak selection) but that is the only downfall. I also made just the chicken part a few time, to save time, and it turns out fine. For anyone needing gluten free recipes I would definitely suggest trying this one.

This recipe definitely needs that tenderloin attached to ensure the stuffing doesn't escape. Not having access to a barbecue/grill I did it in the oven - not quite as pretty, but still tastes good. I was initially worried about the use of maple syrup in every single part of the recipe, but it actually works really well, and as an added bonus, the leftover sauce is gonna make a really good topping on the vanilla ice-cream we've got in the freezer :-)

I thought this dish was great and it was only about an hour and a half from start to finish. I used a bit less maple syrup than the recipe called for in the sauce. I also added a little rosemary (one or two tablespoons) and also a tablespoon or so dijon mustard to the stuffing and it had a wonderful effect. helpful hint: it's important to really hollow out the breast a bit for the stuffing.

The description for a one-fork review is "okay." Truthfully, I don't even think this rates an "okay." No one in my family cared for the maple syrup taste in this recipe.

I've made the chicken portion of this many times now, it's a favorite of my firends and family. The slaw was less than exciting, but the chicken and whiskey sauce is truely outstanding. the flavors are out of this world.

Loved the slaw..the rest I wasn't that crazy about. Color and taste just not that exciting! Everyone, try the slaw-it is really good. Use w/ pork, etc

This was the best chicken ever!!! I used skinless breasts so wraped a slice of bacon around each breast before barbecue. Outstanding! Along with the apple slaw I served your recipe for brown butter-scallion mashed potatoes, used a regular onion sliced very thin and browned it in the butter. Yummy!

Peculiar. I felt like I was on a culinary fieldtrip to Vermont. Although the tastes were interesting, I would not make this again. Maybe the smoked cheddar I used was too strong but I don't care to try again!

Overe the top fantastic, quick and easy. I can't understand a negative review. I used regular skinless breast, stuffed them, popped them in a pan at 350, brushed them a few times with the reserved basting sauce and cooked them about 45 minutes. I made them early in the day, covered them with foil and reheated for dinner. The were moist and juicy and absolutely delicious. Oh and I used dried powdered sage. The slaw is also great, I didn't peel the apples but I will next time, the skins were a little chewy. So. so good. Make this!!!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I also added extra cheese in the stuffing. I didn't think this dish was time consuming at allI and will definately make again. Basting sauce was delicious and went very well with my roasted pumpkin. Apple slaw was also very good.

This is awesome! I don't even really like chicken, but wow; exception! Brined skinless, boneless breasts and used smoked gouda as per suggestions. Baked 45 at 350 as per other suggestions. Time consuming, yes, but the acidic slaw and the cheesy, stuffingy chicken is just perfect. Well worth the effort, indeed, and it can all be prepped ahead of time.

I lightly browned the chicken in a skillet and then baked at 350 for 45 minutes, basting occasionally. I thought it was delicious. I served with the apple slaw (delicious) and acorn squash (also topped with the sauce). I think you could substitute smoked gouda for the cheddar. California Chardonnay was definitely the right wine pick for this meal.

This was solidly good and I truly enjoyed the unusual slaw. Like others, the filling oozed quite a bit and much was lost in the grill. While this is not at all a disappointing meal, the time versus results payoff isn't quite worth it for me. I'd order it in a restaurant if I saw it on the menu though, so don't be disuaded from trying...

I thought this recipe was delicious. Have read the other reviews and agree that it is difficult to keep stuffing in place. I used toothpicks to seal the breasts. I also added some chopped smoked bacon to enhance to flavor of the stuffing.

Even with the skewers most of the stuffing fell out. It was good, but a lot of work

To the cook in Alexandria, After reading this recipe I decided that it might be better made using boneless chicken breasts. I butterflied the chicken breasts to stuff them. I then used my trusty needle and thread that I use for Thanksgiving and sewed the breasts back together. I had very minimul loss of the stuffing and it was delicious. I also doubled the recipe for the stuffing and used twice as much in each breast. Butterflying the breasts allowed me to use more stuffing creating a more rounded breast.

We thought this was delicious, however it was difficult to seal the stuffing in & much of it leaked out during grilling. Since we like it, we are going to try it again attempting to seal it more carefully and maybe double the stuffing since there wasn't much to go between 4 breasts.

We typically love everything off of this site, but we weren't all that impressed with this dish. It looks beautiful, but it didn't have very much flavor.
