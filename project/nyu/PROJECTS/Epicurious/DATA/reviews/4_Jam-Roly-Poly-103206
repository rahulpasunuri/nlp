I doubled the recipe for the dough and also made Spotted Dick with it. My English hubby was in heaven. I served it with Byrds custard.He said it tasted authentic and yummy. Really nice served on these cold winter evenings. I used butter instead of the suet without any substantial effect to the final product. Recipe was quite easy and fun. Try it!
