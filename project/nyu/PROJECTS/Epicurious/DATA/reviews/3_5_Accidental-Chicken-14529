I am always looking for new recipes for roasted chicken and vegetables and I thought this one had a lot of potential. The spice rub smelled good and it smelled great while it was cooking. The end result however was disappointing and not all that flavourful. There are much better recipes for roasted poultry and veggies on this site...my family's favorite is the cornish hens with paprika and caraway.

This is a wonderful recipe. It is different! I made it a few times. It is always a success.
