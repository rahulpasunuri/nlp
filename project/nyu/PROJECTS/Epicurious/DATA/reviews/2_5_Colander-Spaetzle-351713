Though this recipe may not be the traditional method or ingredients, it is still good! I make it all the time. It's an easy lunch for the kids... and I make it with a whole milk local yogurt that is very liquidy. Maybe that's why I have success. Either way, the simple fact that it is not exactly the same as every traditional recipe does not make it bad... it's just different. Maybe if we call it something different all you elitist will calm it down!

I almost fell over when I saw ricotta cheese as the first ingredient - not authentic at all. Spaetzle presses can be easily found (last I checked I saw one on Target-dot-com) and making spaetzle that way really isn't very messy.

Spaetzle has always been too much work for tiny lumps of boiled dough--no matter what technique you use. Although piping a thin stream into boiling water while rapidly swirling a sharp knife seems to make a nice spaetzle shape and size.

Skeptical, but we tried it. BIG MISTAKE. Even bigger mess. Batter was too thick, and the idea of "holding the collander over boiling water, while pressing dough through the holes" is ludicrous. Can you say, "Steam Burns?" What a poorly written recipe! Like I said, we tried it. All got tossed out, and we re-made with our tried and true spaetzle recipe ... the simple eggs and flour and salt kind ... cut it on the cutting board like MorMor did. Grannie always knew best.

Lots of people rated this recipe and didn't try it. From what I see, two people tried it and rated it 3 and 2 forks. While I admit, that the first ingredient selection seems a little inauthentic, I am eager for a recipe that allows me to make spaetzle with a colander. The spaetzle press is a great thing, but some of us in foreign countries can't get it, even on-line. I believe the original method is one previously described with a cutting board and a knife - a swift fluid movement that dribbles the batter into the boiling water. But making spaetzle that way takes alot of hard-earned skill. Not having the skill, or the press, I'd love to be able to make spaetzle with a colander. I love spaetzle with a rich, deep, mushroom sauce as with Bavarian Jaeger Schnitzel.

I agree with several of the critics of this recipe. It is anything but authentic and I won't even attempt to try it. The original way to make Spaetzle is by wetting a wooden board and slicing narrow strips of dough into the boiling salted water which is quite time consuming. Then came the spaetzle "machine" which looks like a grater with a small box on top into which you put the dough and by moving it back and forth it drops little pieces into the pot with the boiling water. Last, not least the potato ricer with the larger insert.This results into a noodle like product. Timing varies with the size of the spaetzle. They need to be removed as soon as they float to the top and transferred to a strainer. When they are all done, put them into a frying pan with a little butter and reheat them. The basic batter is always flour, eggs milk, a little salt and nutmeg. Proportions vary with different recipes. I learned from a real Swabian chef his secret for a lighter product, I would check with other reviewers about the basic recipes for "real" spaetzle, but add a couple of tablespoons farina and let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes before putting it into boiling water. We like to eat them with a little grated Swiss cheese or add chopped pieces of ham heated with the Spaetzle, served with a nice salad as a side dish.

In Hungary and nearby European countries, they have dishes very similar to spaetzel. Each will have it's own variation, and in Hungary, you can make "cheese noodles" as it's loosely translated, which is a general recipe but with cottage cheese added (their cottage cheese is slightly different to ours). Either way, a spaetzel press/machine is a great idea and will make the job quicker. I sometimes add fresh finely chopped parsley to mine and when served with butter and some cracked pepper, they are delicious.

I made this recipe with ricotta. Unsurprisingly, the batter was quite thick after only 1.5 cups of flour -- so I simply left out the last cup. It was wonderful. I don't own a colander with large enough holes, unfortunately, so I used my time-honored technique of massaging the batter through a holey spatula. :)

I would never make this recipe again. I used some great Greek Yogurt and the batter turned into a thick dough. There was no way I could push it through a colander. I dropped some batter into the boiling water and the dumpling like results tasted very bland. Completely unpalatable. I threw out the rest. Not a good first experience with Spaeztle.

Thank you for this recipe! I adore spaetzle, but have always thought I needed a spaetzle maker. I can't wait to try this out!

My grandmother, who hailed from Mannheim, used to put the dough onto a cutting board, and with a lickety split chopping motion sliced bits into the boiling water. And they were delicious - no ricotta in them either.

Would not even begin to make this. I learned how to make spaetzle when our German exchange student showed up with a "Spaetzle Press" as a gift. If the batter is more like dough then add more milk, it should be slightly thicker than pancake batter. She likes the spaetzle pan-fried with butter after it is removed from the boiling water and strained.

My favorite spaeztle recipe for use with a Spaeztle Hex (NO idea where that name came from): 3 cups all purpose flour, 1 tsp salt, 6 large eggs, 4 Tbsp water, freshly-ground nutmeg. Mix it so smooth that it's even a little bubbly. It will be thick. Grind through spaetzle hex into boiling salted water. When cooked spaetzle rise to surface of water, stir and cook about 20 seconds more (they really do not need any longer). Toss with butter, salt, pepper, and maybe some snipped chives.

Good dish, bad execution. And spaeztle with ricotta?? To easily form great spaeztle, I love using one of these: http://www.aaltonet.com/spaetzle/ . It works like a meat grinder, and you just grind into your boiling water. I got mine at a gourmet kitchen store, but I'm sure it's available in a variety of places online. Be sure to mix your dough until it's really smooth--it's not like biscuits where you want to stir until just combined. You can stir and stir and stir and it won't hurt it. I like some fresh-grated nutmeg in my spaetzle.

This receipt is idiotic. WHERE are you going to find "Greek Yogurt"!! My grandmother was German from the Sudetenland (German Czechoslovakia) and made this and it's Czech "[lski" version as well. BOTH are served with toasted Bread Crumbs. First off, where would Germans get Greek Yogurt OR ricotta cheeze!!?? How Absurd! Here's the way a REAL GERMAN makes it: Ingredients: * 3 cups all-purpose flour * 1/2 tsp salt * 1/4 tsp ground or freshly grated nutmeg * 4 eggs * 1 cup milk * 1 cup fine dry breadcrumbs (optional) * 4 T butter (optional) Preparation: Combine flour, salt and nutmeg. Add eggs and mix. Pour milk into the dough little by little, until a smooth batter forms, slightly thinner than brownie batter. Let rest at least 5 minutes. Bring 2 quarts of water with 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a heavy, 4 - 5 quart saucepan. Plan on boiling at least 2 batches from this recipe. Set a large colander (one with large holes) over the saucepan and press the dough, a few spoonfuls at a time, through the holes directly into the water. Boil for 5-8 minutes until the noodles are tender to the bite. Remove noodles with a slotted spoon and drain further in a sieve. Toss with roasted breadcrumbs to serve. To make breadcrumbs: Melt and stir 4 tablespoons butter in a pan over medium heat until butter stops foaming. Add 1 cup breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until crumbs are browned. Drain on paper towels.

What did I do wrong? I could NOT get the dough through the colander holes. Pretty frustrating since the rest of dinner was waiting! I will not even try to make again.

I can't imagine this actually working, or working well. I've tried similar things, and all of them just made a sticky mess. I make standard Spaetzle dough, and I push it through a potato ricer, using the die with the largest holes. It works great, and it's available at any Crate & Barrel.

I'm a bit perplexed at the recipe, just looking at it. The texture and liquidity of ricotta, Greek yogurt, and buttermilk are extremely different. Even regular yogurt (not strained as Greek yogurt is) is thicker than buttermilk. Ricotta is much thicker than either of the other two. I can't help but think that you would get wildly different results depending on your choice of dairy product in this recipe.

interesting, I have never heard of a spätzle recipe with ricotta. If you want to read my adventures with making traditional schwabian spätzle, read here: http://americanwolpertinger.blogspot.com/2009/03/real-german-cuisine-challengekasespatzl.html

I use a very similar spaetzle recipe, but instead of using a colander I put the batter into a gallon size storage bag. I then snip off a very small corner and pipe the batter into the water. I get some pieces that are a bit longer than traditional spaetzle, but it's very fast (and you can always snip them right in the pot with a kitchen scissors)

To amanda: did you use buttermilk or cheese?

This was a total flop. I made the recipe according to directions and the spaetzle would not come thru the holes of the colander. I even enlisted my husband to help squeeze the batter thru while I held the bowl. I ended up spooning lumps of batter into the boiling water and the effect was way off the mark.
