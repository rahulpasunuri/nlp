I am making this recipe for the eighth time and it never gets old. These flavors blended together are so unique and not like what we are used to in traditional meat and potato homes. I crave this dish and make it often. I have made a few changes but not to any of the ingredients. It is perfect as it is. The only thing I change is using different vegetables based on what's in season, and changing from cornish hens to leg quarters, etc. Cooking times need to be adjusted based on the vegetables so watch that. I've also done this in a slow cooker, otherwise I have stuck to the original. This truly is my favorite dish.

This is a terrific recipe. The first time I made it with just one cornish hen (only cooking for 2) so the spice amounts weren't spot on. I served it with couscous that time. I just made it again tonight for a larger group and did it with a regular chicken and wild rice with figs and pumpkin seeds (was going to use pine nuts but the store was all out) instead of couscous. It was wonderful both ways! Both times I used an assortment of vegetables (carrots, parsnips, yam, rutabaga, red bell pepper, zucchini) and fresh tomatoes. I'm finding the veggies get very soft by the time the chicken is done, so I'm thinking of adding them after the meat has started cooking a bit. I am cutting them quite small so I might try cutting them a bit bigger. I'm also playing around with when I add which veggies (harder veggies first, adding the softer, faster cooking ones later) so they all come out a bit firmer. Don't skip the fresh parsley, cilantro and mint - it really enhances the dish! I added some quartered dried figs to the roaster both times and they bring a really nice balance to the spices of the dish. I highly recommend this recipe, but play around a bit to make it your own.

Love the spice combination! I only had 2 cornish hens, and the flavor was a bit too salty; I think 3 cornish hens would be enough for the spices and the sauce. I also skipped the vegetables and served them with steamed rice and roasted red potatoes. Still delicious!

Rating: 3
The spices with the vegetables are delicious in this recipe. I did find that the cornish hens could have used a bit more seasoning or perhaps marinating. I suspect that buying some farm-raised hens may increase flavor - the ones that we had didn't have a lot of flavor on their own. If i were to do it again without farm-raised hens I would season the hens before roasting.

Ths was a lovely dish. I couldn't find cornish hens and so subbed a regular whole chicken, cut in half, and cooked for 130 mins total, 45 of them covered. I also added in a chopped leek because I had one extra kicking around. The zucchini and onion were added at the end in the last 20 mins, as suggested by others. The reviewer who suggested keeping flatbread on hand was onto a good thing; we sopped up the yummy juices with pita. A gorgeous dish!

Delicious dish! Made adjustments recommended by others. Husband loved it. Roasted 1 Cornish hen in a covered tajine (afterall, it is a Moroccan dish!) for 40 min., uncovered for 20 min. (breast was 160 degrees, thigh juices were clear). Left out chicken broth and tomatoes. Added firmer veggies from the start (butternut squash, parsnips) and softer veggies once uncovered (red bell pepper, onions). Chopped herbs add nice color and fresh flavor. A tasty and very pretty dish that I will definitely make again!

The flavor of this dish is incredible. I used a lamb roast instead of game hens and the meal still tasted great.

Rating: 2
This was a good choice of mixture of vegetables, but I found the chicken stock, coupled with natural bird juices, caused my vegetables to be drowned - rather than roasted they were more boiled. It was also pretty light on the seasoning -- caraway and salt doesn't create tremendous flavour.

We love this dish. There are always enought veggies left over for a second night.

A delicious meal! I substituted 4 chicken breasts for the cornish hens. I did not use caraway seeds, but instead added ground cardamom (a couple of teaspoons) to the spice mixture. The spice mixture is what makes this dish - don't skimp on them. The vegetables do get very stew-y, but ladled on top of the couscous, they're nirvana. Have some warm flatbread on hand to soak up the juices. Yum yum.

Excellent! I made several substitutions based on personal preferences and it was still awesome. Cooking time can vary depending on the poultry used and the size of the veggies. Definitely add the zucchini towards the end as suggested by others.

Rating: 1
I made this exactly as written, but I should have trusted my judgment and slashed the suggested cooking time considerably. As it was, white meat on the hens turned out dry and badly overdone, although the dark was edible. The vegetable combination was attractive, but I wasn't pleased by the flavors. The combination of the seasonings and vegetables came out a bit too sweet for my taste. It is unusual for cornish hens or fresh vegetables to be left over in my house, but that was the case. I put the remains in a plastic container in the refridgerator, but who am I kidding? It will be a science experiment in a week or two.

This was SO good. No hens available, so I put in six big breasts w/skin & bone and diced a couple extra turnips. Used acorn squash for the butternut. I divided ingredients into two 9 x 12 pans. Oven times were the same and it came out excellent.

I've made this dish a dozen times since finding it here over a year ago and we love it every time! I've substituted all kinds of vegetables and different kinds of poultry, including pheasant (which was delicious) and it is always good and satisfying. I agree with others - add summer squash toward the end - and keep the red pepper in large pieces to prevent it from disintegrating. Fabulous recipe!

I hate to bash inherently soud recipes, but the cooking time on this one is off the wall. Cook for 40 minutes covered and then 20 min uncovered for 175 internal. As for the veggies, add zucchini after removal of the cover and cook for 20 min. Excellent flavor. Dunno how caraway made its way in considering it is a european spice and not a middle eastern. I think they use something called brown caraway. I subbed star anise.

I made this last night for company and it was delicious, elegant, and easy. I changed the spices a little by adding curry powder and cardamom and omitting the caraway. I also heated the dry spices in a skillet to bring out the flavor before making the spice paste. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use the liquid I poured off the hens and veggies to make the couscous. Yummy!

This was so aromatic when cooking, I had neighbors in my boyfriend's apartment knocking on the door to ask what it was. The taste was wonderful. I read other comments and did wait until 20 minutes prior to completion to add the zuchini. I didn't want that mushy. This is wonderful!

I made a double recipe for a family party with cut up chicken, reduced cooking time as well. Since my family is not big on vegetables, I had a lot left over. I put them in a stock pot, added about 4 cups of chicken broth, and cooked til the vegetables were very soft. Then pureed the mixture. It resulted in a fabulous, rich tasting roasted vegetable soup.

I love this recipe. Last night I made it just for my husband and me, so I cut it in half and since the game hens were small, we ended up eating it all up. I always serve it with couscous and definitely reduce the cooking time -- 40-45 minutes max covered, then 10-15 uncovered. Next time I'm going to start the hens breast down and then turn them over when I take the foil off. They were a tad on the dry side last night. This is an excellent recipe for company if they dont mind picking the meat off of game hens, which can be messy. Good for close friends or family. The veggies do get a little mushy but that makes all the flavors easy to blend together with your couscous in each bite. Enjoy!

I was faithful to all the ingredients but chose to slowly pre-cook the split hens over an outdoor gas grill (15-20 minutes on medium heat) and cook the vegetables stove top in a cast iron casserole pan. For the last 20 minutes I add the hens to the casserole. This method helps control the cooking time of the vegetables and avoids skimming the fat.

Rating: 3
GREAT but would precook the vegi's - they were hard when the cooking time was over (may have been calibration if my oven?) - the spice paste can be used as a marinade without the entire recipie being used. Loved the flavor. Served with couscous with onions, toasted pine nuts and cilantro.

I would not recommend this recipe. I made this for a costume New Years Eve party for 10 people where I am the cook. Only one person went back for seconds and I have a few big eaters! The vegetables came out extrememly mushy and I cut them larger than the recipe called after reading the other reviews. I was disappointed in this recipe and somewhat embarrassed....

Rating: 3
Great meal. Very flavorful and not too difficult. I omitted the turnips and tomatoes, substitued yams for butternut squash and increased the broth to about 1 cup to accomodate for the missing tomatoes. Served with rice, although I believe the couscous would be a better compliment. I highly recommend this dish.

i slightly changed this recipe. i cooked it in a romertompf clay oven with a whole chicken instead of the hens. (small chix cooked about 1 1/2 hrs.) it came out really juicy and tender. as mentioned before - cut the veggies bigger. the smell of the dish throughout the house is incredible. i served it with coucous cooked with currants. forgot to add the herb mixture and it did not seem to matter. enjoy!!

I made a variation of this, mainly by accident and missing ingredients, but the results were so good, I wanted to add it here as an option: Baked veggies without hens. (baked fish separately). Substituted small dutch potatoes for zucchini. Omitted caraway seeds and ginger. Didn't have ground cumin so we added curry powder. Didn't bother with the final herbs since we made an herb sauce for fish. This was SO good. We'll make it again and again. A couple mornings later, we poured off the sauce and tomatoes, mashed rest of veggies and reheated like a potato pancake, topping with fried eggs for breakfast. Pureed sauce and used as a gravy. YUMMY!

I tripled the recipe, using 24 legs and bone-in breasts, to serve 28 people. I served it with COUSCOUS WITH DRIED APRICOTS, CURRANTS, AND PISTACHIOS (on this site). It was a wonderful party dish - easy, considering the quantity, and very festive and delicious. With 2 large pans in the oven, it needed the full cooking time.

Instead of cornish hens, I subtituted boneless chicken breast, poached and shredded into medium pieces. I added the chicken to the vegetables mix. I also substituted carrots for the butternut squash. It was wonderful. Brought back memories of the "real Stuff"... north african food is the best!

Well, I didn't want to spoil the non-stop rave reviews that this recipe has gotten, but I didn't care for the flavor at all----what ruined it for me were the turnips, which added a distinctive taste which I felt clashed with the rest of the seasonings and vegetables. I love the cooking method and the hens were delicious and very tender....I will use this recipe again but will substitute carrots for the turnips and will probably add either a bit more honey, or perhaps some apricot preserves instead. This recipe IS extremely versatile as others have pointed out---you could use just about any combination of root vegetables with any combination of seasonings, and you can use other cuts of chicken.

Delicious! The hens were extremely tender and beautifully browned and the vegetables tossed in the slightly sweet sauce were really wonderful. Also very easy to prepare. I only cooked 1 split hen and reduced the cooking time by about 40 minutes.

This was wonderful!! Made it for a special occasion dinner and had rave reviews. The juice just flowed from the hens and were delicious. Have had several people ask for the recipe. I plan on making it for the next large "company" dinner. It was easy and fast to put together. I would probably prepare the vegetables the day before, to save on time before the dinner. Absolutely two thumbs up!!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Easy, interesting, really really delicious, spicy, and healthy. Also kept well. Also flexible (I used chicken breasts rather than game hens and added a little more spice). I'll use more butternut squash next time because it held up so nicely. There are about seven or eight things I look for in a dish and this one has them all. The house smelled wonderful as it was cooking.

The marinade/sauce is wonderful, although it was just a bit too cinammony for my personal taste, but great nonetheless. I used whole chicken legs, and applied the cooking instructions and time. The chicken came out very moist because of basting them every 10-15 minutes. I used different veggies to suit my own taste, and added golden raisins. The whole meal was great with saffron rice, flat bread, hummus, and raspberry ginger brew. Enjoy!

This is great! When the kids, and guests, keeping on going back to the serving dish for more, you know you have a winner! Preparation time is not bad at all. Used basmatti rice instead of couscous. Added a baby romaine/fresh tomato salad with red wine vinagrette. Things I did different: used chicken breasts with rib-bones instead of corning hens, did not use the caraway seeds (do not like the smell of them), did cut the veggies in big chunks, substituted the turnips with carrots, did cut back on the baking covered-time from 1 hr to 40 minutes, then uncovered until chicken was brown and by then the veggies were done to perfection, did not add the cilantro/mint/parsley topping (forgot to buy them. It is the perfect dinner party recipe: prepare and put in the over before guests arrive, and it will be cooking while your are enjoying your friends. Plus it is a wonderful, delicious, colorful meal. Next time I will try adding Portabella mushrooms. Enjoy!

We loved this one. I have to say, it's one of the best recipies from this site that I've made recently. The biggest surprise was the turnips; they were great (even the famous "picky husband" really liked them, and requested more next time). We didn't think, however, the parsley, cilantro, mint mixture was necessary. We love the fresh taste of these herbs, but, for a recipe cut down for just two people, they didn't add all that much. (Maybe I'm cheap, but I hate spending so much on a hugh bunch of herbs, and then using only a tiny bit!)

This is a great recipe. I used a whole chicken cut into pieces instead of the hens and substituted the juice from the canned tomatoes for the stock (since I was out). For the vegetables I used potatoes, carrots, yellow and green zucchini and onions. It turned out beautifully-- everyone loved it. Delicious!

This dish is so yummy. The spices are perfect and other than a bit of chopping, it is very easy. I used half a chicken because I really don't fancy game hens -- it came out just perfect. Cut down on the cooking time - 45 min. covered and 20 min. uncovered -- cut your veggies into large pieces, that way they won't get mushy.

Rating: 3
What a beautiful dish! I cooked these in a roasting pan, pulled it out of the oven, set it on the table and everyone was stunned! I have to agree with most of the other reviews on the veggies however. My were a little on the mushy side as well (except for the turnips which was perfect). Also the game hens were really delicious. Next time I will play with cooking times on the other vegetables (and there will definately be a next time!).

I made this in Montreal for New Year's Eve party and it was a huge hit. The hens were very small, so I did one/person and cooked them whole. Super moist, flavorful, and pretty. Somewhat labor-intensive to prepare, but the recipe worked perfectly, even for 10. Definitely deserves an encore ... I will save and share this recipe.

The first time I make a dish, I follow the recipe. Against my better judgement I roasted the game hens as directed and they were too dry and overdone for my taste and my husband's as well. The next time I make this, I will reduce hen cooking time or temp accordingly. The veggies though were excellent! I did add two large carrots to the roasting pan and my husband and I ate most of the veggies between us. A side dish of couscous is a must - the flavors blend very well.
