This has to be one of my absolute favorites. Lemon and cream are always wonderful and this gives a great basis for all sorts of possibilities...with chicken, asparagus, etc.

I doubled this recipe for four people as a side dish to grilled salmon. It is excellent! I will make it again, but it took forever to reduce down. I used fresh snap pea-pods sliced on a bias and added chopped portobello mushrooms. I cooked the sauce earlier in the day, then refridgerated, and just added the peas and cheese when reheating and cooking the pasta - made it a quick dish for company while we grilled the fish. Yum.

This was so wonderful! I lightened it up by using low-fat milk in place of cream and added 2 Tblsp (not tsp) of lemon as well as the zest. Increase the wine to 1/2 cup and the parmesean to 1/4 cup. It was great served with the Mint Granita recipe I found here as well!

I was disappointed by this recipe and probably wouldn't make it again. It was just okay. I made the lemon asparagus pasta on this site and that was much better for some reason, even though a lot of the ingredients were the same. Perhaps I just favor asparagus over peas...

This was a great recipe. It was really quick and easy to prepare AND it tasted great! Both my husband and I loved it.

Easy, simple, and tasty. Perfect for a weeknight. Don't skimp on the wine. Some white pepper was needed to finish off the dish. My boyfriend loved it.
