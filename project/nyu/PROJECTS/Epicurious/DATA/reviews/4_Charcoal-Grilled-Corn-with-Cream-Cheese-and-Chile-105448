I made this recipe as part of a 'mexican street food' themed dinner party. I live in Chicago and because grilling the corn would have required me to step outside in frigid temps, I chose to roast the corn in the oven instead. I roasted it (husks on, no need to pre-soak) at 350 degrees for 1/2 an hour. I pulled back the husks, and the corn was absolutely sweet and delicious. It tasted even better with the cream and queso fresco. While eating, I commented to my dinner guests that I will not be eating corn in the future unless it is spread with cream and cheese. It's THAT good!

I am addicted to this corn and eat it all of the time in Mexico. However, in the States it is difficult for me to find "corn in a cup" and I begin to crave it. It is a little different not using the mexican field corn and in fact, I really do prefer the flavor of the sweet corn, but when in Mexico there is no sweet corn available. Use crema mexicana for the cream and you are set. YUMMY!!!

Everyone who has had this at our house has loved it so far. It's execellent because the sharp chili flavor makes such a wonderful contrast to the sweet corn. Instead of using all cream, I use farmer's cheese mixed with a bit of cream until it is spreadble. You can also add in another type of cheese (such as parmesean) and the chili, which makes it easier for everyone to eat!

We discovered this recipe in 2001 and have loved it ever since. We skip the roasting in the husk as our corn tends to be quite sweet and tender. I do mix the cream, cheese and chile together and add the juice of 1/2 a lime or so, just for ease of guests serving themselves.

Quick Question on making the sauce since I didn't seem to get it Do I mix the butter into the cream, cheese and chili or is that seperate. Also - when basting the corn do I just use only butter or the cheese sauce. Thanks!

Grilling the corn with the silk improves the flavor and the second grill and splash of lime makes this truly mexican.

I make this all summer long. Splashing each corn cob with fresh lime juice before eating intensifies the flavors and really makes the dish.

This is the BEST Cor on the Cob I've ever tasted. I served it a a Mexican These Dinner Party and Everyone was licking their fingers rather than wiping away the sauce. This is a real winner and I'll serve it again often.

This is my families favorite way to have ears of corn. I was so delighted to see the thick cream sauce. It was easy to prepare and the rewards are mouth watering. I used it in making chicken enchiladas. Doubling the recipe, my family couldn't get enough. I will make this over and over. Well worth the little effort. Thanks!
