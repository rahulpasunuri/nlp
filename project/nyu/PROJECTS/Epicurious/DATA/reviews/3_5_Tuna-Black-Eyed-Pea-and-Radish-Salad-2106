A perfect light summer meal. Interesting blend of flavors and textures. I followed instructions exactly--however, next time I will kick up the dressing, maybe adding more cayenne or capers as some reviewers suggested. I will also substitute cherubs for romas--the romas I used were horribly bland and so tasteless. This is definitely a keeper.

Perfect as is. Leaving out ingredients and then giving it 2 forks? All the flavours balance perfectly, my teenagers love this dish, as is. I have been making this since it first came out. A family favourite for a hot summer day, healthy and delicious.

It is so tasty. Only three of us were eating and we were fighting over the last spoonful. Perfect for a summer dinner.

Good, different recipe- probably deserves 2 1/2 forks. I was looking for something to do with these enormous radishes I had purchased and this recipe fit the bill for a hot summer evening. I substituted chick peas and fresh oregano for the black-eyed peas and cilantro and cut down on the dressing- 2 TBSP lime juice & 3 TBSP olive oil. I also skipped the hard boiled eggs and tomatoes.

Fabulous for its simplicity and flavour. I have varied the ingredients from time to time - have used chick peas, combo of red wine vinegar and lemon juice with minced garlic for the dressing, doubled the tuna, etc. Each variation and the original are fabulous. Agree the capers are a must regardless!! Perfect summer dish!

When I first made this, I wasn't sure how it would turn out - but I was very pleasantly surprised! Really refreshing and satisfying on a hot summer day. I made it a few times over last summer, and plan to make it again in summers to come.

So yummy!! I would never have put these ingredients together, but the flavors really compliment each other well. I even made it the cheapest way possible, and used bottled lemon juice (all I had) and no onion, tomato, or eggs. I also added capers per another reviewers suggestion. It took no time at all and I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day for lunch.

A great change for a light meal. We used leftover redfish that we grilled the day before and doubled the amount of fish the recipe requires. We also mixed green and black olives and used cherry tomatoes for a pretty presentation. Watch the salt.

Yum! Previous reviewer is right - watch out for the salt because the tuna and olives already pack a sodium punch! Otherwise, it is delicious and the radishes (which i normally don't like) really make it great!!!

What a wonderful fresh taste! The leftovers were fabulous even without the eggs and tomatoes - simply with lettuce and good bread. Definite repeat recipe. Careful with the dressing... I only needed half - all of it probably would've been lime overload.

This recipe is so good, I often double the ingredients as the dish keep very well in the fridge for leftovers. I add one additional ingredient with this recipe - capers! A teaspoon and a half for the standard or a full tablespoon if the recipe is doubled.

So nice! The recipe mentions seasoning the dressing with salt (among other things). Just be cautious as the olives and tuna will bring their own saltiness to the table. Had I added any more, I would have been in trouble. Try this, you won't be sorry.

Absolutely delicious. I would not hesitate to serve it to guests. I even cheated and used bottled lime juice (shame, shame!) and it was still fantastic.

So pleased to find this on-line... I made it in 1993 from the magazine quite a few times and just had to find it again! Great twist on tuna salad- has to be better for you than the standard mayo version. I love the lime dressing, but usually skip the hard-boiled eggs if packing ahead for lunch at work. Don't skip the radishes even it you're not a huge fan- they are great. Great presentation too.

I was very pleased to find this recipe here. I've been making it every summer since it came out. It's a great salad to go with barbeques and it's great the next day as a leftover lunch.
