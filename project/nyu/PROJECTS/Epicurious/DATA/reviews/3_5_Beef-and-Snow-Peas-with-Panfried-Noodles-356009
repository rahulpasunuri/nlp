This has become one of my husband's favorites. The reason why I did not rate it 4 forks is because of the changes I've made. First, use beef broth instead of water. Use sesame oil rather than plain vegetable oil. I omit the scallions but add garlic with the ginger. I also add sliced water chestnuts at the end for a nice crunch. Doubling the sauce is a necessity as noted by many others. I do the noodle cake in a separate fry pan; I find it always takes longer than the time stated in the recipe to get it nice and golden brown. The noodle cake is what makes it special. This recipe would never serve 4 in my household but perhaps that's because my husband "pigs out" when I serve it.

I took the advice of other reviewers and both doubled the sauce and marinated the meat in soy, water, sugar, and red pepper. Without either of those suggestions, it would have been just so-so, but with them it was delicious. I need to work on my noodle-frying skills, but I'll make this one again.

This is easy & delicious, but I did cut back the cornstarch by half a teaspoon or so the second time I made it. I think it turned out a bit more flavorful that way.

Seems like it's missing something, but was still quite tasty. We'll definitely make it again.

This was amazing. It meets my primary criteria of being easy and delicious. Yeah - I'll double the sauce next time. I think I'll try it with large shrimp sometime soon. The noodles added the extra dimension of crispiness that really makes a nice contrast to the meat and peas.

We doubled sauce and used tenderloin thinly sliced. Didn't mess with the noodles based on earlier reviews and instead served on brown rice. This beats any (of our midwest town)local Chinese restaurant version of snow pea beef hands down. Have made it multiple times and it's a staple for quick, healthy and delicious dinner!

Before I made this I read through all the reviews and followed he advice given. I have to say, great advice! I marinated my beef strips for 45 minutes on the counter in a ziplock freezer bag in 4 T soy sauce, 4T water, 1T sugar, and three cloves of minced garlic. I doubled the sauce (a must! you must double the sauce) and added a clove of minced garlic. My noodles cooked up into a crispy cake because I waited until the oil was quite hot before I put the noodles on and I cooked them over a high heat. Very flavorful, it's what I *wish* would appear at my door when I order chinese take out. I will make this again and again This would be amazing with a mixture of vegetable oil and sesame oil

My husband raved about this - delicious! Agree with the other reviewers, double the sauce.

Wow, wow, wow!! This is the one you will keep on making! We all love it and it is so easy. I marinate the sliced flank in a bit of soy and garlic and leave it refrigerated for a few hours before I cook it.

excellent recipe; followed other reviews and marinated the beef & doubled the sauce. everyone wants to have this again.

This was great! I doubled the sauce. Also, I cut the meat in very thin slices across the grain and marinated it all day in 4T Soy, 4T water, 1 T sugar, 2 crushed garlic cloves and 1 t. crushed red pepper. This solved the bland issue that many reviewers mentioned. My flank steak was 1 1/2 pounds so I bought 2 pkgs. of Chinese noodles. Boiling them first then frying them into a cake in olive oil was amazing!

The noodles I made were not crispy and did not form any sort of cohesive noodle cake. Some of the outsides crisped, and they were still alright. I think I would just make brown rice next time. I used leftover chicken and steamed some sugar peas, so I am only rating the noodles.

Rating: 3
Well liked by my family. They especially liked the sauce, which I doubled and that was a good thing to do. I thought the beef could have used more seasoning, and so next time will marinate it per a prior reviewer's suggestion. I wished my noodles were crispier and more golden colored, so will have to tweak that a bit. Perhaps a bit more oil will help.

I have made this dish many times now and here is the key to a fantastic turnout. Double the sauce recipe - no question. Flank steak is the best but you need a two pound piece. Snow peas are essential and yes, brocolli is a wonderful addition. After slicing the partially frozen flank very thin, add a tablespoon of soy sauce and a few pieces of garlic and let is sit refrigerated while you prepare the rest. Cook the noodles on high heat to really get a good brown tinge. Nothing else to change here. It is tremendous and a recipe you'll enjoy over and over.

I made this doubling the sauce, but not the corn starch. I still think there was too much cornstarch, will probably decrease to 1 tsp next time. A little goes a long way. I also added some extra veggies (onion and red bell pepper). It was a big hit at my house. The sauce could use some heat IMO, but you can always add that to taste at the table. I had some difficulty with the noodle cake staying together. I liked the noodles, but this would be good over rice too.

bland and uninteresting.

This dish was very good. Delicious! The only changes I made was to double the sauce & add broccoli. The flavor was awesome, the combination of the textures was a delight. I loved the noodles crispy on the outside and firm and Hot on the inside despite being set aside after frying. The sauce was perfectly balanced and so easy to make. I will be making this again for sure.

Based on earlier review chose not to make the noodles, but served over brown rice. We used tenderloin, and added bean sprouts to dish. The sauce is excellent and recipe easily adaptable to other veggies. Really liked the ginger and scallions base to the sauce. YUM!

Excellent. Made some alterations based on other comments. First, used filet instead of the flank steak, double the snow peas and tripled the sauce. not sure why others had issues with the noodles. I pan fried noodles for the refridgerated section of our Asian grocery and through they made the dish. My husband and I try to never have seconds, but tonight we did.

Followed the recipe but doubled the sauce as some recommended and am very glad I did. This was very good. Especially liked the pan fried noodles, even if it was a little tricky to turn them. Will definitely make again!

Wow. Bland. Don't serve this to someone who like authentic Asian food. Good for little kids, I guess.

noodles were good - I used fresh lo mein noodles. The sauce was a little boring, though.

Very good. Just used green beans (the skinny ones from Costco) rather than the snow peas and don't think next time I'd go to the trouble of pan frying the noodles. I had just never done that before and wanted to try. The sauce is great. I've made stir fry before but think I'll use this recipe going forward. Boys all liked it.

I loved the flavor (added a little chile garlic sauce), but the noodles did not work for me. If anyone happens to cook this and it works for them, please let me know the trick!

My family loved this recipe. I substituted sugar snap peas in place of the snow peas...will definitely make again!

Sauce was quick and easy but delicious. The beef came out exceptionally well--I just cut it very thin as instructed with a very sharp knife. I doubled the snow peas and sauce, and thought this was a good proportion. I used dried ramen noodles for the noodles--not sure if they were what was intended, but I thought it came out well. Only used a 3 oz package of noodles for 2 people though, which is a bit less than called for. It was plenty.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I substituted 8oz of frozen broccoli for the snow peas since that is what I had on hand. I also think a combination of the two would be great. We used 10oz of noodles, and maybe because of that, I would double the sauce. Then again, I also used 1.25lb of flank steak, so that probably contributed. Given that Beef and Broccoli is one of my husband's favorite Chinese (American) dishes, I was pleased when he said it was better than any he had tasted before.

I found this to be fairly bland - not bad but far from exciting. no big surprise given the few ingredients i guess. This would make a good start for a recipe if you're willing to try out your own enhancements. I used broccoli instead of snow peas and that was the best part of the meal by far, the only part my kids ate and that says something.

This was perfect! All my kids loved it! Very easy to make and I wouldn't change a thing. I wasn't sure which Chinese noodles to get, so I wound up making rice. Which was tasty with the extra sauce. This will be in my weekly rotation. I wonder if shrimp would be good too? Or chicken? I'll bet yes.

Really good...however, next time I would use Oyster sauce with no MSG, and a lighter sodium soy sauce. It was way too salty, however the flavor will be wonderful when prepared correctly. I used pork instead of flank steak, and cooked it before the snow peas. I also minced to garlic gloves, and put some fresh serrano pepper in it. The pan fried noodles were great!!!
