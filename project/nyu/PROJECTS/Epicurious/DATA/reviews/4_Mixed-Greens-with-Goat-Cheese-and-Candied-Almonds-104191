I have been making this salad for years...it is a lot of work, but totally worth it. When you candy the nuts, do not use water!! I throw an entire bag of sliced almonds and a cup of sugar in a large sauté pan...stir constantly until sugar melts, caramelizes and coats the nuts. Be careful though they can burn quickly. Soooo much easier (and better results) than with the water. We get many salads out of this recipe.

I served this at a 4th of July party. It was a big hit. I used unsweetened toasted almonds and didn't miss the extra sugar (or calories!)

Rating: 3
Also used quick method of toasting/ carmelizing almonds. It was simple enough, but sugar still seemed crystally at the end. Not sure if that's the right result. This makes WAY more nuts than you need for the salad. Dressing is good but also way too much quantity. Overall the salad is quite sweet which explains why people who don't like salad, like this. I'll make it again, cutting back on nuts and dressing, when I am looking for something to compliment a rich/ winter menu.

Made this for Easter brunch today - not even a leaf of lettuce was leftover - which is amazing because this was a non-salad crowd! :) It really was a tasty combination of flavors. I made the almonds the quick, easy way as the reviewer suggested below - just browned them with nothing in the pan - then added 1/2 cup sugar and a pinch of cayenne and stirred for another 5 min. Very easy and didn't stick together. One word of warning - many of reviews talked about how long it took to reduce the cider...it only took me about 20 minutes...and I probably reduced it too much, so watch yours carefully! I think I must have used a larger pot than most.

This salad is great! I bought the store candied nuts which saved time. Beware- the time to reduce the apple cider is much longer than 23 minutes. (Make the dressing ahead of time). I added some red pear slices for color and it was delicious. I would make this again and again.

The salad and dressign were delicious!! This really yields a huge amount of dressing, a lot more then is needed for this portion of salad. So it keeps very well in the fridge for many more salads, so just shake it up and voila!! The candied almonds were a little to sweet for me and the guests, so I must less sugar for the almonds and that was just fine..you will love this salad.

I've made this salad at least 7 times and every time it gets RAVE reviews. It's so nice for Christmas if one uses dried cranberries, and the combo of flavors and textures is wonderful. The only change I make is the almonds. Following the recipe yields almond brittle. Delicious, but a mess, and impossible to separate the almonds. So, I have come up with a 6 minute SIMPLE substitute. Pan glaze the almonds. Take a small dry frying pan and brown the almonds over medium heat (begin to stir constantly once they start to toast). As they start to brown, add about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of sugar, and keep stirring. The sugar will quickly melt and coat the almonds. Simple, easy and delicious.

Rating: 3
Delicious, sure, but making those candied almonds was a comedic disaster -- despite my speed at trying to separate them, they hardened into a granite-like sheet instantaneously. My husband had to chisel the nut block into shards and nuggets with a pointy lemon juicer. Our kitchen was filled with almond dust! Fortunately, our guests were none the wiser and loved the finished product. Next time I'll just buy candied almonds and chop 'em up, as others here have done.

I'm not usually much for sweet salads. Loved this one though, and so did everyone else.

Rating: 4
Just as good as everyone said. Instead of making the candied almonds, I used Glazed Almonds from Trader Joe's. They're whole almonds, so I chopped them a bit. . The goat cheese was a bit of a problem. Goat cheese is so soft it won't really "crumble" as the recipe directs. I ended up putting most of mine thru a ricer. But even though I added the cheese at the very last minute, it still turned kind of gluey and smeary instead of remaining as discrete crumbles. Next time I might try feta.

I've made this salad a million times, always to rave reviews! Occasionally I've had problems with the cider reduction turning into a jelly (not sure why it only happens sometimes). I've started using frozen apple juice concentrate instead- - so much easier and tastes the same! I also only use 1/2 cup olive oil on the dressing.

This was worth all the effort! Excellent salad. I didn't watch the clock and got it to reduce to 2/3 cup after two hours. I used the 1/2 cup from that. I also took the advice from previous reviewers and used only 1/2 cup oil. I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/8 water plus a small amount of cayenne for the almonds I put them on parchment paper and had no trouble separating them. I still had dressing left over and used 6oz of the cheese. This is a great salad for entertaining. Everyone oohed and aahed. Parchment paper went well

I used the dressing on top of a mixed greens salad with goat cheese and honeycrisp apples. I took out the onion (I don't like raw onions in salad) and the poppyseeds (didn't have any on hand) and only used 1/4 cup of oil, and it was still delicious. Perfectly light and complementary to the strong tastes of apple and goat cheese

I've not made this yet so I'm not rating but I have a suggestion for making the candied almonds. Parchment paper is the way to ease your pain--try it instead of foil. I've had "issues" with carmelizing nuts before (just imagine a guest biting into a nut with a piece of foil attached and you get the picture--yeah, I thought I got all the pieces removed). Using foil to cool is part of the problem, in my humble opinion, because the caramel sticks to the foil. Wax paper is also an option (distant second but better than foil...again--in my opinion).

I followed all of the comments and tweeked it on my own by adding a crumbled goat cheese, dried craisins and granny smith apples for a festive fall salad. I brought it to a buffet dinner with way too much food and yet it was the only thing devoured. It did take over an hour for the cider to reduce.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe too many times to count. My favourite salad recipe. I use a rolled goat cheese with herbes fines. I slice it and toast it in the toaster oven and put a few warm slices on the salad, and serve it with sauteed scallops. I drool just writing about it. Oh, I don't use the nuts when serving with scallops - too rich. Also cut way down on the onion as it tends to stay with you.

I love this salad! It is absolutely delicious. I have made it twice. It did take longer than 23 minutes to reduce the cider. Also, I tried my best to separate the almonds but they still stuck together a bit. I just broke them apart when the candied almond mixture hardened. yummmm!

Read the reviews first so I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. I cut the amount of olive oil used in half and added dried cranberries. I also browned the almonds in a skillet with 1/4 cup of sugar stirring constantly, went alot faster. Also I made this receipe in the mountains of Colorado, because of the higher alitutde it took over an hour to reduce the apple cider.

This was a really good salad, but still needs something. I am making it tonight and will try some sweet red peppers to give it some more color and dimension. It was really easy to brown the almonds in a pan on the stove and then add the sugar with a little cayenne. Much less involved than the original recipe.

Absolutely fabulous!!! Made this for our gourmet group and everyone loved it! (sounds snooty, but we are really just novices who love to eat) We all agreed that the candied almonds sounded like an odd thing to put in a salad but couldn't have loved it more. I don't put onions in mine tho they were fine in the original. Also, agree that the almonds make a great snack on thier own. I gave the dressing and almonds along with my home-grown salad greens as Christmas gifts and got rave reviews! Definitely will add this to our permanent collection!

Excellent! It was definitely the hit others described. The 1/2 C sugar/1/8 C water on stovetop worked well with almonds. Loved the cranapple cider in the reduction (which DID take one hour...which goes very QUICKLY at the end, so be careful!). 1/2 C oil and 6 oz goat cheese is plenty! Rave reviews by others, too.

The reviews made this so much easier. For one, I just followed the suggestion of browning the almonds in a pan with sugar. The other great tip was that the cider took a long time to reduce. I let that cook for at least an hour but without that tip I would have become insecure that I was doing something wrong. Made this for Thanksgivig and it was a big hit with the kids, adults and picky eaters!

This is a wonderful salad!!! Everyone I've made it for loves it! The only things I'm doing differently are adding dried cranberries (good for color, flavor and texture) and I didn't add the onion to the dressing. I also prefer to just put the almonds in a small non-stick fry pan and sprinkle with about three of four Tbsp of sugar and melt the sugar onto the almond over medium high heat. It is a lot less messy then the way it is written. This salad is perfect for the fall/holiday seasons!

It is an incredible salad, everyone loved it at the party and wanted the receipe. I eft out the poppy seeds as I don't think added much more to the dressing. I added a little more onions, mustard and cider vinegar as I felt the drssing was too sweet in its original receipt form.

This salad was fabulous and simple to make. I did have to cook the Apple juice a long time to reduce the 2 cups to 1/2. It never did happen but it did reduce to about 1 1/4 cups.

This is one of my favorite recipes found on this web site. I don't often put four forks on a recipe, but this one deserves it! I've made this many times, exactly as the recipe states, and I've found everything to be perfect. As for the almonds, as SOON as I put them on the foil, I separate them to make sure they don't clump. I also think the dressing is perfect (even with the full cup of olive oil), but I may try to cut down on that the next time I make it, just because others say it tastes fine with half the amount. The goat cheese goes perfectly with the salad and I don't think I'd use a different cheese. This recipe is a treasure. Be sure to make this!!!

FANTASTIC! Made this during Xmas dinner for my very picky family. Even my father loved it! suggestion- try herbed goat chse and add dried cranberries- gives great color and complements the tastes. Also, i chose to use romaine instead of mixed greens- worked just fine. will make this over and over.

This has become a staple on our Xmas table. I find the reduction time for the apple cider takes a lot longer than the recipe states -- usually more than 30 minutes. I used whole almonds this year instead of slivers and it was much easier to separate the nuts. Next time I'll try doing only half the sugar mixture as another reviewer suggested.

Rating: 3
This recipe became a favorite, I get lots of requests to make this. I use shallots instead of onions and also use just 1/4 cup of oil. For pecans I candy them with half the sugar mixture, it makes it easier to mix and separate before they cool off. Otherwise I get a pecan brittle result.

Great, great, great. We made this salad for all of our holiday entertaining last year and here we are looking for it again this year! A great substitution for the candied almonds is to buy Alder Market candied walnuts (check out www.aldermarketproducts.com). They're dangerously delicious!

Rating: 4
Definitely make the almonds in a non-stick pan sprayed gently with cooking spray. Toast almonds then use about 2/3 cup sugar and pinch of cayenne. Pour nuts on a foiled tray and use a fork immediately to separate. I was too lazy to make the dressing, used bottled balsamic vinagrette. Added firm bosc pear sliced thinly and a thinly sliced granny smith to dress this up.

Rating: 4
This salad was incredible! The candied almonds were tricky but worth it. I had trouble carmelizing the sugar and toasting the almonds without burning one or the other so I toasted the almonds first and folded them into the carmelized sugar when it was done. It pays to make the effort to separate them (and quickly!) after pouring them onto the foil. Mine ended up looking like peanut brittle and I spent an hour or so breaking it all apart. Next time I'll try less sugar and pouring it onto a flat strainer. Allow plenty of time to reduce the apple cider, it took me almost an hour. Ahead of time sounds like a good idea.

Rating: 4
My favorite salad to date! The nuts alone are well worth the time. I make the nuts by toasting the on the stove then adding sugar until it carmelizes (as recommended by a previous reviewer), the spreading on foil and cooling. Make sure you put the nuts in an airtight container right away, or else they will absorb the moisture from the air. Also, for the dressing, a little less than half the oil is sufficient.

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was a great success. In fact, while I made more than enough for all, we actually ran out. The dressing clearly makes the salad.

Great recipe! I took it to a small potluck of 8 and it was the perfect amount. Everyone raved about it! I used half the olive oil, maybe a little less then that. I also candied the almonds with just the almonds and a little sugar in a large non-stick frying pan like a previous review stated. I also took this recipe and made something that was fairly close to the Chicken Gorgonzola Salad served at the Downrigger restaurant in Friday Harbor, Washington. Just add some bbq sauce to the dressing, exchange the goat cheese for gorgonzola, exchange the almonds for pecans and add penne pasta and chicken breast. Also, very good! pieces.

AWESOME DRESSING!!!! WOW!!!! Far and away the best salad dressing I have ever made. I used only half the olive oil and would definitely recommend that to others. Reducing the cider takes a long time (and be careful it doesn't boil-over early on! I wasn't watching it carefully and had a nice sticky mess to clean up!!!) but it is definitely WORTH IT! I used the dressing on a salad of mixed baby greens, red bell pepper (homegrown!), cherry tomatoes and a sundried tomato/basil flavored feta cheese I found at my supermarket. Because the dressing is so sweet, I chose to use toasted pine nuts instead of the candied almonds. YUM, YUM, YUM. I will be eating a lot more salads in the coming weeks, I think!!

This has become a family (actually 4 families) favorite at all family get togethers. Sister-in-law was first to serve it and she used only 4 ounces of goat cheese and just a handful of candied almonds. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Even the children fell in love with it.

This was an excellent salad, and I am very picky. I used bottled apple cider and candied the almonds in a skillet, as suggested by a previous reader. The apple cider got extremely thick, but thinned out when the vinegar was added. The goat cheese I used did not "crumble," and it would have been better if I had waited to put it in the salad right before serving it. Keep in mind the salad is somewhat sweet. If you don't like sweet things, choose another recipe.

I was wowed by this recipe, as were all my guests, who were upset there weren't third helpings. I did adapt the recipe after reading oter reviews: the 1st time I used a can of apple juice concentrate, but opted to try to reduce a container of apple cider. Though it toook more time (about 45 min.), I had extra which stored nicely in the refridge. I also used half the sugar, with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. Fabulous!

I made this for guests who don't always try new things. They loved it. Everyone actually had seconds. I can't wait to make it again. However, I did cut the olive oil in half and it was perfect. Also, I made the candied almonds differently...spray a skillet with cooking spray and toast almonds over med-high heat until golden brown, then add some sugar...by eye (I used about 1/3 cp). I also sprinkled a little(not too much)cayanne pepper on the sugar. Then stir constantly until sugar is completely melted and remove from heat. This is considerably easier than the recipe calls for and the cayeanne pepper adds a slight twist, plus the almonds don't clump.

How often do people ask for seconds on salad? Guests at my dinner party last weekend were fighting over the last leaves in the bowl--this is a great salad recipe for a party. Yes, the dressing is oily, but delicious. I just toasted the almonds with sugar and salt to save some time, and it works.

My mother made this recipe for our Christmas Eve dinner to rave reviews. The dressing is a bit of work, but I didn't find this recipe to be too labor-intensive. I did as one other reviewer mentioned and simply heated the almonds with a bit of sugar (use about 1/3 the amount of sugar listed) to caramelize them - not only is this easier, but it toasts the almonds at the same time! Tip: you can caramelize a large batch of almonds and freeze a bunch for use later. I used less goat cheese (6-8 ounces) and less almonds than called for and I added some dried cherries - they were great. I reduced the amount of olive oil to 1/4 cup and the dressing was still delicious. This salad is outstanding and we love it!

I made this for guests over the weekend, and this recipe has now made it into my elite list of treasured favorite salads! I used pecans instead of almonds and imported French goat cheese. Consistent with the reports of other reviewers, the dressing was just incredible. Although it's not specifically stated, be sure to boil the cider over no higher than medium heat, otherwise it will scorch and ruin the reduction. Although a little time consuming, it's more than worth it!

I made this salad for christmas eve and it turned out great. I used only 2 cups of apple cider and reduced for approx 25-30 min. and I ran out of onion so left that out. I made it in advance and chilled overnight. About the almonds-- I make candied walnuts or almonds all the time for another salad and just simply sprinkle a little sugar in a small saucepan w/ the nuts and heat on med/low til sugar melts. Just keep stirring to coat nuts then transfer to bowl and break up a little, very easy--they only get too clumpy when you use too much sugar. I will definately make this again and might try feta next time.

watch out for the oil in this salad!! a whole cup is 12 servings of oil (for an 8-serving recipe) and a tablespoon of olive oil has 14 grams of fat. i made the recipe with 4 tbsp of oil and even then thought that the oil coated the other flavorings just a tad bit too much. also thought that the almonds were a pain in the butt; mine clumped as well. i think the trick might be a MUCH softer caramel, i.e. letting the sugar get quite darker than "amber" before pouring it on the almonds.

My mother made this for my birthday dinner. She is quite an accomplished cook and fessed up that this was the most effort she had ever put forth for a salad. Not knowing exactly how long it was, I can say I thought it scrumptious and would love to have it again! I think it might be worth checking out another candied almond recipe because these were rather chunky clusters. The dressing and goat cheese were incredible. I didn't care if I ate another thing all night; the salad made my meal.

Excellent salad! I wasn't quite sure my husband would like the sweetened almonds as he is not a lover of anything sweet in a salad. He really liked it and so did my dinner guests who asked for the recipe. I can't wait to make it again, not only for guests but just for us. My friend suggested using frozen apple cider concentrate instead of fresh cider. It would definitely cut down on the cooking time for the reduction which, as most people pointed out, is longer than the 23 minutes stated in the recipe.

I was really excited about this recipe until I made it. I had to try three times to get the candied almonds right - maybe the high altitude? Very frustrating. The flavors were okay, but overall I found this disappointing, particularly after such rave reviews.

I also had problems w/ the almonds - mine ended up in a big chunk and even when I managed to break a few small slivers off, it didn't really taste all that great. Of course, I am not a perfectionist and sometimes do not have the patience to be real particular with what I am cooking - so I take full responsibility for the nut failure. I know you can buy candied pecans etc but have never seen candied almonds - I am sure they are out there though and I would definitely forgo the hassles of making my own and spend a little extra $ for nuts already candied. BUT the salad combination was excellent and the dressing was delicious - I am fairly picky about dressings with vinegar but this one was so tasty that I was glad I had left over. I thought it was great just the way it was and didn't add anything else - sometimes simple saldas are the way to go.

Great salad! I did find that the reduced cider shouldn't get too cool, or it will solidify - like jelly. I also omitted the poppy seeds and did't feel it was missing anything. I will also add more almonds for the amount of syrup. (I have found cider syrup on-line; said it is reduced cider.)

Great salad and worth the substantial effort! I used half the oil the recipe called for and found that was plenty. I also added dried cranberries (craisins) - this added a bit of tartness and great color. My goat cheese seemed to melt into the salad like someone else said but that was fine. The cider took about 50 minutes to reduce and the almonds were a pain to separate. All in all, my 18 guests loved the salad and it was a bit hit! I'll definately make it again.

I usually love this type of salad, but I found it a little overwhelming. I'm wondering if I did something wrong. To begin with, the "candied almonds" that I was supposed to break up with a fork turned out to be a large rectangle of "almond brittle" that I had to pound with a mallet, roll with a rolling pin, and finally put in my food processor to break up. It ended up in small chunks, not slivers of almonds. Then, when my apple cider was cool, it had the consistency of very thick jelly,so I then had to mix the dressing (minus the oil)in my processor also, to get rid of the apple cider chunks. The flavor was good, but I found the almonds overpowering --I was expecting a light, crisp almond. Please, someone, tell me if I did something wrong. After reading all the glowing reviews, I found myself scratching my head.

Nice dressing. Tip: to "quick reduce" the apple cider divide by thirds and reduce in shallow saute pans.

This was great. I had a similar salad made with pears and walnuts at a restaurant called The Pig's Eye in Salem, MA about 6 month's ago and have been looking for somthing like it since. This was very close. The goat cheese seemed to melt in the dressing so next time I will try feta. I tried w/all mescaline greens and then some mesacline greens mixed with green leaf lettuce, and it was definately better mixed. I also used pecans instead of almonds, I liked more than few. The dressing is very light and seems low cal, hardly any oil. I also omited the poppy seeds. I plan to make at my next gathering.

This is a fantastic salad - I made it exactly as called for in the recipe - it only took me about 25 minutes to reduce the apple cider. I will share this with many of my friends.

I have tasted a variation of this salad, which included tart dried cranberries, and a sprinkling of scallions - I can't take any credit for these additions, but they are very nice! The cranberries add color and texture.

If you don't like goat cheese you can use a mild feta. Baby spinach is wonderful in this salad and it holds up better.

I haven't made this yet. It sounds wonderful, but I don't like goat cheese. What other would you recommend?

I served this salad on Thanksgiving and my family devoured it. Some minor modifications made it more nutritious and really, really tasty: instead of mesclun, use baby spinach. Also add diced roasted golden beets or sweet potatoes. The colors look lovely together. NOTE: you'll have way more almonds than you'll need for the salad; however, they're so yummy you'll find other uses for them...terrific on slices of gingerbread with creme anglais.

Looks good...there's a great similar salad here at my favorite restaurant in the Los Angeles area, CHEZ MELANGE in Redondo Beach. Mixed greens, goat cheese, candied pecans and pears in a sherry vinaigrette. Superb.

Fantastic salad. Worth the effort. It does take longer than indicated to reduce cider - perhaps 50 minutes. I halved the quantity of goat cheese and added thinly sliced apple.

Salad recipes don't get any better than this. Note -- it took about an hour to reduce the apple cider, but it might have been the altitude.
