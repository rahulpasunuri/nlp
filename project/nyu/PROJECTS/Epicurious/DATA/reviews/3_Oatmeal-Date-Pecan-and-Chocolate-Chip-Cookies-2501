I changed a lot to this, so not rating the recipe, but since the cookies that came out were rated as 'scary good' by a colleague, I thought I'd review: Instead of dates and pecans (allergies in my household), I added dried cranberries, white chocolate chips and a handful of coconut (unsweetened). Kept everything else, except I halved the white sugar. They did run, but were still chewy in the middle. Might do even less sugar next time as they were still a tad too sweet for my taste Oh, and you have to watch them! In my oven these adapted ones were done in 7-8 minutes.

I used slightly more than 1 cup of flour and oatmeal - I used quick oats instead of old-fashioned (it's what I had on hand). I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2/3 cup. I could probably have cut back the white sugar too - the dates make these cookies plenty sweet. Finally, I added 4 tbsp groud flaxseed - it adds nutritional value and density without affecting the flavour. The cookies turned out soft, round and yummy! I'm rating this a 2 because of all the alterations I had to make. Probably won't make them again.

I baked these after reading the reviews so I, too, went 1/2 and 1/2 on the flour and oatmeal. In fact, I added *slightly* more of both and some dessicated coconut. They were not at all runny, and got great reviews by my friends when they were eaten straight out of the oven.

I wish I had read the reviews before making these; they did indeed run all over the baking sheet. They still taste all right, but they're quite thin.

So the recipe as it's printed is nasty. BUT taking the advice of other reviewers (1 cup flour, 1 cup oats, no baking powder) makes for a good cookie: firm but chewy. I shaped little balls more the size of rounded teaspoons and slightly flattened them. They took about 12 minutes to back and made 65 cookies.

Before I made these cookies, I read with interest the reviews discussing omittimg or including the baking powder. I chose to include the baking powder. I used 1 cup of oats and 1 cup of flour. These cookies were light, chewy, and tasty. The combination of the baking powder and baking soda is what made them so light. My daughter said they were her favorites of all the cookies I made this Christmas.

After reading the previous reviews I was a little nervous about making this, but they turned out great! I increased the flour to 1 cup and decreased the oatmeal to 1 cup and left out the baking powder entirely. The cookies were thin, crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. My husband loved them!

Wow, these were delicious! I tried reducing the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. after reeading the other review...they were a little hard to manage still.

The taste was there but the cookies turned out a disaster! Am questioning the 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. baking soda. If I make it again, will try bars instead.
