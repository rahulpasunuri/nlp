Interesting Recipe. This chowder does not resemble any chowder I have had befor because itt had alot more liquid than usual.I would only use 3 bottles of clam juice and replace some of the milk with heavy whipping cream to give it some thickness. All the clam juice made it very clammy. I also used 5 cups of almond milk instead of cow milk. No butternut squash so I used paddy pan which worked out just fine. For the fish porition I used halibut and salmon and almost twice the amount of bacon. Recipe was easy enough to make while consuming copious amounts of wine. The kale was an excellent addition and brought some color to it.

New England Seafood Chowder???!!! Why call this "New England"? With curry and kale and butternut squash? Put what you want into a chowder, but do not mislabel it as "New England". My Cape Cod ancesters are spinning in their graves. I was amused at the quantity this made; someone in the test kitchen was into the cooking sherry, I guess!

I have made this twice now and love it! I use shrimp (26-30 count), the little sea scallops and cod. The sweetness of the scallops and the butternut squash in contrast with the earthiness of the curry is a fantastic combo. I love this soup. I keep forgetting to add more kale, the kale is terrific. I did substitute shrimp stock for 2 of the bottles of clam juice. I just threw the peels in 2 and a half cups of water added a little salt and cooked it for about 15 minutes. It's truly a delicious and satisfying bowl of chowder with a nice thin tasty broth. (think I'll have another bowl now!)

This recipe is kind of misleading. It says it is healthy. I want to know how is using bacon in a recipe healthy. Other than that clam chowder isn't suppose to be healthy. It's made with cream/milk and butter.

We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. We had steamed mussels for an appy, so it was an all-seafood meal. Like many other reviewers, we halved the recipe. I used 1 cup of whipping cream in place of the half and half, and added some chopped fennel to the mix (as we had some from our appy). For fish we used 1/2 lb each of pacific cod, prawns, and small scallops. I also finished by adding 2 tbs of butter to thicken and richen at the end. So my version is perhaps less "healthy" than the original, but it was very tasty.

Light and flavorful, this recipe was quick and healthy. Not the thick chowder I recall from out East, but worth making again. The recipe as is makes way too much soup--I made 1/8 the recipe which yielded 4 large bowls. Also substituted yam for squash.

Let's see... 2 1/2 quarts of liquid, 3 lbs. of potatoes, 3 lbs. of squash, 3 lbs. of fish, serves 8. 8 what? Gorillas?

On another note can somebody tell me if you can freeze chowder?

I loved this recipe! Like many others I halved the recipe and eliminated the Kale. The only other small change I made was to add a water flour mixture near the end in order to thicken the chowder.

This is not New England Seafood Chowder but a variation by someone who could not leave well-enough alone. See New England Fish Chowder for an authentic recipe.

This recipe is delicious, but be warned. It makes at least twice the servings noted - 16-20, not 8!! I should have realized 3 lbs of fish is way too much for chowder for 8. I made 4 times the recipe for a big party. After feeding 50 people, I had at least as much left as I served! I gave a bunch away and froze some, so will see how that works. I would definitely make it again, only less!!

This soup tasted better each day we had it for leftovers. I used 1/2 the amount of clam juice and added chicken broth in its place. Overall, a great and easy soup--I liked the squash and kale in it!!

Excellent chowder! I made the base of the soup a day before I served it. Modifications I made to the recipe were: added an extra 1.5 cups kale, add 1.5 c. fresh clam meat, and use reserve clam broth from the fresh clams instead of bottled clam juice. Also, instead of adding half and half to the soup, I added a bit of fresh cream to each bowl of chowder before serving. Very tasty!

The flavor was fine, with the curry prime to the dish's identity. I used clams, squid, octopus et cetera instead of fish. I also used amaranth insead of kale and cut the onions by half making up the difference with sweet peppers. I used my own clam broth and eliminated the half and half, using some left over cream instead (adding the dairy only at the end after the heat was turned off.) I did not add salt since reduction of the clam broth brings out the salt in the broth. I also used precooked spaghetti squash preferring a different texture to counterbalance the chunky potatoes. What bothered me -- greatly -- was calling it "New England Seafood Chowder." Lastly, calling a dish with curry "New England" is like calling a Creole dish "Polish." Curry is not a traditional New England seasoning. The dish should be "Curried Seafood Chowder."

This was a wonderful dish!I used a pound each of haddock and cod, 3/4lb lobster meat, 1lb large shrimp, and 2 cans of minced clams. Instead of 5 cups of milk and 1 of half and half, I used 2cups of milk, 2cups half and half, and 2 cups of whipping cream. Will make this a holiday favorite!

The flavor of this was incredible, and all ingredients came out tender and flavorful. However, I had trouble with my sauce becoming grainy/separating. Anyone else have this problem? Perhaps I over-cooked it after adding the milk and cream? It still tasted yummy, however, and since I wasn't serving it to guests, it wasn't a big deal... Oh, and definitely halve the recipe if you're not serving a crowd.

Excellent recipe! Both my husband and I agreed that we would have been impressed if it had been served to us at a top restaurant. On the advice of the person with too much left over, I halved the recipe. The market only had one bottle of clam juice available, so I also used Knorr fish bouillon. A pound and a half of fish seemed like an awful lot, so didn't use quite that much. Added some crushed red pepper to spice things up a bit. Saving this one for company.

This chowder was excellent! Be warned that it makes a huge amount - we had to call in our family and friends to help us eat it when we realized how much chowder we just made! It was truly delicious and we will definitely make it again!

VERY FLAVORFUL IN TASTE. LIGHT, NOT HEAVY ON THE STOMACH. GREAT WITH CRUSTY BREAD AND SALAD. GLASS OF WHITE OR BLUSH WINE COMPLIMENTS IT AS WELL.
