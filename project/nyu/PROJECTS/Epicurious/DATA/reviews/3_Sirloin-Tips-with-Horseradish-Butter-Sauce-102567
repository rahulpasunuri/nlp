Great for a quick dinner on a Sunday or weeknight, simple with easy flavors that come together well. I paired this with sauteed zucchini and mashed parsnips which was great; the tangy horseradish butter worked well with the sweet parsnips. Will definitely be making this again.

This is a nice simple recipe for novice cooks. This one of the first recipes I ever made when I moved into my house and really started cooking. The more you cook, the more creative you can get and build onto this recipe, but if you want a quick simple recipe, this will do fine, and it tastes great!

I was skeptical after reading the reviews but I had all the ingredients and was short on time. I made rosemary roasted sweet potato from this site and added steamed green beans for a complete meal. Delicious and quick!!

Yuck! Partly my fault for using not prepared horseradish but jarred horseradish sauce, but the results were much less than desirable. May try again sometime with the right ingredient.

This dish was good and pretty easy to make. I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and since there was a lot of great sauce leftover, we put it on those too.

We enjoyed this recipe. Used a prepared horseradish, had one on hand that was a "smoky horseradish." I thought it added great flavor to it and would definitely make it again. Served with mashed potatoes for a very quick weeknight meal! We did not find our tips to be tough at all, I cooked them for 5 minutes on each side.

Such a wonderful, simple way to have a very quick main dish! I use whatever steak I would usually cook this way, just do the pan sauce with it. I do love horseradish, and will say that if you have a weak or old horseradish, it will not be as good. It weakens severly with age.

Not bad, but nothing very exciting either. I put the sauce on a regular ribeye. I think there are better ways to serve steak. I'm a horseradish fan, but this just didn't do much for me.

Simple, excellent flavor. I use a good quality sirloin steak (not tip, not sure if I have ever seen a sirloin tip?) and it was wonderful.

I also bought quality meat and it was still tough. I did like the flavor that it gave the meat but I think it could use even more horseradish.

This was pretty good :) My bf loved it and the leftovers were fantastic too :)

Colleen, took your advice, and added shallots. V. nice, indeed. I think this dish totally depends on the quality of the meat. Ours wasn't particulary flavorful, but the dish was still quite good. I would like to see how it "behaves" with more flavorful steak.

This was a very good recipe...I had noticed that some of the other reviews were rather a mixed bag, so had some misgivings...but all for naught! I used an inexpensive top sirloin steak cut in half to serve two but kept the proportions of the sauce the same (the steak was about 1 1/2 lbs altogether so...). It was so good and my husband loved it. Just the right amount of rareness to the meat cooking it in the cast iron skillet for that amount of time, too. We will be having this often. I would think that adding a few chopped shallots to the recipe at some point wouldn't hurt either!

Though I bought the sirloin tip at the best butcher in town it was tough and the sauce bitter--we were unimpressed.

I don't give out 4 forks easily but this recipe deserved it. Not only did it have fabulous flavor it is SO easy, quick and has ingredients from the "pantry". It's going in the Tried and Proven folder!!

This was one of the worst dishes I have ever made. Nothing one could do would make it taste better.

I also used the beef tips, and they just were not good enough quality for this recipe. They were too tough. I need to try again with better meat -the recipe has potential to be great.

This is a definite keeper. Made for guests and all left with the recipe! Great with mashed pototoes!

For such a simple recipe, this is a wonderful dish. The horseradish butter is delicious. I used a regular sirloin steak and cubed it. Also, I used creamy horseradish for the sauce (and not as much butter as the recipe called for).

I've made this quick and easy dish many times and its always outstanding. I slice the steaks, return them to the sauce to coat and then serve over buttered noodles. Comfort food at its best!

The sauce really makes this dish. A good quick evening meal. I made it with beef sirloin tips which was a little tough, even cooking it medium rare.

This dish was great! It was tender and juicy, spicy and pungent. I served it with a Tomatoe and Vidalia salad. It's also great over wild rice.

This was really easy and really good. The sauce is excellent if you like horseradish.
