This didn't come out perfectly for me -- but probably because of the modifications made necessary by my pantry. I have never seen a grocery carry anything called meatloaf mix in any MidWestern (that's WEST of the Mississippi) cities where I have lived. However, my own freezer always has venison, so that's what I use. I added a bit of olive oil to replace some fat, but it should have had some pork added too to make it a stabilized loaf. Still the flavors were very nice. I made a horseradish, dill sauce to serve with it (I knew there wouldn't be pan juices with venison), and we loved it!

Ever since I tried this, it has been my go-to recipe for meatloaf! I bake the two loaves in a large cast-iron skillet, which makes the cooking of the sauce, on one burner, very easy. My son and I love it as is, but my husband likes a separate sauce made with chili sauce, brown sugar, and cider vinegar, which is really quick to make.

I prepared it with grass-fed beef, without veal or pork, and it was still moist and tasty.

Nice and moist, great flavor & texture, and very easy to make. I used half beef and half pork. Though we liked it, and the mustard-dill combo was certainly a winner, the conclusion was that it was best with some (not overly sweet) ketchup. So Ill probably opt for a more traditional ML version next time, or maybe adjust this ML recipe to include a ketchup glaze on top.

I made this with 1 1/4 pounds of lean organic ground beef that I had on hand. This is so delicious, my family who isn't crazy about meat loaf in general loved it. It is now going to be my go to recipe for meat loaf. Easy, moist, savory.

I used beef pork combo, caramelized the onions, added some garlic. I added cornstarch to the gravy at the end. Overall it was good, but not great. The mustard dill flavors did not come through. Will I make it again? Maybe.

Best meatloaf EVER for people who don't like tomato meatloaf and do like dill. Seriously, I'll never make another recipe ever again. However, the cook time was off. It took my oven set at 450 deg. 36 minutes. Oh, and the only change I made was I caramelized the onions first. Mwah!

Amazing! We used a mix of ground pork and bison. Tender, moist, and perfect w/ mashed potatoes!

Yummers. As a single person I love the two little loafs: one tonight, one for the freezer. I also jumped at the opportunity to make this a "one pot meal" with one loaf, and a couple quartered Yukon potatoes in a cast iron pan (don't like the idea of putting a baking sheet on my electric stove). Everything came out beautifully including the gravy which I started with a rue and pumped up with a little extra dijon. Can't wait to pull the second loaf out of the freezer for a repeat performance!

This is the best meat loaf I have ever made. Like a lot of people I made tons of changes, so, really, when you think about it, I didn't make this meat loaf at all. So let me revise that statement: The meat loaf that I made tonight was the best meat loaf I have ever made.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times now as my family doesn't like the traditional ketchup-covered meatloaf. The addition of soaking the oats in liquid makes it incredibly moist and the combination of mustard and dill is perfect. My 3-year-old daughter absolutely loves it and asks for it all the time.

This is very good and simple to put together. I only had chicken stock on hand, so used that and it work just fine. (Probably a less pungent and salty taste?) I only used ground beef, versus a mix of meats. I also only had dried dill, so used that, and the flavor was less pronounced. Overall flavor and texture is like a good juicy burger -- more so than a traditional meatloaf. If I were to make again, I would definitely try caramelizing the onions first, for a more complex flavor.

This recipe was delicious! My family loved it. It was moist and flavorful. and super easy. I only had sirloin and pork and they worked great. A keeper!

Had some ground sirloin, so...needles to say it was fast, easy, and delicious, the texture of meatloaf, but the flavor of something very gourmet. Used 1 tbsp died dill, sauteed the onions, and added a splash of red wine to the drippings which I scraped into a small pan to boil down. There weren't many brown bits to scrape up. Tool a lille longer than 25 minutes. Next time may try making in one large loaf. Had carmelized sweet potatoes with diced dried apricots and baby peas. Of course, a glass of that red wine. Very content

I loved this meat loaf, very easy and I will make it again. I did broil the top for a few minutes at the end. Since there were two small loves, I put some leftover cheese in the center of one, it worked. Also I added approx. two tablespoons of red wine (had a glass in my hand at the time) to the liquid for deglazing. Delicious!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. My husband made the traditional ketchup version while I made this and we had his 10-year-old daughter be the judge on which one was better. She picked mine!

Love this recipe! I used all ground beef because that's what I usually have on hand. I sauté the onions first because I don't like crunchy onions. I also used rosemary instead of dill because I did not have any fresh dill. So moist and yummy! This is now my go to meatloaf recipe.

Rating: 3
Certainly not the 'same- old-boring-meatloaf- recipe'. Made to the letter with the exception of adding about 1/2 teaspoon Worchestershire because of routine use with any recipe that calls for mustard. Served with Oven -carmelized Brussel Sprouts and Sage-brown buttered-mushroom noodles. Fabulous! Rave reviews. Will make again and again.

yum yum yum! the store I shop at was out of ground veal and premade meatloaf mix, so I ended up mixing beef, pork & lamb. wow it was yummy! other than that I followed the recipe exactly. while I think the veal would be good, I honestly think the inclusion of lamb in the recipe made it all the better.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I only had 1 lb. meatloaf mix (1/4 pork sausage, 3/4 very lean ground beef), so I substituted 3 oz. chopped baby carrot for the missing 1/4 lb. meat (adds colour as well). I also had no fresh dill, so used 1 Tbs. dried dill and ended up with a nice subtle flavour. I used a small loaf pan, and with the oats, got a bit of "stickage" on the sides of the pan, so got a nice basis for gravy. This will be my standard meatloaf recipe from here on out.

This may be my favorite new meat loaf recipe. I will definitely make it again. I only had chuck and some ground veal from another recipe. Next time I will use the meatload mix, but I have no complaints about the way it turned out without the pork.

Used a half-and-half ground beef/ground turkey mixture for the meat and didn't make the gravy, but thought this was an excellent spin on meatloaf. Very savory. Great for sandwiches.

i had a craving for meatloaf but im not really a fan of the whole tomato sauce/ketchup version i thought this was amazing. i made do with what i had on hand so used regular dijon mustard and no onions. i didnt fully read the directions and ended up pouring the remaining 1/2 cup broth over the loaves before baking so i dont know if this may have added to the yummyness or not. but i def will be making this again however next time i will be adding in onions either reg ones or frenchs fried as well as possibly some hard boiled egg whites.

Love this! I usually add a little milk and flour to thicken gravy but always make as written otherwise and enjoy it every time.

My family did not like it! My husband did not like the flavor of the dill or the texture of the oatmeal (used the irish oatmeal). My children smothered it in ketchup (would not try the gravy with mushrooms) and still did not eat much. My housekeeper and I were the only ones who liked it and I did not love it, so it will be deleted from my files.

Haven't made meatloaf in ages. This is a real keeper as written. Used canned gravy as the drippings were a little too greasy. So moist and delicious. The mustard and dill add great flavor. Served with garlic green beans and mashed pototaoes for a realy "manly" meal.

As far as meat loaf goes, this is definately "4-forks." When I announced we were having meatloaf, my husband made the mistake of getting out the ketchup - I almost cut his hand off and had to explain "this was different!" To our surprise, it was very different and great. I also served the Creme Fraiche Mashed Potatoes (also from epicurious) which accompany the Short Ribs Provencale (great recipe). A few notes: I almost soaked the oats in the enitire 1 cup of beef broth until I realized it calls for only 1/2 cup of the stock. Also, based on a few other comments, I looked at the meatloaf after 20 minutes and it wasn't very browned on the outside, so I finished it off under the broiler. The "crusty" outside made it that much better!

This is the first time I've made meat loaf and my family loved it. Used ground turkey instead of the mixture recommended, also bake it in a loaf pan instead of a cookie sheet. Excellent dish and so easy to prepare.

This was so good and so easy to make! I used gravy made from a commercial packaged gravy powder mix instead of sauce from deglazing the pan, and it was still very good. I will definitely be making it again.

I've never liked meat loaf until making this recipe. Flavour is fantastic. Gourmet meat loaf. Who knew?

This is a good and healthy meat loaf. It is savory avoiding the usual sweet accompaniment of ketchup. Makes great sandwiches with whole grain mustard the next day.

I've made this three times now, and tonight I used 7% ground turkey, and it came out great! It did need a few extra grind of pepper and a couple of dashes of hot sauce since turkey is rather bland. Also, I always find myself tossing in more dry oatmeal at the end when I'm mixing it all together.

This has become quite a hit among my friends for a simple mid-week meal. It's a novelty because we don't eat 'meatloaf' in the netherlands, but giant meatballs. Great taste, although it never comes out quite as 'crusty' as i would like. maybe the oats i use are different than the ones you get in the States.

My fiance went back for three helpings! The combination of flavors make this meatloaf absolutely delicious. This is definitely a keeper!

Great dish - instead of making the sauce, I added the beef stock to the pan for the last 10 minutes of cooking. very juicy! The dill comes out more when the loafs cool, which makes for flavorful cold sandwiches.

This meatloaf recipe was great. I have never been a huge fan of meat loaf, but I will definately be making this again. I made the recipe exactly as written. Next time I would chop the onions finer and saute them a bit so they are not so obvious in the final recipe. As suggested in the magazine, I used the leftovers for sandwiches. Very good!

Pretty good, and pretty easy to put together. Amazingly, my 5 year old gobbled this up and wanted to make sure there'd be leftovers the next day. He's not generally fond of meat - so I was stunned - and tickled to have another dinner option for the list.

Delicious!!! I sauteed the onions first like someone suggested. Also found that the cooking time was a bit longer than 25 minutes. A recipe to convert any meatloaf skeptic.

Too chicken to use oats, but this was delicious anyway. Used only ground beef and pork but still succulent. My ketchup loving meatloaf husband liked this as well and thought it was a nice change of pace. It made two good sized loafs--plenty of leftovers.

My search for the perfect meatloaf for my family has ended! After trying tons & tons of different recipes from lots of different sources, this one is it! My family does not like meatloaf with ketchup-based sauces so this one fit the bill. I personally don't care for "homestyle" foods much and meatloaf is way down on my list but even I liked this one. Using the meatloaf mix(pork, beef, veal) and fresh dill I think made this one stand out. The only alteration I made was to grate the onion before mixing in into the meat to disguise it from my son.

Rating: 4
I wish I could give this recipe 5 Stars!!! Serious yummies, and I don't generally care for meatloaf. Did sautee the onion (as another reviewer suggested) prior to mixing it into the other ingredients. Could not find meatloaf mix, so I substituted 1 lb. Pilgrim's Pride ground turkey plus 1/4 lb. lean ground beef. No fresh dill was to be found either, so used 2 tsp. of dried dill weed. When the loaves were done, I scraped the baking sheet juices and tidbits into a small saucepan, added the remaining broth, brought this to a boil, and thickened it with a mixture of cornstarch and water. This eliminated having to place the baking sheet between two burners and further burning on the stuck on tidbits, making clean-up easier. Served the meatloaf with leftover mashed potatoes ("Mashed Potato, Cheese, and Chive Gratin", Bon Appetit, December 2001), and plain old nuked frozen corn kernels. It was a meal to die for. Do make this meatloaf--you won't be sorry. I felt that this recipe made 4 generous portions.

My family loved this meatloaf. Was the first time I have cooked meatloaf for my 3 yr old and she loved it also.

Good stuff. I doubled it to serve six and every morsel was eaten, so I am not sure the single recipe would serve four hungry people (=guys). The mustard and dill flavors came through well. However, I sauteed the onions before adding - otherwise I am not sure they would have cooked enough and I am not a fan of crunchy onions in my meat loaf.

Very good. The only change I made was to use Colman's English Mustard instead of dijon. Making a jus from the cooking sheet really enhanced the vegetable sides I served with this.

The recipe is very good, but not great. Unlike most reviewers however, I actually like meatloaf with ketchup so that may be my problem. Anyway, I made the meatloaf as prescribed, but when I tasted the sauce I thought it lacked flavor. So, I sauteed some mushrooms, added a little marsala, thickened with cornstarch, and then added about 1/2 tsp. of dijon mustard to the sauce. Turned out pretty well.

This was excellent, looking forward to making it again. Just don't use an insulated pan to heat the broth and pan drippings. There was a reason why the broth would not boil!

I am a food snob. I have made meat loaf a total of two times in my entire life. On a whim I decided to make this recipe (my husband came home and said YOU made meat loaf?!?). It was GREAT! The combo of veal, pork and beef make it very juicey and the mustard and dill give it a wonderful flavor. I'm giving this recipe 4 forks because anything that would make me like meat loaf has to be good!

This is great! I particularly loved the dill. It made for very tasty comfort food, as well as excellent sandwiches the next day. Like one of the other reviewers, I wasn't able to get ground veal this time, so used a mixture of beef and pork. Will try with a combination of all three next time.

My market had no ground veal so had to settle for just beef and pork this time. This is a tasty, juicy meat loaf. Mine took a bit longer to cook --- about 35 minutes. Mashed potatoes are the perfect side dish.

I made this dish (with only beef) along with mashed potatoes, creamy peas, crusty bread and red wine. The combination was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make it again.
