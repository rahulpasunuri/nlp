Since I've discovered this recipe 2 weeks ago, I've made it 3 times. Usually I just eat it all myself (what the family doesn't know can't hurt them, right?) but tonight I'm going to share with family and guests. I toast the crostini for the sake of convenience, but otherwise recipe is perfect as is. Thanks to the Kelleys for this recipe

I just made this recipe for a second time, and it is just as good as the first. I toasted the fennel seeds and then grinded them to avoid any crunchy seeds. Used the garlic cloves, added a few more olives, and a little extra orange peel/juice. I'm sure grilling the bread is the best way to go, but toasting it under the broiler is much easier. Complex flavors; great with wine; mine comes out very garlicky, but that's a good thing.

Fantastic and easy to make appetizer. The fennel seeds and orange flavors offset the olives nicely. I didn't grill the bread, I just popped it in my toaster oven which works well enough.

I made this as an appetizer for a Sunday brunch, and it went over really well. I made sure to grind the fennel seeds so they were not too crunchy, and I added a small garlic clove and garlic scapes instead of the chives. I also found it to be pretty salty, so I added 1 tsp agave nectar. This sat overnight, which was really key. I used the leftover bread and toasted it, added chevre, and spread the olives on it for a lunch sandwich teh next day.

I've made this over and over and finally got around to writing a review. It has been a huge hit every time I've prepared it. The delicate and unusual combination of the green olives (I use the fat Sicilian ones...whatever you do, don't use those crappy things in a can), orange, and toasted fennel is brilliant. I substitute finely minced fresh garlic for the garlic chives. Throw this together using a homemade crusty baguette and some good wine and your guests will be in heaven. Truly an outstanding appetizer with strong and complex flavors.

This was exceedingly tasty and a hit at my dinner party. I prepared the olives the day before, so the flavors melded nicely. I especially like the orange flavor.

I have served this recipe now twice and have had nothing but exceptional results with everyone asking for the recipe. It is easy to do except a little cumbersome to toast bread on the grill (but it is great that way). This last time I had the cheese sliced into pieces and ready to go and brushed both sides the oil before going to the grill. Other toppings like olive oil roasted tomatoes, peppers with basil,garlic, and salt&pepper are also wonderful on the goat cheese bread.

I served the crostini at a party, and they were a huge hit! I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to offer something fancy but with little preparation. I chopped up the olives ahead of time, so when it was time to put the crostini in the oven (don't own a grill), they were ready within 5 minutes or so.

I found it a little sour and salty from the olives, but the goat cheese definitely saved it for me. This dish was good, although I prefer the "grilled bread topped with arugula, goat cheese, olives and onions" recipe on this site.

I wasn't entirely wild about the flavors of the orange and fennel marinade for the olives, although I will say that the olives I purchased were especially bitter, so that might have had something to do with the overall effect. They were also very messy to eat and I felt particularly rushed at the last minute to make them. Sorry...I LOVE olives and goat cheese and crostini but this combination just wasn't my cup of tea!

I have made and served this twice and everyone said this is a keeper! Even served it with a Bray Rosato. YUM

After the crostini were finished, my guests went into the kitchen and ate the remaining olive mixture directly from the bowl. Although I thought the fennel seeds were a bit crunchy, nobody else seemed to mind. This was a big hit!
