Too much batter. Not enough cayenne. Fritters lost crispiness in oven - maybe put on rack? Great idea though. But I'll probably stick to fried okra since it is already perfection.

We have okra coming out our ears with our garden this year. This recipe came to the rescue and was a big hit. I used turkey bacon which had no fat to render so I used olive oil to saute the veggies and to fry the fritters. My Hubby can't stop talking about them;-)

I first made these last year and loved them - then my recipe got lost in the shuffle and I forgot about it. So glad to see it posted again - I will be cooking them for a pork barbeque this weekend. They are great.

good recipe to use when you don't have access to fresh okra; my frozen okra turned out pretty tasty

My wife agreed that it was on the bland side even after I added chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes as had been suggested by an earlier reviewer. I only had yellow cornmeal on hand. To me they turned out alright but a little more spice can make them better.

Oh.My.God. Just made these and they were soooo tasty! I had some shady-looking okra to get rid of and this was definitely the best end for them. My husband, who complains that okra is too slimy, loved them. We're freezing the leftovers to have another day. Will definitely make this again. Mods: I didn't have buttermilk so I followed the other reviewer's recommendation to use milk + 1 tsp vinegar. Also, I only had 1/2 C or cornmeal so had to use 1/2 C corn flour with it.

This was a great way to disguise okra for those of us who aren't crazy about its slimy texture. The whole family enjoyed. I served it with sour cream. I wouldn't go out and buy okra just to make this recipe, but if I have okra around, I will definitely make this again.

Added a spicy pepper from the garden in with the onion and okra, and served with honey, sour cream and hot sauce to spread on top. Delicious! A welcome new way to prepare our large harvest. My husband, who rarely helps himself to seconds, had fourths!

These are the best!! Used the bacon fat but no bacon and substituted milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar for buttermilk since I didn't have any. Also used a combination of chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper. Also while sauteing the okra and onions I added a pinch of Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning for additional flavor. These are the new and improved version of fried okras!!!

Found these bland and too bacony. We love the flavor of okra, so next time we'll use the concept but omit bacon and use less binding for the amount of okra.

Was not thrilled with these at all. Had high hopes, but to tell the truth, would rather just make fried okra. I thought they were quite bland.

Holy Cow, these are good!! The frying oil got all over the place, but one taste made me not mind cleaning it up.

As a Southern girl transplanted to the cold tundra of MN this recipe took me home. A great recipe, easy to make and so very tasty...a wonderful new merger of okra and cornmeal. I made it to accompany barbecue chicken, but next time I am saying goodby to hush-puppies and serve it with catfish.
