This recipe is perfect for a healthy, week night side dish. Too many recipes for sweet potatoes are loaded with sugar and butter, this is just right.

This receipe is good for an easy recipe. It isn't outstanding, but it IS easy. I may make it again when I need an easy and a little different side dish.

Sounds like a waste of foil, why not make a dish like this in a covered gratin dish.
