while i didn't care for the conbination of flavors in this recipe, i really liked the cooking method. i will use this again, but with different herbs, and lemon or orange instead of grapefruit.

I thought the tarragon shallot combo tasted nice, but the grapefruit did not come through much. I would add more grapefruit zest and fruit next time.

Very ho-hum, even with the addition of salt. Grapefruit was too bitter, I'd prefer oranges with fish.

I was intrigued by the grapefruit/tarragon/shallot combination but found the tarragon/shallot flavors were completely overpowered and the fish and grapefruit flavors that didn't seem to work by themselves.

Simply delicious, would not have thought of combining these flavours.

Very nice dish to fix on the boat.....Add salt and lemon pepper to both sides of tuna,though. We use a grill pan to prepare.

We followed recipe to the letter. It's good and very light but I thought the sauce was rather non-distinctive despite the grapefruit. A little extra salt did wonders. Actually I rank this dish as 2.5 forks because we definitely will prepare it again.
