Yuk! If you like authentic mole, this will make you throw up. I could not eat it. My husband who was starving ate it but I could not. The tomatoes did not cook down enough I thought. The seasoning ratio just did not work. How this has this many stars is beyond me.

I think this recipe is excellent as is (with extra chipotle hot sauce to taste--I doubled it). Last night I made it with chicken by starting with just onions in the pan, adding 1 cup chicken broth and few dashes of worchester to mole before blending, and then returning to the pan and simmering two chicken breasts in the mole, uncovered for about 15 min., turning once. When the chicken was done I let cool a bit and then shredded into the sauce. It was a big hit and great leftovers!! Served with cilantro rice (made by blending tbsp lime juice, tbsp olive oil, tbsp chopped onion and 2/3 cup cilantro then mixing with cooked rice), and a salad of baby spinach, avocado, red onion, and orange with lime/olive oil dressing. awesome.

This dish was delicious, and would probably be 4 stars with a few modifications. I think next time I will add additional chipotle to the mixture, and maybe some more salt as well. This definitely isn't enough steak for 4 people...it was a good size for 2 people (both of us don't need that much food). The mole complemented the meat really well. I will make this again!

This was very tasty and very easy. I didn't deviate from the ingredients except for the canned tomatoes. I had some leftover chili relleno sauce and I used that instead. I also used a very high quality steak (leftover prime rib) and I think that made a difference. I'll definitely be making this again.

i would have been more apt to give this recipe more forks if the suggested proportions had been a little more accurate. i halfed the can of tomatoes (if anyone can find a can of crushed tomatoes smaller than 28 oz, consider themselves lucky, because there wasnt any in any of the stores i checked), quadrupled the amount of choc chips and doubled the chipotle. this recipe was good, but was definitely lacking something that i cant quite put my finger on...

dee-lish. we froze leftover sauce and used it on some chicken breasts that we grilled a few weeks later. Awesome. Easy, healthful and tasty. I'll be making this again.

Wow! So much flavor! I really, really enjoyed this. I have never made mole before, but this was very easy with lots of complex flavors. I served it with a corn tortillas and a salad of avocado, orange segments and red onion (as suggested) with a little lime juice, salt and pepper. It sounded very strange to me, but went very well with the richness of the mole. I also did not puree the sauce in the blender, but instead left in chunkier (mainly due to laziness). I don't think this compromised the flavor. The only thing I might change next time is to add a little more chipotle- there wasn't quite as much spice as I would like. Yum!

I would give this a 3 1/2 Fast, easy and very tasty - I used twice the chipotle chiles and twice the chocolate - also used a little extra chicken broth. Unlike other reviewers, I did put the sauce in the blender - also put some leftover sauce on some grilled chicken the next day - delicious!

Easy to prepare and full of flavor. My husband was still raving about this meal the next morning. Just as the other reviewers mentioned, I doubled the chipotle chiles and skipped the step to puree. Perfect blend of chocolate, orange and spice. I will definitely make this again!

Just like the description says, lots of flavor and not a lot of effort. I used about twice the amount of chipotle chiles and it still was not very spicy. And, like the previous reviewer, I skipped the step of pureeing the sauce. The flavors still blended wonderfully.

This recipe is super easy and delivers complex flavors with relative ease. I did not have the cumin on hand, so I substituted a mix of chili powder, smoked paprika and cinnamon on the steak rub. I simply ommitted the cumin in the sauce but increased the chocolate and chipotle. I left my sauce chunky to save time, and it was still great and had sauce to spare.

Great flavorful sauce. I used more chipotle than called for (about a tbsp). And I used stew meat instead of steak, so I left it in the entire cooking time, and cooked a little longer than called for. Still delicious.
