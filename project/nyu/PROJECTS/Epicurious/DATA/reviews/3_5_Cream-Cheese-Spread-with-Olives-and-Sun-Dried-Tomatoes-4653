MAKE AHEAD! Others have recommended that you make this at least one day in advance. That is a must. The flavors have to have time to come together. Everyone enjoyed it at the party I served it at. But if I had made it the day of the party I couldn't have served it. There was that much of a difference in the flavor. I didn't have time to look for tomatoes not in oil so I used the oil packed sundried tomatoes, drained, and the flavor was great. This is a great make ahead dish to have in my file.

This is such a simple, but delicious combination. I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil (drained a bit) because that's what I had on hand. Frankly, I don't think the dried ones boiled in water would be better. The oil gave the spread a little more bite. You can substitute Greek Yogurt for the sour cream - I've done it both ways. It's all good. It is better the second day, though, so plan ahead if you want the best result.

I made it for a get together and it received great reviews. I brought along celery sticks and french bread to spread it on. I plan on using the leftover for sandwich spread. The things that I did different: - used a jar of kalmata olive bruschetta instead of olives - added grated Parmesan cheese - because I did not make it the day before I microwaved the mixture for 3 minutes at level 5, then refrigerated until I needed it. - used Greek yogurt (0% fat) instead of sour cream

Guests raved. Good on bagels obviously too. Made w/ green onions instead- nice color. Better after 3-4 days.

I made this last night to take to a family dinner today. Everyone loved it. I added extra red onion and mixed it in a food processor. Don't forget to add salt and pepper. It's much better when it sits overnight.

Mmm delicious! I would definitely make it again. It's great with french bread or just crackers. I would have put a bit more sour cream in though, because the cream cheese makes it just a bit too thick.

This is always a hit and has great flavor. Quick and easy to make.

Have a similar recipe with fresh thyme and goat cheese added, instead of onion and sour cream and a little olive oil to make the spread more creamy, served with crostini. It is one of our favorites.

I eliminated the onion. This was delicious with Triscuits, and it was better the next day. It is a pretty pink color.

I often serve this as an appetizer with baguette slices. It gets rave reviews and everyone asks for the recipe.

The secret to this recipe is time. I've made it several times and people always comment on how much more flavorful it is the second and even third day after. My guest always love it but the flavors need to meld.

This dip sounded so great--a good mix of some of my favorite things. I thought it was absolutely horrible. The red onion was far too overbearing. No one that tried it really liked it.

This was good--I usually keep a dip on hand and this will be in my rotation. I forgot to soak the sun dried tomatoes and they were quite tart--is soaking always required when you use them?

I threw a fancy dinner party and everyone loved this. It was the first thing gone! I'm back on the site to reprint the recipe to make again for my next party.

I made this 2 days ahead so the flavors would meld, and it was quite good. I served it on sourdough cocktail bread but it's great on crackers too. It could possibly use a little more zip, so I may try adding Worcestershire sauce next time.

It lived up to the good reviews. I used less of the sun-dried tomatoes and it worked well--a little milder.

The flavors were very good together, in this spread. However, the brown color of the final product was unappetizing.
