The dip is a little bland as written. I added garlic, worchestshire sauce and some hot sauce for some zip. Everyone at the party ate it up!

I wouldn't call it a dip. It was bland, even after I added some garlic and extra spinach. I ended up adding some tarragon and using it as a pasta sauce, which was delicious!! I will make it again for that. If it's a dip you want, I would keep it cold (chill the spinach before adding), use green onion, and maybe add water chestnuts or something crunchy.

I thought this dip was delicious served with the potato skins. I added more spinach and was heavy on the shallots (since hubby & I love them). This dip definitely benefits from sitting for a few hours to let the flavors really mingle.

I had very little ingredients and little time to make a dip for a party. I had all the ingredients for this recipie but after reading the negative comments I made a few amendments. Someone said add garlic, so I did that...I also added sundried tomatoes, cumin, chilli peppers, fully caramalized the onions, added some yogurt, then topped the whole thing with shredded cheddar cheese. The dip was zesty and absolutely delicious. Use this recipie as a base and be creative...

I thought this dip was delicious but I didn't get as many compliments as I would have liked for the effort. I think in general people like spinach dip that is served hot....

I make this dip for almost every party I throw and it is always loved. To present the dip, I buy a round loaf of bread, cut a small round off the top, scoop out the inside and serve dip in the bread bowl. It is always a hit.

I omitted the spinach and added raw green onion. I also double the portion of cream cheese and sweated the onoins for almost 30 min. Much better this way. Great with sweet potato chips.

I wasn't impressed. With the amount of time you put into this recipe, it still comes out tasting like store-bought chip dip. I'll try adding waterchestnuts.

Consistency and color were good, but I was surprised at how bland this dip was. Won't make this again.

Ok - another fix is to use fresh or frozen chopped spinach (squeezed), 1/2 bottle cardini's caesar salad dressing, cream cheese (lo-fat's fine), sour cream (ditto), garlic powder, onion powder (like 2-4T), grated fresh onion, grated fresh carrot, finely diced red pepper and a fair amount of pecorino romano cheese. Use the cardini's and the sour cream as thinners as this can get kind of thick. The recipe above is BLAND - I wouldn't even serve it.

Wait! Don't use Knorr's. This can be bland but if you are using it with the potato wedges don't despair. Use the garlic head that you roasted with the potatoes smash it and add it to this dip. I also added a wider variety of onions (scallions, leeks, etc) and made sure they were very well caramelized. The spinach can be eliminated because it's the bland part. Even though I only gave it 2 forks I will and have made it again and again because it's a good recipe at it's core because it also lets you know just how much dip you need for the potatoe wedges.

This was very easy to make and great in a hollowed out loaf of sourdough bread with the extra bread used for dipping! I will definitely make this dip again. I made it low fat for my health consciuos friends using low fat sour cream and cream cheese, still delicious!

I have to disagree with the recent negative reviews. This made a much prettier spinach dip than other recipes I've tried and the texture was nice. I used baby spinach & added a decent amount of garlic when I sauteed my onions/shallots plus some hot pepper sauce and some of the awesome onion powder from the Spice House here in Chicago (a very unique seasoning unlike supermarket onion powder). A flavorful, creamy dip with a pretty color and good texture. 1/2 lb of baby spinach is lot of spinach, maybe the other reviewers didn't add enough? We liked it and it was popular with our guests.

Ditto on the other reviews. Thought we'd try something different for the Superbowl. This had no taste. Sometimes you should just stick with the tried and true....Knorr.

Horrible. Way too bland.

This recipe is a big waste of time and ingredients, i threw it all away it has no zip and has way too much sour cream, not to mention it looks very unappetizing, I agree Knorr is 1000% better. Don't bother, a one fork rating is too generous, it isn't even so-so.

The best spinach and onion dip is the one on the box of Knorr's Vegetable soup & dip mix.

I found this recipe to be very blah. It remained basically untouched at a recent party I threw. I was very surprised considering the rave reviews it got here. I would not waste my time making this again.

This was a big hit with me and guests. Very easy too - to make it pretty, I served it in a hollowed-out french sourdough loaf. Next time I might double the spinach though.

We made this for a New Year's Eve party. It certainly was easy. It does need a little something though - we put in a few red pepper flakes on top and a drop or two of Tabasco.

what about adding some chopped Pine Nuts .

I made this dip for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit. It has a great taste and it is a nice change from using some dried packet and sour cream to serve with veggies and crackers. I would definitely make this again.
