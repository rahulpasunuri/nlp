Collards are just about the only green I don't like, but they keep showing up in my farm share box. This is the first time I actually liked collards. One tip is to cook the greens in a big pan so they're not too crowded. This way you end up with some nice crispiness also, not just steamed in their own water. And the other reviewers are right, reduce the salt...

This is way too much salt for this amount of collard greens. I will definitely use the method again, but the salt made the greens nearly inedible.

This is my go-to recipe for collards. I don't notice the bitterness but sometimes I like bitter greens. It's super quick and easy to pull together, the most laborious part is cutting the collards into the thinnest strips. Mashing the garlic with the salt and allowing that to flavour the oil helps. I don't add any acid - I don't think it needs it. Perhaps an acquired taste! Saudades for Brazil...

This is my new favorite way to prepare collard greens! Great to find an alternative to the slow-cooked, pork-laden variety (it's not like I always have ham hocks on hand)! I used lots of garlic, added chili pepper flakes and a dash of sherry vinegar at the end - I think the addition of some sort of acid is key.

These are delicious. I like to add some red pepper flakes with the garlic and salt. I also find it takes longer to cook the greens until tender, so I add a little water and cook on low for a few minutes. And I add a couple of tbsp of red wine vinegar before serving.

I have read many comments that collard greens prepared in this manner turn out too bitter. I have found sauteing the collards together with a sliced yellow onion sweetens the dish and cuts the bitterness of the greens. This method of sauteing greens is my favorite; however, boiling the same with cabbage also cuts the bitterness of the collards. Have even used the liquid the greens give off to use as an egg drop soup base, believe it or not, with a touch of soy sauce. Deep flavor, delicious.

Made these after our yuppie friends looked at my slow cooked (with bacon!) collards. "WE try to cook them healthfully," they told me. So I tried this recipe with the collards from our CSA share. Both my husband and I found them too bitter for our taste. Nothing seemed to help - sugar, salt, lemon, more lemon, red pepper... Somehow, slow cooking collards (and kale, too) makes them less bitter (we discovered same with kale, which we don't like sauteed but love slow cooked in soup). Sorry healthy people, I'm going back to my slow cooked collards.

this is obviously a no-frills recipe. I added mushrooms and put the greens on a plate in a warm oven while I finished cooking the rest of the meal, which made a few of the greens crisp and smokey which was a nice touch

Excellent 'green' flavor. Chewy and satisfying. Squirt with lemon juice finish to brighten the taste a bit. The long strings of collards, because of the roll and cut method, would be great tossed into some long pasta.

So simple to make and perfect. The little bites of salty garlic mixed with the fresh greens were great. Reduced salt to 1/2 t.

This was really great! I'll have to do my collard greens this way from now on. I'm surprised how many people found the greens too bitter. Perhaps the leaves had been allowed to grow for too long before picking.

We both thought these were too bitter. Never had them before, won't try them again.

I am Southern and never really considered any other way to make collards than slow cooking them to death. However, I was looking for something lighter but still tasty. These were perfect! Seasoned and still slightly crunchy. I will never make collards any other way!! However, I did and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Delicious.

Alright, it may be that we just don't understand the wonders of Collard Greens, but we really didn't like these. I added the lemon, as suggested, the onion, as suggested, and I didn't overcook.....but, we still thought it was bitter and not feeling the soul...at all

Yummy. It was a bit bitter, so I added just a bit of lime juice to cut it.

Amazing, I was only cooking for one so I did about six large collard leaves, with two cloves of garlic, half a serrano pepper, and a few healthy shakes of salt. I topped it off with some lime juice, it was incredible! I miss it already.

Awesome - so fast, so easy, definitely reminds me of when I was in Brazil! It was on the salty side but I'm not sure if I was using as many lbs of greens as specified in the recipe. I used as much as comfortably filled a large pan.

Super yummy! Added peppered bacon for an added bonus, although certainly not necessary. I agree with another reviewer, the salt goes a long way (well, especially if you add bacon!).

This is the only way I cook my greens. I also sautee onion with the garlic. After I mix the greens with the onion and garlic, I boil the greens down in chicken broth for extra taste!

Another new favorite vegetable dish! Finally I found a flavorful, fast, vegetarian recipe for collards.

This is so completely basic to a Brazilian that it seems silly to have a recipe for it. But definitely make this! It is delicious, quick, easy, & healthy! I would only add that the garlic should be doubled and I like to throw in a minced red jalepeno - the color and spice both hit exactly the right note. I love to serve this up along side sweet potatoes & linguica.

Now I know why all the good reviews. This is so simple and good. Especially adding the lemon at the end as someone suggested Mashing the garlic with the salt was essential as well. Final thought...make more than you think you will need. EVERYBODY in my family wanted seconds.

The cutting is essential to the success of the recipe. The stems must be removed, and Brazilian cooks take great pride in being able to cut their "couve" the finest. This is the most laborious part. Don't overcook the garlic or the greens, and salt goes a long way. Give them a little fry on med-high heat, then turn off the heat and cover the pan. The steam will cook it more evenly.

This recipe is crazy easy and fast! Also, the presentation is much more lovely than the wilty, sad looking greens that result from Southern recipes. Delish...

Awesome dish! This is my first review, and I'd give this recipe more forks if I could. I'm from the south and was accustomed to slow cooked collards. I had this version at a Brazlian restaurant and had been wanting to try it at home. The greens taste as yummy as I remember. Thanks for posting it!

I started out wanting a southern style recipe for collard greens and what I found was a recipe that is closer to my heart than my stomach. I spent some time in Nepal and the Nepali women I lived with made "saag" or Nepali mustard greens. I LOVED them and have tried to find a recipe that closely matches it since 2004. I LOVE this recipe!!

Response to "A Cook from Washington". The greens get bitter, 1) if you overcook them, 2) if you don't remove the stems. Another reason could be if the greens are not quite fresh. They should be cut extremely thin, like a blade of grass. My family is from Minas Gerais, where the couve is the best! I like to sauté them just a bit, then let them steam in their own juice with the lid on until they're bright green, then remove the lid and stir a bit more. I also had very finely minced white onion. (personally wouldn't add any pepper, but that's just because of how I grew up)

Absolutely amazing! I made them with another green (swiss chard maybe, sorry roommate bought it and there was no label, it had big ruffled deep green leaves with vibrant red veins). Anyway it was great and this recipe will become a staple at the apartment.

Add some lemon juice once cooked. It makes them even better. My veggie-hating son devours them.

you have to use more salt than expected to make the paste with the garlic. this is a totally unexpected way to cook greens. i have also used this recipe for turnip and mustard greens

The greens were too bitter and I had to try to slow cook them to save them. Thank goodness I didn't use all of my collards. For those who are used to the way collard greens taste when done the "traditional" way, do NOT use this recipe...

I would definitely make the greens this way, but I would mix with kale and mustard and add just 1/4 cup of chicken broth - vegetable if you are vegan to smooth out the flavor. I am a southern by product, so on occasion I do the long term cooking, but I do like the quick cooked ones also because it has a better texture and brighter flavor - thanks Epicurious!
