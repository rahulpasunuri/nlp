We loved this recipe. It was absolutely delicious. We followed the recipe to a T, except I added a bit of garlic powder to the spice mixture rather than minced garlic on the chops (I was worried it would burn). Like others, we don't have a grill so we seared them and cooked on 400 degrees for 10 minutes. PERFECTLY cooked. If you want more medium rare, I'd say only cook 8-9 minutes. Served with a side of Israeli cous cous with tumeric and garlic. We will make this again!

I have made this twice now and am about to enjoy it again...this from someone who never cared much for lamb! The rub is so good I plan to make several packages of it for Christas presents, perhaps tied in rafia and with a little brown paper lamb cutout attached that has the recipe for preparing it. One of my favorite recipes ever.

This was flavorful and easy, and my boyfriend was blown away! I loved the way all of the spices from the rub complimented the sweet heat in the sauce. I'll definitely make it again!!

This was an absolutely perfect dish! I served it at an outdoor party for 12 attendees and everyone loved it. I've had the traditional mint jelly with lamb and enjoyed it, but this mint-mango sauce was phenomenal. Nothing but positive things to say about this one. Thanks for making me look good, Epicurious and Bon Appetit!

My husband couldn't stop gushing about these easy to make lambchops. The spice combination was great.

I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is not necessary, but it definitely adds something special. I blended 1/2 of the mango with the rest of the ingredients, then added the rest in a small dice, along with avocado. Really delicious - would be good with chicken, shrimp, or fish as well. I did the lamb chops in an indoor grill pan b/c it was too hot to grill outside. It worked well. Served with roasted baby potatoes and grilled asparagus. Yum!

Awesome...made rub per recipe and rather than sauce made mango more like a salsa with added fresh grated ginger, cilantro and garlic chives.

The combination of flavors on this recipe are out of this world! Complex with a big after bite. I added chopped avocado to the mint mango sauce as a topping before serving. Beautiful presentation. A hit for anyone who enjoys complex flavors. I've prepared it several times in the past two years. Always a hit!

As DH said, you could put that spice rub on a phone book and grill it, and it would still come out fantastic. LOVE this! In some ways, the mint/mango sauce is almost overkill, because the lamb chops are outstanding just on their own. The sauce is also great, though. I just happened to pick up a pkg of lamb chops at Costco on a whim (haven't made lamb in years) and found this recipe. Now I can't wait to have it again!

That rub was indeed delicious! I added a little garam marsala since I was out of cloves. Being without a grill, I seared the chops over med-high heat for a couple mintues and popped them in the oven for another 10. Served with garlic pearl couscous and roasted figs. A divine weeknight meal that could easily be company-worthy.

Very, very good! I didn't bother with the sauce and served a Mango Chutney I had in the pantry instead. As it turned out, the lamb didn't need the chutney at all - delicious by themselves. These were served with a basic gratin and sauted asparagus.

I have eaten this twice and, like the previous reviewer, I simply don't think the sauce goes with the lamb. The sauce is very similar to the mango mojo (with pork chops) recipe elsewhere on this site, the principal difference being mint vs cilantro, but it goes much better with the pork chops in that recipe than it does with the deliciously spiced lamb chops here.

The spice mixture is absolutely divine! We both ate every morsel and licked our fingers clean. I plan to use this rub on chicken and pork -- the flavors really pop! The sauce was weird and iffy but it was very tasty on grilled shrimp. This was a super-easy, delicious meal and would be perfect for a dinner party or a quick weeknight meal.

This is truly an exceptional way to eat lamb. I've cooked it for several different groups of people and it's never been a miss. The mint-mango sauce is out of this world. Very flavorful, very satisfying.

The best lamb I've had inside a restaurant or out. This could be intimidating for the home cook who doesn't need a buffet to serve 16. Don't let it intimidate you! I eyeballed and guesstimated and brought this down for two small little lamb chops. My tweaks for next time: a little more serrano and/or a little more cayanne. The rub and the sauce is absolutely perfect together. I served with a little wild rice. Very good stuff.

You really should give this recipe a try. We loved this and thought it was as good as a top NYC restaurant main course. Since we had lamb left over, we made it again the next day and still loved it. We don't have access to a grill, but instead pan seared the lamb (coated in the spice mixture and olive oil) until crispy on the outside. Then we put it in the oven until it reached our desired doneness/temperature (medium rare). Even our friend who doesn't enjoy spicy foods is looking forward to the next time we make it for her! We didn't think the mango/mint sauce was necessary since the lamb stood well on its own. But, it was fun to have for a change and was great to have around for our chips the next day.

Fabulous! Didn't have tumeric or cardamon in the house and it still was fantastic. Everything - the rub and the salsa was tremendous. I didn't blend the mango but left it chunky. Smash hit.

My boyfriend made this for me and my teen-aged daughter. It was such a hit I ate the left-overs two days in a row! But don't tell him ok? ;-) A major hit. The combined flavors is over the top fantastic!!!!

This was fantastic. I cooked it up lollipop style using a rack of lamb and just coated one side with the oil and spices. My guests, many of whom are not big lamb eaters, crushed this dish. Super easy and will make again

This recipe is just FABULOUS! I served it in my dinner party and my guest who only eats lamb to be polite to the host, had seconds! He can't believe how he liked it so much!

Served to my family and started with the Spinach Salad with Pear and Avocado recipe. Paired the lamb with the Roasted New Potatoes with Spring Herb Pesto and everyone went crazy over it. The only problem is now I dont know how to top it.

Take the time to cook the chops on the BBQ. I ruined it once using a skillet. You will easily find 1000 uses for the sauce.

This is a fabulous recipe. It is very quick to make - it is nice to have a spice rub that you don't need to sit on the meat beforehand.

Easy to make and incredibly impressive every time - flavors are fantastic, I've made them every summer since 2004

I made this for the first time for friends who are all better cooks than I and received rave reviews! I couldn't have been more pleased.

We've made this recipe several times and the grilled lamb always is delectable. The spice rub is really aromatic and packs quite a zing, but the mint-mango sauce is the perfect cooling counterpart.

I made these lamb chops in the oven and they were still very good. I can only imagine what they'd be like grilled!

I did this last night along with the coriander rice and everybody raved about this. The spice mixture is very unique and the mint-mango sauce refreshing. Next I will try to puree it a little less though, so you see there is mango in it (otherwise it is all bland green!).

I made this for a special dinner and everyone loved it! Will definitely make again. Did not have cardamon or ground cloves, and the spice mixture was just fine without them.

Wow, this was excellent. I used a leg and butterflied it and used frozen mango which was just easier and both turned out. Compliments all around.

My husband put too much spice mixture on the chops. Next time I won't put as much on them -- I will follow the recipe. I had made 1/2 the recipe and only 4 chops. The sauce was good. It is real spicy, or maybe my pepper was extra hot. I have extra sauce and will use it with another dish.
