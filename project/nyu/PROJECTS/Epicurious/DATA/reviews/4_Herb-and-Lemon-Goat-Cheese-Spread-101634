Fantastic! My guests ate it all and asked if I could make more. I will definitely make this again for the next gathering.

I made this for a party tomorrow night and I can't stop "testing" it. It's been in the refrigerator for about 6 hours and the flavors keep getting better and better. The only change I made was to use fresh basil, because that's what I have. Delicious!!!

I brought this over to a friends house last night, it was perfect as an appy after we had all played golf. The spread was light and lemony. I loved the oil mixture on the cheese. From my garden I used fresh chives, dill and tarragon. I added some pitted prune plums and blackberries I picked earlier in the day along with the tomotes and celery. I also rubbed raw garlic, a bit of salt and olive oil to the toasted baguette. I brought half the spread last night to serve 6 and look forward to having the rest today. The fresh herbs tasted like summer and it looked so pretty served on a white platter.

Great party fare! Very easy, and the variations suggested here also sound great - think basil would be amazing.

I took this to a dinner party last night and there wasn't one single lick left after cocktail hour! Wow, is it GOOD! Loved the subtle lemon flavor. I used Greek oregano since I had it in my garden and it was delicious; also gorgeous as a garnish with a lemon twist. I did add about 1/4 cup of marscapone to tone down the goat cheese a bit. Would probably even up that to 1/2 a cup next time. Didn't feel like dealing with toasting baguette slices, so I served it with two different types of super sturdy crackers. Yum.

Excellent! And so easy too. Our guests really enjoyed this. I made it exactly as written. I look forward to trying basil another time. This just might be my new go-to appetizer.

So simple and delicious. Added lemon thyme fresh from the garden. Mixed all of the thyme and lemon zest into the cheese added a little oil for a smooth consistency. Do add freshly ground pepper and some sea salt. Served on grilled crostini with rave reviews.

This is a wonderful spread. I used fresh basil in place of the thyme and loved it. Also took another reviewer's suggestion and served it with Melba rounds which are sturdy enough to stand up to the consistancy of the spread. A real keeper!

Easy and delicious! I combined the ingredients and let sit overnight. Used about 3 or 3 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil to make it, added a little bit more when I served it. It was a hit! Couldn't be easier. Great with sun-dried tomato baguette slices, peppers, and cucumbers.

Fantastic for how fast and easy it is. I am one of those who finds goat cheese "a little much" so I added 2 tsp. chopped fresh mint and one 8 oz. container mascarpone cheese to a doubled recipe. It was delicious.

Ditto all the other 3 and 4 fork reviewers. A really delicious appetiser that travels well. I mixed all the ingredients together, put it in a nice dish, grabbed a box of pita crisps and took it sailing. Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe, which I happily recited. This is something I will make again and again.

This mixture of flavors is fantastic! I make this appetizer regularly and it is always the first dish people finish at a party. I use a little less olive oil than called for and often stir together the ingredients instead of pouring the olive oil mixture over top. Tastes great either way!

Excellent - everyone loved it!! I could eat the whole thing myself.

This is DELICIOUS!!! It also looks very pretty on the serving dish. I don't even toast the baguette - the cheese is so good by itself, the bread is fine as is (for me). I have had to double or triple it every time, as it gets devoured...delicious!

I took this to a friend's house recently....it was literally gone in about 10 minutes, with only 4 of us eating it! Anyway, her husband requested that I give her the recipe, and I felt slightly guilty when I confessed that it only took a couple minutes to make and was simple enough that I had memorized the recipe. I would say this recipe is the PERFECT last minute rescue.

I LOOOOOVE this recipe. Make it the day before you serve and the flavors will get absorbed in to the cheese! If you mix all the herb garlic mixture into it and skip the oil it works great as a spread on finger sandwiches- spread on bread with a layer of sliced or grated cucumber like you would for cream cheese cucumber sandwiches. You will wow your guests!!!

Very tasty; a big hit, even with kids. I thought there was too much oil on top; I'll use about half the amount next time.

What a wonderful, refreshing hors d'oeuvres! I have even made it with fresh cilantro (when I couldn't get any fresh thyme) and still got rave reviews!! I have served it with raw vegetables and another time crackers and another sliced baguettes. This one's definitely a keeper....

Excellent for transporting to a party. Quick, easy and impressive. Make sure you have a nice thick cracker or biscuit as the spread is quite thick.

I would use a softer cheese next time. The quality was great but it was naturally cured with its own rind and it was a bit more crumbly than I would have liked. Great herbs with it though.

I only used 2 tsp of the olive oil and that was plenty; the cheese was so lovely and soft, the extra oil just wasn't needed. This one got LOTS of compliments--I hated to reveal how easy it was!

I took this to a party and it was devoured. I served it with the toasted baguette slices on a bed of endive. I will definitely make it again.

I made this last night and just made another batch, which gives you some idea of how popular it was. (Four of us devoured it, not eight.) Given how easy it is and how nice it tastes, it's definitely a good reason to have a log of goat cheese in the refrigerator.

I made this to serve at a party I was having. It was so quick and easy to make. It received great reviews, and I really enjoyed it, as well.

This was lovely. I added more grated lemon peel than called for in the recipe because it gave it such a light, fresh flavor. After topping with the herbed oil, I served it on a small bed of baby arugula and garnished with long strips of lemon zest. Beautiful. Next time I'll skip toasting the baguette slices, I think the lighter texture of untoasted baguettes seems more complimentary to this spread -- even crackers would be better. Very, very delicious.

The fresh thyme I got was way too strong and overpowered the dish. One guest thought it had horseradish in it. It looked very nice on the endive and peppers, but the taste was not light and clean like I expected.

This was very flavorful and refreshing. I was serving a heavy main course and needed something light for my guests to munch on with cocktails. I served with the toasted baguette slices and with celery sticks. Presents beautifully and goes quickly.

I was asked to bring the hors d'oeuvre for dinner with friends and we all practically licked the plate! So delicious and super easy. Looked pretty on small bed of mixed greens surrounded by the baguette slices.

This one's a standard in our house! It's popular (my sister-in-law insists I serve it often), delicious, a make-ahead dish, and it goes with anything you have on hand ... crackers, toasted baguette slices, etc. To keep the carbs down, we've used the mixture as a stuffing for cherry tomatoes and snow peas (labor intensive but so pretty), spread on cucumber or red and yellow bell pepper slices, etc. Be generous with the fresh thyme!

A very tasty appetizer for those who LOVE rich goat cheese. I would use a little less garlic next time as it overpowered the lemon and thyme - although, granted, my cloves of garlic were extraordinarily huge. If you're going to be less than 4 people, divid the ball in half and save one for the next day - it's even better once the flavors have had a chance to mix!

Very beautiful presentation. I added some cream cheese to reduce the "goat-taste". Make sure you use fresh thyme and season it with a lot of ground pepper. I also used some more oil than written. The cheese is easily shaped into a ball with lightly-oiled hands.

Mmmm. My oink-o-meter tipped off the scale there for a while. I think I ate most of it. Very good, pretty with the oil and herb drizzle. Even my Nothing Goat For Me Husband liked it.

Very interesting, but tasty dish. Light and refreshing flavors. Would definitely make this again as a party appetizer. Didn't really care for it with the endive, though I think really good crackers or toasted baguette slices would be much better. To stretch it out (goat cheese is a little pricey), I added some cream cheese to it, and this worked perfectly fine flavor-wise. The lemon peel really gives this dish a refreshing twist. Note: Fellow epicureans, remember it's your duty to return to post your reviews after trying recipes! Helps out a lot! :) Bon Appetit!

Seems that there are two kinds of people in the world...those who love goat cheese and those who would not touch it with a barge pole. For goat cheese lovers, this is a fabulous recipe. It is simple, pretty and delicious. It also doubles easily. I will definitely make it again (and again).

This recipe is SO easy! The presentation is very sophisticated (with the oil) and it tastes terrific. Use lots of ground pepper.

This is a really easy spread to make and it really adds flavor to ordinary bland goat cheese. I didn't serve it with the oil and herbs over the top - I just mixed everything together. Turned out nicely and my guests ate it all!

This is an easy-to-do make ahead-of-time recipe. Great finger food with a glass of Pastis. Make sure to use fresh thyme. By the way, the reader who spelled "definately" incorrectly is from Montreal, perhaps not a native English speaker so let's cut him/her some slack.

The amount of praise my guests had for this appetizer far outweighs the meager amount of time required to prepare this. This is a keeper!

Sarabeth, you ARE neurotic..... Save it for work; this is a cooking website.

Someone suggested substituting cream cheese. Mais Oui! I've been making this for many years. Many years ago when my husband brought back a fabulous cheese from Paris called BOURSIN avec fines herbs. It was not available where we were living here in the U.S., so I decided to improvise and make my own. I used cream cheese, garlic, lemon juice, parsley and fresh ground black pepper. Couldn't tell the difference and the homemade version is so much more cost effective. So if you don't really like goat cheese, this is one you will like.

I apologize deeply for being off-topic, but some of us just do too much copy-editing for a living to let this go...if anyone cares, the word 'definately' is a mis-spelling of DEFINITELY. Seems to be a very common mistake, at least on this website. Again, I apologize for the neurosis.

Very easy, very fast, very good. For those that aren't goat cheese fans - the lemon quiets the taste. For those that love goat cheese, the lemon is a fun surprise. I'll definately make this again.
