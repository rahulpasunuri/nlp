I used orange zest as the other reviews suggested but the sauce was weird; the red onion was bitter and the salty capers and olives clashed with the sweet oranges.

I took some shortcuts (used canned, diced tomatoes and juice, jug orange juice, kept the olives (mixed) and capers whole, and pulled the rosemary of the stem, but kept it intact). I also used a cast iron skilled, no oil/spray needed. I cooked one big piece of fish (a bit over a pound), and just sectioned it when it was time to serve. Wonderful and easy recipe. Light, flavorful and beautiful.

I made this with fresh Ling Cod from New Zealand and it was fantastic. I used only one orange, grated the zest (instead of strips) and did not add the extra orange juice. I simply squeezed the juice from the orange and then chopped the remaining orange solids. Used shallot instead of red onion and added some sliced kalamatas in addition to the 1 tbsp. of minced olives. It needed very little salt to boost the flavors of the sauce and the only other thing I would do differently is to pour the sauce over the fish and return to the hot oven for 1 to 2 minutes to heat the sauce a little. The flavors of the orange, olive, citrus and rosemary are perfectly complimentary. It really brought a lot of zing to a meaty but relatively flavorless fish.

We liked this very much and did not find the sauce bitter. Perhaps when cutting the orange rind, care must be taken not to add any of the white matter b/w the skin and the pulp for this is the source of the bitterness in the sauce. In France, we have a tool which just slices the skin, leaving the bitter rind.

I would give this 21/2 forks if I could, overall it was really good. Next time, I will go with my gut though and use a grater for the orange zest and add more lemon zest to give it a less sweet taste, the peals were overwhelming. I also omitted the OJ and I added the sauce to the fish while it cooked for the last 5 minutes so that the flavors would better mingle. I cooked it with a nice home mande pasta. The cod was okay, next time I think catfish or tilapia might be better (less bones).

This was just okay in my book. Try Sauteed Cod Provencale ...it's better.

Very nice. I used talapia, a very affordable fish readily available in South Florida. To avoid any bitter orange taste, I did the following because the directions are vague...first peeled the orange with a vegtable peeler and only took off the zest (only orange part) and slice that according to directions. No need to blanch, they add a lovely touch to the fish. Next I used a sharp knife to cut off the white pith, down to fleshy fruit, then I used small paring knife to cut through each section to only get orange, removed seeds and let juice drip into bowl. I did not add the additional orange juice. Turned out really nice and will make again.

OK, so I changed this. I never made it by the recipe so can't compare, but it was very good, I left out the orange juice and instead of chopped tomato used 1/2 cup of my homemade spaghetti sauce. I put the sauce over the fish (didn't do the orange peel thing) lowered the temp to 425 degrees and baked it for 15 minutes. The kids even liked it. Hi Cook from Frederick, MD

I chose this recipe because I actually had all of the ingredients on hand. The cod was delicious, but the sauce didn't add much. If I make this in the future, I think I'll eliminate the orange juice and make it more of a salsa and less of a sauce. The sauce was so thin that it did not really hang together.

The fish was fine. I found the orange peel too bitter (even tho I did blanch as other reviewers suggested) and the salsa tasted peculiar. Too many capers for my taste? I followed the recipe, with the exception of leaving out the orange juice and substituting shallots for red onion. There are so many better salsas and sauces for baked fish.

Update! I had forgotten how refreshing this is. Made it again tonight & husband said it was REALLY good. And I could make this again anytime. Lo carbs, good fat---easy--This was certainly a nice change of pace for us. Made the salsa early in the day & warmed it before serving. Served the fish on a bed of dill basmati rice. Very light. Very good.

I like really spicy food and this was too sweet and not spicy/flavorful enough for me. Those who like blander food may enjoy it though; it was edible, just not spectacular.

Pleasant and easy, but nothing earth-shattering. I think you could leave out the orange juice, and like a previous poster I used dry rosemary. A nice summer dish since it is light.

Refreshing change for us. Next time I will use more lemon and olives, but very good as is (didn't have fresh rosemary, which didn't matter). I made the full salsa recipe for only 2 people, and we almost finished it! Toasted pine nuts in the rice added another good flavor. Will definately make it again.

My husband LOVED this. I just liked it. Next time I make it, I'm going to cut the onion and olives in larger pieces, and I'm not going to chop the capers at all, because the dominant taste by far was orange. I think I'd like it better if the other flavours were more assertive.

Rating: 3
Light, easy, and wonderfully flavorful. I admit that I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not the salsa would really pull together well, but all of the flavors--from the fish to the capers to the oranges--blended together beautifully but were also still distinct. Plus, other than the fresh rosemary and olives, I had all of the ingredients on hand. Just picked up the herbs and olives when I bought the fish. Like other reviewers, I blanced the orange rinds too which made them soft and very edible. Two thumbs up!

Didn't have an orange so I used a Meyer lemon. Worked out great! Fish was moist and salsa was delicious on both the fish and the rice I made to accompany it. Definitely a keeper.

First, let me say, I changed a few things. I didn't have an orange, also I used green olives with pimentos instead of black. Great reviews on the pimentos in particular. Sauce was beautiful and the fish was tender and very mild. A little too mild for my taste, but my boyfriend ate it all, and he's not a big fish eater. I served with asparagus and rice. I would make this again, but probably only as a weekday meal,it is very quick, and only for us, not guests.

I am a Caterer from Newbury, MA. I have used this receipe about 15 times each time it gets raved reviews whether it is from a client or a dinner party for friend in my home. I changed the cod to haddock. If you keep the sauce at room temp. it does not cool down the fish when you serve it. ADDENDUM: In reponse to April from Columbus, Ohio, I blanch the orange strips it makes them pliable and takes the bitter taste out

Easy and tasty. However, the orange pieces remained a little membrane-y. Maybe I did something wrong. Served with polenta and asparagus.

I would give this recipe a 3.5. It was extremely simple to prepare, tasty, and light. It would be great for entertaining as the sause has a wonderful color and flavor. I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, which I don't suggest. The texture of the dried herb did not blend well with the sauce. Cod is my new favorite fish next to sea bass which is now over fished (Please stay away from sea bass so we can eat it again one day) Thanks!

This was a very tasty dish. I liked the mild flavor of the cod and so did the kids. The sauce is really terrific; it will become my new fish sauce.

I've made this twice with cod and both times I made the sauce ahead of time (around two) and let it sit at room temperature with excellent results. I agree that the sauce could be used with different fish, but we thought the cod was perfect and it was neither too salty nor rubbery. Like another reviewer, I have served asparagus and rice.

Rating: 3
Great sauce, I agree with the person who suggested using another fish, my cod was not up to par sort of rubbery in fact. Make sauce ahead and let the flavors blend. I could also see this sauce served on any type of pork, or even baked chicken.

I would make this recipe again but I would use Orange Roughy or Sole. Although cod is a mild fish it was still a little fishy for our taste. I made it for two for Easter dinner. (there wasn't a ham small enough!) The presentation was beautiful and [even despite the semi-fishy taste] the flavors blended quite well. I made green beans with a bacon vinigrette, deviled eggs, and some rolls on the side. Try this, you'll like it.

Served with white rice, the dish is tasty and satisfying!

I thought this was disgusting. I followed suggestions of other reviewers, to make ahead of time, and heat up before placing on the cod. Possibly making the sauce into a puree and cooking it with the cod?....

Very tasty and a great refreshing summertime dinner. I wish I would have first read the review er who suggested making the sauce ahead of time. Also, next time I will probably heat the sauce a bit. The fish cools down too fast as soon as you spoon the sauce onto it.

My girlfriend loved it....and it was very easy to prepare. I served it with wild and white rice mixed along with steamed asparagus.

My family was never crazy about fish -- until I tried this recipe, that is. Amazing! I shared the recipe with my mom (who lives in the US) right after dinner! I agree that the sauce needs to be made ahead of time. Also, keep in mind that this dish is quite "light" -- for a full meal, add a salad or a side dish.

Nice flavors, make sure to make sauce ahead of time to blend flavors. Also, I would add seasoned breadcrumbs and bake with maelted butter underneath cod.

Excellent flavor. The sauce really adds to the dish. Certainly worth doing again
