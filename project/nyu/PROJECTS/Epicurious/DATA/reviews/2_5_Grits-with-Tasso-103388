This recipe is great. The only thing i added was i pan fried the tasso in a pad of butter to get some juices rendered and poured it all into the grits.

Texture was odd--the grits were creamy and smooth with little chewy bits of sausage. Basically not that good for all the calories involved. I didn't have a deep fat fryer. Using one might help.
