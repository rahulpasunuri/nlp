I agree with the other reviewers who said that this recipe is good, but it's nothing special. It is, at least, quick and easy.

This is an excellent, easy weeknight dinner. Made this for two (with ample lunch leftovers for the next day) but cooked the amount of sauce for 6 per the recipe, halved the amount of pasta and shrimp. We liked the extra sauce. I did not bake the pasta, but rather added sauce with shrimp to pasta, added extra feta, basil and parsley and served immediately. I used 3 cloves of garlic. Would consider removing shrimp tails prior to cooking for ease of eating A definite weeknight staple, but absolutey suitable for company.

This recipe was wonderful. The combination of the thick pasta and light sauce was perfect. Very easy to make.

So easy and wonderful flavors...although I added extra feta just because I love the flavor...also made it with chicken...

I thought this dish was just delicious. I didn't bake it though. When the shrimp were cooked through in the saute pan, I added feta cheese and shredded fresh basil. Very simple and so tasty. My husband loved it.

This recipe was great. I served it to 4 people and everyone was raving about it. I would definitely make it again and it did not take long to prepare (40 minutes tops).

This was average... I didn't feel like spending the money on shrimp so I so I added chicken instead. But it was so simple to make after work. I love the feta in the sauce. Next time I think I will add some mushrooms and veggies.

I thought this was bland. I put raw shrimp to bake. Cooked perfectly. A much better shrimp with feta is Craig Claibournes. I just serve it over angelhair.

Great dish. Quick, easy and tasty! Taking a cue from another reviewer, I whisked a touch of butter into the sauce, and went a step further and added about a Tbs of fat-free half & half. These additions really smooth out the flavors on the palate. My husband & I both agreed...this dish would be even better without the shrimp, as it added no appreciable flavor, and interfered with the overall texture to the dish. Will make again!

Delicious and easy. It reminds us of something my cousins made for us in Italy. Thanks to the others for the advice on adding the shrimp raw- it was not overcooked.

I have made this recipe twice, once with a dab of butter (as suggested by Ethea from Fremont, CA), once without, and the butter does make it smoother in flavor. Also, I had to make it a day ahead this last time, and it tasted better. The extra day must have given the sauce a chance to blend with the pasta. I will make it a day ahead from now on.

Although this was very easy, the overall flavour was unexceptional unless you use a ton of shrimp. Perhaps some fresh veggies might give it a boost. Followed another reviewer's tip on not pre-cooking the shrimp, great advice!

This dish is very close to a meal I enjoyed in Santorini. I agree that you should add the shrimp raw to the baking dish. Sauteed spinach is a nice side.

Excellent but does it need to be baked? My husband and I love the recipe for chicken in a tomato feta cheese sauce and this is a close second.

Rating: 3
Delicious! My guests raved over it and begged for the recipe. The key to not overcooking the shrimp is: don't cook it in the sauce. If you stir the raw shrimp into the combined pasta/sauce mixture, just before baking, they get cooked in the oven and are tender. I made 2X the sauce, as I like my pasta a bit saucier and wanted some available to serve on the side.

This dish is quick, easy, and delicious!!! I've also made it with chicken. Certainly worth cooking!

Very good. Next time we will use a little more cheese...perhaps mix another variety with the feta. I also may not use quite as much pasta as the recipe calls for. We like sauce!

Very good! I didn't know how much red pepper flakes to use, so I tried 1/2 teas. We like things quite spicy, so I think I'll try a little more next time. If you like this recipe, try Penne with Tomatoes, Olives and Two Cheeses sometime. It too is very good.

This was easy and flavorful. I added a sprinkling of parmesan to the top which browned beautifully. Perfect for 4 or 5 people. I agree, be careful not to overcook the shrimp.

I bake it at 425'. Even my kids like it (which is saying something about a shrimp dish).

This recipe was simple to prepare and the ingredients for most would be readily at hand. I increased the amount of almost everything: one onion chopped, 3 cloves of garlic, one teaspoon each of basil and oregano, and probably at least 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes ( I don't always use measuring spoons). I used the suggested three cans of tomatoes but I increased the amount of white wine to nearly a cup and reduced it all for about 15 minutes, finishing it with about a tablespoon of butter before adding the shrimp. I used garlic and herb feta cheese along with freshly grated parmesan: 4 oz. feta and 1 oz. parmesan and then sprinkled the top with parmesan only. It was yummy!

This is a GREAT recipe. I used chevre which to me is a little smoother. I was also careful not to overcook pasta. It softens further in the baking. I also had a few scallops which worked too. Just be careful to add just before baking so as not to get too tough. My husband really liked the flavor. I'm adding it to my recipe box.

This was a very easy and tasty dish to make. I am used to having more complexity in the sauce, but this was a nice change...almost seemed too easy. I would be careful not to overcook the shrimp

Made this dish over the weekend and loved it! I was only cooking for 2 so I 1/2 the recipe and it still came out wonderful. I added zucchini and yellow squash. I think I may use this as a side dish by keeping the veggies and omiting the shrimp.

This recipe was great. I added shrimp and lobster and it was outstanding.

This receipe was very good and I would definately make it again. It would be good for company; it was easy to assemble,and was good reheated the next day.

This was so super-quick, and the idea of adding feta to pasta has spilled over into a myriad of other dishes! Tasted even better as a cold salad the next day!

Excellent, good combination of shrimp, sharp, and smooth cheese flavors. The pasta soaked up the juice from the sauce and the whole thing would have become a little too solid if I hadn't been more than generous with the sauce. The feta and the red peppers are the key. Some fennel or anise (1 tsp fennel, 1/8 tsp anise!) when cooking the onions makes a nice addition. Delicious with a fresh fruit salad.

I thought this was very full and deliscious recipe. Do not hesitate to add a bit of red pepper. It gives it a small boost. Also, if you didn't have shrimp, think about adding zuchinni, mushrooms, and other vegatables. The sauce and the feta work well together.

Quite tasty and favorful. My only suggestion is to add more than the 34 shrimp called for. A hearty and satisfying meal!

Delicious! Easy to make...I used frozen shrimp to save time and added at the last minute before baking. My fussy teenaged boys loved it. Also looks very pretty in an oval baking dish.
