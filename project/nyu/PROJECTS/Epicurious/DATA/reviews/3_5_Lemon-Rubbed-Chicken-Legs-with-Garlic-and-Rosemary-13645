This will be repeated many times I'm sure. So easy. I brined the legs overnight in a rosemary sea salt brine, then allowed them to dry out for several hours in the fridge prior to beginning the recipe. I replaced the water with low-sodium chicken broth. The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce sooo delicious.

Terrific and very easy dinner. Adults and kids loved it. Definitely use white wine instead f water if you can as it adds another dimension to the sauce. Will definitely add to my monthly family meals.

Easy and delicious. Cut down the covered cooking time to about 20 min. Use a little more garlic. Add white wine to the "drizzle" and toss with some cooked spaghetti. Serve with some grated parmesan cheese.

Wow. I just made this for a quick and easy dinner. It was so flavorful. All of the family including my picky kids really liked it. I tripled the recipe and like previous review deglazed the pan with wine instead of water.

Whoa! This dish is amazing. I have loved this incredible recipe for about 10 years now -- probably my 3rd all-time favorite on epicurious, after the wine-baked halibut steaks and Gordon's pot roast. This dish is easy and so delicious -- I dream of it often. Finding whole legs with the skin on is worth the trouble and extra calories, at least for the first time -- it really is memorably simple and delicious. Highly recommended with some lemony grilled vegetables, such as asparagus.

This is so easy. I usually put four legs in a pan and make a more traditional gravy w/the drippings. It's become a staple around here.

delicious and easy! I sauteed some whole wheat pasta in the pan and served it as a side dish. Yum!

I just used chicken drumsticks and it was pretty good. I don't really like eating chicken on the bone, so I doubt I will make it again for that reason. I didn't have any fresh lemon or rosemary on hand, which I'm sure would have improved the meal dramatically.

I really like this recipe-I've made it a bunch. The recipe as written as great but here are a couple of ideas to change it up that I like. I think the idea of sauteeing it with the citris juice is really great. My other ideas are-Once I added some honey to the finishing sauce-and made it more of a glaze (this is my boyfriends favorite way). Tonight I used limes instead of lemons, omitted the rosemary and added honey and hot sauce at the end. Another ideas is using thyme instead of rosemary. Just depends what I have on hand. I love how versatile this recipe is.

Very easy and yummy. Don't need a full tablespoon of rosemary (1/4 Tbs suffices). Also good with breasts instead of legs.

Not that tasty, and the chicken was overcooked at 30 minutes.

What an easy and delicious dish! I served it with rice. I will definitely make it again. It's great for weeknights.

Mmmm, mmmm, mmm. Very good and easy (although messy, agreed). Used white wine instead of water, definitely a must!

I made this last night with four chicken leg quarters. I marinated the chicken legs in lemon juice for about an hour, then added the marinade after browning. After 30 minutes, I removed the chicken and added rosemary and garlic and reduced the sauce. It wasn't thickening much so I strained out the rosemary and garlic and added a little flour, white wine, and chicken stock to the sauce. It made a lemony, rich sauce that I served over creamy mashed potatoes. A note to the cooks who think they're making a recipe more "healthy" by removing fat: you're not making it more healthy. Fat does not equal unhealthy - fat equals flavor. Leave the skin on. The chicken turned out juicy and tender. This was wonderful and I will make it again.

I have made this several times, with all sorts of poultry. It's a great recipe and very delicious. Be generous with the rosemary. I also tried making it with a little honey. Once baked, it makes a very nice glaze. Delicious and highly recommended!

Okay healthy version was attempted with two large boneless skinless breasts and marinated for 30min. For the gravy instead of just water I saved some water from the water I used for mashed potatoes to give it some more starch.Def. need to turn up the heat at the end to brown breasts! It was a well recieved.

This is a great weeknight dinner. I made it with chicken breasts and it worked out fine.

Super easy, and the kind of recipe you're likely to be able to make with whats already in the pantry. I used vermouth instead of the water. Tasty.

I thought this recipe was okay at best. I didn't think it had a whole lot of flavor. The chicken was very tender and fell off the bone but I prefer bolder flavors. This dish was easy to make but still not worth the effort and clean up from frying the chicken.

Very tasty! The gravy was thin, but the chicken was delicious.

I made this for dinner last night with stuff I had around the house. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used Lemon Thyme and Savory from my garden. It was quick and easy for a Tuesday night dinner. I used the wine and chicken broth combo and my husband said it was ok. He said the wine made it too rich for his tastebuds but would want it again with just the broth. I'll try it again.

Very good recipe. Simple, quick, needing few ingredients. It's become a regular at our diner table. I also use wine in the sauce instead of water. And I a bit more rosemary.

This is a great summertime dish! No oven, no extra heat in the house.The flavors are wonderful & it was a hit with the kids. I used chicken thighs & they worked great, too. We will be having this again at our house.

Being up at the lake, I don't have access to a printer. Yet. So I wrote the recipe down. Missed rubbing the chicken with lemon. I think next time I will finish this in the oven. Throwing the oven cleaning switch is much easier than wiping my walls! All in all---oven roasted lemon rosmary chicken is much easier cooking & cleaning. And just as good, if not better. Still have crispy skin (if that's what you like :))

This dish was so easy, absolutely delicious and super low fat with the modifications that I used. First I used 6 skinless chicken legs (all the fat is in the skin - you won't miss the skin this way I promise!). I marinated them all day in lemon juice, rosemary and a table spoon of dijon mustard. To cook them, I lightly sprayed the pan with olive oil and sauteed the chicken legs with garlic for 5 minutes. They were nicely browned. Then I added a mixture of 1/4 cup of chicken broth, 1/4 cup of white wine, the rest of the marinade and an extra pinch of rosemary. I covered the pan and let it simmer for 30 minutes. It formed the most amazing rich sauce. The chicken was so tender it just fell off the bone. We served this with the Oven Roasted Vegetables with Garlic on this site. I also added potatoes to the vegie dish. The vegies were the perfect compliment to the chicken and sauce. My husband mopped up the rest of the sauce with some bread - he couldn't let it go to waste!

I made this dish tonight and everyone in my family enjoyed it. The chicken was moist and tender with nicely browned skin and the sauce was delicious. I doubled the recipe and used half wine and half water for the sauce. We all agreed this is a "keeper". Simple, economical and tasty!

Delicious, easy recipe. Make sure you get the chicken really brown to make the most of the sauce at the end. Creates a wonderful smell of lemon and rosemary. Good with rice or roasted small red potatoes and salad.

I going to make this recipe for the 5th time. Fast with great flavor. I agree on the wine as better to deglaze pan.

This chicken dish is perfect for times when you don't have too many ingredients on hand. Using white wine instead of water to deglaze adds a tremendous amount of flavor, and the slow cooking produces falling-off-the-bone tenderness!

I didn't have a whole lemon and just substituted lemon juice, and I don't think I used enough because the glaze at the end didn't turn out quite right. Otherwise, though, the chicken was very good.

I've made this many times and it's quite delicious. I use white wine instead of water to deglaze for a little extra flavor. The chicken is tender and the lemon/garlic/rosemary enhances it wonderfully.
