Made this as the main dish for a Vegetarian Thanksgiving. It was a hit! The combination of flavors is outstanding. It's warm and filling and great!

I wanted to eat meat today, so I added organic sausage meat to the veggie mix, as well as mushrooms and some fresh herbs. Since I have so much swiss chard in the garden and hate to waste, I replaced the onion with the swiss chard stems, cut up very small and caramelized. I added parmesan to the polenta instead of mozzarella and used fresh mozzarina to top. Its so good!!!

Made this with 1 1/2 times the swiss chard and a swiss/gruyere blend instead of the mozzarella. delicious and easy. also cooked the polenta with 4 cups chicken broth - whisking constantly for a creamy texture. No trouble with it not setting up as others mentioned.

This tastes just great. I thought I didn't like chard, but I loved this. YES, it will be soupy unless you bake the heck out of it. It will also set up nicely if you let it get all the way to room temp before serving, and in fact it's probably best to treat it as a make-ahead dish. But even if yours comes out runny, think of it as a pudding and you'll be fine.

Thought this was incredibly easy and a perfect warm winter meal. I had all ingredients except for ricotta, so I used 2% plain greek yogurt instead (Fage). A gamble, but it totally paid off, turned out delicious! And it seems like it might be healthier that way anyway. In any case, I loved it. Will definitely make it again and might try adding more veggies to the mix.

This does take time, but it's worth it! The list of common ingredients come together to create a great dish. I live at altitude, and found it took less time for the polenta, and for the dish to bake. Will def. make again - followed the recipe exactly.

Made exactly as directed, except eggbeaters instead of eggs. Although time consuming, very, very good! I've made it a few times now and haven't had a problem with it staying together. I topped it with a marinara sauce, and it is a perfect vegetarian meal!

Cooked polenta in chicken stock -- would've used veggie if we'd had it -- added sauteed mushrooms and substituted chard for kale on hand. Cooking times seemed accurate. Most important to cook liquids out of veggies before baking. Quite tasty!

I made a few changes to the recipe. Based on prior experience, I cooked the polenta in white wine and chicken broth, and I added bell pepper, red grapes, and parmesan to the mixture. I also stirred everything together instead of layering. It was a good, tasty weeknight dinner.

This had decent flavor, but I wasn't as impressed as everyone else. I don't think I cooked the polenta long enough, but it definitely was not runny or soggy. Decent texture, but it was lacking the flavor that I was expecting... I will definitely try again, but add some sausage as others had. I used chicken stock instead of water and will repeat this too.

Rating: 1
I followed this recipe exactly, and it was extremely runny. Not at all appetizing. Even if the texture had been perfect, the dish really lacked flavor. I agree with another reviewer--this was a waste of chard. It definitely needs some altering in order to be a moderately successful dish.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe three times now, each time altering it slightly, with good results each time. The reason for three forks, not four, is because I still can't figure out how to get the finished product to be more in pie form, and not runny. First time: Made exactly as recipe suggests, utilizing some other reviewers comments to make sure the chard has been stripped of all its liquid. We had great results, the flavor was excellent. Second time: I added crumbled turkey sausage, used a combination of shallots and onion, added more pepper flakes, added grated parmesan to the polenta as it cooked, as well as more ricotta. By far the tastiest of the three times. Third time: I stopped eating meat, so this time around I used tofu in place of the sausage. Flavor was great, but this was the runniest of the bunch, so next time I won't use tofu. I also should note that I double the amount of chard called for because I find that there is never enough for the second layer, plus the dish is heavy and the introduction of more vegetables adds more depth to it. The other thing I've run into is that it doesn't take 15 minutes to saute the onions, so often the vegetables are ready before the polenta. This results in the chard mixture getting way too soft and wilted. If you can perfect the dish to have it result in a more typical baked casserole/pie, I would give it four stars, because the flavor is really outstanding.

Wow, how tasty is this? VERY straight- forward and easy recipe. I added sauteed mushrooms, shallot, swiss and parmesan on top of the recipe, and I HIGHLY recommend adding more sauteed veggies. I also cooked the cornmeal with vegetable broth, and the key seems to be to get as much moisture out of the ingredients before baking. This means watching the cornmeal closely and cooking it til all extraneous moisture is gone. Also, I don't see any reason to cover the swiss chard as it cooks, you want as much moisture to leave as possible. One last recommendation is to bake it until it really browns on the top, like in the picture. This could take closer to an hour depending on your oven. Enjoy! This, like lasagna like others have mentioned, accepts lots of flavorful seasoning and veggies, and I highly recommend doing so!

I made this last night, it was wonderful! I didn't have ricotta or mozzarella cheese. I used labneh (middle eastern yogurt spread) and monterey jack cheese. Followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. Served with spicy grilled shrimp, but it would make a filling main dish.

I love this recipe. It is the 2nd time I've made it. I did it exactly as the recipe called for and it came out very well. Like another reviewer, I used yellow cornmeal and it thickened very well, no problem with it being runny. A great use of my exuberant rainbow chard patch.

This recipe is forgiving. I didn't have ricotta, so I used feta. It worked very well (omitted the salt with the polenta). I also used a pecornio in place of the mozzarella. It was quite tasty. My polenta looked very runny, so I cooked it for a while after I had added the egg and feta. It firmed up well in about 10 minutes, and I had no problem with the end result being runny at all. It held together nicely. Oh, I also had an accident with the crushed pepper, and added close to a 1/2 of a tablespoon. It was quite hot! I would not do that again, though I think it could use more than 1/4 of a tsp.

Made the polenta with chicken broth instead of water & that made it flavorful. The polenta never really firmed up though, so spreading a 2nd layer on top of the chard & mozzarella layers was a bit difficult & messy. The dish WAS better the second day after being in the refrigerator. I noticed that the "toppings" (chard/onions & mozzarella) had a tendency to slide off the polenta (almost like toppings sliding off pizza dough), so you end up eating a mouthful of flavorful toppings & then mouthful of plain polenta. Good, but not really worth the effort.

Didn't have and good swiss chard at the store, so I used arugula instead. My polenta came out a little liquidy, but the flavors were nice. A good vegetarian dish.

Rating: 3
Tasty! I made sure the onions got fairly caramelized before adding any greens. I substituted spinach and rocket for the chard and also added some bacon. They all worked great together and added a lot of flavor to the polenta. A good dish to have for weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
Very good! This is essentially a lasagna with no tomato sauce and polenta substituted for the pasta. I imagine you could pair the polenta with different cheeses and vegetable/meat layers. Next time I may try adding some of my favorite vegetable like eggplant, squash, or even corn to bring out the polenta taste. I used fat free ricotta and fat free cheese, and while they taste boring on their own, they tasted fine in this dish...made it not too heavy and actually quite healthy! Easy, versatile, yum!

Very tasty. I added parmesan cheese and used whole milk mozzarella. I didn't have garlic so I left that out. The dish was very creamy and flavorful, and rather easy to make. I'll try low-fat cheese next time.

great recipe....but a little suggestion, i love substituting corn flakes the polenta. much crispier! and much more nutritious (vitamin B12 and D! yum yum! definitely a try!

Something of a let down. It was definitely comfort foody, but it was quite bland. It was a waste of good chard. If I make it again (if), I'll definitely use better, more flavorful cheese, like maybe a smoked gouda. I'll also use more veggies.

Rating: 3
This was a great way to use up some leftover chard. I halved the recipe and put it in a pie dish instead of a larger casserole. Worked very well. I used yellow cornmeal and noticed that my polenta formed almost instantly (definitely not 10 minutes to stir). This is almost quiche like (especially in the pie dish) would be good for a brunch.

I've made this twice, and although I've had good reviews, my husband still thinks it needs more flavor. I made the polenta in a double boiler (as recommended by another reviewer). While it was cooking (and I was stirring) I added about half a cup of graded romano/pecorini cheese and about 1 tablespoon of "Better than Boullion" (chicken). I let the polenta cook (steam) for 15 minutes, then added 1 tblsp paprika and a bit of red pepper flakes. Meanwhile, I sauteed the onion in olive oil, over low heat for nearly 30 minutes, until the onions were caramelized and sweet. Then I added the minced garlic and one pound of RED swiss chard (which is sweeter than the other chards...and I didn't bother with removing the stems). I cooked this on low, covered, for another 30 minutes until the chard had fully wilted. While the polenta and chard were cooking, I mixed together 2 c. part-skim ricotta cheese, 2 eggs, 8 oz. grated low-fat mozarella cheese, 2 ounces of chevre (goat's cheese) and about 1/3 c. romano/pecorino. When the chard was done, I put it in a mesh strainer and pressed on it with a spoon to eliminate as much liquid as I could. I covered the bottom of an oiled 2-quart round baking dish with half the polenta mix. Then I added a layer of the chard, followed by a layer of half the cheese mix. I repeated the layering and let it sit for 20 minutes before baking at 350 for 50 minutes. After baking, I let it sit for half an hour (to cool down and set). Then I covered it and put it in the refrigerator. I served it the next day. My version wasn't at all runny. When I served it, it sliced like a well-formed pie. When I make this again, I'd add some more red pepper to the polenta mix, some nutmeg to the chard mix, and I'm going to try using some cottage cheese, or perhaps a bleu cheese, as an addition to the cheese mix, and I'll serve it with a side of sauteed mushrooms. This is a lovely dish, but I think it can be made lovlier.

I followed the recipe with one exception. I couldn't find swiss chard so I used two packages of frozen spinach. The texture was fine (I let it stand for quite awhile). Overall, I found the dish rather boring. If I make it again, I will use some more flavorful cheese and try to find the swiss chard. Also, I will chop the onion rather than just slice it.

This is an excellent recipe. I usually need to tinker or completely renovate a recipe before I can love it, but I have to say, this is really good nearly as is. The polenta/ricotta/egg mixture is brilliant... if you top the layers with the polenta as we do (along with a good dusting of parmesan cheese, which browns on top) it gets all puffy and light. We also add jarlsberg swiss to the cheese, which melds really nicely with the chard/onion mixture. Some italian parsley and just a little nutmeg added to the chard mixture also adds to this already very tasty dish. This (with these few alterations) was good enough for us to include in this last Thanksgiving dinner, which in our family, had better be good to hold up. It did, and everyone wanted to take home some of the leftovers afterwards. Highly recommended -- you can't go wrong here.

The flavor of this was awesome. I did use some parmesean on top which added a nice shapness to the polenta. It is runny and you really need to let it rest for at least 30 minutes before cutting into it.

I have made this recipe several times and it is superb combination of ingredients. Last night I made it again and made a few slight changes. It was the best ever. I used a full pound plus of swiss chard. 2. I used fat-free ricotta so that I could use whole milk mozzarella. 3. I use six ounces whole milk SMOKED mozzarella and two ounces pecorino. 3. I assembled the dish in a quiche pan. This seemed to be the key: it provided a the proper size and shape. 4. I observed the 30 minute waiting period after the dish came out of the oven. The pieces came out of the pan in beautiful pie-shaped pieces. Crisp and cheesy on top, rich and incredibly flavorful throughout the layers.

After thinking further about it, it could be the ricotta cheese made the dish soupy. Leaving out both the eggs and the ricotta, the polenta would have turned out fine.

Rating: 1
Unfortunately this recipe is faulty. The times I've made successful polenta dishes, the recipe did not call for eggs. I suspect the eggs make the dish runny rather than firm it up. It helps to whisk in the cornmeal, to reduce lumps. But even that couldn't save this dish.

Rating: 2
It looked great and tasted good - but I definitely would not make this as a main course again. My bf and I enjoyed it but were starving about an hour later. A serving of this is not a substantial supper. So, if I made it again, it would be as a side dish and I may just stir everything into the polenta and bake it as opposed to layering it (still ending with cheese on top).

A nice change--I hadn't had polenta in ages! I served this with sauted mushrooms and it was a hit. Overall, this dish was easy to make, though I goofed and used a baking pan less capacious than the 2-quart one recommended. I had leftover polenta mixture... but no matter: I saved it in a ramekin and baked it the next day for lunch. Topped with leftover tomato sauce and it was as delicious as the meal before. I'll be doing this again--two meals for the effort of one!

I did not follow the ingredients exactly so I couldn't fairly give it 4 forks. What I did turned out great. Didn't have ricotta or mozzerella, so I subbed in 3 eggs and 2 1/2 cups of cheddar. Added mushrooms and some spices to the chard. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Mmmmmm, good!

Superb. Letting it sit for a few minutes before cutting and serving it is crucial, however. This dish is also great re-heated for lunch the next day.

Very good. Polenta makes such a great side-dish alternative to other starches. I only had 1/4 cup of ricotta - not a problem. Also increased the garlic to 3 cloves. Followed all other directions exactly. Allowing time for it to set up was critical, and yes, it is even better the 2nd day.

This is a wonderful dish, however I would like to share a different method of preparing polenta (or cornmeal mush), which I have used for years with great results every time. Cornmeal should always be steamed in a double boiler, not cooked over direct heat. Here's my simple recipe: Dilute 1 cup cornmeal in 1/2 cup cold water with 1 teaspoon salt. Place in top of a double boiler: 4 cups boiling water or water and milk. Stir cornmeal mixture in gradually. Cook and stir the mush over quick heat 2-3 minutes. Steam, covered, over--not in--hot water 25 to 30 minutes. Stir frequently. Add to it for the last 15 minutes of cooking: 1/8 teaspoon paprika, a few grains red pepper, 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Layer your polenta casserole as desired and let sit until firm. Bake as directed. The result: NO MORE WATERY POLENTA P.S. Don't just drain that Swiss Chard or Spinach--put it in cheesecloth and wring the heck out of it--it's full of water even after cooking!!!! Enjoy this healthy dish!!

Very delicious recipe. Used chicken broth for the polenta and added parmesan. For the cheese layers, chose a combination of mozzerella and monterey jack. Garnished with tomatoes. I think it does taste better the next day. YUM.

We substituted chicken stock for water and added 1 cup parmesan cheese to the polenta while it was cooking on the stovetop. We also omitted the mozzarella cheese and did not miss it. The recipe was much improved.

I really liked this recipe - I made some changes as well, that of course, I highly recommend :). I replaced the mozzerella with chevre (plain goat cheese) and added black beans to the chard mixture. I'm a vegetarian and it made for a nice main dish!

Really love this recipe! It makes excellent leftovers - in fact, it was best the next day. The first time I made it, I followed the instructions exactly except I increased the garlic and cooked the polenta with broth, not water. The second time I made it, I did the same with the garlic and broth but added provolone cheese in addition to the mozz cheese) and added pieces of Italian-recipe canned chopped tomatoes to the chard layer, careful to drain all of the liquid - probably added a total of 1/2 cup of tomatoes. Also a little more red pepper flakes than the recipe called for. Delicious, sweet spicyness!

It is swiss chard, polenta, and cheese, how could it not be good! It is a little bit of work up front, since you need to cook everything before it goes into the oven, but it is really worth it.

This was very good! I made this as a side for pork chops baked in a hearty tomato/onion/bell pepper entree. Used baby spinach in place of chard. I too had a problem with firmness, but found I had used regular yellow cornmeal instead of coarse cornmeal/polenta. Served it to guests...everyone loved this.

Mine took a long time to firm up-- I used fat-free ricotta cheese, and that might have been the problem. It was more like whipped potatoes, but in any case, the flavors were really good and it was a fairly simple recipe.

This makes a good side dish, or meatless main dish. Followed recipe exactly, and was very happy with results. Like a spoon bread with chard. Would be a good accompaniment to ham.

I made this recipe as is, except that I forgot to layer the polenta and chard in 4 layers. Next time I will take the other cooks' suggestions and add a little pungent cheese like asiago, parmasan, or goat cheese. Polenta is very creamy w' ricotta, sour cream or marcapone might work too.

Ugh. Made this as the vegetarian alternative for our Thanksgiving dinner. Luckily for the vegetarians in the crowd, there were other options on the table!

This recipe was delicious! It was a great combination of cheese, polenta and greens, and was quite hearty, too. I unintentionally put my oven on broil before it was done, and the top came out crispy and brown. Yum! D.C. Cook
