This is wonderful. My first time preparing this style - my notes: 1. Bought a fresh spice pack called "Poultry Mix" as it had all the basics of a bouquet garni. Tossed all the spices in the olive oil and placed the salmon on top. 2. At 150 degrees, it took much longer than 5 minutes to cook the salmon. Turned it once too. Removed the skin as it drained on paper towels. 3. Found a pack called "Micro Greens" containing arugula. 4. Didn't use expensive balsamic and it was great. 5. Served some steamed asaparagus on the side to round out the dinner.

Excellent. Oil poaching is the key to the texture of this dish. Similar to butter poaching (beurre monte) that we use for lobster. Agreed, 100 y/o balsamic is a bit excessive for the home cook. Reduced higher quality, young balsamic worked fine for us. We used some Bibb lettuce and Watercress for the greens. To krbg in SF, Jeez, your dinner guests are a disgusting lot. No class or manners at all. "did you "pat" the greens?"...Oh for god's sake what a dolt. How quaint they are so socially inept.

Fabulous! We used king salmon cut into smaller slices (3-4 oz.) that fit loosely in the bottom of a small saucepan. We placed the filets on their sides so that the poaching oil could surround them completely but efficiently.

Without a doubt the best piece of fish I have ever put in my mouth. The same sentiment was expressed by my 10 person book club. I added a few tablespoons of bacon fat to the oil bath for extra flavor. I also used regular arugula and reduced balsamic and it was all phenomenal and more budget friendly to boot.

Wow! So delicious, so simple to make! A terrific dish to make when you're cooking for just one, too. Because it was just myself, I didn't bother to boil down my "ordinary" Balsamic vinegar, but the dish was outstanding anyway. I think "krbg from SFO" is pulling our leg.

I made this for a fancy dinner party. We were having my husband's boss and his wife over and they are "foodies." Everything about this dish had them intrigued; they admitted to having had an "oil poached" salmon last time they visited Aspen. Anyway, the presentation was simple but elegant as the list of ingredients is spare. My guests commented on the aroma of the olive oil, detectable because it was heated but not destroyed by a high temperature. I opened a bottle of Australian Chard, an austere stainless variety. Everything was perfect until the guests took the first bite. My husband's boss's wife's frowned and asked if I remembered to gently pat the microgreens. I admitted that I spun them in my herb dryer; I didn't think there would be a difference. She insisted it was delightful anyway, although it was a bit awkward as she didn't make eye contact with me through the intermezzo. She said nothing until commenting how quaint it was to have a cheese course with Camembert. I nearly choked on my aged tawny porto, but managed to eke out an awkward smile. My husband got passed over twice for a promotion since what we now refer to as "the dinner from hell".

You can taste the difference in 100-year old balsamic. Try the Italian Store or A. Litteri's in DC. You eat it on strawberries. Microagrula and greens are at the farmer's market. And if you can't get either of those, just reduce a decent balsamic and get some field greens.

This is a joke, right?

I also have aged balsamic, but only like 10 years old.

Sounds great but where can I get micro arugula or microgreens of any kind in the Washington DC area?
