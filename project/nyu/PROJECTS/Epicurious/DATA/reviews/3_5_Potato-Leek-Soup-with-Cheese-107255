I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: 1. slightly increased amount of leeks & garlic 2. used half & half instead of milk. It took closer to 30 minutes for the veggies to become tender. In the process, I lost a lot of liquid, resulting in a thicker soup than I would have liked. Maybe I should have chopped the potatoes and carrots into smaller pieces so they would have cooked faster. I don't think carrots added too much to this soup, so I will omit them next time. To all reviewers who criticize the soup for being too "fatty": when you decided to try the recipe, why did you not think a soup with milk, cheese and cream cheese would be fattening? Saying something is "heavy" is a legitimate complaint, but this recipe doesn't claim to be low-fat.

With a few modifications, the soup was quick and delicious. I skipped the dill and used fresh tarragon instead; used only a 1/2 cup of 2% milk and used onion & chive cream cheese rather than plain. A good dose of white pepper and salt brought it all together.

I'd remove the word 'leek' from the name as this hardly tastes at all like a traditional potato-leek soup should. Bland and thick, although the texture is nice - I added half the cream cheese it calls for (and noticed without it, it would have been tasteless and very un-creamy). Very disapponted as I've been meaning to make a good potato-leek soup for weeks, searched many recipes, and ultimately settled on this one.

Of countless recipes I have prepared from this site, this is the first I will not make again. I did not use cream cheese, and I added an additional garlic clove. Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe. There is a possibility this would have been a fine soup with thyme in place of the dill, but I won't make it again to see. Too many other yummy potato and leek soups out there to try!

We love this soup. I always double the recipe. I never have used the cream cheese, but do add whole milk or cream if I have it in the house. Delish! Sometimes I throw some corn or broccoli in the next night to make the leftovers seem different.

Rating: 3
Following suggestions from other reviewers, I used 2 leeks and omitted the cream cheese and the soup was delicious, creamy but not too rich. The time for my veggies to soften was more like 30 min. so I added another 1/2 cup of chicken stock as I like a thinner soup, and blended a little less than half. My husband billed it as my best soup yet! I will be making this again, maybe with a dash or two of tobasco.

I did not have many of the ingredients so I improvised based on comments I've read from others. I didn't have leeks, so I instead used 5 scallions. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used 1 can of veggie broth and I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I just grated some Stilton to give it some flavor. In addition to dill, I added some rosemary. This was a perfect way for me to use the remainder of my Xmas veggie ingredients! The soup was great! I also didn't use 4 oz of cream cheese, I just used about 1/8 - 1/4 of a cream cheese package. Lastly, I made some extra boiled potatoes and carrots and added those to the soup to give it some texture.

Great soup for a cold snowy night. I didn't have enough carrots so I added a celery stalk. This worked fine. My husband loved this soup and we both thought it very flavorful. I did add extra dill.

Wow! What a fantastic soup and very simple to make. I've made it several times and it freezes beautifully. I even used light cream cheese and cheddar cheese and it's still great. I do chop up the vegtables a bit smaller because I prefer it that way. Hands down, my favourite soup!

Gloppy and bland. Color is very appetizing...I tried every add-in to coax flavor out of this sludge-lemon juice(helped)crumbled bacon(was gobbled up) and additional sauted onions-still searching for the flavor. My childen my enjoy this heavy, fattening, concoction but I'll keep searching for a tastier potato soup. recipe.

Rating: 2
I'd have to agree with the reviewers who felt the soup doesn't know what it wants to be. While heartwarming and tasty on a cold night, its a bit fatty not delicious. Julia Child's more basic potato and leek recipe (just do a web search) is better.

It was great. I made the following changes: Omitted the dill, used cream instead of milk, cooked a couple of extra potatoes (cubed) and threw them in when the soup was ready for some texture. Everyone loved it. Highly recommend

I can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with this recipe, but I noticed a weird aftertaste after each spoonful. Could've been the dill. It was also very, very rich and creamy. If I were to make it again I'd reduce the cream cheese. On the plus side, it had a beautiful golden colour.

i've made this recipe twice now - once as is, and then the next time i customized it somewhat. i loved the recipe as it is here, but even more so when i made these substitutions: * stilton cheese instead of cheddar (added right before pureeing so the soup won't get too salty) * cut back a bit on the cream cheese * a splash of wine *veg stock instead of chicken, and about 1/2 cup more than is suggested here * garlic chives instead of dill * no carrots i garnished it with a little bit of extra-aged cheddar and yogurt and some chives and it was wonderful!

I've been making vegetable soups for years, and rarely have I come across a recipe I disliked this much. I think there were too many confusing textures and substances - potatoes, leeks and carrots, milk, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese. The result, in my opinion, was that the soup had no real flavor at all. I don't normally make something this fattening unless it is really a treat - so I won't be making this one again.

Rating: 4
This is the best soup recipe I ever made. Everyone I have made it for has asked for the recipe. After a few times making it I have adjusted the recipe a litte. I use bacon in it for a little added flavor and use a bacon roux after sauteing the leeks. This allows me to skip the bleding stage. The blending tends to make it taste a little like mash potatoes. The roux thickens the soup nicely and allows the real taste to come through. A definite keeper of a recipe.

Rating: 3
So good on a cold night, and a good way to get rid of potatoes. The texture was just right, but next time I will add more leeks and carrots. I topped with crispy bacon, cheese and scallions and served with sourdough rolls to make a meal.

This soup is great on a cold, grey day. next time I may use white cheddar because I didn't like the color as much with yellow. I used dried dill and wish i had had fresh. Chives would also be great. I used a little more leeks than the recipe called for and would probably use even more the next time.

Terrific soup and so easy to prepare. I was making this all winter last year. Last night I served as a first course to a group of six, boy am I glad I doubled the recipe! They went back for seconds and THIRDS, and they ALL asked for the recipe, every single one of them. I make it with olive oil instead of butter, semi-skimmed milk instead of half-and-half and use reduced-fat cream cheese.

I made myself this soup for when I got my wisdom teeth taken out. It was the only thing around the house soft enough for me to eat, and for three days it's pretty much all I had. It was great--comforting, delicious, and nice to look at. If you're going to eat the same thing day after day, it should taste this good. Too bad it's so fatty, though! I have made this soup several times since and it is always complimented. My boyfriend went back for thirds and he is used to great cooking thanks to his mom.

Just made this soup and enjoyed it with my family. I added 1/2 white onion finely chopped, crumbled my bacon into the soup to give it the flavour, several dashes of tobasco, lots of freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 lemon juice and 1 1/2 cups of extra extra old white cheddar. I omitted the cream cheese and used 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 cream topped up with 2% milk. I added chives from my garden instead of dill and served it garnished with Italian flat leaf parsley. I pureed it in the pot making sure I kept some chunks of veggies. It was fabulous and I definitely had enough to serve 8 people a bowl (therefore I have freezed most of it!)

Delicious! It was a pretty easy soup to prepare, with the prep work the only somewhat time consuming part. It was definitely worth it, though.

This sounded so good. I love potato and leek soup, and wished I had stopped before adding the cheddar. To me, it was too cheesy and thick, and only tasted of cheese soup. I am going to try the parsnip bisque next. Sounds like maybe more of what I am looking for.

Incredibly easy, and very, very good. Everyone ate it! Served it with rye rolls for a nice supper. I don't think it needs any changes; I used 1% milk, and it certainly was creamy, but don't think it is overly rich. This will reappear frequently at our house. (My 11 year old wants me to rate this a 4)

OK, so maybe 3 and 1/2 forks, but this is really wonderful soup. It is rich, but for a spluge, it's worth it. Followed the recipe up to the point of dill, didn't have any, so we used dill seed. That really added another layer of complexity. I can see why so many reviews called for lightening the recipe, but I'd be hard pressed to change a thing!

Sounds wonderful, thanks for the comment about substituting chives for the dill (I'm not a dill fan). To the chef from London, Ontario: You can use the Campbell's chicken broth in the large tetrapack *undiluted* (ie. use as is), OR, you can take the small cans which are condensed broth, and dilute with a can of (filtered) water.

Super easy to prepare, yet delicious and satisfying. Since this is a hearty soup, I served it in beautiful mugs on a silver tray during the latter part of the cocktail hour instead of hors d'eouvres which would have been too much food before dinner. It was a welcome change and guests were ready for a great "all-Bon Appetit" dinner.
