I made this again, with less salt, and it was still not good. The sesame oil was overpowering my opinion (and I love the stuff). It just did not taste like the rich, creamy, spicy hummus that I normally like. I added a whole slew of herbs to try to save it, mint, cilantro, etc., and then topped with some marinated olives, which ended up perking it up quiet a bit, but there are so many better hummus recipes out there!

Crap, did not read reviews first, was trying to not get bogged down in epi-land and actually make dinner. TOO SALTY!~

CAREFUL! This recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH SALT. I usually start with half a teaspoon and gradually work my way up. That way, it is the best hummus you might ever want to make. My guest always love it.

This was way too salty. I ended up adding another entire can of chickpeas to save it. It still was not great, although I noticed it was better after a day or two. Not a repeater for me.

I made this in addition to the Hummus with toasted pine nuts. Liked it enough to make again and will try to substitute sour cream. That seemed like a strange ingredient for hummus. Suggestions are welcome
