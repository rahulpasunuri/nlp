I made this before and my family really liked it. This time it lacked depth of flavor and was bitter. I think the tomatoes were not ripe enough. I usually put tomatoes on the windowsill for a few days before I use them. These were straight from the grocery store. I also made Mexican Lime soup from this site and it was delicious as always. Make that instead.

Very flavorful. This dish can easily be made vegetarian by using vegetable broth. I have made this dish several times and it is fast becoming one of my favorite soups.

Sorry, wasn't a big fan.

The reason I wouldn't make this again is because I made it sooo hot that I couldn't eat it. I love spicy foods but I went over-board on the ancho chiles. Use chiles with caution!

I made this recipe using a combination of homemade stock and fat free low sodium broth. It was delicious and my eight dinner guests all raved about this first course. For variation you can add corn and shredded chicken. I would add a touch more salt to the original recipe.

You don't even know it's low fat!!! I do not own a blender yet so I simply whisked the soup instead of blending, and the chunks of veggies made it very fresh-tasting! I love cilantro so used it in the broth as well as a garnish... The ancho chiles are a must and give it that Santa Fe-style taste. I made it Sun. and ate lunch all week!
