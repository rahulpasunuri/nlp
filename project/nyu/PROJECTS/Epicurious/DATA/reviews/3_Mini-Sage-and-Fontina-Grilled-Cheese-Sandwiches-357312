Adding the leaf made this so much more fun and visually stimulating! I also love that they're little and bite sized! I have a grilled cheese blog check it out if you'd like more exotic grilled cheese recipes! http://grilledcheesesocial.blogspot.com/

Yes, it was a good combo. Love fried sage leaves. I made it for two people, so quartered the recipe. The amount of cheese and butter called for wasn't enough. Used probably half again as much cheese and butter. IMO, a grilled cheese sandwich should be done--start to finish--in about five minutes. Just make note of the ingredients; you'll know what to do with them without spending time trying to make sense of which top of which slice of bread the recipe is talking about. Also, 4-5 minutes per side?? If you want to burn the bread beyond recognition, maybe! Two minutes on the first side, about a minute and 20-30 seconds after you flip it over.

I made this on a panini press and served for dinner with a butternut squash soup--my husband ate 2 1/2 sandwiches (whole ones, although I did cut into fourths like the picture and they came out perfectly) and said they were the best grilled cheese ever. I would have upped the sage a little for me, but I think most people would find the flavor balance perfect as is. Yummy!
