Great blend of flavors with the honey and the dates. I chose this recipe to use up some dates, then realized I didn't have a full 2 1/2 cups so I substituted a cup of Craisins for one of the cups of dates. The bread came out very moist and delicious. It does seem to benefit from whipping a good bit of air into the mix when doing the eggs.

My version came out very well. I didn't have any honey and so had to make substitutions. I also didn't have any loaf pans, so I baked it in a 9 1/2 by 11 cake pan. It was delicious

This was delicious and had a great texture - which surprised me since it doesn't have sugar. I followed what another cook did and beat the eggs a bit longer. Used high-fiber spelt flour instead of AP to make it more healthy.

I was looking for a date nut bread so maybe this may be unfair as the name of the recipe is "honey date nut bread" but I thought this recipe bland and certainly not a "date" bread.

I thought the flavors in this recipe were delightful. Loved the honey. I did find it to be a bit denser than I had anticipated. Next time I will beat a good amount of air into my eggs and add the dry ingredients at the very last moment.

Wonderful flavor, lasts a long time when wrapped in saran wrap and then foil. Great at tea time or after school snack.

I only had 4 small loaf pans, so ended up adding 1 medium as well--was certainly enough batter to go around! Really delicious date nut bread; enjoyed the addition of the honey flavor. Eaten plain, I thought it just a wee bit dry. BUT, with a little cream cheese spread on top--was simply marvelous! We ate the medium size one in just a few sittings! They do freeze well and have been a hit for small homemade gifts instead of or in addition to holiday cookies.
