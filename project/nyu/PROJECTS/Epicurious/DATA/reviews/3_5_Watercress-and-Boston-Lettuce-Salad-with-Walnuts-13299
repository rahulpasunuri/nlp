Great salad. Whole family really enjoyed this--even the gourmet cook in the family!

This recipe is the like a celebration is going off in your mouth; I added granny smith apples, asian pears, pieces of camelized walnuts, crumbled Bleu Cheese, and topped it off with light raspberry vinegarette!!! Served it on a large dish lined with Kale...Was the hit of the party.

Excellent, simple, refreshing foil to heavier meals. Easy on ther walnuts. My sister made it with pine nuts... lovely. The simple, tart dressing is the key to this perfect salad.
