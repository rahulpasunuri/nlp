Made it with fresh peas and it was incredible. Then I made it again with half fresh and half frozen peas (fresh were very expensive and I wanted to cut the cost). When I used the mix of fresh and frozen, the consistency was much more watery. Just something to keep in mind if you are using frozen peas - you might want to scale down on the stock if you are using frozen peas.

Very tasty result for a super easy and inexpensive recipe. I used frozen peas and it turned out great. Would definitely make again.

This is a lovely summer soup and is as good cold as hot

This was delicious. I used petite frozen peas and half vegetable stock half water instead of the chicken broth. In addition, I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a small glug of cream (in addition to the buttermilk). It got rave reviews. But I do think that fresh tarragon leaves are essential and pressing the soup through a sieve is necessary. You don't want the skin of the peas in your soup.

I used frozen organic peas to make this dish for Easter (English peas were not out yet). It was almost a disaster in blandness (and potentially mealy, since I chose not to strain the soup). Two critical items were added, and this dish went from awful to spectacular: a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end to finish it and brighten the flavor, and a scoop of fresh lump crab meat at the bottom of the bowl. Voiala! Fabulous!

Soooo nice and mellow.... but I did not strain the soup, since I love the texture. Beautiful with warm garlic bread.

Couldn't find tarragon, so I made it without. It was still delicious and flavourful. I've made it several times already . . . tastes like spring even in the middle of winter!

I thought this soup was excellent. Very fresh and spring tasting. I floated the buttermilk on top, and then sprinkled some crushed pink peppercorns for contrast which looked really nice. I also added some finely chopped chives to give it a bit more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using shallots instead of onions, and adding an extra cup of peas. I used frozen baby peas and fresh tarragon. This soup was SO easy and delicious. I used a lot of white pepper and liked the added mild heat it gave to the soup. With fat free chicken broth and 1% buttermilk, I think this soup has even less fat per serving than it suggests. For the ease of preparation, this recipe delivers a great soup!

Bright green and fresh-tasting, this soup is a little bit of springtime in the midst of a gray fall. I wouldn't change a thing, but you should know that this makes two enormous portions--it's actually four servings by my standards.

Delicious, rich and creamy tasting. (I used fresh peas but alas, dried taragon.) Along with the suggested french bread, this an easy summer meal for two. It would serve 4 easily as a first course.

This was a great, easy first course. I made this soup for a dinner party, and I couldn't find fresh peas, so I had to use frozen. Nonetheless, the soup had a wonderful garden fresh flavor. It got raves from everyone, and one person commented that it must have been the fresh peas that made the difference, because "frozen peas just don't taste the same". I stayed quiet, of course! The only change I made was that I did not completely strain the soup, because I wanted to have some of the pea texture -- it made the soup more interesting and flavorful.

I admit it - I tried this recipe because we were longing for the taste of fresh tarragon. When I make this next time I have some definite alterations, but I am determined to try. I tried to shortcut on a school night by using frozen peas and adding ready-made broth to a small base of sauteed onions, garlic, etc. As a lifelong vegeterian, chicken stock was out of the question. Next time I'll defrost homemade stock from the freezer beforehand and use far more tarragon. And if ever I have the time and patience to shell that many peas, I'd love to try it all fresh.

Good if you like pea soup. Bright green color -- and adding a dollop of buttermilk at serving time allows for a beautiful swirl of contrasting white! Next time, I want more flavor, so I will try making this with fresh, not dried, tarragon. I also will increase the onion. I tried using the a regular sieve (didn't have any others) and the soup just sat in there, so I ended up not using any sieve at all. The soup seemed just fine being pureed but not being strained.

I doubled this recipe and all the shelling (about an hour) was worth it - especially if you have fresh tarragon. Once the shelling is finished it's a very quick and easy recipe. I had 4 cups of chicken broth so I substituted with 1 cup of water to make 5 cups of liquid. I wouldn't decribe this recipe as diluted, but next time I might use a bit less liquid. If it's too thick you can always add more . . .

Just a nice change from a "split-pea sooup". Wonderful color and great taste.

Yeppers - this is a keeper. Simply, tasty and fragrant with the fresh tarragon. I put it together in half an hour while I the main course was in the oven.

This is the best pea soup I've ever had. I'll never make pea soup without tarragon again!
