This soup is just outstanding, one of the most interesting and best I've ever made (and making soup with homemade stock, homegrown herbs and everything fresh has been my passion for 10 years.) Very nicely balanced and sophisticated, this could be an impressive dish at a dinner party. I made it exactly as written, juicing my own carrots and using royal curry (with saffron) as my curry powder. The only complaint was from my curmudgeon husband, who doesn't do fussy (I left the mussels in their shells for serving) so I'll probably remove the shells next time. I'll definitely make again, and will consider substituting fresh cilantro for the tarragon or maybe adding some chopped fennel which goes great with both carrots and mussels. I may also turn it into a version without the mussels but with whole carrots, pureed at the end for more body.

Meh. Not actually that quick, considering prep time for shellfish and soaking to get out grit, and the final flavor is basically a thin carrot ginger soup with a bit of ocean. Very pretty to look at, but the tongue's got fidelity issues in the end. Will look elsewhere.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written( I also used fresh carrot juice from the organic section). It is very quick, simple and delicious! Add some bread and a bottle of chilled Pinot Gris and you are Good to GO!
