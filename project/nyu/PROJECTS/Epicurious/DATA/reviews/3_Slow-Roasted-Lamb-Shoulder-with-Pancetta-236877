I took the lamb out an hour before the recipe called for it to be checked and it was completely overdone. The crust formed by the pancetta mix was tasty, but the lamb was so dried out that it barely mattered.

Made this recipe as written. Lamb was tough and fatty even after several hours of slow roasting. Nice crust did not stay on the lamb as it was sliced. Big disappointment.

I loved this recipe...very easy, with a worthwhile result. I added about a teaspoon of salt before cooking, and used a 3lb roast. I also chopped everything finely instead of processing, which seemed to work fine. I cooked uncovered, but seared it first initially by starting with a 450 oven and then turned it down when I put the roast in.

Considering the value of the dish (compared to a leg or a rack), Id definitely go 4-forks on this. I did make it a little different than the recipe directed. Instead of making the paste in a food processor, I mashed everything together with a mortar and pestle. I found that forcing the paste into little incisions in the top of the lamb was a bit of a pain, and ended up spreading most of it on top of the roast or in-between the plans of the unrolled lamb as another reviewer suggested. Not being comfortable with a roast with no additional salt, I also added a couple tablespoons (in retrospect I think this was a mistake, as the roast ended up a little too salty, Id go just 1/2 to 1 T next time as the pancetta seems to provide about enough salt on its own). I also ended up cooking the shoulder longer, at a slightly lower temperature, to a much higher internal temp, and with a tight foil cover on the roasting pan for about 2/3 the time. With the oven at 300, the roast at achieved an internal temp of 210 within 2 hours of starting. I turned the heat down to around 280, fiddling with it every so often so the roast would keep itself at around 200 degrees. This is a much higher temp then the original recipe called for, but I had read before that 200-210 is the magic temp at which a fatty, sinewy piece of meat will have its fat and connective tissue melt out of it in a braise, and I figured it would work the same for a slow-roast. We kept the meat at this temp for about 4 hours, removing the foil on the pan for the last 90 minutes. In the end, we were left with an incredibly succulent, juicy, and fork-tender piece of lamb. The only things Id do differently next time would be to not add quite as much additional salt, add a little more rosemary, and to also reduce the amount of pancetta by 1/41/3.

I roast the lamb covered, which seems better than uncovered, as it keeps it moister. At some point I was also adding a cup of white wine, which worked as well, but a girlfriend makes it without liquid (covered) and the crust that develops is delicious. I've used bacon instead of pancetta, and it didn't seem to make any difference.

I made this dish for a big summer festa italiana and have to say that the meat came out dry and over-done, although I used a thermometer and pulled it out before the full 5 hours. I used a good cut of Oregon organic lamb, and thought it was a bit tragic to taste it in such a state. The greatness of this recipe is in the simplicity, and, like the previous comments suggest, the value of it both time and money wise. In the end, I didn't get any compliments, but I didn't get any complaints either!

Absolutely divine! The best lamb I've ever made. 3 picky teenagers all had seconds and thirds. Will make it for Easter next year.

What a treat! An inexpensive cut of meat that was not dry and was tender. I followed the recipe exactly. It was just delicious. I halved the proportions for the 2 of us and think that we had a lot of paste for the amount of meat; that was just fine. I used it all. ANd the extra rubbed on the surface or between planes of the meat, worked beautifully. I would not say that at 4 forks, it's a dish "beyond compare", but I was comparing it with other inexpensive cuts. We ate it with julienne of carrots and fennel roasted with olive oil and garlic. Perfect. One warning though...be sure the pancetta is very fresh. Even a slightly off piece would be a nasty aroma with the lamb.
