Great recipe. I would however, use artichoke hearts that are pre-packaged next time. I don't know if that would change the taste any. Overall great flavors and a wonderful twist to a pasta dish. It felt light and full of flavor. I used less than the specified amount of olive oil, mainly for the high caloric intake in each tablespoon, but it still turned out great.

This was a very good recipe. The flavors were very delicate and if you love artichokes, you can't go wrong. Plus, artichokes may seem difficult to prepare, but it's not hard if you clean and slice the artichokes ahead of time and leave them in the lemon water. Once that's done, it's pretty quick!

It was wonderful. Simple tastes, perfect for a quick meal if you do some prep work before hand.

We thought this was very delicious and overall very simple to prepare. I didn't think the artichokes were a difficult step in this recipe (although I did keep the leaves for a separate use, they're too wonderful to toss). We added some sliced, roasted chicken which we liked, other than that we followed the recipe. Served with a nice salad, it was a lovely, interesting and delicious dinner. Worth the time.

Very tasty pasta dish. Oh, and guys, nowhere does this recipe even suggest that it is "everyday" or "quick"! Why some of you are put out that the artichokes take some time to prep is beyond me; if it takes too long, don't use this recipe!

Would try it only if I can find canned or frozen artichokes -- I think fresh are not worth the effort -- and I ordinarily much prefer fresh anything than canned.

Delicate yet very flavoursome, and easy to prepare using bottled artichokes. I added minced garlic cloves to the oil, freshly squeezed lemon juice along with the artichokes, then followed the recipe cutting back on the the cooking time, of course. A good parmesan is paramount. Will definitely make again!

In my book, any recipe that involves cleaning fresh artichokes isn't "everyday" cooking. I used pre-cooked, quartered, canned artichoke hearts (not the marinated kind, though). I also added chicken before the artichoke hearts when making the sauce. The dish was very nice. It was surprisingly light. I think it would make a good summer-time meal and would even be good served cold. It's nice that the recipe uses so few ingredients/ingredients that are usually kept on hand in my kitchen. With the modification of using canned artichoke hearts it only took about 20-30 minutes to make, too.

Try making this dish using canned artichoke hearts in water. It cuts down on the preparation time, tastes fine, and is just as easy on the wallet. Plus you get way more artichoke for your dollar.

To the cook from Sarasota...you took the words right out of my mouth. Couldn't stand to let those delicate, delicious little leaves go to waste.

How do you think this would work with canned/frozen/jar of artichoke hearts? Seems like it wouldstreamline the recipe for weekday

This is classic Roman-style dish I learned to make while living in Rome. But, don't throw away the leaves!! Keep them and cook them to eat as a nibble with aioli, lemony melted butter, or with mustard-mayo as a dip - the way we all know. Some tips I learned from my neighbor in Rome: add some crushed red pepper for a kick (BAM!?), use baby chokes to make it easier to prepare. This is also good just sauteed and served as a contorni or antipasto.

I wouldn't call this an every night meal with the labor involved in those artichokes. Nor did I think you got the flavor you deserved after that work. And I love the simple flavors of Italian cooking. But be prepared to add much more parm and pepperoncino to get much of an affect at all.
