This is a super easy recipe that is a great weekend dinner. Weekdays would be do-able if you prepped as much as possible the night before. I added chicken as others have suggested. But the addition that really made this special was substituting cilantro for chives at the end. Amazing!

I used smooth peanut butter and excluded the nuts. Otherwise this was absolutely wonderful. Just a hint of spicy on the back palate. Smooth, creamy and delicious. I felt like there was just a hint of something missing. I may try adding just a bit of cream cheese next time along with the cream.

Perfect soup for a chilly night, thick and spicy. I like things zesty so I added more curry powder and some smoked paprika. The best part is the look on your friends' faces when they see you spooning peanut butter into the pan! I simply paired the soup with naan but next time I'll try adding chicken, like the other reviewers.

suprisingly good (I'd say 3 and a half forks). THe peanut flavor was not at all overwhelming, I was alittle disappointed at the lack of spicyness, next time I would add curry paste instead of powder, I am also not sure where to place this soup, as in when and with what to serve it.

Made this delicious and easy to make soup for dinner tonight. I had all the ingredients on hand. Even the kids loved it. I made a few adjustments by deglazing the cooked veggies and spices with 1/2 cup white wine. I garnished the soup with some cubed chicken from Sunday's dinner, chopped peanuts and a dash of smoked paprika. I'll definitely be adding this to our favorite soups menu.

This bisque is amazingly flavorful. Instead of cream use milk for a healthier option. Also feel free to add an assortment of nuts as a garnish (not just peanuts). I added sliced chicken pieces so it could be a complete dinner.
