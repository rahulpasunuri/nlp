I just made these shortbread bars to have as an extra at my son's first birthday party. I'd read that the dough is a little cakey compared to traditional shortbread and I should have paid attention. I was definitely hoping for the crisp, buttery shortbread experience and this recipe didn't come through. More like a breakfast bar or than a cookie or shortbread. I don't think I will make them again.

This recipe is so easy and super-yummy!!! I have made it several times now, and each time the jam squares were gone in a flash. Have made with strawberry and also apricot jam.I really like the texture of the "shortbread" which is more like a soft cake-like consistency...DELISH!

Excellent and easy. Wouldn't change a thing.

So easy to make and delicious. The dough was not firm like a shortbread cookie, a little more "cakie", but still delicious! I also used more jam than what was called for.

Excellent! I used a strawberry Jam and added sour cherries and blueberries on top before adding the crust on top. I shaped it like a pie in a round pie pan.

Very good... with two changes: I used whole wheat flour to give more flavor, and I added pecan pieces to the top layer to give more texture, color and flavor. (And, I chose apricot jam.)

These were good but I would recommend using more jam than the 6 tablespoons, as it gives a better jam-to-cookie ratio. The shortbread was softer than I expected,and very nice. I made some with black raspberry jam- delicious!

These are so easy and turn out delicious. I had to bake an additional batch because the first pan was eaten before I could bring some to the new neighbors!

This is one of the easiest and tastiest bar cookies one could ever make. The cookies were nice and smooth, which is great, but personally I prefer a little more texture. Next time, I'll substitute in some whole grain flour or oatmeal for a slightly more rustic feel. Wonderful!

My mom used to make squares similar to these when I was young and I've always wanted to find the recipe. I'm so happy I came across this one. Made them last night with rapsberry jam and they were delicious!! Very easy and quick. Next time I will double the batch and use a cookie sheet for more squares.

Delicious and versatile. I place the remaining dough in the freezer as well, then coarsely grate it over the filling for a more even spread.
