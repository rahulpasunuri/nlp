I don't have an ice cream maker, so I added a bit of Grand Marnier in to the juice and champagne, and this morning this has frozen beautifully.(I was thinking it would come out like a granita, but it has a lovely consistency.) Don't shy away from this one.

Wonderful! Definitely needs additional time in the freezer after running in the ice cream maker. Will definitely make again.

In my house we've come to call this "mimosa sorbet"! :) Probably my favorite sorbet, ever. DELICIOUS as written; easily used as a guide for other combinations of fruit juices/bubbly. I, like other reviewers, plan to always keep a version of this on hand.

So simple and so refreshing! I used only 1/2 cup sugar and that was enough. Will definitely make again.

I made this as an intermezzo for a dinner party last weekend and it was the biggest hit of the night! So light, refreshing and delicious!!! I've already had multiple requests to always have this on hand!

Very easy to make. The Prosecco lightens the tangerine flavors, but the tangerine lingers in your mouth after you are done eating. This is a delicious dessert for Spring/Summer.
