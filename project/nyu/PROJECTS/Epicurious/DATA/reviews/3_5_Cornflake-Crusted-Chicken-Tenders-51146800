Sorry folks, but I agree with cherf from Etna, Wy. I look to Epicurious for challenging, interesting recipes, that's why I quit the other recipe sites. I might make this for my grandkids for lunch, but I wouldn't need a recipe to do it. And, if it's been around for decades, why do we need to revive the recipe?

I use this basic simple recipe, for kids parties, all the time. And it is always a hit. Point of fact I use constarch instead of flour and add a bit of brown mustard and hot sauce to the egg/milk mixture for adults. And.... Note to the snobs: I'm a professional and the corn flakes don't get soggy as quickly when dipped in the dip.

Julia Child doesn't have kids and hug a budget either; i've used cornflakes for years, no one's dead yet; it's a great kid-friendly recipe to serve along with waffles on a Friday night after a long week ;0)

I agree with SoCo. Cornflakes for breading pre-dates panko and it's just as good. I have a box of cornflake crumbs (yes, they still sell them) in my pantry that I cycle with panko when I bread chicken, pork or fish. The Japanese did not invent breading.

If you have never made the recipe, do not review or comment on it. No one cares. A similar recipe has been around for decades-- back when one could buy cornflake crumbs in a box for the purpose of breading---and long before panko came into vogue. Cornflake chicken was just as good then as it is today.

Cornflakes? At least you could have used Panko crumbs.

I like ths recipe it's easy and you can change the spices to whatever is in your pantry. The cornflakes add the crunch that the kids love. I'm always looking for kid friendly recipes that doesn't require frying.

Sorry folks, this one just doesn't make the grade. How you managed to publish a recipe for chicken dipped in cornflakes and ranch dressing defies me. Julia Child is spinning in her grave.
