The cinnamon in this recipe really overpowers the flavor of the fruit. Next time I'll leave it out and add some vanilla, which complements the fruit without stealing the show.

This was probably the best tasting pie I have ever made, AND it was my first lattice top pie. I was really nervous about the amount of cornstarch, and whether or not it was going to set properly, but all my fears were assuaged when it was done. This will become a staple.

Absolutely PERFECT. Would not change a thing. I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, so put FOIL on the baking sheet...still scrubbing!

In addition to the strawberries and rhubarb, I added a pint of raspberries. It was one of the best pies I have ever made.

It's a winner of a pie, for sure. I'm also using this pie crust all the time now, it's so good and easy to roll.

This is a delicious pie which is quite easy to make- I use Pillsbury crust instead as it's a time-saver. This pie is especially good when the rhubarb is fresh- rhubarb season goes all the way from April to June. However, I also freeze rhubarb for (at the most) 3 months.

I very nice summer pie! So easy to make and very tasty. I made as directed, with the addition of some lemon zest to the filling and I used my own crust recipe. This was my first rhubarb pie, so maybe it's standard, but I had tons of juice breach the pie  my oven was rescued only by the lucky foresight to place a piece of parchment under the pie plate during baking. I understand this can happen with lattice-top pies, and in the end the filling thickened nicely, but there was a lot. Beware the overflow.

i cheat and use pre-made pillsbury crust, but it's still great! i also add the zest of 1 large orange and sometime a bit of the juice from the orange, but if you do that, add extra cornstarch. oh and i sprinkle turbinado sugar on top of the egg wash. Yummy!!

Rating: 4
Perfect pie. The crust is good, doesn't need all 10 tbsp. of water, though. i used a heaping quarter cup of corn starch and then let the filling sit about 20 minutes, then poured off juices. Cooking time was right on. I used more rhubarb, a few less strawberries and it could have used another quarter cup sugar. Excellent with ice cream.

I made this pie with a slight variation. I used Jiffy pie crust instead of the from scratch recipe and I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and zest of 1/4 lemon. Perfection. I have received rave reviews and expect this will become a go to summer recipe.

I didn't think the flavor was great - and i made it with fresh-picked strawberries and rhubarb! i know it's not much different than other recipes - i think there's too much cinnamon and a bit of vanilla might help. or maybe more rhubarb and less strawberry?

I have made this recipe for the past 14 years (or however long it's been published) and it is hands-down the best recipe I've found. Today I substituted tapioca for the cornstarch...but no matter. With a big scoop of vanilla ice cream atop a warm piece of this wonderful pie, it will become your favorite, too!

I made this pie for Easter, I doubled the recipe so we would have two pies. This is a fabulous pie! I used my own crust recipe which is very similar to the one here and I added 2 Tbs. quick cooking tapioca to the rhubard, sugar, cornstarch mixture. It was the perfect consistency. Also, while baking I covered the pie with foil until it started to boil, and then removed the foil for the last 15 minutes or so. I could eat this pie all day.

Wonderful pie! I used raspberries instead in the same quantity as they were in season. I added an additional tablespoon of corn starch to the filling after reading some of the other reviews. I also let the filling sit in the fridge for about an hour then drained off some of the liquid before filling the pie crust as another reviewer recommended. The crust was absolutely perfect and will be my new 'go to' crust. Very flaky and not greasy. Two thumbs up!

This recipe is wonderful! Very easy and tastes fabulous. I made it once with light brown sugar and then again with dark brown - I prefer the dark brown sugar. I've made it for several people and everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe. I cheated and used pillsbury pre-made piecrust which made it ridiculously easy. Definitely a keeper!!!

Rating: 4
Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite pie and I love this recipe even more because I literally just whipped it together for a BBQ (with the help of some Pillsbury pre-made crusts) in under 30 minutes. I accidentally put in 1/3 of a cup of sugar instead of 1/2 and that was no problem. I also reduced the heat a few degrees (to more like 335) to ensure the crust didn't get too too brown. I hate foiling the edges, it's such a pain, and it still got nice and juicy in the middle in about the same amount of time. Don't forget to put the baking sheet underneath not only for juice overflow but so you don't mess up your crust taking the pie in and out of the oven!

easy to make, tastes delicious, perfect way to enjoy fresh fruit in the summer.

I did an all-butter crust instead of the crust called for, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Ended up cooking a very, very long time before the filling bubbled to my satisfaction (probably about 1/2 an hour longer than suggested), also ended up with more juice than expected (even for a fruit pie). The flavor balance and the cornstarch amounts are absolutely perfect. Will make again and again.

This recipe is delicious. I substitute Julia Child's crust recipe for pies like this but the flavors in the filling are perfect. Cooking times worked out fine.

Possibly the best strawberry rhubarb pie I've had. I cut 25 minutes off of the cooking time and it turned out perfectly. I replaced the shortening with oil to avoid trans fat and replaced one cup of regular flour with whole wheat. Excellent.

Delicious and easy recipe, especially if you use a pre-made pie crust (I know, cheating, but it still tastes good!). The filling took only a few minutes to make and then you just pop it in the oven. Fabulous spring dessert with balanced flavors - definitely a crowd pleaser!

This recipe is great and the proportions are perfect if you use store-bought berries. I think the garden ones have more water in them (they certainly are juicier). If I do this again with my own berries, I will definitely add more cornstarch

I loved this pie! The first strawberry-rhubarb pie I've ever made, and you can bet I'll be sticking to this recipe for the next one I make. I made it for a friend's graduation party and the entire thing was gone in about 20 minutes. Everyone was raving about it. I served it with vanilla ice cream. In terms of the recipe itself, I followed the advice of another reviewer who said "Don't change a thing." I agree -- it's perfect just the way it is! I usually make an all-butter crust but I think the half-shortening one from this recipe has won me over. It was flaky and wonderful. Also, I found non-hydrogenated palm oil shortening at my local health food store ... no trans fat.

Very tasty, but not our favorite. It's a bit too sweet for my taste (but that's just preference.) Rhubarb fans (like us) should be forewarned to increase the amount of rhubarb decrease the strawberries.

This was very good. For the crust, I used 3 parts butter and 1 part lard instead of the butter/shortening combo in the recipe- perfection. The filling was delicious, but did not wow.

This was a huge hit! I used prepared pie crust (the red box that has 2 in there...forget the brand, maybe Pillsbury?) instead of making crust, b/c I don't have time or more importantly the patience to roll it out. My husband and our friends loved it! I made it the day before we ate it and heated it up slowly before serving (in the oven). Served w/ vanilla ice cream on the side. Delicious!

I confess I'm no rhubarb fan, but for a large dinner party, I was asked to bake a rhubarb pie (I'm the only American baker in the group). I made two and every crumb was gone - - I didn't even get a piece! The only change I made is that I used my standard pate brisee crust recipe. Spring is nearly here and I'll bet I'll get asked to bake this again.

as a beginner cook and first time pie-maker, I found this recipe difficult, but delicious. If I were to do it again, and I will, I'd worry less about rolling out the dough perfectly into the pie dish. Instead, I'd use my fingers to press the dough into the dish. I wouldn't care about the alttice top, but would spread bits of douggh across the top. I did both of these (after attempting many times to roll out the dough perfectly) and the pie still turned out looking and tasting great!

Rating: 4
I make this pie every year and it is a huge hit. I would use caution with the crust, watch the water amount. The crust should silll have slight pieces of butter you can see, if it is uniform it is a bit over done, as the butter makes the flakes, and I find sometimes the water is way too much. I do add a course sugar to the crust, turns out a sparkling golden beaty!!! My favorite pie of all and I am a big baker!

Rating: 4
My in-laws made me leave the leftovers behind, and my husband--who usually shies away from fruit pies--asked for seconds. Great, flaky crust. Didn't have any problem with the crust browning too much, but definitely use a cookie sheet (with a lip) under the pie to avoid a huge mess.

Rating: 0
tasted great, but so much liquid in the strawberries and rhubarb that it overflowed while cooking and the edges of the lattice ended up "underwater". The long baking time meant that the crust had to be shielded by foil so it didn't burn. I'd consider partially precooking the filling, draining it (and keeping the yummy liquid), and then baking for a shorter time.

Rating: 4
Best. Pie. Ever. Seriously. Not even just the best strawberry-rhubarb pie ever, but the best pie out of all pies ever made. Make this now. I'm not kidding. And don't change anything... I thought about changing things because of the user comments, but don't. It's perfect as it is.

Rating: 4
Delish - Huge hit at my office. It was all gone in record time. Only use 1/2 teaspoon of cinn. and use 4 cups of rhubarb and 4 cups of strawberries and leave sugar amounts as receipe states. Use a heaping 1/4 cup of cornstarch for a nice thicker texture. Mix filling and let stand for 1 hour. Drain juice and reduce in a pan over low heat and reincorporate into filling right before putting it in the crust. After you finish the lattice top chill the pie for 15 minutes or so before baking. Bake tented with foil at 350 for 20 minutes then 40 minutes at 400. Uncover and bake until crust is golden (aprox. 20 more minutes). Make sure you place a pan lined in foil on the bottom rack to catch the drippings.

Delicious! I love this crust recipe and definitely plan to use it again. I'd never done a lattice crust before and was very pleased by how it turned out (hint: to keep the pieces for the lattice easy to work with, cut them out and then pop them in the freezer for a few minutes so they can firm up again). The amounts of fruit and sugar seemed just about right. It did bubble over a lot as others mentioned, but I put a baking sheet underneath so no biggie.

This was a very professional looking pie; I was VERY impressed with the turnout! However, I found it slightly tart (due to the rhubarb) and next time I make it, I will definitely add more sugar. I hand-picked the strawberries the same morning I made this pie, I thought that really added something special to it.

This was a delicious and not too sweet pie. You definitely need a foil covered pan below it to catch the overflow juice. After cooling, the filling held together nicely.

Everyone went gaga over this pie. But, I changed it! I used my grandmother's crust recipe in which you roll the crust between waxed paper. It's so tender! I also let the fruit sit and drain some juice, but then i layered a sugar/flour mixture in between spoonfuls of fruit. Then i poured some of the juice back on top and more sugar and flour mixture. **************After putting the lattice on and finishing the edge, I rubbed a little of the flour and sugar over the lattice. *************The pie did bubble a bit, but we knew that would happen. I baked it at 400° for 30 mins (accidentally) and then at 325° for another 30 mins. *********I let the pie cool overnight, and when we cut it in the morning (lattice sparkling beautifully) it was juicy but firm in the filling. It sliced perfectly. I think this is because of the sugar/flour layers. Yum!

My husband and I loved this pie. I used a store-bought crust, creating a lattice with the top. I made the filling as is and loved it, but the rhubarb I got from the farmer's mkt was sweeter than some strains, and the strawberries were ripe and local - so the cinnamon was not overpowering at all. Bubbles over, so as with many pies - use a cookie sheet under the dish. Beautiful for summer!

I love the filling in this recipe and found that it tastes even better the next day or two (I had some left over since my pie pan wasn't deep enough). I took the recommendations of a few other reviewers and cut the cinnamon in half and added some raspberries and I was very pleased with the result. The crust on the other had was a disappointment. I should have listened to many other reviewers' warnings, but since I have quite a bit of experience with making homemade pie crust I thought, why not give it a try? The water ratio seemed way too high. After using just 6T, my dough was already too sticky. I managed to make it work for the bottom of my pie pan, but the dough was way too soft to attempt the lattice design. I used the crumb topping from another rhubarb pie recipe also on this site as suggested by a previous reviewer, and although it wasn't as pretty as the lattice pattern would have been, the texture was a great addition. I think next time I would add nuts to the topping though. Serving this pie warm with vanilla ice cream is a must!

Very nice balance of sweet and sour. Used a store bought crust to save time. Sprinkled demerara sugar on the crust before baking, which added a nice crunch and looked pretty. A baking pan underneath is a MUST! My pie bubbled over quite a lot.

I loved this recipe...I found the crust extremely easy to make and very flaky after the pie was baked...I did find it to be too much dough for one pie..so I saved the rest to make a quiche with later on. I made the recipe exacty as specified, however, I would add a little more sugar next time. My husband raved over it...will definitely make it again.

Magnifico!!!! Absolutely delicious. I agree that the crust is not the easiest to work with, however you can't overwork it (which you can't say about all pie crusts). My pie turned out perfect. Looked like it should be on the front of a magazine and tasted wonderful. The balance of tart and sweet was great. I like how the recipe calls for a total of one cup sugar. A lot call for 2 cups and it ends up being to sweet. I'm enjoying a piece with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. What a treat with fresh rhubarb in season. Can't wait to make next year.

Really really good even though I used refrigerator crust. My first attempt at a strawberry-rhubarb pie. Didn't have the bubbling over problem at all...I let the fruit mixture sit in the fridge for about 45 minutes--then added extra TBSP of corn starch.

I only gave 3 fork for my version- it needed more rhubarb to make it special, and the crust was a little difficult to handle at times. I didn't have enough rhubarb, so I ended up with 2C rhubarb and 4C strawberries (sliced slightly bigger than rhubarb). I took the advice of a few reviewers and given that i had more strawberries, I added 1teaspoon tapioca (all that i had) and 2T flour to the fruit. However, I did not precook the fruit. The pie did not run over and the consistency was perfect.

I have wonderful memories of my grandmother's strawberry-rhubarb pie and decided I needed to try and make one myself. I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I reduced the amount of cinnamon based on other reviews. And, since I can't leave well enough alone, I threw in a package of fresh raspberries I had on hand. Oh my goodness... this pie is fabulous! And I'm not a fan of crust but this one is wonderfully flaky and delicious. I woke up the next morning wanting pie for breakfast. I can't wait until I have a good reason to make this again, before the fresh rhubarb is gone.

We made a different crust that was all butter, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty much as written with the variation many have mentioned of cooking the liquid off the fruit prior to baking. This was such a great way to use up some rhubarb from my coworker's CSA share!

This pie was very good, except one teaspoon of cinnamon was overpowering and made it taste a little bitter. I will add just a quarter teaspoon next time. Also, it's tricky not to overbrown the crust with that much oven time. I think it should cook just until bubbly (twenty minutes less?) and it would be fine.

Rating: 4
Made to the letter and it turned out better than I could have ever hoped. Tart-sweet-lemony heaven. The filling came together in a lovely (not runny) jammy way. Cooked for almost two hours total (20min at 400 & 1hr 30min at 350), tented most of the time to prevent burning. There was some overflow - but no more than you would expect with any fruit pie.

Rating: 4
One of the prettiest pies I've made. I used closer to 1.5 16oz containers, and probably a little more than the called-for amount of rhubarb, too, mostly because I like a nice heap on my fruit pies. I also upped the sugars and cornstarch by about 2 tbs each. But I definitely didn't have to pre-cook or strain the filling, or anything like that, and it came out perfectly. Cooked for 20 min at 450, and an hour or so at 350. I think some people said this, but definitely put the pie tin on a foil-covered cookie sheet, because it's going to bubble over a bit. Lovely and perfectly springy.

Rating: 4
One of the best pies for spring. I made two pies for a family get together and there wasn't a crumb left. After reading the reviews I used both the heaping quarter cup of cornstarch and I added one tablespoon of tapioca. This produced a firm filling. The pies did run over in the oven and I changed the foil catch twice to prevent the burning. The pie baked beautifully with 4oo for 20 minutes and then 45 minutes at the lower temp. The crust was simple enough. I used seven tablespoons of ice water. I flattened the dough into a large disk between plastic wrap and it rolled nicely. This is my new favorite. My 73 year old mother even asked for the recipe.

This was my first time making this particular crust--a million thanks to the reviewer that suggests rolling out between wax paper and freezing between steps. I was ready to scrap the whole project I was so frustrated. Definitely worth the effort in the end! I strained the juices from the filling and baked as instructed. It's a remarkable pie, and I'll even use that dough for other pie projects in the future.

Rating: 4
This was really good! I took one of the cook's advice about letting the fruit sit for an hour and straining the juice, reducing it and returning it to the fruit. I think this is important. I still found that the juice was bubbling over my lattice in spots so I used my turkey baster to suck some of the juice out in those areas and that seemed to work! Once we were serving it was perfect, not overly juicy or drippy! And so flavorful!

Rating: 3
Taste was great, pie was runny.I read reviews and used a heaping 1/4 c. of cornstarch, as well as let the fruit set for an hour and then cooking on the stove to thicken it before putting in pieshell (which was pillsbury refrig kind, baked 6 mins before putting in filling - crust was great). Cut cinnamon in half - taste great, but still runny. Very easy to make!

This was my first attempt at a strawberry rhubarb pie and my first attempt at a lattice crust. I followed the recipe with no changes and it turned out very well. I did experience the bubbling over so next time I will let the filling sit and strain some of the juices. I'll see how it thickens and then determine if I should cook on the stovetop to thicken more. I also followed the crust recipe with no changes and didn't experience any problems. I made sure that the dough was well chilled. A great recipe, fun to make, beautiful pie and delicious. I served it with lemon ice cream (see the blueberry galette recipe) and it was a perfect match.

This pie was fabulous with the following changes: I used a frozen organic pie crust, which I let thaw and then pre-baked for 10 minutes. I used the crumb topping (cut the sugar in half and mix by hand - no processor) from the Deep-Dish Rhubarb Pie with Crumb Topping on this site instead of a double crust. I also used tapioca in place of cornstarch (same measurement), let the filling sit for 1 hour, and I didn't have nearly the excess liquid others mentioned. The crumb topping also helped soak some of it up. I recommend baking this pie on a cookie sheet lined with foil to contain the inevitable sticky spills. My baking times were 400 for 20 minutes, 350 for 20 minutes, then add the topping and bake for another 25 minutes. Keep the fruit in pretty large pieces. My partner said this was the "best pie ever!"

Rating: 2
Well, full disclosure: I'm a lazy so-and-so. I used store-bought crust, which has worked well for pies that I've made in the past BUT with this recipe, I really think it needs a flakier, more buttery crust. Pillsbury's is a bit doughy for this pie. If I should make this again, I'll make my crust, using the recipe here. As far as the filling is concerned, after reading the reviews, I let the fruit mixture sit for an hour, drained the juice, and simmered it in a saucepan until it thickened up a bit. I think this really helped, because I didn't experience any of the issues with bubbling over or runny filling that others had trouble with. I also cut the sugar, by about an eighth of a cup, because I don't like overly sweet things. This was a bad idea. The pie needs every bit of sugar that the recipe calls for, and maybe even a bit more than that...or perhaps I had exceptionally TART rhubarb (if there is such a thing). Also, (and I wish I'd read the reviews that talked about this beforehand), 1 teaspoon of cinnamon is TOO MUCH cinnamon. It overpowers the delicate flavors of strawberry and rhubarb. I would use 1/2 teaspoon if I make this again. I have a gas stove/oven, and I baked this pie at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then covered the crust edges with aluminum and reduced the heat to 350 for 45 minutes. It came out perfectly done, so definitely take the recipe's cooking times with a grain of salt, and keep an eye on your pie.

Rating: 4
This was the first pie I ever made, my husband's favorite. I make at least two or three in the summer when the berries are cheap. And if the berries are real sweet on their own, I cut the sugar in half. We like it a bit on the tart side anyway. I also sprinkle sugar over the top with the glaze before baking. It makes the lattice top sparkle! Definitely a keeper!

This was perfect! I also used a HEAPING 1/4 cup of cornstarch and let it sit for an hour after mixing. I didn't bother simmering the juice prior to baking. Baked at 425 fir 20 min, then 350 for 50, but I think my oven runs cool.Also, I like to add an apple or two. Why not?

Pie tasted great! perfect amount of sugar and spice. I did what others suggested - let fruit sit 1 hour with sugar mixed in, used 1/8 c of cornstarch to thicken 1 1/2 cups of syrup then added back to fruit along with other 1/8 cup of cornstarch. Baked for 20 min. plus 1 hour and the fruit was nicely cooked but pie was still very runny :( I used 3 1/2 cups of each fruit and it was less than the 1 1/2 lb amount suggestd but was the right amount for an 8" deep dish pie. I used organic strawberries and fresh rhubarb pulled from my garden. Next time maybe I will let it sit a few hours to get more juice out.

Great Pie after following the recommendations from reviewers. I let the filling sit for 1 hour, then drained and cooked/reduced the juice before adding it back in. Also the bake time for me was 20 min at 400 plus 45 minutes at 350. It was perfect and held together nicely.

What a great pie! This was the first pie I have ever made, so I took into account some of the tips from the reviewers below. Here's what I changed: 1. I didn't have shortening, so I used all butter for the crust and had none of the problems that others have had. I have since made the crust as written and it was much more difficult. 2. I used a HEAPING 1/4 cup of cornstarch and it was perfect. 3. I halved the cinnamon I had a great time making this pie and it was delicious!

a question for the folks here about quantities. From the list of ingredients for the filling: "1 16-ounce container strawberries, hulled, halved (about 3 1/2 cups)" Now, a 16-oz basket is 2 cups... so did folks use 2 cups or 3 1/2 cups of strawberries?

Very good pie. Mine overflowed dramatically-- if you have juicy local berries beware. Good flavor but still quite tart despite the sweetest strawberries I've ever tasted.

Rating: 4
This pie is EXCEPTIONAL. I loved it! Perfect summer pie! That said, this crust is not for the faint of heart, it becomes extraordinarily soft the second it hits air making it difficult to roll out and form the lattice. What I did: I always roll my crusts between waxed paper or parchment to keep oils off it. I rolled out the first half, popped it in the freezer, rolled the second, froze, fitted bottom into dish, back in freezer, sliced up strips, refroze, wove them on waxed paper, back into freezer, filled bottom with fruit and then CAREFULLY transfered lattice onto pie (by gently folding it in half- waxed against waxed- and laying one half on top and slowly folding the rest over the fruit) and then trimmed and crimped edges. I think anyone wanting to make this should know what they are getting into. If this seems scary-- use a crust you know is easy to work with. After all the work the crust was insanely flakey, flavorful (could have used a pinch more salt, though). The middle was delish-- I halved the cinnamon (which I believe was the better move since you can sort of tell its there but doesn't detract from the strawbs or the rubarb). And I used a heaping 1/4 c cornstarch. I love Strawberry Rhubarb anything and this will be the pie I make from here on out!

I didn't have any more or less trouble with this crust than any other pie I've done. One thing -- I didn't use the full 10 tbsp. of water. I only needed 8. And I made the dough last night so it rested. I didn't let the dough completely warm up to room temp -- started working with it when it was still a bit chilled. Also, used my Mom's technique of rolling on a floured cotton tea towel (absolutely has to have no weave/nap to it). Finally, I didn't have any Crisco in the house, so made it with a cup of butter.

Having never tried rhubarb, I decided it would be fun to try making this pie. It was not fun. The dough was an absolute nightmare to work with - both sticky and fragile, it fell apart so badly that I basically just shoved it in the pie dish and squished into place. I think my husband and dogs actually fled my wrath while I struggled with the lattice. And then the pie came out of the oven. The crust is by far the best I've ever had - sweet and flaky. Absolutely worth the nightmare of putting it together. The filling was also beautiful, and had a perfect consistency. We and our neighbors ate the whole pie in a few days, and I'm actually contemplating making another one soon. This time the crust making process will be less hellish, as I'll know it will be well worth it in the end.

Fantastic pie. Did not change ingredients but did make my own crust. 1/4 Cornstarch was not enough for me. Was a little runny still. May need to up that a bit. You have to like the sweet sour combo. - I loved it but my husband did not. Also, a tip on pie crusts, you need to work with them chilled and be fast. Once they start warming up - they fall to pieces. I threw that in there since so many had problems with this crust.

Rating: 4
I just made this for an early summer BBQ, using a ready made organic crust. (I also made the lattice from a broken, defrosted ready made crust.) I received so many compliments that this was the "best pie ever". Perhaps it was due to the peak-season berries and rhubarb straight from the farmer's market. One person even made me *swear* that I made it and didn't purchase the pie from a local baker. This pie is just super-simple and fabulous.

I have never had a strawberry rhubarb pie [ S/R Pie ]. I have eaten raw rhubarb before so I was not ready for the tart sweetness that evolved in the pie. My husband loves S/R Pie and he loved this one.

I cheated and bought the crusts. But I made 4 of these and they were wonderful! I great use with all the rhubarb I have.

I brought this pie to a dinner party and it got raves. My only criticism is that the crust was VERY difficult to manuver. It broke A LOT. But once I got it in the dish, the flavor was lovely. I also like to steam my rhubarb until tender and then the whole pie can bake for less time (about 45 min).

this was my first time ever making a pie and the first time eating rhubarb so i wasn't sure if i would like the flavor or the outcome. this pie came out 10 times better than i thought it would. it looked really pretty with the lattice top and even better it tasted sooo good! everyone couldn't believe it was my first pie and said it was the best strawberry rhubarb pie that they have ever tasted. i did use about 4 1/2 cups rhubarb and 4 cups strawberries just to make sure the pie would still be full after baking. definitely will be making this soon! i think i found a new favorite pie flavor, well besides the classic apple.

i used saralee pie crust and was a bit disappointed in the way it handled when making a lattice top, but the finished taste of the pie is wonderful. very easy to make, and one of the best-tasting pies i have made, i'll make it again.

i had never made this type of pie, not really a "southern" pie...but it went really well. i used my own crust recipe and the only change i made was to use a little vanilla as well as the cinnamon.

I made a lattice top for the first time...the crust was so good, I wish I had made a double crust. The rhubarb- strawberry combo is great. I will use some of the suggestions from the reviewers next time...Try it, its worth it! The only problem was cutting it to serve. It fell apart, and the crust crumbled. Overcooked the crust?? Will experiment next time with shorter cooking time as suggested by others.

This pie was delicious! It gets three forks ONLY because I am reviewing the crust as well--which was a lot of bother for a mediocre crust. I would recommend using a trusted recipe instead of bothering with this one. It's not worth the trouble. I did make some changes to the filling that worked out really well: I mixed the rhubarb, sugar, and cinnamon and let it sit overnight. The next day, I drained the juice, added the strawberries (plus an additional 1/3 c each of white and brown sugar), more cinnamon, and the cornstarch. I also added about 1T of vanilla, as well as 1 egg beaten with a bit of cream. The result was a delicious, sweet pie that held together really well.

perfect -- exactly what i was looking for! made for 4th of july with farmer's market rhubarb and berries, served with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious. totally easy and worth it to make the crust (especially with a food processor). i needed about 7 T of the ice water.

I made this pie on a whim with a frozen double pie crust & fresh rhubarb and strawberries from the supermarket (missed the farmer's market that morning). The pie turned out well. It was gorgeous (even with the simple double crust) and nice and tart - not too sugary. I reduced the cooking time as suggested - only cooking it at 350 for 45 minutes - I still felt like the fruit was overcooked and mushy. I wasn't as crazy about the flavor of this pie as my family standard rhubarb custard pie, but my boyfriend liked this version better.

Rating: 4
Made this for Mother's Day and it turned out really well! I was very happy with it, especially the pie crust. I added a splash of vanilla, because in my opinion it's not a dessert if it doesn't contain vanilla which off balanced the cinnamon a touch (my husband isn't crazy about cinnamon). Wonderful recipe - will use again!

This was one of the best pies I have ever made! I didn't have time to make the crust from scratch- used a frozen Pillsbury crust, and added a little freshly grated nutmeg to the filling- fantastic!

This is a very delicious, sophisticated pie. My family hates the sickly sweetness of store-bought pies, so this was perfect for our 4th of July. The tip about not overworking the crust is right-on. But then again, that's the secret to any pie crust....

I made this pie for a picnic this summer and it was a big hit. So pretty and fresh. It received lots of compliments.

another tip--cover your pie crust edges with aluminum foil strips, or metal edge covers(they do exist, and they r great).. 3/4 way through baking, remove them, and they will be baked the same as the crust, and not burnt or cracked.

Give this crust a chance! It is delightful! The secret is NOT to work the crust too much! That way , it comes out very light , with flaky little pockets.Use real butter as well, not margarine. Great filling. I made and sold this pie in the mountains of NC.. Fresh , ripe rhubarb, that is in season, is vital. It helps to cut the sweetness of the strawberries, and holds the pie together. It also adds a light tartness, and is wonderful, served warm, and topped with french vanilla ice cream..

Three and a half forks, I'd say. I've made this pie twice, each time as a double-crust pie - I do use my own crust recipe, not the one given here. The first time, I had garden rhubarb and beautiful fresh, local strawberries at the peak of the season, and it was to die for. The second time, I had good garden rhubarb, but the strawberries sadly only looked good - one basket was underripe and almost sour, the other was overripe, heading toward mushy. In an attempt to rescue the berries, I added a scant tablespoon of good quality balsamic vinegar (I thought: it works great for raw berries, maybe it'll work for cooked ones too), an extra tbsp of sugar, an extra tsp of cornstarch, and a brief prayer. Success! The pie was devoured, and no one noticed the balsamic except me - probably because I knew it was there, and I was looking for it.

Ok, so I'm pretty sure this was my first attempt at any sort of fruit pie. I'm a cooker, not much of a baker, especially sweet stuff. I'd also never had strawberry-rhubarb pie and since I wanted to try it, I decided to make it myself. It was very easy to make and the pie came out wonderful. I did only cook it for about an hour after the temperature was lowered. My husband was so impressed that he never even asked what rhubarb was. Even the lattice wasn't difficult at all and looked so pretty. I'll definitely be making this again, and it may have inspired me to make more pies!

I made this pie last week Wednesday. Followed other reviewers comments on baking time. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes lowered temp to 350 for 45 minutes. Also took advice from a previous reviewers on overflowing problems. I used a ten inch deep dish pan. This pie was really good served it with vanilla bean ice cream. I will definately make this again!

I've always loved eating this pie but this was the first time I had made it myself - very, very good... I took the other people's suggestions and only used about 5 tbsp of water in the crust and I only cooked the pie 45 min after the oven temp was reduced... perfect; looked beautiful (although the lattice was a little fussy) and tasted great!

my first strawberry rhubarb pie. really good! i made two - used potato starch (1:1) in one and tapioca flour (2:1) in the other. no appreciable difference - the one with potato starch was maybe a touch less sweet, which i liked, but could've been the fruit. not wild about the crust, but it was ok - i'd mix by hand next time.

The good news is that I took everyone's hint and came out with a wonderful pie. My husband and I ate half of it! piggy piggy. A little old pie lady told me once that I was "boiling" my pie with too high a temp. I have a convection oven thus you automatically lower the temp 25 degrees. Maybe by lowering the temp people won't have to monkey around with the temp. Also I lightly covered it with tinfoil as it had aways to go and I thought it might get too done. Covering it did the trick. Also I only baked it 45 minutes after I lowered the temp. Also used the chrystalized sugar on top. I used the store brand roll-out pastry and it was better than anything I could ever make! Enjoy!

A fabulous pie - the crust was flakey and the filling was the perfect mixture of tangy and sweet (without being runny). The crust was browning pretty quickly towards the end, so I pulled it out of the oven a little early - but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
I've already made this pie twice in three weeks! It's amazing! I don't have access to fresh rhubarb, so I've been using Bonne Maman's rhubarb compote. I think it might even be better than fresh. The tartness is more pronounced, and there's none of the bitterness that fresh rhubarb sometimes has. The crust is also fantastic! I will use it again for other fruit pies.

Rating: 4
This pie was perfect. Except for being time consuming (dough has to chill, pie cooks forever) it is also really easy to make. I didn't have a problem with over-browning so I wouldn't shorten the cooking time. I wonder, though, if there's anyway to prevent so much filling from bubbling over?

Filling is fine, but crust is impossible to work with--sometimes, if you make a pie on the spur of the moment, you don't have time to chill the dough.

I thought this pie was wonderful. I made some slight variations: added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 2 pinches of cinnamon, used 2 lbs of rhubarb, and store bought crust. I cooked it for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then for 60 minutes at 350. It came out perfect.

Rating: 2
Was better after sitting a day. Came out of oven thick enough to serve but the filling overflowed during baking in a normal pie dish - and it was very tart. The overflow tasted sweet, though; seems like all the sweet berry juices & sugar overflowed & the tart rhubarb sat in the bottom of the pie shell (I did mix thoroughly before pouring the filling in, of course). Perhaps reducing rhubarb would make it less tart & overflow less, myself I would just try a new recipe. Note I used an ordinary storebought crust, I'm not reviewing that.

My husband cringed his nose when I said I was making this pie. He loved it and asked me to make it again. This is very delicious. As with other reviewers the suggested baking time is way too long. I am not a huge cinnamon fan, and so I used 3/4t and thought it might need the full 1t. Yum!

This recipe is a keeper! Like other reviewers, I took the pie out of the oven early to avoid excessive browning. It was beautiful and delicious. Everyone loved it!

A great pie. This seems to be a minority opinion, but I think that the amount of cornstarch is excessive--it makes the filling too goopy, which dulls the flavor and takes away from the amazing texture of the strawberries. I'll try it with half the amount next time. Less cinnamon and a lil nutmeg were good suggestions from other bakers. Thanks.

I have made this pie three times, and it's been delicious everytime with rave reviews. I, too, had to watch the cooking time and did take the pie out before the cooking time in the recipe stated.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! Much easier than I thought it would be and the lattice-top made it look so pretty. I cut back on the baking time because the crust was starting to really brown, but even at 1 hr 10 minutes, the filling was perfect. Definitely will make again!

Usually my pies end up being a disaster, but this one was just... so... good. Because the crust isn't at all difficult to work with, I now use this crust recipe for all my pies, regardless of the filling. But definitely try this with the strawberry-rhubarb combo. Unbelievable!

This pie was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and made 2 pies and it still left me some to put in a casserole dish as a small one. The only thing that I did different was keep an eye on the time it said to bake. The first 20 minutes at 400 degrees was okay but after I turned down my oven (which is gas by the way) I noticed within an hour it really started to brown up the crust and gel very well. I suggest you keep an watch on it in your oven. I realize that all ovens vary with heat temperatures. I definately will make this pie again. Thank you.

Delicious, beautiful and SO easy! I had the pie sitting on my stovetop before dinner and one of my guests asked if it was real! I made the recipe as written except I used only a pinch of cinnamon...I agree that it would be overwhelming otherwise. It was devoured, and I could hardly wait to have the leftover piece for breakfast. I did find the crust a little unruly to roll out and get into the plate compared with other piecrust dough (hence the 3 forks) , but the end result was perfect.

This was ok. Made a lovely presentation, but close your eyes and take a bite of this pie - and you might think it was apple! The cinnamon overwhelmed the flavor of the strawberries and rhubarb, giving it an "apple pie" taste to me. Disappointing, given the narrow season for rhubarb. I made the pie exactly as written, but I would either eliminate the cinnamon next time or drastically reduce it - a teaspoon is far too much. Might try lemon zest or orange zest in its place.

Rating: 4
This pie was delicious and a big hit with everyone. I used my own crust recipe and sprinkled a little Sugar in the Raw over the yolk glaze before baking. As others said, watch the baking time... the pie was done at least 20 minutes sooner than the recipe indicated. Wendi

I followed this recipe exactly except for the cooking time - didn't seem to require as much in my oven.

This pie is delicious! I used frozen fruit and it was perfect! I can see why some cooks may find it a little on the tart side but all my guests loved it.

Great, and easier than expected. Made one to spec, and another with raspberries added to the strawberries and rhubarb, which was a great hit. We didn't let the second pie cool thoroughly so it was runny, a shame because it set up in another hour. Thought the long cooking time was perfect for this crust.

People always rave about this pie, and it has replaced apple as my husband's favorite. I use my mother's crust recipe, but this filling is terrific. For other "lazy gourmets," you can use 1/2 bag frozen strawberries and 1/2 bag frozen rhubarb and it will still taste great!

Rating: 3
Pretty good - I think baking it for as long as the recipe states is just a little too long (plus, you might have to cover the pie while it's baking in case your crust is getting too brown). I cheated and used ready-made pie crust -- not worth it to me to make my own. I would add more strawberries next time, it was a little unproportionate with the amount of rhubarb...But everyone loved it and it was gone in 5 minutes! A few tweaks and this is a keeper.

Fabulous! I have been making this recipe for yeaars and it is the only one rhubarb pie I will make. Two years ago I made 8 of them for a Mother's Day luncheon at a local winery and they disappeared in a flash! Every year during rhubarb season I get calls to make this pie and requests for the recipe. The cinnamon makes it something really special. My grandmother use to make her pie crusts with lard & butter. This crust comes very close to duplicating hers. This pie is a tradition.

I've made this pie so many times since I received the original magazine recipe. It's always the show-stopper one hopes for.

I liked this pie, but there are better ones. It wasn't very sweet - almost bitter or sour, and lots of people wouldn't like that. There may have been something funny with the rhubarb. But personally, I would most likely make it again. We have such an enormous rhubarb bush that we can easily get more food than we want out of it.

I used the pastry from this recipe with my own rhubarb pie filling and it was wonderful. I may tweak it a tad by increasing the butter and cutting out some of the shortening as I thought it didn't have as much flavor as it needed. I also sprinkled turbinado sugar over the lattice after brushing with the egg wash which gives it a lovely appearance and nice crunch.

I would say this is the perfect strawberry rhubarb pie in taste and texture; and it's very easy to make. I had never eaten one, but my husband was a big fan. We both agree on this one.

I had never made -- or even eaten -- rhubarb pie before and thought this was pretty good. I upped the rhubarb-to-berries ratio slightly because that's what I had, and perhaps for that reason -- or because I used juicy strawberries from my garden rather than drier grocery-store berries -- the filling bubbled up over the lattice and oozed around the edge of the pie, making a red mess. Also, I thought the crust, though very tender, didn't quite have the flakiness or flavor of a more-buttery recipe. Make sure all the rhubarb is well submerged in the filling, or pull the renegade pieces out halfway through. I ended up with a few little green and brown bits sticking up like burnt celery! The filling was delicious, however -- definitely worth tinkering with.

Rating: 2
The crust for this recipe is too heavy on the shortening; while it comes out flakey, it isn't as tender and rich as I would like. Be careful with your strawberries: overripe, smaller ones are better. Also, in any double crust pie, remember not to create equal sized disks; your top takes much less dough than your bottom.

The crust turned out marvelous! I changed it slighly by cutting everything in half and using no vegetable shortening, just butter. It worked especially well using the food processor. And I paid attention to one reviewer's comments of not over using the food processor, but just giving it on and off zaps for about 1 1/2 minutes. Now as for the filling-remarkable!! However it turned out runny. Could it be that the recipe calls for too little corn starch, maybe 3 tablespoons of flour should be added. We live in Germany and my German husband loved this famous American pie. Thanks! Donna

This was the easiest pie I've ever done and I've done quite a few. I made it one night after work for friend who ate nearly half of it that night and finished the rest for b'fast. Unfortuantely, I followed the recommendation of only cooking 15 mins. at 400 and 45 mins. at 350 and it never fully cooked through. The filling was very, very runny. However, the crust is FABULOUS (I did it by hand and had no problems) and can't wait to figure out other recipese to try this crust with.

Rating: 3
COOKING TIME: I used disposable foil pans and the pie came out purfectly in the baking time specified by the recipe. I had no burning whatsoever and did not have to cover theedges with foil. I think some of the reviewers who have complained about burning might be using dark non-stick pans, and/or their ovens may run hot. --- THINGS I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY: 1) It could use a little more zing, so I might increase rhubarb ratio, 2) experiment with reducing the amount of cornstarch, 3) experiment with the addition of a bit of vanilla --- THE PIE CRUST: To the cook from West virginia who commented on the softness of the dough after coming out of the food processor... I made this crust twice because I had the same thing happen on the first try. It's basically the result of overmixing the dough in the food processor and the friction generating enough heat to melt the butter and shortening. When this happens, the cooked crust seems to come out more like a tender shortbread rather than a flaky pie crust. I disregarded the mixing directions on the second try... I made a second batch by hand instead of in the food processor, making sure my shortening and butter were VERY VERY cold, and the resulting consistency was totally different. It was difficult to roll out without tearing, but the result was a much flakier crust. Patching the tears with loose pieces worked fine. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Being the lazy chef that I am sometimes, I usually just make a regular Crisco crust to go with this recipe. The filling varries depending on the humidity and the ripness of the fruit, so I usually wind up adding cornstartch if the berries I use are frozen or very ripe. Not only does this a beautiful finished product, but its very yummy too. A great use of rhubarb.

Rating: 3
This is a great pie! I have made this exact recipe twice, and both times I found the crust to be VERY soft and difficult to work with -- but extremely tender and delicious! I only used 5 tablespoons of water, and still the crust was like soft frosting when I first scooped it out of the food processor. But if you roll it out in a coolish room immediately after removing it from the frist -- work quickly! -- it works fine. It may need patching, but that's OK because it's such a tender crust to begin with. I liked the suggestion of adding a pinch or two of nutmeg to the filling, too. Bravo for this recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made two pies. One for home and one for a party. I should have broght both to the party. I felt so bad, several guests brough deserts that didn't even get touched!

This pie is so easy to make especially if you use a ready made crust. I would suggest using the tapioca to thicken the pie filling as the fresh fruit create excess liquid. I substituted blueberries for rhubarb for July 4th party and it went over big!

As a novice pie-baker, I would definitely recommend this recipe. The crust turned out very well and was not difficult to maneuver or roll out. As berry pies tend to be a bit runny, I was pleased that this set well after cooling and was a perfect blend of tart and sweet.

I have to add to the compliments about this pie. It really is lovely, especially with local grown incredibly sweet strawberries. After reading the reviews, I was very cautious with how much water I added (about 5 tbsp) and probably ended up not adding enough. The crust tasted divine, amazingly flaky, but didn't hold together all that well. I had to do a lot of patching before I was able to put the fruit in. Also, baking time seemed fine to me, I just kept an eye on it.

Fantastic! I admit I did bake the pie for the twenty minutes at 400, at which point I covered it with foil, lowered the temperature to 350 and baked it for another forty-five minutes. The brown sugar really makes the recipe. I too might try it with vanilla next time.

The recipe calls for baking for a total of one hour and 45 minutes, 20 minutes at 400 and one hour and 25 minutes at 350. This is much too long. My pie came out badly burned. The recipe as listed on the internet site must be in error.

I felt in need of a pick-me-up today, so logged on to find a recipe for a pie. This one caught my eye, mainly because of all the favorable reviews, so I tried it. I made it in no time flat, and by lunchtime, my husband and I were enjoying our pieces of pie. This is a really great recipe. Many thanks to Lorrie for her tapioca tip. I never knew how to thicken fruit's juices without getting that starchy, flour-y taste, but now I do. Worked beautifully, and now I have a way to use up that box of tapioca that's been sitting in my cupbord since the beginning of time! Anyway, do make this pie-- foolproof, and, as mentioned, the crust really is to die for.

Absolutely delicious. I served this at a Memorial Day bbq, and it was gobbled up in no time. Many who claimed they did not like rhubarb came to me for the recipe.

Is there anything that says spring better than strawberries, rhubarb, and pie? I think not-- and this was a wonderful way to showcase the season's bounty. The crust is possibly the most flaky I've ever eaten, lovely and delicate. I used lard in place of the shortening, which may have done the trick. I didn't even bother to lattice the dough, though I'm sure it would have been gorgeous. Be careful adding the water-- I used only six tablespoons, and it was almost too much. One of best things about this recipe is that the dough turns out to be more than enough, so there's no need to skimp. I covered my pie with foil at point where you're supposed to lower the temperature of the oven. While the pie baked, however, part of the edge kind of drooped off, and fell into the oven. Any ideas why? Oh well, it still looked wonderful, and the filling was likewise divine (I used tapioca instead of the cornstarch, which I find masks the flavor of the fruit too much). I'm sure to make this one again (perhaps with a teaspoon or so of vanilla, as suggested).

This was excellent!! Added the little bit of nutmeg to the filling. Delicious and pies are not one of my strong points. Pastry - very easy! Had some for breakfast it was do good, it's fruit!

This pie rocks!!! I made it over the weekend and brought a piece to my 83-year-old grandmother and she said next week when I visit I should not bother if I don't have another piece for her to eat! As another cook suggested, I added a sprinking of nutmeg to the filling and about a Tsp. extra of sugar. Excellent combo with the sweet crust and tart filling. I'm planning on making this pie again this weekend, maybe with a crumb topping.

Strawberry rhubarb pie is a favorite of my husband and I. This recipe is one we'll use again. We had good, deep pink, slender rhubarb stalks and skimped slightly on the sugar - fantastic.

My husband I and both thought this was an absolutely delicious pie. I used a different crust recipe which was very good, but next time I will try the crust recipe given here. And there WILL be a next time. This pie was a huge success!

I baked this pie for my husbands birthday and used leftover rhubarb, strawberries and (1 1/2 cups) apricots. It was absolutly delicious.

This was one of the best pies ever. For those of you who think that strawberry-rhubarb pie is usually too sweet, this one will not disappoint. I like tart pies, but my instinct said to add an addtional tablespoon of sugar and I'm glad I did. Since my most reliable pie cookbook, "Farm Journal's Complete Pie Cookbook," calls for small pieces of butter sprinkled over the top of the fruit mixture, I did just that. I also added a light grating of nutmeg to the dry ingredients, as I often do with rhubarb pie. By the way, the pie was just fine using a prepared pie crust from Pillsbury. When my dining companion left, I ate another piece of pie, and plan to have more for my breakfast. Oh, my.

I thought this recipe was great and so easy. I love to bake but I don't make pies often and this recipe has me looking for other pie recipes. The only problem was the crust. It came out so delicious but if you dont keep it chilled and use it right away it tends to fall apart. Needless to say my pie had some "patch work" done to it, but well worth the effort. I will make this again and maybe next time add some vanilla to enhance the flavors.

A delicious and easy pie. I will definitely make it again.

A good pie recipe that I built upon with a tip I got from cooking.com. ;-) Instead of flour or cornstarch, I used uncooked tapioca as the thickening agent. I also used fresh strawberries rather than frozen, which are especially good in the summer and readily available year round. This pie came out sweet but not overly so, perfect with whipped cream or ice cream.

I _never_ bake because it stresses me out... But I made this pie, (using strawberries that I had just picked-yum!), and it came out unbelievably well! My boyfriend was totally impressed, and so was I. I'll definitely make this again!

Every year when rhubarb is fresh and ripe I make this pie. Friends and family RAVE about it everytime. It's so easy to make! The lattice top crust looks fantastic and makes everyone think you're such a gourmet cook.

Well... I was craving a strawberry-rhubarb pie, so when I had to take something to a summer potluck, I made it. BUT.. before I got a bite of it, it was all gone. It looked beautiful, and I guess it was delicious, since it was all gone in a matter of minutes. I will make it again real soon. Definitely cut back on the water in the crust by 5 Tablespoons, at least. I can't wait to try it!

This is definitely a winner, but watch out adding the water to the dough. I only used 4 Tablespoons and it was almost too much! Also, the crust can get a little overbrown baking so long, so I tented it with tin foil when it was as brown as I wanted it. I did have a problem with juice oozing out the top, so it wasn't quite as perfect looking as I would have liked. Nobody seemed to care. My husband raved about it for days.

EXCELLENT!!! Rhubarb pies are so often too sweet, and this one was just right. The crust is wonderful too! Next time I will add the water a little at a time, because the dough was a bit too moist. But otherwise, absolutely perfect.

I did not try the pie but my husband loved it. He told me that the crust was the best I've made so far. This is the third pie crust recipe that I've tried and I'll definitely use it again.

Wow!! This pie is delicious and quite easy to make. The crust is incredibly flaky--the first one I've made from scratch. My roommates also gave this recipe a thumbs up. Definitely high on my dessert recipe list.

This was the first Strawberry-Rhubarb pie that I ever made too, and it was just perfect. My father-in-law loved it! So did the rest of the family. Not too sweet, not too tart. Would be good using cherries instead of strawberries.

This was the first strawberry-rhubarb pie I ever made, and it was spectacular! The lattice (I wove it traditionally) was gorgeous, and the fruit bubbling up in the spaces was a brilliant red color. The pastry was easy to work with, and made a generous amount. The taste was incredible--my husband said it was the first strawberry-rhubarb pie he ever had that wasn't sour or bitter. I won't be looking for another recipe like this, since this one is perfect (this is the highest compliment from me, a compulsive searcher for the best recipe for everything)

On the spur of the moment(after our neighbour brought over a substantial bag of cut rhubarb - to go with our fresh strawberries) it was a crowd pleaser!! We didn't lattice the top and we used a larger portion of rhubarb than strawberries, but the 4 pies went quickly with rave reviews.

I made this pie for my daughter-in-law's birthday at her request as her favorite pie. It looked just beautiful and tasted great especially warm, served with fresh whipped cream... yummy. However, I would not make the crust again as it was overly dry and tasteless. Maybe needs some ground nuts, like almonds in it. Also it was very difficult to manage the dough, being so dry. With all the problems, it came out a success and my mouth is watering for more just thinking about it!

I never used a recipe for making a strawberry-rhubarb pie before and I found yours and it was an excellent pie. I had made it for my mother for mother's day and had a little left over for a tart for myself, and it was excellent in all aspects!!
