Brought these to a Super Bowl party last year. They were gone before the dish hit the table. I'm making them again this year. Will add some parmesan to the mixture this time.

This recipe is improved with the addition of parmesan cheese to the mixture before adding it to the pastry. It gives it more flavor. I added about a quarter cup. I served it at a happy hour and everyone loved it. I also sprinkled parmesan over the egg wash on the outside.

I just made these appetizers this evening and after having a few of them I have to say that they are boring! I LOVE appetizers and this recipe falls short for me. Bummer!

Whenver I make these everyone loves them; I have been making them since Christmas of 1995. I have made them up to baking and then wrapped in plastic, then foil and frozen. They come out great after defrosting, cutting up and baking.

Great for a casual football party or get together. It is not special enough for a fancy cocktail party.

I made this for my neighborhood dinner club. It was a hit! My husband said he liked it more than any part of the meal, although everything was delicious.

I added some finely shredded italian mixed cheese to the top of the sausage mixture before closing the dough and served without the marinara. A huge hit with everyone!! Also, I couldn't find puff pastry dough, so I used Pillsbury crescent roll dough and it was quite good.

These were even good the next day cold...right out of the fridge...tasted a lot like cold pizza, if you like that thing.

Jetlagged with barren kitchen, I found this recipe to make for a neighborhood party. I forgot to buy puff pastry store and improvised. Instead, I made a big batch of pizza dough and made mini-calazones with the meat. Very popular but the marinara sauce was essential. Next time, I'll try adding a little cheese.

I was looking for a simple British sausage roll recipe, but found this one and tried it. I used chicken sausage with tomato and romano cheese. The only difficulty I found was that my sausage mixture was a little runny. Even after about 30 minutes of chilling it was difficult to cut it into small pieces. I wonder if I did something wrong. Otherwise everything else was fine and it was delicious.

This is so incredibly easy! I did everything in the food processor: grated the bread, mixed in the milk, added the sausage ... I didn't even chop the onion before throwing it in. I also didn't roll out the pastry, I just unfolded it. Normally, I dislike the texture of Italian sausage, but I enjoyed these because I was able to grind it smooth. This recipe lends itself to experimentation with different kind of sausage and different varieties of dips: mustards and chutneys.

These are a very filling heavy starter. Great for Super Bowl or chili party. The puff pastry browns beautifully. Use the best sausage available.

I only had patty shells in the freezer so I used five of them and rolled them out and followed the rest of the recipe. They were good looking and delicious. I gave each person a tiny bowl of marinara sauce for dipping and a little lobster fork. They ate every bite!

Wonderful appetizer !! I took this to a block party Sunday and there wasn't anything left !! It's very, very good... next time, I'll try and make them smaller as they were quite large. Anyway, they were delicious and I definitely recommend them !!
