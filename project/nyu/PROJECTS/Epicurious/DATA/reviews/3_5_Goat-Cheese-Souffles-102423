I made it with half boucheron and half regular goat cheese. Didn't rise, maybe I didn't beat the eggs enough, ate them twice-baked, very tasty!

We made these for a dinner party appetizer, served with a side of roasted beets. It might have been the souffle, beet combo, but they were incredible. We also have made the Twice-baked garlic souffle and the Jalapeno cheddar souffle. This was my favorite but they are all very good. It's hard to beat something with butter, cheese and cream. :)

No big deal. only OK...does not let the taste of the goat cheese shine through....may be better with a different cheese...there are much better recipes for goat apptzr...such as the 3 layer torte!

These were good but I will stick with three cheese souffles. The nice thing was, they reheat very well.

Although this recipe states that it serves 6, that would be 6 light eaters, or 6 luncheon servings. I used larger ramekins and served 4 for dinner. A wonderful souffle for goat cheese lovers. Added 2 tablespoons of chives for fun. I've made this 3 times now and can report that it really does reheat nicely for a do- ahead dish.

Instead of breadcrumbs, I used finely ground walnuts to coat the ramekins. It adds a nice touch, and making a vinagrette wiht half olive oil and half walnut oil compliments the dish These are easy, and the do ahead works so well, it's a perfect luncheon dish

An easy souffle recipe, good for beginners and cooks like me who seldom make souffles. Instead of Montrachet I used Boucheron - rind and all - a semi-aged goat cheese that's somewhat stronger than Montrachet (don't use Boucheron unless you already know you and your guests are goat cheese fans). Had no whole milk so faked it by whisking 1/3 c. 2% milk with 1/3 c. light sour cream. Used a standard souffle dish and followed the further instructions of early reviewer Steve and it was perfect. Great texture, wonderful savory souffle. Had no greens, served with tart green apple slices.

These were easy and incredible! Reading all the notes helped. As I was just preparing to fill the ramekins, my neighbor called to invite herself to my dinner party; I switched to smaller ramekins, no problem. I served them reheated atop a salad of field greens, sliced tart apples, walnuts and a truffle viniagrette (whisk together 4 Tblsp truffle oil, 3 Tblsp extra-virgin olive oil, 2 Tblsp champagne or pear balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp sea salt, black pepper). Sublimely light yet rich!

I made this recipe as a test for a buffet dinner I will be making next month. They were delicious. I did the twice baked version. As directed after they were baked I put them on a buttered baking sheet and put in the refrigerator. They stuck just a little bit, so next time I will make sure it is very well buttered. I re-warmed them and they were perfect. I had one left over and microwaved it the next day and it was still very good. A little flatter. For the buffet I will use 4oz ramekins.

Very easy, delicious and impressive dish. Because there are not really any other ingredients to detract, the flavor of the goat cheese is highlighted. I made the recipe as written and served the individual souffles on a bed of field greens tossed with olive oil and pear vinegar, then sprinkled walnuts and garnished with slices of a sweet, ripe pear. Wonderful and elegant!

Delicious! Fun dish for a first course. This was a very easy recipe with great results. I served with a balsamic vinaigrette which was ok. I think it would be very tasty with a katamata olive vinaigrette. I also added an extra ounce of cheese as it was packaged in 6oz. Also for my non goat cheese loving guest I added jack to the top of their souffle and none of the crumbled goat. He loved it, wanted more.

This recipe was easy to make for a dinner party, beautiful to present and delicious. I made four individual souffles instead of six and served it as a first course with dressed baby greens on the side. I thought they might be too big, but there were no leftovers at all. A big hit and so easy to prepare, refrigerate, and reheat at the last minute. I will definitely make it again.

I also made this in a standard souffle dish, at 350 convection for 25 minutes (in water bath) Made it twice in 2 weeks in fact--very easy, very good. Only problem is there isn't enough for seconds! How do I double it?

I made this in a 6 qt. souffle dish - baked at 375 in a convection oven for 25 minutes - it was fabulous. Served with braised pork chops and a salad of baby greens, pecans, blue cheese, & dried cranberries with a raspberry viniagrette...WOW!
