Followed other reviewers advice - added a small onion; substituted tinned tomatores; splash of red wine and used parmesan topping. Very nice (not dry). Quick and easy to do.

Probably the best aspect of this gratin is that its one of the few very good vegan recipes on this site. The beans contributed solid creaminess, and the zucchini and tomato added a nice flavor. I would increase the quantity of spices in the recipe considerably, and include at least 1/3 cup more bread crumbs. I didn't find this dry like other reviewers.

Followed other reviewers suggestions and added: onion to saute with celery, sun dried tomatoes and oregano. Used canned diced tomatoes, drained. Added grated parmesan to dish and to topping. Husband said "it's a keeper!" Probably 3.5 forks, truth be told.

Easy to make, with great results. Added sun-dried tomatoes as well as some more regular tomatoes; used panko vs. regular bread crumbs.

This is really a sublime and elegant side dish. I don't know why they say not to use cannellini beans; they work just fine. I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes.

I loved this recipe.I found it to be very tasty, but I did add a few more tomatoes because I had them on hand. I am vegetarian and can't wait to share it with my vegetarian friends.

Dry but otherwise great ingredients. Adding cheese would make less healthy but much more tasty!

This recipe serves as a good inspiration for zucchini-tomato gratins made with ingredients other than what is called for in the recipe. Since I made this at the last minute without time to shop I omitted the celery and used one can of garbanzo beans rather than white beans. It was the perfect summer side dish -- flavorful (not too garlicky), colorful, and fresh-tasting. It was not dry at all, and the topping really makes the recipe.

In light of previous reviewers' "dry" comments, I made the following changes and liked the non-dry results: drained but did not rinse beans, used canned chopped tomatoes (especially in the winter!), added a small finely diced onion when sauteing the celery, and baked for 40, not 45 minutes. I also cut back the garlic to 4 cloves, as this garlic lover believes 8 would be overpowering. I used 1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled as the spice. Delicious, and the leftovers are great, too.

Prep time good, Taste good, but seemed a bit dry to the point of pasty. The family enjoyed the dish!

We found this dish delicious. I made one change, replacing the canned beans with dried beans that had been soaked over night then simmered until tender. I think this gives a lovely nutty, crunchy flavour to the dish.

Less than fabulous.

I have already made this dish twice - once as a side dish for a roast beef at a dinner party, where everyone raved! And another time just for my family. Leftovers make for an excellent lunch the next day. The garlic flavor is truly intense, so if you don't like garlic, use a little less than the recipe requests.
