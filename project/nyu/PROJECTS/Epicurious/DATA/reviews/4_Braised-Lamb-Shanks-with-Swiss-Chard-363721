So I typically make Curtis Stone's lamb shank recipe from the Take Home Chef website (tlc.com/recipe) and, based on the reviews, I figured I give this one a shot. Honestly, Curtis' recipe is better because of the more complex flavor in the sauce, but this one is very good and deserves a second place lamb shank rating in my book. I followed the recipe pretty closely (doubled the broth b/c my family typically loves sauces; this worked out very well) and substituted the bulgur for potatoes as other reviews recommended. The potatoes worked wonderfully and we particularly liked the raisins in the sauce. I don't think I'll make this as often as I do Curtis' recipe, but I'll definitely add chard to that recipe in the future.

It was good the first night but FABULOUS the second as leftovers. I think the saffron is essential. The sauce was a bit thick before I cooked the chard (I didnt cook the ribs). So I added another can of tomatoes with the juice. I liked it better the second night with brown rice than smashed small red potatoes as one reviewer suggested. I will try it with cracked wheat next time.

One of the best dishes I have ever made. Very easy and delicious (ratio of deliciousness to effort is very high). Substituted kale for the Swiss chard. Omitted the saffron the first time, included it the second time; didn't notice a big difference. One thing I'd recommend is to follow the recipe pretty closely with regard to the amount of liquid--too much liquid and you'll get a stew rather than a braise. Will definitely make again.

Made this for an in-home catered dinner for 6 - lovely spiced winter dish. However, even at less than 1 lb each, the shanks were intimidating on the plate and not one was more than halfway eaten - if plating, I would look for smaller cuts. Remember to salt accordingly!

Made this recipe twice. Once for 4, the second time for 6 as part of a Valentine's Day wine dinner. Flavors in this dish are in a word, Outstanding! Just a couple of recomendations: first, had my reservations on the Bulgur as the go with so the first time I made this I boiled some red potatoe and did a rough mash.... no milk or butter, just smashed em up and used them as the base to place the shanks on. The Swiss Chard / Sauce mixture went on top of that. Also tried it with the Bulger. No contest, the smashed potatoe wins. Second, the liquid portion of the recipe is fine for 4 shanks in a smaller braising pan. For six, in a large roasting pan you will need to double the tomatoe and broth portions and adjust the seasonings accordingly. Other than that, a truly wonderfull dish !

Outstanding as written. I used less lamb than called for (less people) but kept the sauce amount the same. I couldn't have been more pleased with the results- I can't wait to make these again! This is a really easy, hands off recipe with outstanding results.

this recipe is absolutely delicious; it resulted in the tastiest lamb shanks i can recall! i followed the recipe as written, with the exception of using kale instead of swiss chard, because that is what the grocery store had. this will be my go-to recipe for lamb shanks from now on.

Fantastic meal, I did do a number of thing a little differently. Because there were only three of us, I only use three shanks. I choose to make this in my le creuset french oven, 3 shanks fit perfectly in my 13 quart. I did NOT reduce the recipe by half but kept it as written was glad I did, the portions worked out great. I also choose to skip the chard ribs, as previously they have been too bitter for my taste. I added the chard leaves after the last green onion addition, put it in the oven for 5 minutes uncovered then placed it on the stove top on low, simmering everything covered for another 5 minutes.

Absolutely delicious!! It made the perfect Valentine dinner for the two of us. The total weight of my six lamb shanks was 1.5 lbs. and I used the full amount of the braising sauce ingredients. I used Lacinato kale instead of the swiss chard and omitted the cooking of the stalks on the stove (I felt kale stalks would be too tough), just added the kale and the remaining green onions the last 30 mins in the oven. Start to finish about 3 hours. We will be having this again!!

I was a bit skeptical of such a varied amount of tastes, but the result was delicious.

Very, very tasty. Perhaps my lamb shanks were larger than the recipe called for, but they needed more cooking time for the meat to fall off the bones. I made the full recipe the day before serving to let the flavors meld, as suggested. We ate half the first night. I took the meat off the bones after the first night and cooked it some more in the rich sauce . . . even better the next day, with melt-in-your-mouth lamb. Finally, with the last bits, added some leftover rice, cooked until very soft . . . and it became a most delicious hearty soup!!! AMAZING with the additional cooking time and in the various forms!

I prepared this recipe for 2, but I only halved the sauce ingredients. Half way through the cooking, I added the rest of the can of beef broth, as I thought the sauce was thickening up too much. It wasn't hard to spoon off the fat. I used kale instead of Swiss Chard, but I did keep the same cooking time. I didn't cook it uncovered. We had it with rice. The aroma was heavenly, particularly on a blizzard day as today! The lamb came out very tender and flavorful.
