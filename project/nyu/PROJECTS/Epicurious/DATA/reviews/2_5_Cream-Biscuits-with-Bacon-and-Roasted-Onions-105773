it was a little dry when i frist made these biscuits, but the second time around, i added some shredded cheddar to the mix and it tasted great! also, its very easy to over work this recipe.

Soft and tender, full of flavor. A classic.

These were just okay biscuits. True- with a name like that these biscuits should be better. The flavor was nice only because of the roasted bacon and onions but it seemed a little dry.

Not bad. The key to the light biscuits is not to overwork the dough at all! These were crumbly and light, but the flavor seemed a little lacking.

The name of these biscuits sounds far more impressive than the end result. The biscuits have a nice flavor thanks to the bacon and roasted onions; however, they fail to rise or brown. The end result is a flat, doughy, pale biscuit. I would not reccommend this recipe.
