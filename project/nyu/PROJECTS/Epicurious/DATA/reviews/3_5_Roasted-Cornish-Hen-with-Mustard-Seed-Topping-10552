Didn't like mustard seeds (texture), and they mostly fell off.

this was SO simple yet SO tasty. i made a few changes: i used 1.75 lbs. chicken thighs (with the bone in). i didn't have any rosemary, so i substituted dried sage (used 2 teaspoons), used 3 garlic cloves instead of 1, and used mustard powder instead of mustard seeds. i can't wait to try it again. i'd give it five forks if i could!

Easy and quick recipe. Have your butcher split the hen at the store. I made it with the gravy, but found I liked the results better without - the skin is crisp and tasty.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's easy, delicious, and it takes almost no time to make. My only suggestion is to broil the hens without the mustard seed for two minutes, add the mustard seeds and then broil for the remaining two minutes. The mustard seeds burn easily if left to broil for 4 minutes.

I have made this recipe four or five times a week for the past two months, often substituting 2 chicken brined chicken legs for the cornish hen. To the mustard mixture, I substitute 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary or thyme; alternately, I have used 1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence. I also add 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar to thin the mustard mixture. This recipe is delicious. In ways both large and small the making of this dish over the past two months has changed my life.

I'm not much of a cook, but when I attempted this one, it turned out fabulous! It's easy and tastes great!

Absolutely delicious!! Unlike most of the other reviewers, I had/used the mustard seed. Next time I will try it with the mustard powder because it was very difficult to keep the seeds from burning in the broiler AND get crispy skin. Sauce is delicious, and next time I will make extra.

Yum yum yum! I didn't have the seeds, so I substituted mustard powder. It's dishes like this that make cooking exciting.

This was a great quick dish. The butterflying not only cuts the cooking time almost in half, but also makes serving much easier. These small birds can be awkward to cut neatly. I had some unexpected guests and made it - got rave reviews. My hubby loves it too. I have made it again twice since then. I didn't have mustard seed the first time so I just added some dry mustard powder it went wonderfully with the rosemary and other herbs. If you don't have any wine, just substitute chicken broth - it works just as well, but with a milder flavor.

I marinated the birds with this, stuffing the seeds/herbs under the skin, then grilled them. Very good!

Why did I wait so long to try this? It's easy, quick, and lends itself well to improvization. Out of mustard seeds, but used grainy dijon. Took a hint from the previous reviewer, using herbes de Provence simply because it sounded interesting. I'm sure rosemary would be good too, as would tarragon. Doubled the recipe, using 2 pans, then pouring the juices into one of them to make the sauce. Will definitely make it again.

This was a simple, quick dish to make. I was suprised at how quick it cooked. Butterflying the hens makes the difference I think. I did not have mustard seed, so I just used dijon mustard. I presume the seeds would make the skin crustier when placed under the broiler. I thought it was pretty good just w/the mustard and spices. Also I subsituted Herbs de Provence. Print this one out for the recipe file.
