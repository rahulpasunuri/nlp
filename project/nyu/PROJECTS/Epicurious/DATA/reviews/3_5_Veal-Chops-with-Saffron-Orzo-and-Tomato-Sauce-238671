Made this in about 30 minutes on a week night-- very tasty. Two key things, however: Definitely use a high-quality veal chop. The veal we used had a lot of connective tissue and the cooking process just isn't long enough to break it down into anything edible. Second, instead of adding sugar to the tomatoes, try balsamic vinegar. The sweetness cuts the tartness of the tomatoes and adds a nice, nuanced layer to the flavors. We did add red pepper flakes because we generally like food a little on the spicy side. Only three forks, however, because even with doubled saffron, the orzo just tasted like butter and parm on noodles-- an awfully expensive starch.

This is relatively quick and easy, but seems so decadent. Good for a dinner party. However, I agree with the rest of the reviews that the tomatoes by themselves just were too acidic. I added in some sugar and if I make this again I'll add in many more Italian spices. The orzo was absolutely decadent and amazing.

For a quick dinner with relatively few ingredients this is excellent. I gave it only 3 stars because it isn't something you might serve to your boss.

This recipe is superb with only a few minor changes. 3 minutes per side high heat max for 6-7 oz "supermarket" chops then transfer to covered heated plate. Deglaze pan and garlic with 1/2 C Marsala (it will flame) then add 1 scant Tbs rosemary and 2 pints tomatoes. Keep on high so tomatoes start to blister (6 min) then crush with potato masher. As the tomato mix is a bit tart add 1 Tbs sugar and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (a must) and simmer 6 more min. Add chops and juice to pan and low simmer while the orzo cooks. Up the butter to 3 Tbs and the parm to 1 oz for the orzo and you have a quick, simply DIVINE dish!

I made this using lamb chops and instead of the orzo, I simply did broccoli & cheese rice-a-roni. Not so gourmet, yes, but it was a hit with my 3-year-old. It brought a bit of summer into the end of winter.

Overall very bland. I definitely don't suggest wasting time on this one.

amazing, cooked longer and with more wine at the end, added orzo to tomatoes before adding chops back, excellent flavors

Because we have scruples about eating veal, we prepared this recipe with very lean pork cutlets and served with a tossed green salad w/ balsalmic vinegrette! I would add a tsp of sugar next time if the tomatoes are as tart as these were. Otherwise, delicious! (Items that complimented this meal were "Just Tomatoes" brand sun-dried tomatoes and plain chevre cheese in the salad and warmed ACME green onion flat bread.)

Fantastic and fast..would make a couple of changes next time...Double the tomato preparation, meaning as is not enough sauce. I made with two nice thick veal chops and two pints of tomatoes...returned the chops to the pot to get them to med-rare. Served the chops on top of the orzo like you would for Osso Bucco over Risotto Milanese. This looks great on plate without alot of attention - good choice for dinner party.
