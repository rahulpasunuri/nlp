This was really tasty. I added a chopped shallot to the butter before adding the orzo and mixed in some chopped fresh spinach at the end. It made a really yummy, fairly healthy dinner. I should also mention that I used half the amount of butter and half-and-half in place of cream, and it still turned out very creamy. A definite keeper!

I cut every corner there was to cut in this recipe - turkey bacon, skim milk, and light butter - and my boyfriend said it was in his top 5 of things I've ever made. I didn't have fresh thyme, only dried, and wouldn't use low-salt chicken broth any time. Easy, quick, tasty, and usually have the ingredients on hand. Will definitely make again. Needs quite a bit of pepper in my opinion and added onion and garlic when I added the butter, as suggested in the other reviews. Top notch recipe.

This was suprisingly delicious! I added a couple grilled shrimp on top yummy!

Why hello, gooey, mushy, cheesy, creamy, bacon-y goodness! This is such a guilty pleasure comfort food. Definitely best served right away, super hot, or else it becomes orzo cement. But what tasty cement it is.

L love this recipe - super easy and very good! I don't make it too often, though, because of the fat.

I disappointed in this recipe. In all, it was pretty bland. Also, once the orzo soaked up the chicken broth, it was like glue!

I doctored the recipe considerably, adding garlic, sauteed onions, cherry tomatoes and peas, and still found it incredibly bland. I ended up adding raw egg and a tablespoon of dijon mustard. Tasted ok but wouldn't go out of my way to make this recipe again.

I decided to deviate a little with this recipe and have mixed feelings about the changes. I substituted penne for orzo, and I think penne doesn't quite absorb the flavor of the chicken stock as well. I also used just regular chicken broth, making this wayy to salty. Definitely stick with the low-salt broth. And the grate Parmesan cheese didn't melt well for me...they formed inconsistent lumps. But despite it all, it still tasted pretty good. But I think next time I want to try a different recipe with more sweetness and a lighter tasting salt. That probably makes more time and $$ so this carbonara recipe is good for someone looking to cook quickly and to buy fewer ingredients!

Yumm, yumm, yummy! I also halved the recipe, and added peas... soo good and easy!

I added onions, garlic and peas. And I halved the recipe.

VERY good recipe! I agree that adding chicken and asparagus really makes this dish. I would skip the sundried tomatoes as recommended by someone else, in my opinion the flavors don't blend too well!

This was very good. I used country ham instead of bacon. We've made it numerous times.

This is a very good recipe if you're tired of the same old-same old. I served it with a tarragon chicken cooked in a clay pot, and fresh green beans mixed with toasted almonds and butter. The 3 dishes went very well together. Tastes very good left over, too.

Maybe my cooking stars were aligned this night but I thought this recipe was fantastic, So much Flavor! Was it all the fat? I don't care, these days don't happen too often!

I really liked this dish the first time I made it (with the addition of chopped onion and garlic, as another reviewer suggested) and have since made it a few times with other tweaks such as using pancetta instead of bacon. I also think it's perfectly good with light cream. It's been a big hit with company, served as a side dish with pork chops or chicken. Very easy to make. And yes, definitely about 15 minutes to cook the orzo.

Company worthy!! Followed recipes with note that orzo thats nearly 20 minutes to cook not 8 minutes.

Fun recipe to play with -- In addition to what is called for in recipe, cook boneless chicken breasts in T. of reserved bacon fat. Remove breasts when done, then add butter. Add orzo, stirring for about a minute and a half before adding the chicken broth. After most of broth is absorbed, add tips of two bunches asparagus tips to steam in the orzo. (I use the stems for stir fry, omelets, or soup later.) After all broth is absorbed, add cream and 1/4c. sliced sun dried tomatoes (packed in oil, but drained) and the sliced chicken breasts. Shaved parmesan goes on top to serve. Very tasty.

couple more things: i use half and half and it tastes great. i've also used many shapes of pasta, and they all come out great, and make a bigger-looking bowl :) you might want to add all 5 cups of broth intead of the 4&1/2 if you use something bigger than orzo, and stir often...also a tiny pinch of dried thyme is enough if you don't have fresh.

i've made this many times...i've tweaked it a bit: (same recipe, w/ these additions/changes) cook one chopped onion in 1T of the bacon fat with 1 T of butter for several minutes, then add one clove chopped garlic for one minute. then add 1 box of rotini instead of orzo, and it cooks in 8 minutes. then i add toasted bread crumbs as garnish on each plate(recipe on epicurious). leftovers: i heat them up in a bowl in the microwave with a little water or broth, mix well, add more parmesan - yum!

I hope no one is mad - I made a change to this - veggie bacon. My hubbie is a vegetarian and I had folks who are Kosher over for dinner. To compensate for the lack of fat that would have been created; I melted a bit of butter and then put in olive oil. Everyone raved!!!! To help the cooking along (8 minutes is not even close) I covered the pan about 95% - that got the broth boiling and cooking. This is a make again for sure!

I used carbonara instead of bacon and added some garlic & onions to the butter, also some sliced mushrooms later on. It was fantastic! People were fighting over the leftovers. Yum!

This is an excellent and easy dish. I added peas one time and mushrooms another. I also add quite a bit more of parmesan than the recipe calls for.

I made a half recipe for my family of seven and it was just enough as a side dish. I did add a finely minced large clove of garlic to the bacon when it was half way done. Incredible!

this was fabulous!!! I took the tip from someone else and added onions to the butter--good idea. Also agree that the orzo takes more like 20 minutes rather than 8. This was a hit with everyone---make extra

Rating: 3
GREAT stuff! My only comment is that it took more than 8 minutes to cook down the liquid. Closer to 20 minutes - but the pasta wasn't at all mushy because of it. I made the recipe a second time, thinking perhaps I needed a higher simmer. Nope - still took about 15 minutes.

We liked this a lot, though we had to make adjustments to lower the fat content -- used turkey bacon, margerine, and whole milk and it still tasted delicious. It's very easy and quick to make.

Although good, this dish was not great. Also, there was too much of it. I should have halved it.

Rating: 3
Really good - and REALLY rich - but REALLY good! Only "improvement" I made was that I added 3 tablespoons of chopped onion and sauted it for 2-3 minutes in the butter before adding the orzo. It made a big difference. Would never make it without this one small addition. Try it.

Excellent. A hit with the kids. Try turkey bacon to make the fat content less daunting. No leftovers with this one.

This is quite a good recipe, tasty and not difficult to prepare. The downside to it was that it made both my husband and I simultaneously crave two of my other mainstay dishes--classic spaghetti carbonara and risotto alla contadina--because it is reminiscent of both without being quite as good as either one. I think I'd cook either of those before making this again. But it was worth a try to satisfy my curiosity!

Excellent, easy recipe, but be careful not to overcook the orzo !

This recipe is delicious, if rather fattening. I added chopped asparagas with the orzo and let the broth cook the vegetable. Both times I have made this, I brought the pasta, vegetable and broth to a boil then simmered with lid. It took about 20-30 minutes for the orzo to absorb the broth. Where does this cook get 8 minutes? I also skipped the heavy cream with no ill effects. So I guess you could call this more of a risotto than a carbonara. But it's a delicious dish nonetheless.

I thought this was ok the night I had it, but the leftovers the next day really shined! I think that the extra time to meld the flavors really worked to the benefit of this dish.. I would definitely do this recipe again...

Excellent. I made twice in one week and both times I served it to guests and everyone agreed that it was a special recipe.
