I made a quarter of this recipe Labor Day - really good and quite easy. I took reviewers advice and processed the bacon with the onion, horseradish (more than called for), salt and pepper then mashed it with the cheese. I had 16 party sour dough bread slices and it was perfect. Instead of freezing as suggested, I toasted the bread for about 5 minutes before topping with the cheese mixture. Baked for about 15 - 17 minutes - perfect.

I have made these several times and people love them.. A very '60's party food and absolutely delish!

Made this on english muffin bread and used microwave bacon which I cooked and chopped. Served right from the oven- gone in a flash!

Made revisions based on other reviewers' suggestions to add flavor--i.e., more horseradish, garlic powder, used sour dough bread, but still lacked flavor. Also, need to be served immediately otherwise presentation and taste is bad. Good ingredients but disappointing results.

Two words for this recipe- delicious and easy! The only change I made was substituting wheat bread for rye. Everyone I serve this to, wants the recipe.

I made these for a large group of people and the consensus was that this recipe was alright, but definitely nothing special. I was just happy this was not the only thing I made. Very average.

Very easy to put together--thanks to previous reviewers for the suggestions of using cocktail sourdough bread and using the food processor. I made them for a cocktail party where I had several other hors d'oeuvres as well, and received the most positive comments about these--they were eaten as fast as I could get them out of the oven.

different recipe. you definitely have to cut the crusts off and bake this until it is crispy on top-the only drawback to this recipe was that it must be served right out of the oven-once it got cold, no one would touch it. It was okay, but was the only appetizer at my party that had leftovers...

The last reviewer is right on - these were just okay. Maybe adding more horseradish would help (?). You DON'T have to pre-cook the bacon. Chopped finely enough, it cooks in the oven's heat (thus 375 degrees) and leaves the crunch to the bread, not the bacon.

I would try one more time and may add more horseradish. Surprised that the raw bacon didn't leave grease. Some folks adored these but I thought they were just so/so.

It took a while, but I actually used regular white bread, cut off the crusts, and use a sharp, serrated knife to cut each slice in half all the way across. It made the bread thinner and the wonderful cheese mixture more prominent.

Out of this world!!!!! thank you... I substituted the bread for little coctail sour dough bread and after I took them from the freezer I cut them in triangles instead, I did not pre cook the bacon, you don't have to and it did not make it greasy, if anything it added to the flavor, what I did was threw it all in to the processor excluding the shredded cheese and it made like a nice spread with little pieces of the onion and bacon.. this recipe has so many flavors going on that you just don't taste one thing ... everyone loved it ! thank you, again

This dish was a big hit at a recent cocktail party. It was great to be able to prepare it well in advance. We added a dusting of garlic powder for a touch more flavor.

I made this with sourdough cocktail bread, which eliminated the need to cut regular size bread into smaller pieces, and it turned out great. My picky family liked it!

Very, very good. I did precook the bacon to remove most of the fat. However, they were DONE at 9-10 minutes - not 20. The smoke alarm was my first clue. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.

Absolutely fabulous! I made it for one gathering and it has been requested again and again. Everybody loves it. This is definitely the appetizer hit of the summer, and many people have requested the recipe. One terrific thing about it is that you can make it in advance and have it in the freezer, ready to go. Also, I cooked the bacon before hand - it seemed the safest thing to do. Two questions: how do you spread the mixture thinly? and what is the point of freezing before trimming?

These are delicious and simple to prepare. Next time I will omit the salt and put all the topping ingredients into the food processor to make the mixture more spreadable and to save time.

I made a 1/2 batch of this recipe, to test before guests, and it was GREAT! But I do have a question: what is the purpose of the "freezing until firm" before trimming crusts and cutting bread into quarters? Even the "Cooks' Notes" say that if you freeze these for a couple of weeks, you should thaw before baking. What gives? I did freeze as called for, but it didn't seem to "do" anything! ?

Outstanding and easy. My guests -- who are gourmets in their own right -- all want the recipe! And yes, the chopped bacon is not pre-cooked.

Help!! I need to make these this Friday (May 14. May I assume that the 1/2 # cold diced bacon is not pre-cooked when assembling the recipe?

I have a recipe very similar to this that I make all the time. The nice thing is you can make up a batch, freeze it on cookie sheets then put into gallon zip-locks or tupperware and freeze for a few months. Just cook alittle longer from the frozen state, until cheese is bubbly. Appetizers on hand whenever needed! (Great with some white wine)

I made these for my daughter's prom dinner. They passed the test with finnicky teen-agers. Instead of bacon I used some leftover ham I had on hand.
