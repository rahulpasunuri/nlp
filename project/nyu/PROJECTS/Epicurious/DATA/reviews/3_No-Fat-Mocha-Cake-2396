This cake got rave reviews from my family, especially when they heard it was no-fat. It is chocolatey enough to satisfy my craving, and it is moist and fudgy *as long as you don't over-bake it* I baked for 30 min and checked it every min after that, 33 was the magic number. Beat a tsp of instant coffee & 1/4 c. skim milk into a pkg of sugarfree vanilla pudding, served each slice with a dollop.

Easy to make but even if it made itself I am not sure I would bother eating it. I followed the recipe exactly, this is a spongey cake, kind of dry, not very exciting. I would rather indulge on one piece of delicious rich chocolate cake then eat a whole non fat cake. If you do make it add more coffee otherwise this is just a non fat chocolate cake.

I think all the critics have been rather harsh. This cake is FAT FREE and it's delicious. It's moist with a rich chocolate flavor, substantial and is the perfect accompaniment to "girls' night"--where women can indulge in dessert, laughter, and Grey's Anatomy. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream on the side

wow, my first 1-fork! after all the positive reviews, i thought this would produce a somewhat palatable cake. i'm not sure where the "rich and fudgy" description came from. it was like chocolate-scented packing material. i'm trying to watch calories, etc. as much as the next person, but this was not satisfying in the least. no coffee flavor, and a vague chocolate flavor. blech!

This was a suprisingly good cake and I loved the fact that was low fat-really rich and fudgy although I felt it could havedone with more coffee-I iced it with almond creamcheese frosting which was a great compliment for it

As far as low fat cakes go, this is very good. However I think it could use some kind of topping, maybe some frozen yoghurt on the side. Great texture.

Scrumptious. It is less sweet than other cakes, like another reviewer said, but it is rich. I couldn't help myself, I had 2 pieces! I used a tsp of International Coffee rather than espresso powder, and it gave it a nice flavor, not overwhelming. I also used a springform pan. Easy!

This was a great quick and easy dessert which was well received. The coffee flavoring made this cake less sweet and more flavorful than your average chocolate cake. I also added a low-fat cool whip based cappuccino frosting (see coolwhip website for recipe) that complemented it nicely.

This is one of my favorite lite cakes to make. I usually serve it with a dollop of lite Cool Whip to which I add a pinch of instant espresso. Keeps it low fat and adds just a little bit of cream flavor.

Not bad its got a nice flavour and it is moist. But when it cooled down it was a bit rubbery around the edges. But I would make it again because of the low fat contents.

A fabulous lo fat cake. Very moist. Good for casual dinner or supper.

This is an excellent recipe for a non-fat chocolate cake. My husband absolutely loved it and didn't miss the fat at all. I would have liked a glaze or whipped cream or ice cream(which sort of defeats the purpose, I know). It kept well for a few days in the fridge and didn't dry out, which I find a lot of fat free desserts do.
