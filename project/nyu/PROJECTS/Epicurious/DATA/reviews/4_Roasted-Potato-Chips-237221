These were great! I also added 2 tbsp. paprika and about 1/2 tbsp. of thyme and coriander cilantro. Also, I started out at 450 but the second time I put them in, I lowered the heat to 400 and 350 for the last 10 minutes since they were nice and crunchy on the outside :)

Potatoes started burning very quickly, and eventually were black. Never again.

Made with russets and served with steak. Kids loved them. I'd call them a garlicky home fry. I think you could make with sliced onions for a change. I accidentally added the garlic for the whole cooking time and turned out fine. Made the kitchen smell good!

Great side dish,easy. I added chili pepper when seasoning. Used a mandolin to get thin crispy chips. Served with curry dip.

Used Russets, and they were perfect! I find it easier to generously oil the pan, then lay down slices and use a brush to distribute some of pan oil onto top of potatoes. (One less bowl to clean too!) I didn't use garlic this time, but will definitely try next time. Served with Cheeseburgers.

Delicious! Used russet potatoes and only needed to bake for the first 25-30 minutes (size of my slices?). Kids gobbled them down.

A new take on the classic fried potato. Very easy and very good. Goes great with rib-eye steaks in red wine sauce. definitely make again.

Pretty tasty and very simple, but they were a bit too salty--I would cut the salt back to 3/4 t. next time.

Super easy and tasty. I made some substitutions and it still came out great. I used fingerling potatoes and garlic powder instead of actual garlic, though real garlic definitely would have been better. I also used sea salt and some rosemary. The smallest pieces of potato came out the crunchiest and were my favorite.
