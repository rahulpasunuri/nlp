Lovely dish. I added extra mustard, grilled the Bacon skewered Salmon on the BBQ (in -10 Canadian Winter), added chopped Garlic to the Baby spinach which I served over the Salmon. Delicious!

I have made this salmon several times, I love it. Use extra mustard, extra bacon! I had the good fortune to make it on a grill once or twice...ten times better than the results from a pan!

Made this tonight and we loved it. I did read a few reviews prior - I did put alot more mustard on the salmon - good call and a 1/2 pc each more bacon. As for the spinach, followed most...added a bit of crushed garlic and pine nuts. Also - crumbled bacon on top of spinach right before serving. If I can make this - anyone can.

A quick and easy recipe to make. It was a big hit with my daughter. I used wild salmon & Maille Old Style mustard. In addition, I toasted some pine nuts and added them to the wilted spinach. I will definitly make this recipe again.

one more thing, we barbecued it rather than broil it...

Made this over Memorial Day weekend while renting a cabin. Wanted easy to make recipes with a minimum of ingredients. This certainly fit the bill. We absolutely adored this dish, however we used a lot more bacon than called for, but really what's wrong with more bacon?

i love this, have made it several times! so easy and quick... of course salmon off the grill has better flavor, but i love the combination with the bacon and mustard. i can never get my bacon crispy enough for my taste, and each time i make it i use more mustard...but this is fast becoming a classic in my kitchen.

This was very very average, I thought. Edible but not good. These days, I am not a gourmet cook (my schedule requires I cook simply, so I do) and this is what attracted me to this recipe. I did not think this was very flavorful, which surprised me given the ingredients. I used wild salmon, good bacon and boar's head coarse mustard with white wine because that is what I had on had. I have 3 boys under 5 and it looked easy and healthy so I decided to try it. My husband got called into work so he didn't get to eat it, which I think was a good thing. Maybe it is just that I am used to grilling salmon and that provides so much flavor - I don't know. The spinach was not great either - given other reviews I added some minced garlic and a dash of red wine vinegar when I served it - still bland tasting. May be tacky, but I think my old staple of grilling salmon steaks with a bit of mayonnaise on them tastes much better, and is even easier to do.

I made this last night. It was pretty good, but I wasn't "wowwed" the same way others were. I used really high quality ingredients - freshest wild salmon, butcher case bacon and an amazing mustard [Mendicino Mustards Seeds & Suds - yum!], but it wasn't anything to rave about. I'm going to try it again though - maybe increasing the mustard.

I made this dish for my two sons, ages 10 and 16 and it was a hit with them. I made only two modifications 1) I used Dijon Mustard 2) I cooked the salmon on the grill over a medium to low heat until the bacon was crisp. This meal was very delicious and nutritious, simple and quick to prepare and I will make it again. A great alternative to going to the drive thru.

This was good but not great. I'm not sure I like the mixture of salmon and bacon.

Our daughter was home from college and loves salmon. We had a late afternoon lunch and I added Asian-Flavored Coleslaw with Rice Vinegar and Ginger. The salmon was tasty, perfectly cooked and easy to make. Her friend thinks I'm a gourmet cook. Ha! I'll try the onion trick suggested in other reviews to give the spinach some crunch next time. The combinations of flavors were a hit! This was my first epicurious recipe to try. I'll try more. So little time...so many recipes! Any ideas about clearing out the cooked salmon smell after the meal?

Oh yeah, this is a definite make again recipe! 4 forks for being not only very tasty, but simple, quick, and with very little mess to clean up afterward. (a definite plus in my kitchen!) Didnt have whole grain mustard, but added some whole mustard seed to some dijon - what a fun texture. Also agreed with the cook from ID - brown the shallots till crisp, take em out and add them back in for a nice added crunch. Yum!

Great dish, nice treat for a weeknight. I browned the shallots until very crisp, removed it from the pan, and then added it back to the wilted spinach (great crunch!). Served both with rice.

Delicious and easy weeknight meal. My boyfriend is from Alaska, so very picky about his salmon. He loved it. Used pancetta instead of bacon and regular dijon mustard...

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was very simple and easy. The bacon crisped up well and lent a nice flavor to the salmon without overpowering it. For the spinach I caramelized the shallots to give the dish more depth.

The salmon was delicious - just needed a little more cook time for me. The spinach needed something more - so when I made again I took one slice of the bacon and a little garlic and cooked together before adding the spinach and made sure the spinach got throughly mixed with the bacon and of course the ever awful bacon grease and garlic - before serving added just a few drops of lemon juice - really made the spinach stand with the salmon.

Nice, quick way to prepare salmon in the winter when the bbq is out of commission. Use quality bacon from the butcher or pancetta

The crunchy and smoky bacon was a perfect compliment to the buttery salmon. Don't overcook the salmon! Remember to get skewers -- we busted up some old chopsticks, but they caught fire. Yow!

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious! I smeared BOTH sides of the fish with the mustard and lowered the broiling rack to about 6 inches below the flame so the bacon wouldn't burn. I like my salmon cooked through, so the cooking time was a few minutes longer. All the ingredients create a wonderful flavor combination. I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes.

oh gosh this was bad! Spinach was okay but the salmon was terrible!

This recipe turned out great. Very easy and quick. The salmon was a perfect blend of simplicity and flavor. Wilted spinach was very tasty as well. I went a little light on the mustard though. Ill probably add more next time.

I used salmon fillet and it didn't cook enough by the time the bacon was done, but it was very good in the end.

Easy to make weeknight dinner that is also elegant enough for company. I used Creole mustard and added some garlic to the spinach. Quite good.

Use flavorful, high quality bacon, stick with grainy mustard, and the dish is impeccable! I served it to my family first, but I'd definitley make it for company too.

Used dijon mustard like another reviewer, and it was delicious! Accidentally picked up a package of beef bacon instead of the usual pork and it was outstanding. Definitely will make again!

Even using the best of ingredients -salmon filet from Whole Foods, Neiman Ranch bacon - I was disappointed in this dish and won't repeat it. Yes, it's easy and yes, it's quick - but just about any salmon filet dish can be easy and quick. I just don't think bacon on salmon is the most complementary pairing of flavors.

What a fabulous weeknight recipe. So quick and so entirely delicious. I loved the spinach, but it didn't go over well with the family. The salmon, however, was unbelievable. I bought whole grain mustard and am really happy I did. It truly made the dish.

I made the salmon with a Dijon mustard since that was what I had on hand. The salmon turned out perfect and tasted incredible. My husband has asked me to make the spinach part of our regular vegetable rotation. Also, I loved how quick it was. Served it with couscous since it is also quick.

A wonderful, easy recipe. It's as good as you would find in an expensive restaurant.

Tried this last night and we loved it. Substituted peppered bacon and also added one slice finely chopped to the spinach. A keeper.

Wonderful and extremely fast and easy! I used rather thin sockeye salmon fillets, spread some tarragon dijon mustard I had on hand and rolled the fillets, then wrapped the bacon around the fillets and skewered the fish. Broiled about 2-3 minutes longer than the recipe called for and was delicious. Served it with the wilted spinach which is an easy basic. Can't wit to experiment with some other mustards. Hmmm!

Rating: 4
Very easy and excellently flavored! I used a wasabi sake mustard, and will experiment with other "gourmet" mustards! The second time I made this I broiled the backside for 3 minutes and then turned it over, applied salt, pepper, and mustard. I cut the bacon to fit the salmon and do not use the skewers, which I found to be just extra work...

This was a very flavorful recipe! It was so easy to make and good enough to serve to guests. I did have to broil the salmon 2-3 minutes longer than suggested in the recipe. This is a keeper.

We didn't have shallots on hand, so I roasted a head of garlic while the broiler heated up. Added the garlic to the spinach for 2 min. in the pan. The salmon was so easy and quick, 5 min. prep and 7 min. total to cook. Anything that combines salmon, spinach, garlic and bacon gets four forks in my book!

I only made the salmon portion of the recipe, and we loved it. It took about 5 minutes to prepare, and about 8 minutes to cook. Delish!

I made this for my wife last night, and we both loved it! The salmon is surprisingly simple to make and comes out moist and perfectly medium rare. My wife did not believe me when I told her what was in the wilted spinach, because it tastes like a much more complicated dish. I expect this will make it into regular rotation in our house.
