The kids and I loved this! It's an easy and great new way to get kids to eat cranberries. Very healthy snack food and addictive.

This was great served warm with curry and also with latkes. I wouldn't bother with the butter next time; it was fine without. I used dried cranberries, one cup, that I soaked in a little bit of warm water while I was chopping apples.

This was a surprisingly great recipe. I'm not a huge fan of applesauce but had some apples that were getting too soft to eat raw. The addition of cranberries took applesauce to a whole new level! The result was both delicious and a gorgeous berry jewel color. I'm going to serve this at a future dinner party (though I'll dress it up a little for company)...

Easy, pretty and best of all, it tastes great! I love the subtle tartness the cranberries give this sauce. The only changes I made were that I used apple cider instead of juice or water (I had it from my farmers market shopping trip) and I cut down on the sugar as with all that fruit, it doesn't need it. I served it hot with vanilla ice cream for dessert this year at Thanksgiving. A big hit!

This was delicious! I doubled the amount of apples and cranberries; varied the types of apples used; halved the amount of sugar and used half brown and half white. I used grated lemon peel rather than one large strip. Instead of using the food mill, I used my hand held blender which made it nice and smooth - just be sure to remove the cinnamon stick first!

Went nicely atop sweet potato/parsnip latkes. Cut the sugar in half.

Beautiful color, nice and tart when I used 1/4 c sugar as suggested by PP. Used fine disc on food mill, large was too big to remove cranberry skins. This is the first of 3 cranberry dishes my 3-year-old has eaten this year. She wouldn't touch the others.

This was really good. I used brown sugar, cranberry juice, added some orange zest in addition to the lemon, and a few extra cranberries. I will definitely make again, but with about half the sugar. Yum!

This accompanied a crown roast of pork for Christmas dinner. Everyone liked it, except for those who don't like cranberries. It's a beautiful color. Didn't use a food mill; just a potato masher. Texture was good.

Beautiful and SOOOO easy to make. What a wonderful "twist" on applesauce. I made this for a client for her holiday dinner and it was a HUGE hit. So rosy and pretty for the holidays. Used my foor processor to puree. Garnished with fresh cranberries and mint for a "holly" effect. SPECTACULAR!

Great applesauce. Almost addictive! Very easy and quick to make. Used lime zest instead of lemon, golden delicious apples and less sugar. I also just used a potato masher to mash the apples. Beautiful color, great flavor and texture. Look forward to using this recipe again throughout the holidays.

thanks to prior reviewers who encouraged me to try this one, i was running out of ideas for all those cranberries. this sauce has the most beautiful rosy red color and it's a wonderful change from either apple or cranberry sauce. i've now made it twice and both times it just vanished. and to think i almost chucked the food mill...

I have been making this every Thanksgiving since 1994, when my (then) small children wouldn't eat regular cranberry sauce. It is the best, and I always receive requests for this very easy recipe.

This is very good. I made it with granny smiths and it came out tart and a very pretty pink. Super easy, and I would definitely make it again! One note: it took much longer than 15 min for my apples to get soft.

My mom and I made this together for Christmas dinner. We both marveled at how beautiful the color was - a luscious, soft red - and everyone raved about the taste. Paired perfectly with honey baked ham. I'll need to double the recipe next time since my father had to scrape the bowl to get his fill!

Leary of this recipe and wondering if my family would like it I only made 6 pints of this applesauce. Once we all tasted this heavenly sauce I opened the other 56 pints of my regular recipe and converted the sauce to this recipe. My extended family and friends all have enjoyed this years apple harvest through this recipe.

What a delicious change to regular applesauce - and a great way to use leftover cranberries from the Holidays. I omitted the butter and didn't bother to sieve the mixture since I enjoy it slightly chunky. When it was warm, I even spooned some over vanilla ice cream for dessert!

This just might take the place of cranberry sauce! Our guests just couldn't stop eating this. I served with Mushroom-Stuffed Pork Tenderloin (on this site). I didn't process through food mill but left apples and cranberries whole. It was just great!

Easy to make and so tasty. Will definately make again.

Simple to make and very tasty! Being able to prepare this up to a week in advance was quite advantageous. Everyone wanted the recipe on this one!
