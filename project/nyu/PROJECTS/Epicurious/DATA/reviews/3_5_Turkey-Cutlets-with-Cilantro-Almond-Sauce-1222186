Easy to make. Lots of flavour. I doubled the amount of rub and sauce as suggested (and it was necessary). Next time I think I will try balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and I might add a dollop of dijon. I served this with a simple green salad and roasted root vegetables.

We really enjoyed this dish. There is a restaurant in town that serves an "Indian Spiced Chicken" and this is amazingly close. Few little changes I made were: chicken for myself (I can not have turkey) and apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. My husband devoured 2 turkey cutlets, and I wish I had made more than one chicken breast for left overs! Served it with sprouted quinoa and English peas that I also seasoned with coriander and cinnamon. Delish!

So good so fast and looks so good on a platter to boot :)

Wow! What great flavors! And so easy to cook. I followed the advice to double the rub and was very content with the results. I made this in a skillet on the stove top, and it actually tasted very much as though it were grilled. The toasted almonds lend a smokiness to the dish that's very pleasant. The visual presentation with the sauce dribbled over is also great; I'll put this down as a recipe to make for guests.

The Cilantro Almond Sauce was delicious. The combination of turkey cutlets and the sauce, not so much. I'll use the sauce over something else.

We weren't too sure what the flavors were going to taste like together but were pleasantly surprised at how delicious it turned out. Like others who reviewed this recipe, we had do double the rub. I don't like vinegar at all but couldn't really taste it too much.

I used half of a wild turkey breast and doubled the recipe and found it very good. I followed the recipe exactly as listed. Everyone was surprised at how good it was and agreed the almond sauce made the dish. I will make it again.

This is such a quick and easy recipe with lovely flavors! Unlike a previous reviewer, I think the almonds are essential to the sauce. The sauce is very fresh, light and lively. I used the leftover sauce the next day on some rotiserie chicken and it was still good, but less vibrant. I will definitely keep this recipe filed to make again.

Great way to prepare turkey cutlets! The rub is very tasty, though I would make double next time to ensure the meat is fully coated. The almond/vinegar sauce is very yummy! Don't substitute too much--perfect the way it is!

Wow! One of our favs! In the wintery NW we use the Forman grill and it's just as good. Lots of fights over the last of the sauce. We add lots of extra almonds.

I altered this recipe liberally to suit the ingredients I had in my pantry already, but it was wonderful: I used cider vinegar, black pepper instead of red pepper flakes, walnuts instead of almonds and cooked the turkey in a skillet. I do agree with the reviewer who said the oil/spices you coat the turkey in wasn't enough to coat all the pieces- -it really stuck onto the first couple of pieces. Next time, I might double that part.

I loved this recipe. Simple and very fresh tasting. The sauce is great.

There are only 2 of us so when we buy a 1/2 turkey breast(3 lb) one has to get creative. No need for creativity with this recipe, though: on the unusual side and so full of flavor you wonder how it happened. My only potential change would have been the almonds, as I don't taste them in the dish; you could use other crunchy ingredients. Also found that the mop (or rub, depending on your definition) stuck readily to the first cutlet or two so I had to work a bit to get all cutlet pieces covered. The result was WONDERFUL

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was fast and easy, and very flavorful. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, using an indoor grill because my outside grill ran out of gas while I was preheating. :) The exceptions I made were that I accidentally used too much salt, and I only had slivered almonds, so I chopped them up a bit before toasting. Adding the freshly toasted almonds to the sauce mixture brought out the flavors wonderfully. I thought that the sauce might go to waste because there was a lot of it, so I served the turkey over a salad of mixed baby greens, tomato wedges, thinly-sliced sweet onions, and a fresh cherry pepper. It was excellent all together.

I found the sauce really distastefully vinegar-y, despite liking all the ingredients on their own; and the "rub" on the turkey cutlets made my kitchen smell nice but didn't add much to the flavor of the turkey. A rare Gourmet misfire, I thought.

Delicious! We really enjoyed this meal and will definitely make it again.

Wonderful and unexpected flavor. I added a little pear puree to the sauce to sweeten it up a bit. We also used chopped almonds and creadcrumbs for the topping.

Easy, quick, and quite delicious. The sauce really works--don't leave the almonds out, they add a lot.

Made this exactly as written. We both thoroughly enjoyed it, but I will say that I think the grilling of the cutlets makes a big difference. And the 3 minutes was exactly right.

This dish was a real hit. We were al surprised how delicious it was with the turkey. I thought the sauce worked marvelously. And the little bit I saved for my lunch the next day was fab. A winner.

We made this with chicken since it was on hand, instead of turkey, otherwise we followed this as written. Delicious and easy! I thought the blending of all these different flavors worked great, which I wouldn't have guessed when I first looked at the recipe.

Everyone loved this, luckily I doubled the recipe because everyone had seconds! The only change I made was to brine the turkey breasts for 30 minutes before I put the rub on and I added the almonds to the sauce just before putting it on the turkey.

We thought this was just OK. The sauce kind of reminded me of a chimichurri, but I thought it was just weird. I also couldn't bring myself to put the toasted sliced almonds in the vinegar sauce, so I just sprinkled them on top.

The flavors in this recipe were too busy in my opinion. It seemed like there should have been either emphasis on the wet rub or on the sauce, because the flavors did not speak to one another. The sauce is very much like a dressing, so maybe next time I will serve everything over a bed of greens.

Loved the sauce. The corandier and cinnamon were a lovely touch. Turkey was juicy and better than chicken.

I must admit I used chicken breasts, but it was delicious. The flavors of the spice rub and the sauce together were really lovely. I will definitely make it again. And the leftovers were fabulous added to the Red Leaf Ceasar Salad (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/235151?saved_to_box=y) along with a ripe avocado and some fresh summer tomatoes. It all made for a perfect meal for a hot summer night.
