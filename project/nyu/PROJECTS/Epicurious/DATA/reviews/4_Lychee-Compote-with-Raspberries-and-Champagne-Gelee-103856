This is a really inspired taste combination. I couldn't get fresh lychees, but canned worked just fine. The gelee packs a nice alcoholic punch. I didn't fold the ingredients together but arranged them on each plate. This was a big hit with my guests - I served it after the Japanese beef stew from this website.

The union between fresh raspberries, champagne and lychees are wonderful. Very nice and delicate flavor, diferent textures. I just mix gelatin with 3/4 cup Cava and add the rest later to trap more bubbles when gelatine set. Do not overstir. I also add more lemon juice, maybe next time I´ll use lime juice instead. Use only high quality Cava or Champagne or the bubbles will dissapear from gelatine as it's heated.
