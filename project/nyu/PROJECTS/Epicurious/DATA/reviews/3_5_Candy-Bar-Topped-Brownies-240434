I made these as directed, but added 1 tsp. salt in with the flour. For the candy bars on top I used Lindt "Touch of Sea Salt" Dark Chocolate bar squares. These were so chocolately and rich! Not messy either - they hold up really well. Everyone loved them - kids and adults!

Best brownies I have ever made! People were moaning with pleasure. I agree with the reviewer who baked them for 25 minutes instead of 27. I thought they could be slightly gooeyer.

These are wonderful. Everyone thinks they are the best brownies ever! The boys in my son's dorm fight over them. They really don't deserve those bad reviews. I do add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.

These were incredibly rich but very good. I used Giardhelli squares with caramel and they were fantastic! My friend's husband who says he ordinarily doesn't like brownies ate three. I wish that Epicurious would figure out how to cancel out people's multiple entries that in the end alter the overall review ratings.

Sorry about the tripe entry! My computer froze and I didn't think it "read" my keystrokes. Evidently it did. :(

I'm only giving this two forks for now. First, they need SALT. The recipe calls for unsalted butter and no additional salt, and I used salted butter thinking it would be enough because chocolate desserts just taste better (to me) with a wee bit of salt. This one didn't. It's VERY fudgy and chocolaty, but the flavor is flat. Even the salted butter wasn't enough. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Well, except for the chocolate bars - the Perugina bars only had 8 squares each. I bought 2 of them (16 total) and came up 8 squares short, so I used small truffles instead, which was a good substitute. Also, the bars were very greasy from the buttered foil, so I'm going to try the "grease and flour" technique next time (along w/a pinch of salt). Also, the chocolate squares on top "bloomed" after a few hours, which makes them look rather old. Not so the truffles (the kind wrapped in foil from Godiva), so I'll probably use those next time too. I don't usually make something twice if it doesn't wow me the first time, but I feel these have potential. I could forgive the greasiness and chocolate bloom, but not the flatness of flavor. Will add a bit of salt next time.

This recipe was a big hit on campus. I teach college and the Grad assistants really loved the Cadbury carmello bars I used on top with the luscious chocolate brownies.

I have received tons of compliments for these brownies. Many say they are the best brownies they ever had and I agree! The only change I made was bake them for 25 min. This made them more gooey and yummy.

delicious and easy. I used the caramel-filled chocolate squares, but I'll try the cappuccino-filled next time - I think it would work better with the espresso flavor of the brownies. I read another review saying she would make them without the candy - I agree they would be good plain too.

These are by far the best brownies I have ever had and many of my friends agree.

These brownies are delicious, especially with the caramel candy bar. They actually get moister and more fudge-like with a few days time, if kept in a sealed container. I will definitely repeat this recipe, perhaps with addition of orange peel to the batter and an orange/ chocolate candy bar...yum!

This is without a doubt the best brownie recipe I've made. The espresso powder really brings out the chocolate. I served it with ice cream and Nocciolata. To die for!

LOVED the brownies, will skip the candy bar in future versions. these were really fudgy.
