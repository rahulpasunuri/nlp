This is my favorite easy 'go to' recipe for apps. Make them as-is and they are a crowd pleaser every time (and I'm in a foodie crowd). Sometimes I just need one roll so I freeze the other and keep it on hand for the next semi-impromptu gathering.

I didn't have gruyere on hand, so I used havarti. They were still delicious, though they were a lot smaller than I expected. My guest really like them. I sliced them and baked them while everyone stood around in the kitchen socializing.

Easy and nice to serve. My guests munched on these while I finished the rest of dinner.

My pinwheels were really dry - cracker dry? Think I may have sliced them to thin and cooked to long. Taste was bland. Would try basil next time.

Rating: 4
Just made a "practice" batch of these in preparation for a baby shower tomorrow. YUM!! I love the nutty flavor of the gruyere. I didn't think they were overly salty at all, as some others have mentioned. They are the perfect little bite, and exactly what I was looking for. I'm excited to share them with everyone at the party tomorrow!

These are an elegant and fabulous appetizer, especially when paired with champagne or Prosecco. I've made them many times over the years and typically get an enthusiastic reaction!

Can also use Pillsbury Crescent rolls instead of Puff pastry...very tasty.

Rating: 3
Try and find some really good Gruyere, like cave-aged; this makes all the difference. I fry the sage in butter till crisp. Also, for extra flavor I spread the pastry with honey-Dijon as suggested in another pinwheel recipe.

totally easy and a hit with my friends at our cocktail party.

I was disappointed by these. I'd been looking forward to making this and had heard raves from others, but was disappointed with results. I may have cut them too thin; they turned out dry and tasted overwhelmingly of the pastry rather than the filling. I won't make again.

Very elegant and easy!

I made these for a cocktail party over the Chistmas holiday as written. They were delicious and very easy to put together. I kept them refrigerated on the baking sheet and popped them directly into the oven before serving. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
These were AWESOME! I added more prosciutto. I tried both sage and basil and the sage is FAR superior. The do-ahead factor is key. After freezing the rolls for 10 minutes, I sliced and put them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet in the fridge. I baked them right from the fridge when my guests arrived! PERFECT!

Rating: 3
every Thanksgiving this recipe is a command perfomance. It's super yum and totally easy. The cooking time is way too long ... and I don't really measure the ingredients (if you like it cheesy add more cheese) but the sage, cheese and prosciutto are great together.

I was so disappointed with this recipe! I used twice the amount of proscuitto, I rolled out the puff pastry, and still, all I could taste was puff pastry! Very bland. I made these for a party, but I won't be serving them.

Will definitely make this again. Read reviews and agree, ham and baby swiss and basil work really well. I made this according to recipe and then according to reviews- either way, really good.

THIS WAS A GREAT HORS D'OEUVRE. IT WORKED WELL FOR A LARGE PARTY, WAS EASY AND THE SAGE IS AN UNEXPECTED FLAVOR, AS BASIL AND PROSCIUTTO CAN BE SUCH A COMMON PAIR.

I've made these for company several times, so easy and really good. I used pesto that I had in the freezer instead of basil or sage. Putting them in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes makes them easier to slice..

Rating: 3
Fantastic hors d'oeuvre - easy and quick to prepare, and they were gobbled up by the guests as soon as they came out of the oven. Used 4 slices of prosciutto for each roll, sprinkled with fresh cracked pepper, grated mozzarella and basil. Did not find them salty and/or greasy.

Rating: 4
made this for a dinner party on Saturday and it was SO GOOD. Sub. basil for the sage and it was amazing. Everyone gobbled it up. So good.

Rating: 4
I just made these for the third time for a party, because it's a fantastic hors d'oeuvre - quick and simple, and can be prepared in advance. It's been a tremendous hit with the guests every time. The fresh herb (like other reviewers, I used basil) makes a huge difference. I found that freezing the rolls for 5 minutes or so made them easier to cut. And you really don't need to waste an egg - a little water works just fine for sealing the rolls.

Rating: 3
this was very easy and good. I didn't want to waste the extra sheet of puff pastry, so I tried my own version with some portabella mushrooms, chopped fine, sauteed in butter and spread brie cheese out as best I could--people seemed to like those better.

Rating: 2
Easy to make - but lacked excitement. I would serve them again but would use herbs - different cheese - something to make them more remarkable.

Rating: 4
I made these for a party and everybody liked them. They are crisp and very tasty and attractive. You will need a very sharp knife to cut the slices.

I found these to be overly salty, but my guests liked them. I would make them again, but maybe change the proportion of proscuitto and cheese and focus more on a fresh herb, like basil.

I've made this quite a few times and it is always a hit. I have used basil instead of sage. It is very pretty and savory.

I'd use the word "very savoury" instead of "too salty". They turned out great and I look forward to trying some of the variations suggested by others... read back!

Rating: 4
These are just so good and easy to boot! I did double the prosciutto, though. Basil is a good sustitute for those not caring for sage. I also baked ahead. Froze & reheated for 10 minutes in a 350 oven.

Rating: 4
YUM. Beware, you might not have any appetite left for main course because you'll stuff yourself on these! I had never tried using puff pastry before, very easy, deceptively so to guests. Adaptable. Also made a vegetarian version with the other pastry sheet from the box: 1 leek, some finely chopped mushrooms, sauteed with a dab of oil and a smattering of dry white wine, and then off flame stir in 3oz goat cheese. MORE YUM.

I made these with basil instead of sage and served them at a cocktail party. Everyone was pretty much hovering around the oven waiting for the second batch to come out. They are big crowd pleasers! Make sure to keep the rolls in the fridge until ready to slice.

Great for parties! They are easy to make and you can make them a day in advance. I'm not a big prosciutto fan, so I made another batch with caramelized onions and goat cheese. They were delicious!

Rating: 3
Very easy and cheap to make. I even forgot to slice before cooking (baked the whole log) - just cut it up after and it was fine too.

Rating: 3
Weird - I cut these a little thinner, and froze them after slicing, and they didn't puff the way I thought they would. It could have been either change I made, and everyone DEVOURED them despite the fact they weren't pretty, so I'll probably try them again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a hit a parties. I agree that the ingredients can get a little expensive. I've substituted the prosciutto with thinly sliced black forest ham and the gruyere with baby swiss. It was a hit both ways!

Very good, very easy. These were snapped up at a recent cocktail party. I did a similar roll for a different party, using Prosciutto, soft goat cheese and parsely (I'll add some additional herbs the next time).

i agree these taste like mini pizzas. but i have modified it using walnuts, gorgonzola and dried apricots for instance. very elegant and perfect with champagne. the possibilities are endless.

Rating: 1
I was really disappointed with these, especially after reading all the rave reviews. The ingredients are really expensive, and I guess I was expecting something that tasted pretty spectacular. This dish ended up tasting like mini-pizzas, and greasy ones at that. There's nothing wrong with mini-pizzas, they just were not worth the money that was spent on the ingredients.

Rating: 4
Simple, delicious and look great on a serving tray. What more could you ask for? I too used the entire pastry sheet and increased the prosciutto. I have also made these in advance and frozen the log. Very easy to thaw and slice for unexpected guests. I've made these on so many occasions and am asked for the recipe each time.

Rating: 3
Delicious and very easy to make. Served it at a cocktail party and it was the most popular dish.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy recipe. I too recommend doubling the amount of prosciutto. I don't think this quite makes 40 hors d'ouevres. I will make more next time; one recipe was devoured by 10 people very quickly. One of the best "make ahead" hors d'ouevres recipes I have seen.

Rating: 3
Just an idea -- I discovered (30 min. before guests arrived) that I had bought filo dough, and not puff pastry. Friend en route stopped to pick up puff pastry ... and found only cooked, molded little filo cups, about 1.5" wide. Chopped up prosciutto, threw cheese/sage misture on top, and popped in 400 degree oven for a few minutes. Voila! Worked beautifully. (Just in case you can't find puff pastry)

Rating: 4
Easy, impressive, and delicious! I agree that more prosciutto should be used than what the recipe calls for. Other than that, a perfect hors d'oeuvres for any kind of (elegant) party! Will most certainly make again.

I was in need of a quick, light appetizer and this hit the mark perfectly. This will become a cocktail snack staple in our house. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and doubled-up so I could freeze a couple of the logs. Wonderful.

I prepared the dish 2 days ahead, and it was delicious. I doubled the meat in some, and I would highly recommend doing that. I could not believe how easy these were to make!

Worked great for me exactly as written. Great flavor combination. I look forward to experimenting with different meat/cheese/herb combinations too. This will definitely become a "standard" at my house.

This is a stand-by. So easy to make, and they disappear. I now just make a double recipe and freeze 2 of the pastry logs for unexpected company. Defrosts quickly and you can barely taste the difference!

Delish and so easy to make! Next time w/ try making this with salami & mozzarella w/ basil...

Rating: 3
Good and easy (with a food processor, that is). I also found the baking time to be too long, found the filling to be just slightly too salty, and felt there was a little too much pastry for the filling. Next time, I plan to roll the dough a little thinner and increase the filling. It could use even a larger proportion of sage as well. Yes, my pastry was square as well. I tried both halving it as the recipe recommended, and using the entire square, as other reviewers' recommended -- both variations look just fine. Look forward to trying the other reviewers' suggestions.

Rating: 1
They *are* easy--I give you that. I didn't find them to be anything special, but I must confess, my filling went 1.5 times the distance. Maybe if I could stuff more in the directed amount of pastry, they would have been more delectable.

I gave it a 4 because it was SO EASY as well as delicious. I omittd the sage, I spread a little fresh basil pesto on the pastry, used fresh mozarella and double the prosciutto. It was so simple I was embarassed when people asked for the recipe

Puff Pastry is the best stuff to work with! A great addition to any appetizer spread because they can be made a day ahead. The flavors were milder than some appetizers, but the sage was a unexpected but pleasant surprise. They grow on you. I used the entire piece of pastry, rolling it out a litte. I rolled the long side. They came out a good size, about 2-2 1/2" in diameter. A keeper.

So easy, perfect for holiday menus. I added more prosciutto the second time I made them and they were even a bigger hit. One of my staples when entertaining.

Made these for a party and they were a hit! I rolled the dough out thinner and doubled the recipe. I made one batch with a little smoked cheddar added and another with a dash of red pepper. They disappeared in minutes so I don't know if they would be bad cold or not.

Rating: 3
While these pinwheels went over very well with the people at the dinner party, I was a tad disappointed because I did not think they lived up to the comments of other cooks. I was glad I had been warned that they take less baking time than the recipe. However, I took them to someone else's house and sliced and baked them there and perhaps that oven "ran hot." I like being able to do most of the prep work ahead of time -- I doubled the recipe, making 4 logs -- used 2 and froze 2.

These have appeared at our house every Christmas since 1986..does that make them a tradition? You bet. At other times of the year I use other combinations, but always the original at Christmas. Use the best quality cheese and prosciutto for maximum flavor.

Rating: 4
What a wonderful recipe! Super easy and taste fantastic. My guests weren't fazed by the saltiness commented on by others. I made them without cutting the pastry sheet in half; they ended up very nicely sized (3" or so in diameter).

Rating: 3
Great flavor combination! I rolled out the puff pastry a bit and added about twice the amount of cheese. They did look a little smaller than I had hoped; it would be interesting to try this with the entire length of puff pastry. Also, this recipe really does not make very much, so for a group of more that 4, double or triple it.

Rating: 3
Isn't puff pastry the greatest thing? A note on the saltiness issue: as both prosciutto and Gruyere are highly salted items, you can substitute either a milder ham or cheese for one of the ingredients. This recipe adapts well to substitutions, and is impressive and easy to make. A definite keeper, especially for the upcoming Superbowl parties.

Rating: 4
Delicious ! Made for a dinner party for friends between Christmas and New Years ! I took the advice of one reader and rolled out the pastry dough a bit - worked great. However, I found them a tad salty... didn't hurt the flavor just a little salty for me - I'll make them again and maybe not use as much gruyere & prosciutto !

I slathered some Dijon-style mustard directly on the pastry before adding the additional ingredients which cut down on the richness of the dough. Was delish!!!!

Made it for a party and they were the number one hit of all appetizers served. Several requests for the recipe. Easy to make. I made them three days ahead of time and stored them as logs in the frig.

Very tasty... made for a party and they were a big hit. Super-easy, too! The only problem I had... didn't make as many pinwheels as recipe claimed. I may not have cut them thinly enough... next time I'll double it. I KNOW they'll get eaten!

Rating: 4
I've made these at least 25 times. A little cayenne pepper adds a kick, and rolling out the puff pastry a bit thinner keeps the pastry to filling ratio balanced. The wrapped, unsliced roll freezes perfectly, just thaw, slice and bake.

Rating: 3
I've made this dish several time and it's always a hit. One addition - I divide the filling in half and add finely chopped hot peppers (jalepenos or little Thai peppers) to the filling for an added kick. I make one roll with the peppers and one without. The spicy ones are usually the first to go...

Rating: 3
This is a keeper. When you are making them I would put on as much filling as possible so that the pastry does not overpower the taste. I love the use of sage in this recipe. The fact that these keep in the fridge for 3 days is a real plus.

These are so simple to make! They fly off the plate whenever I make them. Be sure to use imported prosciutto for the best flavor. A sure hit at any party!

Found instructions a bit confusing as my pastry was nearly square as well. I'm not sure if I cut and rolled correctly...does anyone have the dimensions?
