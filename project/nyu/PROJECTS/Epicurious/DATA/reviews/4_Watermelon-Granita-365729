I've been making this recipe since last summer and just made it again this morning because I ended up with a watermelon that wasn't all that flavorful. Instead of tossing it, I broke it down, added a little extra sugar and squeezed in extra lime juice to compensate. And it's still the coldest, most refreshing dessert ever. My only advice is to make sure to give it a good scrape after an hour, and whenever you think of it after that. It'll end up much lighter and fluffier that way.

So easy and incredibly refreshing. Must have sweet, tasty watermelon for best results.

This was okay, I didn't think the flavor was all that extraordinary and it took almost 3 times as long to freeze as listed - which was long after my party was over.

A light and refreshing dessert, I will definitely make this again. Shared it with my best friend, who immediately asked for the recipe. Very easy to make!

I probably shouldn't be rating this because mine is not frozen yet. But I had a hard time not drinking up all of the refreshing, delicious watermelon puree I just put in the freezer. One question though, if you only need 1 3/4 pounds of watermelon why does it matter whether it comes from a 4 pound watermelon?

Genius in a bowl. This is the hands-down most refreshing summer dessert. Heck, I could even eat it for breakfast. I think you could get by with decreasing the sugar, since you are using fruit- which is generally sweet. I used more lime juice, as I really liked the flavor with the watermelon. I'd like to try this with a different fruit, maybe peaches? I also think flecks of mint would work well with this. And here's an idea: A bit of rum for an adult delight?

This is our new favorite go-to summer dessert. The flakes of icy watermelon are so refreshing and have gotten us through a heat wave. SO simple, it's really foolproof -- though you must do the first mashing after an hour, it really helps the consistency. ENJOY.

I agree. Completely easy, delicious and refreshing. True watermelon taste. A great summer dessert.

For having only 3 ingredients and taking no more than 5 minutes (active time), this is remarkable. Coming back to it after an hour really makes for easy scraping in the end. For melt-in-your-mouth watermelon, I'm going to be coming back to this a lot this summer.
