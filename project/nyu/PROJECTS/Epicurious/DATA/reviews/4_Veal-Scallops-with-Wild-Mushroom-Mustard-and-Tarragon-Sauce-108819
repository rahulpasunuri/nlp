This was an incredibly rich sauce, but oh so good. I made simple side dishes--parmesan rice and green beans and was glad of that. You can't eat much of it, but it's a luxurious entree, especially if you love tarragon.

Not bad but nothing to get too excited about.

Would I make this again? Yes!!! Family loved it. I had no wine so I used Chicken broth and instead of coarse-grained Dijon, I used Grey Poupon. I made extra sauce and served with angel hair pasta. Yum!

a little too rich for me! but it had great flavors- will definitely make again with light cream and less mustard as one person suggested.

I made this recipe for the wild mushroom, tarragon and mustard souce to serve over a pork loin that I grilled. It was fabulous. I used a piece of ham I had in the fridge for the base to be sure I had some brown bits to scrape up for some richness. Otherwise I followed the recipe using button and crimoni mushrooms and everyone devoured it. It will be great for grilled chicken breasts too. I will add this to top of my "sauce for dry meat list".

Elegant dish that is easy to make, and quite flavorful. It is worthwhile making double the sauce to serve over a side dish.

Great recipe; the sauce is fantastic and shouldn't be altered at all.

I know it's been said, but I'll add my own two cents -- this dish is DELICIOUS! I substituted thinly sliced chicken breasts for the veal. Also, I used more mushrooms than the recipe called for -- a combination of crimini, oyster and reconstituted, dried procini mushrooms.

Wonderful. I had regular button mushrooms that needed to be used and they served the purpose nicely. I will look forward to making this again with fresh wild mushrooms.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good. However, the veal didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth feeling. But, I'm gonna blame it on the quality of the veal I bought. (it definitely couldn't be the cook's fault!) I need to try it again with veal from the specialty meat market in my neighborhood. Regardless, the sauce is amazing!

This one's a huge winner! It's truly simple to make, but packs a wallop in both flavor and elegence. This is a great recipe for either impressing the heck out of dinner guests or just making a nice meal for the family. The flavors are definitely a bit more exotic than most people find on their plate at home -- but any time you combine shallots, tarragon, mustard and wine you know it's going to have that special panache. This is fine-restaurant-quality dining. Some notes: try to use only fresh mushrooms, not dried/reconstituted, even though sometimes that's all you can find for "wild". Porcini's work well, and you can usually find those fresh. Be sure to use high-quality veal, as the quickest way to ruin this dish is to have meat that doesn't melt in your mouth. Serve a dark green veggie, but don't season with anything other than salt -- like some other reviewers in here, I thought sauted spinach tasted absolutely sublime with this dish, especially when you mop it up with a bit of the sauce. Same with the starch -- orzo, angel-hair or any other light pasta, but don't season with anything that will conflict with the amazing flavors of the main dish.

Great flavors. I used light cream and decided to severely cut back on the mustard (2t instead of 2T), and it came out light and delicious.

Had to double the recipe- dbld all except the mustard- delicious, my 17 year old stepson says he wants to see this dish again- served as the previous reviewer, with plain buttered egg noodles with parmesan and spinach- perfect since all the flavors are so concentrated in the veal.

This recipe is absolutely delicious as is. The sauce is absolutely amazing and I agree that this dish would work well with pork, turkey or chicken. Everyone who ate this couldn't stop saying how good it was.

My husband and I made this dish to celebrate Valentines a little early. It was wonderful! The sauce was a smooth blend of mushrooms (we used oyster), dijon mustard, and tarragon. Very tasty. When I make it in the future, I'll use unsalted butter, but that's the only thing I'll change!!!

I've made this three times for friends and they always love it. Very impressive in taste and presentation.

This got a big WOW at my house last night. The other two people in the house kept telling all through the night how great dinner was and hoped I would make it again soon. I used poirk tenderloin because I had it. That made it pretty inexpensive. I served sugar snap peas and some fresh spinach linguine with butter and parm . Easy!!

This is my first review, surprising since I have prepared many of these recipes. After doing all the prep work, we lost power. With a generator, we have a few available outlets. This meal was prepared on a hot plate and on top of a wood burning stove. However, this recipe still came out great. I served it over linguine. The linguine could have been cook a little more and the rest of the dish a little hotter - but under the crcumstances it was super. Can't wait to make it again using my real kitchen.

I used pork tenderloins sliced into medallions and sauteed for only a minute or so to retain their tenderness. Then , I forgot the mustard!! It was excellent anyway. But leftovers the next day were absolutely spectacular WITH dijonnaise added. I found the shi-take mushrooms so velvety and delicious, the next time I will use them only (if I can afford them!)

Absolutely delicious sauce. I made it with turkey scallops instead of veal, and they were a little dry. Will make again with boneless chicken breasts sliced on the diagonal. I served it with polenta with feta cheese stirred in and WOW.

This is outstanding--the sauce is amazing. It was quick and easy to prepare and made a spectacular presentation. Definitely a hit and something I will make over and over again. Would be good with other meats too--like pork tenderloin and chicken.

We really enjoyed this preparation! It was very flavorful and tasted complex, but was relatively easy and quick to make. We served it with angelhair pasta and a salad with tomatoes stuffed with a goat cheese souffle, and it was great!!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I increased the sauce recipe by half which worked out well. We like more than a 'taste' of sauce. Very simple and quick to prepare.

Like the previous reviewer, I do not cook veal. I used pork scallops but imagine chicken breasts would work equally well. Whatever you use, the sauce is delicious exactly as written. I do have one comment, though, which relates to a pet peeve about this site. True wild mushrooms are rare and available for only a few weeks during the fall. Cepes/porcini are wild. Oyster, shitake and cremini mushrooms are not. Let's try for some accuracy here!

This dish was a big winner. I made no alterations to the recipe...followed it to a T and it was really spectacular. Easy to prepare, and a great option for Low Carb dieters.

Let me just say up front - we don't eat veal. So why did I try this recipe? The sauce sounded delicious and it is! I used turkey scallopini in place of the veal and otherwise prepared as per the recipe. I believe strongly that one can alter ingredients to fit one's own preferences without losing the character of the dish. In this case, I'll prepare this recipe again and again and I'll use turkey (or chicken) scallopini every time.
