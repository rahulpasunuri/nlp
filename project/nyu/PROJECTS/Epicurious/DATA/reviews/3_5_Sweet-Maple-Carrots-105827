Very good. I omitted the sugar and added an extra TBS of maple syrup instead. I also added a TBS of balsamic vinegar to bring some "brightness" to the flavor of the dish.

Easy, simple. A bit too sweet for my taste, I would leave out the sugar if I make it again.

This was good but not outstanding. I believe there are other, tastier maple/carrot dishes on Epicurious.

I have made this recipe so many times with baby carrots. We add freshly ground black pepper and a 1/8 t of red pepper flakes for a little kick! Talk about rave reviews!

I make this all the time, using baby carrots. It only dirties one pan (unlike traditional glazed carrots) and is quick and tasty. I often put all the ingredients in the pan and place it on the stove earlier in the day. Then, all I have to do when getting the meal together is turn on the stove , check it a few times, and then remove the cover for a few minutes - instant awesome side dish.

I have made this dish at least 30 times over the past two years for holidays and everyday dinners. Everyone always asks for the recipe and my family requests it at every holiday. The only thing I have found is that I remove the carrots when they are done and reduce the sauce over higher heat so that it resembles more of a thick glaze. I then put the carrots back in, stir and serve. Awesome.

This was good and easy to make, but I will garnish this with some fresh herbs next time I make it. Rosemary maybe?

I've made this dish several times. It adds color and good taste to any weeknight meal or special occasion. It's quick and easy to make. Must use real maple syrup though.

The glaze for these carrots gives them a nice holiday taste. I use the same glaze on sweet potatoes but I do cheat. I steam the carrots or boil the potates the day before I use them then make the glaze and reheat the vegetable in it before serving. They taste great and the last minute prep is a lifesaver when preparing a big meal.

This has been a family favorite since I first made it. One time that I made it, I had run out of pure maple syrup--so I used Aunt Jemima pancake syrup--boy, did that improve the taste!!! A much sweeter, maple taste. Since I use the baby carrots, I reduce the amount of water to just a couple of tablespoons--the prepared carrots seem to have too much water in them, which takes the glaze longer to cook than what the recipe calls for. My daughter requests this dish at every holiday meal and guest dinners!

Simple and easy to prepare. But a tad boring. My dinner guests thouht they were just "ok".

I made the dish using peeled baby carrots. Delicious!

Everyone who tried this at my Thanksgiving really liked this dish. I used baby carrots, as suggested by other reviewers and they turned out great...not too crisp and not too soft. The only negative was that it took longer than I thought it would for the glaze to reduce -- to the point where I removed the carrots to keep them from overcooking. Of course, there's the chance it was me, not the recipe, that was responsible for that...in either case, I'll certainly make them again.

A simple flavorful way to serve cooked carrots. I used whole baby carrots

Easy to make, simple to serve and guest to our holiday dinner raved about the recipe. Who would have thought that baby carrots and pantry staples would steal the show at a holiday dinner? This is a keeper!!!!

Nothing bad about this dish. Nothing to love, either. I thought the maple and butter overpowered the carrots.

I loved this very simple glazed carrot recipe. It was easy to make and just delicious; sweet, but not too sweet. My advice is to make this recipe with fresh carrots (those you find at a health food market with the green tops intact), scrub the carrots but don't peel the outer skin. Mine were very good this way.

These carrots have a delicately sweet flavor. I used the packaged "baby" carrots and cut them in thirds so they were all the same size. Very attractive dish and healthy. Even some guests who "normally don't like cooked carrots" loved them.

Awesome way to get you vegis in! I made these at school for some college students and the carrots were gone in minutes.

Wonderful recipe. The appearance of the carrots with glaze was colourful, and the flavour of the maple was not overpowering, just a hint of sweetness. I have made this dish several times already as it is so simple and fast, especially during the work week. Will be keeping this recipe.
