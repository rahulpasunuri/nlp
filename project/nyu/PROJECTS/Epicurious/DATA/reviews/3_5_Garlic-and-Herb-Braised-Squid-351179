I gave this three forks based on the original recipe. After reading earlier reviews, I added oregano, basil and onion powder to the sauce, then crumbled some feta on top--it brings the dish to life!

I used 1/2 cup of cilantro instead of parsley, shrimp stock instead of water and Italian seasoning. I season as I cook so this dish was very good. We had this over pasta and I shaved some Pecorino cheese over the dish. I gave this dish 3 forks because I added extra ingrediants.

Fabulous. My dinner guests adored it and we ate every single last spoonful.

This was fantastic. Made it tonight with no changes. Would make it again and again and again. Easy and delicious, very tender squid.

Added fresh thyme, oregano, and marjoram because I had them. Added sauteed artichoke hearts because I think we should eat more veggies. Served over pasta. Great.

I added capers and a quarter of an onion. The spice and flavor was great. I cooked this for my dad, and we loved it. I had to reduce the cooking time because the squid started to get a little rubbery so make sure to watch it.

Can't wait to try this substituting fresh cherry peppers for the red pepper flakes. I've been trying to replicate my husbands favorite appetizer for years without success and I think this one might come close.

A good meal that my wife enjoyed very much. We added cooked udon noodles right before serving. It was a good addition, however it would have been even better to have crusty bread for dipping in the leftover sauce.

I'm back again to respond to the disappointed reviewers below. I always use canned crushed & seasoned tomatoes (probably basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt in there) and add salt and onion powder as needed. I figured most people doctor up the recipes on Epicurious as nearly all the recipes are on the bland side if you make them as they appear.

I've made this several times and have always loved the result. Make sure to use fresh squid and be liberal with the pepper flakes. I make this for two people and we very rarely have leftovers. Also make sure to serve with bread or something to sop up the broth with - you'll want to savor it! Would not recommend this as a summer dish, as it packs serious heat.

I was completely underwhelmed. No real flavor save the hot red-pepper flakes. Don't know where I went wrong or what others that rated is four forks were tasting.

I added chopped kalamata olives and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to cook with the sauce. Treated more like a bread topping or rich pasta sauce, this is wonderful. Capers would also be a nice addition. My husband raved about it all through dinner. Will make again (when I feel like cleaning more squid!)

Not really sure how this recipe got such a good rating since most of the responses on here state the sauce is missing something. And I have to agree, it's definitely missing something. I don't feel the parsley added all that much flavor, maybe thyme or basil should could have been added but this recipe is definitely not something I'd be sharing with people or making for family and friends.

I found a very similar recipe in "Flavors of Italy - Sicily", but it included green olives and capers. It was very good. Maybe that is what is needed here.

My husband just made this for me and we agree, it's delicious and just the right amount of spicy, but needs a little something. I made a garlic herb olive oil with a lot of fennel seed to dip the bread in, before dipping in the sauce, and the addition of fennel to this was great. Maybe a little fennel seed with the garlic at the beginning, and some fennel garlic olive oil pureed and drizzled on top?

I spent nearly an hour cleaning 1.5 lbs of squid, but it was absolutely worth it. The crushed red pepper brings complexity to the sauce. Minor suggestion, cut the squids wider to fully appreciate them, otherwise they get lost in the sauce.

Worth the trouble of cleaning a lot of squid for this. Followed the recipe and served with roasted garlic bread brushed with olive oil and grilled.

I made it with out the chardonnay and add some thyme in it and was still good

Sauce was definitely missing something...I added more garlic & red pepper flakes, but it still needed something more. Very disappointed.

This is my first time cooking squid and both my land myself were so happy with the results! We're definitely doing this again - the spice warmed us up on such a cold night! I agree it needs something... maybe acidic - may try some lemon or vinegar next time.

A great way to cook squid if you're worried about making it tender enough. The dish was good, and the squid was tasty, but I though the sauce was a little boring. I guess I'm not creative enough to figure out how to improve it, though.

Simple but elegant , true. This is not Italian-Amer. cuisine but 100% Italian. Over 80 years ago my grandmother ,her sisters and others brought this dish to America.

Simple and elegant. I made it for my husband and myself for dinner and we soped up every last bit of sauce with bread. The rest we are freezing for pasta sauce. For a dinner party serve in little bowls like tapas! Yum!
