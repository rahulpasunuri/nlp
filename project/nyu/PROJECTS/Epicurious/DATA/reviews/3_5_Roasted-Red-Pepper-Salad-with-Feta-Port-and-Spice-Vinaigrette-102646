I made it at my girlfriend's house, and it turns out she did not have any sugar. I substituted Splenda (which I typically hate), and used about 1.5 tablespoons. Surprisingly, it was delicious. I am planning on making this for my dad next time I visit...as a diabetic, he would appreciate it.

As I had neither port nor sherry vinegar on hand, I substituted the former with sherry and the latter with red wine vinegar. The result was fantastic; the salad was completely devoured by all guests. Will definitely have to try with the original ingredients.

I made this salad twice, for Thanksgiving and Christmas eve and both times it was a success. This second time, however, it turn out better. I used 2 1/2 Tbsp. of sugar instead of 3 tbsp. When it came to putting together salad and dressing, I started by pouring some of the dressing in the salad bowl and slowly mixing the greens and adding more dressing. That way the dressing was fully incorporated into the salad. I used more than 5 oz. of mixed greens and still it was perfectly delicious.

Very good salad recipe. Used tawny port wine as a sub. Dressing needs to be at room temp. as stated in the recipe.

I, too made this for the holidays. What a hit. I especially like the effect of the red pepper, the white cheese and the green salad (very festive) The spice port dressing was phenomenal! I used a Chateau Reynella port and the overall response was overwhelming. Will definitely become a tradition at my Christmas Table.

Great salad. I served it for Christmas Eve dinner and it went over very well to a table full of fussy eaters at that. The dressing is a little on the sweet side but tolerable with the mix of the salad. I was also going to add roasted nuts and forgot - next time.

Very good and different from the typical vinaigrette.

I made this for Christmas. While it was very sweet, everybody thought it was outstanding!! Since I reside in the ALMOND capitol of the world I roasted some slivered almonds and served them on top. I also used a 50/50 mix of greens and baby spinach.
