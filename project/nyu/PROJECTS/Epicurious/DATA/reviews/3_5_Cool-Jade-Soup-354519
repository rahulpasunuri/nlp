This was the perfect soup for a warm summer night. I would add a bit more seasoning (salt) and I am not a salt eater. The best part was that my husband "hates" cilantro but didn't even know it was in the herbs. We lapped it up. Wonder what it woudl be like with different basils for the herbs. Maybe I'l try that next time.
