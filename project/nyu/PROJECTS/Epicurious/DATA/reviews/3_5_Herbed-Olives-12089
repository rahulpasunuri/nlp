I found the measurements for this recipe confusing. Does it call for 1 lb. olives dry weight or does the 1 lb. refer the weight of the olives and brine in the jar? I think it probably refers to olives + brine since the 3/4 cup olive oil was not nearly enough to cover the 1 lb. dry weight of olives I used/

As a novice-cook-bachelor, I prepared and served these Herbed Olives at my most recent wine and cheese party. Wow. Everyone was shocked at my "talents in the kitchen." Everyone also asked for the recipe. It is a great dish.

Easy to make, delicious, and a nice presentation. I have made these several times. They go fast at parties.
