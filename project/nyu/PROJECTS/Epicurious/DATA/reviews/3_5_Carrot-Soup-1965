Be careful about the vegetable stock you use. I find most store brands (canned or boxed) unpleasant if not downright repulsive. As a result, I can't give this recipe high marks as written.

lovely balance of delicate flavours but not bland at all. I'll make it again for sure. Would be a great starter for a simple meal followed by lamb chops and some garlic potatoes.

Simple and good! Used only 1 tbs of oil and skipped the cream. A low cal and comforting dish!

I have made this many times over the past couple of years. I could eat it by the bucket. I use it almost as written. I add the whipping cream directly to the soup - enough to add just a hint of cream, but not drowning the soup in fat. The sweetness of the carrots makes all the difference, so I try to choose thinner, sweeter carrots. The times that I've screwed it up, I've added too much lemon juice or too much salt. All-in-all, it's one of my favs for an easy, tasty soup.

This soup was fantastic! I left out the onion because we hate onion and find most recioes do need it. Does not need to add salt and the cream is not needed as well!

This is a lovely soup. I love spicy foods but I wanted a simple, comforting carrot soup and this is perfect. I wouldn't add ginger, cumin, curry - it doesn't need it! Like some other reviewers I increased the lemon and also made sure there was plenty of salt.

I enjoyed making this soup- very easy. I would use some ginger next time for sure as there is a slightly too sweet taste to it... I tried adding more lemon as some cooks recommended but that didn't quite hit it. I think the ginger would spice it up perfectly.

Great recipe that allows the bright flavor of the carrots really take center stage. I'm hesitant to roast the carrots first- I think it would make the carrots too mellow for this recipe.

Very easily made from standard pantry fare. The end result exceeds the sum of its parts. I doubled the lemon juice.

Made this on Christmas Eve, it was wonderful! I added a little more lemon juice than it called for. It is great with or without the whipping cream. Be sure to simmer the carrots long enough.

This was simply delicious. A marvelous comfort food that was easy to prepare. A savory recipe that I will make often. And don't skip the cream!

I searched hard for a simple/basic carrot soup receipe and this one was delicious. It's so tasty even my picking boys asked for seconds. I had to use Knorr veggie broth cubes for the broth (in a pinch) - and they added a nice kick - also don't forget to remove the CLOVES before blending !! We'll make this all winter !

Did not care for this recipe at all. Thought that it had no taste! Now this could be dependent on how sweet your carrots are, however, I also did not like the flavor of the cloves and the recipe barely made enough for two people. Easy and fast, but tasteless...would def. not make again.

Such an easy to make and tasty soup, I did add a dash of Nutmeg which I thought was yum also cut the garlic down to 4 cloves. Well worth trying, Enjoy ...

I really enjoyed this carrot soup - it was quick, easy to make, and very tasty. I used chicken stock instead of vege. Definitely a keeper.

This was OK. I did roast the carrots for more flavor. I also used leeks in place of the onions. Most of the liquid cooked off, so I had to add quite a bit back in, as well as more cream. Snipped fresh chives on top were nice. (For all you foodie readers, I was trying to approximate the French carrot soup that Ruth Reichl swooned over in her 1st book!)

Easy to make and a nice flavour. My family loved it. It would definitely make it again.

Simple and very good. It lets a carrot be a carrot. Serve with Spicy Black Bean Soup (Epicurious) and finish with sour cream for a fun twist.

I've made this soup countless times over the past 2 years. It's easy to make and, without the whipping cream, it's low-fat and delicious. It freezes very well too. The garlic can be overpowering, depending on your taste, so I usually use half the amount suggested.

dear god I hope the cook from Chicago was joking. this is very simple and very good. the only "special attachment" you need to make this soup is your brain.

I've made this soup several times, without the cloves, lemon juice and sugar, sometimes garnishing with grilled shrimp, sour cream and chives. Very easy, elegant and delicious!

I had to rescue the soup with a cup of very strong home made chicken broth. won't make this one again.

Made this last night. It was the first time I had made a carrot soup, and this one is delicious. I halved the recipe, but otherwise made as written. I will definitely make it again.

Have made this soup several times with Organic carrots my family loves it. Have substituted a bit of ginger or curry powder for the cloves and it is just great.

This was difficult to prepare. I was so lucky to have a Kitchen Aid special attachment and a culinary degree to assist me in this endeavor. The recipe is all off in regards to the broth amount necessary. I will admit the soup did turn out delicious, but a lot of work for your average cook! Roasting the vegetables is the way to go and adding a little cream in the actual soup as well as whipping and dolloping on top for the end presentation. I used ground cloves (not whole) and a bit of ground nutmeg on the vegetables while they were roasting. Good, but would only make for a special occasion.

This is a wonderful soup! I must gently suggest that the last cook who found this soup too thick probably did not prepare it properly. This soup is all about the carrot, and showcases its unique flavor wonderfully. I too blended in a bit of cream. This not only gives it a lovely creamy flavor, it also gives it a little more substance. My guests and I loved it and I'm making it again this afternoon -wonderful for a cool fall day!

This soup does not work on any levels of taste. It is too sweet , too thick (even though I added extra stock) and bland. I could not even finish my bowl, which is rare for me, and my son ate about 2 spoonfuls. And by the way, 1 fork should mean a failure.

Very good. I love carrots and have made a lot of carrot soups and what I like about this one is that it's just carrot soup! No potatoes, no fancy spices, just easy to make and quite tasty. I used half and half blended in at the end, instead of the cream swirl presentation. I'll make this one again.

I am not a big cooked carrot fan, but I have to admit this soup is pretty good. The only thing I chagned was roasting the carrots, onion and garlic. I agreed with the former reviewer who stated the taste was richer, deeper. Will make again.

This soup is totally wonderful.I got this recipe just about 2 weeks ago and have enjoyed it with different friend 5 times since, A good comfort soup. I decorated each soup filled plate with fresh chopped parsley and a circle of heavy cream. It looked as good as it tasted. Thanks a bunch!!!

My boyfriend raved about the carrot soup he had in Ireland so I had to try it. I made this recipe and he loved it, so did our families. I plan to make it again for an upcoming potluck at work.

This is the best carrot soup I've ever had. The pinch of sugar and addition of lemon juice at the end makes for the perfect balance of ingredients. I omitted the cream and it was excellent without it, making it a no fat recipe.

I'm not a big fan of cooked carrots, but I love this soup! This is the second time that I have made it (this time a double batch to share with friends for Thanksgiving). The first time I made it I was stuck without a lemon but substituted 1/2 cup orange juice which cut the bitter cooked carrot flavour nicely.

I love this comforting & flavorful soup. It is very easy to make (I used whole peeled baby carrots to cut down the prep time). Next time I make it I will try adding ginger root to give it a little extra spice.

On a trip to Ireland we had the best carrot soup, so I searched and found this one. It was easy, and very tasty. Don't skip the cloves, they give the soup a wonderful aroma. I skipped the cream. Fresh pepper is a definite must on this basic yet yummy soup.

Holy cow. This was so gosh darn good and easy to make. I was craving cream of carrot soup and this worked perfectly. I did not even use the whipped cream on top. It tasted awesome anyway. I can only imagine how good this will be on a cold, wintry night!

We all liked this soup alot. I roasted the carrots,garlic, and onions until they carmelized a bit. That helped to make it a very deep,flavorful soup.

This is a delightful soup. The various flavors really mesh well, and it is supremely simple to make. Highly recommended.

This is an exceptional recipe. Very satisfying and a real crowd pleaser - company and family. I like it with lots of freshly ground pepper at serving. Crusty hot bread makes a complete meal. Highly recommended. Often requested.
