Liked the dish, but thought the lemons were very bitter. Do you peel the lemon before roasting? I am definitely going to give it another whirl.

As others suggested, I used less butter and it was wonderful. It is very similar to chicken piccata, which I absolutely love, but just as good, in my opinion, and less work. I truly hate pounding chicken breasts thin!

Rating: 4
Excellent. A new family favorite. Like other reviewers, I used half the amount of butter and will probably only use 1 tablespoon next time. I also used 3/4 cup of white wine and 3/4 cup of chicken broth to give it more depth. Delicious and easy -- I made it while on a telephone conference and it still turned out great!

WOW!!! This was amazing!! My husband is gluten-free, so I used my own flour blend, wondering how it might affect the outcome. It was perfect!! I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, seved it over lemon basmati with grilled aparagus. I'd love to try the wilted spinach, though--that sounds lovely. This is going in my go-to file.

Rating: 2
I can't understand the high rating on this one; it's just a lesser version of chicken piccata. A regular chicken piccata uses fresh lemon juice for a brighter flavor and the roasted lemon slices are extra work and time for no gain. Also chicken piccata's thin chicken breasts (pounded or simply sliced thin) provide a more evenly cooked breast with more good crust flavor. I'll stick with the classic recipe: tastes better, less work.

My husband brought home a couple of lemons that he got at work from someone's backyard. It was a weeknight and I had just gotten home from work and I chose this recipe because I happened to have the ingredients on hand. What I'm trying to lead up to is to say that this was an easy meal to make, and was absolutely exceptional as written. I did not change a thing when cooking, and I don't plan to change a thing next time I make this (which will be for company).

Rating: 3
This recipe is super yummy. One thing to note: If you're going to use capers and olives (even if they're rinsed) DON'T add salt wherever it says to add salt. Just add to taste at the end. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was still good, but really salty. Made it again tonight without adding the salt and it was perfect. I also sliced the lemons ultra thin and roasted them for a shorter time. I liked that better than thicker slices. Served over rice. Yum.

Great meal--pleased 3 finicky kids and a husband who doesn't like olives. Substituted chervil foe parsley (didn't have any) and skipped capers for the same reason. Still came out wonderfully!

Gourmet recipe that can be prepared ahead and looks and tastes sensational. Used baby capers in wine vinegar(rinsed), pounded chicken, liked Sicilian olives but halved the butter.Have cooked this recipe for 12 - seared half the chicken in pan and then transferred to a baking dish with olives, capers and stock. 15 minutes at 200C. Added butter, lemon slices (room temperature) and parsley and returned to the oven for 2 minutes. Reduced stock on stove. Cooked rest of chicken in pan as per recipe. Served with garlic sauteed fresh organic spinach.

This was DELICIOUS. I made it true to the recipe and served it with rice and spinach sauteed in olive oil with a squirt of lemon, salt and pepper. It was a big hit for our family (including our 14 month old). There is A LOT of fat used in this recipe (which is probably why it's so tasty and moist), so maybe not the best choice if your watching your weight or cholesterol. Enjoy!!

LOVE this receipe! Sooo yummy and so easy. I sauteed in a separate pan some onion, red bell pepper, zuchinni and then added fresh tomatoe. I made some angle hair pasta. I put pasta in a large bowl with a small amount of olive oil & salt and peper. I then poured the veggies over that and then poured the chicken on the very top. I sprinkled with fresh parmagain and the parsley! That was our full meal and I served it family style. HUGE hit. I also did thighs and breast.

Rating: 4
Awesome dinner. My friends loved it, could not believe how tender the chicken was.

Rating: 4
I thought this was excellent, restaurant quality chicken. The only change I made was to use thinly sliced breasts which I prefer for faster cook time and tenderness. I also made sure to rinse my olives and capers well to remove the briny flavor. I seasoned the chicken lightly with salt and thought the end result was perfect. Topped with parmiggiano reggiano and served over angel hair, with roasteed asparagus and a green salad. Delicious!

Rating: 3
This was pretty dang good. I made it almost per the recipe but I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and put everything on top of yellow rice. Yum! I did not salt the breasts because I was worried the yellow rice would be too much salt, and it almost was, but the lemon cuts in. I would also add more capers next time, but that's only because my husband likes capers.

I made this using boneless chicken thighs and breasts for a dinner party last friday. True to the recipe, it was fast and easy! And delicious!! I used rather expensive pitted olives and fancy capers. The roasted lemon cuts the saltiness of the capers and olives. It took almost twice as long to roast the lemons at the temperature given and achieve the browning around the edges, but the resulting concentrated flavor was amazing. Will definitely make again! I would recommend pairing with couscous - but be judicious with the sauce, because it can be quite salty. Chardonnay is also an excellent pair. Enjoy!

Totally fabulous! This will become a weeknight staple.

OH MY!!! Talk about flavor!! This is PACKED with it! I did not have breast, so used skinless thighs. Cut back a bit on the butter and used cilantro instead of parsley because that is all I had. But minor changes... My whole family RAVED and demanded that this be a regular recipe. I agree!

Holy crap! Was this the easiest, most flavorful & moist chicken ever?!

Rating: 3
I officially totally screwed with this recipe on the first time out. First of all, I NEVER cook with boneless, skinless unless it's going on a shish kabob. There's no flavor whatsoever to impart but whatever whoever packaged them injected it with so that was right out. What I did do was this: I made a whole roasted chicken stuffed with meyer lemon halves, 4-5 smashed garlic cloves, rosemary, thyme, sage, and several small golden pearl onions. I squeezed the juice of one meyer lemon and one naval orange over the top as well as a little bit of salt, some fresh ground pink peppercorns and fresh ground telecherry pepper. I started the oven at 500 for 15 in a glass baking dish to collect juices, then 450 for 15, then 425 for 30 and let stand for 20. Once I'd collected about a cup of juices I started the sauce. I transferred the juices to a small sauce pan and brought it and the capers (left out the olives due to a sig other distaste) to a boil, added a cup of vegetable stock and then boiled until it was just a bubbling quarter inch of liquid, then I deglazed the pan with some pinot grigio.

Rating: 4
Delicious, a favorite at our house. The roasted lemons put it over the top and look gorgeous. I cut the breasts into chunks, use white wine to deglaze, and add a can of artichoke hearts. Squirt w/lemon before serving over rice so you enjoy all the sauce!

I enjoy dishes with chicken,lemon and capers and love olives. So I was prepared to love this dish but I didn't. The olives made it a little bitter and it just didn't come together.I also would flatten the chicken breasts if I made it again which I won't. Giada Laurentis has a wonderful recipe for chicken piccata on the food network and I'll stick with that for my lemon/caper fix. .

Used lime instead of lemons, didn't work, too bitter. Also, don't salt the chicken, the capers and olives give it plenty of salt.

this recipe is a classic and timeless. my scilian boyfriend was thrilled with the outcome. I had 3 chicken breasts on hand that I flatten a little. I used a variety of olives and reduced the amount of capers and butter. The roasted lemon slices were dynamite and KEY to the dish.

Contrary to some of the earlier reviews, I think the flavors profile was quite nice, not overly acidic. I followed the recipe almost precisely but I marinated the chicken breasts in plain yogurt for 15 min before I rinsed them and coated them with flour. I also squeezed half a lemon onto the dish while the butter was simmering. The chicken was really tender due to the marinade. I reheated some leftovers in the microwave and although it smelled wierd, the chicken stayed moist and it tasted the same.

Rating: 2
All in all, a good recipe, but I wish that I would've read more of the reviews before making it. I made two deviations: (1) left out capers since I didn't have any and (2) subbed half of the chicken stock with fresh lemon juice. Next time, I'll definitely pound out the chicken (otherwise it's hard to get the "perfect bite"). BTW, the fresh parsley at the end and the suggestion of serving it over garlic sauteed fresh spinach are MUSTS!

Rating: 2
I incorporated most of the ideas suggested; however, would probably not make again. I just was not wild about the flavors. While I individually love olives, lemons, and capers, the combination was not pleasing to me. I made some spinach with garlic and couscous with dried cherries and pinenuts as suggested by others. They were okay, but nothing special. My favorite chicken dish on Epicurious is still the Latin Chicken.

This is a great combination of tastes, but the chicken broth made it all taste poached and a little bland. So the next time I left out the broth, roasted everything else together and it came out great.

I made the recipe almost exactly as directed. I did use unsalted butter instead of salted. Neither my husband or I really liked the dish. It was decent, but there was something "off" about the flavor combination. If I were to make it again, I would omit the olives. I felt that they detracted from the flavors of the meal; and I have some other fantastic recipes that include chicken and olives.

Made this for a crowd at New Year's and it was excellent. I baked it in the oven (easier when you have guests I think). Here's what I did: Used skinless chicken thighs, instead of roasting the lemons, I juiced half the lemons and sliced half the lemons, and used half the butter. For the chicken, I browned the chicken on the stove in a pan, but then put the chicken, olives, and capers in a baking dish. Delazed the saute pan with the chicken broth and then added it to the pan. Baked the whole dish at 350 for 50 minutes (actually longer since people werenn't ready to eat.) Put chicken on a platter and put the pan on top of the stove to simmer. Added lemon juice, butter, parsley. Simmered until butter melted and sauce thickened a bit (3 min?). Poured the sauce over the chicken, garish with the lemon slices.

Loved this recipe. Don't salt the chicken. Rinse and drain the capers and olives. Use low-salt broth and unsalted butter. Substitute white wine for some of the stock. Use 3 T olive oil and 3 T unsalted butter. Use Meyer lemons, thinner skinned. Careful not to burn them. Serve over bed of spinach, or rice, or orzo. Wonderful!

I prepared this for the first time in 2001. I could not find Siclian olives, so the only changes I made were to use the brined green olives and I cut back on the amount of butter for dietary reasons. This is delish! My husband loves this every time I have prepared it for him.

This was easy and excellent. I did not use the olives (no one around here eats them), I cut back on the butter by half and used 1 and 1/4 cups broth and 1/4 cup white wine and panko bread crumbs instead of flour-it was delicious!

Rating: 4
As with all recipes, they should only be a guideline. I didn't have lemons so I didn't use them. I sauteed the chicken then finished it in the oven. Then I added my olives, capers and minced shallot to the saute pan. After I reduced the sauce, I finished with the butter. I didn't even pay attention to how much I used, butter is used to give your sauce a nice shine and to help it become nape. I served it with a simple pilaf. I made it according to my tastes and I enjoyed every bite.

Like previous reviewers, I omitted some of the fat. I only added about 1-1/2 T. butter. There seems to be an error in the recipe. I needed to cook the stock down for about 20 minutes in order to get the chicken cooked through and the stock reduced to a sauce.

We loved this recipe but did make some minor changes: drained off oil after browning chicken and reduced added butter to about 1 tablespoon. Had sauteed brocoli rabe in place of spinach because that's what I had on hand. It was all good! Will make again and again.

I love this recipe! I would agree that the butter at the finish is a little excessive. With cooking oil plus the natural oil from the olives, it seemed a little much and I didn't notice when I left it out before.

I liked this very much, though I wouldn't rave about it. I think I sliced the lemon too thinly before roasting since some slices practically disintegrated. Like others I gave it a slightly North African treatment by serving it with couscous with raisins and over wilted spinach with toasted pine nuts. I might try using preserved lemons, instead of roasted next time.

I loved this recipe so much that I made it twice in one week! The roasted lemons are absolutely key to the wonderful flavor of the chicken. I did have to cook the chicken on a lower heat than recommended because it almost began to burn, but other than that it was very easy to make. I served it on sauteed spinach, as recommended and it was wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly. The concept is great. I agree with the other reviews that it needs little to no butter. Next time I will slice the lemons on the mandolin to guarantee paper thin, uniform slice.

Served this with a couscous that had chopped dried sour cherries and pine nuts, as well as the recommended wilted spinach.

I faced a plethora of lemons and a couple of chicken breasts. So of course I searched on epicurious. This popped up. I had the ingredients and I figured this would be an ok last minute dinner.

I had some spinach and served the chicken as suggested. Definitely worthwhile. Do try it.

So simple - but such intense flavours! This is a fabulous recipe. I used chicken thighs, because they have more flavour than breasts, and garlic-stuffed green olives. I also omitted the capers and added a little leftover white wine to the sauce. I ended up reducing my sauce for much longer than the recipe suggested, and the result was tender, moist chicken and very strong, creamy lemony-buttery sauce - perfect! This is a terrific weeknight dish, but it tastes so good I would serve it for company as well.

I liked this recipe and I definitely would make it again - maybe even with a white fish next time. I halfed the whole thing, used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup dry white wine. I also added a clove of sliced garlic. I used only one lemon, sliced, but I was lazy and didn't roast it. The mixture came out a bit too lemony - maybe roasting would have made a difference? Still, I'll probably be lazy again and will just use half a lemon.

Woo hoo! This recipe is the bomb! I didn't use capers, but my very picky boyfriend said that the chicken was superb (the right temperature, tenderness). This breaded chicken and lemon/olive combination is extremely tasty. This recipe will get people to say, "___, you outdid yourself."

The combination of flavors are really wonderful. I've made this dish 4 times this month already for dinner guests. I cut 1 large lemon in half & roasted it until it almost falls apart. I don't like breaded chicken/fish so I didnt bread it, the flavor was still so intense it wasn't missed. I added sliced kalamata olives to the sicilian and followed recipe. I used angel hair pasta & added a tad bit of olive oil to keep it from sticking, threw in a handful of fresh parsley to make it colorful, then poured chicken dish over pasta in a big red serving bowl then squeezed the lemon juices over the entire dish -served. RAVE reviews. This recipe is a must - very easy as well! Enjoy.

A successful dish with the addition of some garlic, white wine and some fresh herbs. I definitely wouldn't leave the chicken in for the entire cooking time -- reduce the sauce without it, then add it back at the end. Serving it over spinach is not only healthy, it cuts down the effect of the salt.

This is a definite redo! I changed the recipe after some of the reviews. I did the 1/2 lemon and that worked. I also added garlic, mushrooms, and white wine and WOW, it was terrific. The parsley added some color. I served it with spinach, and broiled tomatoes and had a colorful dish.

This dish was excellent - I simmer the sauce a little too long though so i had to add more broth but overall it was great. I followed the recipe exactly and served over microwaved frozen spinach...that was all I had. Still - all of the flavors mixed very nicely. Only complaint - the olives made the dish pretty salty so don't salt the chicken too much.

Very good. It has more punch if you just use 1 cup broth and 1/2 cup white wine or vermouth. I don't normally use the parsley and it's fine. Garlic or shallots are also a good addition. I also slice the olives.

Rating: 4
Instead of slicing the lemons, I followed a friend's advice and just roasted lemon halves. After roasting for about 45 - 60 minutes I squeezed the lemon juice into the olive, caper, chicken skillet. It was incredibly easy, and I enjoyed the taste more so than the original recipe.

Delightfully simple. Tried it on the family, but agree it would be suitable for company. Use the full amount of broth: just don't be afraid to boil it down until it's syrupy, thus creating a lovely sauce to soak up with some good Italian bread.

Overall, this was very tasty and not difficult. I felt that the lemon flavor was too weak, so I would add some lemon juice next time, in addition to the roasted lemons. I also used a mixture of green olives and black nicoise olives, and it worked out quite well. I omitted the butter for health reasons, and it was still very tasty. However, there is less of a sauce to spoon over rice or other things this way.

Very good -- I used only one lemon, left out the parsley, and let everything stew in the chicken broth much longer than suggested, and it turned out well. I don't ordinarily like olives, but they tasted good in this dish. Good as a leftover dish, too.

Loved the flavours in this recipe. Added garlic and white wine. Used large pimento stuffed green olives and sliced them. Looked very pretty. Added flour to thicken as didn't have time to reduce stock. Also used zest of whole lemon and juice of half lemon instead of the roased lemon due to time contraints. Even with changes came out wonderful. Family loved it. This is a keeper.

This dish has become a staple for me since I discovered it six months ago. I serve it with rice because the sauce is so good. I've also substituted kalamata olives for the green ones and it worked fine. If your breasts are small you might want to remove them early so they won't overcook.

Oh, this was so good, and easy! I used half of the chicken stock and half white wine, and added sundried tomatoes as suggested by previous reviewers. I served it on a bed of spinach sauted with garlic, with risotto primavero as a side.

I thought this was fantastic. Served over a bed of steamed spinach. I took care to watch the salt -- rinsed the capers, used low-sodium chicken broth, no salt w/ spinach, and used white wine/chicken broth as others suggested. Also used slightly less butter and olive oil and dish was plenty rich.

Made this with sundried tomatoes in place of the olives - it was great. I also used half white wine and half broth, put in a little thyme, and just tossed asparagus in at the end and served with couscous. Very easy and quick.

I've made this dish many, many times and it will always be one of my faves. I've made a few changes over time though. Like one other cook suggested, I also subsitute 1/2 cup of the chicken stock for white wine (a zingy chardonnay works well). I also omit the butter and add 1 tbsp. flour to thicken the sauce, a little bit of lemon zest, and increase the parsley to about by an extra tablespoon or two (who really measures parsley??). This dish goes great with steamed spinach or asparagus, and maybe a bulghur pilaf. It's also just as good without the capers.

This dish was fantastic and is something that my husband asks for over and over.

This was so yummy and so easy to make! If you like lemon you will love this dish. I passed on the flour dredge and substituted 1/2 c. of white wine for 1/2 c. chicken broth and loved the results! It did take a while for the stock to reduce so I took out the chicken while reducing (it still was a tiny bit dry). I didn't have low salt chicken broth on hand so I used regular and it was a bit on the salty side (esp. with the added wine flavor) so next time I will use low salt broth. The lemony flavor is intense - my husband piled his lemon rinds to the side of his plate because they were "too much" for him, but any grainy side dish (pasta, rice pilaf, cous cous)will help soften the flavor for sensitive mouths. I loved and ate the whole thing - lemon rinds and all. It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe. Quick, easy, but impressive. I read the other reviews and got paranoid about the salt -- next time I will still use low-salt chicken broth but will not obsess about the olives, think I went a little overboard. Roasted lemons as directed, had no trouble -- they're delicious!

okay...I am planning to make this for a dinner party (20 + people) so I tried it out last night on my husband and adapted the cooking method for a "make ahead methjod" ....I cooked the chicken in the skillet for three minutes each side and then removed the chicken to a roasting pan....followed the recipe for the sauce...poured it over the chicken then covered with foil and baked the chicken for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees...the chicken was perfectly moist but I think the sauce was a bit bitter (and I used 1/2 the lemons) I think baking it like that intensified the flavor....does anyone have any other suggestions? the party is coming up....

This has become a staple in our house. And, yes, we eat the lemons - rind and all.

The first time I made this I loved it. Tonight I really hated it. It had an ubelieveably bitter flavor to it. I have no idea what I did differently....I even used the same type of lemons. I might try it again, but I think I'll skip the lemons and go for lemon juice instead. The capers and olives are great, and I use much less butter and olive oil than called for. I used my nonstick skillet, so I browned the chicken in 1.5 tbsp of olive oil instead of 5, and I only added 1 tbsp butter to the sauce. Next time I'll try it over spinach, too.

I really liked this recipe. Served with cous cous. I followed the recipe and cooked the lemons till they were only slightly brown on the edges but I think I may have cooked the lemons too long they got a little bitter. They are a beautiful garnish but are you supposed to actually eat them?

I LOVE this dish! If you like lemons and green olives--this is the dish for you! It's simple to make and looks and tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen! My tribe loves it so much that I make it at least once a month. We never get tired of it! Splurge and buy a good, tart, gourmet olive. I even use brine cured olives stuffed with garlic cloves. (3 forks for me is pretty darn good. It takes a truly outstanding dish to get 4 from me!)

I thought that this recipe had great flavor until I added the roasted lemons and then it became way too lemony. If I did it again I'd use most of the roasted lemons only as a garnish and only add a couple into the sauce.

I have made this 4 times in the last 2 months with little changes, but always excellent. I 1/2 the oil like most reviews, no butter and add 1 tbl honey and 2 of osyter sauce while reducing. I have also roasted kiwis and limes along with lemons. It's great but you have to be in for the even stronger flavour of the limes. This is currently one of my favourite dishes. It's my wife's all-time fav!

This recipe is terrific! It is easy, elegant (the roasted lemons are a very sophisticated touch), and readily made with ingredients that I typically have on hand. I cut the fat way down with only 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. The sauce reduced nicely with no flour or cornstarch. Only thing I'd change is the salt.... Next time I'd use unsalted butter and low salt chicken broth (which I didn't have on hand).

This dish turned out great. My friends are always amazed at what I cook and this was no disappontment. I tripled the recipe for a dinner party of 10 and everyone loved it. The leftovers were even better. Sicilian "pitted" olives were not to be found so I had to work with the pits, but it was well worth it. I did add more pepper to the recipe to add flavor. Can't wait to make it again.

This was good. It was a little sour, but it has lemons in it for crying out loud! I used half black olive, half green, and I rinsed them. Didn't think it was too salty. Chicken was very, very tender. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch.

Rating: 3
By all means cut back on the fat : 3 Tbsp olive oil + 3 Tbsp butter will make a perfectly adequate base for the sauce. Rinse your capers and olives to de-salt them and add the grated zest of one lemon in addition to the lovely roasted lemons. I made it for the birthday celebration of my lovely wife-if you put lemon on it she'd eat a bale of hay !

Rating: 3
Ok, hopefully the purists won't rage, but I was tired tonight, so I did not "do" the lemons, just added some (meyer)lemon juice, which to answer the cook from Houston's question, was fabulous. Also could not bring myself to use so much fat so did 2t butter. Finally, in lieu of dredging the chicken breasts, I used the flour to thicken the sauce, as previous reviewer had difficulty in this area and I don't like the "breaded" taste of dredging. Chicken was perfectly moist which surprised me as I cooked the sauce quite a while to thicken. I do love salty and sour, so it was a perfect disch for me. Looking forward to trying the dried lemons when I do for company.

Rating: 3
This dish works exactly as it should as long as one keeps in mind the need to control the salt of the capers and the fat in the oil and butter. Use salt-preserved capers and reconstitute them by soaking them in water and then draining them. Reduce the amount of fat by using 4T oil and only 2T butter...the sauce is still rich. Serve it over steamed fresh spinich...no additional fat. This cooks quickly and can be presented in a lovely server with the bed of spinich already in place. Great for a hot buffet! And if the chicken breasts are large they can be cut in half because this dish is very satisfying!

I have made this dish several times. It pleases me every time--so dynamic and delicious. I would like to answer the cook from Houston and say that in my opinion the capers and olives could--maybe ought to--be rinsed; that would make it quite a bit easier to control the saltiness of the outcome. Meyer lemons would give it a different taste; why not try it? The concentrated lemon taste--but not necessarily the sourness--is a big part of the flavor of the dish. Since the sauce is cooked down so much and its taste so concentrated, it is very important to use low salt chicken broth. The last time I made it I had gotten overconfident and didn't; all the various tastes in the sauce were masked by the saltiness.

Rating: 0
I just found this recipe in Epicurious and think it sounds wonderful. After reading all the reviews, I have a few points that I'd love to get others' opinions on before I make the dish: First, if Meyer lemons are available, would they be better than regular lemons since they are milder and have a thinner skin? Second, would it make sense to go ahead and salt/pepper the chicken and then drain AND RINSE the capers and olives? It also seems like it would be easy to overcook the chicken. I think I might take it out after it's browned and add back after bringing the liquid to a boil. Any suggestions? It sounds like a great dish!

Made this dish for New Year's Eve and was very pleased with the results. Contrary to other reviewers, the sauce reduced nicely (next time I will double it for extra - very yummy!) and the chicken cooked perfectly. I think the flavors blended very well and the butter added a nice richness. It definitely did not need extra salt - the capers (make sure to drain!) and olives added plenty. In addition to the great flavor, it was very easy to make. Highly recommended!

I made this dish several times and I find it way too acidic. Everyone loves it, though. I'd remove the lemons sooner and strain the capers completely as the other user mentioned. caper liquid is pretty vile indeed. Otherwise it's great. I served the chicen on a bed of white rice and spinach.

Amazing crowd pleaser; very tasty. Side dishes should be fairly plain as the seasonings are so strong in this dish. My only preparation difficulty was making sure not to overcook the chicken breasts while the stock evaporated; I think I overdid them a bit. Perhaps I'll remove them after browning as another cook suggested.

Excellent recipe...however, I added a little fresh lemon juice to the sauce while cooking and no salt at all. I also took the chicken once it had browned and placed in oven at 350 warpped in foil with the roasted lemons on top for about 1/2 hour will I finished off the sauce. Poured the sauce over chicken and served with pasta. Very nice dish-guests requested recipe!

Rating: 3
Liked it...sauce turned out very nicely, don't skip the butter--it makes it nice and creamy. Did find it awfully salty, though--no need at all to season the sauce with salt. Will use more pepper next time. Assuming the saltiness is due to capers? Any idea how to cut that down?

My first experience with Epicurious and the chicken was a definite success! I took the advice of others and did not add salt. I'll be back to the website and read the reviews with each recipe. Thank you, Chefs!

This recipe was fine except I would, as others have commented, slighty reduce the amount of lemon. Make sure you have enough liquid for the sauce, and I agree that a little white wine is good as well. I find bottles of capers to be slightly vile in their flavour (though I drain and rinse them and restore with sherry vinegar) and will search out salted capers, rehydrated, in future. Good basic with which to vault into the stratosphere.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes! The various people that I've made this dish for, prefer it with more olives and capers. Also, I use only one lemon instead of the two lemons that the recipe calls-for. I serve it on a bed of rice and roasted pine nuts.

LOVED IT! I used a meat tenderizer to flatten my chicken before dredging it in the flour. I chose not to salt the chicken as one rater said that it was too salty. I followed the advice of another reader and used sliced olives with pimentos. Served over orzo, the pimentos added a nice splash of color. I'll definentaly be adding this to my recipe book!

Made this chicken for my gourmet group. It was absolutely wonderful. Very easy to make, chick was nice and moist, could not find thin-skinned lemons, regular lemons worked for me.

This was the worst sauce I have ever tasted. I realized looking back today at the reviews that I could have prevented the disgustingly bitter taste if I had purchased thinner skinned lemons. However, nowhere in the recipe was this fact sited and as a result I was embarassed in front of my dinner guests. I'm sure it can be made well, but be sure to get the right lemons. I will not be making this recipe again, but rather will improvise my own rendition.

Yum! This was wonderful--I loved the way the taste of the olives, capers and lemons blended together. It was also incredibly easy to make, but good enough to serve to company.

When I read the reviews, I was a little concerned about the comment that the dish had a bitter taste. So after, I roasted the lemons I took my kitchen shears and removed the lemon peel.

This is a very nice chicken recipe. One modification I'd like to suggest is substituting caper berries for the olives-- I was very happy with the results.

This is a wonderful recipe. The reviews posted on this site were extremely helpful. I served the chicken over spinach sauted in olive oil with minced shallots. I also used the roasted pepper idea and served couscous with pine nuts stuffed in pepper halves. It was handy to roast the peppers at the same time as the lemons, I just left them in the oven a bit longer. The dinner looked and tasted fabulous!

After reading through the reviews for this dish I was curious. With 87% of people really enjoying the dish, I wondered what it was that the remaining 13% didn't appreciate about the recipe. -- I always wonder... While there are probably some who would consider me a bit liberal in doling out stars for this dish (and other recipes on this site), I know for myself that if a dish is just fair I simply don't bother to review it. That said, the recipes I review tend overall to be solidly good, wholesome, flavorful, dependable menu staples or (very rarely) are real stinkers that don't turn out according to the instructions given. As for this dish, it is really good and it is simple to prepare. Since it is also inexpensive, and didn't have the finish of boiled or reheated chicken it is hard to really have higher expectations. Heeding others suggestion that the sauce was salty, I chose to add lemon juice directly to the sauce instead of roasting the lemon slices. I also decreased the oil by half and used just a tablespoon of the butter called for. I added a few ounces of Chardonnay, which although not exactly original, did do a bit to curb the saltiness. I also soaked the capers. Lastly, I took out the chicken when it was thoroughly cooked and removed most of the olives prior to reducing the remaining sauce to a syrup. --Worked like a charm.

This is a wonderful dish. I've never tasted chicken so tender either. It does however require longer cooking times than stated. Try to use a Meyer lemon (only one needed.) You can use a clean brown paper lunch sack in place of parchment. Try serving it with wheat pilaf. Anxious to make this for company!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a very good recipe -- but a little salty from the olives. Next time I'll soak the olives a bit which I think will help. I thought the roasted lemons were yummy. And I did add a little bit of brown sugar (maybe a Tb) to glaze the chicken at the end which I thought contrasted nicely with the saltiness of the olives and the sourness of the lemons. As a side dish I made couscous with pistachios and raisins and then stuffed the couscous into red peppers. The couscous worked really well with the chicken. The pistachios in particular were very compatible -- next time I might add them to the chicken itself.

Both my husband and I thought this recipe was wonderful! The only thing that I changed was the use of garlic-stuffed olives instead of regular brine-cured green olives, and they were great!

I served with basmati rice, which soaked up some of the great sauce.

Used Meyer lemons and only added pepper at the end. There was a slight bitterness which could have come from the capers, but my husband told me that if you wash the lemons, it takes some of the bitterness away. The chicken was very tender. I only used about 1 1/2 T. oil total and 1 T. butter at the end, and we didn't miss the extra fat at all.

This is an outstanding recipe and it is easily doubled. I have made it several times for guests and gotten rave reviews. I use just enough oil to coat the pan, saute the floured chicken, then add olives, capers and stock and cook the chicken through before the guests arrive. I cover the plan and let it sit at room temperature for a while. Then, I reheat, add 1/2 the butter called for and the rest of the ingredients. I usually let it simmer for about 1/2 hour and the chicken gets really tender.

Rating: 3
This turned out great, but I revised it a little. I added some lemon juice in with the stock which turned out to be a good idea. Also, you need about half the butter, otherwise it gets way too rich. And, I would use the lemons as a garnish. They get too soggy and messy. I suggest this is not a recipe to double. The proportions aren't going to work. Namely with the stock and the butter.

Rating: 3
Overall this was a sound recipe and the whole family loved it. Three improvements I would recommend; Do not salt anything, simplify the lemon treatment and add 1/2 of a lemon jucied to the sauce. The price of parchment in my neck of the woods to high, perhaps a rack if you were to bake them at all. I used Meyers improved lemons and thin sliced them and added the lemons directly to thealmost finished sauce.

I thought this recipe was easy with excellant results. I love lemons, but thought they added a bitterness to the dish and would use them as a garnish the next time I make the dish. I don't think you need to use 5 tbsp to brown the chicken and would soak the olives to remove some of the saltiness.

This is a great recipe. It's not difficult to make. I would recommend a large saute pan to cook this dish in. Mine was too small. I also like the idea that one reviewer had of soaking the olives before adding them to the dish, although this only reduced the saltiness a small amount in the olives.

Would make this recipe again, but only in the following manner. I used Meyer lemons (sweeter & thinner skinned), and I LOVE lemons, but thought that they were marginal at best in this recipe. So, I'd skip the lemons. Second, leave the olives and capers in the pan (again, I LOVE olives and capers, but they overpowered in the end) when serving. Just serve the chicken. It's moist, flavorful and yummy. I served it with rice with lemon juice and feta crumbled in. It was the perfect side. My hubby and I both, however, when it was all said and done, loved the rice, loved the chicken and had a little pile of olives, lemons, and capers pushed off to the side of our plates.

This is the best chicken ever. I don't even like green olives or capers (made for husband) and I was lapping it up. I think the people that didn't like the lemon cut it too thickly or used lemons that were too fresh. The lemons need to be thin skinned like they get when they lose their gloss and get juicy. The lemons are the best part. I used 12 slices for 2 servings. Rarely repeat recipes but will be craving this one.

I haven't tried the recipe but want to make a comment. All lemons are NOT the same. Some parts of the country are blessed with wonderful, mild lemons. Others are stuck with more bitter, thick skinned varieties (I live in New England). This should definitely be taken into consideration when making the recipe.

This was a very tasty dish. I only had one lemon but next time will use two. Maybe the other viewers that thought the lemons were to bitter cooked them too much, just cook until they start to golden. My two year old even enjoyed it. I also served it on a bed of sauteed spinach and a side of rice pilaf.

Taking the suggestions of a few reviewers, we made this without the roasted lemons & added the juice of one lemon instead. This was great - I would recommend serving rice or bread to sop up the sauce - yum!

This was delicious! We love savory/sour dishes and the lemons were incredible. Definitely great for an easy dinner party too.

This was a nice dinner, but won't be added to my repertoire. The chicken was very tender, but the sauce just wasn't as good as similar ones I've made. The only changes I made were to soak my olives for an hour beforehand (the ones I bought were desperately salty!), and I reduced the butter at the end to 2 TBSP. I served the chicken on a bed of steamed spinach, with some ravioli medallions around the edge of the plate. The lemon slices looked great, and definitely added flavour to the sauce, but we treated them as a garnish, and didn't eat them - I'm wondering if the people who found them bitter did? I may steal the roasted lemon idea to use in another recipe . . .!

A very nice mediterranean entree, a great combination of things I love: capers, olives and lemons. Lemons were OK, not bitter. Thank you for this recipe.

I found the lemons very bitter and acidic. Are there certain types of lemons that would be more suitable? Also, the green olives once cooked became far too salty and strong tasting. The one good thing was that the chicken was very tender and juicy.

This chicken dish was a hit with my family. I used Meyer lemons (sweet) and garlic stuffed olives. The flavors blended nicely, and the chicken was tender.

This meal was a big hit! Everything came out perfectly and it was immediately requested as a menu staple. I took the advice of another reader and used the spanish olives, pimentos and all - highly reccommended.

Quite possibly some lemons are more sour than others. I found the acidity to be just a bit too much.

This is a chicken recipe destined for company! I only had one lemon and I sliced it quite thin, just right! Would keep everything the same except I might cut back on the butter at the end. The sauce was fabulous!

I did not find the lemons bitter. Make sure you roast them long enough and give them a decent amount of salt and you will have a delicious dish. The spinach (fresh) fit perfectly as a side dish, sauteed with diced tomatoes and garlic in a bit of olive oil.

It was much too sour/citricy and greasy for my family's taste. I would have used half the lemon and butter.

I would definitely make this again. The lemons should not be cut too thin or they fall apart. I had a hard time finding the olives in the grocery store and ended up with olives that were soaked with hot peppers, it gave the dish an extra kick. Next time I would substitute spanish olives, pimentos and all. The sauce was delicious.

Very tasty. I too thought the lemons were too bitter but know that they added too much to the dish to be subsituted. Great with the spinach. Will make again.

This was a wonderful dish! I made it for last night's dinner and it was a huge hit! It presented beautifully on the bed of spinach which was suggested and there was enough 'gravy' for the pasta I served with it. It is definitely a keeper! I just couldn't give it 4 forks....beyond compare? That might be going overboard??? :>)

Very simple to prepare. Makes chicken and elegant dinner party meal. Tastes like it was prepared by a fine chef. All rants and raves from my guests. Make sure to use thin skinned lemons to prevent the bitter flavor reported in other reviews. Will make it again and again and again......

The lemons and their prep was simple and easy and they added a great deal to the dish..In short a perfect combinaton of chicken,capers and lemon...I'll make it often

I really enjoyed this dish, although I agree that it tasted a little bitter. Next time I will probably just squeeze a little lemon juice into the sauce and use fresh lemon slices as garnish. I pounded the chicken which made it really tender, I only used 1/2 the butter requested and increased the stock amount to 2 cups due to suggestions from previous reviews. Overall, a tasty dish.

A keeper! I used less oil and butter, but it was a hit! The Sicilian olives had great flavor, and the lemons were not bitter at all!

Excellent! This dish is similiar to chicken picata with the addition of the olives. The roasted lemons are an elegant touch and we didn't find them bitter. The lemon flavor on the bed of spinach is a nice combination. Serving it with pasta as one reviewer suggested is a good idea because of the rich sauce.

My husband and I both really liked this dish. The chicken comes out so juicy and flavorful. I served it over a bed of spinach pasta, which turned out really well. You have to like lemon to like the recipe as it is, but I think it's great!

It was a little salty probably because of the olives I used, and the fact I used regular broth. I added some basalmic vinegar towards the end and it was incredible, really added depth to the sauce. Next time I am going to try oranges as well. I was so impressed with this that I would certainly make it for dinner guests. Even my picky husband who wouldn't know a caper from a cootie loved it!

I followed the recipe the first time, but on the second made some variations. Try using oranges instead of lemons, and marinating the chicken in orange juice (with a little hot sauce if you like) before cooking.

I made this for the first time to a house guest and was pleasantly surprised at delicious it was not to mention the presentation was beautiful. I served this with a cauliflower gratin and roasted asperagus. I thought the lemons were a nice addition in taste and appearance, but wondered if they were peeled before roasting might cut down on the bitterness. I will make this again and again!

I tried this recipe served on the recomended bed of sauteed spinach, and other pletes with a bed of a crispy fried parsley. The second was better rated with my 12 dinner guests.

This was really good! I would definitely cut down a bit on the oil and butter next time, as it was a little greasier than I would've liked. But even so, the flavors were amazing and the lemons were a delicious addition--I would never have thought of roasting lemons. I actually would've used slightly more stock, as my chicken took a while to cook through and I hardly had any sauce left by that time. I served it with sauteed spinach. I will definitely be making this again.

I agree with Russ about the lemons. They were very bitter. I would make it again though, it was a big hit, and easy to make for a dinner party for 10.

I made this with large chicken tenders and served it at room temperature and everyone loved it and went back for more

My mom made this and it was the greatest thing I had ever tasted. She substituted kalamata olives for the green olives, but otherwise kept it the same. I'm making it for my school's pre-fast for Yom Kippur!

I made this the other night and it came out well. Flavorful and yummy. Everyone loved it. I served this w/ pasta and tomato sauce on the side. It's quite rich if prepared as described. When I make it again, I will cut down on the amount of oil used to fry the chicken (from 5 Tb to 3-4 Tb). Also, the amount of stock they suggest takes forever to reduce. I'd use 1c instead. I'd also add a little less butter at the end.

While the recipe was certainly easy to make, and it made a lovely presentation, I think there are other easy yet pretty chicken dishes out there. The lemons ended up tasting very bitter (and I love lemons) and the olives I bought weren't pitted (pitted olives can look pretty bad) so we had the addition of olive pits on the plates. Overall it was okay, but I would look for other recipes.

After spending a week of sadness, eating dinner at the breakfast bar glued to the TV, we felt a need to have a normal Sunday dinner with candles and quiet. I chose this recipe and it was elegant and light, yet earthy. I served it with rice and spinach would be a lovely green to go with it.
