Perfect late summer dish with local peaches in season. The crunchiness of the beans were a nice counterpoint to the grilled peaches. Loved it. I didn't have any fresh marjoram so tried it with thai basil from the garden, which also worked well. Will definitely repeat this recipe!

OMG this was soooo good. Was looking for something special to do with green beans from my neighbor's garden. This solution surpassed my expectations - by FAR. I have been trying to eat smaller portions lately...but confess that I sucked on the bones after devouring the pork. My mouth watered when my husband made the marinade and got the pork going earlier in the day...But then being able to taste more of the incredible marinade as a dressing on the beans? Sublime. And grilled peaches are always great. And beautiful. What an easy and special mid-week meal. That is when we test "company" meals, and this one definitely made the cut.
