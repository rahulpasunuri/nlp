First of all, you must like sunchokes to enjoy this recipe. They have a very pronounced flavor that overtakes this dish. I do like them so I enjoyed the flavor. When I first made this recipe, I followed the instructions of boiling the sunchokes and then boiling the potatoes and sunchokes together, then mashing them all together once tender. I found that the sunchokes didn't mash completely. There were tiny little granules of sunchokes in what should have been a very smooth mashed potato dish. I found that very off-putting. I liked the flavor, just not the consistency. The next time I made this dish, I boiled the sunchokes separately. When tender, I pureed them and then pressed them through a fine mesh sieve to get out the chunks. I boiled the potatoes next. I mashed the potatoes and added the sunchoke puree, sour cream, and chives, as well as a small chunk of cream cheese. Much better.

I used low fat sour cream and scalions instead of the chives and the creme frache (sp). It had a nice light taste. Without the additions I think it would be same old, same old.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed the directions -- and it tasted like Dr. Scholls inserts. It was nasty.

Couldn't, for the life of me, find jerusalem artichokes. Substituted parsnips for our English Menu for 17 at Christmas. Turned out pretty good. Used scallions, or onion greens, instead of chives. Family prefers straight mashed potatoes, I'm afraid; but I liked it.
