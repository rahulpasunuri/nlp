Very easy weeknight veggie recipe. Loved the size, totally feeds four. Also would be great for the veggies that come to our tacos nights.

Made this for dinner last night. I LOVED how simple it was to put together--a great vegetarian weeknight recipe when you don't want to spend all night chopping up vegetables or over the stove. I doubled the recipe since I was serving four, and we had about a half a loaf leftover. Health-wise, it's not too bad. I used part-skim ricotta with no problem, and corn tortillas are so much healthier than flour. I'll probably make again.

I'm not "forking" this as I made so many changes. This is a great template to use up fridge stuff! A keeper for that reason

I'm giving this 4 forks because it's so easy and very good. Definitely adaptable. I modified it by making it a casserole dish rather than loaf pan -- the cutting of the tortillas sounded a little crazy to me. Didn't strain the salsa, and it was totally fine. I added garbanzo beans because they were the only canned beans I had on hand; they were really good, but I think black or pinto would be even better. I used more corn than called for and I'm glad I did. I also didn't have any cilantro but it was still full of flavor. I think this could take just about any veggies on hand, and I love the idea of adding shrimp (chicken or beef would work well too). I think it would be good with a side of spicy rice and refried beans (assuming you didn't put beans in it). Very easy, very flexible, and very good!

We really enjoyed this simple little dish. This is a perfect size for three, maybe four people. Four to any more than four you probably want some chips and salsa to go with it. I like all of the ideas everyone suggested, and am looking forward to trying it again with some additions.

This was easy to make and yummy. Travels well for potluck or food gift--took to a friend recovering from surgery. Was so easy to prepare I made it all over again for my family when I got home. I added diced cooked chicken and black beans. Next time will add onions and have jalepenos to offer on the side.

I bake this in a round baking dish that fits corn tortillas perfectly. I roast the vegetables separately. The corn and zucchini take different amounts of time. I usually do this while I'm doing something else in the kitchen so it doesn't seem to be "taking any time". I'll try adding some beans sometime in the winter...I like the light roasted veggie style for summer eating. I do increase the cheese a bit.

Healthy and delicious (husband had THREE helpings!!!). I added black beans and lean ground beef. Double the recipe and allow for much more salsa for moisture. Serve with sliced avocado.

This was great to use up left overs and an easy weeknight meal. I will definitly be making this one again.

Delicious! The zucchini took a lot longer to roast than stated. I used Desert Pepper Corn Black Bean Roasted Red Pepper Salsa and extra black beans in place of the corn and salsa. Yummy!

Amazing! I always double the recipe and freeze one. Adding roasted vidalia onions as well as black beans adds extra flavor and texture. I also use flavored flour tortillas (chile, sun-dried tomato, and/or spinach all work well).

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet back in '95. It's quick, easy, and delicious and you can vary the ingredients according to what you have on hand. Lately, I've been making it with flour tortillas and not bothering with the whole business of trimming them to fit in a loaf pan. The flour tortillas fit perfectly in a deep dish pie pan.

This was great-- I made it for my vegetarian sister who was visitng from Texas. Served it with avocado slices and sour cream, which was delicious. I made a full casserole pan instead of loaf pans since I knew I'd want extras. Added extra veggies as suggested by others -- roasted fresh a couple of bell peppers as I think the jar kind are a little mushy. I did not have a problem with squash seeds. Refried beans & black olives were great, I skipped the artichoke hearts as the dish was getting a little pricey. No need to cook the tortillas first. I covered the dish most of the baking time to prevent it from drying out and cooked it longer (45 min) at 350 as suggested. One thing to make sure, if you are increasing the recipe don't forget extra mozarella, I didn't have any left for the top and that was kind of sad. But I would defnitely make this again. It was great for dinner, made a good lunch the next day and then we had some more as a side dish at brunch the next day!

I thought this was simple, easy, and filling. I think it would be better if the tortillas were lightly fried first, and if more ricotta was added (at least a half cup). Next time I'll try the flour tortillas and add beans as other reviews suggest.

I thought this recipe was tasty and fairly easy to make - a nice weekday menu for a vegetarian. I added refried beans with lime and layered them in, and baked it in a larger loaf pan than called for. It could've used a bit more salsa, and next time I think I'll make more of the cheese mixture.

I love this recipe and make it as often as I can, particularly for guest. However, I find that substituting flour tortillas for the corn ones is a great addition.

This is pretty good but not a show-stopper. Will make it again, though because it is so easy.

Awesome! Easy and delicious weeknight dish. I've made this several times, subbing with veggies I had onhand.

I have made this simple dish many times, including for 125 people in our summer island community - it gets rave reviews, even from kids. I don't bother to cook the tortillas, just layer them as indicated.

I loved this, but it sure didn't take me 45 minutes -- probably because I didn't want to get two baking pans dirty so I roasted the veggies in two shifts in the same pan. Save a bowl by draining the salsa over the sink -- you don't use the liquid anyway. I added some leftover black beans, and as others have mentioned, this recipe would accommodate a host of additions: artichoke hearts, olives, chilis, etc. I took a previous reviewer's advice and baked for 45 mins. at 350. Wasn't quite hot enough, so I'll adjust next time. If you don't have ricotta on hand and have to buy it, you'll find yourself with a LOT left over, so plan ahead to make stuffed shells or something else to use it up.

Easy to put together, filling and tasty. This will go on my weeknight dinner list, and I think it should freeze well, so I can stash a few away for emergency food. The only recipe mod I made was accidental -- 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup ricotta, and no jack cheese on top, since I mixed it all into the ricotta. And it did take longer than 12min to get hot all the way through. It also seems to be a recipe that is quite tweak-friendly -- I intend to try it with a variety of different veggies & different types of salsa.

Really good. I liked the idea of using tortillas instead of noodles. I took the suggestion of previous reviewers and added beans and onions. And I also agree, don't skip the lime juice. It makes a nice flavor addition. One quibble: This recipe uses a lot of dishes. In the future, I won't strain the salsa and will save myself some clean up.

Very quick and easy recipe for a weeknight meal. I don't think it is necessary to roast the corn, mine came out chewy. I diced my zucchini before roasting. Next time I will try dicing a red bell pepper and roasting it with the zucchini, rather than using the jarred peppers. I only had 5 tortillas, but quartered them, and layered to cover. It was a sufficient amount. Will definitely try the other reviewers' suggestion of adding black beans.

An easy and tasty dish - what more could you ask for? Be sure to use the limes since it really does finish off the dish wonderfully.

My fiance and I both loved this! We ended up picking the roasted red peppers out of it as we were eating it - for some reason their flavor didn't seem to go with the overall flavor of the dish. That being said - this is a very tasty meal and we'll be making it for dinner again soon.

This is a great recipe as is and also because it's open to so many variations, depending on what's around. Whether you add bottled salsas and/or bean dips to the layers or increase the veggies as I have by adding onions and spinach to the ricotta mixture or layering yellow squash with the zucchini this dish remains a spectacular and easy favorite. Last night I added shrimp to the spinach/ricotta and that really turned it into a company entree!

Great recipe and lots of room to adapt and play with. Roasted 2 fresh red bell peppers vs. using jarred. Did the zucchini and corn in 1 layer on a sheet pan. As I cannot eat spicy food, cut salsa by half with chopped tomatoes and some of the juice. Could have baked longer at a lower temp.(450) to heat all of the way through and make tortillas a bit softer. Used a low fat Mexican blend cheese and low fat ricotta. Lots of fresh cilantro to top. Totally delicious and very easy. Will definitely make again. Great served with a tossed salad with oranges, jicama and avocado. Could easily serve 3.

This very much deserves 4 forks: not because it's elegant or fancy, but because it's easy and delicious. The second time I made it I made these good changes: I roasted the veg in two shifts in the same pan (too much to wash up 2 baking sheets), I added a few more corn tortillas, I used black bean salsa (has tomatos too), I added canned artichoke hearts and I tripled the cilantro (although it loses flavor when it cooks, so it might not make a difference. Definitely put lots of fresh cilantro on top before serving!). My only complaint is that at the end of the meal you've got a bunch of cans and jars to recycle: makes lots of waste. But I guess that's the price you pay for speedy recipes.

I made this dish in a disposable foil pan the night before a group of us left for camping. I covered it and put it in the fridge overnight. When we got to the campsite the next evening, it was dark and cold and everyone (vegetarians and meat eaters) loved this dish after it warmed over some coals while we set up our tents. It was easy and so perfect to take on the go. I will definitely make it again. It was a huge hit!

this recipe was great! i roasted fresh veggies from my garden -- zucchini, corn, scallions & hot peppers. i used a little more monterey jack for my cheese-aholic husband & a really great salsa, "salpica" (chipotle & garlic). i think you could use any veggies -- broc, cauliflower, whatever's left over & it'd be great. i also used flour tortillas w/out a problem. i'll try corn next time. mmmm!

Delicious recipe.Much lighter than other tortilla dishes made with meat and beans. Usually I put sour cream on dishes like this but it was not necessary. I would definitely make it again.

Quick and easy. I made this when we were thoroughly sick of eating Xmas turkey leftovers. I used small eggplants from the garden in addition to the zucchini and corn, and roasted them about 18 minutes. Medium salsa gives the dish a nice kick.

YUM!!! This far exceeded my expectations. Based on tips from other reviewers, I doubled it (made in a lasagne pan) and added a can of mixed beans (kidney, pinto, and black). For salsa, I used an organic Muir Glen chipotle salsa, which gave it a nice kick. I also used whole buffalo milk ricotta. This would also be good made with flour tortillas or corn pasta. I was surprised at how quickly I put it together. I baked it for 30 - 45 minutes at 350 instead of 12 minutes at 500. I will definitely make this again. Delicious!

This is a great recipie. I always double it and freeze one. I roasted the veggies longer than suggested last time and they were great. You have to play around with the right salsas etc.

This was delicious and so easy. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes to the salsa; next time, I will add some canned fat-free refried beans to make it more filling. I saw no need to cut the tortillas; ripping them works just fine, and overlapping is not a problem.

A fantastic and summery dish! We prepared it with the olives suggested in the previous review, and adapted the dish to serve more. It's straight forward, scrumptous, and even reheats well! :o)

This is a quick and delicious casserole. I put the zucchini slices and green scallions on the grill before addding them to the dish. Sliced black olives is also a great addition. My husband loved it.
