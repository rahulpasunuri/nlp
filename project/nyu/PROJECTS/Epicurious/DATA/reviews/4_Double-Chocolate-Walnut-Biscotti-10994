Very easy to make and bake! Added almonds instead of walnuts. Added large. choc. chips instead of reg. Mixed dark choco. chips with reg. Make your own variations with this one recipe

Fab-u-lous! I left out the walnuts (allergy) and used chocolate chunks instead of chips. I also used 3/4 teaspoon salt. They are wonderful dipped in white chocolate. Don't forget to let them rest before slicing...it makes cutting them so much easier. Perfect cookie to enjoy with a cup of tea by a nice warm fire on a cold winter's night.

I have been making these biscotti for years and just read the reviews. Thanks to one and all for some great suggestions. In the past I took a biscotti class and the teacher, a renowned, published Italian baker, said that biscotti should be cooled for 30 min. before the second baking. For this recipe, I agree with the other reviewers that 5-10 min. Is ideal. Using the electric knife also allowed me to make thinner biscotti, which I prefer. Will definitely add vanilla and espresso powder the next time. I dip the tops of the cookies in Callebaut dark semi-sweet chocolate. Exquisite!

Very good with the following changes: 3/4 cup cocoa, half the salt, 1 teaspoon instant coffee, 1/2 cup of oil in place of the butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, a full cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup almonds instead walnuts. I also like to cut them a bit thinner, closer to 1/2 an inch.

Delicious! Made a few small variations: Hazelnuts instead of walnuts, chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips, and I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla and of espresso powder as well. Measured cocoa generously and reduced salt slightly (would not suggest halving as some did). Before baking, washed with egg white and sprinkled with granulated sugar for a nice finish. Really, really good recipe.

Rating: 4
Excellent and super-easy recipe! Beautiful when sprinkled with confectioners sugar (as the recipe suggests). Dipping them in melted chocolate puts them over the top, but well worth the minimal effort. I accidentally put the whole stick of butter in, instead of 3/4 stick and substituted mild chocolate chips instead of semisweet -still came out just fine. You won't be disappointed in this recipe!

Although the flavor is good, after following the recipe exactly the biscotti crumbled severely when I attempted to cut it after several minutes. Such a disappointment, as although it is delicious I would be embarassed to give it as a gift

The best chocolate biscotti I have ever made, or tasted. I used half the amount of salt. Definitely a keeper.

A few changes from the recipe, and thanks to all the other contributors for their suggestions. I had no need to butter and flour the baking sheet, as I formed the logs on a floured board, so they had a coating of flour which prevented them sticking to the baking sheet. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and toasted them first, and used a mixture of bittersweet and semisweet chips. I also added 1t vanilla and 2t instant coffee dissolved in a small amount of boiling water. I like these biscotti a lot, but they did tend to be a bit crumbly. I do like the fact that their texture is crispy as opposed to the hard texture usually associated with biscotti.

I thought this was one of the best biscotti recipes I have ever made. The cookies did not stick to my baking sheet whatsoever; I just sprayed it as the instructions called for. Definitely add a teaspoon of vanilla and a bit of instant expresso powder to heighten the chocolate flavor. I plan on making this again when I need biscotti.

Loved these biscotti. Took readers advice and added some vanilla, very nice. Also added some chopped dried cranberries. Also very tasty. Today I am going to try making with dried cherries. I also used dark chocolate cocoa powder, you can keep the same sugar level and this will cut the sweetness. I will try again with regular, although I really really like it with the dark! Had no trouble slicing at all. Did slice while still a little warm, this helped get through the chocolate chips. Tried scoring one loaf and not scoring the other - used electric knife and no need to score. Also baked them on metal cooling sheet on cookie rack and the 10 min was plenty of time to get them crisp. Love them!

I did like the flavor of the biscotti, but almost half of the biscotti fell apart when I cut them. Maybe it would've been better if I had a serrated knife on hand.... As recommended by other reviews, I made these changes: 1) cut the salt to half and it was enough salt. 2) added a teaspoon of vanilla which was nice and 3) baked longer in the end.

I have made thousands of biscotti, and these were very good. But, I had great difficulty slicing them, and broke at least a third. I tried to slice while they were warm, cool, and cooled completely. I used my electric knife as suggested.

Used a whole stick of butter and all the salt - definitely benefited from the salt, as I think it heightens the chocolately goodness. Had to bake (the second time) much longer than 10 minutes to get them crisp, and I even baked them on a metal cooling rack over a baking sheet (which I have done before) so the heat could circulate all around. Dipped 1/2 of the bars in melted white chocolate. Delicious.

Because I have gluten allergies I use Almond flour and 1/4 cup gluten free flour. I have to say it is so delicious not flat dry but denser. Yummy, several of my friend have said they never tasted biscotti as great as this and they are in their late 70's. the younger ones loved it as well.

Read all the reviews, checked against by own personal favorite walnut pepper biscotti recipe and made the following adjustments. Increased butter to 1 stick, reduced flour to 1 3/4 cps, and reduced salt to 1/4 tsp. Great recipe!!! Dough was easy to handle , confectioners sugar gave them a nice finishing touch and cutting was a breeze after 5 minutes with my electric knife. Many thanks to the reviewer who suggested it. I forgot that I even owned one. The deep chocolate flavor is great. Just had one with a glass of red wine, Lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

This is a wonderful recipe. Do not skip on fine cocoa and chocolate. I have repeatedly made this recipe for Christmas gifts. Always a hit.

I made the biscotti as written with the exception of the white flour. I only had whole wheat flour and they turned out beautifully. I used Fry's Premium cocoa. I agree with others that the biscotti probably needed to be baked for more than 10 minutes to crisp up. Next time I will double the time as they were a little soft in the centre. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper!! Deep, delicious chocolate flavour. I wouldn't change a thing.

Rating: 4
Indeed this is an excellent recipe, especially for a novice cookie baker like myself. I am not a fan of too-sweet desserts and usually cut down the sugar in recipes, but feel for this one the amount of sugar is appropriate. I also used Droste cocoa, chopped up a dark chocolate bar into little pieces and used the walnut baking pieces you can buy at Trader Joe's. These are definitely worthy to make for holiday gifts, and the fact that they keep longer that regular cookies is a plus.

Sorry about the size issue in my yesterday's review as I just printed the recipe out and saw that it was not 3-4" but 3/4" slices!

These are very good and no more difficult to slice without breaking than any other biscotti I have made. I followed the recipe exactly except I only had 5 Tbs butter so added 1 of oil. I used dutch process cocoa as that was all I had. The slicing instructions are a little ambiguous- at first I thought that the slices should be 3-4" thick but I sliced them my usual 1".I then realized that the 3" probably was the length which you have little control over once you have made the logs and cut on the bias. Giving the thickness would have been more helpful. But overall a very good recipe.

I have made this recipe many times because it is excellent. My newest variation was to use roasted pistachios and 1l2 tsp orange oil. Yum! I also routinely add 1 tsp espresso powder with the eggs and 1 tsp vanilla. These additions just improve the flavor. Before I cut them, I lightly spritz with water so they do not crack as much.

I am a caterer and have been making these for a long time. Often I'll add a touch of cayenne pepper or mixed spice (an english spice mix like allspice) which adds a depth of flavour. Or, I'll add a a tsp of vanilla and use dark chocolate cocoa although they are good whether using premium cocoa or regular Hersheys. I dip the ends in white chocolate and often add chopped hazelnuts or forego nuts entirely for the nut-allergic. Often I'll score them before I bake, makes cutting easier but agree easier to cut when warm out of oven as they will break if not careful. Hands down best recipe for biscotti!

Got on the internet to search for biscotti recipes & found this one. Since the previous reviews were mostly positive, I decided to try it. The recipe is very, very simple to make & easy to follow. The results are exactly like I want biscotti to behave. I think the secret to not having them crumble is to cut them while still very warm -- I had no problems using my serrated knife. They're in the oven right now at 275, drying. I'll turn them at 8-10 minutes & cool them on wire racks. The pieces I've tasted so far are delicious.

We made this for my boss' birthday, and she fired me. LOL, just kiding! She loved it, and we do too. We use a little less salt and cocoa powder, but other than that, everything rocks! We find rolling it into 4 logs instead of 2 reduces the cooking time too.

Oh my goodness these are absolutely amazing!!! I was tempted to change some things after reading a few reviews, but I didn't. The recipe is perfect the way it is. I only added the chocolate chips to half the dough though, and I found that I prefer the biscotti with NO chocolate chips WAY more. The chips change the flavor too much. This will be my favorite chocolate biscotti recipe forever!

Great brownie-like biscotti. Made them for a coffee club morning and they disappeared. My suggestions would be to decrease the amount of salt and bake 15-20 minute on each side to get them to crisp up. Otherwise its a lot like eating a dryed out brownie, rather than a traditional biscotti. I also had to add about 1 TBSP of milk to get my dough to come together. Overall the best chocolate biscotti I've made.

Rating: 4
I made these today. The BEST. I agree with the other reviewers - the taste of these is just perfect. I don't like chocolate chips IN biscotti so I left them out. But I'd dip or drizzle them in melted chocolate. I used the very dark, more expensive cocoa. The dough is great to work with. You will be sorry if you don't try these. I will take 4 or 5 to work everyday until they are gone.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for when I wanted chocolate biscotti. I didn't just want it chocolate flavored, but fudgy, and with dark chocolate! The chocolate chips added this bownie richness, not to metion the chocolate bottoms I put on them. I did this by melting semi-sweet chocolate chips and simply speading it on the bottom. I stored them in the fridge and put wax paper in between them so the chocolate would stay on nicely. I highly recommend this recipe! Don't forget to add a handful of extra chocolate chips to the dough, if you are a chocolate fiend!

Wow, these are great. I have made them a few times now and they are delicious. I used dutch process cocoa as I love the darker colour and deeper chocolate taste and they are so awesome, we even save the broken bits and crumbs and eat them!

Amazing chocolate flavor! To assuage my guilt of eating biscotti for breakfast, I set out to make these as healthy as possible-I stuck to the recipe's measurements but used whole wheat pastry flour with a mixture of other whole grains. I also halved the sugar, nixed the chocolate chips and added some dried blueberries. They were amazing! I actually got away with serving them as desert at an impromptu dinner party and no one was the wiser (about the whole grains).

Oops! Previous review from me is actually for the Chocolate Orange Biscotti! Here is my review for Double Chocolate b/c I made this, too. Based on other recipes, I agree with: LESS flour, LESS salt, TOAST the walnuts, and bake second time 20 minutes each side (again, I have a gas stove, so this may make a difference) Overall, these biscotti are rich and crispy! Perfect chocolate flavor!

I agree with others. This recipe is delicious! Here's what I also agree with based on other recommendations: add MORE orange zest and MORE Grande Marnier, BAKE longer first time for total 40 minutes and SECOND TIME for total 15 minutes EACH SIDE (i have a gas stove, so that may be the difference). My biscotti were crispy and light- perfect with orange tea or bourbon and egg nog!

these are delish and buttery (whoops, added a whole stick of butter). made these with the holiday biscotti (on site). mixed in some white choc chips with the semi-sweet. with the help of fellow reviewers, i was a biscotti-makin' pro. help #1 handle the dough with wet hands. #2 REALLY make sure the top is smooth (wet hands help), it helps prevent the crumbling when cutting.

This is a new favorite. It was so so easy and much better than my first batch. The first time I tried to make biscotti the roll was very hard to work with but it was a different recipe. The only thing I changed on this recipe was cut the salt in half. I think 1 teaspoon was just too much. I also baked 10 minutes on each side after cutting.

Rating: 3
I really like this recipe. The final texture of the biscotti was crisp and chewy but not dry or crumbly and the chocolate flavor was great. Excellent for dunking in coffee. The only change I made was to use almonds instead of the walnuts. A trick I have found that works well with biscotti is when it is time to slice the loafs I use my electric knife. It cuts quickly and cleanly and the coookie does not crumble. Also, I stand my biscotti up for the second baking.

Rating: 2
My wife loved these, but I thought they were just ok. They were so similar to the flavor and texture of a cumbly dried out brownie that I'd just rather eat a good brownie! For biscotti, I'd much rather have something a little more distinctive and not so strictly a desert cookie... flavors like anise, almond, lemon, orange, cinnamon, etc. Take any of those and dip them in dark chocolate to get your chocolate fix. Anyway... The recipe is sure to please some, and if you are looking to include a chocolate biscotti in a variety platter or gift, then this would be a good bet. I found these did not quite crisp up as well as other biscotti made.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy! I've tried other biscotti recipes (the "classic" ones without butter) but enjoyed this much more. I did end up baking it for about 15 min on each side during the second bake (30 min total as opposed to the suggested 10) because they weren't crisp. One thing I noticed was that when I first baked the biscotti, the top cracked a bit in a few places. Why is this? Does anyone know how to prevent this or what is causing it?

These biscotti are delicious and my family loved them. Thxs also for the advice regarding cutting them somewhat before baking. They cut beautifully. To Cambridge MA. I'n not sure why your biscotti would be so salty but re natural or Dutch processed the rule is that Dutch processed should not be used if baking soda or baking powder is included in the recipe, because Dutch processed is alkalized and will react w/the levening agents.If no leavenings are in the recipe you can use either Dutch or Natural. Good Luck..

I just made these for the first time, and I really wanted to love them. Unfortunately they came out sort of bitter/salty. Anyone have any suggestions as to why? Also, any thoughts on whether the cocoa powder is meant to be dutch process or not? (I'm wondering if maybe that's the issue...)

Rating: 4
rather than buying chocolate chips, I buy good bittersweet chocolate by the chunk, I chop it unevenly, and I never measure, although I know that I am putting a lot more than a 3/4 cup worth of chocolate. it's hard to work with the dough when there is more chocolate in it, but I love to find the bigger bits of chocolate in the biscotti! This recipe is ALWAYS a success. A great gift.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions; it helped. I made these into chocolate-orange-hazelnut biscotti using Green & Black's Maya Gold chocolate bar, chopped in place of semi-sweet chips, and added 1/4 tsp orange ext and 1 tsp orange zest.

This biscotti recipe is pretty good. I used toasted hazelnuts instead of walnuts. The only comment I have is next time I would add something to it, like vanilla, anise, rum, expresso-- anything like that-- to give it a little more dimension, which would make me give it 4 forks instead of 3.

Very good, rich, chocolate-y biscotti. I used Ghirardelli Double-Chocolate chips. Didn't dip or drizzle anything on the finished product, because they didn't really need it... a good trick I learned is to score the top of the baked logs with a serrated knife where you plan to slice them, then use a sharp chef's knife to cut through them the rest of the way - worked beautifully!

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Deeply chocolately, but not too cloyingly sweet. I too have had trouble with crumbly dough. What I find has worked is to combine all the dry ingredients as written, then add only enough of it to the wet ingredients to make a smooth, pliable dough. This way the proportion of baking soda, salt, etc., in the dry portion doesn't increase as it does when you decrease the flour only. I dipped these biscotti in melted chocolate and chopped toasted hazelnuts at one end. Yummy!

Was tempted to give this 4 forks- very simple to make & excellent cookies! I found the dough fairly soft, so shaped the logs using parchment paper rather than my hands. Also, I toasted the walnuts. This is a keeper.

These turned out well. Picking and choosing among other reviewers' suggestions (thanks!), I toasted the walnuts, used butter instead of margarine, did not bother with confectioners' sugar, reduced the salt, and reduced the flour to 1-3/4 c. I meant to add vanilla, but forgot, and it wasn't a problem. I also used a mixture of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips and Ghirardelli double chocolate chips, and threw in some extras. I'm about to make them again, and will further reduce or eliminate the salt (didn't like that I could taste the salt in the finished product). I'll also add more chocolate next time -- maybe another 1/4-1/3 c. -- and might add dried cherries this time instead of nuts, or in addition to nuts in half the batch.

First time making Biscotti and it turned out perfectly. I really whipped the sugar/butter mixture before adding the eggs and it was EXTREMELY fluffy -- and maybe that helped, because the dough was simple to work with. No problems at all with the execution of this recipe -- it also cut easily with a serrated knife. FYI for those of you who watch what you eat, these Biscotti turn out to be worth "3 Points" under the weight watcher's system (I calculated the entire recipe and divided it between 30 biscotti). A fabulous treat! My 12 year old, who doesn't like Biscotti, found that she DID like them at the end of the first baking session.

I've made this recipe twice in the last week. I've made it just as written. YUMMMM! Slicing the logs into cookies is a bit tricky, but I've used a serrated knife and it's worked fine if I'm patient and let the dough guide me a bit (meaning that you need to work around the placement of the walnuts and chocolate chips). But that kind of interaction between the technique and the material is such a wonderful part of cooking!

I've made these biscotti at least 5 times, and they always turn out fantastic. I put them in my Christmas cookie tins and my friends and family are always delighted. I do add some cinnamon as one other reviewer suggested and I also toss in some white chocolate chips for color contrast. Chicago: Try this: Carefully slide the loaves onto a large cutting board before slicing, and then use a large (I pull out my 10-incher), honed chef's knife. I've never had any problem with the slicing using this method. Good luck from an ex-Chicagoer. And Go Cubs!

Fantastic recipe--I followed the advice of the other reviewers and decreased the amount of flour to 1 3/4 cup, increased the butter to a whole stick, and added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract.

I made these biscotti as a gift and it was very hard to part with them. I did adjust the recipe a little. I used chopped hazelnuts rather than walnuts, which gave the biscotti a wonderful taste (like Nutella). I also topped them with melted white chocolate. I cooked them on each side for 15 minutes so that they were extra crunchy. Delicious!

This recipe was incredible! I made a batch and brought them to work and within a couple hours they were gone with requests to please make more! This is a great easy recipe to make and had a deep rich "oreo" cookie taste. EXCELLENT!!

Rating: 4
Fantastic! These are great as a snack or with coffee/tea. I did make some small adjustments to the recipe: cut the sugar by 1/4 of a cup, and used Ghiradelli's cocoa (which I increased by 1/4 of a cup for more chocolate flavor). I skipped the powdered sugar. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 2
I left out the confectioner's sugar and I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder that I found at the natural foods store. Overall they were pretty good but a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I might reduce the amount of chocolate chips or leave them out altogether. There is another biscotti recipe on this site (with almonds and dried cranberries) that we like a lot more. I found this recipe to be crumblier than the other recipe we tried....but I don't claim to be a biscotti expert....so my problems could probably be chalked up to lack of experience.

This was a great recipe! I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this was good. I substituted the walnuts for lightly toasted chopped hazlenuts and added a bit of orange zest. I also used mini chocolate chips. The biscotti was a bit crumbly when I tried to cut it, so I might use another cook's suggestion and decrease the flour to 1 3/4 cups next time. Also, I used an electric knife to cut the biscotti and this worked beautifully. I decorated the biscotti with swirls of white chocolate, melted and piped out of a small ziploc bag. I'm going to use these biscotti to try the 'biscotti parfait' recipe on this website with coffee ice cream. MMMMM!

These received rave reviews. I underbaked them so they could be eaten without dunking.

Oh is this the perfect recipe for chocolate biscotti. I was a little worried when I first saw how crumbly the dough was but after they baked-- the aroma and then the taste was out of this world. I used Hersheys dutch cocoa and they were great. Next time I shall try them without the nuts and add orange extract or peppermint extract for variety. Definetly this is a keeper recipe-easy to make and great for a cookie swap around Christmas.

This is the first time I have made biscotti and this recipe was terrific! Very easy, very chocolatey and quite yummy. I did not find it too crumbly but used a very sharp knife to cut it. Also decreased the second cook time to 5 minutes. I will toast the walnuts first next time just for added taste and fun! A keeper!

Fantastic! It was my first attempt at biscotti, so they weren't all pretty. I had to make some adjustments for altitude (incr flour, liquids, temp; decr baking soda and sugar), and they weren't quite perfect, but I can tell this recipe will be worth working on. My new favorite chocolate fix. . .

I've been looking for the perfect chocolate biscotti recipe, not too sweet...but nice and rich...well this is IT!! Already I've sent this recipe to three people. Everyone thtas tried it loves it.....trust me. I even drizzeled some melted chocolate on them for drama during the holidays.

Rating: 3
They were very good. However, they were a little crumbly, but not terribly so if you were careful when cutting. I did alter the recipe somewhat. I used slightly less butter, about 5 tblspns, added about 1/3 cup white chocolate chips and 2/3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips, as well as about a 1/2 cup each of crushed walnuts and crushed hazelnuts. I also added 3/4 tspn vanilla extract. I baked them for another 4 minutes after they were cut instead of 10 minutes and I think that was still too long. Next time I will probably just turn off the oven and place them in it for about 2-3 minutes after they have been sliced, so that they will not be as hard, but firm instead.I omited the confectioners sugar. The dough is very thick and you have to squeeze all the chips and nuts in. Keep your hands wet when forming the logs.It is definitely worth a try though.

This is the second time I have made this recipe & although they are very delicious & chocolately I agree that they are just too crumbly & will probably not make them again. I have made biscotti several times & have not had this problem with other recipes.

These were a hit at Christmas last year. I left out the nuts, and added peppermint extract for a mint chocolate biscotti. Very good.

Loved them - I subbed pecans for walnuts and because I never think you can have too much chocolate - I dipped the ends in melted chocolate! - A word of encouragement for novice biscotti-ers - try again - I didn't have good results with any recipes until I had made biscotti 2 or 3 times - I think with practice you get the hang of how thick to make the logs and how thick to cut the slices relative to cooking time so that they end up not too brittle and overcooked or undercooked etc

This was an excellent recipe! I don't like nuts, so I left them out. Also, I used the mini chocolate chips and added about 2 Tablespoons of grated orange peel, and allowed the dough to sit, to give the orange flavor some time to permeate the dough. Delish!

This is the biscotti recipe which replaces all others in my collection! By the way, white chocolate chips work well if you don't like nuts.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Used pecans as I did not have walnuts. Also did not dust with icing sugar, as it makes it messy after biscotti are cut. Try to use the best quality cocoa powder you can get (Belgian or French)and you got a first-rate product. If you like chocolate, these are simply irresistible.

Rating: 3
Very delicious chocolate biscotti! Recipe halves well to give a perfect number for a dinner party for 4, allowing for discarding the 'ugly' ones from each end of the log (which my boyfriend and I ate like brownies, before the second baking - yum!) and a little bit of wastage due to crumbling. I turned the slices and baked a little longer to get optimal crispiness - I like very dry biscotti for dunking. Turned out very crisp but not so solid you break your teeth on them dry. Aside from halving the recipe, I followed it *exactly*, using good quality organic dark chocolate that I chopped myself for the chips. Comments included "I'm not a great biscotti fan, but these are great!" and "I think these are the nicest biscotti I've ever eaten." Will definitely hang on to this recipe! ;)

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe, although I honestly thought that 1 tsp salt was too much - I could actually taste the salt in teh batter. Next time I'd cut that down to about 1/2 tsp. Wetting the hands and then shaping the dough into logs is easier than flouring the hands, which creates a total mess.

Rating: 4
these are awesome, and the butter helps. last night i tried a different recipe with no butter(from the wonderful "room for dessert" book, don't know what went wrong) and it was a sticky, messy fiasco. the recipe is easy, and the dough is easy to handle. i baked mine for about 30 min. and then 10 min. the second time, and this worked fine. they're crispy but not too crunchy - great alone or with coffee. i would really recommend this for someone who's never tried making biscotti before - it dispells all mystery.

My batter was so thick, I had trouble getting all the dry ingredients in. When I printed out the recipe, some of the words of the instructions did not print out on the right hand side.Apparently my printer only prints 7 inches wide. I had to go back and fill in the missing words.

Good as is. Yes, the dough is stiff; it was the final straw for my dying rubber scraper... Use a sturdy wooden spoon to scrape the bowl! I baked for 30 mins instead of 35 because I like biscotti less hard. I also tried letting it cool for 15 mins instead of 5 to facilitate slicing. Looking forward to trying the variations with orange, vanilla, etc.

Excellent recipe! The end result is a perfect biscotti texture - crisp, dense, and flavorful. I was worried that the cocoa would be overpowering but it turned out fine. I went with another reviewer's suggestion to use cooling racks for better convection and was pleased with the results. Also, I used toasted almond slivers instead of the walnuts. My fiance ate them as a breakfast, a snack, and a desert... all in one day! He suggests serving them with an orange cappucino and is looking forward to the next batch.

I really like these! I hate walnuts so left those out. Nor do I like coffee so I make these as a snack or dessert. I only baked for about 28 min. the first time so they don't end up too crispy. Using mini chips is a good idea.

This is the first biscotti recipe I've tried & I'm really happy with the results! Commercially, I have a hard time finding my favorite brand; this is a great substitute.

This is a delightful recipe. This is my 1st time making biscotti and I'm hooked. I too added 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla. Also, I was at the end of several bags of nuts, so I used a combination of almonds, walnuts, & pecans. Drizzled with white chocolate which snazzed up both the presentation & the taste. Be careful about the 35 minutes baking time though. Luckily I was keeping a watchful eye, as 35 minutes was too long even though my oven has a tendency to be cooler than specified. Friends raved. P.S. After making another biscotti recipe, I realized that the dough was a little too stiff, probably due to the addition of cocoa powder. Next time, I plan to reduce the amount of flour a bit to compensate.

This is the best biscotti recipe. I've been making these for several years. I get several requests for the recipe, and I have had people offer to pay me to make some for their family gatherings. This is definitely one of my favorite cookies to make. One thing I've been doing the last several times is I melt between a 1/4 and a 1/2 cup of white chocolate with a teaspoon of vegetable shortening in a plastic sandwich bag (microwave on a low setting)and snip the very corner of the bag with scissors making sure that the hole is not too big and just drizzle the chocolate back and forth over the biscotti and let them sit until the chocolate hardens. They look so professional!

Great recipe! If my family hadn't seen me making me them, I don't know if they would have believed that they were homemade - they were delicious AND made a very nice presentation. The hardest part is not eating all of them when they come out of the oven after the first bake! Yum.

this was a disaster. I must have done something wrong, because these things turned out like little rocks. they tasted awful and i threw the whole thing away. I timed everything just like everyone said to, though. all I know is that I've made other biscotti recipes and this was by far the worst.

I've made these several times now and they've always come out great.

These were tasty and very easy to make. The advice everyone has given is right on...if you do not use unsalted butter, reduce the amount of salt to 3/4 tsp; wait 10-15 minutes after the first baking to slice the logs; bake it 15 minutes the second time for a perfect chrunch to these cookies.

This is a great little recipe. I have never made biscotti before and I was almost a little scared of making them. They are not as difficult as you might think. They took a little less than 30 minutes in my oven and were not too difficult to cut. I think using a very sharp serated knife is the trick here. I took one other reviewers suggestion of dipping the ends in chocolate and it was a great one. My family loved them. I will be making some to have with coffee for a Christmas day treat. Definately a recipe to try.

These were relatively easy to make and taste yummy. For me they are too chocolaty, I would probably cut back the chips and add more nuts, but my husband thinks they are wonderful as is. We prefer them a little crispier so I left them in a little longer than 10 minutes after cutting them, though I did notice they also crisp up a little once cooled.

I haven't come across a recipe with so many good reviews like this. If your biscottis don't turn out, you've definitely done something wrong. This is the first time I've made biscottis and although I don't know what good homemade biscottis should taste like, I was nevertheless very satisfied. I used mini choc chips and only baked 30 min. I think it still got a bit burnt. Gotta watch the oven next time.

I tried this recipe and would like to respond to some of the earlier comments. Biscotti dough *is* stiff. Don't try to make this with a hand mixer! Second, they are a little crumbly but if you use butter not margarine, they will be less so. One other tip, use miniature chocolate chips, they distribute better in the dough. I also prefer pecans to walnuts for this recipe.

This recipe has a major flaw--1 teaspoon is way, way too much salt. Maybe it was a mistake. The biscotti were inedible as the recipe stands but it could be a good recipe if the amount of salt was cut to no more than 1/2 tsp. I didn't have much of a problem with it crumbling when I cut it right after the 5-minute resting period and held the pieces together gently. I also found it necessary to "knead" ingredients together to combine, as the dough was so stiff.

An absolute hit! So easy and quick, wonderful aroma and flavor. Watch the first baking very carefully, especially in convection oven where baking time is much shorter. Use quality serrated knife to slice and bake on both sides for crunchy flavorful treat. My family begs for more each time I make them!

These were great and several people have asked me for the recipe. Super easy too. After baking the log whole, I sliced them and baked them again on EACH side. Delicious.

This is an excellent recipe of the type one can use as a master recipe. Add or change some of the flavorful ingredients and you have a new product: Use chocolate covered expresso beans for half of the chocolate chips (I use Ghirardelli), add a tsp. of ground expresso beans, add a tsp. of cinnamon, add a few tbsps. of homemade sugared, minced orange peel, drizzel melted bittersweet chocolate over the top of each piece. To achieve more of the traditional texture of biscotti, I have been substituting bread flour for all-purpose (12 gm. protein per cup) Next time I make this recipe I will substitute bread flour and note the results.

This is one of my favorite biscotti recipes. It's just chocolatey and sweet enough but not overdone. The sprinkled powdered sugar is a nice touch AND taste. This recipe won rave reviews from guests!! A must try!!

I was extremely dissapointed with this recipe. It tasted wonderful, but only 4 turned out right from the whole batch. They fell apart when I tried to slice them. I was planning to use them in my holiday cookie baskets, but they are almost all in crumbles!

This is the easiest biscotti recipe I have found. I'll definitely make this again.

I have been making these since 1994 and they are always a hit--people actually call me and request that I make them, one man wanted me to sell them to him for his deli--they are great!

Ditch the walnuts and replace with pecans. Top each slice with a whole pecan half and you've got the best companion to a mocha or chai tea that human hands can create! S.

Excellent recipe! The biscotti look so good, I am wondering which coffee shops I can try to sell them to.

From the very first batch - these have been outstanding. I bring them to 'Christmas Potluck' get togethers every year, and get demands for more when the tin is empty. Only difficulty I encounter (and this may just be me) is slicing the baked loaves -they tend to crumble a bit, but every piece is delicious

I've added this to my Christmas cookie gift baskets based on all the rave reviews. This one is a definite keeper!! Thanks.

All my friends demanded the recipe, refusing to believe it was homemade. I concur mostly. I believe it is better than commercial biscotti because 1) it's fresh 2) it's crispy, not hard and 3) it is absolutely delicious!

These are delicious and very easy to prepare. Toast the biscotti on both sides for a really crunchy texture. I make biscotti often and always do this (something I learned from my mother) and always get positive comments about the texture. Really adds to the dunking ultility.

I have made this biscotti recipe since it appeared in the magazine. I make it every year for Christmas and keep most of them for myself although I have to tell my family and friends that I don't have anymore! They are delicious and keep well in the freezer.

This recipe is FABULOUS! Easy and delicious. It was a hit with adults and kids both. (I replaced the walnuts with cashews with terrific results.)

A cook from Albuquerque, NM on 10/1/99 Absolutely delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts and are the best I've ever made. My husband who doesn't care for biscotti, loved them.

If you want to take a quick trip to heaven, try these biscotti. People will moan and swoon when they bite into them--no exaggeration! Very easy to make too. They make wonderful holiday gifts!

Yumtastic! A trick when cutting them... use a serrated knife and gently hold the sides of the biscotti.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes, both in terms of results and ease of preparation. The trickiest part is cutting the logs into strips without having them fall apart. Well worth making.

We loved these biscotti! And they're really easy to make; if you've never tried something like this before, this is the perfect recipe to start with. The only suggestion I could make is to use miniature chocolate chips, but that really doesn't make much difference. These were the best biscotti I've ever made, and they were very well received by everyone who tried them.

This was quite an easy and tasty biscotti recipe. The chocolate is indeed especially pronounced, as the recipe indicated.

This is the world's best biscotti recipe. They are to die for. I make them with good dutch cocoa and don't skimp on the chocolate chips-I use Guittard-they are wonderful!
