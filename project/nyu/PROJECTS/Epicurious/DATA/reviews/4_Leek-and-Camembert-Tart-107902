Made the same crust as America's Test Kitchen's tomato tart, pressing the two puff pastry sheets together, cutting off a 3/4" border and pressing the strips back onto the rectangle, making a rectangular "boat". Used Home grown leeks and paired it with an Ethos Chateau St Michelle Chardonnay.

Classy, tasty and adaptable. I've made it with Gruyere, Stilton, Brie, Cheddar and hard goat cheese. It just works with everything.

Really good, not hard. I just cut it to the size of my jelly roll pan and made it in there. Mine crisped up nice, although it took a bit longer than 20 minutes. Nice flavours too, needs a little more spice or something, I put some salt in and next time maybe something else. Beautiful!

Delicious! I did make a slight change though...I used goat cheese instead of Camembert because I didn't have any on hand. Rather than cook it in a pizza pan and take a chance on it running out, I used 2 pie plates. Next time I will use a tart pan though. The presentation wouldn't have won any awards, but the taste was fabulous.. This is definitely a keeper.

A reader mentioned using the frozen mini tarts for this recipe. What would be the amount of cooking time for this method? Thanks for any input. It sounds yummy!

Very easy to make and super tasty. I modified the recipe slightly by adding some garlic and a chopped tomato and using coffee cream (10%) and just one sheet of puff pastry. Baked it in a pie dish; didn't have any trouble with it being too runny. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again. (This dish also can be prepared ahead of time and chilled until ready to bake.)

I've made this several times over the last couple of years. My favourite way to do it is in little phyllo pastry cups (as an hors d'oeuvre), but I've done it in 10" piecrust shells too. It's been a winner every time.

I have a feeling this tart could be spectacular  the flavors are wonderful. However, I did mine in an 11 tart pan to avoid the runniness problem that other people had, and instead I had a sogginess problem: the crust was not cooked at the bottom, even though the rest of the tart was. It was still tasty, but a real mess. I think pre-baking the crust would solve this problem. I will definitely make this again, and in the tart pan, but pre-baking the crust.

Amazing! It's possible to use onion instead of leek - it's delicious too! Another, easier version is to mix both leeks and custard (at the end) and just pour it over the crust ;)

WOW! What a hit! I made this for a group of over 40 women and everyone raved about them. My best compliment came when more than 5 times I was asked for the recipe. I tweaked this to make it into mini-tarts, or popovers, as I called them. I rolled the puff pastry to be thinner, used a drinking glass to make a template, then used a Pampered Chef pastry tool to put the crust into a mini tin. It wasn't hard, and I am useless in the kitchen. The next tweak came with dicing the leeks instead of just slicing them. When they cooled, I stired them into the custard mixture and used a gravy ladel to spoon the perfect amount of mixture into the mini tart shell. I had to really monitor the time, about 20 minutes, and do keep in mind that the custard will continue to cook when you take it out of the oven. ENJOY!

This will stay in the repertoire! It does make one HUGE pizza-like tart, but everyone I've served it to loves it that way. I roll the puff pastry out a bit larger than directed, then cut a circle to fit my 16 inch pizza stone. I use the "corners" to build up a 1 inch-tall wall. The custard is not that much liquid; I've never had it overflow or leak, but it doesn't seem dry or like it's not enough. I do cut the rind off my cheese for easier melting, but I have had it refuse to melt smoothly in the custard. I used it anyway and it was delicious as ever. I serve this with the Bon Appetit pork chops with cornichons and mustard sauce (also Epicurious) and a simple green salad for a fabulous French-themed dinner.

This was really good. However...I had the same problem as another cook -- even though I pre-chilled the crust, the sides of the puff pastry collapsed while baking and everything leaked out, causing the smoke alarm to sound when I opened the oven...the tart itself was not burned, but it resembled more of puff pastry pizza than a tart by the time it came out of the oven and on to the plates. Any suggestions? I think maybe next time I will try making it in a tart pan that will hold the sides together.

I made individual tarts using regular tart crust. Served it as a first course on a bed of lightly dressed greens. Guests are still raving. I did remove the rind but would also like to know if this is necessary.

Wow!This was 'melt in your mouth' good. This was the 3rd course of 10 in our annual New Year's dinner last year. I served small portions (not doubling the recipe), and our foodie friends were moaning and sighing with heavenly delight.

Guests raved about this recipe both times I've made it. The first time I tried it, the camembert/cream mixture curdled while melting them together, so I tried again and it happened again. I knew that both the cheese and the cream were fine, so I served it anyway - it tasted delicious, and I can't figure out what happened. The second time I made it, they melted together beautifully. I removed the rind from the cheese each time - does anyone know if that is unnecessary?

In the last year I've tried other appetizers, but I always come back to this winner. Without exception, everyone raves and asks for the recipe. I've awakened several of my guests to the "joy of leeks" through this great appetizer. Also, I had lost this particular issue of Bon Appetit, so I am truly grateful for Epicurious! Thanks!

Simple and tasty. Made early and served at room temperature with a small salad on the side as an appetizer. Worked very well and not too heavy.

Excellent appeziter - easy finger food for 4 couples. As mentioned, its best right out of the oven. I tried it based on decent reviews & because I had everything inhouse -I did substitue carmelized onions for the leeks as suggested by reader below. Based on this I expected good - but maybe not FABULOUS. I was pleasantly surprised by it being FABULOUS!!!

This made an elegant presentation and the flavors blended well. I thought preparation was rather simple - I pressed the dough into a tart pan and had no trouble - and it was tasty but not a knockout dish.

Excellent recipe: easy to make and very yummy. But DON'T serve it at room temperature. The cheese custard really shines if the tart is warm.

I'd give this a 3 1/2 if that was an option. I don't really know if anything is "beyond compare", but this is incredibly good. I made exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. Really easy to prepare, I did it all early in the day on Christmas, and then popped it into the oven for five minutes just before dinner to rewarm slightly. Served as a first course, with cold Prosecco, followed by prime rib with roasted garlic and horseradish crust, and potato gratin with goat cheese and garlic (both also from this site) Almost good enough that we didn't want to go on with the rest of the dinner! (Almost!)

This was very easy and delicious. I used chedder cheese instead of camembert and cracked black pepper instead of cayenne and nutmeg. I also added another egg to increase the volume to fit in the dish I used. My husband and I loved it and I will be definitely making this dish again. Thanks Epicurious.

This is VERY GOOD! Served it with a salad, a butternut soup and homemade bread for a pretty wonderful veggie meal. Very easy to make. I used a goat/cows milk local camembert which was great. Two less than adventurous teenagers also loved it.

To the cook from CT, I have made two smaller tarts many times following this recipe, and the cooking time and temperature remains much the same. Just be sure to carefully switch the positions of the two tarts after about 10-12 minutes to ensure even cooking. If you are baking on a dark baking sheet, or if you have an electric oven or one that runs hot, start checking at about 15 minutes, otherwise, start checking about 18 minutes in. When you pull out the oven shelf the custard should be fairly set and you should be able to slip a spatula under the tart to check the bottom. It should be browned and should not bend, (if it bends it is not fully baked and the pastry will not be flaky but doughy in the middle.)

Very light and yummy. Two guests at the dinner party both said they "could eat this forever". However... I added sauteed asparagus to the mix, which lent it a nice spring-y touch, and I recommend stuffing the tart to overflowing with the vegetable mixture, and drizzling the egg mixture till you can barely see it through the veggies. Otherwise, it's too much egg and not enough veggies, and quickly turns heavy.

Good grief, Heartland, get over yourself. You make it sound like puff pastry is spaghetti sauce or something simple like that. Making things like puff pastry is a labor-intensive waste of time when you can get equally good results and flavor from frozen.

Yum! I made one big tart; seems like the little tarts made by some of the earlier reviewers would be easier to eat. I'd be curious to know how you adjust the cooking time. I had to use Brie because I couldn't find Camembert in my grocery store.

Everyone loved this as a Father's day starter. The middle of the tart crust was a little soggy, so I will try to make two smaller tarts next time. I could hardly keep my 12 year old from dipping pieces of melba toast into the cheese mixture...maybe an idea!

To the Cook from Santa Cruz: Please explain what you did to the pastry with the mini muffin tins. I would love to serve these as an appetizer this weekend but am unsure how to make small appetizers from this recipe.

Rating: 4
AWESOME! I made individual servings using a mini-muffin tin. And because the tarts would be small, I diced the leeks. To make it easier, I mixed the tender leeks with the custard and used a gravy spoon to ladel the mixture into the pastry shells. EASY! made 48 small bites. My guests thought I had the dinner catered! That's the best insult/compliment I could ask for, since I don't normally get such raves.

Yummy!! I made this recipe as an appetizer for Mother's Day. Instead of making one big tart, I made individual ones as suggested by another reviewer. I was a little worried when the tarts were baking in the oven. The custard mixture was running out of the pastry. I was afraid the pastry wouldn't rise and that it would be soggy, but it turned out really well. I think the problem was not having the custard ready to fill the tart shells right away. The tart shells had thawed a little so, maybe that was the problem. Everyone raved about how good this dish was and were looking for more. I will definitely make this again.

This was awful. The sides of my pre-chilled puff pastry quickly collasped in the oven, and the custard dribbled everywhere, leaving me with a big mess to clean. The taste of the tart did not make up for the disaster. I must admit my husband loved it, but I found it nauseating.

OH MY GOODNESS! This is so good! I made it last weekend and everyone at the table loved it! I just served large slices of it with a nice salad and the meal was a winner! Simple, simple, simple! I was almost embarassed to admit to my family how simple and quick it was to make. I made the recipe as listed and wouldn't change anything. Brie would probably work just as well but why take chances! Yummy! I wouldn't mind a slice right now!

OK, I haven't made this specific recipe, but I've given it 4 forks because it's so similar to one I made a few years ago. I haven't been able to locate the recipe on this site and have sorely missed it! The only difference between the 2 recipes is camembert vs. brie, the cayenne and the shape - which as the cook from Lake Placid noted, can be varied. This promises to be as delicious as the original. Happy cooking, all!

Although I did not personally make this recipe, I did enjoy many slices of it as our Easter dinner appetizer, and it was truly sublime. The lovely flavours melded beautifully together and it was an elegant and tasty treat. Highly recommended and it would be great with a tossed salad for lunch or brunch.

WOW!! This is outstanding!!! I think it's one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten! Don't change a thing! By the way, you can make it larger, smaller or whatever shape you want, by forming the puff pastry to your desired shape.

Heaven!!! Next time I will make smaller circles - slices were too hard to handle and plate.
