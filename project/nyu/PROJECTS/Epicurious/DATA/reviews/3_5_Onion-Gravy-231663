I used a hint of brown sugar when cooking the onions to caramelize and 2 tablespoons of flour wouldn't be too much. Nice with our prime rib and mashed potatoes.

That should ready "flour," not "flower" :)

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I used Beef Consomme instead of broth, added the beef juices, and did need a little bit more flower, but this is the best beef gravy I've ever made. Wonderful over Yorkshire Pudding and Mashed Potato.

Amazing recipe - reminded me so much of the cooking my great grandmother used to do. I did alter it a little though, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and also added more Worcestershire sauce. Couldn't resist thickening it up and adding a little whole milk but it was such a hit! Will certainly be making this for years to come.

Easy and delicious. Used a red onion and a bit more flour than 1 1/2 T. I probably put in more black pepper too. Served w/ beef tips and oven fries. Yum.

Absolutely neccessary with the standing rib roast, it went perfectly with the scored potatoes and carrots I served with it. I did need to add more salt and about 2-3 TBS of soy sauce too ( or to my taste) because it was a bit bland at first but ended up complimenting the whole meal! Cooked it all for the first time for dinner guests and it could not have been better!

I agree with the cook from IN. This recipe the way it is was a little bland. I used cracked black pepper instead of table grind (fine) black pepper. It gave it a little more kick. Also I added a touch of balsamic and the pan drippings from the meatloaf I made to go with it.

I had run out of Worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce instead. It turned out quite nice, especially with the Yorkshire pudding for which I had prepared the gravy. It was a great combination.

Perhaps, as the other reviewers suggest, this is a "basic" recipe...as long as "basic" means "tasteless." I am a cook of some experience, and I was looking for something simple, which this recipe was. However, i sincerely caution anyone from serving this recipe to guests without significant alteration. On;y once before have I given a recipe such a low rating. This was just bland.

I made this with Wolfgang Puck's Vegetable Broth and soy instead of Worcestershire. YUM, made a great vegetarian gravy for my soy sausage and kartoffel-knodels

Delicious and simple for a gravy beginner like myself,even with my substitutions of Canola Oil and chicken broth

This is a good, simple recipe to keep on hand. I have made this recipe as written and with substitutions, I prefer the variation which used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce. Either way, it's a good, basic recipe.

As is this was great with mashed potatos. Adding a bit of corn starch to thicken it up and it very good with wild rice.

A nice simple gravy... I added quite a bit of fresh ground pepper to it and it was great on the "Sunday Rib Roast"

So, what happens? You just ask a question, but don't rate the recipe, & that lowers the percentages? This is a good basic recipe for gravy, just add in the pan juices.

Marmite is a product from the UK. It is yeast extract, very concentrated savoury taste. A little spoonful will enhance a gravy or cheese sauce, and it is delicious thinly spread on buttered bread/toast. It is an acquired taste. ;) Marmite is available in supermarkets in larger cities, usually in the aisle selling "Irish Foods". Also available in Whole Foods markets.

What is this Marmite, the last reveiwer talked about? I looked in the food dictionary and it said that a Marmite is a type of cooking pot from France.

Not a bad recipe, but for the truly English version, you should add a tea-spoon of Marmite - but I'm not sure if that is available in the US
