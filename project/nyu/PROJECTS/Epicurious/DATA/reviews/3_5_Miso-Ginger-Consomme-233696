I was a little worried that this dish would be bland -- but not so! This soup was the perfect addition to a ginger themed dinner I served last night (other courses included Red Cooked Pork & Frizzled Ginger, Asian Spinach Salad with Oranges and Avocados, and Molasses Baskets with Fruit and Ginger Syrup -- all on epicurious, all fantastic, btw) The shiitake mushrooms are super flavorful. I used lite kikoman soy sauce I already had. I will be making this again!

Amazing recipe!! My boyfriend lived in Japan for three years and said the broth was incredibly authentic. I'll probably use more ginger next time, but only because its one of my favorite flavors. Also, I'll either use dried shiitake or will slice the fresh ones with a mandolin on a super thin setting...mine got a tad rubbery. I added tofu and the green tops of bok choy, which was great! Adding some shrimp at the end until they just turn pink might be a great addition, too!

super easy to make. the green onions were key in this. i would increase that as well as the ginger a tad. on the whole thought it was somewhat bland, but my dining partner loved it. its gentle.

i don't know what some of you are talking about. i thought that this was a lovely miso recipe. the ginger flavor is subtle, and the shitakes added a nice flavor and texture.

I came upon this recipe when I had a terrible cold and needed some miso soup. I had no fresh shiitakes, so I substitued dried shiitakes. I rehydrated them in boiling water, then strained the steeping water and added it along with the sliced mushrooms to the soup. I also didn't have any scallions, but did have cilanto, I substitued the cilantro. The soup was delicious.

I have been making this recipe for years, but have been making it with a dashi base instead of water. Dashi is made with dried white fish flakes and seaweed, then drained. It makes for a much richer, pungent flavored miso, ginger soup. For fun, leave some of the seaweed in the soup. Very tasty!

This is the first miso soup recipe I have made and I was very disappointed. Having had great miso soup before, maybe I was expecting too much. This was very bland. I kept adding things, more miso, more ginger, soy, sesame oil, tofu, hoping it would improve, but it barely made a difference. If you like a very light tasting miso, you will probably like this.

In place of the miso paste, you can add miso soup packets found in the Asian section of the grocery store. It thickens it a bit and adds a little extra seasoning.

This is my first time cooking with miso so pls keep that in mind. If you'd like to try a simple, tasty soup using this ingredient, ths is a good way to start. I added peas b/c I enjoy their taste. The shitakes were delicious. Nxt time I'll add spinach and diced tofu as suggested.
