So, I made my own oat milk at home like another reviewer had suggested (thanks, btw!) and used almond butter because that's all I had and prefer it over cashew any day. Other than that I made it as instructed and it came out delicious! I was sort of uneasy about it, but my husband is lactose intolerant and I LOVE alfredo and this seemed to perfect middle ground. Which is was! The second time I made this recipe I used some of my homemade spinach fettucini noodles and it was EVEN better. If you do not make your own, try purchasing some artisan spinach pasta for this dish.

Easy and great tasting. I used almond butter because that is what I had at home. I did use oat milk. Oat milk is not as easy to find but you can make it yourself. Just use 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats (NOT instant), add to a cup of boiling water and boil until the oats are cooked, about 5 minutes. Strain and use the milk. You can also put the milk with some oats in a Vitamix until well blended if you want a thicker consistency. I will definitely make it again

Surprisingly creamy and almost cheesy-tasting! I made my own cashew butter as one of the other reviewers suggested by grinding unsalted cashews in my processor and adding enough canola oil to reach the desired consistency. I also used unsweetened plain soy milk to good effect. I will make this recipe again when I have plain cashews I need to use up!

You know, I wasn't impressed with this. I had leftover cashew butter so I looked for a recipe that would use it. I did use normal milk instead of oak milk, but others seemed to have done that and been happy with the result. I just found this too nutty with no depth. It was disappointing because cashew butter is expensive. I don't think I'll make this again.

Fantastic though fairly high calorie (but not as bad as the classic alfredo sauce). Don't worry about the oat milk; use almond milk- it is lower calorie, better tasting and easier to find. Make your own cashew butter by grinding 1/2 cup dry roast cashews to a fine powder then add 1 TBL vegetable oil and stir. Can't wait to make it again.

I just bought my ingredients and unfortunately i couldnt find any cashew or almond butter :( so i got crushed almonds and will add butter. I hope all will work out as i really want to impress hubby.

I also made this with almond butter because I couldn't find cashew butter and I used unsweetened soy milk because I couldn't find oat milk. It was quite rich and very good. Even my children ate it. Not going into the permanent rotation but I would make it again some time.

I made this with almond butter because I couldn't find cashew butter and 2% milk since I'm not vegan and didn't want to pay for oat milk. Still, it was very unusual and tasty. A good inexpensive meal. For real non vegans, some cut up chicken would be quite good in it too.
