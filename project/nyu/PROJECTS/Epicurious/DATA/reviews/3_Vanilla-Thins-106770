I have been looking for a recipe for coffee thins like the ones at Balducci's in Virginia. This worked with the addition of 1/2 t. of espresso disolved in a teaspoon of water. Subtle coffee flavor. Also used the vanilla. They were a little too soggy after they cooled so I put them back in a warm oven and let them crisp up so they were very crisp. Very tasty. I'm going to try them tonight with lemon flavoring. It's a very small recipe so I suggest doubling Also, I put the batter in a zip lock bag. It's thin so I just piped it out and made 1.5 inch round cookies.

These were not what I expected. They were pretty greasy, not crisp after cooling. I also got a pronounced eggy taste. They also spread out all funky and were homely. Fahggetaboutit

Excellent little cookie!! Perfect with afternoon tea. Next time I will double the recipe, though. This batch was gobbled up too fast. Watch those ovens- Mine only took 5 mins. to bake. As soon as the edges turn brown, get em out the oven-otherwise they taste burned, even if they aren't. I would definitely make this again and again. Cheers!

Good flavor, but not very interesting. To get 30 cookies from this recipe, you really have to make the cookies TINY. They seem more like a cookie that you would serve as an accompaniment to the dessert "main event" (ice cream, creme brulee) rather than as the main event themselves.
