I thought I had a good lentil soup recipe, yet I kept searching for another one, that's when I came across this one. Wow!!! This is incredibly good! I did follow some of the advice given by other reviewers such as adding celery, carrot and 1 cup of coconut milk. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth or water. This is quick and easy to make and it is so, so flavorful, I could eat this one every day and be happy. Thanks for the recipe and the great reviews that made it perfect!

Yum! Added some turmeric and cayenne. Definitely will make again. NOTE: Beware of blending hot soup - will explode and you'll be wearing the soup. :-)

Other than adding about 1 cup chopped carrots and 1/2-2/3 cup chopped celery, and used all chicken broth, instead of water/broth, I did not alter this recipe, and I was very pleased with the result. Delicious soup, with subtle and savory hint of cumin flavor. I will certainly make this again (and again), and can recommend it highly. In southern California, thyme is very easy to grow year round so I always have a ready supply, but I am sure that dried thyme would work if fresh is not available.

As is, the recipes was bland but with a few additions became quite tasty! I used chicken broth as others suggested, plus 1 cup coconut milk to equal 5 cups total. Added carrot. Used 1 1/2 tsp cumin plus some turmeric and a pinch of cayenne.

Easy, tasty, and very satisfying. I increased the onion, added paprika & cayenne pepper. Also added half a bouillon. But when youre from New Orleans, you always want to increase the heat!

This is definately a keeper. Took the advice from others and added a chopped carrot and celery to the onion. I omitted the water and increased the broth but did not increase it fully as I like a thicker soup.

This is my absolute favorite, go-to, healthy soup! The best part is that all the ingredients are fairly simple and easy to keep on hand. I have never used the fresh herbs and it always comes out great.

Like others, I added a bit to this recipe to make it go from good to great: - Added one chopped carrot and one chopped stalk of celery with the onions (I used half red and half white since that's what I had on hand), 1 1/2 tbs. olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt. - After cooking for 10 minutes, I added 1 can of (drained) sweet corn kernels and 1 can of (drained) sweet peas as well as 1/2 of a can of beets (drained and chopped). - I used 6 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp dried thyme (didn't have fresh), 1 1/2 c. lentils, 4 cups Campbells REAL chicken broth (regular, not low-sodium) and 1 1/2 cups water. No changes to the amount of pepper - I did not feel that I needed to add any extra salt We loved it, especially with the touch of lemon juice just before serving -- it made a solid four portions

To add more healthy lusciousness, include a can of pumpkin and/or a can of coconut milk to the puree. This makes a rich tasting and very healthy soup (not that the other one is bad) and also takes the addition of curry/ginger/garam masala or similar spices very well for variety.

This recipe was delicious but I added one carrot, two celery stalks, and used chicken stock for the whole soup (not water). My stock is homemade but I think store bought would be fine. Other than the added veggies, I followed the recipe and it was great.

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy! Has a great kick to it because of the cumin. Also works well with green lentils. I bought them apprehensively because the store I went to didn't carry red, but it worked great.

Rating: 4
Simply amazing. I did follow the suggestions from others - using stock instead of water and adding celery and carrots. The herbs (parsley and thyme) really do make a difference. I did not have bay leaf so I skipped it. I did add a half cup of pot barley and pureed the soup. I have made it a few times already - to rave reviews.

Rating: 4
I'm surprised this is so good. We did as others did and added a finely chopped carrot and celery stalk. I also added about a third of a roughly chopped beet for color. The beet made it a lovely, lovely color. It tasted fantastic. We only had dried thyme, but it was okay.

Just made this for lunch and it was delicious and so easy. Based on other reviews and what I had on hand I made the following changes. Added one chopped carrot and one chopped stalk of celery. Changed it to 6 cloves of garlic, 2 t. cumin, 1 1/2 c. lentils, 4 cups chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups water. I didn't have thyme on hand so I added some of my Sarah's Sea Salt - Carribean Salt, which has paprika, tumeric, lime oil, garlic salt and onion salt. Also added about 1 cup each of frozen corn and frozen peas. Very good.

Very good, quick and easy. I added a little celery and carrot like some others. The squeeze of lemon adds the perfect amount of acidity.

A very tasty soup. I added 1 chopped carrot and 1 chopped celery stalk when sauteing the onion, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will reduce the water by 1 cup, as my husband and I thought that the soup would be nicer if a little thicker. I will definitely make it again with these modifications.

SO good. I added carrots and celery and upped the cumin. It smelled so good and I was so hungry that I couldn't be bothered to blend it! I also added some thinly sliced chicken to appease my carnivore husband. Will add to the regular rotation for sure.

I love lentils and this recipe sounded simple and good. It is nothing WOW though. The spices definitely have to be increased and it needs a lot of lemon at the end. I added a carrot and some potatoes to it. quick and simple for the empty pantry night dish.

This soup gets four forks from me because it not only tastes five stars, but the ease of preparation is exceptional. It's delicious, healthy, soo easy to make and ready within an hour. I found it a tad too salty and I am even a big salt lover. Lemon at the end just adds more depth of flavor--try this and you will not be disappointed.

We made this after we made a coconut rice with yogurt also at epicurious. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Curried-Rice-with-Yogurt-232624 These two dishes were very complimentary, and we spooned the red lentils over the curried coconut rice for a complete meal. This was easy to make. We used no water, only broth and added white wine and 9 fresh curry leaves. Mmmmm.

A wonderful lentil soup that I'll certainly keep in my recipe box! I used green lentils, since the only reds I could find were split. Nonetheless, the soup was delicious, convenient, and I enjoyed leftovers for days.

I used most of the suggestions from other reviewers and this soup was indeed fantastic. Didn't have any fresh lemon on hand, so I added a splash of lemon balm vinegar at the end and garnished it with some finely- chopped preserved lemon. Wow!

Very good recipe. I was impressed with the simplicity, minimal ingredients and the end flavor. The only alteration I did was to add a few stalks of diced celery with the onion at the beginning, and some extra garlic. Really a favorite.

This is a great base recipe. I had some homemade chicken broth and used that instead of the water/broth mixture. Also threw in some cooked white chicken meat, and topped each bowl with parsley and bacon pieces. Next time, I might add some corn or other veggies on hand, but the basic recipe is really tasty.

I followed this recipe as written with the exception of reducing the amount of liquid only because we prefer a thicker soup. Fantastic lentil soup. A squeeze of fresh lemon before serving is a perfect finishing touch. This is a keeper

great soup! super quick to make. i didnt add as much water as required as i like a thicker soup. added veg broth, frozen peas and spinach and its truly a complete healthy meal! perfect for winter! :) and the red lentil is by far the fastest cooking lentil which makes this a great dish to make for any unexpected company!

Bought some beautiful red lentils on a whim the other day (usually a green/yellow lentil gal) and found this recipe. Like others (thank God for user comments!!) I like a thicker pea soup, so I used 2 cups of lentils, 6 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup water, 1 tsp fresh thyme (I buy it packaged in the supermarket, and, so it doesn';t go to waste, fill an ice cube tray -each hole with 1 tsp of thyme off the stem with a splash of water, and freeze it, then pop it in a zip lock-makes for an easy tsp serving of fresh thyme in soups) and added the bay leaf. I think I ended up adding a little bit more cumin (to taste) and salt. Upon other suggestions I added some lemon juice at the end of cooking (maybe, a tablespoon? Two?) and I must agree, I think it adds something to the recipe. It's subtle, you may not be able to pick out that it's lemon juice, but it adds a bit of needed zing. Also, added a box of frozen peas (the sweet in the peas compliments the cumin). All in in very good!

My son made this receipt and said it was plain. NOthing special as far as a lentil soup goes.

had a bag of mixed lentils & pearl barley & rice - used 1 1/2 cups of that; 6 cups of water with a bouillon cube; added potato and carrot, dried parsley and oregano, lemon juice, and chopped spinach at the end before serving, and made some garlic & parsley croutons from high fibre whole grain bread. It came out thick on its own, so didn't blend. Yummy - and healthy - for my first attempt at a lentil soup, even though it really wasn't the same recipe at the end. :)

I love lentil soup, but multiple recipe searches and attempts never yielded a homemade version to love. Now I have found my gold standard! Like other reviewers, I added only broth and more garlic. Also, I used my whole bag of organic lentils and added carrots. I started off with just the one cup of the lentils, but found the soup thin for my tastes and went ahead and added the remaining beans--almost a cup. I like the pureed bases with the extra beans. I served it with a Greek-ish mixture of feta, red onion, plum tomato, olive oil, oregano, and balsamic vinegar with warm whole wheat pita. Perfect!

The dash of lemon picks this up a lot. We served over brown basmati rice and with feta and plain yoghurt (everyone just picked what they liked). Four kids between ages of 8 and 3: everyone asked for seconds. Everyone. Joy!

This is a wonderfully easy recipe and there's lots of ways to adapt it to your taste. I like to add carrots when cooking the onions and, before blending, I throw in a package of frozen spinach.

You definitely want more liquid than the recipe calls for. I used 5 cups of beef stock plus a little water for just the right consistency. I also added 1 pound of spicy ground sausage along with extra carrots and celery. Can't go wrong with this one.

Wow, outstanding soup! Quick, easy, healthy, and tasty. I used 7 cups of chicken broth instead of 1/2 broth & 1/2 water. I also used about 1tbs of dried thyme b/c I was out of the fresh stuff. Still turned out great! The soup was thick enough that I didn't need to puree it either.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We served it over brown rice and topped it with a little plain yogurt. I added chopped carrots and peppers. I also used more lentils than called for to make more of a stew than a soup. In addition, I used all chicken broth instead of half broth and half water.

excellent soup! I squeeze some fresh lemon on each serving and float a small triangle of lemon in each bowl. Even my kids love this soup!

Rating: 4
Holy moly, this is terrific! I rarely give 4 forks but this deserves it considering fabulous flavor and ease of preparation. I made it very thick, almost like a bean chili, by using more beans and spices, less liquid than in the recipe. It's more interesting served au naturel than pureed, though I would puree it if I were going to serve it cold. I used regular-sodium chicken broth and a much greater proportion of broth to water than is called for in the recipe. Didn't need to add the extra salt. The reviewers who found the recipe bland should try it this way. It was amazing. My version worked without the lemon, but I agree with other reviewers that the lemon took it to a whole other level.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding coriander and freshly grated cinnamon, and reducing the liquids. When I tasted it straight from the pan, I thought it was rather bland. Upon serving it the next day, it had improved quite a bit. Next time I make it, I will probably double the recipe and will not serve it the day I make it.
