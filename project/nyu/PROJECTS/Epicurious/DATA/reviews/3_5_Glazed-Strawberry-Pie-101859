The flavor was really good. Instead of making the pie crust, I bought one already made and baked it. I suggest maybe another tablespoon of cornstrarch in the glaze. It came out really watery even after setting for 4 hrs.

i liked this-it kind of tasted like a gourmet strawberry pop tart. However I was slightly disappointed that it had to be served/eaten cold. I didnt realize this when I first decided to make it. I probably wont make it again, but it was good.

STRAWBERRY JAM IN A PIE CRUST!!!! i worked for a whole day to make sommething that couold have been done in seconds!!! do not use this receipe

This is very good. I made my old standby all butter crust from Julia Child, as I didn't have pastry flour on hand. The glaze is very sweet, but not too much. It's got a good texture in that it isn't thick like the glaze you would pick up in your produce section of the market. Do yourself a favor this strawberry season, and make this show-stopping dessert. I served mine with lightly sweetened whipped cream.

I substituted a puree of thawed strawberries (one package of frozen) for the cranberry raspberry concentrate annd it was very good.

This recipe is fantastic. It may be simple, but it's perfect every time. If you are worried about the acidity of your strawberries, I have a suggestion. Eat it right away! Other reviews mention this pie does not always keep but in my house, it's never hung around long enough for problems to arise. I've used the recommended crust recipe here, my grandma's butter crust recipe, and even (the horror!) Trader Joe's storebought crust in a pinch, and they were all great. The strawberries are the star of this pie.

What a disaster!!!! After reading the great reviews, made 4 of these pies for a pot luck with a flat of great, perfectly ripe strawberries. Used store bought frozen crust, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Glaze tasted great, jelled properly, & pies looked fabulous when first made, but went to total slop w/in 8 hours. Pies were refrigerated properly. Have made many other successful strawberry pies & this was the WORST. Evidently the fruit acids from cran-raspberry concentrate acted on the ripe strawberries - the plump berries melted into a hideous slush, oozing up over the crusts and all over the refrigerator. Yuck. Recipe might work with those tasteless, half ripe grocery store berries, but I ended up tossing a flat of just picked beauties in the garbage and bringing store bought pies to the potluck (oh, the horror) Think twice before you try this recipe - it's unreliable.

Improvising is easier than complaining. I pureed strawberries with some balsamic vinegar and added it to the glaze after it cooled slightly. I also spread cream cheese on the bottom and sides of the pie crust before adding the strawberries. Added fresh mint leaves to top it. I thought this variation was somewhat unique and delicious.

I only infrequently give four forks, but this pie was amazing. So fresh and sweet/tart. As for those of you thinking about heeding the ratings of those ridiculous snobs out there who think this is too simple: I too usually cook more complicated recipes, but the number of steps and ingredients does not equte with the quality of the food. I will make this again and again, gourmet affair or not.

We love this pie - I am making it tomorrow for my mother-in-law for our mother's day dinner dessert. I use cranberry concentrate because I can't find cran-raspberry. Still yummy.

I felt compelled to write a review because, in my opinion, this was a decent recipe but certainly not great. Judging from the other reviews I'm in the minority. I won't make this again because I entertain a lot, and my guests have come to expect meals that are over-the-top-good. This one would definitely bring down my average.

This is a keeper. I made a similar pie to this that was far more complicated...boiling the mixture, crushing the strawberries, stirring them in and putting the mixture through a sieve. This is far easier and the result is the same. Great summer treat. Thanks for the ease.

YUM! This is awesome. I made it with farm-fresh strawberries and served it with plenty of fresh whipped cream. It's a perfect summer dessert. The slight tartness of the cranberry juice concentrate pairs nicely with the sweetness of fresh berries. I found that the dish started to fall apart and get liquidy after the first day or two, so eat up.

This recipe is a wonderful showcase for strawberries. Once the strawbs were folded into the glaze, they were so delicious that many did not make it to the crust. In fact, the crust is not really necessary and I'm thinking of serving the glazed berries layered with whipped cream in parfait glasses next time. I also had very big strawberries and should have sliced them instead of halving them for a more asthetic presentation. In any case, it went in minutes (and it wasn't the only dessert at the table).

If you have great strawberries, try the Open Faced Double Strawberry Pie from the pie/pastry bible. It's to die for. sclive@charter.net

A classic and extremely simple recipie! I used cran-rasp juice (not concentrated)and pomegranite juice instead and highly highly reccommend this recipie to all. VERY YUMMY!!

This pie tasted really fruity and delicious but the glaze was still runny after 6 hours in the fridge and it fell apart when cut so presentation wasn't the best. I'm guessing a little too much liquid for the amount of cornstarch. At the same time I also made the Open Faced Blueberry Pie (also Beranbaum recipe) which was much firmer. The only other strawberry pie recipe I have made involved boiling a cup of the strawberries with the sugar etc to make the glaze (which is how Beranbaum makes the blueberry pie). I plan to try my old recipe again to see which is better.

This got rave reviews from my family. I couldn't find cran-raspberry juice, so I used raspberry-grape. I coated the strawberries in the glaze and then arranged them in the crust, but since I used about a cup more strawberries than called for I didn't have any leftover glaze. I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this pie twice since our family absolutely loves strawberries and they are in season here in CA most of the year. The first time I made it I used a frozen crust and it was wonderful. I had the time this weekend to try the accompanying pie crust recipe so I followed it to a "t" even using pastry flour instead of all-purpose using the food processor method. The filling was wonderful but I was very disappointed in the crust - and believe me I usually make my own so I will substitute my mother's stand-by crust insead of this one (crisco, flour, salt, water) when I make it again.

This is a great summer treat. Everyone has asked for the recipe. To add some color to the topping, I added some exta strawberry juice to the marshmellow/egg white mixture.

I thought this pie turned out very well. I used a frozen crust and it worked fine. Anothr thing I did was to add more than 4 cups of strawberries, but not all of the glaze. I also added about a tsp. of vanilla

This was simple and did not seem sinful. I did use a butter crust from Bread and Circus to save some time. If your strawberries are fresh and sweet, this is a great way to highlight them. I only coated the strawberries, and did not pour in all of the glaze. I thought it was perfect with just a little whipped cream.

I thought this was an easy, delicious pie. As my husband commented, the gelatin was not like most...all cornstarch and sugar. Instead, the juice concentrate adds great flavor. I could not find cran/raspberry so I used cran/grape. Due to a time constraint, I cheated and used a Pillsbury refrigerator crust and it was fine. I also topped the pie with fresh whipped cream. This recipe was unfairly rated previously.

It was okay, not great, but okay. It took much longer to set than three or four hours.

This was a great hit among my friends. It is an easy recipe. It took only roughly 1 hour to make. I used a ready made crust and substituted the cran/raspberry juice with apple juice concentrate- it worked wonderfully. It is a light and relatively healthy desert, yet quite satisfying. It is especially nice with some whipped cream. I highly recommend the recipe.

I made this with a store-bought frozen crust, and it turned out decently. I am sure it will be a lot better with a homemade crust. The glaze turned out to be more of a gelatin after chilled. I would just coat the strawberries rather than dumping all the glaze into the pie. Otherwise you get strange pink clumps while eating your pie. This pie is still not as good as the strawberry pie from Marie Callendar's. Their crust is sweeter, and their glaze is really a glaze.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's simple, very good and low in fat as well.

I grew up in the midwest, and Big Boy's strawberry pie is one of my favorite comfort foods - I even waited tables for them for a few months during high school just so I could have the pie for dinner! It's great with whipped cream (from the can, of course! This is diner food!).

I have been making this recipe for years. It is outstanding. The glaze is wonderful. Sometimes I use a grahmcraker crust instead and it is still wonderful
