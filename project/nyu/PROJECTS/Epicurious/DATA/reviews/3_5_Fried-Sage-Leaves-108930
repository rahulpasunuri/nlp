My mom made this for the holidays several years ago and I loved it then. Just found it now & I can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving! It is very light -- doesn't feel heavy fried.

In Italy, they lightly drag in water wash and flour before frying. At any rate, this is simple, relaxing and should be enjoyed with a nice glass of wine.

This recipe is so Italy. With a glass of wine, it is savory and simple.
