I am sure the recipe is lovely, but it has no relationship to the photo. Where are the peas in the photos, and what is the sort of odd round brown vegetable?

Dandy little recipe. I had everything on hand but the leek, so I substituted scallions and red onion. I had exactly one-half cup of fresh little peas. Twice as much would have been even better. Love the mint.

Dandy little recipe. I had everything on hand but the leek, so I substituted scallions and red onion. I had exactly one-half cup of fresh baby peas. Double that amount would be great. Love the mint.

Great recipe idea with the leeks! Keeping with the theme of frittata (ie. anything goes), I also threw in tomatoes. I also cooked everything for about half as long and it was perfect for a healthy, delicious breakfast.

Loved this recipe. Made it for a Sunday Brunch. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.

Easy and delicious. I made it according to the recipe (using the goat cheese version)and will make it again. Since I was having breakfast for dinner, I served it with left over chilled orzo, tossed in olive oil, kosher salt, pepper, quartered grape tomatoes, and 1/2 ounce of goat cheese. I agree with Foodie Penguin that the serving size is more like 2 servings.

the picture definitely doesn't match the recipe... are those mushrooms i see? and thyme definitely, rather than mint. hopefully the epi editors read these comments.

Delicious, easy recipe. I'll make this again. This recipe doesn't yield six servings. It's more like two!
