I grew up eating linguica sandwiches, but haven't had one in a few years so I tried this recipe out. Pretty good. But it has some serious flaws. For one thing, the taste of the wine was way too much, the paprika was too little and I don't know if the olives are really needed here, but they did have a nice flavor, just not familiar for a linguica sandwich to me. Also, the biggest omission, Mayonnaise. You heard me right. A linguicia sandwich ALWAYS needs mayo for me. If you wanted to get fancy, you could whip a little sauteed garlic, paprika and butter into the mayo to give it a little punch, but straight mayo will do the job just fine. So, cut the wine in half, make it a full teaspoon (or more) of paprika, add some mayo onto the roll (you need a big roll, not a baguette) and you will be in business.

This was delicious. Made it with Linguica and followed the recipe almost exactly. Except I did the step where you sauteed the peppers with the wine, sugar and paprika one day ahead of time. Then the next day I browned the Linguica and threw it all together in a slow cooker to keep warm until guests arrived. I'd make this again for sure.

Folks... the recipe's title is Portugese Sausage, not Polish, or Italian or German. Ergo you need to use linguica or chourico, not some other type of sausage. Linguica/chourico is best grilled for sandwiches. Use crusty Portugese bread with onions and or peppers if you like. I like a little mustard on mine.

I have a few suggestions to improve this recipe: 1. A baguette isn't nearly large enough to support all the filling. I suggest french bread. 2. The vegetable-to-sausage ratio is a little high for my tastes. I suggest cutting out 1 pepper and 1 onion. 3. I suggest mincing the olives, otherwise they'll just fall out of the sandwich. Overall this is a very satisfying sandwich. You might need to adjust the paprika to taste, as I prefer a little more spice.

Wonderful! A nice upgrade of the usual sausage and pepper sandwhich. Definitely use the linguica, but I suppose chorizo or andouille would substitue if you can't find it. Just be sure to have a lot of napkins around: they're very messy!

My husband and I would try this. It sounds good

I made this recipe last night for the second time because I had kielbasa on hand. It is very flavorful and quite easy and quick to make. I think the olives would be better halved and I did use more onions and peppers than called for. I think this would also be good just tossing the veggies and meat with a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and forget the wine step.

I made this as pre-game food for college football. My supermarket didn't have Kalamata olives or linguica, but they still turned out very good with kielbasa and California olives. I made and then transported them and heated at 350 for 15 minutes, and I think this made them better. Suggestions: use 2 bell peppers instead of 3, and find a very wide baguette. Recipe made way more than can fit on a narrow baguette, but this just means an easy lunch!

Don't even think about using some other sausage besides linguica - there is nothing like it. Linguica makes the sandwich!

This tasted pretty ordinary but I used kielbasa instead of linguica. I suspect that's the problem.

Delicious! I am making it for the second time in one week! I used a more narrow baguette the first time and it was a little messy. But who cares- it was so yummy!

Excellent, simple and fast. I had a lb. of venison sausage that I used in lieu of Kielbasa. I would recommend a little more onion. I would also add a little water after the wine reduction. There wasn't quite enough juice for my liking. It's amazing how good it was without any salt or pepper. The paprika was hardly noticeable. I would either add more or omit it.

Had a New Years open house party and this dish was great. I doubled the recipe and didn't have time to cook the sausage so after cooking the onions and peppers I threw everything in the crockpot then boiled the wine in the pan and added to the crockpot on high temp.

Made this dish for a family reunion and everyone raved about it. About to try it again for a post walk-a-thon party.
