I didn't love this recipe. It was good - and different. But, it was actually a little bland.

Absolutely outstanding!! Modified slightly -- added a few shallots and a couple cloves of garlic. Only used half blue cheese with some Asiago. Used fat free half and half and milk instead of cream and half and half (calories). Added some bread crumbs and paprika for color to the parmesan. Practically sinfully delicious!

I did not love this dish. Despite following the recipe exactly, it did not set up properly. I enjoy celery, but found the flavor in this overwhelming.

This was so good! I halved the recipe and it was enough for 4 servings. And I used milk instead of cream and the whole egg instead of just the yolk. It still came out fine--very creamy. I was really skeptical at first about the flavor combination but it worked great.

AMAZING! my mother in law made this for christmas and i fell in love! she had left overs so we put some ham into it for lunch the next day; it tastes great even after re-heating. i made this again today because i've been craving it. i cooked it exactly the way the recipe said, then after taking it out, i mixed in heated ham. i didn't want the dish to take up a ham taste while cooking, that's why i added it after. it was just as good as i remember. i love it! i probably won't make it again as an entree...it's too rich, but it's excellent as a side... so creamy and rich, i can't get over it!!!

Nice, but not great. Would use my grandmother's creamed mac and cheese recipe with a few additions for a tastier, creamier casserole.

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. I have consistently used gorgonzola rather than bleu (just personal preference). It's a rich dish but has complex flavors and velvety texture.

This Mac and Cheese has the proper name. It is good and a nice change of pace to regular Mac and Cheese.

I was attracted to this more because it sounded so rich, not because of the blue cheese. Instead I used about 1/3 blue cheese and 2/3 sharp cheddar. This is absolutely craveable. I'm going to have to restrict when I make it.

I didn't think it looked good. The blue cheese separated, making the dish appear oily. Tasted good, though, and the guests enjoyed it!

First made this dish for Christmas eve, and it has been requested by family members again and again. I will be making it again soon for a dinner party. I use a little less chees and omit the celery seeds. Just wonderful!

I am asked for this recipe more than anything else I make. It is great for elegant meals or casual potlucks! I've left out peppers and celery when I haven't had them but really do love the original recipe the best.

Wow, this is so good! I didn't add the celery seeds. I made one-third of the recipe in a 9" x 9" pan. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent. Added some more blue cheese and gruyere. Served it with braised beef and onions - a good Christmas party combination. Even better the next day.

My husband thinks this is hands down the best thing I make. I don't make it often because it is so rich - just two or three times a year.. For a company dinner with Roast beef and creamed spinach, for Christmas dinner and Easter. I don't do any of the veggies - he doesn't care for peppers and I don't care for celery. I cut the fat some by using a 4 egg egg-substitute equivalent instead of the yolks. I use a pound and a half of penne and use skim milk instead of half and half. But I do use more parmesan for a nice crunchy crust, that I get by giving it a whirl under the broiler just before serving. I make three square nine inch pans with this recipe, and we are always sad to see the last bite go. This year we are trying it with gorgonzola instead of regular blue cheese. Can't wait!

Perfect for a casual winter dinner with friends - You can make it the night before and it only takes 20 minutes to bake. I've made this 4x and have received rave reviews. My husband almost begs me NOT to make it b/c he know he will want to eat the whole pan. The red peppers & celery add nice coloring and texture and the blue cheese (which I only use 1/2 the amount called for, or it's too overpowering) adds a nice zing.

Great dish. The red peppers added a nice flavor to the dish. I used milk instead of half & half, and light whipping cream--the texture was still creamy.

I made this recipe when it first appeared, and I have made it several times since. Certianly not a low fat dish, but one that all of your guests will rave about and demand the recipe!

An excellent dish that I have made again and again. It is a little on the heavy side, but it was designed to serve during the holidays --- so there are no holds barred. It makes a great tasting, good looking alternative to macaroni and cheese. Bon Appetit!

The first time I made this in 1995 when published, my father said that it was the best thing he had ever eaten. It is now a holiday standard for our family. It is so rich that once a year is enough.

I, and everyone I've made this for, love it! If you like the individual flavors that go into it, chances are you'll like it.

Save your money and your penne pasta and your blue cheese for a better recipe than this! A horrible marriage of celery and red bell peppers... a total oleo...dare I say of...BAD TASTE?

Just O.k. I used 5 ounces less of the blue cheese that it called for and it still was overpowering with blue cheese. I was disappointed given the other reviews and all my guests agreed it wasn't anything to write home about!

I am not sure what happen, but this was a liquid mess. I followed the instructions and was really looking forward to this based on all the comments. I was surprised how liquid it was, since everyone was stating it was dry. Not sure what I did wrong. I used a mixture of danish and french blue cheese (crumbly) and used 3 cups whole milk instead of the cream and half and half(could that be it?) an I actually ued 3 egg yolks. Any advice.

Loved it! I made this dish for a small dinner party and everyone enjoyed it. I cut back on the red pepper slightly (only because peppers and a dinner guest do not get along). It is a very rich dish and full of flavor. The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming and the celery is a perfect companion. I made this dish the night before and also added a bit of crumbled bacon to the top. I used a little less than 1 lb of pasta as others said it was a little dry - wonderful!

I made this dish for a group of friends (a last minute dinner party). This was rather quick to throw together and I got pretty positive reviews from most people. I added some prosciutto to the recipe as well. However, I didn't like it as much as others. I like blue cheese, however I thought the flavor was a bit strong for me.

I decided to make this new dish as a side dish on Thanksgiving. I was a bit concerned that the blue cheese would be too overwhelming and the dish too rich -- but it was perfect and received many compliments. The mild blue cheese flavor was a perfect accent to the turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy. I plan to make it for future dinners and Thanksgivings.

This is a FABULOUS recipe!! I make it for every big gathering and it always gets rave reviews.

I have made this recipe countless times for countless different occasions and everyone loves it. It's a bit time consuming, but very easy for even the most novice chef. I have cut out the egg yolks before and noticed a less-custardy texture, but me and my bleu-cheese loving friends keep coming back for more. Love it!

Delicious ... great for a crowd.

I don't know what I did wrong. But I cut the recipe in half, not enough mouths to feed, and the blue cheese was so overpowering we had to throw the remainder out.

I first made this recipe when it originally appeared in Bon Appetit, and it was so delicious that I have made it several times since. Each time I have received many compliments. You can't go wrong with such an old favorite enhanced by the wonderful ingredients of red peppers and blue cheese. It goes very well with ham.

As I remember, this was very good. My friend and I have been looking for this recipe for over 6 years. I apparently lost the magazine it was in. E-mailed it to her today and I am making it this week. SOoooooo glad to find it again. Will let you know what my new husband thinks of it.

Celery is not a favorite of mine, so I left it out, including the seeds and I still thought this recipe was fantastic. Made it for our Holiday Open House, and everyone raved. Will definitely make this one again.

NOTE TO SACRAMENTO: Adding eggs yolks help to thicken the cheese sauce. Like a custard, y'know?? Haven't made this, so can't review. However, my b/f requests that we have mac and cheese at our Thanksgiving dinner table, and rather than allow him to call his ex-wife for her recipe *rolling eyes*, I'm printing this one out for future reference.

i have a question: what do the egg yolks do for the dish? forgive my ignorance, but i'm a novice cook, and i wondered why i have to add those to this recipe, can anyone explain? as for the recipe itself, i followed it to a T, and i must say it turned really, really good. don't know why some cooks think it bland.

Rating: 3
This reminds me of the mac and cheese I have made in the past...only mine is made better by the addition of mozzarella, fresh grated parmesan, and cream cheese. I also, instead of the celery, use fresh chives. Expensive? Yes. Worth every penny? You had better believe it.

My hubby and I LOVED this recipe. Welcome change to the usual mac and cheese. I will definitely make it again!!

I love this dish. I hesitated at the bluecheese, but found it sublime and intricate tasting. I wouldn't omit any ingredient. The layers of flavors are aromatic and revealing. Wonderful! But initially expensive, but worth it.

This is a very expensive dish to make, and you must REALLY, REALLY like Blue Cheese to enjoy this version of Mac & Cheese. I used Stilton and Reggiano cheeses, and along with the red peppers, whipping cream etc., spent over $40 to make the dish. Quadrupling that to take to a pot luck dinner??...well, I'd rather spend the $160 on lots of good prime rib.

I liked this version of mac n cheese, but my husband (who will eat ANYTHING) asked me what happened to the pasta. Some old traditions die hard... especially when the gooey traditional version is so comforting. I will look for my upscale cooking in less traditional favorites.

If the blue cheese is scaring you--forget about it. The blue cheese flavor is so mild even my littlest ones loved it. I'm not sure it's necessary to bother with the celery. The celery seed lends enough flavor you could probably skip the extra chopping if you are in a hurry. This would be great to take to a pot luck.

After peruing the reviews, I decided to make and include this dish on the menu for my fiance's surprise 40th birthday party this February. There were over 100 guests and it was a BIG hit. I've been passing out the recipe regularly ever since the party.

Excellent! I agree it was just a tad dry so I will make just alittle more sauce. Many variations are possible. My brother who does not care for mac & cheese loved this dish and said it seemed more like an upscale italian pasta dish.

I have made this dish on several occasions. Even those who do not like blue cheese love it! I found it to be a little dry the first time I made it. Now, I just make a little extra sauce, and I also leave out the peppers and sprinkle a little crumbled bacon on top. It is a hit every time!

Although I'm not a great fan of blue cheese, this was a wonderful dish. I did cut the blue cheese in half and used half sharp cheddar and it worked real well. Would definately make this one again...
