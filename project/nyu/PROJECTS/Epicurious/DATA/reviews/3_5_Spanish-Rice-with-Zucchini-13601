So delicious! I washed the rice before adding it and this made a big difference in decreasing the stickiness after it was fully cooked. I will make this again many times in the future.

Delicious, easy. I made it in an enamel Dutch oven. Came out perfectly. It isn't very "Spanish" to me, but it's tastier than plain rice.

I served this with fish tacos and it was the biggest hit of a really great meal! Spice it more if you like it, but the best thing about this is that it's warm, colorful, and tastes fresh - really fresh.

This is my go-to side dish for Mexican-style meals when zucchini is in season. Like many others, I also add a can of diced tomatoes with chilis, as well as some chopped fresh cilantro. The zucchini added at the end comes out perfectly crisp-tender. Prepared with the mentioned additions, this dish has plenty of flavor, without the potential of overwhelming the main dish that it is served with.

This seemed awfully bland to me. If I were to make it again I would add some more seasoning.

I added half a can of Ro-tel tomatoes, which is a staple in most Texas kitchens, to the rice. It added the spice that we like without going over the top. The leftover went with my husband to work and it was a big hit with the teenagers, too.The rice went well with the stuffed hatch peppers(a chile rellenos of sorts) that I served as the main course.

As written, this dish is a bit bland to my taste. I added extra garlic, paprika, and 1/2 of a serrano green chili while cooking the onion. Paired with black bean/veggie enchiladas, this was a perfect side dish!

My adjustments were; used jasmine rice as that's all I had, reduced the broth by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup tomato sauce, a pinch of cayenne pepper, cumin, hot paprika as suggested and added a fresh chopped tomato with the zucchini. I've been looking for a easy spanish style rice recipe and this is it. Cooked it on the stove top and it turned out wonderful. I served this with the Boneless chicken breasts with red chili sauce from this site, tortillas, and melon. Yum!

Like everyone else I found this to be a great recipe that you can tweak a number of ways to flavour it up. It's an excellent dish for casual dining when timing is difficult to figure out. A little prep done ahead of time and there is very little to do to have a great dish ready in minutes. The zucchini makes it more interesting than just rice. I added yellow and red diced bell peppers, a bit of jalapeno and fish sauce. This dish lends itself to experimentation. Enjoy!

Very easy. A little too bland to eat by itself, but great as a base for a zestier dish, like the fiesta red snapper on this site.

This recipe is wonderful! I was specifically looking for a way to cook zucchini without making it soggy and tasteless, and this was perfect. By adding the zucchini at the end, it cooked through and was still crunchy and delicious! Another great thing about this recipe is its versatility, as you can see by the many suggestions. If you like things spicy, add cayenne like I did.

First time making Spanish rice! I added a can of spicy chopped tomatoes as advised by a previous reviewer - came out GREAT!!

Easy to make and very tasty. Make sure you add the zuchinni raw at the end (it cooks in the hot rice).

I can't imagine giving this recipe the time of day as printed - the basic idea is good, the addition of zucchini at the end is brilliant. These additions made a delicious weekday dinner: 12 oz fresh chopped tomatoes, 3 T tomato paste, 1 C shredded leftover pork, 1C corn, 1/2 C chopped cilantro, a chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, plus the seasonings recommended by previous reviewers. Topped with parmesan, served with corn bread. Really tasty!

This is an excellent rice recipe and the fact that you can throw it in the oven and forget it until the timer goes off is a plus. I added a can of Rotel tomtoes to give it a little more spice. Drain the tomatoes and reserve the liquid to be used as part of the 2 cups needed then throw the drained tomatos in with the rice. Very tender and fluffy and an excellent companion to Southwest or Mexican food. I served it with the crispy chicken with green sauce from this site.

Great Spanish rice. However, a portion of my 2 cups liquid included 1/4 cup tomato sauce. When browning onion and garlic I added a handful of chopped green pepper and a pinch of each of the spices cumin, cayenne and paprika. Included a fresh choppped tomato with zucchini. Leftover corn, peas or baby lima beans could also be added last. Optional, sliced black olives or fresh cilantro for garnish.

I made this recipe with modifications and it was very good indeed. I used half chicken broth and half tomato sauce. I also added red and green pepper along with several spices. However I did not bake it in the preperation. Served with salsa on the side. I will make this again

This was great, I served it with the turkey enchiladas and red chili sauce (also this site) as an excellent after Thanksgiving dish. I cooked it on the stove the entire time and added a bit of cumin, cayenne, and paprika, as reccommended. It was really good.

A great, subtle, easy side dish! I took the advice of previous cooks and added a little cumin and chili powder (and ommitted the zucchini because I had none on hand). Also, I skipped the oven part. Cooked fine on the range.

I agree with the other reviewers. This is a good base for many different rice dishes to pair with different meats. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will add some tomato paste *OR* sliced roasted poblano chiles!!! yummmmm

The base dish as presented without modification is a wonderfull Base for dishes like Camerones Al Mojo De Ajo (Garlic Shrimp)or other lighter dishes. When Tomato paste, cumin, paprika, chili etc is added, it works well as a side for traditional mexican fare such as enchaladas, taco's or Bistek etc......however adding the spices does not go well with subtle sauces or fish.....I love this rice and the recipe worked as advertised

This is a good basic recipe to follow and spice to your own tastes. I add chopped chili or jalapeno peppers. The liquid from these peppers can be part of the total liquid needed. Also, I use 8oz of tomato sauce as part of the liquid. I then cook on low, covered, on the stovetop until liquid absorbed (20-30 Min, approx)then top with American cheese, cover again until cheese just melted. Great side dish.

This is a terrific side dish. The flavors are great but don't over power the main dish. It also molds very nicely when plating.

This is a very Good Recipe on a Basic Standard. It needs a little more effort on the Cooks part to make it Outstanding. I added a Tablespoon of tomato paste and carmelized that, and added a little cumin, chili powder & paprika to the paste before adding broth, this helped immensly. Also a touch of oregano helps add flavoe & depth to the dish. Will use this as a Basis again though.

We all enjoyed this dish. I would spice it up a little more next time. Easy to make and the zucchini was not over done.

This recipe is a wonderful side dish. I took the advice of the previous cook and added paprika and chili powder which made all the difference. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe did not have a burst of flavor but was still good. I took the suggestion of another critic and put some paprika for color and flavor. I also added some chili powder and some diced canned chili peppers for some more kick.

My first time making this dish. I added grilled chicken with hot sauce to spice it up a tad. I'm glad I did because the spanish rice was slightly bland. I would suggest adding spices, possibly paprika and maybe more onion or garlic. The zucchini added a very crisp texture to the dish.

This is simple, satisfying and versatile. I like the grated Parmesan idea--we'll try it the next time I make this dish.

This recipe was both tasty, healthy and easy to prepare. I prepared it as stated in the recipe, only increased the amount of zucchini and I thought it was fabulous. I also used basmati rice which is really fragrant. I think I will make it with chicken next time. It's a great side dish.

What a great little side dish! The squash stayed surprizingly al dente. I added some chopped fresh basil and grated parmesan before serving. Very tasty!

I really love this recipe! It's a great recipe to make on short notice or when you don't know what else to do. Goes great with spicy main courses. And it is totally delicious! Sometimes I add tomatoes along with the zucchini.

I actually got my kids to eat zucchini!!! It was an easy recipe to prepare. I did add some red and yellow peppers for colour and flavour.

Really easy recipe to prepare. The method for cooking the zucchini keeps them crisp and fresh tasting. I have to admit though, I did add some parmesan cheese to give it zip.
