We thought the flavors were very good! Served it with Ponzu marinated chicken strips and will make again. Did not add anything else--the one thing we did different was microwave the vegetables for the minutes indicated in a small amount of water instead of boiling!

YUCK.

I was disappointed with the results. Maybe more spices would add some interest.
