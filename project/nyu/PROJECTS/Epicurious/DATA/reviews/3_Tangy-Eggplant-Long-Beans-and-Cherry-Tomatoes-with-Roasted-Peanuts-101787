This was so-so. It looked and felt mushy which may be because I used regular sized tomatoes. To the final dish I added (cooled) sauted garlic and ginger and sesame oil and chile, which improved the flavour but the dish couldn't rise above its mushy mouth-feel and bland appearance.

I've made this recipe many times according to the directions. Though I generally loathe when people write a review of a recipe that has nothing to do with the original recipe itself, I will of course make an exception for myself! (smile) At the farmers market recently I found small, round, green Thai eggplants and decided to saute the eggplant and green beans (plus bell pepper) together over high heat and then finished by adding the dressing to steam everything for the final two minutes. I added the tomatoes and garnish before serving and it all turned out delicious. My adaptation tasted just like the original dish but was less like a salad.

I used some extra veggies in this and so made double the amount of dressing -- even so, I found the dressing to be too light. I ended up adding a good amount of pepper, salt, hot pepper flakes, and garlic to dress it up enough for my taste (and I did include the sesame oil recommendation as well). All in all a nice idea, though.

An excellent summer staple salad when you tire of tomato/mozarella and cucumber salad. I've eaten it hot and tried vegetable variations such as adding mushrooms with much success.

This was awful! I'm a fan of Thai food and this didn't taste like anything I have ever had at a Thai restaurant. I do not recommend this recipe.

This dish is so pretty, especially if you add water chestnuts. The flavors are lovely, the textures wonderful. I served this as a side dish to "Miso glazed chicken breast with vegetable sushi rice" (this site), and it was the perfect accompaniment.

Easy and very tasty! I used soy sauce instead of fish sauce.

I thought this was very tasty. I used soy sauce instead of fish sauce, omitted the eggplant and added water chestnuts. Very quick and very good.

We enjoyed the dish, but I agree that one-half teaspoon or so of sesame oil is essential. I added a couple of Italian frying peppers, sauteed. The dish was also enhanced by use of a table condiment from Barbara Tropp's China Moon Cookbook, specifically the 5-flavor oil, infused with scallions, ginger, chile, and a bit of sesame oil.

Great dish. Don't be afraid of the fish sauce! It smells weird straight, but just wait. I added shredded red cabbage and some chopped scallion, and threw in some water chestnuts at the end.

Really nice combination of flavors which works well as a side dish with just about anything. Light soy sauce, though different, makes a decent substitution for the fish sauce if fish sauce isn't your thing ;-). I've also made this dish with other veggies, most often substituting shelled edemame or roasted sweet potato for the eggplant.

I just made this recipe for the umpteenth time. We love it! I look forward to summer just to harvest my veggies and chow down dishes like this.

Like any good Thai-inspired recipe, this is a great blend of sweet and tangy. Especially considering how quick and easy it is, I will certainly be making it again. I would strongly suggest that everyone heed the suggestions to add 1/2 tsp of sesame oil as it really rounds out the dish. I am at a loss why those who panned this dish did so, especially those who didn't like the taste of fish sauce, as it is one of the principal flavours of Thai cuisine.

I really expected to like this recipe but it was a loser. Take a good long sniff of your fish sauce. If you're not in love with the smell, you probably won't like this sauce.

I can't imagine why anyone likes this dish -- different strokes for different folks, I guess. I thought it dull, and except for the slightly "stinky" fish sauce, flavorless. There's no way I would recommend it.

This was great. The sauce kind of sinks to the bottom, so I had to keep stirring the salad. I think next time I'd make it with a little extra sauce. But it was delicious!

My guests and I really liked this recipe. Left out the eggplant since I was making an eggplant with peanut sauce as another side dish. Added some water chestnuts for crunch.

One of my favorite recipes! I have also substituted zuchinni for the eggplant and microwaved the green beans and still got lots of complements. Very yummy :>

This was very tasty. Good flavors for a spring or summer day. Even good the next day.

I made this with the honey-gingered pork tenderloins. Everyone loved it. I also increased the amount of sauce and used sesame oil, in addition I added 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper to the sauce

Delicious! Replaced the long beans for sugar peas, and served it with 'grilled, korean-style steaks with spicy cilantro sauce' from this site.

I served this with green chicken curry and rice as part of a casual thai-inspired meal. It was fantastic...definitely more than the sum of its parts. I recommend brushing the eggplant with the dressing before grilling or broiling.

I served this with 'Roast Salmon with Red Curry and Baby Bok Choy' from this site, (without the bok choy) and it was an OUTSTANDING meal. Lots of jasmine rice and lemongrass tea made our cold,cold winter night here in Ottawa, nice and warm!

I also added 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil. This is an excellent, easy dish. We served it at a summertime party on Cape Cod and it was very popular. I will make it again and again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. After reading the other reviews, I increased the sauce and added some sesame oil. I decided to serve this warm so at the very end I tossed it in a hot skillet for just a sec. Maybe add a little minced hot pepper next time?

This was a beautiful, fresh tasting recipe. I do agree with a few others that it just didn't quite have the "zip" it needed, but that was easy to correct. I just added about 1/2 teaspoon or so of sesame oil and that did the trick. Delicious!!

I find this recipe really works if I make one and a half times the dressing. I also use palm sugar instead of white sugar, which enhances the underlying flavor. The colors of this salad are stunning.

I agree with another reviewer that this is not an outstandingly flavorful recipe. However, it is tasty and the colors make a nice presentation when you need an accompaniment that does not take away from your main dish. I added a dash of sesame oil to liven it up a bit.

This is a great side dish. I substituted soy sauce for the fish sauce, and it turned out fine.

I loved the recipe. I grilled small Chinese eggplant, as well as sweet onions to add to it. I plan on maiking it often.
