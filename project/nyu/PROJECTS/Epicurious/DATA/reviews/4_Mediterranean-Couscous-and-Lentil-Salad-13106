This was delicious! Easy, healthy and even better the next day. My husband loved it and normally doesn't like these types of dishes. Used an extra garlic clove and I found a brown rice couscous that made this gluten free!

This salad is SO SO good. I make it whenever I want to impress someone and do it quickly and easily. It always completely disappears at potlucks. One substitution that is amazing is quinoa (made according to the package directions) in place of the couscous. Same texture, but quinoa is an amazing 18 percent protein and one of the few complete proteins in the plant family (like soybeans, it contains an adequate proportion of all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for the dietary needs of humans.)

This is a great recipe. I use pearl couscous, instead of cooking in water I use the method in this recipe to cook the cousous: http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipes/2024 Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add couscous and cook, stirring frequently, until toasted, about 5 minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until water is absorbed and couscous is just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Ratio couscous to water: 1 1/3 cups couscous to 1 3/4 cups water. I may use a bit more garlic paste, and I always use french lentils as they hold their shape very well. Gorgeous looking and wonderful tasting salad.

I loved this salad. After looking over several lentil salad recipes this one sounded the best -I used plain old brown lentils. The idea of the garlic paste appealed to me - much better than minced raw garlic.

I make this salad several times a month - sometimes without the feta for my 17 year old son. He loves this so much that he took it to school for a class party (made it himself!). I use Trader Joes steamed lentils, which are fantastic. I also use more garlic (at least 3 cloves).

I've made this twice now. Once as directed and once with grilled vegetables instead of the Feta. Both were wonderful. I wonder what it would be like if I substituted quinoa for the couscous!!

I've made this salad three times now for different occasions. Everyone loved it. Ive prepared as directed as well as without the feta (for my 17 year old). He's asked me to make it again this week. Quick, very flavorful, and healthy. It doesn't get much better than this.

Very good side dish to chicken tagine. Did not adjust for using pearl couscous instead of ethnic boxed couscous. Making it again, but will follow the directions on the pearl couscous container. Guest went home with the recipe. Although the dish is not "exceptional", I gave it 4 forks, because I only make recipes with 4 forks and this one is worth a try.

Great summer salad...added lime and lemon plus a bit of orange zest. Instead of adding arugula, I placed salad over the greens (spinach and arugula) and then added toasted walnuts...a complete meal.

Made the recipe exactly as listed the first time (I always giggle when people rate a recipe without actually following it.) Was astounded at how lovely the flavours were. Since then, this has been my go-to potluck recipe, summer salad, light lunch, and all around yummy big batch recipe. I have tried substitutions and variations since - most notably baby spinach for the argula, but I come back to the original with pleasure.

Rating: 4
It's a bit of work but worth it. My kids love the couscous and lentil mixture before I add the vegetables. Use French feta and fresh arugula. It's not the same salad with supermarket feta and prewashed and bagged baby arugula Don't overcook the lentils, you want the firm bite for the texture. Perfection!

I made this last night and we loved it. I made it without the couscous and doubled the lentils. Instead of couscous I served it with roasted potatoes. As per some other reviewers, I doubled parts of the dressing - the garlic and vinegar, but not the oil. I also added some more mint and tomatoes.

Enjoyed this salad. Very healthy, but interestingly good. Substituted goat cheese for feta and quinoa for couscous. Doubled the dressing as suggested. Put the entire salad together with tomatoes, cheese, arugula and refrigerated overnight. It's now two days old and still very tasty. Great for making ahead.

This was delicious! I used goats cheese and balsamic vinegar (didn't have white wine vinegar/feta on hand) and precooked tinned lentils. Also added chilli flakes. it was very easy and tasty. Would be nice with lamb koftas I think, if you wanted to add meat. highly recommended.

Excellent salad! Made it last night for dinner. Flavors blended very well - the arugula is one thing NOT to substitute, though I did substitute quinoa for the couscous as suggested by others. I didn't get others' comments about not using the feta - I think it balances the dish. Will definitely make this again.

We found this recipe after being inspired by Jonathan Safran Foer to eat more vegetarian fare. We followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. We thought the mint was going to be too much but it wasn't, the arugula balanced it quite nicely. I know I will make this again and again.

Rating: 4
I usually use spinach and basil for this recipe, because my husband has a real aversion to mint. It's great with the variation, really clean flavours. However, last time I made it with mint and arugula exactly as written - even my husband loved it. The pungency of the arugula and the earthiness of the mint really bring the salad together. Great dish every time.

Oh man, how is this so delicious? Even my boyfriend had four helpings, and he hates lentils more than anyone I've ever met! I definitely recommend the French green lentils - they hold their shape so nicely and don't tend to go all mushy on you. Will me making this for lunch this week and maybe next week too.

Rating: 4
This is my go to lunch now -- it's absolutely delicious, but after making this a few times, I recommend the following adjustments: 1. I agree with other reviewers: definitely double the dressing. 2. I use quinoa instead of couscous. Much healthier, and the texture works better in this. 2. Omit the cheese; replace the mint with cilantro (I'm not a huge fan of mint and I don't eat much dairy, but cilantro is lovely here). 3. Omit the arugula and tomatoes. Instead, I throw in chopped green onions, chopped cucumber and chopped red pepper. I think it's nicer than with the greens, and the big batch keeps in the fridge better (one batch will last me most of a week). Delish, delish delish.

Made this for the first time and was very pleased. It's a wonderful dish for a summer evening. I used brown lentils and they took much less than 15- 20 minutes to cook, I checked them after 12 minutes and they were already too mushy. The texture and appearance of the salad is better if the lentils are not mashed.

I have made this salad many times over the years - it has so many wonderful flavors and textures and is so healthy. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion of using Trader Joe's "Harvest Grains Mix" in place of the lentils and couscous and really liked that variation.

Cannot go wrong with this recipe. Used ISRAELI COUSCOUS which made for a much more beautiful presentation with the lentils.

I've made this salad several times, usually as a side dish to chicken kebobs and Greek yogurt sauce. One substitute I like to make is replacing the lentils and couscous with the "Harvest Grains Mix" sold by Trader Joe's. This nutty mix contains the larger Israeli couscous, quinoa, red and green orzo, and split-dried garbanzo beans - a great combination!

I thought this was great. I made it exactly as written. The only change I will make next time is to leave out the feta all together. I love feta but it didn't enhance this dish in my opinion and would be better left out. I am not a vegetarian and actually served this with grilled steak (gasp, I know). Loved the arugula and mint. Nice and healthy.

Rating: 4
Great dish! Alot of flavor and really nice combination of ingredients. I fluff the cous cous after it sits with my hands rubbed with olive oil. It seperates it nicely and keeps it seperated. I used about 4 med. cloves of garlic and it could have taken more but was fine with that amount. The arugula MAKES it and is a great vegan dish if you eliminate the feta and add more tomatoes and cucumbers. I might try olives next time as well. I also added slivered scallions and cilantro as I didn't have mint. I couldn't really taste the cilantro (surprisingly). Makes enough for 8-10 generous servings and them some...but the leftovers will rock tomorrow! Cant' wait! YUM!

I really love this salad. I made it exactly as directed except I added seeded cucumber and deleted the cheese. Impressed with how well it keeps over several days. I'm taking it to work for lunch and the only thing I've done to accomodate the salad is to slice and add the cherry tomatoes each morning when I package it. I highly recommend this salad. I'm very glad I found this recipe and all the great reviews.

This salad was delicious! People have made some suggestions about adding more dressing or veggies, but I thought the original recipe worked just fine...I could be wrong, but it seems that the dressing was meant to just give flavor to the bland lentils and couscous, and I don't care for food swimming in dressing. Obviously an easy salad to adapt to your liking though. Great for a summer side with anything grilled.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this recipe but would make a few changes next time. As others said, I doubled the dressing which worked out perfectly. I would add cucumbers or more tomatoes as well as using only 3/4 cup couscous or substituting quinoa. Otherwise it was a delicious blend of flavors, healthy and easy to make.

Rating: 4
This was a perfect dish for my early spring dinner party last night. Per other reviewers' recommendations, I doubled the dressing, the feta, and the tomatoes (combination of yellow and red). I served it with roast chicken and grilled green onions and asparagus (yes, more veggies!) on the side. Definitely a hit and one I would make again. Note: If you don't double the dressing, you may end up with a very dry salad after you add the arugula. Also, four of us barely made a dent in the salad, despite having seconds. I think the salad could easily serve eight.

Rating: 3
This salad is beautiful and delicious. I used the food processor to chop the arugula (I used half a bag of prepped arugula salad.) Couldn't find mint, so I used about six stems of basil leaves; also chopped that in the food processor. It resembles taboule; I will try it with mint next time. Loved the suggestion of using precooked lentils from Trader Joes. I also needed to double the dressing.

I made this dish on Easter for 24 family members. I added cucumber and increased the tomatoes a bit for more color.

I absolutely recommend this recipe.

This recipe is every bit as good as the reviews below say. I made it as a side dish for a roasted chicken. I was a little concerned that it was a little "summer-y" for the middle of winter, so I substituted basil for the mint. It worked out fine, but even the teenagers at the table thought that it would be best as a summer dish. Only 4 1/2 months to go!

WOW! I spent two years in Israel and gained 15 pounds from the food. This dish brought me back to the delicious land. The fresh mint, and arugula really made it super fresh tasting. This dish says it serves 6 but i brought it to a party and it was enough for 20 with leftovers... Everyone loved it.

I've been making this since the recipe appeared in 1995. It is a great recipe, and it is so refreshing! I usually make this exactly as written, except I substitute spinach for the arugula. However, like others have suggested, you can substitute basil for mint (I prefer the mint and spinach combination). You can also substitute fresh mozzarella for the feta cheese--I used to do that because I didn't like feta, but now I love it so I only use feta cheese in the recipe. But the mozzarella adds a nice, very subtle flavor to the salad for those who would not eat feta cheese. This is definitely one of my favorite recipes, and anytime I make it people finish it quickly and always ask for the recipe!

This recipe is so delicious and easy to make!! If possible, use the French green lentils as brown lentils tend to fall apart. Green lentils keep their firmness and work better in this dish. I cooked the couscous in vegetable broth to give it more flavor and sometimes add diced and seeded persian cucumbers. This salad is great to take to parties or bring to work for lunch because it keeps for a couple days and the arugula doesn't get soggy.

This dish makes a great vegetarian main course. I have made this several times with variations on the herbs and basic ingredients. We like it best using whole-wheat couscous (high in fiber), using the original mint, with green lentils rather than brown, and substituting sun-dried tomatoes (the type you reconstitue in hot water, not the oil-packed) for the cherry tomatoes. If you are having trouble finding green lentils, try the bulk section of a whole foods store.

This is great! The recipe makes enough to feed a small army, so I've been making it ahead and taking it to work to eat for lunch for a week. I've subbed basil and roma tomatoes for the mint and cherries, and the result is equally delish. Overall, a very easy, affordable, and nutricious dish!

I didn't know what to expect with this dish; but upon reading all the wonderful reviews, I decided to try it. The green from the spinach, red from the tomatoes, and pale yellow color from the couscous gave this dish a very colorful and appetizing presentation. I took another cook's advice and allowed the couscous to soak up the juices from the mixture, instead of cooking it ahead of time. I also substituted spinach for the arugula as it was easier to get. The mint in the salad made everything cool and refreshing. This is a great side dish to have on a hot day. Yummy!

Rating: 3
Good, although I was expecting better after all the rave reviews. I used a flavored oil to jazz it up, and used only about half the dressing as I prefer it lighter. Next time I'd use Israeli couscous for sure, would sub spinach for the arugula (I like arugula but found it a little bitter here) and would add more mint and more cherry tomatoes. Had lots left over and it lasted a good few days in the fridge. This would be great if you needed something to make ahead to bring, especially if you are looking for something that is both a little unique yet most people would enjoy.

Delicious, Unique, Inexpensive and Healthy - can't be but is! I replaced the couscous w/ Quinoa to add even more protein and fiber (amazing taste and texture). Just sauté 1/4 cup of chopped red onion, add a cup of Quinoa, quickly sauté, add two cups of water and the Quinoa is ready when all water is absorbed; about 10-15min. The Feta can also be replaced with Goat Cheese.

This salad is delicious! Another plus is that it is relatively inexpensive to make. I used a garlic couscous for extra garlic flavor. I also added half a yellow onion, chopped for extra crunchiness. The arugula and mint are a perfect flavor addition. MMMMMMMMM! I may make it at the beginning of every week and bring it to work with me.

Excellent served warm. I took the advice of one reviewer and substituted Isralie couscous..made for a different texture and color to the salad. By all the means the arugula makes it and plenty of fresh mint. Keep an eye on the lentils if using the French green variety; they cook in less time.

I have been making this dish for many years and logged on to print out a new copy and decided to write this review. I love this dish and it's a favorite whenever I serve it.

I love this recipe but I usually cut it in half b/c it makes enough to feed a small army. I often combine all the ingredients after the lentils and the couscous cool instead of waiting until right before serving it. This saves time and doesn't affect the final result. I also add a little more vinegar than it calls for.

I love this recipe and have been making it for about 2 years now. However, I have made some changes to accomodate personal tastes.

This dish is always a hit at church functions. Instead of cooking the couscous what I do is rinse the grain, then squeeze out the water and mix in the dressing and lentils. After I mix it up I put it in the refrig overnight. What happens is the grains soak up the dressing and it doesn't come out mushy. You will have to use a little more dressing that the recipe calls for.

This is always a crowd pleaser. I've eaten it for dinner several times. Echoing other reviews, be careful not to overcook the lentils - the salad will be mush. Grape tomates work well if you prefer them. I forgot the feta once and it turned out fine, but it is better with it. Enjoy!

I thought this dish was great - I made it for a bridal shower a few weeks ago and got tons of raves. The bride insisted on the recipe, and I'm making it again today just to have around. (I'm giving it 3 forks instead of 4 just because I don't know if it's the kind of dish that counts as "beyond compare" - but it's really terrific.) By the way, when I made it, I tripled everything, but accidentally didn't increase the couscous by much, and it turned out to be a very nice balance - I wouldn't have wanted much more couscous than that. One other thing - I couldn't find something that said it was Lentilles de puy, and the lentils I've used before always seem to fall apart, but I got a box of lentils by the manufacturer Roland at Whole Foods (it says Green Lentils, Product of France on the front), and they were perfect. Much tinier than the other green lentils I've found.

Everybody loves this dish. It is a nice compromise between a grain and a salad. Be careful not to overcook the lentils, otherwise everything will be mushy. I also increased the vinaigrette.

Great recipe! Followed other cooks' advice & substituted basil for mint. Also, increased the amount of oil & vinegar. The combination of ingredients here reminds me of another fave salad--white rice w/ black beans, scallions, tomatoes, cilantro, celery, feta, o & v. This (lentil & cous cous) salad was a great find!

I made this salad for a holiday party and people really liked alot. I couldn't get my hands on any mint, so I just left it out. Aside from having to increase the seasonings a little bit, it worked wonderfully. I was told that I "had to" make it again.

My husband and I loved this salad! We don't care for arugula so I used spinach, also I used grape tomatoes because I like them better than cherry. I will make this again!

This is a stupendous recipe. Wonderful flavor, tastes healthy too. I will not only make it again, but actively promote it among my friends! I made first half with argula and second half with spinach because I ran out of arugula. I prefer arugula but spinach will do just fine.

I really liked this recipe. It tasted great before I put the mint in (it over-powered the arugula). Next time I would try 1/4 cup mint instead or use suggestions & substitute oregano or basil.

I made this recipe for a potluck summer dinner party and everyoen thought it was delicous! There wasn't a scrap left. I added more feta than the recipe called for because I love it.

I love the texture of the light, fluffy couscous and the al dente green lentils. This is one of my favorite recipes inthe Gourmet index.

I thought it was delicious, but I found the feta a bit strong for the other ingredients. I tried it again using goat cheese instead of feta and I LOVED it!

This salad was a great hit. Here's yet another variation. When I went to make it, I realised that my jar of 'couscous' was actually bulghur wheat. Just use a little more water to cook the bulgar in.

I made this recipe using all kinds of substitutions and it turned out great. I substituted roasted garlic for the regular garlic, roasted garlic olive oil, fresh oregano for the mint, and fresh Italian parsley for the arugula. Kalamata or nicoise olives would make a nice addition. I took it to a BBQ and everyone went back for seconds.

This recipe is a refreshing accompaniment to broiled chicken or pork. I adapted it to the lactose intollerent crowd by adding color and roasted garlic instead of cheese. Just substitute bright orange lentils (5 min. cook time)for the green or brown, finely chopped parsley instead of arugula, and roasted garlic (instead of raw--it gives it a sweet and mellow garlic flavor).

This is just the kind of healthy, delicious recipe I love. If you are a lentil and couscous lover, you'll really like the way these are presented here.

This is my favorite salad recipe - I bring it to all potlucks and even used it when catering a friend's wedding. It scales up well - I've prepared up to 6 batches at once. Prepare some extra to keep at home, and bring copies of the recipe with you. It' perfect as is, but you can play with herbs a bit (basil for the mint) depending on what you have on hand.
