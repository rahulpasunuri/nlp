NOM NOM NOM so good, really different from traditional Italian meatballs. I've used cornstarch in place of the potato starch with no trouble. The sweetness of the carrots, with the grainy matzo, tart olives, and distinctive fennel is so good.

An intriguing recipe but poorly written as it never tells you what to do with the chopped olives, garlic, egg mixture. I opted to add it to the meat mix and it came out wonderfully. The potato starch is overkill and as I served this dish with whole wheat pasta and a simple tomato sauce there was enough sauce to go around.

Made the recipe this evening and it was GREAT! I followed it to the letter and was very happy - the lemon juice from the wedges gave it a nice pop.

I didn't soak the matzo meal, just added it dry to the other meatball ingredients, as my mother taught me. Then I microwaved the meatballs for about 5 minutes rather than broiling them. They came out firm & light & didn't break up. But my family & I agreed the braising liquid was rather bland & needed something to give it some oomph. Don't know what, & I doubt I'll make this again to try to find out.

A keeper. We're not Jewish so I used bread crumbs instead of matzo and used 2 eggs instead of one. These meatballs were perfect as such so I am not sure why all the problems in other reviews. The fennel and carrots made the sauce delicious and everyone loved it, even the kids. I served it over Israeli couscous for a wonderful dinner.

Thanks for the tips. I'll make a note for next year. As for why there is no milk, it wouldn't be kosher then. Hardly appropriate to have a Passover recipe that went against the basic dietary tenets that prohibit mixing meat with dairy.

To keep the meatballs in tact, try reducing the liquid, using only enough to moisten the matzo and use two eggs instead of one. I'm not sure why milk is left out; veal is light enough. Finally, eliminate the broiling and simply poach the meatballs in the broth. They should hold.

Like Ms Lunatic, I thought the dish tasted great and has potential, if only someone could figure out how to keep the meatballs from falling apart. As I tenderly lifted them from the baking sheet and placed them into the skillet for the final braising-with-vegetables step, I knew they would never hold up. And they didn't last very long at all, especially you add the olives and parsley toward the end and then thicken the whole thing. This requires stirring and your meatballs will turn into browned ground veal with carrots and fennel. Not bad though and will definitely make again another Passover. BTW, I followed the directions exactly, made no changes, though there was a ton of prep work, maybe too much to justify this dish's structural issues.

I followed the recipe exactly but the mixture was very loose. When I broiled the meatballs they crumbled. Somehow the matzo meal didn't seem to have the same effect that bread crumbs do. Anyway, we made it and called it veal stew and everyone loved the flavor.

Excellent meatballs ! What a great change from the same ol' meatballs with Tomato Sauce and Mushroom Sauce. They are light as a feather & pretty, too. Did not have Matzoh Meal but had great success with plain, dry breadcrumbs.
