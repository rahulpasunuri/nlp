Delicious. My only changes were substituting ground beef with Morning Stars Meal starters, adding diced zucchini and substituting the jalapeno with crushed red pepper. The cinnamon really did make the dish and the sweetness from the yams (which I roasted) complemented the heat in the rest of the dish. Definitely a keeper!

It serves more like 6-8 than 4. Definitely add salt!!

This dish was great, but we found that even nearly 1 lb of potato wasn't enough because we only had a 9x12 pan. I also used red pepper flakes, extra jalapenos and extra garlic. I substituted some leftover chili for part of the beans and meat, which worked out very well. Boyfriend loved it and we will almost certainly make again.

Delicious! Used some of the recommendations from the comments - doubled corn and black beans. Also, added cayenne pepper and additional cumin. Fit nicely in a 9x12 pan. Subsituted ground turkey for the ground beef. Baked the dish the following night as I was taking it to a friend on bed rest - was perfect!

This is a delicious fall meal. We all loved it and it was even better reheated the next day!

Doubled the corn and added avocado. One of the best meals I've ever made off here.

This recipe is delicious, and has such a unique flavors! I had to adjust the spices and herbs to my taste, and added more cumin, some crushed red pepper flakes, etc. I used canned tomatoes with jalapeno peppers, which worked great. The cinnamon in the base and the sweet potatoes is the hit ingredient that carries through the whole dish. I baked the sweet potatoes..it's easier than peeling and boiling them.

Great use of sweet potatoes, it is tasty and I have routinely used ground turkey or lean venison instead of ground beef.

bland, bland, bland! faint flavour of cumin and chili powder, but this dish is severely lacking in the spice dept. Some Herdez taco sauce added at serving time helped a bit, but won't be making this again. as we were eating, we sorely missed both real shepard's pie, and real mexican food. this recipe is a poor, poor attempt at both.

What a wonderful casserole dish this is...I found that I needed to add more cooking time to the method....the addition of cinnamon in the ingredients gives this dish a curious taste sensation without being sweet

We have made this recipe 3 times, and loved it every time. I even made it for a school potluck last night, tripling the recipe. Everyone loves it! For the single recipe, we used canned diced tomotoes with jalapenos (drained), canned fiesta corn (a whole can), and a whole can of black beans. I even used canned, chopped jalapenos. I baked the sweet potatoes and then scooped out the cooked potato, instead of the peeling, chopping, and boiling. We have also made it with ground turkey, and added shredded cheese. Even with all these shortcuts and changes, it's delicious and nutritious. My 10 year old daughter says it's her "#1 dinner."

This was quite delicious. Not being a big fan of beef, I subbed in MorningStar veggie crumbles, and it worked like a charm. I also left out the corn. This is a cozy, autumnal, colorful (and vegetarian, if you want!) meal. I'll definitely make this again.

Great!! I made a few changes just due to personal preference. I substituted 1 cup of white beans and left out the corn and black beans. I used buttermilk in the sweet potatoes. I loved this!!

This was ok. I thought the sweet potato a bit much for all the other flavors that were in there. I would also think the a culinary magazine would know that a shepherd's pie is made with lamb and a cattage pie is mad with beef.
