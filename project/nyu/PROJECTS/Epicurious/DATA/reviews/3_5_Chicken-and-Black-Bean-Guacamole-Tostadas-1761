Too quick; too easy; too simple to modify; too good to not keep on hand.

Very tasty and easy recipe! We made our own tostada shells since the store didn't have them by putting corn tortillas in the broiler.

This dish was delicious! Since I'm not a fan of guacamole, I used refried beans instead. Served this to a friend for lunch and my husband and I dined on the leftovers at dinner. Both raved about this tasty dish- my friend had seconds & my husband had thirds!

This was fresh tasting and delicious. My 14-yr. old daughter and I loved them and she wanted them again the next evening. I do think they would be best as a light summer meal or lunch. Made it exactly as recipe stated.

Everything went well together. Nice and light. Not complicated to make! Definitely a regular dish to make.

Simply wonderful and easy too. Hubby can back for seconds.

I have to admit I expected more. The recipe was okay (I especially liked the goat cheese) but the flavors overall were rather bland. I don't think I'll make this one again.

The hardest part of preparing this recipe was finding a good avocado in our local grocery store! The result was so delicious that I made it again the following day. I preferred the yellow corn taco shells I used initially to the flour tortillas I tried the second time, although both were good. The corn taste is a much better compliment to the other ingredients, particularly the goat cheese. Since this can be prepared in less than 20 minutes and is so healthy, I will definitely be making it regularly.

Great recipe and overall, pretty healthy. Keeper

Yum yum yum. This was so fun to make too. Served it with some Spanish rice and it didn't need anything else. I poached chicken breasts with an onion and some parsley and s&p, and it came out really flavorful. I forgot the green onions, so I threw in some chopped red onion which added some nice texture I thought. Definitely make more of everything than the recipe calls for, or don't expect to have much left over anyway. Even our 6 year old enjoyed this (although our salsa was a little too hot for her) and we got lucky with some great creamy goat cheese. I've used feta before, and it's not the same. Can anthing really beat lime and cilantro with a cold beer on a hot night?

Great recipe - I agree it is more of a lunch or summertime dinner recipe - I would add a good amount of lime to the chicken as well as the guac. I used warm flour tortillas instead and made soft tacos with it - very good!

This was excellent. I served it over chips (like Nachos) with the Corn, Black Bean and Rice recipe and it was so tasty. My picky Husband liked it. Definitely will make this one again.

This recipe is excellent, complex flavors and easy preparation. I will definitely make this again. I will increase the avocados to two with the same measurements for the other ingredients.

This was great! A very nice, easy flavor. My husband wants to try it as a quesadilla and warm. Maybe I'll have to use a Jack cheese or something. This is a great recipe though for a light lunch.

I did really enjoy this recipe! My husband thought that they would be great warmed on a stone on our grill so we tried it and they were great! Big rave reviews from all who tasted. Gave them a warm taste and melted the cheese just enough...I would definitely make again for a "margharita monday" summer celebration!!!

This is a great alternative to your standard beef tostadas. The cilantro and lime adds an amazing fragrance! You can add another chicken breast to the recipe and have it for lunch the next day without a tostada shell. Makes for a very fancy chicken salad!

Yummy and simple.

This was delicious, healthy (I think), and very easy to make. The lime juice really added a great flavor, in my opinion. Everyone in the house loved it. The only problem I had with this recipe is that it didn't make enough! Next time we will double everything.

The whole reason I chose to make this recipe is because I had a taste for goat cheese and I had some cooked chicken leftover - and I am not a big chicken fan. We were in a hurry and this came together quickly and beautifully - I completely forgot to sprinkle the goat cheese on the tostadas before serving but my husband and I gobbled them up saying they were the best homemade tostadas we'd ever had! Only change was an extra minced garlic clove in the guacamole (we love garlic). I can't wait to make it again with the goat cheese so I can up my score to 4 forks!

Quick and Easy. Took about 40 minutes from start to finish. Didn't use tostadas but had tortilla chips on the side - same idea. Husband and I enjoyed a light but filling dinner for a change. Good flavor - especially with all the lime juice.

This is a great summer weeknight dinner. Very easy. I poach the chicken breast in broth and come out very moist. Have had with all of the toppings and sometimes just the guacamole and chicken on the tostada and still very good.

I used half a rotisserie chicken and ready-made guacamole and salsa and like the reviewer from San Diego, completely forgot to add the black beans. Regardless, not only did the dish come together very quickly, it was quite yummy. Goat cheese on top was a surprise treat. This will definitely become a spring/summer entree staple.

This was a great(and ridiculously easy)recipe. Perfect for a week-night dinner for busy couples. Even better with a few fresh jalapenos added into the chicken mixture and served on home baked flour tortilla tostadas!

This was a fresh tasting mexican recipe. I used store bought guacomole and broke taco shells in half as I could not find tostados. The whole family loved the recipe! My 6 yr.old never eats mexican food and took several helpings!! It is so nice to find a recipe that everyone enjoys in my house since I have very picky eaters...thanks to this fantastic web site! Note if you put too much salsa on the tostados it drowns out the flavor of each ingredient.

This dish was easy and excellent! We used taco sauce on top rather than salsa for an added kick.

YUM!! Very easy and very tasty. I used prepared guacamole with spices and eliminated the salsa. Also, I forgot to add the black beans. It was still delicious. We had enough for leftovers the next day.

I made this for the Superbowl. I used chips and thus adapted the recipe so it wouldn't be too much filling for a chip. Made the guacomole (excellent) and mixed shredded chicken with Frontera Grill prepared salsa and cilantro. Put a bit of each mixture on a chip & garnished with a bit of shredded lettuce and crumbled goat cheese. DELICIOUS!! And so easy.

I decided to make this up as I had two left over chicken breasts and an avocado, not to mention that I love guacamole. My avocado wasn't ripe enough so I couldn't mash it. We just added the black beans, green onions, and peppers to the chicken mixture in sun-dried tomato tortillas as I find tostada shells too complicated to eat. This was extremely easy to make for such a delicious outcome!

This was delicious and easy, but not exactly quick if you have to cook the chicken. I bought Senor Felix's guacamole (excellent stuff) and added the beans to it. Served it with Spanish rice and Margaritas!

This was fast, easy and delicious!! I purchased quacamole and salsa to make it even easier and used fresh corn tortillas instead of fried tostada shells. I also used feta instead of goat cheese and thought it was great, even though I admit it sounded odd at first. The flavors all complemented each other well and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Yum! I bought my guacamole, put the black beans in with the chicken and served with sour cream and salsa. I has to fry my own tostada shells from fresh corn tortillas as I couldn't find prepared tostada shells but worth it. Next time I might just use tortilla chips broken up and serve like a salad.

Delicious! The feta really adds flavor--we used a lot of it. I made this as a salad with tortilla chips, and used more black beans than called for. Will definitely make again.

Everyone in my household loved this recipe. Some ate it on tostadas, some in burritos with rice, and some with chips like nachos!!!

Great dish! Used purchase guac, but added the black beans in with the chicken instead. Broiled the tostadas for just a minute or so (but without lettuce and salsa), then added lettuce, salsa and a little sour cream. Mmmmmmmm. Hubby had seconds. And thirds! Can't wait to make again.

Just wonderful! Even starting from sratch (uncooked chicken, home-made guacamole and home-made salsa) this came together in about 30 minutes. We couldn't get any tostada shells, so we mixed everything together in a big salad bowl - maybe couldn't call it a "tostada" after that, but it was still great! Hubby reported having trouble breathing after dinner, because he ate so much, and it was the only "course" I served! Simple, easy, and delicious!

Actually my husband made this as a surprise for me and our daughters for Cinco de Mayo. Excellent surprise. I wouldn't change a thing and I know that I will make it again. Very good and Jim said it was fairly easy to put together. He also made frozen mango for dessert - awesome!

This is excellent! It is very simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to find. My husband and my children thought it was great! This would also be a good edition to a Mexican Menu when you have guests!
