I was looking for a different vinaigrette for salad and thought this recipe would be great. It was awful. It was missing something and I still can't figure out what it needed. I ended up using a Good Seasons mix as I would have been mortified to serve this to guests.

fantastic! great for my new year's buffet - there were no leftovers. I roast the garlic in the toaster oven while the steak is roasting in the oven so i don't have to leave the oven on for so long, just a time saver.

This is a good, basic steak salad recipe. I did find the vinegar to be a bit overpowering and will use less next time.

I only made the vinaigrette to marinate some pencil thin asparagus (topped with chopped roasted red pepper, toasted pine nuts) as a picnic side dish. Although I intentionally made a lot to have leftovers, I wasn't expecting my boyfriend's mom and aunt to be eating them for breakfast! My apartment was also pleasantly perfumed for a few days after roasting the garlic

Prepared this dish for a picnic. It held up well with the transportation, tasted delicious and had a very nice presentation.
