Yeah, no, sorry. Just not very interesting. Added a little extra Dijon to bring the flavor up, but just too much onion. I found the Chicken with Mustard Sauce and Watercress (this site) to have much more flavor.

My son and I did this recipe together and it took very little time to come together. It was very good and easy to make. I added garlic to the onions and mushrooms and served it over brown rice. It was a hit!!!

Quite good. Drain the peppercorn, otherwise the taste is too briny.

I made the sauce to go with a roasted chicken and potatoes last night. It was incredibly bland and not worth the ingredients used.

We love this dish! I made it for my husband soon after we first met (back when I was trying to impress him!) 13 years ago. I have since made it numerous times. It's always a hit!

This was delicious and my husband said it rates up there in my top 3! I altered the original recipe slightly: After seasoning the chicken with S&P, I cooked it on an indoor grill (no butter!). When making sauce, I cooked the onion, mushrooms, etc. in olive oil, and I replaced the cream with low fat sour cream. I didn't have any green peppercorns, so I added about 1/2 tbs. of fresh cracked black pepper. If you love pepper, this recipe is a hit.

I made this without the broth, and substituted fat-free sour cream for the cream. It was very tasty and had the right consistency.

Capers make a great sub for the peppercorns in this recipe. Delish, fast, easy. Vigerous boiling for the reduction gave me the perfect consistency. Served with rice, but it would be better over noodles I think.

We absolutely love this dish! I've made it both with and without the peppercorns, and it is good either way. A comment on the trouble some cooks have had with the sauce. If you use fat free or reduced fat products, you will invariably have problems with your sauces "breaking" or being thin, it is an inherent problem with this particular substitution in cooking.

The sauce is too thin for this recipe. I served it over pasta and that helped save the meal. While it tasted fine, it's not something i would make again really, just because i have better recipes than this not because it was horrible or anything. I would just rate this as average or mediocre.

Very flavorful. I didn't have the peppercorns, but I didn't miss them in the finished product. I substituted fat free evap milk for the heavy cream. Other than that, made it as directed. Delicious. (I did manage to "break" the sauce somehow, but I suspect that was my fault and not the recipe ... in any case, it tasted good!)

I liked this recipe and it was very easy to make. My chicken breasts needed to simmer a little longer in the end to finish off. I also added 1tsp or cornstatarch to thicken the sauce. The only thing that it was missing was garlic. Next time, I would add a clove or two of garlic while cooking the muchrooms, onions and peppercorns. Overall, an easy recipe and I had all the ingredients at home.

Did this with chicken tenderloins and it was excellent! Added a little extra sherry also, I like the taste. I think this would be an excellent dinner party dish , since you could have the chicken already browned, the mushrooms ready and then just do the sauce and rewarmingj at the last minute.

I thought that this recipe was delicious!!!! I used bone in skinless whole legs and whole breast. I think the bones give the added flavor, I also did not have any mushrooms on hand so I used canned mushrooms. After the chicken sauted to brown on both sides, I added the mushrooms alone and turned the heat to high to remove excess liquid. I then proceeded with recipe. Results were amazing!!!! Yum!!

This was a great recipe. The peppercorns were a little spicy for some family members, but nobody complained. I loved them, and added more than the recipe called for. The sauce was a little thin, even with a bunch of reducing - I think I might use less mushrooms next time, and add some cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce. My girlfriend had an opposite opinion - she would use fewer peppercorns and more mushrooms.

Very simple recipe. I am in disbelief that someone can actually mess this recipe up.I think this dish is great. The family i cook for does not like pepper so i had to leave the peppercorns out. Needed a bit more dijon and a hard reduction to make it stick to the chicken, and to the ribs....mmmmmmmmmm. Good stuff. Just like any meal...a little technique goes a long way.

I was disappointed. I had to add a little oil for the mushrooms and onions because the pan got too dry. I also prefer to use flour before frying the chicken. Try the chicken with port-mushroom sauce.

Simple and delicious. I made it twice; Followed the recipe the 1st time, but made the following changes the 2nd: Replaced breast fillets with debonded and skinned thighs and reduced butter and cream by half to compensate for the fattier meat. Definate improvement - espesially in this age of chicken breast overkill.

Very good and simple -- just what I like. The peppercorns were great; however, I added a little more than the recipe called for. I might try it next time with fat free half & half. It would be great served over fettucine with asparagus. We loved it!

A dissenting opinion. My husband and I found this dish absolutly bland. Even with the peppercorns. I ended up pounding some mustard seed in my mortor and pestle and sprinkling it on the dish to get some flavour. If I'm going to splurge, diet wise, on cream I want it worth it.

Just made this dish. Loved it, I changed a few things to make it more time effective when entertaining. I used chicken thigh fillets rather that the breast halves, sealed in a hot pan and made the sauce less the cream and cooked in the oven for 1 1\2 hrs on a low heat.Done the day before. Next day I heated it in the oven again until just before it was needed. Removed the chicken and added the cream to the sauce and heated it up on the cook top. Fantastic and I wasn't stuck in the kitchen with the guests here. The chicken was tender and full of flavor.

This was very tasty! I left out the peppercorns and mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand, but it was still yummy. Also, to reduce the fat, I replaced half of the cream with fat free half and half -- still rich and creamy. Definitely a keeper.

This was the greatest. I would most certainly make this again and wouldn't change a thing!

I thought this was a very tasty dish. It was so easy to make, and it looked very impressive. My husband like it too, although he wasn't crazy about the green peppercorns (which I personally love). Just as the gal from England below me suggested, I too served it with a potato Rosti ... and boy, what a nice combination that made! I also served it with broccoli. I'll make this dish again.

Fantastic flavour. I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed. The whole family loved it and I agree, the peppercorns make it - what a nice bite! We are having this christmas eve as our special dinner. Highly recommend this recipe.

I highly recommend this dish - it was a great hit when I made it. I saved about $10 by not using the peppercorns and it was still very, very tasty. I also used port instead of sherry (and doubled the amount). Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. Quite a fattening dish, however. The sauce was so good I'm thinking using it over fettucine. Enjoy!

Very nice says my husband, I thought it was great and so easy and quick to prepare. This is a keeper. Just when chicken was getting boring. Try shallots instead of regular onion.

This recipe is really good - I've made it for my family and for company and everyone always loves it. The sauce is really good - I think the peppercorns make it- give it a little kick. I served this over a potato rosti w/baby carrots and sugar snap peas arranged around the plate for company and they were impressed!!

Delicious and easy. I left out the mushrooms and peppercorns for finicky family members ;-) Still very very yummy!
