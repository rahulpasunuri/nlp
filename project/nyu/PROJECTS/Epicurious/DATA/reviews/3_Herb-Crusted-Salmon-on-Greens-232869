A nice dish for lunch or a light dinner.

This was ok. I added more lime juice and a bit of honey, salt and lots of cracked black pepper to this otherwise bland dressing.

I really liked the salmon. I usually don't make salmon this way, but I think I will start from now on. The dressing was a bit off for me. I don't know, I feel like it needs something. I made extra, so I will play with it to see what I can come up with.

Next time I'd like to make it exactly as directed. But this time, I had ocean perch instead of salmon, lemon instead of lime, and lettuce and shaved cabbage instead of baby greens, and not enough fresh dill so I substituted fresh chives to make up the difference. But it was still delicious and got rave reviews! Served with plain rice and steamed broccoli, and a lemon wedge, it looked gorgeous on the plate, with the various shades of green. The only thing I would change is to make a bit more dressing so there could be more greens.

We used halibut rather than salmon so that the whole house wouldn't smell like fish. It was SO good. Since the halibut was thick, we added a bit of water and put a lid on the pan to finish the cooking through steaming the fish. Deelish!

This was a simple and different variation on salmon. I eat lots of it and was pleased with the results and flavors of this recipe. The remaining dressing, if there is any leftover, can be used to dress up a quick salad for lunch with sliced red onions and shiitake mushrooms.

Excellent, easy and nutritious recipe. It also works well with trout.

huh...i thought this was pretty average. i didn't think the herb "crust" was all that interesting. you could have taken any salmon recipe (grilled, any old marinade, whatever, put it on a bag of salad greens, and had a fast and healthy meal.
