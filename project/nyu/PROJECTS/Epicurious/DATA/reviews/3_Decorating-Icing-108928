Should be called decorative lemon icing, as it has a distinctive lemon after taste. I was very disappointed.

Is there a reason why the same exact recipe has at least 5 separate entries? It's really frustrating to search for a recipe and wind up with MANY links to the same exact recipe. Regardless of how many times it has appeared in the magazine, it still wastes my time to follow different links to a repetition of the same recipe.

Finally, an icing for sugar cookies! I love the flavor and consistency. Made as is it is perfect for piping lines and decorations. Thin it a bit and it's perfect for glazing and flooding. The snow white color made it a perfect backdrop for my Christmas cutouts. After frosting I sprinkled them with colored sugars. When placed on a platter with other cookies the iced cutouts disappeared first. It also seemed to help the cookies keep better. I have had them at room temp for a week now and they still taste great. I could never do that with the buttercream I used to use (which was a lot more work to prepare). This recipe was sooooo easy. I love it, love it, love it.

Really the best of this sort I've made. Other decorating frostings often too stiff and flavorless. This recipe is excellent made just as described.

Love it, it makes the cookies very yummy. My only problem was that I didn't have an electric mixer and it took me an hour to mix the frosting instead of 10 minutes.

Love the frosting - looks beautiful (and I love the cookie!) Um, frosting is supposed to be sweet??

The quantity of sugar in this was too high--it hurt my teeth. And, it couldn't improve the butter cookie recipe, either.
