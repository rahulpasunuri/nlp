I would rate this a 3 forks except I thought it too sweet as well. Next time I will cut down on both honey and sugar. Also, the honey I used has a very strong taste. Good strong, but strong and distinctive. The pistachios are a must.

This was heavenly! The texture is more like gelato than American ice cream and the flavor of the honey and toasted nuts was divine. I would make this again any time, it was easy.

More like honey-flavored whipped cream, this turned out yummy but not much like a frozen dessert. I'm wondering if using heavy cream would have made the texture more like ice cream. It's quite easy to prepare, so I expect I'll continue to experiment with it.

Everyone loved this, and it's very easy to make; it doesn't even use an ice cream maker. However, it's not quite the wonderful honey nougat ice cream popular in France. The taste of this recipe is similar but the consistency is lighter and less creamy. Of course, the recipe states that it's from Minorca (a Spanish possession), not France, so I can't complain. (If anyone knows a better recipe, I'd love it!) Recipe changes: I did think it was a bit sweet (though not unpleasantly so, and I prefer desserts that aren't too sweet), so next time I'll try cutting the honey a bit. Also, the recipe didn't say to toast the pistachios, but I did.
