This cake is fantastic! I made it for our July 4th party this year, and it received rave reviews. Then, I entered it into a berry bake-off fundraiser that was judged by 4 professional bakers . . . and my cake was given 2nd place out of 18 entries! I was thrilled - not only did it taste fantastic, but it also looked incredible! I did use Toba Garrett's cream cheese frosting recipe which is my go-to cream cheese frosting and topped the cake with fresh blueberries and served it with a blueberry lemon sauce - yummy!!!

I used soy milk (powder) instead of milk, and tofutti cream cheese (non dairy) instead of cream cheese. Still came out great. Folks didn't believe it was non-dairy. But it was a "low" cake. How high is it supposed to be?

We made this as a birthday cake last year and it came out perfectly, people still talk about it. This year we are thinking of making the same cake again but as cupcakes. Has anyone else done this?

This cake was amazing..not dry at all. To all at are getting dry cakes your probably over mixing and over baking. i made this in an 8in pan and used fresh orange juice. i also used 1/2 of buttermilk and 1/2 cup of 2% milk. In the blueberry filling I added some brandy. With the frosting i didnt use all the powdered sugar . everyone loved it.

This is a beautiful cake. The sponge turned out wonderfully, it was light and fluffy and not heavy at all. One thing though was the icing was still quite soft after over 30 mins refrigeration. It didn't matter so much since I made it in a rectangular sheet pan and plopped the icing on top. The sponge has a beautiful light orange flavour and the blueberry filling is delicate, fresh and summery. I used extra zest in both the batter and icing. Maybe I softened the butter and cream cheese too much? It is a very hot and humid day after all. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for my son's birthday party, and everyone LOVED it. It is time consuming to make, but not difficult in the slightest. The orange flavor is subtle, and goes beautifully with the tangy blueberries. All in all, a unique and tasty cake, and a perfect summertime dessert.

This cake was scrumptious. I closely followed the recipe, with additional lemon juice for the filling (to taste) and extra orange concentrate and zest, and about half the powdered sugar, for the icing. Having seen the many comments about the cake being tough and dry, I googled "fix tough cake" and came up with several diagnoses of too much flour. So, I used cake flour (as specified) and carefully measured: spooning in the flour and leveling with a knife, instead of my usual scoop and dump method. Some more scientific cook could probably help this recipe by giving a gram weight measuement to prevent over-flouring. The frosting was gloppy, but this didn't bother me. The cake didn't look like the picture (did they freeze it?) or fondant but like gloriously soft, swirly, pale orange frosting. I decorated it with plenty of blueberries and blackberries (nicely tart against the sweet frosting). The only other change I made was to use frozen blueberries for the filling -- twelve ounces of Cascadian Farms frozen blueberries was exactly the right amount.

This is a fabulous cake! I made it for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I am my biggest critic when it comes to my baking and I found nothing to complain about! The frosting and filling are delicious (I added a little extra orange zest and frozen oj concentrate to the frosting for more flavor). The cake is also great. I think that if you have trouble with it coming out dry you have either over-mixed it or baked it too long. It is a heavier cake but it needs to be. A sponge cake would definitely not stand-up to the richness of the frosting and filling. Following the advice of the last reviewer, I covered the whole cake in blueberries and it was a stunning presentation.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. It's my wife's favorite, and she asks for it every birthday (for the last 5 years or so). I have not had an issue with dryness at all. The biggest difference I see is that I cover the whole cake with blueberries, and it is wonderfully fresh, beautiful, and delicious.

I made this for a big birthday party I threw and it was fabulous. I doubled the recipe and made a 4 layer cake and filled 2 layers with blueberry filling and the middle one with extra frosting. Based on other reviews, I also did half buttermilk and half milk, less sugar in the frosting (just added it to taste) and more orange juice/rind. I also used frozen blueberries for the filling - which saved $$ and worked just fine. The cake is dense, but in a lovely, moist, pound-cake way and the flavors are subtle, fresh and nuanced. To prevent glopping with the frosting, I frosted a thin layer, chilled it for ~30 mins, and then frosted the rest. The 4-tier presentation looked great and I topped with mounds of fresh raspberries and blackberries. Definitely recommend.

Ok I cheated by using a cake mix. I added orange rind and concentrate to the mix and it was not dry.

The blueberry filling and cream cheese frosting were excellent. But even with using buttermilk instead of whole milk, we thought the cake was too dry although it had a nice orange flavor.

I made this cake for my girlfriend's birthday, since she loves blueberries. The cake was a success, despite this being my first time baking, and a hit. Other reviewers noted that it was dry, and yet another attempted to compensate for this by substituting buttermilk for the whole milk, which made the cake dense. I split the difference and made it with 1 cup of each and the cake turned out great.

This cake had very good flavor but I found it a bit dry (any suggestions?). I switched out the icing and used a fresh orange buttercream with candied orange slices to garnish for a true orange lover friend- he was very happy.

This cake is beautiful and the orange/blueberry combo is perfect for summer. I added a little cornstarch to the blueberry filling to ensure that it didn't run. I also cut the sugar in the frosting in half and added more OJ concentrate. Next time I will use a sponge cake recipe instead, add the OJ and peel and squeeze fresh juice over the cakes when they are warm. My cake was a little tough. (Yes, I was careful not to over mix)

I thought this was a really good and relatively easy cake - also very pretty. The texture was great and the icing delicious. I might cut back on the sugar in the icing, but other than that a very nice cake. I will absolutely make it again!

This cake is delicious. I have made several times, and everyone who tried loves it. It taste like one of those very expensive cakes that you special order. The blueberry and orange combination, plus the cream cheese frosting, makes this cake different from the ordinary. You should give it a try.

I made this gorgeous cake last week, and it was delicious. Because some reviewers said that the cake was a little dry, I used buttermilk instead of whole milk in the recipe. Perhaps as a result of this (although I'm not sure) the cake, while dense, was not dry. Since I didn't have any blueberries or the time to make the filling, I used some raspberry preserves for the filling, and the result was both visually appealing and tasty. I agree, the frosting is a bit gloppy--which made it a little hard to handle. However, the gloppiness itself gave the frosting a definite "comfort food" quality. This is a perfect springtime cake! P.S. For decoration (since I didn't have any blueberries) I got a daffodil from my back yard, snipped off the bloom, and plunked it in the center of the cake. It looked beautiful against the pale orange color of the frosting.

My neighbor still talks about this cake I made for a BBQ four months ago. She couldn't believe a 28-year-old single guy could whip up such a sophisticated, fantastic dessert such as this. Truly, truly delicious. And the icing is creamy sin. The cake can be dense, as other reviewers note, and I try not to think about all that sugar. But if prepared correctly, and if you don't try to eat a monster slice, it's absolutely a winner. Try.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly--just cooled the cake and filling overnight before assembling and frosting. Frosting was the biggest challenge as it softened up quickly, even in a comfortably cool kitchen. Overall I thought the frosting was good but it truly overwhelmed the cake. I probably would have enjoyed this more simply as a single layer cake with the blueberry filling atop and a bit of whipped cream. The cake did rise well for me but was dense and a bit dry as others noted. Might make this again as written for a buffet to offer some variety, but not for a solo dessert occasion.

Rating: 3
This cake was so good that at a recent family gathering, even those who were not great dessert eaters had seconds. I had a request to make it again for another party four days later. I too found the cake rather dense, and a bit dry (although I used the cake and pastry flour); I prefer a spongier cake. However, the icing was to die for and the blueberries were just the right complement to its flavour.

Rating: 3
I made this for a birthday party. Very good, and very pretty. The cake was a bit dense, but in a good way (similar to pound cake). Very subtle orange flavor in the cake itself. I think one pint of blueberries for decoration is probably way too much - I used less than 1/2 pint, and it looked great. The best part of the cake is the frosting: to die for!!!!!

I made this dessert for my inlaws and it was delicious! The cake was not dense as some other bakers commented. (Perhaps they didn't use cake flour.) The frosting was HEAVENLY! I served a slice of the cake on top of blueberry coulis and sprinkled it with orange-frosted almonds. One note for improvment. I doubled the lemon juice in the blueberry filling. It needed more tang to compete with the sweet cake and rich frosting.

This was a great cake. Everyone loved it. It was dense but dense in the 'scratch cake' way (not that fake light, fluffy stuff from a box). The icing was excellent. I didn't change a thing. Used my frozen wild blueberries (just had to boil them a little longer). Left some blueberries out to thaw for decoration. Scattered them on top of the cake with some orange peel.

The presentation is by far the best part of this baby - I decorated mine with blueberries all around the endes and a little smattering on top. But, as other reviewers have noted, the cake turned out way too dense. The frosting is heaven, however, and the orange flavoring divine. Still, this is not an A+ cake, though my birthday boy was still impressed.

I have made this cake twice by following the recipe exactly and the results could not have been better. The cake rises high and is not heavy at all. Cake flour makes the difference, and don't skimp on sifting. The orange and blueberry flavor combination is light and satisfying - a real crowd-pleaser.

This is probably the best cake recipe I have ever come across. I have made it twice for parties, and both times it was a huge hit! Beautiful texture, not at all heavy. Wouldn't change a thing.

I too found the cake dense and somewhat dry so used a favorite yellow cake recipe for repeat efforts. By using the frozen orange juice and zest for part of the milk requirement in my old standby recipe I was able to achieve the orange flavor in a lighter, higher-rising cake. Didn't have a problem with the blueberry filling or the frosting -- but agree, there are leftovers!. The cake is beautiful, decorated with berries and orange peel curls.

Aghh!! Made this cake for some visting relatives and it was a disaster. Cake was like a brick - very heavy/dense. Warning, don't make this cake in hot weather and be very careful not to overbake it. I didn't overbake mine but did make it during a hot spell. I love blueberries and the cake did look fantastic but would maybe do this with another orange cake recipe.

I've made this cake for two bridal showers and both times I've been very pleased with the results. Recently, I tried doubling the recipe to make a four layer cake. It was definitely worth the extra work!! Take the time to refrigerate the blueberry sauce before spreading it on the cake - it makes all the difference.

I haven't made this cake yet, but I will this weekend. A tip for those who found the cake to be too heavy: separate your eggs and add the yolks as directed in the recipe. Beat the egg whites and fold them into the rest of the batter, gently. This should give you a lighter cake.

I made this recipe for a friend's graduation party and it was raved over! The recipe doubled very well and was easy to prepare. One small problem I had in assembly was that the blueberry filling stayed somewhat thin & I had to slather on the cream cheese frosting in a hurry to keep the filling from squishing out. Luckily the frosting is thick enough that it was well up to the task. The final product looked stunning, and the 3 layers that I used stayed very beautiful when cut. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I loved the overall outcome of this cake, both in taste and appearance. I did not find it to be light and airy, but delicious none-the-less. The blueberries did not cook down for me and I ended up with almost 3 cups total. It worked for filling, topping and on blueberry pancakes the next morning! I also had plenty of frosting for icing, with a small amount leftover.

I used 2 - 9inch Genoises that I had on hand. I split both cakes and filled them with cream cheese frosting, then put the two cakes together with the filling in between. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as presented. It made a sinfully rich, very delicious dessert.

Great recipe -- it was a big hit at the BBQ I brought it to. Don't skip the step of chilling the cake after adding the filling -- I did and it leads to runny filling getting mixed in with the frosting.

By far the best cake I ever made. This was the desert for a lunch I served to friends traveling from San Diego. The cake was moist and tasty. The frosting had a light taste. I thought the blend of orange and blueberries worked well. My next door neighbors loved the left-overs. It did take me two days to put the cake together. A lot of work, but worth it!

This cake is just about the best one I've ever made, if I do say so myself!!! It's so succulently rich, but has a light, fresh feel. The blueberry filling is very good and I think I'll use it for topping pancakes or biscuits for a lovely breakfast!!

I made this cake for a birthday party and received many kudos. The cake was very tasty, although a bit dense. I used a bundt cake pan for the top layer which was a great way to mound fresh blueberries on the top of the cake- it looked beautiful. Taking the advice from other bakers, I increased the amounts of orange peel and vanilla, and also halved the frosting receipe and served the cake right out of the refrigerator.

Rating: 3
This is a very good cake-if you follow the recipe carefully and don't overbake it. I usually start checking a cake at least 10 minutes before the recipe says that it is done. It is not a chiffon type, light and airy cake. Coat the blueberries with flour as stated in the recipe and they will fold in smoothly.

I give this cake 3 forks because the people I made it for loved it. Forget the fact they are family; they said they weren't fibbing to spare my feelings. If we had a half-fork here, I'd give it 2.5, because it did not turn out the way I thought it would. For one, the previous cooks are right; this cake doesn't get very high. If I did it again, I'd make two batches of batter to make three or four layers. There is enough filling and icing to accommodate four. I did take the advice of other cooks and add more orange juice concentrate; the flavor was very good and the texture nice and moist. For the frosting, I did 1/4 c. Crisco and 1/4 c. butter, which gave the frosting a bit more body. If I did this again, I'd use butter-flavored Crisco and skip the butter all together, maybe even cut down a little on the cream cheese. Also, I think the secret to this cake is to keep it refrigerated right up to serving time. So all and all, not bad but not the masterpiece I was expecting.

I made this for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it! I added a little extra orange concentrate and vanilla, since some commented on the bland taste of the cake. It was incredibly moist! Although the frosting was amazing, there's a ton left over! If you cut the recipe in half, there will be more than enough to cover the cake.

This cake was very good; I got rave reviews this weekend at a birthday party. The cake was light and had a wonderful orange flavor. The blueberry filling was just right, although I had problems serving the cake because the blueberries didn't stick to the cake and it kept separating. I had leftover plain cream cheese frosting that I used, so I didn't get to try this one, but it sounds delicious! I'll definitely make it again sometime!

OK, so I haven't exactly tasted the entire cake yet, but separately all three parts taste pretty good. There is a lot of extra frosting, I had over half left; also, DO NOT use 3.25 cups of sugar for the frosting!!! I used a little less than 1.5 cups and I think it was still a little too sweet.

Rating: 2
I think this cake has the potential to be a very good cake. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out just like the picture and flavorful but too dry. I am going to do two things differently next time. One: don't let the cake cool in the pans, and two: keep the icing (only) refrigerated, and ice the cake (kept covered at room temperature) just before serving.

I substituted lime zest and concentrate for the orange in the cake and icing recipe and used raspberry jelly for the filling (instead of blueberry). I really liked this combination and the cake was tasty (I liked that it was a bit dense). It was very popular in the dessert buffet I took it to.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and wasn't impressed. The cake was overly sweet and not especially flavorful; the icing was better-- tasty with blueberries-- but remained runny despite refrigeration (to be fair, I used 1/3rd less fat cream cheese, maybe that was a problem). Anyhow, the cake didn't present well. The guests ate it all and said nice things-- but who doesn't have cake at a birthday party? I have better recipes and won't make this again.

I made this for Memorial Day picnic, and just now notice that it's in "most Popular". I agree with all who said the cake was too dense,and dry. Also the icing didn't firm up enough, and there was WAY too much. But the combination of flavors was delicious, and it was a beautiful. I would experiment with other cake and cream cheese icing recipes along with the orange and blueberries for a better overall cake.

I made this cake for my 5 year-old birthday party. Everybody ate it, children and parents. (I had made two), and my friend Christine had 3 slices. I thought there was too much sugar in the frosting and I used less. But that was easy to make, I served it with ice cream.

Like the other reviewers, I too thought the cake was too dense. It also didn't take as long to bake as the recipe suggested- more like 20-25 minutes. However, the frosting was yummy (although mine didn't firm up as much as I like -- you might want to add the orange juice carefully and use less) and made way more than necessary to frost one cake, but I would make the frosting again with a different cake recipe.

My Mom made this cake for my birthday. I loved it. She was disappointed by the density of the cake too -- it just didn't rise much, but I thought it was more like a pound cake, and the combination of flavors was wonderful. She used frozen blueberries for the filling and fresh for the top. Yummy -- worth trying for a nice summer dessert.

Although this cake was a stunner to look at, I was disappointed in the density of the cake. It was much firmer and made a smaller cake that I had anticpated. There are too many other cake recipes out there...I won't be making this one again.
