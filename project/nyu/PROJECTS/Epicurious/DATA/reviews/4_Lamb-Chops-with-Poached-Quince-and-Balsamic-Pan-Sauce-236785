This is absolutely delicious. Loved every bit of it and can't wait to eat the leftovers! I did double the amount of quince and sauce as we ate the dish with bread. Highly recommend!

I am not a huge lamb, but I love this recipe! I am a sauce person, so I double the amount of apple juice and leave the same amount of sugar or less that the recipe calls for. It's delicious.

Easy and delicious! We substituted an Empire apple for the quince, and it worked out well.

This is the first time I ever made lamb. I would have cooked it a little longer (I had loin chops and cooked them 3.5 min each side). The best part by far were the pears (I substituted), I used cherry juice instead of apple too. They were so delicious, I would make them again even w/o the meat. I would have doubled the sauce, because it was so good, I would even put it on other things.

FEN OM INAL!!! Loved this easy recipe, used lamb loin chops, very thick, so I cooked longer than this recipe calls for to get to medium rare. Used 1 asian pear and 1 bartlett pear and apple cider. Now would agree that I could easily halve the sugar and still have a fantastic tasting sauce! However, I did the sauce exactly per the recipe and LOVED it. It was like a wonderful desert wine. Lovely! Will ABSOLUTELY make this again!!

Very good recipe. The rib chops are expensive but it makes an elegant, not too difficult meal for company/dinner party. Made with pear and pomegranate juice. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is easy and great. Ive made it several times and always sub the quince with pear; I can never find fresh quince. Ive also used cider instead of unsweetened apple juice and half the sugar. I recommend using high quality balsamic vinegar, it makes a huge difference.

This was fabulous! I used fresh apple cider and would use no sugar next time. Also, I had no fresh thyme or fresh oregano, but used dried and the flavors were superb. The combo of quince and herbs with the lamb and the thickened sauce enriched with the butter and the tang of vinegar made a spectacular meal.

Execellent dish we made for thanksgiving. We used fresh homemade cider and pomengranate molassess, no oregano (couldn't find it in store)and bosc pears (no quince) Truly wonderful flavors and great meal. We just kept saying Wow after dinner.

I'd like to amend my review by saying that our apple sauce is unsweetened, although I did add the 1/4 c sugar...

As we were discussing rating this recipe my husband said something was missing that didn't make him want give it 4 forks. Maybe more butter in the gravy or perhaps wine? I'll have to try it again. Couldn't find quince so I used pears (most grocers didn't know what I was saying when I requested it) and forgot to buy apple juice so we used apple sauce. I think the apple sauce was a very good sub as it gave the sauce some body. I'd recommend this substitution for anyone trying this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I just made it for dinner tonight. I used pomegranate juice instead of apple and cut sugar in half. I loved the quince flavor - this one is a definite keeper.

Also made it with a pear instead of quince and with only half the sugar. My wife and I loved it and will definitely make it again. Would be a good recipe for a small dinner party since it doesn't require much work and so much of that can be done in advance.

It was a little too sweet for me, I'd cut the sugar by half, used quince as per the recipe, it was delicious! Will definitely make it again!

it was better than a $200 meal at a restaurant! i couldn't find quince at my local grocery so i used "asian pear" instead and it tasted great! next time, i would use 1/2 the amount of sugar though. it was a real gourmet treat!

Delicious!! I used bosc pears as quince weren't available, however it still was an excellent mix of flavors. The recipe is pretty easy, but so impressive, it's perfect for entertaining.

Outstanding. For those who didn't use a quince, try it again when they are in season - they are amazing.

Incredible flavor and so quick to make! I used Bosc pears instead of quince but otherwise didn't change anything. Served over polenta with oven-roasted veggies...the polenta really took the flavor of the pan sauce well. My boyfriend took one bite and said "That's it. We're getting married." Good enough review for me :)

This recipe couldn't have been any easier. I took some liberties with how I made mine (skipped the quince as I was in a squash mood) and used a fig balsamic instead. The results were unbelievable. My recommendation would be to double up on your pan sauce because I think you'll find it is too good to not have extra.

Really simple and delicious! Didn't change a thing except I used cider instead of apple juice. Will certainly make again when quinces are in season.

I made this without the quince... used apple cider instead of apple juice, and added white wine and worcestershire sauce to the sauce. Also, rubbed the chops with dry tarragon, thyme, oregano and basil. Folks LOVED the lamb, and the gravy. Served with scalloped potatoes and green beans sauteed with fiddlehead ferns (with lemon zest & olive oil).

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone was impressed. Loved this dish and can't wait to make it again!
