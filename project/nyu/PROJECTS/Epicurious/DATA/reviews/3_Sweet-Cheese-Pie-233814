Pulsed the filling as other suggested, to ensure a smooth texture. Omitted the sugar in the crust and it was fine. Not sure I liked the nutmeg; next time will try without.

I actually make this with ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and it is one of the easiest desserts for the amount of compliments I get on it. I do agree that you really need to blend the filling in a food processor, though. Also, there is really no need for the sugar in the crust. I accidentally made it withut once and decided to omit it in the future.

terrible - followed suggestion to blend - pie is cloyingly sweet & has grainy texture even w/ ingredients well blended. Hands down one of the worst recipes I've ever made.

Oh, but it is SO important to blend the cheese mixture in a blender, then pour it into the crust. Otherwise, you get that nasty cottage-cheese texture!

This is great. I used low fat cottage cheese and whole butter milk. I also used a pre-made graham pie crust. Everyone just went on about how good it was.
