While not "traditional", it is the "class act" of southern style chicken... An interesting variation calls for using evaporated milk... and spices could include Thai sweet chili dipping sauce as well as garam masala and other spices. It could be called southern Thai fried Chicken. Bonne Appetite Mark D., Penang, Malaysia

mmm, sooo good! i used half the salt and it turned out really well. very flavorful, but not too overpowering or spicy. buttermilk is a key for any good fried chicken marinade. i will definitely make this one again!

This recipe is delicious. We also cut down on the salt, and used chicken drummettes in a deep fryer. Everyone loved it as an appetizer.

I followed this recipe exactly - except that I cut the portions in half b/c I was making it for 2. I have to agree with the reviewer who said it was salty. I would cut the salt in half next time. We did enjoy the kick of the spices, but they were not overpowering. I am 7 months pregnant and was concerned that I might get indigestion if the chicken was too hot. It was perfect. We served this with curried cauliflower (my husband's recipe) and it was a perfect compliment. We'll make it again.

Excellent fried chicken with Indian spices that are incorporated in the marinade and in the flour coating. One of the best recipes I have ever made, simply devine.

Moist chicken with crispy exterior that you smell before you taste. Doesn't get much better than this one...
