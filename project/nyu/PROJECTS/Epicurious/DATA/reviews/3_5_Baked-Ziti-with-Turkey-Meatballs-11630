I have been making this recipe for over ten years and it is my husband's preferred meatball recipe. I believe that the toasted pine nuts are essential; they give it a richness and moisture that ground turkey sometimes lacks. The meatballs freeze well and can be used for many other things. When I am making a mass quantity (like this week, when I am making spaghetti and meatballs for my son's football team) I bake the meatballs and they are still good.

I followed everything except the meatballs. Instead I used Armour turkey meatballs (i cheated, just didn't have the time to make from scratch) Family, loved it...had seconds & requested we have this everynight

Thanks for the advice butiflfeet that worked perfectly. I also did half turkey and half ground pork which helped quite a bit with the dryness. Have made these a few times now with my own sauce and spaghetti. Great!

I'm giving this 3 forks only because the recipe can be better with a few changes. First, I sauteed the onions and garlic in about a tbsp of olive oil, once this mixture cooled I mixed the meatball ingredients together. I also added 1/4 C parm and reduced the salt by half. I then baked the meatballs at 400 degrees for about 15-20 min. The meatballs came out really moist and flavorful. With these changes this recipe will be my go-to meatball.

The meatballs were great, the rest of the dish was basically lasagna. I'm going to make just the meatballs next time and maybe serve them with something less fattening.

Made just the meatballs (for Meatball Subs) adn they were very good; flavorful, not dry. I made mine too big, though, and they took a long time to cook through. Be sure to stick to the recommended 1 inch.

Very nice. My modifications: I used panko instead of normal bread crumbs; whole wheat pasta; reduced fat mozzarella; fat-free ricotta; and slightly less (jar) sauce then called for, due to personal preference. It was easy to put together, and tasted great. We're having leftovers tonight!

I made this recipe twice: once exactly as written, the other time I made my own homemade meat sauce that I use for spaghetti (with ground sirloin, hot turkey sausages, onions, garlic, tomatoes, red wine, basil); the one with my own sauce was quite a bit better and preferred by my family. The meatballs really don't add much to the overall dish except time. The best thing about this recipe is that it is like lasagne but easier to put together using ziti instead of lasagne noodles and is also easier to serve.

I, too, have only made the meatballs, and they are great. I followed the suggestion to add parmesan cheese, and recommend it, but not quite 1/4 cup, and remember to omit the salt from the recipe. I browned a few meatballs in a nonstick pan then finished cooking them with the (Trader Joe) sauce for dinner tonight. I froze the rest of the 'balls for weeknight meals later.

I followed the advice to add grated cheese. What a great taste! We loved it and will make it again for sure!

This tastes great, but is extremely heavy and time-intensive. Definitely not something I'd make often, but the recipe itself is good.

This was crazy good. But we won't be making it again because we just kept eating it and eating it. Basically it's wonderful but my waste band doesn't want me to make it again :) Although for people out there, I would suggest making it only if you have already made the tomato sauce - it was quite a process to make the sauce, then the meatballs and then put everything together.

no more lasagna for me -- this is so much better! everyone loves it and leftovers (if there are any) freeze perfectly. I substitute basil for parsley and sometimes when I really want it to be really decadent, I mix in a jar of alfredo sauce to the regular sauce. A great dish for kids!

My 3 year old (who loves to cook) and his mom made the meatballs and then I made my own red sauce (sauteed 1/8 c chopped onion, 1 sm. minced shallot, 1 lg. minced clove garlic until tender, added 1 can lightly pureed tomatoes, 1.5 TB reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms minced, 1/2 c water w/2 tsp good beef base (we like Penzey's), salt to taste, cooked down a little and added 1/4 c red wine for last 5 min.). Served it on wide egg noodles and there were "mmmmmm's" all around! This meatball recipe is a definite keeper and would be good with many sauce/noodle combinations.

I made only the meatballs (I made them with my own tomato sauce and spaghetti), and they were great! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a good amount of grated Parmesean cheese, and they were perfect. Turkey meatballs are usually too dry for me, but these were great.

This is my go-to turkey meatball recipe and I make it all the time. I make it with two modifications - First, I don't use the pine nuts (not a fan) and I add 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. It adds nice flavor. Also, cook them for longer than suggested. After searing them to get a good crust along the outside, I lower the temp to simmer, cover the pan and let them cook away. I like them on the drier side, so this works well. Enjoy!

I prepared this dish for a meal with my elderly grandparents. I chose not to make meatballs due to choking issues, but cooked the meat with the said ingredients. Cheated and used a much doctored canned sauce. Also used parboiled gluten-free rice ziti with fabulous results! A quick and delicious meal.

I just used the meatballs and store-bought sauce over spaghetti, but the meatballs were delicious. I simmered them in the tomato sauce rather than oil to try to cut back on some fat and they came out nice and tender with excellent flavor. Prepping everything but the meat in the Cuisinart rather than mincing by hand saved quite a bit of time.

The meatballs were quite good but the rest of the dish just ok. I'll just stick with my regular ziti recipe.

Just made the meatballs and they were wonderful! Deelish!

This turned out really great. It is important to make sure the meatballs aren't too big or the layering doesn't really work. I left out the pine nuts because the store was out and the meatballs were still very flavorful.

Like many who've reviewed this recipe, this ziti become a family favorite in my home. We make the meatballs routinely, with or without the ziti, often freezing them then reheating them with a sweet & sour sauce in the slow cooker. A perfect party appetizer.

This recipe for Turkey Meatballs has become a standard for me. They are wonderful and very tasty. I serve them with pasta as one of my standard meals. I do add two tablespoons of olive oil to the meatballs to make them moist, and normally use sourdough bread to make the breadcrumbs. But they are exceptional. However... I haven't yet made the baked ziti part! Maybe Ill get past the meatballs someday!

Great, pretty easy recipe. Here's what I changed: I used classico red pepper sauce and packaged bread crumbs. When making the meatballs, I substituted beef for the turkey and added a little lukewarm water to make the meatballs more moist. Also, I made two zitis (doubled the recipe) and the 2nd to come out of the oven was much more moist because I covered it in foil. Overall, delicious!

One of the best recipes I have made from Epicurious. The second time I made it I accidentally almost burned the meatballs while browning but there was actually more flavor to them. Make sure to use the Winter Sauce recipe. I substituted one can of crushed tomatoes and cooked the sauce about 15 minutes longer than suggested. Served to a bunch of hard core Italians and they raved about it - all had seconds at least.

This is so good and easy to make if you use a good quality pre-made sauce. Great for a buffet or week-night supper along with some good bread and salad.

I used a pre-made sauce and processed romano cheese, which made the dish a bit more salty than I desired. On the whole, I was very satisfied with the dish and will make it again.

The meatball recipe here is excellent. However, when I printed out the recipe, I didn't realize until I was shopping for dinner at the grocery store that the winter sauce recipe was on a different web page. I decided to buy prepared sauce, but the results were just ok. I am going to prepare again, this time with the homemade sauce.

This recipe was easy to make but we were totally disappointed in the meatballs. They were terrible. We never eat ground turkey, so maybe we are just so used to ground beef, it seemed the turkey had no flavor. The pasta and sauce with the cheese was the only thing that got eaten at our house. The meatballs went to the family dog for dinner.

Wonderful comfort food...delicious and easy to make. This dish has become a regular on our table.

I THOUGHT THIS MEAL WAS EXTREMELY DELICIOUS BUT CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE TWO HOUR EFFORT FOR A TUESDAY NIGHT MEAL! IT SERVES ME RIGHT FOR NOT HEEDING THE OTHER REVIEWER'S COMMENTS CONCERNING THE TIME INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS RECIPE DURING THE WEEK!

I used already-made Pasta Sauce and I baked the meatballs. To save time, I made the dish ahead of time and refrigerated it. Great flavor and the kids loved it!

My fiancee and I cooked this last night, and we thought it was a total success! We did NOT make the sauce. Instead, we substituted Tuscan Marinara Sauce from Trader Joe's, which worked fine. It was definitely time-consuming: it took about 1 hour for both of us to prepare. I will definitely make this part of my rotation.

A few suggestions: use less breadcrumbs and cut the meatballs in half. Not so bad, could have been better.

This is one of my family's favorite, albeit time-consuming, dishes. The meatballs are juicy and tender and the Winter tomato sauce is delicious. We have discovered that a great way to shorten the preparation time is to use prepared tomato sauce - Classico's Roasted Bell Pepper or Roasted Garlic sauces work equally well.

Very nice flavor and texture, different from the ordinary pasta and meatball flare. I do not recommend this dish for the weeknight meal, it's a bit laborious.

Recipe was great but really labor intensive. Next time, I'll try it with grilled Italian sausage cut into chunks rather than meatballs.

I have not tried it yet, but is sounds like very good, I would make it with beef or veal meatballs instead of turkey, which I do not like too much. Will cook it soon for my family and let you know if they liked it.

I agree all the way with the previous reviewer. I'm a big fan of baked pasta dishes and this is one of the best I've tried. I particularly like that the recipe is meant to be made with ground turkey, since I do not eat beef.

One of my favorite recipes from Gourmet. With a salad, the meatballs/pasta make quite a meal. I have made this dish several times for my family and larger groups. Always a success! And the leftovers are fantastic.
