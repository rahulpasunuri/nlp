Excellent! Made with ground turkey -- tasty, yummy, great even without the bun. Really like the mayo-BBQ sauce.

Wow! This is so simple and so delicious! It is now our number-one way to prepare hamburgers and a must-have recipe for camping trips (we mix the mayo and barbecue sauce at home and bring in a small lidded container to save ice-chest space).

Fabulous! We made the following alterations: Used a cracked wheat bun grilled with butter. Replaced the bbq sauce with a chipotle sauce and used plenty on both sides of the bun. Didn't dice the onions and chile but served the onions in rings and the chile in halves. Served with a side of corn and avocado salad with a cumin lime dressing. All in all, fantastic!

We used ground meat and thought that this recipe was one of the best burger recipes we've tried and easy too. The flavor was very different. Of course we love anything with pablano chilies. We also liked the simple mayo and barbeque sauce. This is a KEEPER!!

I used ground turkey and it was a very tasty combo of flavors. Served alongside grilled corn with jalepeno butter from Bon Appetit and a tomato salad. Something different from the regular burger.

Wish I could serve this to our Knights of Columbus, all 250. They do jumpin now & this would definitely refuel all of them. Its a great recipe when made with turkey.
