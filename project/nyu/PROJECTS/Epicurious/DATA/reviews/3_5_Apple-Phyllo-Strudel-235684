Sounds delicious ! Healthy and with a lovely twist to the 'ol apple strudel

The final flavors were good, but next time I would use less apples--I found I have quite a bit left over. I used 1 full cup of dried cranberries and a little bit of butter when I cooked the apples and added nutmeg. These directions for phyllo are also very inadequate and left my ending resulting looking quite unattractive. The phyllo makes is easy--I would make it again but only in a pinch.

This is great for those who don't like it too sweet/caloric. Only problem is lack of directions for those new to use of phyllo. Follow directions in Elsie's strudel on this site.

Elegant, easy to make, tasty, and relatively healthy as desserts go (unless you serve it with a cream-based sauce, which is the proper way to do it.)

Wow! A recipe you really can't go wrong with. Don't let the phyllo dough scare you - it's very forgiving even if it falls apart in your hands. I used olive oil instead of butter to keep the healthy theme going and it turned out just as tasty. We used raspberries and blackberries on top, but in fact preferred the blackberries. Go for the yogurt on the side, it's refreshing, complements the dish well and doesn't melt all over your plate!

A very easy recipe that results in a tasty and aesthetically pleasing dessert. I used real butter and no almond oil. I also had too much filling, so the second time I made it, I reduced the apples to about 1 1/2 lbs.

Made this for an Oktoberfest celebration , and it was a big hit. It makes a ton of filling though, so you should reduce the number of applese used. I used the amaretti cookies and it really imparted an almond taste. It was quick and easy, and I was able to make it a few hours in advance. Served with vanilla ice cream.

I made this for company Saturday night. I made this for a healthier option for dessert (along with chocolate molten cakes and vanilla ice cream for a not-so-healthy option). The apple strudel was a big hit! I used the dried cherries, cut the brown sugar back to 1 cup, and used the graham cracker crumbs. I plated a slice of the strudel with sliced strawberries and then drizzled the yogurt-caramel sauce over both. Really delicious for such a low-fat dessert. Also, I split the recipe into two strudels since there was so much filling and used butter flavored Pam spray between the phyllo sheets. Will definitely make again.

I made it the first time and it was yummy! The second time I took it as a dessert for a dinner party and everyone raved. Definitely a keeper... I used low fat cinnamon graham crackers crumbled between the phyllo layers and it tasted great. Also, used butter flavored pam spray.
