I found this recipe to be delicious just as is. My family devoured it!

I really enjoyed this simple salad and will definitely make again. I've been looking for a super fast dressing to compliment a mixed greens and egg salad, and this is perfect! East, fast, and delicious! I didn't use goat cheese; just the mixed greens, bacon, and over-easy eggs. I also added some thinly sliced red onions and I really liked the added layer of flavor. Will make again!

This works!! but I f.e.c.'d my goat cheese (flour egg crumb)and pan fried it so it was crispy on the outside and soft and wonderful inside. Excellent

Have made this several times and it is a perfect brunch dish. Will make it again this weekend for quests. I plan to serve it with a toasted whole grain baguette and for something sweet - Vanilla Fig Coffee Cake.

Very good, easy and light dinner. I used feta because I didn't have any goat cheese, and I fried my eggs over easy. I'll try the water trick next time.

After all the rave reviews, I was somewhat disappointed as I did not find the flavors worked together very well. I tried it again with a yogurt-based dressing instead of a vinaigrette and still was not completely convinced. However, I give this recipe FOUR STARS for its real ease of preparation and the great mix of ingredients.

This is my husband's & my favorite salad -- fast, easy and delicious! Especially good for a light meal now that summer is here (in Arizona, at least). I just made it for the third time for houseguests and they raved too. I opted to cook an extra couple slices of bacon and to double the amount of dressing, but others might prefer "drier" greens.

This is a great work night dinner, utilizing ingredients which many of us routinely have in our refrigerators. I happened to have a few slices of proscuitto, but no bacon. A nice soft goat cheese works the best. Takes minimal time with excellent results.

This turned out great and will make again for sure.

This is an excellent light luncheon dish. The flavors and textures all worked together beautifully. It probably helped that we had mail-order organic mixed greens but I suspect most supermarkets' mesclun mix would be just fine. It would also make a nice first course. We definitely plan to make this again.
