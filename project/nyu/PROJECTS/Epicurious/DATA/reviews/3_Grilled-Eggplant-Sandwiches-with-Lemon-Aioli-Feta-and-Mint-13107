This sandwich was very good. The mint gave such a nice fresh taste and I added some extra to definitely taste it. I didn't have any eggplant so I used roasted red bell pepper instead and it was yummy!

HUGE difference if you use Spanish "Alioli": 1 egg plus 1 yolk; 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice; 3 cloves of garlic; 1/4 tsp salt; 1 cup extra virgen olive oil. Put all except oil in blender. Add the oil slowly in a stream.

This was an okay recipe, but if I made it again I would probably put it on sliced bread instead of the halved French bread. The bread kind of overwhelmed the sandwich. I would also put more mint and less feta, and double the amount of aioli that the recipe makes. Maybe this wouldn't be necessary with a thinner bread.

This was a **delicious** sandwich. Really easy and quick to prepare. Don't try making it without garlic; it's not as good. It also works well if the eggplant is cold.

Very good vegetarian sandwich.
