My husband liked this much more than I did. It's simple and healthy, nothing special. The anchovy does provide an interesting note that's hard to identify.

This sandwich is amazing. No changes necessary. I make this, probably, two times a month and never get tired of it. Other great sandwiches on here are the 'spiced up grilled cheese' and the 'open faced eggplant sandwich.' for the latter, just add a little garlic to tomato mixture - it is heaven. i love sandwiches - if anyone can recommend others - that'd be great.

The ingredients are good, and this is better than the sum of its parts. If you already have a panini maker, it's really quick, and the rabe can be cooked in advance, or leftover from another meal. The flavors come together beautifully.

I adore this sandwich. I use Gruyere instead of Provolone. In a panini press, it is savory heaven.

This recipe was delicious! I made the panini using a ridged grill pan as suggested and it worked wonderfully (why would anyone buy a $200 panini press?). I used a good-quality gouda instead of provolone and added prosciutto. I paired it with the roasted tomato soup also on this website, and it made a lovely rainy evening supper.

This is the ultimate 'grown-up' grilled cheese sandwich. Don't skip the anchovies as they add the perfect boost in flavor. I've also used fontina cheese with success but sharp provolone is best.

I was thrilled to find this recipe. I like the tartness of the rabe and the uniqueness of having it in a panini. The anchovy, provolone and rabe combo is magical.

The addition of roasted red peppers makes this a little more tasty and better looking to boot. Try to use sharp provolone - the sliced deli stuff can't compete with the rabe. Of course, this sandwhich is even MORE improved with the addition of Italian roast Pork, but that kind of defeats the helthful simplicity a bit. Yum!

A nice twist on grilled cheese. I don't like anchovies, though, and instead added a little prosciutto and a dab of olive spread. Perfect picnic fare.

We liked this. It's cheesy and the raab is mild with the garlic and anchovy added. It's been a dry, cool spring here and my raab has gone crazy in the garden so I was looking for something else to do with it rather than the normal saute with dinner. I don't pre-boil my raab (or chard, etc.) but instead pour boiling water over it in a large (4 - 8 cup) pyrex measuring cup and let it sit for 6 - 8 minutes. No pan to wash. Used a grill pan and weighed down with a cast iron pan after covering the bottom in foil so no clean up for it.
