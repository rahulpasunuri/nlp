Hole-y Doughnuts! This was time-intensive, but so worth it in the end. I saved and froze the extra broth to use next time I'm craving this. I will soooo be making this all summer!

I made this a day ahead for a dinner party first course (didn't assemble ahead, but ladled a little soup over the mussels to keep them moist in the fridge). It was good but lacked sparkle, so I kept fiddling with seasoning, added just a tiny touch of cayenne and tandoori powder, which helped. Had no mint, so asked one of my guests to bring some from her garden for last-minute addition. And that did the trick! A world of difference! Raves and bowl-lickings. What a relief. I worked hard on the whole dinner, but this is what stood out, what the guests mentioned again on the way out the door . . .
