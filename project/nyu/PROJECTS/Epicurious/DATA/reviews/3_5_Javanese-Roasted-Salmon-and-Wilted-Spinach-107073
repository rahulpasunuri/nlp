Many thanks to the cook in Atlanta who was looking at the Asian Salmon bowl with lime dressing in the buzz box and referred me to this amazing recipe. Followed the recipe but added some fresh ginger and a sprinkle of black sesame seeds. Awesome!

There are so few really good salmon recipes out there - this is so great when you have less-than-spectacular frozen salmon and want to doctor it up. Absolutely delicious sauce on both the fish and the spinach. I made a 1/4 recipe for 2 people: one medium size salmon filet and about 1/2 pound fresh spinach. I would just roast the salmon next time - fell apart and stuck in frying pan.

I have made over 100 recipes from this site (I try to stick with well rated ones) and this is hands down my favorite. Everyone who tastes it begs me for the recipe. I can't understand poeple who give it bad reviews as I have never found it to be too salty or buttery or limey in the 20+ times that I have made it. I can only guess that people are cutting corners using butter flavored margarine or shelf stable lime juice, etc., but using fresh top quality ingredients, it has never let me down. I usually serve with rice steamed with whole coriander seeds, double spinach, and garnish with carrot strings marinated in rice wine vinegar.

Have had this dish at Saucebox in Portland and was very happy to find the recipe. Every time I make this, guests beg for the recipe. I skip the spinach and make asparagus with it. Usually cut the sauce in half (it makes plenty). Fabulous!

The recipe as is proved to be amazing!! Not only was the salmon perfect, but the sauce and the spinach were beyond compare. The sauce, although the ingredients sound eclectic, was the best part. We even saved a bit to use on some pork. Needless to say, anything the sauce touches is going to be special. LOVED IT!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! I make a batch of the sauce early in the week and put in the fridge. I have used it up to 2 weeks after refrigerating. That way the meal is literally done in 7 mins. Be sure to "fry" first for 2 mins eash side before baking to give you an extremely moist and tender salmon. I halved the brown sugar. Very very sweet.

This dish is very good. Amazing how quickly the entire meal comes together if you make the sauce and some rice ahead of time. My husband worked late tonight and missed dinner, and it took about 10 minutes to cook his fish and spinach and heat up his rice when he finally got home. The sauce doesn't taste that great alone, but it works well with the salmon and spinach.

Rating: 4
I have been making this dish since 2002 and I still love it! The only change I make is to double the pepper flakes - I think it needs the heat to compliment the sweet and sour. I always make extra sauce - it stores well in the fridge - and use it on grilled fish or chicken. I've used it on pork tenderloin as well. It's definitely one of my 'go to' recipes for summer cooking!

I have made this dish twice, once for myself and again for my mother's birthday. I made it just how it's written and I love it! I used pre-bought lime juice the first time which was really sour. I used fresh lime juice the second time and it was perfect.

Rating: 1
I made the recipe exactly as written and thought it tasted fine, no need for changes whatsoever. However, what kind of dish bills itself as "roasted" when the oven time is 5 minutes and the majority of cooking time is in the skillet? For that reason I was very disappointed as roasted fish dishes have a distinct taste/texture and this did not. Moreover, this dish is nothing more than a variation of a teriyaki application and I've made better ones. It was just a so-so dish in my opinion.

Rating: 4
This was an easy and fantastic recipe to serve for an impromptu BBQ this evening. We grilled the salmon so I used a bit of the sauce (before thickening) for marinade and the salmon was delicious and moist. In reading previous reviews I changed the recipe as follows: decreased soy sauce by 1/3 adding water to make up the volume, added ginger, doubled red pepper flakes, used only a small fraction of the butter in the sauce and none in the spinach and quadrupled the spinach. I also strained the sauce before thickening to remove the pepper flakes and chunks of garlic/ginger. We were all very pleased with the result. Served a lemon sorbet with gingered blueberries for desert. Yum. Easy, healthy, and tasty.

I liked the sauce with the flavors of the salmon but be careful not to add too much - it can be a bit overpowering. We used wild salmon, which was delicious. I also stirfried some bok choy and red peppers with a bit of the sauce. Delicious and easy!

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I cut back on the lime juice a bit. I tasted the sauce before putting it on the fish and baking, and thought it was still too limey. But after tasting the fish after baking, it was perfect. The flavors in the sauce really balance with the strong flavors of the salmon. This is just fabulous and will make again!

This is a lovely sauce for salmon. I followed the receipe precisely and found the flavours well balanced. I served it with wasabi mashed potatoes as other reviewers had suggested. It worked with the fish and spinach beautifully. I can't wait to make it again.

We really liked this but I am sorry to report that we can't rave about it like everyone else. I reduced the butter by almost half and consistency was fine and it really was quite tasty but not rave-worthy. You want a fish recipe to rave over? Try the Sea Bass with Miso (on this site).

Rating: 4
We've *loved* this dish every time I've made it. The combination of flavors is wonderful, though I do reduce the amount of butter. Also, I cut dark brown sugar with a bit of white sugar, since I don't usually have golden brown on hand. I double or triple the spinach, and cook it in the same pan that I've browned the salmon in. Good with carrots or red bell pepper, and rice. Leftover sauce is delicious on pork or chicken.

Rating: 2
The whole recipe is nice but the sauce is what I thought needed refinement. It was very sour from the lime juice and I think it would have been better on the sweeter side, with just a hint of lime juice. When I added the cornstarch it made a giant blob in the sauce that I had to fish out. Not sure why, I've never had problems with cornstarch before.

Rating: 4
This is a great one!! I made it for dinner the first time my Mother-in-law came over. The second time I made it, I put the baby spinach under the fish in the roasting pan. It was still tender but not overly so (which tends to happen to me.) Have passed this recipe along to friends.

Rating: 4
I have made this a few times, which says a lot because I rarely make the same dish twice. The combination of ingredients is just so good. My father does not like salmon (which I didn't know until I prepared it for him) however, he ate his entire meal and stated that he loved it because of the sauce. Thus, it's one of those dishes you don't want to use with Copper River salmon or any other more expensive type. Great company dish.

I would have reviewed this recipe sooner, but I had a heart attack soon after eating it... just kidding, but I had to reduce the ammount of butter, and simply steamed the spinach. Tasty sauce, but next time I will add even less butter, as the main flavors are the other ingredients.

Excellent dish - the sauce was fabulous - I more than doubled the amount of red pepper flakes, and even added some to the spinach. I prepared mashed sweet potatoes, placed the spinach on top of them, and placed the salmon on top of the spinach. Instead of roasting the salmon, I pan fried it, and spooned the sauce around the edges of the plate. Got fantastic reviews from my friends - who all said it was the best meal they've had in a long time.

This was incredible. I really think the fresh lime juice is key. I didn't add it but I think a bit of fresh grated ginger to the sauce might be lovely. We used 3 bags of spinach and served the dish on a bed of basmati rice. We both really enjoyed it. It was quite easy to make as there was very little "prep" work. I think this would be a great dish for a dinner party.

Yum! The sauce is to die for! I don't know what "javanese" food entails, but to me this tasted like Thai? Anyway, it was easy and good and what else can you ask for? I used 6 oz of spinach for 2 of us and that worked great....

I used low sodium soy sauce, didn't have fresh limes so used part fresh lemon juice and "real lime" juice. I think fresh lime juice would have helped. Used extra pepper flakes but in the end it could have used more to balance the flavors, I would add even more next time. My husband loved it and I thought it was good. Made (2) 10 oz pkgs of baby spinach-(we love it!)for three of us. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes, great!

I made this for the first time tonight and cannot believe that anyone would give this recipe a bad rating. My husband says that this is the BEST salmon he has ever had. I did divide the whole recipe by 4 in order to serve 2. As other reviewers have suggested, I cut the required soy sauce about in half (added water for the deleted sauce). For my 2 servings I used 6 oz. of spinach (twice what the original recipe would have called for). Next time I would use 8 oz. Maybe the reason that this turned out SO good is that I had a lot of reviews to look at THANKS TO ALL OF YOU!!! This is what this site should be all about. If you want a real hoot, go to "Pistachio Sea Bass With Crab Salad".

I Loved This!!! I usually don't like salmon, and the salmon I found in my freezer was 2 years old. An airline pilot friend of mine caught it near his home in Alaska and flew it cross country to trade for my Jersey tomatoes. I'd forgotten about it, but it was still in relatively good shape when it was defrosted. Just a little fishy. I really hated to waste it. To my surprise, the sauce actually complimented the stronger fish flavor. Because of the condition of the salmon, I added a tsp. of fresh ginger and tripled the amounts of garlic and hot pepper flakes. Also, to make it a little healthier, I seared five or six 5 oz. fillets in olive oil, not butter and reduced the amount of brown sugar by 1/3. I poured the entire sauce over the seared fillets in an lightly oiled baking dish and baked for 10 - 15 minutes at 400. I prefer salmon on the dry side. Before placing it on top of the spinach, which was wilted in olive oil, I removed the skin and sliced it into strips then frizzled the strips in smoking olive oil. This is a great garnish. Pour the remaining sauce from the baking dish over everything and dig in.

Rating: 2
Not as good as I thought it would be but still a keeper with some tweaking. I followed the advice of using less low sodium soy sauce and would do that again. I baked the salmon too since it was just easier. It needs something else to give it some zing (yes, I added some red pepper flakes) though...maybe I will add a dash of fish sauce next time.

My favorite part of this dish is that it is good left over--I made it for the first time last night, and am enjoying it right now COLD.

it was a good attempt at what I think can be a *great* recipe, but way too much butter flavor. I was expecting the sweet/sour spicy glaze typically served with thai pla prik...?? my guess is that the recipe used butter in an attempt to simulate what thai restaurant chefs use as a base. (any thai chefs out there know the recipe??) next time I will reduce the amount of butter and substitute with water to mix with the sugar. also, I doubled the pepper content, but it was still not enough. next time I will try quadrupling the crushed red peppers.

This is possibly my favorite recipe on this website. I have made it countless times. It is a sophisticated yet simple way to prepare salmon, and the sweetness of the marinade is balanced out nicely by the spinach. Be careful not to overcook the salmon (don't keep it in any longer than in the recipe). Once you try this recipe, there seems no reason to prepare salmon any other way ever again!

I agree - the more spinach the better. But in defense of the recipe, I believe the small bed of spinach is intended as a garnish, rather than a side dish. This is supposed to be restaurant-style plating, I believe. The fish is the main focus of the dish. Is it not always the intention of chefs to make sure all the food groups are on each plate. This should be considered one course in a series.

Rating: 3
This dish was so easy to make for a weeknight meal. I agree with the others about increasing the amount of spinach per person. My four-year old daughter (who has an aversion to green foods) loved the spinach with "the sauce". I'm saving the extra sauce to entice her to eat other vegetables!!

Wow! My fiance can't stop talking about how good dinner was last night. We grilled the salmon, I used two 5 oz bags of spinach for the two of us (what were they thinking?), and served with the Quinoa with Mango and Curried Yogurt from this site. Note that the brown sugar and butter will seize up and separate after a couple of minutes, but just keep whisking and it will eventually blend back together and start to bubble. Use low-sodium soy sauce, and go ahead and make the whole recipe. I halved for the two of us, and wish I had more sauce left over for another night.

This is my first review. I made this just for me and my sister as an experiment one night. It was incredibly fast and easy. Having read the rpevious reviews, I took note, but clearly lost the message regarding salt. Having made the marinade, I tasted it and almost gagged on the saltiness (did not have low sodium soy). I was able to doctor it up and was delighted. One question to other reviewers: how do you prepare this for a dinner party with a first course for a large group, let's say 10 people, without overcooking the salmon, or serving it unwarm?

I gave this recipe a score of three forks, even though the sauce came out terrible. I must've done something wrong, though...probably burned it.

The salmon itself tasted delicious, and so did the spinach. Everyone else is raving about the sauce, so I'm sure that I goofed somehow.

It is amazing to me that anyone would give this one fork. The sauce is not meant to be put on the fish like gravy, just drizzled for a little flavor! My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. i took other reviewers advice and cut back on the butter (I halved it) and I always use low-sodium soy sauce so saltiness was not a problem. All the flavors blended nicely together and the sauce makes the dish. Also, as others have said, the spinach is a nice compliment. Adjust the amount of spinach according to your own appetite. I serve this with Mashed Potatoes with Green Onions. I actually combined several recipes that I found on Epicurious and ended up using 1/2 cup scallions for 1# of potatoes - excellent accompaniment.

We decided it ranks up there with our other longstanding favorite salmon recipe--salmon with caper-anchovy butter (which we call caper ice cream) in March 2000.

This recipe did not live up to my expectations. I agree with Portsmouth, NH 100% - there's a comparable recipe on this site with a soy, honey, lime sauce + wasabi that is easier and has (in my opinion) a better flavor combination that this recipe.

While my guest loved this dish, I didn't like it. I'm not a fan of sweet and sour dishes, so it's probably fine for other people and not for me. I'm glad another cook recommended serving with mashed potatoes, because that ended up being my favorite part of the meal. A shame because I love spinach, salmon, soy, lime and red bell pepper flakes!

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe closely, and the sauce came out way too bitter (the lime juice overpowered everything else I guess). The folks who added sugar are probably on the right track. Nothwithstanding all the rave reviews, I wouldn't advise serving this to company without trying it first on yourself. The Honey and Soy Glazed Salmon on this site is easier, foolproof, and, to my palate, better.

When I first made this sauce and tasted it alone I thought it was too agressive. However, once it was on the salmon it was divine. We served it with Bok Choy and shitake mushrooms sauteed with a little soy. This is the only salmon dish my husband will eat - a ringing endorsement if there ever was one.

Rating: 3
I made this with wild Alaskan king salmon. Cooking time was perfect for a very moist, tender, flaky fish. Terrific presentation wowed all my guests. I liked the sauce but felt that it was too salty and slightly too thin. Next time, I'll probably up the sugar a little and the red pepper a lot and cut down on the soy sauce and use low-sodium. Don't do the final saucing until just before serving because the sauce "cooks" the spinach -- turns it mucky.

What a wonderful dish! I substituted salmon trout for the salmon and as I was unable to find spinach, I made the wonderful mashed potatoes with leeks and sour cream, also on this site. My family raved about everything. The sauce is lovely and intense. Best to go easy with it and keep the leftovers for something that needs to be jazzed up!

Terriffic! Easy to prepare, and makes a great presentation. Drizzled some of the sauce on the plates first in an interesting pattern, then added a mound of garlic mashed potatoes, the wilted spinach, finally the salmon and the sauce. Impressed my guests, and the flavor was great. Will do this one again often!!!

This sauce is incredible with salmon! The other reviewers are right about the spinach, too. I used 2 bags for 4 dinner servings, and I should have used 3 bags. I sprinkled some scallions over after plating, and used a green onion flower as a garnish. A really wonderful dish for entertaining, but I'll make it again just for my husband and I. It is key to have all of the sauce ingredients measured and ready when you start the sauce - give it your undivided attention while preparing, and it's a snap. (Spoon a generous amount of sauce over the fish when serving, but don't feel like you have to use it all - I think it could end up being too much.) Try this recipe!!! One of the best ways to prepare salmon that I have ever tasted!!! To the cooks from Hamden and from Naples: I just made this dish for my in-laws for an elegant pre-Xmas dinner party, and the dinner could not have gone beter. Everyone raved!! I had never made the dish before that night - that's the beauty of websites like this one. Find a recipe with reviews like this one has, and you don't have to worry about a practice run. This is the dish to make!!!

This was awesome! We loved it! Kind of reminds me of the Honey Ginger Salmon recipe at this website which is also incredibly delicious. One thing, please line your baking pan with foil; if you add more than a spoonful of sauce to the fish before it roasts, like I did, the sauce will burn a bit at the edges of the pan. To the cook from Hamden, CT: this is a beautiful dish to serve, gorgeous colors, the salmon atop the bright green spinach. BUT, I always think you should try a recipe before serving it to guests or preparing it for a big event. I think it is definitely suitable for company, though!

Oh, WOW! It's been a long time since my husband and I got so excited about a recipe. We were still talking about it this morning. I must say I had my doubts during preparation of the sauce..."smooth" is not the word I would've used to describe the consistency once the sugar was added and melted. And when I added the lime juice and soy sauce, it seized up into a very scary crunchy ball. But, with continued whisking, the sugar re-melted into a fabulously tasty sauce. We served the spinach and salmon stacked on a big dollop of mashed potatoes. FABULOUS, and very impressive for company!

Delicious, Easy, great presentation! I halved the recipe (except for the spinach. I reduced the butter substantially - and didn't miss it. I also used low sodium soy.

Superb salmon dish - one of the best I have ever made! The tart/sweet sauce is very flavourful and creates a lovely carmelized glaze during roasting. I reduced the butter in the sauce to 1/4 cup, skipped the pan browning, brushed sauce on both sides of the fish and roasted at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes - my fillet pieces were quite thick. It was perfectly done, tender and moist. Lovely pairing with the wilted spinach - pleasing to the eye and the palate. A true winner!!!

Easy to make and so tasty! I firmly side with the more spinach camp - I used one bag for the two of us and could have used more. Another bonus to this dish: the clean up was very easy. I served it with butternut squash (cut into cubes) and pecans carmelized in butter.

WOW! What a wonderful recipe. I used very little butter and it still tastes delicious. I prevented the caramelizing by adding the liquids first (1 minute after the garlic) and before the sugar. It turned out great.

Yikes!!....I prepared the sauce in a large-ish skillet...big mistake since YES! I did carmelize the sauce. You have to much of a hot surface on this sauce, you look away for a minute..ruination. Even so, the family said to make it again, they could see there was a lot of potential here. Lesson learned...use the proper pan, dummy. I always wanted a nice saucier...a great chef's pan...now I have an excuse to splurge.

I read through all the reviews and after cooking the dish, found that much of the advice given was right on target: be especially careful not to carmelize the sugar and butter and use more spinach than specified! This recipe serves 8; however, I prepared it for four people and the spinach and sauce seemed the perfect amount.

Rating: 4
An outstanding way to prepare salmon both for the flavor and ease of preparation. Unfortunately, I didn't read far enough back in the reviews to reduce the butter. Will definitely do that next time. You can easily use a TINY FRACTION (e.g. 1T rather than 1/2 cup) of the butter called for here and still get great results. The point of the recipe I think is to showcase what happens when you team soy sauce, garlic, red pepper and lime. Yum! The only other change I would make is to roast the filet 1-2 minutes longer (mine were fresh wild king salmon a little over an inch thick), as my husband and I can't seem to get on the nouveau-fish-a-little-bit-raw-in-the-middle train.

I have made this dish 3 times already. I also use less butter, just enough to mix the sugar. TO increase the sauce I have added more lime juice and more soy sauce. Add a little cornstarch to thicken; then I put my salmon right into the sauce and cover it for a minute or 2 then turn it over. It cooks right in the sauce and only takes but a few minutes. The salmon also provides much of its own oil and you really can cut down on the butter. Such a pleasant taste. Served mine with polenta and the sauce over everything was so tasty.

This sauce is really wonderful! I have to confess that in the midst of preheating the oven, searing the fish, steaming some rice and preparing to wilt the spinach (oh, and did I mention the glass of wine I was drinking?) that I forgot to put the sauce on the fish before it went into the oven! But it was wonderful anyway and I intend to make it again soon. I think this sauce would be great on pork or chicken and expect to try it that way too.

I made this last night and followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and put less lime, low sodium soy sauce and I halved the recipe for just two.

Excellent recipe. We loved it. Tastes good and makes an excellent presentation. Even the spinach tasted good with this sauce. I served it with jasmine rice which was wonderful compliment. I halved the sauce recipe for just a few people and think I might use a bit less brown sugar next time. I even developed a lighter version using light soy sauce and Benecol in place of butter. This was delicious. By the way, Javanese is really different than Japanese. Javanese is Indonesian food popular in Indonesia, a country in SE Asia.

The editors have a lot of nerve calling this a "Japanese" dish. Just because they throw in some soy sauce it's Japanese? Get real, people.

It's a hit in my kitchen every time!

My husband & thought this dish was superb. Used red salmon (sockeye) caught in Kenai, AK this summer, that was frozen and shipped to me by my family. I also use low salt soy, fresh limes (that had been zapped in the microwave for a few seconds before juicing to make them juicier) and a lot more spinach. This recipe is added to my salmon recipe collection....which is quite extensive from years of living in the Alaska & Seattle.

Rating: 3
Because I had all the ingredients on hand, this was a really easy dish to prepare. As mentioned earlier, be careful of over-carmelizing the butter sugar. I used low-sodium soy sauce, lime-juice from a plastic lime, although prob. not the 1/2 cup called for, and threw in extra chili peppers for good measure. We also used tons of spinach because it was so good with the fish. We also didn't cook the fish as long since we like it pretty rare.

Rating: 3
To avoid over caramelizing the butter and brown sugar mixture, stir just until dissolved, then add soy sauce and lime juce. The too salty complaints can be resolved by using low-sodium soy sauce. The too citrusy complaints arise because limes vary greatly as to sweet and tart; add lime juice gradually and to taste. Almost everyone will want more spinach, and regular is fine rather than baby spinach leaves which are costly and not readily available. Any leftover sauce would be good on almost any fish, especially tuna, or poultry, and probably pork, too. No, the recipe isn't Javanese, but so what? It's delicious.

Rating: 1
What a waste of good salmon. The sauce is too sweet and to my taste garlic with fish is almost always a bad combination. To real fish lovers; skip this recipe.

Rating: 3
Maybe if you used sweet soy sauce and birds eye chili instead of pepper flakes & soy sauce.Skip the brown sugar. Skip the lime and use tamarind pulp instead. Throw in a few shallots along with the garlic.And no butter but coconut oil.( a pound of butter is about 3 days wages if you can even find it in Indonesia)And do not roast the fish but grill or fry. (I do not know to many Javanese folks who have ovens!) Also, salmon would be really hard to come by, more realistic would be fresh tuna steak.Inexpensive in Indonesia and can be found at most markets! this is now a Javanese fish recipe. Not a Javanese inspired fish recipe.

I would actually rate this 3+ (I really save the 4's for drop-dead recipes). This was excellent and so quick to prepare. Although we have great salmon up here, I got kind of tired of it for awhile. After having made this recipe, it has renewed by taste for the beautiful fish! My husband simply loved the fish, the sauce and the spinach. I cleaned a large bunch of fresh spinach and split it between my husband, son & I. I made the sauce exactly as written and cooked 3-8 ounce pieces of salmon. Since we have remaining sauce, I am looking forward to trying it on something else. The sauce is so yummy I could drink it! :) Highly recommend trying this one.

We found this recipe to be delicious and perfect for a week night. I made the sauce several hours ahead so prep time was cut to almost nothing.

After all the great reviews, and having made the glazed grilled salmon and honey-ginger salmon, I was really disappointed with this recipe. I found the lime juice WAY too strong a taste in the sauce, and I had to compensate by adding an awful lot of sugar. Also, I just grilled the salmon on tin foil, like usual, and most of it either slid off the fish onto the foil or just burned up! Maybe my fire was too hot? Serving the fish without extra sauce was not much of anything, so everyone put leftover sauce on the fish, which made it ok but not great. Next time I'll try it with about one half the lime juice and see how that goes. Maybe pan searing it first would have made a big difference, but I can't see how.

Rating: 3
This was a fairly successful recipe, the sauce was very interesting but maybe a bit too limey- I will cut back on the lime juice if I make it again. Additionally, I would serve it with gingered or basmati rice instead of just the wilted spinach. Worth a try!

Simply divine! We made this recipe twice in one week. The sauce is the perfect combination of sour, salty, hot and sweet. We tripled the amount of spinach. We followed the cooking instructions for the salmon the first time and only baked the salmon (without any extra butter) the second time. Both ways were great but I will continue to bake only in the future. Easy and delicious!

Haven't made this, but wanted to chime in on the debate about this being Javanese. I've lived on Java and no they wouldn't use butter. Butter is barely available in Java, and certainly not outside a large city. Lets just call it Javanese-inspired. And to the poster who talked about French influence, Java was a Dutch colony, never controlled by the French or British!

Delicious! Best salmon I've made and like other reviewers can't wait to try the sauce with chicken. Did triple the amount of Spinach. Used low-sodium soy sauce and wasn't too sour/salty. Also decided to forego the butter when cooking the salmon. Instead basted it with some of the sauce while I broiled it on both sides, then finished cooking the salmon by roasting it.

Excellent dish. My husband really enjoyed the sauce and has asked me to try it with different types of meats as well. The only thing I wasn't real wild about was the over powering taste of lime. If you aren't a fan of a strong lime taste, I suggest reducing the amount of lime juice used. I know I will reduce it next time.

Can hardly wait to make this, however want to join the discussion now. To those who talked about the delicate taste of salmon, something to consider...ALL SALMON DOES NOT TASTE THE SAME. There is farm raised Atlantic (my least favorite), Coho, King, Norwegian, even farm raised Norwegian. Each one is unique and tastes slightly different. One might taste better with this sauce than another. I am going to start with the Norwegian (not the farm raised). It's wonderful and should stand up to the sauce very well

This ranks #1 in my book. I used low sodium tamari and about 1/4 less than called for. I also doubled the spinich and it still wasn't enough.

Great recipe. I added an additional clove of garlic and used low sodium soy sauce. There is a lot of sauce left over for garnish or for another time. Just be careful while heating it up so all of the ingredients don't over-carmelize or get separted. I agree with everyone else on more spinach. Rice pilaf goes well too.

While my end result was delicious, I had to make some emergency adjustments to the sauce. Like a previous reviewer, I found the soy and lime flavours to be way too pungent - nothing but salt/sour! However, I kept adding sugar - a signficant amount - until I found the right balance, and everyone raved. With this adjustment, four forks. (Also, having put a half cup of butter into the sauce, I just steamed the spinach (used extra), and seared the salmon in a small amount of canola oil blended with a dash of sesame oil, which added a nice flavor.)

We thought that this was very good. The soy sauce did get a little overpowering, so I may decrease it next time so that the citrus flavor can come through. I didn't use any butter to brown the salmon, just a teaspoon of olive oil, and it did jut fine. This was very quick to put together. The only thing that concerned me was that, when melting the brown sugar into the butter, it didn't get smooth and bubbly; instead, the butter separated from the sugar, and the sugar started to carmelize and harden. I had to work quickly to smooth it back out with the rest of the liquid ingredients, and it came out fine in the end. Just be careful.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it. The salmon was came out perfectly and the sauce was delicious. One slight change: instead of using butter to saute the salmon, I used canola oil instead (figuring I already had butter in the sauce). The salmon didn't come out as brown as it would have with butter, but it was still delicious. The sauce is so flavorful and rich that we didn't miss the additional fat. I also used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular.

This recipe rocks! My guest and I were in ecstasy the first time I made this. I've already made it a second time. I actually doubled the spinach, cause it cooks down so much. I told my vegetarian friend that she could use tofu instead of fish, although the salmon comes out of the oven golden and perfectly cooked. I served this dish with the "Mashed Potatoes w/Green Onions" (on the same page), and the whole dinner was ready in an hour.

This recipe was fantastic! I would definately not skip the spinach, it was a perfect duo with the rich sauce. I liked the sauce so much I want to try it on chicken or beef! Perfect mix of tangy and sweet. For the review who could only taste soy sauce, I have found that I always need to start with about 3/4 the soy and taste, some are stronger than others and can be overpowering.

I really enjoyed this sauce and my salmon came out perfect! I didnt have the spinach so skipped that part but I just love the sauce! Very sweet and tangy!

My sister made this and we loved it! I've added this recipie to the great things to do with salmon - hash, sugar-seared.

Sound wonderful to me. I like making a balance of sweet to salty.

This dish was awful - All we could taste was soy sauce.
