No bottled sauces?! A good plan but get over yourself. If you've got a busy family, some days you need a short cut. This is a good way to use left over chops. I've done it a couple of times -- even made extra, planning on these sandwiched for a quick pick-up night.

I have made this many times before (and loved it), but this time I changed it a bit. Due to eating restrictions on one of our guests, I made it with sliced chicken breast! It was fabulous! Our guest loved it! My husband liked the chicken better than the pork! I will definitely make it again - however I think I will always use chicken now in lieu of pork.

Much better the second day. Okay, but not a keeper for our family.

I did not like this recipe at all. The pork never got tender enough and although it was sliced thinly still seemed to be too chunky for barbecue (I am used to almost a shredded barbecue pork). The sauce was nothing special (but I will say that it seems that the taste of the sauce will depend a lot on what brand of barbecue sauce you use).

This was a nice change , I made potato salad with it, and we all dug in, I didnt have bourbon so i used brandy, still was good,

Excellent flavor! This is not your average barbeque sandwich. The caramelized onions really add a great, sweet flavor. I used BBQ sauce from the Salt Lick in Austin, TX once and Stubb's BBQ sauce for the second time. Both were delicious. I made a basic, homemade coleslaw. Awesome!

Very easy and a YUM+ ! My sauce was a little on the thick side but just add more bourbon or water, great flavor! I buttered the rolls, then put garlic salt, cheese and broiled before adding the slaw and pork. Will definately make again and again.

Great flavor and easy. Next time I will add more bourbon because it all evaporated when I poured it in the pan. Also, the more sauce the better.

This was wonderful and easy to make. The onions and bourbon made it delicious. I didn't make a sandwich of the pork, and it was great.

This was fast, easy and delicious. The bourbon definitely adds flavor to the bottled sauce. I put homemade coleslaw on the sandwich, too.

I made this the other night and used the "Super Slaw" recipe from this site as a substitution. With the exception of my 7 year old that does not eat any green, everyoned loved it. Next time, I will make the BBQ sause that goes in this from scratch as well and that will put it over the top. A keeper.
