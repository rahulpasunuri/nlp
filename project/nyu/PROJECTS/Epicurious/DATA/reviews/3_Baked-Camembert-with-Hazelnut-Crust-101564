I made this with a goat milk brie because that was what I had and it was very good. Not 4-fork worthy of the most amazing thing I have ever tasted, but a nice recipe to have on hand. It was easy to make (I found hazelnuts at Trader Joes, already husked--there were still some skins, but I just left them on and it seemed fine to me). You can make it ahead of time and looks very pretty when baked.

This can be a perfect entree. Baked Camembert is a wonderful way to experience a different taste of this cheese. It is simple and so tasty. You can pair it with chilled dry white wine and red grapes.

Yuck. I wouldnt' waste another good wheel of Camembert on this and I can't imagine it would improve a mediocre wheel.

Delicious, easy and satisfying. The hazelnuts take a while to peel but since the dish has to be chilled for a while, there was no last minute fuss.
