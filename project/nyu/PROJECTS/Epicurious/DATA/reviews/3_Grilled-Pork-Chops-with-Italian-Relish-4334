Our boneless chops were 1/2" thick, so I reduced grilling time to under 4 min. per side. I'd also pre-salted them at room temp for tenderness, then rinsed them before pouring over the marinade. Reduced the amount of onion to 1/4 cup. Great, piquant dish.

Love it. My husband isn't a fan of onions so I skipped that. But still, it was a crowd pleaser. I would totally do it again, even adding the onions back in and I think I would still love it.

And I came up with this very recipe when I realized that my bruschetta would be good on grilled pork. It's also good with chopped kalamata olives. It's a recipe, not a patent.

I am giving this recipe one fork because this is MY recipe - I am the one that created the original version and submitted it to 'Too Busy To Cook', and the recipe that appears herein, and in the magazine does not contain my ingredients, nor my preparation methods. I complained to BA when the recipe was published (I was not notified it would be changed for the publication) and received a written apology, for whatever good that does. I wasn't going to 'out' them for altering reader's recipes for Too Busy To Cook, but now that the column is gone, and they have taken BA in a new, regrettable direction - I don't care!

My modifications: 1) I also used a can of diced tomatoes flavored with italian herbs and added grape tomatoes as well. 2) After marinating the chops for close to an hour, I pan-fried them, seasoning liberally with pepper and sea salt. 3) Then I fished the onions I had sliced out of the relish and caramelized them. 4) Then I added the relish into the pan, COOKing it, and reduced the sauce. I ended up with quite a different recipe than intended, but GOOD! The cooked "relish" is excellent and could be used on many other meats/seafood.

This looked good on paper, but wasn't very good. I even marinated for several hours like previous reviewers suggested, was still flavorless.

Maybe it was the red onion I used but this is just too "oniony" for me. Next time I'll cut the amount, but in general it's a simple tasty meal. Do marinate for several hours if possible.

Yum. Could not be easier for weeknight preperation! Used cherry tomatoes as you can't find a decent tomato up here until full on summer... Served with grilled yellow summer squash. Healthy and satisfying.

This was a great enhancement to the usual marinated meat on the grill. We really enjoyed it. To take the "bite" out of the onion flavor, I soaked the chopped onion in ice water for about 15 mins and then drained and dried it before adding it to the tomatoe mixture. Next time, I'm going to try the relish with steak.

If I make this again, I will probably cut back on the garlic and onion. I wanted the tomatoes to really star in the relish, but the garlic was a bit overpowering. Still good, though. Served it with orzo, which took in the extra relish quite nicely.

Very easy and quick. I noticed in one review that the pork itself wasn't overly impressive. I decided to marinate mine in a little wine vinegar and oregano about an hour before adding the rest of the relish juices. Fantatic for summer!

Review purists, please forgive me: I made this with chicken thighs. Chicken was fine -- not great -- but relish was TERRIFIC. I used Vidalia onion b/c I had no red onion and I added 1/8 tsp fennel seed. I will make the relish for bread topping and side dish again.

I rated this recipes a fews years ago, and continue to make it regularly when tomatoes are in season. I purchased a turkey breast that was on sale (too good to pass up!) and tossed it in the freezer. I decided to subsitute the turkey for the pork - I deboned the turkey, cut pieces the size of chix breast - the only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. It was excellent - - I will make it again. I served it with grilled zuchinni & onion tossed w/ feta and herbs and crusty bread - a winner for an outside summer meal.

Very easy recipe. Fresh herbs tasted great. Next time, we would go easier on the garlic, and if you are using white onions instead of red, cut back on those as well.

Super easy and really good results. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and balsamic vinegar rather than red wine vinegar. My boneless chops were rather thin- took about 4 minutes per side on the grill. Served with (boxed) couscous with pine nuts and green salad with shaved parmesan- doesn't get much easier!

Excellent and easy. Relish could go with several things!

Great summertime meal. The chops stayed very moist and the salsa is delicious (on sourdough, chicken, fish too). Use fresh herbs if you've got them. A keeper.

This is one of our favorite recipes - everyone loves it when we serve it. The extra relish makes a great topping for toasted french bread.

The pork chops stayed moist. I let the relish sit for an hour to get lots of juice, and then marinated the pork for several hours. The pork didn't have much of the relish flavor. The relish was good,very strong garlic taste.

This is one of my all time favorite pork recipes. For truly awesome flavor, try marinating overnite - the Italian relish flavors blend and are even more flavorful the next day.

Great flavor! One of our favorite dishes for making when we have guests.

Love this recipe. My mods: use shallots instead of red onion so onion doesn't overwhelm other ingredients. add a few chopped kalamata olives to the marinade.

Great recipe! I used balsamic vinegar and canned tomatoes to cut down on the prep time. I also pureed some of the vegetables. I marinated it about an hour and a half. It would be even better marinated overnight. I think I'll try it with Chicken next time.

Doubles nicely. I used balsamic vinegar and started early in the day to allow the meat plenty of time to absorb the marinade (kept the vegetables separate after the initial marination).

Very tasty! I pureed some of the relish to add to the marinade and it really added wonderful flavor. Just be sure to test pork chops for doneness, my chops were thicker and required extra grill time. A define do again recipe !

This was quite good and easy. We used fresh herbs from the garden and made garlic-herb fettuccine to go with it. We put some of the relish on top of the pasta as well. I would definately make this again!

Quite a good recipe. Pork can come out a little dry if you're not careful with the BBQ, so try to marinate as long as possible. Also, next time I will try to puree a little bit of the marinade before soaking the pork, so the pork can get more juices. Don't make this dish if you don't like red onions.

This is an excellet dish. I get rave reviews every time I make it! I found no need to cook the marinade before surving it over the chops. The relish is wonderful as is over the pork. I use double thick chops and grill them to desired doneness.

The relish was fabulous! I substituted balsamic vinegar and white wine vinegar (equal portions) for the red wine vinegar with no problems. Served with fettucini noodles in Knorr's Pasta Rosa sauce and steamed green beans.

Classic northern Italian dish. Just what we were looking for. Be sure to cook the relish that you used as a marinade before using as a sauce.
