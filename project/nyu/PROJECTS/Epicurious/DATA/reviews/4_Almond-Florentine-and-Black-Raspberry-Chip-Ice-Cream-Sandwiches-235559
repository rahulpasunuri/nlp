This thing struck me as quite similar, taste-wise, to a Fox Treat, which is a hot fudge, raspberry, macadamia nut sundae/concrete served at St. Louis' frozen custard mecca: Ted Drewes. I may have cooked my batter down a bit much, a result perhaps of me having the heat up too high while also trying to stay true to the recommended cooking time. I ended up with seemingly little batter and clearly small florentines. My florentines were also a little on the lumpy side. One suggestion: sprinkle a bit of salt on each side of the florentines -- once just before you put them in the over, and once as you're flipping them. As there were only a few minutes remaining before National Ice Cream Day concluded, I couldn't possibly wait for the two-hour freezing time and risk turning into a non-ice-cream-eating pumpkin, so I went ahead and made deconstructed Almond Florentine and Black Raspberry Chip Ice Cream Sandwiches -- slathered some ice cream between two florentines, but, fully expecting them to fall apart and be impossible to eat by hand, i just tossed it in a bowl. My sister kind of lost it. Said it was the best thing she'd eaten in a while. And I also thought the sandwiches were pretty damned good.

This was AMAZING. I made just as directed except the cooking time was much less - about half. I turned them after about 5 minutes and then left them another 3-4 mins. I also added thinly sliced bananas between two ice cream layers between the florentines. This flew off the plate at my party - it was phenomenal.

Here is a simple and delicious recipe for raspberry dark chocolate chip ice cream based on Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything Vegetarian (AKA the greatest cookbook ever): - 1 cup raspberry puree, strained (puree ~2 cups fresh or frozen berries in a blender) - 2 cups whole milk - 1/2 cup sugar or 1/3 cup agave nectar - 2 tbs cornstarch - 4 oz dark chocolate, finely chopped. Put milk in a saucepan and bring to just a boil over med-high heat. Meanwhile, mix cornstarch with 2 tbs cold water to make a slurry. When the milk is heated, mix a little into the cornstarch, then add mixture to milk and whisk in sugar or agave nectar. Heat, stirring constantly, until thick (a line drawn with your finger along the back of the spoon will not immediately fill itself in). Make sure there are no lumps. Cool at least to room temp, mix in raspberry puree, and pour into ice cream maker. Add chocolate during the last 5 mins of churning. Form the ice cream sandwiches immediately or transfer ice cream to an airtight container and store in the freezer - homemade ice cream tends to stay soft enough that you shouldn't have to thaw it at all before making the sandwiches.

Hey, epicurious - how about a recipe for the ice cream! Black Raspberry chip is only available regionally (despite Oprah's plug for Graeter's) or with very, very expensive shipping.

Super quick, easy and impressive dessert! I used Swiss Chocolate Almond Ice Cream instead and it was wonderful. Great dessert for a summer dinner party.

Graeter's has the best black raspberry chip ice cream ever. It's really creamy with lots of raspberry flavor and chips the size of golf balls. FABULOUS! If they don't have one in your area you can order it on line.
