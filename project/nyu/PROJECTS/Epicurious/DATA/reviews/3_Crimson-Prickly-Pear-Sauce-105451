There's a massive cactus plant on a hill behind the Cal campus; every winter around January or February there's a beautiful array of fruit for those willing, no matter how careful they are to festoon themselves the with the tiny, painful thorns that are the price of admission for prickly pear bounty. The recipe works well, but I as well as others thought it was too sweet as a dessert topping. Notes: 1) Next time, I would use half as much sugar to allow the sourness of the lime and liqueur to come through. 2) There is a certain gaminess to the fruit juice that the additions help to diminish. 3) It helps to skim the froth from the fruit juice when it first starts to simmer to prevent it from boiling over.

We used it as a glaze for grilled chicken. It was just like one of the meals that we had in Sedona AZ. Very Good,
