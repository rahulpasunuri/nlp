I made this dish for our gourmet night, and it was amazing! Everyone at the dinner LOVED the dish, and my husband announced "this is a keeper". I used italian eggplants, and peeled the skins off before slicing. Getting the oil hot for cooking the eggplants and draining well is key. I used crushed marzano tomatoes and added 4 stems of basil to the sauce while cooking (and then removed the stems) as well as basil as garnish. If there were five stars I would have given it.

This was a fantastic dish. I am an eggplant lover, so I was delighted to find this recipe. I followed the directions as stated, with just a few changes. I added half an onion, chopped, when cooking the garlic. I also cut the basil into chiffonade and added it when simmering the sauce. I was unable to find the ricotta insalata so I subbed a good Pecorino cheese instead. The pasta was so tasty. This is a delightful recipe that I will definitely make again.

I grow Asian eggplant in my garden and made this recipe with them and ricotta salata cheese. Rather than fry the eggplant in oil, I halved them, brushed them with garlic oil and grilled them on the BBQ. A lot less oil and I think more concentrated flavor in the eggplant. A delicious meal!!!

Even though I consider myself an experienced cook, this was my first encounter with eggplant and it turned out beautifully. My husband and I both loved this dish. It was easy enough to make on a "school night" and allowed us to make use of our fresh garlic and eggplant from our CSA. I used a regular eggplant and ricotta because that's what was on hand. Enjoy!

This was delicious! I had to use regular eggplant and ricotta because we don't have a local store that carries the other varieties. It still tasted fantastic! I served it with chicken breast on the side. This is definately a keeper recipe!

Delicious. Used fresh mozarella instead of ricotta. Very fresh tasting sauce. Leftovers will be even better for lunch tomorrow!

The ricotta that should be used with this dish is called ricotta infornata and is a type of baked ricotta that is very dry. It is grated on top of the pasta as a garnish similar to parmesan or romano cheese. It makes a big difference if you can find it.

A very simple yet flavorful recipe.

I'm back! I made the recipe today. I made it with just one addition - I added pine nuts - I put them in with the garlic before adding the tomatoes. I made it for a g/f & I and served it at room temp - she ate 2 large helpings!!! This recipe is the BEST. Isn't there a 5 star catelgory?

I'm writing this for my sister who doesn't have a PC but has made this recipe countless times. It's a big hit when she takes it to share with co-workers. It's a tried & true favorite! Finding Ricotta Salata was difficult here in the south but I requested it from one store & now can find it more places. I'm about to make it with home grown Asian eggplants from my garden. Mmmm Mmmm good!

THis is one of my all time favorite pasta recipes. I panicked when I realized my Gourmets were in storage (we are in transition), but remembered Epicurious!

I couldn't find Asian eggplant or ricotta salata, so used regular of each. Also, didn't fry the eggplant, just sauteed it. I needed to use some left over roasted chicken breasts, so I sliced these up and added at the end. The chicken made it a very hearty and delicious meal.

Very good. My Italian guests liked very much. I couldn't find Asian eggplants, so I sliced regular eggplants into small pieces. Also, I wasn't crazy about frying. I think I'll do them next time in a non-stick pan w/Pam. They still should brown, and then I'll avoid the frying.

One of my favorite recipes. I was not able to find ricotta salata for a long time so I substituted regular ricotta. It's a very different cheese but was still tasty in this dish.

Very fresh tasting. I added more than the recipe said b/c I am a big cheese lover but ricotta salata doesn't melt, so a little does go a long way.

Pure, simple flavors. Nice.

Simplicity itself.Not a bit of grease.The secret to greaseless frying is to be sure the oil is hot enough: the food has to sizzle the second it hits the pan; and thorough draining on paper towels afterwards.

Another excellent Sicilian recipe. 'tis very authentic. This dish, Pasta all Norma, is an institution in Sicily. I often ate on the island once a day. i would not substitue feta(a greek and balkan cheese) for the ricotta salata. you lose the authenticity of flavor. if necessity dictates that you substitue...a good romano will work. as for the complaints about the aubergines being too greasy. my question would be, "did you drain them of water?" prior to cooking, slice them and sprinkle salt on each slice. cover with a paper towel and wait for 30 mintues. the water and bitter flavors wll be drained and they're ability to soak excessive oil diminished.

The eggplant can tend to be greasy. To cut down on the grease and extra calories I brush the eggplant with oil and bake it. Delicious

I love this dish for its flavor and limited ingredients. I have been able to find the ricotta salata, but think the feta would taste great too--the recipe is not too cheesy, so if you like cheese, I would add more or go for a stronger cheese like the feta.

simple to make, flavors are balanced and not heavy , I would not change any element (though by necessity I substituted feta for ricotta salata) this is an excellent accompaniment to grilled meat, w/ sauteed spinach on the side. Guests and I loved it, and the recipe was shared after the weekend

This was an easy dish to make. However, I found that the eggplant could of been a little more texture, and it could of had a little more flavor. A cheese mixture on the pasta would have added a nice extra touch. It is a recipe that can allow for alot of different varitions, to suit fortaste buds.

I didn't like this recipe, because the eggplant just absorbed all the oil and the dish was very greasy.

We had this dish for lunch today and it was delicious! As I could not find the ricotta cheese, I substituted Feta with Basil and Tomatoes. This will be a keeper at our house.
