The sauce was a bit heavy but the tastes of the entire combination was excellent and I will made it again. It was a big hit with my guests.

I have made this recipe several times and give it a three-fork rating. My dinner guests have loved it, and have asked for it again and again.

On checking the "More on this recipe" column, I noted that the recipe had a 3-fork rating and that 100% would make it again. On reading the one review of this recipe, I noted that the reviewer gave the recipe 1 fork and said that he/she didn't "deem it worth the effort." Hardly consistent. Nonetheless, I made the recipe using only 2 eggs in the Gribiche Sauce and giving the asparagus an ice bath after boiling it for less than 5 minutes. The sauce was still a bit heavy, but I will try it again because the combination of asparagus and salmon is a good one.

The gribiche is less like tartar sauce and more like egg salad, which totally dominated the asparagus and smoked salmon. Not that it tasted awful, but the flavors didn't complement one another and I deem this recipe not worth the effort.
