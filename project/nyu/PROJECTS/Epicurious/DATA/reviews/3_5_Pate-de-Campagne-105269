Pork liver was never so tasty. The only change I made was to add a little cognac. I served it with dijon mustard, cold boiled potatoes, sliced radishes and cornichons. I will definitely make this again.

So disappointing - very bland. I added extra dried thyme and some sherry but still not tasty enough. The texture was nice and easy to slice.

I also added fatty veal breast, oxtail meat, brandy, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and eggs. The result was FABULOUS -- just like the superbly flavored house pate de campagne from your favorite French restaurant. It had the right level of chunky testure, but at the same time, was smooth, easy to slice, and did not crumble. My husband (who was sceptical throughout the long process) ate nearly half the terrine when I served it. I note from a previous -- failed -- experiment, that the key to great pate or terrine is finely chopping the meat by hand, rather than putting it through the meatgrinder.

First tried exactly as per recipe. Results were very good. I have made several variations including adding veal, garlic, juniper berries etc and now make it every fortnight.
