Very nice~look beautiful. Used phyllo cups; pastry bag makes it so easy.

definitely easy and light. I would absolutely double the cream recipe if using actual phyllo sheets. if using phyllo cups (pre-made) then the regular recipe works perfectly.

Excellent. Would not change a thing..except that 375 in my oven gave me burnt caramel in 10 minutes, 5 to 6 minutes to what I thought was right. Resist the temptation to modify the first time.. do it later if you want, but the pure taste of sweet/tart raspberries, the lemon cream and slight carmelization of the sugar was just to die for.

This is a wonderful dessert. I used a pastry bag to dole out the cream and it created a very neat and beautiful look. I also used strawberry slices which was truly enjoyable. If you can find real lemon curd (which I had a hard time finding a non-dairy one) you can use a good quality lemon pie filling which was also delicious.

I made this recipe for a family function and everyone loved it. There were six of us so I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. Very lemony! I grated chocolate over the top for a finishing touch!

I used the pre-made phyllo cups instead of making the napoleon. Just add a teaspoon of the lemon cream in each cup and garnish with raspberries and blueberries. Doesn't make the mess and you can just pop them in your mouth!

Made this for a 4th of July party for 15 people, and used both blueberries and raspberries. Rave reviews!!! (Everyone wanted more.)Definately double the cream recipe, and I cut down on the vanilla just a tad. Topped with a dollop of cream and fresh berries. Makes a mess, but well worth the effort.

Great taste and great presentation. However, I would definately make double the lemon cream, I made the above recipe for four and it was not too much by any means (just didnt make as many phyllo wafers). As previous reviewer notes; watch phyllo wafers very carefully, they do not need 10 minutes of cook time. As for prepping the napoleons 8 hours ahead, I wouldnt do it more than 4 hours, the phyllo does get a bit mushy if left longer. Sounds very critical, but really a lovely dessert with a few easily correctable recipe steps.

I made this dish for 200+ people--served each table of 10 a half-sheet sized napoleon. Everyone loved it. Use at least double the lemon curd for extra favor. Great dessert and easy to make.

This dish was wonderfully easy. I added 1/2 tsp. each of cardomon and corriander to 1/2 cup of sugar to sprinkle over the buttered phyllo layers. With what remained, I dusted the serving plates. A big hit.

Have made many times!! I use double the amount of lemon curd - gives it great zing! Also, the phyllo does not hold up well in the 'fridge. You're much better to assemble at the last minute - this way the phyllo is crispy.

Made it twice -- quite pretty and delicate each time (not to mention tasty). Careful to burn the sugar coating on the phyllo for I ruined a bunch that way at the start.

Lemon cream is a big hit and so easy with purchased lemon curd. Lemon cream also works well in phyllo cups topped with raspberries.
