This recipe was almost what I was looking for. I added only half the amount of orange juice and substituted chicken stock for the rest, but the orange flavor still came through too strongly for me. I added garlic but pretty much kept the rest of the recipe the same. I think some chopped cilantro would make this dish even better. Pretty good but not great.

Although this recipe is meant to be a side dish at a barbecue, I prepared it as a main dish for my husband and I. I served cornbread along with it. We enjoyed the flavor of the chipotle chile as well as the added carmelized onions. The chiles added just enough heat. If you don't like spicy food, leave this out. If you do like things a little on the warm side, add more than the one tablespoon called for in the recipe.
