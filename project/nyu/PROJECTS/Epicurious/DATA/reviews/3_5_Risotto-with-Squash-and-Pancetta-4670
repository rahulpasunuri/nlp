Loved it. went the traditional route adding wine to the rice separately before the broth to layer flavors. Roasted butternut squash like another reviewer recommended and even tossed in a few red pepper flakes for good luck

This was fantastic! I had delicata squash on hand, so I used that instead. My kids and husband all went for seconds. Easy, cheap, and very good.

We really liked this. I roasted the cut squash while I was chopping and cooking bacon, onion, etc. I added 2 cloves garlic. I also added frozen peas at end and really liked the color and texture. No butter needed at the end.

Turned out great ... I sauteed quickly pan fried some shrimp and added to the risotto at the end for a fabulous meal!

This would have gotten four forks except that the squash never got soft enough the first time I made it. The second time, I cut up the squash, coated it with olive oil, sprinkled salt and pepper, and baked it for about 20 minutes at 450 degrees. I then added it towards the end so that it wouldn't break apart too much. Excellent! Also, I find that risotto is so creamy in and of itself that the extra butter is really not necessary.

Made this with some peas thrown in and pumpkin. It's pretty good, though I added a good bit of salt to it afterwards. Or Parmesan. Overall nice delicate flavor.

Simply put...wonderful!

I like the idea of this recipe because I like to cook with seasonal ingredients. I agree with some people, however, that it could use a little something. I would suggest using some fresh sage, or perhaps a tiny bit of blue cheese, like other people have suggested. Also, I would not recommend adding the wine to the broth--when making risotto, the wine is supposed to added after the rice is sauteed, and after the wine has evaporated, then you begin to add the broth/stock.

This has become a cool-weather staple for me. After Labor day my pantry is never without a butternut, onion and arborio. I've used both pancetta and thick cut breakfast bacon. Both are terrific, but the bacon packs more of a smokey punch, which I happen to prefer. For guests, though, I'd go with the more delicate pancetta. I cut the recipe in half when it's just me, and there's enough for two dinners. I freeze any leftover squash cubes. A suggestion: don't over-sautee the squash because you're worried about it being underdone. If your cubes are the right size, they'll come out perfectly. You don't want them so mushy that they fall apart. And, of course, always add way more cheese than in called for!

This was a superb blend of flavors, and very simple - I used frozen squash. I only added two things: I added 2 tsp dehydrated orange peel to the broth mixture and a pinch of ground nutmeg to the dish; I think these really brightened the dish and helped it not be so "heavy". I would NOT substitute regular bacon for pancetta. I also have to limit onions to just a tiny bit, but it still had plenty of flavor. I didn't think it needed any more than the 2T of parm at the end, and I think I would use only 1T of butter next time, because I don't need extra fat/calories. I think it could serve 5 as a main dish, but I will warn that although the taste holds up well reheated, it does get a bit gummy. Otherwise, it's a four-fork dish!

This was my first ever attempt at risotto and it turned out lovely. I took the advice of another poster and added some fresh sage, which complemented the flavors nicely. Used Trader Joe's packaged squash and needed to cut each square chunk into six smaller chunks so that they would cook at the same speed as the risotto. We had this with Leg of Lamb and homemade mint sauce for Thanksgiving. Wonderful mother-daughter bonding experience! (It needs more wine now! No, it doesn't, keep stirring!)

Butternut squash is perfect for a cool fall evening, although, this recipe was a bit disappointing. I made the recipe as is and felt that the final dish was a bit tasteless.

As is, it is a nice, easy, tasty recipe for the 2 of us. If I were to serve it for company, however, I'd probably add some depth with blue cheese or something like that. But again, great for a quick easy meal.

It was very easy using Trader Joe's pre-cut chunks of squash. They were bigger than 1/2" so every once in awhile, after adding the broth, I put the lid on to cook the squash. I didn't have pancetta so I used some black forest ham but it gave it too sweet a taste. I definitely want to try it again with the saltier, smokier flavor of pancetta.

Fabulous dish. Pancetta is hard to find here, so I substituted proscuitto, which paired beautifully with the squash. The result was so delicious - rich but light, it tasted of summer and winter all at the same time. This one is a keeper!

With all of the rave reviews, and as a huge fan of risotto, I was very surprised how "blah" I found this recipe. There was not any depth of flavor, and the color of the dish was not very appealig,

This was a wonderfully warm, creamy and pleasing mid-week meal for my family. I liked it so much tha I made it again over the weekend, served as a side next to grilled pork. I was cooking for a crown,so I doubled the recipe -- a bit tricky, especially when stirring, but end result was just as good as the mid-week version. Even my 3 year-old likes it! And hey, if a cook from Italy (near Alba to be exact) endorses it, you know it must be good! A fall keeper!

I live 50 km from Alba and this is one of my favourite traditional recipes! Very nice to see it here. Try it as described and you will love it!

Tried it with Canadian bacon, but I really think it would be better with pancetta. Next time, I'll try harder to get it. Added more wine (so less broth) and I worked in some chopped fresh sage which really added a nice layer.

I made this dish substituting chopped bacon for the pancetta and found that there was a strong bacon flavor, so I might cut it down by a quarter next time. I served it with the pork medallions with dried cherry sauce, also from epicurious, and people kept asking for more sauce for their rice.

Creamy and ever so elegant, rissoto is one dish that turns out better at home than it does in four star Italian restaurants. One member of my dinner party thought the sqash was a bit "crunchy". I would consider pre- baking the squash to allow it to soften first when I repeat this recipe. Pancetta is delicate and subtle and makes this a tour de force. Bacon would be too smoky for my taste. Canadian bacon would probably work well if pancetta were not available.

We had some sweet potatoes left after Thanksgiving and decided to make this recipe using this in place of squash together with a little extra wine and parmasan. It's excellent!!!

I gave this recipe only 2 forks, because as it stands it is a little bland. But I made it again last night with some modifications and WOW - what a difference. Try Canadian Bacon instead of pancetta, red wine instead of white, a bit more onion and definitely more parmesan. A VERY hearty meal - as much a "comfort" food as risotto can be.

This is an absolutely great dish that I make several times each winter. I use butternut squash, and since I cannot find pancetta in Shreveport, I substitute Canadian bacon, which blends nicely with the squash and gives it a wonderful flavor. I am planning to make it again this weekend - the first time this fall - and can't wait!

All I can say is yum! Worth the search to get real Pancetta, but good old American bacon would be just fine.
