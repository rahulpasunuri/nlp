I used canned beans and to avoid the mush issue that one reviewer mentioned, I first sauted diced onions and half a fennel bulb diced. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the fennel and onion. Then I added a can of drained cannelli beans, but I did not mash any of the beans. I made the rest of the recipe according to the instructions, except that I added quartered grape tomatoes and lemon juice with salt to the uncooked arugula.

used watercress, not arugula and it was delicious. fennel is subtle on the fish and works quite well.

i ALSO USED SPINACH AND UPPED THE FENNEL AND WAS A BIG HIT. RESTAURANT QUALITY PRESENTATION.

Horrible, horrible, horrible! Okay, I'm sure it would have been a bit better if I had used dried beans instead of canned (canned just turned into mush), but the flavors just were'nt right. The bean salad went in the trash.

Really much enjoyed it, easy to make, nutritious and above all delicious. But to be honest, I used canned beans...and cannellinis not great northerns, and about 5 times the garlic called for. With peeled garlic always on hand, it took less than 10 minutes to prepare. Enjoy

Great Beach dish. Do the beans earlier in the day and then just reheat and add the greens. You can grill asparagus as a side and you're good to go.

Very good and very easy.
