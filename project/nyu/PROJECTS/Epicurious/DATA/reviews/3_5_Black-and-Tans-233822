These cookies were fantastic and having even the very slightest experience with baking is all it takes to get a "rollable" dough... I found this recipe both easy to make and a HUGE hit with everyone who tried them... I can see why this baker was the Cook the Cover winner!

My drop cookies turned out horribly malformed, but I enjoyed both icings with the cake-yness of the cookie. Will make these again though I may try piping the dough to try and get round cookies.

I do not agree with the previous review. I did not "roll" the dough. I dropped it in small balls on a cookie sheet. The cake dough was fantastic. The recipe did not make that many cookies (only about 23 small ones with excess frosting). These were a big hit. The peanut butter frosting is fantastic. The frosting was more of a frosting and less of the glaze that is on most black and white cookies. I thought that this recipe was pretty easy to make.

What a disappointment--my mistake for trying a recipe with just a few reviews. The dough--with its buttermilk--was more like a biscuit dough. No big deal, except that it wouldn't 'roll' and didn't make nice round cookies (important for the aesthetic of a half & half style cookie.) A regular chillable, rollable cookie dough would have worked so much better. The frostings were fine, except the peanut butter was SO sweet. Why would sweet peanut butter and unsweetened chocolate frosting call for the same amount of sugar? This step seemed to be made for simplicity instead of taste. The cookies were a pain in the a@@ to frost, took double the time of regular cookies, and didn't look all that pretty in the end (even the Epicurious picture doesn't 'wow'). In the end, A LOT of work/bowls/frosting for a so-so cookie. Both frostings were tasty and (with a bit less sugar) would be each be great on their own on anther cookie or cupcake. A fudgy chocolate cookie with the peanut frosting, or vice versa, would be very good. If you must make the cookies, follow the other reviewer's advice and double the dough--I made a double batch and was still up to my elbows in frosting.

Dare I say it? The black and white has been replaced in my cookie jar by the black and tan! What a perfect combination and perfectly easy to make!!

These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe and ended up with a lot of extra frosting. Next time, I'll double the cookie recipe. I'll definitely make them again.
