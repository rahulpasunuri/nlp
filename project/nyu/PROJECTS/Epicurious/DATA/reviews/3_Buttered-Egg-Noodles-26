I have made this recipe forever. I always add fresh minced parsley and paprika for color. Yummy.

Incredible. At first I was a little nervous of pairing the strong flavor of butter with the delicate sensibilities of the egg noodle. But my husband has been urging me to get a little bolder in my cooking, so I tried it. What a hit! The whole family now requests it for every birthday and special occasion, and have begun to refer to me as "Chef Mom"!!!! Still haven't worked up the courage to add the poppy seeds. Maybe for Thanksgiving.

It's just an old classic that doesn't really need a recipe, but wonderful to have a reminder to make it. Great with fricasseed chicken.

This dish is perfect if you don't have a lot of time to make dinner. I used it as a side with bbq chicken and corn on the cob. Even my 19 month old loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

I love buttered egg noodles, but the poppy seeds tasted odd with them.

this dish worked well as a tasty accompaniment to my butter herbed salmon served with pearl onions and peas. it was light enough not to interfere with the strong flavor of the salmon, but buttery enough to be appreciated. i recommend it as a side dish for flavorful main courses.
