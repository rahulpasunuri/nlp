Made this for a dinner party and received raves! Very easy to make. Ran short on time and just skipped the lattice altogether. Decorated with a bit of sweetened marscapone -- yummy!

This recipe is very tasty, but time-consuming. If you are a wonderful pastry chef, the crisscrossing should be easy. I've made this twice and each time don't think its very pretty. Would also recommend cutouts on top rather than a lattice. More creative.

Super rich! It defintely needed some ice cream or something to cut the richness. This is a great recipe to make in the winter when fresh fruit is not as available. I loved the anise seeds in the crust. The lattice crust is beautiful. A friend thought it was store-bought!

I love figs, and this recipie really supprised me! I have only made it twice, but it keeps sticking in my mind and I just remember the flavors and textures so very well! The marsala really adds a nice sweet touch to the whole recipie! It is good for cold weather and it isnt too hard to prepare or keep!

I feel like i am grading this too hard, but there is no 2.5 and a 3 is for something that is very good! I thought that it was allright. It did look very nice. I think i might have evaporated too much of the liquid, it seemed a little dry. If you like figs you will love this!

I have made this crostata 4 times since the recipe was published. Everyone loves it, even those who don't think they like figs (like my husband). I especially like that you can make the filling ahead of time and that you don't have to roll out the bottom crust. The top is very easy to do and looks very professional. Can't say enough about this one!!

Perfect recipe. Was easy and turned out great. Unfortunately my husband doesn't like figs so i won't be making it again for him! Turned out beautiful.
