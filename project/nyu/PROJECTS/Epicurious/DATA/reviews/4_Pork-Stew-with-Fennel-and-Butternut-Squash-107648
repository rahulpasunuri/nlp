I have made this more than once, and followed the recipe as written, other than cooking the pork a little longer before adding the squash and fennel. It is delicious!! Mine comes out with a much richer color than the photo on the recipe. Try it, you'll love it!

the flavor of the sauce was amazing - i made it with bacon instead of pancetta. i served it with mash but yeah noodles would be better to mop up all the sauce. definitely worth repeating.

This is really good. I cut the recipe in half and made three minor adjustments. First, I couldn't find squash so used sweet potato. Second, I accidentally added paprika when I meant to put in cayenne. I also added the cayenne. Third, I cooked it on the stove top instead of in the oven. I served it over buttered noodles. It's so nice and warming. The flavors are awesome.

So tasty! I made the recipe as directed except I only used a few slices of pancetta. The most difficult part is trimming the pork from the bone... but there's something very satifying about chopping huge hunks of meat into cubes. :-) The first time I made the stew I roasted the squash separately and added in at the end and the second time I just added the raw squash in at the end. I prefer roasting the squash separately. May be a little salty for people who are very salt sensitive, but I thought it was perfect. I served with Kale and no additional starch/carb... think it's heart enough to eat alone. Delicious

I've tried two recipes from epicurious with pork and fennel. Of the two, this one was far better. Didn't have pancetta so I used regular bacon; couldn't find the cayenne so I used ground chipotle pepper. Result was fabulous. Will be making this one again.

This is a super easy and the ingredients are cheap. This is the perfect recipie to make on a busy day. I used Bratwerst and simmered it with beer, added granny smith apples and cherries-then I transfered it to the center of the squash. I did not use nutmeg or sage-instead, I used Herbs de Provence.

I'm pretty salt sensitive, so the two teaspoons really threw me. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I only used 1 and a half, and wished I kept it down to 1. I ended up adding two cubed potatoes after checking the broth and finding it too salty. That worked well - it was yummy!

I'm looking at all of these reviews--almost no one is reviewing the stew AS WRITTEN. Adding apricot jam, leaving out the fennel or the wine, changing the spices? Come on, rate the recipe as read before making changes. I rarely leave a recipe alone. I may make it as written the first time, but never again. In this case, this is my family's absolute favorite dish, and I love to serve it for dinner parties in the winter. The ONLY change I'd make is to watch the timing of when you add the squash, and to expect it to need an additional 45 minutes to an hour to cook. This recipe is amazing. Try it as written before you mess with it.

A friend made this last weekend. He did it in a slow cooker, but without the fennel. He also roasted the squash separately and added it in at the end. It was amazing.

I made this for relatives visiting from the East Coast. Fennel and butternut squash scared them (not adventurous eaters to say the least). But they tried it and loved it. The only adjustments I made was to slice the fennel instead of cubes (made it more substantial), and did not add the butternut squash unti last 15 minutes of cooking so as not to get mushy. Also, skipped the fennel fronds altogether.

This was delicious! It took an hour longer to cook than specified in the recipe. It could have used just a bit more spice, you could up the amounts a bit. It's a keeper.

Great fall comfort food, had a pork loin so I braised it for 6 hrs at 200, roasted the vegetables, included a sweet potato. The added roasted squash, fennel & sweet potato and simmered 30 minutes before thickening.

Great depth of flavor, may have used a bit to much cayenne but the subtle heat was perfect. Made this 2 months ago, and amazed the ultimate foodies, took some frozen leftovers out of the freezer and served it with a pastie- unbelievable. What a great way to compliment butternut squash & fennel!

I thought this was tasty. The 2 fennel bulbs were puny at the market, so having no choice I had toss in some french green beans to make 5 cups. Tossing in the fennel, beans and squash 30 mins prior to removing from oven was not a problem for me. The squash was tender and not overdone and the fennel stayed a bit crunchy. (Maybe it was because I cut them larger.) I'll make this again.

This stew was a hit with my dominoes group. I did cut the cayenne to 1/4 of the recipe amount, and wish that I had waited to add the squash until later, as was suggested by several reviewers. It did not fall apart, but was a bit too mushy. Boston butt does not seem to be a pork cut that is recognized in Denver, so I ended up using a bone-in pork roast of unknown variety. I have to admit that I did not reduce the sauce because I was running out of time. However, the dish was not excessively juicy. The chopped fennel fronds were more irritating than flavorful, and I will omit them next time. The recipe made a huge amount of stew, which luckily is even more delicious when re-heated. It served eight women and I had almost half the amount left. I will make this again, in a smaller amount. I may add some barley.

I bought some pork shoulder blade ribs on sale, without a plan for them--this was the perfect recipe. Only one of the ribs had a bone in it, which helped. I had only one fennel bulb, so I added some carrots and green beans. Adjusted the spices a bit--doubled the garlic and ginger, added one teaspoon of ground fennel, and halved the cayenne, which resulted in the perfect level of spiciness for me. I didn't have pancetta, so used bacon, and it rendered enough fat to brown the meat. The advice on waiting to add the squash is right on. 15 to 20 minutes is enough oven time for it. After removing the stew from the oven and all the solids from the pan, I just thickened the broth with some flour mixed in water. I must say that the result was absolutely delicious--very flavorful--perfect for a frigid winter day in Michigan. I didn't do the noodles, just ate it as a stew. I like my variation, so would probably do something similar next time, but this lends itself to the addition of whatever vegetables sound good to you, or that you need to use up. My only complaint about this recipe is the number of dishes you have to use in the cooking process. It is a bit time-consuming, but most stews that are beyond basic are. Well worth the dishes and the time.

Made with a few alterations. 1) Used no red wine (didn't have any on hand) - would have been just fine with it, I think. 2) After tossing the pork in the spices, I tossed it with about 1/3 c apricot jam. Coated evenly, before browning (it made the browning faster, but added a great sweet / sour flavor to the stew). 3) Added about 1/4c dried cherries at the same time as the fennel. Again, I was trying to round out the flavor profile with a little more sweet and sour. I noticed: the liquid content seemed a bit high, even without the 1c of wine. I made more-or-less a full recipe (slightly less meat, slightly more squash). It looked okay to start, but in the end, it was slightly on the watery side. I'd reduce it to 1c of stock, I think. The tomatoes in particular contributed a lot to the liquids. Overall: A very excellent stew. Lots of nice subtle flavoring, and a good balance of sweet / salty / sour / spicy. The nutmeg, ginger, and cayenne really worked well in conjunction with everything else. Pork was Very Tender (used a weird cut of "butcher-screwed-up" pork shoulder that was super-cheap because it looked like they were trying to make shoulder into loin chops, so it was pretty marbled). Served over egg noodles.

This was just so-so and actually rather bland, so I wouldn't make it again. I used pork loin, which may have been the problem (not enough fat to add flavor). Even after a few days in the fridge, it was still missing something; I tried adding dried fennel, more salt, more broth; finally drizzled a good quality olive oil before serving, which at least added added some flavor. Pretty disappointing overall.

Wonderful! I trimmed most of the fat off the pork and it was still incredibly tender and flavorful. And I have lots (and lots) to freeze!

This was a very good stew but next time I'll cut back on the cayenne. I added diced potatoes which made it even heartier. I used a pork loin but though it turned out a little dry so next time I'll use pork butt. Makes a ton and freezes well!

Made with boneless prok loin & bacon (avoided a trip to the store). This recipe will feed a small army & the fennel was amazing. A bit time consuming, but a great dish for a cool fall weekend meal.

We loved this dinner on a fall night. Started with bone in pork chops (what was on sale this week) at fewer than 3 lbs, cut off the bone part way through, and thickened with cornstarch to serve over rice. After seconds, 4 of us left more in the pot than we ate. Great leftovers make it worth the trouble!

Excellent. But it makes far more than the six servings mentioned in the recipe. Six very hungry teenage boys might be able to polish this off, but it makes at least ten regular servings, probably more if children are present.

This is fantastic - don't change a thing! Heed the warning about overcooking the squash. It does get mushy, add it later. Best with buttered noodles. Sooo good.

I made this last week from the 2003 Bon Appetit I had saved! It is very, very good. I might add ground fennel seed to the spice mixture next time - and more liquid. If you are doing it ahead and reheating it, don't completely cook the squash or it will fall apart. It says it makes 6 servings - I had 17 cups of stew when I was done!

This is incredibly delicious. I used lean pork loin for the meat since that's what I had on hand, and wish that I had followed the recipe as written. While good, the meat was much drier than pork shoulder would have been. I did find that it took much longer to fully cook the squash than the recipe stated; instead of 30 minutes, I found that it took 45. I also didn't take the time to boil down the sauce, which made the dish more like a traditional saucy stew. Next time I will boil it down to create large chunks of goodness coated in an unbelievable sauce and serve over noodles as the recipe suggests.

Outrageously good. If you can't find pancetta, use regular bacon.

This was wonderful. I used a tenderloin, and added a few chunks of fresh ginger, but otherwise followed the recipe. My four teenagers, none of whom are fond of squash, loved it. They said it was a "make-again" and when I suggested using potatoes instead of squash next time, they all declined.

3 forks instead of 4 only because this one my own (and my version was 4 forks!!!). Its a great basis but do recommend making it a true stew. I added carrots with the onions, stewed it with bay leaves and twig of thyme, added extra can of broth and 1/2 cup more wine because I also added red bliss potatoes 10 mins before the squash and fennel. When the meat and veg were removed I added cornstarch/water mix to thicken and then seasoned accordingly. Was to die for, especially the next day after all the components had even more time to mesh. No noodles or rice since I had the potatoes. Is truly a fantastic stew (oh yeah, definitely use the shoulder pork, is fatty but do take time to get a good deal of the fat off, the remaining fat adds soooo much wonderful flavor). I imagine all can make their own variation that will turn out beautifully so feel free to play with this recipe.

Followed this recipe closely, but not exactly. I used a pork tenderloin which worked wonderfully and decreased the total cooking time. I misread the amount of fennel needed and decided not to use "20" bulbs, but only two which worked well since that is what the recipe actually calls for! Also went heavy on the butternut squash (used a whole one) and served the stew over a wild rice/brown rice blend which added a nice nuttiness and texture to a dish that already has many dimensions. We thought this dish was a fantastic fall and winter comfort food! Different, tasty, a little bit of heat. We look forward to having it again and to sharing it with friends.

My husband went crazy over this! I thought it needed spice, so I added ginger, sage, nutmeg & cayenne to the stew itself.

Really good! I made a 1/3 recipie for 2 servings with a couple well-marbled pork chops, 4 fresh tomatoes, and no pancetta. To save time, I browned the pork a bit longer at the beginning till it was almost done and added the veggies when I put it in the oven. Start to finish was about an hour and a half. I know people get worked up on this site when people (like myself) review a recipie that they've messed with, but, often, someone else has messed with it the same way I plan to, and it is great to know it turned out well anyway!

Not bad but not great. I love all the ingredients individually, but the whole was not equal to the sum of the parts - it didn't live up to expectations given the reviews. I had to add more spices than called for, and added thyme as well. Also, the Boston Butt piece of meat is well named: it is a pain in the butt to trim. If I were to do this again I'd think about buying a cut that's easier to work with.

Rating: 3
Most wouldn't want to regularly spend this much time on a stew, but this is tasty comfort food for a cold day. I added the squash a few minutes after the fennel bulbs and fronds and the squash didn't get mushy. The pork specified in the recipe is perfect. The dish is a bit greasy, and is by no means light.

Rating: 4
Not too difficult, especially if you halve the recipe. It is gigantic, though. I found half to be enough for about 6-8 servings, if served with the noodles. I used a regular cut of pork loin and followed the directions of the reviewer below who did the same, to reduce cooking time by a great deal. I found the pork to be very tender and flavorful, so I don't see the need to buy the more obscure cut and cook longer. I also used regular bacon instead of pancetta, and drained the fat off from the bacon. I did not include the stalks of the fennel--only the bulb and the fronds, since I think this is what the recipe means. I think using the fennel stalks, or not cutting the squash into the enormous pieces the recipe directs, may be what causes the mushy squash problem for some of the reviewers.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. It did take quite a lot of time, definately a weekend dish. It was a real winner with everyone! My only complaint was that it was too fatty. Next time perhaps I will trim more fat from the pork. Also, although the leftovers tasted great, the squash had turned to mush. Next time I will cook it a bit less than called for.

Very nice blend of flavors with a hint of heat from the cayenne. I modified the recipe to cook in our new pressure cooker, and though the squash became rather soft, it still was outstanding. We also served it with rice instead of noodles. Highly recommeded!

A real winner! I followed the recipe to the letter except I used homemade pork stock instead of chicken. One warning others didn't put in this made an emormous amount, more than the standard Dutch oven will hold. Be sure to start out with a cooking pot large enough to hold everything--I ended up having to switch to something bigger once the squash went in.

I had clipped this recipe from magazine so had not read reviews prior to making this (too bad!). Taste was absolutely wonderful (love pancetta) but I did have difficulties with this recipe. Next time I'll do as cook in Austin did - try this in crock pot.

At my time of life, I rarely make anything twice(So many recipes, so little time.), but for this dish I'll make an exception. Absolutely bursting with flavor! I'll stagger the addition of vegetables next time, however, adding the squash a bit later than the fennel. This is more a stragtegy to assure quality leftovers, for the squash was a little squishy on Day 2. Oh, and I used a good quality bacon instead of pricey pancetta and wouldn't hesitate to do so again.

I had a few pork chops and some butternut squash; searched epicurious and this is what I found. Great recipe. I didn't change anything EXCEPT I cooked it in the crock pot. Followed directions up until I had to put everything in the oven. Put everything in the crock pot instead, including all the veggies. Cooked on low all day long. The pork was tender, the veggies were all cooked perfectly. Great meal to come home to. Only had to cook the egg noodles.

Great recipe, great tasting stew. Not having pancetta on hand, I omitted it but I followed the rest of the recipe. In listening to previous cooks, I cut the fennel a little smaller than called for and cut the squash in very large chunks and put the squash in 10 minutes after the fennel. Everything turned out GREAT. My cooking time was 45 minutes for prep to oven, and then the cooking time. While the stew was cooking, I diced the squash and fennel so, I'm not sure why it took some cooks six hours. This is a wonderful dish that I will make many times.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I made quite a few substitutions, according to what I had on hand or could find, but don't think it changed recipe significantly: pumpkin, only 1 fennel bulb, white wine, prosciutto, and used 1.5 lbs. of boneless pork loin cutlets. Still made lots of stew, had a couple nights and leftovers for lunch. My butcher said boston butt was often used for shredded pork dishes; didn't have, so she recommended loin. By using leaner, more tender cut of meat, I could reduce cooking time by a lot. I threw vegetables in when it went in the oven and baked only about 30-45 minutes. It was great, especially over egg noodles.

Very tasty! Subbed thyme for the sage (was out) with great results...Would add fennel 45 minutes in next time as the squash was mushy by the time the fennel was cooked...great (although not a quick stew).

This was a huge hit with my husband, who called it one of the best stews I have ever made. I thought it was a bit on the spicy side, but not painfully so. The pork required a bit more time than called for to get really tender, and I wound up cooking the whole thing in the oven for perhaps an extra 45 minutes. The advantage was that the sauce cooked down without an extra step, and the meet was meltingly tender.

Wow! What flavor! Just a little info...Boston Butt now called Blade Roast in some areas. Also, no indication of what to do with Fennel stalks, so I tossed them. My cayenne is mega-hot, so I cut in half, and glad I did. Lots of spice even then. Pay attention to recipe, b/c it takes time. Started at 6 and finished at 9. Oh, well. Fed the kids pizza bagels instead :-)

This was the perfect cold Sunday project. My only issue - I don't think 25 minutes in the oven was quite long enough for the vegatable portion. Perhaps about 45 - 50 minutes and they'd be perfectly tender. Boiling down the sauce at the end makes it excellent. And if you don't think that "small" amount of cayenne looks like much - beware! A little does go a long way, so if you're sensitive to that...

This is wonderful comfort food where the flavors combine wonderfully. I used a leaner cut of pork but otherwise followed the recipe completely. When I make it next I will cut the cayenne in half, as the spiciness was too much for what was otherwise a mellow combination of flavors.
