Well, I made a couple changes-- strawberry-mint preserves instead of raspberries (didn't have any), and reduced the sugar a bit to compensate for the sugar in the jam. Used Chambord. Didn't strain the puree. Had a little leftover, added a little more lemon juice and water and drank it over ice-- it's good that way, too!

I used this as a basis for popsicles, and what was left I made into sorbet. I used watermelon and strawberries, with honey instead of cassis (it was for kids), and then added in a bit of fresh mint. I pureed it all in the cuisinart really well and didn't strain it. It was wonderful! What was left made a bit of sorbet in the ice cream maker, but I plan to do it again, double the recipe, and make all sorbet for adults.

Very easy and very good! Definately a keeper.

Yummy and so easy! I didn't have raspberries so I used strawberries. I also skipped the Framboise and just used corn syrup. I made popsicles the first time, and even my 18-month old devoured them. The second time I put the mixture in an ice cream maker and we ate it right out of the machine -- it had the texture of a sorbet. Very nice indeed.

A hit with everybody! I would cut down the sugar a little as these are quite sweet. This is a great and healthy way to get my toddler to eat watermelon. Also a good way to use up overripe or insipid watermelon.

Very good popsicles. My wife said the best she has ever had. Not difficult to make (except seeding the watermelon).

I love 'em! Very easy to make and full of flavor, not to mention cheaper than buying popsicles. I got popsicle molds from William Sonoma.
