i wanted to like this recipe. I made it for my bday cake, but it was fairly disappointing. I added the extra chocolate, coconut and rum as suggested and it was still lacking. I was hoping for something with more coconut flavor in it. This was not what i wanted.

This is excellent. I won a rum cake competition with this -- in Bermuda, where rum cake is the national dessert.

Oh ho ho, this is WONDERFUL. Recipe needs a little tweaking, but if you just play around some, it comes out nicely. I doubled the recipe and took a hint from previous reviewers, increasing the chocolate and rum. I used a 10" springform, and after the cake fell, it was about 1 1/2" thick. Very dense, very delicious!

Wonderful! I used 6 oz chocolate, doubled the rum in both the cake and the frosting, and used a 9-inch pie plate instead of a springform. Extremely moist, very fudgy, and the frosting is oh, so good! Will be making this again and again, especially on holidays.

one word--yuck! a lot of work for a not-so-good reward. i followed the recipe to a T. too much coconut and not enough chocolate. we added semi-sweet chips and melted it down in the microwave after to save it. fugggheddaboutit!

Excellent cake. I tripled the recipe, but divided it into 2 9-in spring-form cake pans, and it came out an excellent thickness. I also doubled the amount of rum in the cake, as others had suggested. Cake had excellent flavor, and the frosting was equally amazing. Everyone over loved it. I was beating the egg whites by hand, and so was unable to obtain the "stiff peaks" called for, but it still came out great.

I had a bottle of spiced rum that I was about to throw out, but then thought better of it and came looking on Epicurious for some things to do with it. This receipe -- despite some of the tepid reviews -- sounded good. I heeded people's advice (doubled the rum, used a bit extra chocolate) and I didn't use a spring form pan (used a ceramic pie dish) and the dessert came out beautifully. Served it to guests (with whipped cream, which I'd highly reccomend) and folks all liked it. Have fun cooking!

I think the cake was horrible. The cake had NO flavor. It looks like it should taste chocolatey but it has no taste. I will never make the cake again. I actually threw it in the garbage.

This cake was delicious - with some minor changes. Like other cooks, I doubled the amount of rum used. I left the flour as is and the cake turned out a perfect moist consistency. I substituted unsweetened coconut (for the sweetened) and I would recommend doing the same. Finally, I just skipped the frosting and served the cake with rum sauce (heavy cream, powdered sugar and rum to the desired thickness and taste). It was an excellent success.

ok here's a better rating than before... good combination of the coconut, chocolate, and rum. but i think the cake itself needs to be more fudge-like. frosting is excellent...

After reading Leslie's comments, I almost didn't try this cake, but I'm glad I did. As the cook from Lincoln said, there was plenty of frosting. I frosted the whole thing and sprinkled the coconut all over. It was moist and tasty and looked quite elegant. It is not a big cake - but very rich. My friends were impressed!

Very delicious and easy dessert! This makes a wonderful cake for two people, or it would be perfect for a two-table bridge party. I made it exactly as written but had enough of the icing/glaze for the top of the cake also and so I covered the whole thing with toasted coconut, but it would've been pretty just on the sides as instructed. Served with strawberries and fresh whipped cream, it made a pretty presentation. The cake, however, stands well on it's own with just a cup of coffee. Very rich and moist!

I didn't know why, after 10 years, this recipe had received no reviews.Now I know. If all the people who made this recipe had really bad results like I did, they should've written something...The cake was pretty aweful to say the least. I think the oven temperature is too high...the bottom of my cake burned, it was flat with a bland flavor. Would not recommend wasting your time. Have a rum drink instead;)
