I liked this, and made it twice but then went back to more traditional Italian version of basil & parsley w/ mozzarella, and no curry powder, using technique listed here but to avoid lumpy batter, whisk the flour into the seltzer, and that way you can also control thickness of batter. Stuffed fried zucchini blossoms are a sweet reward for growing zucchini. Italian (cocozelle) produces (surprise!) alot of male flowers, and those frugal Italians came up with wonderful way to enjoy the bounty. Harvest them in the morning and cut out stamen w/ scissors in garden or else they'll be hard to get out.

I found it a bit difficult to get the batter to stick to the blossoms. Maybe my batter was the wrong consistency or my oil was too hot. I'm certainly not an expert fryer. Otherwise they had great flavor and were unusual in that the curry was added to the batter and not stuffed inside as with most Indian style "snacks."
