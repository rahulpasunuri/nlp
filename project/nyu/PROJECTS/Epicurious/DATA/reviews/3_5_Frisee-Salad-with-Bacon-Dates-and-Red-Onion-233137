my first experience with a bacon viniegrette, and it totally rocked. The combination of ingredients is stellar. even people who swore they hated salad ate this up.

Restaurant style salad. Easy to make, but still sophisticated.

Made this with mesculun salad, omitted the walnuts, although they would offer a good crunch and flavor, too. Excellent salad!

Serves two linebackers, maybe; I made half the recipe and that was just right for the two of us. It made a lovely dress-up for a simple dinner of roasted vegetables and wild rice pilaf.

Caution, the proportions are for only 2 servings! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner & omitted the pecans & goat cheese (just because of the rich meal) and it was SO delicious & everyone enjoyed it. I used cut Belgian endive, radicchio & romaine. Costco's precooked crumbled bacon was a real time saver!
