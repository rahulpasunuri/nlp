You need to correct the recipe ingredients. It says rolled nuts and should say rolled oats. Takes 1 stick of butter

If you have an insatiable sweet- tooth these are for you! I used this recipe for the general concept, although I added WAY more marshmallows (they were open and leftover from summer smores....you know how they get). If the mixture seems too thin dont worry just keep stirring and cooking slowly, it will thicken up. If all else fails just add more peanut butter! :) These are great treats to have around, you only need 1 or 2 to cure a sweets craving...they last forvever in the fridge as well.

Mario Batali's version of this needs a bit of tweaking (she might want to stick to Italian food -- and leave the trailer trash recipes to those of us who grew up eating it). You need a whole stick of butter, instead of a half. Add a cup of Peanut butter (creamy or chunky whichever you prefer) Up the unsweetened cocoa to 9 Tablespoons. And to keep it from becoming to sweet I used unsweetened coconut and left out the marshmallows. And add more milk if you need to... I think it's easier to do this if you use a glass bowl inside a pot of simmering/boiling water (making your own double-boiler). Then simply scrape into a large bowl with the oats, coconut and vanilla already in it, and then mix together.

I followed the reciepe, but I didnt add the marshmallows or nuts. I added sunflowerseeds, some cinnamon, flax seeds, and peanut butter. I added a little bit of honey, and cous-cous as well. I had fun with this recipe, and they are delicious!

It's 3 c. rolled oats, not nuts (typo). I made these for my kids because I was looking for something with marshmallows, but they don't like them, and I can't say I blame them. I think these are headed for the trash can.

My husband loves these cookies. They have been in his family for years. I did however notice a misprint on the recipe. They state to add Oats in the directions, but do not tell you how many Oats to add. I believe it is at least 1 cup of Oats. Makes a huge difference!

The results after I combined all of the ingredients was like a sauce. I couldn't have possibly put it on a cookie sheet so I added 1/2 cup of flour and put it into small bowls. The texture by then was screwed up.

This receipe has been in my family for years. My mother learned from her mother and I from her. The coconut and mini-marshmellows is something new to me. My sister adds raisins to the receipe. Me I have used dark rum instead of the vanilla extract. Not being a coconut or marshmellow fan I jsut make them straight up.

I haven't made these yet but i would like to thank the cook from Minnesota, because my mom has been wanting these cookies for ever, and the recipe you had was the one she remembers. I can't wait to make them for her!

I'm not rating THIS recipe b/c I didn't make it- but I thought I'd tell everyone here about a really good no-bake cookie recipe. Mix 3 cups rolled oats, 1 cup chocolate chips, 1/4 cup peanut butter (optional but wonderful), and at least 2 tsp vanilla extract. Then heat 1/2 cup milk, 1 stick butter, and 2 cups sugar in a large saucepan- you will need extra room. Bring to a boil (this is where it expands) and boil for at least 2 minutes. Add this to the oat mixture and combine well, then drop onto waxed paper (or buttered parchment paper). Let cool until firm- will need to be removed with spatula but will become firm- even if it takes 5 hours. Super easy and super delicious. Add salt if you want.

This was my first attempt at no-bake cookies; perhaps I didn't know what to expect. They are tasty for sure, but not something I would give away as a holiday gift. For the home only. Fun to make with kids though.

My husband thought I should have baked these no bake cookies. Too Gooey and Messy. My son loved them. I liked the flavor not the sticky chocolate mess.

I like the addition of coconut. I used more cocoa powder (6 Tbs.) and melted the marshmallows with the first several ingredients. Turned out great!

Eh! Too sweet. I don't like no-bakes with marshmallows, I like peanut butter much more. I won't make this particular recipe again.

Ok I agree with many of you, this recipe is all wrong. I make about 12 dozen of these cookies a month and I make double batches but here is my recipe... 3c. sugar, 1/2c. milk, 8 tablespoons cocoa, 1 stick butter, melt together add 2/3c. peanut butter and 1/4 t. vanilla then drop, more chocolatey and richer with the peanutbutter...I always get raves.

I was looking for a no-bake cookie recipe without oats but couldn't find one, so I made this recipe with 3 cups chopped hazelnuts in place of the oats. Different and delicious! (Although they are more of a candy than a cookie.) If I made again I would cut the sugar a little bit as they are a little too sweet for my taste.

the recipe is all wrong... the one i have always made is totally different! why keep changing it? It's 2 cups sugar, 3 cups oats, 1 stick butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, cocoa to your taste, and if you like peanut butter through about a cup or two of that in there, and 3/4 cup of milk, just heat it enough to melt and mix everything and spoon drop it on some wax paper or foil, through it in the fridge for an hour or so and wham you got a really good cookie! not to everyone's likeing but my kids go nuts over them and so do i.

I loved thse as a kid. I thought the milk and sugar proportions were wrong so I reversed them, assuming that someone had made an error in the recipe. The finished cookie seems to be okay, but a bit "oaty." I would make it again with a bit more sugar (3/4 C.) and fewer oats.

Calling these chocolate cookies is a bit misleading - they are more like oatmeal coconut cookies with a hint of chocolate. Very weird - didn't think they would hold together at all, but they did. I find them good, but a bit sweet, but an Italian here in my office raved about them, so maybe thats just a matter of taste (and culture).

Do not make this recipe. I don't know what Irene Sax is talking about. This are standard no boil cookies that are good for lunch or family snacks but are not festive or in a gift giving class.

Cookies were disappointing, will not make again.

I am going to try these rough delicacies today. Others might want to note the ingredients: the 3 c. rolled "nuts" as listed should be 3 cups rolled oats. That's what in in the body of the recipe.
