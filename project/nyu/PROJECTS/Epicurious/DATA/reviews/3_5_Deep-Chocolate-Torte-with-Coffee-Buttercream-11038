an excellent recipe if you are willing to put the time in and use every single utensil, counter surface, pan and bowl in your kitchen. I've made this cake a few times now and always it is delicious and really special. I do not reccommend spreading the buttercream in two stages; spread it & pipe it all in one shot. And if you are unsure about buttercream preparation in general, keep your Joy of Cooking handy -- she gives really excellent detailed instructions for how to make buttercream come out just right. Take your time, the result is worth it for sure.

I made this for my friend's wedding as the groom's cake and it was a big hit. The coffee buttercream was fantastic. The cook from DC who's buttercream didn't turn out and wonders if it was the lack of a thermometer, uh YES! What did you do -guess at the temp? LOL. I also used a really good quality, slightly tart red current jelly - you do NOT want anything too sweet w/ this cake. I'm going to try cutting it in half for dinner parties, yum.

This cake was great fun to make and made an impressive presenation. The torte was delicious but the combination of its rich taste with the sweet buttercream and buttery ganache was just "too much" of good thing! I'd use the torte recipe again but would change the ganache for something rich but "lighter"...say maserated strawberries in beaten cream?!

The buttercream frosting didn't work at all. Perhaps I didn't have the right temperature because I don't own a candy thermometer. Or maybe the butter wasn't warm enough. But the frosting turned out greasy and disgusting. I threw it out and made a light, fluffy coffee-flavored seven-minute frosting (which seemed more appropriate for this very rich cake anyway) and it was delicious. The resulting cake was a big hit and my guests were very impressed. By the way, I didn't have 10x15 jelly roll pans so I used 4 9-inch round pans instead. It worked just fine even though the square area is not exactly the same in the two cases.

I hate to be the lone naysayer, but I must object to all the praise. I'm no novice baker, but the Herculian effort this took--it timed in at just under 3 hours--was far from worthwhile. The red currant jelly brightened things up a bit, but in the end it was just too much of a good thing. I did like the coffee buttercream, though, and would use it again on a simplier cake. And the presentation IS nice; but I prefer less complex chocolate recipes like a flourless chocolate torte with raspberry sauce. Complicated is not necessarily better.

I agree this is a time consuming recipe but worth the effort. I am especially pleased with coffee flavor. A little flair for presentation will make guest think you are a GOURMET cook!

Just came across this recipe again and remembered that I made it several years ago for a celebration. Though not difficult, it was among the more time-consuming cake projects. The results are well worth it. I liked the idea of being able to bake the whole cake in a single pan and then cutting it into rectangles to ultimately form the layers. Plus, the combination of chocolate (especially bittersweet) and coffee is irresistable! Try it...
