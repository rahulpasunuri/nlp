I also had the problem of too much batter for a 9" springform pan. Because of this, the top of the cheesecake was craked all over. If I had more time I would have made a caramel topping to cover the top of the cake, but alas no time. As for the taste - not really all that impressive. Really wouldn't make it again.

Great recipe, the maple syrup and pecans are a marriage made in heaven. My only problem with it was the amount of batter. It was too much for my 9 inch cake tin. The cake rose well over the edge and as a result the top was less than perfect. Next time I'll use a slightly larger tin

This is a great cheesecake.I make it often and it always comes out perfect. Use a good quality PURE maple syrup.None of that artificial stuff.
