Strong flavors should be mixed wisely to avoid ruining them as individuals. Some may prefer leaving olives out or chopping them very small and spreading them thinly. My guess is that those who didn't like this may want to substitute mayo for pesto or olive oil and a light sprinkling of italian seasonings. Try fresh spinach, fresh mozzarella or other light cheeses.

I'd probably mark this 3 forks, but my husband insisted it was exceptional. The recipe made more than I could fit in the baguette, and he also snarfed down the leftovers. Couldn't believe that he didn't remember it, even though I'd only made it once seven years ago. Of course, I made some changes: halved the mozz and salami, replaced with some good ham & provolone. Also added some good deli-made marinaded artichoke hearts, with a little of the marinade instead of mayo. I think a little sliced or diced pepperoncini or gardinieria (sp?) would be really good too. Left out the radicchio as we're not big fans, but definitely understand why its included. Arugula might be a good substitute? I also warmed in the oven for dinner. Thanks for that suggestion, as well as the artichoke. I dont really understand all the venom towards the mayo. If you dont like it, leave it out. Whats the big deal?

Has been in my recipe box forever. My go-to for picnics. Always get rave reviews from guests.

I used shredded mozzarella so combined the mayo with the meats and cheese and added the roasted pepper on top. I don't think any ingredient was overpowering. I imagine the type of salami used would dictate that. The sandwich is okay, but it doesn't compare favorably to others I fix. I had no tomato and needed to prepare a lunch sandwich quickly and this fit the bill. I used sun-dried tomato baguettes, which improved the flavor.

This was absolutely gross. Everyone who tried it hated it. Perhaps it was an off-day, but I have to stick to the opinions of the 5 people I was dining with. Do not make this if you like the taste of olives - after trying this, you never will again. The taste stays with you like a horrible nightmare!

These were as delicious as everyone says they are, and ideal train fare, to boot. The only thing is, I made them and refrigerated them the night before, and they were soggy when I went to eat them. (Maybe I didn't dry off my artichokes enough.) So next time I'm only going to make them 2-3 hours ahead and see what happens. They were still good, just a little wet.

I like to serve this sandwich as an informal dinner during the week. I wrap the sandwich in foil and let it heat in the oven so the ingredients all melt together (it seems more like a dinner warm). Buy good salami.

I finally made this after years of reading the recipe and the reviews. My suggestion is to read the reviews and follow your instincts. My guess is that if you tailor it to your tastes e.g. less meat, less mayo, then you'll come up with a tasty filling for your sandwich.

I am amazed at the previous reviewers comments. I made this sandwich for a picnic at the beach. The beach is a 1 hour drive, and we didn't eat right away, so the flavors had plenty of time to blend. I really enjoyed this sandwich. Perhaps those of you who do not like all of the salami, just cut it in half. If you like Salami and mozzarella, you will like this sandwich.

Unlike the other reviewers, I really liked this recipe and will make it again.

I was also disappointed in this recipe. I agree with the one reviewer. The salami is overwhelming and the overall taste was "off"! A terrible waste of ingredients. THUMBS DOWN!!!!

Mayo and mozzarella? No way!

This recipe was a disappointment, since I like all the individual ingredients. The salami overwhelms the mozzarella and the dressing is just wrong somehow. As a former South Jersey girl, I'll take a good old hoagie anytime.
