I used this on a pork roast that I had rested with a rub of coffee grinds, chipolte pepper, cumin, salt & pepper. The two complimented each other so well. Wonderful.

I added garlic, onion, red pepper flakes and hot sauce and used it for a recipe in a slow cooker and the results were quite good. I reduced after the pork was finished.

Love, love, LOVE this sauce! I've only used it on ribs but it's bound to be fantastic on anything. Soooo easy and delicious. My only advice is to make a double batch!

This was great for a picnic bbq I went to. I made the sauce in the morning, put sauce and chicken drumsticks in a plastic bag. Then grilled them at the bbq a few hours later. Easy and delicious - got compliments!

Very nice. Used ginger-garlic terriaki sauce in place of the soy sauce but no other changes. Poured it over pinto and black beans in the slow cooker. Yum. Can't wait to try it with pulled pork.

It's easy to make and you can put it on an old shoe and it will taste great! I suggest you reduce it to a thick sauce. It is really for steak only and of course goes best with a nice cut.

Pretty good. Nothing exceptional, but it does have a nice sweet flavor. Certainly doesn't take the place of the good bearnaise or bordelaise recipes on this site, but I will make it again.

excellent for steaks !!! I basted steaks, that I had pressed with freshly ground pepper,with this sauce during last minute of cooking. I then heated leftover sauce, added sliced green onions and served it at the table. I feel, though, that this sauce would be too "heavy" for chicken.
