Excellent -- light, fluffy, good flavor. Definitely use 9x13 pan. The topping is not necessary; it has a delicious crust without topping.

I made this cake a few nights ago with changes other reviewers suggested: Bake in a 9x12 pan (otherwise the topping and sides are too brown), double the topping to accommodate the larger pan, and toss the blueberries in flour before folding in. This is a good breakfast/brunch/snack cake with an excellent topping. Highly recommended.

I made the cake without the almond topping (used a brown sugar crumble). Added lots of vanilla, orange zest and a bit of yogurt. So good...

Easy enough to make - I had all the ingredients on hand. used only 1 cup of sugar in the cake, I like it not so sweet. For the topping, I just tossed some brown sugar and pecans together for the topping (I was feeling lazy). Baked this in a 2qt. glass dish. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes and the sides started to get really brown but the top/middle was not cooked. so I lowered the oven to 300 and cooked for another 30 minutes. the sides are very brown, but not too bad. the cake itself is moist and tasty. I would definitely cook in a larger pan next time to avoid the dark sides.

This is exceptionally delicious, moist and flavorful. I've also spooned it into muffin cups which also works wonderfully. This is a keeper!

This was an easy recipe that came out great. I didn't have almonds, so I used chopped walnuts and vanilla, which was fine. I think you could switch out the berries and nuts for others pretty easily. Also, this needed about an hour and 10 minutes to bake all the way through--it was pretty dense.

This is such a delicious and simple coffeecake! I used the almond extract, and it added such a delicate little bit of depth to the cake. I did subsitute the topping with the streusel topping from the other blueberry coffee cake recipe that is on epicurious (I wanted the cinnamon-y-ness of a standard streudel - I will double it next time. My boyfriend said it was the best coffeecake that he's ever had, and followed his statement up by eating 1/4 of the cake!

Yummy. The almond topping definitely makes this coffeecake special. Very easy to pull together, even for a novice baker like myself, and the texture is great - soft and moist.

This was a good recipe and the almond topping was delicious. I would make some slight changes next time however. Like other reviewers, I would make it in a different size pan so it would spread out more and not be so thick. Blueberries sunk to the bottom.

I made this for my husband's department BBQ. In Holland, Americans evidently have a reputation for good desserts. So I am usually asked to bring dessert and they cannot wait to see what I will bring each year. I usually bring 2 different desserts and decided to make this recipe as one of them this year. I baked it in a swirl bundt pan. I inverted it onto a serving plate, and since the topping was on the bottom, I sprinkled some powder sugar on top as decoration. It was so easy and turned out great. It was the favorite dessert at the BBQ this year, not a morsel was left. I served it with Amaretto whipped cream as garnish. My dessert reputation still stands as very good here in Holland, even though I am a far better cook than a baker!LOL!

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. I made it in a 13x9 in. pan and it baked beautifully. The coffeecake just wasn't as "fluffy" as I like; but my boyfriend took the leftovers to work and, apparently, it was devoured...so, each to his own...

Fantastic recipe - my co-workers raved about it.

Rating: 2
Decent, but not spectacular. The almond topping adds a nice toasted flavor and some crunch; otherwise it's nothing special. I agree with the reviewer who advised making a thinner cake in a larger pan - I used a 2-qt. dish and found that by the time the middle was done, the edges were a little too dry.

I made this recipe in a "deep swiss rosette 11" pan with removable bottom"--which produces a striking scalloped edge cake. It was as delicious as it was beautiful--moist, concentrated blueberry flavor, a real show stopper. The first time I made it for brunch, the second time I made it for dessert and served it with homemade frozen peach ice cream. This recipe will become part of my summer collection.

I just served this coffeecake this morning to some friends and got raves. I made it in a 9x12 pyrex and baked it for 1 hour. It was perfect. I made it with partially thawed blueberries, which I dusted with some of the flour, and I used 1-1/2 cups of almonds with the egg white and 3 Tabs of sugar. I think next time I might add a bit more almond extract. This is definitely a keeper, as it is so most (all the butter, I guess).

Rating: 4
Fabulous cake but would recommend the 13x9 inch pan for next time--just increasing the almond, egg white, sugar mixture since it fit the 8 inch square pan perfectly--but the middle of the cake didn't get done for an extra 45 minutes in the 8 inch square pan--definitely go for the wider pan and let the cake be thinner. YUM!! P.S. I noticed that a lot of people had trouble with the blueberries dropping to the bottom. Interestingly, I didn't have this problem at all, and I definitely didn't dust them with flour--the only difference is that I DID substitute CANOLA OIL for the butter that was called for in the recipe, because as much as the taste of butter is delicious, I don't want to die of a heart attack. So, when I eat cake I use oil whenever butter is called for, except for a caramelized effect or icing. As a result I probably beat the oil and the sugar longer because it doesn't exactly get fluffy like with butter. And then I really beat the batter well after each egg. That might help--and I'm very careful about "folding" in the blueberries, not stirring or mixing them in.

I made this for a brunch, and by the time I went to get a piece it was gone. Many guests went home with the recipe.

Good but not great. This is dense and heavy with okay flavor. The almond topping really makes it.I didn't like baking it in a bowl (vs a pan) because it was hard to get the tall slices out of the bowl in one nice piece. Eight servings are VERY generous. It took 1 1/2 hours to bake as compared to 1 hour.

Very easy to make. I made it twice in one weekend and brought some to the office. All loved it. If anything to add, I would double the almond topping recipe. I would also use 3 cups of blueberries, to help hold the cake. The cake is very soft.

This is a light cake that resembles dessert, rather than coffee cake. I, too, dusted the berries with 1 Tblsp. of the flour before folding in. As I usually do, I used 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1-1/4 cups of white. Due to the whole wheat, I reduced the baking powder to 1-3/4 tsp. I used 1/2 cup of pear babyfood (1 jar, 4 oz.) and 1/4 cup of butter and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. The sugar could be reduced to 1/2 cup, in my opinion. This is very good. Unfortunately, I depend on buying this delicious fruit, but Costco had a good price on 2.75 pounds and I indulged. I believe the correct pan size is 11 x 7, not, 9 x 12. I had plenty of topping.

Rating: 3
Delicious, surprisingly light and fluffy. The only thing I would say is that I didn't have enough almond topping to nicely cover the entire surface (I used a 13x9 pan). I would double the almond topping - maybe even triple it if you really like it. I also cut the sugar and found it perfect, since the topping and the blueberries are both sweet.

I made as 12 muffins instead - they were a little fragile, but nice texture, great topping.

This is fantastic with or without the topping. I got a request to make it twice in one week. I would recommend that you coat the blueberries with flour as suggested before.

I made this a few days ago... I didn't buy enough blueberries but it still turned out ok. I agree with the fact that the blueberries tend to sink to the bottom. Next time I will try the "dusting the berries with flour" trick. My co-workers seemed to enjoy it and my fiance didn't want me to take it to work. Overall, I think it was a success.

To DIE for!!! I have made this already four times in the last week! A couple of tips -- I love lots of fruit, so I used 4 C blueberries. To keep from having all the blueberries sink to the bottom, I folded in 3 C of berries, then sprinkled the remaining cup on top before putting it in the oven. If you use a 2-qt. pan, as suggested, it is tricky getting the center done without burning the topping. ONE TRICK -- I found a perfect way to get the center cooked without burning the almonds -- using an ELECTRIC oven (haven't tried this trick in a gas oven yet), bake for 40 min, then turn the oven OFF, letting the cake stay in the oven until both oven and cake are cool. Another way is to use a 13" x 9" pan, bake for 50 min., then remove from the oven. This worked even better (probably because of all the fruit I used). As for the topping, I was lazy (I mean, how do I get HALF an egg white???), so I mixed 1 whole egg white with 1/2 C sugar with a (3.5 oz.) package of sliced almonds (which came out to a little over 1 C). I have made this without the topping for my friends who dislike nuts, and it is still good (although, personally, I love the almond topping!!!).

I would say this recipe is good, but, certainly not great. I used a 13" by 9" ceramic dish and it took 40 minutes to bake. The almond topping is the best part and I will probably use it to top other cakes or muffins in the future. I had trouble unmolding the cake so I just left it in the pan. Did anyone else have this happen to them? I buttered the pan very well...any suggestions?

Special thanks to the Toronto cook for the suggestion to flour the berries. They did not sink at all!

Made this today. It was great. Even with my blueberries which had been sitting around in the refrig for a while!!!! The topping is great. I should have read the reviews before making it - I don't quite know how one goes about measuring 1/2 of an egg white either!!!! I did not use almond extract, I used vanilla instead. Baked it in a 13 by 9 pan for about 40 minutes (high altitude here in CO). Very yummy!

This is a trouble-free recipe and is wonderful with seasonal fresh berries (good with frozen too.) The topping is terrific and would be great for use on plain cookies or poundcake. I found I had to cook it for closer to 1 and a half hours rather than the time given in the recipe.

Sorry--made this today. It's just O.K., not great, at least to me.

You're never too old to learn...I didn't know that adding flour to the berries would prevent them from sinking to the lower half of the baked cake! I too used an entire egg white for the topping...Who dreams up these half-egg white ideas? Anyway, it's a good coffeecake but don't try to pass it for any other type of cake.

I don't like nuts, so I left the almonds out completely (although I did use the almond extract) and it still turned out fabulous! I used 2% milk instead of whole and it wasn't too dry. My neighbors all came poking around to see what the wonderful baking smell was!

I made this recipe today and it was very good. I didn't have the sliced almonds, only slivered, which worked out fine. I kept it in the oven for almost an hour, and it came out great. I used a pint package of blueberries, and took the previous advice and floured them first and they didn't sink to the bottom at all! I also cut the amount of sugar and it tasted wonderful. The cake really seemed to be chock full of the blueberries. Next time, I don't think I will use a whole cup of almonds, that seemed a lot to me. This was a great little surprise for my family on this Sunday morning!

Flouring the berries keeps them from sinking to the bottom. Great cake.

Really good cake. I added 1/2 block of softened cream cheese to the butter mixture for added moisture. Next time I think I'll add more blueberries on top and lightly press them into the batter because the ones that were folded in sank to the bottom. Also I didn't mix the almonds with the egg white because I don't like sticky toppings. My husband loved it!

Totally delicious. I also eliminated 1/4 cup of the sugar in the batter and it was fine. Note, however, that I used skim milk instead of whole to try to cut fat/calories. That was a mistake. I think as a result the coffeecake was kind of dry.

Mmmm! Delicious! The sweet, crunchy, almond topping really makes this cake special. Next time I think I would add a quarter cup less sugar to the batter as I find the topping makes this cake quite sweet.

Very yummy. Be sure to bake until the center is done. I was worried about burning the almonds and underbaked the center a bit.
