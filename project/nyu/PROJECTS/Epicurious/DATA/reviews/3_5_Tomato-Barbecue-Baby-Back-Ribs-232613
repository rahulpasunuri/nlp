We've made this recipe about 20 times. Sometimes we follow the recipe exactly, sometimes we make it spicier with cayenne pepper, hot sauce, etc. But most of the time we stick to the recipe. Everybody always love the ribs. Super easy and always good - can't beat that with a stick (or a rib).

Can't believe it was so easy and this good! I wouldn't change a thing!

I don't like ketchup so I used San Marzano tomatoes, peeled and seeded, sauteed the onions and garlic in EVO, then added the tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients. I let it boil for 15 minutes then simmered for 30 and then cooled and put it in the blender. Everyone loved it. I also put a rub on the ribs, pre-cooked them without the sauce for 20 minutes in the oven - then grilled and added the sauce.

Excellent! Very easy and taste just like restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly.

Easy to put together and one guest said they were the best ribs he's ever had. I added about 2/3 cup Asian Chili sauce, with a fair amount of hot to it...balanced out the sweet (which I think was totally sweet enough). I'd made these again as they were so fast and easy!

I made these for Mother's Day dinner, and everyone loved them. However, I played with the sauce a little. I had doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough for the table, bumped up the pepper by another teaspoon. This was fine for me, it had a nice kick, but I didn't think my parents would enjoy it, so I added a can of tomato puree before running it through the food processor. It gave the sauce a nice flavor, definitely tamed the heat. I'll make this again, next time follow the recipe and see how it comes out.

Filled my need for a fast rib recipe and my family's need for tasty bbq. Used spareribs, didn't puree the sauce, re-sauced upon taking off the foil. Made 80% on the grill and 20% in the oven; all agreed that the grilled ribs were superior! Served with mac & cheese, black bean & corn salad, cooked greens and an A. Rafanelli Zinfandel for a wonderful New Year's Eve meal. It was happy cooking and happy eating!

This recipe was easy but I like my ribs a little spicier. My favorite recipe is still Grilled Baby Back Ribs with Mustard Bourbon Sauce. It might work to do the spice rub from the other recipe and sauce from this one.

It definitely was easy to make but I've had better.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make and the ribs were tender. I didn't love the sauce. If you like a tomato rib then you will love it.

We love these ribs and I have made them about 4-5 times aleady, going to make them again today. They are very tender and tasty! I don't puree the sauce, just put it on as is and they are great!!! I have tried a few rib recipes but find this one the easiest and it still tastes great to us.

"They weren't really worth eating" is what my husband said. They were okay, and certainly they were easy, but nothing special. My co-workers happily snarfed the leftovers. I'll keep looking for a rib recipe.

This was great. The meat fell right off the bone. I reserved some extra sauce for dipping. The sauce was suprisingly spicy considering there's no hot pepper.

This recipe, as the description states, is not overly sweet. My husband liked it exactly this way; I might prefer a bit of extra sweetness by adding extra sugar or honey next time. Because it uses so much pepper, use only freshly ground pepper, and it won't seem like too much (as I thought it might). I pureed it as directed, but I don't see any harm in omitting that step, so I might be tempted to skip that next time! But DO use HEAVY-weight aluminum foil to line the pan. Cleanup was a bit more challenging without it b/c cooking juices still managed to go through.

It was the first baby back ribs I cooked, and it turned out fantastic! As good as /or IMO, better than ribs from good restaurants. Very easy and tasty. Meat was very very tender. I'll experiment with other barbeque sauce!

I made this for my rib loving husband and we both found it to be just so-so. The ribs were moist and tender but we didn't care for the barbecue sauce. For one thing there was too much salt and pepper.

Very delicious and easy, even with my embarassing substitutions (thought I had all the ingredients, but...). No molasses, so upped the brown sugar and used maple syrup. Malt instead of cider vinegar. Tossed in a little Trader Joe's Mole. Otherwise, followed the recipe, and it was delicious!

Great starter recipe. One thing to note: For all of you who have never done ribs without boiling first, the first hour of being covered tightly is basically the same thing. The ribs steam in order to make them more fall-of-the-bone tender. I've never really been a fan of this method, but with this recipe, I liked it. Some modifications - red pepper flakes, 1-2 chipotles (canned), with some of the adobo sauce, and I didn't puree the sauce. Pull em out of the pan, put 'em on the grill, and pour the sauce over them for the last hour. Yum!

Quite easy and just the most fabulous ribs you will ever have! Meat is tender, falls right off the bone and the sauce is deilicious!

If you like molasses, this is the recipe for you. The ribs were 'melt in your mouth tender' and full of flavor. I have never prepared them without simmering the ribs first as I was always afraid they wouldn't be tender enough, but I now know that it's not necessary. Prepared exactly as per recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

We missed a tangy taste, and wonder what to add. Smoked Spanish paprika? Chile powder? More vinegar?

I had never made tender ribs at home without a grill before this recipe. The meat truly falls away from the bone and the sauce was excellent, I made extra!

I served these ribs to 12 adults and four children. Not only were they all members of the 'clean plate' club, but they all took copies of this recipe home! Easy and fantastic! Yummola!!!

I like this recipe because it is so simple. Good ribs normally take a lot of work, but these don't. The ribs had a great flavour and were so-o-o tender. My husband--the rib expert--loved them.

I was looking for an easy oven recipe for ribs and this was terrific! Easy and delicious, and the kids loved them too. Will definitely make again.
