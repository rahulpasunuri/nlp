Adding some cut apples in place of the peppers is also a great option. Tastes good!

I suggest increasing the lemon and ginger a bit. The salad was much better on the third day, so next time I will marinate for two days. A quick and easy salad.

Made this for a picnic. Everyone loved it and it was gone pretty quickly. Added a bit more gingerroot and lemon that called for in the recipe.
