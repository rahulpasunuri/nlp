I'm pretty good at frying regular potato latkes so they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This was the second time I've made these, though, and I still think I'm doing something wrong. I can't get them crispy on the outside! What am I doing incorrectly?

Definately not as good as Beet and Carrot Pancakes. This recipe has too much egg in it and it takes away from the sweetness of the beets.

also- I meant to comment on "Alberta's" salt comment. I have a low tolerance to salt and this recipe definitely doesn't have too much salt. Maybe you used tablespoons instead of teaspoons??

These are delicious! They go well with a nice mixed green salad and some crunchy bread. If you forget to dry the beets just add some extra flour and it will still come out okay. Other salsa versions will work with this one but I'm sure the apple version is much more perfect.

This was great with the apple "salsa." I preferred the gingered carrot latkes, but these were still quite delicious.

Worth the effort, definitely make with the Gingered Carrot Latkes and the Apple, Green Onion and Jalapeno Salsa, they all add to each other. My only critique, I should have doubled the recipe.

(same review as for the carrot latkes) Wow - I made these and the carrot latkes with the relish and salsa -- they were TERRIFIC. Used food processor to grate everything, including apples for salsa; drained and squeezed dry the carrots and beets very very thoroughly (a crucial step); they were the hit of the evening, and tasted great as leftovers the next day. The salsa was much more than needed, but so good we'll enjoy trying it out as an accompaniment for other things for the rest of the week. The relish, while interesting, was unnecessary.

very good! The Apple, Green Onion & Jalapeno salsa was a great condiment with the beet latkes.

So good! Made with apple/jalepeno sauce and served with plain greek yogurt. I used 3 large beets and 1 large zucchini.

I made these following the recipe exactly. As my measuring spoons were hovering over the bowl with salt in hand I decided to follow the recipe and add all the salt it called for. It was way too much. I could tell they were delicious but couldn't get over the salt. The apple salsa was good but made a lot.

Unique and delicious. This dish comes off as really gourmet considering how easy it is!

Very tasty, for the Tom Robbins beet lovers, and others as well. Definitely make the Apple Jalapeno salsa to accompany. Very good heated up for breakfast the next day as well, so make plenty.
