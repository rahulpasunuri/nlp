Delicious! A nice versatile side dish. I added peas to mine, and I can see how mint instead of cilantro might work too. Served with roast lamb and raita. To the Cook from Chicago, brown rice takes longer to cook because bran and germ are still left on the grain.

We used the brown basmati rice called for in the recipe and followed it to the "t." Unfortunately, after the 18 minutes of simmering and the 5 minutes of standing, the rice was still far too firm. After another 15 minutes of simmering (and at least another cup of water and some additional curry powder to prevent dilution of flavor) it was finally at the density it should be. Not sure why it took so much longer, but thought others might benefit from knowing this and that it can be fixed without trauma.

We served this with grilled game hen and the duo was wonderful. We used a "hot" curry powder which gave this quite a zing. As suggested by the previous reviewer, I substituted half of the water with chicken broth. In addition I added ~1/4 tsp of grated fresh ginger, but think the recipe would have been wonderful without modifications. We served a dry Resling, which paired well.

Nice touch of curry to a meal, i substituted half of the water with chicken broth to give a little flavor which turn out great. Served with cashew crusted chicken breast served with mango and papaya salsa.
