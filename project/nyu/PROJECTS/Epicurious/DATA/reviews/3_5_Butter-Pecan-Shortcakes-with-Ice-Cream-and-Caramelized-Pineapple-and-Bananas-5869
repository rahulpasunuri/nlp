The shortcakes aren't too sweet and balance will this the fruit. I added strawberries as well and it really added a nice taste.

I agree with other reviewers -- make 8 rather than 6 shortcakes, use vanilla ice cream, and consider leaving out the pineapple. I'm generally a fan of pineapple, but it didn't blend with the other flavors (while the banana and caramel were perfect together). I, too, made the lower fat / whole wheat substitutions described below and was pleased with the results.

These shortcakes are outstanding! It is delightful to find a recipe that is as delicious in it's original form as it is in a lower fat version. For those interested, I did substitute yogurt for the sour cream, skim, for the whole milk and 1/2 the flour for whole wheat...plus a dash of wheat germ and they were incredible! My favorite way to serve shortcake is on a bed of butterscotch sauce (the one on Epicurious, with the addition of cider vinegar is exceptional), with fresh strawberries tossed with Cointreau, sugar and topped with vanilla cream ... you'll have fans! Happy cooking, may all of your recipes be great and may your trails always be successes!

This was excellent-- though I only loosely followed this recipe- substituting walnuts for pecans, brown sugar for white, using a mix of wheat and white flour, and skim milk instead of whole. I also added a sprinkling of coconut to the tops instead of sugar before baking. EXCELLENT!

I made this over the weekend and really had high expectations, but I was quite disappointed with the turn-out. The shortcakes were okay by themselves, and the fruit wasn't bad by itself, but the flavors and textures just didn't really work well together. I used fresh pineapple because I'm just generally opposed to canned, but even though it was good and ripe, the tartness just dominated the dessert too much. It had potential that might lure me into trying it again, but I'd probably make some changes to the fruit and ice cream. It might be good with warmed, spiced peaches and vanilla ice cream.

Too much trouble and too many flavors. Maybe leave out the pineapple and make the shortcakes a little smaller, say 8 instead of 6.
