I rated the cardomom biscuits as 4 (would give them a 5 if I could). I finally got around to making this shortcake recipe and it's very good and relatively simple. I do love the cardomom, but it was hard to detect in the peaches. My favorite over the biscuits is Gingered Poached Apricot and Raspberry Compote - recipe on this site.

This was an interesting dessert- my guests thought it was great, but it just didn't do it for me. I have never used cardamom b4, and maybe it just takes some getting used to.

I made this dessert for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I suggest tasting your peaches before adding the sugar -- mine were quite ripe, so I used only 1/2 cup sugar & that turned out to be just right. We ground cardamom seeds in a coffee grinder instead of using store-bought ground cardamom, and that really heightened the lovely flavor. Also, I followed another cook's suggestion & whipped the cream before adding the sour cream, and that worked out very well. I will definitely make this again!

So pretty! Loved this tasty treat! A beautiful way to showcase northwest berries and peaches. My only suggestion: the whipped cream/sour cream sauce needed time to thicken. I'd make it an hour or more ahead next time to avoid the runny consistency.

Wonder, wonderful, and again, wonderful. This is a fabulous make-ahead dessert that is sure to become one of my standards.

I have to give this four stars because it has the most wonderful flavor, especially with freshly ground cardamom, and those biscuits are to die for!! I'll try whipping the cream and folding in sour cream next time, but pretty awesome either way. YUM.

The cardamom makes the difference between this and an "ordinary" shortcake! Delicious!
