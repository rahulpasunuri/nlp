This is my original recipe from Bon Appetit, but the editors changed my frosting recipe. It should be much easier! Beat 1 cup creamy pnut butter 1 cup Hershey's chocolate syrup 1/4 cup clear Karo's syrup Do not over beat. Frost cooled cake layers. On the cake, don't use the pudding in the cake mix.

I decided to make this cake today because all of the desserts at my family's Thanksgiving are very adult and I wanted something for all the kids (including the young at heart :) I am not sure why people encountered the icing problem, but I made some proactive modifications in hopes that I wouldn't have the same experience as many other reviewers (plus I prepared this for Thanksgiving and it needs to be ready in the next two hours--nothing like the last minute!). I melted the chocolate (I used semi- sweet chocolate chips) with the syrup in a glass bowl in the microwave and gradually mixed in the peanut butter. I didn't measure exactly because it seemed that many people thought two cups of pb was too much, so I'd guess I mixed in about 1-1.5 cups. I added the confectioners sugar (a little bit less than called for--I don't like TOO sweet) and the milk (exactly 1/4 cup) and the consistency was very smooth! No problems! I hope this helps somebody. Happy Thanksgiving!

I see everyone has problems with the frosting. I have made this cake for years for lots of birthday parties - and yes, I have often used my hands to get the frosting to stay on. The temperature and humidity level of the kitchen has a lot to do with it - try chilling the frosting for a little while if your kitchen is hot and humid. It usually works better for the December birthday than it does in June. But everyone loves it so much - tastes like a Reese's peanut butter cup.

I think this recipe is a joke. The cake is great, and very simple. The icing is a disaster. I truly believe there is a typo in the recipe somewhere. We finally were able to get the icing onto the cake using our fingers and sort of molding it like clay. Someone at Epicurious really needs to take a look at this recipe and make sure everything is as it should be.

Nothing but rave reviews for this one (though I wouldn't know because they ate them ALL). Anyway... I made cupcakes but didn't make the frosting. I used half the Choc Fudge Frosting from this site minus the espresso (I didn't really follow it to the letter) and added peanut butter to a plain cream cheese frosting I had left over from some Red Velvets (RV w/berries form this site). I put both in a pastry bag a piped a swirled mix on top (more choclate than PB). Pretty! Everyone at work said it was the BEST cupcake I've made to date. Used JIF BTW.

I actually made cupcakes from this recipe, less intricate frosting technique. I also ran out of Jif so I used a little bit of natural CRUNCHY peanut butter and it worked fine. I was so surprised at how moist and airy they came out. I will definitely use them again. I love peanut butter and chocolate together. A lot of recipes are too heavy on chocolate though. This was a perfect combination!

The cake is amazing it was the best cake I've ever tasted and easy to make, but... the frosting was absolutely horrible.I am 12 yr.s old but I followed the directions exactly.I even tried to microwave it like another reviewer did .It didn't help at all. Make this cake and use your own frosting recipe!

Rating: 4
Soooo easy!!! You must use Jiffy for the best cake. I have had many many many people ask for the recipe or request that I make it for them. One friend tried Peter Pan, and they didn't like it. I make it exactly as the recipe says, and it always turns out and tastes beautifully!

This review is only for the frosting as I made it to go with another cake. It was really good, tho a bit sweet. I only put in about 1.5 cups of peanut butter. It came together beautifully after I added the milk, glossy, gooey and full of peanut butter flavor. I don't think it's quite firm enough to use as a filling for a sandwich cake, but great as a topping for a sheet cake!

I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to my favorite yellow cake recipe, and the result was the lightest most beautiful cake I've ever made from scratch. It was wonderful. However the frosting was ridiculously bad. The cake was much to tender to support the frosting and the result was a mess. Next time, I'll make this as a sheet cake, but I'll never use the frosting recipe again.

The cake was delicious! Though, I too had problems with the frosting. If it matters, I used Peter Pan creamy peanut butter. When I mixed in the powdered sugar and milk it sort of seperated. When I ended up doing was putting the frosting into a heavy saucepan and heating it, very slowly. I drained out the liquid (which was mostly oil from the peanut butter). Once the frosting was smooth and glossy, I frosted the cake. It was not like regular frosting, it didn't stick to the cake. Ended up spreading it over the cake and it formed a thick, fudge like coating. Everyone loved it.

I usually do not use cake mixes, but this cake is great. I have made it several times for birthdays in my office and several people have requested this cake. Very easy. No one believes that it is a cake mix cake.

This cake was delicious and my whole family loved it! I even used the peanuts to make a decoration on the cake. Even my brother, the picky eater, loved it! It was very easy to make. I had to melt the chocolate in the microwave to make it easier to spread. I would recommend this cake for any occassion. If your like me, I bake for no reason, then you would love this recipe.

Very easy to make and not a lot of ingredients. Perfect for the office potluck or a child's birthday party. Everyone loved the peanut butter/chocolate theme and no one suspected that I used a cake mix.

I've been looking for a recipe like this since high school, when my friend's mom- a professional baker- made this for several special occassions. This is is less gourmet but just fine. I microwave the chocolate with lite chocolate syrup and it actually turns out great and spreadable. I only use half the icing usually.

Everyone in my office loved this cake, my husband included. I fudged a bit using a large dolop of old fashioned peanut butter (crunchy) to make the icing, I dident purchase enough smooth to complete the recipe. But it worked out great with extra peanuts in the icing. I needed to warm the icing in the microwave to make it easier to spread.

The frosting is really good and sweet! I started with one cup of peanut butter, the rest of the ingredients, and then added a little more peanut butter until it looked spreadable. I didn't have any problems with it. I made the peanut butter cake and also a chocolate cake (from a box--gasp!) and then layered them together. It is pretty and really quite delicious. And yes, I can tell it's a boxed cake but who cares? It is what it is. (and it's good!)

I don't want to give this recipe forks b/c I altered it slightly. If I were to give it forks based on my alteration, it would be 3. After reading about other people's problems with the frosting I decided to leave a cup of the peanut butter out of the recipe. It came out PERFECT! Creamy, spreadable and very much like a peanut butter cup!I will definitely be making my altered frosting and the cake in the future.

To the "cook" below from San Francisco, CA...I think you should be giving all the credit to Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines. No one believed that you "made it yourself" because you really didn't! Adding oil and water to a box full of chemicals doesn't constitute making a cake from scratch. Gourmet and Bon Appetit need to banish such "recipes" from their magazines and Web site. YUCK!!!

Fabulous cake! I made it for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and didn't have any problems, whatsoever. The frosting was perfect and creamy and easy to spread. I also put the peanut butter cups around the bottom and it looked beautiful. People didn't think I made it myself. A definite keeper!

I made the icing - not the cake - and had no problems with it spreading or sticking. I did put a layer of Wilson icing down first and put the peanut butter icing through an icing bag - it looks pretty good...tastes good too...

This cake has become a perrenial favorite in our home. It is the most requested birthday cake by kids and adults alike. It definitely tastes best after "settling" for a half day or so. It also tastes wonderful accompanied by vanilla ice cream.

i made these into cupcakes instead of a cake. i was really looking forward to a "sticky" frosting, but instead it was actually non-stick (from the oil in the peanut butter) and doughy, like previous reviewers said. even after i added more milk, i was able to literally peel the frosting off cleanly from a cupcake, so i added even more milk, which made it more frosting-like. i found that the peanut butter in the frosting overwhelmed the chocolate. so if you REALLY like peanut butter, you'll love this recipe.

I am a major chocolate/peanut butter lover, so I couldn't wait to try this one. Man, was I disappointed. The cake doesn't have enough flavor to warrant the its heaviness and richness. I used really good chocolate, and couldn't taste it. The texture of the frosting is too thick and fudgy to stick to the cake. It also doesn't blend well with the cake in your mouth, so the cake seems dry and bland, lacking enough peanut flavor.

Spectacular cake! I made this for my husband's birthday party, and he and our guests were very pleased. I did not use a cake mix, but followed an extremely easy Yellow Cake recipe that appears in the current issue of Gourmet Magazine (August 2002). If you have the time, PLEASE try making your own cake; it's very rewarding and it tastes so much better than something that comes out of a box. I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter to the batter, which produced a very light, spongy cake. It is so delicious! It tasted like a peanut butter cup, only so much better! I had no problems with the icing; had to adjust here and there, but the end result was very smooth and easy to spread. The peanut butter flavor of both the cake and the icing was just right! I will most definitely make this again!

This cake is not for the faint of heart, but it will satisfy the most incredible peanut butter/chocoholics' sweet tooth! This is my husband's new favorite birthday cake (which I originally selected because he adores Reeses peanut butter cups). I've made this numerous times and agree that adding milk as needed to the icing helps make it spreadable (and making sure not to let it cool off too much). Using the proper icing spreader also makes it smooth and neat. This can really be a beautiful cake. I too added chocolate chips to the cake mixture and sprinkled them between the layers. I then sliced Reese's cups (large ones, because it goes more quickly) in half, placing the cut portion against the base of the cake and creating a pretty ring all the way around. I then chopped up some cups and sprinkled them on the top. (I also made it for a co-worker this way, and she insisted on photographing it before anyone sliced into it.)

When I ate my first piece of cake right after finishing the baking, I was ambivalent cause it seemed rich and sweet enough to choke a horse and the yellow cake mix taste seemed toe evident through the peanut butter taste. But when my son woke me up at 4 AM to tell me he had finally won his video game (he forgot that though he is on vacation, I had work today!) I had a piece and was blown away by how delicious it was after "melding" a while in the fridge. The problem is I have gained two pounds in 12 hours! Listened to other reviewers on frosting problems, and added more milk; for me 1/3 of a cup of milk from the start was perfect. Also put 3/4 cup of peanut butter in the cake mix with great results.

If you love Choc. and Peanutbutter you will love this cake! I have made it since it was first issued in 1991 and thought I had lost the recipe. Thank goodness for the archives!! I can't wait to make it and have it again.

This cake ROCKED! I'm stingy w/ my forks too! I can where some might have trouble w/ the icing. I think you need to melt the choc., add the peanut butter and incorporate, THEN add the sugar and combine and finally add the milk. This worked for me. The icing was very rich, but good. The cake was sooo moist. I added 3/4C of peanut butter, just to be sure it had that peanut buttery taste! I could eat the cake sans the icing, really. Good stuff for adults and kids alike!

I liked this cake...the "two great tastes that taste great together" went over well with my guests, also. I have to say that the icing was quite doughy and difficult to work with. There was nothing creamy about it, and while I was frosting the cake it bothered me...maybe the key to mix the frosting only long enough to incorporated the milk...?
