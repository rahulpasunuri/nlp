I thought this dish was fantastic, however my family (11y/o + 14y/o + hubbage) couldn't *stand* it. Breaks my heart, because I would love to make this over and over again. While I found the ginger and curry flavors unexpected and refreshing with fruit, they thought it was just "weird." Go figure. I did find the julienne treatment labor-intensive, and unnecessary unless you're planning a photo shoot. Small dice would be fine, and a lot easier.

I have been making this all summer and it gets rave reviews every time I serve it. I make the dressing day before or morning off, and cut the fruit a few hours before in order to minimize prep time while guests are there. Then I simply mix it all just before serving. It's addictively delicious!

Allow me to be the first who does not rave about this recipe. I made it exactly as directed. Both the freshly grated ginger and curry powder were flavors that were too intense for this slaw. Indeed, the fresh fruit flavors were overpowered. I like the idea of the stone fruit slaw, however, I might try it next time without the curry and the ginger.

Wonderful recipe. Depth to the flavors. I didn't julienne very well but it didn't seem to matter. And yes, made it pretty near the serving time. Everyone loved it. It's a keeper!!

Really fantastic and easy recipe with wonderful flavor. Agree that under-ripe fruit is the best. I made this several hours before serving and wished I would have waited a bit--instead of flavors meshing as I'd hoped, it got just the slightest bit mushy. Served with pork ribs--it was great regardless!

Amazing recipe. Served with finger sandwiches and a pasta salad at a baby shower and received rave reviews. Made the dressing the night before and chopped the fruit in the morning. Not too much work at all. Definitely get fruit that is not very ripe.

Amazing, I got so many compliments. The julienning takes some time, but it is very worth it. It is great alongside BBQ. Using underripe fruit gives it a bit of crunch. Make sure to use a wide variety of stone fruits, for the color. It makes such a beautiful presentation to have different colored skins and flesh. I used white nectarines, yellow peaches, and plums. I also added a few chopped almonds at the end, but it certainly warrants the rating without that.

This was so good - a great summertime side dish and easy to make. Even my 3 y.o. asked for seconds.

I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried this. It was great and went well with my lemongrass crusted chicken.

I have to admit I was skeptical at the ingredient mix but went ahead and tried the recipe. All I have to say is "wow!" - it was great. Nice flavors, a little kick from the ginger and pepper flakes, and fresh. Great for hot weather and something different. Definately will add to the list of favorites for the summer.

This was surprisingly tasty, and interesting! The kick from the red pepper was great, and the flavor from the vinegar and spice (I used cumin because I was out of curry powder) balanced the sweetness and tartness from the fruit. A really pretty, interesting take on a fruit "salad"!
