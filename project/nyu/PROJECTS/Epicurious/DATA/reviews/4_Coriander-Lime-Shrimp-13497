I've made this quite a few times, always to great acclaim. Sometimes I grill the shrimp after the soak, which of course works just fine. Excellent recipe, and easy.

These shrimp are amazing. I have made both on the grill and sauteed. When I didn't have orange marmalade, I've used raspberry jam and it was just as good. I always test the flavor of the marinade for sweetness, right amount of kick, etc. and adjust accordingly. I don't know how you can go wrong with this recipe though. At every party they're the first to go. LOVE them!

Very disappointing. The marinade doesn't work in the short time suggested, then get patted off, leaving subtle flavor at best. The dipping sauce is too thin to compensate for the bland shrimp.

Very good seafood recipe. I let the shrimp brown a bit in the skillet and served it over rice.

Loved it! I bought pre-cleaned, shelled and deveined shrimp and marinated raw. Very tasty -this will be a party staple for me from now on. I might kick up the spice a bit next time.

Love this recipe! After reading the reviews - I made it both ways...using precooked shrimp and marinating, and then using raw shrimp and marinating. With out a doubt both were delicious - but I prefer the raw marinade version. I bought frozen raw, cleaned shrimp. After defrosting, I marinated them for about two hours, then sauteed. I added butter with the oil to the sautee for extra flavour. I refridgerated them after cooking to chill. I also made extra marinade which I cooked down with some added honey and then strained to get a smoother consistency. I chilled the sauce and poured over the shrimp at the last minute. I made 6lbs for 24 people as an appetizer - and they were begging for more! So good!

This shrimp recipe ROCKS!!! I used large wild mexican prawns (10-12) and followed recipe as stated. I will make again but will thread the shrimp on skewers and BBQ. The dipping sauce is really good - I can't imagine anyone not loving these shrimp.

Glad to see this a fave on Epicurious. Been making this for years from the Gourmet's Parties cookbook. Sometimes the oldies are worth revisiting. I too cook the sauce after removing the shrimp and place in a small bowl for dipping. Always a hit! Highly recommended!

I say this is the best recipe. I make great shrimp. This is what I like to call "super." I use that word to mean something is better than just good, or great. Maybe you've heard that word. AND, I am a "fab" cook, meaning fabulous. Use my advice: don't forget the shrimp.

Make often, but always add 1 tbl honey to the marinade

This recipe is always a hit and is quick to go at parties. Instead of sauteeing, I skewer and barbeque the shrimp (and the shrimp are never tough!).

Rating: 2
I thought this was pretty good...but not the best shrimp app ever. I took the advice of others and boiled down the remaining 1/3 cup of marinade and then poured it over the top of the cooked shrimp. I think I would try to use the largest shrimp I could find next time -- I only cooked for a minute per side, but still they seemed a little tough.

An easy but impressive hos d'oeuvres. I've made this several times - a wonderful blending of flavours! It has become a favourite in our home and with friends. Try BBQ the shrimp instead of sauteing.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! Once I realized that corriander sprigs = cilantro, this was an easy recipe! Took the suggestion of marinating previously cooked shrimp. Marinated for about 3 hours, lightly patted dry with paper towel before serving on a bed of radicchio along with the dipping sauce. They were a huge hit at a cocktail party. Easy and a nice change.

I put the shrimp in my pocket for later and, boy, was it mushy the next day. DON'T make the same mistake I made.

Rating: 4
I've also made this dish too many times to count as the smell of the marinade is to die for. Instead of shrimp, we use it more commonly as a fish marinade for fish tacos. I've also marinaded chicken in it, used it as a dipping sauce and spooned it over rice. The possibilities are endless. Thanks to the recipe search on this site. I lost it some time ago but remembered the title. Definitely a keeper!

I wound up overcooking the shrimp, my fault- but after marinating all day I expected more flavor. If I try this again I will use cooked shrimp as the reviewer did below.

Rating: 4
This was the hit of my cocktail party, and the way I made it, it was so easy! I used pre-cooked shrimp and just marinated them for about an hour in the refrigerator. The only thing I would do differently is follow other reviewers' suggestions to simmer the portion of the marinade to be used for sauce to thicken it up a bit. Several guests said they will be serving these at their next party.

This worked for us. The chutney idea is good and if I ever get the chance I'll try grilling. Very tasty.

Rating: 1
Grilling is the way to go with this recipe, I think. I sauteed and the shrimp ended up dry and overcooked (my fault). The lime juice begins chemical cooking while marinading, even for only 45 minutes. I used medium size shrimp. I'd try it with large shrimp or prawns next time.

Rating: 4
A wonderful, easy recipe. I grilled 4 lbs for a party for 37, and it disappeared in a flash. Some folks said it was the best shrimp they'd ever had. Others said I could've served 10 more lbs and it would've been eaten. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This is definitely a winner - had small dinner party and the shrimp (prawns here in Aussie land) were delicious. For those who don't eat them, I also marinated some chicken mid wings which were equally scrummy (scrumptious). I didn't change anything and it was perfect - everyone wanted the recipe.

This recipe is so simple and is always a hit! I have made this for many occasions and it has never failed to please. Like another reviewer, i like to reduce the marinade and serve it over soba. Delicious!

I only gave this three forks because I didn't make the original recipe. After reading all the reviews, I altered the recipe using jalapeno jelly instead of the marmalade - adding fresh ginger as well. Also, I added some key lime juice that I had since I didn't have enough fresh limes for the required amount. I grilled the shrimp and they were served warm. It was awesome!! I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

I have made these so many times, I can't count. They are very good and always go quickly. Served for a starter and grilled them outside in one of those baskets to hold hamburgers. they turned out as good or better than when done in the pan. Con't recommend enough.

I wasn't too impressed with this... the flavor was pretty good and I liked the slightly spicy aftertaste from the chile flakes. However, I found 1-1/2 minutes per side is a bit too long to cook shrimp. Nothing specific I didn't like... just no fireworks like I expected. If I make this again, I think I'll grill, rather than saute, the shrimp.

Rating: 3
I made this as an appetizer prior to Thanksgiving, served it at room temperature. It had rave reviews! I thought that I would also try with and angelhair pasta as an entree. I took some of the marinade and used it to saute and finish the shrimp...allowing it to cook down and infuse. Can't wait to make it again for the masses.

Rating: 3
This has become something that people request I bring to potlucks, parties, etc. I don't mind, because it's easy to make and I love it too. I have never cooked this as called for though. After marinading, I skewer the shrimp and give them a few minutes each side, on the grill. Very tasty!

The recipe sounds good in any case, but I tried this for a graduation party (ten people... so I doubled the recipe) mostly because of the reviews. There's no question ... this is a crowd pleaser. It's a bonus that it is easy to do, and can readily be prepared the day before (which is what I did).

This was a pretty good recipe, but not as fantastic as I had hoped. I prepared my sauce a day ahead and marinated overnight, which worked pretty well and cut down on the prep time the day of. For those of you who (like myself), hunt around and can't find fresh coriander--it's cilantro...

Yummy, yummy, yummy. Everyone loved it. I ended skewering the shrimp and baking them to serve as part of a large asian-influenced buffet. Oh so good. Probably even better if sauteed like the recipe calls for.

If you are looking for a tasty shrimp appetizer to serve at a dinner party - choose this! My guests always love it and request the recipe.

I was intrigued by this due to all the positive reviews and have to agree: it is an extremely tasty dish. I found people were soaking up the last drips of marinade with french bread when the shrimps were gone. Everyone commented on how good it tasted, and this was despite using small, previously frozen shrimp. It is probably even better with fresh shrimp. This goes onto my "all time favourites list". Everyone asked me for the recipe.

This dish was a big hit during a recent barbeque. I skewered and grilled the shrimp instead sauteeing as the recipe suggested. People literally sat themselves down in front of the plate of shrimp and didn't move until it was all gone, which by the way took only a few moments.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a great light and low fat recipe. I also put it over angel hair pasta and I had clean plates all around. I would cut back a bit on the soy sauce, and I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic. Also, the prawns cook fast so be careful about over cooking them or they will get a bit too chewy. (Tip: It takes 4 limes to get half a cup of lime juice.)

I actually like this recipe better as an entree, pouring the reserved marinade over the shrimp. As an appetizer it was o.k., but the flavors were not as pronounced as I would have liked. Using the marinade as a dipping sauce was too messy and bothersome. I used the Forman Grill as suggested, and found that one minute was enough time.

This dish is incredible. Our friends were eating it up as fast as we could make it. We BBQ'd it and it came out perfectly. We prepared the marinade 2 days ahead of time and just poured it over the shrimp as they were cooking on the BBQ. We skewered 2 shrimp onto each skewer and when we served it we had a small dish on the side to dip in. I would give it more than 4 stars for sure.

Does this ever play well to a crowd! I have cut back on the olive oil (1/2 tbl) with no adverse effect. I completely peel smaller shrimp and serve with toothpicks for appetizer. I have also cooked the sauce down a bit. Recently I tried gently braising in the marinade for greater tenderness; that works too.

I have to join all the reviewers who are raving over this dish. I made a double recipe for a New Year's party and the dish was gone even before all the guests arrived. Since my family likes things spicy hot, I doubled the pepper flakes and was generous with the pepper. It was wonderful.

BBQ'd on skewers and dipped in thickened marinade. Have never seen a man eat so many shrimp before, actually I have never eaten so many shrimp before either! We are from Houston and are used to hot foods....perhaps those that can't handle hot foods might reduce the amount of cilantro (coriander).
