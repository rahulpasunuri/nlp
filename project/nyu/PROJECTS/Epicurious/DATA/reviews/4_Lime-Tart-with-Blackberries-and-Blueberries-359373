Heading back to make this dessert for the second time. Easy, tasty, crowd pleaser. I added raspberries for a red, white, and blue themed dessert for July 4th. About to do it again for a Labor Day BBQ.

Delicious! I took it to a 4th of July party, and everyone loved it. Instead of blackberries, I made a star shape out of strawberry slices in the middle and then put blueberries in concentric circles around it. Very festive for the 4th. People loved the contrast of flavors. Only had an 11 inch tart pan, which worked out just fine. Crust was a little thinner, though, so only baked it for about 20 minutes before it was golden brown.

This was delicious. A bit strenuous juicing all those limes, but well worth it. In future I'd use a bit more jam to glaze it, but otherwise it was perfection!

I'm not sure about the problems other reviewers stated. I made the recipe exactly as described - although I probably cut back the sugar a little as I like it on the tart side and anything to cut a few calories. (I also shorted the butter in the filling and in the crust by a tsp or more). I think that perhaps the key to not having a runny filling is to not let it cool more than an hour or so in the refrigerator. Mine had started to set up when I put it into the crust, but continued to set after pouring it in and refrigerating overnight. I combined the crust ingredients in a food processor which works best for me and I did actually use a double boiler to cook the curd. Very pretty, very tasty and more time-consuming than difficult to make.

A perfect tart for a dinner party. It is easy to make, it looks pretty and it's very flavorful.

After all the great reviews I was expecting a stellar dessert. Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe, the curd was too strong--too tart for my taste. Also, when serving, the curd just didn't hold up even though it thickened in the refrigerator and was thick going into the tart crust. Really disappointed with this recipe although it LOOKED amazing (before slicing).

The curd didn't thicken properly for me, despite reaching the right temperature, so it was too runny, even after overnight chilling. I'd try again but will cook curd longer. Agree with other comments about pastry needing less time. Great flavour in both the curd and pastry.

I've made this twice now, and both times it has turned out delish! Easy to do, and looks beautiful, and the combination of the lime and berries are terrific. Aother great recipe from Bon!

This tart was delicious, fairly simple to make, and looks very impressive. I substituted raspberries for blackberries though either would taste great.

This tart is gorgeous! I used blackberries and raspberries on top and the colors were beautiful against the lime curd. I followed the recipe exactly and found two things: (1) the tart is extremely difficult to cut (be sure to have a sharp knife for serving and (2) the tart requires less baking time. Overall, a huge hit.

This was a gorgeous dessert! I was inspired by the photo of it in Bon Appetit to make the recipe. Per other reviewers I did not use a double boiler and the curd came out great in a medium pot. I also didn't strain it. Brushing the blueberries with the melted jam is a really nice touch. My company loved it as did my husband, but frankly, it was a little too sweet for me.

This was delicious, and easy. I agree on the cooking time for the crust, 35 minutes was too long. The curd was wonderful and besides tasting great it was a beautiful presentation.

This tart was so delicious! Loved the easy crust; although it gave me a problem coming out of the pan, the flavor was right on...I made the curd exactly as written and did not experience an "eggy taste" that another poster found. I beat the eggs very well with the lime juice over a pot of simmering water and did not strain it (didn't see the need) as it came out smooth as silk. I added raspberries with the blackberries & blueberries to the top of the tart and I have to tell you, I'm thinking about making a raspberry curd the next time. Fabulous!

Loved this. Made it exactly as written but you could certainly substitute other kinds of berries or fruit. Guests also loved it. It was a little hard to slice, however, and I had to get out the 8" chef's knife to really press down on the crust, and I did not get nice, even slices (it tends to run a bit). But no one cares. Just make sure they see the whole tart before you cut it so they are suitably impressed :-)

This was good, and very pretty but somehow missing something. The lime curd was too sweet or too tart or something. If you're looking for something along these lines, I'd recommend the lemon poppyseed tart on this website. I've made that a few times and like itmore.

I didn't taste this, as I made it for the June Dessert of the Month for a charity auction. But it turned out perfectly beautiful, and I do recommend the glaze, as without that it looked a bit un-finished. I too made the curd and the crust the day before, baked and cooled the crust early in the morning, then assembled and chilled for a couple of hours, and delivered to the lucky winner by noon. Top notch recipe.

Rating: 3
Really liked this and would make again, but with the caveat that I would not use egg white to make the lime curd - it had a distinctly eggy taste which I later learned is from using white rather than just yolk in the curd. Other than that it turned out perfectly and looked lovely.

Both looked and tasted fantastic. For my first time making a curd, I did use the double boiler method and didn't find it a hardship. What impressed me most was the crust. I've made tarts before and always had problems rolling out dough and getting it into a tart pan. This method was easy and came out beautifully. I didn't have any jelly or jam around for the glaze and it didn't suffer from the omission. My blackberries and blueberries were enough and the tart got many raves.

Rating: 4
Also - what the jam/jelly does is bring out the color in the berries - especially the blueberries which are rather dull without it (since they are fresh).

I made it with lemon instead of lime. It is really easy with the lemon curd being the hardest but it is really not that hard at all! Having an instant read thermometer will help you make sure the eggs are cooked to the right temp. Also make sure you do strain it because bits of egg white do cook ... and you don't really want that in your curd - it wouldn't be the end of the world though. I didn't like the way the blackberry jam looked on the berries. I think after heating that and liquifying it with some water, I would also strain that, too so you just have the blackberry juice to put on the berries so it looks a bit neater. you could probably use any jam or jelly to do that.

Very pleasing summer dessert. My variation was to use blueberries, raspberries and diced Champagne mangos. No need to strain the curd. Will definitely make again.

I tried this at a friend's house and liked it so much that I made it myself. For my go around, I didn't use blackberry jam or blueberries (since I think the fresh blackberries are all it really needs). I didn't find the double boiler to be a problem -- I just used a fairly wide metal bowl and set it on top of a bowl that had about 2 inches of water simmering. I whisked for 6 minutes and stopped, since I didn't have a thermometer, and it turned out fine. Be prepared to do this far in advance -- the stuff has to sit in the fridge forever!

Loved this tart. A few comments... used 1 cup regular flour and 1/4 cup almond flour for the crust which gave it a nice flavor. Also made the curd and crust the night before. Baked the crust in the morning, and once it had cooled, assembled the tart and then let it refrigerate for a few hours. It set wonderfully. Didn't really need the blackberry jam. Served with fresh whipped cream.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I found the crust a bit crumbly, but that's probably because I had to use gluten-free flour. I thought the jam was unnessecary. It didn't ever thin out enough to make an effective glaze, and it didn't add much flavor. I would DEFINITELY recommend letting the tart chill for at least an hour before serving. When I served it freshly assembled, it was a giant mess, rather like a trifle. When I served the leftovers the next day, the curd held firmly and made a neat slice.

I experienced the same problems as many of the other reviewers; I didn't read the reviews until after I made the tart. Ditto for watching the time on the crust, I think 35 minutes was too long, as the crust came out a little hard, but tasted great. My curd never reached even 170 degrees, so next time I will follow suggestions and do away with the double boiler. I was sweating over that pot, I was whisking for soooo long! The curd could have been a bit firmer, but it tasted great and looked so beautiful that I DID take a picture! It's an impressive dessert, and it's nice that it can be made ahead and then assembled.

Yummy! I have made gallons of curd before but never used a double boiler so I agree with other reviewer - just not necessary. I liked the crust but watch your cooking times. Subbed strawberries with blackberries and it was delish. Leftovers held up surprising well.

Made it for a party and it was one of the easiest and nicest tarts I have ever made. Looking forward to making it again!

This was the most perfect looking dessert I ever made. I say that in part because Im not a great decorator, and desserts often need an artistic touch to look as well as they taste. I wish I had taken a picture because for once my version looked just like Bon Appetits. Unlike some other tarts I have made in the past, the flavor was nicely balanced. The custard is not too overbearingly sweet or sour, and it is set off perfectly by the unadultered fresh berries and buttery crust. Next time Im going to try the crust and lime curd with fresh strawberries from the farmers market! I did have one problem with this recipe though. The time it took to thicken the curd was definitely not 6 minutes. My arm was ready to fall offf. It was more like a half hour and the temperature never did reach 180 degrees. I even checked my thermometer afterwards to see if it was broken and it was fine. Im not sure what happened. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/lime-tart-with-blackberries-and-blueberries/

Didn't make enough crust so no sides to the tart but I made it with real lemon juice. I didn't even need the blackberry jam on top. Most delightful!! Coulnd't even wait for the crust to cool completely before making it and trying it.

An elegant dessert for a summertime party! The lime curd took some time, but overall set up well once it chilled for 4 plus hours. I used an almond crust instead and the light brushing of jam made the tart glisten. I have already been asked to make it again... With all the chilling and cooling doing this ahead is a great idea! So pretty!!!

I've made Curd more times than I can remember. As Steffano2 suggested, do away with the double boiler. I Beat the eggs with the sugar and put all of the ingredients including the butter in a heavy pan (LaCreuset)and cook stirring constantly with a wisk until it thickens and just starts to bubble. Remove from heat and put in a bowl to chill.I don't strain the curd as I like the zest in it for flavor.

This tart is excellent, a nice blend of sweet and sour flavors. Raspberries were much cheaper than blackberries this week, so I used them instead. I also made the tart shell with gluten-free flours (a mix of soy, sorghum, and sweet rice flour, with a bit of xanthan gum added). The tart shell was really tasty -- it reminded me of a sugar cookie.

This was amazing - it looked exactly like the picture and impressed everyone. I cooked the curd longer than the time allotted in the recipe to get it to the point where it would set, and even several days later it's perfect. Definitely party-worthy!

Hi Jane from Toronto. I don't think you will have a problem here. I have made lemon curd with margarine without a problem. The butter is there for a rich taste and smoothness, but the margarine's fat will do the same. Of course it won't taste "buttery." Google search "margarine lime curd" and there are a few. This is just a basic tart fill with curd and topped with berries. Any combo will be fine.

I have a question. Half of my family cannot eat dairy and butter is a major offender for them. I have substituted margarine for many baking recipes with success (crusts included) but have never tried making a curd filling with anything but butter. Anyone had success adapting this or similar recipe for dairy free eaters?

This was a favorite. The lime curd was tart and the presentation went off well. I doubled the recipe and made 2 tarts and I had some problems with the crust. It actually was difficult to cut and then came apart. I made the curd for the 2 tarts separately and I don't think I ever got to 178 as it was taking forever. However, with all my problems the taste was great.

Rating: 3
Very easy tart to make and assemble. If you've made custards before ditch the double boiler and just throw all the ingredients in the pot and stir constantly until it reaches 178 degrees or coats the back of a spoon over low heat. Great presentation and the flavor profiles work very well together!

The lime curd was excellent, if a little sweet. There are better crust recipes, however, and I would pair the insides with another crust, prefereably one using ground almonds.

Rating: 3
Great flavor without being too sweet. I didn't have lime so made it a lemon curd. The curd, even when it reached temperature, did not set well. After baking the crust, I placed the curd in the crust and baked for 10 more minutes - perfect. A hit at my house.

Rating: 4
A very easy to make, but oh-so-satisfying dessert. The flavours were all really well balanced. The lime custard wasn't too tart, and the subtly-sweet blueberries melded well with the custard. The crust was exceptional as well. Do check the baking time, as my crust was done a bit earlier than the suggested 35min (around 28 min). I used about 4 limes for the recipe to get the 3/4cups of juice (just an FYI). I would definitely make this again. It was definitely restaurant/bakery quality.

This was easy to make, has a beautiful presentation that seems to impress those who don't cook, and tasty to boot--loved the lime with the berries. The one caveat I had was that I found the lime curd to take far longer than suggested in the recipe and I don't know that I ever reached the temp of 178. I just gave up and called it done in frustration. There are easier curd recipes that I will probably use if making this tart again.

Easy to make! My guests gave it rave reviews. I did not find that it fell apart when cut.

This was pretty easy to make, especially if you do it in steps like the recipe suggests you can. I didn't have an instant read thermometer so I had to use my candy thermometer when making the lime curd. It may have needed to go a little longer, because once cut it tends to slide so maybe a little firmer would have been better. Other than that, this is a great recipe for people who like fruit tarts, the lime curd is nice and tart and the berries give such a nice compliment to that flavor. I will be making this again.
