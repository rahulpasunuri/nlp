I received pea tendrils in my CSA box and tried them in this recipe-they were delicious. I used olive oil instead of canola and sprinkled them with parmesan shavings when they were finished cooking. Didn't have any trouble with uneven cooking-they were all tender.

i might make this again but i doubt it. just note that the delicate nature of peapod tendril leaves make it impossible to cook the strings and stalks to any degree of tenderness. yo uend up with a tough chewy stalks and nearly non-exixtant leaves. but the flavor was great, especially paired with jasmine rice and white wine and oregano poached grey sole. next time i'll probably leave them uncooked and toss them in a vinegrette.
