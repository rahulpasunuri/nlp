This was so amazing! I forgot to strain it like everyone suggested but it still ended up being great! I'll definately strain it next time and probably double the recipe.

I too found this too sweet on its own. But with the mango, it was quite delicious. If I were to have it on its own, it might be better cut with some unsweetened coconut milk or cream.

I gave this four forks because everyone raved, even my husband (who doesn't care for sweets mosts of the time). Oddly, I didn't seem to like it as much as my guests and spouse, but everyone else loved it, so who am I to argue? --I thought it was too sweet and I would have liked more tang and sparkle from the lime juice, but I was afraid to add much more than the recipe called for. Also: the recipe did not specify that you should freeze the sorbet before serving it, and as I have never used an ice-cream maker before, I didn't. The leftovers (I had doubled the recipe to serve 8) seemed to have a very nice texture this morning; without the additional time in the freezer after churning, the sorbet was on the soft side.

Very good. Like previous reviewers, I found straining helpful.

With regards to using regular coconut milk, we tried the recipe two ways, first with the coconut cream. Secondly we tried the recipe with coconut milk (18% fat). Let the can rest in the fridge overnight. You can then scoop the fat off the top and retain the underlying milk for another recipe. Works well and with 18% of the can you have enough fat for one batch. With the coconut milk fat the sorbet is lighter and more refreshing. Thanks Ottawa for the straining tip.

AMAZING! One of the best things I've ever tasted. Has the richness of coconut without being too heavy. I added a teaspoon or so of ginger juice and, following the advice of a previous reviewer, strained the mixture (gets out the little bits of lychee nut pieces). Served it with as part of a sorbet trio with pineapple jalapeno and passion fruit.

EAsy and delicious. Double the recipe... doesn't make much.

dear cook from minneapolis, the reason your version of the coconut lychee sorbet didnt freeze in an ice cream maker is because the coco lopez has a very high fat content and the fats solidify as they freeze. your mixture probably didnt have enough structure given that you just added sugar and coconut milk. in addition, sugar is an anti-freezing agent, much like alcohol. so, the increased sugar content was the more likely culprit of why it didnt freeze in the ice cream maker.

This is one of the best sorbet recipes I have ever made--the coconut cream gives it a lovely creamy texture without being overly rich. Intense lychee flavour--I will be serving it with Vidal icewine next time. The only thing I would recommend is passing the mixture through a fine sieve before freezing--doing so improved the texture and made it a snowy white colour.

It was delicious, but it didn't make a lot. I would like to double the recipe next time. Also, Smart and Final has the cream of coconut at half the price of other markets in my area.

This is one of our new favorite concoctions! I could not find Coco Lopez at my market, and instead used regular coconut milk, and added about 1/2 cup organic sugar. The creamy mixture tasted delicious, but I could not get it to freeze in my ice cream maker. I ended up just freezing it and mixing it up by hand in intervals while it froze. I've made it this way twice - it was so good the first time that I decided it was worth the manual process to have it again. Since I didn't make the recipe exactly according to the ingredients required, I'm not complaining, but I'd love to know why it wouldn't freeze in the maker for me...

This rich, creamy sorbet has a wonderufl blend and balance of flavours. And the best part is that it is incredibly simple to make. I'd give it 5 forks if I could!

This was easy and very delicious. Perfect for my summer Asian-themed dinner party - light, refreshing and elegant. I only made the sorbet - I used mangoes in other dishes and didn't want to keep repeating them - and served it with homemade fortune cookies. This is such a breeze to make and so impressed my husband and guests that I know I'll be making it again this summer.

I made this dessert twice now and think it is out of this world. Easy, elegant and refreshing. A well balanced combination of flavors.
