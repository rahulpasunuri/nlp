For those hesitant due to the bottled dressing- don't be! I make scratch dressings frequently, and my daughter and I both LOVED this. This is an excellent dressing provided you use high- end bottled dressing( I use Paul Newman's). I added some anchovy paste too.

I made this for a New Years Eve dinner - a number of my guests are on Weight Watchers, so the dressing was a big draw. Despite the fact that bottled dressing was used in the dressing recipe - everyone, even the non-dieters raved about it. I did add anchovies to the dressing which definitely gave it some body. A great recipe - will definitely be using it again.

Tried this recipe as wanted to enjoy a healthy salad. Was dubious about using bottled dressing as prefer to use fresh ingredients. Thought the bottle dressing might help a low fat dish but it ruined the dish for me. I agree that anchovies are needed to make this recipe more authentic.

Way healthier version of caesar salad. The recipe actually makes a massive amount of dressing...you could probably half it and still have leftovers. I'm going to be eating salads all week now, but at least it turned out to be a tasty recipe.

This receipe is great for busy working people. I had a bumber crop of green beans in my garden and was looking for something different to use them. I did use regular yogurt and added a teaspoon of olive oil to the dressing for flavor. My famly loved.

Many more options for Caesar salad are available if you search for "Caesar" rather than this incorrectly spelled recipe name.

I find this salad to be tasty, quick and healthy. This site tries to appeal to people of all tastes. Reviewers making derogatory remarks regarding ingredients should keep their opinions to themselves. Instead helpful suggestions should be made. Here's mine: I prefer this salad with green beans only no lettuce or croutons. The dressing has enough flavor. If you want to use croutons then I would use plain.

If I had wanted bottled dressing, I would have went to the store and bought some instead of coming to this site for a recipe. What a dissapointment!

I agree that this would be a tolerably good salad if all of the ingredients were full fat. Also, where are the croutons?

This is an awsome recipe.Was a great beginning to the Halibut with Summer Veggies.I added a bit of anchovy paste but other wise wouldn't change a thing. Going to make it again tonight.:)

Great salad, and so easy. We blanched the beans and they were crunchy enough. Also - we cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for 2 people as an entree. For convenience, you can use a bag of Italian salad mix (romaine and radicchio) but beware to reduce the amount of dressing. It had a little too much dressing with just one bag. This would definitely be better with real-fat Italian dressing, real-fat yoghurt, and real-fat Parmesan, but we used fat-free everything. I think we'll splurge next time and go for the real stuff, but the fat-free option was good.

I prefer the beans raw. This keeps the salad crunchy, and enhances the flavor of the beans.

This was actually good! You need to add some anchovy paste to get a more authentic flavor, though, and we decreased the minced garlic to 2 cloves - we love garlic, but 4 cloves was a bit too much. This recipe is for those of us who love Caesar salad, but don't need the calories. Don't be such a food snob, Steve!
