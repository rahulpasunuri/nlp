Loved this!! The raisins and pecans make these tacos unique and different from the boring old recipe. This is now my go-to beef taco!

Raisins? Pecans??? Are you transplanted from Georgia? I would like to see a basic Mexican Taco recipe.

Are you kidding? Raisins and pecans in TEXAS tacos? It figures someone from Florida came up with this recipe. Where's the garlic and fresh ground chilies? This is disgusting.

I have not made this, but I have to agree with fellow reviewers: There is NOTHING Texan about this recipe!

I found this recipe very bland. Add cumin, lime juice and chili powder to spice it up...

A different take on tacos! The raisins add a sweetness that makes this an interesting, different taco, but very good. I added some salt and pepper, and used a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies + tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, which gave it a bit of spice. Next time, I'd add some cayenne to spice it up a bit more. This is a very good recipe, and so much better than our typical taco recipe of "beef and a pouch of seasoning."

I love this recipe. It is THE quintessential weeknight meal: quick, filling and yummy.

This turned mundane ingredients from my pantry into something different! These were great-tasting tacos. I substituted slivered almonds, which I toasted, for the pecans. I used ketchup instead of plain tomato sauce, which added sweetness. I also added chili powder and garlic powder to the ground beef to make it a bit spicier. The taco filling was spicy, sweet, and cruncy. We liked these tacos a lot and will make them again!

DELICIOUS! I was a little scared to try it, but I'm grateful that I did. I love the RAISINS and PECANS...ADD THEM!! They are great! Easy recipe packed with great taste.

YUMMY! This received rave reviews from my kids and is now requested for birthday parties. I liked the fact that it didn't have chili powder or red pepper in it. (My kids have yet to develop a taste for that.) I was cautious about the amount of cumin and therefore only added 1 Tablespoon. Next time I will put the full amount in. ADD THE RAISINS AND PECANS! Don't listen to those other whiney reviewers who know nothing about good food. (I gave this the highest rating to compensate for their inaccuracy.) I serve these with chopped garden tomatoes, chopped avocados, salsa, and torn romaine leaves. For a delicious mexican rice, try boiling 2 cups organic chicken broth with 1 cup brown (sweet) jasmine rice. Add your favorite good quality salsa to the rice once cooked. Bon Appetit!

Absolutely fabulous! This recipe has been a hit every time I have made it. Those who say they won't even try raisins in tacos are totally missing out!

I live in Texas and although this might not be tex-mex or Texas style, I thought it was great. I did grind up the raisins because I didn't want to hear it from the teenagers, but I wouldn't skip them - it definitely adds to the flavor. I whipped up some gravy and used half the mixture for enchiladas and half for tacos. I thought it was good and will make it again.

No self respecting TEXAN would put raisins in a taco !!!

the cumin is a bit over powering.

Many people think that Texas Tacos refer to tex-mex or from Texas, but if I am not mistaken it refers to a recipe of a very popular taco joint at Olveras St. in Los Angeles, CA back in the 1940's. I don't like raisins, but added to meat and cooked they are hardly noticeable, and add some sweetness to the recipe. Try grinding them with about one (1) tablespoon of oil in a food processor or blender, and then adding it to the meat when cooking it. The tacos are worth making, but is not something that I would serve for friends.

The raisins and pecans sound just awful. I have no plans to even try this dish. However, in all fairness to the recipe, I don't understand all the criticism slammed at this recipe because this is not Tex-Mex? Do you people really believe Tacos are only a Tex-Mex dish?

Texas beef tacos? I think not. My Texan-style tacos are more like a picadillo...then wrapped in corn tortillas and fried in oil...almost a taquito... not healthy but tasty!

I always love salads especially with taco and lettuce.this is a great recipe and I love making one for my friends.

Mmmm, I am looking forward to trying this! Having lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for 6+ yrs, I agree this is the farthest thing from Tex-Mex. But another reviewer seems to be right about this looking like a version of the classic Cuban/Central American/Caribbean picadillo filling for empanadas or soft tacos.

I'm a 5th generation Texan, and can guarantee you this recipe has nothing to do with a traditional Tex-mex taco. My Mexican neighbor was horrified at this recipe. Green bell peppers but no jalepenos? People unaccustomed to real Tex-mex food might like this. One fork is far too high a rating for this recipe. If you want real Tex-mex food, look elsewhere.

Rating: 0
Actually, this is a very trafitional recipe for a South/Central American picadillo. It's certainly not "Tex-Mex."

Potatoes perhaps, but raisins, pecans, and (gasp!)purchased hot sauce! If I showed this to my grandmother, she'd laugh 'til she cried. She's been making tacos for 75 years, is Mexican, and has lived in Texas for most of her life. C'mon please, if you're going to attribute a recipe to a region, shouldn't you try to keep it authentic?

I've lived in Texas all of my life, and I've NEVER seen anyone EVER put raisins and pecans into a taco. What the hell is that all about? Obviously this was written by someone who hasn't spent 5 minutes worth of time in Texas. Probably someone like Emeril

Easy to prepare and delicious! I was even able to prepare it ahead of time and just reheated and added the cilantro before my guests came. I didn't add the pecans or raisins either.

A good basic recipe for Tacos.....but I left out the pecans and raisins.
