Tasty. Omitted the jalapeno's and made as directed. Is good, but is much better when you add some lime juice to it. Made as part of the chicken enchilada recipe and was very good.

I did not like this recipe. In fact I made it for a salsa competition with friends and it was hands down out of 11 salsas the worst. If you are looking for a traditional salsa verde - this is NOT it.

Good recipe that needs to be tweaked to my personal taste. For me, a little too much parsley and not enough heat. But I will make again and adjust amounts.

I used this recipe for homemade chicken enchiladas and it was great. I used 1 jalapeno only, cut back on the cilantro, and increased the parsley. I would also cut the salt in half if I made it again. I particularly liked the cumin seasoning and mint, though. It was really easy to make, boiling the tomatillos rather than grilling them, and then using the mixer for all other ingredients.

Very good as an alternative for tomato salsa as a dip. I've also put this on top of grilled salmon with a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Yum. The stacked enchiladas that this was meant for are delicious as well.

There are mentions of Poblano Peppers from some reviewers yet the current recipe does not call for Poblano only Jalapeno. What is that about?

the second time I made this I added a large shallot to the cooking ingredients-- and didn't have much parsley in the garden but it came out great. It was wonderful the next day on a cold salad of steamed zukes, avocados, corn, tomatoes and left over grilled shirt steak.

This is an update from my previous review. When I served this the second day with the stacked chicken enchiladas, it wasn't as spicy. I don't know why it lost some of its spiciness. We enjoyed it even more the second day. Will definitely make again.

I gave this 4 forks even though it was a little too spicy for my taste. Even my husband, who likes very spicy food, thought it was too hot. Next time, I will use only one jalapeno. The pablano peppers also add spiciness. I only boiled the tomatillos about 8 minutes because they were already getting mushy. Perhaps it was too spicy because the jalapenos didn't boil 15 minutes. If I had known the tomatillos wouldn't take 15 minutes to cook, I would have started boiling the jalapenos about 7 minutes before adding the tomatillos. This sauce would have been great if not for the excessive heat. I will try it again. Has anyone tried freezing this for later use?

I really liked the flavor of the salsa. I made it yesterday to use with the accompanying chicken enchilladas. One word of caution though, I would watch the tomatillos closely during the simmering. I didn't, and mine got a little mushier than I would have liked.

This is a great chile verde sauce. Everyone loved the layered chicken dish and the next batch of sauce become pork chile verde with the addition of cooked pork.

I've made this twice now. Once for a get together and once just because I liked it so much. The salsa itself (I think other reviewers might be rating the recipe that called for it - a layered baked chicken dish) is great with chips, and I also put it over some cold leftover broiled salmon that i sprinkled with a little lime juice. Really tasty. It tastes just like the salsa verde at my favorite Peruvian Restaurant where they serve it with roasted chicken and it is delicious. It's a little time consuming, but worth the effort.

The only change I made was to double the jalapenos. This is delicious for enchiladas.

The mint is a surprising addition and balances the sometimes overwhelming cilantro, but like another review said, don't be afraid to have more tomatillos or a little less herb...it's plain awesome. In any event, this is the best salsa verde I've ever had! I've given it away and shared the recipe with a dozen people in a week already!

I liked this recipe but I think it's going to be the first time I've ever said I think it had too many herbs. I like my tomatillo salsa to have more tomatillo than herbs. I will make it again but reduce the parsley.

I loved this recipe; I have to say though that I changed it around a little. I made the salsa according to the directions and the results were excellent. I highly recommend using the mint in the salsa because it really goes well with the rest of the flavors. I made a no-carb version and I actually used the Poblano chiles as the layering component instead of the tortillas. I also added cheese within each layer. I used shredded cheddar cheese because thats what I had. The result was really really good. This dish does take a couple of hours to make, but it is very easy and it is totally worth the time.

Yumm...The family loved it. Very fresh tasting with the mint, parsley and cilantro combo in the salsa verde. I prefer to roast the tomatillos, garlic and jalapenos in the oven. 425 for about 15 minutes. Very easy. As far as the cheese goes, always use more!!
