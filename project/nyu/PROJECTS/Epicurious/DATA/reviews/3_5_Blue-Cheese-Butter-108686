Go ahead, melt this on your next steak....and then I dare you to go back to plain old naked steak! It is SO luscious.

This was good, easy and exactly what I was looking for. I didn't quite have the energy to make a sauce for our filets one night, and I tried this. It was very nice. A great way to make an ordinary steak something just a little more special.

This recipe is also called "roqueforto" from Argentina. It is deliscious with glass of red wine and spread on flatbread or french bread!
