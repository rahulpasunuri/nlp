I have made this cheesecake 4 times now because my coworkers keep requesting it for every pitch in. A couple of tricks to make it come out perfect. I use Ghiridelli dark chocolate chips and cocoa. I do a modified bath for the cheesecake by placing a pan of water one rack below the cheesecake. No soggy crust! Rather than taking it out of the oven to cool, once it's almost set about 50-55 minutes, I turn the oven off and open the oven door and let it cool in the oven for about an hour. I follow the rest of the recipe to a tee and it's sweet perfection.

I made this into mini cheesecakes an it came out great (the whole recipe made 24 minis). Use 1 Tbsp of the choc wafer mixture per mini; pat down. Didn't need the topping. Used 75% as semi-sweet and 25% as bittersweet (ghiradelli). Deelish!

This was spectacular and RICH, a chocolate lovers delight! I too couldn't find the chocolate wafers and didn't want to use Oreos. I found Keebler Stripes which were chocolate wafers with a fudge stripe, the closest I could get and thankfully, they worked. Made the recipe as directed (although I made crust to filling entirely in the food processor, just not together). I added a layer of cooked down, seeded and thickened red raspberries prior to the ganache layer and topped with fresh raspberries and sprigs of chocolate mint. It was loved by all. I am one who likes my cheesecake plain and never with chocolate, sometimes with fruit. This was rich enough in chocolate flavor that I enjoyed it a lot. This is truly a special occasion dessert that will be requested and made again.

Noting that many others had made this 'as is' I decided to experiment a bit and thought I'd share the results. Made it in an 8" springform and calculated by .75, turned out great. Added a few gingersnaps to the crust. On top of the cheesecake layer I spread a thin layer of raspberry jam (the fruit only kind). Then, I spread on about 3/4 of the ganache, added a layer of fresh blueberries, and drizzled the rest of the ganache over the top. Beautiful presentation and the blueberries helped cut the rich chocolate overload. Would have done it with raspberries but didn't find any good fresh ones--would probably have been even better. Rave reviews from the dinner party crowd.

Following alexedan's advice I turned this into cupcakes. Used 1 package of chocolate graham crackers for the crust, which I think needed a little more butter to hold them together. Paper cupcake cups were perfect. Used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips for the filling and topping and it turned out great. Needs 15-20 minutes to bake, add a pan of water in the oven and they won't crack. I've made this recipe twice before as a whole cheesecake and I think I like the cupcakes more, even though they are a little more work to make. Chocolate overload!

Rating: 4
A bit premature reviewing this but wanted to give sizing info because I couldn't find it...made this into 24 small cupcake-sized cheesecakes (this will make 36-48 mini muffin sized cheesecakes if you increase the crust. I used whole package of oreos (minus the cream centers which was the tedious part) and 3/4 stick of butter and 1 and 1/2 TBS sugar for the crust. Made a few of the minis too which I tasted. I thought the flavor was delicious as did other tasters. The minis are very cute for an appetizer party and released easily from the pan even though I did nothing to it before baking. I did line the sides and bottom of the cupcake sized pans with parchment and that can be easily removed and sides look great. I am still torn on the chocolate ganache topping versus a flavored whipped cream (Kahlua?) vs whipped cream and a raspberry to top these. They are dessert for a wine tasting party (to be served with a Cab) next weekend so I will be freezing them. BTW with the smaller sizes I just placed a pan of simmering water on the lowest oven shelf and had no cracks. Bonus...Only took 15 minutes to bake! Hope this helps someone!

I've made this cheesecake twice now and it is incredible! The first time I made it I used Baker's chocolate and it came out well, if a little bit gritty. The second time I used callebaut and I must say that the texture was much smoother. Suggestions for others: Use a water bath and decrease the temperature to 325, cook for one hour and then open the oven for a minute, close the oven and let the cheesecake cool with the water for another hour. Take it out of the oven and let cool to room temperature before putting it back in the oven. Also, I have never had much luck using a springform pan and therefore use a regular cake pan and then invert the cheesecake after it has chilled. (Google:Alton Brown's Cheesecake recipe for this technique.) And lastly, the first time I made this I did use a food processor but it was to the point of overflowing when I made the filling. The second time I made it I used my stand mixer with a paddle attachment and had more than enough room for the filling, just make sure to keep the mixing speed on low. I will be making this recipe again in the future!

Wow, this is one amazing dessert! I had to laugh at the "masterchef" comment below: I also gilded the lily a bit by adding almonds to the crust and adding almond extract and amaretto to the filling. The only thing I'd like to point out is that it's a good idea to actually leave the mixer running while you pour in the chocolate. Mine hardened into yummy little bits in the batter (not entirely a bad thing). A rookie mistake, perhaps, but at least now others know not to do the same thing - unless chocolatey bits in the batter is what they're after!

I have made this cake several times now, and it's always a winner! I just won 2nd place in a dessert bake off at my office today. I actually like this cake better using semi-sweet chocolate versus the bittersweet. The texture is the same, but the chocolate is a bit less heavy and intense. I also made a simple raspberry sauce that I drizzled on the plate before serving. It added a nice bit of pizzazz. The tartness of the berries was a great offset to the heavy sweetness of the chocolate. Like I said, this cake is a winner! Several of the judges did not want to stop eating it!

Like many reviewers, I dont have easy access to the higher-end chocolates so I used Bakers 67% Cocoa squares and Ghirardelli for the cocoa power. It was absolutely amazing! Most people couldnt believe I had made it while saying it was the best cheesecake they had ever tried. Everyone has an opinion about chocolate, but do yourself a favor and try this cheesecake the way recipe says first. You can always play Master Chef and add a raspberry topping (or whatever your interest) next time.

This is my turn to cheesecake recipe. In the past I did not have access to Scharffen Berger so I used Ghirardelli. This past Thanksgiving I got my hands on Scharffen Berger and it was divine! I paired it with Banfi 2008 Rosa Regale Brachetto D'Acqui. The raspberry and rose petal notes accentuated the dark chocolate. Definitely my most favorite dessert.

this cheesecake is incredibly decadent. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone who had a slice could barely finish it, but they all begged for the recipe! I used inexpensive dark chocolate bars (store brand of Lindt) and it still had a gorgeous chocolate taste, so I wouldn't bother buying uber expensive chocolate for it.

This cheesecake was beautiful to look at but really rather one-dimensional. I used the Scharffen Berger chocolate and cocoa powder and the rest were organic ingredients. It cost over $40 and for me was not worth it. Although very rich and dark chocolate-y (and I LOVE dark chocolate), it was boring and needed a contrasting element. It also was very time consuming as I don't have a food processor. I won't make this again. I made it for Thanksgiving and guests thought it was okay but liked the Epicurious pumpkin cheesecake crumble squares much better.

Rating: 4
I really don't have much to add to what other reviewers have said, other than I agree this is a marvelous cheesecake. I used chocolate grahams for the crust, as I could not find any plain chocolate cookies the day I did my marketing. They worked great. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet baking chocolate, and the cake turned out rich, velvety, and delicious. Will definitely do this again.

This cake is fantastically rich! The filling turned out to be like a mousse. I had some troubles justifying $4/4oz of bittersweet chocolate so after doing some research I used semisweet which is the same thing (bittersweet = Euro name). It was so smooth and creamy. Big hit at my party! I even had to speed up the "processing" time in regards to chilling by freezing it, thaw, freeze, touch of low oven time and it STILL turned out fab.

Rating: 4
I've made this for several dessert fundraisers, birthdays and dinners. It's always a hit. I don't deviate much from the recipe, however, sometimes I do skip the ganache and make a raspberry compote. The one thing I do usually change is the bottom. It has become impossible to find chocolate wafers. Last time I used a combo of Oreos and chocolate Teddy Grahams. It works out just fine.

Everyone loved it, but I thought it a tad boring. It's hard to make a chocolate cheesecake interesting; you need some tanginess in the filling, and this didn't have it. Crust was so simple as to be boring. I'm going to keep looking for the prefect chocolate cheesecake.

I've screwed up cheesecake in the past, so I was nervous but I followed the recipe and it worked perfectly. Very dense and rich. Slicing into 16 servings was just about right.

This was excellent! Do not: 1) take more than a sliver (16 servings, min) and 2) eat at 10 pm unless you intend to be awake for awhile. Children may not like because it is so rich and not child-sweet. A scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side seemed to solve the problem. Whipped cream may serve the same purpose. Well worth the quality ingredients.

Best chocolate cheesecake I have ever had. Granted I am a dark chocolate lover and this is not for those who prefer the sweet milk chocolate over the bittersweet darker fare. I used 71% Valrhona chocolate bars and chocolate graham crackers for the crust. I've made this several times (I half the recipe and bake in an an 8 inch springform. ) It always comes out delicious however I do find the crust a bit boring. After reading some of the reviews, I think I will add nuts or something in the crust next time. Also, I would avoid the medium or lower quality chocolates - I did it once and it was significantly inferior. It had the slight taste of chemicals or something unpleasant. Anyone ever tried incorporating coffee flavor into this recipe? If so, please do share!

This cheese cake is totally awesome! I substituted Neuchaftel for half the cream cheese, and after reading reviews, buttered parchment paper to line the springform pan, and cooked in a water bath. Wasn't going to make the ganache, but at the last minute decided to and it really made the presentation! Took this to a friends for Thanksgiving dinner, along with pumpkin pie bars, and hands down everyone there had cheese cake over pumpkin pie! I will definitely be making this again. I am already stashing away hubby's dark chocolate bars to make this!

This is fantastic. I have never made cheesecake before until last night. The recipe can easily be quartered if you want to make an individual serving in a 4" ramekin.

No doubt, this is one yummy, easily-made cake, I made the chocolate wafers myself (what a waste of baking cookies, eh ;) ) and the crust turned out lovely. One sliver is quite enough to send you into chocolate shock (by no means negative) and is definitely a treat. I am not sure whether I'd make it again though-- it was almost too much. Next time I think I'll go for something a tad lighter...but it was very delicious!

Wow, unbelievable! This was such a delicious decadent cheesecake. It's rich like others said but hey it's dark chocolate. The best chocolate cheesecake recipe I've ever found. The only addition I made was to add 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract to the filling and decreased sugar to 1 cup. Definately must but good quality chocolate though otherwise it will taste to sweet almost like confection instead of having the pure chocolate taste. I used the Scharffen Berger chocolate reccomended. After supper with espresso, Yummy!

My family loved this cheesecake and I can't wait to make it for my office holiday party. I used chocolate teddy grahams for the crust and a mix of 8 ounce semi-sweet chocolate and 1 ounce unsweet from Trader Joe's. By the second day the cream cheese tang was overcome by the chocolate and it reminded me of a truffle. I left off the topping but will it add for the party.

This cake is simply too dense and too rich to serve after a meal. Perhaps we would have liked it better after a light meal; but it was unappreciated after a Thanksgiving feast. The chocolate overtakes all of the other flavors. I don't even think I tasted the cheese and it didn't have that nice creamy texture associated with cheesecake. This cake is best for a dessert party. It will only be really enjoyed by a total chocolate lover.

Made this recipe for a friend's holiday party. Everyone seemed to like it, but I wasn't thrilled with it myself. The flavor was good, but I didn't feel that it warranted the stellar reviews posted here. Did seem better the second day, though. If I make it again, I'll add something like orange zest or a bit of almond extract to give it a kick - the recipe just wasn't that exciting.

Without a doubt the BEST chocolate cheesecake I have ever made. I was fortunate enough to find the Scharffen Berger 70% and it was phenominal. If making for people who don't drink coffee (because they almost always love dark chocolate) I would suggest using the 60%, as that is what most American palates can handle. I used teddy grahams for the crust and it turned out beautifully, I can't imagine scraping cookies in addition to crushing them. I made this cheesecake for company so I used the shavings, but semi-sweet chocolate seems to make prettier curls so I will do that next time. I've already gotten requests (and one demand)for this cake and I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic chocolate cheesecake! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used Oreo cookies (creme removed) for the crust. I used Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate since that's what the store had in stock (but would have preferred Scharffen Berger or Valrhona). I had a couple cracks around the edges since I didn't butter the sides of the springform pan well enough. The batter is very thick so make sure you smooth it out as much as possible. The chocolate ganache isn't necessary but definitely makes it more decadent!

I have made this recipe 3 times. Twice with regular cream cheese and this last time I tried Tofutti (tofu) cream cheese. It is awsome either way! I used Oreo cookies and removed the cream centers, but the chocolate teddy grahms sound much easier so I will try them next time. It always gets rave reviews. I served it with a rasberry sauce on the side to offset the richness once. With or without sauce, dairy or not it is an amazingly decadent delight.

It needed a little extra butter to make the crust that way... but it was well received. I will be making lots more of these in the future!

I made this a couple weeks ago and was very happy with the result. It came out perfect and tasted even better!!! Everyone who tried it loved it! I used semi- sweet chocolate for the topping and the only thing I could complain about is that I don't have a very big food processor and had to process everything in different batches - it got a little frustrating at some times... but it was worth it! I also used a cheap brand of chocolate and it didn't affect the cheesecake in anyway... I also had to cook it for longer than 1 hour. I will make it again soon!

If she does not have chocolate at home I am runnig to the store at eight at night to get her her fix. The only thing I have to say about this recipe is I did use extra butter on the crust. Just enough till it was all moist. And added a little extra sugar in the topping. Just to make it a little sweeter. All in all it was out of this world. I do not eat sweets but really enjoyed this. Oh yeah for my swirls I mixed bitter chocolate and sweet together. And if you are having trouble finding the chocolate wafers, try looking and using Peppridge Farm Chessman cookies. They worked great!!! Use 30 cookies from two packages. It works perfect. Just add the extra butter. Enjoy!!!!

My chocoholic husband & friends loved this, but it is extremely dense and rich. A 1/2 inch sliver was all I could manage. I did add 1 C. sour cream, b/c I was comparing and merging recipes (an almost identical one from Everyday Food). But would think the sour cream would've lightened it up. . . . Also used semi sweet chocolate for the ganache. I liked this contrast with the bittersweet in the cheesecake.

This is an exceptional recipe. I make a lot of cheesecakes and this is one of the best. It looks magnificent (the truffle topping does wonders for covering any cracks) and from the comments received, the taste is exceptional as well. ( I don't eat most things I bake as I really don't care for sweet things but I have a LONG list of taste testers.) It even received 2 thumbs up from someone who doesn't particularly like cheesecake but does like chocolate. Definitely a keeper that I plan to make again for a holiday party. I think I will decorate the top with a light snowflake powered sugar pattern for a bit of a festive feel.

Amazing....so rich, so chocolaty, so creamy! After reading the reviews I made the crust with regular graham crackers and made sure it was nice and thick to compensate for the "over the top" chocolate flavor.

I made this cheesecake for my friend's birthday. It was my first time making a cheesecake.Everyone who had it seemed to like it. I didn't think it was bland. I hate when people do this, but I have to admit that I did make a few changes. I went to a grocery store near my friend's house on foot, and so I could only choose between Baker's and Ghirardelli chocolate. I also had Hershey's Cocoa powder, which turned the batter purplish until I added the melted chocolate, so I plan on avoiding it and getting better cocoa powder. I used 120 teddy grahams to make the crust, as well as a bit more than 3/4 stick of butter (but less than 1, I just kind of poured until I liked the texture) as recommended. Also, I baked the cake in a water bath as suggested by my friend's mom, and topped with white chocolate curls for some color contrast.

My husband has made this twice for dinner parties. It received at least 6 forks from our guests. We didn't even use a "boutique chocolate" -- Ghiradelli bittersweet worked wonderfully. Add chocolate shavings while the topping is still moist - they adhere better. Serve with a good ruby port and your guests will be begging for another invite!

This is seriously good. I brought it in to work and people are saying this is the best cake I've made (and they've had a lot of my cakes). I will modify it in the future though. For one thing, I had some real sticking problems due, I think, to the fact that the pan is just buttered, not buttered and floured (or you could use cocoa powder so as not to leave white all over the sides). The sides do not look as attractive as the photo (because they stuck to the pan so much) so I spread the glaze all over and let it drip down the sides which looks nice. I might also bake this (as I do other cheesecakes) in a water bath to prevent the middle from sinking so much after baking. The other thing I did was to top with crushed up toffee bars per the request of the person whose birthday this was for. Overall though, it is SO fudgy and delicious and sure to impress.

I made this, my first cheesecake, for Easter with my boyfriend's family. It looked and tasted fabulous. I told my eight months pregnant sister about it, and she begged me to make one for her. So I will be returning her springform pan tomorrow with a big yummy chocolate cheesecake in it. This cake is huge and will serve at least 20. Like others I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and about 3/4 of a stick of butter. This cheesecake made ME look good!

I agree with all the below, so I will not repeat-but this is extremely delicious, a true rich dark chocolate cheesecake. I revised the recipe to make 8 mini cheescakes by baking for 48 minutes at 350. I also used 2 packages of chocolate graham crackers-which would have worked if I doubled the butter, but using 1/2 stick had the crusts crumbly. I also added macadamia nuts to the crust, and used mini aluminum pie tins. To serve, drizzle raspberry sweet sauce and chocolate sauce on the plate, invert tin and "pop" out cake upside down-I omitted the topping by using the sauces. The recipe is true to form-when the tops are dry, you are done! Will make again.

Delightfully creamy and rich. Gorgeous, delicious dessert. Just a sliver because it's too rich? yeah, right! Didn't see that happen last night...

I prepared this recipe as directed, with the exception of the crust. I'm never able to find chocolate wafers in my local stores, so I substituted 1 package from a box of chocolate HoneyMaid graham crackers. The ganache on the top seemed like too much while spreading it over the cheesecake, but beleive me, it's not. The sweeter ganache helps to lighten the very heavy bitter-sweet filling. I used Baker's 70% bittersweet chocolate bars (a special limited edition item)and Hersey's Special Dark Dutch-Process cocoa powder. It received rave reviews from all... a decadent, rich, and impressive dessert! Suitable for even the most formal of occassions!

I made this for my friend's birthday and everyone loved it. Even while making it, the batter tasted delicious. I used Valhrona chocolate, and a cocoa graham cracker crust for the bottom. I only baked it about 48 minutes because the edges were getting little cracks. It was done and had the best texture when we ate it. The texture was mousse like in the center and more cheesecake at the edges. So good!

I made this cake for guests at a holiday gathering and everyone loved it. It is very rich and impressive looking, and not difficult to make. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.I am thinking of making it again as dessert for our wine tasting party this month. I think it would go nicely with rasberries and a fine Port!

This was my first ever chocolate cheesecake - it was a great hit at a party I took it to. I made some changes:My store was out of the chocolate wafer cookies, so made a traditional graham cracker crust recipe. I used a 10" pan only for the purpose of being able to get more slices for a large group - I cooked it at 340 for 55min. For the filling, I used 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips and the other half a bitter sweet (I didn't have enough bittersweet). I wanted to be able to take this to the party without it being on the pan disc - knowing I probably wouldn't get it back - so cut a pc. of parchment about 1" larger than the pan bottom-buttered the pan bottom, topped with parchment and then buttered the parchment. When the cake had cooled and I removed the collar I was able to slide the cake off the disc holding on to the parchment - then slide onto a foil covered cardboard disc.After being in the fridge for 8 hrs I was able to slice it very neatly by running the knife blade under hot water and quickly drying off for each slice - got 24 slices with this pan size.Also - it is easier to make your chocolate curls directly onto the cake rather than try to transfer them. Great cake!!!

While I would certainly make this again, I was slightly disappointed given all of the rave reviews I read. This cheesecake is quite good, but in the end, it's just a good version of a chocolate cheesecake. In order to make it more interesting, I added some semisweet chocolate chips and cinnamon to the crust. I served the cake with raspberries drenched in Chambord and whipped cream. Perhaps the addition of some Chambord in the cheesecake itself would be nice...pretty rich cake, but definitely a worthwhile use for good chocolate!

I made this several times over the holidays and each time to rave reviews. People are still talking about it. Be sure not to overbake (as I did the first time) as the cheesecake will lose its creamy mousselike texture. I used Hershey's "gourmet" line of baking chocolate and it came out great.

I have made this three times in the past two months and have gotten raves each time. I did feel after the first time that there was too much topping, so the second time I made the whole batch but didn't use it all. The third time I reduced everything - 4 oz. chocolate, 1/2 cup cream, 2 tsp. sugar - perfect! I am impatient so the second time I made it I used medium heat to melt the chocolate for the topping - it didn't mix well and wasn't the prettiest presentation. Be sure to use low heat. And, apparently I'm a pig, because I can eat a decent sized piece and still want more! It is rich, but incredibly delicious. I will make this many more times, I'm sure.

Followed the recipe exactly for Christmas Eve dinner. Made Saturday, served Sunday, guests raved. I thought it was even better on Monday. I'll reduce the crust by about 1/3 from now on though.

Made this for a potluck of very particular eaters. The only substitution I made was to use marscarpone cheese instead of one of the cream cheese packages. It was perfect. It makes a great presentation. At one point I overheard people talking about the chocolate cheesecake and they were rushing to get some. My partner, who knows I get recipes at this site, said to give it at least 5 forks!!

I made this for a family gathering. I didn't bother getting the correct quantity of decent chocolate: I had a bunch of chocolate chips around, and used those along with about three ounces of a leftover 70% chocolate bar. I also used Hershey's cocoa, considering that's what I had. I also increased the crumb mixture and pressed some up the sides a bit as well. It looked magnificent; people asked me if I'd bought it or made it. Both the texture and flavor were impeccable; I'd say it's probably the best cheesecake I've ever made. And it got rave reviews!

This cheesecake won our annual dessert contest at work. Everyone absolutely loved it! I used 2 packages marscapone and 2 cream cheese instead of 4 cream cheese and liked the results. However, I didn't make the frosting on top because it looked like a little too much. Instead I used a pomegranate raspberry topping from a different recipe on Epicurious that everyone said worked perfectly with the dark chocolate. Both were very easy also. Will definitely make again.

Made this cheesecake for the family Thanksgiving gathering--a very particular group. All agreed that it was excellent--and small slice is all you need. Would definitely make this again as it makes an elegant presentation.

My rating is a little unfair as I subbed mascarpone for 3 of the four 8oz cream cheese packs. Otherwise prepped as written. Results were excellent.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. I omitted the ganache and topped the slices with rasberry sauce, as I felt it would balance the richness of the cake. The cheesecake is beautiful - perfectly smooth top with no cracks. The texture is amazing, sort of a cross between cheesecake and mousse. The flavor is rich but the texture is light, truly a pleasure to eat! It seemed like too much crust for the bottom of the pan, but it turned out to be perfect, not too thick and not too firm. A really special cheesecake, and a big hit with all of the family and friends at Thanksgiving dinner.

It is soooo good, sooo easy to make and we only tasted the sides and can't wait to dig in!

A very rich chocolate taste, it did not disappoint. However, in the future I will not use the same topping. I'd prefer something lighter to highlight the dark chocolate of the cake. I chilled the cake overnight, then put the topping on, and chilled again for an hour. Has anyone put the topping on & then chilled it altogether? Maybe it would sink in too much?

made this with 70% + 62% chocolate because that's all I could find and half lowfat cream cheese. It was still so rich that a small piece went a long way. This is really delicious, but it's way too rich. I probably won't make it again.

WOW! This cheesecake is fantastic. It is extremely rich, so take it easy. This is quite possibly the best chocolate experience I have had, and believe me, I've had many. This will go on my favorites list!

Not just a cheesecake, this is a religious experience. Serve this at a large dinner party and no one will ever forget it!

If you are a good cake slicer, you might get 30 servings out of this cake. It is incredibly rich...you really only need the smallest piece to be satisfied.

This was great, and really easy. I made a reduced fat/sugar version (2 fat free and 2 1/3 less fat cream cheeses, and 1 c splenda with the rest dark brown sugar) and no one knew the difference. I used chocolate bunny cookies (annie's brand) and threw in a small handful of melted choc chips into the crust mixture- it still seemed a little too crumbly after I blended it. The choc helped, and I added about 1/4 tsp. cinnamon just for some depth. The baking time was much less; only needed about 40-45 min, but I'm pretty sure it was probably the reduced fat/sugar (+ my oven). I used ghiradelli 60% choc..Great recipe, and very easy.

This was fabulous - one of the richest cheesecakes I've made. You can only have 1 sliver at a serving. I did substitute 3 pkgs. of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was still sinfully rich. I doubt anyone would be able to tell the difference. Very DENSE and creamy. YUM. I couldn't find the Scharff. chocolate so used Lindt 70%.
