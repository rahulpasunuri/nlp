I always have trouble making these kinds of dishes thicken up. So I asked a chef where I worked, and he said you must make it thick before putting it in the oven. So I simmer the potatoes and cream (you can't substitute low-fat if you want it creamy) and broth and fennel on the stovetop until it is nearly the right consistency, then put it in the casserole dish, add cheese or whatever topping, and cook. Obviously it takes much less time in the oven, but the results have been spectacular.

I made this as written, but as others have said, it had a huge amount of extra liquid. I even left it in the oven for a full hour and a half, and allowed it to set for half an hour afterward. The cheese did nasty things--it didn't incorporate well, so there were gluey layers of cheese.It tasted OK, but not great. I wouldn't make this again.

I've made 2 times using half the liquid stated in the recipe and both times there has been too much! Other than that, it is a fantastic alternative to scalloped potatoes. See my review (with pictures!) at http://bitterendive.blogspot.com

Really liked the flavour however the end product was very wet. Used yukon gold potato; will try a different variety next time. Used whipping cream and less stock than in the recipe but still wet. may try a thickener next time.

made this 2 times now and received great reviews. In both cases I omitted the potatoes and increased the amount of fennel, leeks and cheese. Give it a try if you're a fennel and leek lover.

I've tested out a few gratins lately and this is by far the best. Used Yukon Golds instead of red potatoes. Love the added depth of the fennel and leeks. YUM.

A rich, easy dish that has paired well with lamb, pork and beef so far. A comfort food that is perfect for company. The flavors work really well together. Made as written - delicious!

I found this recipe to be watery and lacking in taste. I was disapointed.

I made this for an Easter potluck with ham as the main course. Here are a few changes from previous suggestions and my own. I sauteed the leeks, set them aside and then sauteed the thinly sliced fennel in butter. It carmelized as it softened and I deglazed the pan with chicken broth twice. I didn't count that in the chicken broth I added to the cream and followed the 1/2 cup broth from an earlier review. I also added some gruyere cheese and layered leeks, potatoes, fennel, cheese, leeks, fennel, potatoes cheese,creme/broth. It was sensational, and from sauteeing the fennel had a deep complex caramel flavor and aroma, but wasn't really sweet. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is excellent. However I had to improvise since the store only had 1 fennel bulb left. Layer as potato, cheese, fennel, cheese, leeks, cheese, potato, cheese. Then reduce the chicken stock and had to cook it 20 minutes longer than recipe called for. Delicious!

My family found this recipe to too watery. I like the ingredients (leeks, fennel), but I guess I was expecting something more creamy and satisfying!

This is fabulous! I used baking potatoes instead of redskin, since its a gratin, and reduced the chicken broth to 1 cup. I also cooked for about 1 hour and 40 minutes since the filets weren't ready. Very yummy! everyone loved it!

Fabulous! I followed the quantities of the cream/stock suggested by Sally of Westminster, CA and cooked it for approx. 90 minutes. It was very, very good. And perfect for a Thanksgiving meal.

This recipe is fantastic. It is now a standard for holidays and special events with family and friends. The legend of this dish grows each time it is served.

This was great and super easy. Due to other ingredient constraints, I had too much liquid and it didn't all absorb, but was still stellar. Watch that liquid/ solid ratio and cut back if using fewer potatoes and fennel.

This dish was a winner for my family and will no doubt become a tradition, especially for the holidays. I made it for thanksgiving and it has already been requested for Christmas and New Years dinners. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! A hearty, but not too rich, vegetable dish. Great with just a salad or as a side dish for more elaborate meal.

I am not sure what happened to mine. I think the sauce broke. I used half and half as other reviewers said it worked for them. The combination of flavors was good, but it looked terrible. So I will probably not make this again. I will try a different gratin.

This was a yummy gratin. Served it for Easter dinner with a beef tenderloin with wild mushroom/red wine sauce. I followed previous reviewers liquid ratios and used 1 cup homemade chicken broth, 1/4 cup cream and 1/2 cup fat free half & half. Just couldn't use all of that fat with all cream. Also used about 1 cup finely chopped fennel vs. using slices, sauteed with the leeks and used in the layers. Baked 90 minutes, last 30 covered with foil. Will defnintely make again!

Be sure to use low salt broth or make your own, the cheese adds a lot of salt. I auditioned this recipe two weeks ago and it was great! It is going on the Thanksgiving table this year!

After reading the reviews, I really expected more from this dish. It was just okay. I love leeks and fennel and followed the recipe and suggestions exactly. Unfortunately it wasn't the hit at my thanksgiving but the beans with marjoram and almonds from this site were.

Absolutely phenomenal. Use only 1 cup broth and 3/4 cream for best results. I prepared this with Easter ham and it was the hit of the dinner. I believe it would be even better with roasted or grilled red meats, such as leg of lamb or roast beef. Even if you think you don't like the taste of anise, try this. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

I wanted to try fresh fennel, since I have never cooked anything with it before and I love to try new things. I found this recipe, read the reviews, prepared it, and cut "only" the chicken broth to 1 cup. DELICIOUS!!!

Great recipe. Used 1 cup stock only and 3/4 cup cream and it came out perfectly!

A really wonderful dish and a great accompaniment to roast pork (with garlic and fennel seed). We loved it. Will cut down the broth to 3/4 - 1 cup as was a little runny. Cooked for 1 hour, 20 minutes.

This is a delicious side dish. I baked longer than suggested since there was so much liquid in the pan. However, I ended up draining a lot off before serving since I couldn't get the liquid to evaporate in the oven. Nice combination of veggies.

This is a very nice blend of flavors. I added vidalia onions and subsituted whole milk for the whipping cream. This dish was a little runny but still delicious. Great with Roast Turkey!

Our family loves fennel, so this was a huge hit. Even goes well with the leftovers! I love the fact that it calls for the fronds, too.

Awesome. This dish was the "hit" of our Thanksgiving. Only one thing I did differently. I did not peel the potatoes. Saves time, and tasted great.
