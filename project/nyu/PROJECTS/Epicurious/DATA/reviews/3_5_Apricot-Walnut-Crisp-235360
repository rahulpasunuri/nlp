I have made this more times than I can remember. I use mostly peaches or nectarines even plums as I too have difficulty finding fresh apricots. This a winner.

I found the ratio of fruit to topping about right. This really needs ice cream or whipped cream to balance the fruit flavor. I love the oats and walnuts!

Very nice. I think my apricots were a little tart but the sweet vanilla ice cream gave it the right balance. Maybe a little too much topping - the ratio of fruit could go a little higher. Definitely would make again.

Have made this twice - once with peaches and once with nectarines since apricots are more difficult to get. Increased fruit to 3 and 1/2 pounds. since we like higher proportion of fruit to topping. Also used Splenda for 1/2 the sugar in the filling. Used the brown sugar Splenda as directed for topping. Results were excellent. Everyone raved!
