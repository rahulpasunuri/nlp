I made this to serve as a dip for crudites, and was disappointed as the flavours did not compliment my fresh veggies well at all. It was much better on pita and crackers, but I didn't care for the mayonnaise base. Perhaps I will try substituting yogurt in the future.

I made this recipe for my ex-wife and her fiance whom I had to have over for dinner because of a wedding in the family. The food was great, a lot better than the company. I would definately use this one again. Here's a tip: Make really quick food when you have guests that you really don't want hanging around.
