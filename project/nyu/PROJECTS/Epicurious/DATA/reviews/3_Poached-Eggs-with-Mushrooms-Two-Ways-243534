Won't do this again, ever. Made it exactly as written. I barely give it one fork.

Made this for brunch and served on top of a mix of baby salad leaves and sliced beetroot. Tsated great and a nice variation on poached eggs. As others have said, check mushrooms at 20 minutes. Easy to prep and cook.

A recipe with a lot of potential. The roasting conditions are too long and/or too high a heat. The mushrooms were fully roasted in half the time. No more than 15-20 minutes is sufficient. Served this over a dressed bed of baby argula. Delicious!!

Superb dish!!!! the toasted cumin seeds just put it over the top. SO good I made it 3 times in one week and everyone raved about it

This was a surprising and delicious supper--although it sounds light, I found it quite filling, with 3/4 lb. mushrooms per person. I used both white and cremini mushrooms, and the taste was deep and delicious. Don't roast the mushrooms more than 12 minutes if you slice them as thinly as described in the recipe or they will burn. I used just a splash of red wine vinegar, and I did not use the cumin because I had fresh sage, so I included the chopped sage as garnish. I recommend poaching the eggs a bit longer since my husband did not care for the runny egg yolks.

It didn't occur to me or my guests that this was a meatless dish until it dawned on us later in the day. The two preparation methods for the mushrooms produced great variety, and who knew those boring white mushrooms could get so dark and mysterious? This, with a salad, makes a very sophisticated brunch that we'll be repeating often.

This was a delicious vegetarian dinner. Used more interesting mushrooms than white-chanterelles and other local wild mushrooms. It was really good and my 3-year old loved it.

A glorious dish which, in the French way, is intended as a light meal rather than a breakfast dish. The earthiness of the mushrooms perfectly balance the richness of the egg yolk. The mushrooms also make a delicious topping for grilled chicken.

This is a solid dish... only had the mushrooms in the oven for about 20-30 minutes so they wouldn't get too dry. I also added some sage to the recipe. This dish works better if you plan ahead. I made the mushrooms the previous day and then used it for breakfast with the poached eggs. At that point cooking time was 10 minutes.

This was an OK recipe but I am not sure I would make it again. The roasted mushrooms did not take any where near 40 minutes to cook. I did two batches and the first were a bit too done. They continue to dry and crisp after you take them out of the oven so dont wait for all the liquid to be gone. I used cilantro instead of the parsley because I had some to use up. It was a good match with the cumin. I was not crazy about the red wine vinegar taste if I ever make it again I think I will try a different vinegar or maybe a little Worcestershire Sauce.
