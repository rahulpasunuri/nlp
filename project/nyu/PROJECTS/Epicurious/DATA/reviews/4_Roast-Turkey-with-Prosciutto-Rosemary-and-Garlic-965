This recipe was both easy and well written. This is my best Thanksgiving turkey...ever! The gravy was to die for and everyone was thrilled. Don't change a thing on this one, it's delicious as written.

OMG!!!!! This is THE best Turkey recipe ever!!!!! I made this for the first time a few years ago and I was stunned as to how well it came out!!!! It's a demand each Thanksgiving now =) I add lemon and thyme to the cavity when cooking for a bit extra flavor, but follow everything else to a T =)

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner agreed this was the most flavorful, moist, turkey we've ever had (and yes my mother and father were in attendance!). Needless to say it was a huge hit and we'll be making it again next year!

I have made this turkey for the past 5 years and EVERYONE loves it! I make the Itialin sausage stuffing to go with it. The best turkey ever...flavorful and moist.

Most flavorful turkey we've ever eaten. Could have been that the turkey was an heirloom variety that a friend raised--but this recipe was absolutely wonderful. The prosciutto and rosemary were key elements. Couldn't wait to add the chopped prosciutto to the gravy but it seemed too overwhelming in the end so we left it out, offering it on the side. Will definitely make again.

Undeniably the best turkey I have ever made. The prosciutto adds a wonderful flavor to the meat. Thanks epicurious!

This will be the fourth Thanksgiving in a row that I have been specifically requested to roast this bird

I have been making this recipe since it first came out. I love it!!! I don't often make a whole turkey, or the gravy, but the under-the-skin prep is *magic* with roast chicken! Gives the recipe just enough salt, plenty of garlic, and a wonderful rosemary flavor. I can't recommend it highly enough. I usually do the bird-in-an-oven-bag routine, and it's always falling apart tender and moist.

On our first family thanksgiving in our first home in 1999, this was what I made. My father-in-law pulled me aside and told me it was the best he had ever had, just don't tell his wife! I use only an organic, free-range turkey (worth the extra cost) and brine the bird overnight. It's the juciest and tastiest turkey I've ever had. Make a bigger bird than you think you'll need, the leftovers won't be around for long!

Amazing. The first turkey I have ever made for Thanksgiving in 1999 and it was so moist and very flavorful. Wonderful recipe.

While this turkey tasted good, I don't think I would make it again. The gravy came out really salty so I suggest making sure you add a lot of pan juices maybe thinned with chicken broth. It was pretty good, just not great.

Like the Modesto family, this has been our Thanksgiving recipe since 1995. I double the amount of broth to baste with - it seems to keep the turkey much more moist. And, we do it on the grill in a pan to keep the oven open inside. Try it with a robust Pinot Noir - Gallo of Sonoma, Sanford, or some other well-extracted (redder and deeper than most) pinots. Great recipe, and a fan favorite!

As transplants to California with no family nearby, we surround ourselves with several dozen friends each Thanksgiving. For the past 4 years, this has been our turkey recipe and has met with wild reviews! The prosciutto seals in the turkey breast juices, and the garlic and rosemary season the meat and eventual gravy with a wonderfully aromatic flavor. EXCEPTIONAL!
