Great recipe. I made a few changes to accommodate what I have in the pantry. Instead of apple cider, I used orange juice. I just love the way orange juice tastes as it reduces and it worked very well here. Additionally, I didn't have any cloves, so I substituted allspice and nutmeg. I don't know how the original recipe should taste, but for me the flavor was great and got lots of good complements. When I ground the ingredients, I put them in a processor until it produced a relatively fine powder. There were little tiny bits of pepper still left, but everything else was smooth. I did used ground cinnamon rather as a stick.

The first time I made this I used apples, and I liked the overall taste, but I found that the spices weren't finely ground enough. I used a coffee grinder, as most of these particular spices are too hard for a mortar & pestle. Even after several minutes in my coffee grinder, there were still large bits that I kept having to spit out. I loved the spiced caramel, though, so I wanted to try again. I made it again tonight - this time with pears instead of apples - and I sprinkled the spices through a sieve before putting them on the pears. I liked the combination of the pears and spices, even though I was using apple juice instead of pear juice. I did add a tablespoon of Poire William. I don't mind grinding my own spices, but I don't think it would suffer at all from pre-ground spices. I don't normally like pepper in sweets (or anything, really), but I did like it in this. This dish also reheats well.

The caramel made with the cider-juices makes the dish. It hardens on teh ice cream in the nicest way. I bake some puff pastry circles and serve the apples on these edible "plates" -- makes it go over a little more. (And I, too, use store-ground spices.)

Made this to end a "company" dinner and guests enjoyed it. I must confess, however, I used pre-ground spices (I have no doubt it would have been even better if I'd ground them myself) and left out the star anise as it is not a taste I like very much. The pepper was a terrific element, though.

the pepper is an unhappy addition to the spices. There are too many apple recipes to waste lovely Golden Delicious apples on this one.

Great taste and simple to make

This was a lovely dessert for a winter night. The lushness of apple pie, but without the heavyness of the crust.

A great dessert - perfect for the fall and winter. I substituted store ground cinnamon and anise flavoring and it still came out really well. Rave reviews from all of my guests!!

I had not used my coffee grinder for spices before, and was pleased with the results. This is a delicious, aromatic, and satisfying desert, with complex, interesting flavors. It is also fairly easy to prepare.

This made a surprisingly easy yet special Christmas dessert. The hardest part was finding the star anise. I ended up substituting anise seed instead. It came out great. I can't wait to try it with the star anise!
