I have made this recipe many times and just looked it up again for a big family dinner. It doubles well and is a reliable receipe. I have made it without the chicken broth for vegetarians and it is fine (just factor in some additional liquid). I have also added mushrooms and artichoke hearts to the sauce to rave reviews.

This is one of my all time favorite pastas. My mom used to make it for me when I was a little girl. It is time consuming because the sauce has to reduce, but well worth it in my opinion.

I made this dish when it first appeared and have been enjoying it ever since. In fairness to those who have found it less than wonderful... not all ingredients are created equal. The quality of what you use greatly changes the results. Bland broth and anemic looking watery tomatoes just won't cut it, and from experience I've found that broth from Trader Joe's adds richness , and their plum tomatoes have great taste and texture. On occasion I've used other cheeses with success, however I still prefer this recipe just as it is!

Rating: 3
This wasn't a super exciting dish and I would reduce the red pepper by 1/2 tsp. However, unlike some other pasta dishes I have made the prep work is a snap (you have to plan ahead because the sauce needs to simmer but the actual cutting/grating time is minimal). It also is a recipe that would be a good base for being creative and adding vegetables and/or meat that could make it more interesting.

This is one of my favorite all time recipes. It serves a crowd. I freeze leftovers in foil up to 2months and it's still delicious. Also a great alternative to lasagna in a buffet.

I really wanted to LOVE this recipe--it has lots of my favorite things in it. While we liked it fine, it wasn't what I had hoped--the end result was just your basic cheese/pasta/tomato sauce casserole. I'd rather spend my time and calories on something with more panache.

This is so good. I halved the recipe since there are just the two of us, and we still have tons of leftovers which my husband and I are looking forward to eating. I used tomatoes that I had frozen from last summer's garden, and they worked out perfectly.

probably 3.5 forks. its very easy and very good...i've been making since the magazine came out 15 years ago!!! scary. to winter....from zurich: i think fontina would work, its not as pungent of a cheese as havarti, but the texture of both is similar...try it!

I first found this recipe in 1995 in Bon Appetit. I loved it and made it often for guests. Especially those that were vegetarians. Over the years I misplaced it and truly missed it. When I joined Epi I decided to take a shot and look it up. I was thrilled to get it back. This is a simple recipe to feed a crowd, I agree with past reviews this feeds more like eight. Kalmata olives are much easier to find than they were 13 years ago. Don't change a thing, you won't be disappointed and take the time the recipe calls for on the sauce, it will condense and is much richer.

Rating: 2
If there were 1/2 forks, I'd give it 2 1/2 forks. It is quite good, but not exceptional. Other than the Havarti, the ingredients are usually staples that I have on hand, so I'd definitely make it again... but I didn't feel it was anything more special than an easy weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
I have been making this dish for 13 years. It is a family favorite. I use only about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to saute the onions and skip mixing oil into the cooked pasta. I just immediately combine the sauce with the drained pasta. In addition, I use light havarti cheese. I also use only about 1/3 of the cayenne pepper and it is plenty spicy! You can substitute vegtable broth to make it vegetarian. It easily serves 6 to 8 people with hearty appetites.

Great recipe, alwyas a crowd favorite.You can vari the ingredients to suit your tastes by adding different cheeses, sausage, chicken etc. You will be glad you did. Make ahead and freeze if you like. Kids eat this for several days as a meal in of itself.

I also have been making this for years and it is always a hit. A cut above your regular baked ziti. It does have heat becasue of the red pepper so be aware of that and modify according to your taste. Don't substitute another cheese for the havarti. That helps make it special.

I love this recipe and am going to make it for our NFL playoff party this year. I would agree that it feeds 12 people easily, and add that it also keeps well so if you're looking for a meal to stretch the week, this is a good candidate. Plus, the flavors blend together the longer it sits - yum! I can't stress how important it is to coat the pasta in evoo before you put it in the oven, and also rec substituting the chicken broth with white wine. I never use havarti. I like mine spicy, so I use a bit of cayenne in the sautee, and sub in some jalapeno jack. Finally, I top it off with a good italian sausage. Always a hit! Enjoy! :^)

Rating: 4
I have made this previously but this time I incorporated some of reviewer's suggestions. First - this recipe serves 12 generously and the recipe should be corrected. I added 1 lb of turkey sausage, 1 pound of Havarti cheese and used the tomato juice and red wine in place of the chicken broth. If you put this together the night before, I would only cook the pasta for a few minutes as you need to cook it for 1 hour the next day after bringing it to room temperature and that will cook the pasta.

Rating: 4
This was really easy and tasty! Hubs raved! I made it last night, with some modifications: whole wheat pasta (this sauce can stand up to it). I skipped the broth and used the juice from the tomatoes and red wine instead. I didn't realize until after I started cooking that the sauce was supposed to simmer for over an hour and I didn't have that kind of time, so I boiled it at full blast for about 20-25 mins instead and it was great! Next time I would cook a lower temp for recommended time as I am sure that the flavors are even more developed that way. Also, the store was out of regular havarti, so I had to buy "light" havarti, but it worked really well. Next time might take an immersion blender to the sauce--I thought it was a bit too chunky for baked pasta. Will def make again.

Have been making this for years, but haven't looked at reviews since I first made and rated it...until now. As suggested, I substituted one cup red wine for i cup chicken broth, and sauteed one pound of sewwt Italian sausage. Then I decided to omit the red pepper. Best idea I 've ever had. The heat of the pepper masked the wonderful Italian herbs. Iyalian food is not meant to be hot, it is meant to be flavorful. Now all those wonderful herbs and spices are coming through. Try it, you will not be disappinted

I have made this several times as written and it is always a big hit. This past weekend I incorporated some the of reviewer suggestions and an amazing dish tasted even better! I added a pound of cooked sausage, upped the garlic to 1 tablespoon, used three tablespoons fresh minced basil as opposed to the dried and replaced the two cups of chix stock with one cup red wine and one cup saved juices from the tomatoes. I grated about 3/4 pound of Havarti and was extremely generous on the amount of olives, basil and parm added at the end. Delicious either way.

Great dish. Suggestions: Use Italian plum tomatoes as called for; try 1 tsp red pepper flakes to start; use 1 tsp real chicken base + 1 cup water in place of 2 cups broth. I use a generous 1/2 lb. Havarti; buy pitted Kalamatas (available in some deli sections) to save time; try 1/2 cup Parmesean.

Fantastic! Just made it tonight and it was wonderful! I really liked the Kalamata olives and red pepper flakes: it gave the everyday cheesy, saucy red sauce something different.

Will definitely be a keeper. Thanks Epicurious!

I have made this dish many times. It always turns out much better when you make the sauce the night before. I add some richness to this dish by replacing half the Havarti for Ricotta. I also replace some of the chicken stock with red wine, and am even a little liberal on the kalamata olive brine. The sauce definitely makes the dish, but excessive amounts of really fresh basil doesn't hurt either.

I make this dish all the time. Once, I couldn't find havarti cheese and substituted mozzarella--and I liked the results even better! I always make it that way now. Also, I've started mixing a bag of baby spinach leaves into the pasta before spreading it in the baking dish, and it's delicious. When time is short, use a good jar of sauce instead of making your own--it turns this into an incredibly quick and easy weeknight dinner.

And there's plenty in the fridge left for tonight!

Definitely make this. I made a few changes per comments. Added about 3/4 pound crumbled sauted Italian sweet sausage, doubled the olives and fresh basil & added the rigatoni to the sauce without tossing with olive oil(absorbs the sauce). Also, my grater disappeared so I diced Havarti, about 1/2 inch and eyeballed the amount needed. A little more parmesan on top. Probably richer, but so very, very delicious. I planned for my 89 year old mother to eat this so I baked hers in a separate dish with NO red pepper. I only used 1/2 tsp in ours. Next time I will grate the cheese and use the proper amount of red pepper in our portion.

I also have been making this recipe for years. It is one of my husband and mine's favourites. I have made a few changes over the years, I usually add 1 lb of crumbled Italian sausage when I sauted the onions, more garlic, add a little bit of sugar to reduce the acid from the tomatoes, I use the reserved juices from the canned tomatoes instead of chicken broth and always increase the cheese. One of my girlfriends says her mom, who was from Sicily, used to make a dish just like it! You can't get a better compliment than that!

Add a good handful (not a mere tsp) of minced garlic a couple of minutes after you start sauteeing the onions, add a good splash of wine when you pour in the tomatoes, use loads of fresh basil, don't bother with the second addition of olive oil, and up the amount of olives, and this recipe is ace.

The February 1995 issue of Bon Appetite is ragged and worn. The cover is torn and barely hanging on. But after moving 3 times ive kept this issue soley for this recipe. It is one of the first dishes I made for my then girlfriend (now wife). I think this is the reason she married me.:) The havarti and olives along with the heat of the red pepper make this one of the best pasta dishes ever. I was delighted to see how many people are still using this recipe. Try it and you wont be disappointed.

Made this for a potluck and it was a big hit. An attendee who didn't know I'd contributed it proclaimed ,"the pasta dish is a real winner." I think that next time I'd scale back a bit on the red pepper. And I didn't have low-salt broth, so used regular and it was a bit salty. Might also be tempted to add additional cheeses and olives next time. The fresh basil is a great touch. The cheese-olive-basil topping makes for a very appealing look.

Looks like I'm the only one who had difficulty with this recipe. I found the sauce very bland - especially with the addition of the broth, and it took forever to reduce.

Havarti is a soft cheese and this makes it so much easier...also added 1-2 tbsp.of sugar to the sauce,; it cuts the acidity of the tomatoes. A friend just asked me what she could bring to a potluck that she is invited to and was so excited when I steered her to the website and this recipe

I substituted mozzerella and it was delicious. I lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees and covered the dish with foil for the first 20 minutes so that the penne would not dry out. I saved some of the mozzerella to mix with the parmesan for sprinkling on top. I made half the recipe, which was enough to divide into three individual gratin dishes. I thought the sauce was delicious, a zillion times better than bottled stuff. I would use this sauce on other dishes.

This is a recipe that my husband likes to use when he cooks for me, so I usually have the wonderful pleasure of enjoying this delicious meal without having to do any of the work.My whole family enjoys this dish (even my two young sons.) Using good Kalamatas is a key, and I do not recommend substituting mozarella for the havarti. Mozarella can be too "stringy" for this recipe.

I was excited to try this recipe when I read all the reviews. Although I am usually interested in other reviewers' variations, I usually stick pretty close to the exact recipe the first time I try it. This time, I followed it to a T. And I was disappointed with the results. While certainly edible, and not bad in any way, this dish wasn't particularly enjoyable. I didn't think it was any better than similar dishes I've made with bottled pasta sauce and pre-shredded mozzarella. It sounded like a good dish, but ended up not being worth the extra work for me. I always wonder about the lonely dissenters for these very popular recipes...oh well, this time it's me!

Fantastic beyond belief! I would go as far as to say addictive. I never rate recipes so the mere fact that I'm taking the time to do so should be indicative of how seriously superb this recipe is.

Fantastic recipe. I used the Havarti, despite my suspicions, and am glad I did. Melts beautifully and tastes great. Also added a bit more olives than the recipe called for, and just threw them into the mix. Finally, I probably used 1.5 tablespoons of red pepper flake to insure a nice kick. Assembled weeks ahead of time, froze it, defrosted one day in the fridge, and it still came out perfectly. I like that it had no meat in it, as I served it alongside a nice pork roast and a big green salad. Super and filling do-ahead meal. By the way, the recipe feeds far more than 4.

I did not have a hard time finding a jar of pitted Kalmata olives, and they really do make the dish. I added a little red wine to my sauce, and also some Fontina cheese along with the Havarti. My husband and I both loved it, and it re-heats very well the next day.

I always get rave reviews on this dish too. I add fontina chz & sometimes a variety of veggies & even tofu cubed into tiny pieces for added nutrition. I've also added chopped green olives along w/ the kalmata just for kicks. Good w/ & w/o those additions! MMMMMMM!!

I have made this receipe since it first appeared on the cover. I have added Italian sausage and used canned olives as well. Guests just rave about it. It freezes well after it is cooked.

Outstanding recipe! I cut the amount of Havarti in half to reduce the fat content without compromising flavor. You also don't miss the 3 tbsp of olive oil (mixed in with the cooked pasta) when omitted. Our family's all-time favor dish.

This is one of my favorite dishes! It's very easy to prepare and it always gets rave reviews when we have guests. Personally, I prefer it a bit less spicy so I cut back the red pepper. Hint for pitting the olives... Lay them out on your cutting board and press with a flat object such as the bottom of a glass. Once they are squished, it's easy to pick out the stones.

I can't begin to tell you how many guests have asked for this recipe. It is simply the best pasta dish, EVER! I do substitute the canned olives for the kalamata (out of laziness), and it still turns out great! Its a keeper!

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic pasta! For a spicier sauce, increase the red pepper flakes and the garlic. The extra oil added to the pasta makes it too greasy. I'm too lazy to pit and chop the kalamata olives so I've always used can chopped olives and the recipe is still great. This is an easy recipe to cut in half and still feed at least 4 people.

I Love this recipe. It's great in the winter.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. A few suggestions: if you have a low tolerance for a hot (spicy) taste, cut back on the red pepper flakes and double the kalamata olives, they add an awesome flavor. I will make again with these revisions. By the way, this dish could easily feed 6 people.

Just yummy! And it looked beautiful too. Finally a pasta dish that looks and tastes as good as our favorite Italian restaurant. (I left out the olives and I only used half the red pepper flakes so my kids would eat it.)

I reviewed this recipe over and over in an attempt to figure out what was so special - it just seemed like a simple sauce, olives, and cheese. I decided to give it a try based on all the great reviews - and it was WONDERFUL!

Very good!

i've made this dish a dozen times now so it's obviously a favorite. always make the sauce a day in advance as it adds to the flavor and lessens prep time. try replacing the havarti with 2 parts ricotta, 1 part monterey. and of course, don't skimp on the olives or red pepper.

Since I discovered this dish, I've made it many times - everyone raves! Now, when I make it, I make sure to have printed copies of the recipe handy because someone always asks. The sauce can be prepared ahead which makes it perfect for entertaining.

I love this recipe, and am so glad that it is available on the net as a couple times I have been out of town and have been able to make it by downloading the recipe. This is a great dish for a dinner party, and becomes the centerpeice of any dinner. It is a tasty concoction, and children love it too. I do usually add more basil throughout the recipe, but that is probably more of a personal preference than anything else.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish several times, and have always received rave reviews. Even from my meat eating husband. It must be the Kalamata olives. I'm an olive nut, and usually can't pass up any recipe when they are included. I too cut back on the amount of olive oil, use diced tomatoes and of course, add extra Kalamata olives. This recipe makes a lot, so be sure to have a hearty appetite!

Excellent. Made it as an appetizer for our supper club. It has now become a regular on our "favorite meals" list.

Great recipe - always requested by my husband. I usually mix the havarti with jack cheese (a little less costly and no noticeable taste difference) and put a lot more in! Don't skimp on the red pepper and put a lot more basil in, too! Yum!!

This is one of my favorite recipe's to serve at a dinner party. You can increase or decrease the amount of spice in the recipee for your guests, it is prepared ahead of time and different. I lost the recipe before a dinner party and found it back here on the web and am eternally greatful!!!

The best things about this recipe were the kalamata olives and havarti cheese. Even with the addition of the two, the recipe was nothing special. I wanted to give the recipe a try since it received such rave reviews. I guess I'm just harder to impress. Sorry guys.

This is a family favorite! I usually cut down on the oil and add more cheese with better results.

I don't know what we were expecting but we were disappointed. The casserole had a nice flavor but there are so many other pasta dishes we would rather have that are much lower in fat. I will suggest to use chopped tomatoes, or cut-up the plum tomatoes before adding them to the onions and garlic. Crushing them with a spoon just wasn't happenin'. Also, be sure to drain the tomatoes very well. This serves more like 6+. I will not be making this again.

Delicious dish! Everyone in the family liked it. Makes enough that all 4 of us had it again the next night. I substituted light Havarti and vegetable broth to make it lighter and vegetarian. Still delicious!

I made this several months ago and we really liked it. Had some leftover frozen roasted red pepper/garlic puree so added that to sauce. Cooked sauce a bit longer than indicated. Good all-around pasta recipe.

This was such a delicious meal! I made it for company and everyone loved it and wanted to have the recipe. I made the recipe just as it was, and really enjoyed it that way, but I would suggest using less hot pepper flakes for those who are sensitive to spice.

One of most delicious pasta dishes-tastes gourmet but super easy to make using premade Italian reciped tomatoes. I have been making this dish for last 4 years and it is superb every time. Make it for everyone including your fussy baby, starving teenagers, hard to please mother in law, family reunion, and your boss. Thankyou Bon Appetit for providing this wonderful recipe!!

I used someones suggestion and used an already made quality sauce from a jar. It was so good I talked about it to all my coworkers. Definitely a keeper!

I love this--it's always tasty, and on those "Oh my God, company's coming!" nights, you can cheat and use a quality sauce from a jar. The cheese combo works great, and my best friend's toddler loves it too! Sometimes I make it with a combination of Kalamata and good tart green olives, it works just as well.

Rating: 4
This is one of my top 10 best recipes! It is always a hit with company. I usually have to give out the recipe at the end of the night. It does take a long time to make the sauce, but it is definately worth it. I cut down the oil, and I used light havarti cheese(it's in most grocery stores).

YUMMY! I made this dish specifically for my two daughters (3 yrs & 1 1/2 yr) boy did they love it!! They had third helpings...my husband & I loved it as well (I went very easy with the hot pepper flakes). I will make this again and again.

This dish is certainly a hit in our home. We often add sliced roasted red peppers on top just before serving; adds an attractive touch.

Great recipe, but entirely too much red pepper flakes! The first time I made it my husband and I could hardly eat this dish. Subsequent times I reduced the red pepper flakes with wonderful results.

I know this recipe by heart. I have become known for it- it's a staple for friends with new babies, a recent move or other event as it is well-loved by the whole family. Kids even like the olives! I do agree that you can reduce the olive oil as well as the pepper flakes (but not much). I think the chicken broth IS important, and I usually use crushed tomatoes too.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is as good as a a specialty at one of our neighborhood resturants, Franconella's. I also used the juice from the tomatoes, and made all of the changes that Dayton, TN made. I also was able to reduce the olive oil to half.This will be a regular.

Rating: 4
Based on comments, I did it this way: twice the garlic, half the red pepper, twice the basil in sauce, diced tomatoes with juice, no broth, regular black olives in sauce as well as on top, mix of mozzarella/jack/colby mixed in. Whew! Great like this and will make it often.

I have made this dish for my family at least one a month since the recipe was originally published in Bon Apetit in 1995. I agree with the other reviewers who think the dish makes more than four servings. I usually make the full quantity and freeze half the recipe for a later meal. I agree that substituting tomato juice for chicken stock makes a lot of sense. What I really find amazing about this recipe is that family members who normally do not tolerate spicy food seem to really love this dish. Maybe the basil (I always double the quantity)is the perfect foil for the hot pepper? Who knows why, but it works for us.

I always change recipes a little bit, so here are the changes that really made the recipe an old stand-by for guests.... (1) Increase garlic to 4 cloves or more. (2) Decrease red pepper flakes by a little more than half. (3)Always use penne. I tried a smooth tube pasta and it didn't hold the sauce well and was less flavorful. (4)Substitute one can of crushed tomatoes for the other variety. I often take this dish and divide it into two casseroles...one for my family and one for friends under the weather. I always get a great response!!!!!

Very good. I have made this several times now, it serves closer to 8 than the suggested 4 but no worries it makes tasty leftovers. Instead of draining the tomatoes and adding the chicken broth, I kept the tomato juice and lost the broth therefore making a great vegetarian dish. I also added mushrooms and extra olives to the sauce as well as the olives at the end.

This pasta dish is absolutely wonderful. The whole family enjoyed it. I used 1 1/4 cup mozzarella and 1 1/4 cup monterey jack cheese instead of the havari. Next time, I will make the sauce a day early for the flavors to blend. The leftovers were excellent. I'll use less red pepper also.

Made this recipe when five of my grandchildren were coming for the weekend. Some of the little ones thought it too spicy for them, so would recommend if making this recipe that the red pepper flakes be reduced to 1/2 or l Tsp. instead of 1 1/2 as called for. It was just delicious and can't wait to make it for company again. Had a hard time not eating too much! Makes way more than enough for four servings!

This has been a long-time favorite in our household. Special enough for company and can be made ahead. I recommend making the sauce a day ahead to give the flavors time to blend. Add more garlic (we've used a whole bulb and not found it to be overpowering). Serve with a simple green salad tossed with a light viniagarette and crusty sourdough bread - and be sure to save the leftovers!! It's just as good the 2nd and 3rd day.
