I didn't realize you could make homemade marshmallow, and I took it to a dinner party and no one else had seen homemade marshmallow, either. It was beautiful when it was all put together, and using a blow torch is fun, but it was very sweet.

I can buy marshmallows at Trader Joe's, and would not make them, considering the reviewer who found this recipe to make marshmallows that flow, and the other who found this too sweet as the amount of sugar is prodigious. As for the difficulties of the website: the reviewer who found google of help is right; just set preferences on Yahoo!-which uses google search-to restrict the pop ups. This reduces the amount considerably. Secondly, I always copy any recipe and its reviews into a Microsoft Word document and save on my computer desktop as the too narrow copy is a pain at the website. Then I also make all changes needed to suit my allergies, and make the recipe more user friendly such as listing the ingredients for each step AT each step--and note that I've adapted the recipe. Good luck to all who are having difficulty with this.

Had this the first time at a bbq - outrageous was the word most people used. Had no problem with the toasting but have a lot of experience doing this under the broiler as a kid. We really liked to soft texture of the marshmallow, it's was gives it an adult, sophisticated edge. mike - NYC

I agree completely with the cook from IL; I've made marshmallow before and this was too soft and sticky. Cookies very tasty, chocolate idea very nice and overall idea was appealing but way too sweet.

A great twist on the old school version...excellent when you are no longer a child.

I made this for a special occasion, because the photo was so impressive. Toasting the marshmallows was very tricky, and they were melting and sliding off the cookie in the process. I used the recommendations as far as portion size was concerned which was entirely too big and rather sickening with such a large incredibly sweet piece of marshmallow. Gave me a headache after a few bites. The cookie alone was delicious, and the chocolate came out pretty--will use that idea again. Together, the dessert was too time consuming for the saccharine taste.
