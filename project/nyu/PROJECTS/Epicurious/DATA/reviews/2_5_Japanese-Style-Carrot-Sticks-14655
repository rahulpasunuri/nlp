I made this recipe for the first time last weekend and the carrots were swimming in sauce. If I make it again I would probably make half the sauce. I was not wowed by this recipe so it's not likely I will be making it again.

Very pretty with baby carrots. I garnished them with wasabi peas. A Ladies' Luncheon hit!

Very easy with baby carrots and a great addition to a cocktail party menu.

Yech - these were awful. I tasted one, forced my hubby to try one, and then threw them out.

Made this to accompany take-out sushi. They were perfect together.

There is NO way each serving could be 477cal. Each serving would contain 1 tsp sugar (at the most 16 cal). 1/2 c cooked carrots are 35 calories. Vinegar is virtually calorie-free. From whence did those 477 calories come?

Very easy and tasty. A great starter for the California Roll Salad. I also served edamame as an appetizer.

very easy to make and just unusual enough to be an interesting addition to a vegetable plate. even easier if made with baby carrots.
