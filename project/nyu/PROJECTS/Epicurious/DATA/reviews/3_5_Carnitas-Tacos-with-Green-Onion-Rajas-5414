I make the pork a little differently ... add an orange to the simmering pot as well as some onions and garlic. Finish the pork with a can of pepsi. however - the cheese sauce is phenomenal! It's absolutely killer made exactly as the recipe describes.

Made these for dinner tonight and they were excellent! Felt like the rajas were missing a little something, so I added just a touch of cumin and that did the trick. Other than the cumin, the recipe was followed to a tee. Absolutely delicious, would definitely make again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out pretty good. The green onion rajas could have used a little more heat, as the poblanos were too mild for my taste. To avoid separation, you have be sure to use heavy cream and put the heat to low when you add the cream and cheese. I'll probably crisp the shredded meat next time before serving and add some spices to the pork. All in all it was successful, everyone had seconds. I would make it again with a few minor improvements.

made it for my daughter's sleep over--she wanted tacos. Even the picky kids liked it. the carnitas was extremely tender. I added more spices after it cooked to punch up the flavor. The rajas was excellent. cooked it on very low heat to prevent separation. Leftovers reheated very well. Definitely on the short list for the family.

Easy to make and turned out great...kids loved it so it passed the test. We added a little bit of our favorite spices to give it some more flavor.

How many ways can you say yummy! I used boneless pork chops. This was so easy. The meat isn't real spicy, but it is flavorful, Served like a salad bar with salsa, cheese, cilantro and avocado, pico de gallo and sour cream. Let everyone make their tacos according to their own tastes. Everyone loved it! Made the meat a day ahead of time. Re-heated well.

There is such a better way of making this dish. Not real time consuming, but a little more complex of a dish that is worth the effort for the flavor. Don't cook the meat in just the broth; I roughly chopped a couple of medium sized yellow onions, thru in two whole jalapeno peppers and about ten garlic cloves or to taste, and some adobo paste, 3 lbs. of cubed boneless pork chops and let that simmer for an hour or so. Let the meat sit in the broth for a day or two and then discard the garlic cloves, jalapenos and juice. The onions should have mostly melted away and don't worry about discarding remains of onion. Lightly grease a cast iron skillet or any frying pan that you can put into the oven with whatever oil or lard you may like. Take the drained pork meat w/o garlic cloves or pepper and brown the pork meat to your liking; add a good amount of orange juice, yes, orange juice and several packages of Goya Sazon seasoning w/o Annatto, stir well and put pan into a 400 degree oven. Check and stir about every 10-15 minutes to keep all juices incorporated with the meat and reduces over browning of meat. When all liquid has reduced, serve with flour tortillas, quacamole, and your favorite red tomatoe pico salsa and sour cream if desired. I also love putting the pork meat into the flour tortilla, topping it with the pico salsa and some "Enchilada Cheese" that is made by Casique, a Mexican cheese vendor. A little quacamole only on the side not incorporated with the meat, cheese and tortilla. I love the flavor of the meat, cheese, salsa, and tortilla only. The meat freezes very well if you store the meat properly. I have a vacumn sealer and have pulled a package of this pork meat out of the freezer a year later, and it is great!!!! Just like what I got in Cabo San Lucas last year but a little better, because I didn't have to pay the airfare to Cabo!

If you want carnitas try: "CRISPY PORK WITH AVOCADO SALSA AND TOMATO SALSA" (Bon Appetit, May 2003) INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS! Even beats the local taquerias. Friends can't stop raving and asking for more.

Benicio, CA you are right on the money. We prefer your recipe with 1t real ground red chile powder, roasted green chiles, and blue corn tortilla. Except sometimes it doesn't make it into the tortillas...

The meat was wonderfully tender and juicy. Will definitely make again. I believe the reason for cubing the meat is that it cuts the cooking time and you get more even cooking (thus a more tender result). I'd rather not have to cube it, but it came out perfectly, I wouldn't change a thing. Served this on a buffet with sliced lime wedges. A keeper.

This is not carnitas. Get a good Mexican cookbook, Epicurious! My own version: take a good piece of pork, cover it with chicken or beef broth, add chopped garlic, onion, pepper (hot or sweet, your choice), tomato, a half teaspoon of chili powder (for gringos who don't like it too hot) some oregano and cumin. Cook pork until tender. It's good right out of the pot or fried as is the usual method to crisp it. Serve in warm authentic corn tortilla with avocado slices or just in its native state.

My family thought the recipe was bland. The meat texture was good but even with the poblano (pasilla) chilis it wasn't great. Much better after we added a good chipotle salsa. I also used a whole chipotle in the broth and it didn't add a thing. Leftovers were good as pulled pork sandwiches with a very spicy barbeque sauce

I have made this several times and always enjoy it. The poblano chilies are mild, so I also add some fresh jalepenos. I serve with fresh salsa, extra cheese and lots of lime juice. Very good.

Cubing the pork and then shredding it didn't make much sense to me - why wouldn't you just cook it whole and then shred? The meat was very tender, but something about the dish just didn't work for us. The sauce was thin and greasy, and not very flavorful. We took a few bites, looked at each other, then decided to go out for dinner.

Excellent! The meat had great flavor.

This recipe was great. I would make both parts again, not always together. The pork tasted great; we followed the advice of breifly pan frying it to get the crispy texture of traditional carnitas. The raja sauce was great. Very mild. To avoid the cream/cheese seperating in the raja sauce I removed the pepper/onion mix from the heat and then added the cream and cheese to the pan, stirred until well mixed and put in a serving dish. It would be good with other things or, with a slightly higher portion of peppers and onions, as a side. It is not very "saucy" as it is.

The meat recipe was excellent. I have never tasted such tender pork in my life. I would definitely cook the meet again. It is interesting that you can take an ok piece of meat and make it into something so tender and juicy. I am rating this only 2 forks because I felt that the Green Onion Rajas did not impress. The cheese and cream turned into a lumpy mess with the veggies and the cream separated. The cheese and the cream should be mixed separate of the veggies and maybe that would give it a better consistency. Stick with the meat and try adding salsa and cheese on top.

Wonderful and EASY! Didn't cube pork, just put in large pot whole, browned, then added liquid, onion & salt and pepper, cooked until done, cooled and shredded. I then sauteed pork in a very small amount of vegetable oil to get crisp, carnitas style pork, I also subsituted yellow onion for green ones, and rolled pork, rajas, squeeze of lime and homemade tomato/tomatilla salsa into flour tortilla (burrito style) Will be adding this to list of favorites!

I had to substitute for poblano chilis as for some strange reason no tienda in the area had poblanos. I used chipolte peppers in adobo sauce and it really gave a nice (though hot) smoky flavor. Also had some issues with using oil free corn tortillas - you must use the kind with oil in them! Aside from my own issues and mistakes this still turned out to be a great dish - I will have to try it again and get it right.

Excellent. My whole family enjoyed it -- even my picky kids. The meat was very tender and tasty and the rajas was (were?) delicious.

This was a great dish! I would definately make this again but I would add more spices to the meat filling. It is an easy dish to make.

The rajas makes this recipe. I would definitely make again. I made the carnitas, a liitle bland but the rajas helped. Would be better if carnitas had more flavor.

This one's a winner! I thought the meat was going to be bland, but it wasn't at all. The sauce was just delicious -- very tangy and different, but in a good way. We (lucky us) had leftovers, and the taste seemed to get better and better. We preferred eating it with corn tortillas vs. flour.

Delicious! I served this dish at an informal dinner party and it was very well received. The next time I make this dish I will not use the broth--is unnecessary. I also shredded the pork after it was cooked instead of cubing it first--it was so tender that it shredded easily!

i began this recipe with just a bit of trepidation, however, once i assemble all of the ingredients i found myself serving a real winner! instead of using the butter to saute the veggies i simply sweated them. i used chopped vidalia onion instead of scallion, but other than that i followed the recipe pretty faithfully, which is very hard for me. i give this a real thumbs up!!

This is one of my favorite recipes - very easy and delicious. My large family is very picky and it is almost impossible to please them all, but they love it!

I've made it 3 times. By now I don't cook the meat in chicken broth; right now I sauté the meat without oil until tender, that's because pork meat has a lot of fat.

The meat is tender and tasty, tasty, tasty.Although the rajas were good, they don't reheat well (oily).We make the meat and serve it with tortillas, avocadoes, tomatoes, green onions, sliced olives, etc.It takes time but no work.
