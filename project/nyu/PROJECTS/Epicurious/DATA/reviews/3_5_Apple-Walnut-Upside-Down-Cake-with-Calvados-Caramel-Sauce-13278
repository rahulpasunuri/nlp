I made this cake tonight, and it was delicious! i cut the butter down to a little over one stick and it worked out fine. My only problem was that the apples went to the sides, which looked very nice on the sides, but the top was ugly. Didn't much matter as i covered it up with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce - by the way, skip the recipe on caramel sauce - simply take a can of sweetened condensed milk and boil it unopened for 3 hours and voila - you have the most delicious caramel sauce and so simple to make!

Very good cake, liked it right up until I added the "sauce". I cut the sugar in the cake by a third, so after tasting it, I thought I'd give the sauce a try to add a bit more sweetness. I may have done something wrong, but it ended up being a hardened caramel coating instead of a sauce. I'd recommend finding a different recipe for actual caramel sauce -- there are many on this site that are far easier and more sauce-like.

I prepared the cake this weekend. I didn't have time to make the caramel sauce. It came out very well, different than I had expected. It was moist and delicious, the ginger added a special touch. I would recommend cramming a few more apple wedges on the bottom of the pan so that when you turn the cake upside down, there are more apple pieces to share.

I made this last night and it was quite good. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a ten-inch cake pan rather than a skillet. I used a micro-plane zester for the ginger, which made the pieces pretty much melt into the cake and left a good uniform ginger flavor throughout. I felt the cooking time was a little too long. When I flipped the cake, some of the apples and caramel was burnt and stuck to the bottom of the dish. But the cake itself was very soft and flavorful. The caramel sauce was awesome and definitely added to the dessert. I would make this again, but reduce the cooking time somewhat.

Made this for a progressive dinner party and it got good reviews - the caramel sauce was very good - used Applejack instead of Calvados. Also used Granny Smith apples as I didn't want it to be overly sweet

Great recipe, and very easy to make. Yes, it's true - the caramelized apple topping is very sweet, and probably sufficient for health conscious individuals. But if you exercise regularly, as I do, go for the Calvados topping. It's well worth it! I placed the sauce on the plate, and then put the cake on top. The cake absorbs the sauce wonderfully, and makes for an out of this world flavor combination. One recommendation, start on the sauce/topping first. It takes a while for the sugar to melt since you're using moderate heat.

Surely delicious and undisputably addictive. I will say, however, that there is perhaps an excess of butter. I suggest forgetting the sauce and instead adding some cinnamon. Remember the taste of really good apple sauce?

I didn't care for this cake at all. The cake itself was too heavy, and I felt like there was too much butter in the topping. It just wasn't what I thought it would be. I didn't make the sauce, and it wouldn't have helped. The cake was plenty sweet enough without it.

Too sweet and too gooey.

Loved this. Like the others I didn't make the sauce, ran out of time. I added crystalized ginger and cinnamon to the topping. Be careful, it is hard to tell how carmalized the topping is and one side of mine was overdone.

Go ahead - make the sauce! It's delicious and makes for an even more beautiful presentation.No Calvados on hand - used pear nectar nnd brandy.

I didn't need the syrup on top. It was rich enough prepared without it. I used Cortland apples as well, for a very nice taste.

a very rich and tasty cake, though not as spectacular as I expected. Was kind of too much work for what it came out to be.

Delicious cake! I have made the cake several times for informal dinners, and guests have always enjoyed it! I have never made the sauce, as I have not been able to find Calvados. It is wonderful served hot out of the oven with a good vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe. Won raves from my dinner party guests who all wanted seconds. I used tart Braeborn and Mackintosh apples instead of the recipe's golden delicious apples. The fresh ginger is an essential kick and the whipped cream makes a nice topping to cut the rich taste of this cake. The Calvados brandy really adds a nice flavor to the caramel sauce.

I used Cortland apples and skipped the special topping. The carmelized apples on top were enough. Served warm with vanilla ice cream would be best!

Rating: 4
It took almost two years of unfilled orders (did not realize it would be so hard to acquire) and sporadic searching for Calvados before I could prepare this properly; it was worth it. I used the less-sweet Granny Smith apple. Picture perfect, guests raved over presentation as well as taste. I had no problem with the sauce, although a drizzle is adequate. Wonderful finish to a meal with pork.

I have been making this one for years and had saved the issue of the magazine that it was from.I landed on this site because it has been requested once again and i have finally lost that magazine!I found this recipe easy & beautiful fromthe first time i tried it.It is quite rustic looking and that is one of the things i love about it.I make it in a cast iron skillet and have served it with or without the sauce,but i substitute whisky for the calvados(may not be everyone's taste, but with my heritage, whisky goes w/everything)

I haven't made this yet, but after reading reviews about the cake's overwelming sweetness, I intend to use a tart apple like cortland or granny smith. I also wonder what a handfull of fresh cranberries would do to cut the sweetness. I make a cranberry upside-down cake that's always a hit. One with apples, walnuts and cranberries would be outstanding.

I almost give this 4 forks as I have made it several times. It is easy and delicious, and reminds me of a dessert I had in Normandy. Like some other reviewers, I do not like the caramel sauce. I love Calvados, so I add a little (2 Tbsps or so) to the topping. A little English pouring custard is all the garnish this cake really needs. Delicieux!

The cake was very popular at our office party, but I personally didn't care for the cinnamon-caramel taste combination. Also, I too had to take a second run at the caramel sauce. The instructions should be clearer about keeping the heat low until all the sugar is melted. Finally, why the fork?

This I followed the recipe pretty closely and the cake looked gorgeous and tasted terrific. I was worried about the plastic handle on my pan melting, since my oven is small and it was touching the side, but I wrapped it in aluminum foil as recommended and there was no problem. For me, the caramel was too sweet, will cut the sugar next time. No sweet topping needed. The cake is still good on the second day, though probably better on the first. The ginger is a great twist.

This dish has always been a big hit for Brunch at my home. I omit the Calvados Sauce, delicious but not necessary. I find it an easy dish to prepare, and have experimented with other fruits (and nuts) with good results.

I made this cake for a dinner party and it was a hit! I had a little difficulty with the caramel sauce the first time, it got a bit too dark, but the second time I made it, it was perfect.

I was surprised to hear that a reviewer did not like this recipe; this cake is outstanding, one that we consistently make for company and receives rave reviews every time. I find it to be less time consuming than it looks. A real keper.

Made this cake for Christmas Day dessert. It was a huge hit. I didn't have fresh ginger so I substituted ginger powder and it worked out just fine. I'll definately make this one again.

I have already made this cake twice-once with the caramel sauce, once without. It is sweet enough without the sauce, especially great with coffee! The cake is pretty dense-more like biscuit than typical cake, but it works. LOVE the caramelized walnuts. I sliced the apples in eighths and used more than recommended- I think I ended up using 4 large apples. Also, I added extra apples to the cake mix, probably an entire apple. This is a great cake.

very time consuming but great ending. I left out the nuts because who I made it for could not have them and added homemade ice cream. It looked great and tasted better

This cake is sooooo good. It just got out of the oven and I can't wait until it cools down so i don't keep burning my tongue. I would definitely recommend this cake for impressing just about anyone. The only thing I would change would be to use a little less sugar. I didn't make the caramel sauce -- sweet enough as it is.

I don't know what all the rave reviews are for. I didn't like this cake much at all. It was too heavy and too gingery and the large blobs of apples on top did not look very attractive. It definitely needed the sauce which I never finished because I got a bad burn trying to stir the lumps out of the sugar syrup , when the bowl tipped. PLEASE USE CAUTION. There are easier ways to make sugar syrup. Adding a bit of corn syrup would have made it much easier.

This was excellent - I made it for a coffee break this AM (with two toddlers running around). It was easy and very delicious - the crowd loved it. I forgot about the walnuts - and it was still great. I didn't do the caramel sauce either. PS - It was also very attractive to present! Enjoy this one.

Tremendous recipe. I used a non-stick pan, and it came out fabulous. However, I'd recommend a medium, slightly higher than suggested, heat for carmelizing the topping. The non-stick pan just didn't get a good crispness on top. I also doubled the amount of ginger and cinnamon. Again, a great recipe for apple bread lovers.

I just served this for "coffee and cake" this afternoon and it is divine. Very easy to make. I was out of sour cream so I substituted a mixture of fresh milk and cream - same measurement. And I didn't have any ginger - fresh or dried, so I added some dried cloves in instead. I also served whipped cream instead of the caramel sauce. This desert is so rich and sweet that I think the caramel sauce would make it uneatably sweet. I will definitely be making this again. It looked great turned out on the platter - I must add, that this was my first ever upside-down cake!

This was a good cake; not a spectacular cake, but very good. I would make it again, but without the sauce. We really didn't like the sauce. The cake stands on its own - maybe a scoop of vanilla ice cream is all it needs.

I WAS GLAD TO FIND THIS RECEPIE THAT I HAD LOST IN THE PAST YEARS, ALTHOUGH I NEVER BOTHERED WITH THE SAUCE, I HAVE MELTED HAGGEN-DAZS ICE CREAM AND POURED THAT OVER IT INSTEAD!!! DELICIOUS

The reaction from my guinea pigs/guests was simply "Ummmmmm..." Try using a mixture of pecans, walnuts and brazil nuts for more complexity.

I loved this recipe. It was a great twist on pineapple upside down cake. However, next time I think that I will leave the ginger out of the cake.

I lost a few older Gourmet magazines during a recent move. I was elated to find this recipe on the web page. I am a big fan of pineapple upside down cake, and this is a great variation on that theme. I love it and so does every one I make it for. A true keeper of a recipe.

Recipe is just okay. But I don't really recommend. For my taste, it was away too sweet. Besides, quite a lot of work too.
