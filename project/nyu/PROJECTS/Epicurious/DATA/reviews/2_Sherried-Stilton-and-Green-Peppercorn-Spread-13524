Thought this would be a good use of a can of brined green peppercorns I had...wrong. Its ok, but really just tastes like blue cheese. PLUS, as with most blue cheese spreads it was a horrible shade of grey...the blue cheese with pecans recipe on this site is MUCH better

I'd make this again and probably add a touch more sherry -- the sherry was drowned a bit by the peppercorns. Neighbor who tasted it really liked it as well.
