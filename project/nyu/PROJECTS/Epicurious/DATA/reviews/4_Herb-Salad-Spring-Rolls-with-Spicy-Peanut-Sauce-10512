Awesome, so fresh and delicious! I used mint from my yard (suddenly the rain has a small redemption), and dried coriander and basil, but I really only noticed the mint. I used at least a cup of cabbage and a whole shredded carrot, perhaps 1/2 c? Left out the scallions b/c I didn't want to buy a whole bunch for just one. Perfect and delicious. A fun "date" dinner for two. :)

This is an excellent recipe but very labor intensive. I served these last night our contribution to supper club. The final product was judged to be identical to what is available at our local Thai restaurant. Key flavors for this recipe are Thai Basil and Coriander. I doubled the recipe and used smaller spring roll wrappers to make 18 rolls. 6 were prepared as instructed, 6 included cooked shrimp and 6 included seared tuna. When wrapping I used 2 wrappers at time and did not have any tearing. I made the suggested peanut sauce and added Duck Sauce and a Sesame Ginger sauce for 3 dipping choices. This is a recommended recipe with the caveat that it is labor intensive.

This is great and simple. It took me a couple tries to get a hang of the rice paper wrappers, but it's not hard. I soaked the wrappers for less time than suggested so they weren't quite pliable yet, and they soaked up more moisture as I filled them. I found that placing the filling in horizontally, from a bit away from the edge to the middle of the wrapper, then folding away from my body, made for the best technique. The peanut sauce was good, too (I've reviewed that separately). Oh, and I skipped the rice noodles and added avocado, and subbed cucumber for cabbage, just because that's what i had on hand.

I make these all the time. I never double wrap. I line some shrimp down the center of a wrap, then sprinkle with the basil then add the rest of the ingredients and roll. You get nice pink with green presentation if you lay them seam side down on the serving plate. Once you get the knack of the rice wrappers it is quite easy, just time consuming. We also do this as a roll your own and you can vary the ingredients to your own taste. I use nappa cabbage. I tend to use a lot more shredded carrot in it and play around with the sauce to get it as hot and the consistency how you like it. My husband likes to put his sauce in the roll, I like it on the outside as i Like a lot and just keep adding it as I eat. I am addicted to these!

These were great!! I also added shrimp. I placed the shrimp on the second wrap, so it is in the outer layer of the roll. My niece and I made a triple batch. They still tasted good the next day. Peanut sauce is fabulous.

I enjoyed this recipe...it's the closest to authentic salad spring rolls I've found yet. I didn't use coriander leaves...not traditional. I enjoyed the rice vinegar and added a little sesame oil, and sherry. I also added shrimp which was great.

I followed the recipe except I couldn't find been thread noodles, so I used rice noodles, which were fine. Also, I added some tofu for a little extra protein and served them as a main course for lunch.

I have made these for years and everyone loves them. My kids always ask for them. Sometimes I add chopped shrimp to the rolls.

A light refreshing supper for my family on warm summer nights. We roll them custom for each family member so we each get what we like. I also add tofu or cooked prawns, pork, or chicken to these rolls.

I recently made these for a party. I thought they were great and I got rave reviews at the party. For you first time rice paper users - they can take more pulling than you think!

This was my first time making spring rolls. The first two wrappers I ruined by placing them in water that was too hot. After a little cooling, the rolls came out perfectly. Be sure to use a small amount of filling and work your way up if you think you can fit more in. If you have too much, you'll ruin the roll. Next time I'll add more vinegar to the noodles. These were good, but a little insubstantial for me. (I ate them for my main dish). Next time I'll add some tofu to them.

Incredibly good spring roll recipe. Good balance of flavors. Next time I will layer the ingredients a bit differently so there is more flavor in every bite. Maybe layer cilantro over peanuts. If serving right away try putting the peanut sauce in the rolls!

p.p.s. if these weren't so tasty, i'd never do it again! first time around, the prep work was a MESS and took me an hour or more! all the veggies and sauce can be done ahead of time, but leave EXTRA time to fool with the rice paper- i got very frustrated! that said, next time should be a breeze.

Rating: 4
better assortment of ingredients but total lack of technique as compared to my favorite vietnamese place. i added a 3"x2"x1.5" slab of firm tofu in there for some substance! ALSO, i found that using 2 wraps gave rolls enough strength to be cut in half for display, but didn't make them any less delicate. p.s. DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE!!

I have made this recipe many times for many different people and always gotten rave reviews. The peanut sauce is the best ever and very easy to make. There is a lot of "prep" work and the key is absolutely to make sure the wrappers are dry and that you don't overstuff the rolls. But these are the best "hot summer night" garden party munchies I've ever had. Cool, crunchy and spicy. Yum!

An asian guest said these were the best he ever tasted! However, there really is a lot of prep work and lots of little things to clean up afterwards. I soaked all of the rice paper together and then worked carefully and quickly to put it together, and that worked well. However, be careful not to overstuff! The huge spring rolls I made (I probably overdid the ingreadients) were difficult to handle.

Rating: 3
I had all the other ingredients for this dish (subsituted bean sprouts for cabbage), but the one Asian store in town was closed, and I couldn't find the springroll wrappers anywhere else. I ended up serving as a salad - to rave reviews! Very, very good!

This recipe is fantastic! My favorite Thai restaurant makes a roll very similar to this using regular basil. I made it with the Thai variety and found that I like the sweet basil more. Wonderful variety of flavors and the peanut sauce just kicks it off. I put a splash of sambal oelek on the sauce for more spice. There is a lot of chopping of things involved but well worth it. Don't be intimidated by working with the rice paper. Just move slow and pat dry...no worries!!! ENJOY

Great recipe, easy to make, but lots of prep work. I put shrimp in my rolls, which I think gave it more flavor. I also substituted the cabbage with bean sprouts. Peanut sauce recipe was also easy, and quite tasty.

Try this recipe! Its A LOT of prep work, but well worth the trouble. Not only do I get rave reviews everytime I make it, I'm even getting requests. Some tips I've found are to use the 6-inch wrappers and automatically double wrap, placing the mint leaf in between the wrapers so you can still see it. Soften the wrappers 2 at a time, when you take 2 out, put 2 more in soften pouring a little hot water over them-they'll be done by the time you're ready. Keep water hot in a thermos and line up the ingredients in the order you're using them. This dish also made me invest in a salad spinner (my new favorite kitchen gadget!) it really cuts down the prep time. I add bean sprouts and matchstick cut red bell pepper for color and crunch and sometimes leave out cabbage, you don't miss it with the lettuce and rest of the veggies. There's no need to be intimidated by the fagileness of the wrappers (as I was), they're really fairly sturdy and quite easy once you get the hang of it!

This was actually fairly easy to make and the presentation was beautiful. I was leary of using raw cabbage and carrots (for some reason, I wanted to cook them in some oil) but the peanuts and rice vinegar really bring it all together. It's a perfect starter for a Thai dinner.

I tried this last night and it was very enjoyable. Getting the knack of rolling with the rice paper took a few tries, but it was fun for all of us. Substitute Cabbage for Napa Cabbage, it's lighter and probably more authentic.

I found this very good and easy once the prep work was done. My onlt thought is that the cabbage was too heavy - in taste and texture - for the light, fresh rolls. I made several without cabbge and preferred those. Overall a big hit with my guests.

made this as a salad, with a few adaptations--added fresh ginger, fresh lemongrass, fresh garlic, left out the peanuts and used a bottled sauce--Bangkok Padang Peanut sauce--as a dressing. The salad cut the prep time in half, and my friends and I loved it.

A first time experience working with the rice paper. I made abotu 60 whole rolls for a local gathering. Added some shredded turnip-raw - to add a little more bite. They were devoured. Followed reccomendation about the chili paste with garlic for the peanut sauce.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I don't like cilantro so used italian parsley instead. Also added a little hot red curry paste to the peanut sauce. Next time, I'm leaving out the noodles and making the rolls cigar size for easier handling at an appetizer party. Stay beautifully for 48 hours in the fridge wrapped in damp paper towels.

This recipe never fails. It is always an enormous hit. And I can make it when I'm serving the vegetarians, but the others like it too. Yes, the rice paper is the devil to work with, but you can do it. I always use two and I soak them only for a few seconds. Possibly it is the Thai and Cambodian wrappers I use? I keep them wrapped in the paper towels in the fridge and unwrap before serving, as suggested. Works a charm. Peanut sauce is fabulous.

I've made fresh rolls before and given up, but the paper towel hint is a life-saver. This is a great recipe and the peanut sauce is incredible, it's even better the next day. I served these with another sauce too that I made up of seasoned rice vinegar with a little corn syrup stirred in and red pepper flakes and finely chopped peanuts sprinkled on top. It sounds too basic to be good but it's yummy and tastes authentic and complex. These rolls were good the next day too.

This is a great summer recipe. While the rice paper wraps are a little difficult to work with because of the fragility, it is definitely worth the effort it takes to make them. This is a recipe that even "meat and potatoes" people will enjoy.

This is the ultimate refreshing summer dish. I omitted the cabbage and cilantro, but added thin strips of marinated tofu, yellow pepper, and bean sprouts, which was nice. In half of the rolls i used a thicker round rice noodle which made for a more filling mouthful. The peanut suce was great.

A huge hit at a recent party! I julienned the carrots for aesthetic appeal and added julienned daikon radish. Also, I used a different peanut sauce recipe (from Martha's apps book, I must admit) which had a yummy ginger tang to it, and the combination was fabulous. I've even packed them in a bag lunch with a container of the sauce and they held up just fine. For me, the only drawback is the time it takes to cut up everything.

I love the way this recipe turns out; there's something about these rolls (I think it's the herbs) that is delicious, partcularly with the addictive peanut sauce. I don't love making them; I find the rice wrappers tedious in the beginning, but after the first couple, I get the hang of it and I start to enjoy (sort of) making them! My sweetie and I are vegetarians, so this is a great entree for us when it's hot and we want to eat light.

These are fantastic! Great for a light meal. I nixed the cabbage and mint. I added some bean sprouts for extra crunch, although the peanuts give plenty. I didn't use the peanut dipping sauce, instead used the Ginger-chile sauce from Epicurious, to which I added some sesame oil and a little sugar. My husband raved over these. Made extra to take to work...not a piece left. One of the girls took the left over dipping sauce to put on her salad. Great idea. Will keep this recipe handy!

I have made this a number of times - always to good reviews. The rolls are good but the spicy peanut sauce is great - 4 forks!! I have made the sauce a number of times for other dishes and as a dipping sauce.

A very disappointing recipe, especially given the excellent ingredients and the glowing reviews of other cooks. The overall flavors did not seem to come together properly in the rolls and the dipping sauce did not enhance them.

A friend and I made this recipe for a crowd of food ctitiques and they loved it. We even made small versions the next day and they were just as good. A definite crowd pleaser and not too hard to make either.

These were great! Although, after chopping everything, my grocery did not have rice papers, only eggroll wrappers made of flour. SO, I ended up frying them in a little oil, in a very hot wok, turning quickly. They were actually very good, great sauce. Next time that I see rice papers, I will snatch them up and try the lighter spring roll version.

I make this using whatever I happen to have in the fridge and in my herb garden--usually the full amount of basil, chives instead of scallions, some cilantro, some parsley, a little lemonbalm, a little less carrot than called for, some sliced cucumber, no peanuts (plenty in the sauce), no lettuce (the rice paper wrappers are substantial enough). I also double the amount of vinegar, and add a dash of sesame oil. Also, to save some time I mix the noodles and everything else together before adding to the wrappers. Really pleasant and refreshing.

These are great, and a huge hit at my latest Thai-themed dinner party. I doubled the recipe and everyone of these were devoured. They are time-consuming to make, and I needed to use two sheets of rice paper for each roll, but you can make them ahead of time and keep them (covered) in the fridge. I too used cucumber instead of cabbage, and thought the texture worked better. I forgot the peanuts, but don't think anyone missed it as they piled on the scrumptious peanut sauce. I'll definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
These were amazing...I'm glad it was suggested to double up on the rice paper because they do tear very easily. I made the peanut sauce a little spicier than suggested and I think it made the dish. Also, I used fewer herbs and more cucumber, peanuts, and carrots than suggested. The herbs were just too strong for the suggested amount.

Made them for the second time this weekend to take to our neighborhood Pot Luck. Made 12, served cut in half, and every piece went. They received many compliments. Did not like them that much the first time, but decided to try again, since my husband really liked them. Used Extra Thin Rice Paper the second time (harder to work with, but much better results). Also used cucumbers, as suggested by other review, and liked that much better. Now I will make them on a regular basis.
