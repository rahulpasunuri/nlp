I followed the recommendations of another reviewer and made a reduction with water and the spices and tea first. I thought this custard's flavor is delicious--I suspect that what maybe put people off is that the chai flavor does not resemble chai from American coffee shops (which I also adore) but rather the more subtle, less sweet flavor of South Asian masala chai on which the American beverage is based.

I made this exactly according to the recipe at the request of a client. Sorry to say it was not a big hit. The reports varied from just OK to slightly bitter. My spices and tea were fresh so I don't know what the problem could be.

I was surprised that there was indeed a mild pumpkin-like flavour, probably due to steeping the spices in the milk instead of water. Perhaps I'll try what the reader suggested about making a masala chai concentrate and using that. However, having said all that, we all loved it and will make it again. It is very satisfying and not too sweet.

I followed the directions & ingredients all the way, and was still dissapointed. I did get that weird pumpkin taste that another reviewer claimed. I am an avid fan of chai but I would not waste these ingredients on this recipe again.

We thought this was delicious. The chai flavor is a bit delicate, subtle even. If you want a stronger flavor, take the advice of someone who suggested making the tea and reducing it, or just double the spices. I added a few whole allspice berries and a few white peppercorns to the tea, and I bundled it in a coffee filter to steep instead of straining (I hate straining). I subbed 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk, 1/2 cup Splenda and 1 tsp molasses for the brown sugar, and forgot to add the orange peel. I also baked it in one dish instead of individual ramekins. I will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I were both dissappointed by this recipe. Made it Christmas day just for our family. Don't know what it was about the recipe just not our taste.

Um... erg... no... Despite being a passionate chai person with about six loose varieties of tea in the pantry, something about this wasn't right. Too tannic maybe, too spicy maybe -- don't know. But this is so expensive to make, uses so many eggs, and chocolate or vanilla pots de creme are so much more of a "hit" with guests. Mine made faces at the taste of this. :(

I love chai, and I was very excited about this dessert. But, alas. It was just okay. If this were a low fat recipe, I would probably make it again, but with this many egg yolks and cream, I was expected something more delicious a bit more delicious. I served it at a dinner party, and noticed that there were many custard cups only half empty when I cleared the plates.

Very unusual and delicious. I used 5 oz. souffle cups and filled them only about a half full.

When I made these everyone raved about them. I did not have any loose English breakfast tea; so I used another kind of loose tea that I had on hand. It still came out great. I did find that it took longer than 30 minutes to cook. Mine took about twice that amount of time. But that differnce might be because I used a convection oven. I plan on making these again very soon.

The fun thing about massala chai is that you can essentially use any kind of tea and/or spices you like. If you go with your own tastes and instincts, it's really hard to mess up. I drink chai quite regularly but I use different herbal blends (black currant with a few chammomile flowers has been my favorite so far) and whatever spices I have on hand. Generally, I go with a few whole cloves, stick cinnamon, a generous dash of anise seed, and a few peppercorns. I've never added vanilla bean (although I do like the idea), and while my best friend does add fresh nutmeg and ginger to his, I don't usually keep such things around the house, other than ground, which I'd rather not use for chai. For those of you felt it tasted like pumpkin, maybe it was the nutmeg? I absolutely adore chai, and I am thrilled to have this new creative way to enjoy it. Cheers!

A great recipe. It was my contribution to my friends Chinese hot pot dinner for Chinese New Year. I didn't get any pumpkin taste (!?), but did a few alterations to the recipe, I made a very strong reduction of the spices and tea ahead of time and also added a Tahitian Vanilla bean to the grouping. I did the reduction in about 1.5 cups of water and reduced it slowly down to 2 tablespoons. Once it was good and concentrated I continued on with the recipe as usual. I made anise waffers to go on top as well. It was a hit.

I found this dish beautiful. I don't like very sweet desserts so this was just right. Only thing I would change is the name. "Chai" just means tea, but the spiced tea referred to in this recipe is Masala Chai (Masala Tea).

I also ended up with 4. I agree that it had a pumpkin / squash taste that I didn't like, but my dinner guests said was fine. I let mine set and cool a bit before pouring into the custard cups, and the foam did cling together and stay in the pan. I served them with some almond lace cookies and they looked great, but I just didn't care for the taste.

These are good, but I would probably lean towards making chocolate pots de creme. I did alter the recipe out of necessity. I needed to use up some cream, but did not have ginger or cardmom on hand, so I steeped three chai tea bags in the milk and cream.

These were alright. Everyone who tried it said it tasted like pumpkin pie, the tea flavor didn't come through very strong. I only got 4, not 6 - there was not enough liquid to make 6. Be sure to let the sit before you put it into ramekins so that you don't get bubbles on the surface of the pots de creme. I didn't and mine were so bubbly and looked so bad, I bruleed the top of it and called it chai creme brulee. Serve with a crunchy cookie, like a florentine.
