I don't really agree with the way these ribs are cooked but I think the barbecue sauce is nice. If the ribs are cooked differently (I boiled mine) then every thing else is great. I made it for a few guest and they genuinely enjoyed it. So I made it again and again and each time I have seemed to add or change it just a little; not much. It's not all that bad a recipe, just needs a few minor changes.

Yetch! Steamed ribs that you then only cook for a few minutes. Again I say...yetch.

Good recipe. I like to steam or boil and don't consider it a no-no. It gives the pork a great texture that you will miss. I've tried it both ways and always get rave reviews if the ribs have been boiled/steamed. You can steam them indirectly by placing a pan of water with charcoal placed around the pan-you need to steam them for at least 2 and 1/2 hours.After steaming lather them with sauce and brown them as you like them. This process gives you the best flavor and texture but is takes a lot of precious time compared to boiling them.

Never boil ribs before BBQ, this takes away all the flavor, make a rub out of the dry ingredients, then bbq very low coals and slow, then put in aluminium foil with 1/2 cup grape and 1/2 cup apple juice, for another hour, then finally baste the meat the with the prepared BBQ sauce for 1 hour! Boiling meat before BBQ takes away the flavour! and is a big No No...although it may reduce time...
