I made this using 2 9" almond sponge cakes and cut each in half - layering with the pastry cream as indicated but keeping the look of a cake. I also substituted the grated orange peel with another tsp of vanilla extract. The cake turned out beautifully and tasted fantastic. My Italian husband requested it for his b-day and was definitely pleased.

I made this as written, using a home-made sponge cake from Joy of Cooking. The proportions are just right. I was afraid that it would leak liguid after sitting, but it stayed perfect in the fridge for days. I assembled this in a "lasagna" pan-slightly larger than 9x13, and I think this was perfect-very thin layers. Although we like chocolate with orange, we agreed that the orange didn't work here somehow. The rum flavor was very mild. I will make this again, it's better than my previous recipe for Zuppa Inglaise, but I will play with the flavorings a little.

This is a wonderful recipe. I found that I did not have enough angel food cake, so I finished the assembly with some lady fingers that I had on hand. It is ashame to throw away the egg whites, if you have the time, make your own angel food cake. I also had syrup left over of which I did not use for fear that it would be to strong tasting but I will use it the next time.
