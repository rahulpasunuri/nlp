Someone made this recipe so I adapted it to be a bit healthier. I used turkey bacon and used 10 slices of turkey bacon and it worked just as well. I also used a very high quality olive oil and used less of it (I cut it by half). I thinned the dressing out with a little fresh orange juice instead.

Oh San Francisco - quit playing dumb. Virginia - don't BE dumb. The fat police are only trying to save you from an early heart attack. Your fat causes MY insurance premiums to go up so I'm paying for it! The recipe is awful - a couple of toast slices and a tomato away from a BLT. So have the BLT!!

I agree with Richmond, VA cook, you can put most anything in this salad and it will be good. I added some fresh mushrooms, very good. I will try the pears and blue cheese. Very refreshing taste.

A simple but tasty salad. The taste of the dressing reminds me of my mother's cooked dressing for wilted lettuce. I have tried a number of variations of this recipe, such as adding avocado and/or blue cheese, and they work well. I am also going to try it with pears. Nevertheless, the basic salad by itself is fine, especially if your other dishes are fairly complicated. With regard to the amount of bacon, I am tired of listening to the "fat police" -- they would ruin anything if they could. Fry up the specified amount and enjoy it. I did use thick sliced bacon in this recipe.

The recipe in Gourmet says 10 thick cut slices of meaty smoked bacon

Maybe you should invest in a kitchen scale if you are that worried about the weight of the bacon.

Very simple, easy to follow directions. This salad is easier to make if you have pre-cooked bacon just hanging around in the kitchen...and you should! Oh, and 1/2 pound is just that..1/2 pound...number of slices doesn't matter.

jen - i saw the typo also (,?l?k), i think it's supposed to say "thick". just check the weight on the package to figure out how much to use for 1/2 lb.

It clearly states 1/2 lb. of bacon. So what is there to figure out?

I can't really rate this recipe, because there is a typo on the ingredient list and I can't tell how many slices of bacon to use.

This was really good although I substituted prosciutto (diced and sauted in a little olive oil until crispy) for the bacon and added crumbled gorgonzola.
