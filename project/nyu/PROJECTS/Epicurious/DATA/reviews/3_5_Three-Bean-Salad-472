I love this recipe! I like to use whole kernel sweet corn (or even better, roasted corn from the cob) instead of hominy. I serve this as a burrito with lettuce and sour cream.

I thought this recipe was pretty bland. I served it at a party, and everyone was pretty much of the same opinion. Lots if leftovers.

Quick, flavoful recipe-lime and cilantro make anything taste good. The amount of chili and cumin is appropriate if you use the volumes of other ingredients recommended, but you can always adjust to taste yourself. I usually do cut down the amount of red onion by half. Definitely a recipe that tastes better after "marinating" for 24-48 hours.

Perhaps my chili powder is stronger than most, otherwise this dish was inedible. My husband and I love spicy food (and that is an understatement), but we could not eat this dish. I would recomend going slowly with the chili powder if your going to try it.

I made this dish for a party and it was a hit! People ended up using it to dip their chips in like a salsa instead of eating it as a salad. The lime juice combined with cilantro really made the dish! I'll definately make this in the future.

This was a delicious recipe - if you like cilantro, then you'll love it. It's very lite and very simply prepared. I swapped the yellow hominy beans for chick peas, and the red onion for vidalia. All-in-all it was a wonderful addition to my summer party.

I made this salad for a potluck picnic and not a bean was left. :-) It makes way more than 6 servings, probably double that. The salad got rave reviews and everyone asked for the recipes. I can't wait to make it again! It's fast and easy. All you do is a little chopping and open some cans. No cooking required!

I gave it four forks because if you like the ingredients, you'll like the salad. That's a no brainer. I actually thought to make the bean salad and came to this website for a few ideas of anything I might not have thought of: I used what I had on hand: Can of red pinto and a can of kidney beans Can of Del Monte petite diced tomatoes with Jalepenos really spiced this up. No need for olive oil with the canned tomatoes... half a red onion chopped chili powder as someone suggested cumin powder cuz it's so good (for you too) I meant to throw in some lime juice but forgot. It was great. A bowl of this salad, a glass of red wine and a piece of flatbread was my dinner since I didn't have much in the house. Gotta love improvisation.

This recipe was very good. I, too, used the whole cans of kidney and pinto beans (rather than measuring out one cup) -- it turned out great. I also used 4 tablespoons of lime juice.

This recipe didn't impress me at all!! I expected more from it due to the reviews!! It wasn't an attractive looking dish, kinda mushy looking and tasting! I don't love Cumin, so I guess the cumin overpowered the dish for me!! One more note- it seemed to make more than 6 servings, more like 12 servings I would think!!

A good recipe. I used 4 TB lime juice and 2 TB olive oil like another reviewer, and also some red wine vinegar, tabasco, and extra cumin and chili powder to jazz it up at the end. I used my whole cans of kidney and pinto beans too. All I could find was white hominy, which I thought could be increased because of all the beans. I used vidalia onion. A hit at 4th of July picnic!

Very delicious and easy. I used Italian green beans instead of hominy, and used 2 T olive oil, and 4 T lime juice.
