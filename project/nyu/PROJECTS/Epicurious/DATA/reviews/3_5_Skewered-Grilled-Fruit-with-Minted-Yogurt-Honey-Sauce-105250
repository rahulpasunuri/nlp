This was a big hit on our camping trip. Easy and unexpectedly delicious.

The longer you let the sauce sit, the mintier it becomes. This was our first time grilling fruit and everyone loved it!

Needed a quick sauce when I burned the caramel I intended to drizzle on some baked apples -- what a treat! Added grated cinnamon and nutmeg and loved it.

This is a fun way to serve fruit. We thought it was delicious and really loved the yogurt sauce.

Pretty bad----(It's hard to imagine that something this simple could be bad, butit was.) Frankly, just the plain skewered fruit would have been fine.
