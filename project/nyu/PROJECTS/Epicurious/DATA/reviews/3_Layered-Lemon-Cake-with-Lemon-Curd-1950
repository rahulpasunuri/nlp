Love this cake!! This is THE cake for special occasions in my family. It is hard not to eat all of the lemon curd while preparing. Maybe for my birthday I'll make the curd and eat it all myself! Don't miss this luscious cake.

the cake did not taste anything like a lemon cake. The only way anyone would know it's a lemon cake is because of the curd. The cake is dry and white in color when most lemon cakes are moist and yellow. It's really a white cake with lemon juice.

My husband raved about this dessert. It is one you would expect in the finest of restaurants. Very easy to prepare.

Even duly using self-raising flour the layers turn out extremely flat. Curd is gorgeous though! May make again adding 1.5 tsp. baking powder to see if that lightens it up.

This is a lovely summer cake to follow a big meal. The cake is quite light, not quite a sponge cake and the curd is outstanding. I often sift powdered sugar over the top. It is a frequent request from my husband.

A very good, light and delicious dessert! I suspect the previous reviewers who weren't impressed with it had one of two problems with it - No.1 You have to use self-rising flour or make your own substitute (1c. self-rising = 1c. all-purpose+1 1/2 tsp. baking powder+1/2 tsp. salt...) If you don't use the right flour, obviously it's not going to work! No.2 - do not expect a large cake - each layer is only about an inch high so it'a more like a lemon-filled sandwich than a layer cake. Actually, I filled and iced it with lemon butter icing and used the curd (a larger batchh...) as a sauce on the side. It was a great light, refreshing dessert after a heavy steak dinner...!

This cake was not very good. It was time consuming, dry and a complete waste of time. I agree with Michelle from White Rock 100%. I also did use cake flour as Adspiro questioned, and it still was awful. The froting was good, however could use som work, and there was not enough lemon curd. Don't waste your time.

I don't care for cake normally, I'm a pie eater. This cake has a wonderful curds found in a lemon pie. The lemon mousse icing just makes it devine.

What a waste of ingredients!!!! Do me a favour and pass this recipe, or better yet delete it from this website.... YUCK! Can anyone say hockey puck??? The lemon curd, by the way didn't make very much and wasn't as firm as I would have liked. Better to try another recipe... Good Luck!

I have not tried this recipe, but just reading the unfavorable reviews of the cake prompted me to re-read the ingredients. It seems that perhaps some people may not have used the corrected flour - Self-rising flour is all-purpose flour that has baking powder and salt added to it. This type of flour would contribute to how the cake rises. If people used regular all purpose flour, this may explain why the cake did not rise as expected.

The lemon curd is DELICIOUS and easy to make, too. However, I had the same problem as other reviewers with the cake layers being way too flat. I now use another recipe for the lemon cake layers, but assemble with this curd and decorate with icing sugar through a stencil. Great!

It's funny how so many vastly different opinions can be based upon the same recipe! Though most of these are not favorable, some people think it is great! I'm glad I read your reviews before trying this. From the sound of things I think I would be really dissapointed with this recipe!

OK, I made this cake twice and combined the best layers of the two receipes! No one mentioned that the layers shrink down by 25% once out of the oven! all that egg white shivels! It is almost an sponge cake. TIP put some clear flavorless gelatin in the curd during the last minutes of cooking..then into the frige (along with the whip cream icing) over night at least...then it stays firm enough to build the cake..back into the frig for at least 3 hours before serving..BTW It tasted great..looked good..just wish someone had mentioned the shrinkage!

I saved this issue of Bon Appetit because of the Irish features and was soo disappointed with this cake. Made is twice and both times it was less than one inch tall and a far cry from photo. I got another recipe from Epicirous files and am using(New cake is in the oven now!) Plan on using the lemon curd.

This cake was quite possibly the worst thing I have ever baked. The batter seemed incredibly thick, and it failed to rise at all. The result resembled a thick lump of cooked flour. Truly inedible, to the point where we were convinced an ingrediant must have been missing from the recipe. I'm not sure what, exactly, went awry, but the final product was vile.

This cake is absolutely fabulous! I made it for my co-workers and it got rave reviews. It has a fresh lemon flavor that I love. Definitely worth the effot!

I was disappointed in the cake but the lemon curd was yummy. If I hadn't read "A Cook from Houston"'s comment, I would have overbaked it. I expected the cake to be lighter, more like a sponge cake.

This has become a favorite of my very critical guy. We double the lemon curd cause it's soooo good.

LEMON CURD WAS EASY TO MAKE AND EXCELLENT. Cake was way too thin. I used a 9" pan. Cake was dry, dry, dry. I frosted it with whipped cream just to keep in what was left of the moisture. My company said they liked it. I must have cooked it too long, and since it was in a pan too big, that dried it out even more. Would like to try again.

I added some milk to the cake batter. Cake had a nice lemon flavor and the curd was wonderful. The recipe was nicely sweet but not overpowering - perfect for lunch and summer.

The lemon curd was beautiful. The sponge cake was not high enough, I would use the lemon curd to fill a normal sponge cake recipe

A lovely cake all around. Simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. I needed to make something lemony for a co-workers birthday and this was perfect. If you don't have 8x2 pans, go to Bridge Kitchenware (www.bridgekitchenware.com)where they have professional quality 8x2 inch pans for $5.30 each.

This is a simple recipe for a delicious cake. I have made it 3 or 4 times, already, and I am preparing to make it again...now. I make extra curd and spread it on top of the cake, as well as inside. I, then, frost the cake with my quaintreau whipped cream.

I don't know about you, but I could not find a two-inch high 8-inch pan to save my life. Against my better judgement, I doubled the recipe and put it into 3 9-inch layer pans (1 inch high) Big mistake. The cake was edible, but hardly worth the effort.

This was an excellent recipe. I only had a 10 inch springform pan, so I used it, then topped the cake with the curd (which by the way is exquisite, perfect tanginess, excellent), then topped this with thinly sliced strawberries so it looked like a fruit tart. Come to think if it, you could do the same topping with different thinly sliced fruits, i.e. grapes, kiwi, straws, etc. Serve with fresh whipped cream on the side. Delicious!

I was looking for an easy, no-fail lemon curd recipe and tried this one. Came out great. Not too sweet, not too tart. The consistency and thickness were just right. Tastes great on scones.

I made this cake for Easter Sunday. I realized too late that I did not have an 8" cake pan (only a 9.5" one). So instead of making two short layers, I made one rather thick layer. I put the lemon curd on top and "frosted" the cake with whipped cream. Served with sweetened frozen blackberries. Yummy!!!!! Looked imperssive and tasted great.
