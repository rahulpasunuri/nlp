Don't make this without the acorn squash. The soup itself is OK but since it's meant to be pureed it needs the squash for texture. My fiance said the squash was the best part of this and I have to agree with him. Because everything's going to be pureed in the end anyhow, save yourself the trouble of chopping things and throw everything in the food processor ahead of time (separately of course since the ingredients aren't all added at the same time). Not only does that cut down on prep time, everything's in tiny pieces which cooks through faster. Also, I started with half the recommended amount of liquids (broth and water). You can add more at the end after everything's pureed and just blend it together over the heat. This will keep the soup to whatever your desired thickness is. Season generously. I also threw in a store-bought dry herb mix I had and I think that really helped add some more depth to the soup (basil, oregano, mint, sage, rosemary...), cayenne added a nice kick as well. I didn't use the full two tablespoons of vinegar, I think it would've overwhelmed the beet flavor. This is a soup you really need to taste as you go, don't just measure out the ingredients ahead of time and throw it all in. I also threw in a small carrot into the mix of ingredients just to add some more flavor (I didn't really taste it at all though). I really wouldn't say this soup is anything special. The whole thing is incredibly filling though. While I don't think I'd make this soup again I think by halving the liquids this would make a delicious pasta sauce.

This came out rather mealy - with the pureed parts separating from the liquid. To be fair, I ran into a snag with my food processor which involved leaking about 1/4 cup of the RED liquid (so I feel the pain of the other reviewer who also had a mess on their hands). Even still, the liquid seemed to separate from the pureed parts. I'll have to try this again and see (plus go a little easier on the cayenne!) to figure out if it was just me or what. No rating - since I will blame myself on this one.

This is great! I have next to no experience making soups but, this was SO easy & was SO good! Someone mentioned making a huge mess, I don't understand how they managed that. I had no problems, just had to clean the food processor. Granted I only made 1/2 a recipe (there were only 3 of us and, anyway, I only happened to have the ingredients for that much). I had carnival squash on hand so I used those & didn't cut the bottoms. That seemed messy and I knew it wouldn't be necessary once the squash was cooked. I did season HEAVILY with salt, black pepper & cayenne pepper (much more so then I'd normally season something). I had a little left over mascarpone that seemed a likely combination so, I added a small dollop before serving (and put the rest on the table)... it was a lovely presentation! It tasted good w/ & w/o the mascarpone. Filling and festive

Forgot to mention that I have made the soup a day ahead with no sacrifice to taste or texture. Creme fraiche puts it right over the top!

On many occasions, guests have raved about this soup on through the dessert course and beyond. The cooks who pan it are probably not seasoning aggressively enough. A generous measure of pepper counters the sweetness of the beets and adds a delicious complexity. On many occasions, guests have raved about this soup on through the dessert course and beyond. Roasting the beets (have only tried half--after they are diced) adds more flavor. Season the squash well (cayenne for kick), but here's the key tip (thanks, Dad): DO NOT cut the bottoms off them. When cooked, they will smoosh down and sit flat on a soup plate. Don't skip it--the scooped squash provides texture and taste.

Really good cold weather soup. Instead of trying to get it into the blender, I used my emmersion blender right in the pot- very easy and the color was amazing.

Really delicious! I halved the recipe because I only needed enough for 2 + leftovers. I used the entire amount of broth and no water. I wrapped the beats in foil and raosted them in the oven with the squash for about 30 mins, then I peeled them and followed the rest of the reciped as written. I didn't have an apple so I added some homemade applesauce at the end instead. We had a simple salad on the side that I topped with the squash seeds (toasted) plus some goat cheese & dried cranberries. The meal was tasty and surprisingly filling.

I made this for 2 instead of 8, and did a 1-to-1 ratio on beets to apples in my modification. It was amazing!

Pretty colors. Will not make again however, as it was just too messy. After you accidentally fling beet puree on seemingly every surface of your kitchen, you somehow make a vow that no soup is worth that. Flavor was simple and fresh tasting. Excellent in the squash bowl. Only change I made was in response to water soup, so I added 1 lb. cubed peeled potato with the beets and apple. It made for a thicker soup that I actually added more water to.

Really liked this recipe. The flavors were very nice and the squash was surprisingly good with the beets. We're on an after holiday diet, so this was our meal and provided a filling and warming meal with very little fat and very healthy food. BTW, I, also, did not need all the water and broth. It would've meant thin, runny soup. Other then that we really enjoyed this

This recipe seems to get 70% rave reviews and 30% complete pans. Mine is somewhere in between. My main criticism is that it says to "simmer" the beet/apple/broth/water mixture for 40 minutes - and at that point I still had crunchy beet chunks. I had to turn up the heat and boil it for another half hour just to get the damn things tender enough to eat! And by that time the squash was barely hot anymore. The flavors are grand - I love the buttery acorn squash with the earthy beets and tart vinegar - but the dish seems to lack texture. Perhaps combining it with a pasta or bean of some sort may make it more interesting. I took one of the reviewers' advice and added some grated ginger toward the end, and I think that made the flavors more interesting. It did seem like there was too much liquid present, though, so next time I might halve the water (only 2 cups).

Worried after reading some reviews here about producing a soup with lackluster flavor, I roasted the beets until soft before adding them to the soup. I then reduced cooking time to 25- 30 minutes and did not add sugar at the end. The result was a rich and delicious soup -- with the stunning presentation others have mentioned. Guests said it was one of the best vegetarian dishes they'd ever had. A keeper!

What a spectacular recipe. The presentation is great, but the taste is even better. I did everything way in advance including oiling the squash. Next time I will wait to add salt until just before cooking. Wait until you see the color of the beet soup. Psychedelic! I used Carnival squash as Acorn wasn't available in the small size. Added to the drama.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now, and everybody loves it. I would recommend definitely NOT excluding the acorn squash bowl- that's half of it! People were eating all the flesh from the lids, it was so good! It is beautiful, too- the purple, yellow, and green- no, don't skip the squash bowl! I also think it doesn't hurt to use a little more apple than called for. The first time around, I had half a pear and decided to throw that in the mix, too. The second time I used twice the amount of apple the recipe calls for- it doesn't leave too strong a taste of apple at all. I also added some cayenne, not a lot but just enough to give the soup a little kick. For those of you who find the soup a bit bland, I'd recommend the cayenne and also some freshly grated ginger in each squash bowl after you've poured the soup in. THIS was maybe the best part. Delicious, delicious, and great for us!!! And it's so beautiful!!

This soup is lovely, and the presentation is pretty fancy. It's true that the soup tastes, well, like beets. The flavor is simple and earthy and makes for a very comforting and nutritious bowl of soup on a cold day. Together with the squash it's perfect, but you will likely have plenty of leftovers. A drizzle of flavorful olive oil over the soup or, as other readers mentioned, a scoop of yogurt or sour cream can jazz it up. A sprinkle of fresh dill is nice, too.

Great presentation - although I think I only had 2 bowls that survived the cooking and would have been OK without a soup plate underneath. The soup is just OK. I passed plain yougurt at the table and everyone agreed it improved the soup. The soup tastes nice with the squash but by itself... not so great. Great color though. I followed the advice of another reviewer and made everything ahead, just reheating on the day of (Christmas). I think sitting in the fridge for a couple of days helped the soup mellow somewhat.

Rating: 3
A bolder flavour can be had if you use an elegant olive oil or ensure that you add spices inside the squash while cooking. As this was my first time with beets, I basically did this recipe "as is" although mock broth was used and cider vinegar was omitted. This was a tasty, filling vegan meal. Don't even get me started on the presentation!

I made this for a family dinner party and everyone raved and wanted the recipe. It was very simple to make. I did it all the day before and just reheated the squash in the oven and heated up the soup on the stovetop.

I have never given a poor review, but in all honesty, I found this recipe disappointing. My boyfirend and I really like beets, and so we thought we'd just add this to our recipes to try out when beets are in season. Our main issue is that the beet overpowered everything else and that in the end the soup just tasted like pureed beet, without any of the pleasure of the textureof freshly steamed or roasted beets. The soup even overwhelmed the squash. In the end we felt like it would have been better to have just had roasted beets rather than to go to all the trouble and preparation. Though it certain does have a wonderful presentation with the squash. As I was trying to figure out what to do with all the left overs I did come up with two different solutions, that I will put out there for those of you who are still curious to try out the recipe but that may share our disappointment. 1st variation is to add some of the beet soup to a potato leek soup, and then you can freeze the left overs with great success. 2nd variation is to simply add some sour cream and grated beet and turn it into a soupy borscht inspired bastardization, which is nonetheless very tasty.

My husband, who HATES beets, gave me a cold eyeball over thanksgiving when I served this truly beautiful dish as the soup course, but he deigned to *try* it just to be polite. He LOVED it!! He ate everything but the skin and then went back for more! Anything that gets MY family to eat beets is aces in my book!

I only made the soup - didn't bother with the squash. With an adjustment or two, this is a most excellent beet soup. I put in all the chicken broth, but put in less than 2 cups of water. I also did not puree it until very smooth - it had slight lumps (about barley size?). You could put a dab of sour cream in, but it is PERFECT plain, and of course the color is fabulous.

I made this for my fiancee who loves beets and squash. He loved it but I think I could make it better next time with a few changes in technique and a few ingredient changes. Changes when I made this dish - I didn't cut a slice off the bottom of the squash. I chose one that was already pretty flat and as it cooked, it settled down and became even flatter and more stable. I figured that the skin of the squash would help it remain whole while it cooked if I didn't cut it and I could help stabilize the bottom of the bowl if it was still unstable by putting greens like lettuce under the squash if it was still too unstable. I discovered that I'd forgotten to buy an apple and my chicken stock had expired. I substituted a pear for the apple and I used beef broth with some apple cider in it. I also only pureed half of the mixture and mixed the two halfs together and found I enjoyed the texture, although the beet bits were a bit tough. Changes for next time:use vegetable broth. I'm going to sautee the onions, then the beets, then the garlic and cook the beets in the stock/water mixture for 30 minutes on med/high. Puree the beet mixture, then add cubed apples and pears to cook for 15 minutes longer on med. Also, the part of the squash lid touching the sheet burned, turned black, and tasted bitter. Next time I'm going to put a little water in a cake pan and put the lid into it, then put the cake pan on the cookie sheet with the bowl of the squash and cook them together. Also, an hour and 15 minutes was too long to cook the squash. I'm going to check the squash at 45 minutes next time to make sure it doesn't overcook, then every 10 minutes.

This soup was delightful! I halved the ingredients into two different pots;in one pot made the beet puree, and in the other followed the same recipe but used squash instead of beets. I poured the beet soup into one side of the bowl and the squash on the other, and then swirled the two together. It looked and tasted wonderful. You must reduce the beet soup some, to retain the same consistency as the squash, in order for them to 'swirl' together. The cornmeal-cayenne grissini is a PERFECT combo with this sweet soup. I can't wait to make it again:)

At the request of our dad, this was our first course at Thanksgiving, It was served to a group of professed beet haters - myself somewhat included. I made it ahead of time, which I think is key, as it gives the soup a chance to develop its full flavor, and you can decide if you need to add anything. I made it up to the point of adding the salt and pepper, and then refrigerated it for 1.5 days. It came off as too sweet and bland, so I used the roasted garlic/onion suggestion and added salt and pepper to taste. I also served it with Sour Cream for people to top with if they desired (it adds a bit more oomph to the soup). Not only was the presentation beautiful, everyone at the table, including 7 & 5 year olds, and 35 year long beet haters, thought it was one of the best things they had ever eaten. It is definitely a repeat at our table. It is very filling, so I don't recommend it before a big meal, but it was fantastic!!! It's easy to make ahead - even the squash can be cooked a few hours before hand and then reheated before serving. Just watch out for the beet-red stains!!!
