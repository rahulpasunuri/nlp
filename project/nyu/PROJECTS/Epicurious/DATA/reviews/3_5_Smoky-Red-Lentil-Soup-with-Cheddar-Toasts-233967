This was okay--just rather bland. The kids prefer something with more flavor. It is quite similar in taste to split pea soup. So, I guess its fine if you are looking for that.

Simple and flavorful. I've made exactly to recipe, and also have adapted by throwing in a few things on hand like mushrooms, red pepper, or a handful of spinach. I like to use half stock and half water. Easily adaptable. Great rustic and also with quick whir of a stick blender which smoothes out the texture if you have a picky kid who doesn't like chunks. Great way to get outstanding nutrition into picky children. Freezes well should you have any leftovers, which is doubtful.

Quick, easy and delicious. Like other reviewers I added celery and used broth instead of water. The toasts were good, but I didn't think they were anything to write home about. I didn't think this made 6 servings though - we had it as a main course and it served us for 1 dinner for two with 1 portion leftover for lunch.

This is a great recipe. My only changes were to use chicken broth for half of the water (the amt I had on hand) and pureed about half of it. This is going to be a regular meal from now on.

very nice and simple soup. Not exactly 'out of this world', but a great weeknight meal. Don't skip the toasts -- they make the dish

I made this soup vegetarian by omitting the bacon, and replacing it with 1/2 cup shredded smoked Gouda (mixed in right before serving). I also replaced the water with vegetable stock to make up for some of the lost flavor, and in turn reduced the salt. It was comforting and delicious and VERY simple to make.

Rustic and delicious. I added celery, which added a nice flavor, and replaced half of the water with chicken stock. I would add one more slice of bacon next time--but I used very lean, farmer's market bacon. I also skipped the listed salt and pepper quantities and seasoned to taste. I went a bit too low on the med-low cooking instruction, so this took a bit too long to cook--next time med heat would be fine. The toasts were really wonderful and added a lot to the dish--I made about 12 to go along with the soup. Don't go too heavy on the mustard; some bites had an overwhelming mustard taste for me. Also: place one or two of the toasts on the bottom of the each dinner's bowl before serving the soup for a nice presentation and added rusticity in texture.

Simple and delicious. Used turkey bacon (more than two slices) and added one clove of garlic.

I used bacon lardons and when cooking was over, they floated to the top, where they could easily be removed. I then blitzed the soup with a blender, returned the bacon and re-heated it.

Fast and easy, and I really enjoyed the smoky flavour provided by the bacon. I used chicken broth instead of water.

After many failed lentil soup attempts, this is one I actually like!! However, next time I make it I would cut the salt and pepper in half- whoa it's peppery! I'm a salt fiend, and this soup is a tad on the salty side for me. But with these tweaks, I think it's a keeper.

Made this recipe a 2nd time for a potluck but put it through the blender at the end to make it smoother. Put the bacon in after the blending though. I know this added to the time but I felt it was well worth the effort.

This was simple,fast,healthy and easily modified. I added a package of chicken stock,1/2tsp cumin,1 1/2 tbsp of parsley. Forgot the salt and pepper so we added our own at dinner. Second day it was even tastier. Thanx for the quick fiber rich meal.

This was truly fast and easy to make with readily available ingredients. Even my 12 and 17 yr olds liked it. "Terrific" was the comment from the 17 yr old who also helped finish the prep.

The lentil soup is good, but simple, so it's definitely crucial to serve the cheddar toasts alongside it. The soup calls for quite a bit of pepper, so if you don't like a strong peppery flavor, consider reducing it.
