I really like this soup, but my husband hated it. I won't make it again based on that fact. He didn't like the ginger.

This was really good! Added diced carrots, julienned red pepper and red chilli paste. Used 1 can of lite coconut milk. I would use regular coconut milk next time. I didn't add noodles or rice because I served as an appetizer to another noodle dish. Absolutely delish!

Great recipe, especially for those who are unfamiliar with cooking Thai food. Took some others advice and I added a few carrots and bell pepper to the soup and less shiitake for a more diverse veggie mix and threw in the whole can of (not lite) Coconut milk. I also added chili sauce to give it more kick. Couldn't find cellophane noodles, so just soaked pad thai rice noodles for 25 minutes and threw it into the soup at the very end. Turned out awesome!

This is NOT anything like the soup of the same name served in Thai restaurants (Tom Ka Gai). It's pretty much a flavourless low-cal approximation. I should've known since the ratio of chicken stock to coconut milk is 6:1. I could only save this soup by making that ratio about 1:1 and adding more seasonings as well as some thai red curry paste and lemon grass.

I used cod instead of chicken, brown rice instead of noodles, added carrots, a whole can of full fat coconut cream, and I might have added a little more ginger than called for, and it turned out delicious! This one's definitely a keeper!

I just made this recipe and it was great. I did not fuss with the noodles, instead I added 1/2 cup jasmine rice (when i added the mushrooms). I added sliced cremini mushrooms instead of the shiitake. I also added 1 julienned red bell pepper. I was worried that the light coconut milk wouldn't come through in this soup, but it was excellent (not too strong of a coconut taste, but you could tell it was there- I added the whole 14oz can). The next time I make this soup I would cut the chicken into smaller pieces.

This was real tasty- so I assume it would turn out even better for people who can follow directions better than I! I realized halfway through I didn't have coconut milk and ended up searing the chicken pieces in coconut oil/blending unsweetened dried coconut with water to get some more coconutty flavor. Next time I make it I will not forget the coconut milk, and swap the chicken for shrimp, which I think would lend to the authenticity of the dish. I prefer a thicker soup as well, so I'd add red bell peppers, rice, and decrease the chicken broth.

We really liked this soup, which I made from available ingredients in the house. I added a T. of red chili paste warmed up with some of the leftover coconut milk in a little frying pan. I didn't have the Thai chilis or lime rind but it still had that Thai smell even before I added the chili paste. Reading a previous review, I just put the soaked noodles in at the end for a 3 min. cook, instead of trying to get them out in the middle of the process. That worked. I think you can play with the intensity of this soup but keep the basics.

I am obsessed with this soup. So easy to make, even a college student such as myself can make it. I crave it all the time, especially when it gets chilly. I added two extra chicken breasts when I made it since I bought a pack of 4, and it worked great. So so so good!

This is 'keeper'! I was actually surprised how rich and complex the flavors were. This one definitely makes you feel like you can cook to impress. I'm a pescatarian, so subbed shrimp and cubed tofu for the chicken.

I would make this again, but would omit putting the noodles in the soup. I found that step to be annoying- it was a pain to try and extract them with tongs and by the time they were out, they were overcooked anyway. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added red curry paste and really liked the addition. Based on other reviews, I purchased some lemongrass in case it needed it. However, the citrus from the juice and zest was sufficient (I may have added a tad bit more).

PS - add sugar about 2 tbl. and red pepper. Use cayenne instead of pepper.

Amazing! So fast and so delicious. I had to make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand and it was still absolutely wonderful. This will be my new winter staple for a fast soup on a cold day.

This was incredible. I did adjust by adding 1 1/2 cans of light (organic) coconut milk which made a huge difference and also added a bell pepper. Also instead of using a hot pepper I just sprinkled in cayenne pepper which works great and you can adjust to your liking. When I served this soup my guest's eyes lit up and immediately they insisted on getting the recipe from me, declaring it was the best thai they have ever had.

Great basic recipe! I infused the chicken stock with yellow curry paste, chopped lemongrass, garlic, shallots, and ginger. Just stirfry for 4 min and then add stock- simmer for 15 min and then pour through sieve. Delicious!

Great soup. Light and refreshing. Would add a julienned red pepper for some color and filler. Also, adding more coconut milk would make it a bit more rich...but the broth was tasty as is. Would definitely make again.

Excellent, vibrant flavour. I used dried Chinese mushrooms as fresh shiitakes were not available. Also added quartered fresh champignons to add a component as could not get spinach. The addition of turmeric gave dimension to the flavour while giving the broth a brilliant colour. My fiance and I both loved it. Will definitely make again.

I love this soup. At least the version I made of it. Changed it only a little: use a whole package of spinach (5 oz.), couldn't find the noodles so I boiled a cup of jasmine rice & left out the fungus. Sooo good & soo easy(once everything's cut). **If you haven't made this before be sure to prep. everything 1st. It cooks so fast there isn't much time to do anything after you starts.

Great-- with some changes it's like my Thai grandmother would make if I had a Thai grandmother... In general, the recipe is good but it missed some nuances of flavor. I skipped the noodles and the spinach, added shrimp, and made a smaller portion where the coconut milk was almost equal to the quantity of broth. Key additions were a few tablespoons of brown sugar (in lieu of palm sugar) and about 2 teaspoons of red curry paste which worked perfectly for the halved recipe.

Rating: 3
This recipe is simply lovely as it is written. Three forks, after all, means this dish was delicious. To make it a four-forker, though, there are a few changes I would make. Like some other reviewers mentioned, I would want to "beef up" the soup a bit by increasing some of the ingredients beyond the broth and coconut milk. And though I followed the recipe exactly for the most part, I ended up serving myself the soup without the noodles, and thought that instead I would indeed prefer jasmine rice (as others - see comments below - have done). Otherwise, looking past the noodles / rice, I plan on increasing the amount of spinach (at least doubling it), adding 2 red bell peppers instead of one (per another user's suggestion), throwing in a couple kaffir lime leaves (in addition to the lime already in the recipe), dicing 1 red chili (along with the jalapeno), adding some lemongrass (the soup needed something a bit more citrusy-sweet), and maybe (heaven forbid, more calories!) adding a touch of palm sugar (or brown sugar if you can't find palm) to contrast the heat / sour notes of the soup. OVERALL, may it be noted, the recipe was fantastic-o, and I will most definitely be making this again.

In an effort to keep things low carb I omitted the noodles. It was still very tasty and satisfying. Will definitely make it again.

This was really tasty and pretty simple. Use rice noodles if you don't have "cellophane" noodles. I threw in snow peas too at the end since they only take 4 minutes to cook to a bright green. I used more lime than lemon for the zest and increased it to 1 TBL. For the juice I did 50/50 lime & lemon. I added the whole can of coconut milk (14 oz) and some chili paste at the end because it needed more kick. Didn't use cilantro and it was fine.

I absolutely love this recipe. There is another highly rated thai soup on epicurious similar to this one, so I tried them both. Not only is this one much healthier, I actually preferred the taste of this one. The only changes I settled on are adding an extra chicken breast, and it seems to work great with 1 tbsp of just lime zest instead of both lemon and lime zest. Excellent recipe that I will be making the rest of my life.

I LOVE this soup! I make it for family, company, and just for myself. When I prepare it, I use two cans of chicken broth and one entire can of light coconut milk. I reduce the fish sauce to one tablespoon, because I like that flavor to be more subtle. I add chopped red bell pepper for color. I can skip the zest, if pressed for time. It's a very flexible recipe.

This was sooo heavenly delicious. It's one of THE most flavorful soup I've ever had and, it's easy. Can't beat that. I did use a whole red jalapeno pepper, seeds and all. Yumm

Incredible flavor. I modified the recipe in the following way: Seranno peppers in place of Thai/Jalepeno. Extra garlic. Other than that, by the book. The prep time wasn't bad at all. Cutting the ingredients was pretty much it, and you could do that while the noodles are soaking. I would highly recommend this as a 'first exposure' dish for people wanting to experience Thai-Style food at home due to its ease of preparation, access of ingredients at the local grocer, and tremendous flavors.

PS In Europe we don't know cellophane noodles, so I selected noodles which are quite transparent and are made from green beans, not rice. So my earlier comment about the noodles keeping brilliantly well in a tub for day 2 should be taken with that in mind.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe. I skipped the cilantro and it did not lack anything for it. I used the zest of 1 whole lemon and 1 whole lime only because teaspoons of zest is just daft! I used the juice of the whole lemon and half of the lime. It is FABULOUS. And it gets even better on the 2nd day. THe noodles keep in the fridge and can be microwaved and although the spinach loses a bit of green it is otherwise fine but you could add more fresh stuff the second day. A tremendous recipe that I will use again and again - sophisticated, subtle, well balanced, not too spicy or coconutty or citrussy. Just A+ tasty! Oh! One small thing: I didn't need to add any salt and I did not add the 4th tablespoon of fish sauce - didn't need it.

Just made it mostly as recipe called for, loved it. It is quite mildly spiced compared to the Tom Kha Kai I've had in restaurants. Next time: I will add lemongrass; use galanga rather than ginger; double the garlic; double the Thai green chilis (no red avlbl here) from 4 to 8; and double the limes. It needs more zest if you are used to eating in Thai restaurants.

The first ingredient of "noodles" is not listed. I didn't realize that I was missing an ingredient from my shopping list until I went to prepare the soup and the instructions started with "place noodles in a bowl". I'll have to wait until another time to make this.

so good and easy! (well, once i got through all the grating!) i omitted one cup of the chicken broth, we like a more intense flavor. also used rice noodles instead of cellophane, which kept well the next day by keeping them in an airtight container separate from the soup. looking forward to making this again this winter!

Fabulous! I kept the seeds and ribs of the peppers in the soup, because my husband and I love spice. It was a great level of spice. I followed the previous reviewer's advice by adding more ginger and adding 1/4 C of the coconut milk at the end. Next time I might add more spinach, because I love spinach. Keep the shiitake mushrooms in the recipe. -It compliments the fish sauce nicely. I used approximately 3 oz of rice noodles in the dish. We make a lot of Asian recipes that call for rice, so the noodles provided a great alternative. Unlike other reviewers, I have never been to Thailand, but this recipe makes me want to take a trip there!

Yum! and easy. I used kale instead of spinach because I had it. I also added 3 leftover cherry tomatoes because they are like fireworks for the mouth. I added sliced button mushrooms becuase it sounded good. I thought the lime juice was going to overpower, but it mellowed right at the end. I served it over jasmine rice and it was a lovely dinner on the deck. On elearning was to shake the coconut milk before opening.

An exceptional recipe! Perfect soup to clear those sinuses on a chilly day. I added about 6 thai bird chilies and kept the seeds in two of them, found the heat to be just right. I also substituted quartered crimini mushrooms for the shiitakes. Forget the noodles, ladle over hot jasmine rice and enjoy!

Very good. I am used to making authentic Thai soup...good tips on how to use the Asian ingredients are on a Thaifoodtonight recipe blog. I usually use the galinga root, lemongrass etc... but this was very good and according to my husband, "refreshing "--my seven year old son loved it too. My modifications: I used about three times the ginger (about two and one half inches of fresh peeled ginger, chopped up in food processor (about 3TBS. I used about 5 medium garlic cloves. I also did not have mushrooms handy so I used 5 cups of baby spinach instead of the two. I also used more Thai Green chilies-- about 8-10 seeded and diced. I also used three large chicken breasts diced up small. I used one can of coconut milk (about 2 cups) and lessened the chicken broth to 5 cups (since I had 1 additional cup of coconut milk). When using the coconut milk, I added about 1-1/2 cup of it with the chicken and then added the remaining 1/2 cup of it when the heat was turned off (after the spinach was cooked). I learned this tip from cooking authentic Thai. It is a trick to keep the coconut milk taste fresh as can be. I too also served it over cooked white jasmine rice (no noodles).

This is a version of Tom Kha Gai, a soup found at virtually every Thai restaurant. There are variations depending on what region of Thailand the recipe came from and personal tastes I suppose. Usually without mushrooms though sometimes with straw or button mushrooms. Typically without tomatoes, though sometimes with. I've not seen it with spinach, but why not. Usually it is prepared with galangal as opposed to ginger - they are cousins, but quite different. And you will generally find lemon grass in the soup as well. I've never had it with noodles, but I would recommend rice noodles if you want. Many Thai's add some jasmine rice to the bowl and then ladle soup over the rice. This is my preference. I've not found a restaurant that won't bring some jasmine rice with the soup when requested. I've eaten this soup at probably 100 different restaurants - each time a little different. Enjoy the wonderful balance and contrast of flavors.

I suspect SELF Magazine added one packet of bean threads to improve the nutrition stats, since that's what they do: modify for health. I would leave them out and have jasmine rice on the side, not sticky rice. Also, I use fresh button mushrooms, not shitaake, which don't always go well with Thai food.

I haven't made this, but would like to. However, I don't see any 'noodles' called for in the list of ingredients! I agree rice noodles, not cellophane noodles are appropriate. The amount to use is only important if you are counting on the accuracy of the nutritional analysis.

I never made this recipe, but some are asking what kind of noodles to use. If they say to soak for 15 minutes in hot water, almost 100% certain they mean rice stick noodles. They look like linguine but are clear, made out of rice, not wheat. Cellophane noodles are also called bean thread noodles. They too will look clear when cooked, but are much finer. And they cook almost instantaneously.

I am not a cook by any means but made this last night for my family. They loved it! There are a lot of steps and different ingredients but the flavours are well worth the effort.
