love the mushrooms, but the rosemary is over-powering.

My meat-loving husband actually begs me to make these and prefers them over his usual favorite, hamburgers. I took the advice from the Houston reviewer below and added 1/2 a roasted red bell pepper. Delicious!!!

This one hits the trifecta: quick, healthy, and delicious. It's going in the regular rotation for sure. I used grainy dijon in the mayo mixture and it added some nice texture.

Even after reading the review below I added all of the rosemary to the mayo by mistake. It was so good that I'll do that again. Served with roasted rosemary potatoes (not sure what I was thinking but they worked) which were unbelievable dipped in the extra mayonnaise mixture too. Maybe I'll make this for my sister-in-law!!!!

This is so delicious! I used regular mayonnaise and followed the advice from a previous reviewer to put the mayonnaise spread together early in the day to allow the flavors to meld. Accidentally put all the rosemary in the mayo rather than putting some on the mushrooms as they were grilling, but it was still fantastic. Will make it often!

So simple and so good! I've made this several times already. Excellent each time.

This recipe was excellent. I would recommend getting very large buns that will fit the mushrooms. Also, I would recommend not using nonfat mayo. I loved the way this came out.

What a treat! The flavor was exceptional. I made the dijon mixture early in the day to let the flavors meld. The whole wheat buns are a perfect foil for the other tastes and textures. I included half a roasted red pepper with each burger, and topped them with an organic herb salad mix for extra yumminess and nice presentation. I made a batch of sweet potato oven fries alongside, and we dipped the fries in the extra dijon mixture. So delish!

Made this as an alternative to cheeseburgers and they were fantasic. It was super easy and really delicious. It does make plenty or mayo mixture.

My husband can't stop raving about how "gourmet" this tasted. This from a man who claims to dislike both mayo and rosemary!

This was pretty good. The only change we made was adding a slice of cheese. Will make again.

This was a great, easy recipe. I had some of the mayo left over and had it on a sandwich the next day and it was even better.

Thanks to Erin from Philly. I too tried grilled chicken breasts with this recipe and they were wonderful. Instead of the whole wheat buns I used a toasted grain bread with olives. A slice of Vidalia onion is recommended as well. Load up on the arugula.

I made this dish for my husband and he loved it. Said it was worlds better than the usual ham or turkey sandwich. I did add a roasted red bell pepper sliced in strips, and grilled the roll. Delish!

pretty good, can halve the mayo mixture

When it comes right down to it, I didn't really make this recipe at all--but I adapted it and, using the basic directions that were here, came up with what I thought was one of the best sandwiches _ever_. We grilled the portobellos according to the recipe, plus some red peppers. Those topped a grilled marinated chicken breast and were accompanied by a slightly modified basil mayonnaise (chopped garlic instead of mustard) on hamburger buns. It was just divine. I'm sure that this recipe as it reads is great, too, but it's nice to see that there's so much room for modifications of your own. Don't be afraid to experiment a little! The portobellos were o so good.

This dish is fabulous! I have vegitarian house guests and I was looking for something that would satisfy them and keep my beef eating husband happy. My guests have asked me to make it again - and again. They are long time vegans and have never tasted anything this good. I cannot imagine ever wanting to eat beef burgers again. Thank you for this fabulous substitute and for showing me that vegitarian meals do not have to mean just tons of vegetables cooked as usual: they can be exciting and incredibly delicious.

Wonderful and easy. No fuss no muss. I used fresh baked Ciabata bread in place of buns but I think that whatever you use would be fine. Burgers are a comfort food even for those of us who don't eat meat. I used a stove-top grill pan and the result was fine. Smokey, but fine. With the exception of the arugula, I would add anything your heart desires as far as toppings (meaning, include the arugula for some green bite). Anything crunchy (I served coleslaw) as a side dish would be a nice compliment.

I didn't have any arugula or wheat buns, so I used lettuce, sprouts and oat bread. It was still delicious! And very easy.

I have made this for family and guests and everyone has enjoyed it. I used pita instead of rolls and found that delightful.
