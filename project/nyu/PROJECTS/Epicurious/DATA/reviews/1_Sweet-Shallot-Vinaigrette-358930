I'm going to substitute honey for the brown sugar and fresh lemon juice for the white wine vinegar and then add a teaspoon of dijon mustard...that would be a light vinaigrette...

It IS light, and it IS easy, but it is NOT flavorful. It's unobtrusive and edible, but there's isn't any flavor to it. I couldn't even detect the presence of shallots (and I love shallots). It was oily, with the faintest "zip" from the vinegar. I'd have been one unhappy camper if I'd made this for dinner guests. I'll finish off what I made, but won't be making it again. I don't even know what else I'd add to it to make it more flavorful... :-(
