I've been making this recipe, as stated, for years now, & it has never let me down. Everyone raves about it whenever I make it, & the basic focaccia recipe provided supports a variety of toppings to customize your bread to your tastes. It is a lot of dough, but I've always just split it into two 9" round cake pans; they come out just fine, & if one loaf makes it to the freezer, I have beautiful homemade bread for unexpected company at dinner!

I love this recipe- it's practically indestructible. I do add a TON more garlic to the olive oil and let it sit overnight before baking to really give it a pop. I also put the roasted garlic cloves in the indents on the top before baking. As someone suggested, definitely brush with more of the garlic oil right before and right after baking. I usually end up using 1 cup of oil plus a bit. Coarse salt, pepper, and good rosemary are essential on top.

I thought this was good. Be warned--this makes an enormous amount of bread! I think it originally was in an article for a buffet for a lot of people. Next time, I'll make half. I didn't even have a baking pan large enough--I had to use a roasting pan!

This is a great recipe. The one modification I would make is brushing some of the garlic oil on top after it is baked. I also saved the roasted garlic after baking it for people to spread on top of the bread. Half of this recipe served 6 people easily!

Wonderful texture and flavor . . . I liked this as is, but next time, I might add some fresh thyme and chopped garlic to the dough and then finish with the rosemary, coarse salt and pepper.

I made this for my womens group everyone raved. I can't believe how easy it was to make. This is a guaranteed hit.

Everyone loved this focaccia. I added some parmesan, thyme, and rosemary to the dough. I also added thyme and parmesan along with the rosemary on top of dough right before baking. If using freshly grated parmesan, I would sprinkle it on the last 5 minutes of baking or it browns and hardens too much. I baked it for less than 20 minutes and it was perfect!! Try dipping it in Williams Sonoma lemon/garlic olive oil -- yum.

This foccacia is great! I used two smaller baking dishes, and it still came out well. I highly recommend it- don't skimp on the olive oil.

I make a similar recipe with the chopped rosemary. To obtain a stronger garlic flavor, I slice the garlic very thin, spread it over the focaccia and into the indents. The garlic roasts in the oil as the loaf cooks and pervades the bread.

Pretty good. I had good luck using the dough blade in my Cuisinart. Needs some kind of kick.

This was wonderful. I never made dough before and found this very easy. I added fresh basil, parmesan & cracked pepper to the dough & also used garlic flavored oil. Then before I baked it I added more parmesan, garlic, red peppers, onions, tomatoes & mozzerella....yummmmy! Will definitely make it again & again.

I make this often, to great reviews. Agree with Eric on the sea salt; I use kosher salt for texture, and grind the pepper on the course setting. Ultimate easy way is to use purchased garlic olive oil, such as Consorzio; works fine and is a time saver. A nice touch is to add freshly grated parmesan or romano (both?) before baking.

Agree with one of the other reviewers that can shortcut by simmering crushed garlic in oil rather than baking for an hour. Can reserve the crushed garlic and distribute over the top of the focaccia with the remaining oil before baking. A bit of sea salt is nice on top as substitute for finer table variety. Half recipe works fine.

This was very easy to make and very tasty but no one noticed there was garlic in it.

Good recipe, I will make it again. Next time, though, will reduce the baking time by about five minutes; finished product was slightly dry. Also, a good time-saving suggestion is to simply saute the garlic in olive oil; same results.

I decided not to spend an hour and a half baking the garlic and olive oil, instead, I smashed the cloves of garlic with a knife and sauteed them with the oil in a pan on the stove. It only took a few minutes to cook the garlic and the flavor was great!! Also, I halved the recipe and used a 9 and 1/2 inch round pan which wokred fine.

My version turned out thinner than anticipated, and the bread was somewhat dry and crunchy in places. I did not have an 11x17 pan and instead used a 9x13 and a 9x9. I must have spread the dough out too thin, although it seemed right by the description. I may try this recipe again by halving the quantities. The flavor was good.

Wonderful!! And the house smells so good after roasting the garlic! Easy and impressive: it makes a huge loaf.

This was really good! It looks a lot more difficult and time-consuming than it really is. I recommend using kosher salt for the coarse salt called for. Additionally, I found the kneading time for my mixer (KitchenAid stand mixer with dough hook) to be way too long. The description of how it should look/feel was much more reliable than the time cited. And don't throw away the garlic! What's with that? It is fabulous roasted garlic - spread it on the bread or make garlic butter.

Thank goodness my husband potted our fresh rosemary for indoor use so we were able to use it in this bread. Very tender flavorful bread. Will use it again soon.
