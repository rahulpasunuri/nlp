So easy. I also used dark molasses. Served it with sautéed cabbage & onions, mashed potatoes and home made applesauce. I added a little sherry to sauce and let it simmer a few minutes. Delicious!!

Outstanding. I just reread the recipe, and realized I neglected to save the marinade to boil. Will not omit this step next time, but I am not sure it will be needed.

Delicious recipe, would pair well with sauerkraut and German potato salad. I would leave out the last tablespoon of vinegar to give it more of a mustard flavor in the future.

I love this recipe, it is easy and yummy. When I make this I usually prepare the marinade before work and leave the pork in it all day. I have grilled and pan seared/roasted both cooking methods work very well. Enjoy!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I used full strength blackstrap molasses since that type of molasses are much higher in iron. It turned out just sweet enough! I baked my tenderloin in the oven will potatoes, carrots and zuchini and it was all delicious with the extra sauce in the bottom of the pan. I will definitely make this recipe again!

The final product was acceptable for a quick dinner. My husband enjoyed it. I marinaded the pork in the sauce for 8 hours. I baked it in the oven for 30-40 mn at 350 degree.

We really enjoyed this preparation. It's cold and rainy here in Seattle in February, so we roasted the pork in the oven and it was excellent. I'm sure it would be even better on the grill. I found the marinade too strong to use as a sauce, perhaps because we were using a full-strength molasses.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! And it can't possibly be any easier to prepare. Just be careful if you're cooking on a grill. Between the fat or the pork loin and the molasses, I battled flare-ups the entire time. But it was so good that my mother made it just a couple weeks after I did. Used her oven without issue.

I've made this dish 3x in the past 2 months and it always comes out great. So quick to prep and doesnt take long to cook either. I dont serve the sauce along side of the meat but my sister in law does and she says its great. I would suggest using a good quality pork since it makes all the difference. So glad I found this recipe...a keeper for sure!

Since it is near 80 degrees here,I grilled this pork Tenderloin tonight. I had most of the simple ingredients, mild molassas, apple cider vinegar, and mustard, but not the dijon type or the course grained mustard, just the plain ole mustard, it still turned out really good!...company worthy even!

Very good! I doubled up on the marinade and used ½ for the pork and the other ½ for the sauce (I dont like cooking with marinade of the meat). The family really liked it!

Easy. Rave reviews from guests. Used all or 1/2 pomegranate molasses.

Don't let this recipe's simplicity fool you---it's a winner in terms of taste AND ease. I used Inglehofer's brand of course-ground mustard; I also added two extra TBs of molasses, just to be sure the "bite" of the mustards and vinegars were tempered a bit more. Also, I used two tenderloins weighing about 1/2 pound each. Even so, there was still plenty of sauce for marinating and serving. Again, it's a home run recipe!

Rating: 3
This couldn't be easier. I only had full flavor molasses, and that was fine. I also had some Grey Poupon, some maple mustard and then had to make my own from ground mustard. However, it was still very tasty. That said, it isn't the most exciting recipe in the world. But, for 2 minutes of prep time, I can hardly complain. Also, I cooked it in the oven as opposed to on the grill, which I'm sure would have been great if I had one!

Rating: 4
Pretty foolproof recipe - I didn't have mild molasses, so I replaced 1/3 of the molasses with honey, and it turned out great. I agree with other readers that it is a good idea to make a double recipe of the marinade. I was worried that the pork would be dry after 20 minutes on the grill, but it was moist and full of flavor. I've made this twice already!

Rating: 3
Enjoyed making this, especially thickening the sauce at the end - very tasty. In my experience though, you need to keep the meat moist on the grill, I made some extra marinade and basted the tenderloin throughout cooking, that way it was nice and juicy. Turned out well.

This is a huge hit with family and friends every time I make it. It's very easy to do, yet comes out nice enough for special occassions. I use 1/2 honey and 1/2 regular molasses for the marinade/sauce. I usually double the marinade to have extra sauce. To cook it, I heat the (gas) grill very high for about 15 minutes, then turn off the burner on one side and cook the pork with indirect heat for 10 mins/side with the lid closed (fatter end of pork towards the heat). I cook the pork to a temp of about 150F for nice juicy slightly pink meat and let it rest for about 10 minutes covered with foil. I served this recently with asparagus roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt & pepper for 10 minutes while the pork rested - wonderful!

We had this a a friend's house. It was so good I had to find the receipe.

This sauce has a very, very strong flavor, which was only redeemed by the fact that the pork was so tough there was little that could be overwhelmed. The sugary marinade burned on my grill and made the crust far too chewy. For my money, the Pork Tenderloin with Rhubarb-Currant Chutney is a better grilled pork recipe by far.

I pan fried pork medallions and used this sauce to pour over the medallions when they were done cooking. It was delicious! I used regular molasses, not light molasses and it still turned out great.

This recipe was soooo good. I took the suggestion of some reviewers and doubled the marinade. I didn't have "light mild flavored molasses" so just used regular and the sauce was just fine. The flavor was complex and so very yummy! Everyone at the table loved it! Would definitely make this again...it was really easy as well.

145 degrees is way too cold unless you like pork tartar.

Folks are right: this is big on flavor and small on effort. As many others did, I added a couple cloves of crushed garlic to boost the savory notes in the dish. Also, when turning the marinade into a pan sauce, I included a generous splash of heavy cream instead of the additional tablespoon of cider vinegar. It helped round and soften the flavors and added a smooth mouthfeel.

What a wonderfully easy recipe. The flavor was exceptional. I decided to brine my pork tenderloin overnight before marinating it and it was extra tender and juicy. Let it marinate at least over night or longer if you have the time. Definately company fare.

Decided to pursue it even with only 45 minutes for it to sit in the marinade. Still delicious. Easy to make, perfect for the grill which adds a nice smokiness.

This dish was so easy and delicious. I've never made a pork tenderloin so I was a bit nervous but it came out perfectly. My husband was raving about how tasty the sauce was. Even my kids--2.5 years and 10 months old liked it (not so much the sauce though, more for us!) I added crushed garlic to the marinade for extra something something. Served with wild rice and sauteed snap peas and it was awesome and so pretty. This is definitely something I'll make again and again, especially for company.

This took longer than I anticipated, I should have butterflied the thicker end. When it was grilled, eye appeal was there but the flavor just didn't do it for us. I have grilled pork tenderloin with molasses but the spices used were more on the southwestern flair served w/avacado & tortillas. This one just didn't do it for me.

This was excellent. We've rarely had this cut be as tender, which I attribute to the marinade. I only drizzled a little of the sauce over slices. Although very tasty, it is quite strong and could easily overpower the meat. Served with a wonderful apple compote and wild rice.

I couldn't find any 'light' flavoured molasses so I used dark which worked fine. The marinade needs pepper and more of the dijon to punch the flavour up, but everyone we served this to thought it was great. i doubled the sauce because we had two pork tenderloins but we really didn't need too - the recipe makes a ton of sauce

It was a hit at my dinner party last weekend!!! Just wipe off the marinade before tossing on the bbq, otherwise the molasses chars the pork.

I could've sworn I had apple cider vinegar in the pantry! But I didn't. As a last minute substitute I used red wine vinegar instead. Also, like another reviewer suggested, I added thyme. OUTSTANDING! The grill time took more than the recipe instructed, but it was so worth the wait.

Rating: 4
We made this last night and decided it's one of the best ever recipes for pork tenderloin. The only change we made was to add 2 cloves of crushed garlic and also some fresh thyme...just because we had it and wanted to use it up. This is definitely a keeper and we'll make it often. I'm betting the marinade would also be great with chicken. Wish we had some leftovers!!

I agree with the reviewer from Nova Scotia. Be sure to use the correct ingredients. This is a wonderful, flavorful main dish that was enjoyed by my parents all the way down to my granddaughter. I usually make a recipe my own by changing it to our tastes, but not this one! I would encourage you to enjoy it as written first and then see if you need to make any changes.

I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful. To those who just used Grey Poupon and then did not like the recipe; first of all Grey Poupon is not a true Dijon mustard (try a real one sometime and you will really notice!), and omitting the coarse mustard will really change the flavours as well. So if you haven't made it the right way please don't disparge it!

Instead of grilling pork tenderloin, I made the marinade as described (plus some smashed garlic cloves as another reviewer suggested) and used it on 2 giant, boneless pork chops. After draining the chops, I seared them on each side in a non-stick pan for 4 min per side then finished them in the oven for another 8 min at 400. I reduced the marinade as described and this was just great! Next time I'm making double sauce!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! Marinated for 1 hour then grilled pork on BBQ. Took the leftover marinade and reduced it in a saucepan on the stove and used it on the sliced pork. Cooking it takes some of the vinegar tartness out. This marinade tastes like homemade BBQ sauce. It is excellent if you use leftover pork and sauce for sandwiches the next day. Loved it.

Great flavor. To ensure perfectly grilled pork tenderloin (slightly pink at center), just remember this combo: 7-6-5. Grill on high for 7 minutes, turn and grill 6 minutes. Turn off grill and wait five minutes. Let the tenderloin rest about 10 minutes on a plate tented with foil, and you're in biz. Try it.

This was absolutely yummy and I know this recipe will be a regular. The only problem was pork on the rare side, which I discovered once we had sliced it. I ended up putting the slices on the grill for a min./side, covered with the grill lid. Maybe the coals were too hot, so the skin burned but the center didn't cook through.

I had to quadruple the recipe because I was making it for a crowd and it was a huge it. I didn't have molasses so I used Lyle's Golden Syrup (a delicious sugar syrup from England). I cut a big pork roast into 4 smaller roasts, marinated them overnight and then grilled them as suggested. What an easy alternative to the typical grilled fare of summer!!! The reduced sauce over the pork makes the dish. YUM!!!

This was quick and easy to make and, like the previous reviewer said, made with ingredients I always have on hand. My tenderloin came out juicy and delicious. Served with the herbed bread and tomato salad on this site and grilled corn. Easy for weeknights when you want to grill but don't know what to do with that pork tenderloin.

Great quick prep recipe, using items I already have in the pantry. Handy recipe as I can combine marinade and pork in a zip top bag, then freeze it. When ready to use, thaw in fridge overnight and the dish is ready to cook at dinner time with no additional prep. The marinade holds up well to freezing/thawing.

The flavors were nice, it stayed moist on the grill, and there was plenty of sauce for pouring over. I needed to triple the recipe, which worked fine.
