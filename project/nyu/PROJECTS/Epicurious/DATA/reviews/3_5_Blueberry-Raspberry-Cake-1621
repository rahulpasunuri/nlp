After reading the prior reviews, I tweaked the recipe and ended up using almost an entire container of fat free sour cream (probably close to 2 1/2 - 2 3/4 c) and I probably upped the berries by at least 1/2 c each. The cake was awesome - took it to a pot luck and had no left overs to take home, much to my family's chagrin!

Dry and poorly flavoured. It needed some icecream added.

This was a very good cake. It was dense but moist (almost like a pound cake) and the topping went all chewy after it had cooled to room temperature. I used brown sugar for the topping and I added about 1 tbsp of vanilla extract to the cake part. The batter was REALLY thick but I didn't add anything to it. I ended up having to mix the last bit of flour in with a spoon. I used rhubarb instead of raspberries because that's what I had and the tart fruit went well with the sweet cake and topping. All in all a great tasting and easy cake to make.

I will never understand how people can make all kinds of substantive changes to a recipe and then proceed to "review" it!! Coconut,yogurt, baking soda??? I made this recipe as written, and found it a moderately good coffee cake. It was rather dry, and could have used twice the amount of fruit, or some syrupy or fruit-filling type addition to the layering. It was definitely not a dessert. We served it with vanilla ice cream, which helped make it more moist, but it was definitely more popular for breakfast the next day. It was much more like a muffin than a cake.

I made this coffee cake today and it's great. In the topping I use vietnamese Cinnamon, which is sweeter and more aromatic. I used 1/2cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar I also addded 1 cup of angel flake coconut. I had never read a cake recipe using sour cream as an ingrediant without calling for baking soda, so I added a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda to the flour mixture. I cannot compare it to a cake not using baking soda, but the cake had a nice rise and the texture was light and very nice. I also added 1tsp. of vinalla to the batter. I was about 1/4 cup short of sour cream and so I added enough White Mountain Premium Bulgarian Yogurt (full fat). This worked fine as a substitute. I used 2/3 of the batter for the bottom of the baking pan and covered the batter with blueberries(no raspberries available) I put dollops of batter distributed over the top of the berries and then spread the batter with a small plastic spatula, which covered most of the berries. The topping covered every thing completely. I baked the cake for 40 minutes at 375*.I used a ceramic baking pan that was 14" x 9 1/2"

I made the cake for a 4th of July party, using two cups of blueberrries and sliced nectarines. Many compliments from adults and kids who devoured it. Great with our bbq, a nice way to use fresh summer fruit.

I baked this in a 9-inch round cake pan that was deep (3 inches) for a different format. It is excellent. To me, it is more formal than a coffee cake, but not a fine-grained cake. It made a great birthday cake. Really good. Everyone enjoyed it. I have also made it with just blueberries and it's great that way too.

Easy, yet delicious coffeecake recipe. Baked for only 42 minutes which resulted in a very light, tender and moist cake. Used 2 cups of fresh blueberries, but would recommend increasing it by an additional 1/2 cup. Yes, the batter is thick, but just follow the instructions on layering and once the last cake layer is on, smooth the top with a spatula---this helps blend it well. Can't say enough, this recipe is a keeper.

While looking for something else, I ran into this recipe. I have made this great coffee cake quite a few times. I follow the recipe and it always comes out great. It's good for dessert, breakfast or tea, and kids really like it.

Having read the other reviews about thick batter, I opted to put all the batter on the bottom layer, with the berries on top and then the topping. This worked just fine and seemed to please all who ate it.

I've made this cake dozens of times, with different berries from my garden. Rave reviews every time. I do increase the fruit, and cut 5 to 10 minutes from baking time.

I made this cake for my wedding back in 1991 and it was awesome! We had lost the issue with this recipe and I was inspired to look for it online. I have issues going back to the 80's and was very happy to find it again!

We loved this! The dough is thick and a little hard to spread but it turns out delicious. I agree about the glass baking dish...bake it for less time.

I have had much better cakes then this one, topping was to sweet, cake was to dry and bland, berries sank to the bottom. Really not worth it.

This is a great recipe to use up all the berries from my garden. I use brown sugar in the topping recipe to give it more of a streusel flavor. I also add a little vanilla to the cake to give it more flavor. It is a moist cake that doesn't last long at my house.

This is super-moist, rich, and yummy, and pretty easy. I put in a little more sour cream but I don't think you need to--but why not? :) I put a little less sugar which is a good idea since the topping is so sweet. I used a frozed mixed berry package which worked well. I added a little milk--my mixer nearly overheated, the batter was so thick! But that's part of the fun of baking!

This was really good. The batter is pretty thick and requires some patience when spreading it. I used a glass baking pan and it was ready in 50 minutes instead of 1 hour. The topping makes this cake very yummy.

A perfect, not to sweet, crumb cake. I added blackberries and put more fruit then the recipe called for in it and it was delish.

This cake was very good. It was easy to make and was delicious warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream!

This cake has the potential to be delicious, but I found the batter to be a little dry and the cooking time was way too long. I would suggest adding some milk to the batter and reducing the cooking temperature and cooking time.
