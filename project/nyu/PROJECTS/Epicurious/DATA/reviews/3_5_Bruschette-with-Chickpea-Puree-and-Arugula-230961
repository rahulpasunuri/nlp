Because I didn't have chickpeas in the house when I made this recipe, I decided to use white beans. That substitution made the puree sooooo creamy and smooth. I added a little garlic, and I think some extra lemon juice. I was doing it all by taste. But even my pickiest of guests stuffed their faces with these little treats. Fantastic!

I absolutely love this recipe. I add extra lemon juice, garlic and black pepper to the chickpea puree to give it a bit more taste. Everyone in my house gobbles it up.

The hummus was a little bland for my taste, but I added more lemon juice, and it fixed the problem. Toasting the bread is definately necessary, or else it gets too soggy. It was a really nice recipe, and it is on my menu for Christmas Eve!

This is my breakfast almost every day. I use a rustic sourdough, toast it, spread a store-bought hummus (w/ olives) and top with chopped arugula and sometimes with tomatos. I get the ingredients at Trader Joes.

Quite good, especially with an extremely peppery arugula, which provides a great balance to the lemony chickpea puree. I skipped skinning the chickpeas and didn't have any problems. An easy, pretty, tasty (if a little filling) appetizer that works especially well with an extra crispy, thinly-sliced peasant bread.

Good recipe, even better when you personalize it with your own favorites, e.g. garlic or red pepper.

This was very good and also looked nice and colorful on a plate. I added one small clove of garlic to the chickpea puree, though, because it seemed to need it. Skinning the chickpeas was not fun. Next time I'm going to try half with skinned and half with unskinned and compare them to see if skinning is necessary.

Excellent! Everyone loved it! Made a few minor changes. 1) I infused the olive oil with a clove of smashed garlic, 2) for various reasons, I bought "classic" hummus 3) I added chopped calamata olives to the arugula 4) I wasn't sure what they meant by arugula salad (if they wanted a dressing on it) so after the toasts were spread w/the hummus, I sprinkled balsamic vinegar and a splash of olive oil on the arugula and olives, tossed and spooned on the toasts. Next time, I thought I'd try the toasts w/goat cheese. YUM!!!

With ingredients like these, how could this dish not be good? I made it for a get together and all the guests raved about it. Somewhat time intensive but well worth the preparation (especially the chickpea de-skinning step).
