Actually is very easy to make and has become a requested dessert every year. I usually make some meringue mushrooms and use a little of my pine & holly to decorate.

Was delighted to know someone else made "mice" to add to the scene. They're adorable! This was the first "buche" I'd ever made. Cake and ganache worked perfectly. Filling was a curdled disaster, so turned to Fanny Farmer and her cooked buttercream filling with orange zest and orange liqueur. Luscious and held up well. Cut off both ends on the diagonal for a large and a small "branch" and attached them with a bit of ganache. With the egg whites left over from the filling my daughter and I made meringue mushrooms and spotted them around, then - just for ridiculous excess - made small holly leaves and berries of marzipan. Spectacular and lots of fun.

I followed the tips here (chill everything, roll in a towel, etc.) and had no problems with this. It turned out beautifully, along with marzipan mushrooms made by my 9yo daughter. Everyone was very impressed with how it looked. The filling is delicious. But in the end, it was just okay. I'm glad we had a lemon pie and brownies as backup, because the buche was so rich and not everyone liked it. A lot of trouble for a so-so dessert.

{Sorry post so long, a lot to explain!}Was challenge and a success! Made a second batch of filling because the first one bombed. The cream/gelatin mixture was too warm when I added it to the whipped cream mixture and it went flat. Second try I used boiling water in the gelatin, but left the ¼ cup cream cold instead of heating it up as suggested. I mixed the cold cream and gelatin then put it in the fridge for a few minutes while I whipped the rest of the cream. By the time I had soft peaks, gelatin mixture cooled and started to solidify. I added gelatin mixture to the whipped cream mixture and whipped till I had the stiff peaks. I put the whole thing in the fridge till I was ready to fill the cake. Before I inverted the cake, I dusted with the recommended cocoa powder but I must have put a little more of it on one side than the other. After I inverted the cake, and filled it, I began to roll it up. OH-NO! only half the cake came up off the foil, the other half was sticking to it. I discovered that the half that had the heavier application of cocoa, was the side that didnt stick. So next time I make this cake I will put plenty of cocoa all over the cake so it doesnt stick after its inverted! I managed to peel most of the cake off the foil but a small layer of it was left on the foil. Due to the sticking problem it was very hard to roll it up and as a result I rolled it rather loosely. My resulting flattened Yule log looked more like half a log or a yodel as my husband said {he- he!}. It still looked great especially after I put the ganache on, made lines with a wide fork and dusted with confectioners sugar. My ganache went on easily over the cocoa. I didnt refrigerate the ganache, before I used it. I just let it rest and cool, then I whipped it. The result was a light, delicate, not overly sweet,delicious!

I forgot to say. I substituted the cream of tartar for 3 tsp citrus juice and the corn syrup with ahorn syrup (Yes, I'm a proud Canadian :)). It all worked just as well.

I put the ganache in the refrigerator and had to very lightly reheat it to soften it up before applying. My bad. Otherwise the dark chocolate and orange flavor blend beautifully. Cake did not crack, everything went together well. Well worth the time and effort.

I was thrilled with this cake. I had some fun with decorating it to look more like a log on a forrest floor by adding mango slice shelf mushrooms and cherry chocolate mice. After all, whats a dessert without fungus and vermin? The mice were made of chocolate dipped stemmed maraschino cherries for body and tail, cherry cordial Hershey kisses for the head and almond slice ears. The cake was set on coconut shaving "snow".

Surprisingly I had the most problem with the ganache then the cake or filling. My cake did crack but the ganache covered it fine. As for the filling it came out perfectly the first time. I did put the bowl and whisk in the freezer the night before and had no problems. As for the ganache, it took quite a while for the ganache to come to a soft peak. I first tried with a whisk then broke out the electric mixer. Even with the mixer it took almost 5 mins. In the end it did come out well. Cake was delicious and looked great.

This was beautiful. I made it for a birthday cake and it was a great change from a regular, heavy cake. I made it two days ahead, and it probably would have been better fresher, but it was still delicious. The orange flavor was just right.

Rating: 4
The cake was delicious. I had no troubles with it, perhaps because I was multitasking and therefore storing the completed filling and ganache in the fridge between steps. The only things I will do differently next time: 1) not dust it with the cocoa powder before flipping, since it kept the ganache from sticking, and 2) try rolling the cake in a towel when it is still slightly warm in hopes of keeping it from cracking when it is rolled with the filling inside.

My lunch group loved this recipe and requested that I share it. I found the directions clear and the steps easy to follow. Next time I might add more gelatin to the filling to give it more body. The cake was soft; I chilled it overnight before lifting it from the baking sheet to the serving tray. Leftovers held their shape and kept well.

I really enjoyed this variation on the traditional buche. Some of my guests didn't like the orange flavor. I think I prefer the coffee, but the orange was nice for a change.

I made this for our Christmas dinner yesterday and it was a huge success. The mixed reviews cause concern but I realized that it was mostly about technique. The cake was perfect in 16 minutes in my oven and the following day I made the filling and took the suggestion from a previous reviewer and melted the gelatin in my pyrex measuring cup that I dipped in a pan of simmering water and added that to the cool cream and it whipped up fine. The following day I spread it with the ganache and subbed 1/4 tsp. orange oil for the Gran Marnier due to family requests and it was perfect. Take some time and do it over a few days and it'll be perfect.

OK I wish I'd read the reviews before I made it. Yes, the filling is very "sensitive". I really liked the addition of the orange. The cake was very spongy, easy to roll and it generally was not as heavy as other recipes for buche de noel.

This is a great recipe, the orange is a nice addition. The cake was delicious and pretty. I garnished with little marzipan mushrooms and sprinkled powder sugar over top.

Okay, I have made this nearly 5 times and finally figured out that yes, the cream and gelatin mixture must be cool before whipping. The ganache as well. We LOVE this recipe, especially my children! They want it every Christmas, and this year I ran out of time so I made it for New Year's Day. I think it's an easy recipe, but not for a complete novice cook. Be sure not to overcook the cake or it will crack when you roll it. 15 minutes seems to work. And be sure to get premium chocolate and extra orange zest works as well. yum yum!

I have made this many times and it always gets rave reviews. Here's what I've learned: About the filling: I always buy enough ingredients to make it twice because it is very "sensitive". The warmed cream must be at room temperature or it will not whip. However, you cannot let it cool so long that it congeals. You have to monitor it very closely and move to the next step the moment it has cooled to room temp. The Ganache: It will whip - just put it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to start to thicken - but again, monitor closely. The cake: I wouldn't worry if the cake cracks slightly when rolling - it's nothing that the ganache won't cure. You can't multi-task when working with this recipe. Because I've made it so many times I decided to replace the orange flavor with something different - just for a change - though the orange is wonderful. For cherry/almond flavor - I made the following adjustments: I omitted the orange peel in the filling and used 1/4 tsp almond and 1/4 tsp vanilla in filling. I replaced the Grand Marnier with Kirsch (cherry liqueur). Finally, I sprinkled a handful (maybe 1/2 cup) of dried tart Montgomery cherries on top of the filling, after it had been spread on the cake but before rolling it. The cherry almond version also got rave reviews.

People, I am sorry but this is not a nice recipe at all. The roll crumbled, looks flat, the filling is blah, and can we spend a few moments discussing how painful it was to make the ganache? I'd go so far as to say that this buche de noel ruined my Christmas.

Rating: 4
I have made this buche de noel almost every year since the recipe came out since it is a great dessert that people ask for. I have made it on a lovely long ceramic plate and used pomegranate seeds and white pine to decorate along with the truffles and the powdered sugar. I highly recommend it and it really is easy if you are a decent cook.

Rating: 2
I've had better success with more traditional recipes. The filling was a pain to make. The first 2 attempts were failures: the whipped cream liquified when I added the gelatin mixture. On the third attempt, I refrigerated the gelatin mixture until it congealed. I used expensive chocolate for the ganache but the overall result wasn't that impressive. Next year, I'll go back to Nick Malgeri or Rose Berenbaum for inapiration.

Rating: 4
SO easy, very subtle and elegant. The instructions are unecessarily fiddly though, when the the cake was just out of the oven, I rolled it in a tea towel and let it cool entirely, then I unrolled it, filled it with the orange cream, rolled it back on up and topped with the ganache. Couldn't be easier.

Rating: 4
I was also surprised with how easy this was. I didn't look at the recipe too carefully before choosing it and was taken aback at the cake ingredients - every sponge cake i've made has had flour in it. In the end, though, everything was great, although the cake didn't roll as well as I would have liked - I think my pans were a bit small or something, so it was more like a cake tube with whipped cream inside. I took care to chill the gelatin mixture before adding it to the cream, and had no trouble with it. I also mixed the zest with the vanilla, to let the alcohol and zest mix a little. I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.

I had qualms about my first buche but ultimately found it ridiculously easy. It disappeared from a dessert buffet with nary a crumb left. Will make again so "I" can taste it! To everyone having trouble with the filling. I wasn't paying attention and did not mix the gelatin with warmed cream. Instead, I just added the dissolved gelatin to the whipped cream and went with it. No problems. Because I made the cake over two days, I also didn't feel like it was time-consuming.

Oh boy....this one gave me a little trouble. I made it for Christmas. The cake was beautiful, but the orange cream did not cooperate! It never set up and the gelatin turned into little glops instead of emulsifying! So, I added two packages of cream cheese and whipped it up, and it was good. Also, I used Valrhona chocolate for the cake and the ganache, very good. Make sure you follow the directions when it says do not overbeat the ganache. I did, and it hardened up! But, I added a little milk and it was okay. Not bad, but the taste was not worth the effort!

I made this for Christmas dinner this year. It is nice to get most of the work done the day before. The cake is easy - my jelly roll pan is insulated, so it cooked for 8 minutes longer than the max. But it turned out nice. The filling gave me problems - my first batch didn't whip AT ALL, so I followed the someone's advice and stuck everthing in the freezer for 15 minutes, and I stirred the gelatin/cream mix over ice water and tossed it in right when it started "jelly-ing" - it seemed to work, at any rate, it held it's shape just fine. The roll split when rolled, but the icing was great and covered up everything. The flavor of this buche is really fabulous, so I know I'll continue to make this.

My cake turned out absolutely wonderful and will be a yearly tradition from now on. Don't know what to say about others troubles with the filling, except that the key, as previous reviewers have said, is to keep everything cold. My gelatin was lukewarm at best when I added it to the whipped cream and worked fine.

I wish I had seen the review from Waynesboro because this was a disaster for me. The cake part came out fine, but the filling did not. The cream whipped fine until I added the gelatin mixture and then it flopped and would not re-whip. I tried adding the butter w/ the cream and that didn't help. My gelatin wasn't hot, but it probably wasn't cold, either. I may have to give it another try but not for a while since I am too annoyed right now. I needed this for a party we went to. Fortunately, I had picked up a chocolate mousse torte from Bittersweet Bakery in Chicago and THAT was a huge hit!!

This is a great cake and not too difficult. My only suggeation is that you make sure the gelatin mixture is not warm AT ALL when you add it to the whipping cream mixture or else it curdles immediately! I had to make more filling and the second time, I chilled bowl and beaters for the cream, then after my gelatin mixture had dissolved, I popped it in the frig for a few minutes before adding it to the cream. That way everything stayed smooth and whipped. I was very impressed with the results and the presentation. I made marzipan mushrooms also. They were fun and surprisingly easy!

To the Bethlehem cook... If you're having trouble getting the cream to whip there are a few things to try. First, chill everything (bowl, whisk beater, cream) in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before you prepare it. If that still doesn't help the cream whip into shape, you can try adding 1/4 cup of butter to 1/4 cup of the cream, melt them together and let them come back to room temperature. Add the butter and cream slowly as you whip the cream and the extra butterfat should help stabilize it.

Made this several times, to rave reviews. It is a very light cake, not too filling. I soak the cake with an extra ~1/4 cup of orange liqueur before adding the filling and rolling. It goes perfectly with the chocolate cake.

HELP!!! - I have tried twice to make the filling and both times it has flopped. The first time, I added the hot geletain to the wrong bowl of cream. The second time, I followed the directions corerectly and the cream would not whip. I tasted the cake and the cream together, it tasted marvelous, so I know that it will be a fabulous cake if I ever succeed. Please help me so that I can serve this wonderful cake at Christmas.

I've made this the last two year for Christmas, 1 Buche the first year, 2 the next and this year, my family has requested 3. Each one gets better in terms of taste and presentation as I master it. This is a classic recipe that is fun to make and even more fun to serve and enjoy.

This is a really special dessert. I made this several years ago and it was a tremendous success. I plan to make it this year...does anyone know if this can be frozen and/or how many days in advance this can be made? I need to make 2 (!) for a party and am just trying to figure out how far in advance I can do this.

I've made this cake lots - for over 50 people - doubled the recipe. I just use whipped cream for filling and top with chocolate sauce of unsweetened choc, sugar, vanilla and evaporated milk in that order. I've received raves for this Buche de Noel for years.

LOVED it! Last year I made the almond cream recipe also on this site, and this one was worlds better. I pretty much followed the recipe as it (except for adding a touch of shaved chocolate to the filling and a tiny bit of orange zest to the frosting). I will be using this as my standard buche do noel from now on. Delicate, light, easy easy (if you are a relatively experienced cook, I guess)

I also used the chocolate cloud recipe from the Cake Bible with the filling and frosting from this recipe and it was wonderful. Because I didn't have unflavored geletin in my pantry, I used an organge flavored packet on hand and the taste was just fine. I chilled the cake only for about an hour before frosting and the results were superb. A great presentation for a relatively easy preparation. I will definitely make again - and won't wait until next Christmas.

I have been making this cake for my family's Christmas Eve dinner for three years now, and I love it more each time. This dessert is very beautiful and easy, though time-consuming. The chocolate and orange together are really delicious. I too make marzipan mushrooms and dust with cocoa. Just love it!

Rating: 4
Very beautiful and delicious but A LOT of work. I actually used the Chocolate Cloud Cake Roll recipe from the Cake Bible cookbook but I used this filling and ganache. I had no trouble with anything per se but it did take the help of two other people to roll it up once the filling was spread. The ganache was delicious and perfect spreading consistency. Be sure to refrigerate this before frosting AND before serving to firm it up. I made meringue mushrooms dusted with cocoa (also from the Cake Bible - a fantastic book) which were actually quite easy and looked so real - several people kept asking if they were! I then decorated the serving tray with ivy. I was so darn proud of myself because it did take like 5 hours to make but it looked perfect and tasted even better! Well worth the effort!!

I've made this dish four times and it works each time - with modifications. For the filling, I actually follow the instructions for stabilized whipped cream in The Joy of Cooking. It's simpler and it works better (for me at least). Add gelatine to cold water in a heatproof cup and let it soften for five mintues. Then place the cup in a saucepean of simmering water until gelatine dissolves and liquid is clear. Allow to cool and then add it to your chilled cream along with other ingredients as it begins to thicken. Also, I like to add more orange zest then just a teaspoon - I find a tablespoon makes for a stronger, but still subtle orange flavour. And if you don't have Grand Marnier or another orange liquor on hand - don't buy it just for the recipe - I find any other liquor is just a tasty, such as Frangelico or Amaretto. Be careful while whipping the ganache, make sure it holds very soft peaks as it will harden as you spread it over the log. You don't want to end up with a crumbly, mess of chocolate. Meringue mushrooms and a bit of holly for colour add a festive touch. Don't be intimidated by the recipe - it's much easier than one would think, and the results are wonderful!

I've made this twice now. It is not hard, but is a lot of work. Two keys to success: bake longer than 15 minutes--took 20 in my oven. Many people mention having problem with filling. Let gelatin/cream mixture cool to room temperature. If this mixture is the least bit warm, the cream won't whip. While the gelatin cream mix is cooling, have remainder of cream, sugar, etc chilling in frig until ready to beat. It's very good, impressive; but I prefer more cake. More than half of the cake is filling.

This is a beautiful and easy cake to make. I've made it twice and have had luck with it both times. The only problem I have run into is that after I add the gelatin mixture to the cream, I can't get the cream to beat into stiff peaks. But this has had no effect on the outcome. To decorate, I made marziapan mushrooms, sprinkled them with cocoa, and I made an extra branch on top of the log, cut from the main log and secured it with toothpicks. I added fresh holly branches on the dessert platter and omitted the truffles. This recipe will now be a Christmas heirloom treat for us!

Made this back in Dec 98 & guest RAVED! Just made it again for a Thanksgiving Birthday, for one major chocolate lover. This masterpiece will steal any show. It is really easier than appears. I used the Scharffen Berger Chocolate (avail Williams-Sonoma)70% cocoa and Cadbury's 100% cocoa powder(got it in Ireland). Enjoy!

I originally was going to make David Rosengarten's Buche Noel, only to find out the posted recipe is missing the filling ingredients, so I came over here and found this variation. I made it for Christmas Day it got rave reviews and was finished to the last bite. The cake is very light, but the edges stick so beware, just cut around them). And the filling and frosting are wonderful. I've offloaded it into my permanent collection and plan to make it again soon (as a simple roll cake)!

Made it for Christmas and was such a hit that I made it again for New Year's lunch. Again a hit. However, my first try was a disaster. Apparently, I undercooked the cake and couldn't roll it well. Had to throw out everything and try again. I found the gelatine to be a bit annoying to work with, but after several tries it worked out perfectly. The end result is worth it. The cake is light and delicious. The orange flavour is superb. Will definitely make it again and again.

I made this cake for Christmas Day and served it to 11 guests. I added branches and everyone was impressed. Everyone said that it was delicious. I thought it was good. However, there was a small piece of the branch left that I ate today and I thought the cake was denser and much more flavorful. I thought on Christmas day that the cake was too light. I will make this again 2-3 days before serving to allow the flavors to blend together. That would work perfectly for me to have dessert prepared in advance with the rush of the Christmas holiday. I hope this helps.

I made the cake and fell after it came out of the oven. When I rolled it up, it cracked all over. I'm going to attempt to repair it, but I am very disappointed with the results, especially since I made it to take to a big Christmas party. I won't make the cake again, but the filling is delicious.

This recipe is wonderful. One of those ones that looks complicated to make, but really is easy. I made it for Christmas last year and everyone loved it so much that it was requested again for New Year's Day. I used artificial sprigs of miniature poinsettas as a simple and beautiful decoration on the top. It looked very elegant and tastes as good as it looks. Very impressive.
