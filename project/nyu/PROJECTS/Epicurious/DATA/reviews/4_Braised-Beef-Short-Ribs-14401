Very simple recipe and very quick. I only used about 3lbs of beef short ribs and therefore lessened the other ingredients a little (by about 1/3). I was in a hurry for a thicker sauce, so I made a roux and added it to the strained pan drippings for a delicious gravy.

Made this dish for company several days ago & they're still raving about it. Used a mix of boneless & bone-in short ribs & 1 cup of red wine along with 2 cups of beef broth. Also roasted at 250F for about 3 hours the day before, & reheated the day of dinner party. Served a mixed green salad with lime Asian style-dressing, garlic mashed potatoes & peas. Dessert was Dorie Greenspan's apple cake, caramel sauce & whipped cream.

This made the best sauce, with no adjustments or changes, except to add some small, quartered potatoes. I personally think that the amount of broth and the bacon fat were responsible for how good it all tasted. The short ribs weren't great, though the juices from the bone marrow probably contributed a lot to the sauce. Maybe I just don't like short ribs.I would make this again using a nice piece of beef for a pot roast.

After reading all the reviews, I used EVOO instead of bacon fat, added wine for 1/3 of my braising liquid, and cooked for at least THREE hours at 300 degrees. I didnt find EVOO all that ideal for browning. Also, I read somewhere that flouring/dredging hinders the flavor and one of the diners did find the taste of the meat a bit "bland". The texture was tender tho. There is a Korean version of this style of dish called Kalbi Chim/ Galbi Chim. Next time, I will go back to doing short ribs Korean-style as it is much more flavorful and much easier to do than this recipe.

As with others, mixed 1/2 red wine and 1/2 broth. That was a great suggestion. I also modified the cooking time and temp. Cooked for 2 hours at 300 and another 2 hours at 210. The meat fell off the bones and was a tender as could be. Only thing to note (or at least for me) was that I needed much more than 1/4 bacon fat. Amazing recipe!

Awesome awesome awesome. I looked at the recipe and went extra on the bacon and rosemary, just a little. The short ribs are to die for, my wife loves it when I cook these.

Subbed one cup of broth for a cup of red wine which added some nice depth to the flavor. Not quite as tender as I would have liked it though, it may be better at a lower temp for longer.

Delicious and so easy! I don't know that I would bother with the bacon fat again, tho. I had to add more oil to the pot to finish the browning, so maybe I'll just use olive oil next time. But otherwise the dish came out great. The gravy this thing makes is wonderful!

I am a big fan of pot roast and have never cooked short ribs before, but I believe this is my new pot roast as it was superb!! Changes I made that worked very well: Cooked ribs with 1 C red wine and 2 C stock. Only used 2 chopped carrots, 1 coarse chopped onion and 4 large cloves of garlic with ribs in crock pot on low for 5 hours. Crock pot is so easy. Then, big chunk chopped remaining carrots, onions and 5 or 6 meduim russet potatoes and tosssed them with canola oil and a steak rub in a roasting pan for 40 minutes at 425, tossing 2-3 times to even up the browning. Took beef out of crock and pureed the juices and bits in blender and poured back in crock and whisked in one small can tomato paste to thicken and flavor bomb the whole thing. Put ribs back in with gravy and HOLY CRAP was this good. Served it all in a big bowl with veggies and covered it all with the gravy. Buttered up some crusty bread, and poured a fine glass of red vino. LIVIN LARGE BABY!!

This is one of my favorite Epicurious recipes. I substituted a cup of good red wine for one of the cups of beef broth. Good idea to stick the rendered vegetables in the food processor and add some of them back to the sauce to thicken and flavor it. The dish was delicious with roasted potatoes, turnips, and brussels sprouts. Next time I'll make a Caesar salad to add crispness and color. Serve with a good, robust red wine. Pefect for a company meal during the cool or cold months. This recipe is a keeper!

Texture of the meat is very, very nice. I served it over mashed sweet potatoes. And I steamed some spinach and threw in the bacon. Served it all in one bowl. My husband called it succulent and said it was one of his all-time faves.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit with my hubby..the ribs were so tender they fell off the bone completely. I substituted EVOO for the bacon. Great recipe..will make it again!

Short on ingredients but TALL on flavor. I keep the bacon and add it to the pot when cooking, I also use 1 can beef broth and use a good beer for the remainder of the 3 cups. Finally, when the ribs are done, I take them out of the pot and use an immersion blender to make a gravy to put over potatoes or wide noodles. This is a MUST MAKE. I also make the dish in a pressure cooker. Cook on high for about an hour.

I, too, used EVOO in place of bacon fat, braised the short ribs for three hours at 300 degrees, and added 1/3C tomato paste to the reserved cooking liquid. I added chopped celery to the veg mix for extra flavor. Mashed potatoes would have been a great side dish. Great hearty fare perfect for cooler weather.

Short ribs are my favorite--and these are great and easy. Be sure to take other cooks advice listed below and strain the solids then add 1/3 can of tomato paste to reduce at the end---it really makes the sauce rich and deep.

I made this and will make it again. I would have given it four forks, but I changed the recipe somewhat. I did not used the rendered bacon fat...I dusted the ribs with flour, S&P and browned them in a little EVOO. I too used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 red wine. I baked them in the oven at 300 for 3 hours at which point I took them out and set the ribs on a platter. I then added approximately 1/3 C of tomato paste and simmered the whole thing down to a silky sauce. I added the ribs back to the sauce to reheat and served with garlic mashed potatoes. I would most certainly serve it to company--not only because it is delicious, but it can be made ahead and reheated without any compromise.

Super simple & wonderful! A couple of changes I make - I use duck fat instead of bacon fat, I peel the onion, I add at least a cup of red wine & I don't sieve the cooking liquid (the veggies are tasty!). The leftovers make the BEST hash!

Very good. Made just as directed, except for substituting some of the beef broth with red wine as suggested earlier. Only thing I will do different next time is cook longer -- 2 hours made it tender, but not that silky smooth tenderness we love. Will probably need to add more liquid when cooking longer. But guests were licking plates.

I doubled the recipe and ended up cooking half in oven as directed and half in slow cooker on high setting for 4-6 hours. In future I will use slow cooker as these turned out much more tender. Great for a party.

I have to double the recipe so there are leftovers! My guys LOVE this dish. Great comfort food, serve with garlic mashed potatoes or polenta. Fabulous!

I love this recipe - but I don't use it for short ribs anymore. I use this recipe for making brisket. Just braise in the oven for about 3 hours. I let cool and pour the liquid through a food mill so the pulp from the veggies thicken the gravy. Refrigerate overnight. Remove the solid fat from the gravy, slice the brisket against the grain and heat in the oven in the gravy. There's been many brisket recipes in my family over the years and this is by far everyone's favorite. Delicious!

With this recipie, I made the tenderest and juciest short ribs ever. I was so happy with them that I made anyone who came over, taste them just to delight in their surprise over how delicious they were. I made a few slight modifications: used 50% beef broth and 50% cabernet wine, and since I didn't have a kettle to cook them in, I used glass corningware caserolle dishes covered with foil. Seems to have worked wonderfully. Will certainly make this again...when friends come for dinner!

The short ribs I found were almost all fat and bone! Are they supposed to be that way? The only other ribs they had were boneless country blade ribs, so I ended up getting those instead. Can anyone tell me if these are the same as the boneless short ribs? Will come back and review this recipe after I've tried them.

Wonderful dish -- the ribs came out very tender and full of flavor. Made a few adjustments, though. Mixed substantial amounts of salt, white pepper, and sweet paprika with dredging flour, and (following an earlier reviewer's advice) substituted port for about a quarter of the liquid. Upon checking the ribs at about 90 minutes, found that an additional cup of liquid was needed. Shredded the leftover rib meat and cooked it up with the leftover roast potatoes for a truly fine hash the next morning -- topped with poached eggs, it was almost better than dinner the night before.

Great recipe! I substituted 1 1/2 cups of white wine for the broth. With a side of brown rice my wife loved it! Enjoy.

Made this several times. Very tender and tasty. Used 1/2 red wine 1/2 beef broth. When I cooked it longer (3 1/2 hours), the liquid mostly dried up, so I will stick to 2 hours. The carrots and onions are quite good, too.

this was excellent. I took others tips and added a little red wine. This is definitely a keeper.

I thought that this was perfectly average. If you want to have nicely braised ribs, this recipe will do it, but I don't think that there is anything earth shattering for flavour enhancement by using this particular recipe.

This was a great recipe, I did make some changes though. I doubled the garlic because I am under the belief that more garlic is always better. I also used half dry red wine and half beef broth for the final broth. My family did enjoy the ribs but next time I will try with boneless. These were a great hit at my dinner table. Will be making these again.

This was very easy and great tasting. The meat was extremely tender. I think I will add some port or red wine as recommended by another reviewer to the broth next time though for some more richness. Great over mashed potatoes.

I am NOT a beef rib fan, but these were excellent. Would recommend them highly - so delicious. I made two modifications which I feel made them extra special - when adding the beef broth, also add 1/2 cup of port wine. Also, I cooked them 3-1/2 hours in the oven instead of 2 hours - much more tender - the meat just fell off the bone. I am now a beef rib fan!

I used boneless short ribs and substituted beer for part of the beef broth (12 oz. can) It was very tender and tasty.

This was very easy to make and my husband loved it! It was a little on the greasy side for me, but next time I will degrease more than I did this time.
