I went at this dish thinking I could get the Scalloped Oysters my Momma wanted, plus the Creamed Spinach my husband required in one dish at Christmas. So, I made the filling/spinach mixture exactly as written (a day ahead!), but rather than serve on the individual shells, I soaked the oysters in a cup of cream overnight in a casserole dish. Then I loosely covered the oysters with the filling/spinach mixture. Topped the lot with cooked, crumbled bacon and baked at 350* for about a half hour. Success! In addition to a beautiful dish, it was delicious too!

Okay, I know we all hate excessive edit's however, I took the oysters and put them in a casserole dish on a bed of bed crumbs, covered them with cream and let them sit for an hour or two. Then used the 'Rockefeller' spinach as a crust and it was amazing. At 400* for twenty minutes......it was delicious and similar to the scalloped variety from my Southern past. Wonderful!

My husband manages a 4 Diamond restaurant on Hilton Head Island,SC,and his amazing Chef tells me he won't come to my Christmas party unless I make this dish. Quite a compliment from a man who is an acclaimed chef! LOVE THIS.

I've made this recipe many times now and it is a little bit of heaven. This has to be some of the most luxurious food there is. The only thing I've changed over time is to reduce the amount of butter. Also, don't skimp on the bacon. Use the finest you can find.

About as true to the original classic as it gets ; with the exception of using chervil and\or tarragon instead of boston and spinach. Very nice though.

This was delicious. The best we have ever had.

This recipe has become a traditional part of our Christmas pre-dinner nibbles, and is, after experimentation and trying the dish at various other places, the ne plus ultra of oysters rockefeller. My tip: make the stuffing the day before--with all the butter, it chills and makes putting it into the oysters a snap. i also use virginia smaked bacon, and it gives the filling a wonderful flavor.

Although this doesn't fall into the quick and easy category, it is splendid to serve and eat! a very impressive first course.

Althought this isn't the original "oysters rockefeller" recipe, every time I have served this my guests adore it. It is one of the most elegant and delicious hot hors' doevres I make when I have company. Go easy on the bacon. Put the oysters in the hot oven for a bit and they pop open and then scoop them out.
