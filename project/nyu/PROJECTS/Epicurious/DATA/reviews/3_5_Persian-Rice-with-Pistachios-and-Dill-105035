I followed the recipe exactly and it absolutely did not work for me. The rice was crunchy and raw. I added peas, sea salt and nature's seasoning and the flavor was lovely, but the texture was borderline inedible. I finally added water and microwaved it for 10 minutes to even get it soft enough to eat at all. I am a very experienced cook- not sure what went wrong here!

Fantastic! I made this recipe with ghee instead of regular butter, and reduced the amounts of pistachio & dill for a subtler flavor. It was amazing with pan-fried Copper River salmon & tossed salad w/cucumber, yellow tomato, red onion and Sauv. Blanc vinaigrette. Will make again and again!

This is not Persian dish. Substitute Pistachio with Fava beans then its Persian dish and very delicious

This did not work. Followed recipe and the rice was not cooked at all (super crunchy!). Not much flavour at all. I am trying to see if I did anything wrong but I don't think so....

this recipe was wonderful as a side for a Persian dinner: the flavors are great and the nuts add an interesting crunch. It satisfied my desire for a "new food" in that the combination of flavors is very different than anything else I've eaten. for my purposes, the serving size as a side dish was off: I had lots of leftovers with 15 people for dinner. And, I used about 4 TB not 6 of butter...cooked on an electric stove did not get the crust but it was delicious and different anyway.

This is very similar to a traditional Persian dish my mother used to make. However, my mother uses large green peas instead of pistachios. I modify this recipe by using a bag of frozen peas, dried dill, and garlic. I let it cook for about 45 minutes under low heat. This ensures that the tahdig (the crust) gets nice and thick.

Basmati rice is always delicious. This recipe is a take on the Persian rice "Bawqualla Polo," and although good, the traditional recipe is better. Next time, try using at least 1 cup of chopped fresh dill, then layeing with precooked lima beans and fresh garlic cloves. While layering, sprinkle each layer lightly with cinnamon and a bit of turmeric. The rice is also cooked at least 45 minutes to one hour. The crust at the bottom becomes thicker and really delicious.

Pleasant, but not worth the trouble of making it again.

Love this recipe - though I think making a half recipe would probably easily serve 6-8 as a side dish - on the other hand, leftovers are good with almost any kind of meat, poultry or fish. (Yes, you can reheat it in the mircrowave - but first sprinkle with a little bit of water and top with a (clean) damp cloth. Basmati rice really makes the dish and the pistachios are perfect (but a literal pain to shell.) I sprinkle with tumeric after cooking to add a nice golden color. Also when I can only find fresh dill in those expensive tiny plastic containers - sometimes use some dried dill to supplement (use only very fresh dried dill!) I usually serve this dish with (aside from meat/protein) a side dish of roasted, grilled or steamed vegetables, (I like a combo of zucchini and summer yellow squash, onions, garlic and tomatoes)tossing these vegetables and any leftover meat with the leftover rice makes a great supper casserole.

I served this Persian Rice with Chicken Marbella (Silver Palate cookbook) for a dinner party for 10. The rice, even without the pistachios and dill, was a snap to make and was delicious! It was much faster than soaking the rice overnight, which is how my Persian friend prepares her more traditional version. Great dish for a large crowd when you want to be with your guests, rather than tending the food!

Unfortunately I failed to make the rice crust, but I only cooked the rice for 20 minutes so that was probably the reason why. Still, it was very tasty. I also substituted cashew nuts for the pistachios.

This recipe is truly delicious and it works out perfectly! I have to admit that the first time I made it we found it too buttery. I have since prepared it with only 1T butter and 1T vegetable oil and it still came out great-the crunchy bottom later that is the best part still works.

I originally found this recipe in the cookbook, The Best American Recipes of 2002-2003, and I agree with their selection - it is truly one of the best rice recipes that I have ever made, and I've been cooking for more than 40 years!

Very easy to make and tastes just like the rice in Persian restaurants! My guests LOVED it...there was no conversation going on, just the sound of savoring chews. Perfect w/lamb or chicken kebabs and grilled tomotoes.

very surprised by how tasty this dish was! i had fresh homehad yogurt which accompanied the rise to give a cool texture alongside the dill.

A surprisingly wonderful dish. I wasn't too sure about the dill and pistachio combination, but it really works well together. Served this at a dinner party and it was a big hit. I read all of the other reviewers' suggestions but decided to follow the recipe to the letter and it was perfect as is.

I think there is a mistake in this recipe - which Iris Brest caught as well. After washing (and using proper basmati rice) you will need to parboil the rice 10 minutes. With half butter and half olive oil, I prefer 12-15 minutes and then using the lowest flame for up to an hour. Good with pine nuts instead pistachios too. (and no shelling!)

Very good rice dish. It is an interesting way to prepare rice (the parboiling and then cooking without liquid) - but turned out just wonderful. Dill and pistachios were nice addition.

I am writing from Iran.Though I hardly go to kitchen for cooking I am sure that our "tah-dig" is a bit different.There are two ways of cooking the rice in Iran(kateh and chelokesh-ie,halfdone and welldone).We usually make tah-dig for chelokesh rice.In this case ou have to let the rice boil in the hot water till you see the rice is coming up with the bubbles.Let it boil for extra 5-10 minutes,then take it and pour it in a sieve.Then heat a suitable container,add 30gr. of butter to melt.At last you loosely add rice and let it be baked gradually with low flames.The more you let,the more your tah-dig turn browns.In Iran we also have tah-dig with lettus leaves or with potatos ,both delicious.

This is a very aromatic, flavorful recipe. I don't recommend using brown rice (I tried that the first time and had to add water). The tah dig is good, but I actually like the upper portion of the rice best.

I was intrigued and fascinated by the recipe and the process. It is really easy to make and a divine recipe. I served it with red snapper and muscadet wine. Also really good asparagus. The crispness of the tah-dig is magic. We have had a similar textured rice in Caraway Rice Cakes but this is a far better way to get the same effect and its really a very simple process for a very sophisticated and cultured recipe with classic ingredients.. pistachios.. and basmathi rice. Amazing. Another way to make rice. And for a really lovely experience.. smell the tea towel you use to cover the pot as soon as you open it after cooking. Heaven.

Has anyone actually made this recipe? I'd like to, but the idea of cooking the rice in water for only 5 minutes seems so improbable that I'm reluctant to do it for company first, and it's a lot of rice to make for just us.
