We are completely astonished that we were able to accomplish such a delicious doughnut! We don't ever deep fry anything so we were "afraid" of the bubbling oil; but we used a candy thermometer to make sure the oil was hot enough, and it worked! We wondered about a hole in the doughnut. So we poked a hole with a finger once the flat pieces were cookie-cut. We used only 2 quarts of oil in a 3.5 qt saucepan, and boiled 5 at a time (not 10). They rose almost instantly, you could observe the bottoms browning, so you knew when to gently flip them with the tip of a long handled slotted spoon and, voila! Doughnuts. Our cookie cutter made about 32 (vs 36) and they were a hit dredged in cinnamon sugar. We will make these again and again! It was a fast and easy and impressive dessert!

THe doughnuts didn't taste as strongly of apple cider as I'd hoped. I read the same comment on some earlier reviews, so I started with a larger quantity of cider and boiled it down to 1/3 cup, hoping that would kick up the apple flavor, but it didn't really. The doughnuts did have a nice crusty shell, which was tasty.

Bleh. I really thought that these would have more APPLE CIDER flavor considering they are "Cider" doughnuts. They didn't. In fact, I didn't taste anything but oil. :(

We really thought these were horrible. Followed the instructions exactly. Couldn't taste anything other than the frying oil. The dough simply absorbed tons of the frying oil as they cooked. We even tried increasing the temp on the oil to get them really crisp as soon as they hit the oil so as to reduce absorption but that didn't work. I'll stick with my good old fashioned buttermilk cake doughnut recipe.

Very easy and worked perfectly. Also, the doughnuts were delicious. Maybe my cookie cutter was too small, because I got 60 doughnuts out of this recipe. But they were delicious, and everyone loved them.

Super easy and the perfect thing for a crowd on a lazy Friday after Thanksgiving.

Made these with my preschooler and it was lots of fun. We used animal shape cookie cutters, which made cute puffy shaped donuts! We don't eat a lot of fried foods, so my only complaint is that these do soak up the oil and my stomach isn't used to that! But they were yummy dipped in coffee and my daughter liked them with milk! I have a gas stove, so keeping the temp constant wasn't too hard and I didn't have trouble cooking them evenly.

These turned out pretty good & were fun to make, but the oil temperature was pretty tricky - they seemed to go from underdone to too done very quickly.
