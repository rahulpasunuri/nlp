I used my ordinary pie crust so I doubled the spice and added just a touch of nutmeg - the result was delicious. I also served it with vanilla ice cream. If I used a spicy or flavored crust, or omitted the ice cream, I'd cut back on the spice, but I wanted the contrast in flavors which worked very well. The peach flavor really shone through. I thought the filling stood up well and my guests raved about the whole thing. This is a keeper for me. I like the idea of adding apples for the filling also.

I have made this pie almost yearly and realized I have never rated it. It's simply divine. The spices complement the fresh peach flavor perfectly.I make it with the orange lattice crust also found on this site.

I used this recipe to make my very first pie, following the video instructions on this site(thanks, Epicurious!) It turned out great. All I added to the filling was a tiny bit of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon and ginger. After reading the reviews on the crust problem, I followed other's advice and used the crust recipe from "Apple Pie with Orange Lattice Crust." This combination worked very well. After rave reviews from friends and co-workers, I definitely plan to make this again.

I used the crust from the sour cherry pie recipe from June 2008 but used this filling. The filling is amazing. It was simple but taste delicious. It is perfect for an end of summer dessert.

Good filling, awful crust...very difficult to work. Next time, I'll use a traditional pie crust.

I was really dissappointed in this recipe. The flavor combinations sounded great and the reviews were favorable - what a letdown! the crust was dry, the filling did not hold up and the taste was way too bland. If I wanted to try again, I'd bake it for no more than an hour, add some flour along with the cornstarch, and definitely up the sugar and spices in the filling. I think the top crust could also use a coating of heavy cream sprinkled with granulated sugar before baking.

I have made peach pies for years and decided to try something new. this was the best peach pie I have ever made. the crust you could change if you want to, but this was a nice change. The filling was perfect. No slipping and sliding all over once the pie is cut, delicious in every way.

This was a great recipe! I used my own recipe for the crust and just added the cinnamon and ginger. I also added sliced apples to make a Spiced Peach and Apple Pie. Mmm...Delicious! Can't get enough of it!

This was quite good! Our guests raved. The peach slices in the photo are clearly smaller than the recipe calls for and I was nervous about how large the recipe said to make them, but I think it worked out well. I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make it again.

I loved this! I used all butter (no shortening) for the crust and it was really easy to work with, was appropriately light, and tasted good. The filling was yummy and not too sweet. It's probably awesome if you can use peaches straight from a tree in your own yard. Served with vanilla ice cream and sat back to bask in the glory of the cheer from everyone at the table.

This recipe was rather awful. I made it for father's day, and one of my uncles was the only person who liked it. I thought that the crust was over-spiced, and I can see why a lot of people didn't like working with it. The only good thing that I can say is that it's true that the pie is not too sweet. I don't plan on making this again.

The filling was interesting and good, I always go heavy on cinnamon. I liked the crust, but did not chill it as directed until it was rolled out. Hao no trouble with it.

I just made this for a party and got rave reviews. I might have cut back slightly on the butter (down 1-2 TBSPs to 8-9) and I added some crystallized ginger (chopped up fine) to some of the dough and some of the filling. It was really good! :)

Wonderful. I got some inspiration from another Epicurious recipe and used nutmeg, cardamom and cinnamon for the spice combination. And my usual pie crust recipe without shortening.

I made this pie for our 4th of July BBQ using my own homemade pie crust without spice. Also cut the ginger in half. It was tasty, and very pretty. Delicious fresh taste of peaches, not too sweet. My guests liked it, but then again, nobody here is particularly experienced with peach pie; in Maine we generally stick to blueberry and apple. It was a refreshing change.

I tried this recipe last night, except I used the flaky pie crust recipe. The only change I made to the filling recipe was I did adjust the ginger 1/4 teaspoon. Also, I used a 1 1/4 inch depth pan and it wasn't deep enough for all the peaches. So I made the leftover peaches into a cobbler. My boyfriend and I thought the pie was delicious and it was even better in the morning. We thought the sweetness was perfect, not overly sweet like store bought.

The worst pie crust I ever made. The dough formed into a ball the way it was suppose to. I had the hardest time rolling the dough that it didn't fall apart when attempting to put into pie plate. When the the pie was finished baking the crust was very dry and fell apart with no taste. The filling was ok but the flavor of the peaches remind me of an apple pie. What a waste of my peaches I just picked. Stick to my traditional peach pie with my regular pie crust recipe

Simply delicious! I found the spices to be just perfect, as well as the sweetness which largely depends on the sweetness of the peaches. Though the pastry dough was brittle and a bit of a challenge to to manipulate, it was absolutely scrumptious and turned out very well and nicely golden just like in the picture. I did not have a 9" deep dish so used an 11" tart pan (minimal drippings but do use al foil underneath).

Not bad with vanilla ice cream, but not sweet enough as a stand alone pie. The crust was different, but all the spices made it a little more like a pumpkin pie.

This filling is delicious! Used the first crop of peaches from my peach tree. Peeling the peaches is a bit of a hassle -- but, well worth it. Now for my pie crust? I need a little practice.

A very delicious pie. I didn't have enough peaches so I added 2 pears and 2 apples to make up for the required fruit. I also used my own pie crust (no fail) recipie. The spices in the filling added that extra zip! I found I only had to bake it for 1 hour. Definitely a keeper.

This is absolutely the best peach pie I have ever had! My family loves it. It is a hit wherever I take it. I always get requests for it.

Excellent. Very nice with a spicy crust. Good change, and nice touch. Added an egg wash to the crust and sprinkled about 1 tbsp of white sugar on top of that. This is a definite remake, although I would also try the crust without the spice for a change next time too. I suggest that you have to try this!

What??? how could everyone be bashing this pie, I have not met one person who tasted it and didn't like it, I've been getting requests for it since the first one I made! I would agree that it's a little fatty, the texture is amazingly flaky. And I only used cinnamon and skipped the other spices.

I agree with the other reviews - skip the crust given with this recipe and use your favorite. It was a disaster to get out of the pie dish. I simply called it cobbler and threw a scoop of ice cream on top and my guests were none-the-wiser. The filling was really good - The addition of ginger was a very nice touch.

The filling is excellent but the proportions for the crust are all off. Too much fat to flour ration. Use the following for a tender and flavorful crust. 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup shortening 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) 1 tsp salt, 2 TBSP sugar, 1 tsp vinegar, 4-6 TBSP ice water. This makes extra crust but is good for patching.

The ginger adds a great twist to the pie. I simplify the recipe by using Pilsbury ready made crusts that I put in my own dish. I am not fond of making pie crust nor do I usually have the time. I dress up the crust by doing a lattice top and brushing with egg yolks for the shine. I always get compliments on the crust and the pie looks as good as it taste.

I thought the crust called for way too much shortening and butter, but I decided to trust it and try it out. Big mistake. It was greasy and heavy. The filling was nice though.

Excellent! I used another crust receipe and it came out beautifully. My family loved it - I should have made two because there wasn't enough. Draining most of the peach juice is a must.

Delicious! I used my own crust, and drained some of the juice from the peaches before baking. The spices are a great addition, and the pie did not last long in the house...Yum!

as part of generation X, i have an aversion to vegetable shortening so i just used margarine in its place. i didn't buy enough peaches so i ended up supplementing with fresh, sliced strawberries. the pie was wonderful. i will probably use this recipe for other fruit pies.

The ginger is definitely a plus in this recipe. Really gives it some ZIP! Very delicious.

The addition of the ginger and cinnamon made this crust special. Next time I am going to use the same crust for my fresh apple pie in the fall.

Every year for my husband birthday I bake him a peach pie, at his request. This one had to be the best that I have made so far. I like the added touch of the spices.

My husband loved this recipe because it is not too sweet. I used my own crust recipe, put the peaches in the shell with a slotted spoon, then used the leftover peaches and juice in a smoothie for breakfast the next morning. This method ensured that the pie fruit was perfectly cooked and not soupy at all.

This pie turned out very well. I followed the filling instructions exactly, but I wound up using the crust for the blueberry lattice pie instead from the June 2000 issue instead. I jsut sprinkled some cinnamon and ginger over the crust before putting it in the oven, and brushed it a little with cream after it was in for about 30 mins. All was excellent. The pie came out perfectly, I never even had to cover the crust with foil, it browned just right. I made sure to keep it in the bottom rack on my oven. The pie was delicious, not runny at all, and a breeze to slice. One of the best pies I've ever made! My friends couldn't get over how nice it was!
