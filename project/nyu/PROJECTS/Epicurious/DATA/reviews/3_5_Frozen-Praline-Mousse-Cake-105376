This got nice comments. It's not easy to make, but can be totally made ahead. Attractive presentation. It's not my favorite, but I would make it again if I were serving many, many people and needed a wide range of desserts that could be made ahead of time.

I JUST SPENT AN HOUR LOOKING FOR THIS RECIPE BECAUSE I MADE IT LAST YEAR FOR A PARTY AND COULD'NT FIND IT IN MY RECIPE BOX. IT WAS A HIT. PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

All of the individual components in this dish were great by themselves so I was really disappointed that the final product was less than phenomenal in my opinion. The mousse layer tasted like coffee ice cream (and melted just like it as well making a mess of my hostess's table) and the meringue base was almost impossible to cut through. Perhaps I did not grind the almonds enough for the base layer. As for presentation, I sprinkled a little extra praline powder on top in the center with a handful of finely chopped almonds around the perimeter and it looked great. But not something I would make again.

this recipe is AMAZING!!!!! definitely one of the best things i've EVER made! sometimes when I'm lazy, I just substitute the almond meringue crust with cookie crumbs or a cake bottom...

This was an amazing cake! The presentation needs a bit of work, but the taste is incredible. Very easy to make and everyone kept raving about it for weeks after the party I made it for.

This dessert was an instant success at a recent family gathering. Everyone was asking for the receipe. The combination of espresso and almonds was heavenly. I did omit the irish liquer (since I'm a non-alcohol drinker) and thankfully the taste wasn't altered. I also skipped the whipping cream at the end so I could cut back a bit on the calories. It's definitely recommended to make this dish way ahead of time if you have a party since it's time consuming. Yet, it's worth it.

Excellent dessert.Mes invités ont trouvé le dessert fabuleux. J'ai garni le dessus du gâteau avec des amandes grillées et je l'ai servi avec une sauce au caramel chaude
