I thought this had a burst of flavour. My children loved it. I will add a few more sausage next time. Left with a lot of sauerkraut sauce.

This has been my New Year's Day recipe for at least ten years. I rarely tweak it except to reduce the fat by using chicken sausages instead of brats. And I always serve it with horseradish. I'd agree that the flavor of the kraut is bland. I was blaming it on the kraut, not the soaking, so I'll try the half soaked- half unsoaked method this afternoon and I'll throw in some cranberries as one reviewer suggested.Happy New Year, everyone!

I didn't rate this recipe because I didn't use the sauerkraut (member of family cannot eat). Instead I sauteed red bell pepper. I also added garlic, dried "cranraisins" and bay leaf. Also added apples, pears just before the end and new potatoes midway. A very versatile basic recipe that can support lots of variations.

I have made this recipe numerous times over the years and everyone loves it! I use a little less liquid in the sauerkraut and grate a potato into it. I find that it is rather watery otherwise. I replace the pork chops with either smoked pork chops or slices of smoked butt (my kids love that) or just leave the pork out and just use sausages. Don't soak the sauerkraut-it takes out all the flavor. I just rinse it lightly in a colander. Adding a teaspoon of caraway seeds adds a nice flavor.

Yum! I just made (a version of) this for a little dinner party, and it was a hit. Drained and soaked the sauerkraut for about 20 minutes, and modified the fruit by throwing in a handful of dried cranberries and spiced apples. I omitted the bacon and used only sausage- bockwurst (?), brats and a big kielbasa. Also added in some red potatoes for good starchy measure. It's a keeper, and great for get-togethers when you need lots of good, hearty food.

Taste your sauerkraut before soaking, as this step can be omitted if it's not too salty. If your porkchops are too lean, you may just want to use a variety of sausages. As for the bacon, I used 3 strips of the thick- cut, and cut them into 1/2" strips instead of chopping. Made the bacon recognizable when eating, and added another layer of texture. A big hit with the men.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I made only minor changes: used prune juice instead of the wine, added sliced garlic to onions and carrots, and cooked it in a crockpot. It turned out great.

Very interesting receipe. Using this method, the meat came out very tender and flavorful. However, my husband found that: 1) the prunes overpowered the dish 2) the sauerkraut did not have a nice sour taste. So, I would definitely make this dish again, but I would 1) leave off the prunes 2) soak only 1/2 the kraut so the other half retains a nice tart taste. I did find the soaked kraut easy to digest without unpleasant after effects, but I agree with my husband that soaking really affected the kraut taste.

We loved this but thought we should have made our own sauerkraut. The saukerkraut didn't turn out tangy enough. Just a little too sweet in that regard but overall a great dish. We'll definitely make again.

To the cook from Atlanta - it's not you, it's your pork. Supermarket pork has been slowly getting leaner and leaner. Pork you buy today has 30% less fat than pork you would have bought just twenty years ago. That means that a naturally lean cut like a loin chop is too darned lean to taste good. If you're stuck with supermarket pork, make sure you don't overcook. Also, buy thick chops if you can; that makes it easier to avoid overcooking. But you would be better off finding a very good butcher or local farm that can supply you with pork chops that are fattier, and therefore more flavorful and tender. Good luck.

Just wanted to address the pork chop question. They either have to be JUST cooked enough (using a meat thermometer), or cook at low heat for a long time (1-2 hours). I suggest browning and then leaving them in the covered pot to simmer for the whole time.

Will somebody please tell me how to cook pork chops that aren't tough? They were the only drawback to this recipe. Everything else was delicious, better than any pork and sauerkraut combo I've ever made. This will become my traditional New Year's Day dish.

Must be a sauerkraut lover to enjoy this dish. I found it average, better served the next day. My husband ate the meats, but didn't take to the sauerkraut; my son ate it but said he would have preferred it prepared another way, without sauerkraut, also.

This is great. Too much food, though ... Next time we'll forget the pork chops and just use sausages. It's an especially flavorful way to cook them.

This was one srceaming dish. Excellent, and not that tough to make. I live in the middle of nowhere, so I had to travel for the apricots, but I have made it a couple times and have had rave reviews...even from the sauerkraut haters. The soaking makes it palatable for anyone. Hearty and delicious.

I changed the liquids to apple juice and simmered everything on top of the stove and it was incredibly tasty. My whole family loved this and asked me to make it again....soon.....I will!

The prunes in this dish are what make it amazing. I added some thickly sliced garlic cloves, bay leaves and freshly ground black pepper to the sauerkraut, because soaking it takes away some flavor. Unlike anything i have ever had. So good.

This is a great and simple dish. The family loved it. We used half a tblsp. dried dill insted.

Could not believe how the flavors all combined. Served it at a dinner party and people raved. We added a little more liquid than it called for and it didn't change the flavor at all.

Delicious! I used the smoked pork chops, which eliminates a step and about 15 minutes of cooking time too. They give it a wonderful flavour.

I used a mixture of sausages from a German deli and this dish turned out fantastic!! I was surprised because I was skeptical about the dried fruit. It may be a bit thin in consistency, but I let it cook a little longer so the juices evaporated. A dish I will make again, and again.
