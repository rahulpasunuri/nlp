I made this recipe as written, to serve mixed with massaged kale for a hearty raw dinner. We thought the flavors in the slaw were delicious, but ended up adding in extra olives for some tang. Recommended, especially for a hot summer day!

Made this recipe as directed and it was absolutely horrible. My wife wouldn't even eat it after the first bite. I had high hopes due to the other reviews. Maybe it was something I did but it's kind of hard to mess up on a salad. The flavors just seemed off and was a bit bitter.

When I read this recipe I was VERY skeptical, but the reviews tempted me to give it a try. Boy is this good! -- a wonderful, light and refreshing winter take on "cole slaw". The olives (which sounded weird to me) absolutely make the dressing, and the sun-dried tomatoes give a wonderful tang. I am definitely putting this recipe in the "keeper" file!

Excellent! I made this with several other items from the menu and I think this was really a star! Such a great combo of sweet, salty, and tart. Highly recommend giving it a try.

Fast, easy, and tasty. I like the new to me spin on standard vegetables.

Easy & good. Even my fennel averse partner liked this salad. A strong testament indeed. Try for very thin fennel matchstick to keep the salad delicate.

This was such a refreshing surprise. In the middle of this extremely long winter it was just what I craved. I used 1 fennel bulb and 3 carrots but made the entire dressing as suggested. Next time, and there will definately be a next time, I will reduce the dressing amount as well - I just didn't think the entire amount was necessary.

I am absolutely enamored of this recipe. It is so unusual and delicious. And the sundried tomatoes are a must - do not even consider omitting them. I use really good pimento stuffed spanish olives that I mail order from La Tienda in the dressing. I am making this salad every week - I crave it.

Using a food processor, this is really quick and easy. Used 1 fennel bulb and 3 carrots with whole dressing amount. Perfect. Did not add sun dried tomatoes as I didn't think they fit. Relaly yummy.

I used half the fennel and carrot and the same amount of dressing and it seemed just fine. Fennel is such a wonderful vegetable and is great both cooked and raw such as in this recipe. We had this as a side dish for fettucini w/bbq fish and it went well with those flavors and a French Vouvray wine.

made this along with the chicken tagine dish featured in feb 08 gourmet. it was a crisp, fresh accompaniment. i really enjoyed the green olives and sundried tomatoes-- made the salad interesting and unexpected. will make again, perhaps with a fish dish.
