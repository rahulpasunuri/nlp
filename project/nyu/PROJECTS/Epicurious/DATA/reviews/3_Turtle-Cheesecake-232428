I have made many healthy versions of cheesecakes, and in general I have been happy with the results. NOT THIS TIME! My husband and I both agreed that the texture was terrible and left a bad aftertaste.

This cheesecake was AMAZING! and its very simple.. you just throw everything in the blender and you're good. i doubled the recipie because i had a large party to bake for.. and they all loved it. be sure to let it cool completely.. it tastes better chilled and solid. enjoy!

This cheesecake is more like a mediocre chunk of fudge on a plate. I have made many very good cheesecakes, especially for holiday dinners, and all have turned out very well. This was the exception. I used Fran's caramel sauce - what a waste of a very good product. This is really a no fork recipe.

I pieced this recipe together, using 3 packages of reduced fat Philadelphia cream cheese, about 3/4 cup of butter, and one box of Teddy Grahams. I have never made a cheesecake before, so there was a lot of ambiguity while creating it. I don't know if I used too much butter, or too little cookies for the crust. I also formed the crust on the sides of the pan as well, thinking that it would cover that. Barely did. Then after cooking it I saw it had melted to the bottom of the pan. Somewhat discouraged, I kept on with preparing the cheese filling. My food processor was too small, which further frustrated me. After giving up on the food processor infatuation, I resorted to the tried and true blender, which chopped up the chocolate chips to the point of ...blended and indistinguishable. The center of the cake didn't puff up like the sides, even after being refridgerated. I put caramel filling on top, and when I cut a piece (still mushy and gooey in the center, all the caramel and pecan topping poured into the missing slot. I think, if there's a next time, I will work on the crust more, use a bigger food processor, bigger chocolate chunks, and...well hope that the center cookes up better. Then leave it in the fridge much longer too. And hope for the best.

yes i must have made a typo..just made this cheesecake again for easter and used about 1/4 cup of butter... once again i eyeballed it. Im not sure what i was thinking typing 1 1/4 cups of butter? Im usually making several things at once so who knows. Lifes too short not to use butter on the holidays. I usually serve petite slices so a little butter wont kill anyone..

I haven't made this recipe, but in reading the reviews, I'm unclear on something. A couple of the reviews mention 1 to 1 1/2 cups butter, but the recipe only calls for 4 tsp. that I can see. Am I missing something?

I haven't made this recipe yet so I'm not rating it, but did want to note that the low fat cheesecake I currently make uses very little butter in the crust, and instead calls for 2 egg whites to be added. The egg white holds the crust together beautifully and doesn't add extra fat the way butter would. I can't even comprehend what 1.5 cups of butter would do in terms of fat content and don't think I could serve it to my family anyway!

well i used between a cup and 1 1/4 cups of butter... i just eyeballed it.. A cup or a little more isnt an absurd amount for a whole box of teddy grahams... Im usually more prone to measure in baking but not with a simple crust.. i just mixed butter in it until it would hold form in the pan..

Zach, Did you really use 1 and 1/2 cup of butter for the crust? I'd like to make this but the amount of butter has me stymied.

This recipe is excellent! I am a chef and this could be one of my fav cheesecakes ive ever made... I used a box of chocolate teddy grahams with about 1 1/4 cups of butter (eyeball) for the crust... I didnt use fat free ingredients because its the holidays.. I also used chocolate and caramel swirled chocolate chips... If possible bake in a water bath but it will still be great without one.. the middle wont seem very set at all right out of the oven but will be once cooled... I put caramel down, then pecans, then drizzled the melted chocolate chips to make a diamond pattern... This is a phenomenal cheesecake...my family went crazy over this... definitely worth the time to make this!!

A very good lighter cheesecake recipe.. I added fat free cool whip on the top which was delicious! My boyfriend who isn't much into light recipes loved this! Next time I make it though I am going to use light cream cheese instead of fat free for added flavor.
