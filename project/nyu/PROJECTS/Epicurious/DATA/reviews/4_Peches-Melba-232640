To the cook from Verona: you didn't actually "make" this recipe at all, so how are your comments valid for other cooks here? The recipe is beautiful as is, and nicely softens peaches that aren't quite ripe yet for serving.

This recipe can be so simple if you want to make this quickly, as I did tonight. I used ripe, delicious fresh peaches and sliced and peeled them. (no need for any additional sugary sauce). I paired them with vanilla Haagen Daz and drizzled store bought melba sauce over the peaches and ice cream. Easy and delicious!
