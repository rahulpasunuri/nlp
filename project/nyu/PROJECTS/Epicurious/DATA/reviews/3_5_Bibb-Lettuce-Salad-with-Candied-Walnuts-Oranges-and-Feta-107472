I didn't think the dressing needed any added sweetness. I also only used about 1/3 of the dressing, which was plenty. Blood oranges make it even prettier.

Just ok. The dressing was tart, the cheese is slightly acidic and the orange is citris so nothing sticks out but the crunch of the walnuts. I think using the blue cheese instead of the feta would have added some contrast to the salad.

This salad was very good. I added advocado and pears to it as well, and threw in a dash of Splenda to the dressing. It was great!

Without any modifications, I'd give it 2 forks, but punching up the dressing with sugar/splenda, salt and pepper, and replacing the orange peel with orange zest makes it a 3 fork.

I brought this salad (unassembled) to my Thanksgiving get together and assembled it (after making the walnuts, oranges and dressing ahead of time) in less than 5 minutes. The salad was a hit. I think that 1/4 cup white wine vinegar is probably a bit much for the dressing - I threw in a little sugar to take out some of the sharpness.

Easy and refreshing. Substituted pecans for the walnuts and Boston lettuce for the Bibb Lettuce.

Nummy! I thought the dressing needed something too so on another cooks advise I added 2 T finely chopped scallions, 1/2 tsp more grated oranged peel, salt and a pinch of sugar. Love the orange and feta together.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner - we had lamb vs a turkey - and everyone enjoyed it. I also added dijon instead of dry mustard; liked this substitution. The dressing was delicious. Also happy to find the steps for candied walnuts - I am makink those to use in another salad.

I made this recipe last Christmas Eve and it got rave reviews from my guests. One friend approached me yesterday (!) for the recipe! It must have made an impression. I need to find one to top it this year !

I'm sorry to disagree with the other reviews, but I was not impressed by this salad. The orange and feta combination just didn't work in my opinion. The dressing was also bland.

The four servings are small. I would double this for four people. But it came out great. I had to substitute Dijon mustard for the dry mustard, and it worked fine. There were too many walnuts for me, this could be cut back somewhat. I did make the walnuts as described instead of purchasing the packaged, candied ones. The method described in the recipe works really well, and it was so easy! Great salad!

Candied walnuts were excellent, as was the nut-cheese-fruit combo. Next time I think I'll add something to the dressing - maybe shallots and more orange zest. It needs something.
