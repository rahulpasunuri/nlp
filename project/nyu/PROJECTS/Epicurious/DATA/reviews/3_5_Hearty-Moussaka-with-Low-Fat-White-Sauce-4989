This recipe was spectacular I made it pretty much as written -- except I happen to have a few more potatoes and a few less eggplant than it called for. I used more cinnamon than needed and it was amazing. Everyone was raving. It tasted even better the next day. Yum Yum Yum.

Greek Moussaka contains lamb, so I used that instead of beef. It was good, but I thought the meat-sauce was a bit mushy. I liked the addition of vegetables, and would probably add more potatoes. The white sauce was acceptable, but nothing can compare to the rich bechamel sauce of eggs and real milk the Greeks use. Why put all this work into a watered down version?

It was just ok. Made exactly as written. The "lowfat" white sauce was good.

Great recipe. Very tasty. Just a couple notes--It is time intensive to make. My veggies didn't need the full 40 mins to cook. Yhe white sauce tasted okay and browned nicely on top, but I wasn't a fan of the texture. It was smooth when I poured it over the zucchini but turned somewhat clumpy during the baking.

I'm going to give this two stars, but my boyfriend gives it three stars. I thought it tasted kind of like hamburger helper. Also, this quantity was a little bit too much for my 13 x 9 x 2 inch baking sheet - might want to scale down the white sauce. However, I was surprised at how tastey the white sauce is! It doesn't taste that low-fat.

Delicious, but VERY labor intensive. I will make again, but ONLY on a weekend when I have plenty of time.

I made this recipe exactly as written except (accidentally) I bought tomatoes in puree instead of juice. I think this was a happy accident as I tend to like things on the tomato-y side. Also, I used 90/10 beef. My husband, who is 1/2 Greek, with family still living in Greece that cook for us when we visit, declared this "as good a Moussaka that he's ever had". And with low fat sauce to boot. :)

I admit I don't know what the real dish tastes like, but this was wonderful. I did make quite a few changes. I used yellow gold potatoes and sweet potatoes, along with yellow squash. I skipped the eggplant because my family doesn't like it. I tried substituting broccoli, but it scorched in the oven so I threw it out. I used whole eggs, not just whites and it really seemed to hold the beef together. This was very satisfying for a cold fall night.

Rating: 2
Followed this to the letter and found that 40 min. at 475 is too long to cook veggies. They were too soggy though potatoes were just right. No need for egg whites in meat sauce, only made it more soggy. Flavor was terrific but everything was mush. White sauce scorched although I cooked it on low and stirred constantly. Will not make recipe again.

I went to Greece and I love moussaka. I cannot find good moussaka in Sacramento, CA. This is my third recipe for Moussaka and i didn't like it at all. Maybe it was the lowfat white sauce that i didn't like. I don't know. My guest, on the other hand ,said he loved it. He never had moussaka before and thought this dish was excellent. I doubt i would try this recipe again. If i did, then i would brush good olive oil on the veggies, instead of using my cheap olive oil spray. Also, I seasoned too much with black pepper somewhere.

This is really fabulous. I made it as the recipe specified, except used ground turkey as opposed to beef since i don't eat red meat. HUGE hit.

Rating: 0
This was yummy, but I switched it up a little. I substituted ground turkey for beef. Then, I added the white sauce to the meat sauce to make a pink sauce that I ladled over sliced eggplant on the botttom (instead of the potatoes) and one layer of the meat sauce only. Topped by the roasted sliced zuchini mixed with roasted 1/2" cubed eggplant on top layer.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Met the expectations gained eating Moussaka in Greece this summer. I would DEFINITELY keep the same amount of seasoning as recommended - not overwhelming at all. Also, drain the fat after browning the meat, cut the roasted eggplant into bite sized pieces, and double the amount of potato, adding a layer toward the top - my whole family especially liked the potato. I'll make this again - possibly for my Dad's 90th b-day party.

Rating: 0
I have made this at least a dozen times. I omit the cinnamon and nutmeg. But it is always a hit and worth the effort. Not a high degree of difficulty but time consuming, especially the slicing and roasting of vegetables. I also don't use the zuchini. Just eggplant and potatoes.

Delicious! I thought the amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg were just fine but I wouldn't go a speck over 1/4 tsp for the cinnamon. This dish makes great leftovers, too.

This is my new go to moussaka. The flavors were perfect and I love the fact that I can eat a huge portion with no guilt. The recipe says it serves 8 and an 8th of this is a mammoth portion. I also substituted lamb for beef but followed the rest of the recipe to a T.

Great recipe..! Total preparation time is significant but much of this time is waiting. Here is how it worked for me: 1. Slicing vegetables and arranging on baking sheets ~ 15 minutes 2. Making tomato sauce ~ 25 minutes 3. Making white sauce ~ 20 minutes 4. Putting it all together ~ 5 minutes. So, there was about 1 hour of cooking and prep, 1 1/2 hours of waiting. Took about as long to make as the typical lasagna. It is possible to set the whole thing up ahead of time and just pop it into the oven when needed. I loved this recipe and will make again. I may add some feta cheese next time though. I like feta and just think Greek dishes should have some...!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. First off, it took 2 1/2 hours to make. After grilling my veggies, they pretty much didn't have any taste. And the nutmeg was way too much. My boyfriend ate it, although he commented on the nutmeg and said it was too much. I would have much rather used these ingredients to make shepards pie (half the time, double the taste).

This was pretty good, though quite time consuming. I've actually split the work into 3 days. When cooked as indicated by the recipe, the vegetables come out a bit mushy, I'd put them on the highest shelf in grill mode, max temp, to make them crunchier. Need to keep a close eye on them, though, to avoid scorching. Another tip -- cut the eggplants lengthwise (from head to tail) rather than laterally, they are less mushy and stiffer this way. Usage of canned tomatoes as-is is quite a time saver, but I think it it'll be best to chop them before usage (reserving the extracted juices). Low-fat white sauce is also quite nice, when first prepared on it own it still has a bit of the raw flour taste, but this goes away after being cooked in the oven. Don't put too much cinnamon or else it'll be too "sweet". Do use other spices to contrast cinnamon and sweetness (pepper, allspice, clove, etc), or use a spice blend instead, such as Baharat or Ras-El-Hanut, if you can get it.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. For a low-carb and low fat dish, my wife and I used pumpkin (perfect with the cinnamon) and parsnips for the spuds, and ground turkey in place of the beef. We doubled the cinnamon and garlic to add more flavor. Adding salt and black pepper to the sauce is key to toning down the 'sweetness' that some posters didnt like. Its one of our favorite dishes.

Rating: 3
This is a nice alternative to lasagna and a great use of vegetables. I used ground lamb and substituted feta on top and in the white sauce. Very time-intensive for a weeknight so I assembled it one evening and made the white sauce fresh before baking it the next. It's a great ooey-gooey recipe for a cold night.

I used a "white sauce" from another web site and saved my self alot of time. Over medium heat, melt a package of reduced fat cream cheese with about one can of evaporated skim milk. Whisk until smooth. I added a pinch of ground cloves,cinnamon and nutmeg. (You can season this to taste.) And instead of parmesan cheese, I used feta. Yum!

This got a "this is good!" from my 13-year-old son, who would never knowingly eat eggplant or zucchini. I did revise the recipe a good bit, though, mostly to make it serve 4 instead of 8: I used 1/2 the called for vegetables and cut them into 1/2" cubes before roasting for 15 minutes only. While I did use the whole pound of meat, I used only 1/2 the tomatoes + a cup of red wine for simmering. Also skipped the egg whites and bread crumbs, but used the custard from the Quick Moussaka recipe on this site,which is more substantial even when made with egg substitute. But to have a veggie-hater call it good, works for me!

I converted this recipe to Low Carb as well as Low Fat for our trendy times. To do this, I use low-carb breadcrumbs, and substituted Turnips and Parsnips for the potatoes. The results were fantastic! I would definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe and healthy too. The potatoes were nice and crunchy and the white sauce was perfect on top (I did use more butter). The next time I will substitute lamb for the beef. Excellent!

I made this recipe twice this weekend simply because I LOVED it! I cannot speak to its "authenticity", but all I know is that it tastes absolutely wonderful and is healthy too and that's certainly good enough for me! This is a MUST-TRY. I will be making this again and again all winter.

This just isnt very authentic tasting. I have moussaka a lot in Greek restaurants and it did not compare. I will keep searching for a good recipe. Some churches have Greek Fests in the summer and they often sell cookbooks that they compile. Now those have GOOD greek recipes!!

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe. It was good but not as great as I expected based on the reviews of others. My vegetables didn't brown and the eggplant looked like dehydrated apple chips when they were done. Maybe I didn't use enough olive oil spray. It was low fat and healthy so that was a benefit.

It took some time to make - but was WELL worth the work. I made a couple of minor variances, adding some extra parmesan to the white sauce (which also was exceptional) and an extra layer of potatoes and maybe used a few more vegetables and seasoning than it called for - but it was fabulous. I am Greek - and this is the best Moussaka I have made!

Rating: 3
It was Delicioius!! As the previous reviewer mentioned this dish tastes like it is so rich but it really isn't. Since I love veggies I reduced the amount of meat and increased the amount of zucchini and eggplant. My meatlover husband didn't suspect a thing! TIP: Using a mandoline to slice the vegetables it takes about 45-60 mins to prepare and assemble this dish. If time is a constraint assemble the dish beforehand and prepare the sauce right before baking. Enjoy!

I'd never made moussaka before, so decided to try this recipe based on all the positive reviews. I I used leeks and shallots instead of onions, and a few more breadcrumbs than specified. I also sliced the potatoes and zukes a bit too thin. However, it came out excellent! The low-fat white sauce was unbelievably delicious and the spices added just the right touch. I'm very happy to find such a rich-tasting, low-fat dish and will definitely make again.

My boyfriend and I thought this dish was fantastic. We both love eggplant and thought it was devine in this casserole. I was worried about the cinnamon at first; I had fears of the dish tasting like cinnamon toast meets hamburger casserole. But the spice added a unique flavor that, if I didn't know it was in there, I would never guess it was cinnamon. I served this with a huge Greek salad--what a great meal!

Excellent. My husband doesn't like moussaka but loved this. Used more spices as suggested, 1/3 cup red wine to sauce. Takes some effort to roast the vegetables but well worth it.

The first time I make a new dish I like to follow the recipe as closely as possible and then make substitutions or adjustments the second time around. I don't think I will change a thing in this recipe, I really enjoyed the flavors and the lightly browned white sauce made for a beautiful dish. I prepared and assembled the dish, minus the white sauce one night, then prepared the white sauce and baked the dish the next night. I look forward to preparing this dish again and sharing with friends.

Very tasty...this is the best moussaka I have ever made. I prepared the sauce in advance, though, and wished I hadn't because it became more of a "icing" that didn't get incorporated into the rest of the dish. Next time, it goes in fresh and warm from the saucepan.

I'm a weekend warrior in the kitchen, I love to spend time cooking and I experiment alot. Most of my experiments are okay, this was divine. It's definitely a "do again." I used ground turkey to lower the calories and it was still great.

My mom likes moussaka, she almost always orders it when we go to Greek restaurants, so I decided to take a stab at making it at home. I'm a vegetarian, so I replaced the meat with coarsely mashed chickpeas. I'm sure it would have been good with meat, but even my dad who always cringes when I make lowfat vegetarian meals, had a second helping. The white sauce was a tad bland, so next time I might replace a bit of the milk with some veg stock and add a tiny bit more cheese, but otherwise it was good. Mmm mmm good.

My family is Armenian and I worked in middle-eastern restaurants for 5 years through college so I was very familiar with this dish and the way it is "supposed" to taste. I was nervous that it wouldn't turn out right (especially since I didn't have grandma to refer to) and also leary that the "low-fat" aspect of the dish would change it's flavor. I took my first bite and was absolutely delighted! I couldn't believe that what I made tasted exactly like and even better than what I grew up on! I followed the recipe to at "T" and it was perfect. I used ground beef because the store didn't have lamb. Next time I will use lamb. It took me two hours to prepare and an hour to cook but it was truly therapy for me. Make sure you plan to make it on a day when you have the time. Even though the recipe takes a long time, it is coordinated well in steps. My boyfriend who has never tried moussaka loved it and my family was extremely impressed.

My husband and I live near some of the best Greek food we'd ever tasted, so I was kind of nervous when it came time to serve this moussaka. After all, the dish took about 2 hours to make (most of it spent slicing and roasting vegetables), and I didn't have a backup dish. When I took my first bite I was overjoyed with the results. The efforts have paid off! The dish was delicious, and both my husband and I thought it tasted exactly like -- even better than -- some of the moussakas we'd had in the past. I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey to make this a true "low-fat" dish, and we were both amazed that we couldn't tell the difference. I'll definitely make this again with the ground turkey, and feel less guilty about taking a second serving. ;)

I made this for dinner last night but used a meatless substitute. We loved it and I would definitely make it again. I had not properly read the recipe before I started, so next time will make the white sauce ahead of time. It was tasty and filling. I just served it with a salad.

This is a good eggplant/ground beef/potatoe/zuchinni recipe, it didn't really taste like moussaka though. All the roasting and preping took a lot of time, but you can do that ahead of time and even assemble the dish and bake right before serving. I split the recipe into two 9"x9" pan and freezed one.

roasting all the vegetables takes a large oven or a lot of time but it is well worth it. The low fat white sauce is great.

This recipe did take a long time to make, but most of the time was spent roasting/baking, not prepping, so I didn't mind. Making the white sauce beforehand was definitely key. The only changes I made to the recipe were to keep the eggplant unpeeled and to use veggie GimmieLean ground round instead of ground beef. The final moussaka was delicious -- actually better than my mom's -- less eggy.

Rating: 4
I agree this is a great recipe. I also halved it and I also kept the skins on the eggplant -- yum! I used a slicer to slice the potatoes and zucchini so they came out a little thin and consequently crisped up in the oven. The slicer is too convenient to jettison so next time I would cut down on the roasting time. I also halved the white sauce recipe and found it wasn't quite enough for my 12x7x1.5 baking dish. I like to have a nice white sauce "head" on my moussaka. I will also be making this again soon. Hint: a food processor and/or slicer is essential to cut down on prep time. Lastly, unless your guests have really big appetites, I found half this recipe will serve more than 4.

This may be the only recipe that I've given four forks too. It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe closely, which I don't do that often. However I did cut the recipe in half, since it was only for three people, and I wasn't sure how it would turn out based on the other reviews. I skipped the tomato paste, and used whole wheat bread crumbs. I also used white potatoes. I agree about leaving the skin on the eggplant, for ease and to add more fiber to the dish. The quantities of spices were fine. For those of you unfamiliar with traditional Greek food - this is very authentic. I will be making this again soon, in a larger batch!

I am so glad I read the reviews before I made this recipie. I added ground pork to the meat and used about 2 pounds of meat and a much larger (and higher) pan. There were a ton of vegetables. I used the correct amount of cinnamon, which was just enough for 2 pounds but would have been very sweet for 1 pound of meat. I doubled the oregano and quadrupled the garlic. The only comment I got was next time, please don't peel the eggplant. Most of the flavor is in the skin and people missed that. Otherwise, rave reviews!

My husband hated this recipe, and I didn't like it either. It was all thrown out. I think it was the white sauce as we both liked it up to that point. This was our first time for moussaka. Moussaka must not be for everyone, even though we enjoy other Greek food.

Rating: 3
This recipe was a lot of work, but definitely worth it! I did the vegetable prep and cooking and the meat mixture cooking one worknight, then the following worknight I made the white sauce, assembled the moussaka, and baked it. I found that increasing the spices / garlic to 1.5 times that written helped; also, because I didn't have canned tomatoes, I used fresh with spicy clamato juice to replaced the tomato juice that would've been in the can, and I think this helped the recipe as well. My husband really liked this recipe, but felt I should increase all spicing to double that asked for in the recipe for next time.

This was excellent!! I increased the garlic, nutmeg and cinnamon and sloshed about a half a cup of red wine into the suace. I also didn't bother to separate the eggs--just laziness, using 2 whole eggs in the meat sauce and one in the white sauce. Next time I will use a bigger dish--even though I used slightly less veggies than called for, it overflowed a 9 x 13 pan. I will also use ground lamb to give it a real Greek flavor. I would think you could assemble this a day in advance and do the white sauce just before putting it in the oven. In fact, letting the flavors in the sauce assimilate overnight might make it even tastier.

Not a quick recipe, but worth the effort. Slicing & dehydrating/browning the vegetables eliminates moisture that would make the disk "soupy," but still retains the flavor. The white sauce is low cal, but flavorful. An excellent low-cal dish.

Even yummier, if your arteries can take it.
