Good but don't need to make it again. Had to use tomatoes out of season. Had to add some tomato paste to get more body into the flavor. Can really taste the herbs that are added to the soup.

My husband loves this recipe. I add a bit of minced ginger to add and the stock to 2 cups.

I made this as written with the exception of reducing the chicken broth to 3 cups. I used fresh herbs. I loved it but I'm a nut for tomatoes. I can see where adding 1/2 and 1/2 or milk would give it a creamier and soupier taste and texture. I thought the various changes made by other reviewers sounded interesting but I would not add canned tomato paste particularly if using fresh ingredients. I will certainly make again.

It's a great recipe. I made a few small changes inlcuding adding a bit of brown sugar to cut the acidity and adding day old bread to make a richer soup.

Fabulous. I took other reviewers advice and only added 2 cups of stock. I can't imagine it with 4 more...absolutely unnecessary! Pair this with a grilled cheese for the perfect meal.

Very nice soup. Even with average winter supermarket tomatoes this was lovely. I also added a little balsamic vinegar to give it a bit more depth. Can't wait to make this again with ripe tomatoes from the garden!

Really good simple recipe. As suggested by another reviewer, I roasted an entire head of garlic along with the tomatoes. I was lucky enough to have some homemade stock in the freezer so I used that as well. I added a little white rice to the bottom of the bowl and served it with a small salad,a healthy, easy, satisfying dinner. Really enjoyed it and will make again. Makes me look forward to having surplus tomatoes at the end of the season!

I didn't have roma tomatoes so I used vine ripened regular tomatoes. I didn't add as much liquid, maybe 1 cup. It tasted great. I will try the romas next time and use milk as suggested.

This soup turned out delicious. An excellent way to use up those ripe tomatoes from the garden. I took many of the suggestions on here to roast the garlic and add chicken broth only to desired consistency. We made grilled cheese to go with it, and it was absolutely wonderful. Perfect easy meal for the first day of fall!

The 4 forks is with adjustments. I roasted the garlic instead of sauteing. Used fresh rosemary and basil. No need at all for the broth -- you want to keep all that tomato flavor and the broth called for is entirely too much liquid and I think would mask the roasted flavor of the tomatoes. That would be a travesty. I just added a little water and milk while blending until I had the desired consistency. The roast tomato flavor in this soup is outstanding. Texture is exceptional -light yet with some heft. I will definitely make this again and again. Total standby.

This recipe is delicious and simple. Use as many tomatoes as possible. Even if you don't have a blender or a food processor, just smush the tomatoes with a potato masher or fork and your soup will be chunky, but still delicious. I tried roasting onions with the tomatoes, and it wasn't great. Stick with just the tomatoes, adjusting the herbs if you like, and you'll be good to go!

My kids love this so much that they won't eat any other tomato soup. Make it every Halloween with grilled cheese before trick-or-treating and the adults and the kids eat it up. Agree with the reviewer that you HAVE to use the fresh herbs. Enjoy!

So great and SO easy. I didn't have time to roast the tomatoes (in fact, I didn't have time to shop for the tomatoes, either). So I diluted a large can of tomato paste I have had in my pantry for YEARS (I can't tell you how thrilled I am to finally have THAT gone) with enough water to make it look like soup and nuked it for 10 minutes. Oh YUM.

Rating: 3
Like many others, this recipe came out waaay too watery. So my solution was to add 3 cups of rice and 1 cup of water and simmer for an additional hour. Then added 3/4 cup milk and a significant amount of parmesan cheese. After the modifications this recipe came out great! Will definitely make again!

Lots of extra tomatoes from the garden. Slow roasted them with chopped garlic, olive oil, shredded basil, s & P at 250 degrees for 3-4 hours. Used fresh rosemary and tyme. Added a few blobs of tomato paste. Blending longer then "chunky" stage made it very creamy with out the cream. Topped off with lemon pepper goat cheese. Killer.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, and it was delicious. Never made it as written. I roasted 3 large vine ripened summer tomatoes and 4 cloves of garlic in the oven. I sauteed jar roasted red bell peppers and red onion on the stove top, added the tomatoes and garlic and about 2.5 cups of chicken stock. Simmered and then pureed with immersion blender, and swished in just a touch of cream. Used same seasonings as recipes. It was delish!

I really hated this soup! I followed the recipe precisely and found at the end it just tasted like watered down spaghetti sauce. It was runny and very acidic. I think I just might be used to restaurant tomato-basil soup which is probably full of butter and heavy cream. The next day I added about a half a cup of flour, 4 oz whipping cream and 4 T. butter. It made the soup fattier but helped thicken it up and take out the acidity.

Mlbdar, I have in the past used sour cream or yogurt to make some of my soups creamy. Below link is an example of such soup. Very good. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cream-of-Broccoli-Soup-10991

family loved the flavor! Couldn't be better. I did add some milk to get it creamy, and had the same problem I've had with other tomato soup recipes, the milk curdled. This time I tried whole milk, and added it when the soup was about 100 degrees. Can anyone give some advice? I won't use cream or half and half due to fat content.

This is a delicious soup with the following modifications: first I sauteed garlic and 1/4 cup of onion. I used a large can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Tomatoes as winter tomatoes have absolutely no flavor. In addition I only used 4 cups of stock as per other reviews that the soup wasn't thick enough and 2 T tomato paste. After 25 minutes, I added 1/2 cup of non fat half and half and simmered until heated through. While that was simmering, I made grilled cheese sandwiches, cut them into crouton sized squares and served them on top of the soup. My husband thought he died and went to heaven!! Served with a wedge salad. A Keeper!!

I have made this soup numerous times with many variations. I agree with the other reviewers regarding skimping on the herbs, you must use fresh in order to appreciate the goodness of this recipe. I have also added small cooked pasta (whatever I have)to the finished product for a nice variation. This is a great soup that is even better the next day.

Rating: 3
I added about 4 T. tomato paste to this because it didn't taste quite "tomato-y" enough to me. It might not be necessary in the summer with garden tomatoes. I used fresh thyme and dried rosemary and I forgot to add the basil--still really tasty. I think some cream would make it fantastic but we are watching our calories so didn't give it a try.

I work in a restaurant and I used this soup for a lunch special one day. I modified this recipe a little bit to better suit my needs and add some more flavor. I used beefsteak tomatoes and sliced each one into 4 slices then roasted the them in a convection oven at 350 for only 25 minutes and pureed heavily. I then added all of the ingredients, substituting smoked chicken stock instead of plain chicken stock, into the pot and brought it to a boil. I then added some tomato paste and a slurry till desired thickness had been reached. I then took the soup and strained through a chinois making a smooth as silk soup. I then added some heavy cream to taste and held in the steam table for lunch service. I paired the soup with this sandwich (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Ultimate-Grilled-Cheese- Sandwich-236199) and sold out of my special within the first hour of service and still have staff asking me for the soup recipe.

It was easy to make, but tasted just ok. My dinner guests enjoyed it, but I found the flavor to be a little flat. I added extra herbs, but didn't really help. However, I made extra roasted tomato, processed it and use it as pasta sauce the next day. Roasted tomato was far more delicious as pasta sauce than soup.

I was incredibly disappointed with this recipe. It came out WAY too watery. I should have paid more attention when adding the liquid. I let it simmer longer to try to thicken it more and added cream as well, but it was still much too thin. Also, I used fresh herbs and 1 1/2 Tb of each seemed too much.

Rating: 0
What a great recipe. I substuted 2 cups of light coconut milk for 2 cups of the chicken stock. I also added 2 tbsp of fresh lime juice and roasted the seeded tomatoes slowly at 250 degrees. This added a great Thai flare to this recipe. My guests raved about it for weeks.

Rating: 4
Wonderful soup! I seeded and slow roasted the tomatoes, (250 degrees for about 2 hours) along with the olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, pepper flakes and salt and pepper. After adding the stock, I used my immersion blender. I like to float the toasted baguette, topped with freshly grated parmesan, when I serve it.

i added a few things to this recipe because the original ingredients sounded a little bland. with the garlic i added half of a red onion and sauteed until soft. then added 2 ribs of celery and 1 carrot and sauteed. i used "kitchen basics" veg stock, and added about a tbs of tomato paste. after simmering i blended the whole thing with my immersion blender, strained it, then added a little cream. it came out so good!

Bland? OK- I changed it some and it came out great. Here it goes... After roasted the tomatoes I put them in a pot of 1 sauteed onion, garlic, basil, and 8 ozs of tomato paste. Then I put a bouquet garni tied tightly. Let it simer on low heat for one hour. Removed bouquet and blended with a hand mixer. The bouquet and tomato past add flavor and remove blandness.

I love this soup -- the only time it disappoints is when I skimp by not using enough garlic or using dried herbs instead of fresh. This soup shouldn't be compared unfavorably to tomato bisque, in my opinion. It's a different animal altogether -- low in calories but very satisfying.

I've only been disappointed with this recipe when I've skimped on something (not enough garlic or using dried herbs instead of fresh). To my mind, this shouldn't be compared unfavorably to tomato bisque -- it has plenty of flavor without the cream, and I appreciate the reduction in calories.

I used canned "fire roasted crushed tomatoes" which saved time and still provided the wonderful roasted flavor. I also added jarred roasted red peppers in place of the dried crushed red pepper flakes. I put both of those ingredients together in the food processor until fairly smooth. I stirred in about a 1/2 cup of heavy cream just before serving. Served it for lunch with grilled cheese sandwiches made with aged gouda. That's comfort food!

Delicious says it all! I think I went light on the red pepper flakes and also used less broth but processed it fairly smooth (my husband would not eat tomato in "chunks").

This soup is fantastic. I roasted the leftover tomatos from my garden along with 2 heads of garlic. I followed the recipe as written. Tons of flavour, nice and spicey. For the next day, I added a bit more stock and 1/2 bagel and pureed it all. Bagel gives the soup more body and changes it a bit for second go. If I was serving this for a dinner party, I would strain it first. Can't wait to make it again and try some variations like brandy and a wee bit of cream.!

This soup is yum good! I used tomatoes from my garden and added some yellow bell peppers and roasted them right along side in the oven. I upped the red pepper flakes and decreased the stock a tad.

I made this with Muir Glen Fire Roasted crushed tomatoes, because that is what I had in stock... It was delicious & took only 30 minutes, total! Especially good the next day & so easy. I did not add rosemary, but went strong on the garlic, thyme and basil! Great, easy soup.

This Tomato soup was positivly delicious. Believe it or not, it was a bit spicy for some in my family, I am still not sure if I added to much crushed red pepper or what, but a few dashes went a long way to making this spicy. With that said, I would do it that way again, as I like a bit of a kick to my food, even tomato soup (but this soup could do without it, if you do not like hot spice). The garlic was very nice, and the fresh basil at the end seemed like a lot, but it was not, it was just right. Listening to other reviewers, I went light on the fresh rosemary, altho I did add some, about half what the recipe called for; it added a nice flavor to the dish. I am not a big fan of tomatos, at least not raw, but I love tomato soup, and cannot wait to start the garden to grow some plum tomatos just to make this soup. Does anyone know how this would turn out with a standard tomato such as a big boy?

I would give this a 2.5 rating. I would make this again, but I would make some changes. I would definitely use fresh herbs, dried one are too woody for the finished elegant product. I do not think I would add rosemary like many of the others suggested. I found it a little acidic and added a tiny bit of sugar which helped. I only used about 3 cups of chicken broth which is probably perfect. I also used high quality canned tomatoes since it is January. I am still looking for the ultimate tomato soup. This has potential, but still is just not quite there. I will keep trying.

this was a suprise hit. I found it at the very last minute. It is easy to make and my two vegetarian guests consumed the entire recipe by themselves. I wasn't sure what kind of flavor to expect from the roasted toms, but it was out of this world. I strained the soup 4 times. I would make it again, and perhaps try it with a half cup of heavy cream just to add some richness.

Absolutely delicious. I used only 1 teaspoon of each herb and then instead of fresh basil used that squeeze basil from a tube plus a shake of dried basil. The toasted bread really make delicious dipping sticks as well. I would not recommend straining the soup though cause I thought it had a nice texture and was nice and thick. Takes a bit of time to make because of the roasting and such, but well worth it. I'll be making this again and again.

Great dish. I seeded the tomatoes before roasting, and roasted a head of garlic on the sheet pan. I also threw a handful of herbs over the tomatoes while roasting (don't know if it made a difference, but our herb garden is bursting...) I think it is crucial to strain the soup before serving. Too much pulp/skin/seeds otherwise.

I made this soup for a valentine's dinner party and looked it up again so I could make it with my homegrown tomatoes and freeze it for a wonderful winter treat. To fit the valentine's theme, I toasted the bread after cutting it into hearts and then floated the hearts on top. It was pretty and festive and my guests all raved. I made it exactly as written and in advance for convenience and it was fantastic. I personally dislike cream in most soups especially tomato so don't think that this soup needs it. It is wonderful just as is.

Rating: 3
This was good, due to the fact I roasted the garlic with the tomatoes (I thought a strong garlic flavor would make the soup taste like pasta sauce). If I make this again, I would reduce the rosemary by half, and strain half the tomato puree before adding it to the stock. This was a nice light addition to our cheeze fondue dinner.

Rating: 4
Good recipe! Being a seasoned cook (no pun intended), I, like many others before me, heeded advice and changed a thing or two. I omitted the rosemary, decreased the broth to 3 cups, added the suggested 2 tbl Brandy, strained the entire soup before finishing it with the basil, about a cup of peeled, seeded, fresh tomato, and some cream. YUM!!! I will make this again and again and again in just the same way.

Excellent! I made it as per the recipe and found the seasonings perfect. This is the best tomator soup recipe. I tossed it all in the food process for a quick whirl (for a thick and hearty style soup)and thought the recipe couldn't be easier. In fact the flavor of the tomatos roasted in the oven was so wonderful in the soup that i roasted two large pans of additional tomatos and bottled them straight out of the oven for the winter. They are terrific for homemade sauces. The roasted flavour is wonderful.

I've made this dish a number of times for family and friends. It's always a huge hit. I make it as stated by the recipe with no modifications to the ingredients.

I had a bumper crop of tomatoes (not plum unfortunately) and decided to give this a try. I roasted, pureed, then strained the tomato mixture before cooking it in the pot. After cooking, I chilled the soup (it was way too hot outside to even consider eating hot soup) and added heavy cream just before serving. That made it delicious and took off the slight bitterness of the tomatoes and garlic. Next time I'll roast the garlic, too, and maybe add some other vegetables. It's definitely a good recipe to build on and experiment with.

Rating: 3
I roasted a head of garlic along with the tomatoes, and it added an interesting yet not overpowering sweetness too. Taking the suggestions of others, I also seeded the tomatoes and reduced the amounts of oil and broth. I also omitted the thyme altogether and just used rosemary. It's a wonderfully flavorful, fragrant dish that (with reducing the oil) is also low-fat. It freezes quite well, too.

Rating: 2
I would give this recipe a "three" if it didn't require major modifications. Six cups of chicken stock is way too much - I used only 3 and that seemed more than enough (I like my soups thick and chunky). I would omit the rosemary altogether - too many herbs competing for attention. The emphasis is supposed to be on the garlic so thyme and a generous helping of fresh basil is enough. I will try it again, and I should have remembered to seed the tomatoes - they detract from the flavor of the soup.

Rating: 3
The best thing about this web site is the creativity the other cooks offer -- I tried this recipe incorporating a number of suggestions from other cooks. I misted the tomatoes with cooking spray to cut down on the oil; I, too, don't like tomato seeds, so I squeezed most of them out before roasting. I only used 4 C. of broth so as to keep more of the tomato flavor. I was cooking ahead for the next day and the aroma at that stage suggested cioppino (sp?), so when I reheated it, I drained the broth from a can of chopped clams and added a chopped potato. After the potato cooked about 15 minutes, I added a half dozen chopped, thawed ready-to-eat medium shrimp, the clams and a half pkg of imitation lobster bits. It made a great lunch along with crusty french bread and a glass of white wine!
