What a bummer. Made tons of great cookies this season but these weren't in that category. Used Plugra, followed the recommendations of the other folks (without which these would be even worse), even bought a new jar of cardamom for these - still dry, crumbly (not in a good way) and just off.

I hate to say, but these are literally the worst cookies I have ever made. I like cardamom and orange, but this cookie just did not work. It was dry and tasted like bitter potpourri.

Like everyone recommended, I doubled the cream, zest and cardamom. Rolled into a log and sliced off 1/8" rounds. Guests gobbled these up faster than I could bake them! My boyfriend, who generally is indifferent to food, said they were his new favorite cookie. Wonderful recipe that I'll definitely be making again and again.

This was a good, basic cookie but I was in too much of a rush with Christmas baking to remember to follow some of the advice given in these reviews. Although I did increase the cream to 4T and it was a nice dough to roll out, I forgot about other suggestions. In retrospect, I should have upped the cardamom and fresh orange zest and, instead of a sprinkling of coarse colored sugar, I should have taken the time to frost with the citrus icing. Since I only make cutout cookies once a year (thank heaven!), I will not get to try this again until next December but since I love the combo of orange and cardamom I will definitely try it WITH changes and report back then. :)

Excellent cookie!! There is no need to increase the spices if you use fresh orange peel. I doubled the recipe and used the zest of two oranges and it was the perfect amount. This cookie with the glaze is amazing. One of the best Christmas cookies I have made. I had no problem working with the dough. I baked them for exactly 11 minutes and they came out flaky, buttery, spicy and delicious. A lovely cookie to serve with tea or to give as a gift.

Very nice taste. I followed other reviewers and increased the spices. The dough was fragile and crumbly so I made a roll and sliced them instead. Definitely will add these to my Christmas Tina this year

Exotic and delicious...the texture is also very satisfying. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices, but maintained the original cream quantity. Baked for around 12 minutes and they came out perfect. I will definitely be making these again!

These cookies are delicious, especially with the glaze. They taste like orange flavored shortbread. I added some fresh orange juice because I was a little bit short on the rind. It worked out well. Definitely better than the average sugar cookie!

My new favorite treat with a workout; a bit labor intensive but the flavors are stunning! Would also recommend doubling the zest, cardamom and heavy cream.

Kapow of orange scented buttery goodness. Did not feel like rolling out so chilled dough in logs and sliced. Easy, fast, yummy.

These cookies are fantastic! I have been making them for 3 years now. They have even replaced my normal sugar cookie recipe. You can easily substitute just lemon or grapefruit zest as well, to mix it up. The same rules apply here as with any sugar cookies! Dont overwork them and they will be buttery and fantastic!

This is a very easy recipe. These cookies are flavorful & has a nice frangence. I made these for friends and they love the cardamom cookies. I would make them again. I only added 1 extra Tablesppon of heavy cream after reading reviews. came out nice.~ Ciao

This is a wonderful addition to your cookie portfolio if you enjoy cardamom and prefer cookies with strong or unusual flavors. I used mandarin orange zest and juice from our tree for this recipe. I increased the orange zest to 2T, the cardamom to 1T and the heavy cream to 4T. I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour and had no issue with rolling it out. I used the suggested citrus icing. It was also exceptionally good. This one was good enough to make it into my Holiday Cookie Baking File.

I love cardamom so I upped the amount to a tablespoon. They are wonderful.

Wonderful, sophisticated cookie. I took other cook's advice and upped the amounts of both orange zest and cardamom and added an extra tbs of milk. A real 'tonic' to those overly sweet bar and chocolate cookies. This one could take on a tasso of espresso or a nice black tea with milk. I even baked the scraps to nibble on for myself!

i added these to my holiday cookies in 2007, and are a requested item every year. easy to make, shortbready in texture, tasty, and different than the usual. smells SO good as well

Very easy to make, and extremely delicious. I change up the ingredients to suit what I have. I've made grapefruit-cinnamon-walnut and lemon spice, which are both excellent. I've found they are improved without icing. Sometimes I make them with a circle of honey or a raspberry on top. If you are baking these cookies with green butter, I suggest adding more zest+ spice, and most certainly the honey and raspberry. I make these cookies all the time, total crowd pleaser.

Luverly cookies and a nice addition to my NYEve dinner. Will be making them again for the Lunar New Year. I removed 1/4 cup of the sugar in deference to other posters' observation. Will only delete an 1/8 the next time. Also doubled the citrus zest and added a drop of pure orange oil. Also used both ground and whole crushed cardamom with great success...these are not your normal overly sweet holiday cookies..a bit more thought provoking with the citrus and spice taste. Had no problem manipulating the dough as I rolled it out between 2 layers of plastic wrap.

I've made these cookies three times now and I highly recommend them. They are a favorite in my house, and I gave them out as office Christmas presents. The spiciness and freshness of the cookies lend themselves to winter and summer eating. Recommendation I have is to add one to two more tablespoons of milk. It adds to the creaminess of the cookies and helps to prevent them from being too dry. Also, any citrus will work well. Tangerines and lemons also work nicely with the cardamom. Love it!

These cookies were great. Really easy to make. In addition to the ground cardamom, I added some freshly crushed cardamom seeds and they really kicked up that flavor. Also, I increased the amount of orange zest by about another 1/2 tablespoon. DId not frost them, I think it would be great with frosting but the frosting is not needed. Not heavy, not overly flavored, just a buttery, tasty cookie. Kids review: extremely great, to die for!

Pretty good cookie, although dough was difficult for me. With the 2 tbsp of cream I could barely shape the dough into discs to be chilled, it was so mushy. Also, I am not an experienced baker, so maybe I did something wrong, but it took about 5 oranges to get enough zest, which took a while. I put dough in the freezer between roll-out and re-roll out and that helped a little. I did make one sheet's worth of drop cookies flattened with a glass but that was even more of a mess than rolling them out.

Interesting flavor when added the cardamom to batter. I went with the extra amount of cardamom like other reviewers suggested & chilled the dough before using. I think next time, I'll skip the cardamom all together. The dough was such a pretty orange color & the cardamom ruined the look. It was also difficult to gage when the cookies were finished, as they didn't brown around the edges as promised. I too didn't use a cookie cutter, just rolled them into balls, then in colored sugar & then flattened with a small glass. They were also a bit on the dry side, probably would be best to serve with tea or milk. I'll try again w/o the cardamom & using a spritzer.

Took a blue ribbon at the state fair with this recipe. Made this twice, both times when it was very warm. Heavy butter int he dough makes amazing cookies, but very soft dough. I got a piece of granite that I can chill so there is more time to work with the dough when the temp is warm. Filled a few of the cookies with homemade reduced sugar orange marmalade. It made sandwich cookies. Wow!!

Very nice subtle taste especially good with tea. Dough was easy to make and work with. I would increase the cardamom to a full 2 teaspoons next time. I glazed them with icing sugar mixed with fresh orange juice which makes it a perfect pale orange colour.

I baked these just a little longer than recommended, until they were a very light brown, and they were delicious. I may try icing them next time, but they were really great as is.

Exotic, elegant, exceptional stellar cookies. I did not ice them and won't bother. They are perfect without. I could not stop eating them and everyone loved them. I made them at christmas but they have been haunting me. Hoping to make a bunch for a farm work weekend with friends. As super treats. I'd love to find a way to decorate them with a touch of icing with gold leaf. I also got a bit carried away when I wanted to make them into elephant shapes but never got around to it. Next Christmas I'm going to make them look very South Asian with a little orange coloured icing and get some gold leaf on it. And stun everyone when I serve it with a little darjeeling.

These are dry cookies. The orange and cardamom come through. They are not sweet, more biscut. My mother thought that they were not that good. "Compare these to chocolate oat cookies" She said. My grandparents love them, but my mother and I don't.

I made these well after the holidays just because I wanted something with tea. These are perfect with a cup of Earl Grey. I followed the recipe this time, but found that two hours in the refrigerator made the dough way too hard to work with. Also, if the dough became too soft to work with, a few minutes in the refrigerator was enough. Next time, I'll probably skip rolling them out and just do what other reviewers did. I also decided to add a little icing, but didn't use the recommended icing. I just squeezed a little fresh lemon and orange juice into some confectioner's sugar and spread a little on each cookie. It turned out to be perfect and didn't overpower the cookie.

Easy and delicious, though I did not fuss with the icing, I just rolled them in confectioner's sugar when they were cooled down. Next time I will add a bit more cardamom. They stored very well, wrapped in plastic wrap in a refrigerated airtight tin container for over 2 weeks. Will make these again.

I would rate these five forks if I could, they were that yummy. I didn't have to add the extra cream as other reviewers did but I live in a very wet climate. I tried rolling these out the first time I made them and did not have any luck. So I rolled them into little balls and then rolled them in superfine crystal sugar (white) and flattened them into little circles, which worked really well and was easy to do. I also only used something like 1/3 cup of sugar the second time I made these because I do not care so much for too sweet, and they were really good. John from Sydney--I didn't use any frosting or icing on these because I thought they were good enough on their own. However, to add some color if that is your thing, you could use a simple egg wash to which some food coloring has been added. Apply it with little paintbrushes in whatever pattern you want before baking and you will end up with one pretty little cookie without the excessive frosting/icing taste.

Recipe worked great. The cookies disappeared before they were even frosted. We're making our second batch this same week (lots of people around - we're not that piggy).

I just made these cookies and they are outstanding! Although I make cookies every holiday, I am not much of a baker and prefer drop cookies. That said, these were really simple and delicious. I did not roll them to 1/8" -- instead I eye balled it and rolled them thin (I prefer sugar cookies to be thin) but still manageable enough to get off the parchment onto the cookie sheet. I took a shortcut and used Wilton cookie icing in the squeeze bottle to decorate the cookies which I cut into bell and snowflake shapes. With the addition of some colored sugars, they came out delicious and beautiful. I love the hint of spice -- the taste and smell -- and everyone keeps asking what the secret ingredient is. Make these and you will get compliments! They are definitely a step up from the plain sugar cookies that abound this time of year. These are going on my must-make list for my annual holiday cookies.

I just made these this weekend and they are fabulous. I am not much of a baker and although I make cookies every holiday, I typically don't do those that involve rolling and cutting dough. I found these to be quite easy to make.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The flavor of the cookies was just right - a really nice break from endless nutmeg this time of year. Unfortunately, the cookies as described are a long run for a pretty short slide. My guess is that everything must be just right in order to get the consistency of the dough such that you can easily work with it at 1/8" thickness. If I made them again (uncertain - so much danged butter), I'd definitely use wax paper instead of parchment paper for all none-oven steps. The dough was just not easily managed, even when cold, on parchment paper. Lastly, I'd love a recommendation for some frosting that doesn't involve a pound (yes, one freaking pound) of confectioner's sugar. Good lord. John

Excellent flavor to these cookies with icing. I also used an additional 2 Tbsp of cream to hold the dough together and only chilled the dough once, not twice as stated in the recipe and they still rolled out nicely.

Just made these cookies- they are absolutely delicious. Great texture. Needed to add 2 T. extra heavy cream as dough was not wet enough to unite.
