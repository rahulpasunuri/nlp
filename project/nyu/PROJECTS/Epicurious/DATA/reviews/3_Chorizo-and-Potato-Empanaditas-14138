Our first experience with deep frying was this recipe (and during a dinner party no less!). We followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Served with guacamole for dipping.

I made these for a party and everyone raved. I used "soyrizo," a soy-based chorizo, because real chorizo creeps me out a little bit (OK, a lot). It was not as greasy and nobody knew the difference.

Needs a whole lot more kick. Be sure to use a good quality chorizo. I added a few dashes of Tabasco, a little chili powder and cumin. The ratio of chorizo to potato is very important. Too much potato will render the empanaditas very bland. I also added a dash of chili powder to the masa dough. After doctoring, they were extremely well received.

I used a standard empanada dough rather than using the Masa Harina.... Also, I substituted sweet italian sausage that I doctored up with spices and chiles. It is better to have the filling very fine rather than coarse. They were eated with rave reviews

A horrible waste of food and time.
