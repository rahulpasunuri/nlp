Wow. This is a great apricot recipe. I used frozen apricots, cut in half and pitted while they were still frozen. The roasting really helps hold them together. I also used 1/2 log of almond paste, omitting the almond extract, and blended the paste in the cuisinart with the blanched almonds. Since the paste has sugar in it, I 1/2ed the sugar amount in the frangipane. The broiled sugar makes this tart great.

This was a great recipe. Really easy (we cook a lot, but I think most people would consider this easy), and great results. I found that the apricots weren't as cooked as I wanted after the roasting, so I broiled them on high for a few minutes too, until they were caramelized, and they were perfectly tender, sticky, and caramel-y in the tart.Yum!

For baking this easy, you won't find a better looking, better tasting pie. Not too sweet, not too tart and the almond mix is a perfect match for the roasted apricots. I also did one with raspberries, which was just as yummy (but unlike the apricots, the raspberries need no roasting). Tips: I coated both pies with their matching jams instead of sprinkling them with sugar. Just microwave jam slightly before spreading. Personally, the result is a subtler one.

This was delicious and looks very professional. It is neither too rich nor too sweet, but has rather European flavor. My 11" tart pan isn't 1" deep, but that wasn't a problem.

I used canned peaches instead of apricots, and the tart still came out great! I am going to try it with different fruits as well. The frangipane filling was light but satisfying.
