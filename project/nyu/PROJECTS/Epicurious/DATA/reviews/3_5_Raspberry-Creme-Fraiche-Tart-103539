This is nearly identical to the raspberry cream tart in Deborah Madison's Local Flavors cookbook. I had made that one this summer and was less than thrilled. The cake part was very nice but the rest didn't integrate well. I like the suggestion about doubling the cream filling though.

Great tart! Was a big hit. Used raspberries or red currants, would not use blueberries. Definitely a keeper!

This is a really great recipe but I thought there was a bit too much cake the first time I made it. So I always double the custard now and it is absolutely delicious!!! Guests always love this one.

I have made this recipe many times over the past three summers. My kids love it! Simple, not too sweet and very easy to make.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I have friends who request that I bring it whenever we get together. It is easy and quick to make.

This is a great tart. Very easy to assemble and also very eye appealing. I added a Tablespoon of lemon zest to the cake batter and also used frozen raspberries and blueberries for the color. Two thumbs up!!

It looks like I'm the only dissenting opinion here but, oh well...I found this cake very dry and bland. with an uappealing texture. I used blueberries (frozen); the baking time as suggested may have been too long. A disappointing recipe.

I have made this wonderful tart more than twenty times since it was published in Bon Appetite and everyone loves it. Unable to find creme fraiche I substituted 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 c sour cream, 1/4 c sugar and one egg for the filling. Looks exactly like the photograph and is a sure fire hit!

My sister has tried and strongly recommends this recipe, but as I haven't yet tried it myself, I won't say anything there. However, for the cook who couldn't find crème fraîche and didn't want to use the "substitute"--the heavy cream/buttermilk mix *is* crème fraîche. The note is there because in some parts of the country you can buy it already made; if you can't find it, these instructions are to make it yourself (which works equally well if you have the time to let it sit).

This could be considered on the bland side if you served it alone, but this is an excellent recipe when you are looking for something to complement an ice wine or other dessert wine where you don't want the dessert to overpower the wine. It is a perfect for this because it is fresh and pretty and not overly sweet.

This is a very good recipe. I made it for a party I had at home and it was so wonderful that I made it again for a caterer I do bakery for. Now it is a favorite with her clients too!

Love this recipee! I agree with the suggestion to add lemon juice, it kicks up the flavor! I make this for dessert on weekends whenever I can get great raspberries and I want to do something special. For others who like the berries, you must try the white chocolate layered raspberry cheesecake from Bon Appetite

I have not actually made this (yet!), but in response to those who can't find creme fraiche, I have in the past used Devon cream as a substitute and the results have been very good.

I made this tart for a wedding shower and it was really the smash success of the buffet table.It was so pretty! AND the flavor is wonderful, although I do have to say, for myself personally, that the custard is not as delicate as I had hoped.

I have made this recipe many times...but after the first time I thought it needed something!!! I added the zest of one lemon and juice of 1/2 a lemon and the difference was amazing. This recipe went good to wow!!! A lemon and raspberry lover's dream...Enjoy

I thought this recipe was delicious! I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.

This tart is excellent! I'll definitely make it again! Mine seemed to be browning too quickly, so I loosely placed a piece of aluminum foil over the pan for the last 5 or so minutes. But the foil ended up sticking to the top of the tart, so be careful if you do this. One of my male friends was so impressed with this dessert that he declared that he's moving in with me ;-)

I needed to use up some rapsberries from my garden, so I made this for a dinner party and there was not a crumb left. I substituted non-fat sour cream for the creme fraiche, which worked very well. The tart was very light, easy to make and looked just like the photo. I'll definietly make this one again!

I never made this tart. I am a subscriber to the magazine and thought the picture looked good. However, my question is can anyone actually find "creme fraiche"? I tried 6 different stores and no luck. I know a substitute was listed but I decided not to try it. After reading the reviews I'm glad I didn't bother!

The recipe instructions are, unfortunately, not very precise, which is especially bad for someone who doesn't have the picture of the final product. This recipe doesn't specify the position of the rack on which the tart is to be baked. It instructs the cook to place the baking sheet on the lowest level in the oven, but we don't know whether the filled tart pan is to be placed for baking on that lowest rack or on the lower-middle rack, which is usually the case. The batter preparation instructions are very skimpy as well. Do we have creaming here and therefore add each egg separately, or are all the 3 eggs dumped into the batter all at once? Also, the recipe mentions that the tart is ready when the edges are brown. Does this mean that the center should still retain its original cream color or should it also acquire some coloration (again, without the photo it's hard to tell)? Can the readiness of the tart be tested by inserting a cake tester? I tried to make this recipe, and it came out OK, kind of on the boring side. I actually baked it 10 min longer than the recipe instructs because even after 45 min the surface of the cake was still quite bubbly, which is something the recipe doesn't mention either (I didn't know whether it meant that the cake was or was not ready yet). A better guidance for those of us who are not very experienced in baking would have been greatly appreciated.

I love this recipe. It is light and really wonderful after a big meal! Not only did it taste good and look beautiful...it was one of the easiest recipes I've made in a while. I will definitely do this one again.

I've already made this tart twice and plan to again this weekend for a dinner party. Very easy, very tasty. In my oven, the recipe works exactly as written.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. To serve it I drizzled some left over creme fraiche on each plate, put on a slice of the tarte, added some fresh rasperries and sprinkled all with a dusting of powdered sugar. It was great! Be sure to watch the baking time closely as others mentioned.

I thought this recipe was wonderful, as did the ten other people who tried it. It was as easy as it was delicious.

I looked amazing, but tasted - well - boring. Perhaps almond essence or lemon would help?

Rating: 3
Easy -- looks like you spent a great deal of time -- tastes fantastic -- BUT, there is no way you should bake for 45 minutes -- closer to 35 minutes and probably at 350, not 375.

Recipe is amazingly simple, the cakelike crust doesn't get soggy like typical pastry crusts. Using only egg whites in the crust is a way to make it slightly healthier.

This was sort of a disappointing outcome from a bunch of wonderful ingredients. It was good, but nothing great.

I thought this tart was lovely, and very simple to prepare. It came out just like the picture, and was so delicious my boyfriend (who typically doesn't go crazy for deserts) had three pieces! How's that for a rave review! I am looking forward to making it again this weekend.

The picture in the magazine looked so good I had to make this tart right away. But the results were a little disappointing- nothing to write home about.
