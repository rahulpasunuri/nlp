homemade basil pesto, homemade breadcrumbs instead of flour, a touch of white wine in the pan before it goes in the oven. heavenly.

Pretty good. Not amazing, but good. I used store purchased pesto and shallots. I feel like this was a little bland. If I were to make this again, I would definitely try some of the suggestions in the reviews, i.e. adding wine, using flavoured bread crumbs and parmesan for the breading. I would probably throw in some garlic, as well.

Made this dish tonight on a whim. Was going to do homemade pesto with pasta and chicken and saw this recipe, so gave it a whirl. It was a hit! And super easy. I made pesto with basil, which I prefer. Cooked exactly as specified and the chicken was perfectly cooked and tender. Also deglazed with some white wine before throwing in oven, and tossed remainder of pesto with whole wheat pasta and zucchini on the side. Used toothpicks without a problem, by the way.

I have been making this dish since i got married in July, 1991. It is always a huge hit! I make extra pesto & keep @ room temp.(with cheese). I then toss it with pasta on the side. Perfect dinner!

I have to say - I saw this recipe online yesterday while I was trying to figure out what to make for dinner. So I didn't have the right ingredients, so I just improvised and stuffed the chicken with gouda and spinach - I followed the technique exactly, and it was delicious. I will definitely mix and match again, and the next time I'll try it according to the real directions.

Delicious!!! I used homemade basil pesto instead and used the pocket method (flattened the chicken, and folded half over the stuffing). The filling stayed right in place. Also deglazed skillet with white wine befoer popping in the oven. It was so delicious, so flavorful.

Absolutely delicious! I also deglazed the pan with a little white wine before baking, and I tied each roll with kitchen string instead of trying to thread toothpicks. The string is much, much easier to work with and you don't get near as much leakage as you do with toothpicks.It takes a little more time to remove than just pulling out the toothpicks, but the result is worth it.

Loved it. Great flavor...will definitely be making this one again. Don't be lazy...make the homemade pesto...you won't be disappointed...it's easy to make and is delicious. A couple of toothpicks does the trick to keep the rolls together. Also liked the suggestion to add a little white wine just before putting into the oven.

This recipe is to die for! I made it twice in one week, once with store-bought basil pesto and once with the fresh thyme pesto. I don't agree with the chef that the thyme pesto make a big difference. It's delicious both ways, and not too difficult!

I used mozzarella instead of goat cheese & basil pesto instead of thyme- a huge difference, I know, but I didn't really like it. It was really oily with the pesto.

Wonderful, easy recipe! I needed a speedy version of this recipe so I used store bought pesto (like other reviewers suggested). I mixed the pesto with goat cheese and spread this on the chicken breasts. (I did not pound the chicken breasts, just folded them in 1/2 and used a plain toothpick to hold in place.) Added some extra dry white wine to the baking dish and baked at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes or so. Flavor of the sauce this combination produces is divine!

Thanks to all before me for the advice. I used Brie (didn't have goat) and used my own basil pesto. I added some wine to the baking step. The "sauce" that resulted was great. I removed the chicken rolls (kept them warm) and added a little extra wine and chicken stock to the baking juices and reduced a bit. Because of the sumer bounty, I chopped up fresh tomatoes, added them to the sauce and served it over the rolls. GREAT.

A very easy and delicious recipe. The only modifications I make are using store bought pesto and adding chicken broth to prevent the chicken from drying out while in the oven.

This can be really fast and easy if you just buy a good pesto. I have also made it the long way (according to the recipe)and it is wonderful. I use seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour. The white wine is a great addition and be sure to save some to drink with the meal. Goes well with asparagus.

I used regular pesto and folded the chicken in half instead of rolling. I also stole from my favorite chicken recipe and dredged in flour/salt/pepper mixture, dipped in egg and coated with parmesan cheese before browning in butter/oil. Dry white wine over the chicken is a must before putting in oven. It turned out sooo moist and delicious.

I've made this recipe twice - once for my boyfriend and once for a dinner party. Both times, it was absolutely wonderful. I took other reviewer suggestions and deglazed the pan with a dry white wine before baking...which added a nice flavor and also kept the chicken incredibly moist. I was sure to pound the breasts well before rolling them with the pesto/cheese inside and had no problem with any unrolling, etc. The presentation was actually so nice to look at, I couldn't believe I actually made them!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. My husband and I make this again and again. So easy for a weeknight dinner and the flavor is sublime. We buy thin-cut, boneless, skinless breasts from Foster Farms and pound them even thinner. They roll up perfectly every time and yes, they still leak, but we really don't mind.

I give this recipe 4 forks because, it is just a delightfl dish. I really enjoyed it and i made it 2 more times after i made it the first time. I would just add a few suggestions like,I just add a touch more of salt and pepper and i added a little more olive oil.

This was sublime! I used a store bought basil pesto and Boursin cheese. I followed the advice of another reviewer and folded, stuffed and chilled chicken before flouring and sauteeing. I transfered to a pyrex dish and deglazed the pan with some white wine. I poured this over the breasts and added a dab of pesto on each, then baked. Served with roasted rosemary and sea salt potatos. The chicken was surprisingly moist, flavorful and tender. A definate keeper....oh, will try adding a touch of lemon next time.

Very tasty and would be simple to make on weekdays if the pesto is made ahead. I did not successfully roll/fold. About half of the pesto stuffing leaked out but I added wine and butter for a last minute sauce, as suggested by one reviewer, which incorporatd the leaked pesto nicely. I will make this often.

Rating: 4
Like a few other reviewers, I didn't flour and sautee prior to baking. I just stuffed the breasts, spread them with the bit of leftover pesto I had, sprinkled them with just a hint of parmesan cheese, and baked, with about 1/2 c. white wine poured in the pan for added moisture. They were tender, plump, and oh so flavorful. We all adored this dish; I'll make it again and again. (I served with mashed sweet potatos and asparagus -- a great combination of flavors!)

This chicken was absolutely delicious! I made some extra cheese/pesto mix and right before I stuck the pan in the oven, I spread some on top of the chicken and it gave it the extra taste I was looking for. It is a heavy dish, so it should be accompanied by something lighter on the side.

Rating: 3
I made this for dinner last night and it was really good. I made some changes: spread the pesto on the chicken then topped with chevre and feta, "rolled" (I am flattering myself here - "folded" would be more accurate) the chicken and secured it with wooden skewers and placed in baking dish, poured about 1/2 cup white wine in the bottom of the dish and squeezed 1/2 lemon over chicken, baked at 350 for about 20 minutes. Definitely messy and totally worth it! Enjoy!

Rating: 4
The mess was well worth it! Made the mistake of keeping the chicken together with colored toothpicks (all I had) so I had some nice spots of color when I removed the toothpicks. This certainly didn't stop my boyfriend from devouring the meal! This will become a regular in my home.

I have been making this ever since it came out in Bon Appetit originally. It is DELICIOUS and my family requests this for special dinners. It can be a little tricky to roll..I hold it together with small skewers to hold the shape. I usually make homemade basil pesto instead...it works just as well. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It is a longtime favorite. Try it with the lemon risotto listed on this site..it is a nice side dish that doesn't overpower.

I have made this several times, and if possible love it more every time. I do use store bought basil pesto, and stuff the chicken, rather than rolling it. Very rich and impressive, I highly recommend!

This recipe indeed works well with store-bought pesto. The trickiest part for me was in trying to roll the chicken. In the end, I held it together with a few toothpicks and although I wasn't sure that this method would survive browning the chicken in the skillet, it worked reasonably well. Next time, I will trim the chicken so that it has a more rectangular shape before rolling!

This was very simple to make, although it did require a little improv. on my part. The chicken was very moist and flavorful - not too heavy.

Okay, so my first attempt at this recipe was a fiasco. I sent my boyfriend to do the shopping, and he came back with chicken breast TENDERS. I did what I could with them, using 3 to 4 tenders at a time and using the stuffing method. The resulting packets were so fragile, I didn't dare brown them first, so I just baked them and then broiled them briefly to brown the dusting of flour. Of course, in keeping with the comedy of errors theme, I went and left the chopped shallot out of the filling by accident. So I just scattered it over the chicken packets and it caramelized under the broiler. (I'm not even going to recount the rest of the fiasco involving the broccoli and bacon salad and roasted garlic mashed potatoes -- sufficed to say, it involved a stopped up disposal, a missing bottle of olive oil, and sunflower seeds with their shells still on). But you know what? Delicious and tender chicken and a delightful meal anyway!!!

The goat cheese and pesto combo made this taste like a chicken gyro. It was really good, but would've been wonderful served with pita bread and olives.

Another chicken keeper! I will try the pocket methosd next time. I also used store bought pesto and that worked just fine. I gave the recipe to my girlfriend who doesn't care for goat cheese and she used Rondele or Alloutte garlic and herb cheese spread. She found it delicious, too! And instead of rolling it in the flour mixture, she rolled it in seasoned breadcrumbs. Haven't tried it that way yet.

I made the recipe per the instructions. I ribboned through the chicken 3 toothpicks, and I had no mess when cooking it. The flavor is excellent. And, my husband and I really enjoyed it. I had left over pesto, so used it the next day with pasta, veggies, and italian sausage. A hit, too.

Yummmmy! We all loved this recipe. I used store- bought pesto and it worked very well. I wasn't too sure about the goat cheese but it tasted fantastic. I pounded the chicken very thin, then stuffed and rolled it, using toothpicks to hold the chicken breasts closed. Mixture oozed out but I had extra pesto and used it to line the pan before baking. I also added fresh whole mushrooms before baking.

Agreed, stuffing rather than rolling is key. We're not big fans of the goat cheese, so we used mozzarella & fontina. Tasty.

WHAT A MESS! I would make this again, because the flavor, etc., is wonderful. However, I would follow the advice of the cook from Aptos, CA, who recommended stuffing the breasts pocket-style. I ended up with one un-rolled disaster!

I wasn't sure about the goat cheese, but it worked very well. It was fairly easy to make, and my picky husband even enjoyed it.

Very popular at my table! I used homemade basil pesto. After pounding the chicken for quite a while, however, it still wasn't thin enough to really "roll" satisfactorily -- and that made me leary of attempting the flour-and-fry method, which I was certain would spread chicken and pesto-cheese mix evenly throughout the pan. Instead I placed the semi-rolled breasts in a greased baking dish, added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the bottom so the chicken wouldn't dry out, and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. I also dribbled a little olive oil and sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top of the breasts so that they'd brown. Worked like a charm.

My family really liked this chicken and the kids are pretty picky about what they eat. I would definitely make it again.

This is a nice rendition of your basic stuffed chicken breast. I would however suggest using the pocket method of stuffing the breast rather then the roll method. In culinary school we were taught that the roll method works best with dry fillings such as herbs, ham, etc. The pocket method prevents wet ingredients from leaking out while cooking. In either stuffing method you should first start by trimming the breast into more rectangular shape before pounding. To produce the pockets, spread filling on half of the breast leaving 1/2" margin on all edges. Fold over unfilled portion to meet the filled side. Cover pocket with plastic wrap, and gently tap edges to seal in the filling. Chilling the pocket before cooking also helps to maintain the seal. You can make a sauce by deglazing the pan with white wine, sprigs of fresh thyme and butter.
