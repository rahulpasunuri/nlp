I did not find this spicy at all, in fact quite bland. The sauce is unusual and good, though. The sweet potatoes could be substituted with carrots; I did not taste sweet potatoes very much. And yes, it takes more than 45 minutes to line everything up. Next time I will add a pinch of red pepper flakes.

The other reviewers are right - the subtle and delicious sauce is the real winner here. Unfortunately, they are also right that the prep work involved makes 45 minutes a misleading recommendation. It's only do-able in 45 minutes with a co-chef (in this case, my boyfriend) and a mandolin with a julienne blade, fit to 1/8 inch, for the potatoes. I substituted rum for brandy as well, and skipped the rice. You don't need it will all the potatoes. Unfortunately, my beef came out a bit chewy, like most stir-fried beef does, and I'm considering just leaving it out next time and serving this as a veggie side dish!

I liked the colour contrast; added baby bok choy for added veg and some chili garlic sauce because without it this wouldn't be spicy at all. I think it's a good start, but needs some personalization.

This took way longer than the recipe said it would. Don't try to make this as a quick dinner - you definitely need to plan for this one. Also, the final product wasn't that spectacular, definitely not worth all the work, in my opinion.

So simple, and my family just loves it. We skip the red onion (a flavor none of us fancy), and use pre-sliced beef (available at no extra cost at our grocery) which cuts down a little on the prep time. Dirties up a few extra bowls, but well worth it.

For one thing, this is not a quick-fix recipe. Forty-five minutes or less is unrealistic. Especially with a hidden prep item. The recipe didn't mention thinly slicing the beef while still partially frozen---a step that should have been included. Other than that the recipe was okay---just not quite worth the bother.

I thought the sauce had a perfect blend of flavours. Especially with the hoisin sauce, which can actually be used in a lot of European dishes as well, for instance beef stews. However, the water chestnuts were superfluous in my opinion; they taste just like salt water. The next time I'll add some bok choy and green pepper as well, turning it into a sort of chop suey variant.

Yum!!! I use the sauce for most all beef stir-fries now. It isn't really very spicy at all, so I do add garlic chili sauce.

My family and I enjoyed this, but where is the spice in "Spicy Beef"? The next time I make it, I'm going to put some spices on the beef before stir-frying (since I'm in New Orleans I'll use a salt-free Cajun spice mixture like Bayou Bang).

I thought this recipe was excellent for those who like a little bit of sweet with their spicy. It is top on my list of stir fry recipes. A couple of suggestions: If you are using a wok, its really not necessary to remove any ingredients from the wok. Just push them to the side. If you like your vegetables a little bit more tender allow them to simmer for a few minutes in the sauce before serving. If you are looking for something a little more spicey, try using chili oil rather than peanut oil to cook the beef.

This was a pretty good recipe. One thing I thought it lacked was perhaps some fresh chopped chilli. Other than that I'd say it was good.

I thought this dish was fantastic and so did my family and guests. Very flavorful, great combination of tastes. I added a couple serrano chilis tot he vegetables, and some crushed red pepper tot he meat while it cooked, but otherwise followed ther ecipe exactly and it was terrific.

Very tasty dish which my whole family enjoyed. Easy to prepare, but preparation was time consuming.

It sounded captivating, but that is as far as this dish can go. Other than into the disposal. A family who is usually ready to try most anything and are usually kind about what is prepared were completely silent. Behind my back they destroyed the recipe. I would have done it myself.
