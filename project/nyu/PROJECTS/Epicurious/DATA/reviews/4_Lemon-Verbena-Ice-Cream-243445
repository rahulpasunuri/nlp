I was wondering what to do with all the lemon verbena my plant yielded. This recipe was delicious, and very rich. The ice cream takes on the wonderful flavor that people can't quite figure out until you tell them.

Delicious! My only real complaint is that there was not enough. Next time I will use more lemon verbena to up the lemony taste. (Even a little lemon zest might be nice too.)
