Good starting point with lots of potential for variation. I added tarragon, minced shallots and a healthy squeeze of lemon juice. Good warm and cold the next day. Since I measure with my eyes, I don't know about portions but I think I used a little more olive oil. Let sit and stir every 10 or 15 minutes to let the potatoes soak up dressing. Good with grilled fish.
