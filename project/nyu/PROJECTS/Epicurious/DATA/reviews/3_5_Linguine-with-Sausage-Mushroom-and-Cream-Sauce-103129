This is fabulous & will be added to my permanent recipe collection! Appreciation to suggestions of other reviewers. After sauteing Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage, drained it on paper towels. There was almost no rendered fat in the pan, & I added a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan. When it had reduced by 3/4, added a little olive oil in which to saute the Crimini mushrooms, shallots and 2 minced cloves of garlic. Proceeded with specified amounts of cream and chicken broth. Absolutely delicious!

I don't understand this recipe at all. The sauce was way too watery and there's wasn't enough to coat the pound. It was like soup and pasta. What a waste.

I didn't end up adding any extra chicken broth and there was enough cream sauce to go around, since I would rather have a creamier consistency. The italian sausages were a great choice. I used shiitake mushrooms as some other reviewers did and it tasted great.

SUPER EASY, SUPER FAST and TASTY. We used shitake mushrooms and they gave it a good flavor. Will probably add some shallot or garlic next time as well. Working moms need dishes like this.

This is very easy and delicious. I recommend only using shittake mushrooms for a robust flavor and you can use bow tie pasta as well.

The casings were difficult to remove but this is a great comfort food dish. My boyfriend adores it and has to be one of the pickiest eaters.

I can't see how everyone likes this recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out horrible. The sauce was very watery and there wasn't nearly enough sauce to coat the whole pound of pasta that it calls for. The recipe suggests adding more broth if there isn't enough sauce but, it was already way too thin.

Very simple, good for a mid week dinner. I used turkey sausage, and followed the directions exactly. Yum!!

This was absolutely to die for! I did make some changes to the recipe, though. Since I had some spicy Italian sausage that needed to be used, I used that instead of sweet. It tasted great and I added extra crushed red pepper, to satisfy my boyfriend's spicy appetite. The sauce is the perfect consistency, creamy, without being overwhelmingly thick. It is satisfying and delicious! Definitely a keeper.

Made this the other night for my family. It was quick and easy and my kids just loved it. I used baby bella mushrooms this time but I will probably try a mixture of portabella, crimini and shitaki the next time for more flavor.

This was ok. Nothing special. You got the sausage, mushroom, cream and cheese taste with no major kick or flair. I like more the "different" recipes, but if you like the basics this one will do fine.

Very good, and even better the next day.

This was easy and tasty, but a similar recipe, "Fettuccine with Creamy Tomato-and-sausage Sauce" is much tastier, almost as easy. and not quite as heavy as this sauce.

Rating: 2
I am surprised by all of the reviews saying that the sauce was not thick enough. I found this dish to have too little sauce. Maybe it's because I let most of the mushroom liquid evaporate before adding the cream/broth mixture. It seemed quite dry to me. I added more liquid and cheese at the end to make it more saucy. Still, it was tasty, but there are other similar recipes out there which are better.

Pretty good with a definite Stroganoff flair. Added one glove of minced garlic but it could do with some onion. Reduced the amount of broth since it seemed a bit too much liquid. To achieve a thicker sauce, simmer for 10 mins. Should thicken up quite nicely.

This is a very easy dish to make. It has excellent flavor and the dried pepper sets it off perfectly. I will make this very often.

YUM! I'm a novice cook who doesn't have a million ingredients lying around - and this was great! I used turkey & chicken sausage (w/ a little olive oil as suggested by someone), portobello mushrooms, and a little onion. My husband loved it - and he doesn't usually rave about pasta. We're going to have the leftovers tonight (he also never likes leftovers) and add this one to the regular rotation!

This was delicious, and will become a regular dish. Don't be scared off by people who substitute for 2/3 of the ingredients and then wonder why they didn't get the same results. Ground turkey and evaporated milk? You must be joking.....

I think this is really more of a 2&1/2 star dinner, but maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it after all. I did alter it some: Used ground turkey breast with italian seasoning, vegetable broth and evaporated milk (I had open cans...). I also added garlic powder. Pretty good, but I think it could stand a little more broth on the leftovers...the pasta soaks up juice rather quickly.

I agree that the sauce was way to liquid-y. I made it with fettucine and the pasta was floating in the sauce, even though I had added extra cheese. I thickened it by melting some butter, adding flour, and pouring the sauce in and it was great. Also, I used 1c. parmesan and 1c fontina the next time I made it and it was fabulous. Even the leftovers were gone by the next afternoon!

Though the components are not the same, this dish tastes somewhat like beef stroganoff. It's delicious, but not completely what I was expecting. Adding vegetables helps to balance out the large amount of sausage.

The quality and flavor of the sausage can vary the results of this dish. If your sausage is very lean, as mine was, you may need to add some olive oil to the saute pan. You can drain sausage on paper towels if it seem too greasy. Our guests really "ate it up".

I lightened the recipe up a bit by draining the sausage on a paper towel and also by using whole milk rather than whipping cream. I still had a creamy consistency without all the guilt.

Terrific and easy recipe. The shallots add a nice touch. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than heavy cream and reduced the sauce--it seemed a little too liquidy. I found draining the sausage on paper towels was crucial to reducing the amount of grease. All in all, it's a winner.

Ugh, this recipe was ok, but not fabulous. First, I thought there was WAY too much sausage in it! I would almost do half beef and half sausage if I did it next time. That and it was greasy from the sausage which I didn't like. Other than that, it had a good taste and was liked.

This recipe rocks. I usually add garlic or shallots in with the mushrooms and let the sauce reduce a bit too but it always tastes great and I make it at least once a month.

Great recipe!!! rich, tasty and very easy to make

This dish was delicious. Since I don't like things too spicy, I reduced the crushed red pepper to 1/8t. I thought it was just right for me. I also used reg. chicken broth and had only 1/2c of parm cheese, but it was still great. I think it would have been better with more cheese, but my husband didn't notice anything missing. He LOVED it.

Really liked this dish, I love creamy pasta type dishes and the sausage made it quite a meal. I did add a little garlic and onion and cooked the mushrooms with a couple good dashes of white vermouth, for extra flavor. Use good pasta, definetly cooked al dente, and mangiare per essere grasso!!!

As a novice cook, I found this relatively easy to prepare, and both my wife and I were delighted with the results. A definite keeper!

This recipe was okay. However, the whipping cream never got quite thick as it should. It was after we allowed it to sit for awhile (20 min) that it got a little thicker. It lacked something, however I can't pin point it. Otherwise, it was okay. My husband like it.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party. Everyone raved. It's quick, easy, filling, and delicious! I used crimini mushrooms because they impart more flavor. I also added more cheese than the recipe calls for. This recipe has been added to my list of favorites.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it. Since I used regular chicken broth I didn't add extra salt. I will make this again for both family and friends.

This recipe requires more cheese than is recomended. It has a very unique flavor which belnds well with a side of garlic bread. I would definitly make this again. It's great to experiment with.
