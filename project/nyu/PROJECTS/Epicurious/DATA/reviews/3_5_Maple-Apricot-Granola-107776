I thought this was ok - I keep going back to Everyday Granola.

One more thing: roast at 325, not 350, and it's less likely to burn.

For years, my husband teased me for making my own granola. . . until he walked into the kitchen after a long bike ride. He smelled the batch cooling on the counter and started to nibble. He liked the taste and wondered what would happen if I added chocolate and peanuts. I still enjoy this recipe as I always have, but it is now the base for homemade energy bars. They're more nutritious than what my husband used to buy in convenience stores, and he no longer makes fun of granola.

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day, and she loved it. It makes quite a bit. I didn't have a spice grinder, and so left out the flax, which was fine. Also, both my mom and husband said to leave out the ginger next time. It's a great recipe though!

I loved this. I was tired of store-bought granola containing so much sugar and being expensive. My minor ingredients changes: Left out flax seeds (I add raw before eating for more nutrition). Used half almonds, half cashews. Left out sunflower seeds (I'm tired of them). Added two extra pinches of salt. Used olive oil. Used half maple syrup, half honey (I love honey). Cut the amount of ginger in half (and chopped it extremely finely). Used half apricots, half raisins. Added 2 tsp vanilla, some freshly grated cinnamon, and two egg whites (for clumping). My cooking changes: I removed after 10 minutes like one cook suggested, and tossed it in a dry bowl with fruit and ginger. Then I put back in for 10. Then I removed and stirred it in the pan to turn up the not-yet-browned layer. Then I put it back for another 10. Then I stirred it once more and put it back in for a final 5 minutes. Perfect. I am really glad I didn't skip the ginger (next time maybe I'll do the whole amount). Really glad I baked the fruit and ginger in so they were thoroughly incorporated, instead of adding later. Loved the pumpkin seeds. For anyone wondering, this is the "fall apart" kind of granola, not the clumpy kind. The egg whites didn't create the clumping I was hoping for, but at least they add protein.

i made it again. this time i pulled the granola out of the oven after 10 minutes, dumped it back in the bowl and tossed in the fruit. i then put it back in the oven for another 8 minutes. it came out WONDERFULLY. i changed up my fruit additions - i used apricots, dried cherries and raisins. it looked beautiful with the green pumpkin seeds. i will never buy granola again!

this granola would have been fantastic... except by 25 minutes it was burned!! not inedibly so, but it's certainly not disappearing quickly from my fridge. i will try again and begin checking around 18 minutes.

I really enjoy the flavor of this granola. I baked at 275 degrees for 60 minutes which browned it too much. I used 1t. cinnamon and 1t. nutmeg, 2t vanilla. Added dried blueberries after drying. Will make again with apricots.

I made four granolas this week and this was my favorite. The only changes I made were to cook the spricots and ginger into it for 20 minutes, otherwise the apricots are too moist and make the grains less than crunchy, and doubled the sunflower seeds instead of using pumpkin seeds. A lovely blend of flavors.

I'll never make another granola. I eat this by the handful, or sprinkled on fruit salad, hot cereal, and ice cream. I eat it by the bowlful with milk or plain yogurt. I skip the pumpkin seeds and sprinkle on the ground flax later. When flax is heated, the fiber remains intact, but other nutritional benefits are cooked away. I use an organic cold- pressed macadamia nut oil, reduce the oil by 1/4 cup and add a tsp. of vanilla extract, as well as a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Dried cranberries work either with or in lieu of the apricots.

I've been making this for years, adapting it to whatever I have in the kitchen. I try to use organic ingredients, grape seed or olive oil, and I add a bit of unsulfured, unsweetened coconut. I've also added more spice in the past as well, including cardamom, pumpkin pie spice, etc. I sometimes combine nuts: almonds and pistachios or walnuts and have tried dried cranberries and dried cherries as well. It always comes out good and I'm always asked for the recipe.

This is not only one of the best granolas I've ever had but also every time I feed it to anyone they tell me the same. It's also full of highly nutritional ingredients and very filling. Oh and it makes the kitchen smell great when you cook it. I love this granola. :)

This is a nice basic recipe that can be modified to fit whatever you have in the house. I have changed the fruit and nuts to make many different combinations. I typically add golden and regular raisins to every recipe. Have loved this recipe for the past 3 years!

We've been giving this for gifts for a couple years now and everyone loves it. We replace the apricots with cranberries though.

I left out the ginger and sunflower seeds (forgot about them) and I also added raisins. I didn't really care for the taste of the pumpkin seeds though. That was disappointing as I'd been looking forward to trying them in granola. I also used olive oil instead of the vegatable oil. Don't know if that was a bad idea or not. PS: Hydrogenated = Saturated (natural or not).

Tasty dish...but to the cook from Toronto commenting on the oil topic...coconut oil is a naturally saturated fat, thus is never hydrogenated. Vegetable oils are stripped of their characteristic flavors and aromas through chemical and heat processing, making them "no taste" oils, and the ultimate of a refined oil. Coconut oil is much less processed, and a more natural alternative to vegetable oils.

Great recipe, very versatile. But to the (other) cook from Toronto - the vegetable oil in this recipe is not hydrogenated, meaning it has no trans-fats, and because it is vegetable-based it is cholesterol free. So really it is no less healthy than your 'coconut butter' ... (which, in fact, is more likely to have hydrogenated fats than vegetable oil). It's a good idea to understand what you're avoiding - hope this helps.

I loved this recipe because it didn't have any coconut (unlike most other granola recipes). Instead of having coconut which is full of saturated fats, this has flax, which is one of the healthiest things out there. I made it with canola oil and did one cup raisins, one cup apricots like one reviewer suggested.

This is a great recipe. I did make a few alterations: I substituted organic coconut butter instead of the hydroginated vegetable oil (much healthier by the way), and I added dried blueberries to give a little colour and great flavour. I added less of the ginger just because it can be a bit overpowering. I packed in jars for christmas gifts for friends...they look great!

Have made this dozens of times, to rave reviews. My whole household is hooked. I prefer dried cherries, blueberries or cranberries (or all three) in place of the apricots.

Better with only 1 cup of dried apricots and 1 cup of raisins. Better WITH crystallized ginger.

The maple flavor got a little lost when I ate it with plain yogurt, but out of hand or in milk, it's very tasty. I like the green pumpkin seeds in it, but I'm not sure that the flaxseeds contributed much.

Not as sweet as many granolas.
