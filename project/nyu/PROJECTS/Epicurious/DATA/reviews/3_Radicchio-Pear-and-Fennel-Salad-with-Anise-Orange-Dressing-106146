This is a good salad dressing. I had some watercress and romaine around the house, so I used that instead of the greens called for in the recipe. Next time I would use the actual ones called for, they'd probably taste better. I think it might taste good with dried cranberries and almonds too.

For this salad I used one radicchio and about a cup or so of wasabi arugula as the base. I then cored the fennel, removed the fronds, quartered it and proceeded to "peel" slices off it onto the salad. No pear was used this time but I would like to incorporate peeled/sliced pear next time. For the dressing: I used 1/3 cup freshly squeezed navel orange, probably about 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tsp finely chopped anise seed, salt and pepper, combined it in a glass container and shook it. This salad got great reviews.

The key to using fennel in salads at the last minute is to slice it thinly before hand with a mandoline, then put the slices in a quart mason jar with about 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice to refrigerate. At the last minute, drain the fennel slices, pat dry and add to other salad ingredients. I think fennel is a great addition to many salads and have always used it this way. I don't think you have to slice the pears into matchsticks. I just slice them in a way that makes their shape recognizable and place them with the fennel on top of the radicchio (although I used French sorrel which I grow in quantity and is a great substitute).

Must be made immediately prior to serving, otherwise it looks brown and unappetizing. I needed to make it 8 hours ahead for buffet/party. I kept fennel and radicchio and pear all separate and tossed in lemon to reduce browning. However, it still turned a little brown when put together and tossed with dressing about an hour before serving. Flavor is good. I would only use this recipe if I had time to cut and assemble ingredients right before serving.

I also added balsamic to the dressing and chopped a belgian endive with the pears and fennel. It was fantastic, very light and refreshing with great textures. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good crunchy. slightly sweet, and pretty salad. After reading all the reviews I added 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the dressing and used about 1/3 cup olive oil instead of 1/2 cup. Make sure you use fresh squeezed juice instead of the store-bought pasteurized one -with one large orange I had more than enough. Also, because this was for a potluck dinner and a fair amount of time passed in between slicing everything and adding the dressing, I tossed the vegetables and pear with the juice of 1 lemon to avoid discoloration, which I'm sure changed the taste a little

I made this salad as part of a complex flavored menu and thought it would be nice as it is relatively simple and a bit sweet (the rest of the dinner was very savory). I didn't expect it to be all that good but I thought it was delicious. Delicate and crunchy with a really nice taste. Make sure you slice the fennel really thin, and you certainly don't need all the oil in the dressing. Just taste it as you are adding it. It might be a little thin, but the flavor will be good.

Try adding other citrus juices, such as grapefruit, lemon or lime. Even other types of oranges could give you a better flavour. But I agree with the less oil idea.

I wish I had seen the reviews before making this salad from a back issue of Gourmet. The dressing was too sweet for me- I would omit the sugar next time and add garlic. Yet, I found it too bland. The ingredients are nice, but I would make a different dressing, perhaps omitting the OJ altogether.

This is an excellent salad. Easy to make and bright and colorful. The flavors just sing of Italy. It is crisp and refreshing; I plan to make it a lot all summer. I found the pear quite a lovely complement to the more bitter greens. Orange segments would be a nice variation. I followed the recipe exactly except I did omit the sugar (I don't find it is needed at all). I used a good peppery Tuscan olive oil and I dressed each serving individually. Perhaps that's why I did not find it too oily?

YUK! The salad ingredients weren't compatible and the dressing was blahhh. Don't bother.

The salad was good but the dressing was not as refreshing or crisp as I expected it to be. It was a little heavier than it needed to be- too oily. Because it was too oily, the dressing tasted bland- I would modify the dressing using less oil, adding more salt and maybe a touch of garlic.
