Fantastic. We have made this many times. We leave out the lemon zest...no need for it. It actually tastes better to us with out the lemon. You can even leave out the prosciutto if you don't have any...it's fabulous that way, too.

Easy and outstanding. I followed the recipe to a T except for halving the quantity. Super easy to make, but it did take longer than the recipe said (which seems to always be the case for me w/ risottos). I was a little heavy handed w/ the lemon zest, but I loved it that way, really brightened the flavor. Can't wait to make again!

My new boyfriend is prone to kidney stones so I've been trying to figure out recipes that are relatively healthful, taste good even the next day, and have a low oxalate content. I made this without the lemon zest or the parsley (both high in oxalate) and with double the peas (it is hard to get vegetables when you are avoiding oxalate). It was very tasty. It is also a good recipe to make with someone since you can do all the other stuff and have them do the mindless stirring.

Easy and tasty recipe. This was the primi for my dinner partly last weekend and think it would work well with a variety of menus. The freshness of the lemon zest and parsley provided a nice balance in combination with the saltiness of the cheese and prosciutto.

Yum! It takes the time that risotto does but has great results. I didn't have risotto rice on hand, and ended up using sushi rice and that worked fine. Delicious!

I made this one afternoon when I had not much more than some arborio rice, parmesan cheese, and frozen peas in my kitchen. I did have to make a few substitutions. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock and I used 4 slices of bacon I cooked up in the microwave and then chopped up and stirred in instead of the prosciutto. I found this easy to make and very tasty. I also just used a few teaspoons of lemon juice instead if the zest. I would definitely make this dish again!

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half, but ended up using more than the 2 1/2 cups of broth. I used fresh peas from the farmers market. It was creamy and flavorful. The prosciutto gave it a bit of a salty taste, but not overpowering and was off set by the Parmigiano flavor. I would definitely make again.

Overall I liked this recipe, but if I make it again, I will definitely leave out the lemon zest because all I could taste was lemon. No one else had this problem, so maybe I'm just very sensitive to lemon, but I found it overwhelming when the dish was hot (the lemon wasn't as pronounced when eaten cold). Perhaps a few drops of juice would have had the intended effect of balancing the dish, rather than overwhelming all of the other flavors. In any case, I would like to mention that, as with all Italian cooking, it is essential that all of your ingredients be of the highest quality--if your stock, parmesan, prosciutto, etc., are not excellent then the dish will be bland. Also--risotto takes time. The whole reason that the dish is so wonderful when properly made is that a lot of time and concentrated effort went in to making it. Every time that I read a risotto review on this site, someone complains about the time involved. If you don't want to invest the time, then make another rice dish!

this recipe is fantastic! the prosciutto really adds to it. i made it almost exactly, except i ran out of chicken broth so i used more white wine (about a cup), i left out the lemon zest and parsely because i didn't have any on hand, and i didn't use any of the cheese (i'm allergic to dairy; i also substituted dairy free margarine for the butter). fantastic. my boyfriend couldn't stop eating it.

I have made this twice now and both times I have been less than pleased with it. The flavor is boring, to say the least. I did add some cream at the end, increased the wine, the parsley and added a bit of garlic as well-- this was AFTER I had tasted it as written. There are other risotto recipes (all of them easy) that have more flavor. I think for a basic recipe that you could modify, this is fine. If you are looking for something special, look elsewhere.

This was ok but not great. Took WAY longer than the hopeful 18 or minutes. I used up all the broth and still the rice had a bit too much bite for my choice. I used low-sodium broth and unsalted butter and unlike a lot of other reviews, found the finished dish a bit bland. A squeeze of lemon juice and some more salt brightened things up.

Rating: 3
This is a really good basic risotto that is excellent served with fish. I don't stir constantly after the addition of broth - I stir once after each addition - this way the risotto doesn't get mushy. I definitely like the addition of butter at the end - gives the risotto a nice richness!

Rating: 3
We made this the other nite and thought it was pretty good for a last minute meal. It did take longer and needed more broth. And, I can't believe I'm saying this, but it doesn't need as much cheese. It gets sticky. I'd reduce the amount and probably not add the butter at the end.

This dish was great. I made it for 4 of us and we all raved about it. I'll make it again, soon.

Rating: 3
oh, and something else I forget to mention. You really don't need a whole cup of parmesan. I've found that too much makes the risotto very sticky.

To the cook from CA, It is imperative that you constantly stir the risotto to prevent it from getting mushy, thick, and hard to swallow. Stirring constantly also increases the amount of liquid you will need, thus adding more flavor. Also make SURE you don't over cook the rice, I always take the pan off of the heat when the rice still has a slight crunchy texture. I have also noticed that if you don't eat risotto right away, it becomes a very nasty clumpy mess. If you are like me, and prefer your risotto a little looser,(I couldn't come up with a more pleasant word)stop cooking the rice before all of the stock is absorbed. I confess I haven't made this EXACT recipe but I have made one up that is very similar. I prefer shallots to onion and add about 1/3 cup of heavy cream or half and half to the rice after it's done.

Although I enjoyed the flavors of this recipe, I didn't really care for the texture. It was so thick, it was sometimes hard to swallow. But I did love that subtle lemon flavor in there. I think I might like to make this recipe using all the same ingredients, but with regular rice.

This was a great recipe if you're looking for something simple and light. I cut the recipe in half and it turned out excellent! I did use more than half of the recommended broth and did not add extra salt as the proscuitto is salty enough.

Delicious and easy to make. Even my kids liked it.

Made this tonight, and it was easy and great. I cut it in half, and the proportions worked fine. I tinkered a little -- added some diced crisp/tender asparagus along with the peas, and instead of lemon zest, I used diced preserved lemon, and put in about half of it about five minutes from the end of cooking, which made the risotto very lemony. Maybe the people complaining of saltiness used stock with too much salt and not the best proscuitto, because mine had no such issues.

I've made a lot of risotto and this one is very good and easy. the combination of lemon and peas give it a very fresh taste. It works better as side dish than a main course. I use a tbls of fresh rosemarry and add it half way through cooking and I omit the parsley.

Rating: 3
This was a good dish. Be sure to use the low sodium broth because I used regular and it came out a bit too salty. Also definitely use a good wine - the next day for leftovers you can really taste it in the rice and if it's a so-so wine, it won't be as good. The peas are great, but next time I might add wild mushrooms to make it a little less boring. I also used less broth than the recipe called for.

Rating: 3
I love this risotto. The lemon is wonderfully understated and I've never found it to be too salty. Since the recipe only contains a few ingredients, though, you've got to use the very best parm and prosciutto. It's well worth it. I make it as a main course with a salad or as a side dish for filets.

Rating: 2
This just failed to excite. Nothing interesting, nothing special. A one-note dish.

I didn't have the prosciutto so I put in chopped mushrooms instead. I thought this was a good solid recipe. I like that I can add new versions to it easily. I forgot to heat the stock separatly but it didn't seem to matter with the end result.

I made this dish last night, and didn't adjust the recipe. It was wonderful; between 3 and 4 forks. The lemon zest adds a gorgeous but quiet zip of flavor. I agree with previous reviewers - you could really mess this one up using Kraft grated cheese rather than grating your own fresh parm-reg. Also, a tip: if you're making this for the first time - like I was - you're up a creek unless you have everything chopped, thawed and ready before you start; you'll be busy stirring for 20 minutes solid once you start. Worth the effort though!

Rating: 3
Yum! First time making it and I will make it again. It was a bit salty so next time will use the low-salt ingreds where I can and not add more salt. I used LESS broth that was called for so I guess it depends on the 'simmer' level you use. Very tasty and so many possibilities!

Delicious! I made this with mushrooms and peas and it turned out great!

Almost 4 forks! This was absolutely delicious risotto. I required more broth than the recipe called for, not sure why, I make risotto a lot. Would not change a thing - but be SURE to use prosciutto and the best possible cheese.

Rating: 3
Mmmm! Very tasty! I made this with purple sticky rice (to make it spoooooky for a Halloween luncheon) and though it LOOKED horrid, the flavor was lovely. It did need more liquid than written to make it a pleasant al dente, but if you taste as you go, you'll know and can adjust. I omitted the lemon zest by accident, but the dish didn't seem to suffer too much for it. Next time I'll use traditional arborio rice and add the zest, since other reviewers raved so much about it!

I've made this dish twice and I love it. You can use ham instead of prosciutto, but its fantastic with proscuitto if you've got it.

This receipe was good - a solid good. I would make it again. Two points - it took about 25 minutes and less than all the broth to get the rice to aldente (not a big deal); and the flavor was somewhat understated (also not a huge deal). There are several things that could have caused the flavor problem: 1) used too little salt and pepper to season and 2) I might want to boost the lemon zest, parsley, prochutto, a bit more than was called for. Will try this next time I make it.

This was my first time making risotto and I must say I was very pleased with the outcome. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this at all too salty (I used reduced sodium broth) and found no need for additional salt at the end--it came out perfect! The parmesean really added great flavor. I will definite make this again.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was delicious, although my boyfriend thought it was way too salty. I even used unsalted butter and low sodium stock. I would make this again (just not for him). One gripe would be...it took a lot longer than 18-20 minutes to make.

Rating: 3
This dish has become a regular in the repetoire at our house. Low sodium broth and no-salt butter help with the saltiness. I actually make it with pancetta instead of the proscuitto- that was a goof from the first time I made, I couldn't remember which I had in the fridge! But it worked well. It's also great without pancetta or proscuitto.

I love risotto but for some reason rarely make it at home. I was running late on dinner, read this recipe, had all the ingredients on hand, so happlily stumbled on a definate keeper. As some other cooks said, it took more broth, and I cooked it slower and longer, which I think helps in the creaminess. For the cooks who thought it too salty--remember that prosciutto is salty, so do use the unsalted butter and the low sodium broth. I like my food well-seasoned, so added coarse ground pepper, but didn't think it needed any added salt. Making it again next week as a side dish with seared scallops.

I really like risotto, and have tried many recipes, but this one is really salty, with not much flavor.

The prosciutto and peas work well together. I've almost never met a risotto I didn't like, but I would make this again. I tried the shortcut of 6 minutes in the pressure cooker instead of 20-30 min. in the skillet, and the texture was still superb. Add the peas and prosciutto after you open it up of course.

Liked the dish alot, may try making it again and substituting pancetta for the prosciutto to get extra saltiness.

Followed the recipe exactly as it is written and was very impressed with the results. Will definitely make this dish again!

super-yum! one of the best risotto dishes I have had - don't be fooled by the three fork rating, I rarely rate a dish beyond compare. If you're looking to cut back fat, you can easily use 2 T of butter & 1/2 cup of cheese & no one would be the wiser. sauteed some shrimp in garlic & oil & your dish is complete. i did not use all the broth, but after making risotto for five years I have finally learned a low simmer gives me the best consistency- and allowed me to chop the proscuitto, zest the lemon, etc. while the dish was cooking

Excellent risotto. I've made it exactly per the recipe, and also have made it with the addition of prawns or sea scallops for a main dish. My family loves it!

wonderful...would make again. Slowed the cooking time down--I feel it makes it creamier.

Very good - but I also needed extra broth to make the recipe work. In addition I left out the final two tablespoons of butter (by accident actually!) and found the dish to be sufficiently rich without it.

Rating: 3
A very good risotto and with minor modifications will be hailed an excellent risotto. Not enough liquid to finish risotto and bring it to desired tenderness, add extra cup of broth to reserve liquid. Cook at least 7 to 8 extra minutes, total time 25 minutes. The lemon is key in balancing the flavors do not skip. Overall it earned many compliments from various dinner guests. I used it as a side dish for steak.

This recipe had nice flavor. The only difficulty was getting the risotto to come out tender rather than crunchy! The liquid ran out before the risotto was cooked through. I added a little water to avoid burning and to extend the cooking process. This was my first time cooking risotto, so I am sure practice will make this dish more perfect. Despite my problems, this dish was very tasty!

This dish is fantastic! I'm a bachelor and normally only have a bottle of booze and a box of Arm & Hammer Baking Soda in my fridge. This was easy to prepare, and even easier to make. The contrast of flavors between the prosciutto and lemon zest is fantastic. Try to avoid using too much salt in this one.

Very tastey- not really a main dish, more like a side dish. That said, the compliments came from the subtle citrus taste after biting into some peas and procuitto.

This was also much better than I thought it would be. Delicious. Very easy to make. It was my first risotto as well. I think I may have usurped my wife's claim on making the best risotto in the family.

This was even better than I thought it would be. I never made risotto before, so it took me a while to find the correct type of rice in the supermarket. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I would definitely recommend making sure you get parsley and not cilantro...(though I love cilantro, I think the parsley is perfect in this combination).

Rating: 0
To Erin: Flat-leaf parsley and cilantro look exactly the same, but they are two completely different herbs. Cilantro is sometimes labeled as Chinese parsley. The flavors are as different as night and day. You should definitely try this risotto again with proper parsley as it will be an entirely different experience.

Rating: 4
I had never made risotta before & was a little intimidated by it, but this recipe was pretty easy to follow - just required you to stir for a good bit! AND, so delicious! The lemon zest & broad leaf parsley (is that cilantro? That is what I ended up using) gave it a little extra kick - I found I didn't need to add any salt or extra parmesan when I served it. Excellent, Erin
