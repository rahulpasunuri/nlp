I don't know what I was expecting this to turn out as. The one thing I'm sure of is that I wasn't ready for a cross between a gelatin and a pudding. It's really interesting. I'm certainly not one to make negative judgements about foreign dishes, especially those that are beloved by their creators. I'm appreciative of the opportunity to try it out and the instructions were certainly very helpful in that regard. As to the final product...I think my main concern is finding an audience that will truly enjoy it, as it is so far outside the norm of American "desserts".
