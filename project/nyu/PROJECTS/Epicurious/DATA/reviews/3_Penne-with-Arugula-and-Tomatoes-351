There was something off about this recipe. I followed the directions exactly and my husband said it tasted like pine sol. I won't be making this again.

I used whole wheat pasta. I didn't love this dish, but found it to be quick, easy, and healthy - and a great way to use the arugula I have growing in my garden.

Simple, healthy and quick. A great weeknight dinner and a good way to use winter greens!

Great simple pasta dish. I was out of oregano, so I substituted basil instead. There was a fabulous balance of flavors.

This recipe is a good start but could benefit from some chopped green olives or crumbled spicy sausage. I love the thyme in it though... mmm.

This was a huge hit with my husband. I followed others' suggestions to add hot sausage; I also threw in some leftover chicken, as well as capers. If I didn't use hot sausage, I would have tossed in some crushed red pepper. For a hearty weeknight meal that I didn't want to spend a lot of money or time on, it's brilliant.

I would make this again -- but much jazzed up. Maybe double the arugula and garlic.

Didn't like this at all. Too much onion for the amount of tomatoes given the quick cooking time. The arugula lost most of its flavor and became green lumps in the sauce.

This was delicious, easy and healthy. Made as written. I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for salt. I love salt but didn't add any. Used heirloom tomatoes, fresh herbs, sweet white onion. I loved it. It tasted like summer!

This recipe was good, low in fat, high on flavour. It wasn't a 4-forker though...it needs an extra 'something.' The flavour of the arugula is really nice when wilted, and I don't need much excuse to eat tomatoes, but something with some spice or salt (or both) would help this out...maybe capers, or olives, some crushed red pepper, or even something meaty. Maybe next time I will make this with some spicy Italian sausage. Definitely would make it again though.

My husband and I picked this together. It is an outstanding recipe. The only change we made was to add the arugula to the sauce, not to the boiling water so that it wouldn't be watery. Romano cheese is a must. We'll make this many times over the summer when ripe tomatoes are even better!

Yummy! Arugula is surprisingly mild cooked. My husband (who doesn't like all types of greens) loved it too. I doubled the arugula, and could have added even more. I used fresh herbs rather than dried, parmesan instead of romano, and omitted the sugar.

I made this dish as a side pasta for a tomato based chicken dish and it was fantastic. Everyone loved it

Why don't arugula and pasta pair up in more recipes? This is a very good, healthy, easy weeknight dinner. I doubled the amount of arugula and garlic and added red pepper flakes.

What an easy recipe! And it not only tastes great hot off the stove, but it is just as tasty out of the fridge the next day.

i added basil and i did not have pecorino so i used parmesan, really easy and good, great for weekends.
