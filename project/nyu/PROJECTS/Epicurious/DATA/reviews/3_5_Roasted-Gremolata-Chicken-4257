This didn't do it for me. The gremolata just sat on the chicken and didn't seem to be part of it.

This was such a great recipe! The chicken was so moist and tender, while the topping added an extra kick of flavor. I marinated overnight in a Ziploc bag, as suggested by another cook. I didn't have any fresh Rosemary, so I halved the quantity and used dry. Will defiantly make this recipe again and again!

This was a delicious and quick dinner. I used pieces (breasts and legs) instead of the halved chicken and only started marinating it in the morning. This did not seem to adversely affect the final result. I did use the baking sheet and skillet as suggested-- it was no trouble and kept the flavor really in the chicken. Served with tian of tomatoes and zucchini. Will be making many times again.

I have made this twice and it is delicious!! It's not just a family dish (as suggested in the article) but one good enough for company. The gremolata sprinkled on top at the end makes it look and taste great! Both times I used chicken pieces (whole legs and breasts) and not halved chicken; I also did not put a baking sheet on top but roasted it the regular way in the pan. I also marinated it overnight in a zipped plastic bag, which I turned periodically. I believe the results were equally delicious to the original method.

Fabuloso - guests and our children have enjoyed time and again (estimate 12 times since 1997). Polenta and green veges are a great compliment. Ask your butcher to halve the chickens - it saves much time and mess.
