I have made this salsa three or four times now. I serve it over grilled salmon with brown rice and salad. It is fabulous! I add a diced jalepeno and diced jicama.

We really like this salsa also. Sometimes salsa recipes such as this have so many good ingredients in them that flavors get lost. This is simple and good, featuring the combined ingredients very well. Last night we enjoyed it with grilled pork tenderloin.

A delicious salsa. Goes perfectly with the seared rosemary scallops.

This is a great summer side dish served when grilling. Quick, simple, and gets good reviews from adults and kids alike.
