What nonsense. Boil enough broth for two bowls of soup. When simmering add one beaten egg and whisk vigorously. Add also some parmagiano reggiano cheese and mix well. Cool until it won't burn your tongue and serve.

this is a disappointing deviation from the traditional recipe- stracciatella is not stracciatella without the parmesan!

My husband keeps asking me to make spinach egg drop soup. Used a good bit of lime zest instead of lemon, to really good effect. Freezes very well.

WOW! everyone I've served this soup to loved it. I added alot more fresh coarsely shredded spinach and more broth than the reciped called for. Very refreshing.

This seemed self-consciously spa-ish, and I found that the cornstarch gave it an oddly slick - rather than velvety - feel. Neither my husband nor I finished it.
