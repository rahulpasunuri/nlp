I had to substitute green onion for leek but otherwise followed the recipe. Quite a mellow, complex flavor. Meyer lemon juice worked well.

Simple recipe, intriguing flavors. I let it marinade overnight. The amount of onions was just right, I used a sweet variety. I've tried this with scallops and firm white fish, all very good. My go to crowd pleaser.

This is now my go to dish for guests. Depending on the taste of my guests I adjust the onion and chiles. Always a party hit!

I tripled the chilis, and although good, a regular ceviche is better.

this is a great recipe.. i don't understand the comment about the onion breath...this was mild in flavor, and we certainly expected it to be oniony but it wasn't...we love both this recipe and the shrimp in escabeche also on this website...LOVE this recipe!

All we could taste was onion. This is an expensive dish to make. It was too bad it wasn't enjoyable.I wouldn't serve to guests or take to work because of ONION BREATH. The cup of shallots should have been a warning.

To callen3434. Honey picks up the flavor of what the bees pollinate. A mild tasting honey like clover would work, and clover honey is the widest available.

Great recipe. Mild honey would be something like fireweed honey. Honey that isn't overly dark in color is usually milder in flavor. This can be served cold or warm. Great with brown rice.

What is "mild" honey, and where can it be found?

Remarkably delicious. 8 hours marinating was certainly enough.

The Charmoula differs from the excellent recipe for lamb chops charmoula first published in Gourmet in the summer of 1999 (Ruth Reichl's first issue as editor). There are markedly fewer ground spices and a much larger quantity of aromatics - shallots and serranno pepper. Missing was ground coriander, which is a key to the lamb recipe. I didn't notice at first that the shrimp is marinated after being cooked, not before. It's actually a better approach for shrimp, as is grilling the shrimp instead of the instruction to boil it. So I just tossed the shrimp in oil, S&P, skewered them and grilled briefly. They were then tossed in the marinade. While we ate them within an hour (room temp), leftovers improved greatly after sitting overnight. Very positive results. This recipe can probably withstand a fair amount of fiddling with ingredient proportions and choices based on what you have on hand.

Did you serve this cold or at room temperature? Thanks!

A wonderful combination of sweet, and spicy flavors. Don't skip out on the smoked paprika. It adds depth to the flavor profile. Despite the long ingredient list, this was a cinch to make.
