It's a very good base recipe. I used it to make an Apple, Golden Carrot, and Rutabaga soup with Smoked Duck and Pork Sausages, and it came out great. My version substitutes apples for the parsnip, substitutes water for stock, adds a bay leaf and a clove of garlic, and uses about a cup of white wine for deglazing throughout the cooking process. Regardless as to any changes I made, I'd suggest doubling it, and planning to add more liquid as it is thick nearly to the point of being porridge and makes roughly 3-4 servings.

The sausage adds a nice twist to an otherwise standard pureed vegetable soup.

I would put this in the category of a comfort food. I also found that it made at least 4 servings. To tell the truth my husband made it and I don't think he followed the recipe exactly, but it was tasty. :)

While I can only imagine the difference 1/2 and 1/2 might have made, I chose to leave it out and the blender gave the thickness it needed. We were suprised at its nice blend of those vegetables and we call it the "root soup". The given title is rather long when I announce "what's for dinner.!!"

This is a delicious soup, but it was quite thick. I thinned it out with some white wine, which I think made it even better. Also it makes more like 4-5 servings rather than 2.

This was quite delicious however, I made a few modifications. I wanted more of a stew, so I cut the vegetables and sausage in half-moon shapes and used my hand-blender to puree only some of the soup (this preserved more texture). I also eliminated the half-and-half (there really is no need for it) and used fresh thyme instead of dried (why you would add dried thyme so late in the preparation, I don't know). Oh yeah, I didn't have any rutabaga, so I increased the amount of parsnip and carrot . . . definitely a keeper.

Very good soup. I used spicy cajun (andouille - or however you spell it) sausage. I also had some parsley roots in the veg. drawer so I put those in as well. I let the guests decide whether they wanted to eat the soup with slices of horseradish cheddar cheese. I did and others did as well. It was good.
