Delicious recipe! I also substituted raspberries for the boysenberries and the lemon and berry flavors complimented each other very nicely. I agree with the cook from Chapel Hill who suggested adding a tad more sugar to the lemon curd. I also added a tiny bit of confectioners sugar to the reserved whipped cream. When I make this again, I also plan to add another layer of raspberry puree. A beautiful and very delicious dessert!

I made this last weekend but deviated. I poured the mousse into a graham cracker crust then froze it. I topped with a few swirls of whipped cream and fresh raspberries. Everyone really loved it - perfect for a hot evening.

Wonderful recipe! Fresh, light tasting, yet smooth and creamy. Also excellent served in dark chocolate dessert cups/tart shells.

I made this recipe when it was first published in '98. I'll tell you how good it is: My nephew remembered if from 9 years ago and asked me to make it for his 18th birthday party. He calls it his favorite dessert ever. I have made MANY different ones throughout the years, yet this one is the one he remembers most. Now that's a great recipe in my book.

This is delicious. I substitute frozen blueberries for the boysenberries. They are easier to find, and blueberries and lemon go very well together.

This is a great recipe. The curd is delicious, and much easier than I thought. I reserved only a little, and folded the rest into 2 cups of cream, whipped as directed. My dishes didn't lend to the parfait-style dessert as they were too shallow, but I did put a puddle of the raspberry puree in the bottom, topped with the mousse, and garnished with just a little dollop of curd with some fresh raspberries and mint. It was such a nice sweet/tart balance, and a wonderful end to a meal.

Great, great recipe. And the 15 people that dove into it demanded I make it again.

Very good. Just made over the weekend as a finale to a standing rib roast dinner. It was the perfect dessert - not too sweet & very refreshing! I had lemon curd left over - will make lemon cupcakes tonight! Will make this recipe again & again. I used frozen raspberries & I even put another layer of puree in the middle - made it very pretty to see the red halfway through!!

This is simply the best dessert there is!!! I use raspberries for the puree and serve it in Martini glasses. I also add a little lemon zest to the curd. All I get from guests are rave reviews, requests for my "secret" recipe and requests for seconds. This is a winner.

I love this recipe. I've made it 3 times so far--it's a great "company" dessert. I made it with blueberries and it worked great. Any yummy berries will work, I think. I do recommend that you taste the mousse and add sugar if necessary. I've found it needs 2 Tablespoons more sugar than the recipe calls for. I served it with extra blueberry sauce at the table. This is a keeper!

Light and elegant. We used the recipe but used limes and made a strawberry mousse. It was most wonderful. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I reserved whipped cream, and then mixed the remainder of the whipped cream with ALL of the curd. If you choose to do limes, I recommend 1-2 drops of green food coloring to make the curd a light green.

Wonderful! I used raspberries in place of the boysenberries. I checked the FDA food safety website, and 160 degrees is sufficient to kill any bacteria present in the eggs.

This recipe has become a crowd pleaser- I do not separate out the lemon curd but combine all of it with a 2 cup carton of whipped cream. I then serve the mousse in a large decorative glass bowl with either the puree at the bottom or in a separte bowl alongside the main bowl. That way, it serves more people and they can help themselves to whatever portion they'd like.

This is a really good recipe - after you put the berry puree in the bottom of the glass make sure you pipe the first layer of mousse right onto the edge of the glass and work your way towards the center to stop the puree creeping up the sides!

This recipe has it all. The fresh, clean taste of lemon and the rich creaminess of the mousse layer. Best of all, it can be made ahead and garnished at the last minute. Don't let the boysenberries throw you. Use raspberries instead. Yum!
