like other reviewers, I used only chicken thighs , caramelized the onions, homade Chix Stk, added garlic (duh) and used combo of spanish/smoke/Hungarian hot Paprika--also used Quatre Espice in leiu of nutmeg cooked in dutch oven in oven for more roasted flavor --will make again!

I like this recipe a lot. However, I like to caramelize the onions over low heat for a good deal longer than 15 minutes. This takes a long time and isn't essential, but it really improves the dish. And I didn't cook the chicken for 30 minutes in the broth. 40 minutes total cooking time for the chicken is insane and would leave it super dry. Also I added a touch of lemon juice at the end.

Very good! Had Vandalia onions and chicken thighs and this recipe sounded good....and so it really was. The Vandalias caramelized nicely and the chicken was moist and tender. We are not fans of either nutmeg or mace so I substituted tarragon and served with roasted garlic potatoes.

I make this dish 4-5x/year, and found some of the previous comments interesting. I usually only make this dish with the leg/thigh cut of chicken. It's too difficult to cook the whole chicken, with breast and limb meat all at once. I cut a notch at the thigh/body joint to make sure this area cooks completely. I agree cooking the whole chicken usually takes more than 30 minutes of simmering. I try to reduce the sauce in the final step as quickly as I can to keep the chicken from getting too cool (reheated chicken I find never tastes "right"). Otherwise, I follow the instrcutions.

I followed the recipe, against my better judgment, to a tee and wished I had used common sense. I wish that I'd have carmelized the onions versus reducing heat covered for 15 minutes. And then cut down on other cooking times as well. It took too long and did not have much flavor. I did use common sense with the chicken breasts and did not cook as long as suggested. They'd have been greatly overcooked had I followed the recipe. This certainly will not be in my rotatation.

A true disappointment. Decided to make this for relatives before they left on a flight -- the timing in the recipe is off by a great deal. Everything took about twice the time. I'd attempt to make it again, giving myself an extra hour or so, but I was so embarrassed in what I had to serve to them for dinner that night. They asked for ketchup before even tasting it. It was my first time cooking for them and I had completely failed whereas I cook other recipes on this site just perfectly every other night of the week. The only helpful thing I can give to anyone from my review is to give yourself extra time because it actually takes longer for things to thicken and/or become tender.

This was an excellent and easy dish. i didn't have any paprika but used a little chili powder instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious! Served this with small dumplings and it was fantastic.

total comfort food. only complaint i had is that when i tried to incorporate the flour/water mixture into the sauce it lumped up on me. I think next time i would add some sauce into the mixture before adding it into the gravy. other than that, no complaints!

I've reviewed this before but I did this with boneless pork loin chops the other night and it might even have been better than with the chicken! The only adjustment I made was in the cooking times. I quickly browned the onions so they wouldn't cook down as much and would have more texture when finished!

A WONDERFUL DISH! ...THE SECRET IS TO USE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF ONIONS (WHITE ARE WONDERFUL) SLICED THE SAME WIDTH ( ABOUT 1/4" ) AND LET THEM SLOW COOK UNTIL THEY ARE A MEDIUM GOLDEN COLOR.... IT TAKES TIME! BUT THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE DISH. WOULD CHANGE NOTHING ELSE.

This is an excellent dish that I've been making since 1993. It is the ultimate in comfort food, and especially tasty in the fall and winter. This one's a winner: flavorful and delicious!

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine--has it really been ten years!?! Everyone I've ever made it for professes to love it. YUM!

I thought this dish was wonderful just as written! I used the mace, it gave just enough flavor! Very yummy! I think a key is to let the onions cook long enough and to sear the chicken well.

This is the ultimate comfort dinner. My husband loved it and kept saying, "This is really good..." I thought it was delicious, as well. I didn't change or add anything for once, and it was quite easy. Making it again tonight, and when I told the husband, he was quite happy....

My boyfriend loved this recipe. I thought it was pretty good, except I think I let th sauce reduce too much, so it was thicker than I would have liked. The nutmeg made it sweet,smelled great while cooking, and the paprika made the chicken a nice color. I will make this again, being careful to make the sauce a little thinner, I think I will omit adding flour. Also, I used skinless boneless chicken breasts, which I cooked a little too long, I should have shortened the recommended cooking time. A little dry, but the sauce made up for that. I served with mashed potatoes and spinach.

I loved this recipe and recieved rave reviews after making it. Paprika and pepper added a little zip and the gravy and onions were perfect with potatoes. I substituted corn starch for the creme and added more onions for taste.

I lost this recipe and was estatic to find it again on Epicurious! This dish is one of my favorites, and I have prepared it again and again. I use half butter and half olive oil for the fat, and I remove the skin from the chicken. I also reduce the sauce somewhat after I remove the chicken and before the thickening is added. This is a perfect country-style family meal with mashed potatos and peas.

This is one of my best chicken recipes and a favorite of my husband. I make this with boneless skinless chicken and I leave out the mace/nutmeg. I think the sauce is fabulous and it is great with mashed potatoes as suggested. One thing about the way this recipe is written, it sounds like it would at take at least an hour to prepare with all the simmering requested in the recipe. With boneless chicken, they are already cooked when you brown the chicken, so it's not necessary to simmer the chicken for 15 minutes and then 30 minutes. 5 or 10 minutes here or there is enough if you want this dinner turned around quicker. Therefore, this recipe can really be done in about half an hour!

A popular dish at my house. Everyone, even my picky kids, love this. I add more nutmeg and onions for extra flavor. Even better the next day.

Given the wonderful reviews, we were disappointed in this recipe. The sauce was not that interesting and didn't have that much flavor. Onions were good. The cream at the end didn't add that much and the sauce would have been good (better if you're on a diet) without. Onions went very well with the mashed potatoes

Absolutely wonderful! I also used the evaporated milk idea, and a non-stick pan to keep the butter to a minimum - on cold winter nights, this is satisfying beyond compare!

This is a true family favorite I have made several times. With two children under 7 finding a recipe both like can be difficult but this one fits the bill. Reminds me of a dish my grandmother made when I was a child.

This recipe was in no way disappointing to my family. I've made it several times since the first time I tried it. I submitted this recipe in a culinary school project and got a great grade and terrific reviews from my classmates. At home, I use boneless chicken breasts and add a little garlic. I serve it with mashed potatoes made with garlic and sauteed spinach. Delicious!!!

This was a bit disappointing after reading the other reviews. I found the presentation of the sauce unappealing and the taste bland considering the time involved in preparation. It was good and the chicken was tender, but we all agreed that we would not make it again and that it lacked real character.
