I hate it when people review a recipe but change it all around...that said, I could find neither watercress nor pomegranate so made it with only leaf lettuce and an orange. Still, the dressing & the crunch of the almonds made a terrific salad. I am not usually a fan of lettuce salads but this one is a keeper.

I feel like I could eat this for lunch every day of my life. I adored this simple salad and really does burst with flavor from every bite of pomegranate to the smokiness of the almonds, to the sour-sweet dressing. Am making again this week. Great to divvy out on a Sunday night and just add the dressing right before lunch at my desk.

Loved it,loved,loved it! Brought this salad to a bridal shower where we all contributed to a potluck supper and it disapered in five minutes. Great reviews from the guests.

Delicious! Easy! I used honey instead of sugar.

This is a fantastic salad! Unfortunately, the last time I made it, pomegranates were out of season, so I used avocados and clementines instead and still garnered kudos.

This looks pretty for company and tastes light and delicious. It wasn't pomegranate season, so I substituted cut-up tangerines.

I used romaine because it was all I had and ran out of time to toast the almonds, but it was still SO GOOD! This salad is my new favorite.

I have now made this three times to the delight of family and guests. It is a beautifully balanced salad. I use Trader Joe's dry toasted sliced almonds to save time and add that extra crunch. Depending on the limes you use, the dressing may need a bit more juice.

Simple, light and very good flavor. The pomegranate seeds add a little crunch. I used spring mix salad greens because I had it on hand.

To get the pomegranate seeds out without getting it all over the place, cut in half and dunk the half in a bowl of water. Pry the seeds out with your fingers. The seeds sink, and the white membrane floats, which you can then throw away. I used a lemon instead of a lime, and a bag of mixed greens instead of the lettuce and watercress, and toasted sliced almonds pre-packaged. Easy and delicious!

This was a good recipe. No one was really blown away by it but salad is not usually the focus at Thanksgiving. I liked it and would make it again probably with a few more ingredients to make it a little more interesting. Dressing was great and easy to make.

This recipe was fantastic, I also added a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger root to the dressing.

I made this for a recent holiday dinner. Everyone loved it. It was great and looked beautiful. I made it with romaine lettuce only, slivered almonds and added one more tablespoon of lime juice to the dressing as other reviewers recommended. I had some dressing left over (it made a little more than needed). I'll be making this again.

When this recipe is followed closely, it is absolutely amazing. I made the mistake of making it once without the watercress and another time improvising the dressing and the whole thing fell flat. You really gotta follow the recipe on this one for stellar results.

This salad is da bomb! Seriously, everyone who attended dinner requested the recipe. The taste is second to none.

I've made this salad two years in a row for Thanksgiving with friends and have been requested to make it again this year. I add the dressing to taste, making sure not to drench the leaves. This year I'll be using arugula and spinach instead of watercress and lettuce.

This was a really nice salad. It was the first time for me to eat pomegranate and I didn't know what to expect. I used steamed cauliflower since I did not have watercress but the taste and color went great.

Really liked this salad although I used romaine and red leaf lettuce in place of watercress. Will try watercress the next time. Great dressing- and worth adding more lime juice!

I followed the recipe as written and it turned out AMAZING. I thought that the watercress would be too bitter but it was well-matched with the tangy dressing and sweet crunchy pomegranate seeds. Taste the dressing before you toss it with the salad. If it seems too bland as is, try adding more lime juice. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The pomegranates at the store did not look good, so I substituted tangerine slices. Yum! Now one of my favorite salads for any day of the week.

Wow. I substituted a combination of mango and blueberries for the pomagranate and was it delish. Loved the dressing and will use it on other salads.

the salad was good and tasty but the dressing was bland. Next time I used a poppyseed dressing(homemade) and it was much better.

Made this salad as well as the main dish on this menu but took a short cut with the orange rolls. Used Sister Schubert's but made the orange butter with Smart Balance due to hubby's cholestrol. Fantastic meal!

Excellent with a few modifications. I would use an array of lettuce-use what is fresh and available. I added a small amount of crumbled goat cheese. The dressing is perfect! Had almonds, but substituted toasted pecans. Very light and refreshing. Considering for Thanksgiving.
