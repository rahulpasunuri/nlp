I usually tryout recipes that appeal to me as well as having a high percentage rate of people that would make it again. I am glad I took the chance on this one! With so much zucchini popping out of the garden I am always looking for different ways to use it. This is a crowd pleaser and you can do so much with it by adding your own touches - I added a little dijon to the serving sauce.

I salted and squeezed, since I didn't have an hour to wait. Once I mixed everything together, it seemed dry-I guess I over squeezed-so I added two eggs. Also substituted flour for corn starch, and panfried in a non-stick pan with a lot less oil-very tasty, and the guests liked them too.

Perfect thing to make for a company potluck. Everyone really enjoys them.

I come from Greece and the last 2 years I live in USA. I have some suggestions for this recipe. First, replace the corn starch with flour. Secondly, add one teaspoon of baking powder. Third, if you like a fresher taste add feta cheese and not so much kefalotyri. Finally a little bit of fresh Italian parsley makes them terrific.

I made this recipe for a multi-family gathering and it was a hit, even with the teenagers. Didn't find it too starchy, but I used less corn starch than called for. I would rate this a 3.

Being of Greek descent, I can strongly say that these are nothing like the Kolokythokeftedes that my Yia-Yia would make. In my home in Greece,my family lives there,we make our recipe for these much diffirent and I must say they are better. I would have to agree with the first person who rated these.

I made these as part of a Greek dinner party, and thought they were delicious - but probably not completely worth the effort of deep-frying! I used Pecorino - and they were tasty. Everyone else raved about them!

I thought these fritters were quite tasty, although I admittedly changed an ingredient -- I used goat cheese instead of one of the listed greek cheeses. Otherwise, I don't thing they were too starchy, as one reviewer said.

The fritters were very horrible! When I resd the Recipe,I thought it sounded wrong,and I was right! They tasted like a big starch ball. There must be something wrong with the recipe,because these were amazingly horrible!
