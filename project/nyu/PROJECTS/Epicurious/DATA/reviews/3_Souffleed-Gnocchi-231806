I first made these when that issue of Gourmet magazine came out. I returned to this recipe last night for a nice vegetarian dinner--serving the gnocchi with a mushroom ragoût. I chilled the dough for an hour and it was still too soft to use a cookie cutter. I was able to cut it into large squares with a knife. The taste and texture are great.

Well - I thought I would be writing a different kind of review. After 12 min, the semolina had stiffened right up and I thought all the other reviewers were wrong, but when I added the eggs it really softened and I couldn't cut it even after an hour. So I just put it all in a pan and baked it. I wouldn't repeat this with semolina, but I might try again with polenta and make it even thicker so that it cuts. The crusty edges were the best parts.

I'm not sure if my husband and I did something wrong (although we followed the directions exactly), but this got nowhere near thick enough to cut into pieces. In the spirit of experiment we poured the polenta-like batter into a baking dish and cooked it for the whole 20 minutes without changing racks or turning it. Oh my God, it's so delicious! It's like a cheesy soufflé/Dutch baby. We ate it with roast lamb and a pinot noir sauce. It's wonderful with the sauce, it's wonderful with just lemon juice, it's wonderful with sliced scallions and tomatoes... I agree with other reviewers, it is very rich and dense. It is way too much work to ever make again - a cheese soufflé would have far easier. But given that it seemed like a total disaster before it went in the oven, the results cannot be beat!

I reduced all ingredients by 1/3 to feed two hungry people (we still had leftovers). I skipped the hour-long chill and baked it for 28 minutes without changing oven position, and it came out puffed, golden, and delicious. The prep is a little time-consuming for a weeknight, but it's a recipe worth holding onto! We also made the fennel and carrots mentioned in the romance, and agreed the meal was great.

Yum! Tip: Skip the "cool to touch" step. Spread on sheet, chill 1 hour THEN cut rounds. Much easier to handle. Maybe a little stronger cheese next time (Romano?)

This is a nice side dish -

yes I agree that there is something wrong with the recipe, but I showed that to my grandmother, Italian born, who made some changes and it is really perfect. the quantity for semolina is totaly wrong, should be 1 3/4 cup, instead of 3/4 cup. then the pecipe reads correctly, even when you cook it is very stiff and than when you add eggs and cheese it becoms soft, but chilled is the perfect consistency for cookie cutter... try it and you'll know why it deserves 4 spoons.

This wasn't at all what I thought it would be. The dough was too soft to properly assemble, though it did puff up nicely with cooking. But the taste was more appropriate for breakfast than as a side dish with lamb -- with all those eggs and with the cheese, I could have sworn I was eating a cheese omelet. Feh.

There is something wrong with this recipe. I followed it exactly as written and had the same results as everyone else. The gnocchi "dough" did not solidify to a point where a cookie cutter would even be useful. I expect that next month there will be a correction with the correct recipe.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. The only thing I did wrong was waiting a little too long to serve them as they deflated a bit (but still delicious!) I would also warm the plate first as they are so delicate that they got cold quickly. I agree that they don't cut perfectly with the cookie cutter but that should not deter you from trying it. Try chilling it longer before cutting.

I was nervous after reading the few prior critics. However I have to tell you, if you stir for 15 minutes over heat as instructed, you end up with a thick but runny/wet paste. Place on greased cookie sheet, put in fridge. I left in for an hour, and had NO trouble cutting with cookie cutter and lifting out with flat edge knife into baking dish. Not a problem at all! It actually looked just a pretty as the picture! I used freshly grated cheese, hard to measure so am sure had extra. Then did add extra to topping, couldn't resist! We love a cheesy flavor. Should have read the recipe title...this is a "Souffle!", not the heavy, potato laden gnocci we all know. Was light, airy, and fluffy...totally wonderful and everyone just devoured! Would make a TERRIFIC side to any heavy meat dish!

The flavor of this dish is wonderful. Forget trying the cookie cutter...try an ice cream scoop (the old fashion kind with the thumb release)added extra cheese just because we like cheese. Gave it a 3 fork because the cookie cutter just doesn't work as the recipe calls for.

I made this on Easter Sunday morning and also had a hard time with the cookie cutters and getting it into the pan. I ewnded up just putting it all in a pan and smoothing it with a spatula. I increased the cheese in the recipe to 9 tablespoons and topped it with a bit more. The flavor and consistancy was outstanding. It was absolutely delicious with lamb.

Soft is an understatement. I managed to get mine in the pan by sliding a spatula under the cookie cutter in the dough and basically plopping it in the dish. I hope these taste great, or they're not worth the work.

Has anyone made this ??? I have followed the recipe exactly, and now have a messy goup all over my kitchen.I tried to scoop it into the baking dish using a 2 inch cookie cutter, and they batter dissolved into one big glob....(this after being chilled 20 minutes, and then put in the freezer for 10 minutes...I'm throwing up my hands and will be rosting potatos to go along with the Lamb......I hope it's (the Lamb with Anchovies)better than this fiasco !
