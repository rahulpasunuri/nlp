My advice to Zotz123 is to find better Farfalle--de Cecco is my favorite, since there is no reason for it to be tough in the center . I tried it last night with small Farfalle, or Farfalline and that also works well..

Excellent basic kasha recipe, but serious cooks will have to tweak it: One more onion, a pint of fresh mushrooms, an awful lot of pepper (it's almost impossible to put in too much) and as for the noodles, forget bowties - the "tie" in the middle is tough and detracts from the dish. As Ms. Nathan suggests, any other kind of noodle will do fine. We serve it with a fried egg on top. The taste and texture of the egg and kasha complement each other.

Right aroma, right flavor. Just like Veselka's on the Lower East Side, in NYC. But better!

Just like mom and grandma used to make! Reminds me of childhood! I usually make this with the matzo balls soup recipe from 2nd ave deli. You end up have left over schmaltz solids (Onions and chicken skins) it's good if you add this to the kasha. Oy vey!

I use duck fat and some extra onions. I add chicken stock for the steaming and a little salt and pepper in the kasha. I also salt the water for the pasta. Great dish! It would have reminded me of my mother's cooking, if she had been a good cook. Instead, it reminds me of the great deli's of my youth were I enjoyed this dish.

I agree that this is as close to traditional as it gets. I hated kasha varnishke as a kid...now I love it. Some garlic is a plus. In my opinion, the egg adds to the taste, in addition to keeping the grains from clumping and "gluing" any dust to the grains. Do what you like, but I really believe that the chicken fat is critical to authenticity. The pasta shape is not so important. I always used "varnishkes", but very tiny ones that are now available. Yesterday, being out of "bowties", I used very tiny shells and it was great. Just stirring the mixture, basically, filled the shells as if I stuffed each one. Very tasty and the texture was great...insuring that each mouthful contained both the kasha and the pasta.

Oh, man this took me back! It was just like my grandmother used to make, delicious! The onions really make this dish; I'll probably chop them next time, but we'll definitely have this again soon.

Good recipe however I would add some garlic. It could not hurt. Also I generally use vegetable stock instead of chicken or beef. I have recently come across a pre roasted coarse kasha that is imported from Russia. It allows the avoidance of the egg but I still heat the kashe with the onion. I also add mushrooms and green or red pepper

I'd never made (or even thought about making) Kasha Varnishkes before, but found myself doing it as a special favor to a friend. It received excellent reviews: he loved it, his brother-in-law said it was the best he'd ever tasted, his sister-in-law (who ostensibly hated Kasha Varnishkes) couldn't stop eating it, &c. For the most part, I stuck to the recipe; my most significant departures were chopping (instead of slicing) the onions, and adding chicken fat, salt, margarine, and pepper liberally to taste at the end.

To make this dish to be like my family's version, chop the onions so they aren't stringy, and sautee them with sliced mushrooms. I usually make in advance and reheat with gravy from either brisket or juices from whatever poultry dish I'm making.

My review is only of the kasha part, not the varnishkes. The recipe is excellent, just like the one on the Wolff's box (wonder why). I use olive oil instead of margarine or chicken fat, although I'm sure the chicken fat would taste great. I also top the kasha with the fried onions instead of cooking them along with the kasha. I did notice that I need longer than 10 or 15 minutes till the kasha is fully steamed. However, the taste is great. Those who for some reaon don't want to have the fried onions can try eating their kasha with ketchup or tomato sauce. That's what we did in Russia and it was pretty good!

I never would have thought to add cilantro to this dish, but it works very well, and perks up the old classic.

Yes, this the classic. After 35 years of taking the trouble to seal the buckwheat with egg, I tried instead just dropping whole kernels in boiling water. A little less toasted, but just as fluffy. 7 minutes less work. Excellent microwaved for breakfast with milk and sweetener.

I was worried that without any spices it would be bland, but I was wrong. It was very flavorful. My boyfriend loved it. I added mushrooms, which added some additional flavor and texture.

My family loved this served with ratatouille (stewed zucchini,green & red peppers, mushrooms,onions & tomato).

My mother used to make this and this is the best I have found. It almost tastes exactly like hers. My whole family loved it as I have made it twice and I intend to make it over and over. Thank you very much.

I never made Kasha Varnishkes until I found this recipe. It is a easy recipe and I will continue to prepare it.

I've made this many times over the years. Lately, I tend to saute the onions in a non-stick pan, using only some olive oil spray, instead of margarine, butter, or chicken fat. This makes it vegetarian too, and the flavor is not lacking either. I think the very small bow ties work best. Total comfort food!

Great recipe, just like grandma used to make! My Italian husband loved it!
