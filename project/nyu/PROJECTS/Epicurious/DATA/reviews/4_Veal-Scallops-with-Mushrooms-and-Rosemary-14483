This was one of the easiest recipes I have EVER made, and definitely one of the most delicious. I only had two pieces of veal to cook, but we managed to eat all of the sauce with no problem at all. It was especially good served over brown rice. If I were to make this for more people, I would probably double the sauce recipe. Overall, this was a simple recipe that tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen. I will definitely make this again.

This was a good dish. I made it with chicken, and suggest you pound it thin. I dusted the chicken with season salt mixture and Italian herb before cooking them. Also, the butter mixture that you cook the mushrooms in is best to reserve to use to cook the chicken/veal in with EVOO.

We have made this dish many times. Its easy, quick and wonderfully flavorful. Its great when substituting with Chicken as well. Recomend serving it over Near East Original Rice Pilaf. The sauce is great. Definately a a dinner to think of when its cold and rainy outside, and you are inside in front of the warm fire...... Yummy! You wont be disappointed.

This dish is absolutely delicious. I made it over fettucine and added some freshly grated parm cheese on top - wonderful. Easy, quick and very satisfying. I would recommend using chicken breasts (this is what I made it with - just increase the cooking time) and add one cup of heavy cream and reduce it down to a cream sauce. Try it, you will not be disappointed :)

I made this dish for my husband as I do not like veal...he loved it! I tasted the mushroom sauce (yummy)and will try it with chicken breasts next time. This is a wonderful meal to serve at a dinner party.

I *loved* this recipe. I used vermouth rather than wine because it's what I had on hand, plus added about a 1/4 lb of crumbled blue cheese at the very end of the cooking time for the sauce. It thickened it nicely and gave it an extra kick. I used the veal and mushroom sauce to top angel hair pasta and broccoli rabe sauteed in olive oil and garlic. Even my daughter enjoyed it, and she is not a meat eater. Next time, I will add shallots and double the mushrooms and sauce if I serve it with pasta. There were NO leftovers!

A really great recipe! Used pork tenderloin thinly sliced on the diagonal instead of veal scallops. Sauce is awesome, and since I added some more wine, had to thicken it a bit with a little flour & cream. The sauce will also be wonderful with chicken breasts. Leftovers were fantastic the next day.

This recipe is so easy and SO good. This is easily one of the best recipes I have found on this website. I wouldn't change a thing. I like to serve it with the orzo & mushrooms recipe also on this site, or with a mushroom risotto.

This dish is delicious. I added shallots and increased the wine. The veal needed to cook a little bit longer, even though I pounded it down. I will make this again.

Outstanding in every way! Easy to prepare while talking with guests in the kitchen, aromatic, and oh so delicious. No need to change a thing. A side of wild rice blend goes well with this dish.
