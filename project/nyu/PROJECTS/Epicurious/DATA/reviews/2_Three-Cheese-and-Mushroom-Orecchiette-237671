I thought this was very good. I added baby aspargus cut into 3" pieces. I paried it with a granny smith waldorf salad, and they complemented each other very well.

Nothing special. The sauce was not flavorful. The macaroni and blue cheese recipe on this site is a million times better!

My husband loved this and wants me to make it again. I thought it was good, but not great. On the plus side, it was super easy to make. The blue cheese seems to add the most flavor.

Tasted like a tuna noodle casserole.

This was very good! I doubled the sauce by doubling the cheeses, heavy cream, and reserved cooking liquid and I doubled the amount of peas and added about 2 cups of cooked cubed chicken. Mushrooms took longer than 4 minutes to cook, more like 8-10. Overall a very tasty, very rich dish, perfect for cheese lovers.
