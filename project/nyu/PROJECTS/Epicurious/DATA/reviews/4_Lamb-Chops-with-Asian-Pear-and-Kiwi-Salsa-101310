This recipe was fast and delicious! I could not find ripe Kiwi,so I omitted. I also used a very tiny bit of diced red onion instead of green. My whole family loved it. I served with green beans and wild basmati rice. Will add to rotation for sure

this review is for the fruit salsa only - i used two asian pears peeled and chopped into larger bite size chunks, 2 kiwis peeled and sliced - 1T lemon juice, 2T honey, 1t fresh mint - couple turns of seasalt/peppper -served as a fruit cup along side curry chicken with sweet potatoes from this site - it is a perfect pairing and delicious, we even drank the juice at the bottom of our cups - thx to other reviewers on the site - this is a keeper ...

Fantastic salsa. I omitted the honey since we don't like terribly sweet things and I also omitted the onion just because I didn't have any. I used fresh cranberries which were a perfect tart influence.

Absolutely superb! Salsa was terrific! Barb loved it. Lamb was tender and juicy with the temp and broiling times listed. Every day of the year, my local Von's has Asian pears. But guess what. Today no dice. Had to use domestic pears, but it was great anyway.

Very nice and flavorful. I am not a great cook, but this turned out yummy. I was surprised. It seemed like and odd combination of falvors.

This review is for the Salsa; it was delicious... replaced honey with Splenda and served it with Duka + Za'tar crusted lamb chops... it was a winner!

Used leg of lamb which we cut into cubes and put onto skewers to grill/broil. Marinated for 24 hours using other Asian Lamb recipe on epicurious as the other person suggested - the marinade had 5-spice powder in it. Used dried cranberries and red and green pears (which we did not peel). Great for Christmas party buffet!

I made the salsa (and added dried cranberries for color) and provided as a condiment with festive turkey dinner. Great flavor, color and texture for thanksgiving dinner.

This review is for the salsa only, which we thought was wonderful. Made that exactly as written, except for adding a little less green onions than called for. We made the chops using the Grilled Lamb Chops With Asian Butter Sauce recipe, also on Epicurious, which was a great combination!

Prepared this for a party of ten: a big hit. The salsa is wonderfull. Not everybody was fond of lamb so I also prepared chicken breasts (stuffed with proscuitto) using the same seasoning & prep as the lamb. Will certainly cook this again.

Sorry, Missy. I love this recipe. I've been making this dish since I recevied the issue in the mail. I have made it for family and friends. All love it and have asked for the recipe. The salsa is fantastic! It is easy to prepare. The only drawback being the cost of the lamb.
