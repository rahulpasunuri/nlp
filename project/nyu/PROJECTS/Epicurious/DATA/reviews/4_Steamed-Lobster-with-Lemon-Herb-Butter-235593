This was an absolute WOW recipe with bread and Chardonnay! The blend of lemon (we used Meyer lemons) and fresh herbs in the butter is just fantastic with the lobster. We steamed the lobster in salt water (1T salt to 1 qt water). 15 min was perfect for a 2 lb lobster. Make extra butter to dip crusty bread in, too!

I lobster dive in So Cal and enjoy it FREE and with a great bottle of Chardonnay. This recipe is a darn good one. Also "California Spiny Lobster" has a sweeter flesh than Maine lobster.

why is this called "steamed" when it is in fact boiled?

Just had to add a "West Coast" note now that I've read all of yours. Made this just like the recipe and loved it. But, everyone knows that lobsters are served with a baked potato and rice!

What a pleasure to find a recipe that respects the delicate, unique flavor of lobster instead of overpowering it! As for white wine and cole slaw vs. onion rings and beer? I grew up in Maine and believe BOTH are wonderful and appropriate! BTW... this butter is incredible with the steamers!!!!

At last, a great butter diiping sauce!!We used this melted butter with steamed spiney lobsters, prawns, and sea snails, it held its own with the horseradish catsup and curried mayonaise. Definately a repeater, even sent the recipe to my AK daughter , who used it with halibut.

I see, you live near Maine so the only way to have lobster is with steamers, onion rings, and cold beer? I thought this recipe was delicious and it was a pleasant change from the "ordinary" as some of us like to venture out of the "shell" no pun intended, well maybe a little pun..

Bread and wine with steamed lobster?? Are ya nuts?? The real way to enjoy steamed lobster is with steamers, some nice cornmeal batter dipped onion rings, potato salad and frosty cold beer!! :)
