I also have been making a variation of this for years since it was first published. This recipe is a big hit during the holidays. We prefer it less fruity, so this year I added only 1 cup of cherries. I used 1 cup of wild rice and 1 cup of regular, and I cook them separate as to not worry about getting the water ratios just right. Use dried thyme if you have to and sliced onions. Trader Joe's sells a nice bag of frozen pearl onions that brown nicely if they are allowed to thaw, and also pecans that are already toasted. Be liberal with the sea salt and freshly cracked pepper. This is a dish that does well if you make it one day and heat it the next. Fabulous!

I have been making this Wild Rice Stuffing recipe for years and I will be making it for Thanksgiving this year (2012). A nice alternative to potatoes and works equally well will fowl or pork. I especially like it with a crown roast of pork. Make as recipe directs or improvise with what you like or have on hand. A few chopped, fresh herbs are pleasant as is a squirt of fresh orange juice when it comes out of the oven to brighten the flavors.

I made this to go with our duck we roasted for Christmas. Wonderful. Did tweek it a bit. Wanted a more citrus taste, added the zest of an orange and the juice of 1/2 the orange. Also realized the only spice called for is thyme and added a pince of paultry seasoning and used golden raisins and walnuts (what we had on hand). Delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was great. I made the rice a day ahead. Then mixed in the dried fruit, pecans, and a bit of extra chicken stock and baked in a glass pan with some pats of butter. Tasty, lighter than most stuffings, well liked by all, and really easy to make. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for xmas eve dinner with friends and it was a solid dish but not exceptional. That said I would make it again but might experiment with adding more herbs next time. I used brown basmati and candied pecans and wished I'd added more thyme.

Easy and incredibly delicious. I made it as written. Was afraid all the fruit, esp. the apricots, would overwhelm, but they didn't. A big favorite of everyone at the table. Will definitely make again. I blanched the pearl onions for 2 min and then put in ice water bath before peeling. Peeling was easy

Delicious... Phenomenal flavor and texture... I used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth and Lundberg Wild rice blend. On our Thanksgiving table for the third year.. A new staple.. Gluten free.. and vegetarian..

This was awesome. I had left over wild rice, so I can't speak to that part of the recipe. It was great w/o the addition of the white rice. I used cranberries instead of cherries, since that's what I have. I used sultanas (yellow raisins) for color. I used frozen pearl onions, per a previous reviewer, for ease. It was a total hit. If you are using leftover rice, the yield would be 7.5 cups cooked rice. I'll definitely make this again, perhaps even for Thanksgiving.

This is a regular at our Thanksgiving dinner. If I don't have cherries, I use dried cranberries. We usually skip the apricots. When pearl onions are not in the budget, I have used rough chopped yellow onions. Perfect with gravy or cranberry sauce on top!

Checking the time to make this, I saw 63 minutes. If you are cooking a special meal--that is no time. Especially is you have other things to cook. Most of it is untended. I have added toasted pine nuts. Also--can be prepared & cooked ahead. Even frozen. And just reheated. How easy is that?

This ia soooo good! I use frozen pearl onions. Much easier. It freezes well. Goes so well with cornish hens--as previously stated. Also pork, chicken--just great. Wish you could ask my guests--they loved it!

I made this to go with the Roasted Orange-Herb Game Hen(from this site). Perfect combination according to guests. Son-in-law said he prefers my usual wild rice Thanksgiving dish--just because.

Everyone loves this - I make it w/o the onions and depending on availability of dried cherries (without added sugar) , I substitute dried cranberries. I also add another 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth.

Absolutely delicious. Made this for my first gluten-free Thanksgiving, and it was amazing. I actually thought it was better than bread stuffing, and everyone loved it. Even those who don't have to avoid gluten.

Make sure you cook the wild rice until the kernels explode- I was in such a hurry that it didn't (I followed the recipe instead of my own cooking sense), and it ended up tasting like a bunch of twigs. If I did this over, I would cut the onions into halves or quarters before caramelizing - that was the best part.

Easy, yummy and perfect with Apricot- Glazed Chicken with Dried Plums and Sage from this site. Made minor modifications due to time and ingredient issues. Frozen pearl onions sauted in 2 T butter, added 2 cups brown rice for additional 2 minutes. Poured into 13 x 9 and added chopped apricots, thyme and 4 cups of chicken broth. Baked at 350 for 60-75 minutes. Really delicious. Rice had a slight bite to it so not mushy - just how we like it. Served with apple, gruyere and walnut salad with pear balsamic and EVOO. Easy weeknight dinner.

A VERY big hit, made to complement roast duck with an ancho chile sauce. I too substituted craisins as we couldn't find the dried cherries, and their sweetness worked great. I had to give the recipe to two of our dinner guests.

Tried this with Uncle Ben's wild/long instant rice; as suggested by prior reviewer. Used 2c instant rice with 1/2c chicken broth and followed recipe from there. Added 1/4c each of cranberry/raisin/apricot/pecan; 2.5 tsp fresh thyme; and a small onion. The wild rice overpowered everything, including the turkey, but we considered this dish to be the star of the meal. Still looking for a fabulous bread-stuffing recipe, but this would do in a pinch. A very pretty dish, with nice flavor and not too sweet. For those shopping for dried fruit at the grocery story, be on the lookout for "Sun-Maid Goldens and Cherries".

A New England twist, make with brown rice instead of white, use dried cranberries and dried blueberries instead of dried sour cherries, use sauted slivered almonds instead of pecans. I aslso dried chopped scallions instead of pearl onions one time, sauted. Just a change in a good recipe to a different good one.

Delicious. No modifications required.

I LOVED this recipe! We couldn't stop eating it even after we had stuffed ourselves full. My supermarket didn't have the dried cherries so I used craisins. I also halved the chicken broth and used water for the other half, just personal preference. I didn't bake it afterwards as the recipe says, just served it as a side dish with some pork we were having. My 15 month old can't get enough of it either.

I make this all the time. Will sometimes buy the frozen pearl onions or just cut up onions- either way, it is perfect for the holidays.

I made this for a dinner party and I thought it needed more liquid; it dried out too much while baking. I also thought it was more flavorful before baking. I think I would skip baking when making it again, unless I was putting the stuffing in a turkey. All that being said, my guests still raved about it and had second helpings. It is a wonderful mixture of flavors.

I used 2.5 cups wild rice and barley mix from the bulk section of the local co-op and cooked that in the broth. Onions give me bad headaches, so I just used 4 cloves of minced garlic, sauteed in 1 tbsp. of butter and the herbs. After the rice is cooked, I mixed it all together with 2 more tbsp. of melted butter (to cut the fat) and just served it hot, instead of baking it in the oven or stuffing the bird. People absloutely rave over this dish and beg for the recipe. My version is easier, lower in fat and still great!

My husband & daughter were diagnosed with celiac disease a little over a year ago, so we have been searching for a gluten-free dressing that all of us like ... this is it!! Even our non-celiac son loved it, as did everyone else at our Thanksgiving supper! We could not find dried tart cherries, so we substituted a mix of fresh & dried cranberries, and it was superb. Thanks so much!

Outstanding! Made this for our Thanksgiving turkey using brown basmati rice instead of white rice, cranberries instead of cherries, an extra cup of stock and a touch of sage. This dish is definitely going to be a staple in our household from now on. Even the kids loved it!

This was fabulous. I used a long grain wild rice mix instead of the 2 different rices and it turned out great. I baked all of it in the dish and it was moist and delicious. Will definately be the recipe I make every year on Christmas Eve, otherwise my family would be very dissappointed.

This stuffing was delicious! We didn't have pearl onions, so just sauteed some regular onions which was fine. Also, couldn't find wild rice in Australia, so substituted brown rice which was fine, although I am sure wild rice would have been better. We used a mixture of dried and fresh cranberries instead of the dried cherries, and this made it great for thanksgiving. I also added some chopped fresh sage which complemented the flavors of the apricot really well. Everyone is still eating the leftovers of this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I've made this recipe every year since it appeared in Bon Appetit. It's my personal favorite, my son loves it, and I prepared it for my beau's family for Christmas in San Diego last year, and all received thumbs up! The nice texture and surprising combination of flavors make this recipe a departure from your traditional stuffings. I always double the recipe to be sure we have LOTS for the freezer and many follow-up meals!

I took this rice stuffing to a Christmas Eve dinner that served Honey Baked Ham and Maple Turkey Breast. The stuffing was a perfect fit. I used gold raisins as they plump up really nicely when cooked. I would definately make this again. It will go into my holiday recipe file.

A favorite with my family and much demanded, on it's way to becoming a tradition. Cover carefully on reheating, since the wild rice will dry out quickly and become too crunchy.

I was glad to see the reader tip about using frozen onions, though I unfortunately saw it after spending an hour peeling the onions. This is a wonderfully tasty dish. I butterflied a pork tenderloin and stuffed it with this, then served slices on a bed of more stuffing and drizzled it with a sauce made of a reduction and puree of balsamic vinegar, dried cherries, Port, and sour cream. The flavors are spectacular! My guests agreed that it does wonderful things for pork, but that it might be a little sweet for turkey.

Because of this recipe I now have 3 stuffings to make each Thanksgiving. After 2 years of peeling the onions..I now use frozen whole small onions which saves an entire evening of prep. The vegetarians love it when I substitute veg. stock for chicken and it doesn't hurt the flavor.

This is now one of our Thanksgiving must-haves. I was so happy to have found it on the Internet after looking for my magazine copy for days! Now our dinner for 30+ people will be complete. We serve it as a delicious side dish and welcome alternative to cornbread stuffing.

In a word, YUMMY!!!! This has become not only a Thanksgiving staple, but a autumn/winter side dish stand by. The flavors are amazing and it's perfect even alone!

What a fabulous rice recipe! I made this with cornish hens for a "mini" Thanksgiving dinner. My husband is not usually much for dried fruit, but he absolutely devoured this recipe. It's been 3 days since I made it and he's still talking about it. A great alternative to traditioal stuffing

Delicious. I found that you can't make it a day ahead because the dried fruit gets soggy and the onions tend to fall apart. Also, I think the wild rice needs more chicken stock as the amount listed almost wasn't enough. It is my official Thanksgiving stuffing...

I made this this morning for Thanksgiving (2 days away). However, if I keep sneaking tastes, it is not going to last that long. It's so good! Weirdly enough, I couldn't find dried cherries at the grocery store. I used dried cranberries instead--appropriate for Thanksgiving, I think. Make this stuffing and ENJOY!
