Like others, I used used baby portabellas. Awesome, even brussel sprout haters loved it. Definitely making it again this Thanksgiving, but a day or two before.

I have made this recipe several times, at the request of previously brussels sprout-hating family members. I did not use oyster mushrooms, but baby bellas due to availability. Otherwise, I made it as directed and found it to be delicious.

This is a Holiday staple in my house. I used baby bella mushrooms because the store was out of oyster mushrooms, aside from that no need to change the recipe. It is a lot of work for a side dis, but well worth it!

After all that sauteing in the same skillet, the end result was more like having veggies in gravy instead of a cream sauce and with gravy already on the Thanksgiving menu, it was not well received.

This is a definite keeper. I used this dish to replace the usual (yawn) creamed onions. Fabulous, especially if you glaze the onions brown and allow the sprouts to brown. I used shiitakes because I think cultivated oyster mushrooms have zero flavor. I also use creme fraiche instead of regular sweet heavy cream, adds a slight tang. There were no leftovers!

Brussel sprouts are normally bitter. This is a dish even veggie haters will like.

I made this for New Year's Day dinner and it was wonderful. My guests loved it and even asked for the recipe. I made it exactly as written except I used dried Oyster mushrooms (supermarket didn't have fresh) and soaked them first. Will definitely make this time and time again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and had many requests for an encore at Christmas. Both times I left out the pearl onions and substituted a half of a regular white onion chopped. It seemed that many pearl onions was just overkill.

I made this dish on Thanksgiving and it tasted excellent. All my guests loved it. The only drawback was that the brussels sprouts turned pretty dark after baking probably because of overcooking. Anyone knows how to overcome this problem?

Only one word - YUCK! Everyone thought it was disgusting, and I made it as the recipe called for. Way over-priced too with the Oyster mushrooms.

Forget the oyster mushrooms! Our supermarket was out, so I used regular, old button mushrooms, and it was still phenomenal. This is the kind of dish that convinces all those brussels-sprout-haters how good they can be!

Excellent make-ahead dish for Thanksgiving (I did everything but top with the crumb mixture and bake it the day before). The method made the brussel sprouts tender and sweet. Presentation was lovely and the taste mouthwatering. Everyone came back for seconds.

to the other reviewers- thanks for the feedback. This sounds delicious and I love anything that can be prepared ahead of time! I will definitely try this.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and I agree with the reviewer below -- it does take a lot of time to make. Oyster mushrooms cost $3.99 for 3 oz in my part of the country, so I still think it's a pricey side dish. I used 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, and it seemed enough. Be careful not to overbake it -- just enough to get the topping brown. I'd make it again - despite the cost, it was tasty.

This recipe is great. 1 1/2 TBL. of thyme seemed like too much so I cut the amount in half.I would definately do this the day before Thanksgiving next year-too labor intensive to make on the day of. To the other cooks oyster mushrooms are not that expensive in Dallas-4.99LB.

A pound of oyster mushrooms??? At $4.99 per ounce this is pretty outrageous for a side dish!
