Tastes great. Agree that the vanilla layer needs more, but this is was fun dish for our Italian holiday meal. Next time I may use some food coloring for the nut and strawberry layers- the colors were very bland when I made it.

I agree with Coyorda about the icing texture of the vanilla. For the vanilla layer,I steeped the milk and the vanilla bean for double the time and the flavor was great. My guests enjoyed the strawberry layer the best, I was able to buy local strawberries which can make a difference.

The vanilla is probably to make this dessert red, green, and white, like the Italian flag. I'm making this tonight and will doctor the vanilla layer to make it more flavorful (maybe I'll pick up a bottle of vanilla paste?).

The pistachio and strawberry part of the parfait was unbelievable. The vanilla was a bit icy; however, tasting it all together it went together fine. Everyone absolutely enjoyed it. I think an idea to improve the vanilla layer would be to use less milk and more whipped cream for it to give it more body.

I agree completely with arizonacook. The pistachio was particularly fabulous, so next time maybe I'll try pistachio-strawberry-pistachio.

Fairly labor-intensive but delicious, with a nice texture. Very refreshing. Next time I would double the amount of milk used to steep the pistachio mixture. Also, I might skip the vanilla layer. It didn't add much. I might also double the amount of pureed strawberries and save half to use as a sauce.
