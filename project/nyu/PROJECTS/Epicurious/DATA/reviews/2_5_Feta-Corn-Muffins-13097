I made these for a potluck and they were a hit: light, moist, and a perfect accompaniment. I didn't have sage on hand, so I used fresh thyme, and I also added chopped sundried tomato and kalamata olives (though even without the additions, they still would have been delicious). I baked them in a mini- muffin pan for 13 minutes, which was perfect, and made exactly 24. These are a nice change from "regular," plain corn muffins.

my husband and i are big soup eaters during the fall and winter and i'm always looking for muffin/scone/bread accompaniments. i tested these last week and loved them -- i only baked them for about 13 minutes, and they were perfect. next time i will add fresh snipped chives instead of the sage (i felt the feta overpowered the sage). i plan to try making these in mini-muffins, too, for dinner parties as a starter with soup or salad.

These are incredible muffins especially with the extra items put in. I would highly reccommend them especially if you really like corn meal and feta cheese, obviously the people that put no forks don't really like corn meal

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This is a mediocre muffin and not the best use of feta.

These muffins were super yummy when hot from the oven. When cold they get dry and icky. If you toast them to reheat they're good again. Not the best use of feta, but good.

If it were an option, I'd give this zero forks. These were the worst corn muffins I've ever had--incredibly dry, even though I was careful not to overmix and didn't overbake (just 17 min), and absolutely flavorless, even with the feta (I also used tomato-basil feta) and the sage. My husband took one bite and refused to eat anymore. I choked down one (we were eating them with soup and a salad), but threw the rest in the freezer to crumble for a stuffing later. Much later.
