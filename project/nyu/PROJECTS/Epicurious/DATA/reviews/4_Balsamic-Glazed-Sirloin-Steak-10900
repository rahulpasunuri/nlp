Best pan sauce I've ever made. I would use all the ingredients, especially sherry, even though it may not be in your pantry already. Always thought sherry was too sweet, but it worked brilliantly here. Only thing, the sauce is so good you'll easily want to triple the sherry and balsamic and double everything else. Only other change I made: Since my steak was thick, I seared it for 3 minutes per side on the highest setting, set it aside, started the pan sauce, and finished the sauce and steak for a couple minutes in the pan (cast iron) in the broiler. On another note, never heard of sesame seeds on a steak, but they gave it a nice flavor. Perfect crust. The reduced sauce was exploding with flavor while still bringing out the flavor of the steak. I served it with a baked potato and a salad made from cucumber, heirloom tomatoes and sweet peppers with a balsamic-olive-oil-honey dressing.

Very good, I would suggest making double the sauce my husband wanted more for his potatoes. Very easy recipe to follow, had most ingredients on hand already. I will be making this again for some house guests. Easy for a weeknight dinner, but nice enough for company.

I've made this many times, and it's always a hit. The recipe needs to be followed exactly, though - use the right ingredients and in the right quantities. I've tried modifying it in all kinds of ways, and nothing is ever quite as good as the original.

Done without modification. None of us were that impressed. Better than just a steak, but I've had simple wine reductions that were better.

Incredibly easy, and super-delish! I used a 1"-thick cut instead since I prefer my steak thicker, and omitted the sesame seeds since I didn't have any on hand. The sauce is a perfect complement to the meat, and wonderfully complex and oh-so-tasty. This is easy enough for a quick weeknight meal, but good enough for company, too. Love!

Two days ago, we were entertaining a friend for the evening. I was looking for something delicious to make for him. Something simple because I didn't have a lot of time, yet impressive because I have a secret crush on him. So I made these steaks. And OH MY LORDY! They were so good. I made the recipe exactly as it's written except for the sesame seeds and half of the soy sauce. I doubled the glaze as lots of reviewers recommended, and boy was I glad. We could have used even more. Anyway, this is so good. Soooo Gooooood. Ashlea

I made this tonight for the first time. IT WAS INCREDIBLE!! I can't wait to make it again. I took a piece of crusty bread and wiped the plate clean. I do recommend making a double recipe because you will want the sauce on the potato and vegetables in addition to the meat. I substituted nothing but I left out the seeds. Enjoy!

This was a good way to prepare an inexpensive cut of meat. We enjoyed it. In fairness, I probably should have gotten the pan hotter, it might have turned out better if it had seared more quickly on its way to medium rare.

This is my new favorite recipe! It is so easy and comes out like you've spent all day on it. I didn't have honey so put in a little brown sugar instead, doubt it made much difference. Great for a fancy, but quick meal. Baby boiled potatos, broccoli and a Zinfandel. Perfecto!

Rating: 4
This is a quick and fantastic recipe. I had steak and did not know what to do with it. I did not have sesame seeds or honey, but did not realize until after I started. Substituted the seeds for sesame oil and brown sugar for the honey. This was fantastic!! The sauce makes this. It does remind me of teriyaki sauce. I can't wait to try this again with all the ingredients!

I gave this 4 forks because it tastes wonderful and it is so easy and quick to prepare. I have made it about 3 times in the past 2 months. Everyone seems to love it. The sauce is delicious and most people have all the ingredients on hand. If you don't have all the ingredients, you only need buy them once in a great while, because none of them run out quickly or go bad quickly.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. I doubled the sauce and ended up putting the steaks back in the sauce to cook a little longer, which turned out really nice. (Maybe my steaks were too thick but I had to cook them for more than double as long as suggested.) Served with brussel sprouts and forbidden rice. Yum!

This was delicious. I doubled the sauce. The meat was not extremely tender, but the flavor was great. I used 2 beef sirloin tip steaks totaling 3/4 pound.

I doubled the sauce because my sirloin was 1.3 pounds, and it was the right amount. I thought it was great, and took very little time to make. Served with brussels sprouts....would make again.

Very simple and tasty dish! After cooking the sauce, I put the steaks back into the pan so the steaks can "soak" up the sauce, which was awesome! My husband would've liked for me to just spoon the sauce over the steaks, as he said the sauce overpowered the flavor of the steaks. So depending on your taste, either way is still very good. Also, double the sauce! It is so good! Will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe that I've made a few times now. My fiance loves balsamic and honey, so this is one of her favorites. I've never used the sesame seeds, always black pepper. Also, instead of the sherry, I usually use whatever wine we're having with dinner. This one is a hit every time!

I have made this dish several times and have loved it more and more each time. Definitely be sure to double the glaze. The glaze has a "kick" if you following the recipe exactly. We like really spicy, so we add more red pepper. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Truly exceptional. Have been making this since it's original publication in 1994 without alterations - why try t improve perfection? Sherry is not a cooking wine as one reviewer commented, but a fortified wine whose sweet essence is essential here, and please don't cook the sauce separately - the pan juices are a must in the sauce. I keep the sirloin in a wam oven and then transfer it with whatever juices accumulate with it into the pan with the sauce and serve immediately.

I too skipped the sherry and added red wine and also subbed the seasame seeds for course black pepper. It was very good and something that is very quick and easy.

I've made this dish several times and my husband salivates at the mere mention of it! I use red wine instead of the sherry and I've tried the sirloin and filet mignon for a slightly fancier occasion.

You will not be disapointed with it - as long as you don't overcook the meat! Buen Provecho!

Yum. This was just delicious. I used marsalla instead of sherry, and as suggested I tripled the sauce. Absolutely will make this again.

TY to those who suggested a double-up on the sauce. But to set aside a cooked steak & expect it to STAY med-rare? I don't THINK so! Which is probably why so many cooks complained of tough meat. At med-rare, sirloin ain't bad - overcooked, it's tough. Yuck! That said, I made the sauce in a separate skillet, b4 I cooked the steaks. And, if the sesame seeds hadn't stuck to the pan, I would have been happier w the result. The finished result was delicious, regardless. Served it w mixed greens & grape tomatoes w a balsamic vinaigrette.

This was just okay. The peppers made it spicey, so you have to like a little umph in your dish. I expected it to be more rich than spicey. My fiance would probably rate it 2 forks.

I made this for my fiance last night and he loved it! I doubled the sauce recipe like others suggested and I'm glad about that! I didn't have sherry on hand but used a red wine instead and the sauce was still delicious. I served this with mashed potatoes and a garden salad. The only downside for me was the sirlion was a little too tough. I will probably use a better cut of meat next time.

I made this recipe tonight for my parents and myself for Valentine's Day and it was a huge success. The last few minutes of cooking the glaze I put the steak in the pan with it to keep it moist and more flavorful. We all loved it and our only regret was that there was not enough left over! I upped the amount of steak to fit 3 people but kept every other amount the same and it was delicious.

This was great! I substituted two New York strips for the ribeyes and doubled the ingredients for the glaze and it was incredible!

Definitely makes some smoke, but was well worth it!

This dish was delicious and quick and easy to prepare. As was reccommended, I doubled the sauce, and it worked out great. The sirloin steak I had on hand was too thick so I had to cook it for quite a while. Definitely stay under one inch. The dish is a a bit heavy, while also having an asian flavor. Try serving it with a salad and a simple light side dish, like rice.

I tripled the sauce as suggested, it was a good idea. After noting what others said about the meat being tough, I cut my sirloin as if for stir-fry and cooked it very quickly. I only had Merlot available and used it. This was very good and the meat was tender. Probably even better if I used a slightly sweeter wine...but yes, I would make it again. My husband and guest liked it very much.

Rating: 3
Nice flavor. I am very fond of balsamic glazes on salmon, pork, and beef. I would definitely make it again. One comment to the reviewer from Providence, RI -- the ingredient cooking wine does not appear in this recipe. If you were adding/substituting cooking wine then it is unfair to criticize the recipe. Cooking wine has salt added so maybe that is why your version was too salty. Don't blame the recipe!

This was good, but not nearly as good as the reviews I had read made it sound. The sauce was good, but gets very salty if you follow the directions. I think using regular wine instead of cooking wine would reduce the salt, as would cutting back on the soy. I have found far better steak recipes on this web site. The sesame seeds were an interesting touch, though.

Recently made this dish, found it to be tasty and quick to prepare. Following the suggestions, I also doubled the amount of sauce. I can see why so many people enjoy the sauce, although I found the the honey with the balsamic nearly made it too sweet for my taste. I also served the mashed potatoes with celery root and mascarpone from this site - was very complementary. A bottle of cabernet franc matched up nicely with this meal.

absolutely delicious! i tripled the sauce at other suggestions, which was fortunate since it made the meal. i served this with mashed potatoes and broccoli; drizzled the sauce on the mashed potatoes and they were delicious. i agree with other reviewers about the chewiness of the sirloin. maybe if you grilled it it would be better? i did tenderize it with a mallet but it was still fairly chewy. oh -- i realized as i was cooking that we had no sesame seeds, so i had to leave those out...also, we were out of red pepper flakes so i had to use ground red pepper...and had no sherry, so i used madeira. even with all these substitutions -- yum!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend for a special Valentines Dinner. I followed the advice of the reviews and I used NY Strip Steaks and I tripled the sauce. I prepared mashed potatoes as a side and drizzled the extra sauce on top of them. It was wonderful. I would choose this over a charcoaled steak, any day.

I feel that this recipe rated 3 forks. Going by the list of ingredients for the glaze I was expecting something like a spicy teriyaki taste. The balsamic vinegar was key to the overall taste difference. I used a 1# top sirloin, 1" thick and seared it for 2 minutes on both sides. It was a perfect medium rare. Any additional cooking would have made the meat too tough. The possibility of scourching the sauce is very high due to the honey so make sure to have your mise em place. I tripled the sauce and served it over steamed jasmine rice with a side of stir-fried brussels sprouts cooked with garlic and a splash of soy added at the very end to give it a carmelized flavor. Nice casual family dinner but not suitable for dinner guest.

Rating: 3
The sauce was delicious! I agree with the Boston reader - double the sauce. Also, I wouldn't use sirloin again, it was too tough. I'd use NY strip. We really liked the sauce and the flavor it gave the beef. I feel a better cut of beef is needed for this recipe! Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
this was so good!!! Everyone loved it. 20 minutes before dinner time, I found this recipe, had all the ingredients on hand and madfe it. For the effort this was UNBELIEVABLE. Substitutions I made: sweet red wine instead of Sherry and Red Wine Vinegar instead of Balsamic. The glaze was this lovely deep red. The sauce was just perfect...a little sweet, but tempered by the red pepper and ground pepper (I was generous in using both). I cubed the stak before cooking, this gave extra flavor. EVERYONE LOVED THIS!!! Try it..you won't regret it!

I used top sirloin and it was delicious, but we can't seem to get the cooking times correct on the stove. Anyway, a series of errors, made a great meal. I blended all the liquid glaze ingredients ahead of time and carefully read the instructions while cooking. So, the glaze became a sauce reduction. The meat was too red in the middle, so I thinly sliced the meat and added it to the sauce, heating on low for a couple of minutes. The meat was cooked at various stages, the sauce was like a gravy and we loved it. I'll try it as a glaze the next time.

The taste was great, but I needed more sauce. I think I'll double the sauce next time. Also, any way to get more of the flavor into the meat?

I'm not sure why, but this did not turn out well for me. I'm glad I had no guests. The meat was tough (I don't think sirloin is a good choice) and I had trouble not burning the sauce. I would make the sauce again but I would broil the meat and I wouldn't use sirloin.

This was a great hit at the party! I used thin sliced beef steak and cut each steak into 4 smaller parts. A little baking soda helped to tenderize the meat. The sesame is a wonderfully fragrant coating for the steak, and they went perfectly together. I salted and peppered the beef while cooking it, and it turned out well that way. The sauce is great on beef as well as plain white rice! I added some ginger and it was a nice touch.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my fiance but it was not one of his favorites. The sesame seeds add a nice nutty flavor to the meat. For some reason I thought the sauce would penetrate into the meat a little more. Separately, the meat and sauce were good but together it just didn't seem to mesh and my steaks were a little chewy. I'd still make this again though and perhaps tenderize the meat a little with a mallet.

Loved the glaze. I usually marinate sirloin since it can be chewy but didn't for this recipie so the flavor wouldn't compete with the glaze. Recommend slicing the sirloin very thin if this is the cut of meat used. I'll definitely make this again (probably with another cut of meat).
