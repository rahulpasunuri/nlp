This receipe makes me think: "And God so loved the world he ensured fiddleheads, morels and new peas were to be in season together." But seriously, this is fantastic -- delicate, delicious and sublime. To place one's self in culinary Nirvana add a bit of heavy organic cream and two cooked and shelled cut up lobsters.

I was a little suspicious of the instructions essentially to boil all the vegetables (following the parboiling of a few)-- especially the morels. Then the addition of mint seemed odd, given the rarity of the morels' and fiddleheads' flavors (and the fact they only appear for a short period every year and should be savored). But I tried it out anyway and must say I found the flavors very cold and textures uninspired. Someone recommended serving rice with mint and feta, which on its own was quite delicious.

I made this because I wanted to try the pre-prepped fiddleheads from Trader Joe's. This dish is wonderful! I made a double recipe (the 1-cup sized serving listed does not go far). I was a little short on the fiddleheads so I made up the difference with extra zucchini, which I subbed for the pattypan squash. In place of the pearl onions I thinly sliced a red onion in crescents. I doubled the garlic, and used some "baby cut" carrots from ths store to save on prep time. I served it with rice and feta cheese.

It's been two years since I made this recipe, yet I still remember how wonderful it was. I'm hoping to make it again this sprig.
