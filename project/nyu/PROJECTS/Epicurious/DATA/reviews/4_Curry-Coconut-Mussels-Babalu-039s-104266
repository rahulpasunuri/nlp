One of our favorites! I use light coconut milk with no issues; be sure to reduce the sauce as directed (I reduce down to about half), and it's PLENTY creamy and flavorful. Also saute the spices for about a minute with the onion/garlic/ginger, right before adding the other ingredients; this is typically done with Indian dishes, as it "wakes up" the spices. Plenty of broth for twice as many mussels, and also delicious with littleneck clams. A tasty, tasty winner!

This was really tasty! I used 1 1/2 lbs of mussels for me & my boyfriend and it was more than enough. We had lots of broth left over that I'll use with a chicken dish. I only had 1/4 c OJ so I used 1/4 c lemon juice to make up for it. I did use the saffron and it added a nice subtle flavor but boy, is it expensive! I couldn't really taste the chili paste so I might add more next time though I'd be worried about overpowering the other flavors. Definitely a special occasion meal - delicious and rich!

I had everything already on-hand except the mussels. What a great dish! There was enough "broth" to have steamed another two pounds. Will definitely make again!

Thanks for posting the recipe. We moved away from St. Louis and miss Babalu's. The chef is amazing and he gave me another one of his recipes.

got to say it's good liked the kick at the end was dicouraged at first to use it do to the amount of different flavours but she work out no off balance

excellent insight Halifax/ thank you/ I also omitted the bay leaf and added Kaffir Lime & I used paste/I have to say after reading the list of ingredients I also decided to ommit the saffron, maybe a mistake but it seemed a waste and the dish was a huge hit with friends

I tried to lighten this up for a mid-week meal by using light coconut milk - big mistake. Broth was watery and lacked that creamy hit I was craving. Definitely stick to full-fat coconut milk in this recipe.

This dish was amazing. The sweet coconut milk was a nice contrast to the spice. We added some diced Jalapeno Peppers for added kick, and it was still amazing. We're saving the leftover sauce to make curried seafood on rice noodles tomorrow - can't wait!

I thought this dish was so flavourful and truly delicious. I followed the recipe except for the following changes: I omitted the saffron (I thought I had some on hnad but didn't) and used indian curry paste instead of powder (I find it gives more depth of flavour than powder) and I added a Lime Kaffir leaf at the same time as the bay leaf. It turned out beautifully. I will definately make it again.

A fabulous dish--the balance of flavours was excellent and the saffron was not smothered by the chilli. Looked gorgeous too! Also, there was plenty of 'broth' for at least 4 servings so one could add more mussels with the same recipe.

Excellent, not too rich, the sauce fantastic. Try using a little bit cayenne and sweet lemon juice instead of orange.

The sauce was fantastic! The two of us went through an entire sourdough boule sopping it up. Given that, two pounds of mussles was extravagant to say the least -- next time I'll cut down a bit. I loved the way the citrus cut the richness of the coconut milk. Can't wait to do it again. (P.S. I left out the saffron and didn't miss it.)

This was fantastic! It was also easy. I would make it with jasmine rice to soak up the delicious sauce. I used a Vidalia onion, and it was like candy.

Absolutely positively delicious!!! Before having 15 people for a sit down nine course dinner, my husband and I tried this treat. It was exceptional!!! I prepared 4 pounds of mussels and there wasn't one left!!! THe combination of spices, textures were phenomenal!!! Served with baquettes to sop up the extra extraordinary sauce. By the way, I'm a cooking instructor always looking for new ways to prepare the tried and true.

From teh reviews I've read I thought this would turn out to be an absolutely great recipe. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed, saffron is a very strong spice and it really overpowered every other taste... to many differnet tastes, at least that's what my boyfriend and I felt and not as creamy as we would have liked it to be. Ah well.

Absolutely great! This is the first time we've ever made mussels at home and this receipe rocks. We also added lemongrass which gave it a nice flavor. We'll definitely make this one again!

Excellent as is, but I made some changes that made it better IMHO: I added scallops, shrimps, clams, and chunks of salmon, and about 1 cup of apple juice. I poached each kind of seafood in the broth separately and arranged them in individual bowls, did the mussels last and then poured the broth over everything after the mussels are out. Served it with bread to some friends on their anniversary. They really enjoyed it and reported that the next day the leftovers were even better on spaghetti (!) so I might try that next time.

this is now my all-time favorite mussels recipe...I work in the executive dining room of a big investment bank in Manhattan, and we now serve it as a soup, removing the mussels from the shells to make it easier to eat in a business suit. always a hit

I can't wait to make this again! It was easy enought to thro together at the last minute, and was a huge success. I made one addition, Shitake mushrooms, which made this great recipe absolutey amazing. If I may be so bold, I suggest using Terruzi & Pethud's Terre di tuffi for the wine. It works well as an ingredient, and accompanies the dish very nicely.

This recipe is superb!! The curry-coconut sauce is also great with chicken or shrimp. Everyone to whom I have served this wonderful dish asks for the recipe. It's a great dish for a crowd. I served it for a pre-trip party for a Caribbean scuba diving trip.

Found the flavour okay, but not spectacular. However, the appearance was lovely - shiny black mussels sitting in a pool of golden sauce with bits of red and green!

The beauty of this recipe is the mixture of flavors that coem together to make an irresistable dish.

This is a great recipe. I added an habanero paste (home made)to make it hotter. Highly recommended

awesome, wonderful!! Tastes better than anything we've had in restuarants. Didn't have chile paste so added in hot pepper relish instead and used lemon juice in place of lime. What a hit!! Will double this next time.

Wow! It took a special trip to find Gambal Oelek, but it was worth it. I don't remember the last time I've encountered such a flavorful combo. This dish is one of my top ten now; every guest wanted the recipe.
