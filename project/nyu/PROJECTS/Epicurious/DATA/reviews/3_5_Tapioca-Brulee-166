My boyfriend loves tapioca pudding and I was looking for something extra special for an anniversary dessert. This was perfect. While making the pudding, it seemed very thin, so I chose to add 1 extra Tb of tapioca, bringing the total to 3 Tbs. I also added just a touch of almond extract, as recommended by others, and we really thought that added a wonderful flavor. This was just a fantastic treat.

I used freshly picked blackberries from my backyard, and was extremely pleased with the reviews I got from my guests. I made a sauce with a peeled pureed peach, 1/4 cup sauvignon blanc, 1 tbsp white sugar,1/4 cup crushed pecans, and 1/4 cup whipping cream. It was an excellent compliment, but yielded a little too much. As for a previous review I read, if it seems a little thin, you may have brought it to a boil too fast. I found that a low/medium heat worked well for me. I have 100% requests from the guests for the recipe, or a repeat performance. Cheers.

This went over extremely well at a dinner party, with a few additions...i put fresh black rasberries and a dollop of melted Nutella (hazelnut chocolate)in the bottom of the ramikin (sp?), then put in the tapioca and did the brulee topping. Served with a side of white chocolate dipped black rasberries. People were moaning, and now my boyfriend requests it about once a month.

Really very good. I added some fresh vanilla bean pulp to the tapioca mixture which gave it a nice subtle taste. Next time I may add a drop or two of coconut extract for something different. Just needs to be chilled for a few hours not overnight as the recipe states.

I tried making this with tapioca pudding mix (5T) but had no success, it was too soupy. So if you are like us, and there is no "tapioca flour" in the store, skip this one because it just doesn't work. I didn't rate this in fairness to the recipe.

This recepie was ok, it had mediocre flavors. I made a few modifications, instead of the rasberries i used strawberries and i made a sauce to go with it using 10-11 medium strawberries, 3-4 Tbs white wine and 2-3 Tbs sugar pureed together until smooth. I think it would have been lost without the sauce.

I made this dish for a "dessert potluck" at work - and it was great! I doubled the recipe and put it in one large container. It was very colorful - and best of all, not too sweet!

Delicious -- everyone enjoyed this dessert!! The raspberries were an especially nice touch. In response to an earlier review, tapioca flour is NOT the same as instant tapioca and thus is probably responsible for the lack of success with the recipe. The only adjustment I made was adding a bit more brown sugar on top before broiling. Yummy!!!

Is Tapioca flour the same as instant tapioca? I made this dish with tapioca flour and it didn't "gell up" enough and was kind of soupy! It got even more soupy when I put it under the broiler.

I found this recipe easy to make and wonderfully smooth. I did substitude almond extract though in lieu of the vanilla. This gave this wonderful pudding an unexpected nutty taste which complimented the brown sugar topping. My guests raved about it!
