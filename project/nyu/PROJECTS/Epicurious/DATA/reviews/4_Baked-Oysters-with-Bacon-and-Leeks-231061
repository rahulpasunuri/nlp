Used oysters from the plastic containers and put them into clam shaped baking dishes. The result was something between baked oysters and oyster chowder. In any case it was tasty but not very similar too what was pictured. I think it might have been better to leave out the cream mixture and just use the leek mixture. Only used 4 slices of bacon and topped each serving individually to make one a vegetarian version (sauteéd the veggies in olive oil). Also used panko and added a bit of garlic to the veggie mix.

Really delicious and fairly simple to make. I halved and divided 1 pound of pre-shucked oysters between four ramekins. As a time saver I used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and it worked well.

I baked and served this recipe in ramikens as an appetizer. The guests loved it! I would definitely make this again.

Outstanding recipe. I did make one significant change. I used fresh cut corn instead of the celery. Everyone raved.

Made this exactly as the recipe called (ramekin style) as an appetizer for an upscale dinner. Used good oysters from Central Market. Overall, I thought they were OK. One of the eight of us really liked them, but they mostly went uneaten. Kind of a dud, but in fairness to the recipe, oysters aren't a staple menu item in North Texas, so it may be better to those used to eating seafood.

Very simple, very tasty. My husband watched a video on how to shuck oysters here on Epicurious, and so while I was making the stuffing, he prepped the oysters for me. I cut the recipe in half, because we only had 12 oysters, and that was no problem. The stuffing was incredibly delicious and the bake time for these was perfect. I don't think I've ever had better!

I made this in a gratin dish, used Pernod instead of the white wine, increased the cayenne to taste and left out the cheese. I used the over sized oysters we gathered this weekend for this dish. I will make this again and again!

Very very good and pretty. Use a little bit of garlic for a little more flavor.

We served this beautiful and easy to prepare dish to guests in small Ramekins. The fresh jarred oysters worked well. Everyone said that they would gladly skip the Entree for seconds of "Mike's" baked oysters. The bacon adds depth of flavor and the leeks are light and are visually appealing. This recipe has replaced Oysters Rockefeller as our favorite way to enjoy this tasty mollusk.

As a big fan of oysters, this recipe adds to the many that are served around here. We are blessed with an abundance of beautiful oysters in the Gulf Coast Region. This is great served with Oyster Rockefeller for a delicious diversity of flavor. As a main course or for appetizers, this is a winner for sure and deserves 4 forks.

Excellent recipe for oysters. Served as an appetizer for Christmas dinner last year. Two guests who never eat oysters, one who refuses seafood, both tried them and asked for a second. Highly recommend.

I am not a fan of oysters, but for my parents 50th anniversary I hoped they would enjoy these oysters. We all loved them. My brother in law risked a seafood allergy to consume more than his share and my sister asked for the recipe ( the gourmet of the family.) Thanks for all of the great reviews for this, and so many other recipes

I have made this several times. I found that the shucked oysters baked in the shell turn out much better then jarred oysters in ramekins.

Dinner Party Delicious! I pre-broiled the (whole) oysters to get them to open easily then put the mixture on top of the half shell. Probably better to have them opened ahead of time but I was using the Bryan Miller recipe in tandem with this one. It worked great. Better than Bryan's I might add which are too leeky. The apple smoked bacon is a real plus. We will definitely do these again and since we're in Eastern Long Island, we have nice plump blue points to do them with.

My stepdaughter's mother in law brought these to Thanksgiving Dinner. We are from the Chesapeake Bay area and know our oysters. These were more than fabulous. They were cooked for the time specified in the recipe and were perfect -- plump and luscious. And they a perfect match for good champagne.

A wonderful recipe that I have made several times with requests from family and friends to make again. Today is Thanksgiving and it will be on our table.

Fantastic winter appetizer. Another serving suggestion that my family enjoyed was placing the shucked oyster on a slice of crusty french bread that has been buttered or oiled on the bottom side and then topped and baked as directed. It makes a great bruschetta.

I've made this recipe many times - romantic dinner for two, family dinner appetizer, dinner parties and holidays. No matter what, it's been a huge hit. A word of advise if you are making this for a big crew (I was doubling recipe for a holiday first course) - don't use two racks for two trays in a single oven at once. They just didn't "crisp up" correctly. Better to do single trays in separate ovens or do one batch at a time and then keep first batch warm by covering, or re-heating just prior to serving.

I guess I am the exception. I had high expectations with the ingredients, but it seemed lacking in some way. Maybe it was me, but I don't think I'd serve it to guests.

We made this with very large Hood Canal Oysters for 2, so we halved the recipe and used 6 oysters in the shell. They were so large we had to cook them for 11 minutes, but they were fabulous. With oysters this large I'd recommend cutting them before putting the sauce on them. Serve them with a great champagne. This will be on the next dinner party menu because it could be made ahead, except for the bread crumbs, and looks beautiful on a platter of salt garnished with parsley.

I made this recipe primarily for my husband who loves oysters. He loved it and surprisingly so did I (I am not that big of an oyster fan). Whats more amazing is that our 16 year old daughter also really enjoyed this, and she has never wanted to try oysters before. I will be making this again.

The big hit at our Thanksgiving table!! The flavors blended so well and they were warm and yummy. I used canned oysters. These are now a new holiday tradition at our house.

None of my guests or I really enjoyed this dish. We cooked the oysters in a casserole dish (rather than using ramekins), and used jarred oysters. (Maybe that was the problem.) The topping was pretty good, but overall it really lacked something. I'll definitely look for another appetizer next time around.

Two words - mouth watering! If you like oysters, you will LOVE this recipe. Definitely a crowd pleaser. The only thing I did differently was that I made the roux (flour, cream mixture) while the leeks were cooking instead of making it first. That way the roux didn't have to sit around for too long before being mixed in with the other ingredients. Just a friendly recommendation. Enjoy!!

Excellent!!! Everyone loved them. Becareful with the cayanne pepper, too much will over power the dish. Tip: I microwaved my oysters briefly to ease their opening.

We made this for a progressive dinner - we doubled the recipe and it turned out great. We used fresh oysters, baking them on the half shell on a bed of rock salt. Presentation was great and everyone raved. The bacon and leek topping is so flavorful and rich that it could be used in other recipes or as a stand alone dip.

Fantastic! Couldn't get fresh oysters so used the refrigerated pack. Cut in half for two of us and baked in a casserole dish rather than ramekins. We loved it & will definitely make again and again.

I madde this for Thanksgiving in a large backing dish and it was great. A real winner.
