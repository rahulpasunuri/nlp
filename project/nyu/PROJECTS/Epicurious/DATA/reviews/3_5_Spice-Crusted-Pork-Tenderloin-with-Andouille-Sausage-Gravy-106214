Easy and enjoyable recipe with tons of taste variety. The gravy is the big win if you are not afraid of meat or on a diet.

I made this for dinner last night and substituted kielbasa for the andouille. It was excellent! I would definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I made it for a picky friend and he loved it too. I stuck very close to the recipe with two exceptions- I doubled the gravy, and after reading a few other reviews I chose to cut the cumin to 1 1/2 tablespoons. For us it was perfect. I ground coriander seeds in a spice mill and the flavor was outstanding. I liked the way they balanced each other out. Served with mashed skin-on red potatoes. I can't wait to make it again!

If you are looking for an exceptional pork dish with a flavourful sauce, this is your recipe. While we couldn't be farther from Cajun country here on Vancouver Island it is important to explain to anyone who has doubts about sausage in a sauce that andouille is often used more as a spice than a "meat" We made this exactly as written as it is our pet peeve of this site when people rate a recipe they have altered considerably. It is important the rouge is well browned so watch it doesn't burn. Make this tonight, you will not be sorry.

Growing up in New Orleans, this recipe interested me with the andouille sausage. I have made it several times and it is always a hit.I use andouille from Whole Foods and take it out of the casing to brown which helps to disperse it evenly through the gravy. If you don't like peppers and onions then don't travel to the Big Easy. That is 2/3s of the Holy Trinity of a roux!

I wasn't all that jazzed about this recipe. I thought the cumin was a little overpowering on the pork. The gravy was pretty good. I think if I made this again I would ease off on the spice crust.

We made this during Thanksgiving week, for company so I tripled the recipe...I had to pry the dishes out of people's hands to stop them from licking them. Great dish, turns people into animals though. Maybe its something in the water. My Boyfriend is a chef, and I made this and he put it on his leftover thanksgiving plate 2 days later, on EVERYTHING.

We made this as written and found it delicious. The next time I made it, I doubled the amount of sausage in the gravy, and we liked it even more. This meal is a little on the rich side, to be sure, but very easy and VERY good.

After reading so many contradictory reviews, I had to try this one. To tell the truth I thought maybe the people who hated it had done something wrong. I am sorry to report that they have a point. This is a dish for people who think there's no such thing as too much meat: a gravy with minced meat served on top of more meat. The flavors are not bad; the roux was easy and I used homemade chicken stock which may have improved the taste, but in the end it was just too much meat. I would only consider making it again doubling the quantity of gravy to accompany mashed potatoes and skipping the andouille and maybe even the peppers.

I substituted hot sausage to give it some zap and it came out great. Extremely rich, but that didn't stop me from eating it for breakfast the next day!

The pork in this dish was as fabulous as it was easy to make. It melted in the mouth and had great flavor. The leftover meat was wonderful the next day on a salad with spinach, avocado, red onion and gorgonzola. The gravy however had an odd flavor, I wouldn't make it again with the peppers and andouille.

I'd absolutely make this again, EXCEPT: my husband, who is from Mali and is 5' 5", hates pork, and threatened to lock me out of the kitchen if I make this again. He prefers Kraft cheese food product, Nascar and memories of 9th grade. What do I do with the parsley? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My husband and I thought that this dish was just delicious. The andouille gravy really complements the spicy crust on the tenderloin pieces-- the flavors really work off each other. I had never made a roux before, but it was a piece of cake. The entire recipe was unbelievably quick and easy. For a less "chunky" gravy, I pulsed the completed gravy in the blender just a few times. This distributed more andouille flavor throughout and eliminated some of the onion and pepper chunks (which my husband can't stand)while leaving some meaty pieces intact. Make sure that you brown the pork in an oven-safe skillet-- transferring the skillet directly to the oven makes this recipe even more of a breeze!I served this with mashed potatoes, and the recipe made plenty of gravy for us. This is a keeper.

What a nice change of pace! We had a one pound pork tenderloin, halved the recipe, and left the loin whole. The oven time was 15 min. this way. The left overs were eaten the next day in corn tortillas with lime, cilantro, and goat cheese. Wonderful flavors ... we are on the zone diet so the gravy was out (for now!), but it was outstanding with a chimichurri sauce, used the one from Williams Sonoma Essentials of Grilling.

not good. a waste of a perfectly good tenderloin. the gravy didn't seem complimentary to the meat. and the flavor of the gravy was not impressive. the presentation of the dish was poor. i'd rather make the island pork tenderloin salad recipe featured on this site.

This was great! My andouille had been in the freezer too long and tasted funky, so I substituted precooked pork chorizo. It was spectacular with all those southwestern spices on the pork. I agree with another, you would need to make twice the gravy for garlic mashed potatoes.

My husband wasn't sure about this. He said the spices on the pork were too strong. I liked it. It took a few tastes of the gravey to really like it, but by the time I finished my dinner I learned to love it.

I thought this recipe was so-so. The gravy was much like gumbo base, in fact it is made the same way. The spices on the tenderloin were somewhat odd, to me. I followed directions exactly. My husband's face looked kind of funny when he tasted this odd recipe, and he said, "This is interesting." He tried the meat separately from the gravy, and he wasnt really impressed. I can think of other recipes that are so much better than this one for pork tenderloin. If anyone decides to make this, make sure you like cumin and coriander. Combined with the gravy, yuck. Oh, the gravy is good. I would make that again, but not with the pork.

The gravy alone is to die for, my guests raved about this recipe. I served the tenderloin and gravy with Couscous. A huge hit.

Mmm, pork and sausage. This was great, the only change I will make next time is to add less cumin. I must be particularly sensitive to cumin. I basically halved the recipe (except the gravy) and for a 1 lb. tenderloin it took exactly 7 minutes in the oven. I didn't roux-it for 20 min either, it was more like 10. Served with the parsley and lemon butter potatoes and goat cheese salad also on this site. We were well pleased.

While looking for a different way to serve a pork loin, I came across this recipe. The gravy in particular sounded really good. Well, I tried it and just about doubled the gravy recipe. Long story short, it was excellent. I had so much gravy left over that the next day we added more chicken broth and made a killer soup. You've gotta try this one!!

I love this recipe, especially for the gravy (sauce). I have made it with grilled prok chops, veal chops and intend to make it with chicken breasts...of course with pork tenderloin, as the recipe was intended, it is SUPERB....ENJOY!

Wow, was this good. I couldn't find andouille, substituted linguica. I used smoked turkey stock in the gravy too. Served w/garlic mashed potatoes, a big hit!

Excellent Sauce. It was wonderful over grilled pork chopes that we rubbed with the suggested spices.

This is a wonderful and simple receipe! The gravy is delicious and works well with rice on the side. For a less expensive version, use pork chops instead of tenderloin -- just cut down the cooking time a bit depending on the thickness.

This was delicious and easy enough to do during the week. I will however lower the cayenne pepper next time as it was a bit on the spicy side.

This was excellent. i love to cook with pork tenderloins and this is nice flavorful way of preparing them. It is quite easy to prepare except that stirring the roux does demand some attention but it is worth it for the flavor that develops.

Absolutely incredible! Enjoyed greatly by my guests! Comments were soft, and full of flavor, nicely balanced. The gravy recipe made a generous amount.

The group loved it, it was quick to make, except for the butter flour part (rue). I used half the sausage and a little less bell pepper and onion to compensate for the less sausage. Served white rice and flash boiled asparagus. Delicious.
