Rather than putting 2 cups of white flour, I put 1 cup of white and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Despite the feedback from other reviews regarding the mint: I like the tangy flavor of the topping.

I made this last summer and based on my notes, I loved it. Tried it again last week and it was a disaster. The mint was way too strong, to the point of being bitter. I think when I made it previously, I cut the mint back significantly and forgot to note it. Based on my success the first time, I think I'll try it again, and just use a bit of mint next time.

When I tried this recipe for my mother's birthday, I don't think it came out quite right... The biscuits were quite lumpy, it took me 25 minutes to bake, the dough was extremely sticky, and I couldn't really taste the lemon. However, they are edible and good enough, so I'm just going with it. I probably did something wrong, I suspect that being that I didn't melt the butter quite thoroughly enough, hence the lumpiness, but my advice is, if they come out unattractive and you're making them for an occasion, try simply garnishing the top with some of the topping, and maybe a few pieces of mint leaf.

I baked these as an end-of-year gift to my teachers, and they turned out fantastic! They looked and tasted simply gorgeous. I cut down on the amount of sugar in the topping, since 3 tablespoons was just outrageous. I ended up putting only about 1.5 tbsp of sugar in the topping, and even then it was really sweet. In fact, I think you can go without sugar completely in the topping, and it would still be wonderful. Other than that, I think this recipe is fantastic; I'd definitely make these again. It's easy to follow, straight-forward, and best of all, it requires only simple ingredients (I had all the ingredients on hand at home - no shopping needed!). Perfect to make in a pinch.

I would like to add that instead of using the butternilk, I substitued rice milk and they turned out wonderful - I didn't fuss with shaping them just plopped them on the cookie sheet and they were very fluffy...

Absolutely delicious and easy to whip together in a flash. I made them in a last minute attempt to compliment a Salmon & Grilled Asparagus dinner with guests and everyone loved them. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this recipe for my husband and my parents (who brought the strawberries fresh from their garden) and we all loved it! We especially appreciated the fact that the strawberries were not overly sweet like some strawberry shortcakes we've had. The shortcakes were extremely easy to make - like other reviewers, mine didn't rise as much as I thought they would but the hint of lemon was superb and very unique. I love fresh mint so I actually put a little more than 1/4 c. in the strawberry mixture and loved the result. I think the amount of mint to use is basically a matter of taste - if you love it, use the amount in the recipe (or add more) and add less if you are not particularly fond of it.

I loved the shortcake, but the strawberry topping was not great. The mint was too overpowering.

Hubby and I both loved this. Best tasting shortcake biscuits, ever, and I really liked the addition of pureed berries in the topping. My biscuits spread, but didn't rise; wonder if my baking powder is too old? We will enjoy dusting this recipe off next summer.

A very good recipe and very simple. I didn't have the buttermilk so I substituted using 1 cup of milk to 1 T vinegar. The lemon zest really added to the taste of shortcakes. I had also omitted the mint and added Marsala wine to the strawberries and decreased the temp to 375

Gave this recipe to my teen daughter to try for a brunch she was helping with. The recipe was easy to follow and she was the hit at the party. Had no problem with rising or browning, the biscuits were light, lemony and delicious. Using the mint sparingly was a good tip that she followed and we liked. She brushed melted butter and sprinkled with sugar just to give them a special look.

The shortcakes are great and the strawberries are SO good. I highly recommend letting the strawberries sit in the fridge for a day before serving them and stirring them every couple hours. I also had to use dried mint--three nearby gorcers were out of fresh--and they were still good! Can't wait to use real mint.

I actually recieved applause after making this dessert for my family and some friends. The biscuits were delicious--the lemon really gives them a nice flavor. My only complaint is that the bottoms get dark and hard. No one seemed to mind much but next time I will try baking on parchment and flipping them halfway through baking. The strawberry topping was good, but the biscuits would have been pretty tasty with just a little butter and jam. All in all, a good and easy recipe--and low cal too!

It's great to have a delicious lower calorie version of one of my favorite desserts. I made the biscuits ahead of time and reheated them in the oven. It worked well with the strawberries.

Didn't have buttermilk so I substituted heavy cream. The biscuits were delicious and moist. Took no time at all to make them! Will definitely make this again.

Brought this to a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Shortcakes were light and fluffy and easy to make. I added raspberries and blueberries to the strawberries and skipped the mint. The pureed strawberries were a nice touch. I topped with freshly whipped cream sweetened with vanilla sugar.

Served with fresh picked strawberries, and freshly whipped cream--it was delicious. Mine did not rise very much either.

I first made this in 1996 and it is a requested treat/tradition each summer. I have tried dozens of shortcake recipes and this is by far the most interesting (credit the lemon and mint~~though I go easy on the mint and use only as garnish) and the least laden with superfluous calories. Some cooks added whipped cream to the shortcake, but I feel that whipped cream dulls the flavors. So try it without; bet no one will miss it!

Made this as a special dessert for my daughter's birthday dinner. This is a terrific recipe, even for those not counting calories! The biscuits are a snap to make and absolutely delicious. If you have fresh local berries, no need to make the puree. Just slice the berries, sprinkle with a little sugar, toss with lemon. I rewarmed the biscuits in the oven just before assembling. Yummy on it's own, or topped with sweetened whipped cream. Three kids 7-14 loved it! Used the mint as a garnish to avoid complaints about green specks.

This recipe was great! A definite make-again. My whole family loved this. The subtle lemon flavor was just the thing to make this dish " beyond compare". It was so extremely easy to make, I could not believe that the turnout would be so great! Although, I have one disapointment. The bottom got a little burned, so the bottom half was tough and chewy. To prevent this error from happening to you, I would recommend greasing or spraying the pan with pam, butter, or a light cooking spray. Flip the shortcakes halfway through so that they get lightly golden, not burned. I put a spoonful of whipped cream on to make a lovely shortcake! Bon Appetit!

This recipe was a hit. I used very fresh strawberries, but did add the mint and lemon as called for with good results. I would err on using less mint though and would not put it into the strawberry puree. Mint overload! I increased the amount of baking powder on the recommendation of the cook below which did make the shortcakes rise more. This was good except they were no longer flat and didn't hold the berries. Not a big deal. The shortcakes did have a slightly bitter taste to them. I think it was the lemon peel? maybe the extra baking powder?

Very good and very tender shortcakes. The only 2 recommendations I would give are: mix the lemon zest with the butter and buttermilk mixture. If you mix it direcly with the dry ingredients it will clump up. Also I would cut down a bit on the sugar.

Shortcakes were 'okay', filling was unremarkable. Not a do-over.

this was such a yummy and easy to make dessert. I'll definitely make this one again with other fresh fruits like blueberries and raspberries.

I will not look at another shortcake recipe again. This one is just right. Easy too!

Outstanding! This was so easy and delicious. This definitely equals any shortcake I've had in a restaurant, with minimal effort. I only used strawberries and whipped cream as a topping...a must try!

Great shortcake. I hate to admit it but we always used bisquick to make shortcake and I was looking for a way to make them homemade--and this is it. We didn't add the mint to the strawberries either, don't think it would fly with the kiddos or hubby for that matter. Anyway I got what I came for, really yummy shortcake!

This is the easiest most delicious, tender, flakey shortcake.....I had no fresh mint, but I don`t think I would of liked that anyway, this is great with strawberries and I`m sure peaches would be wonderful also.

In my opinion, the star of the show is the shortcake biscuits. I added 3/4 tsp of baking soda to offset the citric acid and didn't have any problems getting them to rise and brown. I have also subsituted 1-1/2 T grated orange peel for the lemon peel in the biscuits and this also turned out well. We have excellent locally grown strawberries here in Oregon which do not require any sugar or other additives to be outstandingly delicious - so I omit the mint, citrus, and sugar when they are in season. When I can only get out of state berries I use the other additives to make up for the inferior quality.

Simple and very tasty. We actually enjoyed eating the shortbread all by itself because it was a great flavor and texture. Strawberries were okay but could take 'em or leave 'em.

I thought this recipe was generally good, and I liked the shortcakes, but I also found that they don't brown well. By the time they are golden on top, they're quite dark on the bottoms. I also didn't care for so much mint in with the strawberries. I took one person's suggestion and pureed the mint in with the berries. Overall, it seemed to work OK, but in the end we all tasted more mint than strawberry. Next time, I would cut way down on the mint (1/2 or less) or omit it completely.

The strawberry sauce was wonderful! I really minced the mint so there were little flakes all through the puree. I also added more sugar than called for. The biscuits were easy and good, but IMO nothing special, however, I will probably make them again, simply because they were easy and good! The mint really adds a fresh, bright flavor!

My family loved this dessert! The lemon adds a really nice touch. I made one slight change though, and to my surprise it was a good one! I did not put any lemon juice in the topping (I thought it would be too much), but I did add the left-over grated lemon peel (approx. 1 TBL.) to the whipped cream that I put on top. It was wonderful!

This is a very light dessert. The biscuits did not rise much and never really browned. The lemon was wonderful, as well as the mint. Next time I will use more mint- maybe puree it with the strawberries.

The best shortcakes my husband -- the world's #1 strawberry shortcake fan -- has ever had. The lemon makes them wonderfully fresh and light. I didn't put lemon in with my strawberries because I was using really good, fresh ones. And I did serve whipped cream. Incredibly delicious.
