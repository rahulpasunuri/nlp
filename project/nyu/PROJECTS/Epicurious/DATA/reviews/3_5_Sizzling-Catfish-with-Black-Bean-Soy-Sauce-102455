This was my first attempt at making whole catfish and it was outstanding! The sauce makes the dish. I didn't want to use so much oil and instead just heated a few tablespoons in the bottom of the pan - which worked fine. Since I wasn't frying the fish quite the way they said I just cooked it a few minutes longer in the oven. I also couldn't find the Asian beans for the sauce so I used about half a can of regular canned black beans. Tasted great!

We didn't make this dish, but whenever we are in Birmingham we stop at the resturant just for this awesome catfish.
