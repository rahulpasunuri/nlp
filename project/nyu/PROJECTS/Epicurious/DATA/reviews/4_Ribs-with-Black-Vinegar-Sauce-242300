I used Balsamic, so I won't rate the recipe but add that the ribs were still delicious! I had all the other ingredients in my cupboard and gave it a whirl. My husband asked if I could make them every day! It's kind-of magical how the sauce starts to cling to the ribs right at the end. If I ever remember to pick up some black vinegar, I'll have to try it that way, but it was so good I don't know if I'll bother!

I picked up a bottle of Koon Chun brand "Sweetened Black Vinegar" at my Asian market, not realizing they also make regular "Black Vinegar". (I thought they were just being descriptive, until I saw the other version on Amazon.) I haven't made this yet, but does anyone know the difference between the two vinegars, or know if they can be used interchangeably? Obviously, I realize, the difference is one is sweetened. But does anyone have experience or insight on how they compare in cooking, or just how different they taste?

I made this recipe as part of a multi course (8 courses) chinese new year meal. It served 8 people. Made it exactly as in the recipe and all my guests enjoyed it. If I make it again - I would make the following modifications - (1) use less soy sauce - it had too much soy sauce taste for my tastebuds. (2) decrease the sugar to 1/2 the amount. (3) Along with the black vinegar, add about a table spoon of regular rice vinegar.

Planning to make a Chinese New Year feast, I tried four different Chinese rib recipes. This one, the fourth, was the absolute winner hands down. I followed the recipe as indicated--no changes to ingredients or processes. Heaven. The only thing I did at the end was to put the ribs on a cookiesheet in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes to dry them a bit. Saved the wonderful sauce for later. Cannot wait to hear the moans around the table.

This is THE elusive sauce recipe that I have been searching for! It is the one served in a local Chinese restaurant using chicken instead of ribs. Made it with chicken thighs that were removed from the sauce when they were cooked through and kept warm while I reduced the sauce. Excellent!

Excellent recipe! Like others, I pan fried the ribs, and reduced the sugar by 3/4. Otherwise, followed to a "T" and they came out great. I used baby backs because hubby prefers them. One note: if you make this part of a menu, it yields 4 portions. If you make them alone, I suggest at least doubling.

I pan-fried rather than deep frying, used green onions since I didn't have any shallots, and used slightly less sugar than called for. I also used rose wine since I didn't have the shaoxing. I didn't have any low-sodium soy sauce, so I cut the soy sauce in half and added extra chicken stock. Turned out delicious! I don't usually like sweet sauces on meat, but the sweetness here wasn't overwhelming, and the sour and savory flavors balanced it out. I found there to be plenty of liquid, and I reduced it as called for in the recipe. I'm surprised that some people had the liquid burn away. Keep the lid on and keep the temp just simmering (medium-low) and it should be fine.

This recipe.is also excellent for wild boar ribs. I didn't fry the meat as wild meat tends to be dry. Cooked on low heat for an hour

I didn't deep fry, just pan fried to brown the ribs. Everyone in the family loved it. I little time consuming with the frying part but the flavour was very good. Will definitely make again.

These were fantastic. I pan fried instead of deep frying and probably won't bother with that again (just a long slow bake) Used the black vinegar and reduced the sugar slightly.

This sauce was GREAT. It is sweet, but DELICIOUS.

Fantastic!! At first I thought it was going to be expensive to buy the black vinegar and shaoxing wine but they were pretty cheap! The ribs turned out great. Next time I might add a few Thai chillies to give it a bit of a kick.

I had some left-over pork (not ribs) to use, so after adjusting for mass in bones and not frying in the oil but instead stir frying, I otherwise mixed the ingredients together more or less as instructed, plus some green onions I had lying around. Thus, my commentary and rating refer more to the sauce and less to the medium (pork spareribs). I thought the sauce was pretty flavorful, though I would add some red pepper. I did to the remainder of the batch after my first tastes, and it added something to the dish. Overall, the result was great.

Fantastic sauce!! I couldn't find spareribs so used short ribs instead with no problem. Also used balsamic vinegar and sherry as that's what I had on hand. I used a mix of thick, sweet (expensive) balsamic and a mid-range tart vinegar (didn't want to use a full 1/3 cup of the expensive stuff in case it didn't turn out!). I simmered for under an hour - had the gas on the lowest possible setting but any longer and the sauce might have burned as someone else cautioned. The serving size is probably about right too. I was skeptical that 2 lbs would feed 4 (with all those bones in place of meat), but the ribs were very filling. I served with brown rice and stir-fried bell peppers. It was a great dinner! Can't wait to make for guests!

Made it twice. Despite braising it for 1.5hrs, my pork ribs were still tough. It was probably over fried due to its small size. I found it a little bit too sweet. Would cut down on the sugar or add more broth next time. Definitely use reduced sodium soy sauce. Regular soy sauce is too salty.

WOW!!! This dish will floor everyone at your table! The flavors and textures are actually eye opening. 3 notes to add: 1) I tried this recipe with beef short ribs for a non-pork eating friend and, while the pork is definitely better, the beef works wonders in the mouth too! 2) Be careful that the heat is not too high during the simmering portion at the end, the ribs will be wonderful but the sauce may burn and separate into black tar and oil pools that are not appetizing. 3) Finally, give yourself an extra hour for this - unless of course you are an expert garlic/ginger slicer!

I followed this recipe to the letter (for once) and it was delicious. Next time I'll probably cook the ribs longer, perhaps in the oven. I just like my meat a liiiittle more tender.

Okay, I changed a few things in this recipe, but it was FANTASTIC! I can never be a gourmet because I don't like sweet taste with any meat, but in this case it really worked. I couldn't find the wine or the black vinegar, so I used sherry and balsalmic vinegar. My butcher was also out of spareribs, so I used baby back. It still was wonderful. My wife and even my 4-year old son were beside themselves. I am sending this recipe to everyone in my family and making it for the neighbors. I will say that I shortened the frying time to four minutes and the braise to 30 minutes instead of an hour due to the smaller ribs. I would like to hear any other variations that others tried.
