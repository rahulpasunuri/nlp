The basic mashed potato recipe is great for adding what ever you like, but the roasted garlic version was okay. I roasted about ten cloves for about 10 medium-smallish red potatoes. I think I should have kept the cloves together instead of separating them so I can just squeeze it out, because it was very difficult taking out the garlic from its skin when they were individual. I could barely taste the garlic, and it just stayed in its original form. I would recommend making it into a paste or give it a rough chop so it would be more incorporated and putting more garlic. Adding a little bit more butter and milk makes it more creamy and rich.

This was a good dish. I took others advice and roasted the garlic after cutting the top off and placing a little butter on top, then foil and roast. The potatoes were fine, but not too far beyond what I normally make. The roasting garlic in the oven smelled fantastic though!

This was delicious. I didn't realize that the foil should be wrapped around the garlic, so I had to scrap the first roasted garlic I made - but that was definitely my fault, not the recipe.

This was WONDERFUL!! I took another readers advise and used a whole head of garlic, cut the top off, roasted it, and then just squeezed out all the delicious roasted garlic right into the pan of mashed potatoes (this was quicker than peeling all those little sticky cloves too). I used red potatoes, real butter and 1/2 & 1/2, kosher salt and white pepper. YUMMY! I've made garlic roasted potatoes before, but this combination, in my opinion, is sublime. Served with delicious lamb chops, pinot noir reduction sauce and a root vegetable puree for our Easter dinner. Everyone raved!

The used this receipe for the family Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and we all loved it. I used 6-7 potatoes and one entire head of garlic. So simple.

I roasted a whole large head of garlic and mashed the potatoes by hand. The slight lumpiness gave the dish an earthy interest. They are great, a true comfort food for garlic-lovers!

Love it. I peel my garlic then put the whole roasted clove into the bowl -once mixed small dark specks of burnt garlic can be seen, gives it a natural, rustic look (a la vanilla bean ice cream). I also DOUBLE the quantity of garlic - this does not overpower the potatoes b/c the roasting softens most of the garlic flavor.

It was a little dry I had to add some 1/4 milk, and 2times the amount of garlic, 2 table spoons of butter.

I have a slight variation on how I make this. I usually take a whole bulb of garlic and cut the top off to expose the cloves inside, then put a spoon of button on top and wrap the whole thing in foil. Put it on the grill (you could probably do this in the oven, though I've never tried) upright for 20 or so min allowing the butter to melt down into the garlic and cloves to soften. Let it cool, then give the whole bulb a squeeze the soft cloves pop right out. This has allowed me to bypass the whole peeling process and everyone loves the results!

I used nearly a whole bulb of roasted garlic with 6 small Yukon Gold potatoes, along with 1/2 & 1/2, and a small amount of butter. They tasted great!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! I have been making a variation of it for about 10 years now. I would recommend using a head of garlic for every 1.5-2 lbs potatoes. In addition, I like to use yukon gold or red potatoes instead of russets. The red potatoes are fun because you can leave the skins on for a festive and textured look! Enjoy!

Very delicious but simple recipe. Using whipping cream or half and half definitely makes it more decadent, but if you're watching your fat/cholesterol intake you can always use skim milk and still have a very tasty final product. I love to include a rather hefty amount of white pepper to the potatoes too. I find this gives it an additional bite which my husband I love.

Good basic recipe, but definitely needs more garlic. Used heavy cream per previous review, and Yukon gold potatoes. Goes great with Turkey Meatloaf recipe from this site.

These were scrumptious. I added a tablespoon of fresh rosemary and 2 tablespoons of half & half. Quick and easy to make - definitely a keeper.

I use goat cheese and skim milk to mash the potato. Add some fresh herbs - like thyme or rosemary and you have a sure winner. As was mentioned before, don't be stingy with the garlic - who likes vampires anyway?

This reciepe is great! Instead of adding milk to the mashed potatoes I added half-n-half.

Great and simple to make. The basic potato mixture is similar to what I saw my parents doing in the kitchen when I was a child. The garlic flavor adds a new twist. I'll try some of the other flavor suggestions in the furture.

Will always mash roasted garlic in my potatoes from now on. Couple tablespoons of heavy whipping cream & butter work very well.

An excellent basic recipe for garlic mashed potatoes. I have taken to mashing mine in my Kitchen Aid mixer which works great. As others have suggested, no need to be shy with the garlic. It gets quite mild upon roasting. Enjoy.

Rating: 3
This roasting technique is foolproof. Do NOT be shy with the garlic! I did four cloves for a two-person serving, and really should have used eight. Be careful with additions like asiago or parmagiano - they can overpower the garlic quickly.

This was perfect. I had never roasted garlic before so I was nervous but there was nothing to it. I peeled the garlic before roasting so I could get the brown outside part in with my potatoes. I also drizzled olive oil over the garlic before roasting. Then I mashed everything up and put in a casserole dish, drizzled with olive oil again and sprinkled parmesean cheese. Baked it for 35 min at 350 as per a suggestion. Perfect. I used a whole head of garlic because I love garlic. Tasted great!

These are a very good change from normal mashed potatoes!! I will add more butter and less milk next time to make them more creamy.

Rating: 4
GREAT - used 10 cloved garlic drizzled with olive oil before roasting. Added some sour cream and lots of parmesan when mashing the potatoes. I had a lot of other things going on in the kitchen so I chose to make the potatoes very moist by additional butter and milk and place into a casserole dish. Drizzled olive oil over the top, sprinkled with parmesan and baked at 350 for 35 min until cheese was light brown. WONDERFUL I believe the comment to my husband from his uncle was "I don't need to worry that you're not eating well!" (we have been married for one year)

This is way yummy! I drizzeled a little black truffle oil on the garlic before roasting them and the combination of tastes just came out superb!

This recipe is so easy that I never expected it to be so flavorful. In my opinion, they come out much better this way than boiling the garlic in with the potatoes.

I had been looking for a recipe for Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes for a long time. I had first enjoyed them at The Keg here in Toronto. I made this recipe and it was a huge hit! I was worried about using TEN LARGE cloves of garlic so I used only about 5 and used Yukon Gold Potatoes. I would highly recommend using the TEN cloves and adding butter and milk as I did. Everyone RAVED about this dish! I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again, but will try red potatoes and keep the peel on them -- just like they do at THE KEG!

A very simple concept for a very delicious recipe. I've used fresh garlic in my mashed potatoes before, but never thought to roast the garlic first. I had them alongside the deviled fried chicken and fresh steamed spinach. A great comfort food meal on a cold, rainy October Sunday. Also, the garlic smells so good while it's roasting.......

Much better when you mash the potatoes and roasted garlic with warmed butter, 1/2 & 1/2 and freshly grated parmasan. Lots of garlic is required!

ohhhh, just divine with the recipe for Pork Cutlets with Figs and Balsamic Vinegar... I have made the Fig recipe with both pork and also with Frenched Lamb Chops (wonderful). Worth trying!

I do the same as the cook on 4/4/01,adding the whole raw garlic to the water while the potatoes cook, tastes great and SAVES ENERGY! Roasted garlic, my favorite food group, is the best, and when the oven is on I roast as much as I can. Just a FYI to those who would like to try a quick and easy way to have garlic mashed potatoes.

First, I have to say to Alice PLEASE don't sub pre-chopped garlic for fresh. not even close in flavor. This is a pretty good recipe, but if you are looking for REALLY EASY garlic mashed potatoes, toss a couple/few (depending on taste) peeled whole fresh garlic cloves to cook in the same water/same time as the potatoes. The garlic becomes mild and wonderful....just drain and mash as you would anyway...and the garlic flavor is great. not roasted, but still really good and EASY.

I have made this 2x now, and I don't think I can go back to regular mashed potatoes. My reccomendation is to use Elephant Garlic, 4 large cloves. It is milder and sweeter. MMMM.
