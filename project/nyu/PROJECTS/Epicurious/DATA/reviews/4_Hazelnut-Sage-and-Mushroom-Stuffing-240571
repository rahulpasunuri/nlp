I was worried it would be bland, so I nearly doubled the mushroom and added a fennel bulb chopped coarsely. Based on other reviews I used a bit less nuts, and kept them aside to the last minute to maintain their crunch. Also went lighter on the stock. The results were a huge hit, and really appreciated by my vegetarian guests.

This stuffing was amazing! So flavorful without being too heavy. I found it did not require nearly as much stock/broth as the recipe called for though - I put in 4 cups instead of 6 and it was still a bit to wet. I'm sure the hazelnuts would be nice but it was nearly perfect without them.

This was an excellent, solid stuffing recipe for our Thanksgiving table. I made this with the proscuitto-based turkey recipe also on epicurious, and added a little of the prosciutto butter to the shallots and celery while they cooked -- that was a nice addition.

Wow! This is the best stuffing I have ever had. Will be making it again and again.

Could do with WAY less hazelnuts - stuffing was good overall, but I was picking out the nuts as I didn't like to have that overpowering flavor and crunch in every bite... crunch every now and then would have been nicer. I vote for the Porcini Onion stuffing recipe on this site as #1 and will make that over this one any day.

Thought it was a little bit bland over all. It was much better as leftovers when left to get browner on top (I reheated it for 40 whole minutes in the oven at 400 degrees!) Would not make it again.

This stuffing was simply beautiful in taste, texture as well as aesthetics. Everyone of our guests raved and wanted the recipe. I made this stuffing as per recipe except added more of almost all ingredients: approximately double of sage, thyme and shallots, a couple more ribs of celery and about 5 ounces more of mushrooms. It was perfect and the flavors really came out. Also used chicken stock instead of turkey. I used an alternative to hazelnuts, macadamia nuts straight out of the shell. toasted in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. This added an extra dimension of yummy. This recipe is a keeper, every year I will make it again.

My family are all pretty picky, and they said it was the best stuffing they've ever had! I doubled the sage and instead of reducing the nuts like other reviewers, I "chopped" them in a blender so there were still small chunks for texture but most was finely ground so you still got the nutty flavor without too much crunch. I also made half with egg and half without for my brother who's vegan (he'll let butter slide), and both were great. The eggy one was just slightly stickier. Not that noticeable. Also, make sure to butter the pan well to avoid the bottom from getting too brown/almost burnt. Delicious!!

I followed this recipe exactly, except for not putting butter on at the end. I loved it and it was a huge hit. The only change I'd make next time is maybe using a bit less stock (1/4-1/2 cup less). It was really liquidy in the baking dish and could probably have been a little less soggy after baking.

We're not even really a stuffing kind of family, but this was amazing, we're making it again because all the left overs were gone by the next day.

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago and it has been a constant demand for the holiday menu! This is a tradition-making recipe.

This was light and tasty, but not stuffing-y enough for my taste. Next time I would add more sage and fewer nuts.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The texture was perfect. I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of white bread I used pumpkin quickbread that I let sit for several days until stale. I used a combination of creminis and fresh shitakes. I used rosemary instead of thyme. And I used about half as much butter as called for. The results were delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is I wouldn't chop the hazelnuts as small. They softened so much they were pretty much absorbed into the rest of the stuffing. I think leaving them in big chunks would preserve the flavor better.

The nuts gave this a nice flavor...I chopped them finely in a processor to smooth out the texture. Everyone loved this!

Several people at dinner said this was the best stuffing they ever tasted. I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and doubled the sage. It's great left-over, too!

This stuffing was the absolute best stuffing I have ever tasted! It was rich and delicious. Every flavour came together beautifully, from the shallots to the hazelnuts to the creminis! I will make this stuffing every single thanksgiving!

I usually don't enjoy stuffing, but this recipe caught my eye. I followed the recipe exactly and every guest thoroughly enjoyed the dish. There were many compliments and quite a few had large second helpings.

Everyone loved this stuffing! I didn't use all the butter. I used a little more then 1/2 a stick to saute the shallots and used the rest of the stick to dot the top. Stuffing was very moist and will probably use about 1/2 the broth next time.

I made this just as it was written and my guests loved it. I would do as some others suggested and increase the sage and maybe use just a bit less nuts (I used .5 lbs, I didn't measure out the volume)

Best dish of Thanksgiving 2007! I used 1/2 challah and 1/2 French baguette; used cooking spray to toast the bread crumbs; and used less butter than originally called for to dot the top. Delicious!!

I used vegetable stock and it still tasted really good, and I liked the texture a lot -- I think the eggs made a big difference. A new favorite (I'm a vegetarian, so stuffing is my "main dish" for Thanksgiving).

Wonderful. I used 1/2 loaf of salted ciabatta and 1/2 challah (since I had it for my pumpkin bread pudding also on this sight - great!). I also cut back on the butter and tried to use olive oil when possible. It was delicious.

This was a delicious stuffing and really light when I was done with it. I used only half a stick of butter and low fat chicken stock. It was still moist and delicious but not mushy which is just the way I like it.

Stopped at a neighbor's on the way home from Thanksgiving dinner and she insisited that I take a taste. WOW, it was sooo good. When she invited me to come for leftovers tonight, I was torn...too much food in too shorta time, but the dressing was calling my name. I am going and can hardly wait to have a real portion.

Really good, and nice to finally get away from the same old chestnut stuffing. I didn't bother adding eggs, and next time I think I would cut out half of the butter, but otherwise--yum!

I loved this one ! Only change I made was to cut the recipe by a third. It still would have served at least 8. Think I'll serve some of the leftovers with a steak, sounds good to me.

The only change I made was doubling the sage. This was delicious. I just heated leftovers in the microwave, which was also lovely. This is a new standard, which is saying a lot since I normally want sausage in my stuffing. Wonderful.

Oh, and I used a baguette instead of a Pullman loaf, which I could not find.

Mighty fine. Great flavor---not ordinary but not strange and not overpowering. I did not tamper with the recipe except I doubled the sage, added a little pepper to the mushroom mixture, and used less butter to dot the top. I love hazelnuts but I think pinenuts or cashews would be good, too. I baked it in the morning and reheated it before dinner which worked very well. It makes more than eight servings, but the leftovers are good.

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe precisely except I used olive oil instead of butter. Next time I will use chicken fat. I baked it in a very large oval baking dish and it looked gorgeous. Note, it yields at least 12 portions.

I made 1/3 recipe to stuff a chicken and had half left over to bake in a pan. The full recipe serves way more than 8. It's really good. Next time I host Turkey Day I'll make this but buy preshelled nuts. Shelling them is a pain in the @&#.

Made this for a big dinner party as a Thanksgiving dry run. Everybody (which included Mr. Meat and Potatoes and Ms. Sophisticated Goumet) loved it, so it's a go for Thanksgiving. I used only 1/4 stick of butter, but quite a bit of olive oil, as well as a whole grain bread. Everything else per recipe.
