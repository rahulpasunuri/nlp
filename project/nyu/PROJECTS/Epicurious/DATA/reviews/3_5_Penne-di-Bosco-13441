Made this for Valentine's dinner and it was awesome! I cut down on a little bit of the fat by doing half butter and half oil. I also used chicken stock instead of veal. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and it was delicious.

I made a small batch of this to try it out as a way to use truffle oil. The flavors were great. What I didn't like was the color of the dish. It has a homley brown color. Presentation is important for me. The color does not look appetizing.

This is a great dish! I halved the recipe due to limited porcini on hand, but inadvertently did not halve the soaking water...no matter, I put it all in and just gave it some extra time to reduce. I used portobellos and, like some other reviewers, beef rather than veal stock. Also, used gemili rather than penne because there was no penne in the cupboard, and we loved their texture with the mushroom sauce.

Very good and easy. Next time, I'll reduce the amount of porcini soaking water that's added to the reduction and toss in fresh tomatoes prior to serving.

Rich, flavourful, fabulous restaurant-quality dish. Boiling down the liquids is the key.

I have been dying to try this & finally had all the ingredients on hand. It was absolutely wonderful! It was not watery at all & was very flavorful. I think the key is to reduce the liquid sufficiently - and don't even think of omitting the truffle oil - it makes a huge difference.

I did substitute chicken stock for the veal, and used about half the liquid called for. It was still pretty watery, but the leftovers were great for lunch today! The porcinis and the truffle oil were essential; don't even think of substituting.

This was fabulous! I dont understand people who have the nerve to rate this recipe without using the proper ingredients 1)veal stock(only homemade please!It adds the thickness and richness) 2)Tuffle oil. These are an absolute must or dont even bother making this. This will knock your socks off-And I dont say this about too many recipes.

I agree with the other reviews - this recipe is missing something. I added some chopped parsley at the end, hoping to liven the flavor, as well as added chicken as another reviewer suggested. I am racking my brain to think of what is needed to make this a four!

This dish tasted fine (just fine, not fabulous). It came out pale lavender which really didn't appeal to me. It was hard to eat because it looked so strange.

I did not have fresh mushrooms, instead added green peas (frozen). It added a fresh taste and color to the dish and was totally delicious.

This italian pasta dish was better home made then going to any italian restaurant!

I have been waiting to make this, but could not find porcinis anywhere. Finally ordered some truffle oil and bingo found the porcinis. This was darned good too. While I was ordering the oil, I also ordered some good Parmigiano Reggiano. Thus I was not disappointed at all. (Sorry, I did not order veal stock! Chicken broth worked.) Served it with melon salad made with Manchego cheese, fresh basil and black pepper. For meat lovers, I browned some hot Italian sausage and baked these in the oven while bread sticks heated. This is not something to make everyday, but for guests it was special and made a delightful Sunday late lunch.

For an exotic, sweet-and-salt variation, replace the fancy funghi with thinly sliced pears and add a bit of salt and black pepper to offset.

This dish is excellent - even better the next day! I would recommend using the truffle oil if possible. It does add a lot of flavor and depth. I substituted chicken stock for veal without a problem.

I have made over one hundred recipes from this website and this is by far the best. I made it for a dinner party and everyone was blown away. It must be made exactly as the recipe describes. I always make it with chicken that I sautee in garlic, vegetable and truffle oil.

Delicious and rich, but the truffle oil is unnecessary. Truffle oil is best on simple, relatively bland things -- plain buttered pasta, potatoes, white bean soup, etc. -- and is overkill with this. The dried porcini are earthy and powerful enough to give the dish the complexity required. And the large quantity of red wine also gives the sauce a lot of depth. Like some of the other cooks, I didn't use veal stock because I didn't have it. Results were just fine.

Very good. Used beef broth instead of veal stock. Didn't use nearly as much cheese.Made 1/2recipe, but used all garlic and shallots. Did a taste test w/mushroom recipe from BA 12/99,which I loved the first time, but not the 2nd or 3rd, and this beat it.

Don't bother making this recipe unless you are going to soak dried porcini and use the liquid. I tried without, and although delicious, it lacked the necessary earthiness I was hoping for. Very hearty dish.

I loved this receipe, it contains mushrooms, cream,wine,garlic, all the goodies one generally keeps in the refrigerator. Didn't have veal stock, so sub with half chicken & beef. Delicious.

Delicious and even better as left-overs. The key is using the mushrooms specified. Portabella work great. I added chicken--it was devoured!

Not terrific--very bland. Expected much more complexity of flavors from this recipe--especially as it comes from the fabulous Restaurant 222.
