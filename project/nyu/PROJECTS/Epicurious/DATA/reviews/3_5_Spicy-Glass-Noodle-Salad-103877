This is a great base recipe for a spicy noodle salad. I always make it when I have left over roast chicken or pork and add them to the salad with the dressing ingredients. The combination of the sautéed garlic, cilantro, spicy pepper (I use habenero) and fish sauce is lovely & fresh. I also add basil or Thai basil when I have it, as well as thinly sliced red peppers, carrots & cucumbers.

Just wasn't that crazy about this dish. I'm not sure what the point of mixing the two proteins was but I didn't like that aspect. The flavors get lost. Also the seasoning lacked complexity that I am used to with Thai dishes.

We enjoyed this dish but I will make some changes when I cook it the next time. Beginning with the chicken and shrimp, which I will cook separately as they cooked at different rates, and would benefit from not being cooked at the same time. I added the chilies with the garlic to infuse the oil with both but will cook then a bit longer to reduce the bit of the garlic and enhance the bit of the chili. I used home grown Thai chilies which gave the added spark of color. The shallots were lost in the dish but will add them again if in stock. Garlic was to taste but I would have preferred a better measurement than 15 cloves which can vary based on the size and freshness of the cloves. All and all it was enjoyed by everyone and I will probably make this again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I agree with the other reviewers...the noodles only need to sit in the hot water for a short time. Also, I add chopped nuts on top (peanuts or cashews) for extra flavor and crunch.

I've eaten mountains of this stuff - from street vendors in Bangkok and restaurants in Thailand. While this recipe is fine on flavour, it does not deliver the texture that is so important to making this a fresh taste experience. The noodle preparation lead to a much gloopier concoction than what you really want for this. You want definition in the noodles - you want them to really be thread-like as they support the flavours. Instead, they form a kind of mass based on this preparation. You might want to skip the boiling step - pour some hot water over your noodles and let them soak. Check other recipes for other specifics but this ain't it.

Loved this. I made it for a girl's night and my friends loved it!! Flavorful and easy to make. I will make this again, for sure.

This recipe was delicious and I have been craving it ever since I made it. I agree with previous reviewers that the noodles should not be boiled, only put in boiling water to sit for the allotted time. I used more noddles and about half the chicken and shrimp that was called for. We had left overs for lunch the next day. It was especially great with sriracha sauce on it. Also, I omitted cilantro as I think it tastes like soap (personal preference thing) and used flat leaf parsley for color. Mmm... will make again as soon as possible!

This salad was really beautiful and tasty. I omitted chicken. Surprisingly, I used the full amount of garlic, but the dish was still perfectly balanced. I could only find pickled serrano chilies, but they worked fine. I served this dish with a cold cucumber, yogurt and mint soup, and we had cantaloupe with rosemary syrup for dessert; a great summertime meal.

I love this salad. It takes time to prep, but it is SO worth it. I add mint and chopped roasted peanuts. Prefer to use more shrimp, less chicken.

Made a few changes. Instead of chicken and shrimp, added pan-fried tofu. Sauteed whole garlic (lightly crushed), serrano chilies, and ginger in oil with julienned carrots. Removed garlic, chilies and ginger from oil. Added oil and carrots to noodles, basil, mint, and cilantro. Added roasted peanuts. Tossed and added fish sauce, brown sugar, and lime juice to taste. Great side dish!

This was good. Made the whole recipe for my husband and I as a main-course salad. It was plenty. I used only 8 cloves of garlic and found that it wasn't enough. Next time, I'll put in all 15. You need to add more fish sauce, lime, chilli according to taste. Adding veggies is ok but then it isn't like what you would get in Thai restaurants.

A great recipe that lends itself to variety and adjusting for personal tastes - a variety of different vegetables can be used.

What a great dish, and it's also quick and simple if you can manage to do the prep work in advance. Fresh fruit's a perfect complement to the spices and complex textures -- if the salad's served as an entree with seedless red grapes on each plate, it's quite beautiful. In fact, I would have rated this a four, but the recipe's very poorly written. Do NOT cook glass noodles! As other reviewers have pointed out, one should only cover them with boiling water, then immediately drain and rinse with cold. I also agree with those who suggested addition of grated ginger and other vegetables -- I used shiitake mushrooms & stir-fried carrots. This dish also requires tasting, tasting and more tasting, to get the spice blend right for individual tastes. (My husband can't take the heat, so to speak, so I added the minced chile in half-teaspoon increments & stopped a full tablespoon short of the recommended amount. Like another reviewer, I also reduced the amount of Thai fish sauce, and, finally, we like citrus flavors, so I increased the lime juice by 2 tablespoons.)

I chose to add some additional veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, red pepper), thankfully, because otherwise I think it would have been completely boring. I also decided to stir-fry the veggies instead of having them raw. Overall, I thought this was a lot of work for a dish that was just "okay" and lacked flavor. I will not make this again.

Simply put, I loved this recipe. It was simple to prepare, but complex in flavor and just very delicious! I agree with some of the other reviewers, you definitely don't need to boil the bean thread noodles. Just a soak in boiling water that's been taken off the burner is fine. I used 10 cloves of garlic, which I found to be perfect, even though I'm a garlic freak. I would imagine that if you didn't love garlic, you could easily get away with using less.

I used the listed amount of garlic, and it wasn't overpowering at all. as a previous reviewer suggested, don't actually boil the noodles...just place them in boiling water, take it off the heat, cover, and let stand for 3 minutes...that does the job just fine without gloopy noodles. Very yummy...I thought it was a little salty, so I'd probably use less fish sauce. I also added some stir fried carrots and snow peas and a touch of brown sugar to the sauce.

FANTASTIC recipe! I've made this twice now, first substituting the cellophane noodles for regular thai rice noodles (angel hair variety), and it's just amazing. Doesn't need as much garlic as is called for, but is still super-flavorful. The lime juice and cilantro really stand out... yummy.

Fabulous! I added fresh grated ginger and some salted cashew nuts for extra crunch, and it was just amazing. Try this!

I thought this recipe was fantastic! It was very bold and flavorful. I used sai fun noodles, but I made sure to soak them for at least 5 minutes and cook them for only 3- be careful not to cook them longer or they will be gooey. In the summer time, my friend and I throw the shrimp in some garlic, salt, and hot sesame oil-letting them 'marinate'. We skewer the shrimp and toss them on glowing coals for 4 minutes per side or until the shrimp are pink. (The shells should fall right off). The smokey flavor is a wonderful compliment to the other flavors. Also, when we are ready to serve, we add dried crunchy onions* to garnish (*found at asian markets)

This became a favorite recipe after I decided to substitute soba noodles or pasta for the glass noodles. I love the bold flavors and texture of the dish.

Great recipe. This has been my favorite sidedish to serve with yellow coconut curry. I agree in adding less garlic and less noodle, though.

A fabulous recipe! Delicious and fresh tasting. My husband had three helpings and he's not that crazy about garlic. I think the secret is not to overcook the noodles. Once they have soaked I put them in a pot of boiling water and take it off the heat and let the noodles sit for 3 minutes, do not boil or they will become globby.Also dont stint on the oil, it makes the dressing.

Very disappointed - not enough flavour would not make this again.

This is the first Epicurious recipe that really let me down. It just didn't work! the noodles were all globby and stuck together, which made it almost impossible to coat them with the sauce. (And I used a 3.75 oz package, not even the whole six that are called for!) Maybe I messed up on the measuring, but I found the flavors just really blah. I don't think we'll revisit this one.

Had trouble getting noodles to separate. Found flavors got crushed by the 15 garlic cloves. would use only 5-7 next time (and I LIKE garlic). Would like to try again - - need to go to Arun's when next in Chicago to try real deal.

A brilliant recipe as it works so well as a main dish to accompany a host of different salads. Vice Versa, compliments the Asian Flank Steak recipe you have as well. Once again, I must at least double the recipe for our family as even the kids enjoy this immensely and is so fresh and alive. This packs very well cold too! If you work in an office and pack lunch, it will irritate your mates with all of the garlic. It's great!

Fabulous recipe. I couldn't find the called for noodles, but used a ramen type noodle instead with much success. Lightened it up a bit by using less oil, as well. Definitely a do-over especially since going to the restaurant (Arun's) is too expensive to do regularly!

I've made this recipie twice now and loved it both times. it is very easy to make and delicious! I thought that there would be too much garlic but it was great as written.
