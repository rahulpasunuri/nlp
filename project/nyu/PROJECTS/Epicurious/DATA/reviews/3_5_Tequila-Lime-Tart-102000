I've made this recipe for colleagues, friends & family; all in awe! The fresh limes shine through tequila, to the point many (even Floridians) assumed it was key lime pie! I've used both Anejo & golds, the mildness of Anejo wins!

This recipe is incredible, it's an amazing tequila key lime pie, and the crust made from scratch is fabouls! Very happy about it. I used key limes and little bit less tequila.

This works if you use real Tequila - a 100% agave reposado. An anejo will have too much oak flavor. Gold tequilas are only 51% agave with lots of cheap added grain alchol and caramel flavors. That is why everyone has bad memories.And try key limes, they are more similar in taste profile to a true mexican lime.

I made this tart for a party. Everyone was eating it saying how good it was. When I tasted it myself, I spit it out! It was GROSS. Tequila toatally overpowers the lime. The egg whites made it very grainy as was mentioned in other reviews. When I asked the friends who were eating why they didn't say anything they said they didn't want to hurt my feelings, but that it was indeed gross.

Yum! Beautiful and easy! What else do you want from a dessert?! I increased the crust dry ingredients, crumbs to 2C.; pine nuts to 1/3 C.; sugar to 3 Tbsp.;butter I left the same. I like a thicker crust and in a 10" pan, it needs the sides, I also reserved maybe 1/8 C. mixture to garnish edges. For the filling, I was scared of the tequila once I smelled it!(I had just juiced 6 limes and it brought back memories of over indulgence!) I did not omit, just lessened the amount. I used 2/3 C. lime juice and filled to 3/4 C. with the tequila. The flavor was so very subtle. I also increased the egg whites to 3. After the tart had cooked for 20 min. I added the reserved crumbs to just the edge of the tart, like a border. As an added touch I mixed 1 1/2 C. sour cream with 2 Tbsp. powered sugar and used this as a topping. Great alternative to whipped cream. After the tart had cooled and chilled in the fridge for an hour, I filled in the middle with the topping, careful around the crumb border, spinkles of lime zest and a twist in the middle! Divine.

The taste was delicious! Just the right balance between lime and tequila flavors. However the bottom of the tart stuck to the pan. Next time, I would lightly butter the bottom of the pan.

Overwhelming taste of tequila. There are better lime tart recipes on this site. Mine did overflow, and frankly, the tart didn't even look that good despite following the recipe to a T

I made this tart for a party, using a regular piecrust, and people loved it. Definitely has more "oomph" than a regular key lime pie.

Maybe it was the lime juice - I used a combination of bottled key lime juice and fresh. The filling was bitter/sour rather than tart, and definitely not sweet. I can't decide whether or not to try it again, or just drink the tequila instead of wasting it!

I made this tart for a BBQ (sans tequila - my guests don't like the taste of alcohol). It was delicious and gone within 5 minutes! The pine nuts in the crust were really good, and I added another couple of tablespoons of lime juice to make it slightly more tart. Zingy, tangy, not too sweet.

Thought this to be a pretty tasty tart although certainly not a margarita in a crust. Eight key limes (smaller than cocktail limes) and a ten inch tart pan were just right. No overflow problem here! After baking I determined the odd taste was due to pignola nuts which had apparently sat on the shelf for too long (not much call for those in Iowa) and I had to throw the whole thing out. Will try again w/macadamias or even pecans.

I made this for a margarita party - what a hit! Tastes just like a margarita. I used ginger snaps and macadamia nuts for the crust, since that's what I had on hand, and it was great. I will definitely make this again. Only negative, I used a 9-1/2" tart pan, and it did overflow slightly, but didn't really affect the finished product. Two people from the party asked for the recipe - always a good sign.

I love this. I've omitted the whipped cream and instead decorate the edge of the tart with fresh blueberries. A hit!

This is a great recipe and works very well in a regular spring-form pan. I spread the crust up the sides about an inch, and the deeper pan had no overflow problems. I've made it lots of times, always to rave reviews. I use bottled key lime juice, and Cuervo gold tequila. I also tried it with lemon juice and Amaretto liqueur instead of the lime and tequila--delicious! I decorate with thinly sliced limes twisted into an "s" (1 per slice) and dollops of whipped cream between.

Wonderful compliment to Wild Mushroom Enchiladas on this site. Nice crust.

I made this tart because everyone had rated it 4-forks, so I thought it would be wonderful. It was good, but not great. Loved the crust and would use that for other pastry items. Filling was overly sweet for my taste.

A wonderful dessert. I used key lime juice and served with freshly whipped cream. Everyone who tried it went back for a second piece.

One of my absolute favorite recipes for summer! It's especially fabulous after bar-b-que. Rave reviews from all my guests!

How far up the sides of the pan should the crust be? (in a 9 inch pan) I'm especially curious because people have said that they have problems with overflow.

I thought this tart was wonderful. A few of my guests commented on the fact that the tequila taste was rather strong - some thought that was a good thing and some did not. I made twists from the limes that I then used to decorate the tart along with some fresh whipped cream. The recipe is very easy, which is definitely a plus. I think that I will stick with this recipe each and every time I want to make a key lime pie/tart.

Very good and easy. Reminds me of the great key lime pie that tastes so much better in Florida. Will be making this again!

I made this tart with key limes and it was a delicious end to a delicious 4th of July BBQ. The crust got rave reviews as well. I'm glad I went out and bought a 10 inch tart pan because I had no problems with spillage. Thumbs up!

Excellent! I also used the non fat condensed milk. My tart pan is 10 1/2 inches and seems to be the perfect size.

I thought that this is a great dessert. It is so easy and just the right amount of tart vs. sweet. My tart overflowed in the oven too but it came out o.k. anyway. It was actually better the next day! F.Y.I. I took the recipe out of the magazine issue not online and the recipe did not call for 10 limes!

Rating: 3
It came out nice & light. 10 limes must be a misprint - it only took 3. I substituted nonfat condensed milk and it still tasted rich. The pine nuts in the crust is a nice touch, but I had a problem with the crust. It didn't come out solid enough to remove the bottom part of the tart pan without splitting the filling.

Delicious pie. A little sweet, but I guess that is to be expected with most recipes containing condensed milk. I liked the pine nuts in the crust.

I enjoyed this tart very much. I'll probably use a little less butter when making the crust next time. My filling did overflow a little in the oven, but I may have used a 9" rather than 10" tart pan. A great summer dessert.

The Tequilime Pie got raves, however I was curious to know what I should do with the remaining eight limes (the ingredient list calls for 10 limes and the recipe needs only 1/2 a cup). I would give 3 1/2 forks if it were allowed.
