I just returned from Israel and have been craving eggplant dishes like the amazing ones I had there. I like the simple preparation for this very flavorful dish. The fresh dill really brightens it up! I took the advice to use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and that worked well. Definitely recommend this dish.

This was "good" (two forks = good), but my husband didn't like it and there are better things to do with eggplant.

I would cut down on the garlic and cook the eggplant about 10 minutes longer than the recipe says. It was a great salad the day of and several days after being made. Everyone I shared it with liked it.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have never really thought of eggplant as a good food to eat before, but I am addicted to this recipe and make it at least once a week. My husband loves it, too. I make it exactly the same as the recipe... the fresh dill and garlic really make it great.

This recipe is a keeper! Subsituted balsamic vinegar and used red onions. Sliced the garlic cloves in halves to bring out the garlic flavor. Did not have cherry tomatoes on hand, so diced a couple red vines into chunks and worked out just fine. Needed some salt and pepper. Tastes great at room temperature. A great side dish during your summer grilling. This dish compliments a good bottle of wine!

Great way to use summer vegetables. Used what was in the garden (zucchini, crook-neck squash, green peppers, red onion, yellow tomatoes) and dried herbs. Very tasty, even the kiddos liked it. Will make again. . .might try fresh rosemary next time.

I really liked this recipe -- letting the salad sit for a while definitely helped pull it together. It helped that the cherry tomatoes I had were very good. I didn't have enough eggplant, so I roasted some fennel I found in the fridge and threw it in, too. It was a nice variation.

A little bland but an excellent way to serve eggplant especially to the new eggplant diner.

Great recipe! Substituted wine vinegar for balsamic and added the juice of half a lemon. Chilled in the refrigerator and served with warmed lavash bread. I would consider adding pinenuts (or finely chopped walnuts for a Gerorgian touch?) for some texture next time.

Easy, delicious and a big hit with guests when served as an hors d'oeuvre with warm pita triangles.

I was looking for a recipe to make for a neighborhood July 4th picnic. I'm so glad I tried this before the picnic. The appearance was terrible. On a buffet table I'm sure it would be passed up and I would have ended up taking it home and throwing it away. Flavor was OK but not exceptional. Will not make it again.

This recipe was fantastic. Very simple to prepare. Authentic flavor. The roasted garlic and fresh herbs are really key to its success. The second time I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and liked it even more.

Since I have traveled to and lived in Morocco for quite a while (married to a Moroccan), I know how the food should taste and my husband and I agree that this dish is pretty close to the eggplant salas his mom makes.
