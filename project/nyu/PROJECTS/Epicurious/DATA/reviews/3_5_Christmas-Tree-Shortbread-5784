I use this recipe every year and make these cookies for the holidays. While they do require some work and patience, they are well worth it in the end. One tip I found, is if you use 3 and 1/2 cups flour vs. 3 and 3/4 cups flour, the dough is not as dry and easier to work with. When you bake them, take them out as they begin to turn color.

This is a cookie swap favorite. If these cookies are bland, then you've done something wrong. These should melt in your mouth!! A must have every holiday.

I just made these cookies for our traditional "Christmas in July" dinner and wow, these are so good and look spectacular. These will be top of my list when I make cookies this Christmas. Didn't change a thing! Used different flavors of jam though (raspberry, strawberry and peach)

These cookies look great - very impressive - BUT VERY BLAND. I rate my cookies by how they taste rather than how they look, so would not make these again.

I'm a cookie fanatic, so I've tried lots of recipes. This cookie recipe was "okay" not great. But it did look very pretty when I wrapped it and gave it out as Christmas treats.

I used lemon extract instead of almond extract. Also used a lemon glaze- about 1 tbsp fresh lime juice, 1/4 tsp milk and powder sugar until I achieved the desired consistency (like a sour cream). 4 forks was the rate from everyone I asked to rate them! Worth the effort, I individually wrapped them and gave them as gifts

Terrible! This is essentially sugar cookie dough. I had to add a lemon glaze to the top of the cookies to make them taste like anything.

I often make several cookies and candies and give them to friends as gifts at Christmas time. All of them are good, but this is the cookie that always receives the most positive comments. It is kind of hard work with all of the cutting and matching up. They are delicious, though. I also recommend putting the jam on the cookie *after* you put the second cookie on top. Otherwise, I had trouble with the jam running out the sides.

I made this recipe for teh first time this Christmas and it has turned out alright. I rpefer Mrs. Fields Cookbook shortbread recipe for taste. Instead of cutting out pieces and placing them one on toip of the other, I made the shortbread on its own and dipped it in raspberry chocolate. Next time Ill try out the suggested raspberry jam, I just didnt have the time for that this time around. Happy holidays!

Just made these for my "first" round of holiday baking and they are WONDERFUL! Wouldn't change a thing from the recipe. Have already decided to make these at least one more time before Christmas. (And Valentines Day, Easter, etc etc)

I made the cookies and icing in 1998 and my family keeps asking for them! WARNING: They can be addictive! : )

Very delicious and easy to make. Made the dough and left it overnight in the refrigerator. Baked it the next morning for a Christmas party that afternoon. Everyone loved it. There wasn't one cookie left.

The recipe was way too dry even after we cut the amount of flour back for the second batch. We had to add water to the dough in order to successfully roll it out. We put colorful snowflake bits on the corners and won the "most colorful cookies" award at our departmental bake off. It was a lot of work!

A wonderfully simple, yet delicious recipe. All my friends loved these cookies. Packaged up in festive tins, they make great little gifts.

The Almond Icing recipe is a link. Just click the words "Almond Icing" and you'll be taken to the recipe. When words are underlined on web pages, that usually indicates the words are a link to something related to the underlined words. Good luck!
