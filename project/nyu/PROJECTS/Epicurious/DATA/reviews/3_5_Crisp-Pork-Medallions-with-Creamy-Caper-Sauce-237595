Very easy, very yummy. We get two tenderloins and make extra medallions because, leftovers. I find the sauce overwhelming to the meat (much as I love yogurt and mayo and capers) and we often stick to lemon wedges instead. The only thing I change in this recipe is to use a metal grid in the baking pan so the medallions aren't resting on the metal and getting mooshy on the bottom. Highly recommended.

We were totally underwhelmed with this recipe, especially after reading so many rave reviews. The sauce was bland even with increased capers and parsley. Any day of the week I'd skip the fuss and grill instead!

Dee-lish. My husband and 4-yo son loved this. I added a couple of squeezes of fresh lemon juice to the sauce. We will definitely be having this again!

Loved it. I used Fage greek fat-free yogurt and it was fabulous (sauce was more of a thicker, dip consistency, though). I also added a bit of the brine the capers were in and a couple of drops of lemon juice to the sauce. The pork was excellent except I think the pork I purchased was not a 'medallion' (they were labeled cutlets but they were tough).

Delicious, Milanese-style preparation of pork tenderloin medallions. Just the right amount of frying and baking resulting in a juicy, springy pink center, a resilient, crisp coating and lots of flavor. The caper-yogurt sauce perfectly compliments together with a nice cool glass of Slovenian Jeruzalem White Sauvignon.

We really liked this. It was a nice way to mix up the usual pork tenderloin uses. The only criticism I would have is that in order to get enough same-sized medallions from a small tenderloin (like the kind at Trader Joe's or the kind that comes in a two-pack), you have to use two tenderloins and save the tails for another use, which is what we ended up doing. The squeeze of lemon on the pork at the end was essential. The sauce is terrific and the leftovers were good with some blanched green beans and asparagus.

Very good and easy too. I used panko for extra crispiness. The sauce was great!

I only have myself to blame... I was hungry for a WARM mustard- caper sauce under pan-seared pork tenderloin medallions and didn't read the recipe closely: this sauce is served cold or room temp. It was good, maybe perfect for warmer weather, but not what we had in mind. So: passable, but not nearly as good as other options on this site. goodbye to a beatiful $17 tenderloin.

Served on a bed of watercress with slivered red onion. Not your run of mill pork.

I definitely agree with doubling the capers. I also added more salt and mayo to taste. medallions were great. A little bland, but i sprinkled the meat with lemon juice and salt before putting the sauce on. it got 2 forks from my SO, but got rave reviews from my work.

quick and easy. The sauce is spectacular. I also used Panko & added 1/4 tsp of dried thyme to the flour for a lighter finish to match the light sauce. Placed on baby lettuces and served with truffled roasted yukon potatoes. Perfect for dinner parties!

This is my husbands all time favorite! I always double the sauce ~ it seems to go so quickly. I double the capers per each batch of sauce and add lemon. Also I always use Panko breadcrumbs for a lighter breading and serve Watercress on the side. Will make again and again!

Made it for the first time for a dinner party with very good results. To avoid "overgreasy" pork, the medallions spent some time on paper towels before going into the oven. Also Panko bread crumbs were used.

This was fabulous. I made the pork medallions as directed. I changed the sauce to a Whole Grain Mustard Aioli. It was snowing hard today and my goal was to make dinner with ingredients on hand. The pork was tender and crisp, not oily at all. This will become regular and I'm anxious to try it with the original sauce.

Absolutely delicious and a favorite of friends and family. Made several times now, always adhering to the recipe (no reason to deviate). I do recommend the best plain yogurt you can find: Greek (best)or CanadianAmerican yogurts redefine "bland." Serve with any green vegetable (roasted brussel sprouts are a good accompaniment; so are baby limas), as well as a starch if desired: Italian-style pan-fried potatoes or french fries are good with this.

Excellent. A great new way to do pork tenderloin. Can imagine with other sauces (creamy mustard?) as well, but we loved the caper sauce. I used panko for the crumbs. I think using enough oil is what made it easy to cook and so crispy. Usually I would try to just cook something like this in minimum of oil, but I went with the 1/4 inch, and it was definitely worth it. I also served with a mango salsa, as mentioned below. Great combo on top of arugula. I also cut them a little bit thicker, just over 1 1/2", because they squish down after you've cut them. The thickness is what keeps the centers from being overcooked, while the outside gets brown and crunchy. I don't write reviews very often, so when I do, it's for a real keeper.

Moist and delicious! Very easy to prepare. Used panko bread crumbs and half the oil called for. Not a crumb was left. Good for everyday or for company.

What a great recipe. The pork was tender and moist, and the sauce was fantastic! Somehow I forgot to serve the lemon wedges and it was still great, although I won't forget them next time for that little extra tang.

An excellent recipe. Use enough oil to coat the pan and sear on high heat - you won't get the soaking in. A combination of lemon juice and the sauce was excellent

Delicious is an understatement! A little work involve but really, really worth it. And Do NOT leave the lemon on the side! It adds an extra umph to the sauce. This is definetly a dish for special company too!

Made this dish last night and found it to be absolutely delicious. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs which I feel helped with flavor. I served this with a mango salsa that had serrano chiles, diced red pepper, diced red onions, lime juice, honey, garlic, and fresh mango. I liked the contrast of the sweet/hot salsa with the breaded pork. This one is a keeper.

After reading the previous reviews, I decided to season the medallions prior to breading. I used a creole seasoning. Then I breaded and fried in Light Olive oil. To ensure that the breading did not soak up too much oil, I browned them on med high heat. I thought the meal was really very good. Lemon zest would be a very nice addition.

I am also perplexed by those who seem to love this dish. I made this for my husband and I and was completely disappointed. This dish tastes only of oil, and I used less than the 1 cup to fry. Then the sauce barely tastes like anything and cannot cover the oil. I will not make this again.

I am surpirsed to see so many favorable reviews of this recipe. I followed it to the letter and it was just flavorless and dull. Since I served it for a dinner party it was pretty embarrassing. Nobody finished it.

This dish was absolutely wonderful. Easy to make and delicious. We also used panko breadcrumbs and served it over arugula. We added a bit of shallot vinaigrette to the arugula and some lemon zest to the caper sauce. The flavors mixed so well - the perfect spring dinner.

Really enjoyed this recipe - will make again. Served on my own Watercress Salad recipe. Yum. Not sure if I'd bake the medallions again - will try frying only next time to save washing extra dishes... We thought sauce could have used a bit more zip - maybe some tabasco, possibly some lemon or lime.

Nice different way to serve pork tenderloin. I did use panko crumbs and greek yogurt for the sauce as it was what I had on hand. It was a lot lighter than I would have expected with the breading, frying, creamy sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Pork is my favorite and I love capers. I would make it with chops instead of medallions

This is the first time I breaded pork medallions and they were awesome! The caper sauce was very refreshing and my husband loved it!

This dish was really good! I loved the sauce and I doubled the recipe for it. I also added some green onion to the sauce. I used arugula and also made rice to go with it. I used butterflied pork chops because I couldn't find the pork tenderloin. I will definately make this again!

One of the best recipes I've made. I totally agree with the other reviewer who was suprised by the amount of flavor given the seemingly simple ingredients. Don't forget the watercress--it really makes the meal, especially when eaten together with the pork and a generous amount of the sauce.

Made this dish tonight, using panko bread crumbs and served over arugula. The pork was very juicy inside the crisp coating and I loved the tangy caper sauce. Will do again, I am sure.

Super easy and surprisingly flavorful, despite the plain ingredients. I recommend it.
