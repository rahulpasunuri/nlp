Super delicious! Made it without the brain-boosting broth and it was great, can't wait to try it with the broth!

Yes, there's a lot going on here. The end result yielded a hearty, flavorful recipe that got me out of my "rut". I'll probably add this recipe to my repertoire and play with variations. Pluses: there's room to improvise here. I didn't use the brain broth recipe. I didn't even use broth. I used water and yellow miso only. I know. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of Roma. I used dried sage instead of fresh. Minuses: for me the cook times were off; my lentils were too soft, sweet potato a touch under done. Definitely operator error. I am looking forward to using this again, though!

Believe it or not, I got to the end of the recipe and discovered I didn't have miso. So no, miso and I cheated and used organic veggie soup mix instead of brain broth. It came out great. The sage gave it a little surprising zing and the sweetness from my one sweet potato was perfect. I needed much less time than written to cook everything. My toddler loved it, too. (He has a sophisticated palate for his age.)

Based on the others' comments I substituted low sodium chicken broth and omitted the sage. I also substituted white miso with 1 tbsp of doenjang (Korean miso paste) and 1 tsp of gochujang (Korean red pepper paste). The end product was sweet, but balanced by a more earthy and spicy flavor which was quite unique. Next time I will omit the celery (not sure that it adds much) and add all the broth to the lentils and cook the lentils only slightly ahead of the rest of the ingredients, as the lentils had completely dissolved away.

I am curious how sgamblin came to the conclusion that this stew acted as an anti-inflammatory (as if he/she empirically experienced this), as the doctor I asked about anti-inflammatory foods laughed the idea off. Anyway, I enjoyed this quite a bit, but felt it wasn't perfect. I did not find it sweet (my sweet potato was kind of old, and took a bit longer to soften)... I believe I did everything as suggested. I made the broth, and it was indeed a lot of prep work, but at least there is plenty of it to use for future soups. I think it was worth the effort, as it made the stew very flavourful. I use bouillon cubes sometimes but I feel like that is cheating, but I prefer recipes that don't call for pre-made broth (I'd much rather cook everything into the same soup and not have to deal with bland boiled vegetables that you are apparently supposed to discard but I don't want to waste). The initial bit of water with the lentils evaporated and they were stuck to the pot until I added the other stuff an it unstuck, and I don't really see why they don't just add all the broth at once. My lentils weren't visible in the end product, unlike the picture.

I agree with other reviewers that the combinations of flavors is odd. To cut through the cloying sweetness of white miso and sweet potatoes, I garnished generously with lime juice, cilantro and schiracci. Then I found it delicious. This dish made my head feel clear and acted as an anti-inflammatory.

I tried to like this. I did like the flavors of sage mixed with miso and nori but against the background of boiled onion stoup, the tasty couldn't compete with the nasty.

Sounds good, but all the kale I've seen lately would require at least 15-20 minutes' simmering to tenderize it enough to eat. Also, the "Brain-Boosting Broth", while it sounds delicious, also sounds unnecessarily complicated. I don't have a cadre of prep-cooks to do all the rough work.

Good basic recipe--I don't like Nori, so left it out and added a little tamari instead. I also added some sweet smoked paprika and cut back on the sage.

3.5 forks. I substituted vegetable broth with some ginger and rosemary in it for the brain broth, and also made a bit of a mistake and added all of the broth/water in at the beginning. The result was a tasty and filling soup.

Not a fan.

This was a good recipe, it was much sweeter then I had anticipated. Very colorful delightful dish. I would likely make this again, but next time I'd use vegetable broth instead of the "brain broth" (It'd cut down cooking time quite a bit). The nori is a very nice touch - a must have.
