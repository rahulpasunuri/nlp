I didn't make the whole salad but used the vinaigrette on a mixed green salad with shrimp, walnuts, speck and shelled edamame with a risotto pancake. Loved the orange in the dressing!

This salad was a big hit a a dinner party last night. Light, refreshing, delicious, and easy to make. But the accompanying picture of the composed salad is very misleading. I followed the recipe, and served this as a tossed salad, adding toasted walnuts. I had a beautiful head of endive from the farmer's market, and fresh oranges from my own tree. Omitted the begian endive, as I didn't have it. Yum!

This salad was delicious. I used 1 naval and two blood oranges for the color. If purple endive had been available, I would have used that as well. Just note that the the salt and pepper are not listed with the other ingredients, but contained in the text describing the steps. Also, while the photo is beautiful...it is not the salad described, which was gorgeous in its own right. This salad is going to become part of my permanent repertoire.
