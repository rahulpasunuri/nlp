I live in Oklahoma City. I have had the lamb fries at Pete's and the calf fries at Cattlemans. The lamb fries were better. IMO, Cattlemans is over-rated. Eddy's has better steaks.

Calf fries are also available at Cattlemen's in Oklahoma City. I'm reminded of the time I was recommending restaurants to a visiting Californian. She had never heard of calf fries so to be more descriptive I said they were "calf testicles, calf balls." She heard cat balls! No wonder she was horrified! Calf fries are tender but bull fries tend to be tough.

Nasty and chewy and off-putting. Next thing we know - we will be chewing on Mc Balls

This recipe was bogus. First off, the only testicle worth eating is panda bear and that is a straight up well known fact dude. Third, It was delicious. I am still from france.

Lamb fries are a specialty of Pete's Place, in Kreb's, Oklahoma. Being from the East Coast, I had never heard of such a thing, but I had to keep up my reputation as an omnivore, so I tried them - absolutely delicious - a little like calamari.

YUMMY! They taste just like chicken! Here, Angus, put some lemon on them puppies.

I didn't think I'd have the "Fries" to try these, but life is a oneway passage
