My german mother made these with yankee pot roast and sour cream gravy. She sauted any stale bread, waste not/want not, shool of thought, very German, in a few T of good butter, as opposed to this recipes method

I've made German potato dumpling(Kartofelkloesse) for years. I learned from my mother who came from Cologne. I can't believe this recipe calls for 1/2 cup of cornstarch - gag me! You shouldn't need but maybe 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons! The bread cubes should be fried in butter or toasted under a broiler too. Also, as a matter of personal choice, the dumplings are better if the potatoes are pressed through a ricer while hot, not mashed. It gives a nicer texture. The size of the balls should be something between a golf ball and a tennis ball. Other than these modifications the recipe is fine. Also this is usually served as a side dish to hearty meat & gravy main courses.

I grew up in Bavaria, where these dumplings are a staple. There is too much cornstarch in these, and consequently, they're too heavy. I would make these again, but use more potatoes, less corn starch, and about the same amount of flour. They are GREAT as leftovers when they are sliced in 1/4" slices and fried.

This delicious recipe was easy to follow! It is really "comfort food". I served it with garlic studded pork roast and my family just loved it. These dumplings were almost as good as Mom used to cook them back in the old Country.
