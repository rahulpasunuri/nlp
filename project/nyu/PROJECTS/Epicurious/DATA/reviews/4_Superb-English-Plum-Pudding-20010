I used a mixture of sultanas, currants, prunes, figs and mixed peel. I also added some fresh lemon zest. Soaked it for a week in brandy. I got fresh suet from the butcher. Next time I would use a little bit less. I made 2, 2L puddings. One was perfect, the other was very oily. I ate the good one the day after cooking. I'll keep the oily one until Christmas and hopefully it will dry out a bit. I have never made pudding before, but will be doing it again every year from now on. I made a vanilla custard and brandy butter to go with it. It looked amazing plated up, flambéed with warm brandy. One of my proudest moments!

Here we are at March 13th, and I'm reporting in on the three month test pudding. Was late in getting to the plum pudding this past year, and only got them done on December 13th. This is the second year using this recipe, with a few tweeks, and I can't see a reason to move away from it. The flavour and texture of this test pudding was lovely. Even at Christmas it was great, but it was a little too "fresh". Modifications were reduced citron peel and raisin amounts in favour of candied cherries and chopped dates, and the addition of chopped walnuts. Did a triple batch so will have a great supply of well aged puddings for this Christmas.

This review is for those having trouble finding suet. The easiest way to acquire the suet is to order it online from the British company Atora. Their suet is pre-chopped and keeps at room temperature for well over a year. A quick Google search will pull up their product (both real and vegetable suet varieties). The cheapest site by far to order the suet from is Amazon. I purchased two 8 oz boxes of suet through Amazon for $11 (only $4 shipping from the UK to the U.S.!). Other sites charge $20 or more for shipping so stick with Amazon. It is important to order well in advance of when you plan to make the pudding. My order took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive and the shipping estimate was up to a month from ordering time. But, considering the price and convenience of finding such a troublesome ingredient, it was worth the wait!

Hi. If we take the recipe at its word and cook well in advance of Christmas, and we give the pudding "a dash of cognac, cover it with foil and keep in a cool place." Is that 'cool place' the fridge or a pantry cupboard? Just took the puddings [three from the recipe quantities!] from the oven and they look/taste fabulous... cheers/thanks Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Superb-English-Plum-Pudding-20010#ixzz1hQ2WGdQT

I don't review often, but this is an unusual recipe for today's cook, so I'm sharing my experience with this delicious plum pudding. I had never made one before and had only eaten the store-bought kind, which I think taste "off." I followed this recipe closely with only a couple of changes. My family doesn't care for citron, so I substituted some preserved pineapple. Also, I used a very high quality brandy, instead of cognac. For suet, I used the Atora product, which I ordered online. The result was really, really good. After letting the pudding age a few weeks (during which I sprinkled some extra brandy a couple of times,) the pudding was served with a creme anglais sauce. (Any nice vanilla dessert sauce would be great.) Everybody really loved it! This recipe makes a lot of pudding. I filled a number of basins of various sizes. It's a really fun, tasty dessert to have tucked away in a pantry, ready to bring out whenever a special sweet is wanted. It was a long process to make and steam it, but then the puddings are there, ready whenever you need them. All in all, another awesome James Beard classic.

I used butter instead of suet because I don't like the idea of using suet. I served with vanilla- flavored hard sauce from Fanny Farmer cookbook. I took the "bowls or tins" to mean these were to be in single serving-size dishes. I did that, but it made for quite a lot more work than putting it in a larger mold. My only problem with this recipe taste-wise was the bitterness that came through from the candied peel. (Used store- bought, but not sure fresh candied peel would have made much difference, as it can be bitter, too.) I think next time I might try the Joy of Cooking recipe, which has the optional addition of using chopped dates but no candied peel.

I make my own plum pudding every year because I am gluten intolerant and have to use gluten free breadcrumbs. I'm an old hand at doing this and my plum puddings are a highlight of our holiday meal. But we moved a couple months ago and I couldn't find my recipe. So I tried this one. I always make a few mini puddings because the two pudding molds I have always leave me with more pudding than fits. So I steamed them all yesterday and we dug into the minis last night. I have to say this was the best plum pudding I've ever maade. I made an adjustment in that I used light butter instead of suet--I got the Trader Joe's brand in a tub. It was fabulous and the best part was that we didn't lose any flavor but we lost that "ugh" feeling you get 20 minutes after you've eaten it. Amazing. And instead of using candied peel I chopped up some candied ginger. It was beautiful.

So, being a proud and unabashed fruitcake lover, decided to give this a go. I made a Christmas pudding over 20 years ago and wanted to see if I could do it again. Made this for a port tasting and dinner with a group of friends - the recipe was plenty for two 6 inch molds (one for the dinner and one for my family) and 5 pint jars gifts for like minded fruit cake lovers. Added some dates, figs, dried tart and sweet cherries as well as some prunes. Got the dried fruit from www.nutsonline.com - the fruit came less than 24 hours after ordering and even the citron was tasty. Added some cointreau and butter as suggested - also added a quarter cup of ginja (Portuguese cherry liquor) and a little port along with the brandy. Ground the suet in the food processor with some flour as suggested and kept it very cold (froze it in the great outdoor freezer). It turned out great - flamed it, turned off the lights to get the full Christmas Carol effect. Served it with brandied hard sauce from Fanny Farmer - it was lovely and went great with the various ports (white, ruby, tawny, LBV or vintage - all worked well). Looking to forward to how it tastes after being fed brandy for a couple of weeks (may even keep one longer to see how it works out).

I made this in Bangkok, beginning three days before eating. While aging the plum pudding is great, the twenty two people who ate it, including a number from England, Ireland and Scotland, and most, with sixty plus years of memory, seemed close to unanimous that this was the best pudding they'd ever had, steamed the day of eating. I did add a 1/2 pound each of dates, prunes, plus a cup of flour, 1/4 lb of butter, and a half cup of Cointreau.

I have made this recipe many times over the past 25 years and anyone who loves plum pudding begs for it at Christmas time. I try to make a double or triple recipe and freeze 8-10 cakes so that every Xmas I can defrost a couple, drizzle them with cognac and they are ready to go, better every year. The cognac hard sauce is excellent on top. I am making a new batch for next year as I write.

An addition to my review after reading some of the others: For pudding molds I use 1/2 pint wide mouth Mason jars. They make a great 1 - 2 person size and you can buy plastic lids to use after they're steamed. The plastic lids are durable and remain better looking than metal but you could use standard canning jar lids and seal the puddings for storage. I don't know how long they'll store because mine get eaten quickly. I also use Brandy and Rum in mine and am going to try Grand Marinier in a separate batch this year as well.

This is, by far and away, the very best Christmas (Plum) Pudding I have ever tasted. I've substituted shortening for suet in a Veggie version and it's every bit as good. This is a truly outstanding recipe.

Fantastic - this was my first attempt at Plum pudding, which I have eaten every Christmas of my entire Irish life. I wanted to surprise my parents when they came to me for Christmas, so I couldnt ask for my mom's recipe... and I'm glad I didn't. This was a great success. I used plain Crisco in lieu of suet (my mom uses butter), and halved the recipe... otherwise I followed it to a T. It was perfect. My mom, dad and I polished off 3/4 of it in one sitting! My only suggestion: more fruit would do no harm, though it is great as is!

Have not made this exact recipe, although it is very similar to our "secret family recipe." We make the puddings at Thanksgiving for Christmas of the same year, and wrap the puddings in muslin. My grandmother used to hang them from a clothesline- not sure for how long- we just throw them in the fridge after boiling. The fun part of our tradition- in each pudding there is hidden a ring, a button, and a dime. The person who gets the ring in their piece will be the next to marry; the recipient of the dime will be rich; and the one who gets the button is destined for bachelorhood. As a kid, finding these was always great fun!

I haven't tried this yet, but I will as I have finally found suet-- at Wegmans. Also, I just got another pudding mold at Fante's. You can order on the Internet.

For the poster looking for molds for the pudding. I have seen these on the internet, including ebay. Try searching using the words pudding tin or pudding mold or pudding basin. There are various types to choose from. You can even steam the pudding in a Pyrex or stainless steel bowl, but it is prettier in a mold. I've read some old recipes in which the pudding is boiled in cloth, but that sounds like it would give an undesirable texture to me!

The substitution of butter or shortening, especially in a steamed pudding, simply creates a dish that is heavy and greasy. Needless to say, very few people cook with suet these days, and most run screaming from any recipe that even mentions the stuff. If you can't bear the thought of using suet, you can certainly substitute solid vegetable shortening  which also has a relatively high melting point  for suet in most recipes and few people will notice.

To E.T. in Canada.If you haven't found a sauce yet, the best sauce to me is a hard sauce, which is just powdered sugar, butter, brandy, nutmeg, and vanilla. The recipe for it is in the Joy of Cooking cookbook. This is still one of the best puddings I've ever had. Just made mine again this year, and it smells wonderful!!!(as usual!)

I have made a similar Christmas pudding for the past 10 years or so, although with far fewer eggs. I chill the suet, chop it in small chunks and run through the food processor until the fat is very fine. A second run through the food processor with previously processed bread and flour combines these ingredients very well. Be generous with the candied fruits and raisins; I use about twice as much fruit as recipe calls for. I let the pudding age in a cool place for a week or so before putting into pudding basins to boil for six hours. After puddings are cooled, top with a few ounces of brandy, seal tightly with aluminum foil and store in a cool place in a secure container. (Several times basement mice have destroyed a pudding or two, despite having cats in the house to control rodents.) I make the puddings in January. In early December (Advent) I add more brandy to the puddings and re-seal. One or two are given as Christmas presents, and the larger one cooked on Christmas Day, with some left over for Boxing Day as well. Several times I have made extra large recipe and have had pudding left over for another year; the extra year of aging makes a wonderful treat. Hard sauce is traditional, but a cooked saboyon type sauce is also delicious. It is a very hearty dessert, so only small servings are needed, especially after festive Christmas dinner and alternative dessert, an English trifle.

Why not pour 1 1/4 cup of cognac or brandy over fruit and soak fruit for four days? One-fourth cup of cognac or brandy will not even cover the fruit!

This is the second year for making this pudding and a few changes made this even better than the first year. I used half the suet and just orange peel rather than mixed. It came out perfect and not overly greasy. Next year I am going find superior quality ingredients to the supermarket, and make the suet powdery fine, as someone explained above, as I have only used the suet with the texture of ground hamburger. I am still working on a good hard sauce recipe with brown sugar ! This plum pudding is as good or better to the ones served growing up in an English family !

Can anyone offer any advice on breadcrumbs, i.e. what kind of bread and how to prepare the crumbs? In previous years I have used breadcrumbs that had been dried in a warm (not hot) oven, but since the recipe calls for fresh breadcrumbs, this year I tore a fresh loaf into crumbs and used those. The pudding never "swelled" to fill the mold like it had before and was unpleasantly dense and soggy.

Haven't made yet--but I have a tip for anybody looking for good candied fruit in the US. http://store.yahoo.com/dairyfreshcandy/candiedfruits.html This store is in the North End of Boston--the old Italian section. Order the fruit a few weeks before you need it, especially around Christmastime. No, I don't own it or work there. I was just really pleased with the quality when I made my mom's cassata recipe. Nothing like supermarket citron!

Rating: 3
Almost exactly like my mother's! To the chef asking about Crisco... the easiest way to use it is to 'soften' the required amount by removing it from the fridge. When it reaches room temperature, it will very easily 'squidge' into the fruit mixture with your hands (or with a spoon with a bit more patience). As one chef remarked, The mixing does not have to be precise, owing to the fact that it will all melt together upon cooking.

I have a question. If you use Crisco as suggested, how do you blend it in with the fruits?

Wanted to give some help (hopefully) after reading some of your suet comments. In England (where I grew up), suet comes from the grocery store baking dept not the meat dept. It is dry and has been extruded through a small tube (maybe 2mm wide) and is cut in pieces about 1/3" long. It is not powdery and does not contain meat. Usually sold under the name Atora, which I have seen in Canada once or twice, it comes in a regular version made from beef fat and a vegetarian suet. Since moving to the USA, I use Crisco instead of suet and find it makes the pudding a little moister, but as the suet melts into the pudding anyway, its not that big a difference. Also, regarding cognac, I don't spend a lot on mine, just using the regular cognac we use around the house (say US$15-20 a bottle). I haven't found that it is worth spending extra. I do however carry on my Grandma's tradition of 'feeding' the pudding (and my cake too), by poking it, and then pouring over a tbsp of liquor over the top about once or twice a week. Christmas Pudding (as it is known in the UK) is traditionally made on Stir Up Sunday which is the last Sunday before Advent, giving it plenty of time to mature before Christmas.

Didn't make this yet but I have used suet. The trick is to have it very cold and put it in the food processor. It is then a very fine texture and works great.

I am about to make this for the second time. I'll try to answer some of the questions but I have to admit to a mistake I made the first time. First the suet does have to be powdery fine. If you don't it won't have the right texture and lumps of suet would not be very appetizing. You can process suet with about a tablespoon of flour to get it the proper consistency. I used Korbel which is about $15 dollars a fifth. Don't worry about the meat bits the cognac will preserve the pudding. I believe that the recipe was referring to candied citron which is widely available. That's what I used and the flavor was great. The mistake I made was not following the recipe precisely in the assembly. It says to add the beaten eggs to the breadcrumbs and then add the fruit mixture to that. I think its important to do it that way to get the right consistency. I added the beaten eggs last and it came out more like a fruit cake. I've had plum pudding in England and its more like the texture of Indian Pudding in America (of course it tastes nothing like it) Have fun.

Here's a good one for you all: Since I eat only organic meat (strictly), I had to ask to have suet specially done up for me. The butcher was most accomodating, but I suppose doesn't have the equipment or whatever to make "powdery fine" suet (and I didn't think to ask how it would turn out). I have it in ground beef form! Also, it has tiny chunks of meat in it! They don't seem too significant, but even cooked meat sitting around for the next three weeks makes me uneasy. I am about to use 1 1/4 cups of $75 cognac in this recipe. Does it really need to be powdery fine? Do any experienced suet users have any suggestions?

I am attempting this recipe for the first time and have a question. Since I don't think I have ever seen a citron in the greater Toronto area, can I substitute fresh lemons instead? Also, the bit about letting this pudding age... does that refer to the pudding after its totally steamed with eggs and all? I would be so grateful to anyone who can help me out! Its snowing in Toronto today and a perfect time to get this started! Thanks so much CW

I made this last xmas (10 months ago) and my small family is still eating it. They seem to enjoy it. However I am not impressed with the quality of candied fruits available these days (first ingredient: RUTABAGA???), they have an artificial flavour and are not cheap either. I love dried fruits and the concept overall so this year I will try the cranberry/fig recipe on this site. To the confused poster, look up citron in the food dictionary on this site (under the "learn" link). Go to the grocery store and look in the baking aisle for the sultanas and candied peel/citron. If you don't already know what these latter are, you probably won't like them. It's an old-fashioned, acquired flavour.

Great recipe! Better than the store bought ones! You can get the shredded vegetarian suet online at http://www.expatshopping.com/. The brand name is Atora. It works great in this recipe and in any traditional British pudding recipe. Sultanas are basically similar to plump baking raisens.

I have a few Q. re: the plum pudding. If anyone knows the answer, please send it along. 1) where can I find a citron? Will a lemon suffice? 2) the recipe calls for candied peel. What kind of peel? Peel of citron? 3)What is a sultana raisin? Anyone-please. Thank you

Still think my mother's recipe is the best, but who wouldn't be faithful to their mother?! Answer to 'A Cook From MI, 01/03/02': Being English myself, I can say that in England a vegetarian substitute for suet is available called, would you believe it, 'vegetarian suet'! Not sure if it's available in the US. (Could always import it if you have friends in GB!) Good luck!

This is the best traditional Christmas pudding recipe I have come across. The recipe makes a lot of pudding! Three quart-sized pudding molds, plus several few mini puddings that I cooked in custard cups. The origins of "plum pudding", as I understand it. It originated as sort of soupy porridge made from cracked wheat cooked in milk. Over time, fruits (such as plums) and sometimes boiled meats were added to the dish and it evolved into "plum pudding." With the addition of breadcrumbs and eggs, the dish has become the Christmas Pudding that we are familiar with today. Sometimes it is still called "Plum Pudding" as it is here in this recipe.

The "Plum" in plum pudding has never had anything to do with plums. It's from the process of "plumming," which is to say, plumping the raisins before use.

actually raisins have always been called raisins, the origin of plum pudding was "plum porridge"stemming from a dish called "frumentry"(which I have a recipe for), and yes, using plums or prunes, these were later replaced with raisins, sultanas and currents by the end of the 17th century, it was a steamed pudding and the plum name stuck
