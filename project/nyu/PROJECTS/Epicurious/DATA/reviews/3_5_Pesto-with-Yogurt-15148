Made it as directed, except with 1/3 olive oil, and pecorino instead of parmesan. Delicious over penne, with a glorious green color and creamy, tangy flavor.

This is just delicious! I added pine nuts instead of walnuts and used fresh basil form a friend's garden. Next time I might add a little less olive oil. The yogurt makes this pesto so creamy. So easy to make and just wonderful to eat!

The yogurt gives the pesto a nice creaminess. I also used pine nuts instead of walnuts, which is more traditional. And added 1 cup of parsley in addition to the 2 cups of basil. This gave it a nice taste. More Parmesan also helped. Served over cappellini. Delicious and very fresh!

Delish and easy to make.

It perks up the rather traditional pesto because it's creamy and yet without the guilt because it uses yogurt. I also cut the olive oil as suggested by another reviwer. Didn't have walnuts on hand so I used pine nuts. It was delicious.

We liked it a lot. It was easy, nice & creamy. I cut off the amount of olive oil to quater cup, and put several black olives. I used the pesto with spaghetti this time. So I'll use it with penne or raviolli next time.
