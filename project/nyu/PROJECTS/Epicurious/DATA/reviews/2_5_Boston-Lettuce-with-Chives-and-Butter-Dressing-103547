My family LOVES this salad. For a dinner where it is busy with tons of flavours rolling around this is my go to salad. Fresh snipped chives from my garden along with fresh garlic from the market along with fresh organic butter lettuce, and we're in heaven.

I feel this is a good light salad as described in the recipe, the butter is not overpowering because of the lemon
