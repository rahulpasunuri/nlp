Delicious and easy, not too sweet, and the only souffle I know of that you can make ahead and bake later. Don't skip the orange blossom cream!!

These turned out beautifully. I was surprised and more than delighted by how delicate and light the texture was. In that respect they were perfect. I also used Cointreau for the cream and followed other reviewers' advice to serve the soufflés before dolloping on the cream so that guests could see them before they fell. Definitely use a good quality cocoa and a good quality chocolate for best results.

It was excellent. Not difficult --- but messy to make. What helped me the second time was cutting up everything before making it (including the chocolate). I did not have orange water, so substituted ½ tsp Cointreau.

The recipe is excellent---not difficult but messy to make. The process went more smoothly the second time I made it because I cut everything up [including the chocolate] before starting. I did not have orange water so I used ½ tsp Cointreau instead.

This is a great dessert to make or take for a dinner party. I was asked to bring dessert for a dinner party and I made this at 1:00 in the afternoon - put it in the fridge in the ramekins, and took it to the dinner party. I made the cream just before we left, used Grand Marnier for the orange flower water...it was a hit. It's so easy. And it tastes great...I did take raspberries and blueberries, served on the side of the plate and that was a nice touch everyone said.

Very easy to make and fabulous that it can be prepared ahead of time! Interestingly, I too substituted orange liqueur for the orange water in the cream as I could not find it! Huge hit to say the least. I am a big dessert maker and my friends always eagerly await each new concoction, so there's pressure not to disappoint, and this did the trick! The 4.5oz ramekins that I had were exactly the correct size. Bigger would not have worked as well.

Delicious and easy. Although we were only feeding four, I made the whole recipe. We had the leftovers, which had been sitting the fridge for 24 hours, the next evening, and they were also delicious in a different, pudding-y way. Alice Medrich is infallible!

I have never reviewed a recipe before but have to say that this was the best dessert I have ever made and it was so easy. We only made half the batter and it still worked out beautifully.

Delicious! I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband and I loved it! I substituted 3/4tsp Petron Citronge for the orange blossom water. The recipe is time consuming but worth it!

Very good and very easy. The cook time needs to be watched, I needed to cook a bit longer than recipe stated. The cream is absolutely a must (we didn't flavor - just did plain cream)- otherwise it is just to rich.
