Easy,delicious and really attractive. I added a dab of goat cheese and some black olive tapenade to each eggplant slice before rolling and it came out great. Make this ahead and serve at room temperature.

This recipe sounds great. I am planning on making it for my daughter's first communion party. Did you serve this dish cold or hot? I would like to make it ahead of time and can't decide if it would taste better heated up. Any thoughts?

Terrific dish to make ahead of time. Complex layers of flavors and nice presentation (especially with rolls on the outside of a platter and balsamic-dressed mesclin in the center). I added goat cheese to the filling, which everyone loved.

Very pretty! Made these this summer for a fence-painting party. I opted out of painting in favor of the grill. With ingredients as good as these and juice running down your chin, how can you complain? Labor intensive, but worth it.

So this dish is a little labor intensive but worth it. It's a great do-ahead vegi for summer time entertaining.

Great, really easy recipe! A friend and I had a cook-a-thon (complete with glasses of wine) and made this recipe and a Goat Cheese Tart for a wonderful Texas Spring supper. Very little trouble and more than delicious!
