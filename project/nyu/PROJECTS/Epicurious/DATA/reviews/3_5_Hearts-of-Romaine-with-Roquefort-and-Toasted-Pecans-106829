Thought the dressing was very good. This salad was certainly easy and fast to put together. I think any greens would do in place of the hearts of romaine. My only suggestion is that next time I will use toasted walnuts instead of pecans (the pecans were too bland against the creaminess of the dressing).

Saw the recipe and knew I'd love it. I eye-balled everything, replacing the yogurt with creme fraiche and using Stilton I had shipped from Williams Sonomoa (both left-overs from Christmas). Delicious. I don't know how you could go wrong with this dressing on fresh Romaine with toasted pecans.

Outstanding flavors and texture. The kids love it. I have used all kinds of veined cheeses (roquefort, blue, gorgonzola)

Love this recipe. It's so easy, yet looks wonderful on the plate. For a dinner party, the salad can be almost totally prepared a day ahead. I did cut the amount of roquefort, but it's very easy to add more/less depending on your taste or your guests taste. Also served this on cold plates with dressing and romaine as cold as possible.

My husband and I loved this salad! The tang of the bleu cheese (I admit I used gorgonzola) offset the crunch of the romaine and the meatiness of the pecans so beautifully!! Do yourself a favor and make this simple, delicious salad next time you have friends over for dinner!

I found the dressing to be way strong of the Roquefort flavor - very pungent. I like blue cheese but this was too much. If I make this recipe again I will cut back on the cheese. Also, I paid over $4 for 3.5 ounces of French Roquefort so this in not an inexpensive dressing!!

Delicious. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. Cool light start to a summer dinner.

Very Nice! This went extremely well as a preface to a grilled beef tenderloin dinner! The dressing was light because of the yogurt -- but still maintained the true roquefort/blue cheese taste. Want to do this dish again very soon!
