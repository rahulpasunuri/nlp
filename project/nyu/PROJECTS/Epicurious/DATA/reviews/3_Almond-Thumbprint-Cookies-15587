My husband loved these! He said I could make this recipe anytime. I think you could easily use any type of jam. I'm going to try them with fig preserves today. I'm sure they will be wonderful!

I also put the jam in after the cookies are baked. You also really need to pull these cookies out ASAP. If you cook too long they will turn into rocks. Bake 1-2 cookies to experiment with the best amount of time for baking.

I gave this recipe 4 forks after sub-ing some of the ingredients. Replace the almonds with Walnuts and for preserves, use Red Currant Jelly or Jam. My husband LOVES it made like this!

The cookie was much too dry despite taking it out of the oven early. I don't believe that apricot preserves compliments this cookie. This was not a good thumbprint cookie in my opinion.

Went over big. Used seedless raspberry preserves and took San Antonio's advice about filling before baking. The raspberry and almond complement one another well.

A wonderful recipe! I used walnuts instead of almonds and did not toast them. Oh, they were so yummy topped with red current jam!!!! The swiss made Hero brand of red current jam is very good. I prefer to top w/ fresh jam just before eating as opposed to baking them w/ the jam.

It's a great cookie. Definitely put the jam in before you bake. I make the 1 1/4 inch balls and only came up with 20 cookies though.

Disappointing recipe - I doubled it, which may be why it didn't come out all that well. Something (I haven't figured out what yet) tasted "off".

The taste and texture were disappointing! Also, I have a medium sized food processor and this recipe really requires a large processor to mix all the dough.

This is a very quick and easy recipe, and the cookies are great! I fill the cookies with jam before I bake them -- this makes the jam ``set'' more and especially makes for easier storage. I haven't found a flavor of jam that does not work well in these cookies.

These cookies are a delight to eat. All children should be treated to such delights. I would servr them to anyone at any time. Excellent taste.
