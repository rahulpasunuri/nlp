Made this in honor of my parent impending trip to Italy. It was great sooo delicious and ridiculously simple. I cooked it about 2 1/2 hours in the oven but used three huge meaty shanks 1 3/4 lbs each so the extra time was to be expected. Served family style. Made with spinach and raisins and garlic mash sides. I wish there was a place to post my photos. Love these kinds of dishes because there is time to socialize w only a little active cooking time at the end.

Simply the best lamb braise I've ever done. Flavors are complex and delicious. Needs more time than stated (for me, more like 4 hours on braise). Don't rush this and it will reward you.

Excellent! I used a slow cooker (4 hr high, 4 hr low), reducing the liquids. After 6 hr when the lamb wes tender, but not yet falling off the bone, I poured off the juice & non-meat solids (strained & defatted for other uses), and put 1 14 oz can of diced tomatoes plus 2 fresh tomatoes in with the lemon and herbs in the recipe. This eliminated the fatty taste and made a terrific ragu. Served it with an argula & radicchio salad and broccoli rabe/orieccheti/garbanzo recipe from this site. Yum!

this is incredible. Cheated a little by finishing in the pressure cooker for 30 minutes instead of putting in the oven.I used dried rosemary instead of fresh. Added mushrooms and red peppers because i needed to use them. Seved with parm risotto and french baguette.Next time I will make one day ahead so it's even more flavorful and easier to scoop out the fat.

I substituted bacon for the pancetta, skipped the fennel, and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and the dish was incredible. My mother had been complaining about the time it took to make, but once she tasted it her tuned changed. We just served it with some crusty bread and we were completely satisfied. I'll definitely be making this again.

Subbed fresh tomatoes, but otherwise followed exactly. Truly stupendous. Don't be afraid to braise longer than the suggested time. My 1 pound shanks took closer to 2 hours.

delish and not as much work as other reviewers expessed. I got really big shanks. although it's more than one person can eat, the meat is so much nicer. Cook with confidence. It is wonderful and we are looking forward to the leftovers cheers!!

This was DELICIOUS! I used bresaola instead of pancetta and served it over quinoa. Next time the plan is to double all ingredients but the meatit would have been better if there had been enough stew to saturate the whole bed of quinoa.

The tastiest sauce I've made in a long while. Great with ricotta gnocchi.

This was excellent - a real crowd pleaser. I forgot to rub the shanks with the herb mixture, so I just added it when adding the garlic, and it turned out wonderfully. The fennel seed is an excellent touch. I served over creamy polenta with parmesan (recipe on this site), and it was a big hit.

I followed the recipe pretty closely - it was very very good. But I still prefer Tom Valenti's Lamb Shanks (this site).

Although this recipe was rather labor intensive, I will definitely make it again! The cooking aroma was out of this world and the flavor marvelous.

This is an incredible recipe! I've made it many times, for guests and just for us. Its actually better than using veal shanks. Although its time-consuming, it makes your kitchen smell wonderful and is great for lazy weekends.

loved it loved it loved it. mashed potatoes go great with the juice. laborious- but worth it for special occasions.

This was a great dish with a lot of flavor, however, a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I'll probably only use half the amount of salt it calls for. I agree with one of the other reviewers--the lamb was so tender we didn't even need knives!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was excellent. It was for a special family occcasion and it got rave reviews. Today I wanted to make it for my husband and I, but decided to try it without the pancetta, as I tend to get indigestion from it. I also used red wine instead of white, as I didn't have a bottle of white open. The other major change was that since I was in a hurry, I followed the instructions until it came time to put it in the oven. Instead of the oven, I put it in the pressure cooker (making certain that the meat was smothered in the sauce), brought it to pressure, then reduced the heat and let it cook at a low jiggle for 20 minutes. It was so tender we used butter knifes to cut it, and truly delicious.

Excellent recipe, just as it is. The fennel gave a nice touch, very slight and is worth adding. The sauce is wonderful, and the whole meal is great over garlic mashed potatoes.

This was terrific!! I forgot to add the herb rub prior to browning the lamb, so I sprinkled it on while it was browning...made no difference, I think. I didn't use rosemary because I think that flavor is too strong. The aroma and flavor were great.

I wanted a thicker sauce at the end so before browning the shanks I tossed them with the fresh herbs (using a bit more rosemary than called for), salt and pepper in a zip bag with 1/4 cup of flour. Also, for the liquids I used 1 box of chopped Pomi tomatoes, 26.45oz, 1 can of beef consomme, 10.5oz, and 1 cup of dry white wine. In the oven I cooked it for 3 hours. Accented with lemon zest, the end result was perfection.

This really is wonderful - have made it several times pretty faithfully to the letter. Will try again with "chops" which are so much cheaper - expect the depth of flavour will not be as good but worth a shot

Absolutely delicious. My kids (ages 15 and 16) enjoyed it so much. My husband raved about it. I don't think it was time consuming. The lamb was so moist and very savory with all the spices. Will make it again and again. I served it with creamy mashed potatoes.

Delicious! Had been wanting to learn how to make this dish for ages and this recipe turned out a final product that was definitely "restaurant quality". I left out the cumin and fennel since my BF doens't like fennel. Didn't miss them at all and the slight lemony flavor from the lemon peel is great! I HIGHLY recommend making this the day before and reheating it over low heat (so the meat doesn't fall off the bones). It was MUCH better the day after. Served it with creamy polenta (see recipe on this site)with parmesan and that was much better the day after as well, cooled, cut into wedges and fried. Yum! Will definitely be making this again.

This is one of our favourite recipes, and we've made it many times for company. Although it's a bit labour-intensive, the results are worth it. I've found it takes a bit more time to reduce the sauce once removed from the oven - particularly if the recipe is doubled.

Made this last night- was wonderful, although my sauce never thickened. Still, the flavor was fantastic, and rich. Served it with polenta. Made the gremolata-didn't care for it, but that is minor. Looking forward to leftovers this evening!Well worth the time-

I gave this 3 instead of 4 forks because I changed it...but it was incredible with the changes! I wanted Osso Buco, so I used veal shanks, and skipped rubbing all the herbs into the meat. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was absolutely amazing. Served over polenta.

My husband is a big fan of lamb shanks, so I took a chance on this one and I am happy I did. It is truely wonderful. I didn't change a thing I don't think anything could improve it. We serve it over a mash of yams, turnips, and rutabagas. Yum!!!

Wonderful. Our company DEVOURED this dish. The first time I made this I accidentally did not drain the tomatoes but this dish was still wonderful. The second time my husband was "helping" me and added the pepper for the gremolata directly to the dish. Neither mistake hurt the recipe and people were angling for the last shank and the remainder of the juice. The meat falls off the bone -- a relatively simple do ahead company dish.

Absolutely delicious! Although this recipe is a bit time consuming, it is worth all the effort. I have made it many times, with no changes, and feel it is as gourmet as any similar dish I would order in a fine restaurant. It is also a wonderful company dish. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes to soak up all the sauce.

Outstanding recipe. Added veal demi-glace to the sauce. I also omitted the fennel and corriander. The lamb fell off the bone. Tender and tasty.

What a pleasant surprise to have a simple recipe turn out with so much flavor! My guest have requested recipe this over and over again. Just delicious!!! Comfort food.

I completly followed this recipe (which is unusual for me) and was pleased with the results. The meat was very tender with a good but not great flavor...I would omit the fennel and coriander unless you LOVE those two flavors...the fresh thyme and rosemary (which I love) were overpowered. I would definately make again with minor adjustments!

I don't often rate something four forks but this dish was well worth it. My boyfriend and brother were amazed. I didn't have any white wine sitting around so I substituted about 3/4 of the wine with dry vermouth. Worked great!
