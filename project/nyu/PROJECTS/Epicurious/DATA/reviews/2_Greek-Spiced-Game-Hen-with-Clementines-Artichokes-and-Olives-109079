This looked interesting to me but I took a tip from the previous reviewer and tweaked. I used fresh onion, garlic, mint, oregano, chopped finely together in a food processor, and used a good two tablespoons under the skin (legs too) on each half. It was really delicious.

Not worth trying. The flavors were so-so, really needed something else added to it.
