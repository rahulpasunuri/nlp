Nice dish, use less salt, more onions and be prepared to toss the 1st one, consecutive ones are great...definitely broil at the end.

Farinata eateries are all over Liguria and makes for a popular snack. Surprisingly, France also has their version, socca, although the serving composition of salad and other additionals makes it more of a light meal. Certainly nothing fancy by any measure but it is an easy and healthy snack that brings up memories of living the good life in Italy.

I think the general recipe is good but lacks a little pizazz. Chick Pea flour is very bland and while the sage, olives and onion give some flavor, I would saute pancetta til nice and crisp and use that in the mixture as well. Other than that, its passable but not notable.
