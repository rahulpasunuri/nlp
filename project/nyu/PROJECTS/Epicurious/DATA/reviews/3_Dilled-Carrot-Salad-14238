Delicious and light. I cheated by using a 20 ounce bag of shredded carrots and ended up doubling the marinade except for the dill. I will definitely make this again--it took all of five minutes to put together.

This was soooo good. Very refreshing. Easy to make. I made mine a couple of hours ahead of time, which I think made it even better. Next time I'll increase the marinade ingredients just a little. Delicious.

This is a great recipe and Soooo easy! I must confess I did add just a little bit more sugar and I also added raisins. It was really a good alternative to serve with fish and/or shrimp.
