This is an excellent recipe! For the bottled dressing I used a Whole Foods brand organic ginger/soy vinaigrette and it was perfect for this salad. I used Italian parsley in place of the cilantro since that is what I had on hand, and doubled the quantity of fresh ginger for additional flavor. I used lightly salted and peppered chicken breasts, sauteed in olive oil, and diced them after cooking. I omitted the peanuts but did top the salad with mango and it was very tasty.

This is a truly fantastic recipe. I have passed it to all of my friends, who have all raved about it. Thanks again to the reviewer from Kirkland for the fantastic Asian dressing: 3T. rice wine vinegar, 1T. sugar, 3T. light soy sauce, 1/2t. dry mustard, 2T. sesame oil, 1T. toasted sesame seeds and 1/2C. peanut (or vegetable) oil I usually replace the mango with mandarin oranges and leave out the sesame seeds. Really fabulous recipe and great for a light dinner in summer or as a salad course for a more substantial meal.

Have not made this yet, but after scrolling through several pages of reviews to find this mysterious "Kirkland dressing" (from a review in early 2002), thought it should be copied again. So, here it goes: 3T. rice wine vinegar, 1T. sugar, 3T. light soy sauce, 1/2t. dry mustard, 2T. sesame oil, 1T. toasted sesame seeds and 1/2C. peanut (or vegetable) oil. It seems, after many subsequent reviews, that the Kirklands hit the nail on the head!

Took this to a beachside concert last night and it got rave reviews. After reading reader's comments, I made a few of my own changes. So at the risk of being berated for not following the recipe, here goes. I had chicken breasts in my fridge, so I grilled and shredded those. Also added a handful of steamed pea pods, for the crunch and flavor. Added some cooked angel hair pasta, and maybe 2 T chopped candied ginger, which was very subtle, but added a lot of flavor. I used the dressing from Kirkland cook, but added some Chinese 5 spice, which is my favorite dressing for this type of salad. Oh, and I was hurrying to get out the door, and realized too late that I forgot the mangoes. It was still delicious, and in fact, I just scarfed the leftovers for my lunch. Will definitely make this again.

This is an easy and delicious recipe--great for last minute company or to take to a potluck. Naturally Fresh used to make a good sweet asian dressing but haven't been able to find it for years. I usually make my own, the key is it needs to have a sweet, peanuty element not just ginger/garlic.

I love this salad. I do make a few moderatons... one of our favorite grilling meals is chicken kabobs so I omit the chicken from the salad and add penne pasta. A great all in one side dish! I also use the recipe for the Kirkland's dressing, but add the cilantro to it. I seems to enhance the flavor and then toss it with the salad right before serving. Garnish it with sesame coated peanuts and it's ready to go! It is requested for almost every BBQ we attend. Enjoy!

To the cook from Alamogordo, NM , the reason it turned out bland is that you didn't follow the recipe! Sesame oil has a great deal more flavor than peanut oil - and what's with the water? Please don't rate recipes that you don't follow - it gives others a false idea. That said, I have made this recipe a number of times and it's always dependably delicious! I have used both the Kirkland's recipe for dressing as well as Carini's storebought and can't tell much difference.

Hate to be a dissenter, but I did not find this recipe all that great. I thought it was quite bland. I did divide the green salad portion in 1/2 to serve 2. Made the Kirkland dressing as written, but didn't have any sesame oil, so I used only peanut oil, and subbed 1/2 of that with water. Even added extra gingerroot, rice vinegar, and black pepper to the dressing at the end. Next time I would not bother with toasting sesame seeds--I sprinkled them on top of the salads, as was suggested, and they totally got lost. Maybe the reason mine turned out bland is that I used rice vinegar. I can find rice vinegar, rice wine, but no rice WINE vinegar. Does such a thing even exist??? Call me disappointed.

I made this salad for the mom's at my 2-year old's tea party. Many of them asked for the recipe. It was easy to prepare in advance, and assemble at the last minute. Don't put any dressing on until you are ready to serve. The spinach will get soggy. The dressing that was in the reviews was excellent.

Delicious Salad. I used the "Kirkland" dressing, but cut the sesame and peanut oil by half and it tasted great. Also we sprinkled the sesame seeds over the entire salad. The mango was a special addition.

This is my favorite Asian salad EVER! I've substituted mandarin oranges for the mango (Trader Joe's frozen mango works just fine, in a pinch), and I like the Girard's Oriental Chicken Salad Dressing on it. I've served it in little white take-out containers (from Smart'n'Final) with chopsticks for a great presentation. Everyone raves about it!

This salad is refreshing, visually appealing and extremely easy to prepare. Kirkland's Asian dressing recipe is delicious and a must for this salad. If you know you are going to have leftovers, make sure to only put dressing on each serving. Otherwise the salad gets too soggy. Other than that it's fantastic!

Adding the sesame seeds at the last minute is what I have opted to do. Also, one would not want to dress this salad & then chill in the fridge. It is best to dress it just before serving, using as much of the Kirkland dressing as desired. Our tastes and preferences are different. I have found that the dressing lasts at least 1 week in the fridge. Just add as much as you want to WHATEVER salad & fridge the rest for the next salad. My grandson comes to visit & asks if I have "that dressing that's good on everything". He doesn't like salad, but drizzles it on bread. Son-in-law asked me to e-mail him the recipe. :) It's a good thing.

I think this was a solid Asian Chicken Salad recipe and I'll probably make it again. However, I'm not sure it warrants the 4 forks that I see everyone giving it. I made the salad according to recipe, added water chestnuts, and ended up using the Kirkland poster's dressing (1/2 to 3/4 cup is enough - add slowly to determine optimal amount). Next time, I would hold back the sesame seeds 'til AFTER I've tossed the salad, and sprinkle it as a finishing garnish for visual appeal. Otherwise, the salad gets a somewhat drowned appearance after soaking in the dressing and chilling in the fridge.

I must concur, this is a wonderful salad. Made exactly as written except used roasted peanuts instead. Of course the dressing can make or break this salad so choose wisely. I used on out of fine cooking a couple of years ago and it was absolutely great. It used a combination of lime juice and rice vinegar. Also added a little fish sauce for exotic flavor. Every one asked for the recipe for this salad.

Hi, I doctored it a bit, but by adding, not subtracting. Used Kirkland dressing recipe ( see below) but added 2 tsp ground ginger, left the fresh ginger out of the salad itself. I also added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to the dressing because I thought it needed just a little kick--subtle. Don't skimp on the soy sauce, you need the saltiness. To the salad itself, I added shredded green cabbage (one small head) and some diced cucumber and about a cup of chopped chives. I also didn't use the pre-cooked whole chicken because I wanted to use only white meat. I cooked 6 boneless chicken breasts in chicken broth in the microwave, let cool, refrigerated. Did that the day before, as well as making the dressing in advance,so I all I had to do on day of serving was assemble the salad. I got rave reviews at a brunch at which other dishes were also served. With extra vegetables as above, it served 10 people easily and had plenty of chicken in it, which is what I wanted.

The Kirkland dressing recipe was originally entered on 4/2/02. Someone thoughtfully reprinted it on 7/29/02, to save us from having to scroll back any further. Try it - I substitute spicy Chinese mustard for the dry mustard, usually omit the sesame seeds (I'm too lazy to toast them!) and use peanut oil, not vegetable. If you're not crazy about a bold sesame taste, cut the sesame oil a bit and add a similar amount of the peanut oil. Also, for the salad recipe, I use roasted, unsalted peanuts instead of the honey roasted (I try to cut down sugar where possible). Enjoy!

Wow Kirkland hit the nail on the head. What a great dressing! The only change I made was to start from scratch with the chicken and saute chicken breast strips in vegetable oil, orange juice and sesame seeds. I placed 4 strips on each plate, and sprinkled with ramen type noodles and peanuts. Ended the meal with green tea sorbet for dessert. Outstanding meal!

I made this for a buffet lunch that featured a lot of salads and sliced cold rare roast beef, and this was the first thing to run out, by far, even though the recipe makes a very big bowl of salad. I put it in a bowl instead of on individual plates, mixing the mango in with everything else. I imagine that my guests were attracted to it first by its remarkable colors, but they had seconds because of the fantastic flavors. I used Kirkland's dressing (see below) and it was out of this world. I left out the cilantro, which I never use when I am cooking for a group unless I am certain that everyone likes it, as I have learned the hard way that it tastes like soap to a fair number of folks. I will make this again, for sure, and the only thing I will do differently is use cashews instead of honey roasted peanuts, which seemed a bit too sweet. Otherwise, this is close to perfect!

Rating: 4
Used orange and red bell peppers, tried as is then added cilantro sprigs, sliced green onions and a squeeze of lime and liked it even better. This is beautiful enough for the cover. Used Kirland's dressing (almost drank it), terrific! I only needed about 1/2 of the chicken. This is a fantastic recipe. Next time I'll add lime peel and omit sugar from dressing. Thanks to all of the input from other reviewers or I might have missed out on this one.

I bought frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's, thawed them and used them in the salad. Even though I normally use pecans or walnuts in my salads, I used honey roasted peanuts, which I thought were perfect with the Asian dressing.

My husband and I loved this recipe and so did my kids (5&7). I just had one more addition to make it more of a warm salad. In each individual salad bowl I put spinach on the bottom, then a handful of freshly cooked rice vermicelli noodles and topped with the peppers, mango, warm chicken, cilantro and sprinkled with crushed honey-roasted peanuts. I also made my own asian-style dressing which turned out beautifully. It's the mango's and peanuts that makes this dish so wonderful!

To Glenn from Italy: the reviewers from Austin, Texas and Kirkland, Washington provided excellent dressing recipes...perhaps you didn't scroll back far enough.

Great, easy recipe. Would probably add more mango and more spinach. "Cook from Kirkland"- thanks for the dressing recipe, it was very good. Next time though I will probably pick up some of President's Choice Sesame Dressing - I had forgotten how good it was (thanks to the reviewer from Ottawa)! As for the discussion on the ease or difficulty of this recipe and whether it rates as a gourmet dish I think we should all just get on with our lives! Gourmet and Bon Appetit are just that, this is not the Kraft or Good Housekeeping website, regardless of time spent on the recipe! Lighten up folks and enjoy your time in the kitchen!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made the salad two days in a row. Once with grilled chicken and tonight with grilled pork tenderloin. I made the Kirkland's dressing and agree with a previous comment, that the sesame oil seemed to overpower, I just added a tad of lime juice and it seemed to be just right for our taste. Great recipe

Made this with a store bought Asian dressing. It was a very good dressing. I will try "Kirkland" dressing the next time. I have made this two times.

Try this dressing. It's from RSVP August 1988. Thanks to Cafe Carmon in Jacksonville, Florida. This recipe was for Won Ton Salad, but I love the dressing on anything: 1 green onion (white part and 2 inches of green), coarsely chopped, 1 large garlic clove, quartered, 1/4 C white wine vinegar, 1/4 C soy sauce, 2 Tbs sugar, 1 tsp dry mustard, 3/4 tsp minced peeled fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 C peanut oil, 2 Tbs oriental sesame oil, 1/4 C sesame seeds, toasted. Mince onion and garlic in processor. Blend in vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, mustard, ginger, and Worcestershire. With machine running, gradually add peanut oil, sesame oil, then sesame seeds. Please ask the good people at Cafe Carmon if you can reprint the whole recipe. It's a winner. I have substituted chineese hot mustard for the dry mustard with much success. This dressing takes well to creativity.

I am going to make this recipe again but with another dressing. I tried the Kirkland dressing and simply did not care for it -- the sesame oil just overhwhelms everything in my opinion. Otherwise, I liked the combination of spinach, chicken, peppers and fruit. I am fortunate that our local grocery chain makes an excellent roasted chicken, which makes this into an easy recipe to make, which is another reason I will try it again but with some other dressing, perhaps a more traditional spinach salad dressing.

Awesome easy recipe! I omitted the cilantro and used a can of mandarin oranges instead of mango, and *of course* I had to use the Kirkland WA dressing recipe, which is phenomenal. I just grilled a pound and a half of chicken breasts the night before, cooled them, and tossed all but the nuts and dressing together (it does make the nuts stand out to wait until serving!). That dressing really made this awesome though--it is as recommended as the base ingredients!

Made this salad for lunch and got rave reviews. I agree that the dressing recipe should be included. This is what I did (adapted from the other reviews): 1/4 c. lime juice, 1/4 c. vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tsp toasted sesame oil, 1/4 c. unseasoned rice wine vinegar, and leftover juice from cutting up the mango.

I tweeked the recipe a bit for what I had on hand, WOW, it was great! I didn't have any Bell Peppers or Mango. I used canned Mandarin Oranges and added them directly to the cilantro and ginger mix. I had boneless, skinless chicken breasts and boiled them, then chopped them up. I actually doubled the amount of chicken, just out of preference. As for the Asian dressing, I used equal parts or sesame oil, rice vinegar, and the juice from the canned Mandarin Oranges. It was yummy! Have already made it twice. i think it will be a big hit at my next summer party!!

Once again, Bon Appetit comes through with a winner. I'll definitely make this salad again. My only addition on this first time was some sliced green onions.

Next time I'll use the recipe that "Kirkland" donated...sounds like other cooks enjoyed it.

The recipe is as good as the dressing and the freshness of the ingredients. I bought "President's Choice Golden Sesame Oriental Vinaigrette" and it was amazing. I don't know if President's Choice products are available in the U.S. or not, but if so, I highly recommend this dressing.

Very good dressing. I thought the colors in the salad were very pretty and it tasted good too! I let the cubed up chicken soak in the dressing while I chopped the rest of the veggies, then tossed it all together. The mango was so good I will look for the biggest one I can find next time. Also, will use 2 red peppers instead of 1 red and 1 green. You can't see the green in with the spinach.

It was okay - might possibly make again with some changes... I agree with the two previous reviewers with regard to gourmet meals - but I think when people read Bon Appetit or Gourmet, they are hoping for more of a "gourmet" style to the dish....rightly or wrongly...I think we all want to try new things with a zip that are easy, fast and are better than some of the garden variety recipes that are in the old standard of cookbooks.
