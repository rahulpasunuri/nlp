Good basic idea. I used more garlic (3 medium cloves) and good homemade light chicken stock, plus enough salt to make the flavors come together - the salt is KEY!! I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes rather than black pepper, and whisked in an additional 1/2 cup buttermilk after blending. I've noticed that some buttermilks are more pungent than others, so I'd start with a cup and work your way up. Note: unless you have a super duper awesome blender that whirs at a nice high speed (my Vitamix does the trick), you're going to have to use a food processor to get a creamy consistency. Corn is notorious for being hard to puree smoothly but it is possible with the right tool. And don't even think about using an immersion/stick blender. They just bounce the kernels around.

I would give the soup 2.5 stars. I upped the buttermilk and definitely salted and peppered while it was cooking. I thought it was pretty easy and simple, and my husband would like me to make it again.

Inedible. The texture was uneven (I got the recipe from the magazine, not epicurious.com, so I put it down the garbage disposal without trying the strainer tip). the taste was even worse -- it was like taking mushy corn, water, and ginger all in a big spoon and just eating that -- there was no melding of flavors.

This soup was definately voted off the island! I had a friend make this and bring it to a dinner party, so without being able to taste test this soup after preparing it, I went ahead and served it. I knew it was bad when all bowls were collected and so much had to be tossed bown the disposal.

I thought this soup was awful! I made it as a first course for a dinner party and instead of embarassing myself by serving it, I skipped straight to the salad.

I agree-definitely strain the soup. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was wonderful but I couldn't eat a lot of it. Perfect for an appetizer.

Heavenly flavor... Our only change, which I suggest, was to strain the soup after blending. It became velvety smooth, and seemed to improve the flavor, as well as the consistency.
