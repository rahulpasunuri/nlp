Very tasty indeed. I couldn't get skirt steak, so used flank. I sliced the steaks before serving. Looks beautiful on the plate.

My husband and I did not care for the flavor of sauteed skirt steak at all. However, the scallions with lime were tasty and made for an attractive presentation. Will not make skirt steak again.

My Husband loved this recipe...It was fast, easy and very flavorful!!

Very easy and fast, fast, fast. The meat was VERY tender - I had none of the toughness problems mentioned in other reviews, perhaps because we like our meat a little rare. Sauce had a very buttery flavor - I might reduce the butter in future tries to cut fat. Scallions were delicious. A very impressive presentation, worthy of company!

To the cook from Alamogordo. You are right, skirt steak is usually marinated because it is a tough cut of meat, but in this case any marinade would over power the whole dish. So to make the meat less chewey you slice it into very narrow strips, no more then 1/8 inch wide.

The flavor of the sauce was wonderful! I had never made skirt steak before, and even though my finished dish looked like in the picture, the steak was VERY, VERY chewy, tough, actually. I don't know what I did wrong. Any suggestions, except to buy my meat elsewhere? This particular steak seemed to need a marinate...

This is a delicious and quick preparation of an inexpensive cut. It will be in my regular weeknight repertoire.

You use the oven to keep the steak warm.

:) The first step in the preparation instructions says to preheat oven to 200, but when do you use it?
