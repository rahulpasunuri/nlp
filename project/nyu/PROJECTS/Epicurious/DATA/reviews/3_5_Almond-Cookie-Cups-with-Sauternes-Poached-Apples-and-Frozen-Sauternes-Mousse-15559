I was very disappointed with this dessert: the timing to get the almond cups was nearly impossible (though the flat ones did make the good cookies - that might be the only thing in this whole recipe that I will be doing again), and the cooking times given for making the mousse were all wrong: I spent over 30 min whisking the egg-wine-sugar mixture over simmering water, and it still didn't thicken as much as the recipe said it would in only 5 minutes. The worst part, however, was the taste of the mousse: it tasted like overly sweet egg yolks. There wasn't even a hint of the aroma of Orange Muscat wine that I used for it. I'd say that it was an incredible waste of time and a high quality bottle of wine.

This was a hit at a lunch we gave yesterday. It's brilliant for entertaining, as the whole thing can be made well in advance, and then just assembled at the last minute. It tastes wonderful, with an interesting mixture of texture as well as flavours, and looks very pretty. A winner.

Beautiful, delicious and very upscale. Two thumbs up for presentation! I used sliced almonds. Served as cup for ice cream and dessert. Everyone wanted to know what bakery I bought them from and were very impressed when I told them I made them!

I made this last night for a fancy dinner and it was great. Instead of sauterne, I used Lillet, a sweet French aperitif wine. I thought it would taste "winey", but it didn't. I substituted pears for apples, a better combination than apples, I thought. And it did take a lot longer to reach 170 degrees and to reduce the syrup, like the other reviewer said.

OK, I made it again and it was even better than I remembered! My dinner guests went crazy over it. I used a $26 bottle of Sauternes (I could have spent $100) and it was fine. The mousse thickened beautifully, although took a lot longer to reach 170 than the recipe indicated. Same with reducing the apple syrup (which is a tiny tiny bit too sweet)- it worked but took twice as long as the recipe said, so don't get discouraged. The whole thing put together in the cookie cups is just so pretty, as well as delicious!
