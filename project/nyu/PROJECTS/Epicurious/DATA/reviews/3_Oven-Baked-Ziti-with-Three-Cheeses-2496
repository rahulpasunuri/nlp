Family loved this one, and it went a long, long way. I used less than half the ricotta called for, and more sauce, made separately from scratch (about two cans tomatoes worth for this recipe). Also added four raw zucchinis before baking. Spinach would probably have worked well too.

This is the best base baked ziti recipe I have found. I did double the ricotta and mozarella, along with adding both ground Italian sausage and ground beef. I baked at 375 for just over 50 minutes - and uncovered the dish for the last 10 minutes to let the top brown. Delicious.

Rating: 3
I thought this was very tasty and fun to make. I used penne instead of ziti. I liked the addition of ricotta cheese for a lasagna-esque texture and flavor. Next time I make this, however, I'll be using more parmesan and making double the amount of sauce that is called for - while eating it I found myself really wanting extra sauce to spoon on top since it dries out a bit as it bakes.

Rating: 3
This was a really nice recipe, different from the regular baked ziti. As others have mentioned, the cooking temp seems wrong, should be 350. Definitely use the fennel and sage, that's what makes it so interesting. I added a splash of red wine and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce, doubled the mozzarella and parm, and added chopped fresh basil to the ricotta mixture. Even my picky 12 yo liked it.

The recipe was good but it was not what I was hoping for. My husband loved it but to me it just tasted like a lasagna with penne pasta instead of lasagna noodles. I was hoping for something more cheesy. I also added meat and then tried it without, felt that the meat was very good in it.

I added 3/4 lb. ground beef and the recipe turned out really well. It was also very easy. The top got a little burned though, so next time I'll try cooking it for only about 35min.

Excellent and so easy! I omitted the fennel seeds and the onions and just made the dish with the cheeses and Garlic Tomato Sauce from another epicurious recipe. I made sure I made enough of the sauce to spoon over the ziti when done! This dish had everyone in my household young and old asking for seconds.

Very Good. Make sure when you bake a pasta dish, it is quite "soupy". The pasta will absorb the extra liquid and keep it from being too dry.

Rating: 3
The base of this recipe is great. I made a few variations, though. I added ground beef, omitted the fennel, and doubled the mozzarella. I baked the dish at 375 for about 50 minutes. I do suggest making extra sauce to serve with the ziti. It did come out a little dry and adding just a little bit of sauce when it's served makes a huge difference. I made a simple crushed tomato, olive oil, and garlic sauce and it tasted great on top of the baked ziti.

Rating: 4
This baked ziti is delicious. I did add some ground beef. The sage didn't seem to add much flavor to the dish so in my opinion it is optional. I also used Ragu instead of making the sauce.

Rating: 3
Rather than add more sauce in with the baked pasta, make extra to pass around the table.

Rating: 3
This is a good base for a recipe. I added some red wine and mushrooms to my sauce. Also I put the ricotta in the food processor with some fresh basil and a touch of nutmeg. I used whole wheat penne noodles and did not use any mozzerella cheese to make this a little more healthy. I baked at 350 as others suggested and it turned out really nicely. I will make this again. Maybe I will put in some spinach instead of the basil next time.

Rating: 3
I crushed the fennel seeds with a mortar and pestle, and then sauted them with the onion. Otherwise, followed directions except I took the board's suggestion and baked at 350. This was a very quick easy and tasty dish. It's a solid addition to the repetoire.

Rating: 3
This was tasty - but WAY too much onion... maybe a 1/2 onion chopped, tops, and really well cooked, unless you like a little *crunch* in your pasta. I doubled the sauce recipe, baked at 350. I didn't have any fennel on hand, so I didn't include that.

Rating: 3
I doubled the sauce and added crushed red pepper to zip it up a bit. Also, I added more mozzarella than what was called for. Very filling.

Rating: 3
Excellent! Tony Soprano would be proud! I made it the first time with the specified amount of sauce. It comes out the consistency of a lasanga that's not too wet (but you have to mind spreading the sauce), which is the way Mrs. Ozioli made it in my neighborhood when I was a kid. Perhaps others like it wetter, but, to me, the lack of a goopy sauce is authentic.

Rating: 3
Very good, but definitely double the sauce.

Rating: 4
Very good! I will make again with the sauce doubled. Remember to use the best cheese especially use whole milk ricotta and good Parmesan - not Kraft! And check out how long your dried spices have been in your spice rack and crumble them. This makes a difference in how your recipe tastes. It should not be bland.

I added bell pepper and healthy choice saugage. I used canned spagetti sauce, a small can of beef gravy, and italian cheese blend. My family enjoyed the dish very much, and it was easy enough that my daughter helped prepare the meal.

This was great! It was the first time I ever tried my hand at baked ziti. I used penne instead. Definitely double the mozzerella and parmesan as well as the sauce. 40 minutes at 350 (not 450) was perfect.

I followed the suggestions below and I thought it turned out really well. I loved it. Doubled the sauce and the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheeses, added Italian sausage, and cooked at 350. I agree with another reviewer--don't leave the fennel seeds out, as they really added a good flavor to this dish, IMO.

Rating: 3
OK-here's the deal. This is really good if you do the following-double the sauce. Double the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. If desired bake in two 9x9 pans and freeze one for later. I add turkey or pork Italian sausage. And do not bake at 450 degrees but 350 degrees.

A friend found this recipe for me here a couple years ago. It's now a favorite when my family visits. I like to add mushrooms, zucchini, all color peppers, carrots etc as well as sweet Italian sausage. I also just make the sauce and put it over pasta.

Rating: 3
As this is the only Baked Ziti recipe I could find, I tried it despite the many negative reviews. I wish I had seen the typo about the heat! I thought 450 was way too high. (Should be 350). I ended up taking it out much sooner, but still it really dried it out. Otherwise it was good. Not great, but I would definately make it again with the suggested changes (more snauce, add sausage). I think it could be fantastic with these additions. It is certinately not horrible as some are saying (in my opinion).

Rating: 3
Prefer basil so used store-bought basil tomato sauce and crushed basil instead of sage and oregano. Also used 1/2 lb ground meat with onions and garlic. Well received by 5 distinct palates. Any recipe that satisfies 5 picky eaters is a sucess in my book!

Easy, satisfying Sunday afternoon dinner (I would have given it 2 1/2 forks, but my husband is so happy I have to give it 3!) I forgot to look at the comments first and followed the recipe nearly perfectly, except that all I had on hand was penne, and had no problems with dryness or too little sauce. I think the fennel really gives this its personality - definitely don't skip it. Next time, I will take the advice of previous reviewers and mix the whole thing up together rather than layering, add extra mozzarella, and use the correct pasta.

This was yum! Everyone from kids to boyfriend loved it. I sauteed some ground beef with the garlic and onion and added mushrooms.

Not bland at all.

I thought this was very tasty. The cook time would vary depending on your oven. This dish is a great comfort food dish, and easy to make. It doesn't get 4 forks because I feel like it needs something else to make it tastier, seemed a little on the bland side, but still highly recommend.

The oven temperature is way out of line. After just 15 minutes the meal was smoking. Probably should have been 350.

This is a nice recipe and easy,too. I used 2 cans diced tomatoes and no paste. I made a basic red sauce. I crumbled and sauted some italian sausage, too. I omitted the sage and fennel...I love the idea of mixing the ricotta and egg with the mozzerella.delish. Try topping with some fontina cheese. It melts very well and it's quite tasty. Also baked at 350. My husband's from Italy and he said this was a very tasty version of "macaroni al forno".

I enjoyed this recipe, a nice twist on lasanga. I added 1 lb. browned ground beef, fresh basil and since I ran out of sauce after the second layer, topped it off with canned, diced, Italian-style tomatoes. Delish!! Next time I will omit most of the sauce and use the canned tomatoes instead. I think it gave the dish better texture. Oh, and definetely bake at 350 degrees.

I made this for my family, with a few minor changes. I added 1 1/2 lbs of italian sausage, browned out of their casings, and more sauce, plus a little basil for seasoning, and my food picky kids LOVED it. I also doubled the recipe, and froze one pan for later use. This one is destined to become a family standard.

I made this dish for a few girlfriends of mine and it was a hit! They all commented on how delicious it was... One suggestion-as the other cooks said, it definately needs more sauce than the recipe calls for. I used 1 1/2 cans of sauce and a little extra tomato paste, which was perfect. Also, I recommend reserving a little more mozz. cheese to top it off!

The first time I made it followed the recipe to the letter and I found it to be bland and needing more sauce. The second time I added a minced garlic clove and some chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture. I also doubled the sauce and added a touch of sugar. Taking the cover off for the last 10 minutes let the cheese on top get browned. YUM!

I made this dish once before. Several people who reviewed the recipe recommended additional sauce, additional cheese, additional spices, and meat. They were right. I added about 75% more sauce than recommended along with some Italian sausage. It turned out to be very good -- much better than the first time.

A great recipe! Was very easy to make and everyone who ate had seconds. I added extra oregano, and pepper to the sauce because past reviews said sauce was bland. This did the trick! I would add some italian sausuge next time for some variation. A 3+ in my book.

It was a great addition to my New Year's Eve buffet. Quick to prepare, and can be made in advance and baked just before serving. Definitely add some garlic and more oregano and salt, or it is somewhat bland. I don't agree to baking it at 350. It doesn't allow it to get browned on top.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. It was NOT dry; however the sauce was bland. Next time I will add more spices to the sauce to make it more like a marinara. I did not need to put "drops" of the cheese mixture on the noodles. My sauce was creamy enough that I could spread it across the noodles with a spatula (a spatula designed more for scraping and stirring). My one note to other chefs would be to make sure to buy tublar pasta that is OVEN FRIENDLY. Not all tublar pasta are meant to be baked. Some will become dry and crunchy. Ziti, rigatoni, and mastacoli (pardon the misspelling) are oven friendly. Penne and the thinner tubular pastas are not. All in all, a tasty dish that reheats well and lends itself to "personal" touches and changes.

I really like this recipe because it more resembles a lasagna instead of a mixed up mess. The only thing that I added were fresh basil leaves in the sauce along with the sage and fennel.

I used this recipe for a church dinner that my family had to prepare for 150 people. It was easy to adjust the amounts and got rave reviews.

Cheeezy! I added about 1 cup more mozzarella than the recipe calls for, and it's worth it. Plus, I found the oven temp to be way too high (must be a misprint and should have read 350 - nothing will bake for that long, and at that temp, without overcooking). I used a smaller pan and that didn't seem quite enough for all the layers. Next time, I'll mix it all together to save time and aggravation. I'll also use fresh basil and oregano, rather than dried herbs, for a fresh flavor. It's a quick and easy cousin to the real thing - lasagne.

Fabulous! I took the easy way out, and used one full jar of prepared spaghetti sauce, then took the advice of the cook from Washington, D.C., and mixed all up in a bowl then put it in the dish and baked it (minus the fennel)! I also added some pre-minced garlic in the ricotta. I've made it three times already! It is incredibly quick and easy this way!

I have never tried this recipe, but as a non-cook who collects recipes and cookbooks (for the future!), the only thing I do well is ziti and lasagna. The comments about the sauce are on the mark and it's always good to go with more rather than less. What can really make the dish though is Italian sausage added to the sauce (for the non-vegetarians). Lastly, layering the sauce, the noodles then the cheese makes for better distribution of ingredients -- for ziti as well as for lasagna...Don't give up on ziti; it's a great make-ahead dish that guests always love.

YUM! After reading the previous reviews, I modified the recipe before attempting it for the first time. Instead of 8 oz can of tomato sauce, I used a 15 oz can. Also, instead of "layering" everything, I just stirred the cheese mix, pasta, and sauce all together in one big bowl and dumped it in the baking dish and topped it with a layer of mozzarella and stuck it in the oven for 30 min at 450 degrees! Talk about GOOD!!!!! *yummy* Kids will love it too!

Make a gallon of this tomato sauce - you'll need more than the recipe calls for, and you'll want it for every vegetable you have in your refrigerator, or just plain on the side. The pasta soaks up a lot of the juice - be careful to keep this on the wet side, and don't overbake.

Rating: 2
Tastes great, but it is difficult (as with most recipes with these ingredients) to distribute the cheese mixture evenly throughout the pasta, so you end up with little islands of cheese and other spots of bare pasta. Maybe it's just me, I'll try it again sometime soon. Basically, it's just lasagna, anyway.
