I will make this again with some adjustments. I used a free range chicken and had no fat to pour over the greens, so nothing to wilt them. I will pre-cook them in the future. I also found that the root vegetables were a bit overcooked, so might add them later. The flavor of chicken was great and nice and moist, the sage was a bit subdued so I might add more. I did change up a bit by seasoning the cavity with salt and pepper, and then cutting up a lemon and juicing into cavity and adding lemon wedges with some leftover sage leaves.

This one falls into the 'epic fail' category of recipes I've prepared from the website. Was looking for a 'special' Sunday night chicken recipe and have had much better success simply rubbing lemon under the skin, adding kosher salt and pepper to the skin for a much more juicy bird. The sauce was ok but nothing to rave about. Definitely not a keeper. so it goes..

I've been looking for a staple roast chicken recipe and this is it! The chicken was moist and flavorful. I used thyme instead of sage. I was short on time so I actually skipped the greens and sauce and it was still delicious. And my picky kids loved it!

Roast chicken has always been one of my favorite meals, but this recipe added so much to a basic roast chicken; it was fantastic! To the reviewer who said "I did not make the sauce with the wine and the pan juices," with all due respect, you don't know what you're missing! That's one of the best parts!

This is an outstanding recipe! I've probably cooked it ten times since it first came out and I love it. You can really do any variation of root veggies but sweet potato, sage, and parsnip really bring out the flavor of the bird. The mustard greens are an excellent touch and compliment the sweetness of the root veggies really nicely. An all-around delicious dish. Oh, and the last time I cooked it, I did a dry brine and it came out EVEN BETTER!

The recipe turned out quite well. I too added the butternut squash and really liked the variety of root veggies. Instead of placing the chicken whole, i decided to cut out the spine to flatten the bird and cook it flat. I liked that it crisped the skin better. One drawback could be the veggies under didn't cook as well. I really liked the flavor of the mustard greens with the sweeter root veggies. I too sauteed the shallots, but i think next time i would wilt the greens in the same pan just to coat better and cook them slightly. Overall a good dish and a little different with the greens underneath.

This was my first attempt at roasting a chicken. I was not pleased with the way it came out. It was in the oven for well over an hour at 375. The vegetables were still hard - the chicken still not cooked through. I don't know what I did wrong but I don't recommend this recipe for first time chicken roasters. I didn't like the idea of raw greens so I sauteed the shallot in oil, added the greens and then added some of the pan juices from the chicken. Ended up add the wine to the greens and braised them. I turned out to taste o.k., but for all the effort wasn't worth it.

As one cook suggested, I sauteed the shallot lightly before adding to the greens, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was FABULOUS! The vegetables were cooked through, with some crunchy edges; the chicken was perfect, moist and juicy. I was afraid the sauce would just taste like wine, but it had a complex and savory flavor and was a perfect addition. This will be one of my regular recipes -- easy and delicious.

This is now my go-to recipe! My chicken was larger than the recipe and so I took out the vegies sooner so they wouldn't burn. My teen son basically did all the work and it was easy for him to do. Now he can roast a chicken.

Delicious meal. The juices from the vegetables and chicken gave a wonderful added floavor to the mustard greens.

Maybe I did something wrong but this just didn't do it for me or my family. The veggies were soggy, the chicken was good but not to the level I had expected reading the other reviews. I followed the recipe and although the chicken had a nice flavour the veggies brought the meal down.

This is recipe will now be in heavy rotation in my house! I also added squash as per other reviews. I rubbed the chicken with sage butter, placed in a ziplock and placed in the refrigerator overnight. I melted the leftover butter mixture and poured it over the cut up root vegetables and tossed to coat evenly. I also roasted the chicken backside up for the 1st fifteen minutes. Turned, breast side up browned for another 15 minutes before reducing the heat and baking for another 30 minutes. I also basted the chicken every 15 minutes with the pan juices.

Very good recipe. I don't usually roast chickens, I usually just buy chicken breasts but it was easier and faster than I expected. I did not make the sauce with the wine and the pan juices, the chicken was very good without it.

I'm planning to make this dish next Sunday, but I have a question. Nowhere in the directions does it mention cooking the greens... raw mustard greens are pretty strong, is this correct?

Great recipe! I made this last night for a dinner party of four. I substituted the mustard greens for collard since the grocery store was out and it worked.

A bit time-consuming, but delicious! We added butternut squash in addition to the other root veggies.

Wonderfully flavorful dish. The chicken was so moist. The mustard greens were an excellent addtion to the flavor and presenation. As suggested next time will try sauting the shallots prior to adding to greens.

This is, by far, the best chicken I've ever made. It's good enough for any dinner party. If anything, I would maybe saute the shallots before tossing them with the mustard greens.
