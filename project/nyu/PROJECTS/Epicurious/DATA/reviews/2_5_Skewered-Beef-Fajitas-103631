Good, not "wow." The green onions seemed weird to me and my Mexican boyfriend, but we both agreed it was delicious cooked on the grill. The marinade was nice, but of course, he would have liked it hotter/spicier and so would I have. Roasting the other jalapeno helped to add a little kick. I also grilled purple onion on a separate skewer and added red pepper to the green veggie skewers, which really made a better presentation. I marinated longer that indicated and he basted during barbecuing. Overall, nice flavor.

Skirt steak is never available in our markets,so substituted a top sirloin. Marinated it several hours along with veggies and then grilled, starting the steak first and then the veggies (used some yellow squash and poblano peppers along with the green onions and red bell peppers)while the steak rested. It was a good and simple dinner, but needed some more flavor for us. My standard of Wishbone Italian dressing is just as good.

I never would have thought that tequila was much good for anything, but this was really good! I had a large group over, so I quadrupled the recipe... half for chicken and half for beef... the beef was better. I will definitely be making this again soon!

i agree that it is not exciting enough for beef. try it with chicken and add a little fresh o.j. to the marinade. marinate in fridge for about 1 hour. i make this for parties as a heavy appitizer served along mango-habenero salsa. try it!

I liked the idea of grilled fajitas. This dish lacked charcter. Try adding habanero chile, 1Tsb.Soy sauce and 1tsp. dry mustard to marinade. Also leave in marinade over night. This is beef so don't be afraid spice.

Not enough seasoning. Some chili powder and cumino would dress up this marinade as well as salt and pepper.

My husband and I both liked this dish...it was easy and marinating the meat overnight made it tastier.

The idea of grilled fajitas is very good. I think this idea would do well with a marinade such as the tequila mockingbird marinade but the marinade in this recipe has no zip.
