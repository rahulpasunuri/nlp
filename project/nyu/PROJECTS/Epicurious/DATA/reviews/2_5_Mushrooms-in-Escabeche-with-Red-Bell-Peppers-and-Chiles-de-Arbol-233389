I haven't made my variation of this yet, but I just wanted to offer up some info. This meal is marked vegetarian, but worcestershire sauce contains anchovies. A non-vegetarian may not know to edit this detail for their vegetarian dinner guests!!

I made this as part of last year's Christmas menu (the Mexican Christmas Eve menu). This was the least successful and one of the more time comsuming components of an otherwise amazing dinner. I thought it was bland and not worth the time it took to prepare. It is the one recipe I am omitting from the same menu this year.

This recipe is okay. The flavor is good but it is a basic vegetable marinade. I served it with/over halibut for my husband and I and we were underwhelmed.
