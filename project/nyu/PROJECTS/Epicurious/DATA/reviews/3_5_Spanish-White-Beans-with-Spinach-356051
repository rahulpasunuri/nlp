Love, love, LOVE this recipe! We are vegan but I sometimes miss that "heartiness" of quick meat dishes. This has that, incredible flavor AND is healthy. It is my new go-to quick dinner.

I made this as a side for Easter dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Some minor changes -- halved the oil and water and added a third bag of spinach. (I think the ratio of onions/beans to spinach would have been off if I didn't add the extra bag). Was certainly easy enough -- will definitely make again.

This is such a quick and wonderful recipe and has become a family staple. The smoked paprika adds incredible flavour. I sometimes substitute butter beans (navy beans) for cannellini and sun dried peppers for tomatoes. I normally reduced the amount of spinach. If fresh spinach is not at hand, I use frozen spinach. I'll whip this up for a quick lunch when friends come around and always receive rave reviews. I serve it with cornbread.

Delicious! If you enjoy the flavor of smoked paprika be sure to give this a try. Love that it's a healthy dish. Served with a green salad, but will add pan con tomate to this menu next week.

This is an often repeated menu item, especially when I am having vegetarians for dinner. I've made some small changes in the original recipe: I often use Tuscan kale that I have prepared in advance, and substitute roasted peppers for the tomatoes. The tomatoes are good with the spinach, but the strong flavor of the kale tastes better with the roasted peppers.

good recipe. I made exactly as written, except only used one bag of baby spinach and that was plenty.

We loved this! Thanks to other reviewers, I added the juice of half a lemon and a half teaspoon of Spanish hot smoked paprika (in addition to the sweet smoked paprika). Also reduced the oil by half.

Perfect as is. Worth ordering the pimenton from Amazon. I also noted that spinach is sold in 6 oz bags in my market - next time I will use 3 bags instead of 2.

not good. not good at all! very easy to make. very little flavor despite the use of high quality smoked paprika. would definitely not recommend.

Two forks as written - very tasty, fast and healthy dish - except I thought there was too much oil and 1 cup water was excessive. The next time I made it with half the oil and 1/2 cup of water - better in my opinion.

This recipe was surprisingly good-- it reminded me a little of my grandfather's wilted spinach salad with bacon which was amazing-- this was a much healthier but equally as tasty version. I agree with comments that an acid (vinegar or lemon juice) to finish it off is nice-- I used apple cider vinegar which was perfect. We tossed this with pasta for a full meal, but it would also make a nice side dish. Bacon, cheese, other smoked meats or mock meats might be nice additions but it's already pretty darned good as is. And you could serve it to a vegan! As an omnivore trying to increase veggie consumption for health reasons (limiting our meat consumption has been the easiest way to do that), I'm very happy to discover this one-- a keeper!

I know I changed the recipe hugely, but it was so wonderful, I had to share. Made this with spring greens (collard greens?) instead of spinach and upped the paprika to 1 tsp. I cooked my beans from scratch, so was able to use the bean-water (about 1/12 cups) instead of tap water and I dropped the oil to 2tbsp since I am trying to eat healthy. It was fabulous, and particularly the sun dried tomatoes which added just the right salty touch. This was better than the sum of its parts.

I added pearl onions (couldn't find cipollini)sauteed with pancetta. Served it with shrimp with hazelnut romesco sauce (recipe on this site). Wonderful.

This was fabulous! I served it on top of toast and it tasted like pizza! I'm going to make another batch as soon as I finish the leftovers.

We made this for a quick weeknight dinner and it was great! We actually tossed the whole thing with a package of mini bowtie pasta to make it a main dish. Even the kids gobbled it up.

I made this recipe with a few modifications and it was a success. The leftovers were even better. 1. Halved the spinach  I was lazy and didn't feel like washing/destemming the second bag. 2. Added half a can of fire-roasted, diced tomatoes from Muir Glen in addition to the sundrieds. 3. Add vegetarian bratwurst cut on the bias at the very end.

I thought this was a nice balance to some spicy meat dishes it was served with, my husband thought it needed a major kick in the rear. Only change I made was to use dried cannellini beans, and I added the spinach right at the end as it takes no time to wilt.

Very good, will do again. Added faux smoked sausage (or smoked faux sausage?) and served over cubed roasted butternut squash. Also substituted arugula for spinach because that's what I had. Tasty dish.

Followed the recipe, but did add a splash of tarragon vinegar. Very nice dish.

I paired this with hominy bread from the farmer's market and a fresh tomato & avocado salad. The bread was awesome when dipped in the broth and in general the recipe was delicious. I added the lemon and a little more salt. Healthy and filling!

This was easy, delicious and quick. We ate it with basmati rice and added a little vinegar to finish off as others recommended. Even the three year old loved it.

It's almost spooky how good this is, given how simple it is. I don't use the sundried tomatoes (not a fan) and I up the smokey paprika. And then I eat almost the entire thing.

I loved this recipe! A friend of mine made it and thought it was bland but said - it could have been the kind of paprika she used. I used Hungarian paprika which added a smokiness that, I believe, the author intended. I also added a splash of lemon juice based on the "bland" comment of my friend and the comment of a previous user who said she used a splash of vinegar. Will make again and again. Great way to get greens and beans. I guess one afterthought - I probably cooked the spinach too long, as it turned an unpleasant shade of green/brown. I'll add it for just a quick hit of heat next time.

A simple, delicious, healthy recipe. Only changes I made were to grill, slice, & add 2 links of chicken sausage w/artichokes & mozarrella (at just 3 Weight Watchers points per link, this was a tasty but not fattening addition) and some marinade from a jar of mariinated artichokes. This recipe is a keeper.

This is suprisingly tasty and really easy. I made mine starting with two pieces of bacon, regular paprika and chard instead of spinach. I think it would be good without the bacon too. I will be making it again.

Made this precisely according to recipe and found it OK, but certainly nothing to write home about. My co-consumer and constructive critic said "How about a little vinegar?" We sprinkled finished, warm dish with a very little Sherry Vinegar and it kicked the dish up by several of Emeril's notches: to the point where we would make it again.

This got good reviews so I expected to like it, but it was even more delicious than I expected. The ingredient list is simple but they come together with a lot of flavor

This comes together so quickly and is really delicious. I don't see a need to add bacon as the paprika really gives it a rich, smoky flavor. Served it with garlic rubbed toast.

With the addition of a few TBPS of bacon, this was a hearty and satisfying dish. The paprika does give it a smoky flavor and the blend of spinach and tomatoes is just right. Served it with some crusty bread - this is sure to be a quick mid week meal in our family!

My teenagers, husband, and I all enjoyed this dish. I did have to substitute spicy diced tomatoes (drained) because I didn't have sun dried tomatoes in hand or at the local store. It was still delicious!

For the minimal amount of effort this recipe requires, the result was delicious! A great choice for a weekday meal.

Easy and delicious. I soaked and simmered up some white Tepary beans from Rancho Gordo and used the 'pot liquor' to replace the water. Added some sliced bacon per previous reviewers and it made a simple and delicious dinner with a slice of crusty bread.

Yum! I have made this twice now, once with bacon and once all vegetarian (a hit both times). Definitely throw in 2 strips of chopped cooked bacon. The 2nd time I soaked white beans overnight, then boiled for 90 minutes and it had a beautiful al dente texture which I preferred. The sun dried tomato is great but can be a little bit overwhelming, next time I might cut it a little.

This was barely OK. It was kind of bland. I added parmesan to liven it up. That only helped a bit. I won't make this again.

It's good as is, but needs a little tweaking for my family's tastes. More onions and garlic and maybe a few more sun dried tomatoes. I also used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 c water

Rating: 3
Very good, hearty dish. Sun-dried tomatoes MADE the dish, in my opinion; do not skip those. I didn't have "pimenton dulce" (whatever that is) and substituted plain Hungarian paprika. My cannellini beans come in 14oz cans, and I used three. That said, this easily would feed 8 (together with the squash and red pepper pilaf as an accompaniment). Made for a terrific vegetarian dinner for 1 vegetarian and 5 omnivores! Only one teenager lamented that the recipe would be "better with bacon"; but isn't that true of everything? -- :.))

Simple, quick, and delicious. Very tasty and will make again. I halved the garlic since I thought four cloves would be too much for my taste and was pleased with the results. Eaten with crusty bread it was great.

Very good, fast dinner, with a few embellishments. I added chorizo sausage, some fresh thyme and cut back on the spinach. After simmering for about 45 minutes, it was a lovely, smokey, spicy warm meal.

This recipe was good, but nothing memorable. I liked it and would likely make it again, but it wasn't anything special.

Very easy, and a huge hit with my guests. Just the kind of recipe I've come to rely on Gourmet for over the years. [sob]

Surprisingly tasty given the veggie based broth. I used a 15oz can of beans but would use the 19 oz next time--there was too much spinach. It was great with a slice of warm, crusty sourdough bread.
