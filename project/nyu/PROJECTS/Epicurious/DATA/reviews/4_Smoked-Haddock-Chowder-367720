I made this Chowder with Smoked Haddock filets for a New Year's Day Brunch. it was a huge hit, people are still talking about it. I made the Chowder base the day before, and then added the whole filets into the base and put in the refrigerator overnight. Only when I was reheating it,did I break up the fish into large chunks. I wanted to increase the smoky flavor, but not have the fish disintegrate. It worked perfectly. I'll definitely make it again, but the filets were very expensive by mail order, especially the shipping.

If you thicken this up with a little roux you will have a hardy dish to serve over mashed potatoes and a little sieved hard boiled egg to garnish. Green peas go well with this comforting winter dish.

I didn't have smoked haddock. I used fresh haddock and added a bit of liquid smoke to the poaching liquid. I also added a bit of paprika and carrots. served it with crusty sourdough bread, rather than the crackers. It was delicious. I will make it again.

This chowder is delicious, would give it 3 1/2 forks if I could. Certainly would not serve 6 as a main course however - 3 or 4 max.
