Made this twice to raves both times. Prefered tang of Buttermilk Blue to the Gorgonzola. Threw all ingredients into the casserole together the first time having misplaced the recipe; covered it in the oven for 25 minutes and finished off uncovered. No perceptible difference from doing it per the recipe the second time. Go figure!

Tasty, but a bit rich for my blood. Too much cream! And I'm a big fan of cream. The flavors were good, though, and I can imagine making it again a bit leaner. The Gorgonzola was a winning combo with the root veggies.

I skipped the boiling part and just layered everything together with an extra half cup of chicken broth... It was a little too liquidy (just an extra quarter cup next time I think) but it smelled like heaven when it was baking and the taste definitely matches. This is a keeper.

Oh my gosh, I can't believe how wonderful this is! My family gobbled this up and even my husband, who usually is quite a picky eater, had seconds. As previous reviewers have said, don't skimp on the blue cheese. I used the best I could find and then added a bit extra because I love the taste. (For those who live in Buffalo, go to Wegmans or Premier Gourmet) Wonderful, comforting side dish.

Definitely agree with the other reviewers - this dish was absolutely wonderful. What a surprising, subtle blend of flavors! Yum! Don't skimp on the blue cheese - buy the best you can find and pile on a bit extra if you really love the flavor.

My brother-in-law first made this for us at Thanksgiving 2003, I made it this year for my doubting family and they LOVED it, not a drop was left. This is an easy recipe that I will make again soon.

I made this for Thanksgiving several years ago and it has become an annual request from family and friends. Worth every calorie!!! Don't skimp on the cheese--divine.

YUM!!! Reduced to fit in a square baker and, between four of us, not a drop was left! Very easy to make, and totally worth the calorie splurge. Looks "fall" festive. I will bring this to every pot luck (especially Thanksgiving) from now on!

I made this 1 day ahead and then reheated. It was delicious - I also used extra cheese.
