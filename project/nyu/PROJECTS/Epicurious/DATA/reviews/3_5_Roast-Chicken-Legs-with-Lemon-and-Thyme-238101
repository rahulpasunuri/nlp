I used the thigh and legs attached to one another and cooked it for 5-7 minutes longer (in my toaster oven) and they were perfectly cooked. Very Juicy and crispy skin. Other than that there was not much flavor. I would like to try this again but increasing the herbs and allowing to marinate for a couple of hours or over-night. It might be a better idea to infuse the oil and let the flavors marry one another before applying to the chicken. This isn't a bad recipe. It just needs a bit of fixing to bring out the flavors.

Easy guest recipe that looks attractive on a serving platter. I use thighs and triple (or more depending on the size of the thighs) the thyme and garlic. I add enough oil to coat all the chicken pieces, thyme and garlic. I let the chicken marinate in this mixture overnight in the refrigerator turning the pieces once or twice. I also make a mixture of chopped thyme and garlic paste and put a bit under the skin of each thigh before cooking. I've added the lemon slices partway through the cooking as called for in the recipe and put a piece under each thigh before cooking. I like the lemon under the thigh better; it creates nice lemony cooking juices to pass at the table. Some reviewers have disliked the high temperature/reduced cooking time. I find that it works very well -- especially if the chicken is not right out of the refrigerator.

this is simple and bland, even though I up the garlic. the chicken does not brown properly, unless you do this previously on the stove. I came out juicy though.

This recipe worked very well for me. I think that I may have used too much olive oil, ( although it was delicious); but that combined with the chicken fat, made it a bit greasy. I would definitely use more garlic cloves; perhaps 5 or 6. I used copious amounts of fresh thyme. For my oven, the timing was perfect, and my chicken was perfect. I think it's a perfect and fast chicken recipe and since I prefer legs and thighs to boring white meat, it was a great recipe for me. I didn't pre-sear or pre-anything. The original recipe worked fine.

Easy and delicious. I used high quality lemon olive oil but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Since our daughter left for college I've been trying to spend less time in the kitchen. This recipe is great because it requires minimal prep and a delicious result. Do make sure your oven is clean, though, as the 500 degree temp will fill your house with smoke if there is residue from past cooking escapades.

Yummy!! Made it exactly according to recipe and the whole family loved it, even the finicky ones.

I used 2 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs, otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. Y'all were right about doubling the cooking time -- I had to keep popping it in and out to check on it. Next time I'll know better! Other than that, it was delicious. Might take the note to double the garlic next time as well

Well, that was nuts. This recipe should have been named something like how to incinerate dinner without even trying. There is no need to cook chicken thighs at 500 degrees. Do what the smart people on this page (not me) have done and brown the chicken in a skillet and cook at a more normal temperature for more time. I ended up with barely cooked chicken, incinerated roast asparagus, black lemon slices (the ones on top; the ones underneath the chicken were fine and were the only good thing about this recipe), a smoky kitchen, greasy oven... there is really no need. The recipe is not all that wonderful.

Very nice! Easy to make, lots of flavor. Only suggestion is to use about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of the black pepper. I was cooking for two , so I used half the meat and reduced the spices only slightly. Will do it again.

Very adaptable and easy weeknight recipe. I usually use just drumsticks. Pre-searing helps for crispy skin. As long as you've got the oven at 500, toss some broccoli chunks with salt, pepper, and oil, and roast them for the last 10-12 minutes, or while the chicken rests.

Rating: 2
My rating is based on the fact that I did not follow the recipe entirely and the 2 forks reflects that, not the original recipe. I did not have any lemons on hand, so I used a prepared lemon pepper spice from my local grocer. I did however, squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking. With regard to the cooking, I did it on the grill in a tin foil lined cookie sheet - my mistake, turned the flame down, not up during cooking time; resulting in un-crispy skin. Cooked it to 200 degrees with the thermometer (like my poultry well done), but still not crispy....tastey though. Like using my fresh, NJ grown herbs though, so would try again

Just finished eating, yum! The chicken was moist and delicious, though I would have salted each piece of chicken a little bit, maybe under the skin. We had 4 legs and 3 huge thighs and I cooked it all in a 13x9 Pyrex dish. The cooking time was perfect, I tented it with foil after pulling it out and the internal temp came up to 165 in about 10 minutes. Will definitely make again, and play with the herbs next time!

i find this recipe so tasty and easy. i sear the chicken (skin side down) in a hot cast iron pan for about 5 minutes and then stick it in the oven with the lemon slices underneath the chicken (skin side up) for 15 minutes at 500.

Whipped this up quickly - just used 4 chicken thighs, no drums and halved the recipe except for the herbs. Added fresh marjoram and lay the chicken on a bed of fresh bay leaves. Was fragrant and juicy, with crispy skin. This does make a mess of your oven though, so beware! But frankly, it's worth it.

I decided to wait until the most sultry humid day of the summer to make this. Having the oven on 500 was a mistake but worth it. I trimmed the chicken of the extra fat and skin. Also tripled the amount of garlic. Some I rough chopped and for some I used a microplane. Tripled the thyme as well and pushed a lot under the skin. When it came time for the lemons I put one slice each under the skin as well. Doubled cooking time. Good winter dish as it's like a 5 alarm fire in here now.

What a great, versatile recipe! I used fresh lavender instead of thyme-- which tasted excellent with the lemon--and think sage or marjoram would work well, too. You can really riff pretty easily with this clean, simple recipe. Do increase the cooking time.

Will definitely make this again. I used grapeseed oil instead, since it has a much higher smoke point. Also, used a cast iron pan in the oven and that worked well. Did need to be cooked a bit longer...maybe 30 minutes. I just put them in the microwave for 30 seconds and it was good.

Another simple and easy dish. I used free range chicken legs, which are meatier and tastier than the store chicken. I followed another reviewers suggestion and tribled the garlic, thyme olive oil mixture. The extra I spread under the chicken skin. Even my daughter liked it, who is a very fussy eater.

I prefer to precook the chicken at a lower temp, then crank up the temp for the last 10 or 15 minutes to crisp up the skin. This ensures the chicken is cooked through to the bone. No mistakes! Yummy and moist. Definitely season the chicken under the skin for depth of flavour.

Super easy and tasted wonderful! I used more garlic and thyme, and I put a layer of lemons on the bottom. Also added lemon zest and lemon juic to the oil/garlic/thyme mixture. Took the advice of another review and put the mixture under the skin. It was very good and didn't take too long, I'll definitely make it again!

I made this several times; the first exactly as written. The next few times, I made it how I would like it. I added many more lemon slices, included thighs and wings, and additional thyme. This chicken is the best lemon chicken I have had; so simple. I have and will make it again and again.

This was really an easy and tasty recipe. I actually used 5 times the garlic, three times the amount of thyme, and a little extra olive oil because I layered a bit of the garlic/olive oil/thyme mixture under the skin before cooking. I also put a layer of lemon slices down underneath the chicken (as another review recommended) for the added flavor. I topped each thigh with it's own spring of thyme drizzled in garlic oil (found at the meat counter at my supermarket). I ended up cooking the chicken for the first 10 minutes, topping with the other lemon slices, and then cooking about 17 minutes more. * I ended up leaving out the drumsticks because I ran out of room in my baking pan, and the cooking time still applied. I paired it with some Garlic and Herb rice and my fiancé loved it. It was such an easy weekday recipe and definitely a keeper!

Excellent and easy dish. I put a slice of lemon until each piece and slid a little of the olive oil, garlic, and thyme under the skin. Fantastic! I do have to agree with the earlier poster about the smoke though. My neighbors came over thinking my apartment was on fire, but then joined me for dinner, earning me rave reviews!

I was shocked at how easy and how tasty this dish was. My family usually doesn't eat dark meat but finished it all. The more lemon the better.

So tasty and very simple to make. Try layering some lemon underneath the chicken (as well as on top) for extra flavour and to prevent the lemon from burning. Fast and delicious; we were picking the leftover bits out of the pan!

I disagree with jjjoanne from Montreal that the recipe is greasy. There is grease and then there is heart friendly olive oil. The fat in the olive oil is a healthy fat that benefits the heart and 3 tablespoons isn't that much. This recipe is easy to prepare and one I'll use for entertaining.
