I brought this recipe on a picnic. I kept the tuna sauce seperate from the beans-which is a good thing, because no one wanted to try the sauce and they would only eat the green beans. I was the only one intrigued by the flavor and not grossed out by the texture (pureed tuna is a bit unappealing) or the fishy smell imparted by the anchovies. I really liked it and was glad to have leftovers, but disappointed that my dish was a flop.

quick and easy. Used six ounces of tuna -- not the three ounces. Next time will add a dab of horseradish to add bite, but otherwise a hit that went well with the pork loin et al.

Ditto on the suggestions from the Ionia, NY and Carrollton, TX.cooks. I totally agree. Served as the orginal recipe suggests is somewhat messy. I would make it a part of a plated Nicoise Salade. The tonnato sauce is just a stepping stone for a ton of serving ideas. The better quality tuna you use (Italian tuna in oil) the better product you'll get.

This recipe was very easy to follow and make. i am currently a culinary management student and the exam i had to do for my midterm in my appetizer class was what the teachers like to call a 'mystery box' they give us the ingredients and a guidline to what we have to make. and i chose this recipe to use as one of the things i was making (our key ingredient was tuna) and i thought this recipe would suit it very well.

This was good but I just made a PErla Meyer recipe that was similar but much better - she adds a T of chili sauce, onions, garlic and a little mayo. This recipe was a little boring on the 2nd day so I prefer the one with more spice (especially if you're just eating it with veggies and not veal)

This turned out great, though I enhanced the recipe a bit aiming for a variation on salade nicoise. Doubled the canned tuna (in water and drained the water), kept the olive oil, lemon juice the same, a little extra anchovy paste. Mixed all the above with some sliced and roasted in olive oil yukon gold potatoes and garnished with hard-boiled egg and nicoise olives. Superb easy supper!

I made it as a side dish and it didn't come out as creamy as the picture - it was rather chunky. However, I added more lemon juice and it came out well. It's not as heavy as a usual tonnato sauce, and a tangy contrast to the green beans.

This dish was a HUGE hit at our Memorial Day BBQ. The combination of flavors and colors epitomizes summer. I gave the beans a squeeze of fresh lemon juice just before saucing. The tuna sauce was nice and light and the olives add a wonderful tang.
