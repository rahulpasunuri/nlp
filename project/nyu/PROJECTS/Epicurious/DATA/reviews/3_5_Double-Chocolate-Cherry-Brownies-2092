I am vegan, so I made these with 3 tablespoons oil instead of butter. I also used whole wheat pastry flour to make them healthier, and get this: I completely left out the 1 cup of sugar in the batter. They were still plenty sweet, and to my own surprise, really rich and dense, one of the best brownie recipes I have ever eaten, and it has extra bonus of fiber and protein from Okara!

These are the best! I found jarred sour cherries... I drain them well and rinse off the syrup. Awesome, awesome!

I cannot imagine anybody NOT liking this recipe. You have to be careful about baking time, particularly at altitude, but to get this dessert from one pan -- amazing and delicious!

This is by far my husband's and my favorite brownie recipe. We've made it numerous times just as the recipe states and it has a great chewy consistincy with a crispy top. I don't know why people have had a problem cutting them or removing them from the pan. We usually cool them overnight and they come out very easily. We like to wrap them seperately in plastic wrap and store them in a container in the freezer. Highly recommended!

I love the fact that this recipe was so easy to make. I didn't have to use my mixer and got only the pan I used to melt the chocolate and butter dirty. I dusted the pan with cocoa powder, rather than flour, to avoid having flour on the brownies. These brownies are very dense, and I was suprised at the heaviness of the pan when I removed it from the oven! And, even though I let them cool completely before cutting them (which took a lot of restraint, I must say), they were hard to cut. They're very moist and kept falling apart. Nonetheless, I brought them to a celebration at work and people enjoyed them. I love the combination of chocolate and cherries. I didn't add chocolate chips and think they were fine with that omission. I'll definitely make these again, and may experiment with adding grated orange peel next time.

Very disappointing. The brownies were difficult to remove from the pan and fell apart very easily. The ground cinnamon added an odd note. If you want a fudgy-type brownie, use another recipe and add dried cherries, if desired.

A family favorite.

I've made these brownies several times-- and with prunes instead of cherries. No one really knows the prunes are there, but they add so much. My husband keeps asking for them. In fact, I'm writing this review because he asked me to make them for our Christmas party and rather than lookthrough all my old magazines, I did a search here to find them. Definitely try the prune variation!

This is an absolutely decadent brownie recipe. I loved the addition of the bing cherries. I did use peanut butter/chocolate chip morsels instead of plain chocolate chips. Made this for my nephew's 17th birthday and he practically ate it right out of the oven. Thanks for a delicious sweet treat!

These brownies have the perfect texture and sweetness. The cherries are a nice addition---blends well with the chocolate. Be careful not to over-bake(or else you'll be writing in a thumbs-down review!)! I froze half, and the frozen batch was actually better after it thawed--the flavors all came together perfectly. This recipe is a keeper.

These are so moist and chocolaty! Alot of people did not care for the dried bing cherries. I will make these again and are worth trying but will not add the cherries or the semi sweet chocolate chips! Not sure if I think they are the best ever, but a pleaser and easy!!!!

Very easy. The best, moist and chewy brownies. Not overly sweet. The cherries add a great twist.

Took these brownies to a super bowl party, and they were well received. Very rich, and easy to make. My husband wasn't excited about the cherries (he doesn't like adulterating a classic with fruit), but I think he's stodgy! It would probably be a good basic brownie recipe without the cherries!

I make these brownies so often that I no longer have to refer to the recipe since I know it by heart. I've eaten them at room temperature (very moist), the refrigerator (fudgy) and even from the freezer. They are great!!!
