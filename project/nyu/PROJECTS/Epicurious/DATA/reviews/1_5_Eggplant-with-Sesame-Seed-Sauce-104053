The sauce was too watery, I was a bit disappointed. Never thought of steaming eggplants. Was pretty good.

Definite Indian twist to this dish. It's really quite decent (verging on three forks). However, it may be too intense for some. With the amount of garlic prescribed, it's incredibly garlicky. The spices overall do make it a little chaotic, but in the end I kind of liked it (I'm just that kind of guy). Maybe I'll make it again, maybe not.
