First, I will admit I used 1.5 tsp Penzey's Bouquet Garni instead of fresh tarragon. And I couldn't find pea sprouts. Still, this was very good and well received. I did a lot of taste testing as it was cooking, and I think the yogurt was a small but important component. It was also a perfect make-ahead dish.

This is a lovely, simple soup perfect for summer. I've made it twice now, and the second time I strained the soup through a fine mesh sieve twice. The result was a sublime texture. I find the tarragon a bit unnecessary and didn't use it the second time around.

Doubled the recipe for a dinner party and it came out very well. Super easy to make, especially when using an immersion blender. Forgot to add fresh peas at the end, but that's okay and I didn't get pea sprouts, but I don't think anyone minded. Would def make again - easy and quick enough for a weeknight dinner.

This was yummy and quite easy. I tend to only make recipes that are easy, so believe me this one is easy. The hardest part was taking out the blender, but it was done in 2 batches, so no problem. I didn't add any salt, because I used pre-made veggie broth which had plenty of salt already. I also didn't really think it needed any pepper. I will try the suggestion of fresh lemon. It has a very velvety texture and it tastes delicious!

Amazing soup and so quick to make! I pured about half of the peas and added back in half after because I prefer a little texture to my soups. Lots of pepper for a little kick, will definitely be making this again and again.

Used for a gourmet luncheon. Couldn't find tarragon so used basil. It was sweet & light.

I must say...didn't expect much from this recipe, but was looking for something healthy and light to bring to work for lunch. Had a bunch of frozen peas and had recently made a batch of homemade chicken stock, so I said, "why not?" OMG. Such delightfully delicious results! Would agree that it needed a bit of salt and a bit of extra pepper at the end, but man, oh man...tast-eeee! Even better after sitting around in the fridge for a few days - how many things can you say THAT about?!?

Awesome! Made it last night for the first time for my other half, and we both loved it! It didn't taste like frozen peas at all. Would def make it again and have shared it with several friends.

This was the first course of a 6 course tasting menu with wine blah blah blah. A nice change from all the squash soup. Super easy to make and really yummy. Will definately make again!

I was very disappointed in this recipe after all the rave reviews. It just tasted like frozen peas with tarragon and it was a thinner consistency than I hoped. Never again.

This recipe is pretty good. As some other reviewers recommended, I did add a fair amount of salt at the end. Also, another viewer suggested adding lemon juice which I definitely think was necessary. It really improved the flavor. Great easy soup! Awesome with the yogurt garnish

If you love the taste of frozen peas, you will like this recipe. I tried adding extra shallot and tarragon, but this just ended up disappointing. Maybe I'm just not a frozen peas person.

This was an absolute hit! This was my first time making this and it was just wonderful. I think my onions were slightly under-sauted but it was still great. I doubled the recipe since my Dad brought enough ingredients home to feed the neighbourhood. I was afraid I'd added too much pepper at the end (4-5 tablespoons?), as I wanted more of a kick to the lovely sweetness. I was worried it would bother my father who is 'allergic' to anything spicy, but the only thing he had to say was that this was 'magical soup'! haha He told me he was breathing better after eating it.. No kidding. I don't know if it was the tarragon or all that pepper, but it definitely did him some good =) Terribly easy to make and is going on my favourites list.

This soup was simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. I served it as a lightweight dinner with greens from the garden and crusty white bread with butter. I will make this again and again. Like another reviewer, mentioned an immersion blender makes recipes like this so much easier and pleasant. That said, be careful to avoid my mistake. My first batch was made with peas from my garden -- I'm glad I tasted it before I walked away with the blender balanced in the 4-cup measuring cup, so that I can assure you that while frozen peas with this recipe are wonderful, fresh peas are divine. So, I walked away with the blender "safely" balanced to grab a bit of cream and the next thing I knew the soup was all over our wood floors, walls, and cabinets. I cried, poured another glass of wine, and made a second batch with frozen peas. If you have fresh peas, this is a perfect recipe to really showcase their flavor. But I will make this throughout the year with frozen peas, it's that good. Try to grow your own tarragon to save money!

Peas are so wonderfully sweet, and shallots delicious, and mandolins for chopping said onion-like product make the whole process a breeze. That's right, a breeze. I'm dreadfully, sadly allergic to dairy, so I omitted the yogurt and was as happy as could be. If you have an immersion blender, the process becomes even breezier.

So delicious! Peas and tarragon are always a wonderful combination, and in soup form they really shine together. I was short on veggie broth, so I actually used a cup of kefir yogurt (available at Trader Joe's), stirred in after blending, to thin the soup a little -- and the result was amazing. A pinch of salt is also nice, but entirely optional, since the soup is so flavorful on its own.

Delectable... simple, refreshing, elegant and gourmet.... ;) I drizzled my soup with yogurt in a pretty zig-zag fashion which gave the dish and all together refined and sophisticated look.... Scrumptious Indeed!!!! ~Bon Appetit~

I've made this soup many, many times and it is always delicious. It has become a staple in my house as I usually have the ingredients on hand and it is fast, easy, and very healthy. The tarragon can be fresh or dried and the soup is good with or without the yogurt. Enjoy!

Am looking forward to making this..I love my old day before ham bone soak peas thing, but I need this now and it sounds great!! Pea sprouts are found at Global markets.good luck!

Vintagegal- Look for them at the farmer's market with the salad greens. They are called "pea shoots" I am up in Westchester so they must have them at the NYC stands too since they are coming from the same farms.

A wonderful way to eat your peas. I found it tasted better the day after, once the spices had blended more fully. I added to the textural interest and appearance of the soup by also sprinkling it with freshly hulled peas (along with the remaining heated frozen ones). Don't know about other folks but I searched the gourmet and health shops of NYC and could find nary a pea sprout. Do they exist?

I thought this recipe was great. Our 3 year old wouldn't touch it, saying she didn't like pea soup. I told her it was Kid's pea soup and she took a bite and said, "I like pea soup!"

I loved this recipe! I made it for my mom and both of us had double helpings. I also thought that a little bit of grated Parmesan cheese on the top was delicious.

Prefer raw peas rather than cooked..also use lemon juice on most of my cooked vegetables, so when I sampled the finished soup & thought it nice but a bit blaw, I added a few drops of lemon juice & that seemed to bring it to life.Cut back the tarragon as suggested, but think it could use the whole amount.

What a wonderful spring soup! I was lucky to find pea shoots at Trader Joes and garden peas at our local co op (shelling the peas was the most labor intensive). Great flavor and so very pretty. This one goes in my recipe box.

Luscious yet completely healthy, this recipe has just made it to my list of standbys. Made it as recipe directs, with one minor change, added tarragon after soup boils- wanted as much flavor as possible. The color is incredible, served it at as part of a six course dinner for friends with rave reviews. Quick and easy enough for mid-week. Love this soup!

Rating: 3
Very good flavor. Created it exactly as the recipe states and I can't find anything I would change except I don't think it was necessary to separate out the peas and microwave any of it. I would just puree the entire soup. Just leave a cup or so unpureed.

Delicious! Both my husband and I really loved it. (Kids were a bit ambivalent.) Very, very easy!! Looking forward to making this with fresh from the farm peas.

I thought this was great. I added a bit of salt and used only 2 tbs of tarragon. I added all the tarragon to the broth, none after blending. Next time I am going to use butter instead of olive oil and have more whole peas to add at the end.

Wonderful, EASY spring soup. I also skipped the pea sprouts because I didn't want to find them. I also used an emulsion blender to make it easier. when I ran out of yogurt used parm on the top which was great too.

This is wonderful. My husband and I both had two bowls and there is not much left for leftovers. The only way I changed it was to use chicken stock because I had it in the pantry. This is a serious keeper.

i made this last night- we're huge fans of split pea and this was a perfect lighter version for spring. i used half as much tarragon and several tablespoons of dill b/c i had it on hand and it was so good. i also added a splash of cream after i blended, and several pinches of salt. i skipped the pea shoots. would make this again! yummy and fast.

This was a great starter to our Easter dinner. I also have never been a great fan of tarragon so also cut back to two tbsps. And I must say tarragon has now found its place in my world with this soup - the flavors blend beautifully. I was not about to go to Cleveland looking for pea sprouts so used bean sprouts instead to good effect. It's a no brainer but a pinch of salt should be added to the ingredients.

We really enjoyed this soup, though I also limited the amount of tarragon to 2 tablespoons because I thought that 3 would be too much. I blended it right in the pot with an emulsion blender. The dollop of yogurt is a must - use Greek if you have it to create a creamier and thicker texture. This will be an addition to our regular rotation!

I'm planning on making this recipe, but I despise taragon. Any tips on a substitute?

Super easy and absolutely delicious! I was out of shallots, so I used a medium white onion. Plus, I've never been a fan of taragon, so I only used 2 Tbsp and the soup turned out wonderfully.

I thought this was good, but I made the following adjustments. I only used 2 tbs of tarragon because the tarragon was overpowering. I also added some half and half and grated parmesan for flavor.

I made this right out of the magazine. It is so simple, yet so delicious! The only thing is that it needs lots of blending to make it really smooth. Wonderful recipe!
