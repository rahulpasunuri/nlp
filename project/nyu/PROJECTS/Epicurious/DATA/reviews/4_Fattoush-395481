I made this salad for my husband who is incidentally of Lebanese decent. He said he tasted just like his Siddi (Grandma) used to make.

This was fabulous! I agree with other reviewers that no substitutions are required. The Sumac seasoning is essential. I purchased a small tub from a local Middle Eastern restaurant.

I used my own fresh mint, and it was so strong that it frosted my entire brain. Use one cup at your own peril unless you really know your mint.

I pulled this recipe and planned on making it at a future date. Thanks to the previous reviewer, I decided to go ahead and make it and it was fabulous! Made as written with no substitutions. I'll add this to my regular rotation. BTW, sumac can be found at Williams Sonoma if you're having a hard time locating it!

Loved this salad. I have made it a few times since I received the May 2012 magazine. I am very surprised no one else has reviewed it. I make the dressing and salad as indicated and it is delicious.
