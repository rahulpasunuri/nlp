I prefer to have the butche cut the ribs off and then re-tie them back on for roasting. If not I also like to simply carve right in between each of the bones and chow down on a 2" thick gift of Prime Rib! yeh, so I'm a glutton!!

I agree with Jennifer Venar. Just cut the the meat away from the bone and slice away. Why make it more complicated than it needs to be? Linda Paul

Both of these methods seem much more difficult than they need to be. I make a standing Rib Roast every year for Chirstmas and the method I have come to prefer is to remove the roast from the ribs after the rest period and set them aside. I then carve the roast as you would slice a loaf of bread. I find this method tends to eliminate the need to chase the roast across the room.
