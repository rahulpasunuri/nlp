I made this using some prepackaged diced ham that had to be used up. I didn't have Cajun spices, but used a blend of cayenne pepper and chili powder, with a healthy dusting of black pepper and salt. Also, I made my own hash browns by dicing 4 peeled russet potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, par-boiling for 5 minutes, draining and cooling the potatoes, then cooking them in some butter and olive oil BEFORE adding other ingredients. Excellent results! (Note: for perfectly browned hash browns, allow them to cook on medium-high heat for 5 minutes before flipping them; over-stirring will result in mushiness.)

Used left Easter ham. Easy and fast recipe. Great for week night dinners. Husband loved it.

My husband would eat meat and potatoes 7 days a week so when I discovered this recipe about a year ago, I decided to give it a whirl. He loved it and it gives me a break from all the beef he would love to (but doesn't always) get. Have made it many times and as was mentioned in one of the other reviews, I brown the potaotes seperatley, then add the other [cooked] ingredients to THEM.A quick work day meal.

Absolutely fabulous! Great way to use up leftovers. Used ham from easter, also added some mushrooms and cheese that needed to be used up. Took other reviwers advice and broiled some eggs on top. Great weekday quick meal for the entire family.

I didn't realize that 4 forks meant "a dish beyond compare" hahaha - but it definitely was delicious. I had some leftover scalloped potatoes, so I chopped them up (instead of using the frozen hash browns) and added the sauteed veggies and ham and then baked it in a hot oven to get the crispiness. It was yummy - my 9 year-old daughter loved it as well. I will definitely keep this recipe!!

Tried with eggs and broiler like last reviewer, and it was a delicious weekend breakfast! Didn't have Cajun seasoning, so used pinches of salt, cayenne, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, thyme, and basil. Used combination of regular onions and green onions. Next time, will brown the potatoes separately for crispness and to prevent overdoing the vegetables, will add green onions later so they don't go dark and mushy, will probably skip broiler as eggs got a little over done and potatoes will be crunchy enough if browned separately.

The only changes I made were to add a bit of jalepeno with the onions and green pepper, and then I finished it off by topping it with eggs and putting the whole pan under the broiler to cook the eggs and crisp the entire recipe.

We thought this was OK but nothing special. Used dried thyme (abt 1 1/4 tsp) and it overpowered everything else. Also had a kind of weird sweet taste. We love hash, but not this one.

Used for brunch - served with poached eggs, cornbread, and sliced avacodas. I used a combination of red and green peppers. Doubled the recipe, made ahead of time, kept warm in a low oven and recooked/heated on a med flame for 2 minutes just before serving.

When my husband told me he was making this recipe I was not overjoyed because somehow I couldn't imagine that this combination of flavors would be very good. To my surprise I loved it! Really loved it and I can't wait till he makes it again...which will be tonight. To me it was a wonderful blend of flavors and I just wanted more. Really!

This I thought was a good hearty meal- I thought it needed some sort of sauce though (maybe it was just me because I like some sort of sauce or dip/spread with anything) but other then that it had nice flavor. I served this with a buttermilk corn bread which rounded out the meal nicely.

Quick and easy. I substituted half a yellow onion for the green onions. The only problem I had was that the potatoes took much longer than 7 minutes to brown. I think this was b/c of all the water from the veggies cooking down and the hash browns thawing. Good weeknight meal with a salad.
