Wow, delicious dressing, and made with really accessible ingredients. So good! I made this substituting halved cherry tomatoes for the shredded carrots, and actually left off the shrimp (I made this as a side dish for a very meaty Thai Chicken entree). Used a julienne peeler for the green papaya (worked great!) and let the whole thing marinate for 20 min or so before serving. Will come back to this dressing recipe every time I make any version of green papaya salad. I'm not sure whether this is or is not an authentic version of som tam/green papaya salad, but it's really enjoyable either way, and that's what counts!

This is a good fast dish to make. I have found some good subs too that make the dish just as good. A green mango subs well for the papaya and soy sauce for fish sauce. My girlfriend is veg... thus I had left out the shrimp. I did not find a huge difference in the overall taste. The shrimp is more or less a fancy garnish I guess. The only thing I would change is I would add 2 tablespoons of sugar and 3-4 chilis. The extra sugar is needed as if you sub soysauce, the dish can become a bit salty. And I feel that this thai dish needs to be spicy... so the extra chilis.

This is a good meal for a warm day but not something I will make often. I served it as a side for the Shrimp, Corn And Red Pepper Salad Sandwiches - everyone loved it.

so easy. very refreshing in the summer! i've made it many times and its also great with beef jerky chopped inside. i've always used vietnamese, but i'm sure any kind would work.

This was excellent. I have never used payaya at home - was a bit taken aback when I saw the inside! It was well worth the trouble to find a green one. I added just a hint of fresh mint - so very, very delicious! I will bring to our gourmet club this weekend!

I have made this many times. I usually use mango instead of papaya and for those allergic to peanuts, almonds are also good. Fresh thai basil is a must!

Delish! After having a Green Papaya and Shrimp Salad recently, at a Vietnamese restaurant in Soho/NYC, I had to find a recipe. Thrilled to find this one, I made a few adjustments per the salad I had in NYC. I added about a tablespoon of minced ginger and replaced the coriander leaves with finely sliced mint leaves. I also added a tad more lime juice to the dressing. It adds that extra zing I was looking for. I will definately make this again and again.

Fresh - great appetiser and really easy to present - goes well with any curried/Thai food and looks great. Great colour and full of flavour. Traditionally this is done with fermented mud crabs but that gets a little to strong for your pallet. Keep with shrimp/chicken or pork.
