After reading the one review about how bland this was, I doctored it up using a tablespoon of sesame oil in the marinade, more sherry than was called for, and, luckily, I had a jar of hoisin sauce in my fridge, which, happily, turned out to be the mystery sauce one spreads on the wapper, provided with real chinese mu shu! Add these things and this is actually pretty good! Without them...at your peril.

This is not "mu shu", it's mushy. I really hate these "modern interpretations" of classic dishes which retain none of the original character so loved by many. The only thing about this recipe that seems to have been kept is the soyu, and that is not supposed to be the principal flavouring agent; it's just the closest this recipe gets to chinese. The author of this insult to all ethnic cuisines should be sacked, and no one should ever purchase this mag!

I made this dish last night and the flavors are good, but subtle and mild. If I make it again I might add some red pepper flakes to the chicken whilst it is being stir-fried for some heat. Also, I might cut back on the amount of vegetable oil used as the dish got a little "soupy" upon serving. But it is quick and easy for a weeknight meal!
