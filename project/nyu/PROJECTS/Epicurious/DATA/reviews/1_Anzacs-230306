These may be a lovely cookie but PLEASE rename and recategorize them as they are not ANZAC biscuits (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps). Hate to go all precious on you but they must have golden syrup not maple syrup and butter instead any kind of margarine.

I agree with the other reviewers - these aren't quite Anzac Biscuits, and Anzac bikkies when made are most definitely not low far. I use regular margarine, and absolutely use golden syrup instead of maple syrup. Using maple syrup just seems... wrong, considering who the Anzacs are!

Sorry, but that is NOT a low-fat cookie.
