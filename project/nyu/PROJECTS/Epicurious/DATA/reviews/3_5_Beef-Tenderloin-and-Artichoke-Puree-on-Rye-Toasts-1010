This is one of my favorite appetizers! To save time, I use cocktail rye (without the cookie cutter step) and substitute eye round from the deli, sliced paper thin. I dont think the work and the expense of the filet adds anything. Please try this one!

Made this for 2 different events and was the hit of both! I used baby arugula and julienned it so that assembling them was fast. ALSO... since it was cold outside, I popped the finished product into a 475 degree oven for a couple of minutes until the shaved parm melted... served right away... delicious!

Outstanding! Superb flavor combination and beautiful on the plate! A great appetizer for a party. (Made the recipe exactly as stated.)

I've made this a few times for cocktail parties and it's always a hit. I've also been asked for the recipe more than once. I do not roll the tenderloin, as I think that makes it harder to bite off. I simply lay it across the bread. I also have a hard time finding decent Rye bread for the toasts, so I frequently use good quality french bread slices. In a pinch (logistical or economical) I've used proscuitto instead of tenderloin. But you must use the Parma prosciutto. Otherwise, don't bother.

I love this recipe and make it often! In a pinch I will use jarred artichoke bruschetta from Trader Joes. The key here is to use a GOOD piece of tenderloin (yes, it'll cost you 20 bucks but it is worth it), lots of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, sear it on the grill a minute or 2 a side then finish indirectly, 3 - 4 minutes a side (you want it RARE so it melts in your mouth!) which can be done a day in advance. Serve room temp.

These were OK, but not great - I had a lot left over. Overall not worth the effort.

I made these for a wine tasting party as well. They did not disappear and none of my cooking friends asked for the recipe. Maybe I used too much puree, I don't know. They just didn't get the raves.

This is a easy do-ahead recipe. The rye bread toasts really added flavor. Be careful not to add too much lemon because it can over power the artichoke puree. I also used a good quality deli roast beef which was fine.

Made these as part of a holiday appetizer buffet last Dec. and they were a huge hit! I did use good quality, thinly sliced deli roast beef and I don't think that took anything away from this recipe; I too used the party rye as is. The arugula is a nice peppery touch. Easy and declicious! Do try! KIMBER

Change the name!! I read the recipe name and thought - GAG! Who would puree a tenderloin?? The recipe should read "Beef Tenderloin with artichoke puree..." or something! Call me a grammarian, but the recipe is fab!

I made this for a wine tasting party. Great reviews from all my meat-eating guests. I also skipped making rounds and just served the cocktail rye as is.

This recipe is terrific. An elegant party hors d'oeuvre. I used basil leaves in a pinch once instead of arugula, and that worked, too. As always, real parmesiano reggiano makes a big difference.

This was a hit as a Thanksgiving appetizer -- including many picky eaters. There is a sizable portion of leftover puree and it is great on bread with leftover turkey the the next day.

I'm vegetarian - so I skipped the beef. I used this puree as a dip and spread instead - and it's just wonderful. Everyone at the party loved it. The tarragon and nutmeg make this recipe special. I don't like mayonnaise, so I used half of the required amount and substituted the rest with sour cream - and as I said - excellent!

I have made this several times. A quick substitute for the tenderloin is deli (high quality)london broil. The flavor is just as good. I made small piles of the london broil instead of slicing. I also grated the parmesan as a short cut that helped reduce preparation time. Very good! Don't skip the arugula...it makes it!

Fantastic appetizer! Served this with several other choices at a small dinner party and this was the only one I ran out of. I used the small cocktail rye bread and simply cut off the crusts, rather than cutting round pieces. Would definitely make again.

Yum-YUM! Had these at a friend's holiday get-together last year and begged the recipe. Guests at my own party couldn't get enough either. I used slices of a sour-dough onion baguette very successfully. The artichoke puree would be wonderful on sandwiches too. Overall a really elegant and impressive hors d'ouevre!

Made this for a cocktail party and it was a hit. Very labor intensive if you ask me. Would make again for a small group, but not for 50!

This was outstanding. My company wolfed these down. The artichoke puree is so good that I'm going to find other uses for it. Because of time constraints, I used a high-quality deli roast beef which worked perfectly.

This is a pretty yet hearty appetizer. We loved the artichoke/tarragon combination.

Made these for a cocktail party and got fabulous reviews. I left the bread as is (didn't cut in circles) and the presentation was still very nice.

Easy to make and the extra spread goes very well with pita points. We BBQ'd the meat, which worked well.

Wonderful. I made this for a party and everyone complimented it. I would make the artichoke puree a day ahead of time to let the tarragon blend in a little more. Very tasty.

Excellent - the artichoke puree alone is fantastic!

I gave this 3 forks because the presentation is outstanding. I found this somewhat boring tastewise; but I tend to be very discriminating. This is great for parties and people with "regular" taste buds! I will make it again for company, perhaps with a bit more horseradish.
