Great recipe - unique and interesting. I think the braising time is too long because the quail were a little dry. I even turned the oven temp down to 300º after the first 15 minutes. I added cooked regular chorizo and it still had a lot of grease but not as bad as it would have been if I hadn't thoroughly cooked it first. I served this with creamy polenta (BA 5/2009) and it was the perfect accompaniment.

This has been one of my favorite dishes since I made it for the first time 3 - 4 yrs. ago. The depth of flavor achieved with the poblanos and saffron is fantastic. I use two split cornish game hens and always serve it with polenta.

This immediately became one of my favorites dishes. Everyone that I have cooked this for loves it. The only cange that I made is that I used quail breasts instead of whole quails. Outside of that I didnt change anything. This was my first experience with poblano peppers and I cant imagine that people dont use them more.

This was fabulous and the aromas while cooking drew people to the kitchen throughout. I cannot get poblano chiles in Luxembourg so I added some chipolte instead. Seemed to work. Used rice which I had on hand - next time I will use polenta. One note: I find that cooking chorizo for long period of time makes it dry and hard. So I quickly sauteed the slices and added them to the sauce at the end. The quail were beautifully tender and tasty.

The only thing I did differently in this recipe was to use chicken instead of quail. It sounded good, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The flavor combinations sounded wonderful, but upon tasting, wasn't that impressed. My opinion is that the saffron overpowered the other flavors. Maybe 1 tsp. of it is just too much for this dish to let the other flavors shine through.

I found this while looking for a "braised" dish. I just used chicken thighs and I think the results were great! I don't know where I'd find quail on the spur of the moment. This works out great for an easy weeknight meal.

This is a great recipe for quail or dove. Really pretty and not too difficult. Made it with rice and used a gourmet chicken sausage instead of chorizo (couldn't find Spanish chorizo and Mexican chorizo is too greasy).

This recipe is delicious. I received nothing but raves from our quail hunter friends. The quail melts in your mouth and the sauce has great flavor. I have made it both with polenta and rice, I preferred the rice. I think I will try cooking the chorizo by itself so I can better drain the grease off.
