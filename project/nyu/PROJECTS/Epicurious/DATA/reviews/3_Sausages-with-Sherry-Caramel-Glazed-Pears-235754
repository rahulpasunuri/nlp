Definitely a winner, although I will use firmer pears next time (I couldn't find Bosc). I like the idea of making the caramel sauce and using it with pork roast, but the spicy sausages worked well for me. Mashed potatoes, bread, or some other "sopping" agent are a must to serve with this!

This looked very elegant on the plate. And the first few bites were a hit, but then it just got very ... samey. The sauce itself was wonderful, but the whole thing was just too sweet (and I used spicy sausage), and too blah. We added plenty of pepper, but it just needed some other flavor to really have a full taste.

Too much sausage for my tastes. I will reduce to 16 oz when I make this again. Makes an elegant breakfast/brunch.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the pears and caramel sauce. Next time though I might pair it with another meat--roast pork perhaps. The sausage I used didn't do the fruit justice. I served the dish with mashed cauliflower and crusty bread to mop up the caramel.

YUM! This seems like a kind of strange main course (it is) but it's also very good! Just in case you're wondering what to serve with this, it's a more complete meal with bread and salad.

This was a very simple recipe and even my meat and potato husband loved the addition of the pears.

yum! the caramel makes this a sweet and rich dish, perfect for a cool autumn evening. be sure to use plenty of freshly ground pepper to balance the sweetness of the caramel, and be sure to use very firm pears. serve with good bread to sop up the luscious caramel sauce!
