To the Cook of NY. Put the mixture in the freezer and give it a good stir every hour until it is completely frozen (the goal is to prevent the sorbet from forming a block of "ice"). When doing fruit sorbets, I put the frozen sorbet in my Cuisinart, add one egg white and turn the machine on for one or two minutes. Gives a great texture. Should work the same with this (haven't had time to try this recipe).

I don't have an ice cream maker. How else can this recipe be made? I really want to try it.

We made only the cranberry sorbet. It was VERY sweet; in fact, we thawed it the next day and doubled the recipe but excluded the sugar. It then froze to a nice consistency and was flavorful, but not good enough to make again.
