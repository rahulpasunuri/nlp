I made these to go with a roasted hazelnut ice cream for our Italian themed dinner club. Very nice. I made checkerboards as suggested by another reviewer. The hazelnut part was wonderful; the chocolate, not as much. Next time I will double the hazelnuts, make only the hazelnut portion and drizzle dark chocolate over. Agree that assembly isn't as bad as it sounds.

These are excellent cookies! The chocolate is rich tasting, and the look is so beautiful. Don't be intimidated by the process, I wasn't sure how mine would come out since my logs were no where near perfect, but the cookies came out perfect. Definetly toast the hazelnuts! This is not a supersweet cookie, it is just *deluxe*!!

These are the best cookies I have ever made. The flavors are subtle and blend supurbly with the buttery base. The chocolate part is very rich and dark. Toasting the hazelnuts is a must. And don't let the construction of the stripes worry you! They are easy as long as you refridgerate them before you cut. I made checkerboards and yin-yangs, too! They were my first attempt at fancy-looking cookies, and they came out great. Beautiful for gifts, too.

These were easier to prepare than I thought. Slightly crunchy texture and not overly sweet. Appearance is attractive (and I am not good at making things look "pretty"). Their rectangular shape makes a platter of cookies look more "interesting".
