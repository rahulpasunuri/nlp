Unfortunately for my health, I am not a big fan of fish, nor are any members of my family. In an attempt to find some mild fish to get us started in the right direction, I found this recipe and gave it a try. The entire family raved like crazy. It is very easy, and like another reviewer, the 2nd time I made it, I sauteed the fish in the butter after I turned it over so that it cooked in the sauce, vs. just putting the butter on the fish when it was done. I think I like that version better, but either way, it makes for a beatiful meal, worthy of guests for sure!

Made it again for fish tacos. Loved it. Make plenty of butter sauce as it's good on everything.

I am not a fish person...I generally stick to beef, pork, and chicken. That being said, I found this to be refreshing. I used 4 oz. fillets and a jalapeno instead of serrano. I felt like the lime was a bit too heavy for my taste and the heat a little too light but I was impressed. My kids ate it and asked for seconds and even my mom (who hates fish) ate the entire fillet. The tilapia was mild flavored and cooked perfectly at 2 minutes per side. I served it over a bed of roasted garlic flavored couscous and it paired together nicely. I think the next time I would add some cilantro for a bit more freshness and probably up the amount of chile as I like spicy food. All in all it was delicious and made a beautiful presentation on the plate.

Delicious, quick meal. I didn't love the thought of just putting a pat of flavored butter on the fish, so instead I sauteed the fish for a couple of minutes in a small amount of oil, then a couple of minutes before it was done, I added the flavored butter to the saute pan, so the fish cooked in the butter. It formed a beautiful and flavor packed glaze. Even my kids loved it!

We have made this dish several times over the past 3 plus years. Easy and the amount of butter is not a issue ( unless you just hate the thought of using any butter ) I like to mix the serranos with red chili peppers if possible to make the dish even prettier than it is but we normally dont change a thing.

I guess I'm not a fan of putting gobs of butter on fish, at least after it's been sauteed in oil. It just tasted greasy to me. I love the lime, chili and shallots, and the Thai basil that I added. I'll just have to figure out how to impart those flavors without the butter.

So good I didn't want to share it with my stinky housemate, and I don't even like fish. I dredged the fish in egg and a mixture of whole wheat flour and corn meal. For a side, a threw a bunch of chopped veggies that were in my fridge into some brown rice cooked with bouillon. All super easy, great presentation and really tasty.

Love, love, love!!! Used a little finely chopped red onion in place of shallot, extra lime juice and a jalapeno in place of the serrano. Also used Fluke (aka Flounder) and it turned out so delicious. My husband rarely comments on my food unless it's outstanding (I guess he gets TOO MANY good meals) and this one received a good review during dinner AND later that night. I'll definitely make it again...SOON.

For those who have made this several times, what side dishes did you find went best with it? I noticed a number of people served it with some version of Mexican beans and rice, which is probably great, but I'd like to make sure I get some well matched vegetables on the plate instead of an additional protein from the beans and rice. Thanks!

Very good and very easy. Lots of flavor, but not so overwhelming that you can't taste the sweet tilapia. Just wait til you smell the butter after mixing it....nice! Would I make it again? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

Rating: 3
I really like this method of preparing the tilapia. It makes the fish a little meatier. The lime butter is a nice idea, with good flavors, but I think it's better to just cook the fish in the lime butter or melt it completely and pour over as a sauce. I think you can get away with more lime and less butter that way, plus the "dollop" idea is just a little odd - I'd rather not see so much butter on my plate.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, affordable, and all around pretty amazing! Just a few tweaks to the chile-lime butter-- used almost a whole serrano chile, added some extra lime juice & zest, and used garlic salt instead of plain-- and it was perfect. The tilapia was a bit salty and a tad too oily for my taste in conjunction with the butter when cooked as is, so the only thing I would change is eliminating the salt and either using half the oil when pan-searing it, or perhaps baking it. Will definitely make again!

I made this when my boyfriend's mother was in town staying with us and she told him I was a keeper. I think the recipe's a keeper for sure! Because she doesn't like her food too spicy I substituted crushed red pepper for the chilies for still a good burst of flavor without the heat. I'd highly recommend the substitution if you are working for a palate who can't handle the heat of chilies.

The only time I've had something so easy taste this delicious was fresh caught steelhead, sauteed in butter and Tony C's. The chile lime butter was so exceptional it made me completely forget that the fish I bought was totally average. I think the charm of this dish for me was in the simplicity and lack of serious labor.

My husband doesn't like most fish but he's crazy for this. It's in my regular dinner rotation and one of his favorites as a moderately picky eater. I use chipotle powder when I can't find the fresh chile; use ~3/4 tsp for a pretty spicy dish. I like to serve it over rice flavored with garlic and a splash of fish sauce paird with anything fresh and green.

good flavor, easy to make. I used at least double the ingredients for the chile lime butter and it still wasn't quite enough flavor- will use a bit more chiles next time. Other than that, a nice quick recipe with a hot/tangy sauce. Will make again.

Four forks means the dish is exceptional. I gave it 3 forks effortlessly because it is indeed delicious. I will make this dish again and again. Will try dredging Tilapia in a little flour, although it was really finde without it. The butter was great. I will add more chile pepper than what recipe requires, to spice it up just a tad bit more. Great dish!

I thought this recipe sounded far too easy to garner such rave reviews, but I suppose the best dishes are the most elegantly simple. The only modification I made was to press a clove of garlic into the butter and I served it with a quinoa pilaf. Fantastic!!

Loved this! I didn't bother to measure the lime juice or zest (just used the juice and zest of one lime), and it still turned out great! Definitely has a little kick to it, but I didn't find it overwhelmingly spicy. A great weeknight supper that is ready in minutes.

Rating: 4
Love this dish, though I've modified it a bit. I never find serrano peppers, so I sprinkle a bit of cayenne instead. Also, instead of making the butter separately and globbing it on top, I just sautee the fish right in it after dredging with a bit of flour. I'm planning to make it for a BBQ tomorrow for some friends, and I bet they'll like it!

Rating: 4
Fantastic flavor, super fast, and very easy. I had to use a jalepeno and it was great. I broiled the fish instead of messing with it on the stove, and it got a nice brown color as a result -- no flour required. I served it with roasted acorn squash, and drizzled the butter on both. YUM! Should have thought of basmati -- that would be perfect. I think a great addition to the basmati would be chopping some additional shallots & jalepeno, then soaking in lime juice before whisking in olive oil. Would get the flavors into the basmati but lighten up the butter a bit.

This butter is unbelievable and get this...I used SMART BALANCE! I followed everything else exactly.

Super duper! I didn't have the tilapia that I thought I did, so I used Barramundi (sp?) from Australia. I also didn't have the fresh chile, so I used a Thai-style chili-garlic sauce instead of the shallots and chili, and omitted the salt -- enough in the sauce. Soooo yummy. Oh, I also baked the fish because I didn't want to clean my cooktop :)

I've made this exactly as written, and also (for the timid) cutting out the serrano and instead using chopped cilantro (no shallots either, that time) -- and, in the latter case, serving the tilapia on a bed of (storebought! shocking!!) guacamole, nuked just enough to warm. Both ways an easy, festive treat. I think you should flour the tilapia -- better color.

I don't usually review recipes that I modify, or recipes that already have over 400 reviews, but it was so good I had to! We didn't have a bunch of stuff in the recipe, so I used the juice of 1 lime, some sea salt, some super hot chili powder and mixed those together with about 1/2 cup of olive oil. I cooked the fish in a little olive oil with salt and pepper. I grated a whole unpeeled zucchini, squeezed out the water, and fried it in olive oil mixed with some lime juice unti it was crispy. I put the fish over curly endive, and put the fried zucchini over the fish, and then I peeled and jullined some green apple and arranged those on top of the zucchini. The I poured the chili lime oil over the whole thing. It was so good, and really pretty too! I cook every night, and this was restraunt yummy and pretty in about 30 minutes or less! My husband even took a picture! If I were to make it again, I would use two zucchinis or add a yellow squash because I really like vegetables and would have liked more of them. This was good for 2 people.

This was pretty good, but I don't understand all the rave reviews. The chile lime butter didn't mix together (the lime juice stayed separate from the rest of the ingredients) but had a nice flavor and you just needed to make sure you had butter and juice in each spoonful. I might make it again because it is any easy and light, but it's not special enough for company. I also don't get all the people who think this is fattening...by my calculations it has 260 calories, less than 1 gram carbs, 14 grams fat (9 grams fat if you grill it). Two teaspoons butter per serving isn't exactly extravagant.

This was a nice, simple recipe, incredibly difficult to screw up. It is dependent upon the subtle flavor of the fish, so don't overcook it, but it makes an excellent, light dinner which is easy to prepare and the chili-lime butter enhanced it perfectly.

First off this is a good recipe! I tried it once according to this site but then I had to put my spin on it. I found that after following the original recipe it lacked salt, fire & tang. How did I fix that? First off in a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of salt (yes one tablespoon). Next I added double the lime zest and a half; I chopped 1 jalapeno and added a tablespoon & a half of dried red chili pepper. Believe me: it balances out because of the butter. To maximize on flavor, add the salt to a bowl first, followed by the zest, shallot & peppers then the juice. Allow to marinate for a minute. Once I did that, I incorporated everything and wrapped and refrigerated it. To serve: I placed a disk (or 2) of the treated butter on top the fish and I zapped it in the microwave for 30 seconds to help the melting along. IT WAS DIVINITY! Try it! Serve over mashed potatoes and steamed green beans! YUMMY! Oh and by the way to make a nice crust dust the fish with some flour. I used cod -- It was superior to the tilapia.

This is a great simple weeknight dish with lots of flavor and room for variations. I only had jalapeno on hand so added a little more as they are not as hot and I did as other reviewers had done and lightly dusted the fish with seasoned flour and sauted in a mixture of the compound butter and olive oil. I added a little fresh lime at the end because I love lime and served with coconut rice from this site. It was a nice balance with the spicy fish. I am going to try it with jalapeno in adobo sauce next time for a little different flavor plus the butter will be great on grilled corn on the cob.

The butter is GREAT! I used Jalapenos from my garden that had ripened to red - but took out the seeds and just used more pepper. I have also used lemon when lime wasn't on hand and it turns out great whichever way. Usually double the recipe and keep it in the fridge cause I like it on chicken breasts and shrimp too. Don't understand why you would sautee the fish instead of just broiling or baking--which I did with a some of the chile lime butter. And it turns out GREAT. For that matter--throw the fish in a foil packet with some of the butter and grill it!

After I made the butter mixture, I was a bit turned off by the amount of fat we were going to consume. I made the mixture again, this time with 1/4 cup olive oil instead. I wrapped the fish in foil, drizzled with the chile lime oil and baked in the oven for 30 minutes... the fish was moist, flavorful and my 5 guests all loved it! I did use a TBS of the butter mixture to sauté my side dish of corn, red & orange bell pepper & cilantro... turned out fabulous, add a bed of jasmine rice and tuck in!

This is flat-out fantastic! Regarding the peppers, do try to get red serrano chiles - they provide a deeper flavor and a better visual display than the green. Either will work, however. I usually pair this with brown rice and kale - makes for a pretty healthy meal, and is so quick to prepare.

FABULOUS! Since nearly everyone raved about the chile lime butter I made a double batch. Oh, my gosh am i ever glad i did!

What a simple and delicious way to impress your guests this took me about 20 minutes to make. The fish was perfect and the chile lime butter was a HUGE hit !

Another adjustment I made was adding a little sprinkle of paprika on top of the butter for a little extra kick and it makes a great garnish as well ... ENJOY !!!

Used jalapino and made the butter the night before. The store only had frozen tilapia ($5 lb)so I used fresh catfish ($6.50 lb). Pan fried some straight and some in corn meal. Definitely sprinkle some salt on the fish (or crust) -- it was a bit bland. Both were great but I preferred the one with the corn meal crust. I have some cod in the freezer and will try it again soon. I liked this just fine but wasn't crazy about it like some reviewers.

I made this for my husband to be. I should have doubled the chile lime butter, because it was so good! I do not like fish, so I made him tilapia and chicken for me. It seemed liked the pepper was going to be too much, but with the lime juice, it was fantastic. My word of advice is to not take a bite of the dish, before you are 100% ready to eat, because you will eat the whole thing(that is what my fiancee did). He ate two pieces of fish, before my chicken was done! :)

This recipe is a keeper. This is one of those recipes that will end up becoming a regular at our dinner table. I like making tasty and easy fish dishes for the family. My kids, ages 6 and 8 ate it without complaining and my husband loved it. I used red onion instead of shallots and a dash of cayenne instead of the fresh chile pepper.

My wonderful sister made this for me when I visited her, and introduced me to this site.....I have modified the basic preparation for a more "generic taste" to include a light spread of butter on each filet prior to placing in frying pan, as well as adding a dash of lemon juice to a mixture of half butter/half olive oil in the pan. I used another type of light white sauce instead of the chile lime butter; easy & delicious! I am NOT a cook, and even I could handle this one!

Very simple and tasty. Green Serano peppers are okay, and subbing red onion for shallots is fine, too.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe, though I can't say it's beyond compare. I'd like to give it 3.5 forks. I have a few modifications to share. First, instead of just sprinkling salt on the fish, I dipped it into egg whites and then coated it with Panko bread crumbs before cooking. Second, I made two chile lime butters- one used jalapeno (no serrano available), the other used chipotles in adobo sauce. My husband and I prefer it with chipotle lime butter.

I loved it -- my husband gave it a B+ (but I don't think he used enough of the delicious chili-lime butter. I thought it was so convenient and easy and tilapia is so reasonably priced. This is a great weekday meal. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using very finely minced onion instead of shallots (which I forgot at the market). It worked out fine.

With all the fantastic reviews, I was really expecting something special with this dish. Although it was certainly easy to make, I've found several other recipes for fish on Epicurious that I like a lot better. I'll probably give this a second try, especially since I used green onions + garlic since shallots were nowhere to be found this week at the store, but so far I'm not loving it.

Chefs would probably cringe, but I made two versions of this recipe: one with the lime butter, and the other with lime "oil" (butter substituted with olive oil for my lactose-intolerant guest). I marinated the latter, because I was afraid it would end up flavourless. On the contrary! The marinated oil version was phenomenal, while the butter version was "ok". So, I'd make this recipe again in marinated form with oil. Oh yeah, and I grilled it instead of pan-frying.

This is so easy especially once you make the butter and just keep it in the fridge. The tilapia cooks so quickly. The flavour of lime is very refreshing. I used fresh jalapeno which worked fine but I will use more next time. I serve with some veggies and you have a great, fast, low carb meal.

The fish is wonderful. I did alter the recipe. I dipped the fish in egg, then flour, then egg, and then in panko and fried the fish with very little oil. It was so crisp! I sauteed the shallots, chili and remaining ingredients in the butter for about 5 minutes. For each serving of fish I poured the chili-lime butter on top. It was so yummy.

I was just looking for a simple and fast fish recipe and what I found was a real treasure. The flavors of the butter makes me think of margaritas on a hot summer day. A breeze to make and tons of flavour to boot.I used only 1/2 tsp of butter per fillet and it was plenty.A definite Keeper !!

This is a perfect example of a simple recipe gone great! Other than cutting the portions back (there are only two of us) I made no changes. I wouldn't have thought you get the taste of kamfir lime with a normal lime.. but it works, simple and tastes like pretty credible Thai. This will become a staple.... PS.. try it without dredging the fish, the technique here is a nice change and it works with lightness of the chili lime butter. Jim

Super easy & fast to make. Didn't have chilis on hand, so added several dashes of Mongolian Fire Oil and the chili butter tasted delicious. The lime was a great counterpoint to the chili oil. A large dollop of the butter was almost too much; you could probably double the amount of fish but still use the same amount of butter. This is a winner!

Put into a foil packet and put it in the toaster oven for about 20 mins. However, this recipe is also terrific as is!

I liked this dish quite well. My husband loved it. I think the butter makes more than enough...I had leftovers. I had some trouble with the tilapia sticking to the pan instead of frying a nice golden brown, which was somewhat frusterating, but it might be my pan. The heat from the chili butter is quite strong so if you're not a hot hot chili person like me, you might want to sweep the chili and lime remains off the fish once the butter has melted down a bit. My husband likes things a bit warmer and he enjoyed his without any changes. A very flavorful and interesting dish. Worth making again.

This is a GREAT dish... We served it with fresh from the farm corn on the cob and garden tomatoes , still warm from the sunshine :-) We did dust the fish with flour because I thought it would make it a little more golden color. We also used the butter on the corn and WOW thatwas good. The only down side to this was that my family ate about twice as much Tilapia than they normally do.

This is a great weeknight dish. The lime and chile are lovely, bright flavors with the richness of the butter. As other reviewers have suggested I also dust my fillets in flour mixed with a little bit of pepper- keeps it from sticking to the pan and seems to boost the flavor a bit. This is a tasty dish that can be put together in minutes. I pull this recipe out of my culinary "bag of tricks" when I don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen- and it works every time!

Given all the 3 and 4 fork reviews, guess I expected to be wowed. This was OK but nothing special, although did enjoy the lime butter. Its main claim to fame seems to be "quick and easy with minimal effort". There are far better fish recipes out there so won't bother with this one again.

We really enjoyed this dish. We were fighting over the last fillet. I made the chile lime butter mixture in the mini chopper in a matter of minutes. I used red Thai peppers, which gave it a serious zing. We grilled the fish on the gas grill and paired it with Thai Ceasar Salad (from the deli at Whole Foods) and fruit salad. The other reviewers are right on about the chile lime butter. We have plenty left, but that is a good thing! Next time (tomrrow) I think I will try the left over butter with a more dense fish, scallops or shrimp. This is a definite keeper for a quick tasty week night meal.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. My Husband is leary of new recipes, but he went back for seconds. I had to substitute a few ingredients because the grocery store didn't have what I needed (small town). I could not find serrano peppers, took others advice and used crushed red pepper. I seasoned tilapia with Old Bay seasoning and Gold Medal Wondra flour. I couldn't find shallots or unsalted butter so I used green onions and regular margarine. Fixed rice pilaf and mixed veggies as sides seasoned with the extra chile lime butter. Will definitely fix again.

Oh my. Yum yum. Had to use jalapeno and remove the rind and seed for a wimpy hubby. Will try w/ more hardy friends w/a warmer chili.

Used saffron (thank you Trader Joe's for competitive prices - hope to see u in KC soon) and fresh cilantro. I felt like a star! Thanks epi and all you chefs who share your recipes on this site.

The butter really is key ( I also used red pepper flakes). I have made this a couple of times and have decided that it is even better on grilled tilapia than seared. I marinated the fish in a bit of lime juice and teriyaki for about 15 minutes and served with the butter.YUM!

I halved the recipe for 2 people -- which still yields plenty of compound butter. Here's an idea: about an hour before dinner, drape a small bowl with plastic wrap, then combine the butter ingredients in it, and, once mixed, roll the butter in the plastic wrap into a log, and place in the fridge. Once hardened, you can slice coins of butter that present better than the "dollop." I followed other reviewers' suggestions and lightly dredged the fish in salted flour. Overall it was really tasty and quick, -- when I make it again I'll do it without the crust -- and I can't wait to try the butter on other things.

Such a great, simple recipe. Unfortunately, I couldn't find serrano chiles at either of two grocery stores, so I wound up with a completely non-spicy variety. To compensate, I added a few red pepper flakes. Even so, the flavor was great, and went especially well served over Hot and Sour Coleslaw.

After reading all the comments, I just HAD to finally make this...it did live up to all the positive comments. As many reviewers suggested, I dredged the fish in seasoned flour (garlic powder, chili powder, S&P). I used olive oil and had no problems with the fish sticking. I deglazed the pan with some sauvignon blanc, and when reduced, I added the butter to cook the shallots for a few moments. My whole family enjoyed it. I did add some garlic to the butter and put in some of the chili seeds. Not too hot, even for my heat-adverse teenage son.

I used Orange Roughy because Whole Foods doesn't carry Tilapia anymore (they said they're using growth hormones on them now). It was fantastic. I have cooked very little fish in my life but this was easy as can be. I did dredge the filets in flour but otherwise didn't change anything.

GORGEOUS!! I started off making the coriander rice from this site (adding toasted pine nuts) Meanwhile, I doubled the butter sauce. Used it to quickly saute shrimp which I served as an app, and then made the tilapia, dredging in seasoned flour and using the butter instead of oil to cook. I served the fish on a bed of baby spinach - which I didn't bother wilting - just placed the fish straight from the pan, and it wilted itself. There wasn't a DROP of food leftover. Those who were full kept eating until it was gone because it was so tasty and good!! I made this last night, and am on my way to the grocery store to buy more tilapia and shrimp! Warning: those susceptible to addiction should avoid!

This has become our favorite recipe: very easy and very tasty. Every ingredient in the butter mix is essential and in the right proportion (assuming you have a good pepper). I supplement it with stirr-fried onion potatoes and cale or other greens.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I lightly floured the fillets as other have suggested, because I think fish browns more nicely this way. I had an extra serrano chili on hand but didn't need to use it. A good way to store seasoned butter: form into a roll, wrap in waxed paper and freeze, then just slice some off when you need it.

Rating: 3
The fish was very good and easy to prepare. The chile lime butter was not very flavorful (not spicy enough despite adding two serrano chiles with all the seeds--maybe my chiles were just not hot that day) and it made way too much. You do not need a whole cube of butter to go with this amount of fish. I know it would have been great if I had spicier chiles. The lime flavor was very nice.

I ALSO BAKED THE FISH THE SECOND TIME AND IT WAS YUMMY.

Excellent! Did not change a thing and served over a bed curried jasmine rice...really got lots of compliments.

I loved this recipe! Although my husband thought it wasn't very flavorful. Next time I make it, I'm going to double the shallots, lime juice, lime zest and serrano chili to give it a little more of a kick for my husband. This was such an easy recipe to follow. I served the tilapia with spanish rice and some steamed broccoli.

For its incredible simplicity alone it deserves 4 forks - the taste is just a bonus. It is really hard to screw up.

Great recipe! Made this twice and both times I made half the butter and it was plenty. Did not dredge fish in flour. Layered sliced onion and lime in roasting pan. Placed tilapia on top of onions and lime. Adds great flavor. Seasoned fish with spicy seasoned salt. Roasted for 15 mins. then spread butter mixture on top, baked for few more mins. Served with mexican rice and veggies. My husband ate every bite! Loved it!

A quick and inexpensive entree that my guests loved. As suggested by other reviewers, I dredged the fish in seasoned flour before cooking. Later, I also tried the reviewer suggestion of cooking it in some of the seasoned butter instead of oil, but found I prefered saving the (extremely delicious) butter to use as a softened but not melted topping, as called for in the original recipe.

I used a canned jalpeno pepper since that's all I had, and several cloves of roasted garlic (for the same reason) and despite having to zest 1t of fresh lime, it was very easy. Extremely tasty - and my spouse agrees, so we'll make it again.

Very quick and very good. Used Orange Roughy since store was out of Tilapia and I baked the fish with the butter. My husband couldn't stop sopping up the sauce - with his corn, with some bread, with his fingers...We'll make again - flavor with this little effort is definitely 3 forks.

I used this idea rather than following the exact recipe, after seeing it in the section so many times. I didn't have any fresh chiles or shallots but made the butter w/ lime juice and zest, a little minced garlic, crushed red pepper and salt and pepper (I didn't measure anything). I shook the tilapia in flour before sauteeing in peanut oil, then put a good dab of the butter over each filet, served on some jasmine rice to soak up the extra butter. It went really well with broccolini sauteed in another dab of the butter. I only made about 2 tablespoons worth but it's so flavorful, we didn't even use it all on three filets. so easy, I will definitely do this and variations again. (I used frozen tilapia from Trader Joe's, which is very inexpensive and thaws quickly.)

awesome, but i would change one thing. I had way too much butter sauce. And it is very fattening. Next time, I will fully melt the butter, and make half the amount. otherwise, perfect.

Well I admit I was quite surprised by this recipe. I am considered by some to be somewhat of a food snob and so I naturally thought that something so simple couldn't be all that. I was definitely humbled - This was outstanding! I will make this again and again and I can't wait to try the butter on other white fish. I did follow another reviewer's advice however, and sauteed the shallot and garlic (I added a clove of chopped, it really makes it) just for one minute in a little butter and olive oil and then added the peppers,lime zest, juice - then turned off the heat and added more butter - this made it more like a sauce but kept the nice bright color of the chili pepper for your presentation. I think the key here is to use really fresh fish though.

We've made this twice so far and love it. The first time I substituted some green onion and a clove of garlic for the shallots and actually preferred that version to actual recipe. I think the clove of garlic adds a little something. Also, don't be afraid of adding a little extra pepper. The butter's better and more complex tasting when it has a kick.

A delicious recipe with wonderful flavours, but I made a couple of modifications that I felt enhanced the flavours. First, I sauteed the shallots, chile and lime zest together in a little oil for 5 minutes, added the lime juice and heated for another 2, then prepared the butter; this sweetened the shallots and blended the flavours much better than when the ingredients were raw. Secondly, I chose not to sautee the tilapia in oil; rather, I sauteed it in 2/3 the butter and saved the rest for the side. A much more flavourful result!

Rating: 4
I was needing to add a couple new dishes to the "rotation" and thought this would be perfect. My husband loves lime, chilies and fish so this was a big hit. We served this tilapia with a spanish-style rice and some wonderful wine. It is now the featured meal of the week in our house! Easy to make and highly recommended!

Great fast and easy dish--I loved the lime butter and the fish was so quick to cook. The only change I made was to roll the fish in flour(with salt and pepper) prior to cooking so it had a little crust. My husband and kids all loved this dish.

I made this recipe as designed and it was very good... The lime/chile butter is outstanding, and I substituted vadalia onions for shallots. I then made it again, and put two tilapia fillets in foil with a dallop of the lime butter on it, sealed the foil packet, put in on a cookie sheet in a 400 oven for 8-12 minutes and it was actually much better. The fish wasn't crispy like when it was fried and the smell when you opened the packet was devine! Even my 8yr old said.."what is that great smell?" The entire fish was infused witht he lime/chile butter and it was great....try this and see what you think. Another thought, how about wrapping indiviual fillets in parchment, baking in the oven and serving...The aroma when you open the package is wonderful.

I made this last night for an intimate dinner party and it was fantastic! What a wonderful flavor. I am a picky fish eater, and don't like anything too 'fishy tasting.' This was light, yet very flavorful. I wonder if I can make a batch of the butter and freeze it to have on hand? I bet this would be great on boneless chicken breasts, too!

Rating: 4
the lime-butter for this is *incredible!* - the lime makes it taste so light, even though it's butter! and the chilis leave a great warmth on your tongue. i saute the shallots before add them to the butter, it gives a great carmelized taste.

I tried this recipe using flounder and just as everyone else stated--it was wonderful. I always double marinades/sauces to ensure that there is plenty, so the next day when I grilled our hamburgers I topped the burgers with the remaining chile lime butter and they were also very goooood!

This was so good and really easy. I melted the chili butter ingredients in a pan and poured on top of the fish. Divine.

This was really a magnificent dish - but I made a few modifications. First of all, I used Orange Roughy rather than Tilapia. Secondly, when I was done sauteeing the fish, there were lots of brown bits at the bottom of the pan, so I added a few more minced shallots, sauteed for 10 seconds, then deglazed with a dry white wine (I used a Mexican Semillon) and then after 10 more seconds or so, I added some more of the chili-lime butter so that I had something like a beurre-blanc. Then I poured that liquid over the fish and it was absolutely superb. I think the wine gave a nice tartness that the butter alone was missing. And I don't recommend flouring the fish since orange roughy has such a nice flavor on its own - why cover it up?

Rating: 4
Delicious and so easy! Any dish that can make my picky daughter finish her plate deserves 4 stars! I also lightly dredged in Emeril's Essence and flour which gave the fish another layer of flavor and texture. For kids, I made the butter w/out chilis and scooped it out for them. Then, I added the chilis to the remaining mixture for us. Highly recommend if you don't know what to make for dinner. Make a lot of butter and save it!

I've tried this twice now, using jalapeno as that was the only hot pepper available in my market. I followed the recipe for everything else. Delicious, quick and easy - a definite repeat.

I give this ***1/2. This was really good. I dredged the fish in flour seasoned with Essence (the Emeril stuff) and pan fried in the chili-lime butter which really brought out the flavor of the pepper and shallots and also made a nice golden crust. It was very yummy but a "little bit" spicy for me (but that was my fault - i doubled the butter recipe and used too much of the seranno pepper - actually the whole pepper - just because it was there :)). My Husband loved it and immediately added more butter onto his fish and also onto his corn. He likes more spice than me. Anyway, I have plenty of butter leftover and will definately make this again. With the butter already made, it only takes about 5 minutes to prepare - perfect for a midweek meal

Yes! prepare the tilapia any way you wish, this "butter" will go great. I used store-bought chili paste and it was great!

Ok, I know better but can't help myself. It is too funny that someone was "appalled" at Maria's use of the word "vegetarian". "Appalled"? How does this person manage to live life if he/she is so upset by mere words written by someone who he/she doesn't know, will probably never meet and would probably not invite him/her to dinner anyway?

This was so simple and great. It literally takes 4 minutes to cook the fish, and a little longer to make the chile lime butter, which was a great compliment.

For those of you who are flaming the reviewer who said this could be served to vegetarians, you might want to do a little research the next time. There are 4 types of vegetarians: semi-vegetarians-those who do not eat red meat but consume poultry, seafood, and dairy products, and these people, myself included, would eat this recipe, pesco vegetarians-those who do not eat red meat or poultry, lacto-ovo vegetarians- those who do not eat red meat, poultry, or seafood, and vegans- those who eat absolutely no food that contains any animal product whatsoever. And an aside to the reviewer from Leeds, UK, perhaps in the UK you don't call people pesco-vegetarians, but in the US it is a term that is used by vegetarians, and *gasp* even by people in the medical field when they are assessing the type of diet people follow.

This is one terrific recipe! As others have said...simple and delicious (my basic criteria for cooking!) I didn't have unsalted butter but regular butter worked just fine (although I adjusted down the salt in the recipe). I also added chopped cilantro to the butter mixture and it was perfect. As others have done, I dredged the fish lightly in seasoned flour (salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin) and it gave the fish a great "crust" while sauteeing in the olive oil. This kept warm in the oven well for 30 minutes while waiting to serve dinner. I probably used more butter on each fillet than called for...but couldn't help it...it was soooo good. A definite winner!!!

I was very impressed with this recipe, and it was so easy to make. I sauteed the fish in the butter instead of oil, and it turned out great. I used habanero chile peppers and they were perfect. Adding some garlic in there might be nice too, and I think I'll try it that way next time. I served the fish with Mexican white rice (recipe on epicurious.com), which balanced the pepper on the fish quite nicely. A mixed field greens salad rounded out the meal that turned out to be a big hit. For dessert, I suggest the Margarita Chiffon cake recipe on this site.

I'm just not a big fan of Tilapia. I mistrust Aqua-Culture and a fish that can can be mass produced and grown because it can adapt to many types of water conditions. Where is your Tilapia coming from? Mainland China, perhaps? Who regulates these fish holes? My advice, do this dish with Halibut...the sauce works great.

This is a great recipe. My husband and I have eaten it twice now. I followed the advice to dredge the fish in flour before cooking it and it is great.

I plan on making this one again.

I made this dish for my husband and mother, and it met rave reviews. I used a whole serrano chile, added a large clove of garlic, and used a bit more shallot.

Since finding this recipe a few weeks ago, I have made the recipe twice (once for our family and then for company), and it's DELICIOUS!! The butter really cuts back the heat of the pepper (I was afraid it'd be too much heat for me) and really lets the flavors of the lime and pepper come through wonderfully. I'm sure you could use the butter on any mild fish. I served this with two other recipes from Epicurious.com: Mexican White Rice and Stuffed Tomatoes with Grilled Corn Salad. All plates were clean. I was sad I hadn't made more of everything! Can't wait to make it again!!

Definitely need to spice up the fish...I first marinated fish in chile powder, cumin, thyme, garlic, a little nutmeg, lime juice, s&p, then cooked. Was pretty good. And I agree, lay off Maria....it was a matter of semantics, so get off your stinkin' high horse!

I found this dish to be exceedingly bland. Instead of tasting better than the sum of its parts, it's just boring fish with chili pepper and a bit of raw onion flavor. Definitely not worth the loads of calories and cholesterol from the butter. What a disappointment.

Maria, I am appalled you would even think about serving a vegetarian meat of any sort! I am a carnivore through and through, but I would never assume my eating habits onto someone else if they don't eat meat for whatever reason. Now, a "pescetarian" will eat fish; I pray that is the word you were looking for.

I have to agree with the poster from San Francisco. Although many people are cutting out all meat except fish, that doesn't make them vegetarians (it may make them healthier!) As an ovo-lacto vegetarian, I will say that the recipe is nice for vegetarians who want to cook for omnivores. It doesn't really require checking for taste b/c it's so straightforward.

Wonderful recipe for a first-timer with tilapia - kudos on the taste and the ease of preparation!!! I used Olivio spread instead of stick butter, to cut-own on saturated fat. Next time, I'll dredge in flour and will add more shallots and peppers. Very tasty with a side of asparagus and corn salad.

Will perhaps try the Chile Lime Butter on other kinds of fish. The tilapia was so bland that even the butter couldn't spice it up enough to be a hit at our house.

This dish was fantastic! I'm a new cook and was afraid of making a main course of fish. However, this recipe was easy to follow and I didn't experience the 'sticking' problem (my pans are made of teflon). This recipe is definitely one to keep on the short cooking list.

This was terrific and easy. Made it as called for, sort of. Couldn't find Thai or serrano chiles, so we used orange habanero. Since the habanero is hotter, we seeded it. Other than that, followed the recipe. We loved it. Like the idea of the flour crust, sauteing in the butter, etc., but really even as written it's great. We made this a while ago, and really forgot about it, but we had made extra butter and kept in the freezer until tonight when we used it to saute some chicken breasts with diced ham, peppers and onions. Also great. We're going to make some more of the butter this week to keep on hand. I'd love to try it on shrimp.

Recently food has become interesting and exciting. My 5 year-old (very picky) has not stopped asking about it since 3 weeks ago. He wants fish nightly for supper now! Cooking is great fun, I shared the recipe with 2 co-workers, who are very eager to try it.

This was an easy weekday meal. I had frozen tilapia fillets in the freezer and had the other ingredients on hand. The only change I would make would be to add a little butter to the pan with the oil. That way the fish will get a nice crust on it and also be a little easier to flip over. I served this with the mixed baby greens with bacon and herbs on this site.

Easy and economical to make - a great recepie for those of us who don't even like fish! Next time I'm going to try the reduced fat version suggested in the comment section. We've also sauted the fish right in the butter - great too!

Rating: 4
I rated this recipe four forks, not only because it is absolutely delicious, but it is SO easy to prepare. I followed the suggestions to dredge in flour and I also melted the lime butter in the pan before pouring over the fish so the shallots could cook a little. I had no problems with the fish sticking, but I did use a non-stick pan as suggested. Wonderful flavor, will make for company.

I made this recipe on a weeknight while babysitting! It was quick and easy and the chile lime butter was tasty. I didn't have the fresh chiles so I used crushed red pepper instead. This butter would also be delicious on corn on the cob!! While I liked the flavor, I felt that it was a little too high in fat. Any suggestions on how to make the sauce lowfat?

I have lurched here for quite awhile and never written a review but this is the easiest, fastest, and most awsome recipe that I have run across on this site. My family has made it repeatedly and it always a winner. The lime and shallot give it a unique and flavorful taste that is just delightful. I have also put it on basra, bass we caught fishing and other fish and it is still terrific. As with other reviewers, I strongly advise making a lot of extra butter as it will go fast and you can just take any extra you have out of the fridge the next day for any leftovers to boot. I have also used dried chilies and even the dried up pizza topping chilies that you get at Pizza Hut and the like when I do not have fresh chilies avaliable, it is still terrific!

Dredging fish with flour is key and helped crisp it up. I didn't have chiles on hand, so I chopped up some chipotle in adobo sauce, and it was wonderful! Added a hint of smokey-ness that made it more interesting than a chili pepper would have. Served with wilted watercress. Would definitely make again!

This was an easy, delicious fish dish. I also followed the suggestion to dredge the tilapia in flour prior to cooking. I did not have the serrano or jalepeno pepper, but did have a powdered chipotle pepper which I used in the butter. It was delicious. My husband, and even the kids thought it was tasty.

The sauce is KILLER! So good. I've made it twice in one week! I add the chili lime butter to the pan after removing the fish then I pour it over the fish and serve from a serving dish. That works wonderfully. The recipe is enough for 4 but we never seem to eat the accompaniments, just the fish. I sponge up the remaining sauce with broccoli and its just delicious on that too. I've made it for several dinners and guests all rave about it. Easy to do and Excellent taste.

Simple and tasty. The tilapia does stick to the pan a bit, but it ended up ok. I've tried it with several kinds of peppers ... including just dried cayenne when I was in a real hurry, and it was still tasty.

Very good, quick recipe. I took other reviewers' advice, and dredged tilapia in flour. I used a cast iron skillet, and had no trouble with sticking, and the flour gave the outside a nice crispness. The butter is so flavorful! I did have a little trouble mixing in the lime juice, maybe because I used margarine?? It tasted great anyway!

I made a triple batch of the butter - as suggested by other cooks, and I'm so glad I did! I made teaspoon-sized portions, and froze the leftovers...makes this recipe so easy to repeat later! The butter is also very good for sauteing shrimp and great on rice.

This was good. It definitely did stick but that was to be expected. The butter had a nice kick to it. It was fine but not amazing.

Rating: 3
I cook lots of fish lots of different ways and never had any difficulty with 'sticking' before. Using this method, it stuck big-time! It stuck so badly that the fillets in the first batch ended up in about 15 pieces. So I cleaned out the skillet and regrouped. For the second batch, I added a good bit more oil and lightly dredged each piece in flour as someone suggested. (Thanks for the tip!) It was a huge improvement. Both the color and the taste were much, much more appetizing. At first, the butter seemed like a huge flop, too -- just a big, hard blob on top (even though it had been left out to reach room temp as directed). About halfway through dinner, though, the butter finally melted. At that point, this whole disappointing meal did a 180. Once it liquified, the butter 'sauce' was scrumptious!! Next time, I think I'll broil the fish, putting the butter on top for the last 3 or 4 min. of cooking time. This one definitely needs 'tweaking', but the lime butter has some real possibilities!

REstaurant good. I got around the sticking problem by heating the nonstick skillet and spraying with Pam before adding the oil. I used a wide spatula and the fish did not stick. I agree that the amount of chile-lime butter should be increased and used liberally, and that it is wonderful on just plain rice as well as on the fish.

Excellent. The flavors were outstanding. My husband is not a fish lover but couldn't get enough of this dish! My grocery store did not have either chile so I used jalepenos, which tasted fine. I too had trouble with the fish sticking to the pan and am looking for a suggestion from preventing this in the future.

Just mad this tonight. Yummy! Even my fish hating 9yr old liked it. I served this with rice pilaf and everyone added the chili lime butter to the rice on their plate. If in doubt, make more! Also, the chili was not at all overpowering. It added a very nice flavor, but we did not find it at all spicey-hot. will make it again, and again.

This chile lime butter is one of the best quick fixes I have ever found! Fabulous on Tilapia, Salmon, Chicken, Corn-on-the-Cob... need I go on? If you are in the Boston area, and therefore lucky enough to be able to get "Crushed Hot Peppers" in a jar- try a teaspoon of these for the chile. They give a fabulous color and taste (don't turn the butter a funky brown color).

I cooked one pound of tilapia for two, but made the whole amount of chile lime butter. I'm glad I did. We also put some on our plain steamed broccoli, and there's not much of the butter left. If anyone out there is making the whole 30 to 36 ounces of fish, I'd suggest a lot more of the butter compound which can be frozen if needed. One-half teaspoon of salt in the butter seemed too much to me considering the fillets are also salted, so I cut it back to 1/4 teaspoon. (Note the reviewer who had to drink a lot of water to get through the meal!) Also I left the seeds from the pepper out of my mix. For our tastes these two adjustments were just right. Delicious way to prepare tilapia, and probably other non-oily fish as well.

We will definitely make this again but use caution with the peppers.

I'm not a big fish eater but this recipe sounded too good to pass up. My family loved it.
