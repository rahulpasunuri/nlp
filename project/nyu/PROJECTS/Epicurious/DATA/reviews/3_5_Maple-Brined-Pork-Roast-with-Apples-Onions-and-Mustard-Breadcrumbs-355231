This is good, but quite a bit of work. Also the cooking time is as long as stated in the recipe if you're using a bone-in roast.

Disappointed with this recipe, although it seems to have a lot of potential. The pork itself was great, but the apple/onion mixture was very unappetizing. If I make this another time, I would definitely cook the pork on a rack in a stove top safe roaster. The juices and brown bits could have made a great sauce. I think I would also try blending the onion/apple mixture with some blue cheese and applejack.

This was fantastic! There are no leftovers. I did not have Dijon, so I used a stone ground and German mustard instead. I added about a tablespoon of extra mustard just because.

Recipe was fantastic, cut of meat not so much. I did not get the chine bone remove so my bad. However the flavor was stupendous, a real stand out. Not overly salty as some suggested. I will make again just to try with fresh sage. Also, not a fan of maple syrup so used organic agave nectar which suited us just fine.

As others pointed out, the cooking time on this is stated as far too long. Use a meat thermometer to gauge what's best. Also, do not brown it on high heat for six minutes as recipe suggests. It will burn. Brown on medium heat. Otherwise, it turned out dee-lish.

Wow. This was soooo good. I love the brined flavor but would want to be cautious for those who can't have too much salt in their diet. Definitely a keeper!

I made this about two weeks ago and think it was the best pork roast I have made. I made extra breadcrumbs and served with roasted rutabaga. Fun fall feast!

I baked a small, boneless pork roast, and it turned out great. Next time I will cut back on the salt, add apples and reduce the onions. Definitely will make this again!

My roast roasted to 140 degrees in 1.5 hours. It was very juicy. However, the recipe seemed like it was missing something.

This was delicious, but the cooking time was entirely too long. It took 45 minutes from start to finish on a regular non-convection oven. The apples and onions were also cooked perfectly after 45 minutes. I made up my own bread crumb recipe that I sauteed in garlic and butter with a parsley and olive oil sauce. overall, a good meal. just watch that you don't cook the pork one degree over 140.

FABULOUS!!! I had read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical, but gave it a try. Followed the recipe exactly - AMAZING! I swear by brining (meat cooked faster than i expected, took out at 150F and still moist!!), used tart granny smiths and were perfect. Bread crumbs yummy. Served at a dinner party with over roasted carrots, wild rice w/apples and pecans and sauteed green beans: RAVE REVIEWS. Including BEST PORK EVER HAD!!!

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was delicious - I'm always concerned about pork loin drying out but the brining seemed to take care of that even though I misread the cooking temperature and roasted at 425 instead of 325!! And wondered why a 7-pound roast cooked in an hour and a half. Seven dinner guests raved about it. Will definitely make again and try the brining in other pork loin recipes.

I loved this recipe! I changed it a bit as I always play with the recipe ! I change the cider by 1 cup of apple cider vinagre 3/4cup of Pineau des charantes (but you could use Cognac or Calvados or Sweet White Wine)and 1/2 cup of apple juice !! The result was awesome ! Well balance between the tagnyness of the vinagre and the sweetness of juice and Pineau des Charentes !I also took the roast out of the oven at 130 and let it sit(cover) for 20 min. A quick note on the apple cider if you choose to us this, ther are a variety of cider from very dry to very sweet and that will make the difference in your result ! Bon Appetit!

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was way TOO SWEET. I consider myself a decent cook, but I don't even know how I would fix it. I was disappointed as I put in a lot of effort for something that really did not taste good to me or my husband and friends.

I just tried making this dish for dinner tonight, and the pork tasted AMAZING. I used a much smaller piece of meat (pork tenderloin), which was done in 40 minutes. I made the brine as directed and the sage and maple flavors were great - definitely a keeper. The maple/mustard glaze was great too, I put some extra out on the table for a dipping sauce. I'm giving it three stars though because I wasn't crazy about the vegetables on the side; the onions and the apples were pretty good, but somehow the celery did not seem to fit and gave the whole mix an odd taste. I think I'll make it again and leave the celery out.
