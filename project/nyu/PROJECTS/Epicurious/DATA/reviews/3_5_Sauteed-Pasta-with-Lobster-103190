This recipe would've been a DISASTER if I hadn't sprayed everything down with Pam, first.

I've made this probably a dozen times with one big modification -- I skip the whole lobster thing and use Better Than Bouillon lobster base and add shrimp at the last minute. It's still a lot of work, but it's crazy delicious and good for a dinner party.

Followed all of the instructions. This was a terrible waste of a lobster

And I made it for our New Year's Eve dinner for 2003. It is that kind of a dish. It was just delicious. Sauteeing the angel hair added a nice flavor and the tomato sofregit was the perfect addition. I did not find it that much work. Perhaps because I only prepared 1/4 the recipe (it was just the two of us) and I spread the work over a couple of days since I had purchased the live lobster the weekend before. This definitely will become a favorite meal for a festive occasion.

This dish is definitely a lot of work but was interesting and fun to do. I had never fried dry pasta before! It is worth it for a special occasion - I made it for New Year's Eve and used lobster tails. It was DELECTABLE!!!!

This recipe is extraordinary! The flavors are so wonderful and varied and different. The recipe itself is a lot of work, but it is more than worth it when you taste the results. I am definitely making it again.
