Delicious, AND it freezes well, although the chicken breasts toughen on reheating in microwave. I added chopped mushrooms, and thickened the sauce with a bit of flour.Definitely a keeper.

I left out the bay and really caramelized the onions. Also used a touch of flour to thicken the sauce and added some fresh thyme from the garden.

I omitted the wine (did not have any on hand) and added lemon. I let it reduce for a while, and it was quite flavorful.

Great! After reading the reviews below, I carmelized the onions for extra flavor and only used about 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth. Delicious and quite simple to prepare.

I thought it was delicious and quick. I would definitely add garlic and I reduced the amount of broth to about 1 cup and it turned out great!

Use far less broth or thicken sauch with a teaspoon or two of flour. A couple cloves of garlic and a few dashes of cumin helps to up the flavor content

adding the red peppers as suggested helped, but i agree, still seemed bland. nice preparation method for chicken though.

I added Red Peppers and Mushrooms to the Onions and that didn't do much to the flavor. It was a bit more bland than I thought it would be. I would not make this again....there are so many others to try.

Is it just me, or were there way too many onions? I am usually the one who adds more onions and garlic to recipes, but I found the onions to be overwhelming (Did I chop them too much?). For mashed potatoes the liquid is too thin, but if it is put over noodles it's fine (after reducing it somewhat). This recipe was passable but I won't make it again when there are so many wonderful recipes out there to try!

so good, especially over egg noodles. I added some chopped mushrooms to the sauce, as someone else suggested. a tasty and quick way to cook chicken breasts!

This is a great dish & easy too. I used boneless skinless breasts and it turned out so juicy and tender! Also, supermarket was out of fresh rosemary. I substituted dry and it had great flavor. I fixed with mashed potatoes and brocolli as my sides.

Very easy to make, and it came out quite well. I halved the chicken broth for the sake of time, though I imagine if you have the patience to let it all reduce, the full amount of broth will be a bit more flavorful.

My boyfriend liked this recipe. It was fast and easy, but I should have followed the advice of other ratings and used less chicken broth. The sauce was very thin and a bit bland. I did add minced garlic, and next time I will use less broth. Served with asparagus and chicken veggie rice.

This was OK, but not intriguing enough to make again. It was relatively easy to prepare, and had decent flavor. But the sauce was very liquidy despite my attempt to reduce it, and it just didn't pack the flavor punch I was hoping for. I like mild-flavored dishes, but this one was just too mild. There are better chicken dishes that are also easy to prepare, so I will not be making this one again.

I liked this recipe a lot. I added chopped mushrooms with the onions, and it was wonderful!! I also reduced the sauce a bit, and even added a touch of flour to thicken. Just wonderful, tender and a nice, new way to make chicken.

I disagree with the comment that the recipe had too much liquid. I cooked it down a bit, as the recipe directions suggested, and felt the amount of sauce was perfect to go with a side dish. I sauteed minced garlic along with the onions, but otherwise thought the recipe was perfect-- very elegant and delicious.

We made this with baked rice, cheese and vegetable casserole, and it tasted good for a mid-week dinner. However, the amount of broth required seemed a little too much, i used barely a half of that, and it tasted just as fine. i would make it again, making sure the chicken is cooked through before i return it to the skillet to sautee with onions.

I made this for Thanksgiving with mashed potatoes and salad. It was amazing - easy, and so succulant! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and it worked really really well. A lot of flavour.

I used Empire chicken with skin and ribs, (not the boneless chicken recommended). It was delicious! I served it with wild rice and honeyed ginger carrots.

It's the right combination of flavors, and the browned skin-on chicken breasts look great in terms of presentation, but it is a little on the bland side. Definitely serve it with a flavorful side dish and some wine to round out the meal. The same ingredients could be used to make a more flavorful baked chicken dish. For variety's sake, I may go ahead and try this again with some variations... I might lightly flour skinless breasts for browning then braising. And, I will probably try adding a little extra something to the sauce.. like more salt, some poultry seasoning, lemon, or anything to give it a little more zing.

Although this recipe was easy to make and the ingredients sounded good, no one in my family of five particularly liked it. I would not make it again.

Delicious! Quick, tasty and healthy. I did leave out the wine because I didn't have any on hand, and also used more like a teaspoon of butter. It went down a treat.

I found this recipe to be delicious and simple to make. My boyfriend enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a relief to see that there are such tasty and low fat recipes available.

Definitely needed something. Was not well received by the children either. Maybe more spices would help.

fairly good, found that it turned out very salty. added lots of pepper for an extra kick.

I used skinless, boneless chicken breast and 2 cups of onions. I also omitted the butter and used cooking spray instead. I thought the recipes was very good and incredibly easy. This recipe will be repeated many times!

What type of chicken (broiler, whole, fryer, breasts, thighs, what?) Was ok, but a bit too greasy using skinless, boneless breasts
