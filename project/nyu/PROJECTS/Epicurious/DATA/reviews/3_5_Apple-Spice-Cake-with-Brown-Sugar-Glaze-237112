Made this in a rush this morning, and it came out beautifully. I had easily a cup+ of left over shredded apples. Next time I won't do the full # of pounds. There's a bit of crunch to the top (then, bottom) of the cake, which adds to its deliciousness.

I've made this twice, both times to bring to a home, post-funeral. It is just right in terms of flavor and sweetness, especially if you slightly "under" measure the sugars in the batter. While I've never been able (or had the patience) to get all the glaze incorporated into the cake, no matter. When you squeeze out the apple juice, be sure to save, as it is very drinkable and natural. No need to add lemon juice to the pulp. It will turn brownish, but is not visible when baked.

Wow, delicious and easy to make. I also added lemon juice to the grated apples to prevent from browning. I made the recipe as directed, and found it to be just right. Next time, however, I will probably add chopped pecans.

This is the most requested cake at holidays in my family. Even my VERY picky grandmother asked for this recipe the first time I made it. We love this cake! If you're lucky enough to have some leftover, have it the next day with your morning coffee. YUMMY!!

This cake is addictively delicious. Brought it to a Halloween party, and it was gone in minutes. I followed everyone's advice and added way more of all the spices (about double). The glaze is a must--don't make the cake without it! I didn't have whipping cream, so I just used milk, and it ended up runnier but still delicious.

This made great "muffins" (I call them that so I can eat them for breakfast. It made ~30, and following other reviewers, I made these modifications: - Subbed out 1/2 c white sugar for ~1/4 c molasses (for extra spice) - Upped the amount of spices overall - Skipped the glaze - Wrung out most but not all of the juice from my apples - Used a variety of apples picked locally - MacIntosh, Gala, MacSpur, Johnees, etc. These freeze great and are always on handfor company!

This cake was not good. It was extremely dry.

Best apple cake I've ever had - and I'm a pretty tough critic. Didn't wring the apples out in the towel -just left them to drain in a colander. Cake came out very moist. Did put some lemon juice on the apples so they wouldn't turn brown. Also added a touch more spices as suggested by the other reviewers. Will definitely make again.

Ditto on the freakn' good! Made this recipe for my Italian inlaws and they all agreed it was a winner. I used winesap apples from our local orchard instead of granny smiths; did not squeeze out the apples but did drain the liquid from the bowl holding the grated apples. Baked for a few minutes longer than instructed...uber rich and delicious. Will absolutely make again.

So freakin' good! I made it just as it said to and it was the best cake I have ever made. I bake a lot and this cake was very simple, so moist and so, so tastey. I am making it again for my husbands bday, at his request, which he has never done. Hope this helps!

Made this last night. It was deliciously moist this morning for breakfast. Spices: I use fresh spices replacing them every six months. Old spices don't have flavor as some of those trying the recipe discovered. Fresh grated nutmeg is the only way to go (use a microplane.) Next time, I will alter how I handle the glaze. I will use half of the glaze as directed drizzled on the warm cake. Then I will cool the remaining glaze and add the drippings off the cake to create a thicker, more showy, glaze. The glaze was like penuche - brown sugar candy. Really yummy. It does need the glaze to moisten so don't leave it out. I used the food processor to grate the apples after discovering I was getting mushy threads from the box grater. I used a clean thin bar towel to squeeze out the apples and used the mixer to mix them in well.

I made this cake using extra spices and twice the amount of apples, as other reviews suggested. I tried it first without icing since I was thinking of using it for a layer cake. It was okay, not that spicy, or apple-y, or even especially moist. When I glazed it, the cake became more flavorful and somewhat moister but nothing extra special. I don't think cake that stays moist for 2 days is especially virtuous. This recipe left me wanting more.

Rating: 4
I give this cake 4 forks because it was delicious, easy to make, kept nicely for several days, and is versatile. I probably used slightly more than the indicated amount for spices but other than that, I followed the recipe closely.

This is an amazing cake! It is a bit of a pain to produce, but well worth it. I've made it again & again.The glaze is not overkill. When u poke the cake, the glaze adds moistness to the interior. I put it on a round cooling rack when i glaze it. I honestly wouldn't change a thing.

I made these in October. I used a paper lined muffin tin and did not enjoy the result. I think baking this in a bundt pan would have been better as the exterior surfaces would have browned and added a better textural element than what was achieved with my muffin pan attempt. It is a sweet and rich cake that was I thought was too heavy for this time of year, the flavor of the apples (that are so delicious in October) did not shine through. I could see myself enjoying this recipe more in the later winter. I may try it again in late January.

This recipe benefited a lot from some reworking: 1. Cut it down to 2 sticks of butter and don't squeeze the moisture out of the apples. You might need 5-10 extra minutes of baking time. 2. Macoun or another sweet-tart apple is a better choice than Granny Smith. 3. Reduce the sugar to 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. 4. Additional lemon juice helps. I used 2 Tbsp. 5. I added ground ginger along with the other spices. 6. Don't let the butter come to room temperature. For the fluffiest cake, the butter should be beaten at no more than 65 degrees. 7. I didn't even try the glaze, b/c it seemed like overkill, but it would probably be good for a real sugar junkie.

Looked just like the picture...sliced just like the picture,but I found it somewhat bland. Happily there are other ones out there that are exceptional. I will say that it's a pretty cake with the glaze.

This is a really well rounded recipe -- not too sweet or buttery if you replace one of the sticks of butter and use more of the apple moisture to keep the cake moist. I used over ripe Fujis instead of Granny Smiths. I also replaced the brown sugar in the glaze with grade B maple syrup. You need to serve this warm! Really, really delicious!

This cake was wonderful! It was moist and not dry at all. I probably had to bake it for 5 - 10 minutes more than the recommended time, just kept inserting a skewer until it came out dry. I also added about a cup of chopped walnuts which I mixed with some flour (so they do not sink to the bottom of the cake). I also added a little extra of each of the spices mentioned. Overall, it was great and everyone at the brunch I made it for loved it. Would definitely make again! Yummy!

One of the best apple cakes I have made! Very moist, and really does NOT need the glaze. If one prefers to ice this one, you might cut back on the sugar a bit. I will certainly make this again...like this week!!

This cake travels well and stays moist. Personally, I loved the brown sugar glaze and would use it again. I used five apples, but thought another wouldn't hurt the cause.

I love spice cake and this is going to be a favortie of mine. The lemon and granny smith apples add a piquant flavor. The glaze in lieu of a cream frosting is a nice change. I'm making this tonight to bring for Thanksgiving and I'm sure that it will be a hit!

I have made this cake twice.Turned out perfectly each time. My husband says it is the best cake I have ever made!! Don't know about that, but it is a compliment. Great with a little whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It will last, wrapped in aluminium at room temp for several days. Glaze needs to sit for a few minutes before using so it thickens up a bit.

My husband and I love this cake. Although, I wish the recipe would have been more specific about the number of apples to use. I used 4 granny smith apples (about 2 lbs) which after grating and squeezing was about 1 1/4 cup. So I added a 1/2 cup of applesauce. Very nice flavor and texture.

I have made this cake many times. It is always moist and delicious. What I have found, however, is that it really needs to "rest" for a day for the flavor to fully develop. Maybe that is why some reviewers did not like it???

I've made this three times, each to rave reviews. As noted by others, "grating" apples doesn't work, but the food processor does. Followed the rest as directed and it's just delicious. Moist means you don't need ice cream!

Response to another comment - I agree on weights for apples. Would be better to have amounts in "cups grated" or the like. Anyways, I used 3 good sized apples for a single cake and it was probably a little much, but turned out fantastic still.

Rating: 4
I had lots of apples so I made a double batch with the intent to freeze one cake, but the double batter was a lot for my Pro K- Aid mixer to handle. Next time will make single cake. The cake was delicate - due mostly to the moistness. The first cake didn't come out of the pan well. I left the other in the oven longer and didn't have that problem as much. Ditto the comments to add 10 minutes to the baking time. My three year old proclaimed this, "dee- licious!" I agree!

Rating: 3
Everyone enjoyed this cake. I added some extra spice, as we prefer it that way. Next time I would reduce the glaze mixture, as the cake was a bit too moist for my taste (and I love moist cake!). Also, the glaze adds a touch too much sweetness that the cake doesn't really need. Over all, a nice recipe and a cake that is great for giving as a gift, or taking to a dinner.

Delicious. By the way, cook from Ontario, neither butter nor eggs is hydrogenated. Margarine is hydrogenated; butter is not, and eggs definitely are not.

I made the cake for Rosh Hashana since it incorporates the apples celebrated in the holiday. It was a HUGE success. I chopped apples because I couldn't figure out how to grate them without turning them to mush. I did have to bake about 6 minutes longer. It was the best smelling item cooking in the house that afternoon. The recipe is now safely filed in my recipe box.

Okay.Here's my comment.The cake looks like it will be very good.Havent tried it, but read well the ingredients etc.The lady, who who stuck her nose up, well,perhaps she did somethying different.99% against 1% is a pretty good average.There is one thing I would suggest, as I am a patissiere,having studied with some of the best in France.When adding the flour/baking powder sifted mixture, It should be done LAST, and folded in rather than mixed.You will ALWAYS have a good light cake this way.I am going to try it soon.Then will comment further,and give the forks.If I like it will make it again.

This cake sounds delicious, but when I see all that butter and then 3 eggs, my heart skips a beat. Yes, it's supposed to serve 12 but at my house we'd eat it all. I'd love to see substitutions for those hydrogenated parts.

Not a rating but a question: Why do recipes call for weight measures of fruit and veg instead of a measure of the prepared ingredient, in this case: X cups grated granny smith apples? If you have the fruit on hand and no scale you must guess and that may be why recipes do not turn out as anticipated???

Looked and smelled wonderful, but, no forks for this one...huge disappointment...wound up throwing it down the garbage disposal. It is not a moist cake, it is a WET cake. I am an accomplished baker with a great reputation, it was the recipe not me or my oven.I do have a reputation of being very discerning when it comes to rating recipes and restaurants. Sorry guys, but there are much better apple spice cakes out there. I have several. The glaze looked terrific the night that I made it. However, by the next afternoon I could see that it had changed and I knew without cutting otwhat the consistency of the cake would be. I was right. Also it lacked flavor

I have to agree with the reviewer from Ohio. The apple flavor didn't come through despite my having grated 4 Granny Smith apples and cutting back on the white sugar as recommended. This is a dense cake. It was good, but not special.

This cake was delicious; it reminded me of the zucchini bread my grandmother used to make for us, and I wonder if I could use this recipe with zucchini. I loved grating the apples! The only problem I have is with the shear amount of butter! Oy! But sooo yummy. I wonder if anyone's tried substituting yoghurt or applesauce for 1/3 of the butter? It gives it such a lovely crust, especially in combination with the awesome glaze, but I would have a hard time justifying the calories more than once in a blue moon. Still, if you happen to be skinny...

So very tasty. Cut granulated sugar to 1 cup with no bad effects. After reading the reviews, I decided I wanted to punch up the apple flavor, so I put in 4 finely chopped apples instead of the 2 cups grated. Apple flavor was very prominent, and the cake was still wonderfully moist. It smells great the next day, too -- not just when you're taking it out of the oven!

Rating: 4
Excellent cake - just like other reviewers said, very moist and very flavorful. I took the advice of another reviewer and did not peel the apples, only cored them and put them in my food processor and used the grating blade. They're right - you can't tell the peel was left on in the final product so I will do that again. Also, listen to people who say they have you prepare too many apples; it's true. You only need about 4 medium apples for the 2 cups worth. I am thinking of trying this recipe with toasted walnuts next time. Do make this though - you will enjoy it!

I saved a step and didn't bother to peel the apples. It added more fiber and the peels "dissolved" as the cake baked, so you didn't even know they were there. I also added about 1 cup of rum soaked raisins, which I plumped up by microwaving them with the rum for about 30 seconds.

I've made this cake twice already and both times has been a hit with two different crowds. It is perfectly moist. I added a bit more cinnamon and allspice the second time for added spicenss - pefect.

This recipe was sort of a pain to put together, or maybe I just didn't allow for enough time to enjoy making it. I had pretty much written off ever making it again by the time I put it in the oven, but it tastes SO good, it's back on the "make it again" list. Next time, I'll allow more time to prepare it or make it the night before or something.

Definiely a VERY tasty cake, moist and fragrant, with the glaze as the crowning touch!! YUMMY!! But my husband has some concern... With 1 3/4 cups of butter and 2 1/2 cups of sugar (and not counting in the whipping cream and numerous grated apples) for 12 slices, what is the nutritional breakdown for ONE SLICE?

Rating: 3
I used my apple wedger/corer to core and slice the apples (4 medium granny), then threw them in the food processor with the grater disc. That was the most difficult part of the recipe, overall it was really fast and easy to make. I cannot recall anything else I've ever baked that smelled this heavenly in the oven. I brought it to work the next day for our coffee social and had to resist its wonderful aroma in my office until late afternoon. It was devoured quickly to great reviews. Next time I will make extra glaze since I'm a sugar-holic and the glaze was fabulous.

Wonderful! i was planning on making this cake as a sort of "birthday cake" when i went into labor with my first child... but as i'm writing this review and still hugely pregnant, i obviously couldn't wait. This cake was fragrant and moist from the time it came out of the oven until the last crumb was devoured 5 days later. The glaze really adds a beautiful caramelly compliment to the delicate bite of the cake. Its going on the list of easy baking favorites. Though i may try to add more apple next time, and perhaps have some chunkier bits, for variety.

This was a hit with my friends. The cake was moist and all the spices mixed well, with just a hint of apple. The glaze recipe made quite a bit, so I used a small skewer to poke holes and let the glaze drip deep into the cake. In addition, I gave the pan a good spray of cooking oil, so I did not experience the cake sticking to the pan as another reviewer noted.

Absolutely delicious! I halved this recipe, baked it in a loaf pan and didn't glaze it, as I was looking for something quick to make with ingredients I had at hand, and I had no whipping cream and not enough apples for the full bundt.

This was a big hit at my brunch. I used 6 apples (3 granny smith and 3 stayman) which came out to about 2.5 to 3 cups of grated apple after the juice was squeezed out. It had to cook for about 1 hr 20 minutes instead of 1 hr. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. It was apple-y and sweet but not too sweet. (I'm sure you could cut out a little sugar but I don't think it's necessary.) Excellent leftover.

With all of that butter, it just had to be good and it was. The glaze is great, but as others said, the cake is very sweet, so one may want to use less sugar or less glaze.

I had misgivings about this cake because of the batter...it's VERY thick. Almost like a cookie dough. But it turned out very well. Moist, just the right spice, and the glaze really makes it.

I also agree with the other reviewer who commented that 4 medium sized granny smith apples is the perfect amount.

From reading the recipe I gathered that this was a pretty basic cake - nothing special. I was still disappointed though. I used good, tart Granny Smith apples but my cake did not have much apple flavor. It tasted ok but more like a spice cake than an apple cake. There are better bundt cakes!

Rating: 3
This cake turned out very tasty and moist. The glaze made the whole flavor complete! The only criticism is the amount of apple that the recipe calls for - it states you need 1 3/4 lbs of apples, but that turns out to be way too much. I'd say 4 medium to large granny smith apples are sufficient. Also, it only calls for 2 cups of the grated apple for the batter, but I think that it didn't have quite enough apple flavor with just two cups. Next time I'd peel, core and grate the 4 medium to large apples and add all of it, which would be the equivalent to about 3 - 3 1/2 cups of apples.
