This dip is colorful, fresh and delicious. People don't have to know that it is also very healthy. Served with crackers, it is a nice alternative to chips and salsa. It is also great as part of a sandwich wrap.

Absolutely delicious with the preparation tips! Great party food for everyone on my list. It covers the vegetarians, the carb counters (serve veggie sticks with it, too), the Heart-smart, and the just plain picky!

I cook a lot and cater too, and I think this is a PERFECT recipe! It is fresh-tasting and flavorful and very healthy. I get tons of compliments on it. Use these tips, though: Use greek-style yogurt (or strain plain yogurt through 3 coffee filters overnight)because it's thicker. I chop my cooked eggplant and before I put it in the bowl, I put it in a cloth and gently squeeze it to remove excess liquid. The flavor and texture will then be much better. Also, don't skimp on the salt and pepper. This dish is even better the next day, served as a dip with whole wheat pita chips.

It sounded so good that I decided to try it in spite of the disappointing reviews, but it was bland.

Cut back on the acidic liquids but add the zest of one lemon.

Too bad I wasted three gorgeous (organic!) eggplants on this recipe. Did someone actually test this recipe??? The flavor was too acidic--the wine vinegar and lemon dominated the eggplant rather than complementing it. I wouldn't make this one again.

I would only make this again if I had lots of eggplant that I couldn't figure out how to use. It was OK, but far more effort to make than it was worth.

I read the conflicting reviews & thought it was worth a try. The smokey flavor is a definite plus. I omitted the yogurt and just mixed the ingredients, skipping the blender altogether as I was cutting it down by about half (and I'm lazy!). Looked nice on a bed of salad leaves.

This recipe tasted terrible and it looked awful.

This was a great appetizer. I would probably not use as much red wine vinegar because it made it a little too sharp. I would definately make this again.

This dish is excedingly tasty & very similar to a dish my mother brought to the US from europe.
