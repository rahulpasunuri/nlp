Absolutely awesome! I added a little milk to make it creamy and instead of potato crisps I used french fried onions. I served this with salmon - a real winner and great if you have company or guests.

Made with steak to use up a small batch of potatoes from the CSA. Added chicken stock to the puree instead and topped with crunchy onions instead of potato crisps. Received compliments of it's different and I like it. Will make again.

This was ok, but there are probably a million more satisfying ways to prepare potatoes!

Lima

This was a very good and interesting vegetable. It is difficult if you don't have a food mill, but I used a ricer for the potatoes and a quisenart for the garlic and lima beans. Everyone enjoyed the different flavor and light green color. Our friend served this with a delicious halibut and spinach.

I love limas and the whole family thought this was delicious and unusual.I boiled the potatoes and limas with some thyme sprigs and used roasted and fresh garlic and about a quarter cup of fresh parsley when I processed this dish. Served it with braised carrots and sauteed spinach. Leftovers reheat well or are good cold as a dip for vegetables. I plan to add it to the Thanksgiving menu.

This was a risky but very successful way to get my kids to eat lima beans! (I didn't tell them until later what was in it...) The adults loved it too. Interesting greenish tinge made it fun to eat. The bean flavor is subtle enough to appeal to lima-lovers and non-lima lovers alike. Easy, good, hearty winter side dish.

This recipe is very good. I served it with roasted pork chops. The next time I make it though, I would roast the garlic and use half and half when wipping.
