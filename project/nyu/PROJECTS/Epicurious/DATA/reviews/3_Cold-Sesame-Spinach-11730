Served the spinach as a side dish to a lightly fried fresh spotted brown trout fillets and baked potato cubes mixed with fresh basil and lime juice. great combination.

oshitashi is one of my favorite japanese dishes and this recipe tastes as close, as i've ever been able to make, to what i crave at the sushi bar. i'll be making this at least once a week - it's so easy!

I found this recipe to be pretty bland. The sesame oil overwhelmed the flavors of soya and rice vinagar, while not doing anything particularly interesting to the spinach. Perhaps I should have doubled or tripled the sauce.

outstanding! Served with the tataki beef for Asian night.

Good, though not the absolute best cold sesame spinach dish I have ever had. Double the soy sauce and sesame oil and triple the seasoned rice vinegar. If you use regular rice vinegar, be sure to compensate by adding some sugar. Finally, I would add the sesame oil with the rice vinegar, after the spinach is cold, in order to retain maximum sesame oil aroma.

Really really good. Even my family who does not like spinach loved this both times that I made it. I did double the soya,oil and rice vineger. Really good

I did cheat a little by using Greta's Sesame Soy marinade, which has essentially the same ingrediants as the recipe given and then added some sesame seeds (2 teas) I made it with glass noodles with peanut sauce (Jeff Smith) and skinned, boned chicken breast marinated in the same marinade...a wonderful combination...I will definately make again, and again...and again
