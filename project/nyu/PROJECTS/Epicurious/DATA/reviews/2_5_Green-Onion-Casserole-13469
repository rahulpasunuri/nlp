Despite a few negative reviews, I thought I'd love this. I'm a fiend for green onions. Alas, this was dry, bland, and a waste of so many green onions, plus the cream. I even added extra cheese as some people advised, plus seasoned generously. Tasteless. I felt like I was just a eating soft mush of onions with a layer of grit. My husband tried soldiering through, but this dish is a true head-scratcher. The recipe looks good, but the result is bland as can be.

This dish is unusual and unexpected. I make it every year at Christmas. I suggest using a little more parmesean and moisten the breadcrumbs slightly with olive oil as they can be a little dry. Just delicious.

I am a big fan of green onions but this dish just didn't deliver. However, I did make the Chicken with Olives and Soy that was recommended by a fellow reviewer and it was delicious.

Substituted small head of cabbage and 2 bunches of green onion. I also used gruyere instead of parmeseano. DELICIOUS! Thanks Epcurious!

This is an unusual dish, one I will make again. I served it to a large group of French and English people and they loved it, especially one French man who ate 4 helpings! The next day, I mixed some of the leftovers with diced potatoes and eggs and had a second feast.

A real surprise! Wonderfully flavorful. Thanks to the comments/experience of those who have gone before me :) I decided to double the cheese . . . yummMEE. I served this along with the "Chicken Roasted with Onions and Soy Sauce" from this site, and with pasta tossed in a bit of peanut oil. "Fantastic!" exclaimed my guests. I pass their compliments and thanks on to you for this unusual and pleasing recipe.

I found this dish on the internet, made it for my family reunion. It really seemed to go over pretty well. Several folks asked me for the recipe. I am planning to make it again, someday, soon. Oh, yes, I forgot, I subsited parmasian chesse for cheddar cheese.

What a disappointment! In a family of onion lovers, not one of us enjoyed this recipe. Needs more cheese, less bread crumbs. Not terrible, but not worth making again.

Really delicious recipe. I added more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for. I don't agree that it makes eight servings, though (I think it's less). I think I may try this with spinach, or add red onions. You could probably do this with any type of greens.

I have been making this casserole since it appeared in Gourmet 5 years ago! Although it's good as it is, I have altered it slightly through the years. My family and friends seem to like it when I use 6-8 cups of scallions, 4 cups of chopped celery which gives it a crunch, and 2-4 cups of chopped leek. I liked the Monterey reviewer's suggestion of adding extra Parmesan cheese as well- the cheese makes a slightly bland dish delicious! I make the casserole a day ahead, and then bring it to room temperature before baking it in the oven. Very often friends ask for the recipe.

This accompanies any kind of meal. I made it with teriyaki turkey burgers and corn on the cob. It has a phenomonal taste....thanks so much! Definitely added to my recipe box.

I was looking so forward to making this recipe with a traditional turkey dinner because it was unique and no one loves onions more than my family! In addition, it had received such wonderful reviews! Such a dissapointment that it was dry, bland, and not even worthy of the other dishes on the table. I re-read the recipe the next day to make sure I had followed it correctly. For those that enjoyed it, please convince me why, because I thought it was a waste of time and eight bunches of scallions!

I would have never guessed that green onions could taste so good. This was delicious. Everyone loved it at our Christmas dinner.

This is delicious! Everyone raved. I used about twice the amount of grated Parmesan. I prepared it in the morning, refrigerated it, and baked it before serving. Marvelous at dinner, and good as a cold leftover the next day.
