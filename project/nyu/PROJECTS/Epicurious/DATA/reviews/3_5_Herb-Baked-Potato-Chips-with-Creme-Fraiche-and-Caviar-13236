This combination of flavors is FABULOUS and perfect with champagne. Don't be a purist. Save yourself the trouble of making the potato chips and just buy one of the gourmet brands off the shelf at the market. This assembles quickly and is elegant! This is going to be a staple on our buffet every NYE!

i cooked the potatos as instructed, and had to throw them out-- too soggy. used parchment paper the second go round without oil, and then turned the potatos over. it took longer, but they were definitely more like a chip. if i were to do this again using russet potatos, then i would cut the potato and soak in water over night to get rid of the stark and hopefully the potatos would be more crispy. not a huge success.

excellent! skip the salt if using caviar, I didn't have russet potatoes, so used yukon gold-delicious! Do recommend a higher quality caviar-mine wasn't the best and it really would make a difference to enhance the flavor of the dish. Best of all, you can scale the recipe to the exact amount you wish to serve-no waste! My husband raved and told me this was a keeper!

Loved these chips! Creative, delicious and easy. Two words of caution; first, I used a "Misto" to spray olive oil on the potatoes instead of a pastry brush. It was too much oil and made the chips soggy. Also,I used an inexpensive caviar so salting the chips made them too salty. If you use grocery store caviar, don't salt the chips.

Very tasty, but gets stale after a couple of hours. I have a few suggestions: Don't salt the potato slices, as caviar is pretty salty. Drain the chips on paper towels, or they get too oily. Remember not to use a metal spoon with the caviar, or it will oxidize (use plastic).

I have tried this with Idaho instead of Russets. Idahos have less sugar and make a much better chip.
