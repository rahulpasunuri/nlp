A delicious and elegant cake but not for the novice baker. I read the reviews, made it and failed, threw it out and immediately tried again using a different method (from Cook's Illustrated) with success. I too, had a lovely light batter the first go-round that was deflated by the butter. For the second attempt, I separated the eggs, then beat the yolks with most of the sugar to ribbons. I then beat the whites to stiff but not dry peaks with the rest of the sugar. I added the vanilla to the melted butter. I folded the whites into the yolks; then sprinkled the flour mixture on and folded, then took a cup of batter out and folded into the butter. I then made a pocket to the side of the big bowl of batter, poured in the butter mixture, and folded gently. The cakes turned out perfectly.

I read the reviews while my cake was in the oven, and I got totally nervous. Happily, I didn't read them before because I MAY have decided to forego this INCREDIBLE cake. Maybe people want their teeth to rot from sugar or maybe they didn't learn simple techniques like folding into poofy eggs, but this cake was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It held its texture and shape when slathered with juicy strawberries and it was delicious. My guests raved about my cake-baking skills, and all I can say is that it was the best cake I've made in my life.

TOTALLLLLLY true re: the "cake" part. What a waste of 9 eggs. Lovely custard, icing & strawbs. terrible cake! mine turned out like a little puck, no life, no height, dense as anything. Eeeyou! Threw it out. Got a box. Saved the delicious custard, icing & strawbs. Wished I'd read reviews first. yes, epicurious, take. it. down!

I made this cake last week with the overabundance of strawberries and lemons this time of the year. It was fabulous! The recipe assumes that one knows how to make a genoise-type sponge cake. So, the folding technique is really important to ensure proper mixing of all the ingredients without overly deflating the fluffiness of the egg mixture. The only change that I would make to this recipe is to ensure that one also brushes the final cake layer with the strawberry juice. Otherwise, the top layer will be dry and stiff because of the type of cake used. Otherwise, a delicious cake.

I really didn't want to rate this cake with one fork because I didn't want to give it any forks, I made this cake last week, what a disaster. I followed the recipe. I think the problem came in with the folding of the flour into the eggs. Every time I folded the flour into the egg there was flour still there. When I got all the flour into the egg mixture there was still flour, I couldn't get rid of the flour. When the cake came out of the oven I trashed it, what a waste of 9 eggs. The cake was uneatable. I should have read all the reviews first.

This got rave reviews when I made it for a friend's birthday. I read the reviews and used a very reliable yellow cake recipe instead of this one. And, since I made it in January, I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh. I can't wait to try it in the summer when we can get fresh local berries! I searched in vain for 3 days for whipped cream stabilizer and ended up using 1 1/2 tsp gelatin dissolved in 2 tbsp water to stabilize the frosting.

Read all the reviews and bought a box cake. Added the zest of 1 lemon to the cream and used a stabilizer for the whipped cream topping

Great cake, read other reviews and bought a box cake. Also added the lemon zest from 1 lemon to the cream. And added a package of stabilizer to the whipped cream.

I have had mixed luck with this recipe but it has always been a huge hit when I make it. I found the tips to warm the eggs and sugar and to incorporate some batter into the butter mixture before folding really helpful. Also be sure you whip the eggs for 9-10 minutes until they are pale yellow to make sure there is enough air in the batter.

Rating: 4
Delicious cake - I listened to the reviews and didn't attempt the yellow cake and used box cake and it still tasted great. Make sure to leave yourself plenty of time to make this cake as it requires 4 hours for soaking the strawberries. My 4 year old daughter keeps asking me to make this cake again.

After reading the earlier reviews, I made a box mix (French vanilla) but kept to the rest of the recipe (except I used more strawberries). It was a big hit for my mother's 95th birthday - in fact, now all my family members say they want it as their birthday cake. Everybody had two pieces!! This one is a keeper for me.

The first time I made this cake--years ago--it came out great! Now, I'm having the same trouble as others...fluffy top and rubbery bottom. I realized that when I folded in the butter all the air was being released. In fact, when I was putting the cake pans in the oven it sounded like rice krispies in milk! Remembered that years ago, I had FORGOTTEN the butter. Left it out on the next try and the cake was okay. Texture was crumbly, not so fine, but okay. Will try combining the butter & vanilla and then mixing with a small amt of batter before incorporating. BTW, my cookbook notes that when making a foam cake (as this is basically) not to incorporate fat after beating the eggs because--ta da!-- the structure will be compromised. Hope this helps others.

Have made this dessert a couple of times with no problems and actually highly recommend it. Local strawberries really make the difference.

WARNING: Don't make the "cake" in this cake recipe. Substitute some other cake. Epicurious should take this recipe down. Something is wrong with it. I didn't listen to the previous bakers, thinking that I could make any cake work! I WAS WRONG....

This cake was very good, but very messy when eating it. The cakes came out good from what I thought. I made it with home grown strawberries which also gives it that extra touch!

I got this recipe out of the Gourmet cookbook, and thus I didn't have the benefit of the reviews. I'm SO RELIEVED to read that others have had problems with this cake. Each cake turned out in two layers -- one like tough cardboard and the other like fluff. The cake itself is so eggy it smells like scrambled eggs. I thought that the strawberries would soften the cardboard, so I went ahead and served it. What a mistake! I've made other genoise cakes with great success. This recipe, as it's written, is seriously flawed. DON'T make this cake as written!

I too had trouble with the cake and I am a professional baker. It was indeed rubbery and I read it through and followed it precisely. I used a cake recipe from my files. Using the strawberry filling and custard, the cake was wonderful.

Yummy yummy yummy. I made this cake for my son's birthday (he picked the flavor, I found the cake recipe). I too used a boxed yellow cake mix; otherwise I followed the recipe toa "T". It was only because I didn't follow the recipe completely that I rated it a 3 and not a 4. It was fantastic! I will probably try the cake part of the recipe next time. I am a pretty good baker, but was nervous about a mishap for a birthday. For just us, though, a failure isn't such a big deal- and it might just be a raving sucess!. Definately try this recipe, in whole or at least in part. It was GREAT!!!

I definitely learned my lesson with this one. I should have read all the reviews before attempting to make this cake. Just like everyone else, my cake was rubbery, and uneatable. I was embarassed serving it to my friends.

It's annoying to read reviews about how absolutely terrible a recipe is when it's more than likely the maker's fault and not the recipe's fault. There are enough positive reviews for this recipe to prove that it's not the recipe that's so terrible (particularly impressive was the review by the two college girls in Madison, WI with only one 9" cake pan to their name -- and their cakes still came out great). The tip about folding a little of the cake batter into the butter/vanilla mixture and then folding that mixture into the rest of the cake batter is a good one.

After reading the earlier reviews I decided not to use the cake recipe, but instead use a sponge cake recipe that I have and have used in the past. The cake turned out great and everyone loved it.

This is an outstanding combination of flavors and textures in a cake. I made for a wedding shower and have never had so many compliments or requests for a dessert recipe. However (and it's a big however), I wish I'd read the reader comments first. The cake itself was a disaster--rubbery just as so many others experienced. I saved the whole recipe at the last minute by dumping the cake and making a vanilla cake. So, I really recommend this recipe, but if you're not an accomplished baker, just try it with your favorite vanilla cake recipe and do everything else the same (custard, berries, whipped cream).

not reviewing this recipe, just want to try to help. Rubbery genoise, which is what this cake is like, usually results from not incoporating the butter enough. A good trick is to put the melted butter and vanilla in a bowl and pour about about 1 cup of batter in the bowl with the butter/vanilla. stir in very well, it will deflate but that is ok. Fold this mixture into the rest of the cake batter. It really helps incorporate the butter much better. Hope this help everyone.

I have a suggestion to improve the cake's texture. Warm the eggs/sugar before beating them. Mix them briefly, then set the mixer bowl over a bain marie. You just need to get the eggs barely warm. The ingredients here are similar to a genoise cake, and the warm egg technique is always in a genoise recipe. (Warm eggs trap more air, which will lighten the texture.)

I read many of the reviews and paid particular attention to carefully folding in the dry ingredients and the melted butter. The cake didn't rise and was rubbery and went in the trash. The custard and the rest of the recipe was very good although I used with another cake recipe. I'm not a novice either --disappointing!

Well I too, thought I could overcome this recipe but alas I ended up with the rubbery cake disaster as well. I then took another reviewer's suggestion and made the lemon buttermilk cake recipe but continued with the same custard and strawberry filling. It came out great! The only thing I would have changed now would be to add a vanilla bean to the custard while cooking. It was a bit bland for me. ( I didn't use the swedish liquor). I think the problem is the butter is too heavy for the fluffy batter and no matter how you fold it in it still sinks to the bottom causing the cake to be rubbery.

I got the recipe from the magazine, but would have benefited from the reviews. The first time I made the cakes, they also came out flat & rubbery. I already had the pastry cream & strawberries all set, so I had to try again. The second time the cakes came out great, and everyone enjoyed it.

I made this cake twice. The first time I made it, it was delicious. The second time I made it, the cake was like a rubbery disk. I think I know why this happened. The second time I made it, when I was pouring the batter in to the cake pan, I noticed that I had not completely folded in the butter. i.e I saw the butter floating on the top. My guess is that I didn't mix carefully and that the butter sank to the bottom and made a rubbery cake. I know that the recipe works though, so if you fail once do not hesitate to try it again!

This cake tasted very strange. I followed the recipe and ended up with an oily hard type of cake. I dont recommend making this, but if u do..make sure u put less sugar then it tells u to for the cake layers and some extra vanilla flavor for the custard.

This cake is absolutely disgusting. It baked it for valentines day and it almost ruined my day! It tasted like a sweet omelet and was greenishly eggy. I followed all the instructions completely but this cake just turned out very badly. Many of my friends commented that it was very hard to bite and slightly rubbery! Dont make or eat this cake if it was the last morsel of food on earth!

The sponge cakes are as light as air and not too sweet. The strawberry filling was great (you have to use berries from the farmer's market and not those tasteless rocks they sell at the supermarket). And using the whipped cream as the frosting really accented the freshness of the strawberries and didn't overwhelm the delicateness of the sponge layers. The only drawback to this cake is that it is very time consuming--I only made this because I had a whole day to spare! I also want to add that if you want to try a simpler cake recipe with a strawberry filling, make the Lemon Buttermilk Cake with Strawberries. What is great about it, is that it calls for frozen strawberries so you can make it any time of the year. But, be sure to read the helpful hints that were posted by everybody before you bake.

This cake was a lot of work and a lot of clean up. It is a glorified strawberry shortcake. The custard is far too eggy. The strawberries are fab...but the rest is not worth the effort and time.

This recipe was difficult to understand with important details being left out and preparation time was very consuming. With all my effort this cake ended up tasting fair at best, the cake turned out rubbery ( and I did cook this correctly ), and overall it was a waste of time. Very disappointing especially since I made it to take to a friends B-Day....... :(

I finally got to make my own birthday cake! I am not an experienced baker, especially when taking in account the high altitude, so I cheated and bought a yellow box cake. The strawberries were delicious, but they yielded a cup of liquid which I felt was way to much to drizzle over the two cakes. The custard was good, but if you omit the Punsch, make sure you add sugar because it was rather egg-y tasting. Of course the wipped cream icing was fabulous. I let the cake sit for about 14 hours before cutting. It was still a little messy but got rave reviews. I would happily make this cake again, and not feel bad about cheating and using my friend Duncan Hines either!

absolutely ambrosial!I dont have any complaints of rubbery cake or gooey custard .Its important to have a light hand with the cake and to refridgerate it overnight to set up .I make it at least every strawberry season when they are sweetest and juiciest.Always makes em swoon!

I made this recipe with extreme attention to detail and the genoise still turned out rubbery on the bottom. i would make it again but next time i would just make a regular yellow or white cake instead of wasting 9 eggs. the custard was very good and i have since used it in other recipes. i liked the "idea" of this cake but the actual cake was more hassle than it was worth.

The first time I made it, it became our favorite dessert! I can no longer remember how I made it through summer without making and enjoying it. And though it may seem complicated, if the instructions are followed carefully, with a bit of patience it will come out perfect! I had a complete success on the first try.

My roommate and I made this cake for my birthday. We are both only college student (major: nowhere near culinary art) but we took extra caution on mixing the batter and carefuly assemble the cake. The result: moist, airy cake with delicious custard filling and fresh strawberry layer!! (We had to agree that the strawberry filling falling apart when you cut it fresh, but not after you refrigerate it) We didn't even have 2 9-inch pans and have to wait until the first cake baked and washed it out, but still the result was nothing rubbery. We use ordinary hand-held mixer and limited amount of bowls and kitchen utensils(as many other college students). So, don't get discouraged by your first trial!

I also had trouble with this recipe. I made the big mistake of using 9 extra large eggs instead of large eggs. After I threw the first set of rubbery cake in the trash, I was successful in making a wonderful moist cake. It was a huge hit at the office. Not too rich. It would be easy to do a second time around. I highly recommend it.

From reading the recipe, I recognized that this is a genoise cake, because you are sifting flour and butter intermittently into the cake batter. This is not a cake for people who are novice or once in a while bakers; you've got to know what you're doing or you'll experience what several of the readers did--instead of a light, buttery cake, it will turn rubbery and tough if you don't fold and blend in the ingredients correctly. If you are an experienced baker, this cake will work for you. It was good, but not out of the ordinary.

We made this cake for our Easter dinner and birthday celebration. It was terrible. I agree that the cake was like a spongy frisbee. The layers with the strawberrries fell apart and did not make for an attractive presentation. All in all not worth the effort or the use of that many eggs!

I tried to make this cake twice and after 18 eggs I gave up. Obviously my technique was wrong-the layers came out rubbery-like frisbees. Would appreciate any advice!

I made this cake with some short cuts this past weekend. I used a cake mix instead, substituting whole eggs instead of egg whites, milk instead of water, but it still turned out wonderful. We had 10 people around the table and not a piece was left over.
