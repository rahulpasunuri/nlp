This one didn't work for me. I did follow the instructions, until midway when I smelled a distinct burning smell and turned down the oven temperature a bit. The flavor was good, if you didn't mind the crunchiness of the rice. More liquid maybe? Or precook the rice a bit? Lower temp, longer time? I may try it again, with one or more of these changes.

Of the several dozen recipes I have tried from Epicurious, this is the only disappointment. Rice was hard after all that time. Also, watch the almonds closely as they burn easily and quickly at this temperature.

My roommate calls this my magic rice. I add steamed broccolli, and crumbled feta. It never ceases to be a hit.

Great basic wild rice recipe. My family loved it and it was extremely easy.

I made this recipe with one modification. I toasted pine nuts to put in with the ingredients. This recipe was a hit and there were NO leftovers!!

Easy and tasty recipe. Should be served the day you make it - otherwise it loses its taste.

This dish is very plain but sometimes that is key if you're serving a very flavourful main dish or meat with a sauce. I didn't have a big enough baking dish so added some broth, let the rice absorb it, and added the rest as is cooked. It worked well. The recipe also works with regular long grain rice if you don't have wild rice on hand.

FINALLY! I found my favourite recipe for wild rice! The rice does tend to be a little crunchy but that adds to the overall texture of such a delicious dish! I love the nutty flavour of the rice!!!! Importantly enough, this is one the entire family likes.

I loved the flavor of this dish. Mine also turned out a little crunchy around the edges, though. I wonder if a little extra liquid would help.

This is a variation of a family favorite. I cover 1 Cup wild rice w/water. Bring to boil. Drain water. Repeat 2 more times. This washes the rice. Then put remaining ingredients in covered baking dish. Bake 1 hour at 350. Being conscious of fat, I would cut down the butter.

The rice had a good flavor but I thought it would never get done. It took forever and still was crunchy. I should have started it much sooner.

I think the temperature might be a typo! I checked the rice with 30 minutes to go and it had begun to burn. I added some liguid, bad idea. The glass dish I was using broke into many pieces. It's hard to rate the recipe as I did not actually taste the end result.

Needed longer cooking time. Great taste, though.
