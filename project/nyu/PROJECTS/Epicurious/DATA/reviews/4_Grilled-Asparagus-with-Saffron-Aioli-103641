This is the most amazing recipe! Its SO simple and just divine. The aioli is tasty on grilled shrimp and other grilled veggie too. I've been making it for over 2 years and its a hit every time. YUM!!!

So super yummy. Try it, you'll make it again and again. I love the fact that I pretty much always have the ingredients on hand.

This was good, but not great. I brought it to an experimental dinner party. There was a lot of aioli left over--I think it was a little too sweet and heavy for the asparagus. Next time I will try half yogurt/half mayo.

Exellent! I used greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise, (cuz it was in my fridge) which may have lost a bit of flavor but it was still fantastic. You can really taste the saffron It went fantastically well with the asparagus.

Fantastic! Everyone loved it,even the kids. My husband, who doesn't care for honey, loved it too. It's so easy and these ingredients are usually on hand. give it a try!

I like to make this aioli a day ahead the color seems to enhance and my dinner guest commented that this was one of the few times where you could actually taste the saffron...so that was great!

Loved this simple Aioli. Delicious. Very easy!

I read the reports where people say the asparagus would be better on its own and I don't understand it! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this and felt it worked well with the grilled chicken I prepared. Plain grilled asparagus needs no recipe and is always delicious - but this is a special treat to mix it up when in the middle of asparagus season! I'd like to pair this witha fish next time...

Forget the asparagus-you could serve the aioli on bread and this would be fabulous- we used the sauce on rotisseried chicken as well as the asparagus and it was all good. Even better since I used garlic from my garden-spicy and good. A definite winner.

Simple, quick and yummy. Everytime I have made this, it disappears quickly. For a fast supper I served this with flank steak (lime juice, garlic and salt rubbed in just before grilling) sliced thinly and crusty sourdough bread. From arrival at home to sit down, 30 minutes tops. PERFECT summer meal.

The grilled asparagus was wonderful. However, I would refer to the Saffron Orange Aioli recipe (featured on this website) to replace this one which uses mayonaise. Make the aioli one day prior to allow the saffron to peak in flavour.

This aioli was cloying and sweet and ruined the taste of the asparagus. There are tons of great recipes for easy homemade aioli, but this isn't one of them.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious dish and one that I will make again (The colors also make a beautiful presentation). The combination of the grilled flavor and the aioli is crisp and complex. Make the aioli the day before and, of course, use good quality saffron. It does yield a lot of aioli, but enjoy the indulgence.

I served this with several other yummy recipes at a buffet and this one went first. It is as great as everyone says it is, (and yes, you will have WAY too much aioli for the asparagus, but it does taste great with many other things). The saffron makes the sauce. I buy it at BJs Wholesale Club for pennies.

Grilled the asparagus on the George Foreman quickly and then drizzled just a little of the sauce on. It is very strong and on its own I didn't like it very much. With the asparagus though it tastes great. Will halve the sauce recipe next time.

It wasn't terrible, but the asparagus would have been better on its own.

Delicious! If you're making it ahead of time, anyway, definitely try it with homemade mayonnaise. It's easy to make in a blender and the flavor is worth it.

Terrific recipe for time-starved cooks! I served this with Chimichurri steaks and balsamic roasted potatoes and it was a huge hit! The aioli can be made a day ahead, and the asparagus grilled with the meat for a quick and elegant dinner.

I made this recipie and it was very good. My husband (and even my 2 year old!) both asked for seconds. Personally, I thought I would cut down the amount of mayonnaise...in other words make the proportion of red wine vinegar and honey more equal to that of the mayo. Also, I had tons of the sauce left...I only had 1.3 lbs of the asparagus (a little less than the recipe calls for)...is the asparagus supposed to be swimming in the sauce? Again, I think if I make the proportions more equal and cut down the amounts used, I might've enjoyed it even more. Will definitely give it another try, though. Anyone have any thoughts on my comments?

This was a very tasty dish. I did grill the asparagus longer than 5 minutes and the end result was truly amazing.

Loved it. Yummy. Fabu(as in fabulous). I'm not a big fan of mayo or sauce on veggies but I really found this tasty. My only problem is getting my husband to understand portioning. We'll have aioli until the cows come home.

This makes all veggies pop not just asparagus! We used it for the asparagus the first night, the next it was with steamed broccoli, the next night was with zucchini...

I made this recipe for my cousin's birthday party (we had a grilled/summer theme) and everyone loved it. I was asked for my recipe several times, even by experienced cooks. The problem with giving out my recipes, however, is that I hardly ever stick to them. We didn't have saffron, so I made the aioli with chives and added an extra handful to the red pepper topping. I also put in sliced portabella mushrooms and red potato wedges (pre-boiled) with the asparagus. The extra veggies gave it some variety and made a delicate dish into a more hearty side. Next time I may add red onions. It was wonderful, paired with steak. Even relatives who dislike garlic and asparagus were impressed. Hard to mess up and it even looks great. The only thing I regret is not making enough to have leftovers!

i made this a couple of times, once for easter brunch, once for a spring buffet. for the spring buffet i served the aioli surrounded by cold blanched asparagus + artichoke hearts as a crudite plate. folks loved it. i did use extra saffron + let the aioli sit for 2 days to let the saffron flavour really come out. i also added *lots* more garlic, using 1 large clove of elephant garlic.

The aioli is absolutely delicious. If you like garlic, this is the sauce for you! I've made the recipe as written once, but I've made the aioli dozens of times and served it with chilled asparagus. I serve it year-round. Everytime, it's a huge hit! The aioli is also great as a sauce for artichokes or broccoli. Use saffron threads--not ground saffron.

Not bad, but I'd sooner have grilled asparagus on its own without the aioli.

I,m not a huge fan of asparagus and I thought this was absolutely divine. It was easy too. I made this for Valentine's Day because my husband did the shopping for our special dinner and he picked the asparagus. Since I'm not a big fan, I decided to look at epicurious to see if I could do something special with them. Will definitely make this again. Will keep in the front of my files to make for company. Would make a rather impressive dish for guests.

I had to broil the asparagus (since it is 14 degrees here), but the aioli was delicious. The recipe made about twice as much as I needed (despite liberal use), so I will safe the remainder and use it again tomorrow.

I have made this recipe several times- always excellent. I cook the asparagus on the George Forman grill. Leftover aioli sauce is nice with poached chicken.

This was a fun dish - everyone loved it. Like others who wrote reviews, I served it with steak, and it was a great combo.

I halved the aioli recipe, but it was still a lot. Thought it just tasted too strongly of mayonaisse, so I thinned it with chicken stock. It was much better after that. Would make it again with that modification. Might be better if you used homemade mayo instead.

Now I understand what all the fuss about saffron is. The flavor of the aioli was truly exceptional, and I was happy to have extra to dress my salad later in the week. I'm amazed by how easy this recipe is; now that I have saffron stocked in my kitchen, I can throw together this sauce for other vegetables in a snap.

I wouldn't rate most vegetable dishes four forks but this one is fabulous! I served it with Flank Steak with Crispy Polenta and the wine suggested in that recipe. It all came together so well. I will also cut down on the aioli as it made too much.

Awesome for a party platter... I doubled the asparagus (2kg) but kept the same ailoi amount. I boiled instead of grilled, and served the platter as finger food hors d'oeuvres but also left it during the buffet dinner. It ALL got eaten by my 35 guests, despite 4 other competing hors d'oeuvres and 2 competing vegetables. I made the aioli 2 days ahead of time, and boiled asparagus 1 day ahead. On the day of the party, I arranged the chilled asparagus in a radial pattern on a circular platter with a bowl of aioli in the middle, and served it as finger food. Instead chopping the red peppper, I served slices with the asparagus for dipping. (Nice red & green combo for Christmas!) Only thing I would do differently would be to make my own mayonnaise instead of using the prepared kind.

The aioli on this was wonderful! We thoroghly enjoyed it. The only thing I did differently is instead of chopping the red onion and serving it at the end I grilled it with the asparagus and then sliced it thin and served with aspagus. It looked beautiful also.

I would also give this 5 forks if I could. We love asparagus anyway, but this recipe just makes you groan it's so wonderful. I did follow my fellow cook's advice, and cut the aioli recipe in half. I can't wait to make it again.

This has been a family favorite for over a year.I always broil the asparagus and use the leftover aioli for boiled shrimp. It is served at all my dinner parties and on holidays!

Although I didn't personally make this, I was served this on the weekend. It was truly wonderful. My good friend Gayle used low-fat mayo which did not seem to deter from the richness of the aioli.

Wonderful!! In the future, I will always grill the asparagus...superior taste. It does make a large amount of aioli; simple to solve...I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount needed.

I'd rate this 5 forks if I could. I'm a big fan of aioli, but this really gives it snap. I didn't have enough gas for the grill, so resorted to the oven to 'grill' the aspargus, with fine results. I'm still figuring out what to do with the leftover aioli (this recipe makes a lot!) If you have a Trader Joe's, do try their brand of mayo. It's unsweetened and far superior to any store brand I've had before. Quite close to homemade taste and texture.
