Love this Beef Pappardelle recipe-so much flavor! I substituted short ribs per an earlier review, used two per serving. The veal demi glace makes it. If you can't find any in your store, use a small jar of veal baby food and add beef broth. With a Dutch oven there is only one pot to clean. A simple and hearty dish, perfect for a cold, winter evening!

Made this in a stovetop/oven proof casserole dish, chopped the vegies by hand, then used a stick blender on the sauce at the end. Greatly reduced the dishes! Served with Rigatoni. Subbed beef stock for veal, and as couldn't find anything labelled 'brisket' in my country, used a very large piece of casserole steak, which I assume was similar. Lovely. However, a LOT of meat compared to the sauce. Might up the sauce quantity next time.

I waas looking for a good way to cook a brisket.....this beats plain brisket anyday! The taste is rich and delicious (used chicken broth like other raters because the grocery store was out of veal demi glace). I minimized the clean up by (1) cutting the vegetables by hand and skipping the food processor and (2) using an immersion blender to finish the sauce. I only ended up using 1 large dutch oven and 1 chopping board. It was a cinch! The only other beef pasta recipe I've made that equals this was from Fine Cooking magazine -- similar except it used short ribs instead of brisket. An excellent fall/winter meal.

Simple recipe that tasted well. As with most braised recipes, it tasted better the next day. Would definitely make again. Substituted chicken stock for the veal stock.

It took all day to prepare this meal, but well worth it. Big clean-up required (food processor, blender, 3 pots, etc.)

We loved this! Used chicken stock instead of veal stock because I had it on hand, it was just fine. I used really good quality pasta so the consistency of the pasta was thick and hearty. Added green peas for color and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese and minced parsley on top. Beautiful presentation and a wonderful meal on a very cold night!

I made this in a triple batch and underestimated the quantity of food involved. Lots of stuff and lots of pots and pans, but the end result was delicious and well received. The key to this dish is to smother it with grated parmesan, they marry well.

I thought this dish was wonderful, very similar to a braised short rib pasta dish I had at an expensive restaurant. A few modifications: I only chopped the vegetables before proceeding with the recipe, cooking on top of the stove instead of in the oven (took the same amount of time). I removed the beef once it was tender and then let some of the liquid cook off. Once it was thicker, I blended the liquid in batches to create a hearty sauce. Pairs perfectly with shaved parmigiano. Better the next day. Husband keeps requesting it.

This pasta is the best I have ever tasted. Everyone licked their plate clean.

This is my favourite dish at Tutti Matti. Here's a little tip when cutting the carrots celery and onions DO NOT put them in the food processor. Keep them as one inch pieces and Saute, just follow the rest of the method and it should turn out great. Just make sure that the sauce seems thick before you process it otherwise it will be runny. The sauce should be nice and thick. If it is made right it should be the best meat you have ever tried. Enjoy.

I didn't love this recipe. In the end, it tasted like my mother's beef stew over pasta. OK-but nothing special and some work to make.

Delicious! The carrots give such a sweetness to the sauce, it's wonderful. Word of advice: fry the beef more than 5 minutes.... once you put it back in to the sauce, it will start to "stick" back on itself. The beef is also the best tasting Italian Beef Hero you have ever tasted!

Made this today---comfort food for the bitter cold weather. While it's fine, it's just that...okay...and not really worth the expense, the work, and the number of dirty pots & other utensils. Won't be making this again.

Made this brisket for Hannukah dinner last nite and it was excellent. Very tender! To the final sauce I added sauteed mushrooms and a little truffle oil. EXCELLENT - will make this again...
