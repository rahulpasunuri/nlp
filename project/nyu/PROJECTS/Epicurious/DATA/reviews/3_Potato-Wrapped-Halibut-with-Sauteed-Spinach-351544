The only minor issue I had with this recipe was getting the potatoes ends to stick together when wrapped around the fish. This was nothing that a few toothpicks couldn't fix though. In a nonstick skillet with just a little bit of oil the potatoes got beautifully browned and crisp. The fish was cooked perfectly inside. This recipe is so good, we are using it as the basis for a cooking party this evening! Highly recommended!

I had no trouble creating thin potato slices (thank you mandoline) and wrapping the fish (thank you starchy potatoes). But I did have problems in the cooking. I was worried about the potato sticking to the pan so I cooked one in a non-stick and another in a regular pan side by side. The non-stick fish did not stick but it was a soggy oily mess, and never crisped up. The regular pan was a disaster- with stuck potato that wrestled itself free from the fish when I flipped it. I ended up eating it as a plain halibut filet. I will try making it again in the nonstick pan with very little oil and higher heat to develop the crust.

This is my favorite fried fish recipe ever. If wrapping isn't working for you, then just arrange the potato on the top and bottom of the fish. That way all the potatoes touch the pan and get crispy. That's the only way I could get it to work with tilapia or snapper, and it tastes great. I go a little heavy on the salt because it tastes so good with the crispy potatoes. I vary the seasonings each time, and have never failed. I've also used my moandolin or just ahnd sliced the potatoes depending on where I am. It all works!

The potato seemed to slip/fall off the halibut. But this tasted fantastic! I will make this again.

I read all the reviews and still tried the recipe. It didn't work for me either. I gave this one fork for preparation but for flavor I would give it three forks. The potatoes didn't stick once I put them in the fry pan. The potatoes that were crisp were great the others were greasy. The halibut was wonderful and I love spinach sauteed with garlic.

This is definitely worth the extra work. I made this last night for dinner. I used mandoline to slice the potatoes to paper thin; and that really makes the difference in maintaining the thickness of the sliced potatoes. I laid out the sliced potatoes to form a rectangle then brushed the potatoes with melted butter and then sprinkled with sea salt and pepper. I then alternately weaved the sliced potatoes to create the pattern, dropped in the pan for two minutes then flipped and finished it in the 425°F oven for 5 minutes. I served it with steamed broccoli and added roasted poblano salsa which gave it a little heat (and a bottle of 2007 Chateau Ste Michelle 2007 Eroica Riesling). It was great!!! )

So, I think, had we had a proper mandolin this would have worked better. You need to make sure to slice the potato PAPER thin in order for it to wrap well around the halibut. Also, be very careful with the type of pan you use and the amount of oil, as the potato can easily stick to the pan and burn/fall off the fish. Regardless, while it didn't look perfect, it tasted DELICIOUS. I recommend salt and peppering the fish before you wrap it in potato. Toothpicks may be helpful to have on hand. Also, we decided to make a quick walnut basil pesto to serve on top and it was a GREAT choice.

Excellent. EXCELLENT!! I've already made it again and it is what we are having for dinner tonight.

We tried this but used too small of potatoes and a halibut steak. These don't work well at all. We couldn't execute the recipe as called for because of this. Needs more flavor. Will try again with Large potatoes and halibut fillet.

Despite tough potato slicing issues, this recipe turned out to be a success. You don't need a mandoline to do it. Just some patience and creativity. And it turns out beautifully and delicious! Read the other posts for help - I did.

as long as you follow the advice here about making sure the potatoes are cut very thin, this looks way harder than it is - i found the potatoes were rather forgiving once you got them in the pan, even if it was having a little trouble staying wrapped on the counter. i didn't have a madeline so i used a wide cheese grater, which was passable if a little difficult to manipulate. and the result is simple and delicious - great for a dinner party.

This was excellent,,,and a nice presentation. I also used the mayonnaise and caper paste from the potato crusted halibut recipe elsewhere on this site. Yummy! Wrapping the fish is a process, but well worth it....

Overall good taste, i ended up trying to caramelize my potatoes so they stick together but it didn't work very well (since i didn't have parchment.) I was although a little confused am i supposed to fry the fish while it's still inside the parchment or what?

This is a bit more "technique-intensive" than most of the recipes featured. I think sometimes Bon Appetit plays that down too much, leading to a lot of high hopes and disappointing results for the average home chef. I can tell you as a classically trained chef with 10 years of experience at a high-end seafood restaurant in NYC, that potato wrapping does require a little practice. Don't give up, keep trying. Oh, and don't soak or rinse your slices!

I personally found it a little challenging to wrap the fish with potatoes but I'm willing to try it again --- maybe slice the potatoes even thinner. I tried it with sweet potatoes too and the sweetness was a very nice compliment to the fish.

The flavor was very good and the dish recieved rave reviews. Wrapping the fish was a little challeging. Used cod fillets. The fish thickness makes a difference - stick to 1/2"-3/4" flat fillets. I found that the thinner fillets came out better and were easier to assemble. The thicker fillets came out cylinder shaped and didn't hold together as well. Very thin potatoes is important as well. Mine took 3 potato slices accross each row. I cut a parchment into squares for each serving and used it to help fold the potatoes around the fish, similar to rolling sushi. The parchment helped hold everyting together until it was ready to cook and made it easier to handle.

I actually got the potatoes to wrap (used 3 across, and kinds squished the fish to be long and narrow). I used a LOT of salt and pepper on the fish and both sides of the potatoes. I thought it tasted great, but prop won't make again as my entire kitchen and my hair smell like french fries ...

Use the mayonnaise and caper paste from the potato crusted halibut recipe elsewhere on this site. It adds a lot of flavor and also makes the potatoes stick to each other and to the fish. I brushed a little on each strip of potatoes as I laid them out and cooked it all in a cast iron skillet. Cooked through in less than the advertised time and also stayed together.

Tried, but had no success with making this. I think my potatoes where cut too thick. They must be paper thin to wrap around the fish.

The key to this recipe is slicing the potatoes as thin as possible. Otherwise they don't cook through and they don't adhere to the fish. I have found that only a good, sharp mandoline can really do the trick. Work quickly and remember that starch is your friend in this dish! The result is amazing when you get it right. The fish is moist and the potatoes are heavenly.

I agree with the previous comments. The potatoes were a nightmare! My husband made it and nearly threw the dish out the window. There's no way it takes only three minutes a side. We followed the recipe exactly and it was horrible. The potatoes weren't cooked through and didn't stick. At first we thought maybe we missed something, but good friends invited us over for dinner a week later and guess what they made for dinner. The same dish, same problem. I'm a big fan of Bon Appetit but think they really missed the boat on this one!

I loved this recipe! I used a very sharp mandoline on its thinnest setting, and I had to use 3 rows of potatoes instead of 2, but the final product was beautiful. Potatoes tasted delicious, and fish was nice and juicy. Be generous with the salt and pepper, as those are the only spices and some previous reviewers said it was bland. I'll definitely file this one under simple but fancy recipes that guests love.

This recipe was remarkable. The store didn't have halibut so I substituted sea bass. I put the first round of potato slices in cold water to keep them from turning brown. This was a mistake. If the potatoes are starchy, the assembly sticks together beautifully. Also, if the skillet is very hot, the assembly stays together and makes a lovely presentation. My husband and I both thought this was superb.

I have made potato crusted fish, albeit not using this method for coating the fish, a number of times and it is delicious. Use cod,halibut,grouper or salmon. Whisk 3 egg yolks together.( You can add up to 2 Tbs of prepared horseradish to yolks if desired or not) Peel and grate 2 large Idaho potatoes. Season four 7 oz fish filets with salt & pepper.Coat each filet with egg mixture. With floured hands,"smush" handfulls of the grated potatoes onto all sides of filet.Dust each filet with white flour on both sides to absorb moisture from potatoes, pressing the potato coating firmly against the filets. Sprinkle salt over each crusted filet. Melt butter in saute pan and brown filets on one side. When brown, flip and transfer pan to 400 degree oven and bake for 15 min. Check to make sure not burning and flip again if necessary. I serve with citrus beurre blanc and spinach. Outstanding.

I agree with everything said. The potatoes did not stick, as suggested, and the meal was bland. Way too much oil for me.

This was a beautiful and yet quite simple dish. I had some minor annoyance with the potatoes, but I used the slicer side of a tower cheese grater. Once I wrapped the fish in the potatoes, I kept them in the parchment until they went in the pan - several minutes sitting seemed to make them adhere better. I squeezed some lemon into the spinach and over the potatoes at the end, and made some of my dill tartar sauce to go alongside.

The picture was so beautiful, I couldn't wait to try it, but in the end, the meal was not great. I sliced my potatoes to 1/16 inch with a mandoline so they were paper-thin. I had to push down very hard to get the potatoes to stick to the fish, then I put a heavy (le creuset) pot lid on each fish/potato packet for 10-15 minutes to help potatoes adhere. That worked fairly well and my packets did not fall apart once in the skillet. I used less oil than suggested, but my fish and spinach both seemed a little greasier than I like (and I'm a huge fan of olive oil, so I was surprised that I felt this way). My husband agreed that it was a decent dinner, but not something either of us wants to do again any time soon, if it all.

Use the mayonnaise paste from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Potato-Crusted-Halibut-Steaks-10043 to both add flavor and stick the potatoes to the fish.

Wow, what a waste of fish! The potatoes absolutely DO NOT stick to the fish and the dish is extremely bland. This is by far the worst recipe experience I've ever had on here!

Potatoes were wonderful but they are really just friend potatoes. it was a nightmare to get them to stick to the fish, and I thought the fish inside was sort of bland. if you attempt this understand that paper thin REALLY means paper thin. if they are thicker they won't stick, and if you've already sliced all your potatoes (you really need a mandoline) then you are in trouble!! Good luck if you try this. if you can make it look like the picture the presentation will be worth the effort.

This is a simple and very good recipe. the big problem is how to get the pototoe to stick to the fish. It looks so easy, but is so hard to do. I found that if I used parchment paper to wrap the potatoe slices and then peeled back the parchment and tied the potatoe with 2 pieces of butcher string on each end about 1in from the ends of the fish, it stayed together wonderfully and was easy to fry. Then a simple snip of the string before serving was all it needed. the nice thing about this recipe is that it is very fast to make, simple and the fish is wonderfully moist.

The combination of yukons, halibut and spinach is really delicious and healthy. However, it was nearly impossible to keep the potatoes from falling apart. They barely stuck before I cooked the fillets, and once they hit the pan, they all fall apart. Definitely slice the potatoes paper thin, or better yet- cook them on the side and then arrange them on the fish to serve.
