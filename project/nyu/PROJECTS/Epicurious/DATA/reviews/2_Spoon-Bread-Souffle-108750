I have now tried this recipe three times with great results. Perfect with turkey and all the fixings. Pretty easy to make and I thought it was much lighter than corn bread, good texture. Every time I make this it disappears and everyone likes it very much.

This is definitely not the spoon bread that I remember from my childhood! This was dense, dry and dull. I remember spoon bread being light and pudding-like. This version is more like a puffy cornbread - not at all what I expected.

sugar would change the texture and make it much more dense than without. Try sprinkling the top with sugar before baking, as that will add sweetness without affecting the temperature.

I was written that this spoon bread is lighter than corn bread. Mine turned out much more dense than the cornbread I usually make. I had to add a tsp of sugar, as I prefer my cornbreads/biscuits slightly sweet. Perhaps my doing so messed up this recipe?
