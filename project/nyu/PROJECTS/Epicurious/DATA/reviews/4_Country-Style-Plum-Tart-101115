This recipe is a summer staple. It does tend to leak however, but as in most baking, the mistakes taste great. I usually serve it with home made whipped cream, and have used plums, apricots, and plucots all with great success. If the leak bothers you, you could strain the fruit before adding it to the crust, using the reserve syrup for glazing.

A very easy and impressive tart. Mine leaked a little too but that didn't bother me. Just made it that more 'rustic' looking. Don't leave out the vanilla and allspice like one reviewer suggested. They make a very subtle but intriguing difference. If you don't have allspice on hand, a tiny shake of nutmeg or cinnamon would be good too.

First time ever I made a pie: the crust was easy to make and really good. It definitely looks more "country" than "gourmet", but really won over my guests. The crust was the star, the filling was good but not stellar. (maybe bc I didnt have vanilla or all spice on hand) I did't have a leaking problem at all, maybe because I left the dough quite thick. Served it with vanilla icecream and tea.

This is just delicious! The plums I used were nice and tart and the crust is wonderful. This is to become one of my favorites.

I made this for a friend's family and thankfully they invited me to stay. The crust is fabulous! Could use this with any fruits. The quality of the fruit makes a big difference. The first time I made this the plums were nice and tart, which made this wonderful! I have tried this a few times, each time varying the spices I add.

This was a wonderful crust. I wonder if it could have been blind-baked for about 10 minutes before adding the fruit. Anyway, my crust did not leak ( I used a rectangular mold and just put it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. The plums were quite perfect just soaked in sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice, then glazed at the very end of baking with current jelly melted with a bit or orange liqueur and strained to remove seeds. Forget the allspice and vanilla.

Wow! The previous comments are almost like I had written them myself. I also used plums and pluots and it was delicious. The juices leaked, but it seems to be a flaw in the recipe. Any ideas on how to cure the leaky dough? How about chilling it after rolling and before assembly?

Dee-licious. How can you go wrong with ripe, in-season fruit in a simple but delicious pastry? Sure, my pastry leaked, but who cares when it tastes this good? The crust is divine. For the filling I used a combination of organic plums and pluots (plum/apricot hybrids) and ground my own allspice. A truly great summer dessert for very little effort. Yum!

Loved it! Especially the crust. I will make this one every year with the plums from the tree. Could also get creative with the fruit.

"Country-style" conjures rich flavors with taboo ingredients (butter? The ultra-rich european style is ridiculously good in this recipe). This desert is excellent! Even better if you share.... !

Everyone loved this tart, I used half plums and half apples and it was delicious. I thought the pastry was excellent. I will definately use this for other fruit aswell.

The filling idea works for a variety of fruits. Consider adding a tablespoon of cabernet or rum to deepen the flavor of the filling. Works well with other tart crust recipes, too.

my family loved the pie, it was a little messy, juices ran out, loved the dough will use it other pies.

My family seemed to like it, but then again, they wouldn't say it if they didn't. I only used a stick and a half of butter, and added two egg yolks and a teaspoon of vanilla and lemon juice instead of water. The crust is nice, but a little buttery. Instead of using jam, I chopped up about a cup and a half of dried cherries, dried plums and dried nectarines and used fresh plums and peaches. I used brown sugar for the inside. It was better the next day and better cold than warm. I think it brings out the flavors and the sweetness.

I liked this, but it wasn't to die for. Oddly, I thought it improved and tasted better the next day. The crust was very buttery and perhaps a bit too heavy for my taste.

I love this recipe. I thought I had lost it and am so pleased to find it on the web. I use it for apricots, peaches and plums.
