I cut the salmon into much bigger chunks than it called for, and used 2lbs for all the same listed quantities for the rest of the ingredients. They were delicate but really meaty and delicious! Definitely making these again.

This is a great recipe--even when using good hamburger buns and lettuce in place of brioche and radicchio. The only change I would make: The tarragon mayo needs some zip--maybe a dash of hot sauce or Old Bay.

Even my 14 year old loved this recipe. I use wholewheat bread crumbs and whole wheat buns and everyone loved it!

Take care not to overcook. I like my salmon moist. I cooked 3 minutes on one side, turned, cooked 1.5 minutes then shut the heat off and removed within half a minute. Perfect.

Correction: I used .75 salmon.

I would really rate this as 5 forks. I had 1.75 lb fresh wild salmon and was tired of grilling on a plank. Because of the capers, I did not add salt. Had good sandwich buns and since it was 105 degrees out I was not about to make a trip to the grocery store to get brioche. This recipe is a real keeper!

I've been making these since I used the recipe out of my copy of the magazine in 1996. I think there is an error here, because the the original recipe does have eggs in it. At any rate, I was a personal chef at the time, and ALL my clients loved them !!!

These were wonderful. I used the food processor and lightly pulsed, refrigerated for a couple hours, made with panko and served with the basil aioli from this site. I added 1/4t hot sauce to the aioli.

Simply put, these were awesome. I loved the combination of fresh tarragon with that distinctive salmoniness (yup, just coined that word) of the walleye. The lemon and capers sent it over the edge and into exceptional land. With so few ingredients and such big flavor, I'll definitely make these burgers again. (These were great reheated the second day, too, and served over an arugula salad!)

I've made lots of variations on salmon burgers and this one is a keeper. I used TJ's frozen salmon barely thawed, which made the chopping easy. I didn't have any prepared horseradish so I added a half tsp or so of wasabi powder which worked well. Also, I did a panko breading before sauteing: Dip in beaten egg, coat w/ panko, let dry a few minutes, saute gently in olive oil.

this is more like salmon hash. If you want the salmon to stick together in order to make burgers find another recipe containing eggs or an ingredient that actually holds food together

King salmon was on sale so bought a small piece, had the fish guy skin it for me (saved the skin and sauteed separately) and results were fantastic. That was a tough act to follow; tried it again with sockeye (also not quite as fresh) and results were good but nothing like the king. I like it with just a bit of the mayo, on a slice of toasted challah with good lettuce leaf on top. ooh la la

I have always made salmon cakes from canned salmon. I expected for this to taste way different from the cheap canned salmon.I didn't notice a huge difference so was a bit disappointed. Still it was yummy but not worth the high price of fresh salmon. I used frozen from Trader Joe's like another reviewer suggested.Also only used one piece of toasted bread for an open faced sandwich.

Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe or the mayonaise! I served it with homemade burger buns also from this site. Nice departure from standard burgers.

I was very satisfied with the texture of this dish. I served this on good quality hamburger buns and added 3 dashes of hot sauce to the mixture before I cooked them, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Oh, yes, I don't care for radicchio and served this with endive leaves instead. I will make it again!

I used frozen sockeye salmon fillets from Trader Joe's (at the price of fresh salmon, I don't make burgers with it). Very tasty, even a fussy teenager enjoyed it. I cut the recipe for the tarragon mayo in half, and still had leftovers for the next day.

Rating: 3
overall these are pretty good. I tried freezing some and chilling others in the fridge. the frozen ones stayed together nicely, however I felt they lost some flavor, and why freeze fresh fish unless your planning to keep for a while. The chilled ones were delicate but not impossible, much like a crab cake. I did not use egg. I would keep patties small, they cook better, and less falling apart. overall a good alternative to red meat.

My friend brought me a fresh silver salmon caught just yesterday and I am always looking for new ways to try salmon. I made absolutely NO modifications to this recipe for the burger. The differences I did make: Instead of frying in butter, I just used my Le Creuset grill pan and broiled 3 minutes each side. Voila - an absolutely moist, delicious and flavorful salmon burger. I skipped the tarragon mayonnaise and bread altogether. Just the burger with some steamed zucchini on the side. WONDERFUL!! I did not see the need for an egg at all.

I tried to serve this on a bun but it fell apart. So we ate it like a crab cake and thought it was really wonderful! A keeper

I made this pretty much as indicated (but I hand-minced the fish and added an egg). I thought the burgers were quite good, but they were overwhelming. First bite, yum. Second bite, kind of yum. Third bite, I think I've had enough. They worked better as a stand-alone thing like a crab cake. That way the mayo doesn't overpower. Next time, I will do it that way, as having a bun slathered in mayo wasn't all that special.

This is the nicest salmon burger recipe I've ever come across. I paired the burgers with big soft Calabrese buns and served with traditional burger toppings. They were exceptionally yummy.

we used wild alaskan sockeye (red) salmon and replaced tarragon with fresh dill - and we loved it.

I eliminated the bun and served them as I would a crab cake. My husband, a salmon lover, thought I was ruining his precious fish. Well, he raved about the flavor and texture. A new favorite around our house.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I added one egg and grilled the burgers; they turned out great! (I think the key to them not falling apart is dicing the salmon no larger than 1/4 in.) The flavors were delicious; I will definitely make these again!

I have been making this recipe since it came out in the magazine, its great! I add egg also, and freeze the burgers, but I cook them in a skillet as suggested, will try them on the grill. I subbed sour cream for the yogurt in the tarragon mayo, it was great!

I made these for Father's Day and everyone loved them. I did add an egg as a reviewer suggested and also refrigerated the patties for a few hours and then put them on the grill. They were perfect! Didn't fall apart at all. I think the key to them not falling apart is to make sure and chop the salmon nice and small (1/4" as the recipe states), plus the refrigeration. Also...I made 2 batches of the burgers, but just one batch of the tarragon mayo was plenty for 8 burgers...you do not need to double the mayo.

Wow, we thought this was fabulous! I used canned salmon, well rinsed, added several eggs and it held together. By mistake I put thyme in the mayo, but still it was just great.

Rating: 3
Made "as is" and one of the four patties did not hold together. Moist and tasty, but lacked that extra something to make it really special. The brioche complemented the tarragon mayo and salmon well, but I still felt something was lacking. I'll try the other salmon burger recipes on the site to see if I enjoy them more before coming back to this one.

BIG hit at the family graduation BBQ - even with the finicky eaters and vegetarians!! Burgers held together on the grill just fine using many of the helpful hints - 1. have market remove skin 2. chop salmon into very small pieces (I don't have a food processor otherwise would have done that however, hand chopping was relatively easy) 3. use an egg 4. use a burger press to form burgers 5. freeze burgers and cook on the grill frozen. THANK YOU to all the others out there who took the time to right the VERY helpful hints in the reviews ... they WORKED!!

Rating: 4
This went over BIG. I used a beaten egg, per earlier reviewers, and the patties still didn't hold together 100%, but they stayed mostly intact & I wasn't serving them on buns so it wasn't critical. Made an asian cucumber salad on the side & it was a nice combo.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe multiple times, ever since it was first published in the magazine and it is always a hit. To get the salmon to stick together, I lightly pulse the mixture in my food processor. That seems to help it grip togther without taking away all of the fresh fish texture. This is a great mid-week dinner or can be fancy enough for company (serve with the asian cole slaw, also from March, 1996)- it's a winner!

The real trick to making salmon burgers stick together is to freeze them then cook from the frozen state - preferably on the bbq. Not only do they stick together, they are handy for a quick dinner. You can make just salmon, lemon peel and dill stick together for grilling this way.

I have tried several recipes for fresh salmon burgers, all with bad results. all call for salmon to be cut in 1/4-inch pieces with an additon of different ingredients and breadcrumbs to hold it together, but my fresh salmon burgers never hold together. it s allways a mess... any tips for making a salmon burger hold together? thouh I like the taste of these burgers, I would like to make it again as a real patties and not just a mess in a pan!

I used the salmon whole and the following ingredients became a marinade with the addition of a tablespoon or so of olive oil. I coated the filets with the plain bread crumbs and cooked as usual in a 450 oven for 20min.I served the warm salmon over a bed of mixed baby greens that included radicchio topped the golden fillets with a generous dab of the tarragon mayonaise and sprinkled the entire dish with chopped tomatoes.Yum Even finiky hubby approved.

WOW - I followed the recipe except that I chilled the patties 1 hour and used olive oil instead of butter to cook them. I served them on egg hamburger buns. The radicchio isn't over-powering at all. The whole thing blended together and I swear I wouldn't have even known what yummy fish or fowl I was eating if I hadn't made them myself!!! Would've missed out on this recipe if not for the encouraging reviews. So glad I made this keeper.

We've used this recipe several times with salmon caught by my son in Lake Michigan. He loves that he has part in this great tasting meal. Good recipe that can be changed for different palates. We use a good tartar sauce and add an egg to bind a little more. Everyone enjoys this recipe at my house - not always an easy job!

I tripled this recipe,used copper river sockeye and froze the patties in freezer bags. They were just as delicious every time we had them. I've never tried the tarragon mayonnaise, but they're great with homemade tartar sauce.

I took all the suggestions and added them in the recipe- I added 1 egg and I refrigerated the patties for 2 hours. Then I placed a grate over the barbeque so they would not fall thru. A total success- 2 people who don't like fish were converts and made me write the recipe for them.

Now I know why all the 4 fork reviews. These were excellent. Will make again real soon!!

Delicious and healthy! Instead of burgers, I made it as a loaf using an egg (egg beaters) to help bind the ingredients together. Great use of leftover salmon. I would also encourage using fresh tarragon--its much nicer than the dried and really makes a difference, especially in the mayonnaise. I made this as a weight watchers meal substituting non fat yogurt for the mayonnaise, and served it on top the loaf with a fresh tarragon garnish.

My family loves this meal. We are not big tarragon lovers so we just use plain mayonnaise and it tastes great. I add one beaten egg to hold it together better. Wonderful!

I'm not a big fan of seafood but made these since my husband is. I was plesantly surprised by how much I liked them - they are really terrific! I don't have a good, fresh seafood outlet where I live so I opted to use the best canned salmon I could find. It worked wonderfully. I squeezed most of the liquid out before adding the other ingredients. I think the texture may have turned out even better than with pieces - it was light and flaky. I was concerned about them falling apart, but they held together without much problem despite not having an egg. This is one seafood recipie i'll gladly make again!

Awesome! We all loved them! Use fresh tarragon. I used sour cream instead of yogurt in the tarragon-mayo. Delish!!!! The patties are definately fragile, but I managed to keep them relatively together....maybe an egg would help bind them better? I dont think it's really that important anyway...The wonderful flavor makes up for the lack of cohesion.

I have made this several times. I substitute low fat sour cream for the yogurt, the consistency is better. If you aren't an eater of capers, just use a bit more lemon and a good grade pepper and it'll be fine.

Delicious! My husband does not like tarragon so I substituted with italian parsley. I barbecued them and served on homemade buns topped with mesclun salad and ripe tomato slices. Since then I have served them as an appetizer (the size of crab cakes)with the mayonaise on the side. A big hit.

These are excellent! I used left-over salmon, red onion, less capers, a beaten egg, fresh dill instead of tarragon and a dill mayo.( We're not big tarragon fans.) I made an anchovie, caper, dill mayo to go with the grilled whole salmon, for the original meal. Thanks everyone for your helpful suggestions!

This recipe was easy and delicious. The tarragon mayo is excellent. I had a little trouble getting the burgers to hold together, so next time I will probably cut up the salmon even smaller (as I do not have a food processor). I served it with the chickpea salad from this website and a sweet potato. YUM!!

I am from the UK and have been an avid reader of the Bon Appetit magazine since 1993 and was thrilled to find this recipe on your site as I have made it sooo many times. The burgers really are very good and make a wonderful starter if served on a bed of salad leaves with a dollop of the mayo and a sharp homemade dressing.

This was absolutely delicious! I altered the recipe by processing all of the condiments, then the salmon - it's hard to get big chunks of salmon to stick together. I also added two eggs to get it all to stick better.

One of the best, simple but elegant comfort dinners I've ever made! Pulsing the salmon mixture in a food processor for a couple of seconds makes a big difference in making it hold together in the "burger" when eating. It's fabulous, and I always get requests for it when we are having a relaxed but elegant dinner. Great with a simple salad. A real winner!
