yum! I didn't pre-cook the mushrooms; they still tasted great. My sister pointed out that the stuffing is the best part, and recommended scooping out extra mushroom from the 'stem hole' with a grapefruit spoon to make more room for stuffing. had already cooked the stuffing by this point but next time will add the extra mushroom to the stuffing mix. also i used italian seasoned bread crumbs.

I was in a hurry and so just sauteed the breadcrumbs in oil on the stovetop. I used a seed and nut, whole wheat bread which I think added flavor and character. Then I trusted the one review that said It worked not to pre-cook the mushroom caps. It was fine. My oven may have been a tad hotter, and I didn't have time for ingredients to cool before assembling but it was fine. Used extra garlic too. First appetizers to go at a pot luck with many to choose from. And yes lots of extra filling to look forward to creatively eating.

Sub'd Whole Foods breadcrumbs and added some cream cheese to make the mixture more moldable. Also used a bit of fresh rosemary and thyme along with the parsely. Very tasty in little crimini caps.

Yum, yum, yum. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of white bread. They were very good - better than most stuffed mushrooms I have encountered. I will indeed make these again!

easier to sweat the mushrooms in a saute pan w/little oil first. used my own fresh crumbs w/out oil. simple recipe, tweak for flavor, etc. excellent little bites before dinner, I have some mushrooms that won't last 2 more days so cooking them now. keeping the in the fridge until then works perfectly

Made this for my mother in law and some friends. Made three recipes that night; all of them got rave reviews. This recipe was the favorite of the night. It was very simple to make, wasn't very expensive and is fairly easy to make. Only suggestion is to make sure you keep track of everything. Since you will likely be using this as an appetizer, you might be cooking something else. If you leave mushrooms or bread in too long it will throw you off. Cooking them again tonight. Highly recommend.

I just made these for the second time for a New Year's Eve party. I heard a lot of "Who made the mushroom caps?" People loved them. Some things I learned the second time around: 1. It is usually easy to pop the stems out of the mushrooms, if one first takes a knife and cuts around the stem (without cutting all the way through the cap). 2. I used multi-grain bread this time and liked it more than the white bread I used the first time. 3. This time I used a food processor to grind the stems fairly finely. I think this aided my ability to mound the filling fairly high on each cap. 4. The filling can be used up following this method: a. On the baking pan on which the mushrooms were baked, turned them over, take gobs of filling and press into the caps, not caring if filling falls into the liquid in the pan. (At this point, I did not worry about mounding the filling, but I wanted to make sure that the caps were firmly filled.) b. When done with the quick first pass, scrape the moistened filling from the pan and add back to the bowl containing the remaining filling. This helped tremendously, as the filling had been a bit on the dry side, probably because my bread slices were on the large side. c. Take each filled cap and proceed to mound more filling onto it by hand, so that it effectively looks like a meatball, as viewed from the top. Run your finger along the outside of the mushroom to remove stray bits of filling and provide a clean edge to the now very mounded filling. d. Since the baking pan on which the mushrooms were initially baked is now littered with bits of filling, place the stuffed mushrooms onto the cleaner pan which had been used to bake the bread crumbs. (If a single pan is used, make sure to clean the excess filling bits from the pan before baking the mushrooms again.)

Great recipe. Was pretty simple to make, and everyone raved about them. Good flavor, fairly light app if you are serving a heavier meal. I served with heavy steak and mac and cheese and it was a perfect complement. Next time I am going to add some sherry. I think that will put it over the top.

Delicious! Great suggestion to use a melon-baller to excavate the mushroom caps. When sweating the caps, I had them on a cooking grate so they don't cook in the liquid. I didn't use cheese, since we're lactose-intolerant but added extra garlic and fresh rosemary to the mix. Extra? Um...I ate it. Enjoy!

This recipe was delicious! I changed it up a little because we didn't have some of the stuff on hand. Instead of using celery, I used zucchini, and I used storebought breadcrumbs to save time. Also, I added a little salami and some sage. Right now I am eating the stuffing with my fingers! I was surprised how much liquid came out of the mushrooms; definitely don't skip that step or you'd have soggy mushrooms.

These were good, but I found them plain. Everyone loved them, even a committed mushroom-hater. Made the teen request list so I'll be making them again.

Rating: 3
As mentioned by some other reviewers this recipe resulted in too much stuffing for the mushrooms, however, I saved the leftovers and intend to make this again. I used 1.5 bunches of scallions instead of a white onion and ommited the celery; also, I used gruyere and emmental instead of the parmesan - it came out quite delicious.

Rating: 2
I modified the recipe quite a bit - used only 1/4 cup prepared bread crumbs instead of fresh bread, and added minced chorizo. The problem was really with the mushrooms - sweating is a good idea in theory, but mine ended up so shriveled they were a bit unappetizing. Maybe I baked them too high? The recipe didn't specify, so I used the common default of 350 degrees. Or perhaps bigger mushrooms may have helped? In any case, the stuffing was very good, so I added it to some sauteed fresh tomatoes for a spaghetti sauce. Couldn't stop eating that!

I left out the oregano since I wasn't in the mood for it and the resulting caps had a really nice flavor. I didn't bother to bake the caps before filling them as it's really not necessary. I also used olive oil for all the fat--I didn't feel like mixing flavors. I sauteed the veggies in the following order based on size and typical cooking times: first onions, then mushrooms, then added garlic and celery. Everything cooked up perfectly. I had about 1/4 cup of leftover stuffing which I scrambled up with some eggs where it was delicious.

This was a great recipe. Yes, there was a lot of leftover filling, so I froze it and used some in breakfast burritos w/ scrambled eggs. I also would use the leftover filling and put it in phyllo or puff pastry cups as it'll require more filling than the mushrooms. I've added italian sausage to this recipe to make it richer although non-vegetarian and it was delicious too! Also, pre- cooking the mushrooms to exude the liquid was a GREAT idea!! I will be doing that again!

This is a great recipie. I added crispy bacon broken into bits to the ingredients, and instead of sauteeing everything in butter left in some of the bacon grease. Is wonderful finger food at parties, and lets face it, everything is better with bacon!

My only complaint was that there was waaaaaay too much filling leftover for my shrunken little mushrooms - even after piling it in! Any suggestions what I can use it for? Will it keep until I buy more mushrooms?

This recipe was a lifesaver this holiday season. It's easy and impressive and you can make plenty of substitutions based on personal choice or dietary restrictions. I make a vegan version with a little vegetable broth, olive oil and chopped nuts, no cheese, butter, or egg. I've also substituted store-bought for homemade breadcrumbs without sacrificing much flavor. Don't skip the step of pre-baking the mushroom caps.

Fabulous! I, too, had enough stuffing to generously fill 2 1/2 pounds of fairly large mushrooms.

Fabulous and I love stuffed schrooms! Not sure how everyone had extra stuffing - I only had 12 mushrooms to start and had no leftovers. Followed the recipe exactly except I added a boxed of chopped frozen spinach and it was phenomenal. Definitely my new recipe!

these were fantastic! i used multigrain bread for the crumbs - i highly recommend not skipping that step: the oil you add to the crumbs adds that extra fat/flavor that you need for this.

Absolutely delicious and no meat required. Baking the mushroom caps 1st before stuffing them made a big difference.

I diced canned bamboo shoots and used them in place of the celery, used parmesan Italian bread in place of white bread, used red onion instead of white, and left out the garlic and parsley. I also added an egg and mixed the parts by hand right before the final 20 minute baking. They were delicious and I've made them several times since with my altered recipe. They're gone in seconds.

I don't eat mushrooms but I made these for a party and everyone seemed to like them. I thought they were pretty easy to make as well. I used store bought mushroom caps. The stuffing definitely needs a little kick! We added some Tony's (a Louisiana staple!) and that did the trick! I also added the EVOO as suggested when baking. Great basic recipe - I will definitely experiment a little more with them!

These came out great, I would definitely make them again. This was the most popular dish at our New Year's Eve party.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got raves! I followed a lot of the advice in the comments: deleted the celery, added an egg, used a 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, added some extra cheese and rosemary. I also replaced the white bread with an asiago cheese bread and used preshredded Italian- five-cheese. The recipe is a good jumping off point, but I think the additions make the appetizer work. Thanks for the suggestions!

Simple and delicous. Made them for lunch today using 24 large mushrooms. I will try some of the variations from other reviewers, but this is a great basic recipe.

I added 1/8 tsp of rosemary to the mix which made it much more flavorful. I would also suggest "baking" 10 more mushrooms since there's a lot of extra stuffing. Our guests really enjoyed them.

We enjoyed these very much but I did substitute fennel for the celery and used chopped spring greens instead of the parsley. I used the leftover filling to spread on the flounder before rolling it up in the BAKED FLOUNDER WITH TOMATO CAPER SAUCE (also on this site). One word of caution, make sure the white bread that is used for the bread crumbs is not too sweet - it can throw off the balance of flavors.

These were not very flavorful. And a lot of the stuffing was left over. Could have used some spice.

I used cremini mushrooms, skipped the breadcrumbs, and added 4 large leaves of fresh chopped sage. Also, I halved the recipe because I was just cooking for two. They were very good and flavorful, but they needed "something". Next time I will definitely add some pancetta or bacon, but overall this is a very good recipe.

I thought they were pretty bland. definitely not the best stuffed mushrooms.

I have made this a few times, and probably will again, but I think it needs a little more kick/flavor and more cheese. Also, I can't imagine being able to get all the cleaning, chopping and stuffing done in the stated "20 minutes active time," but maybe I'm just slow. I also had quite a bit of extra stuffing left over after filling all the mushrooms.

Rating: 4
This was great, but I made a few changes. I skipped the celery & parsley and used a few handfuls of ripped-up fresh spinach instead. I also added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar to the stuffing mixture for a more interesting flavor. And to make it easier, I used bread crumbs (unflavored ones from Whole Foods) instead of bread, which allowed me to skip the food processor step.

These got great reviews at my family Christmas party! My only negative: they were a little dry after coming out of the oven. Next time, I'll drizzle some herb-infused olive oil on top during the last 5 minutes of baking.

I love the tip about sweating the mushrooms before stuffing. I also add salad shrimp pulsed in a food processor with the cooked vegitables and bread crumbs...Serve in a cream of asparagus soup in a chafing dish and you won't have a single leftover!!

To tell u the truth, i havent got to try it, everyone ate it all, lol. But they all loved it. Next time, ill add some sausage or bacon so it can be more than just bread. Great for holidays.

These got raves from everyone. I did add bacon and cajun spice mix since we like spicey food. I also used left over corn bread. It's easy to make unless you are slow with a knife. Using a food processor to chop the stems saves time also.

Delicious recipe, even for one coming from an Italian family. I substituted equivalent amounts of leek for the celery and a shallot in place of some of the onion, and it turned out divine. I had to make more before my guests arrived as I had eaten about 7 of them before I even set them out.

These were delicious and disappeared at the luncheon to which I brought them! The trick of "sweating" the mushrooms first in the oven is brilliant! I used focaccia instead of sandwich bread, and I added half a beaten egg to the mix before baking, which kept the filling from falling apart. Yum!

Because my oven isn't working, I experimented with this dish by cooking the mushrooms in the microwave, and they turned out beautifully. I didn't use breadcrumbs, but followed the rest of the recipe. Very tasty.

I used crumbs from a heavy honey whole wheat bread with a spectacular,nutty effect on overall flavor. Cooking the mushrooms to extract the water is critical. I couldn't believe the water that came out. These stuffed mushrooms were gone in a flash and preferred over a spinach-feta mushroom stuffing. Leftover sauteed mushrooms, onions, celery with seasoning made an delicious omelette with swiss cheese. This stuffed mushroom was worth the effort and was easy to prepare ahead. This is my new stuffed mushroom recipe. The search is over.

though it was a great base to start with. added caramelized shallots, diced country ham, and crumbled cornbread instead of white bread.

I have made stuffed mushrooms several times and found they are much tastier without the bread. Just sautee the chopped mushroom stems, shallots, lots of garlic, celery, seasoning of choice, cheese of some sort and a little ham or bacon. You will be satisfied with the flavor.

we changed the recipe and included 1/4 cup of baby shrimp and a few slivers of smoked salmon. Also instead of white mushrooms, we used cremini. We ended up with an smooth, earthy flavor w/ a NW flare. Bon Appetit

I made this for an appetizer for Easter Sunday. Everyone raved about how good they were. I used a hot pepper olive oil while browing the mushrooms and that gave them a little zing! All of my cousins loved them. The only thing I would change is maybe add a little cayenne pepper and I used some diced red peppers in the stuffing for color. Excellent recipe and easy.
