My husband and I love this recipe. I couldn't find frozen naan, either, so I used fresh whole-wheat naan instead. I also used more spinach than it calls for.

I love a lazy recipe that tastes great - who has time to spend an hour+ cooking each time you want to eat? I used a Jyoti Saffron Cream Sauce (Indian cuisine, tomato based sauce with onions), and swiss chard as subsitutes. Great for an easy fix.

Great recipe for frozen naan and bottled curry. Don't become lazy, Epicurious.

The frozen naan IS very good! (I served it on the side instead.) This dish was tasty but very mild; I added about a teaspoon of a hot green curry paste I had on hand (the Thai Kitchen brand) and a tablespoon of Patak's cilantro curry paste - this gave it great flavor and some heat. I also added some cauliflower that I had cooked in the microwave for a few minutes, to make it more of a complete meal. We were using the naan to sop up every last bit of the sauce - tasty!
