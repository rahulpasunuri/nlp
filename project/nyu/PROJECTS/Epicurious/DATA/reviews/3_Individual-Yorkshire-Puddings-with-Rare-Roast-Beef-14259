Delicious batter, but a puds got a little soggy after a they cooled. Should probably leave them in a tad longer.

um....cook from canada...the reason they were flat is because it was actually 2 recipes. the top half was for the puddings. the bottom half for the horseradish cream to be piped on top of the individual puddings with the roast beef. the recipe wasnt clear, however.

What a dreadful recipe for Yorkshire Puds. So many unnecessary ingredients. Yorkshire Puds are very simply just eggs, flour and the fat from the roast beef you are roasting. they are a SIMPLE side dish to complement the roast beef (and in Yorkshire the pud is actually eaten before the beef) and not in competition with it.

Well..Thank goodness it was St Patrick's day as these little appetizers went well as Irish Pancakes..they did not rise at all..I followed the recipe to the T. I threw everything into the blender ,plus a tablespoon of parsley.. I was glad I added the parsley to the mix as they had a hint of green! Next time I'll try the recipe included in the review..

I made this for the holidays also. Not huge hit but my wife and I enjoyed them. I added a little more horseradish then called for and made the pudding the day before.

I made these for a holiday party everyone loved them!! I was making several other appetizers at the same time, and found the Yorkshire Puddings to be tedious. I will try them again and make the puddings ahead of time.

I make these every year for New Year's using left-over roast beef (keep the rarest portion for these!) and they're ALWAYS the hit of the party. Easy, elegant, delicious.

REALLY easy to make, and a total hit at our holiday party! I had at least three people ask for the recipe before the night was over. My only change was to add a hint more horseradish than the recipe called for. And for vegetarians, we switched out the meat for grated raw carrot and it was delicious!

This recipe worked perfectly for us! Every once in a while I make a Yorkshire Pudding or Popovers, and for some unknown reason, they "just don't pop" and I cannot figure out why. If yours didn't rise, give them another chance!

Tried this as an English appetizer for our Gourment club. WOW.!!!! These were devoured very quickly. Good thing I didn't bring more, the guests would have filled up on these and been too full for the main course. Can't believe only 75% would make these again. I hope my rating brings up the percentage.

Yorkshire puddings are really a recipe that you need to get a "feel" for. The way that I make them is quite simple, but still delicious and has been passed down from my great grandmother. I use a large 4 cup measuring cup to make the batter in. I toss in two eggs, and whisk them up until slightly beaten, and add enough 1% or 2% (skim kills the texture and they don't fluff!) to make a total of about 1 to 1-1/2 cups. I add salt and pepper to taste and whisk in enough flour (little at a time to prevent lumps)to make is it a little less thick than pancake batter. The important part is to make the batter early in the day and cover and refrigerate it in the coldest part of your fridge for a few hours. Then about 40 minutes before you want them, put a smidge of margarine in the bottom of regular sized muffin tins and place into a pre heated 425 °F oven until butter starts to brown. Pull them out of the oven and pour in batter quickly until about 2/3 full. Put back in the oven and DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR until they are done about 30- 35 minutes. THe ice cold batter in the hot cups helps fluffiness (I have no idea why) and keeps them from sticking. I have only one batch in 15 years stick, but they weren't cooked long enough.

Even better than my mother-in-law's recipe and she is a Brit! The kids loved it too!

I tried this recipe and was disappointed with the results. The puddings didn't puff up like I expected and they were hard to get out of the pans, though the flavor was good. The horseradish sauce was good but I would try a different recipe for the puddings.

moist, delicious and a good addition to roast beef dinner especialy to soak up gravy, akin to dunking donuts in coffee but so much better.
