Truly fantastic.My sister made this for the family to snack on over Christmas holiday. This was my favorite dish of the entire week- better than the fabulous prime rib, twice-baked potatoes, creme brulee- now that is some delicious hummus!!! I spread it on whole grain toast for breakfast, on pita bread for lunch. Sadly, it didn't last long enough to try it as bruschetta with tarragon and parsley.

After reading reviews, started with 1/2 the amount of lemon and tahini, but doubled the garlic and used just a sprinkle of chili flakes. It was delicious so didn't adjust anything further.

I wouldn't change a thing about this bean puree which is just hummus with honey and balsamic added. I spread it with some goat cheese on toasted whole wheat bread, topped that with roasted peppers that I tossed in champagne vin. and threw some arugula and tomatoes that I tossed with basil oil on top of everything. Kind of like a big vegetarian open faced sandwich. My husband couldn't even finish his whole plate and he always complains when I cook vegetarian meals.

An Italian take on Hummus, I love it! I think that like the drizzle of oil and sprinkle of paprika on hummus, sprinkle of fresh herbs and the squeeze of lemon MAKES this dish. I forgot the pine nuts, and can imagine it would be extraordinary with them. Having made hummus plenty before, I thought the tahini quantity was a lot too much, so reduced that to avoid the chalky texture associated with it, and found adding water helped to smooth things a lot.

The hummus reference point is kind of a poor one. Beyond the chickpea- tahini-olive oil backbone, there isn't much here in common with hummus. Really, it has more in common flavor-wise with peanut butter, but it isn't exactly that either. The recipe produces a sort of unholy marriage of fatty, sweet, acid, and hot elements. The complexity is surprising and distinct. I would be curious to explore more recipes by Tramonto.

We love this. The first time I made it, I forgot to purchase the tahini (ok, big laugh), and we didn't have time to rush back to the store, so I just added enough more oil and lemon juice to make it into a thick paste. It was a huge hit at our party that night. The next time I made it, I added the tahini, and neither my husband nor I liked it as much. We prefer spicy, tangy foods, so the extra bit of lemon was great for us. Now, whenever we make it, we just leave out the tahini. Try it!

This was very good and unique. I did about 2/3 Tbsp of chili flakes and it was a nice kick without being overpowering. Overall this recipe is a little tangy for my tastes, so I might go a little lighter on the lemon next time. Also, I served it with toasted pita bread 'bruschetta' instead of baguette.
