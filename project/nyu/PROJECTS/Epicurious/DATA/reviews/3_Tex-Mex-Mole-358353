Very nice, authentic flavor. Easy and fast to make. I simmered chicken in the sauce once it was done per the recipe. With the lid off the meat cooked and the sauce thickened in the additional 5-7 mins of cooking. I didn't have the exact peppers on hand so used a dried Chipotle and a fresh jalapeno. I think it could also use a bit more chocolate and peanut butter for depth of flavor and color.
