This is a nice accompaniment for a hot and spicy dish. I added more cilantro and a pinch of salt. Make in advance so the flavors meld. I blended it too much...recommend keeping it thick by holding back some of the youurt and folding it in.

Just didn't do it for me. I tried this because I had all the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't make it again. Some fresh dill would have been much better.
