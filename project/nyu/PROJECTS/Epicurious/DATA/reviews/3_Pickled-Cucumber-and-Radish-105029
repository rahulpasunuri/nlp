This was refreshing and great for cooling summer dish. I'll try using pickling or Persian cucumbers and Daikon instead of the usual red radishes.

I liked this. I made it as part of the original menu with the scallops and black rice. Everything was complimentary. I actually think I liked this salad best of the three recipes!

I'm surprised by the unenthusiastic reviews. I think this salad is lovely, easy and refreshing. I take it to summer barbecues all the time. It's great with fried chicken.

VERY ordinary. I even added some celery seed to kick up the sweet & sour flavor and it fell flat on its face. I'll stick with my other recipes for this combo. It wasn't yuck but pretty close.

This has become a staple around our house this summer. SO quick and easy. Everyone has enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. Can be put together in a snap. I also add garlic before popping in the frig.

Very easy. Adding garlic and pickled ginger gives this salad an oriental zing.

Better recipe: one cup of good quality NON-seasoned rice vinegar warmed over low heat to just dissolve 3 TBL brown sugar with dried crushed red pepper to taste (add pinch of salt if you wish, I don't); cool briefly and add halved sliced english cuke pieces in a jar to just cover and refrigerate. Wait a day or more. Delicious and simple, excellent in sandwiches or salads(or snacking) add julienned baby carrots if you like.

Excellent! I put crushed garlic & a pinch of red pepper flakes in brine. Strained out before adding to cukes & radishes. So simple. Husband said, "we'll have this often, won't we."

Adding garlic is a good touch. This is a summer staple!

Could this be any easier? Next time I'll try the garlic as well, and maybe will cut the radishes into wedges. Otherwise wouldn't change a thing! KIMBER

Made this recipe exactly as is and both my husband and I loved it. Will definitely make this again and again, may experiment a little with some of the other suggestions.

Took the advice of previous reviewers and was rewarded with a delicious and different summer salad. Used radishes and kirby cucumbers (seeds removed)chopping into a medium dice. Simply whisked the dressing, adding a little red pepper flake. Marinated overnight. Served as a "salsa" along side/on top of highly-seasoned, grilled lamb burgers. Wonderful complement. Note: After 24 hours, salad heated downhill fast.

Great pickles! My family is Chinese, and this is how we make pickles. Try adding a few dashes of dried red pepper flakes, and some crushed garlic cloves, let sit overnight. We also used sticks of daikon radish, as well as the small kirby cucumbers (also called "pickling cucumbers"). Don't use the usual garden variety cucumbers (the large fat ones), they tend to end up too watery, and not crisp.

this salad goes good with a fish dish. i also use it as a side with sandwiches. i put small chunks of carrot and onion in mine

I have been making this recipe for several years. The only thing I do differently is instead of radishes I add thinly sliced red onion. I find men particularly like the pickled onion. You might just add sugar to suit. Also, I don't boil the syrup, just thoroughly whisk it until the sugar is disolved. Really tasty with barbequed meats or fried chicken!

Nice and light salad that goes well with fresh seafood dishes. Very east to make and the light taste and crispy texture of the ingredients make this recipe a keeper.

I loved this salad-with a few changes. I don't care for radishes so I omitted them and I added chopped fresh dill. The result is a light and fresh tasting dish that goes wery well with fish or anything that is grilled. It was still great after siiting overnight in the fridge.
