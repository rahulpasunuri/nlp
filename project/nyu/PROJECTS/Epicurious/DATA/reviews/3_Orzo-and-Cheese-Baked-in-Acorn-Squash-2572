Nice recipe as just about everything needed is in the average pantry but it is rather bland for my taste. No complaints but if you can add a punch of flavor you will get raves. Maybe horseradish cheddar? Cinnamon? Whatever direction your preference goes to , add it.

So easy and terrific! One of my son's absolute favorites since 2009 when he was 10. Home grown squash makes it even better this season. Any type of sharp or savory cheese will do.

Forget all cheeses for this recipe EXCEPT 1 cup Velveta & a small handful of Harvarti!! Use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of Milk, add FIRE ROASTED Tomatoes & Garlic, chopped Jerk Chicken Breast, FRESH Basil & Dill. Salt & Pepper with Sesame Oil on Squash. If you want to get fancy, sprinkle Gorgonzola or Goat Cheese on top. This dish is amazing with a Salad of your choice, Garlic Cresaunt, & a nice Malbec wine. Will absoutley make again!! This turns Mac & Cheese into a 5 star meal!

I tweaked the recipe to include 1 lb. ground turkey sausage, browned with onions. Then I subbed room temp apple juice for the water to bake the squash and didn't cover it. Also, I used chicken broth and added another 1/2 cup each of the sharp cheddar and mozzarella, and omitted the tabasco. Once the orzo was done, I added it to the sausage and cooked just a moment longer, then divided it into the squash and sprinkled with cheddar and parm and baked only for 15 minutes. I thought it was perfect, and even my veggie-phobic kids loved it!

Lose the cheddar and go with 3/4 to 1 cup of smoked gouda. Makes all the difference in the world!

This recipe was not extremely flavorful. Herbs/spices needed to be added. The squash by itself was blah so the cheese pasta inside did not transmit much flavor. Probably wouldnt make again...

After reading the other reviews, I substituted veggie stock, used less milk, used way more cheese (closer to a cup) and added cayenne and paprika. Topped it with more cheddar instead of the parm and it came out splendidly! Would love to try this with goat cheese and/or thyme.

Not the most exciting recipe, but good potential for creative comfort food. I added extra cheese, used cayenne instead of hot sauce, and mixed in some paprika. I'll definitely make this again and play around with it.

I agree with others that this was a little bland, even after reading reviews and making a point to spice it up. I might do a more flavorful cheese next time... i don't know, something to kick up the pasta, but not overwhelm the unique flavor of the squash. Since this was served with jerk chicken, i used Caribbean spices and coconut milk for the sauce, plus a LOT more hot sauce than called for. Didn't cook the sauce down as much, so it stayed creamy. Doubled the parmesan on top, mixed with a little brown sugar to make a nice crust. I would say this is worth making, as long as you're willing to experiment a little! Lots of possibilities!

Very different, very good. Was looking to prepare acorn squash differently and this was it. Definately will make again.

This was the best thing I've made in awhile. I used a full cup of smoked gouda instead of the 1/2 cup cheddar, and added sauteed mushrooms and onions. Used a little cayenne pepper instead of tobasco sauce, but otherwise just salt and pepper. Am thinking of serving it covered in tomato sauce next time. The possibilities are endless.

I used the main idea of this recipe and created my own. I microwaved the acorn squash face up with some water for 8 minutes (had to make dinner quick). I cooked the orzo according to this recipe. Once the squash was ready, I added cajun season, the orzo, and greek feta. My husband liked it a lot. I will definitely cook acorn squash again and stuff it with orzo.

This was a boring dish. Perhaps mixing cheese with the rice would improve it? I added roasted garlic and onions, which no doubt helped, but it wasn't great. A tremendous amount of salt and Cholula did help.

I thought this was a perfect easy Fall dinner. I used mozza cheese instead of cheddar because that is what I had on hand, added some sauteed green onions and I roasted the squash cut side down with a bit of olive oil. I think it added a depth of caramelized flavour that steaming it can't. I think this would be amazing with blue cheese, but my husband does not like blue cheese so I will have to leave it to someone else to try!

I agree with all the comfort food comments. It's perfect for a cold fall night when you just want something filling and at least relatively good for you. I did sautee onions and substitute rice for orzo, but we were still very pleased with the results. It's going in the list of "will make again"

Comfort food was exactly what I had in mind tonight, with snow gently falling and several acorn squash left from Thanksgiving, ripening to a lovely orange color. But comfort food needn't be bland. I seasoned the squash with a generous grind of salt and pepper, as well as my favorite Dynamite Herbs, from Golden Fig Epicurean Delights of Minneapolis. A tsp. of whole grain Dijon mustard and odds and ends of artisan cheeses in the orzo made for a zestier filling. Oh, and some buttered bread crumbs on top. I'm happy!

I made it with acorn squash, subbed soy milk for dairy, and farm-fresh gruyere for cheddar - and MAN was it good!

This was good comfort food like another reviewer said. When I make it again, I won't reduce the milk down as much to try for a slightly creamier pasta mix.

I used quinoa instead of orzo. It turned out really nicely-- my boyfriend and I both loved it.

This is a great, easy dish. I'm guessing people who hated it maybe had bland squash--with a good, sweet squash it's hard not to like. I have played around with adding veggies to the orzo mix, for color as well as flavor.

This was okay, but needs some help. The 25 minutes of cooking at the end made the orzo very dry.

I made this last night while I wasn't feeling well and it turned out to be excellent comfort food. All the negative reviews of this recipe made me feel a little tenative about making it, but it turned out to be lovely. I thought that the nutty flavor and creamy consistency of the squash complemented the cheesy orzo filling quite nicely. Next time I may add a little sauteed onion to the orzo, although one of the things I really liked about this dish was how simple the flavors involved were. Excellent Fall fare; it may show up on my table again at Thanksgiving time.

I wish I had read more of the reviews about this. My feelings was the same, the fillinf in itself is quite good so is the squash, but it's a strange combination that doesn't really compliment either - sort of as if you put straight up mac and cheese in the squash.....I like the idea of using brown rice, spinach and just parmesan. Next time, I'll try it that way.

i added a little cumin to the mixture and used asiago instead of cheddar, it was quite lovely.

I haven't tried this yet, but am guessing that maybe some people who didn't like it are used to squash being spiced up itself. I know I usually make squash to be used in something, or mash it once it's cooked with something sweet [honey, brown sugar] or savory [roasted garlic or cheese]. This seems like a good, straightforward, inexpensive dish. I like those!

This was an easy recipe. I, too, microwaves my squash and saved some time. I also added cooked sausage, garlic and herbs to the filling. It was good, but not great. Quite bland. Perhaps it just needs a LOT more tabasco.

The best part about this recipe is how wonderful the acorn squash is--it's nutty and sweet. We really were surprised by how flavorful this dish turned out to be.

I substituted tomato soup for the broth and it was amazing! This is a meal in itself with the vegetable, soup, pasta, and cheese. I also cooked the squash in the microwave for 10 minutes instead of the oven to save time. A great fall recipe.

This is a nice simple vegetarian main dish. I have toasted the orzo in the oven to add a little more nutty flavor.

I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to care for this; it's nothing fancy, but I've made it several times and like it as is.

I could not find Orzo, so I had to sub a small macaroni, but it was still good... a bit too much cheese, but that was more my fault then the recipe. Would make again.

Everyone in our party of 4 liked this- I used brown rice instead of orzo, and all fresh grated parmesan instead of the cheddar. And I added 1/2 cup of shredded spinach leaves at the end of cooking the filling. Good stuff.

My husband loved this, but I agreed with other reviews and thought the combination was strange. When I make it again, I'll leave out the squash.

My husband really loved this dish, but he said it was better with a little added butter. I will make it again and probably experiment with different seasonings in the cheesy orzo mixture next time. Seems like it could be a very versatile recipe.

I agree with everyone else, this combination did not work - squash was really boring.

I agree that the stuffing was good but it didn't go well with the squash. If I made it again I would make them seperatly. My husband thought the orzo looked like the seeds of the squash. Maybe that was the intention.

I used acorn squash which proved a bit bland - the orzo was great, but it didn't need the squash to be good (I did add some extra cheese to get the cheese flavor up) Maybe I'd try it again with a bolder flavored squash. However, I've already made the orzo part again - it's quick, easy and yummy!

I used leftover white rice instead of the orzo and lots of cheese and tabasco and served it with spinch sauteed with garlic on the side. I've made it twice and my husband and I both thought it was tasty comfort food.

The orzo stuffing was good, but it did not compliment the slightly sweet taste of the squash. It was too over powering.

We loved this recipe! It's very filling and really only needs a hearty green salad to make a meal.

I really enjoy this dish and have made it many times. It's really easy and very healthful. It's an easy recipe to cut in two: I usually make half the recipe, have one for dinner and take the other for lunch to work the next day. It's a good dish to make to accompany fish, I have found, in particular something like trout. I also made a couple of these for a thanksgiving dinner at my home; everyone really liked it, and it was something different for the meal.
