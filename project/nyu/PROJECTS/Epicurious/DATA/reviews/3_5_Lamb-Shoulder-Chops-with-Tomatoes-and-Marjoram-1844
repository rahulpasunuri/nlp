Doubles easily. Go easy on salt (as others have said); flavor comes out strong in the end. Used fresh basil and dried thyme. Everybody (1yr old thru 80) enjoyed!

This is my first review because this dish was delicious and so easy. I followed the recipe except put in another clove of garlic. The tomato garlic sauce was really tasty. I'll make this again.

Very good - a new favorite. I've made it three times this year. My five year old and my picky husband both love it.

Awesome recipe that gets the flavor out of the lamb well. I simmered for the recommended hour and added a bit of fresh thyme as well. Very tasty, and the flavors meld together well, especially the next day. Also tried this a couple of weeks later as a stew with lamb stew meat and a few more vegetables (kale and peas) in the tomato mix. Either way, eat it with fresh artisan bread or pasta.

Talk about insane flavor! I usually don't write reviews, but this I just had to do. I doubled the recipe since I didn't have any side dishes except for salad, and I also double the cooking time...what a difference that made. The meat was literally falling off the bones with a wonderful tenderness that couldn't be achieved in a half hour. I also added a ton more garlic, but I tend to do that with all my recipes because I'm a huge garlic lover. Another modification I made was sprinkling fresh thyme at the end since that's what I had in the fridge. My friend that I made it for absolutely loved it and couldn't stop eating it. It's a really easy meal that is absolutely delicious and requires much less preparation than many other dishes I've made. I definitely recommend it with some or all of the modifications, especially doubling the cooking time.

I made this recipe the other night following other reviewers suggestions of doubling cook time to 1 hr and adding basil as well as marjoram... It was easy and fantastic! We would definitely make again!

Excellent! What you end up with is a piece of meat that is falling apart, topped with a rich pulpy tomato sauce that is heavy of the lamb, spiced of the seared garlic ...which turn out to be flavor bombs. As with the other reviewers, I cooked it in the tomato sauce (covered) for a full hour, and boy was it different. 30 minutes in and it was good, but after an hr it was impossible to turn the meat without the bones falling out. Also didn't have marjorum so used basil and thyme, more later. I think the points of this recipe is that the searing of the meat is really picked up by the garlic, combine that with the sauce which is by that time infused with the flavor. I'd also argue that spices are secondary but beware to "salt to taste" last because it get saltier the more it cooks down. My old [Syrian] Lower East Side roommate used to cook his cheap goat-bits very similar to this, clearly you can use many different types of meat.

Absolutely give it an hour to slow simmer! - you will have tender chops. I used red wine, plenty of garlic, and basil and thyme in place of marjoram. Not the original- but very good. Polenta would be great with it.

I doubled the simmering time -- what a difference! From tough to tender in one hour (half hour really didn't cut it). Also used dried basil instead of marjoram - fabulous and easy.

I was a bit disappointed in this . . . it's easy and a way to use lesser cuts of lamb but certainly not exceptional. I stuck to the recipe except I decreased the amount of tomatoes used.

An absloutely NO FUSS meal, that everyone thinks I spent all day on when it only took about a half an hour. The resulting sauce of tomatoes, garlic, onions and white wine with the marjoram (plenty of substitutions for your herb o' choice work great) was good enough to use on chicken and beef as well. A very versatile recipe!

So much fuss for a very average dish. Cooking the lamb on the stovetop makes a MESS! There are other nice choices for this cut of meat. SKIP this one, it's not worth it.

This is a quick and easy recipe--perfect for a winter dinner. Next time, I'll simmer the lamb-tomato sauce longer since this cut of lamb isn't all that tender. I substituted diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes and did not drain them. I also added a bit of flour-water mixture to thicken at the end. My husband really like this dish.

This turned out better than anticipated. With the exception of more time it was quite easy! Basically followed the recipe, but added half the marjorum to the braising liquid, increased the red pepper, added a bit of "Jane's Crazy Mixed-up Salt", braised for 1 hour+ and then reduced the sauce to a thick consistency (which took 20-30 minutes). Partner gave rave reviews. Will make this again without hesitation.

This recipe is easy, delicious & the perfect use for this inexpensive cut of lamb. I've made it twice so far & both times it was fabulous. I served it with a cauliflower leek pureè - the perfect foil for the sauce.

Personally I think this recipe needs some adjustments. I found it too soury. I already reduced the tomatoes by half and still find it too overwhelming. I will make this again but will adjust the amount of tomatoes used.

I didn't have great hopes for this recipe, given how few seasonings it asks for, but I loved it. It was really easy to make and the flavors went very well together. Recommended.

A great recipe that results in a very tender chop and the sauce is exceptionally tasty.

I have loved this easy recipe for 9 years. I make it often. I especially love to pair it with the mashed potatoes with green onions and parmesan that was featured in the original article. Great comfort food!
