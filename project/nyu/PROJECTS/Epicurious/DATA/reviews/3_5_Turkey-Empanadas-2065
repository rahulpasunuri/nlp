I thought that this was great. The biscuits are a perfectly fast way to make empanadas, and they make the dish richer.

I have made these many times. Each time the reviews are fabulous. They make great picnic foodsandare wonderful when traveling. A little time consuming to put together but oh so worth it.

This recipe was delicious. The empanadas were light and crispy; I fried them in peanut oil. The meat filling was tasty but a little salty for us. Next time I will refrain from adding salt; the Cajun seasoning and pepper would have been sufficient. I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of plain Monterey Jack. I think it was a good choice. Next time I want to experiment and add diced apples or pears to the meat mixture. I think that a little sweet taste would go great with the Cajun spices. I loved this recipe and look forward to making more empanadas using biscuit dough. It is so quick and easy.

This filling recipe is quite good and easy to make. I reduced the onions to about 3/4 cup, and the cajun seasoning to 3 tsp, due to picky eaters, and I was out of Jack cheese, so used some goat cheese instead. Filling tasted VERY spicy when it was on the stove, even after adding cheese, but after baking inside empanada dough, it was not very spicy at all, so would go full amount next time. I didn't have biscuits, so I used an empanada dough from elsewhere. Although the dough we used detracted from the flavor, the filling was good, so will definitely use this again. Thanks!

these were really easy to make (if you like to fry food). want to try to bake instead. i don't think i got the right size biscuit dough because mine were very small - needed more filling. they cook really fast, so make sure you have all of them put together before you start

Heavy stuff!! Super tasty and I would make it again, but far better suited to an appetizer than as part of a main meal. We used the small cans of biscuit dough and hence, smaller circles of dough. I ate 1 and a half and then was done. It was so heavy and I can almost already feel my skin breaking out. HOWEVER, it is a FABULOUS recipe and tastes excellent. It is easy to prepare and the family loved it. Just keep in mind, these are deep fried and not terribly healthy.

I made this filling and mede my own dough for the outside...taken from the "PORK PICADILLO EMPANADAS WITH CHIPOTLE SALSA" recipe. it worked perfectly! my dad is from central america and he is devouring them as i write...needless to say they are a big hit. One suggestions: serve with home made salsa...just combine tomatoes, chopped onion, fresh cilntro, and fresh lime juice. salt and pepper to taste. its a fantastic side...i can eat it with just a spoon!

These are so good! The recipe makes a lot, and they're big, so be ready for a lot. If you have two sets of hands to prepare them -- one person to roll and stuff, another to finish and fry -- it goes much faster and is much more fun. I made up a little accompanying sauce to go with them, and it was a hit: some peach preserves, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire, etc. Yum!

This dish was easy to make and tasted great. My husband liked them so much he has requested them 5 times in two weeks. I served it with a spicy BBQ sauce for dipping.

this was my first experience with empanadas and i was impressed with the outcome. this recipe was fairly easy and delicious. will definitely make this again. i made this for my boyfriend and me and there is plenty of leftover filling, so i plan on preparing the empanadas and freezing what is left. hopefully they freeze well.

I prefer empanadas with flaky crusts, but this recipe is an easy, quick alternative. I don't think I will make it again b/c they make me want the other version. I would recommend it to someone who hasn't had ones with homemade crust or for kids.

These empanadas are always a hit, whether made full or half-size. I have found that they store and re-heat well.

These were very good! I used canola oil, but I bet you could bake these too.Notes: I add extra fresh ground black pepper and cajun seasoning (not cayenne)when I am spooning into the dough. Also, I add a pinch of cayenne to the turkey while I am cooking it (don't add it later, because it won't 'kick in' unless it's warm and moist-and careful, a little goes a long way!). I used Hungry Jack (10 oz. containers), just be sure to roll them out to about 5-6", and throw plenty filling in there, the dough is easy to work with. Lastly, instead of doing them all at once and putting on a baking sheet, I did one at a time, and fried them in an assembly line. That way, it's easy to adjust the cooking to get it just right (you can't fit them all in the fryer at once anyway!). Try sprinkling a little cajun seasoning (Emerils Original is best) on the empanadas right before throwing them in the fryer, it adds a little pizzaz, and flavor.

Served this at a Cajun themed dinner club. They were really good. Tasted just like the empanadas served at the Jazz Festival in New Orleans.

I took these to a Cajun party and got great reviews. However, the recipe says to fry them about 2 minutes per side-- NO WAY! It was more like 20 seconds. I found I could put them in the hot oil and then have to turn them right away because the raw dough on the top would puff up so drastically that they were difficult to fry all over once turned. Good, but don't cook 2 min per side, and be prepared for puffing.
