This was not the best potato bread recipe I have even made the first time around, but I did some tinkering and came up with a winner and here is what I recommend: omit the additional 1/4 cup water and add the second teaspoon yeast directly to the potato/water/yeast liquid. Increase the salt to 2.5 teaspoons. Use 1 cup whole wheat flour plus 5 to 6 cups bread flour. The addition of 1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary leaves really punches up the flavor. Bake as directed.

This is not the potato bread of your dreams. I would say an extra tsp of salt would help (1 tbsp seems like a bit too much), but something else feels missing. The dough is very wet following the directions, just keep adding flour while you turn it out. After the dough has risen turn out again adding flour until it looks like normal bread dough. Egg whites do not seem to do much for it. Olive oil with Rosemary or garlic powder would probably have been better. The instructions for how long to bake the bread should have been left as bake until done. The directions given are poorly worded. Just bake it until it is brown on the outside and sounds hollow when you tap it. For me this was 35 minutes total, 10 minutes at 500, 20 minutes at 400, and 5 minutes debating if it was done or not. Good bread just bland following the directions.

Maybe my taste buds are out of wack, but the 1 teaspoon of salt is definitely not nearly enough. The bread was very rustic looking, and I can tell that if I added more salt to the recipe, I would love it. Next time I'll try 1 Tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon.

Very good...I wanted it today, so just skipped turning the potatoes into starter and just added them straight to the yeast, which worked well. I just used 1/2 c water with 2 packages of yeast, added mashed potatoes (with butter, salt, and honey added in, so they were creamier), about 1.25 c of water from boiling potatoes, and enough flour to form dough, and got 2 nice, big loaves.

I started with less water as recommended by the previous reviews and added flour as needed. However, to use the amount of flour the recipe called for, I had to add the extra water. I made the recipe in the winter and we live in the midwest. Conditions are pretty dry during this time. It may have been a contributing factor.

The only caution I would give with this recipe is: Be careful not to rely on the water amount given. I think that trying 1 less cup of water would be a good guide;you can always ADD a little water; remember that there is water (to varying degrees)in the boiled russett potato. If you put too much water in at first, your dough will be too sticky to work with.

The raw dough was too sticky. After the 1st rising I couldn't handle it and had to add additional flour. Next time I would reduce the amount of potato/water mixture. Baked 1/2 in a standard loaf tin. Texture of finished bread was too wet. Made delicious toast but no real sour dough flavor.
