Oops, forgot - I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Delicious!

This was delicious! Really fresh and aromaticl. Tasted very "French". I didn't have shallots, so I used a leek and half of a small onion. I also used an extra garlic clove. Threw in about a teaspoon of dried tarragon while sautéing the veg, and then added the fresh parsley and chives at the end. The sherry vinegar gives it the perfect amount of acidity. A very nice change of pace from the usual soups that I make. Will definitely add this to my soup repertoire!

This is a wonderful soup recipe. The fresh herbs sprinkled on each serving is a brilliant touch - better than cheese even. However the instruction to parboil the kale was a dud. Without thinking I did this. I wound up fishing the kale out of the water with tongs and then pouring into the soup. Just put the picked-over kale in the soup!

I have made and taught a variation on this for several years, but I just add the kale to the sauteed vegetables and stock and liquid instead of cooking separately. I agree, the addition of bacon or panchetta or sausage can make a great variation for this dish.

Delicious, light and healthy. Added a little Tabasco and white pepper to give some pazazz. Definitely agree that the sherry vinegar really adds to the dish.

Yummo. Uzsd half shallots half onions, didn't have fresh herbs (but will next time), and it was still really great. Tasted like something we had in Tuscany - very light. Didn't have sherry vinegar so used red wine vinegar instead.

This is a delicious recipe exactly as written. Hearty and flavorful, with an unexpectedly deep flavor which I attribute to the sherry vinegar. Fresh tarragon also gives it a very fresh and vibrant flavor. It is absolutely not necessary to add meat, but if you did, I would saute bacon with the celery and shallots mixture.

I was out of vegetable stock, so made it with organic low sodium chicken broth. No fresh herb,either, so used dry ones instead. These substitutions worked really well. The soup had nice rich flavor. Only problem I had was a whiff of cheap white wine that I would get every now on then as I ate the soup. I may have reduced it a bit too much, or i should use a slightly better wine.

I've made this twice, and as such, I would give this about 2.5 forks as written. It definitely needs a little flavor. That said, the second time I made it, I gave up on vegetarianism and browned some leftover pancetta from another recipe - just three slices - and used low sodium chicken broth. I quadrupled (at least) the fresh herbs at the last, used dried thyme, and added some dried herbes de provence with the kale. I also drizzled a bit of truffle oil, as suggested, and topped with grated Parmesan. It was delicious tonight! With the substitutions, I would certainly make this again.

This is perfect as written. Don't add meat. I'm not a vegetarian but this stew lets the white beans and kale be the stars. We had a salad and crusty bread along with it and it was a perfect January meal. We'll probably make this just as often this summer.

Really good and quite filling! I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I used raspberry vinegar and it turned out fine. Only change I would make is to half the kale. A very yummy and healthy recipe!

Rating: 4
So good! I did a few things differently that undoubtedly added a lot of flavor. First, I started with browning sausage (no casing), removing, then following as planned. (added sausage back at kale stage). I also added a parm cheese rind, which really added a nice saltiness to it. Serve with crust of bread and it was fabulous!

This was really good. I made it with homemade chicken stock that I made earlier in the day and all dried herbs. I totally forgot to add the vinegar, but I don't think it missed it. We're still eating leftovers and it's super yummy.

We added an extra can of beans and some more seasonings. Lots of fresh herbs!

Delicious and pretty easy. My husband can't get enough. A few suggestions: -take out the thyme springs before you add the kale, otherwise it's a pain to find them -try rosemary or herbes de provence as your assorted chopped fresh herbs -use red kale. It has a better consistency, and you get purple broth

I only had modest expectations for this soup, but it exceeded them. It was much better than I expected. I didn't have any white wine in the house (the horror), so I deglazed with broth instead. There was a slight loss in depth of flavor, but not tragic. I also added some chicken andouille sausage I had on hand, and it went very well. All in all, a hearty, nutritious weeknight meal that I'll make again.

I made this last night to take to work for lunch. Halved the recipe for 3 servings which worked perfectly - it made almost exactly 6 cups. Didn't have veggie broth on hand and subbed chicken broth per other reviewers' suggestions - this was fine. Also, I had leeks I wanted to use from my CSA box, so chopped one and added it with the other aromatics. Finally, took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a link of browned chicken sausage, cut into chunks, at the end with the kale, which gives the stew a nice meatiness. Not the most WOW thing I've ever made, but a nice healthy fall/winter soup, for sure. A great change up from the usual chicken soup.

Cooking times not long enough to cook vegetables for my taste. Flavor ok, but I've had better -- from this site. Will not make again

I made this stew pretty much as it is written, except I added spicy turkey sausage which gave it a whole new level of flavor and heartiness. It was delicious and everyone in my family liked it. Goes really well with rosemary/olive oil crostini crackers!

This recipe is wonderful. I made the following variation: I roasted leftover bones/trim from a lamb shoulder roast until they carmelized. Then I added them to a pot of 2 pounds of dried large white lima beans, 2 tbsp salt and water to cover, and some parsley. I brought it to a simmer on the stove then cooked it 1 hour 20 minutes in a 250F oven, checking to add more water as necessary. Don't be afraid to cook dried new world beans with salt. They don't need any pre-soaking and they will come out creamy and perfectly seasoned from the oven with very little maintenance. I made the rest of the recipe per instructions, except when adding the beans I removed the remaining meat from the lamb bones and added it to the soup. Sherry vinegar is a nice touch, and I think it goes well with the tarragon.

Very good and surprisingly hearty soup. I've made this twice and my family loves it. Great way to serve extra greens and an excellent option for when my vegetarian sister visits.

I made this exactly as directed. Enjoyed it quite a bit, although the kale was fairly labor intensive. I can understand why other reviewers added sausage - it would provide a great counterpoint to the dish. I will definitely make it again.

This is really good - i made some changes. Instead of boiling the kale and dealing with an extra pot, i just threw it in with the beans and broth (also used about 1/2 the recommended amount). I used 2 large (about 1/2 pound) sweet italian sausage - removed from casing and browned in the beginning - removed with slotted spoon and added carrots, celery, and onions (instead of shallots). i put the garlic in towards the end so it didn't burn. I also used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and added a parmesan rind during simmering. i also simmered it covered so the liquid didn't evaporate. threw in the reserved sausage and served with crusty bread. easy and awesome.

This was a wonderful way to get my greens in. I was out of carrots, so left them out, and as other reviewers recommended, I added sausage...3 mild italian chicken. I also used a 1# bag of greens that included kale, collards, and mustard greens, stems included. They added a nice, slight crunch. It was creamy, flavorful, and will certainly be made again.

This was really good--very satisfying and tasty, and quite easy. we added whole wheat elbow pasta (1 cup) to make a complete meal as we had no bread on hand to go with this. Because my husband is iffy about totally vegetarian main dishes, we added 3 ounces of chorizo, diced, which gave this a rich full flavor without adding a lot of meat. I think we could have also used other types of sausage or even ham with the same effect. I also only had fresh parlesy on hand, so our herbs were limited to that, with dried thyme and bay leaves. I don't feel that this was a problem.

I will make this again. We love kale and this recipe let it shine. Used chicken broth rather than veg. Otherwise, stayed true to the recipe as written. The sherry vinegar is a must to cut the natural sweetness of the shallots/carrots.

Delicious! Made as directed...added 1 link of Italian mild sausage for my meat eating hubby. We both loved it! Served with crusty bread and Parm Reggiano on top, along with a beet salad. Yum! I might use a little less kale next time, but this is a keeper.

I'm always looking for hearty vegetarian dishes and hoped this recipe would be a good addition to my list. While this recipe is tasty, it lacks the robustness to be the satifying center of a veggie meal. A number of reviewers added sausage, which I think would be a great improvement, except that the result is not vegetarian. Definitely reduce the kale by half, as it will provide a better balance between all ingredients.

Rating: 3
Good recipe for a cold winter evening. I did add cooked, sliced Italian sweet sausage to make it a little more satisfying for my ravenous teenagers. The only change I would recommend is to use 1/2 to 3/4 of the kale called for in the recipe; kale doesn't have a lot of flavor, but visually and texture-wise, it somewhat overwhelms the dish. Tasted great with rustic toasted bread on the side, with thin slices of gruyere.

I Loved this recipe! I added: 1Tbs of white wine vinegar 2Tbs sherry a whole link of Hilshire Farms smoked Chipolte Sausage 2 extra cans of low sodium chicken broth. I will try the parm cheese next time though it did not seem to need a thing! Wonderful

This is a good soup, made great with the addition of the Sherry vinegar. And on the second (and third) day, it gets even better. A lovely mix of flavors and textures!

I followed the recipe exactly except for subbing a small onion for the shallots (I shopped from memory) but on the word of other reviewers added sliced roasted garlic chicken sausage. When I served, I drizzled the tiniest bit of white truffle oil and added a grating of good aged parm. It was heavenly, and even better for lunch this afternoon!

Fabulous hearty soup especially since kale is avaible at the farmer's market. I agree with the other reviewers in that crusty bread and Parmesan is a must. I'm making it again this week.

Nice hearty winter soup that eats like a vegetarian stew: the wine and the vinegar really make it distinctive. Nonethelss, something is missing. I definitely felt the grated Parm. cheese was a must. Next time I'll add sausage or pancetta.

We really loved this! Fresh and wintry, not too strong, but definitely not bland. I did add a little Parmesan to finish. Yummy yummy, though. Will definitely make again.

This soup is a good jumping off point. It's rich and hearty, but rather bland, so add whatever you want to make it more tasty! I added grated parmesan/pecorino, more garlic, paprika, truffle oil, and ALOT of salt and pepper. I'm hoping it'll taste better tonight, after a day for the flavors to meld. I also used a stick blender to make the soup smooth before adding the kale.

This soup was fantastic! Next time I may add some pancetta or bacon.
