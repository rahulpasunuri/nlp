I make this cheesecake every Thanksgiving and take it to the family dinner at my sister's house. Everyone loves it. I recently started using half of the almond paste, and it went over even better. This is a keeper!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. The combination of the almond-y cheesecake with the tender sweet spiced apples is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was done in the time specified. I didn't have any problems with cracking or with the texture. I would say a food processor is imperative here. The mixture was pretty thick and made my processor work hard, but it was worth it. Perhaps the only change I would make is to make more apple topping. I kept it on the side and we ran out about 3/4 through. I will make this again and again!

I'm absolutely in love with the FLAVOR in the first few bites; the "cinnamon-applyness" paired with the almond flavor and the graham cracker crust is fantastic... However, the TEXTURE is a little odd due to the almond paste in the batter, which almost makes it have the mouthfeel of ricotta cheese...like what you would expect in a stuffed pasta shell dish. I don't think this texture issue could be overcome by any amount of blending; it seems to be the nature of almond paste -- there are just teensy-tiny (imagine "microscopic") bits of almond that make it less than silky, as one would expect a cheesecake to be, which throws it off a bit. Next time, I would try almond extract.

Great recipe! Followed the advice of others and only used 1 tube of almond paste (trust me, 1 tube adds enough flavor to the cheesecake) and cut back to 3 apples for the topping. I also diced the apples instead of slicing them for ease of eating, and didn't use the 4th tablespoon of butter. I put the topping into a bowl next to the cheesecake and had folks top their own slice. I made four other pies and cheesecakes and this was the first dessert to disappear. Even my friends who don't like cheesecake tried it, and said it was yummy.

This cheesecake was pretty fabulous! I especially liked the almonds in the crust and the subtle almond flavor of the filling. Impressive -looking and really tasty, but best of all, very easy! I would definitely make this cheesecake again. I followed the recipe, but only used 1 package of almond paste and added a pinch of almond extract to the filling. Also, I only used 3 apples...perfect.

excellent marriage of apples and almonds.

I'm a professional chef and I've found that letting the cakes cool very slowly in the oven prevents cracking. You can tell it's done in the center when it's almost risen. I then turn the oven off for about a half hour, and then prop it open very slightly by putting a dry towel in the door. I then let the cake cool to room temp naturally and have always had great results. Yeah, it's time consuming. Quick note:if you don't have the time but need to "hide the crime" whip up a quick sour cream topping. About 1 1/2 cups sour cream, a tablespoon or two of white sugar, a splash of vanilla extract and a squeeze of lemon juice. Mix well, spread on top of half cooled cake and bake at 350 for about 10 minutes to set. Nobody will ever be the wiser, everyone loves that topping and then you can still proceed to add any other topping of your choice.

I only used the 8oz paste and it worked fine. However, it cracked while baking. I even put it in a water bath. Does anyone know how to prevent the cracking?

The cheesecake part was very good. I used one 8 ounce can of almond paste. The apples on top were overpowering. I took it to a family gathering. I saw people removing the apple topping.

Took it to a Christmas party - everyone loved it. I thought the texture was a little gritty.

For the person in Morocco. The following was from a newspaper article written by Ed Murrieta: Whey spend $10 for a tiny tube at the market when you can make your own for a fraction of the cost? Make almond paste: Equal amounts (by weight) of blanched dry almonds and confectioners' sugar, plus a sticky substance such as honey, corn syrup or simple syrup, or egg white. Combine the ground nuts and sugar. Stir in a moist sticky binder (less is needed if almonds are blanched fresh), then knead by hand until smooth. I would use a food processor to grind the nuts with some of the confectioners' sugar. I have yet to make this recipe but I plan to make my own almond paste to keep costs down.

I've made this cheesecake twice and everybody loves it! Excellent flavor and presentation.

The first time I made this cheesecake, it was a bit heavy on the almond paste, and the apples fell apart. The second time around, I used less almond paste, and made extra apples to arrange them properly. Definitely a winner! How can you go wrong by combining apple pie and cheesecake?

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving at my mother-in-law's last year to rave reviews! I plan on making it again this year, this is one recipe not to be ignored.

I made this for company last weekend and it was a hit. I halved the brown sugar in the apple recipe, and instead of white sugar in the cheesecake, I added brown sugar instead, and put in only 8 oz of the almond paste. I added the apples like a sauce on each slice of cheesecake and garnished each with toasted almond slices instead of making the spiral design on top. I don't make dessert very often, but this one will be an autumn favorite every year.

Not the best cheesecake in the world...quite dull actually. I thought it would taste wonderful but no. It looks nice but the crust is dry and when you serve this the next day, the sauce over the apples turns out to be weird....

To the person in Rabat; Coffee grinder might work, but could be hard on the machine, depending on what you've got. A mini food processor will do it and, tho not for the faint of heart, but maybe the best solution, a mortar and pestle. Why don't they have almond paste in Morocco?

Would love to try this but living in Morocco means no access to almond paste. We have almonds a-plenty though. Would grinding almonds in a coffee grinder work?

Made this for a function at work; have had 2 requests to make it again. Also used only 1 tube of the almond paste, but the second time I made it, I added just a little extra almond extract. PERFECT almond flavor. I do agree that 1-1/2 tubes may be too much. Also did not bother with the fancy arrangement on the apples. Just sauteed and put them on top. As fast as this got gobbled up, I don't think anyone would care or notice. This is one of the best cheesecakes ever. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you like almonds and apples, this is over-the-top for flavor!

I have made this cheesecake twice. Each time I received glowing reviews! I suggest using only one tube of the almond paste, rather than the 1.5 tubes that the recipe calls for.

I loved it (but I love almonds) and so did my guests. Hazelnuts work well in exchange for the almonds.

I have made this recipe twice, and each time it recieved rave reviews! I am not even and cheesecake lover, and I love it! I have been asked to make it again by many friends, and definetly have made it one of my signature desserts. One tip - make extra apples to go along side - they are so yummy and really make the cheesecake that much better!

I was told that this was one of my best cheesecake recipes ever. It was fantastic. I only used one tube of almond paste and whatever apples I had in the refrigerator. I would definitely make this one again.

This was well received at a recent dinner party. The presentation is lovely and the texture and flavor wonderful - it was also very easy to make. To make a petite version, I used a 6" springform and halved the recipe except for using one full tube of almond paste and cutting back on the cream cheese by a few tablespoons. Will definitely make again.

The presentation was beautiful. If you don't care for a strong almond taste, reduce the amount of paste. The almonds kind of overwhelmed the apples, but reduced, I would try it again.

Made this to bring to a dinner party. Wish I had read the reviews before baking it, though! It looked beautiful but the taste wasn't anything special. I'd pass on this one!

When I saw this recipe and photo I *had* to make this, and so it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. I liked this cheesecake but did not love it. I much prefer an apple frangipane tart which has better flavor and texture, I think. I agree that the apples are hard to cut if they are sliced as shown. Again, I did like this, but I don't think the cream cheese flavor and texture adds anything but distraction to otherwise wonderful pairings of apples and almonds.

This cheesecake was pretty but unless you are a real almond fan it will be too much for you. Just use the 7 oz. tube, its more then enough. I also think it would be better to dice the apples, I sliced and it makes the cake difficult to cut and eat.

My husband liked this more than I did. It is a very dense and almondy cheesecake. Very pretty. I just have other cheesecake recipes that I prefer

This recipe was easy and fun to prepare. My husband brought it to work and he said it was gone in matter of minutes. This is also a good recipe for kids to help with under adult supervision.
