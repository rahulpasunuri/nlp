This is the dressing we make to impress our guests. Not difficult to make and so delicious-- makes us look good every time. A winner.

Salad was good. I'd make it again - but alter the amount of sweetness. WAY TOO SWEET - for my taste. I used apple juice because I didn't have cider - that could've been my problem. It was more like a dessert. The gorgonzola helped cut through the sugary sweetness - next time I will cut back on the honey and use vinegar.

This is a GREAT recipe! It is the ONLY salad that my husband actually asks me to make. Regarding the spiced pecans, read the reviews:I do use just 1/2 cup water and then spread nuts over a baking sheet and bake at 350 for ~ 15-20 min instead of fry. Works great!

Wow. When I tasted it on my finger after I processed it, I thought it was okay. But tossed on red leaf lettuce with dried cranberries and blue cheese (what I had in the house) it was really delicious.

Sorry to say that I really didn't enjoy this dressing! After reading all the great reviews I expected to love it, but instead I found it WAY too sweet. I love the taste of roasted garlic but I could barely tell that there was a whole head of garlic in the dressing because the honey and apple cider flavor was too strong. I followed the recipe exactly and it dressed salads for 3 days for 2 people. By day 3 my husband was giving me the evil eye over the bowl of lettuce. I will not make this again.

This salad dressing is wonderful! I followed the dressing recipe exactly as is and I wouldnt change anything. I found that you can purchase a a 16oz container of Big B's apple cider from whole foods for less than $2. I have not tried apple juice to see if that would make a difference.

The dressing for this salad got raves from all of our guests, and although I doubled the recipe I wish I had made more for leftovers! Like other reviewers, I used the other, older spiced pecan recipe, and they came out crispy and delicous - a perfect mix of sweet and spicy. I've been snacking on them all week. WIll definely make this again.

This has been a hit every time I've made it, and I completely disagree that the nuts aren't worth the effort: I had people hovering over the leftover nuts, munching them down and begging for the recipe. I'm even making a batch as a gift for one addict. Great salad.

Rating: 3
I was slightly disappointed after reading all the rave reviews of this recipe. I liked it, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Keep in mind that the dressing, while tasty, is a little on the heavy side. It's creamy and it coats the lettuce leaves more than a traditional oil and vinegar based dressing. And it's flavor is stronger than most dressings so be careful what you serve with it or it can overpower your main course. All that being said, it is still tasty and I will probably make it again. But this time I will know what to expect.

This is amazing. Every time I make it people love it. Now I live in Canada from California and it is just as popular here. I usually add red, orange and yellow peppers and diced red onions

Wow, what a great dressing. This has become my standard and I have made it numerous times. I think the spiced pecans are not worth the effort but alternatives are endless. A handful of dried cherries go quite nicely.

YUMOLA! This is very tasty! I doubled the dressing just so that I'd have more on hand! If there is a Trader Joe's around - pick up their "Sweet and Spicy Pecans" instead of making your own. I added red onion, but everything else was as directed. Will definitely make again!

This is a delicious salad. The dressing is wonderful. I've made it for company and received a lot of compliments. I've prepared it exactly according to the recipe, and other times I've varied the types of lettuce and nuts, sometimes tossing in carrots or tomatoes as well, depending what I had on hand, but always including the gorgonzola. It's been great every time. I think the dressing is what makes the salad.

This dressing was one of my favorites I have found from this website. The flavors blended so well, and it was very healthy considering how creamy it was. I will absolutley make this again, it is going to be my new fall dressing, for sure...Although I did not love the pecans, maye extra cayenne and or\ salt? They were a little too sweet. I used a Maytag blue cheese intstead of Gorgonzola.

Wonderful flavors! I used a spring greens mix. The dressing, made as directed, is fantastic. Added dried cranberries and thinly sliced Macintosh apple (don't think I'd add apple again). The Spiced Pecans from Dec 90 are great. A hit with everyone.

This dressing was great! I liked the pecans but I don't think they added a whole lot overall. Next time I will just use plain toasted pecans or walnuts. Blue cheese works in place of the gorgonzola.

It is not very often I give 4 stars....but this salad was incredible. I made it with the spicy pecans and my guests were raving about the taste. I served it to 8 people....and that was plenty to go around. I made sure the cheese was at room temperature so it incorporated into the salad easily. Very impressive!

Wow! This salad is fantastic. I followed the directions for the dressing to the letter and was suitably impressed. I used another recipe for the pecans (from this website). They were a hit too!

This is my all-time favorite salad. Over the last two years, I have never served this salad that the recipe was not requested. The dressing is heavenly and the spiced pecans are a treat by themselves. When you put it all together, it's a tastebud explosion.

I never thought such a simple salad could be so delicious! I servd this for Christmas Eve dinner and this was a bigger hit than the main course! I used pre-packed mixed greens and store-bought glazed pecans. The dressing was a little work, but definitely worth it! The roasted garlic is so sweet and adds such depth and a rich consistency to the dressing, not much oil is needed at all. This recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 3
The dressing is delicious!!...I also made this for Thanksgiving, with toasted pecans (didn't have enough time to make the spiced ones) and gorgonzola. I used mixed baby greens rather than romaine as I prefer darker greens. I had enough dressing to serve at a luncheon the following week, and I used feta, toasted almond slivers and mandarin oranges for that one---I preferred the feta to the gorgonzola which I also felt was too strong. I'd still like to try the spiced pecans, but I think I'm the only one who would appreciate it in my family!

This salad is going to be a staple in my kitchen. I just made it for Thanksgiving, and we've been nibbling at it so much that it's going to be gone by the time our guests arrive. The spiced pecans are a bit of effort, but they're well worth it. The cayenne and paprika give the nuts a beautiful color, and the allspice makes them smell wonderful. Ten cloves of garlic may seem like a lot, but the dressing is not at all overwhelming, and the garlic is nicely balanced by the other flavors. I tasted the salad three ways-- with gorgonzola, chevre, or feta. The gorgonzola seemed too strong, and the chevre was the wrong texture, but the feta was absolutely perfect.

I enjoy trying recipes from this site and once again you have served up a dish fit for a King. My husband and I really enjoyed this salad is it a definite keeper! Unfortunately, I didn't have any apple cider on hand so I substituted a dry white wine. It worked just fine. And as for the spiced pecans - well all I can say is that we are lucky there was any left to go in the salad!

I use a blender for the dressing. It seems to make it a little thicker. It is an absolute delicious salad, and all my guests rave over it. I have substituted bleu cheese, and have added homemade croutons on occasion.

This salad was just great. The dressing was delicious, a new favorite, but I think it's best made shortly before eating, and served without being refrigerated. I used the linked recipe for spiced pecans and was never able to get the syrup hot enough. However, it worked fine by just boiling the syrup until it thickened some, mixing in the nuts and draining well, and then, because I don't like to deep fry, baking the nuts in a medium oven until they became dry and crispy. Fantastic on their own, and marvelous in the salad. Make extra!

This was the perfect salad with our beef tenderloin over the holiday. The vinaigrette had the perfect combination of sweetness and complexity. One thing I would recommend: don't drain the pecans on paper towels as suggested. They stuck and then we were forever ripping little pieces of paper off the pecans. I'd recommend draining them in a colander over a bowl instead.

I admit it. I needed an impressive salad but didn't have time to stick to this labor intensive recipe. First, I used the "Spiced Pecans" recipe from December 1990. No messy syrup or frying required. Also, I used substituted one large crushed garlic clove for the roasted garlic. I'm sure the roasted garlic would have given it a richer flavor, but I saved lots of time and everyone was suitably impressed with the salad.

I think this salad has more potential than our experience. I made the pecans, which I think "make" the salad, but on one try they turned out dark brown and mild in flavor. I have an Advantium oven in which I attempted to bake the garlic but I over cooked it and it turned out hard. I was out of garlic so I used it anyway and strained the the dressing before serving. Last mistake, I passed the dressing rather than tossing it with the romaine - it definitely needs to be tossed to coat the greens evenly and distribute the flavor. I sound inexperienced but I've been doing some fine cooking for 30 years!! Inspite of the first attempt results, I may try this again.

Delicious dressing! Living in Tokyo and not having an oven I've found it IS possible to roast garlic - very carefully - in a skillet!! For the pecans, try this: Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet, then add 1-1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and cayenne. Cook, not stirring, on med-high heat until sugar begins to melt. Reduce to low, stir and cook until sugar is golden brown. Cool on buttered foil, then break into pieces. So easy and good, you'll need extra for snacking!!

This was one of the best new salads I have tried in a long time. The pecan preparation almost kept me from trying this but it is worth the time and effort. Double the pecans and save half for next time. This was scrumptious!!!!

The combination of dressing, cheese and spiced pecans is excellent. I tried the pecans 3 ways: using the given recipe, both fried and baked, and using the 1990 spiced pecan recipe. The best were the fried ones, though it was more effort and difficult not to burn them. They were much crunchier than the same recipe baked. The 1990 recipe is also good, but I liked the candied feel of the other recipe.

Out of this world. I serve this salad when I really want to impress my guests. I use a simpler recipe for the spiced pecans (December 1990, Bon Appetit - this website) which I have a hard time resisting on their own. The quintessential gorgonzola and spiced pecan salad. And that dressing.....

I recently served this salad at a dinner party, and every single guest asked for the recipe. A huge hit! Everyone said the spiced pecans made the dish. In fact, I had the nuts sitting out in the kitchen prior to building the salad, and they (accidentally) proved to be the most popular appetizer. The nuts do take some effort, so I usually make at least a double batch every time. One word of advice: I find it takes almost 25 minutes on my stovetop to get the syrup to 220 -- and not the few minutes stated in the recipe.

Although the salad was tasty, I would not take the time to make again. I made this for a dinner party, and it wasn't as good as I asumed it would be. I am still on the look out for a knockout salad recipe, This one just did not add up to my expectations.

We really enjoyed this salad. My husband, who loves this cheeze felt that there was too much cheeze so next time I will probably not mix it into the salad but instead will just put it on top. The dressing is wonderful and the pecans also. Instead of frying the nuts I roasted them, watching very closely, at 350 for about 7 minutes. A couple of days later I used the left over pecans in a white tuna salad and they were a real hit. Will make again soon.

Wow! Very good salad dressing in thickness, color and flavor. I've made it a couple of times now. The pecans are a bit of work. Make them a day or two ahead.

A very good salad, with an interesting flavor combinations. Would definately make it again for something special, but it does take time. Highly recommend doing the nuts and dressing a day or two ahead of time.A couple of comments on the nuts: it took far more than the advertised 3 minutes (more like 30 minutes) to the pecan spiced sugar water get up to 220 degrees. Also, don't drain the fried nuts on paper towels, unless you like torn shreds of paper towel in your food (I learned the hard way). Instead, drain on cookie racks over aluminum foil, paper towels whatever. That said, the pecans are worth the effort. Also, instead of gorgonzola, I tried Saga Blue which is a triple cream blue (as long as we're being decadent...), and it was terrific.

OK, so I would eat gorgonzola sprinkled on old tires but I still think this salad is pretty terrific.

This recipe is a lot of work but worth it. I made it in stages, the pecans on day 1, the dressing on day 2 and assenbled it on Thanksgiving (day 3)Make a double batch because you will want to have an encore. We had none left over after serving 10 and there was nothing left on the salad plates, everyone loved it.

Very good. I also modified the recipe, using apple juice instead of cider (I didn't want to buy a whole bottle and had an apple juice box in the fridge). I used goat cheese instead of gorgonzola. My candy thermometer broke when I put it in the sink after carmelizing the pecans, so I wound up overheating the oil that they were to be fried in and burnt half of the pecans. I made another batch, but instead of following the instructions, I sauted the pecans with the spices and a small amount of water, then browned the pecans in the oven. They were delicious, we liked them better than the fried version. This salad was very popular and several guests asked for the recipe.

After reading the other reviews, I have one comment - DON'T OMIT THE PECANS! They were awesome although I will also add a little more cayenne next time. You only need to fry them for a minute or so but don't drain them on paper towels. They stuck to the paper. This salad has an incredible combination of flavors.

Wonderful,"a keeper" boast the foodies in deep east Texas! We did change the recipe by using field greens/spring mix and red tip lettuces instead of romaine. The pecans are really not to be missed and a little extra cayenne is there. The salad would also work with a good quality goat cheese too.

This was excellent, however, the pecans were alot of work for little results. I made it the first time following the recipe for the pecans. I made it the next time with another recipe with spiced pecans and felt it was easier and fewer steps involved. It was a great dressing. It would be good with grilled pears added. I definitely will be using this recipe again.

I am always looking for great salad dressing recipes and this one is by far one of the greatest that I have ever made. The flavor was so intense with the roasted garlic paired with the sweetness of honey. It was fabulous. The pecans didn't work out for me. I fried them for 2 minutes at the most and they burned. I would suggest gently lowering them in the hot oil and then immediately taking them out of the oil. 2 minutes was too long for me. The salad was still incredible, even with burnt pecans!
