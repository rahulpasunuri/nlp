I also found this recipe very boring, not even close to enough spices. I ended up adding more curry, chili powder, salt, pepper and lots of maggi just to enjoy it. Also, I would have left the chick peas whole instead of blending them, the stew was too thick, like eating baby food.

Really boring, bordering on bland, as it. It definitely needed some salt. All of my spices were fresh, so that wasn't it. Next time I would probably add a little lemongrass and/or soak the beans in something other than water, perhaps a hearty ale or low sodium broth. I would make it again, but ONLY after making some changes.
