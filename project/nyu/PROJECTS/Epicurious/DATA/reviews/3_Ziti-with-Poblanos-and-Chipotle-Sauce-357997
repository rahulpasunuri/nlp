As you can tell from the reviews, there is something simply "off" with this recipe. As much as we like the individual tastes, they simply don't add up. This is basically a pepper mixture that very well could be used to top grilled chicken. But as a pasta recipe, it just doesn't work (in fact, we abandoned the whole thing upon tasting the pepper mixture so we could save the meal and the pasta).

This was good but not something I'll keep in the regular rotation. I enjoyed the smoky chipotle flavor and the slow cooked onions but my boyfriend thought something tasted a bit off and didn't go for seconds (a sure sign he didn't like it very much).

The flavor in this dish was decent but it has way too much sour cream. My husband and I found it too heavy and I ended up throwing it away. Blending the chipotle chilis with some olive oil and a bit of the pasta water would have been better for us.

Love the mexican flavors in this dish. Have made it twice, but with improvements: roasted the poblanos along with the red peppers, carmelized the onions, and added fire-roasted tomatoes and asiago to the sauce.

I subbed the poblanos with NM Roasted Hatch Green Chiles. Added chicken, garlic, and diced tomatoes. Left out the roasted red peppers. DELICIOUS! Chicken could be subbed with zucchini for a vegetarian option....YUMMY!

I am generally very easy to please, and almost always rate things in the four star range. This was ridiculous. The poblanos I got were admittedly very spicy, which was part of the main problem- the recipe is certainly not to blame for that. But it was boring, and bland on top of the painful, searing spiciness. I am Mexican, and can stand quite a kick in my food. I was really excited about this, because I love all the ingredients it calls for. But boo. This was a waste of good ingredients and a disappointment.

Really tasty dish and amazingly simple. The only substitutions we made were using whole wheat penne instead of ziti, and we used low fat sour cream. A keeper!

Amazing recipe! Followed the directions with great end result. Recipe was easy to follow and manage, and pasta had lots of flavor. Definitely recommend to others and will make again.

I followed the recipe to a 'T' and must disagree with others. This was bland, boring and tasteless for the most part. It was spicy, but lacked any other flavor. Extra salt helped, but it was still like plain, flavorless pasta. I mixed in some shredded cheddar with the final toss, and it made the dish edible, but nothing to write home to Mom about. I did set aside some of the sauce and topped some grilled chicken breasts with it, for my husband who is on a low carb diet. He said it was pretty good that way. I may make the sauce again to use as a topping for grilled chicken or beef fajitas, but will NOT be making it with pasta again.

I really enjoyed this meal. The flavors are rich and bold. I seasoned to taste and be careful with the adobo sauce.

Careful with the spice of your poblanos (can vary widely) and the amount of chipotle/adobo you put in - that can quickly ratchet up the heat. We used homemade pasta instead of the ziti and it was phenomenal. We've recommended it again and again, always a hit.

Sorry, my last post I meant to say green pepper.

I made this exactly as the directions stated. My husband loved it and told me it is a "keeper". It was a bit too bold for my taste, so I think next time I may use half the poblano and instead use green onion.

My husband and I thought this was great. I added lardons, which was a nice addition. I will definitely make this again.

When i saw the date on this recipe (June 2010), I was very confused - has Gourmet come back from the dead? After a bit of research, it appears that this recipe is actually from the June 2008 issue. RIP Gourmet.
