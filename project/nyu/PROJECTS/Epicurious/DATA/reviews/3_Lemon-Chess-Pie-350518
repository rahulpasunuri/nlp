It is just like a lemon bar. I made it for my guy ( who adores pie and lemons) and he loved it. I followed previous rule to let eggs and cold items room temp before making it. It was still soft pie but not runny or inedible.

What's not to love? Lemon, sugar and eggs. This is very traditional -- what I group up on in the South. My mamma always put a touch of sifted powdered sugar on top and a little grated lemon peel for color which helps with the presentation. I just made a couple of these pies for my Yankee in-laws and they went crazy over them. Making one again tomorrow for a dinner party.

Jean Anderson has given us another outstanding Chess Pie. Her recipe in in the Doubleday Cookbook was good. I have an old recipe from Bon Appetit that she contributed that took Chess Pie to a new level but this is the best yet. Easy and dependable results. (Most cooks estimate 1/4 c. juice per lemon and 1 TBSP zest per lemon). I used the juice of 3 Meyer lemons and the zest of 4 lemons just to give it the extra lemony pop. Baked the pie in a half baked pie crust for a crispy pie crust and this got raves from the lemon lovers in my family.

I followed the advice to have all ingredients at room temperature and mixed everything up in the food processor. The pie could not have been simpler to make and was the dessert hit of the evening at the party I brought it to--perfect texture, wonderful lemon flavor. No one believed me when I told them how easy it was to make.

Made this pie according to recipe, took it to a picnic, set it on the dessert table and it quickly disappeared. Received many compliments and high-fives from my chess-loving pie friends. Making another one today for the tailgate party. If you don't like lemon, don't make a lemon chess pie. And follow the advice of one of the reviewers who tells you everything must be at room temp.

I have not made this pie but it is absolutely essential when making a chess pie that all ingredients, and especially the eggs, be at room temperature before you start. This is probably why some have had problems with this recipe.

I didn't bother to read the reviews before I made this and assumed I had undercooked when I went to cut it. The recipe as it is tastes great (like a lemon bar indeed) but it doesn't make for a pretty presentation. I even tried to preheat the baking sheet before I put the pie in the oven.

There is a major flaw to this recipe. The lack of specific liquid measurement is a problem. "The juice of 3 large lemons" not good. Pie never sets up as another reviewer stated.

I made this for Thanksgiving, thinking it would be similar to the chess pie I had as a child. Unfortunately, this just tasted like a nice lemon bar that you make from a box. The recipie calls for way too much lemon zest, if you leave some out it might be good for a casual get together, but definately not for a holiday.

This pie looks pretty and tastes very lemony, but it doesn't hold together. Warm or cold, it's like lemon curd that never sets up - can't be cut and served. Bring a spoon! Is there an ingredient missing?

I was looking for a pie recipe for my contribution to take to the church potluck and let me say that I am so glad I "took a leap of faith" and doubled the recipe and made two pies as this was the big hit of the evening. Made the food processor version and it was as easy as pie. Didn't have 6 lemons so used the four I had and enough bottled lemon juice to make up the difference. I guess that since every bit of the zest made it into the pie (nothing flying around the kitchen or sticking in the holes of the grater!) the lemon flavor was very intense. Thank you for making me look like a domestic goddess. This is a hit and has gone into the "repeat" folder.
