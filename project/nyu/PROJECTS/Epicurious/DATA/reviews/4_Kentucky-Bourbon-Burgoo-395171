Ok raging I didn't check in first. Now the meat is in the pot and I didn't sear it but the receipe did not call for that. Think I'm going to skip the green peppers. funny the receipe didn't call for any herbs salt and pepper to the meat while it's in the pot. Ok can someone tell me what is 2 Pods Red Pepper. The manager at supermarket never heard of it and I check in the herb section no Pods. Are these the inside of a red pepper does anyone know?

arcs, here is a web site devoted to burgoo: www. burgoo. info. Burgoo is defined as "a soup or stew made from meats and vegetables". Different regions and different cooks have their own recipes. There is no one burgoo.

Vegetable soup has carrots, green pepper, okra, lima beans, and celery. Burgoo does not.

Would you not want to seer the meats first? I agree with the omitting of the green peppers. Season & seer the meat, deglaze the pan with the bourbon omitt the green peppers an continue with the recipe.

reading this, it sounds great with the exception of the green pepper which seems to have been dragged in out of left field - just does not 'fit' with the rest of the ingredients ...

I would think anything with 12 pounds of meat and potentially 6 pounds of veggies in it would, even if you eventually take the meat off the bone, would serve way more than 14 people.
