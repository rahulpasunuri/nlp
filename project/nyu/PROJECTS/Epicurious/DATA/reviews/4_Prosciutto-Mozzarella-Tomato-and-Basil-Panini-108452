This is a great sandwich and has become a family tradition! I would not change anything...great use for our George Foreman grill.

This is a fantastic sandwich. Made as directed, except instead of pouring the dressing over the top, I brushed it on both insides of the bread, go heavy on the dressing too, it is tasty!

Made this per the recipe but did not use all of the dressing as it would've been too oily. It was a good sandwich but definitely not 4 forks.

This has become a family and friend favorite. We have used chicken instead of prosciutto for those who are on a low sodium diet. I grate fresh Parmesan cheese into the sauce. We will make these for years to come.

This is the best recipe! I not only use prosciutto but also calabrese and homemade copa. I use more balsamic vinegar for more flavor.

This was a fantastic sandwich! My lunch guests loved it. I plan on making it many more times. Mmmmmm

Really delicious sandwich, and incredibly easy to make. One thing I discovered is that the ciabatta bread didn't quite have enough thickness to hold up to the dressing. A slightly denser bread (focaccia maybe) might work better. Otherwise, fantastic!

Made this sandwich yesterday to take along on a boat ride with friends and it was awesome!! I grilled it before leaving the house, wrapped it in foil and brought it in the cooler. We sliced it and ate it after an hour on the boat and it was great - the dressing really added a nice flavor and the sandwich held up really well for the trip - which sometimes isn't easy on a boat trip. Will definately make this again - for a picnic, or even just an afternoon at home.

Mmmm. Fantastic! Delicious! A keeper for sure! Even with winter tomatoes and basil, this recipe still manages to make the flavours shine! I don't think I should have added salt though. The prosciutto probably has enough in it - it was kinda salty. But mmm!

Made this last evening for dinner and it was outstanding. Followed the recipe exactly. The fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden gave off the perfect blends to the taste buds. Almost as good as the panini we ate in Rome, Italy. Definitely a keeper. Added the fresh asparagus salad (found on this site) as a side.

Makes a very simple, fast lunch. Used purple basil from my garden, quality tom's from the grocery store and Speck from Trader Joe's. Unfortunately we don't have good bread here in Florida so I used a french loaf from the grocery as well. Followed the recipe for the dressing but used the grocery store balsamic recommended by Americas Test Kitchen - Quality makes a difference. Put the sandwich on the grill of 3-4 minutes each side using my LeCreuset skillet as a weight. Worked perfectly. Surprised my SO who was working hard in the yard. I'll make these often and won't hesitate to make them for company.

Absolutely delicious. I only used a fraction of the prosciutto called for--maybe 2-3 ounces of the REALLY GOOD imported kind that's $24/lb. We're going to do this at least once a week while our summer tomatoes are coming in!

Delicious! Would recommend cutting the dressing in half as had quite a bit left over. Grilled on my panini grill and was loved by my book club!

Loved this recipe. Quick and easy weeknight meal. Served with baked sweet potato fries with garlic mayo. WIll definitely make this again.

This is very good. I have made sandwiches like this for years using pesto instead of the dressing and a good Tuscan-style bread in place of ciabatta. Also can be "toasted" in the oven or grilled in a pan. Either way we love it for a quick weekday meal.

Very good and easy. I was out of basil so I tried pesto. It worked very well.

Great for a fast meal on a busy day. In a pinch my George Forman Grill filled in for the panini grill that I have yet to get. I brushed the top and bottom of the bread with a garlic infused oil to add taste and a golden crust. Delicious.

This sandwich is delicious and just what you want from an Italian sandwich (coming from an Italian!). I always make it on a baguette instead of ciabatta bread. I made this for a picnic w/ my hubby in Calistoga, CA - it was the perfect lunch!

Ok. I used white balsamic, more garlic, combination of cheeses. Come on guys--almost everyone changed the recipe somewhat to suit their needs. So what's the argument with Sitka? Gheez!

Have made this 4 times, not as good as other reviews. Better with thin ham, did not care for the dressing, chedder is a better cheese, however i will try other variations.

I love it! I used white balsamic, and Il Fornaio sandwich rolls from Trader Joe's. This is simple, fast, delicious and satisfying without being too heavy. Although I'm not sure I'd call it healthy :) This will be a new staple, for sure!

RE: Sitka, Alaska. I agree with the cook from Philly. Don't rate a recipe you haven't made. It doesn't even closely resemble the original!

Yum!! Made exactly as written using a stove top grill pan with a grill press. Perfect sandwich for watching the football game!!

Re: Sitka Alaska When you change the main ingredients of a given recipe you are no longer making that recipe and therefore should not rate it!

These panini are soooo good! Instead of use fresh tomato, I sliced it then roasted the slices with slivered basil, olive oil, salt and pepper. I sometimes find that fresh tomatoes can be watery and make the panini soggy. Made them in a grill pan and weighted them down with a cast iron skillet. I loved them!

This is my favorite sandwich recipe and I make it often. I prefer to leave out the prosciutto but make no other changes.

I had neither prosciutto nor mozzarella on hand , but Smithfield ham and Tillamook cheddar filled in nicely. Today being winter solstice, I settled for a store-bought roma tomato.

Made these for an 18-hr road trip. Used garlic wraps instead of paninis. Kept well in a cooler and satisfying but not too filling.

Move over Europa Cafe. This tastes as good as panini in NYC. Panne Provincio Ciabatta Sandwich Rolls and Sunset Campari tomatoes on the vine (both from Costso in Clifton, NJ) and fresh mozzarella from our local grocery's deli combined perfectly with fresh basil growing in my wheelbarrow. I used a thin slice of prosciutto for each sandwich, but my husband and I agree the meat was barely perceptible and could be omitted for a great vegetarian dish. The dressing makes the sandwich; I doubled the garlic. I grilled the panini on a nonstick grill with a top that allows both sides to cook at once. When fresh tomatoes ripen in the land of snow, I intend to make these at least once a week. Until then the Campari tomatoes will suffice just fine. Try this fabulous dish!

We tried this tonight and it was very good! Next time I'll use Jersey ripe tomatoes for better taste. I didn't use the ciabetta bread, instead it was a country sliced Italian that was delicious. My husband loved it! Great way to use fresh basil from the garden too! Served with the spicy cucumber avocado soup from this site.

Used ciabatta rolls and grilled on a stovetop grill pan. Would have been better with a real sandwich press. Good flavors! Definitely need to use a high-quality fresh tomato.

Rating: 4
A fabulous combination of flavours. I would heartily reccomend this recipe. A good quality panini grill makes a big difference. I've found that the following changes add to the recipe: 1.A three-meat combination: Prosciutto,Lean Capicollo, and a Prosciutto Salami. 2.A blend of smoked mozarella and fresh bocconcini cheeses instead of normal mozzarella. 3.A drizzle of fresh lemon juice onto the sliced half of cibatta bread before assembling the sandwich...the tartness of the lemon complements the olive oil in the dressing.

Wow! These were really fantastic. Used fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella with excellent proscuitto on plain, sliced foccia bread. Grilled nicely. Guests really raved over these. Fantastic!

Absolutely fantastic and simple recipe. I made this for me and my wife on our anniversary to have a more interesting than normal sandwich for lunch. This goes way beyond that. It's fantastic...but it definitely relies on the quality of the ingredients. Fresh tomatoes and basil and high quality meat is essential. I made it in the frying pan with some store bought sliced nutty oat bread (Why not oatty nut bread?). I didn't use near as much of the dressing as recommended. I put a bit on the sandwich and used a dab to grease the pan for grilling. Magnifique!

We set up a panini bar. Different meats and condoments. We also put the panini press right on the table so we could all grill our own sandwiches.

I made this with Prosciutto di San Daniele, tomatoes from a neighbor's garden, basil from my own garden, and freshly made mozzarella. Absolutely delicious and so easy! It tasted like the sandwiches I had in Italy. I lightly toasted the bread before assembling the sandwich, because the tomatoes were very watery.

I made this sandwich to bring to the Hollywood Bowl for our picnic and it was amazing! I melted the cheese in our toaster oven at 400 degrees before we left and they were still a bit warm when we actually ate them. Fantastic! I felt like making it again the next day! I used Rosemary focaccia bread instead of what they suggested in the recipe and it was brilliant!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Used what we had on hand and it worked beautifully -- Trader Joe's Tomato/Olive focaccia bread, then whisked Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette with the Olive Oil to drizzle on. Didn't have prosciutto so made it without it. Simply baked it at 400-degrees for about 5 minutes. Great, fast, easy and beautiful presentation.

This recipe is a testament to how a few top-quality ingredients easily thrown together can create something spectacular. I made this recipe, as stated, for a dinner party's appetizer course. I cut the panini's into quarters. They were fantastic. The next day we made them again, subsituting Fontina and Newman's Own Parmesan Garlic dressing for the cheese and vinegar in the recipe....they were almost better than the original. This is my new favorite sandwich I will repeat over and over.

Great recipe! This is now known as "The Sandwich" in our house! Since we have a gas grill, we can have anytime we can get decent tomatoes. Using good tongs to turn each sandwhich is the trick.

Heavenly! Make sure the prosciutto is VERY thinly sliced. I've cheated with foccaccia as well and it's great. The avocado suggestion is a good one too.

This is awesome! I even found big, fresh basil @ Trader Joes. Also, being it's winter, I merely baked it, in foil, for 1/2 hour @ 400. Smushing it about 1/2 way through. Definately a new item on my list.

Made this for a ladies lunch and it was fabulous. I added avocado and used Foccacia with stuff on it as I couldn't find the ciabatta. The recipe got raves!

Excellent, easy dish! I added a few pieces of provolone to make it "gooey" and pressed it in a skillet with a saucepan. I dressed a mesclun salad with the extra vinaigrette and served with a side of breaded, fried zucchini for a simple summer get together.

Made this for my husband and I. Easy and delicious! Make sure to use fresh, ripe tomatoes.
