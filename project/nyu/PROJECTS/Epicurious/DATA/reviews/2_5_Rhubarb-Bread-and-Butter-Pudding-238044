I have made the entire menu by Darina, 3 times now. The bread and butter pudding is entirely under rated. It is so good. In fact, I had a guest last night say, Oh, No, I don't eat bread pudding. Tried a bite, then had 2 more servings. Admitted he was wrong, not an easy feat for him. I used Artisnal Sourdough, and added some strawberries as well this go. So good!

I just made this but used mixed berries and only 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and it was super yummy!

I decided to make this (with modifications, so sorry for the length) for my husband despite the reviews. Since I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, I wasn't expecting much. It turned out great! I've made it two weekends in a row, we enjoyed it so much. 1st change was to substitute strawberries for the rhubarb - couldn't find any rhubarb. One lb. of berries was enough to set 6 aside for my daughter's lunch and slice the rest for the layers and garnish. I tossed the sliced berries with a scant Tbs. of sugar and set them aside while doing the rest of the prep. I've used fresh bakery white bread and english muffin bread and thought both had enough body to stand up to the custard. For the custard, I used 5 large eggs rather than 4 extra large and only 3/4 cup sugar. I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The 1st time I misread the recipe and just used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk. I had bought a pint of heavy cream and was fixated on having a cup left over to whip for garnish, I guess. I wonder if the 2 cups of cream in the custard is a typo, because I'm sure that would make for one soupy pudding. The assembled dessert soaked in the frig for about 1hr with the white bread and 3hr with the english muffin bread and the finished texture was about the same, soft but held together when warm, firm but tender out of the frig the next day. I'm anxious to try this with the original rhubarb as well as with pears and blueberries. I think the layering of whole slices of bread with fruit is a nice look.

This recipe is incorrect and the method is wrong. You need young, fresh rhubarb. The bread needs to be 2-3 days old, not soft and fresh. The need to macerate the rhubarb with 2 tablespoons of sugar in a cool place overnight. Cooking time should be about 45 minutes. If you follow the recipe as shown, and put too much sugar and cook for an hour you will get what others have found.....a great sloppy mess! I am Scottish, and my grandmother baked this dish to perfection!

Contrary to what other said, this worked really well for me. It was a hit at my party and it's now one of my favorite desserts. I wish I would have cut the rhubarb a little smaller than 1" cubes. I let the rhubarb sit in about 1cup of sugar for over an hour, but I wish I would have cooked it a little bit to make it less bitter. Thanks to some comments I used what I thought would be an absorant bread (sourdough batard). Yummy!

I made this recipe because I love rhubarb and I love bread pudding, unfortunately I was very disappointed with the texture. I followed this to the letter, using approx 3-4 T sugar to macerate the rhubarb, and though it tasted okay mine was kind of a soupy mess as well. There is either something off with the proportion of the ingredients, or the cook time.

It would have been helpful to provide cooking time when using 8" round pan and/or if pudding was in the refrigerator. As it was I had a sloppy mess after baking for one hour.
