I would have given this 4 forks but there was too much oil/balsamic mixture and it detracted from the spinach and overall outcome. The fish, tapenade and salad are GREAT and it has company worthy presentation. Less oil mixture next time.

This recipe has a few interesting things going on, but it's kind of a train-wreck: too many competing flavors. The spinach dominates the dish - I'd probably go with a milder green like a chard. The vinaigrette is out of place as well - too astringent. The radish chive salad is very interesting, but competes with the spinach. I think it would be nice with a white wine/garlic/butter reduction and maybe skip the greens alltogeather.

Terrific recipe -- it was very different from anything I would make and therefore welcome! I used frozen spinach and it was great. Also used prepared green olive tapenade from Trader Joe's on top and it was wonderful. Recommend not altering the recipe at all, the ingredients sound strange but it all works out well.

This was OK, but not spectacular. There was too much going on--the fish AND the spinach AND the tapenade AND the salad...too busy!

My Girlfriend and I thought this was great, in fact she thought it was the best fish recipe we ever had. She is not the biggest fish lover so for me that is a pretty great thing.The flavors do blend perfectly. I think this recipe will now go on high rotation with us.

This recipe is wonderful--takes very little time and produces maximum results! My husband thought he was at a restaurant. I think for a simple dish like this, really fresh fish is crucial.

My husbsnd and I love this tasty preparation of Red Snapper. With very little of the green olive tapenade (a July 1993 Bon Appetit recipe)on top and very little sauce, my kids enjoy the dish as well.

Great combination of flavors -- salty tapenade with sweet and tangy balsamic, but neither overpower the taste of the snapper. If snapper is hard to find (or unavailable), I use halibut. Dinner guests can't say enough about this dish and cooking time is only 6 minutes!
