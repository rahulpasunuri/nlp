This was easy to make and delicious. I served it with roasted Brussels sprouts and lemon slices alongside oven roasted potatoes to sop up the juice from the meat. Everything cooked in cast iron skillets in the same hot oven in less than 45 minutes.

I took hgipperich's advice and only used a tbsp of (raw) sugar. The result was fantastic and my wife loved the dish.

I used 1 tbsp of sugar instead of the ¼ cup listed. Great flavor! I served it with rice pilaf and grilled asparagus. My dinner guest practically licked her plate clean.

I don't ever know what to do with beef - and this recipe helped me get it right. I was surprised by how tender the meat was - how flavorful. Usually red meat is so rich I can only eat a bite or two and then I'm overpowered, but this was light and tasty even though it was rich. I ate my whole serving! Also - nice that it was low fat!

This recipe was amazing! It had so much flavor. I was really skeptical at first, because I'm not really crazy about cumin, but it turned out really well and I can't wait to make it again!

We love Moroccan and Indian food-this was yummy. Had rubbed the beef and skewered chunks with red pepper and onion but didnt cook it til a day later. Flavors penetrated the beef, and we only cooked the skewers for a few minutes as we like our beef rare. I would use way less black pepper-overpowered the other spices and I like a grating of cinammon in mine-less sugar. Served with yogurt mint sauce. Yum.

My family really liked the rub. It is an easy way to cook tenderloin and ensure a crisp crust. I will try some of the other versions in the future, but the cumin flavor is one that we will surely try again.

The rub is great and very versatile as is. I have never tried it on beef, but it is great on thinly sliced boneless porkloin. Just be careful not to overcook the pork as it will dry out very quickly. I made a banana-orange compote with some sugar and cloves that nicely complimented the sugar-spice rubbed pork.

I made it as written (the Moroccan version) and was generally very pleased. The result was very flavorful but a bit sweet for my taste. When I make it again, I'll cut back on the sugar.

Since I didn't like the Moroccan spices and could not find Lavender on the shelf at the supermarket, I substituted and used Rosemary, Sage and Thyme... close enough for Provençal/Mediteranian. It worked fine. Served a Cotes de Rhone wine for a nice herbal match.

I enjoyed the "Tuscan" version much more than the standard recipe. A nice, easy dish overall.
