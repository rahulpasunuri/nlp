If you read every positive review here, you'll see that they heavily modified the recipe. My girlfriend and I stuck to the recipe as presented, and all I can say is that we're never making this again. Where do I begin... the consistency was thick, but not in a good way. It was very lumpy. The onions overpowered almost everything else, and the main thing you get out of this is an inedible, bitter flavor that brings no satisfaction. I actually created my profile just to warn people of this poor recipe. These positive reviews are very misleading.

This is the best potato soup recipe I have ever found. I think that the instruction to let it simmer for 5 minutes might be a typo...I do let it simmer for 35 to 45 minutes. I follow it exactly otherwise and it's superb!

too much onion for me...

As is this recipe makes a flavorless gluey mess. I can see replacing the flour and water to cut down on the paste effect, but it is still way too lacking in flavor. Too many other good potato soup recipes on this site to mess with this one. The only benefit I can see to it is that it s fast.

I made this recipe and it somehow turned out wonderfully!! The wine adds a nice flavor :) Definately a keeper!

I used all broth and omitted water. Also, because I was serving to suspicious children, I omitted chives. The recipe was very well received by all ages. It was a warm, filling recipe that will make excellent leftovers for a cold winter day.

Used part Swiss part cheddar, salt and pepper to taste, milk at the end to thin it out and red pepper flakes. Pureed about half in food processor and a dollop of sour cream on top and it was fantastic!

Wonderful flavor and VERY richly filling. I used all chicken broth and the potatoes took the normal 12-15 minutes to cook. I pureed the soup (wit a submersible blender) and added some milk as it was too thick. I served this as a first course but it would make a nice dinner entree as well.

Thanks to everyone's comments, this was a successful meal for us- with the addition of a carrot, a celery stalk, garlic salt, course ground black pepper and fresh Italian leaf parsley. Left out the chive (didn't have any). Also used a wand blender to purify (but not completely- left a few pieces). Used a bit of sour cream with the bacon garnish, and added pine nuts! SO GOOD!

As someone who will eat almost anything, I found this recipe almost inedible. The onion and sharp cheese were way too strong even though I didn't add all of it. I was glad I left out the chives. Others have suggested omitting the onions and adding extra broth. That might help.

This was just OK. For the amount of cheese in the recipe (and calories!) I was expecting more. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception I added the wine too early - I think it may have made my potatoes stay hard. I would suggest adding more seasoning - seemed pretty bland. However, my husband liked this.

This was a really good, very speedy soup. The cheddar added enough kick to overcome the simplicity of the potatoes, water, and flour. I was worried I'd have to add a splash of cream or half and half to increase the flavor, but it was creamy enough from the cheese that it tasted like I was eating a soup with a dairy base, but not as gross and fatty. I used prosciutto instead of bacon, which hopefully cut down on the calories even more, and when I realized I was out of chives I used a generous sprinkle of garlic powder. Delicious!

MMMmmm tasty. My husband and I make this every fall & winter when the weather starts to get chilly. It's relatively easy to make and doesn't take hours of stewing or waiting. We've made it several times and every time serve it with fresh baked corn muffins.

Overall, this was a good soup. I skipped the water & flour, as well as the wine (didn't have any), instead substituting 4 cups of chicken stock. I could have cooked the onions longer before adding the potatoes, but I was impatient. It was a hit with my girlfriend, though!

Rating: 1
Almost inedible in my opinion. Odd texture (pieces of potato just floating in broth) and the cheese didn't work. I tried putting it in the blender and the consistency was much better, but the taste wasn't helped. Blending seemed to make the onions far more potent and, even as someone who LOVES onions, I thought it was revolting. I've made tons of recipes from Epicurious and this is the only one I wouldn't make again.

This wasn't great, despite all the other reviews. It lacked something, spicy heat maybe. Not a repeat for us.

I omitted the onions altogether, and this soup turned out WAY too thick. If you're going to leave out onion, make sure you double the amount of broth. Also, I added about 2 tbsp of chopped parsley and 1 tsp of thyme which really gave the soup some added flavor.

Rating: 3
This is a great easy recipe. I did make a couple of changes. I used 1/2 onion and 1 lg. leek. I also added 1 1/2 cup warmed 1/2 and 1/2 before I added the cheese. Next time I make this I will use the wand blender to mash the potatoes.

This is a filling soup to have on a winter week night. I'm a vegetarian so I fry veg bacon for the topping--it tastes great and reduces the fat/cholesterol a bit.

I had to make a lot of changes to the recipe but the result was fantastic. Here are the changes I made: 5 slice slice of bacon 1 large red o nion about 2 cups of chicken broth 1/4 cup of dry white wine 1/4 cup of half and half or heavy cream Ditto for using good quality, sharp cheddar 2 cloves minced garlic pepper to taste

I liked this pretty well, but my daughter said it tasted too much like onion soup to her. probably won't make again.

Wonderful recipe! I added at few things to my pot; carrots, celery, and garlic. When everything was nice and tender, I pureed 1/4-1/2 of the soup with a wand blender to thicken it therefore I didn't add the butter/flour combo. At the end I added 1 cup chopped kale for great color and texture. Topped with bacon at the table--I can't wait to make this again!

Highly recommend use of small yukon gold potatoes instead, along with heavy cream, kosher salt, fresh parsley, white pepper, garlic, & red onion; skip the flour

This was fantastic. I made this recipe exactly as written, but halved. If you prepare this recipe you can safely follow the directions with one crucial exception, and it's an important one. As written this recipe adds raw potatoes in the last 6 minutes of cooking or "till tender". The "till tender thing" is probably going to be at least 20 minutes, depending on a) your dice and b) your potato. I don't know of a starch on the planet that can convert in 6 minutes (outside of a pressure cooker). Tastes great as written, easily adaptable, and simple! 4 Enthusiastic Forks.

Made this again for the first time in a long time. I'm still happy with the recipe as is, except for running a Braun blender in it briefly to puree a bit more. I have 3 or 4 potato soup recipes - for ease, taste, and on-hand ingredients, this is still my favorite!

I really like this soup, but I strongly caution against using the flour to thicken the soup. As many others have suggested, simply add more potatoes and mash them a bit (I do it right in the pot while it is cooking) to desired thickness. Adding a dash of heavy cream, garlic, and leeks is also a good idea. Replace the water with stock too. Also, use the best cheddar cheese you can find. It really makes a difference in the flavor.

This soup was just "ok," not great by any means. The "Cheese and Potato Soup" on this website is much, much better than this.

This potato soup was awesome. Nice on a cold fall night and you don't even have to make anything to accompany it, it is filling on its own. My husband loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!

I started out making this exactly according to the recipe, but when it was done, it was sort of bland. So I blended it with a stick blender, and mixed in salt and pepper, some garlic-pepper seasoning, about a teaspoon of tabasco, and a scoop of sour cream. That did the trick. Delicious.

Good soup---followed the previous reviews & mashed the potatoes. I just used my masher and mashed them right in the pot as it was cooking. Worked well.Very hearty soup! Will make it again, but the leftovers weren't as good as I had hoped (luckily,there wasn't much left over!)

Baked the potatoes instead of boiling them; added a little butter, too. Came out great.

We LOVE this for a cold night. I followed many other reviewers' suggestions and pureed ALL of the potatoes; also added minced garlic, salt and pepper, and a dash of smoke flavoring. Also added in some canned real bacon bits during cooking. Yummy. Even better the next day!

This was a great place to start. I used all chicken broth, rather than water. Added celery and leek, and rather than thicken with flour, I pureed the potatoes to the desired consistency. A dash of half and half for creamy color.

Any dish that my picky father likes gets a four on this scale! I would definately make this recipe again. Make sure you add salt and pepper to this recipe.

I've made this several times with most of the modifications suggested by previous reviewers. I added three cloves of garlic, two cups of broth, 1 c. water and 3/4 c. milk. I also pureed some of the soup and added it back in for thickness. This is one of our favorite comfort foods--it's wonderful!

Rating: 3
I used a little less than 3/4 cups of flour, 1 cup of water, and 3/4 cups of milk. It turned out good. Very hearty(thick). I also mashed a portion of the potatoes and added that in with the rest of the potatoes. The bacon adds flavor, but the recipe definitely needs salt and pepper. Good for reheating and taking for lunch! The hardest part is peeling the potatoes!

This was a great and easy soup to make. However, I changed it a bit: 1 lb of red baby potatoes, added 1/2 cup of whipping cream, 1 tsp ground white pepperand simmered about 40 minutes with the bacon and chives included. My husband and I really enjoyed this on a cold night.

This soup hit the spot on a cold day. I made it and served it to 5 men putting in a new walkway and front steps for me. I made some homemade pumpernickle crutons to go on top. They enjoyed it on a break. As the one reviewer said it does need seasoning. Salt and pepper at least should be added when the potatoes go in to cook so they absorb it. They won't after they cook. Just be careful not to overdo it because canned stock can be salty.

This was good! But, after reading the reviews, I made some changes and am glad I did. First of all, I used a pound and 1/2 of new potatos and 8 strips of bacon, not 4; I also added one chopped leek that I sauteed along with the onion. Instead of using water, I only used chicken broth and found that I needed more than the recipe required. I would recommend pureeing about 1/3rd of the soup and adding the puree back to the pan. This needs some serious seasoning, otherwise it is too bland! So I added seasoned salt, basil, pepper, etc...I also added a little light cream at the end. We loved it and have extra!

You will notice that nearly everyone who reviewed this recipe made some changes or added ingredients. I tried the recipe without any modifications and it was not so great. My advice: If you have to change it that much, it is not worth the effort. Find a better recipe for a tried and true creamy potato soup and go with that instead. I wish I had.

Rating: 3
Following the advice of the other cooks, I added 2 cloves of garlic with the onion, pureed half of the soup, and added 1/4 cup of cream with the cheddar. I also sprinkled cracked pepper and salt on at the end. Next time I may omit the wine. Loved this recipe and will not doubt make it a gain for sure.

I would make this again, but with some of the substitutions of others. I printed it out without the reviews, so I forgot to add extra seasonings--the result was a bit bland. When I reheat it tonight, I'm going to add some garlic, for sure! Also, the recommendation to blend/mix/process some of the soup was a great one, it made it a lot thicker. I put maybe half of it in my blender and it got good and thick, then stirred it back in with the chunkier part. The texture was great!

Rating: 3
I followed the basic recipe, but added some herbs and spices like thyme, basil and white pepper. I also added garlic in with the onions, as well as some light cream at the end. All I can say is that my boyfriend ate three bowls and when I brought in leftovers for lunch at work, they all asked if they could try some. This is some good soup!

Wonderful fall soup. A meal in itself. I used russet baking potato (prebaked for 15min....took a little longer cooking time but worth it.) Also added a little garlic, and a 1/4 heavy cream at the end (this really brought the whole thing together). Very easy to prepare. We all had seconds. Would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I changed a few things and everybody loved it, especially the kids. I baked the potatoes first, with the oven at 500 for about 15 minutes, to cook the skins well. I left the skin on one of the potatoes when I cut them up. I added a cup of milk and about a teaspoon of thyme, and I let it all simmer for about 45 minutes. The soup ended up taking about an hour and 15 minutes from start to finish, but it was well worth it. I will definately keep this recipe.

My guests LOVED this soup -- I used more bacon and potato, substituted dry sherry for wine, and pureed 3/4 of the soup just before adding cheese. Fabulous!

This recipe turned out delicious for me...it did not earn it's 4th fork because I did add a few things. I did as the the other cook had said, cooking the onions in butter & omitted the bacon & I cooked it on medium for 1 hour. Also, I added 2 cups of milk & 1 tsp of thyme as it simmered. When the potato was soft I mashed them a little to give it a thicker consistency. I promise, if you follow these instructions it will turn out WONDERFUL!!

Good, easy, and well-received by ten-year old boys! Cooked the potatoes a bit longer and blended in the pot to make it smoother. Didn't have bacon, so cooked the onions in a little butter and stirred in leftover ham at the end.
