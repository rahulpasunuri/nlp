Wonderful! Even my kids liked it. Just make sure you don't add too much milk. To keep the sauce thick, I sprinkled a little flour (just a dusting) over the potatoes. Everybody loved it.

Full disclosure: I have lived in Portugal and this has always been my favorite dish. That said, I have to rate this only three forks. It tasted kind of bland compared to what I've had in Portugal. Will definitely make it again, but will add something (garlic?)to make it tastier.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for the Venetian style creamed Bakala, but this Portuguese version was very good as well. Very hearty, stick to the ribs meal for pennies a plate. I used a cup more milk than was called for to cook the fish and liked that it came out almost like a chowder. Being more creamy it kept well in the refrigerator. I completely agree with the recommended side dish of crisp salad or green vegetable. It helps to lighten up the meal.

So much oil.....Served it for a party and the consenus was that it was too bland even though I ddnt over soak the cod. I'm looking for a different version of this recipe as when I had it in Italy it was absolutely fabulous

I thought this recipe was delicious. My husband raved about it. Be carefule not to over soak the cod or it will loose all its flavor. I am looking forward to trying it again. I may add a little spice to it next time. Yummy!
