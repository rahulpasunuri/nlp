Delic! Used left over chicken breasts...so quick and hard to believe taste in such a short time. Added jalapeño and cilantro in chili because I luv both. Topped with additional cilantro, cheese and nacho strips...bacon and sour Creme would add even more to it.

Don't understand the positive reviews here. Followed exactly as written. The thigh meat seemed to give the dish an ugly grey color. I ended up adding chopped, sautéed red, yellow and orange bell peppers just to make it more visually appealing. I added salt as recipe calls for none and it is needed. I pureed an extra can of beans to make it more like chili than soup. I don't even notice the anise flavor, which might be interesting if it came through. I will choose a different recipe next time.

I have made this many times but I usually add a little more chicken. This is definitely a four fork recipe due to the great taste for such little effort. I have made it for guests and as something to have on hand because the left overs are fabulous. Good with the cheese and cilantro or not. I don't make the same thing twice very often but this is one we see quite a bit and never fails to please.

I love this recipe with a couple of changes. I use garbanzo beans instead of white beans and do not include the anise seed. To make it really easy-buy a roasted chicken and cut it up. So easy and the best flavor ever! I even won an award for best soup with my version.

Love this recipe! I make it without any additions or substitutions - it's perfect as is.

Very good! I puréed one can of the beans, added one large jalapeño, a can of creamed corn and some frozen corn kernels, topped with habernero cheese...and the cilantro is a nice touch. Oh, I grilled my chicken, then let it simmer.

My husband really liked this. Used ground chicken, cut down on cumin, pureed one can of beans for thickness, had only one small can of chilies and it was fine, added corn and sliced green part of scallions for color, which it needs. Out of cilantro, but would have been better with it. Goes into the meal rotation!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, but watch out for spiciness! I used 6 peppers instead of 8 and that was more than enough. Also, I omitted the extra tablespoon of hot sauce. Was not able to share with kids, but adults raved. Will definitely make it again, but maybe try less peppers. Also, used 2 percent milk and 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter to saute onions. It was creamy and more than rich enough for me.

Made this last night for company and it was a winner! Used olive oil, didn't have aniseed and added 1/4 lb more chicken, upped the garlic, didn't use whipping cream, did puree one can of beans for thickness and added a 1/4 - 1/2 cup of belgian ale at the end. It was outstanding and I can't wait to make it again! Perfect for a cold, snowy January night.

We eat this a lot--my whole family loves it, even the child who claims not to like chili. I always used ground chicken, and instead of cream I'll just add a splash of half and half or light cream. The cilantro adds a nice touch, but I usually omit the grated cheese. This makes a fast, hearty midweek meal.

I loved this recipe after I made my own modifications to eliminate all dairy and enhance to my taste. It was by far the fastest chili dish I've ever made and one of the best. Delicious! Substituted cream with extra chicken broth and olive oil for corn oil. Added one chopped jalapeno and 1/2 chopped sweet red bell pepper. Added 1 TBSP coriander.

This is fabulous made as is - but it's also very good with leftover chicken. We skip the cheese and cilantro and sub half and half or whole milk for the cream - still delicious.

This was really good for a variation on traditional chili. It has no tomatoes. I wanted a vegetable in it so I added some frozen corn. Would definitely make it again.

Rating: 0
Maybe a little off-topic -- I was searching for a chicken chili (preferably roasted chicken) on the site because I wanted something healther than the usual beef variation. But all the recipes I see call for cream, defeating the purpose of using a lower-fat meat. Anybody have any low-fat alternatives?

Rating: 4
This was fabulous! I subtracted most of the cumin (due to family tastes) and added red pepper flakes. Instead of canned chiles I used fresh jalapenos, since my garden was producing in abundance! I also threw in about 3 cups of chopped fresh kale to add a little veggie power. It was super-spicy and kept our mouths tingling. This would be a great dish to make in bulk and freeze.

This is fantastic. Very easy and very tasty. Have made it for lots of people and it is always a hit.

Rating: 3
Made this for my family yesterday. My husband loved it but the kids wouldn't touch it. I also pureed some of the beans and broth together because without doing so it's like beans and chicken in a creamy broth, which is not what I associate with chili. In an effort to appeal to the kids, I left out the oregano, anise and chilis, and I used chichen breast (already cooked). Very tasty, but I'm afraid my kids aren't ready for it.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a standard in our house. The kids love it. When making it for the kids, I leave out the dried crushed red pepper and onion, and it is still a winner with the adults. The cumin and heavy cream are key to this recipe. In a pinch, I have used whole milk, but it's just not the same, obviously.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious! I made some small adjustments. Strangely, our grocery store was out of boneless skinless chicken thighs, so I got bone-in skin-on thighs and roasted them at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes after making a spice rub of cumin, oregano, and S&P. Meanwhile I got everything else ready. When the chicken came out, I removed the skin and shredded the meat off the bone, then proceeded as the recipe indicated. I accidentally doubled the red pepper flakes, but turned out to like the spice, and I didn't have anise, so I omitted that. I also subbed half and half for the heavy cream, and I lengthened the simmer time to more like 30 minutes until it thickened and reduced. Served with cilantro, sharp cheddar cheese, and crumbled tortilla chips on top.

Rating: 3
Very very tasty. I used 2 seared chicken breasts chopped into tiny pieces, subbed sour cream for whipping cream, upped the red pepper flakes and pureed about a cup of the onions + chicken right before serving. Great when you eat it with hot tortillas!

This is my go-to white bean chili. Cant improve this recipe and after 4 years of making it periodically I'm still not sick of it. I think its the aniseed that makes it.

Rating: 4
As a white chicken chili this was good. I used left over cooked chicken and substituted sour cream for the whipping cream because that is what I had on hand. The flavors blended well and there was just enough heat. I still prefer a traditional chili over this, but it was a good way to use up leftovers.

Added yellow and red pepper I had left over from a thai peanut dressing/salad I made the night before. Used fresh red chili instead of dried. And replaced one can cannellini beans with navy/haricot beans. But in the end my fiance loved it! It's a keeper for sure.

Caveat! I did end up adding a lot of extra salt and cooking the chile a lot longer than suggested. I think pureeing would take away a lot of the charm of this dish...

Rating: 3
Not sure why I'm rating this one three stars instead of four - maybe because it's not one of those 'holy cow i made this!?' dishes. But that doesn't mean it's not delicious! The end result is subtle, hearty, spicy...everything you want in a winter meal. My New Mexico-bred husband loved it so much that he asked for it again the next week, at which point I doubled the recipe and froze half. We're still not sick of it, and I am not a chili person AT ALL. This is a very sophisticated version... As for recipe tweaks, I skipped the cheddar and subbed in fat-free sour cream for the cream (a gamble!) and it still turned out wonderfully. Don't forget the cilantro - it makes all the difference.

Rating: 4
Just made this for the first time and my family LOVED it. Definitely going into rotation-- so easy and super flavorful. The only changes I made was to use navy beans instead of canellini-- this addition did away with the longer cooking time needed to make the beans tender. I also skipped the cream, added an extra couple of cups of chicken broth and then added a big handful of sharp cheddar after taking it off the heat. Super!!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe 4x, and each time it's been a hit. Make it as is, knowing that if you don't have aniseseed, or decide to puree, it will still hold up very well. I make it per the recipe, except upon sauteeing the vegetables, I toss them into a crockpot; ditto the subsequent chicken thigh pieces. All the rest just gets tossed in, and can sit on high for 3-4 hours, and will still be wonderful. Love this, and have added it to my permanent repertoire, very select company, if I do say so myself.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. Don't bother with the suggestion to puree the beans - cook chili beyond the 10 minutes in the recipe at a low simmer for 30 minutes or so, which will break down the beans and thicken the mixture. I used the anisseed, but couldn't taste it; I forgot to buy the canned chilies when at the store, so doubled the red pepper flakes - worked for me. I used a cup of dry white wine instead of chicken broth and did not use the bean liquid; I also added a can of Green Giant Corn Niblets, including the juice - I like the added crunch. Altogether, the dish was very good and very easy, but still missing something, maybe a little salt. I love white beans, so look forward to making again (I also recommend Sausages with White Beans in Tomato Sauce on this site).

Rating: 4
Great recipe - but added zest of one lime and some juice, a handful of chopped cilantro, 1/4 of a new mexico green chili (because we like hot), replaced bean water with broth, and followed suggestion of earlier post to puree one can of beans. Didn't have cream (and didn't want fat) so added 1/2 C of low fat sour cream to Cuisinart along with beans and 1-2 T of broth... made lovely puree which stirred easily into the chili. Served w/sour cream, lime wedges, cilantro, avocado slices, and salsa for people to add as desired - flat out fabulous!

Wow! This is our family's new favorite chili-the dish is easy to make and delicious!!

After reading other reviews, I too, pureed a can of the beans and actually would probably puree all of them as I don't particularly care for whole beans and like a smoother soup-personal perferance. I added a can of chopped tomatoes which gave it more flavor. Also, used chicken breasts instead of thighs and omitted the aniseed. Would make it again

On a grey, rainy, fall Sunday, chili seemed the right thing to make for dinner. I made this recipe and it turned out very good. I followed some of the suggestions by other cooks and they were spot on. I pureed about 1 can of beans to thicken up the mixture. I added more chicken broth instead of bean liquid. And lastly I did not have aniseed, so I subbed fennel seeds. Garnished the chili with the cheddar cheese and some crushed tortilla chips. It was delish and my husband raved about this lovely chili. I highly suggest it to all.

My kids (12 and 7) really like this recipe too. I use only about 1/4 of the cream and substitute evaporated milk for the rest of the cream. I also use additional chicken stock instead of the bean liquid. I puree about a cup and a half of the beans to thicken the chili.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was tasty and very easy to make. The combination of cumin and in my case star of anise is spectacular. I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions: I sprinkled paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper on the chicken before roasting it in the oven (while I got everything else prepared). I had some celery and a carrot on hand, which I diced and added with the onions. I used one can of cannellini beans and one can of black beans (since that is what I had). I added two spicy sausages sliced up (since I didn't have enough chicken) and some frozen corn (since I was short a can of beans). I also made a red onion, diced tomato and cilantro topping. It turned out delicious and colorful.

We loved this chili!!! My husband, my 7 1/2 yr old and my 6 yr old all thought it was even better than my standard red bean chicken chili. However, I did make some changes... substitute 1 lb. chicken thighs for 1 lb. cubed chicken breast (do not sautee or add salt and pepper to it) I doubled the recipe and added 3 stalks of celery (chopped) and 3 carrots(chopped). I also omitted the whipping cream and added 1-14.75 oz. can of creamed corn and 1-11 oz., can of sweet corn. My final change in this recipe is that I cooked it all on low in the crock pot for 6 hours. Enjoy! I have stored this recipe in a file and will keep it forever! Big YUM!!!!

Excellent - I used store bought rotisserie chicken which makes it very easy to make (and delicious). I agree you don't need whipping cream, but I added half and half to give it some richness. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Very quick & easy, and very tasty. I substituted boneless chicken breasts and used whole milk instead of cream and left off the cheese by accident - but I am happy I did. My seven-year-old ate it all up, but my three year old didn't like the way it looked. This is a keeper and great way to nmake an inexpensive meal with staples most people have on hand!

This is a stand-by recipe for us. We've served it at chili parties, taken it camping (it reheats very easily), and shared it with soup club. The recipe is perfect. If you're serving with kids you may want to keep the red pepper out and serve it on the side. The green chilis add just a little zing that is dampened a bit by the cream. This is delicious.

Rating: 4
What more can I add? This is quick and super-easy, and I love recipes that call for boneless skinless chicken thighs--much better flavor than breasts. Just a splash of cream works well, and makes the cheese unnecessary.

This one of my only go-to dishes (I generally like to walk on the wild side and try new things, even with guests coming.) But, I have served this to all kinds of people, and even finicky kids. I generally use chicken breasts, and omit the cream. (A little sour cream in at the end is a nice touch, but not necessary.) Overall it is a winner. I generally skimp on the red pepper flakes only because we generally have kids in the mix.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time in the winter and it is the perfect meal to have on hand for lunch or when I am in the mood for comfort food. I don't include the chilis and I think that it tastes fine without it. I do load up, however, on the cilantro and cheddar cheese garnish, which gives it a nice flavor in combination with the chili itself. Really, really easy to make, comforting and tasty! I share this recipe with everyone!

This is one of my family's favorites. Known as the "stuff that looks bad but tastes good". I do modify it to a healthier version by using all boneless chicken breasts and substituting organic half-n-half for the cream. I also increase the broth by making 1-1/2 times the liquid, sauce & green chilis. I don't use cheese, but garnish with a fresh chopped tomato, onion and cilantro blend. It smells fantastic and tastes just as good.

Excellent recipe. I make it a couple of times a month and my family licks the pot clean. Thighs are the best--juicy and delicious. I do add more chicken broth (about 2 cups total), omit the cream and stir in 1/2 cup sour cream at the very end. Fab!

So, omit the cheese and add 1 cup of wine to the the chicken broth. Add roasted sausages to the mix of it and garnish with parsley, not cilantro. It becomes a rustic italian dish that i serve with crusty garlic toasts.

I had tried white chili for the first time recently at a church social, so I found this recipe online. Wonderful! I did use navy beans and puréed one can with all juices added. Also included one diced jalapeño. I questioned the anise seed but included it, and I'm glad I did. It adds a subtle complexity to the flavor and blends very well. I plan to make a double recipe very soon; this one was gone way too fast!

I really enjoyed the ease of this recipe. It was easy to put together and could easily be made on a weeknight. I used 2 lbs. of chicken breast and great northern beans. I ommitted the aniseed and red pepper and added 2 t. chopped jalapeno instead. I had to increase the broth too. Great on a bitter, winter day.

Rating: 4
I've made this 5 or 6 times now, and guests ALWAYS ask for the recipe. I've made the following changes to address the potential "blandness " mentioned by some reviewers, and feel like this a 4 fork recipe: replace cream with fat free half and half, use chicken breast (my preference - I don't like dark meat), add 1/2 cup light sour cream (adds great flavor!), and, if you like things a bit spicy, add 5 or 6 jalapeno slices and/or a dash or two of habanero sauce. Excellent on a snowy December day! (Also, I've never added the anise seed, and still love the recipe!)

Good recipe but the better one is Chicken and White Bean Chili (BA 2002). I expected more from this recipe based on all the great reviews. I thought this one was a little bland. I took reviewer advice and pureed one can of the beans to thicken the chili and it worked perfectly - great consistency.

Great on cold day. Everyone said they liked it and two people asked me for the recipe. I made a double recipe. On day 1 it was a bit soupy but on day 3 (today) it's very thick. I plan to make a big batch often and keep some in the freezer for chili emergencies.

Love this! I used different beans (canelli, black and great northern) and added some jalapeno. I really like the aniseed undertone. Sounds a bit od, but it's just a hint and it really works with the flavors. I didn't serve with cilantro, but I threw a bit in to the recipe.

I love this chili and have made it many times. It's quick, easy, healthy and really tasty.

I made this chili and also a red chili for dinner guests- all loved this dish better than the traditional beef. I don't like anise so I did leave that out, and followed other reviewers suggestions and replaced the cream with an extra can of beans, pureed. This gave the chili a creamy texture, and no one missed the extra calories. This dish has just the right level of "kick", not too spicy, and so easy to make- I did make this the night before and it reheated beautifully. Will make this again for sure!

I make this dish whenever I have company coming over because I can make it the night before, stick in fridge, and re-heat just before guests arrive. I made a few revisions turning it into a Stoup (not a soup, not a stew) by adding roasted Italian sweet sausages stuffed with slivered garlic and rosemary sprigs. I sliced them up as it was all simmering and threw them in with everything else. I also added 1/2 cup of pinot grigio before adding the chicken broth mixture.I ommitted the chilis and the cheese which I know changes the recipe completely but it is truly a wonderful way to vamp this dish up. Delicious!!!!

A clear winner, especially on chilly autumn/winter afternoons. Extremely easy, and somehow makes the chicken tremendously tender.

I've substituted a cajun sausage as well, with a different but also wonderful taste.

Yum. The combination of the creamy texture and the bite of the chili is excellent.

Delicious. Other than being a bit too hot (spicy) for my family. The next time, I will omit the red pepper. I used about 1/4 cup more whipping cream also. This will be a common dish at my house. Love the flavor of the Oregano, Cumin & Anise together. Next time I'll probably add a little Cilantro too.

I took this to my church's Chili Cookoff and got rave reviews. Several people who don't like chili normally (including my husband) really enjoyed it, and I placed 2nd in the taste test.

This was a delicious chili...served after the playoff game yesterday to very appreciative friends. Here are the changes I made. Olive oil instead of corn oil. I also used cumin seed, toasted until aromatic and added along with cumin powder. Two cups of chicken broth, omitted anise and whipping cream. I used only 2 cans of beans...one can of white, and one can of black beans, drained. The only bummer is that there were no leftovers! I would love to have a bowl today.

I've made this before but this time I created a lighter version thats equally as good! Used 1/2 boneless/skinless chicken thighs + 1/2 boneless/skinless chicken breats, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream, and low-fat shredded monteray jack (also omitted anisseed). This cuts out tons of fat but none of the flavor!

I will confess to altering this recipe as follows: I used one can white beans, one can black (be sure to use the bean liquid from the white beans) and one can corn. I added a bunch of roasted red peppers, omitted the aniseed and cilantro and put in a generous 4 tsp. cumin. I stirred in half a cup of reduced fat sour cream at the end. Delicious! My boyfriend and I have it at least twice a month.

Pretty good, I expected it too be too liquid-y for my taste and it was, but just by a bit. I made it with 1% milk and forgot the cheese on top and it was still pretty rich tasting, and plenty spicy with a little hot sauce thrown in.

Very tasty, a nice mellow change from the more common red chilis. I would definitely recommend garnishing with cilantro, crushed tortilla chips, maybe a little shredded white Jack cheese. Ungarnished it is just a tiny bit too bland. Easy recipe to double, triple, etc, when serving a big crowd.

One of our all-time favorites - we've been using this recipe for 2 years and we are never disappointed. We use some light sour cream mixed in at the end instead of the cream, and sometimes I use boneless chicken breasts - it's great either way.

This is a favorite in our house (and with company!). I've used both canned and dried beans with equally good results. I don't use the aniseed (we hate it), but I add more cumin (we love it). Sometimes I soften some mild dried chili peppers in the chicken broth and then put them in the food processor with some of the beans; it adds great flavor. Also, I use the full amount of cream, but I use fat-free half & half instead. Excellent!

I made this soup for my boyfriend and I on our first chilly fall evening and we both LOVED it! I took other reviewers advice and pureed an additional can of canellini beans with the chicken stock.

I was searching for a chicken chili recipe, but stumbled on a recipe on this site for smoked chicken chowder, and so the first time I made this, I substituted smoked turkey breast for the chicken thighs, and it was out of this world. You might try it. Since the smoked turkey I get is precooked, you need every bit of the liquid to soften the meat. Also, I simmer the chili longer, to disperse the smoke flavor throughout.

Definitely simple to make and satisfying... however, it didn't have the thick chili consistency I was hoping for. I followed the directions, although I added one can of black beans and two cans of cannelini beans (per another chef's suggestion) and used olive oil instead of corn oil. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of chicken broth, omit the heavy cream and use 2 T. of sour cream instead. The cilantro and cheddar cheese on top is a must!!

We make this frequently during the week, and always enjoy it. Changes we have developed over time: Use 1/3 c. fat-free sour cream just before serving instead of whipping cream. Take a 4th can of beans, drain, and puree with the reserved bean juice and broth to make the texture thicker and more satisfying. Use fennel seed if you can't find aniseed. Use turkey breast cutlets as an alternative to chicken thighs.

Great recipe. Did not have anise seed (hard to find in England) so substituted 2-3 cloves of star anise (easy to find in England, use in asian soups, etc). Also added some chick peas which really worked well and used less cream, instead thickening it a touch with flour/water. To go along, made some home made tortillas (recipe from this site).

This was wonderful...and so quick! I used what I had on hand: 2 cans great northern beans, 1 4 oz. can chiles, and chicken breast instead of thighs...and it was still great. This one's a keeper!

I made the recipe exactly as written for the superbowl and it was awesome! I didn't think I would like chili that wasn't traditional meat and tomatos!

Never had white chili before and this was great! I liked the addition of the anise--gave it a unique flavor. I did only put 4.5 oz green chilis, but added 3 serrano peppers which gave it some nice heat. I also used 1 can black, 1 can Great Northern and 1 can Canelli. Served with cheddar and sour cream. Would definately make again!!

Perfect chicken chili recipe. I'd never have thought of adding aniseed to a chili. Very subtle and tasty. And a nice change from the usual beef chili.

I didn't have the anise seed or the green peppers but we thought it was really good. I wouldn't add the green peppers anyway, then the kids would never eat it!

Pretty good chili , but not to die for. I added dried cilantro along with other spices, and omitted the aniseed. I also added hominy, and used ground turkey instead of chicken (next time I'd stick with the recipe and use chicken). I garnished the chili with avocado, jalepeno jack cheese & salsa verde. My husband really liked this chili (although I prefer Halftime Chili from this website).

Very quick and easy to make. Needs a little something to give the flavor a kick. Didn't knock my socks off, but I would make this again.

I made this for work and had 4 requests for the recipe. Instead of 3 cans of cannellini beans I used 1, then added 1 can of Great Northern Beans and 1 of White Beans. I also shredded left over chicken breast for half the meat used cubed chicken breast for the rest.

I've made this recipe with chicken thighs, chicken breasts, and even pork. The thighs have great flavor although they take quite a bit more time to trim off the fat than the breasts. Pork is second best flavor-wise, (especially tenderloin) and is also easy to work with. Honestly, I just use whatever is on sale.. I usually reduce the beans to one can (restricted-carb diet) and add lots of banana peppers and/or anaheims to add vitamins and extra flavor & heat. Also, I use very generous spoonfuls of seasonings because I love spice. It's a tasty, easy, and soul-warming cool-weather dish.

I make this chili every year for the family Christmas get together. Everyone loves it and insists that I make it again next year. Serve it with Pissaladieres and fruit salad for an easy holiday meal.

Excellent dish that always gets rave reviews from our family and friends. We also used chicken breasts instead of thighs and omitted the cilantro.

This is a staple in our house. I do omit the aniseed as my family doesn't like the flavor. For ease, I seer boneless skinless chicken breasts just to get some color, cut them up, and then add them to the chili. Do not let the chili boil or the chicken will get tough. DELICIOUS!

I always get rave reviews when I make this simple dish! It's one of those recipes people are always asking for! The hardest part is finding boneless, skinless, chicken thighs....without boning and skinning yourself....they do, however, show up at the grocery store once in a while so it's worth stocking up!

Sooo good. 1/2 & 1/2 worked fine instead of the cream. Make sure to use the Anise seed. It adds a great flavor. Also, top it with a nice salsa verde. My children loved it.

We love this dish! I make the Chili Roasted Chicken with Roasted Garlic Gravy from this site quite often, and I always make this chili with the leftover chicken. I just toss the chicken cubes with a little chili powder and then sautee with the onions and garlic when they're almost done! I leave out the aniseed, and instead of 7 oz of green chiles I use 4 oz of green chiles and 4 oz of canned roasted jalepenos. I also sub fat free half & half for the heavy cream to lower calories and fat. I don't understand how some could call this soupy if you drain the beans and only use one cup of broth! This is one of our favorite meals, and we always look forward to it as a 'double feature' when I make that fabulous Roasted Chicken!

I thought this was pretty bad: soupy, bland, blech. However, my husband quite liked it and is sorry I won't be making it again. Go figure!

Our family really enjoyed this comfort dish. I did omit the aniseed and used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Based on other reviews I used half and half in place of the whipping cream. Great for families with small kids who don't like too much heat in their foods.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great! Very tasty and spicy. I added a few chipolte chilies, diced, for some added spice and smokey flavor. Topping with cilantro made it extra good.

I would add spicy turkey sausage to give it some zip - but this was good and quick. Great for a weeknight.

I thought the recipe called for too much liquid, so I omitted the bean liquid. I also used chicken breasts. Be careful - this recipe packs a lot of heat!!!!!!!!!!

I was a little skeptical at first. But decided to make it based on the good reviews. It was really good! I left out the anise and used chicken breast instead of thighs. Also I only had two cans of beans so I added a cup of corn to make up for the third can. My husband raved as well. I am sure we will make this again!

This recipe is easy to make, and is delicious! I also substituted breasts for thighs and omitted the aniseed. The consistency is fairly soupy, so if want a thicker chili, hold off a bit on the broth and/or simmer for a longer time. I served this with corn bread, which went very well.

I made this for a group of people on Christmas Eve. They couldn't get enough of it. I used creme frechie instead of sour cream. Yum!

What a great recipe. I made some adjustments to it like omitting the anise. I also used, like others here, sour cream instead of heavy cream. I also used a bit more cumin and put some chili powder and hot sauce. I brought it to my office X-mas party and it was a HUGE hit.

This is without a doubt my all time favorite recipe from the epicurious website. My husband requests it at least once a week. The flavors are wonderful and it's VERY easy to make. To cut the fat, you can use skinless chicken thighs, or skinless/boneless chicken breasts. I always sub low fat sour cream for the cream and it still tastes great.

Wonderful! I substituted the corn oil with olive oil and only used 2 cans beans. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Everyone requests the recipe and I shall make it often!

I made this awesome chili last night for my family and they all raved about it! Since I am a vegetarian, my mother couldn't believe that I served her such a delicious meat dish! It was very easy to make and I substituted half and half for the cream. It is a good idea to make it atleast four hours ahead of time to let it flavor.

This is a terrific recipe that works well for a few or for a large crowd -- Not to mention that it's a snap to prepare. I'll keep the ingredients on hand so I can make this delicious, hearty dish through the fall and winter.

Excellent and easy to make. Whole family enjoyed (including kids). Nice to use canned beans. Great results substituting half & half for cream, chicken breasts for thighs and leaving out aniseed (thanks to other reviewers). Made a double batch (can't imagine a single would go too far). Be sure to cut the chicken into small pieces. I sauteed the onions, garlic and spices, then removed from pan and browned the chicken in batches over high heat with a little more oil(thought chicken would be more tender that way). Served with sour cream and cheese. We may not make traditional ground beef chili again.

I was a little nervous while cooking this - there isn't much color to this dish. However, both my husband and I really liked the flavor. The only change that I made was to increase the crushed red pepper to give it a little more zing.

I made this dish for homecoming and it was wonderful. I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and had to use white navy beans. I also exchanged the whipping cream for half and half. I made it the day before then heated it on low in my crock pot. Family loved it!! Served with texas toast!

Easy and terrific but a bit too spicy for my eight year old. I omitted the aniseed and the cream and increased the garlic. I let it simmer a little longer than indicated and it was very "creamy" without the cream. This will be a "regular".

This was very easy to make and it tasted great. I used half and half instead of whipping cream and left out the aniseed. I also used small white beans insted of white kidney beans because they seemed more appealing to me. Lastly, I used chicken breasts and next time I will cut it into smaller pieces. This was a big hit in my house. Even my six year old loved it. I will definitely make this again and again!

I have fixed this dish for family and friends and have gotten great feedback on it (pun intended). I have doubled it. I also substituted chicken breast for the thigh, I used 1/2c beer with 1/2c chicken broth and I also used fat free half and half instead of the cream. It really is a nice winter's meal for casual entertaining.

This whipped up in no time and was excellent. Don't omit the bean juice. My mom, who doesn't like spicy food, enjoyed this. So did my husband, who says "bring on the spice." Go figure. I say, YUM.

This was a great change from regular run of the mill chili. I had a big group over so I doubled the receipe and made a few adjustment. I omitted the cream and used chicken broth and I used dry beans (that I had presoaked). I also used chicken breasts instead of thighs thus reducing the fat content. Instead of chopping the chicken into chunks I stripped it into small pieces with helped to disperse the chicken flavor throughout the chili.. After cooking it, I put the chili in a crock pot on low so that my guest could serve themselves.. I served it with cornbread.. I highly recommend this chili particularly on those cold fall or winter days.

After trying several other chicken chili recipes that were more complex and labor-intensive, this is the best of them all - wonderful flavor, just the right amount and blend of seasonings and zip, and it goes together in no time flat. I used a whole 10 oz can of broth, and cut the heavy cream to one-fourth or one-third cup. I also used a 4.5 oz. can of diced green chilies with another can waiting in the wings if more were needed, but found one can did the trick. This one goes into the collection of our very favorite things.

I used a whole can of chicken broth and didn't put in the aniseed. It was more like a soup than a chili but it was wonderful!
