I made this salad for family on Labor Day. Two out of five people didn't like it and didn't eat it. One person loved it and asked for the recipe. Two people including myself were not very impressed with this recipe. It was 'OK' but not 'Great' in my opinion. I try to only collect and use 'Great' recipes. I may try to tweek this recipe and make it better by adding some sweetness to it.

Something is missing in this salad. I would maybe marinate the jicama in lime juice and then toss the salad. Definitely needs more salt. The should be juicy and not too dry also. Otherwise this seems to be too bland.

I left out the cheese because it seemed completely unnecessary, and I was looking for something more healthy. Tasted alone, the jicama salad is quite good, but where this dish really shines is as an accent to something else. I had the Tomato, Avocado, Red Onion sandwich with it and very much appreciated having the jicama to turn to between bites of the sandwich. Crisp, clean taste. Very solid recipe.

I tried making this salad earlier this summer. I served it to my mother who loves jicama but does not like mint too much. I thought that the combination of mint, lime and chile powder was delicious. Her reaction was better than I thought. (Hint, this will not keep for more than a day without significant loss of flavor.)
