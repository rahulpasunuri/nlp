This was GOOD, not great. The sauce was delicious, but the potato cakes were nothing super special. I agree with kate_knox about letting the cakes rest- and you have to really dredge them in flour to get them to not fall apart when frying. At a party recently, they went over well, but I would make a few adjustments (i.e. more grated Parmesan, more salt, more lemon zest) before making it again.

You absolutely have to let the cakes rest for at least half an hour to get them to bind together for cooking. I also added chopped green onion and roasted garlic to the potato/spinach mixture and breaded them in a parmesan/ panko mixture - excellent.

I only had kale on hand and not spinach but I wasn't disappointed by the exchange! I roasted the tomatoes while boiling the potatoes to save time and freshness then did the rest. Came out perfect. Nice and crispy!

To the Baltimore cook, use the Roma tomatoes fresh, it makes a HUGE difference in the sauce. Also, I only used about 3 tablespoons of fresh grated Parma cheese, and I used Betty Crocker Butter and Herb potatoes instead of mashing the real thing. Give this a shot, it was SO good!

I made this with my vegetarian daughter, and my husband (an avowed carnivore)and I really liked this! I would use the filling to stuff chicken breasts or use with pasta rolls. Very nice, a keeper for us!

This is very good. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil. It wasn't really a puree but gave plenty of tomato flavor. Also, the recipe doesn't give the quantity for the parmesan, so I used 1/2 cup. I would probably increase that the next time I make this. I had trouble with the first few cakes not holding together, but I found that other cakes that had been sitting while the first ones cooked were fine. Next time I think I'll make all the cakes and let them sit for about 30 minutes.
