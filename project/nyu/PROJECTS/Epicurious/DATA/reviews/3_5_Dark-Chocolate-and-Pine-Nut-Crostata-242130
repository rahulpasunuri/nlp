Easy to make. Just delicious. Make sure you make whipped cream for it, too! A pretty easy recipe but seems much fancier.

Didn't work well for me. Easy, except for the crust edges sinking down - makes a much less impressive presentation than it should. And the chocolate is a bit too straightforward for me. But it is easy.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could; I do not give 4 forks to anything but the most exceptional dishes. Overall, I really liked this dish, and I thought that it was very easy to make. I will probably make it again for one of those times when I have to throw something together quickly, but I want something sophisticated. A word of warning--the crust really will need pushing up. I have never had a tart crust require any such thing, so I initially ignored that direction. When I looked in the over 7 minutes after I put it in, the crust had sagged and it was too late to fix it very well. You couldn't really tell once the filling was in it, though. I served this with a lightly sweetened Grand Mariner whipped cream with a little bit of Grand Mariner on the side, and it was perfect.

Wonderful.Easy to prepare a night before. The pine nuts add nice texture and give the tart a nutty flavor. A hit with my crowd.
