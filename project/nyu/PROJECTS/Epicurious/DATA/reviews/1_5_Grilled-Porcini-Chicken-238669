I thought this recipe was totally lacking in flavor. It's only good for use in a recipe calling for cooked chicken.

I had some ground porcini left after making the porcini crusted fillets from this site and decided to make this recipe. I thought the paste was too thick. It didn't want to spread under the skin it just sat in big lumps. I still was pretty good in the end but next time I would thin it out a little more.
