I've made this twice now, and both times, it came out kind of greasy and heavy. Either I'm doing something wrong, or there is just way too much oil in the recipe. Will try again before moving on to a different recipe.

Great spin on cornbread. I added some thawed corn and more jalepenos. I put it into loaf pans and it definitely took at least 35 minutes maybe a little more to cook all the way through.

Best cornbread ever! Made it for a party, added about 1/2 C of thawed frozen corn and another tbsp of so of minced jalapenos. Highly recommend!

Tasted good, but a little greasy. Like the idea of using corn instead of cheese and will try that next time. Easy to make. The 30 minutes it took to bake allowed time to BBQ chicken breasts and to prepare & steam vegetables. Also added a few more jalapenos. My market carries "tamed" pickled jalapenos - they had flavor and texture, but not too much heat.

I thought this recipe was okay but not outstanding. I made muffins (cooked in 15 minutes). I used 3 tablespoons of minced pickled jalapeno, and I thought the heat in the muffins was perfect. It was the cheese flavor that I missed. With all of the cheese in the recipe (I used a good sharp cheddar), I expected more presence. I might give this recipe another try and add some whole corn to the mix. I just didn't think the overall flavor was that interesting.

Per the directions we made this with gouda instead of manchego because we had a block sitting around. We enjoyed it, the corn bread was pretty moist and tasty. Didn't have a ton of heat, but a nice amount. Definitely wasn't hard to make either. The cheese just wasn't all that prevalent and we wouldn't add the additional calories again I don't think.

YUM! This smelled so good coming out of the oven and the cheese was all melty and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half cheddar/half pepper jack (couldn't find manchego). I also added some extra fresh chopped jalapeno for some heat. Definitely way moister and more flavorful than other cornbreads. The only thing I'd suggest is maybe adding more sugar. Enjoy!

Loved these! I made them to go with white chicken chili, but can't wait to make them alongside barbecue or Brunswick stew. A little pricey with the Manchego so I'll try it with Gouda. See the whole story at http://mommyporch.blogspot.com/2010/12/manchego-jalapeno-cornbread-muffins.html

That is the best cornbread recipe I've found. I made it with gouda as I couldn't find Manchego. It's best hot out of the oven. Very easy to make.

Really delicious and so easy to whip up! I used a nice aged cheddar instead of manchego and used a bit more than the recipe specified. Made it a few times as per the recipe, then tried baking individually in muffin tins and loved it. Bake for 15-17 minutes instead if you try this. Used a gluten-free flour mix and almond milk and it was cheesy, jalapeno-y, and delicious :)

Very good but could use some more oomph. I'd add more pepper, more cheese next time. I also put an ear or two of fresh corn in and I liked the result.

oh yum! had this for a 4th of July bash and the question kept coming up " this can't be corn bread- it must be corn cake!"..so rich and delicious...must make again!

This is a wonderful recipe and I would give it 3.5 forks if that option were available. I did not have the cheese specified and used a sharp cheddar in it's place. Very moist, flavorful and attractive to boot. Bread took 28 minutes to cook.

I loved this recipe after I tweaked it just a little bit. I am not a fan of manchengo, but I LOVE Cabot's chipotle cheddar and rather than using jalapenos, I used canned green chiles. The combination of the sweet chipotle and the mellow green chiles is out of this world, and 10 minutes later there is just a hint of heat still in my throat. Can't wait to see what people think at the bbq this afternoon...Happy Memorial Day!

I loved this recipe. I altered it a bit... Using fresh Jalapenos and tripled the quantity of diced fresh peppers than what was called for and it could have been more. Also added 1 cup of frozen Corn Kernals that were defrosted and drained. The cheese I used was a shredded mixture of 4 cheeses (Provolone, Asagio,Parmesan & Romano) It may impart a different "cheesiness"... But it was cheap and easy to use since you can buy containers of these shredded cheeses and they are great for salads etc. Cooked it a full 30-35 minutes and the top browned slightly and it was DELICIOUS! Am sure it would freeze well too!

Actually Janex is not totally correct. Yes, you can buy jalepenos in a can. They are just sliced, diced peppers in a can. However, pickled jalepenos are in a can and have been seasoned to pickle and are usually whole. The can clearly states "pickled". I can only find them at the latino markets. They sell for about $1.60 a can and usually have sliced carrots in them too. They are spicy and provide excellent flavor.

To answer endomadre's question - pickled jalapenos are canned jalapenos. I have not tried the recipe yet!

I chose this recipe for the intriguing combination of ingredients in the title. The finished product was less exotic than I had expected, although it is an excellent cornbread recipe. Cornbread, to me, is usually pretty dry and boring, and this was, well, less dry and more flavorful. I would make this again, but I might try fresh, minced jalepenos (what are pickled jalepenos anyway - I used canned) and I wouldn't waste the good Manchego (which I prefer straight-up with a glass of tempranillo). I would use any semi-hard, sharp cheese on hand.

I made this recipe with Gouda because it happened to be cheaper than Manchego at the store. I LOVE it. I added far more jalapenos than called for in the recipe and I think that was a good thing. One of the best things about the recipe is putting tons of cheese on the top before putting the bread in the oven--the resulting melty deliciousness is fabulous. If you're wondering if these different flavors really go together, stop worrying. They are quite harmonious.
