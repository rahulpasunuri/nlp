i like this but do not add the pork. and this uses a lot of ingredients which is not good on a limited budget

Absolutely delicious! I just wish there were some veggies in it. Sometimes we add fresh spinach towards the end. That works well. Even without greens, this recipe is amazing.

I use this recipe as a starter for my own soup. I add more shrimp, delete the pork and add fresh Asian veggies -- fresh lemongrass, bok choy and carrots. I slice the bok choy thin, and grate the carrots with a large size grater. Ionly cook the vegetables for a few minutes after the rest of the soup has been simmered as the recipe says. I cut the tops off the bok choy stalks, chop them and throw them on top at the last minute. You can also add some cooked thick Thai style noodles at the bottom of the bowl before you ladle the hot soup on top. Garnish with cilantro and green onions. I love this version of it.

Good recipe, but was bland without a number of adjustments. So I wouldn't make this recipe again...but I got a great outcome by doing the following: I added about 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 4 Tbsp mirin, a touch more fish sauce, juice from 1/2 a lime, and some chopped cilantro. I also added some mushrooms and tomato. In fact, doing it over again, I'd probably substitute lime juice for the lemon juice called for. For flexibility, use whatever meat/fish you desire. I used chicken and shrimp (omitted the pork). I think pieces of white fish would be good as well. I'm going to write up my version of this and put in my public recipe box (wtidmarsh).

I had to use up some things in the house and found this recipe. I had everything on hand except pork and chicken, i.e., only the shrimp and had only one bottle of clam juice so used chicken broth as substitute for 2nd bottle. Still great! (Used 1 1/2 lbs shrimp but only simmered shells of 1 lb). I don't like the work of grating lemon peel so wonder if kaffir lime leaves would work as a substitute. It had that kind of zing to it. Not very spicy as far as most Thai but certainly easy enough to change that up. My guys loved it.

I made this last night along with the Asian Pear Salad with Sesame Dressing on this site. It turned out fantastic! My cousins were devouring it. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 2 Tbl lime juice and 4 Tbl lemon juice. (I ran out of lemon) It didn't really matter as it was excellent. It was easy to make too!

Delicious, quick, easy; also made it with light coconut milk. I thought the chicken needed one minute and the shrimp 30 secs in simmering soup, not 3 minutes -- they were cooked through and still moist, not dry or rubbery.

Delish! Served this at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it (adults and teens). I roasted the shrimp tails on stovetop first to release flavor before making stock. Also added 1 tsp of Hon Dashi (bonito fish soup stock). Due to clam allegrgy I substituted a chicken stock. Added some sliced red bell pepper mushrooms. Served with boiled maifun (rice noodles) instead of rice. The noodles were harder to eat with a spoon, but we eventually broke out the forks and ate like a pasta. Served with Asian Pear Salad made with baby spinach, and a warmed curry flatbread (Tandoori Naan from Trader Joes).

Wonderful flavor and delicious!

Delicious, and easy to make. I like to brown the pork before I add it to the soup though, and I add more green onions and cilantro.

this is a fabulous recipe and so easy to accommodate personal preferences. i cut the lemon and coconut milk in half. wanted more broth, so i added a can of garlic roasted chicken broth. even my "meat and potato" irishman husband loved it. my sister made it for the superbowl with 1/2 the lemon but all the coconut milk and absolutely loved it. i served the thai cucumber salad with it - yummy.

I cooked this for my family last night, and they loved it! I had never made any Asian cuisine from scratch before, and found this very easy and delicious. I only made some minor changes: I used LITE coconut milk instead of regular (huge fat content difference). I didn't have any fresh cilantro (it died), so I skipped that part and stuck to the green onions and added some bean sprouts like another reviewer (made for a great consistency). When I served it I squirted some fresh lime juice over the top...(happened to have some already cut for something else). I accompanied the dish with salad served with a sesame dressing I found on this site under "ASIAN PEAR AND WATERCRESS SALAD WITH SESAME DRESSING". FANTASTIC! Definetly a keeper!

Made this soup for a group of 12. It was a big hit. Had several guests request a copy of the recipe. Will definately make this one again

Delicious. I will make this again. No changes necessary, but I do serve the garlic-chili sauce at the table for those who like a little extra heat. Oh, and I did add a few bean sprouts for a little crunch.

After making this once, I've had repeated requests to make it again. I use a little more garlic chili sauce than in the recipe. Fantastic!

Although this is a tasty soup, it is not the end of my search for an incredible Shrimp soup. I did add a couple of lemongrass stalks to the broth, a great addition, but even then found it to be marginal at best. My guests loved it, so it is definitely worth a try; I just found it to be blase.

This dish was simply superb!! My family and I love spicy dishes and everyone simply could not have enough of this soup. To make the soup a complete meal in itself, try adding some rice vermicelli (clear thin) noodles. To add a little more zing to the flavor, add some lemon grass and a little lime juice (you can even use the lime juice as a complete substitute to the lemon juice). To make it less fattening, reduce the amount of coconut juice. Overall, this dish was definitely wonderful and I would certainly make it again.

The basis of this recipe is good, but with a little doctoring, it can be fabulous! We added a bit less lemon juice(could use lime juice here), and we added 2-3 stalks of lemongrass,cut in one inch pieces and crushed. This goes in the broth step(strained out). Then we sauteed red pepper strips for a couple of minutes in sesame oil, then add straw mushrooms for one minute. Add this in with the chicken, shrimp, pork step. We prefer just shrimp and chicken(no pork). We finally added one tbsp garlic chili paste and 1 tsp chili hot chili paste(LOVE spicy). Awesome

The broth in this recipe is missing something - I would throw in a little lemon grass, and maybe some garlic. In addition, it needs a sweetness dimension which I would add with chopped red pepper. Don't skimp on the cilantro and chopped green onions - they really matter. For those who like really spicy soups, double the garlic chili paste.

This was a superior dish probably closer to 3.5 on the rating scale. While I prefer it slightly more spicy, it was just right for those who prefer not to be breathing fire. My wife has resisted trying this dish since she generally doesnot like her food too hot and spicy nor does she like coconut milk. Her response to this recipe was--"Will you make this for my brother?...My sister would go crazy over this dish!...and..."This is 'Out of this World'". Also, do not be deceived by the word "soup". This can act as the entire meal. And, finally, both my 8 and 5 year old boys found this delicious and "Not too spicy".
