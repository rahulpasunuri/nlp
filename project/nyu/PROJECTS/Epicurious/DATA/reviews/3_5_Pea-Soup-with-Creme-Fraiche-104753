Made this soup on a weekday night - barely took any effort but turned out quite nice. I had to add a LOT of seasoning to it to make it more tasty. I added thyme, a lot of pepper and salt (1 tsp was just not enough)and juice from 1 lemon and garnished it with grated habanero pepper to add some spice. Then it tasted very nice :) You can see a pic here: http://bit.ly/fpEE3l

Bland and uninspired. My grandpa liked it, but his taste buds were shot off in the war.

Made this for dinner last night. It was very tasty. Added more peas and potatoes. Also added fresh mint. Family loved it. Served with popovers. Will make again.

Despite using a great stock (instead of water) as a base, this soup was really bland. It was certainly edible, wildly simple to prepare, and an interesting bright color, but I would not make it again.

Great texture, distinct pea flavor, but not a lot of depth. Was good, but probably won't be made again.

really easy to make, used more shallots and left it chunky. Everyone thought it was the very essence of peas!

Soup was great added more peas than called for to get a beter texture. I also added some julienne mint to the soup during cooking, just a little. i also found if you add some lemon juice to your creme fraich it gives the soup a nice balance.

There was nothing particularly special about this pea soup recipe, except a nice creamy texture. Next time will try adding some mint oil.

Delicious! A fresh version of split pea soup. I used a mix of vegatable and chicken stocks (2 cups) and 1.5 cups water--- didn't want it to get too salty. I didn't strain it, and wouldn't want to, I liked the texture. As a matter of fact, I would consider only partially pureeing it. Will definitely make again!

This was a quick and easy recipe. Although it was tasty, I thought it was missing a little something so I added some fresh chopped mint, a little more salt and lemon zest. It was a great starter and the leftovers were even better the next day.

I had a sweet pea soup at a restaurant early last week that was superb and was excited to find this recipe. I was not disappointed, as this was delicious. I did need to add a second potato to achieve the creaminess I was looking for and I substituted chicken broth for the water. In addition to having great flavor and consistency, this was simple, quick, and healthy. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great soup for a side dish. It's not outstanding but it's a simple and enhancing side to many other things.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious and different from your typical pea soup because it uses fresh/frozen peas, not dried split peas, and no ham. It takes about 25 minutes to make, and you probably already have the ingredients in your pantry. Note: I replaced about 12 oz of the water with 12 oz of chicken broth.

I've made this soup a number of times and we always love it. It has a wonderful fresh pea taste. I sub chicken or vegetable broth for half of the water and top with a slice of goat cheese instead of the creme fraiche.

Made this for easter - subbed chicken broth for water & 1/2 snap peas. Everyone RAVED, and i felt good serving something healthy on a holiday. PS - made it a week before and froze it - texture colour and taste were unaffected.

Talk about easy! I wanted a day-after-Christmas soup to make with the leftover ham and this was better than perfect and took only 30 minutes to make, start to finish. I used only what I had in the cupboard for the soup; including one small can of beef broth, one small can of chicken broth and about 1 cup of water for the stock. No shallots, just diced yellow onion. I wish I had a carrot in the house because I would have added that, but the soup was still fantastic. I also added black pepper.

Oh PS to the previous review--we used a dilute boullion broth and omitted the salt. Careful or it could get too salty. I wouldn't use veggie broth or the color may come out "off".

Super easy, really fresh and yummy and super healthful--a definite keeper. I used an immersion blender as well and strained the soup but tasting before straining, it's not truly necessary. Using a blender would probabaly make straining a tad easier. I'm curious how this would be chilled and will find out soon! We preferred dollops to drizzles of the sour cream...

This soup was easy, quick, and excellent. I used an immersion blender to puree the soup and, like many other reviewers, skipped the straining step (out of time pressure). Two weeks later, I had an almost identical pea soup in a cafe, but it had been strained. The difference in texture is significant to the level of the soup's elegance, but not much else, so if you're making it for a casual dinner at home, skip the straining. With that having been said, this soup is fantastic, light, and fresh-tasting, but still thick enough to warm you up when it's cold out. Garnish with a bit of chopped mint, and your diners may end up licking their bowls clean.

Word the Wise: pea soup is definately not like Split pea soup. Pros: light, fresh, felt very healthy. Cons: bland, boring, too sweet.

Wow- this is excellent! I made it with half water, half chicken broth and it was fantastic. Straining through the seive was easy and created a silky, wonderful texture. Beautiful and rich.

I enjoyed this soup and would make it again because it is easy but I might make some changes next time like making it with broth instead of water and maybe adding a little pepper or something for more zing.

excellent, served it to my boyfriend and he loved it! I think some chunks of ham in it would make it more of a main course.

This was divine. I made it exactly according to the ingredients, but didn't send it through the sieve -- just let the food processor run with it for a couple of minutes. Yes, there's a texture to it, and if the queen were coming to dinner i'd probably strain it; but my 20 guests didn't even pause as they practically inhaled it. So the answer to A Cook from 5/5/03 is that you could probably use a food mill to good effect.

Not your average pea soup, this is elegant and delicious. To cook in Charlottesville - what pineapples???

Rating: 4
So easy, so good. Got a lot of things dirty (pot/bowl/blender/strainer), but as long as you have a willing dish-washer by your side, this is a breeze. Great to be able to make it the day before - As my dish-washer said, this will become a permanent part of our summer dinner party menu.

either use fresh pineapples or get a very good quality canned ones. The whole thing depends on that difference.

Very nice soup. Used small vidalia. But instead of water I used chicken stock. Added bacon. All in all a nice appetizer.

My questions was deleted... don't know why, I didn't rate the recipe or was rude. I am just wondering if using a food mill would achieve the same effect as blending and sieving... would appreciate anyone's opinion!

I've made this two times in the last two weeks - so simple, low-cal, perfect! A couple of tips to make it even easier if you're low on time or just want to use what you already have in the pantry: 1) instead of shallots, you can use 1 small onion (I used Vidalia) or 1/2 an large onion, 2) to speed things up, you can use canned peeled potatoes (you really won't miss the flavor of fresh in this recipe - the potato ends up just acting as a binding agent rather than a flavoring), 3) a little diced bacon on top is a tasty addition too, 4) do not skip the sieve step - it is important! otherwise, you end up with a chunky, less-than-pleasant to chew texture. If you force the soup through the sieve, you get such a wonderful creamy smoothness - delicious!!!

Love the subtle flavor. Not a pea lover. The straining gets rid of sharp taste.

Lovely soup. I used light sour cream and it didn't look as good (the cream seemed to separate and float around..) but it tasted fine. :)

Rating: 3
A quick, easy crowd pleaser, perfect for preparing the day before. Make sure to use a FINE sieve unless a thicker soup is desired. Avoid low-fat sour cream, as it is heavier than water and the artful presentation will sink to the bottom of the bowl.

I substituted Vidalia green onions (the white part) for the shallots and used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I skipped the step after blending and did not force it through the sieve - bad mistake! This step is important because the skins from the peas can become tough. I went back and completed this step - it had a lovely texture and tasted much better after sitting for a day or so - very fresh.

Very delicious soup! Just few days ago I tried in one very nice restaurant pea soup with bacon, so I though to add some bacon, too (60 gram = 2 oz) and it turned out just great! I did not have shallots, so I added just normal onions, no difference! The soup was so good that there would`nt been enough for 6 servings. Just me and my husband finished it amazingly quickly before the main course, and that means already something!

This soup was delicious- delicate and sweet- just what i was looking for on the first days of spring. I loved the coloras as well; it was beautiful in yellow and bright blue bowls. One nice addition is to garnish the soup with mint leaves- mint and peas go especially well together, I think. I also did not strain this soup and blended it with a handblender, and while not as elegant, it cut down the prep time and reduced the amount of dishes. A nice change from dreary split pea soup, esp. for vegetarians.
