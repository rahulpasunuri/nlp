No forks for this one. I only wish I'd read to the bottom of the reviews, because I ended up with a topping full of bitter oranges. I had to cook the fish twice as long because the topping kept the fish from cooking in the center. Perhpas the extra cooking time soured the oranges? No do-over for this family.

QUICK AND EASY!! I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the japs & plain diced tomato. Used a small can of mandarin oranges instead of tangerines. This dish had excellent flavor.

I have been looking for this recipe for 2 years. I used to make it with snapper or halibut - such an easy but impressive and quick weekday meal. I mixed in a little orange juice as well.

They were out of red snapper at the market, so I bought sea bass. I also bought something called a "moro orange" instead of a tangerine. With these substitutions, the dish was absolutely fantastic. The fresh salsa gives it an extra something -- I wouldn't dream of substituting salsa from a jar since the flavors were so special (and it only took about ten minutes to make). Served with spanish rice from a box and the zucchini with jalapeno monterey jack. The leftover salsa was great the next day with eggs, too.

I liked this recipe very much -- I actually do something very similar with salmon and also fish tacos. I make a salsa that consists of diced mango, avocado, red bell pepper, green/red onion, jalapeno, fresh cilantro, a clove of garlic, juice of two-three limes, salt and pepper. It's best if you make it ahead of time to allow the flavors to blend and it's a great topping for fish, chicken, and great on fish tacos! For fish tacos, grill some mahi mahi or even cod, add some thinly sliced cabbage, top with salsa and serve with lime wedges -- they're great, especially in the summer with grilled corn on the cob!

I was in a big hurry the night I made this. I took a look at the ingredients and one word came to mind..."Salsa" So I had some fresh-deli salsa from the grocery store, added habanero pepper, more onion, the orange (I also used seedless navel orange) and it was DELICIOUS. I also covered a small piece of salmon that I had with the salsa mixture, and it was just as delicious!

Light, fresh and EASY!! I used 1 navel orange, and it came out great. Next time I will use fresh tomatoes as well.

Another great week-night fish dish! I make this with snapper, salmon or rainbow trout. I appreciate a prior reviewer's suggestion to use mandarin oranges - they make it a snap to throw the salsa together quickly and get the dish in the oven.

Couldn't find mandarine oranges so I used a navel orange instead, and it was wonderful! A very quick and easy dish that is delicious!

I'm just putting the red snapper in the over and can only speculate as to how the finished dish will taste, but the "salsa" is delicious! I also like the fact that it is very light as we tend to eat very late dinners.

Nice, kind of bland.

Great fish recipe! My fiancee keeps asking for it. Used previous suggestions and substituted mandarin oranges for tangerines. Also, I used tilapia,which was nice.

We substituted the snapper with black drum and it was really yummy. It's so easy and fast, yet looks sophisticated. The fish was moist and tender. I will be making this over and over.

A simple and flavorful recipe. I substituted mandarian oranges for the tangerine and it turned out great. It has become a household favorite and it's great for a casual dinner with guests.

I was very disappointed in this meal. I agree with another reviewer that said that he would omit the tangerines - they made this meal so bitter that we could not even eat it. I think it would have been good withouth the tangerines - if I make it again, it will be minus the tangerines!

I stopped on the way home and picked up some fresh Snapper. My wife said we could feed four people with all that fish. Two of us ate and there was no leftover. Need I say more? Great quick recipe. Serve with a dry Reisling. Super!!!

The citrus was bitter and ruined the dish. I would only make it again without the tangerines.

Excellent and easy. I added more jalapeno than the recipe prescribed and it was delicious. The blend of the tangerine and jalapeno was excellent

This was excellent. Easy, healthy, fast, etc. Any firm non-oily fish will do. I used grouper.

This recipe had a very interesting flavor. It looked beautiful because of the orange and tomatoe and green items. It was SO easy to make. It is guest quality and would give you time to mingle with your guests instead of being bound to the kitchen. Definitely worth a try.
