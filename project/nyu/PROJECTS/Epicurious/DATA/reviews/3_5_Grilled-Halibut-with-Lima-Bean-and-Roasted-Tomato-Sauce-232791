My husband liked this better than I did. I had to cook the sauce ingredients nearly twice as long as indicated (30 minutes for the tomatoes, 15 minutes for the limas), and I still think the tomatoes could have stood more time in the hot oven. Still, the flavors are wonderful. My husband declared this dish to be "restaurant-quality," so I know that I'll be making it again.

I think this sauce would be great on lots of things! I used frozen limas. Rather than chop everything separately, I roughly pulsed the tomatoes and beans in a food processor, then pulsed in the basil, and finally stirred in the liquids and seasoning. I could not get fresh halibut, so I used cod.

meh. Something was not right with that sauce. The lima beans took way longer than 6-8 minutes to cook and were really dry and mushy and shelling them was virtually impossible and painstaking. THey kept falling apart! And why 2lbs? That is WAY too much lima beans. Those guys are big! I have a giant tupperware filled with lima beans now - I'll be eating them for a week. I did like the taste of the roasted tomatoes and garlic but all in all i was not super impressed. I made a different kind of fish but I`m sure the halibut would have been tasty had it not been impossible to find at a reasonable price.

Such a fresh and tasty dish. I added extra garlic and some chopped shallot to kick it up a bit and wound up sauteing the fish instead of grilling. Really easy and looked beautiful too.

I can't imagine how you could mess this recipe up. I didn't have much time when I started this, so used bought roasted red peppers instead of tomato, did not peel the beans after cooking, and cooked the fish in a skillet on top of the stove. It was fabulous! Next time, I'll start earlier and make it as described, though I can't imagine it being any better than my corrupted version.

I doubled the garlic in the tomatoes and it made a really nicely flavored sauce with the beans. Added extra beans too so the sauce was sort of a side dish. Very nice on the grilled fish (we didn't use halibut, but it was good anyway).

Made this using fresh lima beans and some purple basil from a local farmer's market. Also had the great luck of having some really fresh halibut. (which I cooked in a grill pan). Excellent and look forward to making again with a readers suggestion of corn. Great fresh ingredients is the key here.

Excellent dish for any kind of firm white fish (halibut, cod, etc.). Simple and healthy ingredients. Bold flavor. Adaptable for different legumes (lima beans ,fava, edamme, etc.) Really good.

Great recipe, I smoked/grilled the tomatoes on a cedar plank which added a nice touch. Really enjoyed it.

Simple, fresh-tasting and delicious. But what could be less than delicious that includes fava beans? Italian tomatoes roast better, being less watery. Don't chop them up too fine, big chunks are better and same things with the fava beans which I left whole.

We made this last night and loved it. This is the 2nd time preparing this dish. The roasted tomato sauce is great. I used plum tomatoes, and roasted them a little longer than recommend as they were large. Had to sub Seabass for the halibut and I didn't like it as much. Hubby loved it.

Amazing! Good, fresh halibut on the grill is of course delicious and only needs the salt and pepper to season it perfectly. The sauce to top it was absolutely fantastic and everyone at the dinner party raved about it. I used frozen edamame, and it was refreshing and delightful - the fresh basil really made the difference. One question though: is the step requiring you to peel the skins off all the beans really necessary? I did it but it's rather a pain.

I found this to be a mess of a dish. The "roasted" tomatoes ended up just being a soggy goo once chopped (even after coring) and slopping on the tomatoes with lima beans over a tasteless halibut, is just wrong on so many fronts. Avoid.

We loved this recipe. We used edamame & plum tomatoes. Just delicious!

This recipe was delicious. I used edamame and cooked the fish on the stovetop in a grill pan. I served pine nut cous cous with it. Everyone loved it.

This recipe was delicious. I used edamame as well at it was perfect. I cooked it on the stove top in a grill pan. Also served pine nut cous cous. Everyone loved this.

Loved this recipe. I used edamame beans and thought they were lovely. I had to make the fish inside rather than grilling it. Outside would probably been better but this still worked out.

I save 4 forks for dishes that blow me away - but this was close. I love simple, good for you, easy to make foods. This was so easy and so yummy. I had everything on hand, I just needed a great recipe to go with my fish. I sub'd edamame beans for lima because I'm a big fan and it came out great. Love the suggestion to roast plum tomatoes in the winter.

Outstanding "go-to" recipe for ease of preparation and elegant presentation. Instead of using out of season tomatoes, I substituted oven roasted plum tomatoes. Excellent result. If only halibut was as easy to find as this dish is to make. Aside tip: oven roasting plum tomatoes is the only way to get through the winter tomato offerings at your grocery. And, it's so easy: slice plum tomatoes lengthwise, toss with xvoo and s&p. Bake 3 hrs at 300 degrees. Will keep in refrig at least a week. yum yum.

Delicious! Rivals any seafood dish you would find at a restaurant-very flavorful. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was really good! My husband loved it and easy too. I did add fresh cut corn to make a lima bean, tomato and corn sauce.

I substituted a vidalia onion(quartered) for two of the garlic cloves and it was really delicious.
