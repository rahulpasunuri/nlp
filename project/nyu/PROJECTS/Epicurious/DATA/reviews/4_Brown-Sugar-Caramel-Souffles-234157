Served these for New Years' Eve and they were a BIG hit. My son and daughter-in-law had recommended the recipe,and it was perfect for an elegant finish and easy to make as we were waiting for the "bewitching hour".

Good. The flavor was great, caramel is yummy. Texture is interesting...sort of spongy.

Extremely easy to make and WOW they were delicious! I used custard cups for individual servings (I cook for 1-2 people). I know I wasn't perfect on the recipe since I cut it down for 2 servings, but the texture was perfect in the cooking time prescribed. LOVE LOVE LOVE these! (Actually licked the bowls...)

I made this for my picky eater sons and they loved it. They now say they still don't like caramel, but they like homemade caramel sauce!

The flavor of these was really good. However, never having made or eaten a souffle before, I couldn't tell if they were done. The top was puffed, but not terribly browned after 11 minutes, so I baked it a little longer, then took them out. They were very soft and a little runny in the center, but the tops and sides were a little more "done" seeming. Will have to go get a souffle at a restaurant so I can get a gauge for doneness, then do these again! Very easy to make.

This was SO good and very easy. I had to restrain myself from eating two.

I'll have to admit...I was skepical about making these because I'm a huge chocolate souffle fan, but they are wonderful! The caramel sauce makes the dessert. I'll definitely make them again.
