I love artichokes but this is a little more complicated then it needs to be. Also there is nothing in the liquid to emulsify.

Used a non-reactive pan and really fresh organic artichokes, plus a combination of lemons and limes to get the level of tartness I enjoy. The resulting artichokes were beautiful but bitter. Could it be the crop? I've never encountered such bitterness in artichokes.

Somewhat underwhelmed with this recipe. The mint and lemon did mildly flavor the chokes, but it wasn't anything impressive.

It always seems that artichokes never taste as good at home as I expect them to be, but this recipe proved to be bright and flavorful. If you like lemon, you'll love the reduction!

If this was easier to make, I'd give it 4 forks because it's flavorful, beautiful, fresh, healthy and wonderful both hot and cold. I made it 3 days ahead and kept it in the fridge marinated. I warmed it in the oven, covered and served it as the main vegetable with the Gourmet, April 2009 Cornish Hens. It was perfect.. The only problem is cleaning 8 jumbo artichokes is time consuming and rough on your thumbs! I'd eat them in a heartbeat but not looking forward to cleaning them again, though I would.
