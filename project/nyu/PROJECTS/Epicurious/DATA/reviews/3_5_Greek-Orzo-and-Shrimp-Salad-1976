A show stopper at a dinner party. I served it with recipes from this site "Halibut with Grapefruit Beurre Blanc Sauce" (Feb 2002) and "Green Beans with Lemon and Pine Nuts" (Nov 2005). To add more colour, a simple plate of sliced tomato and avocado, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled with chopped fresh basil. Dinner was a complete success.

I have been making this recipe since I received that issue of Bon Appetit in 1994. It is easy & wonderful.

I thought this was good, but not delicious (i.e. 2 vs 3 forks). I think that it needs a flavor kick - perhaps some capers or a saltier feta (I used French feta which does not have as much sodium as domestic feta).

This is a great salad to accompany a rack of lamb. Got your orzo and all the veggies saving time. I added red onion and black olives to complete the Greek Salad feeling.

This is a great dish to pass at summer parties. and yes use very good olive oil. This is the fourth time making this recipe, so in my book it is definitely a keeper.

Easy and oh, so delicious this time of year with fresh dill, cukes, and tomatoes in the garden. I made a third of the recipe, and it is a huge amount, but no one minds esting this for leftovers. It just gets better. Of course, use the BEST quality olive oil possible for this salad.

I'm rating this 4 forks because my guests always remember and request this recipe. It is delicious when made with top-quality olive oil, feta, shrimp, and tomatoes; I found that run-of-the-mill supermarket ingredients don't really cut it for this dish.

I cut this recipe in half as I was serving three large appetites and I had 2 servings left over. It's not as good as the Shrimp Pasta Salad (Jan 1994) also on this site so I won't bother making it again.

I've made this dish several times, though I usually reduce it by 1/3. It always gets rave reviews. I often increase the amount of the lemon juice for additional flavor and reduce the olive oil a bit. Make sure you use good shrimp!

Tried it on a family gathering this weekend and it was a big hit. I used basil instead of dill because that's what I have in my garden. I would also add more lemon juice next time to give it more zip. But really, it was delicious.

I made this for a baby shower (along with other salads). It was light, simple and delicious with great fresh flavors. I strongly disagree with commenters who thought this needed something else. I made it exactly as is. The lemon, dill, and feta cheese make a nice blend. Make sure to use fresh ingredients! However, to save time I starting with peeled and cooked shrimp which worked.

I was diappointed with this recipe. It was quite bland so I added a bit of white wine vinegar to the dressing - it helped but I still wouldn't make it again.

This was a great recipe, made it for an office party, and it was a smash hit. I used roma tomatoes instead of cherry, and a feta cheese with sundried tomatoes. I'll be sure to make it again!

My guests and I thought this was very tasty. I used only fresh ingredients, and I think that helped. I also added some extra fresh lemon juice and olive oil just before serving. This is a nice change for a summer party.

This was a good make ahead entree for a summer party. It was a little bland so I added flavored white wine vinegar. Maybe better quality, saltier feta would have helped, possibly the kind sold flavored with herbs. Guests gave favorable reviews.

I was a little disappointed in this dish. It sounded great but turned out to be fairly bland. I'm not sure what would work, but it definitely needs some pepping up!

I have made this recipe many,many times. It is perfect just the way it is. It always gets great reviews and is a refreshing change from the typical macaroni and potatoe salads of summer.
