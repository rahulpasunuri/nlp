I also used a mandoline and used less cream (poured 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half n half into a ziplock bag so as to let the potato slices soak up the cream). I too used the Reggiano but added fresh basil leaves and fresh garlic (minced). I poured the remaining cream from the zip lock bag over the top once all layering was complete. The house smelled heavenly!

Great dish. I did as at least one other suggested, and made this according to the really Trotter recipe and not this "adapted" version which is really just a basic au gratin. If you start early enough, you can even do this the same day and it's not that hard. Use a mandolin to get the potatoes right. The recipe doesn't specify thickness, but if you get them too thick they won't be cooked through which would basically ruin the dish, so I did them as thin as possible on the mandolin. It doesn't specify type of potato but I used russet. Most importantly I used Reggiano which is much more flavorful and less salty than domestic versions. I did add some dried sage (to the cream) along with a bit of marjoram and I salt and peppered the cream. As others suggested I also added about 2/3 of the cream to the dish before baking. The results were heavenly! I'm sure the dish as is would be fine, but taking the extra steps to press, chill, cut and saute it really added that extra umph! Time consuming but not difficult. A big hit at my Christmas dinner!

I love this recipe and have used it for years as a side to salmon,beef, and chicken. It's so delicious--no other potato dish compares to it. My family loves it as well. Leftovers (heated) are wonderful for breakfast with scrambled eggs and salsa-either on the eggs or on the potatoes.

This was a simple, delicious way to prepare potatoes...sliced them very thin with a mandoline..nice presentation when served...very nice flavor and texture.

I added italian parsley to the recipe and it gave it a great flavor. I served it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. This time I am adding colored potatoes to it to give it some color.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving this year and it was wonderful. I cut back on the cream and used about half the recommended quantity. However, I used a freshly grated mix of Parmesan-Reggiano cheese instead of plain Parmesan and perhaps that't what made it more flavorful. It is simple and delish and I'll definitely make it again.

I used 2 full cups of parmesan cheese rather than the 1/2 cup. It was pretty good but nothing more than a potato au gratin. As a left over--not bad.

I only gave 2 forks because I added caramalized onions and chopped fresh sage for more flavor (along with the cream as others had mentioned). Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving. I agree with some reveiwers that it could be bland w/out. However, with the additions, it was 3 forks!

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was a hit. It was the most simple recipe of all the dishes I prepared....quick, delicious, good for a big crowd. The only thing that turned me off about this dish was how fattening it is! I'm no calorie counter but wow this one is really jam packed.

I did not like this dish much at all. However, I must admit before continuing my review that part of my opinion may be because of a major mishap in the preparation. I used sea salt which somehow reacted with my potatoes and turned them BLACK (?iodine and starch)??? I have never experienced this before. My sister-in-law, however, was certain that this did not alter the taste. In any case, I found the dish much too heavy and rather tasteless. Perhaps adding more Parmesan would have helped. I had made this in lieu of mashed potatoes for thanksgiving, however I think I will stick to my garlic mashed potatoes (much more flavorful and also more healthy!) in the future.

This is NOT a "pave" it is a potato gratin. Yes, epicurious does say that this is "adapted" from Charlie Trotter but it is never a pave. A pave is pressed and chilled and then sliced and reheated - it is a full day process and is wonderful. This recipe is disappointing only for that reason. Do a search on Trotters potato pave and you will find the proper way to do it and it is a simple but rewarding dish.

This has become one of our favorite dishes. We don't always have a potato dish but when we have a special meal or entertain, what an impressive dish and SO SIMPLE too ! I like to add a little garlic as well for a burst of flavour. Yumm

Awesome and simple, the best of both worlds! For those of you who have tried Charlie Trotter's other recipes, this one is refreshingly easy for any cook with results of a master chef. The added cream is a must, as other cooks have mentioned.

I also poured some of the cream back into the dish. I made this for an office Thanksgiving party, and everyone loved it! In fact, since then it's popped up at more than one dinner or office function!

Liked this very much and was easy to make with food processor. I added back in half the cream and next time would probably add all of it. Served with grilled steak and green salad with chocolate cake for dessert. Yum!

Very good! I fixed these as our Thanksgiving potatoes - everyone raved! I actually gave out the recipe to guests as they were going to serve them for Christmas. I did add much more parmesan that the recipe asked for - turned out wonderful!! Will definitely be a staple in our home!

This was the most delicious potato dish I ever made. All my guests really enjoyed it. I did had the cream in the dish to bake it.

I thought this dish was fabulous! I made it for Thanksgiving, and my family thought it was a great alternative to the ordinary mashed potatoes! I didn't add the cream back in to the casserole, and it seemed to be moist enough to us. Even better, it actually improves with age (leftovers were great)!

I wish I would have followed the advice of the other cook and added the cream, or at least a portion of it. The potatoes were too dry without it. There are too many other great potato recipes to make this average one again!

This dish was really delicious. I didn't know what to do with the 3 cups cream after I soaked the potatoes, so I added them back to the casserole. Very luxurious! Everyone loved it.
