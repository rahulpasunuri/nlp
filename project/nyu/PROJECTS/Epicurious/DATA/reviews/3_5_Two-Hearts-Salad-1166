When serving as a side dish for Christmas menus, add 1/2 cup chopped, diced green olives stuffed with pimientos. Terrific salad for palmito and carciofi lovers.

Its interesting. I thought this salad was just okay but my guests loved it! Made as part of a valentine's day theme. Definitely easy but if making again would incorporate some of the suggestions Like chopped red onions, parsley, olives, pine nuts sound good etc.

Quick, easy, dice ingredients 24 hrs. ahead, mix and marinate four hours before serving, OK to omit lettuce and tomatoes, lovely side dish salad for an outdoor picnic/cookout. Imperative fresh lemon juice and good quality olive oil be used.

Excellent and easy. Good enough for company, and quick to put together. I like the addition of black olives and parsley; they add interest without being too assertive. I think the reviewer who wanted to add Nutella is putting us on, or else a real Nutella "nut".

This recipe is a good idea, but needs a little kick to make it great. Replace the lemon juice, which is bitter, with seasoned rice vinegar. If you have flavored (any flavor) seasoned rice vinegar, that's even better. Add to the salad sliced black olives, thinly sliced red onion and chopped parsley. Chopped fresh basil is also a nice addition. When made this way it's really delicious and a refreshing go-with for any meal.

We recently had a family get-together and this salad was brought by our cousin. It's beautiful and delicious! Everyone loved it. It's a recipe that I would include on any buffet or to take to a potluck.

My husband and I love this salad. I make it every year for Valentine's day. We place it in the center of the table on a decorative platter, and share it. It has become part of our Valentine's Day tradition!

I've used many recipes containing art hearts and hearts of palm, although I thoroughly enjoyed this one!!

This is a great salad that is very simple to prepare in advance. Very tangy - you may want to add less mustard, taste, and then add more to your liking. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and used romaine leaves instead of butter lettuce.

I thought the mustard dressing was much too strong. I don't think I would make this again, even with more lemon juice.

This is a wonderful recipe and very easy to make. The only change I made was to add 1 teaspoon more lemon juice. This is now one of my family's favorite salads.
