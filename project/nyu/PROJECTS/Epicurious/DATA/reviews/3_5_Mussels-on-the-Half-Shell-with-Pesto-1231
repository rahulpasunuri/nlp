I made these last year for a holiday party with 50 people. Rave reviews. So much that I made them again for Christmas Eve (leftover pesto). Planning on making them again. Nice to have a recipe that can be made in advance. I also like to soak my mussels in milk to clean and plump them. If you're worried about the sand, that should solve the problem.

Sounds to me like the disappointed NYC cook did not get mussels from a good fishmonger and/or did not clean them properly.

I've been making this app since it came out in Feb '96, largely because I get requests for it! Very tasty & beautiful presentation. Also easy to eat at a cocktail party.

I have served these many times and always get great comments and requests for the recipe. I have served them as appetizers and taken them to parties...there are never any left!

I made these for company last week. It was pretty bad. I thought I cleaned these mussels well but stil some of them had sand and broken shells.... Flavor wasn't that great either. I was very embrassed by this dish.

We've served this several times in the past year and are always asked for the recipe -- delicious! Can be served at room temp or heated.
