There are some light flavors, yet the olive oil has a strong presence. Unlike the other reviewers, I wouldn't say this is a light dish. I make this dish often and follow the recipe. Quick, easy and tasty.

Perfect summer pasta with grilled shrimp and veggies. Since the 'sauce' IS so light you must absolutely use great pasta.

This was alright. I thought it needed some sort of tomato presence!

This was light and delicious. We omitted the anchovy and went heavier on parmesan and garlic. It was great as a weekday main dish or as a side for a heavier, more formal dinner.

This is a nice, light pasta dish. Since the flavors are not overpowering, I think it would be better eaten during the warm summer months.
