Great after tweaking... I adjusted the amounts of a few items and they turned out great. Very fluffy and a bit sweeter than the originals. Everyone loved them! Adjusted amounts were; 3T sugar, 3/4t salt, 1 c whipped cream, baked at 435*F 12-14 minutes

This is a good basic recipe for sweet buscuits but it does need "tweakin". The buscuits did not rise as much as I wanted, so I doubled the amount of baking powder. This improved the fluffiness of the buscuits.

i did not like this recipe. all who tried it before me had sucess and liked their biscuits yet when i made them i ended with a bitter biscuit. the texture was fine and at first the flavor is good but the biscuits them are to bitter for any meal or dish. i will never makes these biscuits again.

Oh my! Like others, tossed all into processor, had biscuits in 15 mins. Light, v. flaky. Yes, small, so used a larger spoon to drop them -- wonderful.

I added in a 1/2 cup of polenta for added texture and flavor, reducing the flour to 1 1/4 cups. I used half and half instead of whipping cream. I also used a food processor to produce the "course meal" texture--much faster, and made them bigger than the mini size (about 2 inches in diameter). They don't need to be cut out; I simply dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet. I baked them for 15 min. They were terrific!

I'm a little unsure of these, mostly because of the size. They are cute and they taste quite good, however, I wonder about the usefullness of the size. I originally made them to serve with a stew-like dish, but decided they were too small. Will try again, but as a bigger size - has anyone done that?

These were super easy and tie with my Mema's recipe for my favorite biscuits. They are super simple, but I made them more so by throwing everything, except the cream, into my food processor, mixing until course meal formed, then I poured in half and half (I was out of cream) and pulsed until the dough formed into a loose ball. I then took teaspoon-fulls of the dough and dropped them onto a cookie sheet. Cooked them the instructed 10 minutes and they were perfect!

My sister loves it when I make these for her! I just wish they weren't so tiny.

When ever I bake these biscuits, they're gone before they cool off! I haven't had to tweek this recipe at all! I bake them for gift baskets with homemade preserves and requests for the recipe always come back.

Good, flaky biscuits with just a hint of sweetness. Cute too.

these biscuits are super easy and very tasty. a word of caution: they are VERY mini. you can't make them much wider than the recipe calls for, though, because they don't rise enough to keep the proportion correct. i made a batch and froze them before baking. excellent.

I used this many times recipe since I found it in a 1980's Bon Appetit -- then lost it! I am so happy to have found it again on Epicurious~~ My next brunch will feature these.
