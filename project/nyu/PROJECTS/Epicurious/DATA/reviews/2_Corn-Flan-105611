It is possible that a person who has no taste buds at all, or the ability to imagine how something will taste when ingredients are blended together - will find this to be an acceptable recipe. To mix maple syrup with tarragon is simply stupid. Might as well put garlic and maple syrup on your corn cakes.

Great w/ a main dish that has an ancho chili sauce.
