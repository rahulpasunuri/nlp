I followed this recipe to the letter and the "sticks" melted in the oven so I ended up with crackers instead. There's definitely something wrong in the cheese to flour ratio.

I agree with the reader from Vancouver Island, the ratio of butter and cheese to flour is way too high - I think the idea is good, so will just try adding pimento to my regular recipe which has 2 cups flour to 1/2 lb each cheese & butter.

I would make this again with changes as I liked the pimento touch, but they are too time consuming to roll into sticks (that don't stay into sticks). I would add a bit more flour and drop by spoon for a better shape. They spread too thin and broke easily. I followed your recipe exactly. My own cheese straws are much better!
