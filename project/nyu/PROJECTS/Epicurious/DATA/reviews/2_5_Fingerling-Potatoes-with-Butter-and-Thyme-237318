I did not love these. I much prefer just oven roasted.

Loved these. I used dried thyme and a pinch of rosemary. Rolled the cooked potatoes in the pan juices from a seared pork tenderloin before finishing in oven. Great.

Very disappointing, really couldn't taste the thyme.

This is my adjustment: Boil the potatoes with dried thyme and salt until tender. Then broil in oven at 400 degrees with butter and fresh thyme until warm in the middle and crispy on the outside.

I agree with the review below. I followed the recipe and they just tasted like fingerling potatoes.

These were ok - by following the recipe, they were cooked perfectly, but just tasted like potatoes, no hint of the thyme or butter. Next time, I might toss with butter after cooking.

How much simpler could this be? I slow-simmered the taters for about 25 min and they were creamy and perfect. Great side.

This was very good and, obviously, very easy. I was surprised at the wonderful flavor of the potatoes with such simple ingredients. I added an extra sprig of thyme and a small sprig of rosemary, and I simmered the potatoes for 20 minutes rather than 10, having found that they were still quite firm after 10. I will definitely make this again for a simple weeknight sidedish.
