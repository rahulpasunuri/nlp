I have avoided turkey cutlets and this recipe has made me a fan. I served it with brown rice and it was great. Will make it again.

This was awesome!!! No oil used, I used high heat Pam. Leftover basmati rice for my husband and served with warm corn tortillas, couldn't ask for anything better. Took about an hour to put together after work.

Very good recipe. However, the chile powder created a harsh smoke when it hit the pan and made everyone in the house cough. We don't have a fan that vents outside. Surprised no one has mentioned this. Maybe the pan was too hot? Will try putting the pan on the grill next time.

This has been a regular in my rotation for a few years now. My husband and I both love it. Flavorful and delicious. Colorful and makes a lovely presentation. I'll definately continue making it over and over.

I used this recipe to inspire another variation. Instead of using chipotle powder, i marinated the breasts in a chipotle adobo paste i made (you can buy the chiles in adobo sauce in the mexican section of the food store). Instead of serving with tortillas, I stacked the turkey and salsa onto some arepas with queso fresco and added a black bean sauce I made with the adobo paste. add some lime seasoned crema and you've got a fantastic meal! yum!

I'd give this a B or a B+. I had turkey Breasts vice filets, so I sliced them in half to get something that would cook up in 90 seconds per side. Used corn I'd sliced from the cob on Labor Day and then frozen. Seemed to take a long time to char, would probably use prepackaged frozen corn next time. Enough of the chipotle powder was left in the the pan to infuse the bell peppers with a very nice flavor. And adding lime wedges does pull it together nicely at the end.

Very good and easy to prepare. The charred corn salsa adds a nice touch.

This was wonderful (and easy). I used what our local turkey provider calls "turkey steaks." (I may never know if these are the same as "cutlets" or "breast fillets" but it didnt matter because the recipe worked perfectly and tasted great.) I'd never seen the word "char" used in a recipe and couldn't find a helpful definition online so I simply sauted the thawed corn. The fresh cilantro and lime is crucial. I served with tortillas but it would also be good with rice instead.

This was really easy and yummy!

Make it fresh -- it's August so we used fresh corn, cut from cob, and poblano chilies (instead of bell pepper) from the garden. Great new summer flavor. It needed a little sauce to pull it together. We drizzled creme fraiche; could use sour cream to balance heat of chilies.

This is a keeper. The chipotle chile powder was a first for me, and it was great. I combined it with salt and seasoned the cutlets overnight. The salsa was refreshing, I think that is due to the use of corn oil. Also, my cutlets were pretty thin so a little less than a minute on each side to cook them perfectly.

fantastically simple and tasty! my first time making turkey cutlets and my bf has already asked me to make it again. i served this with the black bean and rice salad from this site. i also made pork cutlets using this same rub, and they came out very nicely as well.

Delicious and easy! The chipotle gives the dish a great smoky flavor.

This came together so quickly, it was just what I needed! My stupid grocery store didn't have the turkey (I was looking for breast slices), so I used thin-sliced chicken breast instead. Added one chipotle pepper w/about 1 T. adobo sauce to the pepper-onion-corn mixture. If you like a little extra spice, I would recommend it, really brought the flavors together. My 17-yr. old son ("chicken again?") THANKED me for dinner... Served with steamed rice and sauteed zucchini. YUM!

We love this dish. I use chicken tenders (from Costco) defrosted, and I double the salsa. I use a mix of red/green peppers, that I purchase! This can be made in 15 mins. I serve with a platter of fresh fruit.

This recipe has become a favorite weeknight standby at my house...it's easy, with lots of flavor - the lime ad chipotle combination is great. I served with sweet potatoes whipped with a little butter and one clove of roasted garlic.

A really great dish, one that's unique and delicious! I used lemon juice in place of lime, and Chinese chili powder instead of chipoltle. Would be wonderful w/ chicken, fish or steak, as well.

Quick, Easy, and delicious - my husband loved the (not overpowering) spice. I served it with Tortillas and he made sandwiches. We had extra salsa left over - which was so good I ate it with a spoon!

This was very tasty! Used turkey tenderloins. The chipotle chilli powder is delicious and the flavors go together very nicely. Although it was a bit of a pain to shift ingredients in and out of the pan, I will definitely make this again.

This was Great!! It tasted as good as it looked. I concur with the cook from Lynbrook, NY.

Three out of four of us thought this recipe was great. My youngest thought it was too spicy. Good mid-week meal as the number of ingredients is small and it is quick and easy to prepare. As others said, the chipotle powder is essential to a good result.

Easy and delicious - just the way it is written. Try this - you won't be disappointed!

I made this for my parents and we really liked it. My father was on a strict low-sodium diet, so it was nice to find something so good that he could eat. The chipotle chili powder is definitely the key (an ingredient that I've also used on flank steak). I'll make this again for friends.

Delicious recipe, which I would definitely make again. My turkey came out a little dry, so next time I would marinate it for awhile prior to cooking. Chipotle chili powder was perfect. I served it with LOTS of lime wedges, which were the perfect compliment

Interesting twist for a turkey dish. The chipotle chile powder was the key. Tasted great and was easy.
