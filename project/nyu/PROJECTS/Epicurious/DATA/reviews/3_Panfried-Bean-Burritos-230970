They have burritto `fastfood` here in the UK. It`s taken them a while. They have only appeared during rhe past few years. Ever since I ate burritos in San Francisco thye have been one of my favourite dishes. The ones I make at home are a litle of this and a little of that. Have to try your recipe it looks taste provoking!

This was good, my husband and kids loved. It seems ridiculously easy to be in Gourmet magazine...I added cilantro to the salsa and we had sour cream on the side, some even mixed them together. Really good salsa. Enjoy the burritos overall and super easy and quick.

Boring and gross. Used a different salsa per reviews. Tasted like Del Taco.

These have become a staple in our house. Part of the key is sufficiently blackening the veggies to get that smokiness. I also add two chilis and the zest of the lime as well as the juice to the salsa. And in winter months I use a pint of grape tomatoes since other types rarely have any flavor except when they are in season.

This was a good weeknight meal to make. The salsa did need the cilantro suggested by the other reviewers, and I used one whole pepper to get it to just slightly spicy -- I will use more the next time I make it. I also used whole pinto beans that I heated in the pan I had used to blacken the tomatoes, onions and peppers in, rather than refried beans. It was hard to fold the burritos up without the stuff inside falling out, but all in all, it was a very enjoyable dinner and one that I will surely repeat.

i think it would be fabulous with fresh peppers and red onion, the beans and roasted veg were a bit mushy for my taste. i agree w. previous reviewer, the salsa was a bit weak, cilantro is a must next time. great base recipe, something basic, but new to experiment with! i have never pan fried burritos berfore!

These burritos are fabulous!!! Crunchy tasty burritos, much better then the frozen versions sold at the grocery. The salsa was weak, next time I'll add cilantro.
