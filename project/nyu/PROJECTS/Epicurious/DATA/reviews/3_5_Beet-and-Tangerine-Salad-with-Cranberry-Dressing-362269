One of our favourite salads.I make it exactly as the recipe says.

Made as written except our grocery does not carry cranberry and so substituted orange concentrate. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either. It didn't let the flavor of the beets come through very well and the watercress was a little too radishy for a good flavor combination. I love red beets and won't be making this again.

I am amazed when someone gives the recipe 4 forks, but uses totally different ingredients. I added blue cheese to this recipe to balance out the blandness of the salad. The dressing doesn't have much zing.

We loved the salad dressing on this salad for our Christmas Eve dinner. We did substitute avocado for beets because we were having another beet dish (the traditional one we couldn't do without) and added pomagranate seeds on top. It was tasty and beautiful. We all loved the result so much, we are going to serve this recipe as written with the beets for our Valentine's dinner.

I've made several variations of this salad and always love it -- it's so easy to tweak. Try using navel oranges, Pomegranate Molasses instead of the cranberry concentrate and arugula or spinach instead of the watercress.

This was a beautiful addition to our Christmas dinner and received high praise from the guests. The beauty was in the individual players which married together quite nicely. With other complex flavors at the table it was nice to have these refreshing elements. (I was lucky to get really nice tangerines and watercress! Hooray for my local co-op.)

made this for Christmas with my family and it was quite a hit. used a little orange in the dressing and added a bit of garlic to it as well. Also added goat cheese, like others, and it really was what made the salad. Also couldn't get watercress at the small grocery store near my parents cabin, so used arugula which gave it some extra spice. Definitely will be made again.

Thought it was a very tasty weeknight salad, not a salad for company or a holiday.

Pretty good, not great. I used oranges instead and served on baby greens. Does need a little something extra, perhaps blue or goat cheese per other reviews. Made for a nice light starter for Thanksgiving dinner.

This recipe gets a zero knife because after all the work that one puts into it, the salad comes out tasting very bland. FLAVOR! That's what we're looking for in our food, Bon Appetit! As for marrying beets with red onions, it's a match made in hell. And for zesting tangerines, how soigne! If you're still intrigued about this salad, I suggest using a nice, flavorful vinaigrette with finely chopped shallots (forgo the stupid frozen cranberry juice), not tossing the beets with the rest of the ingredients, but tucking them in the last, and adding a bit of salt to the dressing and a bit of salt into the bowl for the greens before incorporating the other elements.

I will definitely make this again but I would add cheese (goat or maybe blue). It was good but just needed a tad bit of something else and it think cheese would do it.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. I placed the ingredients atop pieces of bibb lettuce for individual servings and garnished with the watercress. I also added crumbled goat cheese which I thought was a perfect addition to the ingredients. Light, fresh and delicious. It makes a very colorful, visually pleasing dish as well.

Made this last night and my whole family thought it was great even though I cheated on several aspects. I bought precooked beets from Trader Joe's (can be found in the vegie section) and used canned mandarin oranges. I didn't have the cranberry concentrate so used OJ. Even with these shortcuts, we loved it.
