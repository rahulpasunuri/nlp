I did not have horseradish in stock so I used Wasabi Horseradish. This was so very good and easy to make!

We are a vegtable eating family, but this salad just didn't seem to get eaten. Everyone agreed that the sour cream was not a good mix maybe buttermilk or yogurt would be better..the horseradish seemed fine and added a new flavor.

Very good for a horseradish crowd. Don't even need to use cucumbers...you can slather this mixture over anything and it would tast great

Exceptional simple recipe, although care must be used in choosing the correct horseradish, mild prepared horseradish is perfect.

I liked this recipe, very strong horseradish presence, which I liked, but I could see how some people may think it was too overpowering, you could make this using half the recommended horseradish and still have a nice, tangy, cucumber salad.

Horseradish adds a refreshing twist to this classic.

Tastes great with fresh cracked pepper. I might use plain yogurt in the future in place of the sour cream because it was a overwhelmingly rich. I would take down the horseradish to 1 or 2 tablespoons.
