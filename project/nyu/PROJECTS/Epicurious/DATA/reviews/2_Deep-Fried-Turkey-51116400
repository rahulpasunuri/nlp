We made this for Thanksgiving and were very disappointed. The skin came out charred . We fried at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. It must have been the sugar in the brine that caused the charring. The meat was fine but nothing special. I will not make it again.

So the recipe says to brine for 24 hours but the description at the top says to brine for 36 hours. Which one is it? This really needs to be cleared up as Thanksgiving is only days away
