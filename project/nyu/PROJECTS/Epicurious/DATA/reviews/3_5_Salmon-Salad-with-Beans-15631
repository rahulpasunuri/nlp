I was looking for a yummy way to use up grilled salmon leftoves, and VOILA! Tasted it before adding the fresh parsley, basil and olives and it was kinda so-so. The fresh herbs and the saltiness of the olives added zing and just enough flavour. Next time I am going to throw the tomatoes into my grill pan on the bbq and roast them until they are just starting to split and see how that goes.

Delicious! I used steamed thin fresh green beans, a small fresh tender onions and raw red pepper,it was crunchy, tasty and still very good the next day!The greens I used were only lettuce and the leaves of the beets.Do try that it is lovely!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly (never can!), but used it to inspire my own salad thrown together w/similar leftover ingredients: feta stuffed salmon roast, taboulleh salad, plain french lentils and rice. This was too dry, so I added a mixture of lemon juice, mustard, and cream cheese - that is what was at hand. Served over a bed of lettuce and w/ buttered toast. Made a great lunch - enjoyed by all except my little salmon hater.

Ugh -- horrible; a gloopy, tasteless mess.

I have tried several recipes from this site and, while I've enjoyed most of the dishes, never have I felt compelled to review them. That is until now. I absolutely loved this dish. It was scrumptious and satisfying, yet not too filling. Like most of the reviewers, I did alter the recipe somewhat. For example, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. Also, in the absence of shallots, I used red onion. I also served it on a bed of greens with a little balsamic and garlic vinaigrette drizzled over the top. Absolutely delightful.

I made this wonderful salad to use grilled salmon that was too dry to reheat. Taking a hint from another reviewer, I adjusted the lemon juice and oil ratio, so I had twice as much lemon juice. I omitted the parsley but other than that followed the recipe. I made 1/4 and mixed the seafood and bean mixture in with the spring mix for a filling lunch salad. Healthy, zesty, and tangy, the salad will be in my weekly menu rotation while I have fresh herbs and leftover salmon.

I have been on a very rigid detox diet for the past week and today was my last day. I was soo happy to have chosen this recipe for lunch. I had all of the ingredients except tomatoes and basil. What I used instead was salsa fresca (from Whole Foods) and then also added mushrooms, celery and kalamata olives. The combo of flavors was excellent and refreshing. Lastly, to "beef" up the salad I added long grain brown Texmati rice. Definitley a filling meal.

This receipe rocks! I made it last nite (doubling the receipe) for a bunch of friends. They loved it! The oranges I bought weren't very sweet, so I substituted dried cranberrys - there were no leftlovers!

We did like this, but did not love it. The dressing was definately lacking. We thought perhaps the roasted peppers could be pureed with the oil, lemon, and basil and this would make this dish alot richer in flavor.

TASTED BAD; LOOKED WORSE! For the first time in over 30 years, my husband could not bring himself to eat what I cooked for dinner!!!! He said (and I concur)that it looked like it had been eaten before. I used leftover grilled salmon and canned beans, and followed the directions exactly. When everything was tossed together and the seasonings(such that they were) adjusted, it became a big sticky gob. There was no real distinguishable taste except for the basil and olives. Yuk!

Thought this was a nice and fresh treat for summer. I made it with fresh salmon that my husband caught in Monterey.

This was a good salad but nothing special. I followed the recipe, yet I thought it was missing something.

I forgot to buy shallots, so I used green onions, only 2 cups (1 can) of canalini white beans, and it served 2 as a genrous main dish that was very tasty. I used good kalamanta olives, and a grilled red pepper.

How in the world can you people rate this recipe when not one of you followed the recipe?

This dish was superb, however there were a few adjustments that go highly recommended: I also didn't grill the red peppers, finding the raw texture more suitable for the dish. Additionally, I declined using the fresh basil, thyme or parsely, choosing to go with two tablespoons of seasoning salt I found in the cupboard. I also felt that vegetable oil would place better then the recommended olive oil. And finally, I decided to omit the salmon, opting canned tuna fish instead. Fabuloso!

This salad was great! The best way to use leftover grilled salmon! I used kalamata olives, which blended great with the salmon. (I'm not quite sure if the green would of worked). As suggested in the last review, I used balsamic vinegarette and omitted the olive oil and lemon juice. The bell pepper was not grilled, I just sliced them very thinly and tossed them in with the rest of the ingredients.

This was very good and high in fiber. I suggest not using the rest of the olive oil for the dressing and instead, using a balsamic vinegarette.
