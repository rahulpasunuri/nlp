This was lovely. I found the sansho pepper at the Asian supermarket in the Japanese section, not the spice section. They also had both the enoki and shimeji mushrooms. So cheap! For those of you on the east coast who are having a hard time finding black cod, Trader Joe's now sells it. You can find it in the frozen fish section. I never buy frozen fish but because this Pacific coast fish is so hard to find over here, I gave it a try. Excellent! This was a beautiful broth and I did not find it too salty at all.

Be conscious of the amount of salt in the various ingredients and taste the broth as it reduces so it doesn't become too salty of a reduction. I steamed some rice which did great with the broth over it.

Followed the recipe to a 't' pretty much. Used Sichuan peppercorns, since we had those already and couldn't find sansho pepper. For you food nerds out there... I wondered if toasting and grinding the peppercorns would make the pepper. Nope. Sansho pepper is made from ground up leaves of the prickly ash tree - same tree the Sichuan peppercorns come from, but different part. Anyway, used about a tsp and a half of the peppercorns, since we like a bit more spice. Couldn't find black cod (sablefish) and substituted halibut - another firm fleshed fish. Everything was delicious, but husband thought that the dish lacked the 'wow' factor. I thought that the trio of broth, fish, and mushrooms was excellent, but the leftover broth was just leftover once the fish and mushrooms were all gone... just a little too salty on its own.

Surprisingly easy for such a delicious dish, and surprising delicious for such an easy dish. Black cod is divine. Will make it again.

Easy and tasty. Substituted mushrooms for oyster and shitake. Used white pepper. Would cut garlic to 2 cloves and reduce soy to 4 tbl.

The first time I made this was for guests (I know, crazy). I couldn't find enoki mushrooms, so I substituted with others. It turned out great. The combination of flavors is lovely.

I thought this was delicious and my wife said it should go in the category of "best weekday dinners." I doubled the amount of broth (not the mushrooms, just the broth) and served with a salad. The fatty cod felt so decadent and warming on chilly spring night. We will definitely be working this in to the regular rotation

Wonderful, easy, delicious. I did not have the pepper, so added a bit of black ground, and used shitake and crimini which I had on hand. Also, added some baby bok choy, which was wonderful. Finding the sansho pepper and trying this again. Marvelous impressive easy meal.

There is no reason to do that second simmer on the sauce; in my case, it went from perfect to waaaaay too salty. I like the general concept though and can't wait to try it again.

I had to find a last minute recipe for some black cod that I had and no time to go to the store- I made this minus the mushrooms. I know that is a big deletion but I can still say that the broth combined with the buttery black cod was light and delicious and extremely simple! It would pair nicely with some bok choy or crispy dried string beans and good sticky rice. I now have a great recipe aside form miso black cod for this rare fish.

we chose to sub grouper for the cod, which was fine. we also couldn't fine enoki mushrooms nor either spice from whole foods, so a trip to asia market would be appropriate for next time. overall this dish is very good. don't simmer the sauce for too long otherwise it'll reduce too much and become quite salty. i may add more water than the recipe calls for in the future. but very good dish, will certainly make again without the substitutions.

Easy and delicious. I added napa/chinese cabbage to the mushrooms with the broth. I also used regular tamari instead of reduced-sodium soy sauce and it was a bit salty. I think I'll go out and buy the reduced-sodium stuff just so I can make this again.

Fantastic dish! The buttery fish, meaty mushrooms and hearty broth work extremely well together. For even more depth of flavor, I added a handful of sliced mushrooms and a pinch of sugar to the broth while it was steeping, and a splash of mirin to the finished, strained product.

Great for the simplicity of making this. The hardest part is just getting the ingredients. I had to double the liquids since the mushrooms absorbed a lot of the broth. Used Chilean Seabass.

I have to admit, I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of this recipe. I made it exactly as written and found it to be both easy to prepare and full- flavored. Having lived in Tokyo the past couple of years, I felt this really captured the essence of Japanese cuisine. I served the fish with cold soba noodles, but hot rice and pickles would be a nice accompaniment as well.

This is a light and easy dish to prepare. My husband loved it, I less so - just not to my taste, though I'll make it again.

Didn't change a thing and my family enjoyed every delicious bite!
