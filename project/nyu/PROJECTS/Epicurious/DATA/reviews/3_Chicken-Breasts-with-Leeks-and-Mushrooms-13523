I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added sun dried tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste. I was trying to empty the refrigerator and cupboards before a vacation and except for lemon, I had everything. When I added the leeks and mushrooms, I stirred them in the pan in the oil and bits from the browning of the chicken for a minute. I added the liquid after that. I added the tomato stuff at the end with the olives. I did get compliments on the dish but it was the additions that did it, I think. I also think using the flour gave it a good flavor, too, as I used breasts without skin.

I thought this was an easy meal to whip together and it was reasonably tasty. It was, however, much blander than I expected. I used white wine because that is what I had. Maybe a dash of red pepper flakes would help. I'll try it again because I have an unending supply of leeks. Not bad the way it is just a little bland.

This is an easy week day recipe and low in calories, no butter and I could get away with no salt (dietary restrictions). I used white extra dry vermouth instead of red wine. Served it with brown rice.

I didn't like this & won't be making it again. The flavor was kind of 'off' and nothing amazing or special. It was kind of ugly to look at to. I used 'red wine' as directed. NOT A KEEPER.

I made this easy and tasty dish alongside mushroom risotto and it was a hit. I substituted white wine for red and used many more mushrooms.

I agree with many of the reviewers who said that the dish just seemed to be missing something. I think the red wine may be missplaced. Next time i may make it with white wine or using only a bit of sherry or marsala instead. I did use garlic as one person suggested but i did not think it added the missing ingredient. i also used a small amount of yellow onion along with the leeks The chicken does come out very tender and nice but this recipe needs some playing with to discover the missing ingredient.

I really don't understand the negative reviews of this recipe. I've made this twice and it is very flavorful and the chicken remains very juicy. The only change I have made is to use white wine instead of red, which I think improves the appearance. It's great with mashed potatoes or wild rice.

The last reviews were discouraging, but I had a couple of those boneless skinless chicken fillets, a leek and some about 12 button mushrooms leftover in the fridge. This recipe seemed made for them, and I'm glad I tried it. It was easy and a very nice dinner for two over brown rice. We both enjoyed it.

unfortunately, it was as bland as everyone else mentioned. The leeks took a little longer to cook than 25-30 minutes, too. It needs something else!

I didn't use the flour to dredge the chicken, and I added tomato paste and some sun dried tomato at the end because the dish needs a concentrated tomato flavor to make it work. We loved it.

This recipe was not great. I would never make it. No one wanted seconds, and I had to load on the salt to make it taste like anything.

Very interesting combination of traditional French and Mediterranean flavours. I only added a pinch of cayenne. It reminded me of the chicken, mushroom and leek fricassee, also on this site, but I liked this better.

I skipped the olives (not an olive lover) I cooked the chicken and vegetables separately and then baked them together for 30 minutes. Came out tender and delicious.

Big disappointment and oddly bland, as others have noted. All good ingredients, but too many competing flavors, giving none a chance to shine.

Haven't made this,plan to, but from the reviews it would seem that some additional spices areall that's needed. I immediately noticed this upon reading the ingred. that for example - garlic was missing- I bet that addition would help.

I'd have to agree with the other cooks that this recipe is just so-so. I made it exactly as stated, but was so unimpressive that I added some feta cheese to the top just before serving. The feta made it a little bit better -- but not so much that I would make it again. There's got to be something better out there.

It's a terrific recipe. The olives and capers add a nice bite. I trippled the recipe for a large dinner party. Instead of letting the chicken simmer on the stove, after browning the chicken and vegetables, I transferred it all to a glass caserole and baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, which made the chicken very tender.

Very good and very quick. Made it on a Monday night when I didn't feel like cooking. It was perfect.

bland, bland, bland. try the chicken with olives and feta instead.

This dish is delicious and easy. I doubled the amount of stock and wine to create a more creamy sauce.

sorry, but another tepid review here...it was fine but nothing terribly interesting about it. too many other really good dishes to keep this one.

I liked this one a lot. I used a little more leek, and cooked the mixture a little less. I then served the chicken on top of a "bed" of the "sauce". Very easy, with ingredients, I normally have around.

Very easy to make! Instead of white mushrooms I used Shitake mushrooms which added great flavor to the dish. Will be making this one again soon!

When I made this recipe I used plain old canned black olives and I forgot to put the lemon in. I think the Kalamata olives and lemon would have jazzed it up a bit. But overall it was tasty and made for a nice presentation. Quick and easy to make too. I have another recipe that is similar to this one that uses seasoned bread crumbs instead of the flour mixture to coat the chicken and tomato paste instead of the wine, no olives or lemon. It's good that way too.

This was an extraordinary chicken dish. Flavorful and easy. I made this for my brother-in-law and he raved. I added a clove of garlic to the leeks for extra zip. I will make this again.

I was surprised to see so many tepid reviews of this dish since I made it the first time. I made it again last night and I still find this recipe simple and delicious. I usually have all the ingredients on hand though I didn't have any leeks last night so I used red onion instead. In my opinion, the best part of this dish is the wine reduction with the combined flavors of mushrooms, onions, lemon, olives, and capers that, go so well together. My partner and I love this dish and I've made it for his family and it got rave reviews.

How disappointing. Overall I thought this recipe was bland and was truly missing something. It was definitely easy, but took longer to cook than the recipe indicated. I would have to add a lot and rework this to make it anything I would serve again.

Rating: 2
A big disappointment. The delicious flavors of leeks, brine cured olives, capers and lemon juice seem to lose their individuality when combined. Also, the prolonged cooking of the mushrooms, leeks, wine and broth produced a bit too mushy sauce.

Enjoyed this dish very much. I opted to cook the chicken without the skin though and it still came out very flavorful with the leeks and capers and olives--all favorites of mine. Will definately make this again.

Great dish, a lot like Cook's Illustrated's "chicken in a pot" but a little easier. Really satisfying, good for company.

A very simple delicious recipe. Very tasty, does not take a lot of time to make. I love recipes like this because I can use it on my day to day cooking. My family loved it. I cook every night from scratch, so my recipes must be good and done in the least possible time. Thanks.
