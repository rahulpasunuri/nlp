Recipe needed a little kick. Used some Lizano Sauce(almost the same as steak sauce, but more runny)I added a quarter cup. It made a huge difference in taste.

Very bland - beans were tough.

Both my husband and I thought these beans were excellent. I would definitely make them again. You can also substitute the kidney beans for any other typed of beans too. Excellent!
