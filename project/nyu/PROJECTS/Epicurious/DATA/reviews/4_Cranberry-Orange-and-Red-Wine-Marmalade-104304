Wow what a great cranberry dish. Great with turkey, and very good with pork.

This marmalade was Tart. The first taste makes your face pucker, but then the taste grows on you.

Really tasty cranberry dish-- great texture and flavor. However, I found that the orange peel wasn't really necessary-- my guests didn't care for it. Overall, a winner!

The best cranberries ever. We added a cinnamon stick and a little bit of ground cinnamon, which made a big difference. They're a terrific compliment to the Thanksgiving meal, and would make a nice addition to scones, or with some goat cheese on toast points.

This was absolutely delicious and my guests enjoyed it. I did however add a cinnamon stick to the sauce as well as tea ball with a few whole cloves and allspice.

This was simply delicious - made it for Thanksgiving. I usually make a raw cranberry and orange sauce but this was much better - complex flavours and interesting.

This is a wonderful recipe - easy and delicious. My 3 year old daughter snuck up to the Thanksgiving table and spooned cranberry, orange, and red wine marmalade into her mouth as fast as she could. We spread what little there was left after dinner on our toast for breakfast, and I'm going to make two more batches, just for toast. Also, I'm thinking of adding some chopped crystallized ginger after the marmalade is prepared, to give it a little "kick." This is a worthy recipe, even (and maybe especially) if you don't like cranberry sauce!
