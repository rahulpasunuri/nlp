These came out only "OK." The taste was all there, however, they took way longer to bake than 1 1/2 hours. I baked waffer thin slices on parchment and nonstick sheets for more like 3 hours until they were close to crisp. I stored them overnighth in a ziplock bag, and the next morning they were soggy again. Bummer. All that work slicing (including into my thumb) for next day soggy apple pieces and slices.
