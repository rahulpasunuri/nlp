This is a great summer dessert. It was a hit at our dinner party. We used a different chocolate sauce -- from the French Laundry Cookbook. Next time we'll make more cherry sauce.

The cherry sauce was to die for! I've used this recipe several times this summer and switched up the cherries to blueberry sauce etc. and adding bananas to make it a split! Have used pistachios and toasted slivered almonds as well. The fudge sauce is a no fail too - perfect to keep in the fridge for chocolate emergencies!

Great recipe! Followed recipe exactly and loved it. Definitely buy a cherry pitter - worth the money to save time and mess.

This cool dessert was the perfect ending for a casual summer dinner with friends. I also simmered the cherry halves in the sauce for a several minutes. Every ice cream dish returned to the kitchen empty. Thanks for the information on finding the footed dishes; I just ordered a set from Crate and Barrel.

I made these delicious sundaes last night for a dinner party at the request of the hostess who had seen the recipe in the magazine. We used Ben & Jerry's pistachio and vanilla ice creams, Bonne Maman cherry preserves from Whole Foods, Starbucks Via Instant Coffee Powder, Scharffen- Berger Bittersweet Chocolate and all everyone could say was...WOW! A cherry pitter from Williams-Sonoma made the prep a breeze. Instead of adding the fresh cherries after removing the amaretto/preserve from the heat, I let them boil for 3-4 minutes in the mixture. I would recommend this as the cherry sauce was divine. The recipe did not specify salted or unsalted nuts, so I used unsalted and toasted them for 5 minutes in a 350 oven. The chocolate was 70% and it was delicious, but next time I would probably use a 62% cocoa so the leftover chocolate sauce would be not as bitter. My friend whipped up the whipped cream and added some amaretto and a little powdered sugar...yum. Everything we did added up to a pretty perfect summer dessert! A true keeper recipe. Next time, I'll pass the extra cherry sauce around as I think everyone would have enjoyed a bit more on their sundae. Make this before the fresh cherries go out of season and if you have time, order the footed glasses from Crate and Barrel. I'm pretty sure they are the ones in the magazine and at $2.50, they are a bargain!

Awesome! I found both vanilla and pistachio gelato at my local grocery store and/or Whole Foods. This was sooooo good!
