Maybe it's just that I'm not a fan of luke-warm shrimp, but this didn't work out for me. The broth is a little too salty at the end to really turn it into something useful afterwards and the shrimp don't take on enough of the flavor. I guess as a base to build upon it's a good start, but sure not impressive by itself.

Great dish, I agree the shrimp need to be left in the marinade longer than suggested in the recipe. I followed that advice from the comments and was pleased! My Farmer's Market didn't have habanero or Scotch Bonnet, I substituted serrano chiles (hotter than jalapenos) and felt they came out well.

Great recipe, but if you have scotch bonnet peppers use those over the habeneros, gives a way more authentic taste.

Oh my! These were incredible! This is the best peel and eat we have ever had. Be sure to SMASH the garlic, or you could lose some of the flavor. I used home grown habaneros and they were balistic!! We will make this many more times. The serving size is listed as 4 - it made an entree size of 2 servings. We served with black beans and rice. Excellent!!!!!

My wife and I have been going to Jamaica for 10 years. A highlight of the trip is always the shrimp ladies near Savanna la Mar. Can't stop eating them! This Recipe is the real deal. We've made the recipe 4 times now and have NEVER had leftovers! A couple of hints: Mince the garlic very finely instead of using a garlic press....it will not be as bitter. And wear gloves for cutting the Scotch Bonnets so you don't burn your fingers from the capsicum. Shrimp, peas and rice, Red Stripe......Yah Mon.

We've vacationed in Negril Jamaica several times. A highpoint of the trip has always been a trip to Savannah La Mar to but from the pepper shrimp ladies. Been looking for a recipe for years. THIS IS IT! The picture is exactly how hey are sold. The broth is no intended to go over rice. Serve this with Jamaican Peas (beans) and rice and a bucket of cold Red Stripes. Yah Mon!!!!

This recipe is outstanding! Be careful with the hot peppers though if the recipe is used for a party. Many guests did not like the hot-hot-hot flavor. Next time I will use Jalapeno peppers. They are not as hot.

This recipe is fabulous. We did this for a cocktail party. The cooks in the kitchen were eating the shrimp straight from the pan and commented "we should live this in the kitchen" just for us! Followed the recipe exactly.

Like the previous reviewer, I too have had the pleasure of sampling these shrimp at the source in Westmoreland, and actually read this issue of Gourmet while on my honeymoon in Negril! This recipe brings us back great memories of our trip. I use 4 minced jalapenos instead of the scotch bonnets (I'm a wuss), reduce the water to 1.5c, and use a few good dashes of ground allspice instead of whole berries. Excellent snacking!

My husband loved the taste of the shrimp. I liked it, but made the mistake of serving it over white rice with some of the broth. The broth was too watery. Next time, I would strain the shrimp and serve it without the broth. I would also chop the peppers instead of halving them so that you get a little taste in every bite.

This was fabulous. My guests couldn't stop eating it; the shrimp were full of flavor and just the right texture. I didn't have the "too watery" complaint that I read in the other reviews. I had to use jarred habaneros rather than fresh (neighborhood market all out of fresh), and it was still delicious. I worried that it would be way too spicy, but the kick was just right. It reminded me of some wonderully flavorful peel-and-eat shrimp I had on Maryland's eastern shore a long time ago. Superb.

I made this recipe per instructions. Too watery for me. The second time, I made it per elvee13's changes (2 hours in marinade) and my family loved it. Not a soggy presentation like the original and a much more consistent flavor. I grilled/basted with marinade until color brightened.

The dish was a little watered down. The second time I made it I ground the spice and marinate shimp in them for 24 hours, then roasted in the broiler.
