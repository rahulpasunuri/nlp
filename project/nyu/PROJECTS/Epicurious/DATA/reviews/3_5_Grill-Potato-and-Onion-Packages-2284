I really like this recipe but I use red potatoes and white onion instead!

I have made this many times since it first appeared in the magazine. I also do it in the oven. It makes a nice change on a weeknight.

Tasted great and was easy to make. I used less oil and more Dijon as recommended and it worked well.

It's good - but were I to do it again I'd use more dijon and less oil.

It started pouring rain as soon as I was ready to put the packet on the grill, so I fried them on medium heat, covered for 10 minutes. Then I removed the lid and continued to cook, turning frequently for another 20 minutes. Very tasty, couldn't detect a mustard flavor, although it enhanced the overall flavor.

I, too, have been making this for years. I always reduce the oil by half. Regardless of the potato or onion type,they are a tasty, easy potato side dish. I agree however, that if you want the dijon and thyme taste, increase those amounts. Use fresh thyme, if possible as I find dried thyme often smelling like dirt. I can't resist adding a little seasoning salt and I'm not usually a heavy salt user.

I have made this recipe for the past 11years! I loaned out my Bon Appetit magazine with the recipe and never got it back and was thrilled to find the recipe online again. This is a very useful side dish. We usually pair it with grilled salmon that is glazed with dijon/brown sugar/soy sauce but today I am pairing it with chicken sausages and greek salad. I usually use red skinned potatoes and leave the skins on. I slice them as thin as possible (because it speeds up cooking time) and grill the packages for quite a long time (30 min or more) to make sure the potatoes are all fully cooked and tender and the onions are nicely carmelized. Sure, the potatoes stick a little to the foil, but they get nicely browned and carmelized and the potatoes on the inside are soft and tender, a really pleasing combo. We have cooked these packets in the oven, on the gas grill and over an open campfire and it always turns out great as long as they are cooked long enough. I usually make the packets ahead of time and let them sit and marinate while I prepare the rest of the meal. I have also prepped them a day ahead or more with great results.

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it for years. It's quick, easy and great to make in the summer when you don't want to turn on your oven. I do more of a dump and pour measuring of my ingredients, and often use fingerling potatoes because they cook very quickly and are yummy! I keep the packets from burning by putting them on the top rack of my grill about ten minutes before I put on the steaks (or the Balsamic Marinaded chicken breasts which recipe is also a Bon Appetit recipe).

Boring. Potatoes took 10-15 minutes longer than expected.

Easy to prepare & enjoyed by everyone in my family! I agree that the oil is a bit too much - definitely decrease amount. Not necessary to peel the potatoes - I also added a few whole garlic cloves. Will try rosemary next time.

We LOVED these! Easy prep, easy cleanup and a crowd pleaser. YUM!

Good and easy, but we could not taste the mustard flavor at all.

This is a definite favorite in our household...to cut the fat content a bit I always cut back on the oil and they still turn out great. Dried thyme works as well as fresh too. A great side dish to whatever you are grilling!

My husband and I really liked these. The potatoes came out perfectly tender, and the onions were so sweet. The mustard gave it a nice flavor. We served these with the grilled steaks with blue cheese and walnut butter as the July 1996 issue suggests. What a great meal!

I have made a similar recipe for many years and it is always a hit. Summer savory or rosemary are also very good additions. I found a new kind of alluminium foil made by Reynolds called 'Release'. As its name suggests, it prevents food from sticking. It works perfectly. To keep the potatoes from burning, I put them on the warming grill while the barbecue is warming up. The potatoes turn nice and brown without burning.

If you're strapped for time and don't have time to make up individual packets, one alternative is to just boil the potatoes, let them cool a bit, and then toss them in the marinade. Still delicious in this abbreviated version!

Very tasty, though I substituted rosemary and garlic for the thyme. I also only used 1/2 cup of oil, but it was still more than enough.

Rating: 4
Very good - but be careful because the potatoes and onions on the bottom of the packages tend to burn.

I reduced the oil as well, but left the other ingredients alone. While I didn't find this to be incredible-tasting, I would make this again because of how easy it is to throw together. I served this with Sliced Steak with Roasted Corn Salsa (Gourmet, 9/00) which made preparation even more simple-- everything went on the grill at once.

A great recipe - easy & fun! Be sure to reduce the oil. I used about 1/4 cup and still thought it could use less. I also used dried thyme which was fine. Enjoy, we did.

This was a great potato recipe! I was a little hesitant on the mustard & thyme. I like mustard but didn't think it was the right flavor to go with the rest of the meal. The mustard flavor was very mild and we really liked it. I used dried thyme and didn't really notice it. I am curious to see how it tastes using fresh. You might have to cook the packets a little longer than the recipe calls for or at high flame. I will definately add this as a bbq staple.

This is a standard in my grilling repetoire. My suggestion is to add less oil than the 2/3 c. One quarter cup is truly enough. Andwhen cooking, spread the potatoes and onions in a layer of not more than 3 deep that way the potatoes crisp and turn brown. The carmelization of the potatoes and onions is terrific.

Oh please, it IS a recipe (hence the ingred., technique, etc.)..... Maybe not the most unusual or difficult in said technique, but you couldn't tell that from the RECIPE? Delicious! The onions get so sweet and potatoes perfectly done if sliced thin enough (be sure to coat onions and potatoes thoroughly). Simple, as grilling should be, and will make this again; accompanied my grilled swordfish with dijon mustard sauce which was a terrific match! KIMBER

Really more of a cooking method than a recipe. The best part is the lack of dirty dishes. Now I can forget par-boiling potatoes before grilling. Other than that, let your imagination run wild. I'll try is again using other vegetables, herbs and oils. Second post: I've got a new bent on this dish. Place potatoes,whole or half, into an aluminum loaf pan. Add salt, pepper, herbs, butter pats, and olive oil. Wrap the whole thing up in heavy duty aluminum foil. Now the key...place the package on the rack that swings down from the lid on most gas grills. This leaves you the entire grilling area to work with. Leave it there while your warming up the grill, cooking the steaks, etc., and allowing the meat to rest. Just before serving, total of 45 minutes to an hour, potatoes will be prefectly cooked.

This was not very good

I REALLY love red onions on the grill and I thought this recipe was just great. I was running in and out of the house making dinner inside and grilled these and when I went to check on them after about 15 minutes it looked like my grill was on fire! I thought I ruined them, so I shut the grill off and gave them time to cool off. When I checked back they looked perfect! So I mixed them up a bit, and turned the flame back on. Mmmmmmm...I suppose next time I should keep the flame lower :)

I don't know where I went wrong, but this just didn't come out all that great. The potatoes had a funny taste to them, tasting kinda like the foil. My husband took two bites and threw them out. Might try again with more seasoning.

Excellent & easy. The flavor was very good, and I cooked a little longer, as I like the browned pieces. Spraying the foil was key--will definitely make again and again this summer. Will be a staple.

I used this recipe at my daughter's wedding dinner. Everyone loved it. A wonderful combination of flavors.

This is delicious and really easy. I salt & peppered the potatoes & onions, made the dressing mix, then dumped it all into a Reynolds grill bag & shook it together. Came out perfectly in 25 minutes!

I followed the recipe exactly, including the recommended temperature, and I still got some potatoes burned. I'll try thos again but I will decrease the cooking time. This went well with the grilled sirloin steaks with blue cheese-walnut butter.

Quick-Easy-Delicious! Used thyme once and rosemary the second time, both excellent.

This recipe brought back fond memories of my mother grilling veggies in the foil packages. Delicious! Will throw this easy recipe together again and again.

Great, easy recipe with very simple clean-up. We have made it several times, experimenting with different potatoes, rosemary and mushrooms. All have been successful and add variety.

really very good! I have cooked potatoes and onions in foil over the grill and by the fire for years - it never occurred to me to spice them up with mustard etc. You can bet I'll be experimenting over the summer with other complimentary flavors as well!

I thought this was alright. I did like the mustard flavouring but overall I didn't think this dish was anything spectacular. The simplicity of preparation is what will draw me to make it again. I just felt it was a bit plain.

We have this all summer long, it's a terrific recipe, the potatoes and onions taste so good! I've tried it with fresh thyme and dried thyme and either way is delicious! Just don't forget to spray the tin foil with Pam and salt them before closing the packets. This is a real winner!

INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS AND FABULOUSLY EASY!!!! Made it for my roommates who are great cooks and they couldn't stop raving about it! Highly recommended it!
