I think the problem is using pre-made pie dough. I used a thawed single sheet of frozen puff pastry instead, and used dried Montgomery tart cherries. Slashed the top and painted it with egg wash. It was better.

This wasn't my cup of tea, but my husband put it away pretty quickly so I'll give it three forks rather than the two it would have received if I was the only voter. It may reflect my lack of talent but getting the dough into a 16 inch square was tough. Then you're dealing with a pretty thin crust and a pretty dry filling. I may just be more of a brownie girl.
