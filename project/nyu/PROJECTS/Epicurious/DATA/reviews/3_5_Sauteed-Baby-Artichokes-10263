This dish makes an excellent sauce for fettuccine, especially with the addition of mushrooms. I actually prefer a bit more lemon.

A great way to prepare baby artichokes for PIZZA!!!! Prepare as described (except I used sherry and chicken broth instead of white wine). Then quarter them and place them on top of a thin crust pizza, to be baked on a pizza stone or in a wood fired oven.

I would make this again but only w/four easy alterations. First, sautee garlic AFTER liquid is added, it will burn in oil on its own, no matter how careful you are. Secondly, I agree about the lemon. Add half and save half for the end if you need it. Third, two cups is too much wine. Substitute one with broth, much lighter. Fourth possibly, substitute fresh herbs at end instead of dried in the beginning. I liked the end result of a thick gravy, but the longer it sits, it thickens moreso. Just add a little more broth. In summary, easy on the lemon and wine. As others mentioned, they are too overpowering for the delicate artichoke. I would try this again with those changes, and I feel it would taste more like it should have.

This was easy and even tsted great cold the next day. Seems like the recipe would feed more like 6 people.

Excellent dish, very flavorful. I also agree it probably would be better with a tad less lemon, I drizzled a little olive oil over to temper the acidity.

I made this recipe quickly as a snack when family was coming over for a long day in NYC. It was quick and completely stole the show! We couldn't believe how easy and excellent it was. I've made it several times since.

I first saw this prepared on TV by Sarah Moulton (executive chef for Gourmet magazine) She said it was delicious so I had to try it. Her recipe was doubled. I ended up simmering the dish for close to an hour (yikes)! But it turned out delicious! I would decrease the lemon by a little bit though. I served it as an appetizer with some foccacia bread and assorted crackers with a little spoon so guests could scoop it up and put it on the bread. Many raves!

I have to agree with Jo Jo. I was careful about following the recipe and wound up with a gummy mess. It wasn't pretty to look at and it just didn't taste all that great. I agree also with Patty -- the simpler the better when it comes to glorious artichokes.

This is a tasty, flavorful recipe -- and easy, too! We served it over angel hair pasta and it was perfect. I'm not sure how some of the other cooks (see below) wound up with a gummy result -- just keep an eye on the sauce during the last simmer and take it off early if it reduces too quickly.

This recipe is way over flavored; loose the artichoke taste. If I did it again I would prepare the 'chokes by pulling leaves, trimming, and quartering, then stem until tender and finish off sauteeing with lemon and butter. Artichokes have a wonderful flavor, but it's lost in this recipe.

This recipe worked great for me and was enjoyed by the whole family. Wouldn't change a thing.

I was going to write all the things I thought were wrong with this recipe, but that might take a long time. This was just so wrong. I ended up with some gummy, pasty, bitter little 'chokes that were visually unappealing. And they didn't taste good either.
