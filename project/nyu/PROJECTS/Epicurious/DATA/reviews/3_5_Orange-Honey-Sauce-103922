I didn't have a sweet wine and substituted a pinot grigio; I did add orange zest and strained it and the shallots before adding the stock, as another reviewer suggested. The result: a terrific sauce with a subtle flavor and a wonderful mouth-feel (that butter!) that is really the ideal accompaniment to the Moroccan game hen recipe.

Great sauce with many revisions to this recipe. I used just 1 1/2 C chicken stock, and strained the shallots out after adding the stock and before adding the butter. I found the shallots overpowered the taste of the sauce so that is why I strained them. I added more honey, muscat and OJ to taste and then added 1 Tbsp orange zest. Reduced it further. Served over roasted chicken. I would definitely recommend straining the shallots, the texture was wonderful. And I preferred the more intense orange flavour.

This is a superb sauce. I used it with Gary Danko's recipe for Moroccan cornish game hens. I will definitely make this sauce again and perhaps try it with pork tenderloin.
