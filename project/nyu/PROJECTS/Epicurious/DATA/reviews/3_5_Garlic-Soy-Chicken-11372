Great dish. I made a few changes - more garlic, less sugar. See my full post (with pictures) here: http://dishtionary.tumblr.com/post/21242091868/garlicsoychicken

This is a question, not a review. Does anyone know how this works if I marinate it the night before?

Has anyone made this with honey as a substitute for the brown sugar?

Been making this forever - it's an easy weeknight favorite at our house. I add broccoli to the veggies, then chop the chicken once its cooked, mix it all together and serve over rice as a chicken bowl. Great results from a minimum of effort!

This dish was very EXCELLENT. The cook from Denver probably has undeveloped taste buds as he stated.

Pleased the crowds. Serving pans were scrupulously cleaned of any traces of the sauce by the happy masses. We doubled the garlic, because this was part of a galric themed meal

Smack you in the face good. We used a little extra garlic, just because. I almost didn't need to wash the serving dishes, people were wiping them clean to get the last bits of sauce.

This is the way it should be made. Denver may have used a low sodium Soy, or did not prep the chicken well. It is supposed to be sublte. You may substitute a little rice vinegar for the sherry.

Easy prep and uses many ingredients already in the house.

This wasn't good people! If you have under developed tastebuds than this is for you.

LOVE the marinade. It's great on pork too and you can bet I'm going to try it on flank steak. I added chili garlic paste to the veges. YUMMM!

It was excellent. Took longer than I thought to make. I added extra garlic. Very good. Next time will cut the chicken into cubes

Pretty good basic recipe. Didn't have sherry so I used bourbon. Also, didn't have ginger so used a "Trinidad" spice that contained ginger, garlic, and lemon. Worked very well. Served it with stir-fryed sesame asparagus.

This was a great recipe. My husband and I absolutely loved it! I added green beans and sesame seeds to the vegetables and served it with white rice. We will definately make it again.

We thought this dish was just so-so. The chicken was pretty good, but the sesame vegetables really didn't add anything.

This dish came out great. The chicken came out well considering I only set the boneless/skinless breasts in for 25 minutes uncovered and did not have a seasoned skillet. I wish I would have made a bit more sauce to drizzle more over the chicken and rice.

We only made the chicken piece of this dish, but we loved it! It was very quick and easy. We used low sodium soy and had no problems with salitness. I can't wait to make it again this week with the veggies!

I think it's a great recipe to make for two people. Make a little bit more extra steamed rice so you can laddle the sauce on it. Definately give this one a try it may be your family's next Favorite Dish!

Just made this recipe for the first time. It was delicious. I added pea pods and toasted sesame seed to the veggies. Will definitely make again.

Everyone rated this so highly that I couldn't wait to try it. Would not make this again, no one liked it , it was really salty and had a very heavy soy taste, too much soy.

Made the dish 2 times for my boyfriend. He raved about it. Very flavorful and tasty. Easy to make. I added crushed red peppers for spice. You can make the dish without the oil and it's just as good. Don't skimp on the ginger. Note: The sesame vegetables are good, but nothing special.

I have been making this dish since last summer and have been too lazy to comment. I LOVE this dish. It's pretty easy to make and oh so tasty. My mouth is watering thinking about it. If you love ginger/garlic flavors you will fall in love too! And the sesame veggies are perfect accompaniments. They are versatile enough to serve with a variety of dishes.

The chicken had a great flavor, and was very tender. I added broccoli to the vegetables because I am not all that crazy about peppers. Be careful to watch the sauce when boiling it, I didn't and it boiled away!!

Just like the "stir-fry" I am used to. It is quite good, especially with a variety of peppers used for the veggetables.

This is a delicious, quick weekday night recipe. I had already started making the recipe when I realized that my fresh gingeroot had spoiled, so I substituted a pinch of ground ginger with good results. I also used dark sesame oil instead of plain vegetable oil for better flavor.

Delicious, easy, and quick! Serve with rice and it's an elegant meal for family or company.
