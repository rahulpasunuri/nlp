this is a really nice dish -- added the sesame oil to sauteeing the fish, as one reviewer suggested and used sundried tomatoes instead of tomato paste for the sauce. Was puzzled that one reviewer found roasting peppers to be so much trouble. I cut peppers in half, stick them under the broiler skin side up until they're charred, take them out, cool a few minutes and peel them - they're the simplest thing to do, and make this recipe very worthwhile.

I found Pacific Sea Bass at Sprouts and used this recipe. It was awesome. I foolwed directions exactly, and wouldn't change a thing.

I don't understand how so many people raved about it. I made it. I followed the recipe. It was ok at best. I've gotten so many better recipes on this website before. It was a lot of trouble roasting the peppers. This recipe is not worth all the time and work. I wouldn't like it even if it were an easy, quick recipe.

I made this for a dinner party for my parents 40th anniversary and everyone raved about it. It was delicious, easy and visually beautiful. I served it with the sauce covering half of the fillet and pooling onto the plate with a big basil sprig garnish and got lots of "oohs and aahs". I also used jarred roasted red peppers. It was much easier and I don't think home roasting the peppers would make any difference in the taste, certainly not enough to justify the extra work.

I needed a quick fix for a whole seabass (not fillets) and this worked very well, even though I had to fudge the ingredients a bit. I used jarred peppers and ground almonds, 2 tbs oil, balsamic vinegar (no red wine in the house) and added the lemon juice, garlic and extra cayenne pepper. I three slices into the fish on each side and stuffed the tapenade in, with extra in the cavity and on top, and baked (on baking paper in a pan) for 15 minutes at 200 c (approx 400 F?). It worked really well and I will definitely do it again.

Easy and quick. The sauce has a nice color. I recommend cooking the fish in 1 T sesame oil and 1 T olive oil. The sesame really gives the fish a nice flavor and works well with the sauce. I served this on rice with sauteed zuchinni and squash. Definitely add the garlic and lemon juice as suggested by others.

I have made this many different times. As previous cooks suggested: definately add lemon juice and garlic to the recipe. Makes all the difference. Also, I recommend adding more cayenne to taste, as the spicyness really adds to the sauce. I have also eliminated both the cayenne and tomato paste and substituted a chili paste, as I was out of both of the former. Worked like a charm. Also great to serve warm over browned chicken breasts with a little cream. I get many raves each time I serve this with fish. Also, you can substitute any firm fish such as Wahoo/Ono or Swordfish, too.

Thankyou to the cook from Nashville! I went and found the recipe for the Shrimp with Romesco Sauce, and served it with Rock Fish instead of Shrimp, it was amazing!, I made a triple batch, refrigerated it and served some over homemade pasta, and some over some cous-cous, I will definitely make it again. I roasted my own red peppers, so it was a nice fresh sauce.

I did not make this dish, but I have made the Shrimp with Romesco Sauce (Bon Appetit, May '95). That is a four-fork recipe, and although the differences in the sauces are sort of subtle (roasted red peppers instead of plain, addition of garlic, Sherry wine vinegar) I think they would probably change the minds of those who thought the sauce tasted bland. Point being: try the Shrimp with Romesco - it is excellent.

If I could rate it a 2 1/2, I would. It's a good recipe but I would agree with the last review. It lacked UMPH. And, like the others, I agree that it is good as a dip with crackers and such.

I hate to be the odd woman out here but I found this a bit boring.... Dont get me wrong, it tasted fine and had a lovely texture, but it just didnt have any umph. Given the price of fresh Sea Bass, I want it to be something special - and this was something average.

I thought this dish was very good! Would definitely make it again!

Very good, and I agree with most comments. Go easier on the oil than suggested when preparing the sauce, and you could add some garlic to it. You can put fresh cilantro on everything just before serving, or add some cumin to the sauce. Also, think about using a different oil when preparing the fish. Don't use extra virgin olive oil, it gets too bitter at sautee-heat. Vegetable oil, or maybe even an almond (or other nut) oil.

Unbelievably easy and DELICIOUS! Even after cheating and using roasted bell peppers out of a jar, the dish was EXCELLENT!

The sauce was absolutely wonderful. I used sundried tomatoe paste instead, tossed in a few cloves of roasted garlic and some lemon juice. As other cooks suggested, I halved the amount of olive oil. I also trippled the amount of cayenne. I did use the full 1/2 cup of almonds and thought it was wonderful - I forgot to toast/roast them and can't imagine it actually made any difference. The sauce was great with the sea bass, but to tell the truth the leftovers were even better with a bit of bread. I actually made the "sauce" alone a few weeks later and brought it as an appetizer to a party with a bunch of garlic toasts and tiny pieces of a savory appetizer bread. It was a big hit and the sauce tasted better the next day. And it could not have been easier!

This was a really easy dish to make- and it tasted fantastic. I would definately make this again- and recommend to anyone. I used 1/2 the oil and it was perfect.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I added a bit more cayenne pepper and some lemon juice, and the end result was tasty. The sauce is great on it's own.

this is the 2nd time i have made this to go with sea bass. this time i took everyone's advise ; less oil less nuts ( i used roasted pine nuts this time)and used a combo red and yellow peppers. we all liked it better this way...even though the last time was very good too. Makes for some great bread dipping if there's any left over.. and i was smart this time because i squirreled some away just for that reason...

Easy to make and very good. Used roasted pistachios instead of the almonds and it was very tasty.

Tried with mahi-mahi and was a success in my non-fish-eating family. The sauce needs a hearty fish. I used 1/4 c almonds, which added a lot to the flavor; I don't think it would have been good without them.

Very simple and satisfying. Used halibut and worked out well. Omitted almonds as previously suggested.

the sauce was too runny I would spare my guests some of the olive oil(1/2) Also, it needs a bit of tang; I havn't tried it, not next time, I will add some lemon juice to the pepper sauce

Great recipe! I grilled the sea bass which gave it more flavor. The second time I made it I cut back on the almonds to 1/4 c. so we could taste the roasted pepper better. We served the sauce with crostini the next day at a dinner party. It was a hit!

Must use Chilean Sea Bass. The sauce is very good but if added to pasta needs something else. I baked my sea bass, which I topped with the pepper sauce, at 500 degrees for 15 minutes, rest for 3 minutes, then served on top of whole wheat pasta. Excellent, but the fish with the sauce was the best part of it all.

I found this pretty simple to prepare and the sauce really added a lot to the fish. (This coming from a non-fish person.) We had some leftover sauce and it kept well in the fridge for use as an appetizer with toasted baguette slices. Delicious!

I liked this dish so much I made it again for my non-turkey eating familiy at Thanksgiving. Wonderful flavors in the sweet and spicy sauce.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it although next time I think I will leave out the nuts. I think they got in the way of the flavor of the roasted pepper sauce which was delicious by the way!

excellent and easy! Best of all, all ingredients (minus the sea bass) are probably already in your home! A summer classic, serve w/grilled veggies and chilled white wine!

This sauce is pretty close to authentic romesco sauce without all the hassell. To spice it up I might add some roasted garlic to the red pepper puree. Also we grilled our sea bass which added a little extra flavor.

Although we didn't have the best piece of sea bass the sauce was great! I will try it as a dip next time.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night, and liked it so much that I e-mailed it to my daughter first thing today. What is so nice about it is not only the flavor, but how quick and easy it is to prepare. I have put this in my "favorite" cookbook to use again.

I used this sauce with pasta instead of sea bass, it's one of the most delicious pasta sauces I have made. It's quite fast to make too, this could easily be done after work during the week. The sauce has the sweetness from the red peppers but it also has a nice zing to it. I used less olive oil like the previous reviewer suggested, only 2 tablespoons instead of 6 and it worked out well. I also used sun-dried tomato paste instead of regular tomato paste.

Great recipe and not too spicy. I used only half the recommended olive oil amount to save on calories.
