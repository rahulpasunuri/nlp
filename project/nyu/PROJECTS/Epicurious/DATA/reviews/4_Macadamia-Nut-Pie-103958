I have been making this recipe for many years with great success and have made the following changes that my family really likes: add 1/2 cup minced crystallized ginger, add 1 T. minced fresh ginger, increase nuts to 3 cups, bake at 350 in an 11 inch tart pan for 35 to 40 min (crust was pre-baked at 300 for 12 to 15 min before adding filling). Serve at room temp drizzled with warm chocolate sauce. Ice cream or whipped cream optional.

I made this for my husband's birthday in Mid-November and my family loved it soo much that its replacing a pecan pie for Thanksgiving! I left some of the mac nuts out and diced them on top of the pie for a nice dusted look. I also chopped the ones that I did leave in. I would also consider using light brown sugar, corn syrup for a blonder color... but am hesitant to change much about this tasty recipe!

This recipe is basically a pecan pie using macadamia nuts. I used the smaller amount of sugar as previously mentioned which gives a nice balance of sweet/nutty. Next time, I plan to experiment by adding some flavors to the egg/sugar mixture like Kahulua or mango puree. Note that my pie puffs up in the center and browns about 12 minutes earlier than the recommended cook time. Not sure if my oven was running hot or the cook time is a bit long. Just keep an eye on your pie!

Today I won a pie contest with this pie! Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. The only changes I made were to cut back on the brown sugar (to about 1/2 cup), and to add 1/4 tsp salt to the filling. I agree that I prefer this pie when it is chilled.

I am currently spending a month in kauai and have already made this 4 times! It is a huge hit with neighbors and guests. I reduced the sugar just a bit, and it was perfection. Another tip is that unsalted macadamia nuts are astronomically expensive here...much cheaper at Trader Joe's on the mainlaind.

Amazing!! Two pies went faster than I could blink.

Really awesome. I made two of these. One I baked for around 53 minutes and the other for 45. Think that next time it needs to be right in between, as the first was a little too crunchy (burnt) and the latter was a little mushy in the center bottom. Still everyone who tasted, raved and had seconds. My problem with the timing I guess did not effect the taste! I am definitly excited to try and perfect this yummy recipe!

Made 2 pies for a luau. Used the full amount of nuts called for. I put the nuts in a zipper bag and broke them up with a mallet first. I used Marie Calander's frozen deep dish pie shells. Everything came together easily and quickly. My guests raved. Definitely a keeper!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but have had this pie while I was in Maui & loved it. If it is the same I would give it a 4

Very simple to make. I would also recommend adding less nuts and perhaps split the nuts in halves.

If you like something a little nutty and Macadamia nuts this receipe is for you. Next time, I would add a little less of the nuts so that there would be more of the filling.

We really liked this recipe. I served it with vanilla ice cream. We liked the consistency better when the pie was slightly chilled rather than when it was at room temperature.
