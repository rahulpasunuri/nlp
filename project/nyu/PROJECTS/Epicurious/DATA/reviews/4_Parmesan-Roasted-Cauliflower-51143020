This was very good. Make sure you salt it generously. I added brussels sprouts to the veggies. All in all, I prefer the Indian Spiced Cauliflower on this site.

Just saw this in Bon Apetit and wanted to try immediately. As we like Brussels sprouts I added a package of them too with the cauliflower. I think you could add carrots, potatoes, pretty much anything you like. Great flavor!

Brilliant dish - I'm a big roasted veggie fan with pretty high RV standards and loved this. I had to laugh because, like another reviewer, my husband and I almost cleaned the entire baking tray before we left the table...that good! Added a little more olive oil, garlic and brussel sprouts, which were so amazing roasted.

My fiancé & I ate the entire dish in one sitting. Very easy & quite tasty. Added a bit extra garlic otherwise made as written.

Awesome taste, simple to do. The cauliflower harvest is going on here and it was outstanding with fresh picked cauliflower!

This was delicious and even my cauliflower-suspicious husband ate it. I wound up overcooking it a bit as I lost track of time. A keeper though. Maybe I would add a little bit more garlic next time.

I loved loved loved this recipe just as is! Roasted vegetables are delicious anyway, but adding the garlic, thyme, and parmesan cheese just brings it to a new level! The only thing I might change is to reduce the amount of olive oil to maybe 1 1/2 TBS for no other reaon than to reduce some of the fat, although the recipe is perfect just the way it is. Will definitely be made over and over again in my house.

Excellent! Husband loved it and the two of us ate the entire head! Might add a few more garlic cloves last time, but definitely an easy keeper.

I made this as directed and we thought this was just okay. It was a little bland.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband started nibbling on it as soon as I took it out of the oven, there was almost none left for dinner. We have also served it to guests, who loved it as much as we did.

I'm a huge fan of roasting all kinds of veggies. Roasted cauliflower is one of my favorites and this recipe is definitely a keeper. I grow herbs in my garden so I also used some fresh, minced rosemary. I think I will try substituting leeks for the onions next time just for more depth of flavor.

This was great and really easy. I didn't have thyme sprigs so I just lightly sprinkled dried thyme on the veggies before I mixed them with the oil. And I peeled and sliced the garlic to allow more flavor to permeate the cauliflower. I will definitely make this again.
