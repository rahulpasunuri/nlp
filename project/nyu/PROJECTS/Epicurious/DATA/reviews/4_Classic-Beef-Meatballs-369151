Yum! These just came out of the oven, & I wanted to try one before deciding how to serve them. They are delish! (It didn't hurt that my sauce had lots & lots of garlic). I subbed arugula for parsley because that's what I had on hand - otherwise, made per recipe.

A huge winner. Everybody who has ever tasted it loves it. The secret is the ricotta cheese, I think.

Easy to make, easy to adapt but on this first try, made as written (only added extra garlic to sauce recipe. Yum!)After making meatballs, held until sauce was done and then placed in sauce to reheat before putting on pasta (as well as trying a couple of meatball sliders on great bread). If this came out bland for you, perhaps ingredients (from meat to fennel seeds and herbs) were old or too generic. These were flavorful with great texture. next time though, I won't pack so much as I like a slightly fluffier meat ball. Also used part-skim ricotta which didn't seem to hurt a thing.

These were good, but as others have noted, a bit bland. It really needs garlic and a stronger cheese. The recipe calls for a lighter taste in adding the ricotta as they feel it doesn't overwhelm the meat, but I just thought it was a little too average. I will definitely make it again but add some parmesan or asiago.

These meatballs were delicious. Flavorful, and so tender. My family said they were better than my ususal meatballs. I added garlic after reading other reviews. Instead of covering them with sauce and roasting in the oven, I simply scooped them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and added to my marinara sauce. Delicious served over pasta. The leftovers made great meatball subs!

Outstanding! made one change. Used 93% lean beef so there was no fat to spill off and used whole milk ricotta. Meatballs were the best I ever made.

This was a great starting point for a first time meatball. I changed a few items, but the overall concept was a very helpful guide. I added half an onion to the meat, which was very tasty. I also cooked down a half onion, few cloves of garlic, one bay leaf, and red wine before adding the tomato sauce and a few shakes of an Italian herb mix to my sauce pan for heating. Lastly, after baking the meatballs for 20 min I transferred them to another baking dish with a slatted spoon. This way as much excess grease and fat was removed from the rest of the cooking process. Lastly, I must confess, I forgot to add the ricotta to my meatball mix but remembered in time to add it to the sauce. This worked out well and my guests were very pleased. All in all, very tasty. I will definitely try this again (with the ricotta in the meat, just to make the comparison).

I have been trying to find a good meatball recipe for a long time. I think they taste great and go well with homemade marinara sauce. Do not forget the fennel it gives the meatballs a nice flavor. I made the recipe exactly as written.

I'd make this again, but with adjustments. The biggest problem was the runoff from the meatballs watered down my delicious sauce (I drained as suggested, but it was impossible to drain completely without meatballs dropping on the floor). Next time, I'll use a slotted spoon to transfer the meatballs to the sauce pan and then put the saucepan back in the oven for 15 minutes. Also, I too added 4 cloves of garlic and decreased the salt by 1 teaspoon. The taste was very good. I made ricotta and while I think this is a worthwhile task for many things, I don't think it was worth the time for the meatballs. I suspect that no one will taste the difference with inferior store bought ricotta.

I was skeptical baked meatballs could be this good--love skipping the mess & fat of frying. Try them, you will not be disappointed! I too added some garlic-also used farmers market homemade ricotta which made them delicious!

Did no one find this recipe too salty as written? I love it with half the salt. I will try the garlic as so many have suggested. I don't have any ricotta today, so I'm sure they won't be the same.

These are some of the best meatballs I've ever had. Just added some garlic, because it's garlic.

I enjoyed this recipe. I halved it as I cook for two. I would definitely think about adding some garlic to the meatballs as I found them a bit bland. I liked the consistency and texture of the meatballs. I will be trying this again!

I used this recipe only b/c I had ricotta to use up, but normally I make my meatballs with milk with bread crumbs (or day-old bread). The ricotta is simply a more expensive substitute for milk, one that I wouldn't use often. It was good but not out of the ordinary. I like my own recipe using milk. I also add a little grated onion, some minced parsley, and some pecorino; without cheese, the meat is bland. The pecorino is less expensive than parmesan and you don't even need too much of it b/c it's saltier. It gives it the flavor it needs.

My new favorite meatball recipe. Super easy to make and doubles easily to feed a crowd. Served this with the Classic Tomato Sauce over polenta and everyone raved.

Delicious. I used a meatball maker machine instead of baking them and then finished with the 15 minutes in the oven in my own sauce. I prefer a mix of meats instead of just beef. and maybe garlic. However, the simplicity of this recipe rules.

Really delicious, but my four stars are based on incorporating two additions based on reviewers' input: garlic and parmesan. Also, I didn't have fennel seed, so I substituted a seasoning mix of purple shallots, chives, green peppercorn, basil, tarragon, chervil, bay leaf and dill. (It's called Sunny Paris, from Penzeys Spices.) Wowee!

I have made these meatballs twice and they are without a doubt the best meatballs I've ever made. A keeper recipe for sure! I also made the sauce and it compliments the meatballs perfectly.

Very easy and was a huge hit for the meatball lovers in our family!

These meatballs were absolutely fantastic. I made it nearly verbatim to the recipe with the exception of the fennel (I couldn't find it at home, I SWEAR it was there earlier...?). I made along with the classic tomato sauce that's linked, and it was also amazing. I grated a bit of Parmigiano-Reggiano to add a bit of saltiness and flavour kick. Honestly, this was far superior to any other meatball recipe I've ever experienced.

Really delicious. The ricotta really is the secret to these. I skipped the fennel but otherwise made as directed. The classic tomato sauce recipe is a winner too...

Solid recipe that's simple to make, produces a nice batch (2 dozen... seriously? I ended up with almost 3 dozen) and a great consistency. The ricotta is a nice touch, but need to get really good quality stuff that has very low water content.

Ricotta Cheese? Try the "Konerkos" Big Batch recipe. More traditional.

I loved this recipe. It's exactly the kind of basic recipe I was seeking. I for one have NOT evolved past 60's meatballs!

I thought they turned out well, roasted not fried, but bland! Maybe that's why kids love them and they reminded people of their mother's. I would make them again but add some roasted garlic, some Romano, we've evolved past 1960's meatballs!

Delicious. I've made meatballs many times for my kids but this recipe is outstanding. I didn't have fennel so left it out, but otherwise followed the recipe. Maybe it's the ricotta -- the meatballs are so tender.

The BEST meatballs ever....they reminded me of the meatballs made by my mom many years ago in New Jersey!!! The ricotta really makes it. And they freeze beautifully too!
