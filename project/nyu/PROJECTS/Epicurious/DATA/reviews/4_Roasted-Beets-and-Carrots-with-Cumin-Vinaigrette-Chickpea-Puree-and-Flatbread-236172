Great flavors. Labor intensive, but worth it. I made a few changes because I wanted to serve it as an assembled flatbread. I spread the hummus on the flatbread, added very thinly sliced lemons, then scattered the golden beet mixture, then tucked in the red beets. I baked it at 450 until heated through. Served it to 8 of my friends. Rave reviews!

YUM. Good way to use up your beets and carrots from a winter CSA, right? The puree was super okay. It's always great to find a dish that you can start the night before, or have things roasting while you're getting ready for work or going for a short run around your neighborhood. I'd definitely make again.

I am addicted to this chickpea puree. I make it all of the time is place of hummus.

WOW! This is amazing. I did not separate the beets or the dressing and I added a little feta. Will make over and over!

this was absolutely delicious! i served with a toasted garlic nan flat bread from wholefoods. i made the chickpea puree (to be fair, i goofed on the puree - see note in that recipe), and it was so good! all the different layers just come together so nicely on the plate.

Roasting the beets and carrots do bring out an amazing flavor but, it took me literally twice as long to cook them as the receipe says! Maybe my oven is a bit low. A lot of peeling and chopping involved but the final flavor was great. I only made the roasted veggies and ate it with prepared hummus and feta cheese. Really flavorful. Also, I cut way back on the amount of oil and there was no problem.

The beets and carrots in the vinaigrette are delicious. The chickpea puree is too dry and needs lots more garlic. A few spices stirred into any store bought hummus would work better.

A very unique dinner and easy to make. We enjoyed this light, yet filling dish that is surely packed with great nutrition. I left out the toasted cumin seeds for ease and didn't seem to miss them. Also, we used the Mediterranean hummus from Costco which blended well with the dish. I am making this dish again tonight for friends.

Beets are my new favorite summer vegetable, and this recipe offers a great new way to prepare them. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand but I did have fresh cilantro, which I tossed in and felt it complemented the flavor nicely.

Was looking for a recipe for beets that I hadn't already made and came across this. We planned to have this as a side dish for our 'pre-Easter' dinner and didn't use the hummus or bread. I liked all the ingredients but found the directions fussy. We regularly roast beets (make a large foil packet, peel and quarter the beets, a little olive oil and pepper - great!) either in the oven or on the grill, so this seemed to be a cinch. Ended up frustrated by the directions so I made the dressing by combining the fresh thyme, cumin (rather than toasted seeds, crushed) red wine vinegar, parsley, shallots and lemon juice and tossed it on the vegetables when they were done. Very nice treatment for fresh beets and carrots, plus the colors looked great and spring-like, especially with all that parsley. Was enjoyed by all. Will definitely make again.

Excellent! To make it quick and easy: I used ground cumin, instead of grinding my own cumin. Omitted the parsley. Used Trader Joe's Mediterranean style Hummus (not the chickpea puree). Toasted the flatbreads, spread with the hummus, then topped with the roasted veggie mixture. We also sprinkled feta on the top. Very tasty, easy, and healthy.

pretty good. i wouldn't add the carrots--they didn't add much and were just added work with no return. (unless you're short of beets.) we served this on slices of rustic bread, smushing the beets down into the chickpeas. my wife really liked the chickpeas; i didn't find it much different from hummus.

"one large shallot, 1/4 c." does anyone at bon appetit know what a shallot IS?

Absolutely delicious. Cooking the beets this way, made the peeling very easy. The chickpea puree was better than most hummus I have tasted.

Excellent! Instead of serving with flatbread/chickpea puree, I crumbled fresh chevre over the dish. The tangy-ness of the chevre complemented the sweetness of the carrots and beets very nicely.

I am day dreaming about this recipe now that it's cold out and the farmers' markets are gone for the season. It's delicious on its own or with the bread and cheese. Simple and the cumin really compliments the sweetness of the carrots and beets. Two tips (which may be obvious to others but weren't to me): carrots need to be roasted less than the beets or they lose their crispness (become mush), AND you can half this recipe (it makes a lot and can get old on day five). Enjoy!

excellent dish - beets/carrots are great on their own and mixed together. you could use dry thyme for the carrots. I made a garlic hummus instead of the chickpea puree which worked out well.

delicious! no changes necessary. the carrots and the beets both grow sweeter with roasting and are nicely enhanced by the vinaigrette, thyme, and cumin. I was less impressed by the accompanying chickpea puree but my husband loved the combo.
