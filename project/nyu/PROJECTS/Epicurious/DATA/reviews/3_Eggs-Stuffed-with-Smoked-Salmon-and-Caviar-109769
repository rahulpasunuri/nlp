Not my favorite dish.

These were good but there are just much better things you can do with the expensive salmon and caviar. Not worth the expense.

I had a huge package of salmon (of the kind that comes in a big gift box) that I wanted to use up and thought this looked like the perfect opportunity. Also was entertaining some Russian friends and hoped to impress. It didn't happen, I'm afraid -- although I followed the recipe precisely, they came out dry and without much character. Maybe I can blame my choice of salmon, but I won't try again.

Easy to make, although I did not use as much smoked salmon as the recipe indicated. Everyone enjoyed these and it is an Easter staple

I have made this multiple times and believe me there are never leftovers. Make sure you strain the caviar as it may discolor the egg filling. My guests loved it! I have been asked to make it for many parties.

It was actually quite good, but just not really good. Some people really liked it, but it was the most overlooked item on the buffet at my party.

I made this recipe as instructed. My dad and his friends (all Russian) and the seafood lovers all went for it, but there were still a few left at the end.

These were excellent! We had them this weekend as a late afternoon snack. I wouldn't change a thing.
