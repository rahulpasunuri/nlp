Pleeeaase make this recipe actually vegan. (sans butter) any substitutes? (or change the tag)

Tasted the filling while making these... it lacked pizazz. I ended up doubling the total amount of spices and sprinkling in garlic salt. Also, I thought that the technique for buttering, cutting, and rolling the pieces needs a little clarification. Otherwise, awesome recipe!

Love this take on the traditional samosas. They were easy to make, delicious and the phyllo dough was a nice twist. I would probably add a little garlic next time and serve with apricot chutney, but they were a huge hit at my house.

I thought the filling was missing a bit of something. It didn't have the sort of spiciness/unctuousness that I expect from a samosa. I made these for a party and everyone liked them, but I thought it could have been brought to a different level somehow.

These were delicious and easy and straightforward to make. Sure, it's not necessarily an authentic samosa, but it makes for a yummy, yummy Indian-spiced appetizer. I might add some black pepper to the potato mix next time, but really, recipe is terrific as written.
