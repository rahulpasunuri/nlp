Made this for a last minute dinner at a friend's house and everyone (adult and kid) loved it. The only change I made was to use light coconut milk because that is what I had on hand. I will try it will full-fat next time. I would encourage cooks to use the unsweetened coconut that the recipe calls for, otherwise it could become too sweet. I did not use all the glaze on top, either. I think the base cake recipe is good, and plan to experiment with other flavors (sub dried cran for the chocolate; or do a lemon zest and blueberry combo for summer). Really good cake.

I used sweetened coconut in the cake. Rave reviews. The entire family liked it! Tips: Make sure you don't skimp on the orange zest or the salt (add a full 5 grams, or even a little more). Ideally, you should cook it to an internal temperature of 205 F. At 350 F, this cooked to an internal temp of 210 in 55 minutes. Needed foil tenting to avoid over-browning the coconut on top. It was great, but I like my coconut desserts on the moister side, and I would have preferred to take it out a bit sooner (205), but I didn't look until 55 min.

In my previous review, I forgot to note that I used canned unsweetened "light" coconut milk all three times I made this cake, and it was delicious! We can all cut down on fat without losing flavor.

We LOVE this cake! Made a few minor changes: used sweetened shredded coconut, added 1/2 tsp. coconut flavoring to the batter AND 1/4 tsp. coconut flavoring to the coconut drizzle. Also, used 8 oz. of the 62% bittersweet chocolate. Baked it 50 minutes, which was plenty of time. Our friends said it was their new favorite cake! I have made it at least 3 times, always with great comments from my guests.

Great cake but found the cooking time a little long. Check at 50 minutes to make sure it's not overcooked--because mine almost was. Also, has anyone thought about adding rum? I might try that next time.

love this cake! Actually doubled the orange zest as I like the flavor of it with the chocolate. Also added all the chocolate in the cake. Yummy!!

Wow, just wow. This is probably the BEST dessert that i have ever made. I am a baker for school and i'll tell you, the compliments just haven't stopped. The cake was rich, moist and creamy. Perfect. I used actually 16oz of coconut milk and it changed the cake completely. It was melt in your mouth, smooth and rich. Topped with toasted coconut and chocolate caramel sauce it was hit!!

This cake was pretty good, moist and pretty...but I think it could use some additional flavor and maybe the orange zest would do it, which I left out. Doubt I will make again, but it's not bad.

Wonderful recipe. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut so used sweetened and it was fine! Tastes just as good a few days after you bake it.

This is really good and not too sweet and dense. I found that it baked off in about 50 min. so keep an eye on it or it will easily dry out. Also, it definitely needs to be tented in foil to avoid burning the coconut topping.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was quite delicious! The only change I made was omission of the orange peel per other reviews. I also made it in a 9 inch springform pan, and it turned out perfectly.

I loved this recipe!!! A real treat.. you can really taste the orange zest - yum! If you cannot find unsweetened coconut flakes - don't worry. I made it with sweetened at it was perfect, really.

I made this exactly to the tee with the grated orange peel. It tasted great, you could barely taste the orange peel. The coconut drizzle is a must have on this cake because the cake itself isn't that sweet.

Because I love Mound Bars, I left out the orange rind. Made as directed increasing the amount of chocolate and slightly marbled the chocolate coconut topping into the batter. Just enough coconut was showing to brown and look interesting. Perfectly baked in 50 minutes, BUT...huge disappointment. Did not care fot the texture of the cake and thought it tasted bland, Gave it away to less discriminating eaters.

I, too, used chocolate chips, put in the orange peel, and followed the remainder of the recipe with a great result. Since I still had a dab of frosting in the freezer from making the Vanilla Bean-Coconut Cupcakes with Coconut Frosting (on this website--also delicious), I used it. Again, great results--the cake had a nice texture and wonderful flavor. I did need the tinfoil tent to keep the coconut on the top from getting too brown.

I used 'Earth Balance' instead of butter, since I have a dairy allergy, and it worked just as well. I used 1c whole wheat flour and 3/4 all purpose white flour. I baked this in an 11.5" x 9" pan and it cooked for 30 minutes. Absolutely delicious. I did not use the orange rinds. I used 1/4 tsp of orange extract- couldn't taste it, but I think it rounds out the overall flavor. I used dark chocolate chips, about 1cup total, and only unsweetened coconut for the mix and on top. I made the drizzle, which it doesn't necessarily need. Great recipe!

Made this cake for Valentine's Day. It was a great hit. I baked it in a heart shaped springform pan. I did have to used tented foil while baking, as coconut topping did start to brown. I cut the orange peel to 1 t. after reading the reviews, and barely tasted it in the cake (I used dried orange peel from Mccormick spices rather than actual peel). Used the yummy drizzle which did not make it too sweet as some other posters said. The cake itself (without drizzle) is not overly sweet. My family LOVED the cake. Very moist, although a tad dry around the edges only, but that may be because of the pan I used. It is a keeper and I will most definitely make it again soon.

Moist, but not overly flavorful. I served this as a brunch coffee cake, which was a mistake on my part. The suggestion to accompany with vanilla ice cream should have told me the cake is more appropriate for dessert than breakfast. It was very easy to make, and I'd probably make the cake again in a pinch if in need something quick and uncomplicated. I too left out the orange, as it seemed not to fit.

Absolutely delicious - an instant favorite with my family. Will definitely keep the ingredients stocked at all times. Before making for the first time I took note of several reviews and made the following adjustments: no orange peel, cut the sugar by 1/3 to compensate for using sweetened coconut, and used Nestles semi-sweet chunks.

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper. The recipe was simple to make (even with my 3 y/o playing the part of the lovely assistant) and easily adaptable for ingredients. I used dried orange peel instead of fresh because it was what I had kicking around. I was happy to see I either had all the ingredients at the house or something that could be substituted for it. It was nice to see that the recipe held up to some simple changes (used only sweetened coconut, used morsels instead of chunks, etc)

What a moist, yummy cake. I made a few minor changes: I used Ghirardelli 60% dark chocolate chips instead of breaking up a bar, I used lowfat coconut milk because that's what I had on hand, used unsweetened coconut for the top, and didn't use all of the chocolate (3oz) for the top. I also used only about a scant teaspoon of the orange zest which brightened up the flavor. I think the 2t of zest would be too much. Cake was tasty with just the drizzle. The only thing I would change is to swirl the toppings a bit into the batter because when I turned the cake out, some of the coco/choc mixture stuck to the plate because it's just sitting on top with no way to stick to the cake. We were forced to eat those wayward bits.

People who rated this 4 forks left out the orange peel. I wish I'd done the same. I love the taste of orange and chocolate, but the coconut went entirely missing in the process which was a waste of coconut. Incidentally when a recipe calls for unsweetened coconut which I can't find easily here, I just run hot water over the sweetened variety to wash off sugar, and let it dry on paper towels. I'd try this again without the organge peel since the cake seemed moist and nice.

Yum! We loved this cake - tasted like a Mounds candy bar. We didn't find this cake to be too dry on the first and second days... can't comment on day three, by then it was all gone. The only changes we made were to leave out the orange zest, and substitute 3/4 cup of semi- sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate pieces. This recipe has been added to our "favorites" and will be made again and again.

This was a keeper. Moist, easy, and very satisfying. YUM! Perfect balance of coconut and chocolate. I really enjoyed it. I'd probably give it 3 1/2 forks if that were an option, as it wasn't spectacular, but 3 didn't seem like enough. I did leave out the orange peel, as that didn't seem to fit.

FANTASTIC cake and loved by all who tried it. It was still very rich after substituting light coconut milk for regular coconut milk, so I will do so again the next time (and the next time...) that I make this.

I didn't make it exactly as stated because I wanted to use up most of a fresh frozen grated coconut and its milk. I discovered I didn't have bittersweet chocolate but had a bag of special dark Hersheys chips and used those. I did use about 1 t or T of evaporated milk with the coconut milk because I thought it might be too thin. The coconut on top was the unsweeted grated. And not having fresh orange peel I used half as much dried. Also I put half the chips in the cake and half on top. It made for not quite enough inside but too much on top...BUT...This cake was FANTASTIC and moist and incredible. It is totally worth it to use fresh coconut and its milk if you have to use a coconut for something else (part of). Save the rest for this!!

Very, tasty and easy to throw together. I used a bundt pan and baked for exactly 60 minutes, tented the last 15, came out perfect. I used unsweetened coconut flakes even on top and sprinkled a bit of sure on top which gave it a nice crunch. I didn't use the glaze since it was just for me an hubby, but if I take it to an event I'll use the glaze too, I'm sure it will be yum.

Baked this for work Wednesday. I used the whole 391 ml of coconut milk (accidently) and added another 1/2 cup flour to compensate. The aroma of the sweet freshly baked cake and butter filled my home. There's nothing better than home cooking. Wonderful! I did not use the orange zest. Nor the drizzle, the cake was so moist, it didn't need it. I would however, use a 9X14 pan next time and bake for about 35 min. Great recipe!

I made this with what I had on hand, which meant sweetened coconut and a mix of bittersweed chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup to compensate and skipped the orange zest, because in my opinion, chocolate and fruit don't mix. I covered with foil after 30 minutes to prevent the coconut from burning and then baked an additional 25 minutes. Turned out moist and delicious!

Made this cake with all sweet coconut & large dark chocolate chips & the zest. No icing -- at first I thought it was dry & wasn't thrilled with the orange. But as time went by the cake mellowed, and the moisture evened out. (you need to keep it tightly covered) I will make this again, but I will make it at least one day before needed that seems best for this cake.

so great...i don't know about the other reviews, i was worried because i didn't have any ice cream on hand, but i found the cake to be really moist. i did not bake it as long as stated in the recipe. i really enjoyed this for dessert after making the salmon fennel salad from this same issue, another satisfying recipe. dessert tonight and most likely breakfast tomorrow.

I made this into cupcakes and I added 1/4 cup oil after the eggs... it was moist and wonderfully light... I even added some zest to the glaze because I love chocolate and orange combined...

I thought this cake was yummy. I am not a fan of the orange and chocolate combo and after making this cake, I am sorry to say still not a fan. That's why I only gave it 3 forks. I think the cake would be better with just the Almond Joy combo of chocolate, coconut and almond. Will totally make this again and everyone else loved it. It's in my recipe box and is a nice change from a coffee cake.

Rating: 4
Excellent as is. I think the orange zest controversy must be a matter of taste - I thought it was perfect - and the "dry" quality is what, I think, qualifies the cake as a coffee cake - needs ice cream or whipped, and some beverage. Easy to make, very nice - used both unsweetened and sweetened coconut, per the directions.

Rating: 3
This cake was so close to getting 4 forks. My only issue was that it was too dry, but that was ameliorated with vanilla ice cream. I also used sweetened coconut and cut back on the sugar. The icing came out clear so it didn't show on top like it does in the picture. I think I will make it again but next time with less flour and add some rum!

Have made this twice in two weeks to great reviews. Made exactly as is, orange zest is not overpowering but perfect. Tented top last half of cooking so it did not dry out. I live at 6500ft and the middle actually cooked. Moist and delicious for any occasion.

Rating: 2
I totally agree with thew last reviewer the porange zest was overpowering, this should have been called orange coconut chocolate cake. if i made again i would not use any zest, just more vanilla. I used Lindt milk chocolate bars and they were good in it. im only giving it @ forks for now, once i try agaion withoput zest may raise it.

Rating: 4
Excellent, but I regret not following my instincts. The orange zest is overwhelming and in my opinion,orange and chocolate are all wrong, but coconut is the perfect pairing with dark chocolate. I'd definitely make this again, omitting all orange zest and increasing vanilla a bit.

We used a bundt pan, which turned out well. I liked it, especially the crunchy top. A bit drier than I would have hoped though. My daughter LOVED it "so much." We did not apply the sugar drizzle, since we had used sweetened coconut.
