beautiful luscious easy easy chocolate sauce ,so black and glossy. Rich, buttery caramel, perfect for ice cream topping or creating the most indulgent turtle brownies. Package these 2 sauces together in a basket with some soda fountain ice cream dishes and a nice scoop for a real treat of a gift thats fast easy and inexpensive.

I needes a recipe for easy, simple chocolate sauce for prfiterolles, and this one was delicous. I didn't even make the "tan" sauce, but if it's 1/2 as good as the chocolate sauce, it will be a wonderful combination.
