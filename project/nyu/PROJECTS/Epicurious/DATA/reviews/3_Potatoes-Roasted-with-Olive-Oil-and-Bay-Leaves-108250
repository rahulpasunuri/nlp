this was good but time consuming a bit. I'd make it again. Found another great - sbut simple - recipe for PURPLE potatoes at www.thegrilllife.com

Too many bay leaves! Flavor too strong and they were a nuisance when eating. Also, too much salt.

I thought that this recipe could have turned out okay, but I cooked it for far more than the time prescribed, and my potatoes were still underdone. I get the impression that other reviewers had a similar problem, but I don't really understand how, when a baked potato usually only takes 45 minutes. I suppose that the skin usually traps more steam. Overall, I think that I have better recipes for roasted potatoes. I might borrow the herbes de provence, though.

My new favorite red potatoe recipe! I ended up cooking them at 450 (I cooked them wtih another dish at the same time). The higher temp make them crunchy on the outside yum!

I'd make this again with fresh bay leaves instead of dry. I didn't think they tasted any different than potatoes roasted without bay leaves, but lucky for me I love plain old roasted potatoes!

I love potatoes, and these were a treat.

I made these a couple of weeks ago. They were ok. I didn't use much bay leaves, but it had too much bay leaves taste. The potato was cooked good, but the taste was too much.

These were very tasty. I put a bay leaf in each slit; I don't know why people are worried about 'wasting' bay leaves. It's not like they're expensive. I roasted mine for an hour and 35 minutes, and I used sea salt with herbs mixed right in, in addition to the herbes de Provence. Very tasty.

I agree that they needed a much longer cooking time to be sufficiently roasted. I didn't feel like wasting all those bay leaves and used one per potato with sea salt and fresh thyme and some of the herbs listed. They turned out really well and had a wonderful flavor.

These are delicious as are, but at times I've also added garlic and changed the herbs, using rosemary, oregano and thyme. A sprinkling of red chili flakes adds another dimension, as well. These are great done on the BBQ, as well. Very adaptable recipe.

Followed the recipe using Hawaiian Pink Sea Salt. It was just a bit too salty for me so next time I'll reduce the salt. But it is an attractive side dish that lends itself to many entrees.

This recipe was just okay. Presentation was good, but flavor wasn't quite what I was hoping for. It also needed much longer baking time. If I were to make this again, I would change the spices a bit.

Overuse of Bay Leaves. What does the person do with so many on their plate. Bay leaf is also very strong.

These were fragrant and delicious... a word of warning, if you use regular salt, you have to reduce the quantity by half.

We made this for company and everyone loved it. Excellent, very easy and great presentation. Will definitely make again many times.

Served with a basic meatloaf. Delicious. I will definitely make again, but as another reviewer suggested, I'll cut through a little more and fan so that herbs are better distributed and potatoes are cooked a little more. Mine were just slightly underdone, but still yummy. I also added thin garlic slices as someone else suggested.

Made this for a dinner party. It was a hit and I would definitely make this again.

What a wonderful discovery that the bay leaves flavor the roasted potatoes so well! These were tasty, and I agree, a great accompaniment to grilled foods. We used fresh bay leaves from our herb garden. Regarding the comment of the first reviewer, I thought it goes without saying to not eat the bay leaves.

Pretty basic with excellent flavor. Try to find the bay leaves wholesale at a large produce market, otherwise they can be expensive. Presentation is great. Everyone loved it.

It was good, not great. But it definitely needs a longer cooking time. I'm beginning to think that I didn't cut the slits far down enough. Maybe the potatoes need to fan open a little to accept more seasoning. Will try again.

Very simple recipe with a great presentation. An excellent compliment to a grilled dinner-- I served with seared ahi tuna. Cook a little longer than the recipe indicates-- mine were just a bit undercooked.

My friend and I loved these potatoes. My daughter HATED it! Oh well! Different strokes for different folks I guess,

This was very easy and the presentation was lovely. I was amazed at the flavor in the potatoes. I made this dish for the family, but will definitely make it for company at the next opportunity.

Red Potatoes are a family favorite and I'm sure roasted like this will be their favorite dish.

Nice recipe. Simple and very adaptable. For example, it's summer and we're all cooking outside, right? So adapt for what I like to call Hobo Packs, a staple of every grilling/BBQ. Simply wrap the prepared spuds loosely in foil and place around the perimiter of the grill. Also works great with small taters tossed w/ oil, S/P, Herbes de, and halved garlic cloves. Spice them up w/ habanero peppers, if you dare.

So simple and easy! Both times I served this guests were impressed and complemented the flavors. Little do they know it takes no effort.

I tried this receipe two weeks ago and my husband and I loved it. We did remove the bay leaves prior to eating the potatos. I served it with the Jamaican Jerk Beef Tenderlion and the Aspargus receipe in the same issue. GREAT MEAL!!

Nice presentation and easy to prepare. I will make it again. Potatoes turned out savory; crunchy on the outside and creamy within. To the cook concerned about eating bay leaves, I assumed they were to be removed after cooking. We did, and the potatoes were delicious.

What a great, subtle change to my usual repertoire! I tried it with some fresh sage leaves, instead of the bay, and loved that with grilled chicken, and I suppose any fresh herbs would work well in order to coordinate with the entree.

I am loving this collection of receipes, however, this one I question. I thought one was not to eat a bay leaf? I will try this, sans the bay leaf, with a lot of herb de provence. BTW, I use so much herb de provence, it enhances almost all dishes.
