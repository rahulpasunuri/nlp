It's a lot of salt for the rub, but you only use a little bit of the rub. The flavors are great.

spotted this and knew I already had the salmon and my husband was on his way with fresh corn. Got home and had to "punt". Mostly changed the rub to a sauce with 1/4 cup chipotle in adoba sauce, garlic and oregano. Followed the rest except for the epazote leaves (left them out). Delicious beyond most mid week dinners! Will do it again. Have sauce left over...

The salmon was moist and firm fleshed. I did change part of the recipe some what. I did not use the butter on each piece. Since it was the middle of winter, fresh corn with husks were in short supply. I used dried husks, soaked them in water to make them more pliable and rather than brake temperatures of 5 above zero (that is F) I did it in the oven. Still came out great and to rave reviews from our group.

Very good dish for sure,i skipped all the salt though seemed too much i also used Mahi Mahi a very nice firm fish for this same recipe. I liked it with a lot of lemon juice squeezed over it. Odd i know but verrrrry goood!!

1 1/2 cups of salt, is that a typo?!?! Do to the fact that I have made some great food off of this Web site and that I really value and trust other cooks input I went ahead and used about 3/4 of the salt it called for. Maybe Im just naive and too trusting but the finished results were almost inedible with that amount of salt! Please tell me Im not crazy and its a typo. Without that this recipe would have been wonderful but for the people who are considering trying this...PLEASE, PLEASE dont use all that salt!!!

Oh My!!! It was A LOT of work. Making the rub is very time consuming and makes loads, when all you use is 1 1/2 teasepoons! While I was making it I swore no matter how good it was it would be the last time! When all was said and done, I had to go back on my word! The flavors are wonderful together, and the presentation is really beautiful. GREAT for entertaining. Make this and look like a true gourmet! I'm looking forward to dazzling my friends with this one.

The only real work in making this recipe is the rub. And, the recipe makes so much, and lasts practically forever, so you have a great rub for steaks, chops, chicken, etc. I make the rub often (but I cut the salt in half) and have made this recipe several times. Once I used banana leaves and it was awesome!

too much work - and I love to cook! Good flavor, beautiful presentation, fussy fussy recipe. I would just pop the salmon/corn mixture in some tin foil and bake it next time - save myself 45 minutes. I did not have fun making this.

Delicious--this would be good for entertaining as it is visually appealing as well. If I made it again I would not make as much of the ancho chili rub.

This recipe requires lenghty prep, but it's well worth the effort. I made this for my girlfriend and she loved it, eventhough, she says she does not like fish. try it you'll like it.
