We used less soy sauce (about 1/4 cup) and braised the ribs meat side down in the marinade, turning them meat side up for the last 30 min to brown. Next time we will probably try barbecuing for the last 30 min in order to reduce the amount of fat in the meat.

A winner! Used baby back ribs... cut into two-rib pieces before marinating... used white wine instead of sherry, and homemade watermelon jam in place of chutney... and the result was delicious. Not too much soy, not too much anything. Just yummy.

Fabulous! Simple substitutions for lack of the correct ingredients: I used sake instead of sherry (hey, it's made from rice so I figured it'd be okay), doubled the ginger, ditto the garlic and cayenne. I also cooked it more slowly -- at about 275 for 4 hours. The meat was falling off the bone, my 12 guests were drooling and there was literally one lone rib left. Everyone wanted the recipe!

These ribs are just incredible; double the recipe for the marinade, though, in order to have enough to generously baste. They're definitely worth the prep time the night before.

We thought it was great, though I would use back ribs not spare ribs. I like a stickier sauce, so I will probably double the chutney and put it through a blender. The chutney I bought had huge mango chunks.

I made this recipe with twice the ginger and garlic, cut the ribs, and marinated in ziplock bags. I baked them for 90 minutes and cooked down the marinade. Then barbacued them for 5 or 10 minutes and brushed them with more marinade. Was very, very good.

Outstanding!!! This recipe produced really tender, moist, flavorful ribs. A bit too salty tho. Will cut back on soy sauce next time. Otherwise wouldn't change anything else. Great alternative to BBQ. This is a keeper. Best BBQ is Smoked Baby Back Ribs with Hoisin-honey Glaze (BA 7/01 pg. 104).

This was downright disgusting. If I could give it a negative zero I would. This tasted like pure soy sauce, which annihilated any other flavors in all the ingredients I wasted. WAYYYY too much soy sauce.

This is an AMAZING recipe and a simple way to make ribs. We devoured them, I also enjoyed making them. I searched high and low for this recipe! It's a keeper!!!!

Instead of spareribs, I used pork tenderloin. It was to die for!! The combination of sweet and spicy is delightful. I served the leftovers on focaccia bread spread with more of the chutney and it was an instant hit.

Great flavor. For better absorption, we marinated the ribs in sections in two plastic bags. These would also make great appetizers. My kids gobbled them up.

Delicious. I used more chutney and substituted balsalmic so it wasn't too salty from the soy sauce. Also added a little brown sugar when prepared the sauce for glazing.

I used lamb ribs instead of spareribs.The ribs were tender & delicious. With the repeated bastings they took on a rich coating & the flavors of the marinade were wonderful. Will do again.

Excellent! I would definately make this again, but next time I would double the marinade as I found the ribs slightly dry. Great Taste and was well received by my husband.

Great recipe. Used baby back ribs and made extra marinade. Very flavourful and very easy.

These weren't bad, but they weren't too flavorfull. The glaze didn't add enough flavor to the ribs.
