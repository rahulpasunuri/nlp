I lowered my rating because I don't understand why the directions call for boiling the sprouts. Steaming is a much better way to go when preparing vegetables. That being said, steam the sprouts (fresh only please, frozen--bleh), 8 to 10 minutes as indicated, toss with butter, plenty of kosher salt and pepper. Delicious.

Something that I would like to mention for those who have never cooked brussel sprouts before: Try to find small ones and buy frozen rather than fresh. Maybe it's just us, but my mother and I find that the frozen ones are less bitter, as with the smaller sized ones. Enjoy!

I'm intrigued by Pam Powers' suggestion of shredding the sprouts. Question is: how do you do that? Box grater? Food processor? Thanks for the help!

My favorite way to make brussels sprouts. Make sure to cut a deep X in the bottom of the sprouts so they cook all of the way through. Yum!

I didn't rate this recipe because I was more inspired by the ideas of the reviewers than the original recipe. Based on their ideas I made a dish that was devoured by my family -- especially my 5-year old (which qualifies as a minor miracle). I shredded the brussel sprouts (thanks Pam Powers), sauteed them in butter/garlic/lemon/lemon zest/s+p then added a good splash of cream (thanks Jeanette Stewart). Along with the shredded sprouts I sauteed chopped red bell peper and white onion. This was so fabulous and different, and it was a pretty presentation too. I will absolutely make this again!!!

I loved the idea of pairing the brussel sprouts w/quinoa, but modified the reader's recipe a little bit. I added some toasted pine nuts, used grapeseed oil to saute the red pepper and garlic in, and rather than using whole sprouts, I shredded them, then added them to the peppers and garlic at the very end. As soon as the shredded sprouts were wilted, I added the mix to the quinoa. And my husband loved the greek yogurt idea - so, thank you!

Easiest, should you have a microwave, is to clean the sprouts, making sure to make a cross-cut in the bottom, put in a baking dish, cut cold butter over the sprouts with lots of freshly cracked black pepper, cover and microwave until tender (20 sprouts take about 5 minutes).

Yum. While I was a little put off by the other reviews, I just made this for lunch and it was quite good. The brussel sprouts are a little bitter, but not any more so than broccoli rabe or any other bitter green. My lunch would terrify children, but it's healthy and suprisingly good. After boiling the sprouts, I added them to sauteed garlic and red peppers. Then I added cooked quinoa, salt and pepper and--inspired by the whipping cream in another review--a dollop of greek yogurt to make it more moist. Sounds gross, I know, but I'll have it again.

I didn't rate this recipe because I'm still not certain if it was the recipe or the raw material that wasn't up to par. It's been years since I bought sprouts to cook - they just always seem so bitter. The one's at the market looked so good I thought I'd give them a try and I was looking for a simple recipe just like this one. I took the suggestions of adding minced garlic (most sauteed veggie dishes benefit from this)but it was to no avail! They were still too bitter for me to tolerate. Maybe I'll give them one more try with sprouts still on the stalk from Whole Foods Market-but for now give me green beans!!!

The kids loved this! I boiled them as the recipe suggested. I then made a butter sauce with garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, whipping cream, salt, pepper, and balsamic. Halfed the sprouts and added them to the sauce and served over pasta with grated parmesan. All of my kids asked me to make it again. Not the overcooked mush I was served as a child! This was a great way to introduce this vegetable to the family. However, I'm sure it would be healthier with olive oil and minus the whipping cream....

I have not tried this recipe. I usually cut them in half. Mix with garlic, olive oil, S&P. Put them in 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes. Broil them for a few min at the end.

To those knocking this "recipe", some of us have never made Brussel Sprouts and have no idea how long to cook them etc. Not all of us are natural cooks, that's why we come to this site.

Add diced bacons strips into the sautee

Recipe is better if you add a little balsamic vinegar and some salt. Otherwise it's a little bland.

Duh. As the first reviewer (Hoboken) says, this isn't a recipe. What the others didnt' understand was that Hoboken was saying, "Who doesn't already know to steam and add butter, or simply sautee in butter?"

Tonight I was in a hurry and needed a way to cook the sprouts I had purchased that didn't require adding bacon, cooking the spouts first, or adding ingredients I didn't have on hand, so I was delighted to find Pam Powers posting for this vegetable, which you can find below. They were delicious and easy, and I'll surely make them this way many more times.

The recipe was accurate as brussel sprouts shouldn't be "doctored up." However, you should add ultra-fine strips of lemon peel. Shredding or leaving them whole is a matter of one's personal preference.

We tried Pam Power's method of stir-frying shredded sprouts and garlic in butter (didn't have any lemon). Yum! Never thought we'd like Brussels sprouts, but these were great.

I don't see what the problem is. You don't always have to gild the lily. Often a simple treatment is what's called for, as when a the meat dish this is to accompany already has a rich complex sauce. This goes great with pork chops with shallots and cranberry glaze, wild rice with mushrooms.

THAT'S a recipe? Give me a break!

I agree that the recipe is too plain as is and agree with the review that says to add lemon and garlic. However, I shred my sprouts instead of cooking them whole and saute' them with the butter, lemon and garlic. A quick stir so that they are crisp-tender makes them wonderful! I've converted many a "non-sprout-eater" with this recipe.

If that's a "recipe," then I should write a cookbook.

I agree that brussel sprouts need more than just butter. I like them with a little lemon juice and dill weed. However, this recipe is called Buttered Brussel Sprouts. What did you people expect?

Plain Jane-add fresh lemon juice and grated parm cheese and salted butter.

I love Brussel Sprouts, but prefer to brown the butter before drizzling over the sprouts.

No kick to the salivary glands with plain butter. try sauteing several cloves of garlic, minced in the butter (Do not brown). Add the juice of 1 lemon to the butter/garlic mixture and pour over sprouts. Adds a nice taste to these small cabbages
