I'm giving this 4 forks for potential even though my experiment with it failed. I tried substituting 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 of the cups of white flour to make it a touch healthier. Because of this I neaded it longer and let it rise longer. My experimentation failed and I ended up with a big flat crisp cracker instead of fluffy, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside focaccia. Don't make my mistake! Use white flour! The topping was delish!

Wonderful as is!! The second time I prepared it, I added about three medium cloves garlic, slivered, to the onion topping! I made to sure to cool the focaccia on a cookie rack to prevent the crust from softening.

I've always been itimidated by focaccia - maybe because it's so hard to spell! This recipe is so easy that I immediately repeated the recipe right afterwards from memory. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday party (all guys), they loved it. I'm glad I made two!

Loved this. The dough is stickier than in other versions (maybe add more flour?) but that seemed to contribute to the texture (crunchier on the outside than other focaccias). The topping is out of this world, definitely try the topping (sage!) even if you don't make the bread. Another bonus: preparation is relatively simple.

Just perfect when eaten right out of the oven- hot, tasty, just a bit crunchy on the outside, but perfectly soft in the inside. Easy to make too. Substituted the dried sage with dried oregano- worked fine. Guaranteed recipe for onion lovers!

This is a very good focaccia recipe for onion lovers like myself! It had a wonderful texture and was fairly easy to make. A keeper for this cook.
