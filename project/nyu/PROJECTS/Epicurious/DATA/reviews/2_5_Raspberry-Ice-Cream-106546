So I'm about to become one of those reviewers who says a recipe is awesome even though I didn't make it as it is written. Ignore me if you are one of those people that this annoys. I started here, since I had no idea how to make a raspberry ice cream, but I could quickly see changes I would want to make. First, I used 2-12 oz bags of unsweetened raspberries, I'm not interested in the heavy syrup. I softened them, did not fully thaw. This led to less cooling time, and in fact made it possible to put the mixture directly into the ice cream maker. I like my raspberries in part for the high dietary fiber they provide, which requires the seeds. So, I didn't want to strain them after pureeing them. Since I'm not a corn fan, I used arrowroot instead of cornstarch. This seems to have kept the custard from curdling, so I didn't need to strain that either. The end result of this was an ice cream that was exactly what I was hoping to find - all the health benefits of a raspberry in ice cream form. There's no other recipe I've found that gets me anywhere close to here.

Yummy, however i pureed the raspberries a bit too much with my vita mix, so everything made it past the sieve. I had no problems and made it as instructed.

if you boil the custard, it will taste like scrambled eggs. duh.

Three stars provided you take Jason's advice of ditching the cornstarch and adding the third yolk. I used fresh raspberries. The ice cream had a wonderful taste, though the texture left a lot to be desired because of ice crystals. Increasing the time in the ice-cream maker & the heavy cream to milk ratio should do the trick.

First off, when you are making ice cream base, the mixture should never look curdled. You want a smooth velvety texture before you take it off. The problem with this recipe is the addition of cornstarch. If you omitted the cornstarch, there would be no need to boil the mixture (To make the cornstarch set, egg yolks will curdle, and you are straining half of your flavour out.) If you use this recipe, omit the cornstarch, add another egg yolk, temper the yolks before adding them and gently heat over medium heat until slightly thickened.

Yes, the ice cream is bland. The flavor improves greatly, however, after it has been transfered and frozen in the freezer.

Bland and boring. Save yourself some trouble and just have the raspberries with cream.
