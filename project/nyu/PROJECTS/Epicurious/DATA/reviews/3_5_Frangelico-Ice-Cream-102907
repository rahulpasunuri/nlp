Made this tonight, one word...Delish! In the last five minutes of chilling I added chopped pieces of Guittard milk chocolate and Trader's Joe semi sweet chips. The ending result is totally remarkable. I must say though, that the ice cream tasted great without the additions, I just happen to love chocolate and add it whenever possible!

Outstanding ice cream. I have been making it for years to serve with different desserts. It goes great with Blackberry Cobbler. I cut back a little on the Frangelico and add a little Nutella.

This is absolutely delicious ice cream. I served it with a very chocolatey cake, and the two tasted great together.

A fabulous recipe- rich and creamy. The Frangelico was not too overpowering.

This was good and easy to make...mine ad a bit of a chalky aftertaste, though. I probably overcooked it a bit. Will try again.

I had high expectations but was somewhat disappointed - the frangelico flavour was too strong for my taste. I do think, however, that using less of the frangelico and not overcooking the custard, would improve this recipe for me and others who like the taste of liquor to be present but subtle. I do suggest adding any liquor during the last 2 to 5 minutes of chilling, because the alcohol content can impair the chilling process if added too early.

Simple enough for even me to make, have never been a big fan of "plain" ice cream, but this one is full of flavor.

This ice cream was easy to make and absolutely wonderful! I subsituted honey for the sugar -- which gave it a great undertone. I served it with a Boysenberry Sauce and toffee sprinkled on the top. It was well received at a dinner party.

A really simple ice cream recipe with heavenly results. If you don't like the hazelnut flavour of Frangelico you could easily subsitute a coffee liquer.
