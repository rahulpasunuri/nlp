Absolutely superb. My Argentine partner raved about this pan dulce, saying it is the best he has ever tasted! The bread was beautifully moist and spongy, chewy, with just the right amount of sweetness. Would just suggest adding an egg wash glaze before baking, for a gorgeous shiny top.

this is too good to keep just for Christmas; i made a loaf and we nibble on it during the week for snacks or to take to work and toast. its very popular!

update: this year i tried to double the recipe, with little success. the breads did not rise properly; i baked them anyway and they are ok, if dense. the breads also improve after sitting for a day, according my porteño husband who loves the original.
