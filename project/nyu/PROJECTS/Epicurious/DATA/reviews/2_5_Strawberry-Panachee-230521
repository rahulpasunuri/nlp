Thought this was a little strange. The cookies were distracting, like sand in the bottom, but it wouldn't be "dessert" with just the other two ingredients. The kids liked it, though. I did use butter cookies instead of shortbread. Might make a difference, though it does say any cookies would do, or other berries, for that matter...

My company liked it alot, and it took very little time to prepare. Had everything ready and just divided. Was glad I had read the Hints from the Test Kitchen. Had Danish butter cookies that come in a tin, so used them. It might have been my strawberries, but I used more jam, a little sugar, and some lemon juice added to the puree. Had Greek yogurt, so used it mixed with a little sugar and basalmic vinegar. Tasted great. Used wine glasses.
