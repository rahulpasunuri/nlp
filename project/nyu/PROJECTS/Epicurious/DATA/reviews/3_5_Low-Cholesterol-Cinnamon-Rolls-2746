Wonderful Christmas Cinnamon Rolls! We used Tupelo honey and followed the recipe exactly as written. Four forks...and a BIG red ribbon :-):-)

These were great! I left out the raisins and baked in a glass 9"x13" dish, but otherwise followed the recipe. The dough was quite sticky after mixing, but the finished buns were very tender, which everyone liked. I threw some pecans in the bottom of half of the pan, and they caramelized beautifully. This will be my recipe from now on!

very good cinnamon rolls. As one other reviewer did, I put the rolls in the fridge overnight for the final rise. The only problem I encountered with this is that some of the egg white/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture ran out of the rolls, so they weren't as flavorful as they might have been and made a mess to clean up. Next time I will bake them on the same day I prepare them.

oh, also I soaked the raisins in rum and prune juice (left over from a brisket recipe on this site, we never drink it)as the dough was rising. I gently squeezed the rum/juice out before sprinkling the plump raisins on the rolled out dough.

I also used 1/2 whole white, 1/2 white flour--it was fine. Before 'rolling' out the dough for the eggwhite/cinnamon/raisin roll up YOU CAN REFRIGERATE it for 15 minutes or so. That makes it easy to roll. Or do as I did and use a chilled marble stone. Using dental floss, instead of a knife to cut the roll into rolls, is an old bakers trick. It works well if the dough is too warm (not chill as suggested above.) Finally, as others have said a glaze made of powdered sugar and milk (add the milk or water several drops at a time--it only takes at little)...I add lemon/lime, in place of some of the water/milk. Yum, lemon glaze!

I made ~25 mini rolls instead of 10 large one and found them to be quite tough/hard. Perhaps with bigger rolls it would have been softer. I also used butter instead of egg whites and found the filling melt and run all over the pan, later to harden into a burnt candy mess. To make up for it, I drizzled a butter rum/molasses icing on top, which pretty much saved it. I'd be willing to give this another shot, but I wasn't impressed with the first go-around. Funny thing is, everyone who tried them seemed to really like them!

Very good recipe. I followed directions, the only change was substituting half of the flour with whole-wheat. My kids loved them.

I did monkey with this one a bit just for fun. I used maple syrup instead of honey. I also used a high sided pan, made a glaze from syrup, brown sugar and water, spread it on the bottom of the already greased pan, put the rolls in just barely touching each other. Let them rise like in the recipe, baked same as recipe, turned them out glaze side up.....delicious.

These cinnamon rolls were quite good. I used Brummel and Brown yogurt spread in place of the eggs as I was out of eggs. Next time I think I will under cook the rolls a few minutes to make them a bit more delicate. Made a glaze with powdered sugar, water, yogurt spread and vanilla. Everyone loved them! Next time I will soak my raisins in rum to make them plump and juicy.

Loved these and so did everyone else! I actually doubled the batch and made 2 dozen rolls. The egg whites instead of butter was a great idea! However, I found that I had too much egg white while spreading it on the dough because when you cut them the filling oozes out if there is too much of the egg white. Next time I'll probably use less. Also, I didn't have vegetable oil, but only olive oil which I used, and it turned out fine. In the end before baking when it says to brush with oil what I did was spray them with low-fat cooking spray which worked as well.

Easy to make, even without experience making yeast breads, and devoured by my guests! Used dental floss to cut the dough into rolls and drizzled lightly with a glace after baking. Even my scandinavian mother, who's an amazing baker, was impressed. Next time I'll make them the night before and do the final rise in the fridge as suggested by other reviewers.

Amazingly decadent! A bit time consuming, but all yeast bread recipes are. I tried this recipe because I thought the potato would give the dough the soft, chewy texture I was looking for..and it did! Instead of egg whites washed on the dough I brushed butter before dredging the rolled out dough with a much heavier amount of cinnamon in the sugar mixture. The sugar mixture was dark and heavy enough that the dough was not visible through the mixture. I cut 12 rolls and put them in a pan about 11"x8", eliminating the harder edges sometimes found on cinnamon buns. Better than Cinnabons!

This end result of this recipe were yummy well-risen rolls. It IS time consuming, but so is anything having to do with yeast-risen doughs. Just work them around your schedule! I made them at night and put them in the fridge to do their final rise, and baked them in the a.m. . The trick to rolling out the dough into a rectangle is to roll it out initially flat, let it rest a few minutes, and then roll it out the rest of the way. The gluten, which produces the stretchiness of the dough, relaxes when given time to rest. I work at a lumber mill, and all 52 people on the day shift gave rave reviews! Oh yes, one of the people who rated it last gave a recipe for cream cheese icing...cut it in half and it'll STILL be generous.

These cinnamon rolls were yummier than some of the ones you get at restaurants/shops. HUGE ROLLS! Awesome, chewy, fluffy, springy dough. I susbstituted pure maple syrup for the honey and brushed on some veggie butter (non-trans fat/low fat) in palce of the egg whites. I also drizzled some glaze (1.5 cups powdered sugar and about .25 cup evaporated milk) as soon as I took them out of the oven ..... to die for! Mine made about 15 Huge rolls! YUMMY IN THE TUMMY!

These cinnamon rolls are better than the ones you get at some restaurants/shops. Awesome, chewy, fluffy, springy dough. HUGE ROLLS! I substituted pure maple syrup for the honey and brushed on some whipped veggie butter(non trans-fat/low fat) instead of egg whites, and they were to die for. I also drizzled some glaze (1.5 cups of powdered sugar and about .25 cup of evaporated milk) over the rolls as soon as i took them out of the oven. YUMMY! Mine made about 15 huge rolls!

Chewy, gooey & very cinnamon-y. I was quite skeptical about a low-cholesterol recipe, but after all the great reviews decided to give it a try. Well worth it, and didn't miss the butter at all! Make these rolls!

Besides my Grandmother's rich cinnamon rolls, these are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made and eaten. I found the preparation to be simple especially with an electric mixer and "dough hook" attachment. They do take time to prepare but so do many other cinnamon roll recipes. The rolls freeze well and reheat nicely in the microwave.

This was so delicious that I can't believe it's not completely fat-laden! Yum! It took several hrs to prepare, but I think the result was well worth it. Next time, I'll make sure my knife is extra sharp to cut the cylinder into rolls.

I don't know why the other chef had trouble - this was only my second time making cinnamon rolls and my first time with this recipe and it was fabulous. My boyfriend and I just pulled them out of the oven and are munching them now. I added chopped pecans and put some cream cheese frosting (got the recipe on epicurious) on top - they're simply divine! This recipe is going into regular rotation!

Didn't taste like cinnamon rolls and took so much work. Was just a waste of time and ingredients.

I loved this recipe, and so did my family, they were the biggest and most delicious cinnamon rolls I have ever made!
