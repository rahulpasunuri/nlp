EatNRun: try putting in contact lenses the day after prepping a jalepeno. capsicum does NOT wash off with soap!

Very tasty, but as others have said, quite a lot of work. The recipe does make a lot of sauce, so you can get a number of meals for your efforts. We used it on grilled shrimp and really enjoyed the combination of flavors. We found the instruction to use gloves to handle the chipotles a little funny - you should be fine unless you stick the chiles in your eye.

Not bad. Not great either. In all honesty, I think it was more trouble to make than it was worth, since I made the pulp myself. Oh & BTW? It might have been nice to read some actual RECIPE REVIEWS, rather than little helpful hints from Martha Stewart wannabes.

I buy the jars of tamarind pulp at an Indian store and they work well.

Sauce was very tasty. Will try it with pork and chicken next. To the cook in San Francisco--thank you for the wonderful suggestion for keeping sauces ready at hand. Very clever!!!

I make large quantities of tamarind pulp and freeze it in ice cube trays (about 1 Tablespoon per cube). I do the same for roasted chiles, keep the cubes in ziploc bags in the freezer, then it is simple to make great barbecue/grilling sauces and marinades like the Tamarind Recado on the fly all summer long in whatever quantity you need, and you can easily adjust the spice level and other ingredients (instead of just having a bunch of the same sauce on hand) to suit whatever you're grilling at the moment. I also just used this (wit a few variations) on a pork loin that I roasted in the oven...delicious!
