This relish was my second experience with canning ever, and it's really wonderful. Neither too vinegar-y nor too onion-y, even though the red onions I used were quite strong. The end result was very sweet and yummy and the portions are so precise there were no leftovers to enjoy! I highly recommend it, even for beginners.

We loved this relish. We had an early frost the day after the magazine arrived and had to pull our tomato plants and I was on the hunt for what to do with all the green tomatoes. I made a huge amount of this on a whim and was very happy with it. Of all the preserves I gave as gifts last year, this got the biggest raves. We love it in deviled eggs as well as the suggested salads and even potato salad! Since we grow tomatoes, onions, peppers and garlic, it was great to find a recipe that used them all. This year I am making it again because I already have several requests from friends and family.

Unless you LOVE vinegar, this is really awful stuff. I tried more sugar and then more vegetables but it just tastes like vinegar.

This ended up being all about the onion, and very little about the green tomato. It is still not too bad to eat, though the sweet vinegary-ness came through a bit strongly.
