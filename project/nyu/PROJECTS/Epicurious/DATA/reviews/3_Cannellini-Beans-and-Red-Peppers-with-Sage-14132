This is a great basic recipe, but I added a few things I had on hand. I sauteed a very small bit of onion with the peppers, then substituted a fig-infused balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and drizzled a bit of walnut oil on it at the end. I think as-is it is a good recipe, but I loved the way the finished dish turned out!

As the other reviewer mentioned, I added onions while sauteing the vegetables along with more garlic as well as a light stock. I had some italian sausage left over so I added it also. Delicious. It was a great addition to the meal and it's even better the next day.

I have made this several times. It is simple and tastes very good. A variation I tried and liked was adding a small amount of chopped onion and garlic to the red pepper and celery mixture. I prefer the dish at room temperature rather than warm. This makes a great anti-pasta.
