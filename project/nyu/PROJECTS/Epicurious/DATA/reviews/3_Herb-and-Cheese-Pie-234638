I've made this now for a couple of dinner parties. It's a perfect first course to make ahead, serve a room temperature on the porch before going inside to eat (or whatever). Each time it got rave reviews. You can make the filling the night before (in 20 minutes) and refrigerate until the next day. Fabulous

sorry I had to respond to the person that didn't taste the fennel : Fennel is known easing and helping digestion. It was probably added so that one wouldnt have too much gas after eating a heavy dish, rather than for flavor.

The food was good but as a starter dish... I don't know. I halved the recipe and added a small amount of coriander and chives that I had to use up. I used it as the main dish and a quarter of the pie (one serving, since I halved the recipe) was so heavy we didn't want to add anything more. I guess I'm not used to eating so much cheese at once, even if I do live in france for now. Or we're not used to such heavy food.

This was good, easier to make than the individual triangles I usually make with phyllo dough. I can't say the fennel added much flavor, it was very mild, even though I added fennel seed. I only used 3 eggs and I'm glad it did, otherwise it would have overridden the cheese flavor. Would also add more feta cheese. This would also be good with spinach in the filling. It did make a very nice presentation for serving.
