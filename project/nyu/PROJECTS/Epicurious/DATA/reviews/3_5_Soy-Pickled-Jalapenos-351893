Overall, a good recipe: quick and tasty. I will definitely make it again. But, I agree with 2 of the previous reviewers: 1.) the soy sauce is pretty overpowering, next time I will add less and/or add some type of vinegar/lemon juice. 2.) There is a lot of sauce overall. Next time, I will add more jalapenos or divide the liquids by half.

Good, but I felt the soy sauce was a bit overpowering in these. Will try them again, but with less soy and adding some other liquid - maybe rice wine vinegar?

I've become addicted to these pickles -- typically tripling the recipe and making them at least once a week. Very easy and very satisfying -- but you have to like spicy peppers.

This is a very tasty, strong-flavored pickle. It's good over tofu or rice. There's a lot of brine so you can double the amount of peppers if you want. The flavor improves over time, make it a day ahead.
