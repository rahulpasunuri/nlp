To those of you who couldn't get the sauce to thicken... I wonder if you used the whole egg and not just the yolks? This recipe works a treat for me everytime, also I do agree with the comment that less tarragon to some may be a better idea, personally, I prefer the 2 tsps. Happy cooking

This recipe was thin and bland. I am very disappointed. I would strongly NOT recommend this one.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. The sauce was thin and not very flavorful. I actually had to use more vinegar than the recipe called for just to give it any flavor at all. And it curdled at the last minute, presumably because of excess heat. There are simpler hollandaise recipes out there that yield better results. Look for one of them instead.

Made this for 1 so cut ingredients by half and didn't even use that much butter. Just kept adding butter until I felt I had enough for 1 serving. Wasn't thickening so made sure heat was low and constant and after a few minutes cooking, which I kept lightly whisking, it thickened nicely. Used a glass bowl and pot of water on stove, no double boiler necessary. Accidently used 1 tbsp of vinegar vs 1 tsp but added more lemon juice and it was fine. First time to try this recipe and it was great, Would definatley make again. Don't be intimidated just try. No problem with egg curdling, added vinegar (regular white vinegar) and cream (reg. whipping cream) to lightly beaten cold egg yolk Used unsalted butter and added salt and cayenne pepper to taste. If this posts twice sorry but wanted to be as helpful as possible.

Tried to pare this down for 1 person, so cut all ingredients by 1/2. Wasn't thickening so made sure heat was constant and low, cooked for a few minutes and it thickened nicely. Used a glass bowl and pot of water on stove to cook, no double boiler necessary. Accidently used 1 tbsp of vinegar vs 1 tsp but added a little more lemon and it was fine. I like sour. No problem with eggs curdling, was my first time to try this type of recipe. Don't be intimidated, just try. Would love to hear qty and what type of ingredients used to try and make this a bit healthier. I used turkey bacon instead of ham.

I made this for my husband's birthday eggs benedict. I found it to be a mix of good and bad. The cream adds a nice touch. But the vinegar amount is far too much. It tasted like we were eating vinegar hollandaise. I made it a second time and cut the vinegar down to one teaspoon - perfect.

A perfect foolproof sauce. Consistency and taste are great! A little extra lemon makes it perfect! I have also used other types of vinegar, so if you don't have tarragon vinegar its okay!

Bulletproof. We've made this about a dozen times. The slow addition of the eight pieces of frozen butter seems to do the trick. Excellent in combination with the epicurious roasted asparagus/prosciutto/poached eggs recipe.

This recipe is very labor intensive, and turned out very thin for me. The flavor was not very good due to too much vinegar. And cooking hollandaise over heat is very tricky. A little too hot, and it curdles. I highly recommend the blender hollandaise recipe on this sight. It is quick and fairly foolproof. It has a great consistancy.

Perfect first attempt! I was worried when the vinegar & cream curdled in the bowl before whisking w/ eggs, but with constant whisking throughout process, it turned out great! Poached eggs in same water, by the time they were cooked the sauce had thickened enuff for service.

This was my 1st attempt at making hollandaise sauce. It definitely wasn't a disaster, but it also wasn't perfect. I didn't have cream so I used whole milk after seeing that someone else had used it successfully. I'm not sure if it was because of the milk or not, but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken enough. As someone else noted, it did thicken up a bit (still not quite enough) after it cooled down, but I only noticed this when I went to clean up the bit of leftover sauce about an hour after brunch. I'll make it again with cream & see what happens. All in all, though, the flavour was still really nice and it was still enjoyed by all.

Using this recipe I made Eggs Benedict for 5, but I ran out of hollandaise sauce. I will double this recipe in the future. I like a hollandaise with a prominent lemon flavor so I added just under 1 T of fresh lemon juice. I added this in tiny increments so as not to break the sauce. It was delicious with my change.

Great easy sauce in dbl broiler. I added a slice of extra sharp cheddar to give my eggs benedict a bite

this recipe is amazing. i used it on eggs benedict with smoked salmon and dill. fantastic. its a keeper.

I made half of this recipe and it was delicious. However, next time I will add even more lemon juice than the 10 drops that I added this time (maybe 5 more). I like that Epicurious includes recipes from way back in 1961.

Had never attempted this before and was concerned that I'd end up with scrambled eggs. It was surprisingly easy and turned out perfectly. I made a half recipe. Served it with the grilled rosemary lemon chicken on this site, roast potatoes and asparagus. My hubby and I enjoyed dipping the potatoes in the sauce as well. Yum!

Delicious, perfect sauce. I served this with crabcake eggs benedict.

This is a great sauce. I have made it twice now. It is perfect for eggs benedict, which I like to make with smoked salmon, poached eggs and whole wheat English muffins. Today I accidentally dumped what I thought was too much Cayenne pepper, but it turned out to have a nice kick that made the Benedict taste great.

I loved it! I've been hunting for an easy version of this sauce and saw many that had too many steps. Clarified butter? Not when I want something fast and simple. This version was just perfect. And it actually came out right first time around! I didn't have a lemon so just added a bit more of white wine vinegar. I noticed too that the sauce is a bit thin when it's removed from the fire, but once it cools down, it gets thicker. This is definitely going to be made again and again and again....

I had to make this twice. After I put the egg yolks, vinegar, and cream in the hot water I was expecting the mixture to thicken fairly quick, when it didn't I threw it out and started again thinking I did something wrong. After the second batch I realized what I was missing was patience!! I made this as a dip for steamed artichokes and it was very yummy! I will definitely make this again.

I cook professionally but had made Hollandaise Sauce only once before and it was a large volume. I find this recipe is great in small volumes because the cold butter is perfect for ensuring a smooth emulsification. I used the sauce in asparagus-mushroom omelettes and it was just great.

I made this sauce for asparagus Thanksgiving & got rave reviews. I'm already getting requests to make it for Christmas. Recipe was easier than I thought.

I made this for the very 1st time several months ago and it turned out perfectly ~ I was so proud of myself! I awoke very early (still dark out) this Easter Sunday morning and hid eggs outside with a flashlight before the kids awoke. With so many leftover eggs, I planned to surprise my husband (he is still asleep as well) with eggs benedict for breakfast. I don't know what I did wrong between the 1st time I made this and now? I have gone through more than a dozen eggs with no luck? I have read all kinds of recipes...some say use frozen butter, some say use room temp. butter and others say to use melted butter, and some even say to use clarified butter! I have failed on all accounts and I don't know why??? It came down to one more try and there wouldn't be enough eggs left to poach! Luckily I have a pkg. of Knorr brand hollandaise. I have no affiliation with that company, but from all the pkg.mixes I have tried, I found it to be the best. It is not as good as if made from scratch, but it does come in as a close 2nd. All I know is that I used this recipe the 1st time and it was easy and perfect. What I did wrong this time I don't know? The only reason I posted this is to say that it's good to have a backup plan just in case! Grrrrrr! Follow up...My husband awoke before I used that packaged hollandaise and the whole family went out to breakfast instead! I did make this recipe successfully today though! What I found through all my failed attempts yesterday is that the egg yokes can be whipped to the creamy stage BEFORE placing over the water. Also frozen butter seems to add more volume than warm or room temp butter. I also added a tiny bit more water towards the end because it seemed too thick without any problems. Hope this helps the new people like me...Good Luck!

I always thought hollandaise was difficult to make, but this recipe was so easy. I used regular milk instead of cream to lower the fat which I thought might ruin it; but it came out fine!

A great and easy sauce. Basic, simple and wonderful. If you can do this, you've nailed the sauce!

This recipe is very similar to one I've used for years and loved. Unfortunatly it's not the recipe featured on the program. What's the deal?
