Two rules: 1) use fresh orange juice 2) use decent wine. If you make this by removing the skin (much healthier), there will be no pan drippings as per the recipe, because there will be no fat. Consequently, if you add the wine / orange juice mixture to the skinless roasting hens, this mixture will merely burn and blacken. The solution is to brush the skinless hens with a little olive oil salt and pepper, and roast at the temperature and cooking time in the recipe. As mentioned, do not add any of the wine / orange juice mixture to the roasting pan. Instead, reduce it all separately, as directed. Place a bed of watercress on each plate and top with a hen (remove the onions, garlic and backbone) followed by several large spoonfuls of the reduced sauce over the hen. My family thinks this is take out from one of the best restaurants in town.

The sauce in the pan while roasting the hens was burned, blackened and ruined. Not sure how to remedy this next time. But the hens on a rack were untouched and I simply reduced the remaining sauce, which was outstanding. Before roasting, I did remove the skin and was surprised at how much nasty fat hides underneath -- no one in the family missed the skin. Maybe it was because I plated this by spooning some of the sweetened wine sauce on a plate, topped it with some cress, then half of a hen, cut up with shears as the recipe suggests. Home run.

I did not remove the skin. It was so pretty with the crusty glaze on it. My husband could hardly wait for the 45 minutes! I used a 2 inch deep roasting pan with a rack. They could perhaps have gone a few more minutes, but we had someone leaving for the airport, so I was on deadline! The thermometer said 170, so I took them out. I reduced the saucepan liquid while watching the asparagus and potatoes. Why fiddle with pouring off fat from a hot baking pan?

Left skin on - recipe said thicken sauce in about 12 minutes. Mine took about 1 hour; eliminating the need to thicken with flour. But, it was well worth it. Delicious sauce whether used on cornish or any other chicken. Simple, but company worthy and definitely a keeper. Brings the ordinary to the extraordinary.

This meal was delish! We used it on a 3 lb chicken instead of the cornish game hens and cooked it for a little over an hour.Served it over mashed turnips with steamed greens and felt like king and queen of the kitchen. It's going into our keepers file. Enjoy!

this would have been excellent with quail. i used free range cornish game hens that were admittedly quite gamey (to be expected), but the sauce more than masked this and, in fact, this dish quite reminds me of a favorite Vietnamese dish with roasted quail, sweet rice cake and a honey plum dipping sauce. served with herbed wild rice and a nice ner d'avola. note: my 3 year-old fancied this dish quite a lot.

I decided to leave the skin on and I can't imagine what it would have tasted like without it - definitely the best part. The sauce smells amazing, a lot like Gluwein at a Christkindlmarket. Make sure to roast the hens for their appropriate weight...mine should have cooked longer.

I was extremely disapointd with this recipe. I was hoping for crispy skin but it was not and the sauce was just so-so. Very bland

I have done this recipe twice, and both times it was excellent. If you have the means, I highly recommend using a rotisserie grill--the flavor really comes out. Definitely leave the skin on (screw it, you only live once!) and reduce the marinade with some flour or cornstarch, or else the marinade with just run off. This is a simple recipe that everyone can enjoy...

I made this for Christmas dinner. I stuffed the birds with lemon and garlic but removed those before serving. I cooked six birds at a time and added at least 30 minutes to cooking time. Also did thicken the sauce with some flour. The birds were good, attractively browned, and I got a lot of compliments on the sauce. Liked it but didn't love it. Good though.

I agree with the comments that the skin doesn't need to be removed, the hens look good whole instead of sliced, and that the recipe makes a large amount of sauce. I started reducing what was in the saucepan while the birds were roasting, and there was still a lot left after adding in the pan juices and reducing some more... This was our Thanksgiving main dish, and was an easy change of pace.

I found this recipe ordinary. I left the skin on and the hens were definitely very tender but the taste was no wow. I am going to try another recipe.

I made this for the first time last night and was amazed at how easy it was! I served it with braised fennel and mashed potatoes. While the hens were tented and the sauce reducing, I placed my plates in the oven to warm. Great dish for weeknight entertaining.

We're having dinner tomorrow night for 10 and this is the third time we've done this recipe and it always turns out better than before. I wouldn't remove the skin from the hens though as mentioned. This is an easy, very flavorable, and fabulous presentation on the plate. We are doing long grain wild rice with orange and cranberries along with green beans with shitakes as sides. I also think a Chard is too complacent with this...we are doing a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir instead.

I'd be more inclined to agree with the reviewers from Gratineau Quebec (12/29/00) and Racine (12/28/00) than with the 3 and 4 fork reviews. While this was good, and we did like it, there are other recipes we like much better. Two of them, which are on this site, are: Lemon-Sage Cornish Game Hens with Tomato-Porcini Sauce, and Mustard-and Rosemary-Roasted Games Hens, both of which we gave enthusiastic 3 fork reviews. The present recipe is nice, but in our opinion, nothing really special.

Great recipe, my children loved it...I served this dish with a wild rice mix and it was gastronomically delighful. This is my second go around...I forgot to rate it the first time I made it...L:-)

this sauce is absolutely wonderful, i actually added some flour to help thicken it. we served this with james beard's "barley casserole", an epicurious recipe (keyword: barley) from the january 1965 (yep, january 1965) House & Garden issue. great combo!!!

I had to review this. I've made these hens over a dozen times. This recipe is so delectible. The sauce is fresh and sweetly comforting with the tender meat. I've never infered from these directions that one is supposed to skin the hens and I never have. I usually stuff shallots into the cavities and they do get hot. Person from Quebec has some cooking issues. I like steamed green beans with this, and wild rice, but will be making roasted garlic mashed potatoes with them tonight. You must make this recipe.

It's a very elegant dish for an semi-formal garden lunch... I've done it twice and got great reviews, specially from those who hated my guts for cooking so nicely... ;-)

Served this last night and even the kids went crazy. The sauce is wonderful, I do reduce it a bit more. Did not skin the birds-so crispy and flavorful. I also put cut oranges in the bird w/ the onion and garlic and a sprig of fresh rosamary. Very easy for a work night meal.

Without the skin...doesnt brown. Had this for 9 people,too much work to skin and then cut in two. Onion and garlic don't even get hot.Makes too much sauce and takes forever to reduce. Not in my receipe books.

i really liked the sauce with this dish. i cannot wait to use it with pork tenderloin or baked chops. I didn't skin my hens and although they ended up with a crispy flavorful outer covering, i will follow the directions the next time.

Excellent and easy to prepare. I made it for Christmas dinner and will add it to my permanent collection. Fancy, yet simple. I actually served the hens whole, made for a lovely presentation. Also removed the onions, but left the garlic--tasted great.

I made this dish for our Christmas Eve dinner and got rave reviews from my husband who generally doesn't care for the sweet-sour flavor. I served it with the zucchini, chayote and yellow squash medley (available in the recipe file) and rice pilaf. This will definately be on our menu again soon!
