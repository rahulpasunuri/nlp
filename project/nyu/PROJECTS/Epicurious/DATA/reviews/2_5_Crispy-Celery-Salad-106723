So surprised that raw celery could taste this good. I used chopped fresh dill instead of mint and parsley... it was delish. Served with Mac and Cheese, great way to add crunch, lighten and balance a heavy main dish.

Sooo good! I served over thinly sliced beets as suggested. Tossed with fresh Italian parsley and fava beans. Don't be afraid of the mint.. its actually quite mild and a delicious compliment to the celery. I served with potatoes I quarted and fried in veg oil and with Fool Proof Chicken found on epicurious.com. Delicious!

I found this recipe too bland. Ho-hum.

Very pleasant and easy. I didn't have any parsley, so just made do with the mint, which I liked very much. I think adding a little lemon juice or capers would be interesting too. My husband raved about this one (go figure). What I especially liked was that it could be made in advance, and that it was nice with a very rich main course.

This salad has a lovely, fresh taste. The sliced red beets provide an interesting contrast in textures and flavors, and make a beautiful presentation to boot. I ate it all by itself for an ultra-lite dinner (I had a heavy lunch), but it would pair well with roast chicken and a creamy potato salad.

I gave this only two forks because I liked it, but my husband thought it was just so-so. Thought the crispy celery and frest mint were a perfect complement to the BBQ chicken I served it with and will make again, despite my husband's unenthusiastic response! Be careful adding salt and pepper to taste--it doesn't need a whole lot and unfortunately, I oversalted it a tiny bit
