Great choice for a health vegetarian meal. I topped it with sauted onions. I only marinated for about 40 minutes and it tasted flavorful. Don't skip on the rosemary!

the fresh rosemary and balsamic vinagrette worked wonderfully. marinated for about an hour and it worked perfectly. i chose to top with sharp provolone, avocado, tomato, and mayonnaise on the brushed and toasted bun. I will be making this anytime I wish to show someone the magic of the portobello burger.

Marinate Portobellos in Olive oil and Worcesershire sauce for 2 hrs grill & top with Provolone cheese serve on toasted sesame Kiser roll with two or three Radicchio leaves salt & cracked black pepper to taste

Very yummy! (The kids, however, thought this was yucky, and they normally like portobella "pizzas.") The arugula is brilliant. I used provolone instead of mozzarella, which was fine, and marinated the mushrooms in the garlic and vinagrette for about 1/2 an hour before grilling.

This was an excellent recipe. I used romaine lettuce for instead of arugula but it was still wonderful. It's healthy, very easy to make, and only takes a few minutes. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a family favorite! My children thought it would not be good, as they wanted hamburgers & ketchup, so I made both. My son tried a bite, and wanted this instead of the hamburger, and the girls followed. Very easy, and very tasty! Tastes much better than I we all thought it would, as none of us had a portobello before, and one kis "hates mushrooms"- not anymore!

delicious - i agree that blue cheese is the way to go, i also take out the stems and make sure mushrooms are cooked through, otherwise will taste nasty

This is a great recipe. Quick and easy. Fresh rosemary is the trick here (should have in your garden Grows like a weed). I have made this a few times and everyone I've served it to loves it.

These are fantastic and I make them all the time, marinating them in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and crushed garlic for about an hour or so and topping them with a little blue cheese instead of mozzarella. They're just so good that way!

My husband is a vegetarian and the rest of the family carnivores. when cooking burgers for the family I cook this for my husband and it is delicious. He loves it and so do the carnivores.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer. (Maybe it's just us Atlantans.)Slimy texture and very little flavor. I'd never make it again.

This recipe absolutely had to be the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.

I marinated the mushroom in the balsamic vinegar for about an hour prior to grilling (although 1/2 hour would do). I can't eat yeast so I ate mine hot off the grill like a steak. It was very tasty and juicy although it lacked something so next time, I'll add the "toppings" as well and simply omit the bun.

I made this for brunch for a few friends and my parents and it was well recieved! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I added a homemade roasted garlic red pepper mayonnaise after I grilled the buns and it was really good! Excellent!!

This was fantastic - and much better than store bought veggie burgers! I used provolone instead of mozzarella and romaine instead of arugula. This is a terrific summer meal!

Excellent. I skipped the rosemary and added slices of jarred sweet red peppers to the sandwiches which worked well with the mozzarella.

Yum! I substituted thyme for the rosemary and replaced the mozzarella with feta cheese, both because i didnt have either ingrendient on hand but it was delicious nonetheless. easy and delicious- served it with grilled red peppers and kalamata olives.
