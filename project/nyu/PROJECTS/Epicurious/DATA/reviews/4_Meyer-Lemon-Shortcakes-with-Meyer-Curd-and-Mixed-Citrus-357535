So easy, and really really good.

Delicious! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this modern citrus shortcake. The lemon curd recipe is outstanding, biscuits are almost more scone-like in texture - just sweet enough and lemony, marmalade - the most labor and time intensive - and well worth it. Next time for the marmalade I will cook the fruit a little longer and be sure to slice all the fruit a little thinner - the rinds were still a little too chewy. Overall a very impressive dessert.
