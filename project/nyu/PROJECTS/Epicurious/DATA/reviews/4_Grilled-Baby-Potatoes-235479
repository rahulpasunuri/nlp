Easy and a good addition to a grilled meal. Used "confetti mix" baby potatoes from Trader Joe's for color.

Totally delicious: I made this with fingerling potatoes, tossed them with a little olive oil, sea-salt and fresh rosemary before putting them on regular skewers. Perfect with the pork churrasco recipe & grilled asparagus.

Delicious way to grill potatoes! I didn't have baby potatoes, but used a mixture of potatoes: small purple, Yukon gold, and regular large russet, which made a colorful presentation. Used regular wooden skewers and sprinkled them with herbs from Provence. The leftovers were great the next day with breakfast!

It doesn't get any simpler, but sometimes simple is just the best way to go! I have already made these twice - both times with grilled rib-eye steaks with parsley-garlic butter, another recipe from epicurious. These potatoes are delicious as is, but really good with a little of the extra parsley-garlic butter!
