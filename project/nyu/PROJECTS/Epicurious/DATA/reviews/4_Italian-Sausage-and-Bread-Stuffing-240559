Made this for Thanksgiving instaed of my usual stuffing. Almost everyone commented on how yummy it was. I did cut sausage amount in half,which I would do again, as I wanted more bread than sausage. I would highly recommend this recipe.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I don't think I'll make a different stuffing recipe for the holidays ever again. I used half the celery suggested and included sliced mushrooms and it turned out extremely well.

This is such a winner, year after year. I cannot understand the reviewer that said it was bland. I never stuff a Turkey, so always cook this as Dressing. I have found the secret is the quality of ingredients. Living in the NE, we have great Italian Pork Stores and Bakeries, so access to the best bread and sausage is easier. I typically add a bit more garlic. I also drizzle a bit more cream on the top, as none of my mixture is stuffed in the Turkey, it can handle the addition.

This was a hit last year, so I'm making it again. I used tj's rosemary parmesan bread, hot italian sausage, and added a pinch of each, sugar and cayenne, to the vegetables while sweating. Yum!

This stuffing was amazing... My only change was adding 2 tsp chopped thyme and a head of chopped and sauteed fennel. Making this one again again.

I have never had such an incredible stuffing! Everyone raved and is still talking about it months later. The only changes I made were to use only 1 lb. unflavored pork sausage instead of 2 lb of italian sausage and I also substituted chopped mushrooms for the celery. It was a little labor intensive, but worth every second! I have been looking for excuses to make this!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and received rave reviews. What leftovers there we had were eaten immediately. Didn't put the cream on top as I thought it would be too heavy. Also, I used sourdough bread instead of italian. I will use this again and again.

Like everyone else said, this was so amazing! It was the best dish at Thanksgiving, and it's a meal in itself which we ate for the next few days. I used a sourdough loaf and about half of the sausage though. Can't wait to make it again!!! Yum!

Made this for Thanksgiving & it was fabulous. Everyone loved it and I had requests for the recipe (always a good sign). I was told it could be a meal by itself its that good! I made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. As my husband said, this is definitely a keeper and will be made again next year.

Hands down the BEST stuffing recipe I have had anywhere. So rich and savory is was a delicious addition to my Thanksgiving table last year. Just when I thought that I would never love anyone's sausage stuffing more than my own mother's, this knocked it out of the park. This will be a staple on my table for year's to come. OUTSTANDING.

I get asked for this recipe every time I make it and it has become a turkey day staple. The only thing I do different is to triple the amount of garlic (I'm Italian we like garlic) and use sourdough bread. Simply amazing that way. Cream on top or not, I've tried it both ways and it just makes it heavier, with the veggies it's a meal in itself. I usually double the recipe and make it ahead, pop it in the oven on turkey day. It does great!

I was just going through my recipes to input into MacGourmet and when I came across this was reminded how much I LOVED it. Made it for the first time for thanksgiving last year and it was a big hit. Rich, extremely flavorful, and amazing texture. The top came out nicely browned and crunchy and it was perfectly moist underneath. Pretty sure this is a new Thanksgiving staple.

I made this twice in a row since I liked it so much! Thanksgiving and Xmas. Using other reviewers' inputs and my own research on sausage stuffings, here are my tips: - Quantity: I halved it and it is perfect for six, with leftovers for two-three portions. So plan accordingly. - Bread: I thought it was a little too much bread for my taste, so you can adjust if you like it less bready. - Seasonings: I added sage and thyme, finely chopped, one minute before cooking was finished for the celery/onion mixture. Since I had used similar herbs for my brined-herb encrusted Turkey, it was a great compliment of flavors. - Fat: Based on other recipes, I decided to not use butter and cream. So I used olive oil to brown stuff, and broth to moisten the stuffing. - Apples: Some other recipes call for apple. So I chopped one up, and cooked for about a 3 minutes. If you halve the recipe, use two apples. It gives a nice punch. So Voila! I know it seems like a lot of changes, but the sign of a good recipe is one that is good to adapt and a good method for cooking. Oh and I just ate my leftover lunch, which inspire me to share this review seeing that I so much enjoy reading other cooks' views on things. Happy new year! PS I served this with Garlic-Chive mashed potatoes, Cosmopolitan Cranberry Sauce (both on this site), Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta (or bacon) and Balsamic and herb encrusted Turkey. A menu to repeat!!

what is the mention of potatoes at the end? there is no mention of them until the end??? anyway, great stuffing but definitely weird with cranberry sauce, so maybe not the best thing for thanksgiving!

Rating: 4
This was one of (if not the) best stuffing recipes I have ever tasted. Everyone raved about it. I made it for two different Thanksgiving dinners and the only thing that I changed was I used half sweet Italian sausage and half mild Italian sausage (both chicken). As other people suggested, I also added some red pepper flakes. If you are serving this with a full Thanksgiving meal, it will feed double what the recipe says.

Made this to rave reviews!! My grown son asked for the recipe and he never asks for any recipes!! Did not drizzle the extra heavy cream on top. Also did not stuff bird, but just put it in a heavy duty baking dish. This one is a keeper!!

This is a super delicious recipe. It is slightly rich, very flavorful and fun because of the bite size pieces. My alterations to the recipe were I used half spicy pork sausage and half sweet pork sausage, I used Romano-Parmigiano (Reggiano was not available), and cooked all of it in the baking dish. I was concerned there would be too many onions as I was finishing cutting my third, but the amount was perfect. I let the finished dressing sit in the bowl for about an hour to let the bread completely soak up all the good stuff. I cannot wait to make this again, and I wont be waiting for Thanksgiving. It does take a good 1.5 hours to get everything done, but totally worth it!

This was very good, easy to make. It would make a good brunch dish on its own. I suggest you don't add salt to the veggies as the recipe suggests because the sausage and the parmesan is already pretty salty. Taste it when it's assembled before you bake it and add salt then if you think it needs it.

I may never stuff a turkey again! My family really enjoyed. I added mushrroms and next time might cut the sausage in half. I stuffed the turkey with herbs from a recipe I found on this site so it made the gravy really nice.

Made this for Thanksgiving, it was awesome. The only change that I made was no parmesean, I used fresh thyme and rosemary in addition to Italian parsley and half of the sausage. I would make it with the cheese another time. Stuffing is my favorite part of Thanksgiving.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. The only modification I made was to use a good rustic but non-Italian bread and about half the sausage based on the reviews that it was too meaty. It was great and definitely had enough sausage.

I made this last year and it was HUGE hit! But, I used a sourdough round for the bread and added quite a bit more celery and garlic. I think the sourdough bread is what made this recipe so I won't even go back to the original this year. I'll be making it again because everyone has requested it from me again. :)

I'm used stove top instead of the bread, followed stove top directions, chopped 2 onions, two celery stalks, 3 cloves of garlic 1/4 cup of heavy cream, 6 small sausages and it was delicious

Delicious and rich! Used Citarella Italian round loaf and their sweet Italian sausage. Found there was too much sausage that overwhelmed the delicious stuffing. My husband called it sausage with a little bread. Next time I'll halve the sausage. SO GOOD!!!

This recipe is wonderful: good flavor, rich, great comfort food. On the other hand, like other reviewers have noted, it doesn't blend perfectly with the traditional Thanksgiving flavors. If you are planning a menu with Mediterranean flavors, this would be absolutely perfect. If not, it would still be good. You could possibly plan on serving a dish or dessert with tangy lemon flavors to cut the richness.

Fantastic. Even had one comment from a guest about it being the best stuffing she had ever tasted. Followed the recipe as written. Will definitely make again.

Yum! Didn't have the cream on hand (increased the stock to 1 1/4 cups to compensate) and only had 3 eggs. Turned out wonderfully! I baked the entire mixture in a large oven proof dish and did not stuff the turkey.(I have been doing this with for years, makes a lovely crunch top and saves time bringing it all to the table) Everyone raved about this stuffing.

I love this recipe and use it several times a year. I add a tablespoon of crushed red pepper to the onion mix during the last few minutes to give it some extra heat. For the sausage I use 1 pound hot Italian sausage and 1 pound sage sausage and I double up on the parsley. I've also added a pound of sauteed mushrooms in the past and it was a hit too. Leftovers make a great brunch, just heat some in a skillet, make a hole in the middle and fry an egg or two in the hole..yum!

This was delicious. I made it just as is, and would actually consider making this just as a stand alone comfort food dish. I thought it worked perfect with suffed turkey, but could easily be a side (or main) dish.

I tried this stuffing for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. I omitted the Parmigan, but might try adding it if I make this again for another occasion. I also added a little extra cream and stock to make it more moist and it turned out just the way I wanted it. Really yummy and satisfying, and the leftovers were great too.

This was very good. Italian sausage is hard to find in Germany, so we ended up using fresh bratwurst. It still turned out great. Like others have said, I found the flavors a bit odd with other traditional Thanksgiving dishes. But the stuffing itself is very good.

I made as many ingredients ahead of time and last minute, arranged it all and put in a deep casserole pan (mistake). I should have cooked the stuffing in a shallower pan to get it more crispy. It turned out ok, but a little too moist. I've made it better in the past.

I made this last night and most people loved the dressing. It was truly delicious but all agreed it didn't go so well with turkey and cranberry sauce - probably because of the parmesan cheese. If you want to make a delicious dressing and something unusual, give this a try,but if you want something a little more traditional, omit the parmesan and put in some herbs. If I made it again I would serve it with a pork roast.

Holy Cow! This was one hell of an amazing recipe. I doubled it, and ended up having it for dinner (by itself in a bowl!) every night for a week. Didn't want anything else! The steps make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Make sure you use good grated cheese. It's worth the extra cost. I had guests talking about the dish for weeks afterward. A definite keeper!

We always have sausage stuffing and have been trying new ones for the last few years after misplacing our orignal recipe. This was hands down the best. We did add little bit of rosemary and thyme along with the parsley for good measure. We are thinking of adding a few red pepper flakes with the onion next year.
