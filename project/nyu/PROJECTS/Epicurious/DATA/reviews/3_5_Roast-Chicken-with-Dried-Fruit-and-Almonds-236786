I made this dish for Passover dinner and everyone loved it. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked them covered with aluminum foil so they would not dry out. It was a very easy and elegant dinner.

Used cut up chicken and less than half the fruit, but added sliced apples, then poured some wine over them, for the last half hour or so for a Rosh Hoshana dinner. Skipped the almonds. Used chicken stock instead of water. This was a great hit.

I make a very similar recipe (only exclude the almonds, but sure I could incorporate) and I can tell you that there is no need at all to add extra sugar. Dried fruit is concentrated to begin with! Another difference is that I use a cut up chicken rather than whole, I think the fruit really incorporates better that way.

To the person who didn't like the recipe because the chicken wasn't cooked in 5 1/2 hours: this is not a problem of the recipe, but your oven, try checking the temperature.

Too much fruit, but the chicken turned out moist & delicious w/ the tumeric. For holiday, I may go back to the simple lemon and honey glazed chicken recipe.

I really enjoyed making this dish. I used one chicken but used the same amount of onions/fruit as recipe called for. It's nice to have leftovers. It is fruity, but I liked it that way. I didn't need to add any more liquid in the cooking process. The only thing I would say is the chicken was not fully cooked after 1hr.45, probably needed another 15 minutes or so, but I couldn't tell just by piercing the skin. I would probably cook a bit longer next time.

I have made this recipe 3-4 times, rave reviews every time. I prepare the onion/fruit mixture the nite before which makes it easier on the day of cooking. Haven't changed a thing and have never had a problem with the chickens being cooked....Fantastic

The last two times I made this recipe the chickens took FOREVER to cook. The last time the chickens weren't done 5 hours after I initiated the prepration. NOT WORTH IT.

This recipe was just OK. There was much too much fruit. Dried fruit is costly and I just felt the recipe was not worth the expense.

This is a delicious roast chicken recipe. Put parchment under fruit before cooking otherwise it sticks to pan and a lot is lost. Forgot the almonds but it didn't matter at all. I also used cardamom instead of cinnamon and the flavour worked well.

I made this because I like dried fruit and others gave it rave reviews. It was quite a bit of work, cutting all the fruit in half, slicing up all the onions, and cooking the onions for so long, and it was NOT worth it. The fruit/onion stuff did not flavor the chicken, the ratio of fruit to onion was way too fruity. The recipe is, in my opinion, and that of my family, a dud. I have NEVER disliked an Epicurious recipe this much that was SO highly rated by others. Oh, well.

Like other reviewers, I only made half of this recipe. I cut everything in half and it worked out fine. I did cook the chicken breast side down for the first 45 minutes and then flipped it breast up for the remainder. I will make this again, but next time, I will leave out the sugar, the dried fruit provides enough sweetness. Also, I think with a few adjustments this could be made with whole, skin on, bone-in breast instead of a whole chicken.

This was really yummy and very easy!! However I forgot to add the almonds so I bet it would have been even better! Other than that I followed the recipe. I halved everything because I made it with only one Chicken. Very GOOD!

Made it as written and the taste was great. The amount of fruit/onions is high and could be reduced by one third. It may have been my chickens but I had a lot of juice in the fruit so watch the amount of liquid as noted. Well received by all ages.

I tried to halve this recipe but the amount of fruit was still overwhelming. I also had trouble getting the chicken fully cooked (my fault). The good news is that my 15 month-old toddler gobbled it up (funny to see her slurp carmelized onions like spaghetti).

I made this for Chanukah and it came out fantastic. Really easy, delicious and goes well with any starch. I followed the receipe, but added some chicken stock as well as water to soften the dried fruits as they cooked

Just made this last night for the first night of Hanukkah. What an excellent choice! Two 3 pound birds would have been plenty for 8 people. Very easy and next time I will be making with chiken pieces for a weekday meal. The fruit reminded me of Tsmiss (sp?). Also loved the white bean salad with lemon and cumin - good side for this excellent meal!
