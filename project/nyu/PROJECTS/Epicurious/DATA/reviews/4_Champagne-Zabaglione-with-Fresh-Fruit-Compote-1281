This is fantastic. Not hard to make, and delicious - well, if you love not too sweet desserts. The night I made it, it was light and fluffy and wonderful. But I saved some for the next day and found that it went flat - I got it to 160 degrees as instructed but wonder if my thermometer is off or I read it wrong. It says it'll keep overnight, but mine clearly didn't. I'll make it again, but not to hold. It's still totally, absolutely worth it.

This is an exquisite dessert and brings to mind a signature dessert of L'Auberge de l'Ill in Illhausern, Alsace. The brothers Haeberlin gained and maintained their 4 stars with the following presentation, among other things. Poach a very slightly under-ripe peach in simple syrup. Remove and cool, from the stem end, carefully remove the pit keeping the peach in tact as much as possible. Place the peach in desert compote with a scoop or real pistachio ice cream, not that horrendous green stuff. Make your own if you cant purchase the genuine article. Serve with this champagne sabayon (zabaglione) and anticipate nirvana.

I merely made the champagne zabaglione as described, and then dropped red seedless grapes in it. The guests loved fishing around for them in the delicious zabaglione. I poured the mixture into serving bowls after preparing it, and then froze it in the bowls for about 3 hours before serving. When I brought it out, I threw a couple of the grapes on top.

This dessert is amazing and perfect for company - it looks much more difficult to make than it really is. I served it at a dinner party in deep martini glasses and it was a hit. I cheated a little to reduce the fat content by using an egg substitute for the yolks - It was delicious!

This is simply a perfect, light, elegant dessert, with just a hint of sweetness. My guests SWOONED. I served it over blackberries and mango in martini glasses. There is no doubt I will make again, and again. I think this is the best dessert on this site! (Funny isn't it, how many people from B'Hills reviewed this recipe?)

This was wonderful! I wanted a lighter dessert for a heavy meal and this hit the spot. My guests who usually don't care for zabaglione raved about this recipe.

Fabulous, wonderful, fantastic - not enough words to do this dessert justice! Served it over a berry mixture in a martini glass - very elegant presentation and guests all love it! Not that difficult to make either. I used a whisk attachment on an electric mixer over the heat and it worked great.

OH. MY. GOODNESS. This is so divine I almost burst into tears. The taste and texture are heaven. (Hyperbole? No.) Served it over blackberries and strawberries. I do not tend to like overly sweet desserts, and this isnt, it is absolutely PERFECT. I made it for a demonstration cooking class that I teach and the participants thought there might be too much whisking involved...for me it was nothing, but for them I suggested using the hand held mixer the whole time. Honestly this is just SO good. Dessert perfection.

I have never received such raves for a desert in my life. Even from a non-desert lover. I made this for a New Year's Eve party to follow lobster newberg and asparagus. I made the Zabaglione the night before and it held beautifully. The champagne made it light, and fit with the lobster and the occassion. The fresh fruit was beautiful, and it was a very easy desert to assemble with guests there. As close to 4 forks as I have ever come!

I first made this delicious dessert for company when it first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1996. It has become a favorite and makes a lovely presentation when served in cut crystal champagne glasses (traditional style).

A WONDERFUL dessert - nice & light after a big meal. All kinds of fruit will work - fresh pineapple is especially good. Have had rave reviews each time I've made it. Make sure you have the patience to take the zabaglione to 160' C - or it won't thicken properly. A glass of champagne in hand helps !

Made it twice and will make again for Y2K celebration. Not as difficult as it sounds. If you have a copy of the Feb '96 Bon Appetit there are pictures to guide you through. One of my favorites. Nearly a 4!
