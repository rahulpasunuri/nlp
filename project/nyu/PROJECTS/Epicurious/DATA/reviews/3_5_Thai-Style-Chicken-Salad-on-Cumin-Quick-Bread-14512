This is my go-to chicken salad. Sometimes I add toasted almond slivers and chopped dried cherries. Often I add a dash of chipotle powder for heat. Good in pita, on crackers, or by itself.

I'm only giving this two forks because it was VERY good but I didn't make the bread with it - we ate it in wraps which were DELICIOUS! Loved the whole idea of the meal but didn't have all the ingredients on hand and had to use dried mint and cilantro instead of fresh - so I can only imagine this would be so much better with everything as is! Very delicious though - would be great for a pot luck or baby/bridal shower!

Wonderful summer lunch with a glass of sauvignon blanc. Adding a crunch factor really helped the chicken salad shine (I added red bell pepper, but celery could work too). I also added green curry paste to my mayo before folding it in. Brought more of a Thai flavor out...very nice.

This is a really tasty, refreshing version of chicken salad. I made it twice, once with fresh mint, once with dried, and found both equally good. Chopped jalepeno is also quite nice, I skipped the cumin bread and opted for mini croissants which was cery good.

The chicken salad was absolutely fabulous. I threw a party and everyone raved over it. I didn't use the cumin bread per everyone else's recommendations, just a dry white bread. I've already made it twice since Saturday by request.

This salad has good flavor, but would suggest serving as a salad (shredded cabbage) or on plain wheat bread. The quick cumin bread was not good- was dense and too heavy for this salad.

This recipe is outragously delicious. It is so popular in our family that I make it twice a month, sometimes more. My Peruvian husband says that the flavor reminds him of Peruvian cebiche. I also tried this recipe with canned salmon - not good. Stick with the chicken. And lastly, I double the recipe to feed my family of four. I have no idea how these people are making 34 sandwiches!!!

This was one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had! The only changes I made were: adding some cayenne pepper to the chicken and using whole wheat bread. Will definitely be making this again and again!

I got raves for this salad! I did not make the bread, and used a chipotle chili powder (a little more than called for) with some julienned red pepper for a little color. Will be making this again and again.

I liked this a lot. I added a touch (maybe a 1/4 teaspoon?) of green curry paste, which I happened to have for another recipe. It kicked up the heat a bit

I have made this recipe many times now with great success (I can't tell how many times I've given out the recipe!). You don't need to serve the salad with the cumin bread if you're short on time. I've used toasted sourdough bread, rye bread, and wheat, all to rave reviews.

I can't believe I am just rating this recipe! Fantastic. I am not a fan of mayonaisey sandwiches and this chicken salad is superb. The lime, cilantro and mint elevate this to a different level of sandwich. Although I have not made the Cumin bread, I have made the sandwiches for several tea parties for a little something different. And I substituted shrimp for the chicken for a vegetarian friend of mine's baby shower which was equally wonderfully. I have found it's best to make it at least 30 minutes before you plan to serve it.

I served this in endive cups for a bridal shower. I was afraid that the Thai flavors might have been too funky for my very Southern guests. But they enjoyed the change-up and many wanted the recipe.

This chicken salad is terrific - so flavorful! The cumin bread is very good, too. I really like them together and separately. Definitely adding this to my list of favorites!

I love this recipe, but one thing i always do is spread the mayo over the Cumin Bread. I usually add a extra 1/4 teaspoon ceyenne powder. This dish always leaves me feeling full and happy. I have always made this dish for my birthday!! I hope you have a good experience from it too!! Love ya, Justine :)

after following the chicken salad recipe to the letter (omitting the cumin bread as so many had suggested), i was completely underwhelmed and disappointed. very so-so. nothing to write home about.

The chicken salad, by itself, was very flavorful and fresh-tasting served over baby greens. I added celery, which was a nice crunch, and used ground coriander instead of fresh. Really, really good.

Made this salad last night for my husband and me. I tasted the salad while I was making it and loved it. The bread looked wonderful when it came out of the oven. However, I think the cumin in the bread overpowered the fabulous flavor of the salad. I'm eating it now on honey whole wheat bread and it's way better. I'll make the salad again. I might make the bread again. I won't serve them together again, though.

I absolutely do not eat chicken salad but made it for a bridal shower for about 15 ladies. Everyone said it was the best they'd had. (All the boys loved it too when they raided the house later that night) I followed the directions yet put them on baby croissants. I would definitely bring this to more parties considering the response.

SO good. Added the jalopeno and the rice wine vinegar per the previous reader and a couple of crushed garlic cloves and about a T of spicy Thai chili/garlic paste...can't remember what it is called. We have already made it twice this week.

The flavours blended marvelously and the recipe was simple, not too time consuming. Teens loved it. It's now on my Sunday light dinner list

I used ground chicken, cooked in chick. broth w/ the scallions & shallots, plus one jalapeno pepper, and 1t lemon grass. Added 1t sugar & 1T rice wine vinegar to the dressing. Tossed 3/4 of the dressing with the chicken. Then, mixed 2T mayo into the remaining dressing, tossed it w/ the herbs and 3/4 head iceberg lettuce. Mixed that w/ the chicken mixture and served it as a salad. GREAT!

Late night and early morn at work, this was great!!!I took the previous advice and used a rotisserie chicken and served it in pita bread, great flavor and taste.

This chicken salad is fantastic! Used leftover rotisserie chicken and served it with homemade pita crisps - - perfect light dinner.

A great receipe for leftover chicken. We needed a chicken salad for a concert picnic. My husband claims he doesn't like mayo, but I put it in anyway and he didn't even know. I saved it to my box. Would definetely use again.

I don't like chicken salad sandwiches, but these were a hit with me and my picnic party! Great with the mint and lime.

This salad was so good I had to make the cumin bread the next day just to see. Somehow I missed that this is a finger sandwich - till I read 2 T of filling but it was great as a regular sandwich on an onion hamburger bun with cilantro for lettuce. Great straight out of the bowl with crackers too! I agree that the cumin bread doesn't really add anything.

I don't even like chicken salad, but I LOVED this! I served it on crostini as part of a buffet spread for a party, and got lots of requests for the recipe. Followed the recipie exactly, and thought it was fabulous! The lime juice makes the recipie - use fresh!

I didn't bother w/ the cumin bread, I just used some oat bread instead. I also upped the ante w/ the chili powder and layered cucumbers on top in the sandwiches. Next time I'll play around with the herb/spice/lime amounts to suit my taste.

I served this recipe as an appetizer at my wedding in 1991 and everyone loved it. It is also delicious made with either shrimp or crab and may also be served on little pita toasts with a little cumin sprinkled on top.

Next time I would use a little less lime and a little more chili powder, but overall it was delicious!

This was so good! I did not make the cumin quick bread and just used regular white bread and it was delicious. If I were serving this to the masses, I would make the bread, but last night, I just made this dish for my family at home. I added some celery for crunch (and because I have leftover celery to use up). The cilantro, mint, and lime really make this dish!

The chicken was great! However, the cumin quick bread had far too much cumin. At the last minute, I switched to another bread, fearful that the strong flavors from the salad would fight with the strong cumin taste.

I made this sandwich for the adults at my sons end of school year party. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe.

I am making these sandwiches once again to serve at a brunch. They are easy to make and something different without offending some pickey eaters.
