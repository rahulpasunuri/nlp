This is the most versatile and easy muffin recipe I have found!! The muffins are moist, light and delicious with many variations of ingredients..blueberries, raspberries..etc..everyone loves them!

Two years ago I wrote a review... well, I have been making these muffins almost every week since then and have tried a wide variety of combinations. Whatever fruit is in season has been used! Whatever nuts I have on hand have also been used. The muffins are always good. Its definitely a keeper!!

Outstanding recipe. Used 1/2 cup sugar as others had suggested. Increased vanilla to 2tsp as we love that flavor. Still very subtle. Used fat free sour cream and it worked fine. Added in 1 medium diced apple and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Brushed the tops with 1 egg white beaten with 1 tsp water. Lightly sprinkled sugar on top to glaze. More like a cake muffin and very moist. Next time I make this with apples and walnuts I'll add in some cinnamon and nutmeg.

I call these 'inventory reduction' muffins, great to use whatever you have on hand for. I substitute greek yogurt for the sour cream with great results. They are so easy that I have been making them every week, my fiance loves them!

A good recipe but the vanilla is not listed in the ingrediants

I made the basic muffin recipe without any mix-ins. As basic muffins, they're too sweet. I imagine that the mix-ins make that appropriate. If you're looking for a "plain" muffin, cut the sugar by half. Otherwise, easy to make, good texture, a good muffin recipe.

While Alton Brown would call these 'cupcakes' because of their even crumb, I just say,"NOM, NOM, NOM!" If you creamed the butter instead of melting it, then I bet they'd get those nice air bubbles and tunnels that AB says is a true muffin. What makes these rate particularly high in my book is that the batter is thick enough to mound in the muffin tin. I get six out of this recipe. I also sprinkle the tops with some turbinado sugar before sliding them in to bake. Today I mixed in chopped almond paste, poppy seeds and almond extract. They were great with a cup of hot black coffee. Only now I realize that by having two muffins I was actually comsuming 4! Eeek! I really gotta get some exercise!

I bake these at least every two weeks. I use whatever seasonal fruit I have on hand and ... always walnuts, because I love them! Also, I substitute 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt to the full cup of sour cream and of course I omit the vanilla. Everyone loves them!

Rating: 4
Whoa-A this are totally awesome. I increased the sugar to half cup. I added cinnamon, ginger, and apple pie filling. Before I added the filling it looked too thick to be muffin batter, like pizza crust or something. I mixed it only as much as needed so it was kinda lumpy. They are so moist and wonderful. I made them this evening, enjoying one rite now with some tea. can't wait to bring em to work tomorrow otherwise I may try to eat too many. lol. I have a question though? Has anybody used this for savoury muffins? How much sugar do you use? or do you eliminate it all together?

Rating: 4
Wow! These are awesome muffins. Definitely a keeper. :-) I, as many people do, made a few changes to work with my personal preference and what I had on hand. 1) I use 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I don't know if it really mattered or not, but I already had the 1/2 cup out and figured I'd would just use it again. 2) I use Nucoa instead of butter since it was what I had in my fridge. 3) I did use light sour cream, but that probably doesn't matter. Next time I want to try a buttermilk as a substitute. I read somewhere that 7/8 cup of buttermilk + 1/8 cup of butter can be a substitute for 1 cup of sour cream. I love buttermilk in recipes, so when I understand this recipe better, I will try it. 4) For the add-ins I would recommend something with some moisture. The muffins I made are currently just right and I used moist fruits. I used about a heaping 1/2 cup of blackberries (frozen, thawed, and juices drained) and 1/2 cup canned crushed pineapple (drained). I also added about three handfuls of coconut, I didn't want to measure. It was probably 3/4 cup. Wonderful recipe! I hope to use it again and again!

i made these again with the proper unsalted butter. wonderfully moist, perfect sweetness (often i end up cutting the sugar but i didn't need to here). i used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, but other than that i was faithful to the recipe. additions were 1tsp cinnamon, one diced apple, and about 1/3 cup of raisins. delicious!

Rating: 0
i'm not going to give this recipe a fork rating because i screwed it up by accidentally using salted butter (damn that misleading silver package!). the muffins were good, but due to my own error, noticeably saltier than they should be. i will try them again. my add-ins were chopped canned peaches and blueberries - very delicious! texture was wonderfully moist, too.

I read several of the comments/suggestions before making these muffins. I used chopped apples and walnut and used half sour cream and half vanilla yogurt ... my husband loved them. Will try other combinations in the future.

I made two batches for coworkers and they were a big hit. I did fresh raspberry, coconut and canned apricots using some of the syrup from the can and they were fantastic. For the other batch I did chunky milk chocolate and pecans which also turned out good, but I definitely liked the extra moistness of hte fruit one and will try to lean towards that in the future. Definitely a keeper.

this muffin recipe is Great!!! I made it according to the recipe and it is delicious. The second time I used a raspberry and blueberry yogurt instead of the sour cream and 1/2 cup of sugar. I had no vanilla on hand so I omitted that. added a 4 berry frozen fruit mix (strawberry, blueberry, blackberry and raspberry) I also made a walnut strusel topping - EXCELLENT. Brought them to my mom's deli and everyone raved about them. super moist!!! Have fresh peach muffins in the oven now. Can't wait to try some interesting mixes. This is a keeper!!!

I just made a batch using the creaming method, added 1 cup mashed ripe banana and 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut. They came out so light and fluffy that I decided they needed frosting - cream cheese of course! My daughter and her friend are currently devouring them and moaning with delight.This is my second time using this recipe. First time they were very heavy - I used dry add-ins. I agree with the posting that suggested wet add ins make for a much lighter and moist muffin.

Well, I'm one of the (very) few dissenters here. I thought these tasted fine, but weren't exceptional in any way. I tried the variation with cranberries. They tasted like anything I'd get at any coffee shop. I guess I am looking for something a little more special. I've got plenty of other breakfast cake recipes that I prefer.

Exceptional! Not for the figure concious - but absolutely exceptional. I made them with dried bing cherries, almond flavoring and sliced, toasted almonds. Baked it in a mini bundt pan for 27 minutes.

(Baker in Germany)Wow, this is one fool-proof muffin recipe! Increased to 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp. baking powder as suggested and mixed in dried cranberries and white choc.chips. Can't wait to try another version for my café (my family and I gobbled up the first ones in a few minutes!). Yielded 10 nicely sized regular muffins. It's a keeper!

I understand that by changing the recipe I should not rate it but here goes. I run a cafe and had several strawberry yogurts that needed to be used so I substituted them for the sour cream and added chopped frozen strawberries and got rave reviews. A must have recipe with so much potential!

Rating: 3
This is a very good base. They came out tender and not as heavy as I anticipated when noting the consistency of the batter. I used some clementine zest and dried cranberries soaked in Capt. Morgan. I'm about to make another batch using leftover blueberry crisp and a little lemon zest. Next week, strawberry-peach... These aren't exactly figure-friendly, but one is very satisfying and a much better choice than one of those coffee shop monstrosities.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent basic recipe. I never have sour cream on hand, but I have substituted low-fat plain or flavored yogurt as well as soured milk, and the muffins have always come out beautifully. The most popular variation, in my experience, is: 1 generous cup of frozen berries, 1 scant cup flaked coconut, 1/2 cup rolled oats, and 1/2 tsp almond extract (in addition to the vanilla extract).

Fast to make, quick to cook, kids loved 'em. And the best part: the muffin tin was spotless after they came out! No clean up - yay!

I made the almond-cranberry variation suggested at the top of the recipe, and it was delicious. Simple, moist and mistake-proof, as far as I'm concerned. It is true that the batter was thick and scone-like, and not what I might expect for muffins. (I got a little nervous and added a bit more sour cream, in fact.) But the resulting muffins were not in the least bit dry. They were delightfully moist -- even several days later. These muffins have a very light, tangy, sour cream-y taste and texture to them, and they tasted wonderful with the yummy nuggets of cranberry and almond in them. I'm looking forward to trying other variations, too.

Rating: 4
WOW! This is an amazing muffin; they are so light, fluffy and very moist. I followed the recipe (with the exception of slightly reducing the sugar due to the inclusion of sugar coated coconut) and added: 2 ripe bananas, 1 1/2 cup coconut a splash of coconut extract and a splash of almond extract. They were fabulous! I will try two variants next time. 1) substitute coconut milk for the sour cream and 2) try buttermilk instead of the sour cream. I would like to reduce the cream with either a healthier fat, coconut cream, or a lower fat liquid, buttermilk. If anyone is willing to try this before I do, please let me know how they turn out. Enjoy these...this is a really good basic muffin recipe, replacing my old one.

Rating: 4
These are great! They were very easy to make and absolutely delicious with the addition of 3/4 cup pure maple syrup and 3/4 cup chopped pecans (plus 12 halves on top for decoration). I'll certainly make these again, and try some other additions, too.

Originally I was skeptical of the recipe. After having tried a few muffin recipes from various well known chefs that failed miserably, I was eager to try my hand at an epicurious recipe. Boy was I suprised at the outcome!!!! These muffins were a party in my mouth and everyone was invited. The batter had me a little worried but I kept my faith and composure with the help of my co-chef, Jordan (prounounced jzoor-DAAHN). After much deliberation, we decided on dried cranberries, walnuts, chocolate chunks as add-ins. We sat in sweet anticipation while the muffins baked. As I pulled them from the oven I was pleased to find out that I was getting two treats in one...muffins and scones!! Jordan christened theses delictible treats "scuffins." THE END... We made no modifications to the recipe and they were amazingly delicious.

I used the proportions in this recipe but I changed the procedure. I used the creaming method. I beat the butter, added the (1/2cup) sugar and creamed to light and fluffy. I added the egg, mixed well then stirred in the sour cram and vanilla. I sort of folded in the dry ingredients and then the mix-ins ((1)blueberries and lemon zest (2) dried apricots, white chocolate and walnuts) baked in jumbo muffin tins (only got 4) sprinkled with sugar on top. They came out light, fluffy, moist and tender. I will make these again and look forward to creating many different variations. I'm working on an almond and toasted coconut version next!!

Rating: 3
Thsi is a great easy recipe. I made two muffin combinations that both turned out to be great. My first had almond extract, raspberry jam, and almond slices. My second mix-in was cream cheese and raspberries. Both of these recipes are quick, easy, and can be made for both dessert and breakfast!

Rating: 3
As others have said, a great basic recipe. I added fresh raspberries, and the tartness was a great contrast with the muffin itself. I increased the sugar a little, as recommended below, and sprinkled some on top as well. I think my muffin pan was a little bigger than 1/3 cup, so the muffins didn't rise much above the pan. But they were moist and delicious. Will definitely be making these again.

Rating: 3
This is a great basic recipe. It's basically a blank canvas for anything you can dream up. I did't have sour cream on hand, so I substituted one cup of milk left to stand with one tablespoon white vinegar (makeshift buttermilk). Also, I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and sprinkled a scant amount more on the tops as other reviewers suggested. I mixed in pecans and chocolate chips and piping hot out of the oven they are a real treat! Light, fluffy, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Maybe some people are encountering a dry or dense muffin because they over-mixed the batter. I made sure to leave mine lumpy like when making pancakes.

Rating: 3
After reading the 'results may vary' reviews below I just had to try this one for myself...I give it a thumbs up! While the batter was scone-like, the result was plenty moist and muffin-like. I followed the suggestion to use 1/2 cup of sugar and would do so again. I used 1 cup of fresh strawberries with 3/4 cup of toasted sliced almonds and 1/4 tsp almond extract. Found they needed to cool in the muffin tin otherwise they collapsed a little around the berries. I'll make it again (my husband ate them up) and look forward to trying some variations...

grated rind of one (or two)orange(s) and Ghirardelli Double Chocolate chips... yum! Even better, combine another orange worth of grated rind and a cup of sugar and either sprinkle on top before baking or dip tops in butter and then orange sugar after they're baked.

This is a solid performer. I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and sprinkled the tops of the muffins with sugar prior to baking. I only got 7 muffins out of it because I like a big crunchy muffin top. Will definitely be making more in the very near future. Easy and Good! My first batch I did with dried cherries (sweet not tart, though tart would've been better) and toasted almonds. I am eager to see summer fruits arrive so that I can do raspberrt-white chocolate, blueberry-peach, blackberry-banana, etc.

So easy and versatile! I tried this recipe in my quest for an easy, delicious muffin to make for my family. I made a batch of mini-muffins for my son's kindergarten class and added 1 cup of quick oats and two ripe bananas. I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I got 60 mini muffins out of the recipe--plenty for the class and enough left over to stick in the freezer for my two year old. I made another batch the next day, this time adding another cup of oatmeal and, since I was out of bananas, a glob of cinnamon streusel and swirled it in. I topped them off with more streusel and they came out perfectly. I love the fact that, even after increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup, they weren't too sweet. I made another batch on Sunday for brunch and replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of cornmeal and threw in two cups of blueberries from the freezer and added a half teaspoon of cinnamon. They were unbelievable! This last batch only made eleven muffins (the oatmeal makes the difference). I think my muffin quest is over--I will make these again and again. There's no end to the possibilities: Cream cheese and green onion? Orange and dried cranberries? Applesauce and walnut? Hmmmm...

This is a great basic muffin recipe! So far I've made cinnamon pear muffins and fresh blackberry muffins. My husband, who rarely eats breakfast during the week loves them and takes them to work every morning! I find this recipe quick, easy, and very versitile.

Rating: 4
Absolutely excellent! So many muffins these days are more like cupcakes and the batters are so thin that you can't add anything because whatever you add all sinks to the bottom. I read all those previous reviews about adding more sugar and more liquic and not making a dozen... I didn't change a thing. I added about a cup, or maybe a tad more, of Hershey's cinnamon chips and I used a basic brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, butter streusal topping. I can see how adding sugar might be a good thing with some additions but the cinnamon chips are quite sweet so I didn't in this case. I got a dozen nice looking muffins out of this recipe - I suspect the folks who didn't probably had a slightly different sized muffin tin. Way back when I left home for the first time I filched my Mom's old muffin tin and it has slightly smaller cups than the newer tins I've bought. And one last note - this morning I discovered that I'd forgotten to wrap the leftovers up... at first touch they seemed a bit dried out but I tried one dunked in coffee and I think it was better than fresh - that coffee and cinnamon together was heavenly.

I have already reviewed this recipe once, but I think my comments might help for those who've never tried it. I love this recipe because you can do so much with it. However, I do find that what you add makes all the difference as to the finished product. When I am using dried fruits (and I have tried them all with this recipe) they tend to come out more like scones, so I bake them just like a drop biscuit. People seem to really love dried cranberries and almonds. If you're using fresh or frozen fruits, such as blueberries, they won't work as a biscuit type... they MUST be baked in a muffin tin, and they do turn out perfectly. The rule of thumb here, as far as I can see, is that when you're adding anything juicy make it as a muffin, anything dried... make it as a biscuit. Either way this recipe has a great taste, and I've never ever had them come out dry. Happy Baking Everyone!

These were so easy to make and adapt! I only filled eleven cups, which was just the right amount. I used two teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1.5, which made the muffins rise very nicely. White chocolate chips and raspberries was a hit, but everyone's favorite was dried cherries (1c), coconut (1c) with a pecan streusel topping (the recipe for walnut streusel on this site, except with pecans). If you make the streusel, either halve the recipe or be prepared to use it for two batches of muffins.

I printed this recipe a long time ago and have been wanting to try it, and finally did. I am looking forward to trying it again, as I had mixed results. My batter ended up very dough-like and firm. I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk just to be able to incorporate my add-ins. They were quite tasty, but next time I will make sure my sour cream and egg are at room temp., which I think may be the key to keeping the batter at the proper consistency (once I added the egg and sour cream to the butter, the butter sort of re-hardened). I used chopped dried cherries and chopped toasted pecans, and this was delicious, making muffins with slightly rounded tops. I tried lemon-poppy seed with 1/4 cup poppy seeds and 2-4 TBSP lemon juice and ended up with muffins that did not rise at all. Next time will try using 1 tsp lemon extract instead. SO, mixed results: Use room-temp ingredients, experiment with add-ins.

These muffins were delicious! The people who said they were dry must have done something wrong; I found mine extremely moist. I ran out of sour cream so I had to use 2/3 cup of sour cream and 1/3 cup of milk. They were still great. I split the recipe in two and added 1/2 a cup of blueberries to one half and 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 2/3 of a banana to the other. Both mix ins were great! I can't wait to try more!

I made this recipe yesterday with dried apricots and chocolate chips (3/4 of a cup each). I didn't have enough sour cream so I used 1/2 a cup and added 1/2 a cup of milk. They were delicious. My family loved them and I'm now baking another batch!

Okay...so it was one of those mornings there was nothing for the kids breakfast and I whipped these up before school. Didn't have butter, used veg. oil instead, didn't have sour cream so used cottage cheese instead. Didn't have anything to add, so just baked "as is". Still, these were wonderful! What a great recipe that you can do so much to potentionally ruin it and it still works!!

I made the recipe exactly as written with 1c chopped, toasted almonds and 3/4c dried sweet cherries. The muffins were very tasty and moist while warm, but they firm up and seem more dense at room temp. I think they are best warmed up. Very rich! I made 9 large muffins.

2.5 stars is a more accurate view. Added the additional sugar, most reviews recommended and found it to be a little too sweet. Employed the extra milk and the muffins were indeed quite moist. For 'mix-ins',1- almonds with dried cranberries and 2- coconut with diced apples were both tasty.

A good base recipe. I added 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1 cup of muesli cereal. Like other reviewer I added 1/4 cup of milk. However, I did use cake & pastry flour. Made only 10 larger size muffins. Light, fluffy, moist, rose well. Looking forward to trying many different combos.

These sounded great, so I made a double batch to try two mix ins, but I was surprised at how small and flat these muffins turned out. The dough hardly rose at all. I made the banana chocolate chip, which was yummy. And I tried 1 cup raspberries (frozen), the zest of one lemon and 1 tbsp lemon juice. These turned out way too tart. Would recommend only making 8 muffins instead of 12 if you want a normal muffin shape.

Muffins did not rise very well and are not very "fluffy" but rather dense.

I followed the recipe and found it produced more of a "dough" than a batter, therefore I added 1/4 cup of milk because it just didn't seem right. Although I felt that the batter still could have used even more moisture, I didn't add any more than the 1/4 cup milk. I was pleasantly surprised that the baked muffins were so moist and delicious! My 2-year-old and her friends absolutely gobbled up the banana oatmeal mini-muffins that I made. This recipe is a keeper, just don't be put off by the batter if it seems a bit strange.

This is a really good, moist muffin recipe. The sour cream makes all the difference. I made it with 1 chopped banana and 2/3 cup of walnuts for a wonderfully tasty banana-nut muffin. I also followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 1/2 cup of sugar.

Can you be in love with a recipe? I think I am. Today I made this with some different additions... I used 3 bananas(mashed) a cup of quick oats, and about 2/3 cup of sunflower seeds. I baked them in muffin tins, and had just enough to fill 12 cups all the way... they came out beautiful. Just make sure you bake them the full 20 minutes.

I was puzzled to see that many reviewers found this recipe dry and scone-like while others claimed it to be moist and delicious. Quite a contradiction! I gave it a try and I have to side with the moist and delicious folks. I used nearly two cups of mixed fresh berries as the "mix-ins." I think this may have been too much "mix-in" as my muffins did not rise far above the rim of the muffin tins - they were wonderful nonetheless. I wonder whether the use of wet ingredients (fresh fruit) versus dry ingredients (dried fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, etc.) is what makes the difference in the moist versus dry and scone-like debate?

Rating: 4
These muffins are awesome. I thought 1/3 cup of sugar was fine, especially with the chocolate chips. Really rich, so not an everyday muffin or I'd pack the pounds on...Good for dessert. Make sure to use a slightly underripe banana so they don't mush up in your batter.

These were so good! I made one batch with banana and choc chip and one with orange zest (from a whole orange) and 3/4 cup of dried cranberries. I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I baked for only 35 minutes and next time will probably cut that down to 30.

This is great! Moist, chewy, and crispy on the edges. I followed other reviewers' suggestions of using more sugar and recommend it. I also dropped the batter directly onto a cookie sheet and it was fine. I added 1+1/2cups of chopped apple and pear and spices. I used reduced fat sour cream. They are "fully cooked" before they brown but it doesn't seem to do any harm to leave them in a little longer. Next time I might add a crumb topping. Another reviewer would probably give this four stars, but I reserve that for the rare truly exceptional recipies that make me force food on all my friends.

Rating: 3
Very delicious. I had to add some milk because the batter was the consistency of cookie dough (it also tasted good raw). I used light sour cream, 6 tbs of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, and added vanilla, cinnamon, and mini chocolate chips. They were nice and light and fluffy in the middle with crisp outsides. I'll certainly re-use this recipe as a template for berry muffins, etc.

The second time I made these, I dropped them by tablespoon fulls onto a greased cookie sheet and called them scones! Tres trendy! I used white chocolate chips, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts.

my true rating would be about a 2 1/2 stars - good but not great! This recipe is handy for making an assortment all at once - I doubled the recipe and then split it into four batches. If I wanted one specific type of muffin, I would be inclined to look for a single recipe geared to only that flavor. They seemed cooked long before they browned so they looked a bit pasty.

I'm sure lots of people will like this muffins, but they're not my type. They were very-biscuity, dry, and bland. I like my muffins moister and richer. The suggested additions of cranberries and almonds, etc., saved them -- that was a great combo. I plan on using those flavorings in a better recipe, once I find it.

A good basic muffin recipe. I made the banana-choc chip recipe (I recommend using 1.5 bananas) and really enjoyed them. However, if you have a Calphalon muffin pan like I do, you will likely get muffins with brown edges/bottoms and white tops (I even baked them on one of the top racks). Asthetically not as pleasing, but still tasty. I also recommend increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Rating: 4
I baked these using a larger amount of sugar but otherwise left the remaining ingredients unchanged. we had them hot out of the oven dipped in sugar and they literally melted in our mouths. I froze the few leftovers and reheat them in the microwave. Although the top is not crisp they are still wonderful. My five-year old demands them at every meal.

I used a scant half cup of sugar and added dried cherries and chopped macadamia nuts. Because I packed my regular muffin cups for a move, I used small muffin cups and custard cups each half full and baked until golden. They were a hit with my friends who asked to take the leftovers home.

I wanted to use up strawberries that I froze a while back, so I defrosted them for this recipe--they are yummy! I ended up with close to 2 cups mushy strawberries and used 2/3 cups sugar and a 12 oz. container of Horizon low-fat sour cream (I used real butter, though). Like Nancy's, these muffins did not rise much, but they are quite tasty and surprisingly light compared to what I was expecting.

Finally, I found a basic batter that's great. I added one and half cups of chopped ripe pears and it was fantastic. I substituted the sour cream with light sour cream which only has 18% fat content - the muffins turned out just as moist.

These muffins didn't rise very well. I added grated carrot, coconut, golden raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Made a nice "carrot cake" muffin. Also I added more sugar because the first time I made them they were not very sweet.

What a great mix! I added rinsed, chopped canned bing cherries and boy were they good! Didn't rise as much but it didn't matter. I am always looking for a good, basic recipe and this fits the bill. The addition of the sour cream really makes them moist.

Makes such a nice muffin. Just the right texture, and it is fun to think of new additions and combinations. We loved the banana/chocolate chip/walnut version. Try these.

Really moist,made jaffa muffins with a little bit of grated orange rind with chop chips. Didn't last long enough to know if they keep well.

I was so thrilled to have finally found a muffin recipe that works! The muffins were just the right consistency, even if I had used 1 C. all-purpose flour and 1/2 C. 100% whole-wheat cake & pastry flour (for added fibre). I will definitely use this recipe, with all its varied mix-in ingredients, again and again.

I've been testing muffin recipes for a friend opening a bed and breakfast soon. I've tried 6 different recipes. This is the best. The sour cream makes them moist and tasty. I added 1 cup of blueberries.

I make a lot of muffins and this recipe is definitely one of the best. I used 2 very ripe mashed bananas (can't be used for anything else!), zest from one orange, and 1/2 cup walnuts, and they were great. Very moist, and not too sweet.
