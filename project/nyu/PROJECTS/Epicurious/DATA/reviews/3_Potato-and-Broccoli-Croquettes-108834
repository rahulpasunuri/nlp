Excellent. I added chopped scallions as another reviewer suggested. I took the leftovers to work for lunch the next day and they were great cold as well.

Yummy! Served with a spicy cheddar cheese sauce. Nice vegetarian entree.

Good quick way to use up leftovers (potatoes, broccoli, bread). Not fabulous but a nice meal nonetheless. I added in smoked salmon and green onions. A nice take on the latke.

Surprisingly light, and very good. Quick and easy. I served scallions, bacon and goat cheese to dress them up a little.

I found this recipe while trying to figure out what to make for some friends that were coming for dinner, that also halppen to be vegetarian. It was delicious. They wanted the recipe and my family has asked me to make some for Thanksgiving which is exactly what I'm getting ready to do.

These were good. I wouldn't make them for a special dinner like Thanksgiving but I might for an everyday meal. I liked them with a little cayenne and sour cream.
