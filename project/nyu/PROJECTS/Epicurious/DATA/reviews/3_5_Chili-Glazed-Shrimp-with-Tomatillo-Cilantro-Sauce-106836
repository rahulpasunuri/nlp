I think the recipe in the photo is "Rice, Pinto Bean, and Corn Salad" from Bon Appetit, July 2002 also.

I made this to serve as an appetizer so did not include the cheese. The shrimp were quite good but the tomatillo sauce was very blah. I added salt more jalapeno and it still tasted yuk so I squished up an avacado and added a llittle of the sauce to it plus a lot more salt and hot sauce. Everyone loved it.

Very good and easy. I omitted the queso fresco, didn't quite see it in the dish. I found the heat to be just right and the tomatillo sauce is amazing.

This was different and very good. My guests loved it. I marinated the shrimps for a couple of hours in the oil and spices and then cooked them on the grill. Delicious.

Edible, but not worth making again. The sauce was kind of blah, and there are many other shrimp recipes on this website that are far better.

I made this and was delicious. After I cooked the shrimp I added some chopped garlic and sherry and was soooooooooooooo good.

This was a hit at my dinner party last night. I added about two tablespoons of sugar to the sauce and lots of salt. But it was really easy and yummy.

This was the second time I have made the dish. it is great as always-it is really good with the rice dish that accompanies it in the picture, but I lost that issue of Bon Appetit and I can't find the recipe-we just made a mexican rice and corn on the cob. Our guest loved it. The tomatillo sauce could stand to be a little hotter.

This was fantastic! I made it with chicken and divided the tomatillo sauce in half and added some jalapeno to one part. Quick and impressive

My guests and I liked this recipe a lot. Fairly easy to make. I will omit the cheese next time I make this -- not necessary because you can't taste it.

perfect as is for people accustomed to a little heat. you don't use much salsa, so heat is subtle, but adjust if you prefer less heat. also, save time with tomatillos! husk them, wash with soap and water then quarter them and put in blender. will thicken when you cook on stovetop.

This was delicious. I did, however, have to adjust sauce by adding some sugar to calm the hotness and strong flavor. My boyfriend was thrilled with the different flavor and interesting presentation. I served with spiced refried beans, grilled squash marinated in a yogurt/garlic/cilantro/shallot/mandarin orange juice marinade. Also served a salad w/mandarin oranges, avacado, cilantro, grn onion and celery with the chilled marinade/dressing described above. It really provided a cool contrast to this fab dish

This recipe is VERY easy and looks/tastes as though it was much more difficult. Wonderful for summer with Rice, Pinto Bean and Corn salad! To make the shrimp extra easy, use store bought green tomatillo salsa! YUM!

Fantastico! My husband, an Irish-American married to a Mexican-American, loves this dish and has asked for it repeatedly. It comes together very quickly, is impressive for entertaining, and is a great accompaniment to margaritas on a hot summer evening. It is spicy, but so what! Some like it hot!

I made this for friends and everyone loved it! I did reduce the amount of ancho by half, since the tomatillo sauce was plenty spicy. There were no leftovers!

My sister made this recipe for my potluck party. The shrimp was a hit! I barely got to have one or two before the other guests polished it off. I'm going to make it tonight for friends for dinner.

The peppers ruined perfectly good shrimp. How about a receipe where you can tasted the shrimp?

I thought the shrimp were spicy and delicious and the tomatillo sauce easy and great! I found ground acho chili powder in the spice section and tomatillos in the produce section of my local Publix in Atlanta.

You can buy ground ancho chilies from a company called ChileToday HotTamale. Their website is chiletoday.com.

Tomatillo - Cilantro sauce bland. Went to 3 grocery stores( 2 of which serve many Mexican families)to find ground ancho or New Mexico chiles- no luck. Bought whole dried chiles and cut them up but the taste was not there. Maybe if I could have found the ground chiles...

Very good, but packed a lot of heat! Adjusted the recipe for 2 servings and pan seared the shrimp.
