This recipe was not good. I thought the enchilada sauce would add a yummy spice-kick, but instead, it tasted like Mexican food!

I hate beans in chili and have made this recipe multiple times. It tastes best if made one ay refridgerated overnight and served the next day. Eliminates any "bitterness".

To a cook from Atlanta: Lighten up, this is home-style cooking not Le Cordon Bleu. This forum is supposed to be informative, but most of all, it should be fun.

Wow, this recipe seems to be generating some heat, but not in the kitchen. Like applesfordinner, I too found this chili to be a little bitter at first, but this seemed to dissipate over time, and I think it was due to the beer. (I took a note from applesFD and did not use masa.) In my opinion, a little experimentation with this recipe is required since as written it's a little bland and tastes too much like enchilada sauce. But I suppose that some will like it nonetheless.

Just had a tremendously delicious batch of this recipe prepared by a friend, then came online to look up the recipe. Applesfordinner, you're not unimpressed by this recipe, you're unimpressed by your own poor decisions and lack of skill in a kitchen.

This was my first attempt at making chili. Sadly, I'm not overly impressed. In all fairness, I made some modifications to the recipe. I used a mix of pork shoulder and beef (chuck) for the meats, and I decided to substitute masa harina for the flour. I also used both red (mild) and green (medium) enchilada sauce, which I thought gave a nice balance to the flavor (Hatch was the brand). Not being a fan of overly spicy foods, I didn't use the full amount of the canned chilies. I also used less cumin than was called for. My main problem with the recipe is that the longer I cooked the chili (for 3+ hours) the more bitter it became. I'm not sure why, but I suspect it has to do with overcooking/slightly burning the masa during the initial step (which is difficult to avoid). Or, the other possibility is the beer. One up side of cooking this chili longer than the recipe recommends is that it does end up tasting less like enchilada sauce. If I were to make this again, I would use flour (not masa) when cooking the meat, and if it needed thickening, I would then try masa, as other recipes seem to use. I would also only use pork, since it was much more tender than the beef. In the end, all was not lost, since even this chili can be resurrected with some good condiments - I used cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sliced green onions. Tomorrow when I reheat the chili, I may try to add some maple syrup or brown sugar to combat the bitterness if it's still there...

Beautiful chili, left the folks at the office asking for more.

We like this recipe and love hot food. To add flavor and thicken the chili, we have made some changes. We reduce the pork shoulder to 2 lbs and add 1/2 lb. cooked bacon, 1/2 lb cooked ground hot sausage (you could use regular sausage) and a can of black beans, drained. Like others reviewers, we cook it longer, usually 2 hours. It produces a thicker chili that doesn't taste like enchilada sauce.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it to be good but too hot/spicy. I used medium enchilada suace and that might have been the reason. I did not read the reviews first. Besides being very spicy, there was too much sauce to meat - very runny. I only simmered this for 1 hour and the pork was VERY tender. In addition to the sour cream and green onions, we added shredded cheddar cheese.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I put only one can of enchilada sauce in and 2 bottles of ale. Also I always taste the poblanos first before I decide how many to put in, they are way too hot for me.

I happened to be driving up the coast of california and stopped off at this little quaint "cafe". I ordered the chili and was blown way by the combination of flavors. Chili, is a very personal dish, and I enjoyed it so much not only did I ask for the recipe, but I asked if I could buy the remaining chili from the Kitchen! They did not "empty the kitchen", but packed some to go for me!! The did mention that they had been featured in Bon Appetite and I found it here at Epicurious! I have prepared this many times, sometimes making the mistake and substituing item when not available (Pork Should can be hard to come by). Don't substitute. It is truly the best chili I have ever eaten.

Flavorful, hearty chili. Definitely cook for several hours. Maybe use slow cooker? To cynic: Cilantro is disgusting. Never, ever use this stuff unless you want to ruin a meal! nocilantro.com

Like others,I definitely would let this simmer 4+ hours. Would also cut back on the amount of the enchilada sauce and maybe cut the meat in somewhat smaller chunks. Rating chili recipes is tough. Like BBQ, everyone has definite opinions on style. But this was a good version for 'chunk pork' style.

Omit the canned diced tomatoes and use canned STEWED tomatoes and MINCE them yourself. Use GREEN enchilada sauce. A good decent brand. Hatch is very tasty. You could use it as a SOUP right out of the can it is so good. The PRICE will tell you the quality. Only flour the pork if you don't have masa flour (masa harina...superfine cornmeal, used for tortillas or to THICKEN CHILI). Forget freekin' cumin in green chili. What universe are you guys from? Use about half a cup of chopped fresh cilantro. Omit chili powder. Everything IN this recipe is chili for chrissakes! The beer is good. Add more onion, the chopped GREEN variety! I like the garlc. Use FRESH not jarred!

My boyfriend and I love this chili. I have made it several times. I use 1 can of red enchilada sauce and 1 green. Per my boyfriend's request, I use Michelob Amber Bock for the beer, and it gives the chili a great taste. It's good served over rice and topped with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Yum!!

I've made better chili, but this one was good too. I tasted it after the hour or so, and found it needed a bit more Chimayo Hot chili powder and cumin. Then, I let it stand two hours for flavors to mellow out. Reheated it to serve. I prefer using my own chili sauce, but tried it with the canned (mild) as the recipe says.

This recipe is good for one thing: introducing folks to the idea of using chunks of meat in a chili rather than ground beef. However, the recipe is weak. This dish tastes like enchilada sauce, no matter how long you cook it. Don't get me wrong, I like enchilada sauce, but I don't care for it as the base for chili. There are so many better chili recipes I don't know why you would set your heart on this one. For the people who like the chunks of pork in the chili, look around for a chili verde or green chili recipe. Those will usually call for chunk pork or goat.

Thanks to all the reviewers who said cook for a long time -- it really made the difference. I went to three supermarkets and couldn't find enchilada sauce, so used taco sauce, and it was delicious... This is so easy, just put it on the stove, and do something else for 8 hours.. will definately make this again.

Yum! This is a great chili recipe! My guests loved the "chunks" of pork rather than just ground beef. I would definitely recommend simmering for longer than the 1 hour in the recipe. It brings out the flavors and lets the chili thicken. After 1 hour of simmering, it was still the consistency of stew.

I absolutely loved this chili. I used 2 pounds of sirloin steak I cubed myself and added it with 2 pounds of pork chops from the butcher. The recipe calls for an amber beer, but we used a Sam Adams Octoberfest for more flavor along with more cumin and chili powder. It actually won 2nd place in a chili cook-off. It helps to let the chili simmer for about 7-8 hours. Enjoy!!!

I've made this recipe a million times now and it's great and yes I've changed a couple things. I know it's "wrong" to do this to "chili" but I put in a lot of kidney beans and instead of the pork I used ground dark meat turkey. Made it a little healthier with the beans and low fat meat. The flavors of the sauce/beer/enchilada/tomato sauce makes this dish wonderful! Make sure you use an amber ale beer with this! It's make all the flavor difference!

Great recipe! I made it for my husband's annual chili cook-off. We won 1st prize. The only changes I made were - added more pork and used about a 1/3 less of the enchilada sauce. I let it simmer for over 5 hours. It was delicious.

This is great chili, and as with any recipe I use it as a guide line. With a few changes, I won First Place at a local chili cook off, one of the judges said it was the best chili he ever ate. I cooked it for almost 8 hours, until the meat was falling apart. As a Fireman, I cook this at work for the guys, this is one of the most requested meals I cook. I have found that for the beer, New Castle Brown works the best.

I used this recipe to provide my dish at a neighborhood Fall party. I doubled the recipe and added 1 lb bacon. My dish was the hit out of over 20 dishes. Everyone who tried it loved it and asked for the recipe.

Great flavor. The pork shoulder is very tender. Use mild sauce. Anything more spicy and you loose the flavor. Perfect for our Minnesota winters and a great alternative to your typical chili.

This is a great chili recipe. Use mild enchilada sauce for a mild chile and medium for a hot chile.

This chili tasted like a bowl of enchalada sauce and was too spicy for my family to enjoy. I would not make it again, even with recipe alterations.

This is a delicious and quite a simple recipe to fix. I found a little too spicy for the youngsters but young adults and hungry guys loved it.
