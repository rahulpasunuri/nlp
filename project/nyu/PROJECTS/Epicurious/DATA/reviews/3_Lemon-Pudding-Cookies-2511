I used buttermilk baking mix for pancakes and biscuits and such. At first when I tried this recipe I used lemon jello mix instead...not the best cookies I've made. BUT I finally found a store that sold lemon pudding mix and used that with the buttermilk mix. Now the recipe calls for 1/4 cup of oil, but I used about a 1/2 cup (I estimated) because 1/4 wasn't enough to get a firm batter. I also baked them for 20 mins not 10. (certain ovens may allow it to be baked for less time, just make sure it doesn't brown too much). When it's first taken out of the oven it's super soft. Let them cool on the baking sheet until it hardens a bit. I didn't even need to put them on a rack to cool because the oil in the cookies keeps the bottom from burning. Final product was excellent, very tasty and the texture is amazing.

What is buttermilk baking mix? Buttermilk pancakes? biscuits? Need a better understanding of what this is. Help!

I found this recipe while trying to find one for some sort of lemon cornmeal cookie. I switched out the biscuit mix for an equal amount of corn muffin mix, and the result was surprisingly good. The folks I made them for liked them more than the chocolate cookies I had made totally from scratch.

I have made this recipe so many times and I have more people ask me for it. I have substituted chocolate pudding and butterscotch pudding and vanilla all with extremely good results. I also have taken a shortbread cookie press to them and they keep some of the design if it is deep. These are great for every occasion. Kids as well as adults love them.

Not the best cookies I ever had, but VERY easy and worth the effort involved. They could have been a bit sweeter, maybe with 2 tbsp of sugar in the mix.

Baking mix and instant pudding? What's the point? It's not like cookies are hard to make from scratch!
