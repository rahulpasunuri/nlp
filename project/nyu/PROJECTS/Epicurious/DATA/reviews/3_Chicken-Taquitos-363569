Its too mushy try adding less barbeque and sour cream. The barbeque made it taste a little sweeter than I like it could be skipped.

I used all the same ingredients from the recipe, but in different proportions and it came out great. I used a few tablespoons each of BBQ sauce and sour cream instead of the cup each that was recommended and it came out great. You just need enough of the liquid ingredients to bind the mixture and give it extra flavor. I would defintiely make this again and maybe even try baking them instead of frying them for guilt free taquitos.

This was surprisingly really good. I love BBQ sauce so I didn't mind the strong BBQ flavor. I forgot the cheese,but that's okay because I don't really like cheese. They were still good and probably even better with the cheese. I like the idea of one reviewer to maybe add black beans and even out it in a salad. Also, I used corn tortillas and it was a pain to try to work with them. I ended up getting each one a little wet and microwaving it a few seconds to make it easier to work with. I would make it again

Loved it! A little time consuming but so worth it! Hint...I would use the fajita sized tortillas..not regular sized.

This reminded me of a Southwest Barbecue salad, minus the salad! Great recipe, easy and quick. I made them with large tortillas and they were like chimichangas. I would make again. Next time I would add black beans into the mixture.

These were good - the only changes I made were I subbed cheddar for the gouda, which I didn't have, and I doubled the amount of cumin. Not something that I would make again as written as the bbq sauce is (predictably) the dominant and somewhat boring flavour. A good base, however, and I'll definitely make them again - probably will reduce the sour cream and use just a little bbq sauce and add some homemade salsa or enchilada sauce instead.

I thought the bbq sauce part sounded Icky... so I did a bit of taste test & I was right.... gross. I went with salsa. i roasted my own chicken for about $3. for the adults in the fam I added crush red ppr. served w salsa con queso, guac,& salsa. this was a HUGE hit. and the recipe made so much after feeding 3 kids & 5 adults I filled a 2 gal freezer bag with the left ovr. individual frozen first then tumped them together. very easy for everyone to grab one or two for lunch n heat 5 min toster oven. OH AND rolls were opening up, so I "egg rolled" them. sealed them up & great texture. will be common place in my house

i made these for supper tonite - served them with spanish rice and pinto beans. i followed the recipe as written with the exception of omitting the garlic and using kinder's roasted garlic bbq sauce. i also used corn tortillas instead of flour (i have celiac disease). very yummy and my family raved. i agree with another reviewer who said it made enough for an army. i froze the filling and will make them again in a couple of weeks!

I did not care for it much. I would maybe do a refried bean filling instead. It was very rich.

i served this at my Super Bowl party and everyone loved it. i added more filling to each and made more of a burrito. in fact, rather than frying i sprayed with olive oil and baked until crispy. additionally i had some extra filling which i put in an oven proof dish, warmed and then put out as a dip with tortilla chips.

You would be better off going to Taco Bell. Gross.

Printed the recipe and left it at work; couldn't find on line after buying the ingredients I remembered. Left out the corn, and chili powder, recalled another review so left off the Gouda. Bought a 16 pack of tortillas and had to handmake another 8 from scratch. Yummy with the guacamole I made while the tortilla dough rested. Will do again - by the recipe next time!

These were fun to eat and fun to make. I increased the dry spices and garlic and used a little dried chipotle pepper powder. I think adding a fresh jalepeno would be just the thing next time. (I love the heat!) Next time I might try to replace half the BBQ sauce with some black bean salsa. I did have a little snafu with the tortillas, as they kept breaking up as we tried to roll them. We ended up just breaking the tortillas in half and making quesadilla type things out of them. Still very good. The recipe makes enough food for an army... so you could definitely get by with halving the recipe for a couple or small family. But we have enough filling in the freezer to add as a protein to a taco salad at the end of the week!

These were awesome! I wanted to make it somewhat healthier for my superbowl get-together ... so I used 4 large chicken breasts ... grilled, then shredded. I reduced the sour cream considerably ... more like 1/4 cup of grass-fed sour cream. I kept the cheese amounts basically the same ... maybe a little less and I left out the corn. But I used all the other ingredients for the filling as written. For the tortillas I used Ezekial sprouted grain wraps. I did lightly brown them in macadamia nut oil. With all those healthy adjustments ... they were still YUM!! Everyone loved them!!!

Delicious! I only had half a roasted chicken, so I halved all the other ingredients, but still ended up with plenty for my household. My usually picky teens devoured them! I really like how they can be prepped early, and just quickly fried up at the last minute.

Can anybody tell me if I were to use boneless chicken breasts and shred them, how much should I use? I was thinking 1.5 lbs, but I really have no idea.

The recipe sounds amazing; I'm curious as to whether ppl used the burrito sized tortillas or the soft taco size. Thanks!

Just a heads up for those who find deboning a chicken too tedious - Costco debones their rotisserie chickens and sells the meat in 2# shrink wraps, usually right next to the rotisserie chickens. Now THAT's quick and easy.

Tasty filling and ingredients. Since you are using cooked meat in the filling, you can certainly experiment with the bbq sauce and the amt. thats not too much for your tastes. I may try baking these, lightly sprayed with olive oil for lighter fare. By the way,if you've never deboned a precooked roasted chicken, it's a two minute job tops! Much quicker and easier and often times cheaper than buying, cooking and de-boning your own.

Best Taquitos I ever had. My husband, 5 yr old and 2 yr old LOVED them. The only change I made was to saute chicken breasts and chop them up , b/c the store was out of rotisserie chicken and I sauteed the corn so it added that extra grilled flavor, other than that I followed the recipe. I also froze the left over Taquitos for another day :)

If using store bought rotisserie chicken, buy one that is hot and take meat off the bone as soon as you get home. A warm chicken is easier to debone.

These taquitos are seriously amazing!!!

The chicken is already cooked. Nothing is easier than removing the bones and shredding after it as be cooked. Skipped the sauce and loved it. Dipping it in salsa was good; maybe you could dip it in the BBQ sauce and adjust the amount to taste easier.

LOVED this recipe. Really simple and delicious.

These are not taquitos, they are flautas. The two are very similar but taquitos are made with corn tortillas and flautas are made with flour tortillas.

Just OK. I wondered about the BBQ sauce, and as I suspected it made this dish too sweet. I don't think the gouda made a difference -- if it's in the recipe for the smokey flavor, it's overpowered by the BBQ sauce. I would just use only jack cheese. I doubled the green chiles, and still couldn't taste them. I'm marking this recipe as "will make it again," only because I want to try it with modifications. Any ideas for substitutions for the BBQ sauce? Mole sauce maybe? Red enchilada sauce? A splash of adobo sauce?

Loved it! I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant about the barbecue sauce, but decided to make them exactly as the recipe was written. They were delicious. I would definitely make them again. Thanks!

this was good I made it tonight for dinner with some spanish rice it was good quick and easy, I do think I need to work on making the wraps a little tighter but that wasnt the recipes fault

cutting chicken off the bone is hard ? maybe cooks in Miami have it easy ? cook from california

This was great and in spite of the Miami cook's comment, really easy. Really Miami - how difficult is it to shred a whole rotisserie roasted chicken? I'll be making this for game day.

De-bone the chicken....as "Quick and Easy" recipe? I think we can do better for the Quick and Easy category. Some of us have real jobs.
