This was excellent. Didn't have time to look for plain smoked whitefish, so I bought some whitefish salad from the bagel store. After reading other reviews, I steamed the leeks rather than boiling them - they held together well.

This dish was very very good, but I wasn't able to make it look beautiful in the way that a composed salad should. The main issue was that the leeks came out a bit slimy, but then I used very young leeks from my garden. Like another reviewer I substituted trout for the whitefish and the flavors were still excellent. Highly recommended with a bit of practice.

this turned out to be a 'conversion' recipe--it turned an avowed whitefish hater around. the quote was, "really, that's all of it?" :)

We really liked this. We couldn't get whitefish, so I substituted smoked trout and it was fabulous. Next time, I will add some diced boiled potatoes for extra body and to moderate the richeness of the fish. Also, next time I'll char the leeks in the broiler for a few minutes after boiling them. An easy dish with a great payoff.
