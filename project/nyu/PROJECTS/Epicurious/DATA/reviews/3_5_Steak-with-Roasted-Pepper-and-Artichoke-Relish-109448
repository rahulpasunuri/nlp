I made just the relish to top some sliced flank steak for a dinner party. It was WONDERFUL. I forsee using the leftovers as bruschetta topping, on pasta, or maybe just straight from the bowl.

I love the simplicity of this recipe and it's a great way to dress up a BBQ'd steak. The blend of flavours is amazing.

One of our mainstay recipes. My wife and I really love it. We substitute frozen roasted peppers for the jarred--much, much tastier.

Well, my husband liked it, but I thought it was just so-so. I really liked the relish, but it was cold and the meat hot, so I thought that was a little weird. Good flavors and pretty, but not enough to make me make it again. Used up some extra ingredients that I had left over from a party - so that was a bonus!

This was really good. I roasted fresh peppers, and made extra dressing. I am a low-carb follower, so I used the extra dressing on salad greens, and sliced the steak and served it and the relish on the top of the salad. Delicious.

This wasn't especially interesting; rather bland.
