I am not going to rate this recipe because I took so many liberties with it, but I do think some of you might find my review helpful. I used Bartlett pears because I received a huge box of them for Christmas. I used Thai Red Curry Paste instead of curry powder----and I used at least four teaspoons of it and I added Sriracha sauce as well--lots and lots of spice, and it was not too much. I layered the pears, scallops, kumquats, and cilantro on a rice cracker spread with curry butter. Some guests shied away because they couldn't recognize all the ingredients. The guests who tried them praised the taste and appearance but didn't go for seconds. They were hard to eat. Also, the spices didn't penetrate the scallops until they had marinated for three days. If I ever make these again, I will marinate the scallops for three days and then serve the pear, scallop, kumquat, and cilantro on a toothpick.

A delightful combination of flavors. Easy to make, pretty to look at, and very tasty. The perfect hors d'oeuvres.

Guest at our Sake tasting party loved this. I couldn't find kumquats, so I used supremed orange sections cut in half. Still very good. I'm wondering if kiwi pieces could also be used. I skewered the pieces to make them easier to handle. Very pretty. I thought the coconut curry mixture was a little too tart and added a little brown sugar. Delicious complex flavor.
