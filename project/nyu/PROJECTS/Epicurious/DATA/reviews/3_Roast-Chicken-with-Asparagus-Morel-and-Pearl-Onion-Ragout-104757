I've made this three times in three weeks, and it has been a hit each time. The second time out, we were having asparagus as a starter, so I subbed with sprouted broccolli, which was equally delicious. It is quite easy to prep most of this well before cooking, and so is a snap for entertaininf - I got the asaragus steamed, the onions peeled, and the mushrooms soaked well in advance, and I didn't baste too much, but put the butter under the chicken skin instead. All in all a real keeper.

The chicken itself came out nicely and was complemented by the ragout. I really liked the way the pearl onions, the morels, and the asparagus worked together to give a combination of flavors. I wasn't able to find young asparagus at short notice, so that was the weakest component of the dish. The recipe has a lot of things going in parallel steps that need timing, so it isn't one for the novice.

I thought this was very good and everyone I served it to liked it a lot. I didn't baste as frequently as the recipe called for--just every time I thought of it as I worked through the rest of the menu. Do yourself a favor--use frozen pearl onions! So much easier and same results.

This was good -- not fabulous -- but good. I prefer to incorporate the Roast Chicken part of this recipe with the Ragout of Pearl Onions, Peas and Artichokes also found on this site (with the addition of minded rosemary). Now that's fabulous!

Excellent and easy. The basting means this dish needs to be baby-sat, which can be tedious if you're busy. I stuffed butter and herbs under the skin of the breast, and then did the first 10 minutes of roasting breast-down so the juices could run into the breast meat. It came out crisp-skinned, with moist flavourful meat. Yum!

I thought it was well worth the effort. I completed the dish in under an hour and a half. To those who found the mushrooms tasteless or who thought the recipe too difficult, you might want to start simple. Besides, who wants a meal with only two steps to it? For anyone answering yes to that question, might I recommend Shake and Bake?

I thought this recipe was just Ok. I agree with the other reviewers, it is labor intensive (primarily preping the onions, asparagus, and morels). Although I haven't cooked morels before, I thought that they didn't have much taste - especially for the cost. The asparagus was VERY good though. Again, it's an OK recipe, but one that I will not make again.

Loved this recipe although it is very labor intensive. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about the ragout and how moist the chicken turned out. This is an easy recipe but very time consuming. I recommend saving this for the sort of crowd you'd invite into your kitchen while you finish cooking. It's definitely worth the work though.

This was delicious indeed however didn't find it all that easy. Basting every 7 minutes was a chore and it took alot longer than the total 1-1/4 hours to prepare.

Delicious and very easy. Thought the sauce for the ragout was delectable! Wouldn't change a thing.

Very disappointing. I had several apprehensions about the recipe upon reading it--temperature seemed to high for roasting chicken, lack of seasonings, too many steps throughout the entire cooking process. But, I was intrigued by the morel, pearl onion and asparagus ragout, so I decided to try it. My apprehensions were all accurate. Perhaps start the roasting on a higher temp, but drop the temp after 15 min. to 350. Suggest the butter be placed under the skin as well and add fresh thyme leaves with the butter, salt and pepper. Do not tie the legs. It prevented them from cooking evenly with the rest of the bird. We did not feel that the morels were the right mushroom--too delicate and special. The morel soaking broth overpowered their flavor. Suggest oyster or shiitakes which will stand up. Also, I would salt and pepper the onions and asparagus, then add to the mushrooms without more salt if using morels. Morels quickly absorb the salt before the other vegetables. AND--forget basting every seven minutes! This is not a dish to make for guests if you intend to enjoy their company as well as the food.

This dish is easy and delicious. Don't substitute for the morels, they make the dish. I roasted the chicken breast side down for the first two thirds of the cooking, then turned it breast up. My 4.5 lb. Kosher bird only needed 50 minutes in a convection/conventional oven. A rack was not necessary.
