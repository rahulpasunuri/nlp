It's' 2011... a full 8 years later, and the 'damn towel' typo is still hysterical... i didn't notice it in the recipe at first glance, so i couldn't understand why everyone was 'damn' this and 'damn' that in the comments. epicurious.com users are a very funny breed, indeed. :) oh..and no, i haven't made the triangles yet, but i have some nice myzithra i need to use up, so i'll make some this weekend and follow up later

Best way to keep phyllo workable is to place saran wrap over rolled out phyllo and then damp (aka damn) towel over. The towel keeps the saran wrap over the phyllo but the phyllo doesn't get to damp.

I thought this was fine, but too much work for the result. In some dishes I find the labor of using phyllo to be worth it, but not this one. It was rather bland.

Damn Good! These little triangles were simply perfect! Fun to make and a pleasure to eat...Will make these as an appetizer for future parties. Will double the recipe though, as my damn guests eat a lot!

Simple and tasty. The damn towel was the trick in keeping the phyllo manageable. I am still laughing at how everyone took the joke and ran with it!! Thanks for the laugh at the end of an extremely busy day.

Quite tasty. Checked with my token greek friend, who insists that using a damn towel is essential to making authentic phyllo-based dishes.

I'm a little phyllo-phobic, so I thought this would be a good recipe for practice. And, I, too, couldn't resist any recipe with a damn towel in it! I respectfully disagree with the earlier comment, though, and feel the damp towel helped keep the phyllo ready to use. I made these and put them in tupperware, lightly covered with another damn paper towel, and they held well untill it was time to go to the party and bake them. Everyone loved them. However, I did end up with a good bit extra filling!

Excellent recipe and I sure did like the hint about the damn kitchen towel! As a matter of fact, this recipe is now referred to as those damn yummy Greek triangles. Sorry!

This looks like a very good recipe..however re the damp kitchen towel, its not really necessary...I use phyllo dough all the time..I just cover it with a dry towel..beacause i find that a damp towel actually makes the phyllo stick together, and you have trouble seperating it.."simple is good"dont complicate..

Okay, I'm in the middle of a very stressful move (the old landlord is being very picky or should I say "pricky"! and this is the last time I have internet access at this location. In checking my email, I found the Epicurious Recipe Flash and ended up here! That "damn kitchen towel" has given me the best (and much needed) laugh of the day. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I have bookmarked this recipe and aim to make it when I am settled in my new home. So, no I haven't made it but rated it 4 forks anyway because it was truly a stress relief "beyond compare"!

I substituted a freakin' wet napkin for the damn kitchen towel and it turned out fine.

I'm not sure how I would get a damn towel. Is it the opposite of a holy towel? But I will try the recipe, it looks fabulous.
