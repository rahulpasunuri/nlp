Perhaps I worked the dough too much, but these came out too heavy and chewy. The flavor was okay but nothing to write home about. I've since made a version of this recipe with Bisquick that turned out just as good if not better and was a lot easier to prepare.

Wonderful!! My only change was to use a dough blender (like for piecrust) to mix the butter into the flour instead of my hands. I was worried about warming the butter to much and possibly making it pasty. These biscuits work well with a rustic x-mas ham. You can even make little mini ham sandwiches with the biscuits, yum yum.

These are exactly as three forks is described - delicious. You can't go wrong with these!

These were very delicious and so simple to prepare! They were even good reheated in the microwave with leftovers. They didn't get soggy or greasy.

Made this for Thanksgiving. They were delicious, easy to make ahead, and re-heatable, without compensating anything. Will definitely keep this one as a go-with for soups and stews for the winter.

These were just terrific! I made them to eat with soup, for supper, and they were inhaled. A few days later I made a double batch for a family Sunday brunch and again they disappeared. The only change I made was to cut them into circles - they look so nice piled in napkin-lined basket.

I made this for an Election Night party. Everyone loved them. I didn't cut them into rectangles though. Somehow they just don't seem like biscuits if they aren't round.

I used half parmasean/half cheddar with the bacon which was wonderful. I brought them still warm from the oven to work...gone in 5 minutes! Don't forget the butter!

Everyone at work loved these! I didn't have fresh sage so I omitted it - and I used parma ham instead of bacon, but the results were great. Try brushing some egg on top before baking to make the biscuits shiny and brown. A co-worker has already asked me for the recipe!
