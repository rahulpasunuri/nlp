This is a scrumptious coffee cake and a great way to use up leftover syrup & bananas from: Buttermilk Pancakes w/ Maple Syrup Apples recipe on this site. I didn't have a 2" deep cake pan so I used my streusel ring pan. First I placed pecans upside down in the bottom, then I distributed the banana slices in the pan, then I spread the syrup over the nuts and bananas. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It was delicious but I would have disliked the recipe if I had used as much topping as listed. I think this recipe would be equally good without the fruit. My only problem was that it was difficult getting the cake out of the non-stick pan. Next time I will spray it with PAM.

The cake part of the recipe was very moist and light, but I really didn't like the topping or bananas at all. I think I'll stick to banana bread!

My new favorite recipe! I made this again (last time I used pears) and made this with the bananas. I forgot to mention that I didn't use the maple syrup last time and I didn't use it this time either. Everything else remained the same. The end result was an absolutely delicious dessert that got rave reviews from our guests! So easy to make too (and pleasing to the eye)! Will definitely have the recipe on hand for future reference!

Love bananas. Love walnuts. Not crazy about maple.... This recipe really IS too sweet. I never thought I could say such a thing... I felt the cavity creeps coming to get me right away... I considered throwing it out, but decided to give it away to a friend who loves maple, maybe they will like it more than I did...I warned them first... Get the toothbrush ready! The cake part was very moist and delicious. Maybe I could use that with a crumb topping I use with other recipes...

Absolutely, hands-down, one of the best desserts I've made (and had) in a long time! I didn't have bananas so I used pears and I didn't have walnuts but had pecans. Followed the rest of the recipe except added a 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. The cake was moist and very easy to make. It looked as good as it tasted. Will make again this weekend. Yum!

Made in bundt pan, reduced volume of topping ingredients by ~25%. Made with whole walnut halves which caramized with the suger & syrup and disguised the cooked bananas. Served after 1 hour cooled with vanilla icecream. Husband was purring!

I was making thiis cake and must have trailed off when I dumped the sugar in with the flour by accident! Lucky me that was the last of the white sugar so I had to use what I had. I beat the butter with an egg and vanilla and a little white sugar from the tea sugar. The consistency was not right but i dumped the flour mixture in anyway. i had to use about a 1/2 c. of milk instead to get the dough more creamy. It smelled delicious the whole baking time and looked great when it came out. I also used pecans and filberts instead of walnuts and didn't use any maple syrup 'cuz i didn't have them on hand. Sounds like a mess but actually came out quite good! If you don't like "sweet", i suggest using less brown sugar. But i like it sweet so it tasted delicious! Even a mistake can end up tasting great :)

This is a terrific alternative to Pineapple Upside Down Cake. It's just as sweet, but the maple twist really sets it off. I could only find green bananas at the grocery, and I'm glad I used them, because the tartness worked well with all the syrup and sugar. Definitely a keeper...and it's pretty enough to serve to guests.

I substituted fresh pecan halves for the walnuts because I had them on hand. Wonderful recipe. Not too sweet; excellent served warm with ice cream. Definitely will make again.

This is like a cake version of Bananas Foster. I've made it for two large groups and had numerous compliments each time. One odd thing though - I followed the directions exactly both times. The first time the topping was liquidy like the picture, but the second time it was completely set. Either way, it was delicious!

This cake was so overly sweet even though I cut down the topping to 1/2 cup sugar! Also, the amount of sugar and butter in the topping wasn't very appealing after turning the cake upside down. It looked brownish, greasy and muddy and you couldn't see the bananas since there was so much topping. The bananas on the other hand gave a great flavor and the batter was also good. If and when I'll try it next time, I'll use only 1/4 cup sugar and only 1/4 stick for the topping. I will also use firmer bananas as the ripe ones got so mushy.

This is a rich and delicious cake. it's decadent and fancy but definitely comfort food, too . . . . everyone always asks for the recipe. i'm even making it for a friend's wedding!

This recipe has been a huge hit with family and friends. Having no maple syrup on hand, I used a lite pancake syrup and added 1 tsp. maple flavouring. I also reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 c. Get creative with the nuts you use for the topping--so far I've tried walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts. Each has been fabulous! Sprinkling a little unsweetened, shredded coconut over the cake when it's done adds a nice gourmet touch to the simple, yet very elegant dessert.

I've made this cake at a country club in NY and the members absolutely loved it.

I made this recipe in 1996 when it appeared in the magazine and my husband and guests raved over it. I left out the walnuts and served it warm with vanilla ice-cream and a locally bought Amaretto Fudge sauce.

This is a great recipe! My family has made it over and over. Sorry that it didn't turn out well for the NJ cook. We all love it, and I've made it several times for guests who rant and rave.

This is the first time I am going to trash a recipe on this wonderful site. I'd give zero forks on this one. I reduced the sugar for the topping and it still didn't melt. It was so sweet it was inedible. Luckily I made other desserts for my guests.

This was a big hit with my company last night and I was asked by two guests for this recipe. Very easy and delicious.

Very good, I didn't have real maple syrup but had my own home made stuff which I added to the brown sugar and butter instead of pouring on top. Turned out great. Will have to try real maple syrup next time.

I did cut the brown sugar down by 1/2 and I didn't have any maple syrup on hand. But it came out great! I would definately make it again, very good with a little vanilla ice cream.. :)

Very, very sweet! Next time I make it, I plan to cut brown sugar by at least 50%, maybe 75%. There was so much sugar that it didn't melt in the 55 minutes of baking. There was a huge quantity of it left in the cake pan after inverting it.
