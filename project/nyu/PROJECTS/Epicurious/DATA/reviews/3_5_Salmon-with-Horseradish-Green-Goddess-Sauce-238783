To be honest, I didn't expect a lot from this recipe. It exceeded my expectations, though! Very, very easy and tasty. Will do this again.

The sauce was really good. Also a really easy recipe. Quick and easy.

We make this all the time and love it. It's a great cold leftover. We use fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar.

Made this year for a vegetarian seder: thought it fit the theme well with the horseradish. Made the mayonnaise from scratch. Very nice and very easy. Used steelhead trout filets and it worked well.

I was out of everything but mayonnaise and salmon - and the salmon was filleted. So I blended wasabe, soy sauce and capers into the mayo and only cooked it for about 7 minutes. It was fantastic!

We don't like tarragon, so I changed it up by eliminating the tarragon and substituting white wine vinegar. I added an additional 1 tsp of horseradish. It made for a refreshing sauce.

This is a nice way to prepare salmon but the overwhelming flavor is tarragon. Perhaps letting it sit longer would help bring out the other flavors? Otherwise, you really have to like tarragon to enjoy this.

I had no tarragon, and decided to use half avocado, half mayonaise. It was truly excellent, but I will have the tarragon, next time.

Carmelein: I would say that you WOULD be compromising some flavor by using fat free mayo. Try the light mayo, if you must, but the fat free variety will not give the creamy taste and texture this dish deserves.

Can fat free mayo be used without compromising taste?

This recipe was so easy and quick and delicious! It makes more sauce than you need, which I saved for a sandwich spread. Make sure you use fresh tarragon.

This was easy and refreshing. We didn't use as much of the dressing as called for, so in the future, I'd adjust it to make no more than a tablespoon per fillet/steak.
