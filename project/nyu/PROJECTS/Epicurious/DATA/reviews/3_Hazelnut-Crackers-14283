I made these with modifications, (use what your have!), and they are delicious and more-ish. I used brown rice flour to make them gluten-free. I substituted cream cheese for the butter, and added 1 tsp dry mustard powder and 1/2 tsp sweet paprika. Even the burnt ones taste good! I will definitely try these with other nuts and cheese.

True to form I didn't quite follow this. I used almonds since that was what I had on hand. They never quite got to the "nut butter" state. The crackers were great though. They even shipped to Maryland and were just fine!!

Yum -- these crackers are very rich and delicious. I think I didn't knead the dough long enough, so mine came out a bit soft and crumbly. I would definitely make them again, but next time I'll knead more and slice them thinner, so that they're crisper.
