I love this recipe! But I also increase the spices, add the zest and fruit of only one large blood orange, and add vegetables: chopped tomatoes, carrots, turnips, bell peppers, zucchini, and butternut squash. Also add some chickpeas. If it needs more liquid add some tomato juice, and to add bit of a kick, chop up half a habanero pepper. It changes the recipe, but it makes it a bit more savory. Serve it over quinoa. Healthy and delicious!

The lamb was extremely tender. I increased the spices as recommended by other reviewers. Also added a little bit of cumin and coriander.Will make it again.

I too, quadrupled the spices. I thought that the orange flavour was much too prominent though. I would leave out the zest, and just add one well cleaned/supremed orange, or even 2 tangerines as a substitute. I believe the acid in the oranges is responsible for the incredible tenderness of the lamb. I served over Quinoa cooked in a low sodium chicken broth.

This was excellent. I quadrupled the spices like others suggested. The lamb was so tender and flavorful, I will definitely make this again. I was very careful not to leave any membranes or pith on the blood oranges. They really made the taste unique and delicious.

For 1.25 lbs of lamb meat, I doubled the spices (except salt), and also added 1 tsp each of cumin and coriander, and 1/2 tsp of cardamom. ~1 hr before the end of cooking, added in some chopped sweet potato and carrot to make up for the smaller quantity of meat I used. Subbed cilantro for parsley. The lamb was incredibly tender and flavorful, but like other reviewers had complained, the oranges contributed a bitter flavor for me. I was very careful not to zest down to the pith, and I removed all the outside pith/peel plus the white piece running down the center of the orange, but I should've supremed the orange--cutting the individual segments out from the membrane, as the bitterness seemed to be coming from the membranous bits. Despite the bitter aftertaste of my 1st attempt, I will definitely repeat this recipe as the flavor combo is awesome.

Was very happy with this dish! The lamb was amazingly tender, and very tasty. Thanks to other reviewers' advice, I upped the spices considerably (maybe 3 times the recipe), and I was glad I had done so. It would have been bland without it I think. I also went really light on the oranges, and just used 1 tangerine. I thought the orange flavor was really nice, and I would probably try it with two next time. That would give it more of the Moroccan flavor I think. Overall a really good recipe, but DO add more of the spices!

I made this with my leftover Christmas leg of lamb. It was easy, delicious and a big hit with the family. I used 3 naval oranges instead of blood oranges, and also doubled spice coating.

What a waste. The orange overpowers the taste of the lamb.

This is the worst lamb stew I've ever had. The oranges add a very strange flavor. It's not subtle, it's like 'oh, there's and orange in here'. I don't think this is anything special. I regret making this!

I made this last night and can't wait to make it again! I tweeked the recipe also; had only 1lb of lamb. I also upped the spice significantly- i don't know how so little as they have in the recipe could cover as much meat as they call for! More is better. I also added 1lb of button mushrooms, quartered. It gave the stew a lovely earthiness to the broth, not sure how "morroccan" that is but it worked. Also added 1 large carrot. I ended up simmering for about 2.5 hrs also, and the lamb literally melted in our mouths! I used tangerines instead of blood oranges due to availability; the skins were too thin to grate for the zest so i just had the chopped chunks. All in all, as i mentioned before- can't wait to make this again!

I had no idea I could make lamb so tender. This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We used all fresh produce from the local farmers market. I also bought free range grass fed lamb there which is what got me searching for recipes. Because of using all organic local ingredients it cost about $8-10 for each person, but would easily be a $40 meal at any nice restaurant.

This was excellent. Flavors are prefectly balanced. Only thing I did a little different is added a little more garlic, added a few drops of orange oil with the orange rind and oranges (because my orange rind didn't smell very flavorful) and cooked a for an extra 1.5 hours out of necessity (I was going out and had to leave it on the stove...so I also added about 1 cup more water to the liquid to make sure it didn't dry out while I was gone). I used 1/2 a boneless leg of lamb for the meat and served it over orzo. This recipe was so good I'm going to have to start buying leg of lamb regularly now so I can make this more frequently. The kids liked it too.

This is a good body of a recipe. You could amp up the spices a bit and I added some tomato juice to enchance the colour of the broth. I substituted dried apricots for the blood oranges and added chick peas as I didn't buy as much lamb meat. Pomegranite seeds add great garnish. I will make this again, but I will probably make further modifications to make it even better. Glad I tried this recipe.

Fragrant is about all this stew is. I didn't use blood orangees due to availability, but I'm not sure that would change things much for me. Surprised at the lack of cinnamon flavor despite upping the amount. I had high hopes! There are better recipes out there for lamb.

Modified the recipe to do in the slow cooker (reduced water by 1/3 cup) and added the oranges at the end. This turned out wonderful, though I did thicken with a bit of flour and butter, added some dried fruit, and additional seasoning. Will make this agaian.

This was the very first time I cooked lamb after being a vegetarian for 13 years. I was a little nervious about the lamb coming out too tough, especially after reading some of the bad reivews of this recipe. Overall, I found the recipe simple to prepare and follow. Blood oranges weren't due out for a couple of weeks so I substituted that part with a tangerine and cherry cider mixture which I was skeptical of but it ended turning out delicious. I also added twice as much garlic to it. The lamb was perfectly tender and flavorful. It went perfectly with spinach lemon couscous and an Oregon Pinot Noir. Yum!

This recipe doesn't compare to the slow-cooked Moroccan lamb stew recipe on this web site. I grabbed this one by mistake since the names are so close and, after making it for dinner, both my husband and I felt that the other one was much, much better.

Very flavorful dish. I must admit I strayed from the recipe a tad- added OJ and didn't use blood oranges, (used regular), and didn't use the zest either. I marinated the lamb in spices and OJ for a few hours before cooking. The meat was extremely tender and tasty- I'll make it again.

As other reviewers have noted, the lamb in this stew does come out very tender. It is also tasteless. This was one of the worst recipes I have tried in quite some time! I took the suggestions of other reviewers, and used 1 cup orange juice instead of water, and I increased all of the spices in addition to adding coriander and cardamon. This recipe was so bad I don't think it can be salvaged at all. I didn't know it was possible to make lamb taste so bland.

As other reviewers have noted, the lamb in this dish comes out so tender. It was truly delicious. I mixed the water with apple juice (didn't have OJ on hand) and it worked great. Would definitely recommend using some kind of fruit juice. The blood oranges give it a very nice color, mixed with the parsley.

I have to admit that I did not taste this dish, as I don't eat lamb. But guests raved at a dinner party, so I rate this recipe a success. Comments were that lamb was very tender, and that the blood oranges provided a nice subtle taste to the dish. I made it in two steps, up to adding the oranges a day before, and adding the oranges on the day of the party. between these two steps I refrigerated the stew and was able to skim off half the prodigious amounts of fat... I also used more spices than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 3
Very very good! I upped the spices too and added OJ to the water for the base...did not add any orange pieces to it but did add some grated orange rind and I also let it boil gently without the lid for the last 20 minutes to thicken it up. The lamb meat was so tender and flavorful...thanks, Epicurious!

Although this recipe was quite easy to make and the meat (lamb shoulder is the way to go) was tender, the oranges don't add anything to the flavor. In fact, they sort of ruin the taste! Moroccan Lamb Tangine with dates and pearl onions (Bon Appetit 1995) is the much better choice for a recipe of this kind.

Rating: 3
This was an awesome basic recipe, but it needs far more spice than called for. I marinated the lamb overnight in olive oil, orange juice, and lots of spices (cinammon, cumin, corriander, cloves, allspice, chopped garlic), and used OJ with the water as the base for the stew. Would definately make again.

This dish came out excellent. The lamb was so tender, and it went perfect with couscous. We didn't have any blood oranges so we used mandarine oranges and it was wonderful, with absolutely no bitterness. But I have no idea how different it would have tasted with the blood oranges. Adding more spices, I believe, will make it even better. This was a definite crowd pleaser.

Loved these flavors and the fact that the stew was rather easy to make. Have tried this several times. One time I could not get lamb, so I replaced venison. That worked well, too.

While the next time I make this, I will up the spice level a bit, the recipe as a whole was very tasty. However, I would like to comment on the review from Geneva, Fla. You changed half of the recipe and can't cook and it's the RECIPES FAULT? Hmmmmmm.... As I am positive that the reason some people are having trouble with this recipe is the orange peel, let me make sure you all know that NONE of the pith (the white stuff between the orange peel and the fruit inside) should be used. It is extemely bitter. Use only the orange part of the peel when you grate. I too have gotten physically ill from eating food cooked with the pith.

Rating: 3
I agree with the ohters who added more of the spices than the recipe calls for. Cardamom is PERFECT for this dish, and I was generous with black pepper. I also picked up a tip from Graham Kerr, who suggested using lamb neck instead of other cuts. I have never enjoyed lamb until I tried neck, just cut the meat off the bones before browning. Much more tender and less "gamey"! Delicious!

My friend made this recipe and used naval orange peel. All I could taste was the bitter orange flavor. When I returned home, I threw it up. No kidding. Be careful with the orange rind.

I didn't not really like the way this dish turned out. I think one problem was that my orange was a little bitter. If I make it again I'll omit the orange or use a reduced amount if I can find a good sweet orange. It smelled great until I added the orange.

Rating: 3
I really do agree with these prior reviews. I think that there is not enough seasonings to really do justice to the region that this dish comes from. I would, however, add this caveat: exercise caution with the orange zest, a little too much additional and the whole dish can be thrown off. Better to use the additional zest as an accent on the plate. This way, plate presentation is augmented as well as allowing guests the freedom to use it or not.

Great recipe! I was unsure if my husband would like this dish due to the oranges and orange peel, which led me to reduce the amount of peel that I added. My husband really enjoyed this dish and has requested for me to make it for a second time.

Agree with "cook from Austin TX". As it stands recipe merits only 2 forks, but with some minor changes is worthy of 3 or 4. I almost doubled spice quantities, added 2 tbsp fresh chopped mint, couple pinches ground cumin, substituted fresh cilantro for parsley, used medium not large navel oranges, and it turned out great. Served over a good quality French couscous, I'd certainly make this again with those changes in mind.

A wonderful stew indeed! I had to make it again 2 days later, when I noticed a sale on Lamb at the local market. The second time around, I used Cilantro(coriander) instead of parsley, added Chickpeas, and cut down on the orange chunks. (May be that my oranges were a bit large, and I couldn't find Blood Orange). Also, I added the ground seeds from one green cardamom pod, which created an incredibly aromatic stew, and added to the aphrodisiacal nature of the concoction. And I'd been so good about cutting down on my meat intake! :) Ciao!

I'm not sure if this is a traditional Moroccan dish, but it is a favourite in our home. In our area it is difficult to find blood oranges, so we use whatever sweet orange is available. The result looks a bit more like a tradional curry dish, but has a totally unique and delicious taste. This dish goes well with couscous or quinoa, and works well with spiced, grilled squash as well.

Excellent! I 'tested' it on our son who is chef at a private business club and he loved it. We all did. For the purists out there - I substituted navel oranges for blood oranges which were unavailable - and (shame on me) -powdered ginger for the ginger root. I've made it since for company and it can easily be made a day ahead. Everyone (who likes lamb) loves it!

I definitely agree with the previous reviewer. I was quite liberal with the spices and the result was very exciting (quite an aphrodisiac!).

I would not make it again as it is written. It needs WAY more spice, perhaps double what is given in the recipe? The concept is sound, ingredients are on target but it is too tame to be called a true Moroccan dish.

Rating: 4
It works just fine as described, blood or regular oranges, but if you use regular ones make sure they're not too sweet. Coriander and pepper help, as the other reviewer has suggested, but also add a little cardamom. Make it spicy (a little bit more of everything), and serve it over a PLAIN cous-cous with some chick peas thrown in (no need to kill yourself with flavor.) Drink a heady red wine with it (the one that is overwhelming with everything else.) Do it on Saturday, so you can sleep in like a Moroccan bandit on Sunday. Make a lot of it, and keep some for the next day.

This was very tasty. I used a boned leg of lamb, and I used regular oranges.(Blood oranges are only available during the holiday season in my neighborhood.) Also, the first night I actually forgot to add the oranges and honey (yikes!). When I reheated the stew the next night I finished the recipe. what a difference! Also, the meat was even more tender the second night. Served this with plain couscous and the "Morrocan" spiced vegetables (misspelled on this website)which were fabulous.

How does it taste? It tastes like more! The stew was a big hit with my husband. After working 12 hour days since Sept. 11th as a police officer, it's nice to come home to a plate of hot stew, its wisp of aromatic steam teasing the nostrils into quivering anticipation.

orange peel used properly is not bitter at all. only use the dark orange on the outer peel and be very careful not to include the white part of the peel and you will have a fresh essence of orange that is not bitter at all

Worth some experimentation. Couldn't find blood oranges so used navel. The bitter aftertaste of the orange peel ruined things. I'm guessing the peel of bloods tastes hugely different than navel. Will skip the peel altogether next time.

I prepared this dish for others who were not fan's of lamb and they enjoyed it. The stew was served in a large bowl over a bed of orzo pasta. I substituted tangelos for blood oranges which I could not find and used dried grated orange peel. A recommendation when coating the lamb with the seasonings; mix the seasonings with two tablespoons of olive oil first then add the lamb and toss.
