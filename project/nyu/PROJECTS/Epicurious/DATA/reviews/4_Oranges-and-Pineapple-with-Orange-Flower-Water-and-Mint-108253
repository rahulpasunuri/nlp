This was so light and lovely. I served it with the Sausage, Fontina and Bell Pepper Strata recipe on this website and it was a perfect complement for brunch, without the sorbet. It's one of those recipes you will go back to again and again. So pretty with the colours of the fruit and fresh mint.

So good! Sweet, refreshing, and a nice change of pace. I doubled the cinnamon and cloves. This was the first time I've used orange flower water, and the smell of it worried me as I was making this. But it came out fabulously! I'll definitely make this again.

Really enjoyed this salad, as did my visiting relatives. I happened to have some pomegranate seeds on hand and added those - very pretty.

Easy, tasty, refreshing, and just a bit different. Would make a wonderful buffet dessert dish or brunch fruit salad. I would add a couple more cloves and cinnamon sticks, and break up each sitck into 4 pieces.

what an interesting flavor! really different. i bought the flower water at our farmer's market in the seasoning department (for those who cannot find it). it has a real middle-eastern taste.

Also available at Trader Joe's markets if they are in your area.

This is great. You can get orange blossom water in an middle eastern and/or mediterrean food store. Orange Blossom water is a pretty common ingredient.

I would love to try this recipe, but I can't find orange-flower water anywhere. Any ideas??
