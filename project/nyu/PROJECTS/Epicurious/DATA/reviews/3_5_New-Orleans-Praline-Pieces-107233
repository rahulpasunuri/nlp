Everything seemed to be going well, but as they cooled they got all cloudy and completely fell apart. i tried a bit before i threw it all away, and it had the taste and texture of granular sugar. Can anyone assess what I did wrong? I would love to be able to make praline and brittle.

Well, I'm letting my third attempt cool, and already it looks like it is clouding up and getting gritty. I've done everything to the letter, thermometer and soft-ball test, but I too must be lacking the gene. There must be a trick to getting this right. Maybe I'll keep trying.

This was my first attempt at candy-making. At the suggestion of another member, I read the Joy of Cooking entry on candy-making. The newest edition has great illustrations that are very helpful. I don't have a thermometer, so I just kept dropping balls of syrup into a bowl of water and then eating them. My candy crystalized, but I don't mind because the taste is fantastic. I was craving those lovely pecans from Savannah, and these hit the spot. I'll practice some more to get the texture right.

This was so easy to make! I didn't even have a candy thermometer so I just did a soft ball test and it worked perfectly. I did use dark brown sugar instead of light and it tasted delicious!

Had serious problems with this recipe; apparently, I did not inherit a candy-making gene that is needed. It took forever to get the sugar to melt on low heat (about 30 minutes). I used a new, digital candy thermometer that reads temperature and beeps at soft-ball stage. I very carefully watched the temperature, pulled the syrup off the heat at 236, and did a soft-ball test. Mine looked exactly like a video. After the candy hit 220, I started stirring. Five minutes later it hadn't thickened. Two more minutes and it's still not "creamy" in consistency, but I added the toasted pecans, stirred (it thickened very fast) and poured into a pyrex 8x8 baking dish (I didn't have a 9x9). After the recommended 45 minutes of cooling time, the pralines were not set and were very granular. Great flavor, lousy texture. No idea what I did wrong--NO oil anywhere near, everything was CLEAN. Can't say I found it worth the effort, so not likely to try it again unless someone can explain to me why it didn't work. HELP!

This recipe is wonderful and easy. The pralines are creamy; just like you buy in the French Quarter. I did not put them in a 9 inch square pan; instead I buttered a cookie sheet and dropped them like cookies. Turned out great

This was super easy, just keep a close eye on the candy thermometer and if you are toasting your own pecans, be careful that they don't burn in the oven (doesn't take long). I toasted mine at 350 for about 5 minutes in my toaster oven. I used a little less pecans than called for. I didn't do the soft ball test - just used the thermometer. My batter did not harden up quickly, as someone else mentioned, so I had plenty of time to stir it after turning off the heat and thicken it up. Perfect for Fat Tuesday!!

I made this recipe side by side with Pralines, Gourmet Dec 1991 and forced my co-workers to choose their favorite. Some chose this recipe, but most chose the other recipe...

I made a half batch last night to test whether this might meet turn out nicely enough to give as a christmas gift. These were fine, except that I think I disagree with the instructions to stir for 1-2 mins after the candy cools to 220 degrees. I did this, addded the pecans, gave them about half a stir and voila--the candy hardened. I was able to get the bulk of it into the buttered dish, but not scrape the pan as the recipe indicated. I plan to make this again without the excess stirring. Oh, and I didn't press the brown sugar through the strainer. Tried, and quickly figured out that doing so would be VERY time consuming and messy.

Terrific candy! Soft enough but not gooey. Follow the recipe precisely. Also a quick read through Joy of Cooking's candy preparation section helps alot. Definitely use a candy thermometer. As long as you pay attention and have everything in front of you, these are easy and delicious.

These treats were so good, they were finished before I could blink.
