I made a few tweaks--I doubled the carrots, substituted red curry powder for cayenne pepper (hey, that's what I had!). I used the zest of an entire lemon, which I did not cut into actual strips, I just grated it. I also sliced the fennel a bit thicker. Anyway, I cooked this on 2-3 for 20-25 minutes, and it was delicious! It became velvety and was perfect with garlic couscous. I am absolutely throwing this into my rotation, even though I'm not a vegetarian. It was just so silky, easy, and the lemon was perfect. Next time, I might add a few golden raisins.

Soooo yummy! My husband and are vegans so it's wonderful to find a yummy vegan recipe that can work as a side dish or as part of the main course. I substituted Hungarian Paprika for the Cayenne and it gave it a much more robust flavor. I feel cayenne can be kind of a shallow flavor. I partnered it with couscous and white raisins and that was delicious. My husband just mixed it all together and loved it!

This is simple, unusual, adds a nice splash of color to the table, and a benefit is you can prepare it a day ahead without having to worry about heating it at the last minute.

It clearly says to cook without simmering for 15-20 minutes. It is plain enough.

Question: What is warm? Seriously, this isn't much of an instruction "...low heat until warm."

A very unique and delightful way to eat carrots (and fennel). As you'd expect, it's quite rich, but easy to prepare. As it's such a simple dish, the cayenne and lemon zest add a nice, and necessary kick.
