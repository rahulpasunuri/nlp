I'll admit to not having made a lot of bok choy in my life, but I really loved this simple recipe. I didn't make any alterations and it was quick and easy...and even my veggie-averse boyfriend raved about it. I paired it with some simple stir-fried flank steak and prep to finish it took about 30 minutes. Definitely a favorite.

Delicious and easy. I added some sausage to it to have more of a complete meal.

This was a very simple and delicious side dish.

I made this with 'regular' bok choy. This was so quick and very tasty without any addition to this recipe. I loved it, but I love bok choy, so I think you have to be one who appreciates the crunch and flavor of bok choy to really enjoy this dish.

STOP RIGHT HERE and go to a different recipe on this site: Braised Baby Bok Choy. It uses only 1 cup broth and then reduces it at the end for a better result- more like a light sauce than a soup! Plus, the addition of sesame oil makes such a difference in the flavor. I make THAT recipe all the time....it's fabulous.

A simple, flavourful recipe. I added some chopped ginger with the garlic and I only have beef stock at hand, but it worked well. Worth repeating.

I made this last night. My first time cooking bok choy.....yummy. Thank you all for the suggestions of grating a little fresh ginger and using only 1 can of chicken stock. I also used a large head of bok choy for 2 people and only a smidgen was left. Oh so delicious. A real keeper. The fragrance throughout the house was as pleasant as you could get.

Simple, yet so good. My grocer only had mature bok choy, so I used that and chopped it on a bias. Served this with the Hoisin and Honey Glazed Pork Chops from this site. Yum.

This was my first attempt at baby bok choy - served it with the Thai-Spice Pork also on this site and it was yummy. I added grated ginger and agree with the other reviews - it has too much liquid. Next time I'll cut down on the broth - or add more bok choy. This one's good!

For a better flavor, add some Hoisin sauce and some real sesame oil, while using only a little chicken stock. For the cook who wanted to know the secret to the wasabi like recipe, it's easy. Add a little Chiu Chow (Chili Oil) with Hoisin and you have it.

The recipe calls for ingredients I usually have on hand. I think you can get by with less chicken broth if need be. Much of it was left in the bottom of the pan.

Once at a restaurant, I had the most amazing baby bok choy with a wasabi flavor. I guessed at how it was made and tried various approaches, but nothing worked out quite right. :-( Does anyone know how to make it?

This was okay. I've made it twice but I don't know if I'll make it a third time. I must say, though, that the aroma is heavenly throughout the house while it is cooking. If you are a bok choy lover, this recipe is for you.

I added a tablespoon of sesame oil and about a teaspoon of chopped ginger. It was my favorite part of the meal, and the vegetable rarely is my favorite.

Delicious! I'll make again and again and...
