Just OK. It was too bland after following the directions, so I added more brown sugar, salt and a generous helping of hot sauce. This helped somewhat but since I have had better bean dishes in the past, I am going to skip making this again.

This was just ok. I was disappointed with the flavor. I would probably make it again only to tweek it and because it is a quick recipe for beans.

This was okay. I was a little disappointed that I could not taste the coffee.

I've made this intermittently over the years and they are well received. Nice change for every now and again.

It's not a good idea to add the canned beans in the beginning and then cook them for 45 minutes. They will become very mushy with less flavour. It's much better to add them 5 minutes before finishing or to use dried beans, add these in the beginning and then cook for one and a half hour. Otherwise okay.

Had it with oven BBQ ribs and cole slaw and it went perfectly. Beans keep there texture.

This is one of my favorite bean recipes. I usually make it when we're having Santa Maria-style Tri Tip and garlic bread. The beans are a great accompaniment, and I've made them quite a few times. It is a great mix of flavors.
