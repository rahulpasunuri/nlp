I liked this dish; the mushrooms tasted really good after being cooked in the sauce and tossed with the pasta. I thought 3 tablespoons of thyme was a bit much for me, so I reduced it significantly.

This was very bland. I tried adding cayenne, but to no avail. The egg noodles overpowered the mushrooms and the garbanzo beans overpowered the entire dish. My husband suggested next time using artichoke hearts, but I won't try this recipe again.

This was a waste of time and ingredients. Sometimes a recipe will pair unexpected foods and the result is great. I was hoping for that here but no. What was the purpose of the garbanzo beans? They didn't taste good with the sauce at all. The dish was bland, the cheese was calories without impact. Two thumbs down, don't waste your morels.
