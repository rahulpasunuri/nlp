Corn bread is different for everyone depending where they live. This is one of those things that I get at Trader Joes. Sweet and really good cornbread. Yes i am a Yankee living in the south.

I must be Yankee, cause this cornbread had a NO GO with the kids... Terrible, no flavour and just crumbled apart. I;ll stick to my old recipe Yankee and all.

I'm Southern born and bred, and you've made this waaaaaaayyyyy too hard.... Stick any ovenproof skillet in 450 degree oven with several T's bacon grease, or if you prefer healthier, 2 T grapeseed oil (it can take the high heat without turning to bad guys for the body)... Let that heat up 'til REALLY hot.... Mix some self-rising WHITE cornmeal - preferably Sunflower brand -(in the "old days" the yellow corn was tough and fed to the animals - the people ate the white tender corn)- I use about 2 cups cornmeal, but NEVER measure... it just comes out right as long as you have a consistency a bit thinner than pancake batter....and that's determined by how much buttermilk you use.... Anyway, you've got your self-rising cornmeal in a bowl, break 2 eggs and throw them in.... then add a big ol' helping of buttermilk and stir, breaking up the eggs... if not enough milk, add more... as I said, it should be consistency of pancake batter or a little thinner.... Then take that hot, hot skillet out of the oven, pour a tad of that hot grease into the batter, leaving some grease in the bottom of the skillet... stir and pour into that hot pan... The edges will begin to "crisp up" immediately as that hot grease hits the thinner edges... Cook 'til lightly golden on top and edges very crisp.... That's it.... That's REAL cornbread... NO FLOUR....

Bleah. Made exactly as directed only to be disappointed by this dry, gritty and tasteless waste of ingredients. I couldn't bring myself to give this even one measly fork. I learned from this recipe that I prefer a cornmeal-to-flour ratio that is about 50-50. Had much better luck with another Epicurous recipe for Buttermilk Cornbread (it's the one that was published in Bon Appetite in Nov 1999).

This is my "go to" recipe for corn bread. It is not sweet - very traditional. I do not use the cast iron skillet (since I don't have one that size) and it still comes out great.

Blech. I made this corn bread exactly as the recipe, right down to the cast-iron skillet (using mostly butter, some bacon fat), after my box mix cornbread muffins seemed as hard as rocks. The verdict from the table? Yuk! Too gritty, no flavor. I thought the latter was untrue; they DID taste like corn. But nothing else; no savory mouth-feel, no "Yum!", as dry as heck. Like eating corn-flavored sandpaper, or the world's crumbliest tortilla. Everyone instead ate the dense "just-add-water" boxed muffin-rocks, which were at least tasty and surprisingly moist compared to this recipe. Won't make again.

Thank you so much for this truly Southern cornbread. Tastes like home. Easy and so good and crispy crust.

I am Alabaman, born and raised and we never put flour in our corn bread, but if you want it in yours, go ahead. Mine is all corn meal.
