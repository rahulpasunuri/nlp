Versions of this have been a family favorite of ours for 30 plus years -- we usually use whole wheat bread (cinn/raisin is great) -- make it fancy by doing a grilled version with a little turbinado sugar. Put a little butter or oil in the pan and sprinkle turbinado in for a carmel effect. For basic sandwich just toast bread and then spread with pb, raisins and banana. These are great --perfect for breakfast.

Is ours the only school that will allow no nuts or nut products of any kind? I'm surprized so many of these recipes use peanut butter.....

I've been making something close to these for about a year. Instead of dates, though, I use raisins. The same mixture is also good on wraps!

I have been using this website for recipes for three years now and have gotten excellent recipes off of it but this one is a real loser!! It was totally unappealling in its presentation and the flavor was mediocre at best. I made a dozen of them and not one of them was touched. I was embarrassed to serve them, truly a DOG

This is a 'lick-your-fingers' delicious lunch. After spooning the peanut butter into the pita, nuke it for about five seconds in the microwave for easier spreading. I also went for one whole tablespoon of honey. Easy, quick, and economical (college student)!

These are so good. I made them for my lunch, but I skipped the dates. Otherwise, they are perfect for my lunch-box!

I have not made this, but am going to try it this way: Mix the dates, pb and honey together and spread in an untoasted pita. Toast the pita, making sure you leave the pita open a bit. The pb mixture will melt and be nice and warm and smooth. When lightly toasted, add the banana slices. Mmmm. I think I will add a little cinnamon to the pb mixture, too. Gotta go, I'm getting hungry!

Surprise #1: That Bon Appetit would include a recipe like this. Surprise #2: That I decided, on a whim, to try this recipe. Surprise #3: That I felt compelled to review a recipe like this. Surprise #4: That I actually find myself suggesting "techniques" for making a peanut butter sandwich. Here we go: Classic comfort food -- and it works :) One, if you don't toast the pita breads, it can be very difficult to spread on the peanut butter without ripping the bread. Two, have you ever tried spreading peanut butter, sprinkling on chopped dates, and drizzling honey on top of the dates inside a pita pocket? Quite challenging. Alternatively, you could split each half-pocket into two flat pieces (or just use regular bread...) Three, have you ever tried putting banana slices between two separate pieces of bread with nothing for the banana to stick to? They will fall out. (That's what the pita pockets were meant for!) So next time, I will either be very careful spreading on the peanut butter and adding dates and honey... or I will split the pita pockets into two flat pieces and spread sufficient peanut butter on both slices, pressing (not-too-big) banana slices on one and chopped dates on the other. And you thought this was a simplistic, pointless recipe!
