We fix this every year for Christmas, and it is wonderful! We did like another reviewer suggested and added Swiss cheese to the polenta. Also, we add some carrots and celery to the pot, and to make the sauce a little thicker, we puree most of it at the end with an immersion blender (after we take the rabbit out first). We look forward to and enjoy this year after year.

This is an excellent way to do rabbit. I did add a tbs of cornstarach to the au jus to thicken it up (mixed up with 1/4 cup cold water first of course), I baked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour. I also cut up a carrot and parsnip amd added it to the rabbit while cooking. I made noodles instead of the polenta with brown sage butter but plain noodles would have been enough.

This was good.I wanted to try it, its similer to my Italian moms recipe, Stewed rabbit with polenta. She used tomato sauce instead of broth and wine. Im partial to it my mommas way. Her mom made it with the rabbits they raised.

We made this recipe with these five changes in order to make it more flavorful: 1)Most important, we excluded the chicken broth, which dilutes the sauce too much and leeches flavor from the rabbit. 2)We brined the rabbit for 24 hours, which adds moisture to the meat. 3)We used two onions, five cloves of garlic, one large carrot (added with onions), leaves from six sprigs of thyme instead of rosemary and six large shitake mushrooms (added with garlic and thyme). 4)We cooked it in a dutch oven and transferred it to the oven (when we added back the rabbit and the red wine) at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. 5)We agreed with other comments and used chicken broth to make the polenta. Finally, we explained to the kids that it was a hare (true), so there was no real concern about eating bugs bunny. Everyone loved it and sucked up every bite and drop of sauce!

I had never eaten tame rabbit(only wild) and when my hubby's co-worker gave him a fresh one I was unsure how to cook it. I knew Italians eat a lot of rabbit, so I chose this recipe. I followed the recipe except for adding celery, carrots, mushrooms and more garlic. I also made my polenta with chicken stock instead of water. I thought the sauce with the polenta was awesome and the rabbit was tender and tasty. If you want to feed four hungry adults, I would recommend 2 rabbits. The sauce was plentiful, however.

I doubled the garlic and added black pepper, but still thought that the sauce could use more flavor. Next time I'll add carrots and celery, maybe some juniper berries. I took one of the other reviewer's suggestions, serving grits in place of polenta, and added fresh sage, butter and shredded swiss cheese to the grits. Turned out great! We often order rabbit when it's on the menu, and my family loved the novelty of having rabbit at home.

Delicious! Nothing to add, nothing to change. Here is a variation for the polenta: cook precooked polenta in 3 1/2 volume salted water or chicken broth. It will take approx. 7 minutes. Then add 2 cloves chopped garlic, 3/4C grated swiss cheese, 2T butter and the sage. Serve with the rabbit. Enjoy!

This is excellent. Far more flavourful than the rabbit with mustard sauce. I added the sage to the sauce. I also strained the sauce.

This was great. Easy to make. I removed the rabbit after it cooked an hour and reduced the sauce until it was thick. The sauce was superb the rabbit was tender and juicy. I used bought polenta - sliced and fried in olive oil with sage leaves. The leaves got nice and crispy and added good flavor to the polenta.

Skip the polenta and pair this with the recipe for creamy grits. Also, I added the sage to the sauce like another cook suggested and used rabbit tenderloin as that was what I had on hand. No one could get enough of it. This is one of my all time favorites.

This was really good. However, like any serious Italian housewife would do, I also put into the pot some finely chopped celery, carrots, leaks and fresh herbs that I had in my fridge. When I removed the rabbit, I boiled down the sauce and strained it, then returned the rabbit to the pot. Delicious. Oh, I put the sage in the sauce rather than in the polenta.

Forget the polenta and just make the rabbit -- it's excellent. Good combination of flavors, juicy meat and great sauce.

the instructions are marginal at the best... this is a common dish in Friuli and we add bay leaves, junniper berries and a mirepoix to the rabbit and marinate it for at least 4 hours in red wine.

This is a great meal. I've also prepared it with veal when I was not able to find suitable rabbit. Works great as a substitute! The text on the prep of the polenta can be a bit confusing. I've found that once the water has boiled, it is best to turn off the heat while wisking in the corn meal. Because the water is not rolling the meal always stirs in smoothly with no lumps. Once the meal is whisked in simply turn the heat back on very low and only occaisional stirring is necessary.

Where's the sage in the polenta?

when you make the ploenta, make a very rich vegetable stock, then use this water to make your polenta. Then make quenelles with the polenta and then char grill them for an alternative taste and texture
