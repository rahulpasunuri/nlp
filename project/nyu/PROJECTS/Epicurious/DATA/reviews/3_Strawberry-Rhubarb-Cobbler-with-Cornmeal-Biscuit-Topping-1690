I made changes as per reviews - cornstarch (1tbs) in fruit 375 oven. Started fruit for 10 min in oven, then with topping 30 more. Plus, used yogurt instead of buttermilk. Served with whipped cream. It was great.

The first time I made this, I used a large, square metal pan instead of the 10" pie pan because I felt it was too crowded in that pan. The cobbler turned out FANTASTIC! Baked 25 min., and it came out perfect- just slightly browned evenly. I made it again tonight in the 10" pan with about 1/3 less fruit. Cooked 15 min. uncovered, saw the top was browning fast and the middle was gooey, so I covered it with foil for the last 10 min. and it came out perfect again. I will definitely use this recipe with other fruits in the future. My boyfriend loves it, especially the cornmeal topping!

This was DISGUSTING! THe filling was mushy with no rhubarb flavor and the topping was tasteless, sickly sweet and had a horrible texture. Worst dessert I've ever made. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Very good. I used blueberries instead of rhubarb. The fruit sauce thickened nicely. The topping is crunchy which is expected with cornmeal.

As written, the recipe is not good enough to waste your time or ingredients on. Filling did not set up, underside of crust is unccoked and runny. Epicurious really should rework this recipe.

After following the advice of several other reviewers, I added cornstarch to the fruit mixture and increased the baking time to 40 minutes. It still turned out gloopy. The fruit didn't set up and the biscuit topping was slightly undercooked underneath even though the top was perfectly browned. The flavor was good if you could get past the runny-ness. This recipe needs work.

This has a really strong clove flavor, which doesn't really go with the strawberry and rhubarb. The crusty part is grainy from the cornmeal but not in a good way. A much better recipe with cornmeal in the cake is the cherry upside-down cake.

This was really easy and tasted terrific. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect. The crust is outstanding! I was thinking how good the recipe would also be with a peach/blackberry combo (yumm!) And all this without ever have cooked with Rhubarb!

Wow! SO GOOD!! Based on the other reviews, I baked at 375 for 30 minutes and it came out great. I also used yogurt instead of buttermilk for the topping, because that's all I had around. This is my new favorite recipe. I am going to stock up on rhubarb this week and keep it frozen so I can make this yummy dessert all summer long.

After reading the reviews, I thinly sliced the rhubarb and put it in hot water (almost to a boil) whie I cut up the strawberries so it wouldn't end up crunchy. Instead, it turned mushy. But I didn't mind that. I didn't have cloves so I used cinnamon and nutmeg- delicious! Also, I added a cup of mixed berries when I came up a cup short on strawberries. Still yummy. The topping though....WOW! I'm gonna try it on other cobbles!! So easy, yet yummy. I did use rice milk with a splash of lemon juice in leiu of buttermilk since my family doesn't drink regular milk.

Good but not great. I like my rhubarb melty, and the topping cooked/browned way before the fruit. Also a little too sweet. But overall, pretty tasty.

Gluten free version: I used 2 pints smaller field strawberries and about 2 1/2 c rhubarb. I used a 9 X 13" glass pan instead of a pie pan, since others had complained of bubbling over and since I added the extra rhubarb. For the flour in the filling, I subbed an egg yolk instead to make the liquid thicken a bit. For the 1 c flour in the topping, I subbed 1/3 c brown rice flour, 1/3 c potato flour, and 1/3 masa harina (corn flour). I added 1 teaspon xantham gum. I subbed 1/3 cup corn flour for the 1/3 c corn meal called for in the recipe as well. I subbed 2/3 cup plain yogurt for the milk. I used less sugar than called for in the filling, about 1/3 cup. I prepared the filling first and cooked it in the pan at 375 while I prepared the topping, about ten minutes. When the topping was ready, I removed the pan from the oven andI reduced the heat to 350 while I sprinkled on the topping. I made sure to keep the topping thin and spread even (easier to do this in a pan instead of a smaller pie dish). I cooked for 25 minutes, no foil tent, perfectly browned, nice soft rhubarb. Super delicious!

A nice old-fashioned recipe. This recipe can be prepped very quickly, and will please just about everyone.

A delicious way to use rhubarb and strawberries in season. I used about 2/3 c. plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk and pulsed the topping ingredients in a food processor. As previous posters suggested, I baked it at 375 for about 35 minutes, which was probably 5 minutes too long (crust got just a little browner than perfect). I used an 11 in. pie plate, so everything was in a pretty shallow layer (both fruit and topping). It turned out great, and got rave reviews from my friends, even the one who doesn't usually like dessert. Vanilla ice cream is a must.

This recipe is great, with a few tweaks. My first foray proved to be undercooked but following others advice, I went with a 375 degree oven and longer time on the second go around. This proved to be much better. I too prefer the natural flavors of strawberries and don't add as much sugar or spice.

This is so tasty! Next time I will try baking it longer at 375. Mine came out a bit undercooked (the topping) and got watery after sitting. but it was so delicious!

I have made this so many times and, now, with a few changes love it. So easy and so good for several days. My changes are that I add no spices to it - I love just the taste of the fruit. I add slightly less sugar to the fruit because I like it slightly tart. I almost always add a bit more buttermilk to the flour - about 2 T to get the right consistancy. The biggest change is baking it at 375 for about 45 minutes. I probably do cut the rhubarb in slices closer to 1/4 inch - never have a problem with that being crunchy. I so love this recipe and have given it to more people than I can count. A spring / summer staple. I will never make a s/ r pie again.

The only change I made was that I cut the rhubarb fairly thin. It was still slightly crunchy. I would probably try cooking the rhubarb next time as one other cook recommended. Other than that, I would not change a thing. If you're looking for a low fat recipe that tastes rich, this will work well.

After reading some of the other reviewer's notes, I decided to reduce the rhubarb a little in a small saucepan for a few minutes while I chopped the strawberries--It helped to give it a jump-start on the longer cooking time for the rhubarb and gave it a nice consistency. I also adeded a tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling to thicken it up a bit and used aluminum foil over the top while I cooked it an extra 10 minutes--It was a big hit!

This was so good, and so easy, that I'll never make a strawberry-rhubarb pie again! I threw a dash of cinnamon in with the berries - I didn't have enough fresh strawberries so I used 1/2 fresh and 1/2 frozen. I also accidentally put the baking powder and soda in the dry mix for the berries, and had to scoop out what I could and put it in the cobbler mix. And it still came out great!

Hmm... I pureed fresh rhubarb in the food processor b/c I'd read a few reviews that said it didn't cook through when cut as recommended. Used nearly twice as much cloves in the filling but didn't really taste 'em... I also added a bag (12 oz) of frozen raspberries from Trader Joe's. I would suggest that if you plan to use frozen fruits you make sure they are thawed beforehand - the cornmeal topping didn't cook all the way through in nearly 45 minutes of baking. I will make this again - it has a lot of potential - but it didn't work out "3 forks" worth for me this time.

This was delicious!! I saw a review that said the top burned, so I put a piece of foil on top(tented)the last 10 minutes. The rhubarb was slightly crisp, so I will cut it smaller next time, or cook it longer. The clove and cornmeal gave this a remarkable flavor. Yummm. My husband loved it too!

We were unimpressed and I won't be making this again. I sliced the fresh rhubarb thinner than specified and cooked it the suggested 30 minutes. The rhubarb was still undercooked and the topping was dark brown with a hint of burnt flavor. The topping didn't seem to be done on the underside though.

As I am Italian, I had never heard of "cobblers". After making an apricot cobbler from this same site last week and this one today, I can only say that I am speechless. What a fabulous dessert cobblers make! I shall be making them over and over again, to put all the wonderful produce from my orchard to the best possible use, short of eating them straight from the tree. For this recipe I have used fresh rhubarb and only replaced butter with a non-hydrogenated fat margarine. Thank you Epicurious for broadening my horizon.

I liked this cobbler but family members didn't like the cornmeal topping. Also, I couldn't find frozen rhubarb so I used fresh, and needless to say, it wasn't cooked enough.

Second time I make this recipe and it's a complete flop. First of all, I had a 9 inch pie plate and it caused a sugary overflow that smoked the whole kitchen (put a tray under). Secondly, the rhubarb and strawberries were swimming in a massive pool of liquid when I cut the cobbler (needed more flour in the filling mixture). Thirdly, the cobbler did not bake closest to the fruit (because of all the liquid). It was a wet sloppy sponge that I threw out and could only keep the outer edge (I replaced flour for the cornmeal but do not think that is the reason). If you make this, good luck!

Rating: 3
Very good, very fresh, very easy. My only complaint would be that the cornmeal topping seemed a little gritty. I think I'll use a finer-grain cornmeal next time.

This was great, and really easy! I baked it for 30 minutes, and served it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream. I would definitely recommend it, especially the cornmeal biscuit topping, since people kept stealing more of that to put on their fruit.

Delicous. Makes a surprising amount of biscuity topping. I live reasonably close to a peach orchard, and substituted three ripe peeled peaches for the strawberries in this recipe. Rhubarb and peaches is a winner. I also exchanged the ground cloves for cinnamon, and it came out beautifully. Totally agree that vanilla ice cream is essential.

In the end, this turned out very well. I had put it in too small of a dish and the top browned sooner than the inside baked. But after cooking for a bit longer at a lower heat, it turned out perfectly. So, I would recommend a slightly lower temp to begin with. The flavor was very nice though - not too sweet (love the rhubarb flavor!!) A little bit of vanilla ice cream would be a great touch. Worth making again for sure!

Mine took an hour and a half before the filling got bubbly and cooked! And I used a 400 degree convection oven. Still I coverd it after 25 minutes to get it from getting too brown and it was a big hit with all our family with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. Next time I might bake for 30 minutes without toppping and then add topping for last 25 minutes. Anyone have any other ideas on this?

I used 1 pint strawberries and twice the rhubarb for a delicious dessert. I also substituted ginger for the cloves, since a guest was allergic to clove and ginger is wonderful with rhubarb. Yumm!

Delicious! My daughter made this twice and our family loves it. The recommended cooking time is too short. We bake it for about 30 minutes..to prevent the topping from browning use a foli tent.

My husband loves this. I added about 1/3 cup of sugar and increased the amount of rhubarb. Be careful to spread the crust thin (I used my hands) or else the middle will not cook. It still takes about 30 minutes.

I was very dissapointed that this recipe did not bake in the recommended time (25 min). The top looked done, but when I served it had noticed that the under part of the crust was gooey. The fruit seemed very pastey as well. Needless to say, I did not serve it. I did, however, sample a bit of the cooked portion and thought that it had a nice flavour and will attempt to make it at a later date.

Quite good. I did notice it took the biscuit in the middle a LOT longer to cook than the rest, but it came out very tasty.

Rating: 4
This was a favorite among all members of the family... even those who don't like rhubarb much. The first time I made it, I accidentally used semolina flour instead of cornmeal (what the heck, they're both yellow!), and I liked it a little better that way. It still had a crunchy texture but was a little more like a biscuit.

Rating: 4
Have made this three times and love it. Very easy and everyone raves. I omit the cloves (I think even a little bit overwhelms it) and cut the sugar in the fruit to 1/3 cup. Also, it's great to make ahead and put in the oven while you are having dinner.

If you like cornmeal and rhubarb you will love this recipe. The cloves in the filling makes an unusual but delicious compliment to the strawberries and rhubarb. And those delicious cornmeal biscuits for the topping truly TOP it off.
