This is my go-to scone recipe. Not too sweet; nice flavor and texture. Sometimes use plain yogurt instead of buttermilk since we often don't have milk. Also good with lemon zest and dried wild blueberries. The raw sugar gives a nice sweet crunch to every bite. I usually make a half-batch but will try that idea of freezing extras.

This is a cakey scone, if you like that sort of thing. I prefer a drier, biscuit texture. I sub out the currants with chopped raisins.

Excellent! I also used 1 teas. orange oil and the currants, I maserated in sherry wine, so they would plump. I also rolled them out, and cut them in rectangular squares. They were really better. (I have made these a number of times.) My husband said, This time they were the best!

Very orangey flavor. Turned out perfect. I substituted vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk with no problems.

Excellent scone! I made a couple of changes per other review comments. Doubled the sugar from 3 tablespoons to 6 tablespoons. Used one cup sour cream & 1/3 cup of heavy cream. Did add white chocolate chips on top with turbinado sugar. Used 1 teaspoon orange oil instead of orange zest. Also, added some chopped dried apricots.

This recipe makes a delightful scone. Quite easy too. We cut back on the butter by about 1/2 a cup and the scones were just fine, very tender. A keeper.

Delicious, tender scones--received rave reviews from both family and colleagues. I made a half recipe for 13 nice-sized scones. I used an ice-cream disher/scoop to portion out the dough quickly and evenly. These are real scones and bear no resemblence to those triangular bricks one can order in national coffee chain stores. I highly recommend.

I found this recipe to be standard in terms of how easy it was the visual result, however I have to say that despite a medium to heavy texture they were really buttery. I prefer scones where the fruit really comes through and these guys just didn't do it for me.

great recipe thank you very much, these are perfect right out the oven, and go well with homemade marmalade, or any other type. Again, good one!

I had lost my recipe for these drop scones and now that I've found it, I need to rate it and say just how great I think these are! I have made them multiple times. They are wonderful for Christmas morning or when company comes in town. I'm not a fan of rolling out dough so this is great! The turbinado sugar makes a great glistening topping. If you want to make them extra- special, add some white chocolate chips-- very good.

An instant hit! We love currants, so these are a perfect breakfast item. I made 1/3-cup size scones, baked 20 minutes, and froze the extras for subsequent meals. They retain their texture admirably when re-warmed slightly in a 250-degree oven.

These were okay, but not great. The orange flavor was nice, combined with the currants. But overall, they were not particularly interesting. I wouldn't make these again...

Delicious. I think next time I'll add a bit more sugar (I would have liked a slightly sweeter scone). These are great with some orange marmalade spread on them (really brings out the orange flavor).

Have made this recipe a couple of times (have used currants or crasins) and it has always been a hit. When I make it last minute and have no oranges, I've substituted orange juice. The orange flavor becomes more subtle, but it works fine.

Made half a recipe, and shaped into a disk instead of single scones. They came out good, I just had to bake them a little longer. They were moist and tender, but somehow I didn't care for them all that much. A little on the 'heavy' and too rich side for my personal preference.

This was my first attempt at scone-making. Luckily for me, the recipe was as easy as it was delicious. Took the advice of other comments and made into wedges. Will definitely be making these again.

Made it twice in the past 3 months. This time I substituted Craisins (dried cranberries) for currants which was fine. I like the triangular scone shape so I generally have been heaping this recipe into two flattened disks, chilling in the fridge and then cutting into 6 scones per disk.

An excellent scone recipe I've used now for several "high teas"; everyone loved them. Not overly buttery, and great with jam.

I had to subsitute whole wheat flour, and fat free buttermilk and these still came out tasting delicious. Next time I'll add some orange extract to enhace the otherwise subtle orange flavor. Easy, delicious scones.

The best scones I've ever had, and I always get great reviews when I make them. Craisins were a great idea, and I substituted orange extract for the zest for added flavor.

These scones had a pleasant hint of sweetness. The raw sugar on top definately makes this scone tasty. I will absolutely make these again - very good tasting!

Made this recipe as part of a brunch menu -- they were fantastic! Kids loved them, too. It was the first time I made scones, but the recipe is quite easy, almost foolproof. Didn't use the standing mixer, cut the butter in by hand, which worked fine. I made the scones slightly smaller (1/3 c. dough per scone) and got 14 out of the recipe. Will definitely make again.

The first time I ever made scones, I used this recipe. People loved them and asked where I had bought them! I add a few teaspoons of orange juice and like the extra orange flavor. These will definitely be a hit, and they are easy to make. Enjoy.

This is wonderful, it is easy and fast to make, and the tangerines give these scones a wonderful taste and smell. This was my first attempt, and then my second, at making scones. They were perfect, whenther served right away or frozen.

These were very good; I thought they needed stronger orange flavor; I'd add more rind next time, and maybe a touch of orange oil. The natural sugar cyrstals on top were a good touch.

Loved this recipe and so did my guests! Took them home with them. Will definetly make again. Needed to bake a little longer and would probably make a little smaller.

Just finished making these & my husband & I have eaten 2 each already. I had dried apricots in the pantry so I used those chopped. I am very impressed with this recipe and think using my KitchenAid is part of the reason they are so light. I always overbeat when I do things by hand. This is a keeper!

Delicious. Like everyone else, I found the specified baking time to be too short, and the size of the scones to be too large. Also, mixing with a machine doesn't seem to work well. The following changes worked great: rubbed the butter into the flour with my fingertips, produced twice as many scones but half the size, decreased the temperature to 325F, and increased baking time to 30 mins.

The scones were great! I used dried cranberries in place of currants. I also made a glaze with OJ, water, and sugar boiled on the stove to thicken-Fantastic!!!!

Overall this was a very easy recipe that is sure to impress everyone! I substituted cranberries for the currants as well in this recipe and they were wonderful! I will probably make them smaller next time for more yield. I baked mine for nearly twice the time listed, but it depends on your oven. Finally, I would probably add more zest and berries or sugar for more sweetness.

WhoooooWeeeeeee. These are absolutely delicious! I'm enjoying one right now! Tender, flaky. Mmmmmm... I used cranberries instead of currants and went for 5 T. of sugar. Mine also took longer than 20 minutes to (and I have a freestanding thermoter in my oven, so I know the temp was correct).

Hit of the office... baked just right.. not too dry! I was a little worried when I mixed in the butter that they would be too dry but they turned out just right! Be sure to brush on a little cream and sprinkle with sugar..

I've made this recipe twice and absolutely love these scones. I haven't been able to find dried currants so I've played with the ingredients a little. The first time, I used raisins instead and the second time I used sweetened dried cranberries. I also added slivered almonds. I highly recommend this recipe.

These are wonderful. I have made them many times. Definitely knead and roll them for better texture. I also added extra butter and orange peel the first time and they were beautiful. Too bad the White Dog is no longer with us!

These were excellent. I did increase the sugar to 5 T. and used raisins instead of currants. I found the batter too thick to drop so I kneaded lightly, and used a biscuit cutter. I found that I had to cook longer than stated. I also brushed with additional buttermilk and sprinkled with sugar. I will definitely make again but I think I will make them smaller and have 24 instead of 12 because they were so large.

Tasted great but I like a denser scone--as written you get a crumbly, more delicate textured scone. I would roll it out and cut it into pieces the next time around as suggested by the Warrenton cook. Brush it with a little buttermilk and sprinkle with the sugar before baking.

Rating: 4
Everyone really enjoyed these. I kneaded lightly and then rolled and cut with 2 inch cutter. I substituted chopped dried apricots for the currants. Very fresh and colorful. Yummy combination. I think this combination of the orange and apricots is most wonderful and a "new flavor" for the scone lovers.

Received compliments and requests for more. In the second batch I omitted the raw sugar topping, although originally I had replaced it with piloncillo anyway, and instead of dropping I pressed and cut shapes, which produced a greater quantity of smaller cakes. This was even better according to my usual GP's...
