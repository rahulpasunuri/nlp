I didn't add the egg but that would not make the difference between a flavorful dish and bland. Definitely needs more flavor.

An alternative adjustment: Add approximately 1/4 cup of instant mashed potato flakes to reduce moisture in mixture.

The adjustment is to roll the cakes before frying in either bread crumbs or additional flour...

That is a qualified "Yes, I would make this dish again."... Like the previous review, I thought these had good flavor, but did not hold up when trying to saute and turn. Definitely needs adjustments..... KIMBER

Very tasty, but so soft that they didn't hold their shape. So I'll have to try again and make some adjustments
