Whether you're hankering for a calorie-laden midnight snack or having a brunch to beat the band, try topping Brioche French Toast with these delectable honey-kissed apricots, topped with a dollop of mascarpone, sweetened with the poaching syrup & spiced with a dash of cinnamon and cardamom. However & whenever you sup on these sweets, they are delicious & great to have on hand.

Perfect ending to my annual backyard pool and barbecue party. Served it with a toffee buttermilk pound cake and a dollop of amaretto flavored whipped cream.

I spooned these poached apricots over a small sweet shortbread biscut and a big spoonful of plain lowfat yogurt. I served it in rustic hand made pottery bowls. It's a fabulous lower-fat alternative to serving on ice cream and is a surefire comfort food winner.

Simple and delicious. I had a bag full of apricots to use up, and this did the trick! I served the apricots with a dollop of mascarpone cheese.

Lovely, simple, perfect over ice cream and equally good with peaches.
