To me, the perfect curry turkey salad recipe, as it gets the core flavor just right. Other than halving the amount I made, I pretty much stuck to the recipe as directed. My only substitution was for the mango chutney (didn't have any), so used a scant 2T of Lemon-Pear preserves instead. I also forgot the cashews when serving, but nobody missed them one bit!

Wow! This is completely amazing. I followed the recipe as written and used a spicy mango chutney from my local asian market. Incredible! Way better than the version at Whole Foods!

Cooked a turkey breast on the grill and had a lot left over. Was hesitant about making turkey salad because I usually do not care for it but saw all the wonderful reviews and decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did. This was so flavorful and moist. Followed recipe except used cranberries instead of raisins. Delicious. Served in a pita with lettuce. Even better the next day.

This recipe is delicious. I used a roasted chicken instead of the turkey, and I substituted fresh green grapes for the raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I took it to a picnic and everyone raved about it!

Fantastic! Served as part of a small reception on cocktail-sized croissants. Used smoked turkey and dried cranberries. Served on the croissants with a small piece of leaf lettuce. Beautiful presentation. Will be using this recipe again and again.

What a terrific way to use leftover turkey -- I may even make turkey breasts just to make this in the future. I also cut out 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and it was perfectly fine. Very tasty. Can't wait until lunch tomorrow.

This is one of those killer recipes that lends itself to infinite re- invention by the cook. The base recipe is terrific but I usually use deli smoked turkey cut into chunks and replace half the mayo w/greek yoghurt to add tang and use dried cranberries instead of raisins. Use fresh spices and toast those cashews for best results and get ready for the WOW's...

Wonderful, flexible recipe, and a great use of left-over turkey. I only used half of the mayo and found it to be just fine.

This was a fantastic use for the left over Thanksgiving turkey. My family loved it so much I had to make it 2 days in a row. I didn't have cashews, but slivered almonds worked out just fine. I also lightened it up by substituting half of the mayo with low-fat sour cream. A definite keeper!

perfect light curry taste. great crunchy texture from the nuts and celery with the chewy chicken and raisins. made my own chutney with mangoes from a jar, salt, sugar, and a dash of vinegar. did not cook that. I will make this as often as possible.

I used this recipe after Thanksgiving last year, but for some reason didn't review it then and forgot how delicious it was. I just made a different curry chicken salad that didn't hold a candle to this. I'm going back to this as my standard for curry chicken or turkey salad.

I used grilled chicken breasts from Whole Foods and added extra Mango Chutney then placed the salad on a bed of lettuce. Yum!!!

This was easy and delicious. I made it for a smart picnic with boneless chicken breasts, which I served one to a plate, sliced on the diagonal and napped with the sauce. It was a loveely presentation and a big success.

This is BY FAR the best turkey / chicken salad I've ever eaten or made. I've made it many times and have passed along the recipe to everyone who's tasted it.

This was fabulous. I didn't have lemon juice so I used champagne vinegar and cooked boneless leg of lamb (which we had last week and which was purchased at Trader Joe's). This was excellent and could maybe use a little spicing up. We will be trying it with shrimp, scallops, chicken as well as turkey. It worked great with the lamb.

I've been looking for a recipe like this ever since I fell in love w/ Whole Foods turkey curry salad. I roasted a small chicken and used it instead of the turkey. I also took everyone's suggestions and added dried cranberrys. I also added some raisins and figs (as they do at Whole Foods). Reduced fat mayo worked perfectly. It came out amazingly good! Easy and impressive. I'll definitely make it again, but will just use a splash of the white wine next time.

This is the second time I've made this dish, and it really is wonderful. This time I omitted the raisins and it was still good.

I am just about to make this again to take to a picnic. It is appetizing to look at and positively addicting! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and replaced half the mayo with yogurt for extra tang. Also used thick, deli turkey as time saver. This is a winner!!!

Very tasty. Served it on a bed of greens for dinner. The next day we made sandwiches with it--kept the cashews separate so they wouldn't get soft.

This is one of my favorite recipes for using up leftover turkey or chicken. I don't add the celery or nuts (boyfriend doesn't like crunchy stuff in his), but it is still fabulous. I've left out the wine before with little change to the flavor. A day or two in the fridge only heightens the flavor of this dish.

Wonderful! I used only 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of curry and added some apples. Wonderful..even the guests who claimed not to like curry tried it and were suitably impressed.

I used less mayo, less curry, more chutney and more lemon juice. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins, added some rice I had left over, and served it with slices of Fuji apple. Pretty great! Would definitely make it again.

First dish to empty at our weekend party. Tripled the recipe and used chicken instead of turkey. I went a bit easy on the curry, and perhaps could have left a bit more out. Next time I am serving a crowd I think I will bulk out the recipe with a lot of celery and perhaps apples to make it go further.

Rating: 3
Very yummy. I started with 1 tablespoon of curry powder in case I found it too potent. I added a little plain yogurt with the mayo to cut a few fat laden calores. Was a great use of my left over grilled chicken breasts. Will definitely make again.

"Addictive" is how one member of my family described this salad. Delicious and simple to make!

I consider myself a fan of curry in both Thai and Indian styles, but I feel that 2 tablespoons is probably one tablespoon too much for this recipe. Normally I use Penzey's Maharajah Curry Powder, their best, but I used their Sweet Curry for this dish, as I wanted to make a "budget" curried turkey salad. Perhaps it's this particular curry powder, to which I am fairly new, but it is terrifically overpowering. In order to get through the large amount of salad it makes, instead of just throwing it out, I'm going to water it down a little with some coconut milk and some chopped, fresh cilantro--to make it a little bit Thai, in hopes that the curry will moderate into the background. Doubtful. Normally, I'm not negative about the recipes I find here on epicurious.com, but I'm thinking right now that I just wasted a whole turkey breast on this recipe.

I substituted cubed tofu fried in peanut oil for the turkey to make it a vegetarian dish, only used 1 cup of mayonnaise and substituted chopped dried turkish apricots for the raisins; served it on mixed field greens. My vegetarian friends loved it.

OUTSTANDING!! It was the unexpected hit at our Polo Picnic Party. People who claim to not like curry or turkey, loved this! We also served Lobster Salad sandwiches and they went virtually untouched once word got around about the Curried Turkey. Served this in a pita pocket. I will try the cranberry suggestion to help add color. (Its been 5 months since the party and I felt compelled to come back and write this. Please try it!)

This is one of my favorite recipes and I make it again and again to raves. I used chicken breasts I have poached in white wine, leave out the green onions and add green grapes sliced in half. I use half raisins and half dried cranberries which are great for both color and taste. Enjoy!

Hi! I've made this recipe now twice, once with chicken, once with turkey. It didn't make a difference. However, I never add the wine and use lofat mayo. I also use a "sweet" curry instead of hot. I've added shredded carrots and sprouts (white, not alfalfa) for extra veggies and crunch. I also use white seedless raisins. The recipe leaves a lot of room to add whatever veggie you want and its very versatile, for a sandwich, on a bed of lettuce etc etc. My boyfriend (finicky eater) likes it too!

Based on the many glowing reviews below, I made this for a special luncheon to mark the incorporation of a new company. It was every bit as good as I had hoped, and it went really well with champagne! I made it exactly as written (except I used reduced fat Hellman's) one day ahead, but I added the cashews at the last minute. No need to worry about them getting soggy in the leftovers, as there were none! Skinny people who don't like to eat went back for seconds. Next Thanksgiving, I am going to buy a much bigger turkey than I otherwise would need just to make sure that there is plenty left over to make this special dish.

Easy, quick, and delicious. For planning purposes, this recipe mades about 8 cups of turkey salad.

All of the rave reviews are true. The only thing no one mentioned is how incredible the turkey is on it's own. Why have I been buying that compressed block of sawdust when I could do this. It was ridiculously easy and the house smelled wonderful. Cooked it in the morning cooled it and put the whole thing in the fridge till I had time to cube it. By the way this makes a lot more than 6 servings it's more like 10 or 12 (just picture 4 pounds of turkey). I used 1/2 the dressing and 1 turkey breast and the full recipe of everything else because I got tired of cubing.

This was a hit at a pool party!!!! I made it the night before with chicken and substituted the mayonnaise with light mayo and nonfat plain yogurt. I also used hot curry. Not a morsel was left and everyone raved about it!

I made this dish for the first time last night. I sauteed chicken breasts in olive oil, s&p for the meat and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I let it sit in the fridge (minus the nuts) about an hour before we ate and it was wonderful. It was even better about five hours later, so I would definitely make this one in advance for best flavor. I think cashews are wonderful and should be used, but not added until just before serving. I will certainly make this again.

I can only echo the rave reviews on this one. Very, very tasty and easy to make and great picnic fare. The only variation I did was to use a combination of golden raisins and dried cherries. I liked the little taste of sweetness from the dried cherries. A little tomato and some watercress on top made a very colorful presentation.

It's really hot and just couldn't cook. Grilled a large turkey breast last night, and used the leftovers for this recipe. Used Martinelli's Sparkling apple cider (any brand would do) instead of white wine (didn't have any wine), used red wine vinegar instead of fresh lemon juice (too lazy to squeeze) and omitted the curry powder (he doesn't like) and it was wonderful served on romaine leaves. Chutney is "key" in this recipe.

wonderful! I used turkey-breast cutlets (boiled then cut up). I added chopped apples and used plain nonfat yogurt instead of mayo. This is going to become a hot-weather staple.

I echo the comments about my husband not liking curry but raving about this. I took it to a concert to feed a group of friends, and everyone went back for seconds. Lowfat mayo certainly slims the recipe down. I also found the recipe made too much dressing, but also wasn't exact on the amount of chicken I used. Next time I would double the chicken to a single recipe of the remaining ingredients.

Excellent and very easy. I used chicken breasts instead of turkey, and used golden raisins (this is one case in which I prefer monocrome to color contrast). I served it on a bed of baby greens to sneak in more veggies with all that protein!

Perfect for sprng and summer, although it makes a nice light meal for any season. I made this with chicken instead of turkey and we loved it! It would be a great dish if you were having guests over, or had to take a dish somewhere, b/c you can make it ahead of time (put the cashews on at the last minute), and it tastes great!

We used the remains of a store-roasted turkey breast, used some hot curry mixed with mild, added extra celery, used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 craisins, used almonds and stuffed it all in a pita bread. Oh baby baby!

I have made this with both turkey and chicken breasts and both ways are delicious. Since turkey is a bit sweeter I use hot Madras curry and Major Grey's Mango and Ginger Chutney for added zing...don't forget to stir any curry blend in a small dry skillet over med-hi heat until fragrant, about 1 min., before using for best flavor.

Great summer salad recipe! My husband doesn't like curry and he even liked it. I used 2 chicken breasts, 1/3 of the dressing recipe (lowfat mayo) which was too much. I used a full recipe of the onion, celery, cashews & halved the raisins which I would use more of next time. The result was great.

I have tried similar receipes, but what is sending me out to get a turkey breast is the idea of brown rice. Also just because it is currey, a little choppe Granny Smith would be good.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but have made something similar. For the person who said it was too "eggy" because of the mayo, try using half sour cream. It's wonderful.

Wonderful flavor. I added the cashews just to the amount that I thought would be eaten. Saved the remainder and added the rest of the cashews as we ate it. That way we had crunchy casshews with every serving.

I purchased a Perdue (sp?) roasted half breast from the deli which saved time and kitchen heat when preparing this. Very good. I followed the recipe exactly and served on a bed of greens.

This is similar to a recipe in an old Cosmo magazine from 20+ years ago called "The Best Chicken Salad Ever" which used pineapple juice and pineapple chunks instead of white wine and toasted slivered almonds instead of cashews, which do hold up better. Serve on a bed of lettuce w/ more chutney on the side, w/ some Gewurtztraminer wine and crusty french bread. Delicious!

Ease up on the mayonnaise. I found this a little too egg-y.

This was perfect for the leftover turkey that I had from the other night. I had to make a lot of substitutions since I didn't have any of the mango chutney, I used my sister's homeade Santa Fe Apricot Chutney that she makes and it was great. To cut down on the fat, I used low-fat mayo and also took the advice of the previous reviewer and used sliced almonds instead of cashews. Also, I used dry vermouth instead of the wine. I also omitted the raisins, since my husband refuses to eat them! Extra celery too. I'm so glad I came across this recipe! Very good, will make this again!
