Made this last night for a special Valentine's Day dinner and it was easy and delicious. The flavors are so complimentary. I used green lentils that I had on hand that were from Trader Joe's, and had been stored for quite awhile. Despite extra cooking time and broth additions, they never got quite as soft as I expected, but maybe that's how it is supposed to be- they tasted rich and amazing. I would like to try this with the Beluga lentils next time. My husband is a huge lamb fan, so I made a full rack of lamb (8 chops) instead of the 1/2 rack the recipe calls for, so the meat took more like 35-40 minutes to cook to temperature. All in all, it was a memorable meal and I will definitely do it again for another special occasion.
