made this for a dinner party to use up package of chopped, natural pistachios from Trader Joe's and lots of fresh peaches...rave reviews! Very showy dessert. I used my own tart crust and 4 large peaches. Using pistachio liquer sounds great, will try that next time.

I was not impressed at all with this dessert. The taste was just ok, and the presentation was not attractive. The green from the pistachio made the tart look like it contained hamburger helper. I would never make this again

Very nice. I also recommend using a different pastry crust.

I have a frangipane and peach tart recipe I've been making for years but never though of using pitaschio before. My husband loves pitachio anything so I tried this for him. It was delicious! And just as easy as the other tart. Unsalted pistachios can be found at Trader Joes or most health food stores. The only change I made was to add a bit of pistachio liqueur to the filling but it would still be great w/out it.

I just pressed the pastry into the tart pan which was very easy. It tasted and looked incredible and my guests loved it! I used 4 very large peaches- perhaps the person who only used two sliced them very thin. I kept mine quite thick as the recipe requested!

I was disappointed that I had to throw out the pastry because it was so soft as to be unusable. Shame on your tester! Also, finding unsalted pistachio nuts is quite a feat in and of itself.

The combination of green pistachios with golden peaches is lovely to look at and is quite tasty. However, the next time I make it I will use a 12 inch tart tin as there was lots of pastry left over and I used only two good sized peaches for the 9 inch tart. You'd likely want to increase the filling a bit for a 12 inch tart - more pistachios and possibly another egg yolk. The pasty was not great. I prefer a shorter crust even if it tends to crumb more easily so would use another recipe next time.
