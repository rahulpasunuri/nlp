This is so easy and everyone enjoys the fresh garden vegetables! I make it in a zip lock bag and take it camping for an easy vegetable side dish.

This recipe makes a ton of pickles! And they are a little sweet. But all in all, enjoyable. (And very easy!)

If you have a garden, you will have all these veggies on hand. Very good, and improves with time. Nice for a picnic.
