This is a great and easy to follow Lasagne recipe. My family love it and the amount gives enough to freeze, which is great. I added ground beef and ground sausage to the tomato sauce for a meat lasagna and add just a dash of sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity a bit. The fresh mozzarella really is the best part!

The best ever. I even froze leftovers and it was GREAT. I'm including this as a family staple.

I made this for a family dinner and it was very good. I made extra sauce and since I was running short on time I did not soften the noodles but added an extra cup of sauce on 2 layers and cooked it for 1 hour and let it rest additional 15 minutes. I made 2 and added mild italian sausage to 1 of them. Both turned out well.

This was a really good recipe! I only made one lasagne and did make some modifications... 2 cans tomatoes, 2 onions, 2/3 C parsley and left the measurements for everything else the same. I also added approx. 1 cup finely shredded carrot (for nutrition, added texture, and to cut down on the acid), about 1-2 T balsamic vinegar, and 1-2 t sugar. I also thinly sliced up a whole zucchini and layered into the lasagna. I didn't use as much mozzarella due to the fact that it seemed overkill and added more parmesan for extra flavor. When I was ready to take it out of the oven it looked juicy but took it out for 5-10 minutes after realizing my husband and guests were not ready. Put it back in (just on warm) for probably 20 minutes, the extra moisture evaporated and it was perfect! Didn't slop around or fall apart and leftovers are perfect the next day! Make sure to use regular lasagne sheets, you only have to cook 10 minutes and they are less expensive:)

I made some minor changes to this recipe and would definitely make it again. I used two cans of tomatos for the sauce, blended it with the stick blender and only made one lasagna, not two (had about a cup of sauce left over.) I used a pound of hot Italian sausage and regular (not fresh) mozz. It was a flavorful, dense lasagna and a big hit. I especially liked that this is an easy recipe and not overly fussy.

I have made this lasagne many, many times. Everybody loves it. My kids ask me to make it on their birthdays, my husband loves it, guests love it. Cutting up all those onions is not that much fun but otherwise it is very easy.

Very bland and really not worth the effort, my no boil lasagne sheets didn't cook through, even though I softened them as per the recipe to start with, my lovely mozzarella went rubbery and the whole thing was flavourless and rather watery.

Hmm...where to begin? I agree with the reviewer who said if you found this bland, you did something wrong. It is good, no not the best, but definitely good. It is a budget friendly party pleaser, and kids love it. I'm still on the lookout for the mother of all lasagne recipes. That being said, anyone else find it weird that you pretty much boil the no-boil pasta? For matter of record, I added extra garlic, red wine, and additional herbs.

It was ok. Feels like a good start but definitely spiced it up w/ pepperoni, hamburger and a section w/ just spinach. But the noodles were not really that good and a few days into leftovers they are pasty. Has anyone made with boil noodles? Did they fare better? And mine was a bit watery. Next time think I'll add cottage cheese too. Did not taste the orange juice at all.

I am really surprised by how much I enjoyed this recipe! I halved it, nixed the onions in the sauce, and added a tablespoon extra orange juice than was called for. The tangy flavor from the orange juice in the sauce compliments the mozzarella very well. My boyfriend and I already ate half the pan!

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet in '00 and it's at its very best when using the tomatoes and herbs from your garden in late August....no need for meat...and certainly no jarred sauce (unless it's from last year's harvest).

I made this on the first date my wife and I had. Look where it got me! It's an excellent, simple recipe that makes an outstanding authentic tasting lasagna. I added extra grated parmesan cheese and some grated Manchego. Paired with a mild blackberry Merlot. She still loves this dish! Danke!

decent recipe, very easy, but its kind of blah - I would have liked it to include more different vegetables or something. If all you want to eat is pasta, pasta sauce, and mozz, then this recipe is for you!

I have made this so many times and for big crowds, everyone loves it and I have given the recipe to so many I have lost count! I add hot italian sausage, otherwise following the recipe. Excellent!

I really do not know what to make of this recipe! First of all, I could not find "crushed tomatoes in thick purée" is!! My grocer doesn't stock this. Does anybody's? So, I used 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can diced PLUS 1 jar prepared Mariana sauce: Sauce was "all good." But, what's the deal with fresh mozzarella? Whoever heard of grating fresh mozzarella? The cheese in my lasagna turned out very rubbery (in spots) but my vegetarian husband claims to have loved it.

I thought it was a little heavy on the onions; I prefer to use two instead of three. I would also reccomend using all fresh herbs; I think it brings out the flavor more.

I thought this was very good, but I would add more oregano and sprinkle with fresh basil next time. The taste is basic, simple & fresh. I'll make it plenty!

I liked this, although I am sure there are better lasagne recipes out there. It's nice that it made two, so that I was able to freeze one and serve it later.

This is a great lasagne recipe. It's simple. The orange juice in the homemade sauce adds a nice zing. The smoked mozz is an absolute must. It adds so much flavor. A big hit in my house.

Perhaps the other reviewers missed an ingedient? This lasagne was delicious; I made it for an office pot luck and it received fantastic reviews. I thought the tang of the orange juice was a wonderful compliment to the tomato sauce.

Delicious! We aren't very experienced cooks, but this recipe was quick and easy. Our guests loved it! We did add red pepper flakes to spice it up.

This was okay, but a little bland. It needed more flavors - I might add meat, if I ever try it again. I imagine there are better ricotta-less lasagna recipes out there, though....

I made this recipe for a large dinner party alongside a more traditional lasagne (Garden Vegetable Lasagne). Those people, including myself, who wanted a lighter dinner opted for this dish and enjoyed it very much. I like that it uses the fresh mozzarella and more of a pomodoro style sauce - it gives the dish a very light, fresh taste.

This gets four forks upon one condition: use fresh Oregano and fresh Thyme [2 Tablespoons each] - makes a world of difference and you won't be able to put your fork down. Kids LOVE it too!

Many superior lasagne recipes out there than this. I tried it for the OJ twist, but it didn't add anything. This is still disappointing after adding fresh basil, and ricotta. I can't imagine how insipid this recipe would be if left as is. Don't bother trying out a new version, if you're happy with an old favorite.
