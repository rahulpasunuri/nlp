This is best when freshly baked. I used up a black-ish banana making it and it was quite nice. It's very casual, though--best for a brunch, not for dinner.

Fast as lightning and reliably delicious, this cross between a custard and a cake is best baked and served in invidual dishes, as it is impossible to cut cake-like slices to serve your guests.

I thought this desert was so easy and so delicious I had to rate it four star. We like custards and are familiar with clafoutis which are a common desert in France. I tried this dish after reading the other reviews--my husband is diabetic and I am particularly eager to use recipes that can be successfully adapted to Splenda. I was amazed at how delicious this desert was given how quick and easy it is to prepare--much easier and less fattening than banana bread as a use for overripe bananas. I used skim milk and 100% Splenda but sprinkled the baking splenda on top with real butter to broil at the end. Doubled the recipe as recommended by others, except for the garnish on top--PERFECT!

I thought this dish was just ok. I took the advise of others re: the sugar, definately sweet enough. In fact I tripled this recipe (I had a lot of bananas to use) and only used a 1/3 of a cup of sugar total. I am not sure that I will make this dish often, but it is an ok way to use up ripe bananas. Although I think I still would prefer a banana bread to this recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and has come out great everytime. I put in more bananas than called for, and I blend them with everything else to give teh whole custard a banana taste.

My banana was over-ripe (with an almost completely brown peel) so I halved the sugar and this recipe was still very sweet. It's pretty much just custard with bananas in it. It was all right, but not incredibly exciting. I'm new to broiling, so I don't know if I did it right, but there were puddles of butter left sitting on top of it at the end, while the edges had started to burn a little. If I could do it over, I would have used less butter and sugar.

More of a custard than a pudding, indead. I doubled the recipe, added 2 bananas rather than just one and a dash of cinnamon to the mixture. I also cut back on the sugar after reading the reviews. It is definitely sweet enough with less sugar. I like this...very easy to make, but wish it was more pudding-like and less custard-like.

I love clafoutis and their custard texture. Ditto on doubling the recipe (all but the banana) as stated below in the Chicago review. Easy on the butter and be certain to use unsalted.

I took the suggestion of a reviewer below and doubled the recipe in a pie plate. It looked lovely, but I really didn't like it. It was far too sweet and eggy for my tastes (I don't like bread pudding, either).

This recipe is great for using bananas that are past their peak! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 inch pie pan. The broiled topping makes it creme brulee-like if you make it ahead of time and chill prior to serving. This is an easy dessert that will impress your guests!

seemed like more of a brunch dish than dessert, but tasty and easy. Used cream fraich with a little vanilla and cinamon mixed in as a topping and this added to the taste as well.

This recipe has become a real staple of my dessert repertoire for week-night dinners: it's dead easy, lots of fruit and dairy for my children, and very yummy. Really great winter treat.

I've made this recipe twice. With 1/3 of the sugar recommended, I found this a lot better. It was almost nauseatingly sweet the first time. I also put the dessert into two individual ramekins instead of one...Wonderful flavor though, and very easy!

This is a great classic clafouti which makes a wonderful brunch dish. I found that substituting the 1 T. granulated sugar sprinkled on top with brown sugar really enhances the taste of the bananas.

Didn't like this one at all. Way too sweet and not worth even the 20 minute effort.

This was SO YUMMY but a bit on the small size. It only serves two so be sure to double or triple it. I added cinnamon to it and it was great. Light and easy for sure.

Excellent, simple (particularly with an immersion type blender), although I might cut back on the butter if you use a really rich milk.

The easiest dessert in the world. A perfect recipe if you don't have time but want a knock-out dessert. Preparation took only 20 mins-the longest being squirting out 2 tsp of vanilla. Definitely a keeper.
