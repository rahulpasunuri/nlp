Really good and very easy. I did use fresh tomatoes and a bit of chicken broth. I also used minced shallot instead of using an onion and removing it. I always have mussels with white wine, so it was nice changing it up with the sherry.

Good mussels are difficult to get in Indiana, so people here really don't know how to appreciate them. This recipe was wonderful! The broth was a tasty addition for the foccaccia. We didn't even add a starch to complete the meal.

Big hit with my wife on "date" night. Fairly easy to prepare, and like others have said, it's a great sauce that goes with the mussels

Good not excellent flavor, easy prep. This dish would server 6 comfortably as a main. It's not 4 first course servings.

Great dish! I made this as an app. for my dad on Father's Day and everyone loved it. I made is as written but was apprehensive about the sherry. I usually use either a white or red wine. The sherry added a great flavour to sauce and I would definately make this one again and again.

This was fantastic! I made this for New Years Eve and the small crowd I fed raved about this recipe!

My family and I thought that this was excellent. I agree that it's almost restaurant quality. We were thinking that next time it might be good to chop up the onion into the sauce, but it worked the way the recipe calls for, as well. When I first poured in the sherry I thought that it would be too sickly sweet, but after cooking it mellowed a lot. We actually thought that it might have perfectly cut down on the fishiness of the mussels. I had considered using white wine like some other people did, but I think that it was better with sherry. I would definitely suggest having LOTS of yummy bread on hand.

This was a delish recipe. I followed the recipe as stated and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. I served this with some crusty bread and a green salad and it made a perfect meal. I recommend this recipe to everyone.

Yum! I needed a recipe to use some frozen mussels I had in leftover from another use. This recipe was a great find. I also chopped the onion and left it in sauce. Also used sherry as the recipe was written-love it with chicken so decided to give it a try. Flavor was excellent, but sure it is also good with some of the other variations indicated. I'd planned to serve with just crusty bread, but my 21 year old was so hungry I cooked some thin spaghetti as well. It made for a great Sunday winter evening meal.

Such a simple and delicious sauce - even I couldn't believe how well it came out. Like many others, I used a good white wine instead of the sherry and chopped the onion to sauté with the garlic. Definitely a staple that will be in my freezer for easy weekday meals.

The best mussels "marinara" I have come across. Keep this receipe as a staple in your kitchen if you enjoy mussels. I too, tweek the sauce using a good white wine instead of sherry. The ratio of sauce to mussels is your own choice -I have made this receipe with as little as 1 1/2 lbs mussels using the same amount of sauce called for -my husband and I happily finish the entire dishl with some good crusty bread. Food chemistry at its best. TRY THIS ONE~.

As good as it gets! Easy to make and impressive, nothing but rave reviews on this one. I found it easier to finish the dish in a wok to ensure the shellfish were covered. I also substituted a very good white wine for the sherry, used fresh herbs and combined mussels with clams. Next time I would add fresh jumbo prawns to the mix.

I was missing half the ingredients, but it was still fabulous! My first time making mussels.

Really good! I usually make this recipe 2-3 times a month. I use dry white wine instead of sherry, and add large shrimp (or sometimes a seafood mix) to the sauce (no mussels). Also, I chop the onion and sauté with the garlic. I serve it over a bed of pasta. Although already great-tasting, it improves in taste the next day. Yummy with warm garlic bread.

This dish is fantastic! I often make batches of the tomato sauce and freeze it. You can defrost and take the recipe from there when you are dying for this and can't bare the hour for the sauce to simmer. Great weekday dinner!

What an easy winner. I added a leek, two chopped shallots, capers and kalamata olives to the tomato sauce. I also eliminated the butter for those on the South Beach Diet and no one missed it. I also made the sauce in the morning. So easy and my guests loved it!

OMG! Easily one of the best recipes I've ever gotten off this site. Didn't have a lot of time so only simmered the sauce for about 20 mins. instead of an hour. Came out fantastic. Served it over pasta and my boyfriend almost died in gastronomic pleasure!

My first time cooking mussles, and it turned out excellent. Substituted dry red wine for sherry. Definitly a recipe to share.

Excellent recipe. I accidently finely chopped the onions and left them in the sauce. This is a keeper. I also don't care for mussels so I sauted some shrimp ladled the sauce on top. Worked very well with shrimp as well.

this was amazing....I used a Sauvignon Blanc instead of the sherry and couln't imagine how this could be any better....crusty bread is a must!

I tried this recipe as a "dry-run" for a tapas party. What a wonderful way to cook mussels. Make sure you have lots of crusty bread to mop up the delicious sauce.

Delicious & easy to make. Added some chicken broth to the sauce to make it a little 'saucier', and served over linguine. Definitely a keeper.

Mussels are so incredibly easy to make! I made this for my husband and children for Valentine's Day Dinner. Make sure you have enough crusty bread to soak up the juices! I did use Pinot Grigio instead of Sherry. A wonderful, inviting dish for the Valentines in your lives.

For a main dish for 3 people I bought 4.5 pounds of green-lipped New Zealand mussels from an Asian market in San Francisco for $1.29 per pound. I was afraid they might be dead because they stayed slightly open when I scrubbed them. However, they were fine, as every mussel opened wide when cooked. This was a delicious recipe with good sourdough bread, and I plan to serve it for New Year's Eve.

This is a fantastic recipe!! I took it to a dinner party and people raved about it all night. I prepped the tomato sauce and took the rest of the ingredients over to the dinner party and steamed the mussels there - very easy to do. You can sub in a Pinot Grigio for the sherry to and it is delicious.

I only had 1 1/2 pounds of mussels, but fixed the total amount of the sauce. My husband and I ate all of it with a whole loaf of French bread. Hope I never loose this receipe. It will be the only one I use from now on.

Simply delicious!!! Served the dish (although I substituted the mussels for top-notch clams) as an appetizer at a big family reunion. Everyone raved. I'm gonna cook these again on friday for the perfect man. Hope the perfect recipe works wonders on the romance!!!

This was a BIG hit with the family! Raves continued throughout the dining experience. Reduced the amount of sherry by 1/4 and replaced it with chicken broth. Served the dish on a bed of linguine.

I made this for friends as the last "course" to our informal New Year's celebration. It was a real winner. Actually, I messed up my timing a bit and had to throw in some chicken broth to keep the steaming liquid going longer...worked just fine.

I have made this recipe several times. It is simple to make and is just amazing.. I also used fresh herbs and made sure to add them at the end to get full flavours. I always double the sauce so we can mop it up with country bread.

I tried this as a main course and doubled the recipe. The sherry did not cook down for me (could have been the volume I was making). I would try this one more time as a first course and flame the alcohol off.

We eliminated the sherry but added 1/4 cup of balsamic vingear while coking down the tomato mixture. Then, at the point when the recipe called for sherry, added water.

This is our new favorite way to serve mussels! Like Devon from Calgary, we too mopped up the great sauce with crusty sourdough and got every last drop. Fantastic flavor!

This is an excellent recipe - I highly recommend using fresh herbs instead of dry. Also, this may sound terribly decadent but I also recommend using just a bit more butter than the recipe calls for, Also, I found cutting the onion in half improves the sauce. I have been sauting unpeeled shrimp and adding them to the sauce with the mussels, and serving over a bed of spinach fettacine - it makes a wonderful presentation.

This is a good recipe, but...I wouldn't add any fresh herbs--if you're using them--until the end. It's a waste to cook them that long. I also simmered the sherry and garlic/herb mixture for a minute then added the mussels and cooked. After they opened I added the tomatoes. I think you get better flavor that way. I added the fresh herbs at the very end as I took it off heat. My wife said it tasted restuarant quality.
