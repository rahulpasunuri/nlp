I love this recipe! When I have made it I've skipped soaking the celery and it was fine. I also include the chopped up celery leaves and a good amount of chopped parsley. We have also put it on a bed of greens to make it a larger salad.

This lives up to the salad I crave from Vladimiro's in Rome...it's amazing!

Divine! And completely different. Leftovers were good, too, a few days later as part of an assorted antipasto.
