The cakes are kind of flat and dense. I added a little bit of baking soda to mine and much better.

I am sorry for those who tried this repice and it didn't work. I made this for my husband's birthday... This cake is amazing!! I followed the recipe to a T, except for 2 things... I did not cool the curd overnight. After it came down to room temp in the fridge, I stuck it for about 45 min in the freezer. Didn't have the time to wait overnight! And, I added a little more curd to the frosting. about 14 of us had it, everyone agreed it was OUTSTANDING!

Very good cake. The cake itself is extremely moist. I followed the recipe closely with no substitutions. This cake is also very expensive to make - it cost me about $50 in ingredients. The cake isn't particularly sweet and a friend who doesn't care for sweets liked the cake for this reason, everyone else also liked it too.

I made the orange curd portion of this recipe to go with the white wedding cake recipe. It was wonderful and made an outragous amount. The orange gave the curd a nice citrus flavor that was slightly sweet. It was a fun alternative to lemon curd. The cake was a hit. I will be making it again.

I have made the white cake part of this recipe a total of two times. Once, using the 9" cake pans and another time using one sheet cake pan (13x18"). Both times I baked the cakes just until the cake tester came out clean. In my experience, the cake is wonderful, moist and delicious when baked as a sheet cake. To me, it tastes drier and not nearly as good when baked in the circular cake pans. It's my go to white sheet cake recipe.

I added about a teaspoon of orange extract to the frosting. Just to zest it up so to speak.

I love this cake ! Due to the numerous comments about the cake being too dry, I was VERY careful not to overmix the egg whites into the batter and not to overbake the cake. I didn't read the directions carefully enough, however, and used all the curd on the layers, rather than saving some for the frosting. When I realized my mistake I just added a little orange juice to the frosting and it was fine.

Beautiful cake, but too dry. If I try this again, I'll use the simple syrup as suggested elsewhere, maybe with Cointreau.

How can this be called a "white" cake, since the recipe calls for adding the yolks??? Looking for a good white cake recipe for a wedding cake...

This is a really good basic white cake if you omit the lemon peel. The orange curd or lemon curd are really good. We used a hazlenut simple syrup to moisten per earlier suggestions and peach jelly inside with the frsoting and it was wonderful for a dinner party.

I love this cake. So easy to make. I have made it without the orange curd, so I used lemon peel instead, and then a strawberry buttercream to fill. I'm a pastry chef, and I have actually used this recipe for some clients and received great compliments. For those who found it dry, moisten the layers with some simple syrup before layering - 2 parts water : 1part sugar boiled until sugar dissolves. you can substitute some water for lemon juice, or fresh squeezed OJ, rum, brandy or another flavour that compliments.

My guests and I found this cake to be amazing! To those who had a hard time with the cake being too dense, I would suggest the following: Make sure your whites are room temperature before beating. Gently fold into batter- it's ok to have slightly incomplete mixing and better than overmixing the egg yolks which will leave it very dry. Pull out when center is just golden and cake pulls away very slightly from pan.

I really liked the orange curd and the frosting as did my guests, but the cake was just so dry. Does anyone know of a good basic white cake recipe?

The cake turned out to be really dense and dry and the orange curd made enough for two cakes. But it wasnt a bad cake. It has a nice twang to it from the orange.

This cake was pretty good, but labor intesive. I found the cake itself to be a bit too dense for my taste. The icing is wonderful as is the orange curd. However, the curd had to be heated in order to be spread, then put in the freezer to be thick enough UGGG! Overall, okay but a ton of work.

I've made this cake twice and both times it was too dry. The second time I cut the baking time by a minute. I think I will keep looking for a good white cake recipe.

Although I made only the frosting from this recipe with another cake, I thought it was just fabulous. I have always been a fan of cream cheese frosting and I've been looking for good ways to add different flavors - this was perfect. I'm thinking of trying to make curds with other fruits for a similar concept. The gelatin made the frosting stay together better, I thought, and it didn't really damage the curd itself, either. Great recipe!

GREAT recipe and worth the time, it can be done a day ahead. I am totally cheap re: the use of this many eggs. I made a small batch of the curd, using the two yolks left from the cake recipe. Then, I slightly increased the frosting recipe. Mixed the small amt. of curd in with a little bit of the frosting and used that to frost between the layers, then used the plain icing for the outside of the cake. Needs a little lift in terms of decoration on the outside, a little candied peel cut in a chiffonade goes a long way, or at the last minute a small batch of raspberries in the center (JUST before serving as their juice will run).

This recipe was quite involved. Though everyone liked it, I don't feel that it's worth the effort.

This was by far one of the best cakes I have ever made, and I've been baking since I was a teenager. The key is to plan ahead and make it in stages. The cake benefits by being made a day in advance, then frosting the day of. Using the frosting to make a "crumb coat" also helps with making it visually appealing. If you really want to intensify the orange flavor, use orange extract in the cake, and make the curd with two cups of o.j. that has been reduced to one cup...absolutely delicious.

What a lot of work but soooo good. I think because of the egg whites, the cake consistency is so much better than that of most other cakes. Made it for my daughter's first birthday as she loves oranges and pretty sure by her gobbling it up that she liked it.

I did not like the texture or flavor of the cake or the icing. I found the icing gritty and unpleasant. However, the people I served it to loved it.

This was a fairly complex recipe but the results were delicious! I served it at a dinner party where it was a big hit. We've begun calling it the "Orange Julius" cake in reference to the drink. I'm looking forward to making just the orange curd again to serve with scones. It was a delicous alternative to lemon curd.

This was excellent, and although it took a little work, I didn't find it overly time consuming. The cake was fabulous. Perfect texture, and better than any boxed mix. I ended up with a little extra orange curd even though I added more to the frosting than it called for. I only had two 9-inch cake pans so I had to bake the first two before doing the third one. I was afraid that the third wouldn't rise after the batter had set but it did just as well as the other two. This one is definitely worth a try!

this recipe is way to time consumeing and expense we are looking for a recipe that is more budget adaptable

The cake alone was very moist & delicious. I made the orange curd & chilled over night as directed. The next day the orange curd was so congealed, it would not spread (too much gelatin)? I wound up mixing it in with the frosting & using it for the filling also, still tasted good.

Very good! Froze very well although I did not make the orange curd. Used only the crean cheese frosting. Great flavor.
