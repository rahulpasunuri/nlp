Excellent! Made if for dinner on Sunday and we are having company tonight, I will make the exact same dish!! Serving with roasted artichokes tonight. Be sure you use wild salmon. It needs the flavor to stand up to the mussels.

I used diced tomatoes to good effect.

This dish is easy on the cook and a crowd pleaser. Much of it can be prepared ahead of time. My only change was to increase the quantities for the sauce. Some enjoyed a (fabulous!) Tobin James zinfandel with it, others had a (hearty) Frei Bros. chardonnay - both complemented the dish very nicely. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Thought this was a pretty good sauce, but it overwhelmed the salmon. The mussels were the best part, but I have other mussel recipes I like better. It was a good, but not great meal and I won't be making it again. (By the way, the Cook from Victoria, BC CANADA must have been reviewing a different recipe...she left out the cilantro and sesame seeds?)

This sauce is amazingly good! I prepared it and the mussels ahead of time for 2, and the only problem I had was keeping the mussels in their shells when adding them to the sauce to reheat. I would double the sauce if serving more than 2, and I had no problem with the amount of saffron as others did -- thought it was the perfect amount. Next time I make this I'll omit the mussels and use clam juice as other reviewers suggested -- don't think it added much to the overall dish except for the flavor in the sauce. (I had about 1/2 cup of liquid from the mussels so will use the same amount of clam juice). Also, maybe it's just me, but I like the flavor of salmon on its own, with maybe a simple yogurt/dill sauce, so next time I'll substitue Halibut or another mild white fish. Make the sauce -- you won't be disappointed!

This is easy, elegant and excellent. Made it several times, leaving out the mussels and substituting clam juice instead (no one but me likes mussels). Even my 6 yr old and 4 yr old loved it.

One of the best salmon recipes we have. It looks like a lot more work than it is. I follow the recipe exactly as it is.

I made this recipe for a romantic night and followed it exactly. This has been my favorite dish sine then. Excellent and delicious. You can't go wrong.

Quick and good for a weeknight dinner. It didn't pack quite the punch I was expecting from the other reviews, but it was interesting enough that I'd make it again with adjustments. I agree with the other reviewers that the mussels didn't add much to it (but then I've had bad luck with mussels lately). Will try again with clams or just using clam juice, and I am curious about substituting some of the cream with coconut milk. The slight spiciness was the best part of the dish.

I made the recipe exactly as directed. I *rarely* give 4 stars but this was well worth it. Loved it. Second only to the tuna with ginger cream and shitake sauce.

I also did not use the mussels, but added a bit of bottled clam juice in place of the missing mussel licquor. It turned out superb. And it's an easy, weeknight dinner! Also would be delicious on pasta. For the cook from NY looking for a low-fat version, I often use evaporated skim milk in place of whipping cream (did not try that with this recipe, but I will!) It's darker than cream, which matters in white sauces, but should not affect the appearance of this one.

Yummy. Made the sauce without the mussels and cream for salmon; modified the recipe slightly by using a can of diced tomatoes for texture. Wonderful, easy and lots of positive feedback from my family and guests.

The sauce is terrific but the mussels are not necessary. If I make it again I'll do it without them and just enjoy the salmon with the wonderful sauce. (I did use less saffron so it wasn't overpowering.)

I made this dish for Valentine's Day and it was incredible. I made it to the store too late to get mussels, so just made the sauce with white wine and a little water - so good I kept sneaking some before the salmon! If I can figure out a low-fat substitution for the heavy cream, I will make this frequently.

This dish was excellent. The sauce was delicious and the whole dish was so easy to make. I make this for my Dad who gets to try my many attempts to find great salmon recipes and he said it was his favorite yet.

This was delicious and elegant, yet so simple to make. I loved that you can make it ahead of time and rewarm it quickly when it is time to serve. It would be the perfect dish for a small dinner party.

My guests LOVED this! This is a dish you would expect to find on the menu at a gourmet bistro...but without the expensive check. I would not change anything about this recipe. Excellent as is! And low-carb is a plus! Will be making this often.

This one lived up to all of the hype. Simple, and absolutely delicious. Tried adding the coconut milk -- as another reviewer recommended -- but for me it tasted better without. This one will be rolled out often. Enjoy!

Sauce was outstanding. Added a touch more garlic as well as some coconut milk (1/2 c) or coconut extract, to give it a Caribbean flair. Went low fat with fat free 1/2 n 1/2 as a substitute for the heavy cream and sauce consistency and taste held up well. Also, prepared salmon on cedar plank.

Easy to prepare, fast and absolutely delicious. We couldn't get enough of the sauce and the salmon/mussels combination was great. This will become a staple.

Excellent! I made this for Christmas dinner as an alternative to the roasted lamb for those in my family that don't eat red meat. Wow - it was snapped up by everyone! Very visually appealing as well as tasty. I used New Zealand green musseles that came on the half shell which cut down on the work (still raw but already cleaned and debearded). I used the "four hour in advance" instructions and it worked out well.

This was a big hit with my family! My son, 10 yrs., finished the remaining mussels out of the sauce pot. My husband said we should definately have this dish once a month. I added more garlic to the sauce and served the salmon over angel hair pasta. I will double the sauce and mussels next time, as they were the best part of this dish!

Wow amazing! I used shrimp instead of mussels because it's what I had on hand. Just poached them in the wine then follow everything else as written. Wonderful, we licked our plates! For those who said the saffron was overpowering...maybe you just don't like saffron? I thought it was perfect. Served with rosemary roasted potatoes and haricot vert. Yummy and sooo easy.

I too served it over linguini and doubled the sauce, but not saffron. It was delicious. It gave "Fish on Friday" a great boost this Lenten season.

This is a must have again type of recipe. My husband liked the sauce so much he said "save the sauce and pick up some halibut tomorrow". We do not like cilantro at all so I simply left it out. I had a sweet chili Thai sauce and I just added a minced garlic clove to that and I left out the sesame seeds as well. I had some frozen bay scallops in my freezer so I used those and served it along with the Roasted butternut squash and spinach salad. Absolutely delicious together.

The taste was wonderful, but the sauce didn't reduce or thicken enough, so serving it was messy. Worth making, but I might adjust the ingredients to add less liquid next time.

WOW! Beautiful presentation. Absolutely delicious and it comes together so quickly. Fancy enough for a dinner party... fast enough for a weekday dinner. My kids (all three under 10) loved it. I served it with a simply dressed salad and good bread to mop up the sauce. YUM!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious - the presentation is beautiful and it can be made rather quickly which makes it a perfect weeknight dinner whether you're alone or have dinner guests. I made it with a basmati rice and salad and warm baguette for the sauce. The mussels with the sauce without the salmon or maybe with just one piece of salmon which has been broken into small pieces would be delicious over pasta which is how I will make it the next time to give pasta a new twist. Saffron is a wonderful spice and would suggest you definitely use it - don't understand the negative comments about it.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday dinner. She is a gourmet cook and loved it! My husband raved about it as well. I was careful when measuring the saffron as too much can be medicinal, and the sauce came out fanatastic. I agree the amount of salmon is too much, I would reduce it to 6 oz per person next time. I will definitely make this dish again, especially since much of it can be made ahead of time.

I made this recipe for 15 people, 3 of which were under 15 yrs old.I made 3 seperate sauces and then combined at the end. Everyone loved it. Had extra sauce left over, added it to Bowtie pasta the next night. That alone is a great dish. Learn the powers of Saffron before complaining.

I made this for my gourmet group and we loved it again. My husband often compliments me on my cooking but he commented several times on this recipe. For us (and there were 8) the saffron was not a problem. The only thing I would change is the amount of salmon per person. It was just too much.

I like salmon and I thought this recipe sucked. There is too much saffron in the recipe. If anyone wants to try it, they should reduce it significantly.

I got rave reviews from my husband and guests whom I made this for. Much of the work could be prepped ahead of time so I didn't spend much time in the kitchen when our guests arrived. Toasted garlic rubbed rounds were an excellent accompaniment.
