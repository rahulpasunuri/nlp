Unbelievably good. I used canned peaches. I can only imagine how tasty this would be with a nice ripe peach. If you broil the toast and peaches a bit, it's almost like eating a piece of peach pie.

Very easy, light and healthy breakfast. The flavor was great and the peaches were very refreshing. I did use canned peaches because the fresh peaches I buy are always powdery and it worked fine.

This recipe is incredibly easy, and the peaches are very tasty with the cardamom and sugar. For a higher protein snack, I make the spiced peaches and put them over plain nonfat yogurt (instead of the toast). The cardamom really complements the peaches...do try it!
