Easy, pleasant recipe. The horseradish mustard sauce has real bite, which we like, but must be used in small quantities on the meat. Perhaps using a horseradish sauce, instead of pure horseradish, would tame it for the less courageous.

The corned beef was a hit. I thought the sauce was too strong so I added a tiny bit of sugar to it, which vastly improved it.

This was good although I also took some of the mustard mixture and spreaded it over the fat side of the corned beef and baked it in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350. It gave it a good taste and the meat wasn't so watery.

Simple and yummy. I've made this several times - almost doesn't feel like a recipe.
