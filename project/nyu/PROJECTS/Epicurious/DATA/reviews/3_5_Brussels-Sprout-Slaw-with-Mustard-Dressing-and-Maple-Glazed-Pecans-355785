I am a 23 year old college student, and this was my contribution to my family's Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a hit. I'd absolutely make this again!

I made this and thought it needed something more so added cranberries. I think raisins would work also. Then I remembered someone had added chopped apricots, which I will try next time. Also, I only had pecan pieces and loved the added extra little crunchies. I dressed ahead of time and let sit out to room temp like other reviews suggested. Great recipe My husband, who loves brussels sprouts really liked this.

This is a very good dish and a unique twist on "salad". And a nice way to eat brussel sprouts. I have been making this for special dinner parties, Thanksgiving, etc for several years. Always get requests for recipes. I do make one chnage. I add approximately 1/2 cup of chopped apricots. It adds a nice, subtle touch of sweetness.

Made this for Thanksgiving when I was looking for do-ahead recipes. Used regular dijon mustard rather than whole grain and just thinly sliced the sprouts with a knife rather than use a food processor. Ended up only adding maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of dressing as the full amount seemed way too much. But I mixed everything the day before, refrigerated and then let come to room temp for service. It was terrific and the most complimented veggie dish of the day. Just had leftovers yesterday -- three days after mixing and it was even better. So don't worry about the admonishment to only mix right before serving, it really improves with age.

Being a fan of brussel sprouts I was eager to try this recipe and was expecting more than I got. I don't know whether the sprouts were too bitter or what, but I was rather disappointed with the result. I followed the recipe to a T, and as other reviewers suggested, mixed the dressing into the slaw earlier and served at room temperature but I found it lacking in something. The dressing I would definitely make again - and I devoured the leftover pecans (loved those!)... but as to brussel sprouts as a slaw - I wasn't won over with this recipe.

I'm a fan of brussel sprouts and am always on the look out for a new way to try them. This one is quite different from the usual pan-fried in butter, bacon grease, oil, name your delicious fat..... Much more like a slaw, it's a nice change from the way we usually eat 'em. That said, I'm not about to stop cooking sprouts with bacon, but this recipe will definitely go into the rotation. And as other reviewers said, it's better the second day, so dress it early and let it sit awhile.

This is suprising, different and extremely delicious. Easy to make, and keeps in the fridge for awhile.

Great salad. It's my 2nd year that I've been making this salad and everyone loves it. One tip is to serve it warm or in room temp.

Excellent when you serve it warm or in room temperature. I've made this salad number of times and will make it again this year for thx giving. Everybody loved it and asked for the recipe. One thing I've done was to substitute the sugar with brown sugar. If you like the gentleness of Brussels sprouts and sweet/sour crunchiness of the pecans - this one is for you.

This is one of my favorite recipes- I could eat it all day long. In fact, I often tell my husband to take the bowl away from me. As is clear, I love brussels sprouts anyway, but this takes them to a new level. I make this regularly during the fall but it's especially great at Thanksgiving. YUM!

I love brussel sprouts, but was disappointed in this recipe -- thought overall it was very bland, it was missing something. I loved the pecans which were wonderful both in the slaw and on their own, but my husband thought their flavor was an odd combination for the slaw. I had a lot of left over slaw and since I'm not one to waste food I tinkered with the slaw and added a creamy mustard dressing I found on this site and a can of mandarin oranges, which improved the flavor. But I don't think I'd make this again. Just didn't do it for me.

PERFECTION!! One of the best, if not THE best vegetable dish/side I've ever made. Defintely better than any salad I've tried. Epicurious, you never fail me!!!!!!! Those pecans are heaven! If nothing else, I am ditching all my butter/spice recipes for "glazed nuts" and just doing as instructed in this recipe. They are to die for. A sweet, salty peppery bite..yum!!! I actually thought the flavors were amazing together and surprised that some found the dressing overpowering. I didn't measure exactly, and used sherry vinegar, but stayed pretty true to the recipe. I don't like alot of dressing on my salads, nor do I like acidic ones, and this was very good. The brussel sprout flavor came through and was not overpowered at all. I'll make this again, and again for sure. Perhaps I'll try a different nut next time? Hazlenuts would probably be yummy!!

Prepared this for a family buffet of 25. I tripled the brussel sprouts but only doubled the dressing. It was perfect. My son-in-law and I both thought the leftovers were better the next day even though the recipe says not to add the dressing to the slaw until an hour before serving so next time I will prepare the entire slaw recipe 24 hours before serving.

This was a nice fresh change to do something that is cross between veggie and salad. I like tart dressings, but this needed some more maple syrup to overset tartness a bit.

This was delicious! Took it to a family Thanksgiving and even the "brussels sprouts haters" loved it. I took a shortcut and bought the glazed pecans at Trader Joe's. This dish is a keeper. It is good room temperature and even cold. Travels well too since it needs no refrigeration.

Mom made this for Thanksgiving and as a a family of Chefs we all like trying new things, my kids ages 11 and 14 ate the nuts before anything else and loved them, thank goodness mom made extra. They alone are a great treat. I LOVED the slaw and I was the one who ate the leftovers for 2 days before heading home. Glad I found the recipe so I can use it for Christmas as my SO loves Brussel Sprouts and I want to make it for him. This will be a regular at my festive meals. I like the unuaual flavor blends. Truly a Winner!

I usually love brussels sprouts no matter how they're cooked but I thought this was a really odd combination of flavors. I took the advice of others and cut back on the dressing. But I have to say it was the addition of the glazed nuts that threw me off. The nuts were fabulous on their own but with the other flavors, I just didn't get it.

I love brussel sprouts and this was good but I thought the dressing overpowered the salad. I would cut down the amount of dressing next time or maybe use a different mustard. I used the Harvest Grain Dijon by Grey Poupon. It definately mellows with time but then the pecans get soggy. The pecans were really yummy and i had trouble not eating them all before the salad assembly. It definatley is a good dish to make a head though.

I made two new recipes for Thanksgiving this year and I used this one and the Butternut/Kale/chedder bread pudding from Bon Appetit Nov. issue. This one exceeded my expectations as I could not see the flavors melding well. I followed the instructions without substitution--I cooked the sprouts the day of (and used the food processor blade). I made the pecans 2 days ahead and the dresing one day ahead. What I can say is that the slaw would not be as good without the pecans, so if I change anything, I will add another half cup of the pecans (and they are super by themselves). Always nice to see Brussel Sprouts done differently. If I play with the dressing, I will probably add garlic, but I really enjoyed it as is!

I thought this would be a new way to try brussels sprouts- and it was. This was really really tasty. I think I may play with the dressing and pick some a different mustard. Definitely agree with other reviewers on the dressing resting time. The slaw improved with an extra 10-15 mins.

We played with the dressing a bit, and hand sliced the sprouts rather than shredding them, so it is a different recipe - however, it is a huge hit every time we make it. Dressing: we made it according to the recipe. but then used that very mustardy dressing to accent an apple cider vinaigrette. 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar 3 TBL maple syrup 1/3 cup olive oil. Whisk those ingredients together to emulsify. Then add 3-4 TBL of the mustard dressing to taste. Whip together and stir into the sprouts. Only add the dressing and the pecans immediately before serving. NOTE: the straight all-mustard dressing will keep nicely in the fridge and works very well as an accent for many things, including in scrambled eggs. We just thought it was too strong a flavor alone for the sprouts.

I don't even want to give this recipe one fork... it just didn't work for me or my family. We were all excited about it, but the flavor of brussels sprouts was completely overshadowed by the other flavors. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I made this for "grazing day" at work - I needed a green vegetable and it needed to hold up for a few hours so overheated brussel sprouts were out. This was a big hit, many just thought it was coleslaw. I doubled the recipe but there seemed to be way too much dressing - I used about what the single recipe called for. Luckily it was delish with salads and I'm using the last of it tonite to marinate chicken. My pecans were SO gooey, I'm making the recipe again tonite and will try the bigger size as called for.

I guess I will be the lone dissenter here. I thought this dish was inedible, as did a friend who I tried to pawn it off on. The mustard flavor is way too strong imo. The pecans, however, are fantastic and are being served at my Thanksgiving party and given as gifts at Christmas, which is what the 1 fork is for. I did try to improve it by adding some dried cranberries and thought that helped some.

This dish was made at a party where about 35- 40 woman brought in their best Thanksgiving dish and this one was one of the first to disappear! I cannot wait to actually make this for my family. I kept going back for seconds (thirds!) Even though this sat for a while on the buffet table it was still delicous.

I loved this. I wish I had more people around that would eat brussel sprout's. The dressing and pecans are great. You definitely want to put the pecans on just before serving and reserve extras for leftovers.

I thought this was really good. Very intereting way to use brussel aprouts. Excellent with the candied pecans. Served with breaded pork chops and a white cheddar potato gratin (also from this site). Great meal.

Simple, delicious. The whole family devoured it, and it had nothing to do with the yummy pecans. The dressing and brussel sprouts alone are good.

this was really good. i think i'll serve it as a salad - it could hold up on its own. and the pecans are so delicious...make a few extra to keep for your next salads.

This is easy, tasty, and Thanksgiving-worthy. The pecans taste like candy!

This recipe is quick and easy to make! (I had my boyfriend hand chop the brussels sprouts while I prepared the rest of the meal.) Letting this sit for at least half an hour is incredibly important. I actually cut the glaze for the pecans by 1/3. My boyfriend and friend both said this dish made it hard for them to remember why they didn't like brussels sprouts!

Vibrant and delicious, made exactly according to the recipe. The flavors and textures of this unexpected treatment were lively and refreshing, and the leftovers still held up splendidly the next day--with the caveat that the glazed nuts should only be added shortly before serving. My advice: reserve some of the nuts if you anticipate leftovers, or make extra nuts (they disappear quickly!)
