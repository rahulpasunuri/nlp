Quick, easy, and delicious. I doubled the recipe for a heartier dessert. Would benefit from the addition of something crunchy, but otherwise scrumptious as is.

This is a great quick and simple dessert (and a good way to use up extra pears). My pears were not very ripe so they took longer to cook but still came out okay. I also added some cinnamon to the syrup, which I thought worked really well (but it cuts down a lot on the cardamom flavour).

This appertizer was delicious! Pears and cardamoms goes very well together at Christmas time too. I do recommend this!

I finished the prep for dinner early and decided at the last minute to make this recipe. I only had canned pears and sadly, no rum. It worked very well. I put the juice from the can in the syrup and probably doubled the amount of cardamom. I wasn't measuring. I put it in a cooling oven instead of baking it. I was worried about the effect of baking because of the different texture of canned vs fresh. This is just about the best and easiest last minute dessert ever.

My pears didn't soak up the flavor as I expected it to. After I mixed the rum with the sauce and was ready to put it on top of the pears, every time I got it on the spoon it hardened. Did I leave it in the oven too long? Very frustrating! The sauce tasted excellent... just couldn't manage to actually get it on the darn pears.

Boston/NY/LA, thank you for the heavy cream suggestion--it was perfect and everybody--me, the dinner guests, and the BF--loved it! Yeah, this recipe is awesome and I will definitely make again.

This was extremely easy, and surprisingly, extremely tasty! We didn't even have it with the ice cream--just enjoyed the pears as they were. I will definitely make this a winter weeknight dessert standard!

I have already made this several times, it was easy and delicious.

A delicious combination, but this recipe isn't very good. My pears were certainly not soft and my sugar nowhere near to being caramelized after the designated cooking time. I ended up microwaving the pears (i had 14 people over!) with jar caramel sauce. The rum and cardamom are fabulous flavorings.

My syrup never carmelized, but that could be my oven. I didn't want to serve this with ice cream, so I just mixed a little (1/8 cup) heavy cream, scented with cardamom and vanilla, into the un-carmelized syrup and served over the pears--lovely! Elegant and very tasty. Just FYI, I don't see anything _too_ surprising about the combination of pears and cardamom.

Surprisingly good, didn't expect pears and cardamom to go well together. Good use of pears that I forgot to eat.
