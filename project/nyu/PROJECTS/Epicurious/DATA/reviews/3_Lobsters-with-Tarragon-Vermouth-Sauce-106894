This sauce is outstanding; it is lighter than hollandaise (1 versus 2 sticks of butter for 3 egg yolks), has the additional subtlety of vermouth and the final surprise of freshly chopped tarragon. I use it for halibut, striped bass rather than lobster which I prefer with drawn butter. Steaming lobster is preferred by most: 12 minutes for a 1.24 lbs; 15 for a 1.50 lbs.

Beware, 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound lobsters will not be cooked in 7 minutes. They need twice at least that time. The fact that a lobster turns red is no indication that it is cooked. They often turn bright red within seconds of hitting the water. To be sure, twist off one of the little feeler claws (using oven mitts to protect your hands from steam). If it twists off easily the lobsters are done.

Unusual recipe, but remarkable; worth the effort.
