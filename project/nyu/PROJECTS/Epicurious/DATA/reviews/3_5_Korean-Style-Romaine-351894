I think this is a great dressing recipe. It tastes just like I am eating at a Korean restaurant. I will be using the recipe a lot! I did not have fresh ginger, so I subbed it for ground ginger.

I made this tonight and thought it was a nice change; something different to do with Romaine. It is so easy, but I forgot to bring the marinated salad to room temperature before serving. I'm guessing that would have enhanced the flavour. I didn't have Korean red pepper flakes, so I just used the ones I had on hand. I will be making it again.

Really one of the best salads, any season, any night of the week. I like spicy food, but I still half (or more) the hot red pepper flakes (I use regular crushed red pepper). Keep everything else the same and it's perfect.

This is sooo good and easy. I did let the dressing cool somewhat before mixing with the romaine. It was just as good the next day although slightly more wilted. Thanks for a great different green salad; will make again!!

Delicious! Great salad for an Asian meal and quick to make. Followed exactly, except added peanuts in place of sesame seeds.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. The only change I would make is to solve half teaspoon of cornstarch in the water before adding it to the sauce, to thicken it up a little bit.

My only substitutions in this recipe were to use regular crushed red pepper instead of the Korean version and, instead of the sesame seeds, I used some coarsely chopped soy/wasabi spiced almonds. This has become a big favorite at my house. An added benefit is that it is even good the next day so I always end up bringing a little with me to work for lunch. Perhaps those having a problem with the wilting are pouring the dressing over while it's still too hot; i.e., almost boiling. Let it cool a little bit first and you shouldn't have any problems.

Wonderful. I'd been looking for a flavorful, non-salad recipe for romaine, since I had two tasteless romaine hearts on hand. This was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. I screwed up the proportions due to misreading a quantity and had to double the marinade as a result, but I was glad to have the extra dressing in the end. I ate all the lettuce before the 30 minutes were up, too. I disagree with the commenters who say this needs sugar, but I do think it could use a splash of lemon. Anyway, I'll be making this very often.

This was great - quick, easy and delicious. The romanie retained a real crunch even though I did marinate it for the full half hour (although, unlike the recipe, I put it in the fridge during this time). I substituted crushed Sichuan chillies as I did not have Korean pepper flakes, and this worked perfectly well.

Instantly and spontaneously after the first bite of this, I exclaimed to myself: "What IS this???" It was borderline horrid, and reminded me of what gasoline might taste like. Tired, wilted greens, drizzled with your favorite petroleum product. Considering the other rave reviews, perhaps its an acquired taste...

Delicious. I was looking for a ginger dressing and a way to eat my leftover romaine. I didn't marinade anything, but it was fine. I love Korean food, and I don't cook. This was easy for me and quick. It also made my place smell yummy. Here's where I went wrong then right again: I started with a way too hot pan and burned some of the garlic (which wasn't a recipe killer) and I added a splash of olive oil as I felt the overall volume was a bit low... then (again probably because the pan was too hot and it evaporated the water) I added 2 more splashes of water. It all worked out.

I've made this dish several times and it tastes better if you don't boil the marinate. Just mix all of them and pour it onto the lettuce and it tastes fresher and more intense. You don't want to boil sesame oil because it lessens its aroma.

Awesome, easy, and no sogginess here. I suspect that commercial lettuce is the culprit in some of the reviews that I read. I used my romaine from the garden that was threatening to bolt. Perfect! I paired it with "Korean Marinated Beef" for a very satisfying dinner.

An easy, light, fresh-tasting salad that would also make a great accompaniment for Chinese food or sushi. I let the romaine marinate for about 15 minutes -- it was flavorful, but still crisp.

Very good and easy to prepare. I also heated up some left over ham with pineapple and added to it and it was great. But I would not let it set too long after making it because it does tend to get a bit soggy. I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic. My partner and I are SO burned out on your typical dinner salad. We both love Korean cuisine and this dish was true to form. We took the advice of other review writers and added 1/2 a teaspoon brown sugar for sweetness (added during sauteing of garlic and ginger) and it was great. Also, we didn't let it marinade since our main course was done and it was just fine; next time we will try it with the marinading time.

really good quick salad, but definitely better if it doesn't sit too long as it gets a bit soggy.

This was an OK salad to go with store- bought Kalbi-marinated steak for a quick dinner, but I would stick with making traditional vegetable banchan for taste and presentation overall. And the dressing in this recipe really stuck to the pan and made cleanup a p.i.t.a. :-(

Very different, very easy, not too spicey. Nice change to the usual salad. Will definitely make again

Great, easy salad. Kind of an asian twist on a grilled caesar. Will be making this a lot.

YUM. the second time i made just a smidge different. instead of 1 tablespoon soy sauce, i did 1 teaspoon soy and 1 teaspoon teriyaki. needed a little sweet. my new favorite dressing!

This is pretty darn good. Great Asian flavors! We tasted the dressing before tossing it with the romaine and decided it needed just a bit of sweetness and acidity, so we added 1/2 tsp. seasoned rice vinegar and 1/2 tsp. mirin (sweet rice wine). We made a dinner salad out of this by adding some julienned carrot, sliced cuke and some left over rotisserie chicken. Next time we will add some fried won ton crisps or crisp chow-mein noodles for added texture and crunch. Definately will make again...maybe later this week!
