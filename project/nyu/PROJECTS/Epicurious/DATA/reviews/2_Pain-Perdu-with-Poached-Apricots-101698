I don't know what the previous reviewer might have done wrong, but this was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this to use up an abundance of apricots from a tree. I served it over waffles, instead of French toast. My husband said it tasted like canned apricots. That's not bad, but, if so, why waste orange liqueur and anise. Just keep it simple: sugar, and maybe some cinnamon and/or vanilla or almond flavoring.

That's not bad, but if I make poached apricots again, I'll keep it simple - sugar, water, and maybe cinnamon and/or vanilla. Why waste orange liqueur and anise?

I had an abundance of apricots from a tree and decided to try this. I served it over waffles, instead of French toast, but my husband said it tasted like canned apricots. Not that that is so bad, but it seems a waste of orange liqueur and anise. If I decided to make poached apricots again, I'd keep it simple - sugar, water, and maybe some cinnamon and/or vanilla.

I had an excess of apricots from a tree and thought this was a good way to use them. It's very easy, but not exciting. I served them over waffles, insted of French toast, and my husband said that tasted like canned apricots, which seems to be a waste of orange liqueur and anise. It could be used as a way to make what taste like canned apricots, if one wanted, but just keep it simple - maybe just the sugar and add cinnamon or vanilla.
