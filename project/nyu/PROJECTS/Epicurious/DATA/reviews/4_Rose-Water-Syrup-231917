The delicious, refreshing drink using the rose syrup is simple and fantastic. Really great on a hot sticky day. I added a couple of drops of grenadine to tint the drink pink, and added a sprig of Algerian mint to the glass and it looks as pretty as it tastes. I am looking forward to trying the other syrup variations.
