This is an excellent recipe, and very authentic. I've made it many times. The marinating time is key because the favors need time to meld. The cookbook this recipe is from is the one my Portuguese mother-in-law refers to, and she got me a copy, too, when I was a newly wed, so you know it's authentic. For those who may be unfamiliar with it, coriander is another name for cilantro.

I have made this dish for various potlucks and every single time, I am accosted for the recipe! Green beans have never tasted so good. This is my go-to entertaining dish because it's easy, inexpensive, but looks and tastes like fine dining.

Very Tasty! I added 1 small green onion as well. Didn't find either garlic or onion overpowering. Salted the water well, and there was no extra seasoning needed.

I have already left a glowing review, but tried adding boiled new potatoes and it was super delicious! This recipe is also good with brocolli.

This dish was easy to make and a hit at today's brunch. Even my husband likes it and he doesn't like vegetables very much. I let it marinate overnight and I added more salt because it really was needed. By the way...the recipe calls for coriander, but it should say cilantro.

really tasty even though i didn't have time to marinate and toss everything at once. also add in bits of grilled salmon which went really well.

This is a very good recipe. However, if you think garlic might have a very strong taste you can change it for finely cut leek instead. It's also delicious if you use broad beans instead of green beans.

This recipe was a resounding success at a party. The dish was complimented several times by different people throughout the night. It is easy, fool proof, tasty, and a wonderful summer dish since it is served cold.

Don't know what I did wrong. The dish was overpowered by the raw garlic, even though I used less than the 2 cloves suggested. Not a keeper.

I made this with frozen green beans, making this a really easy dish. I prepared it about an hour before dinner, didn't refrigerate - and it tasted wonderful even before I added the lemon juice/vinegar. The whole dish was a lovely green color.Will make this again and again.

This recipe was outstanding. Even my 6 year old, who rarely enjoys salads, asked for extra helpings.

Excellent. I've made this several times for family gatherings, and I always wish I had made more. Delicious.

A hit at a small dinner party. Served with braised lamb. Didn't find that any of the ingredients dominated the beans - they all just complemented them well. I think next time I might uncover the beans after removing them from the fridge to bring them up closer to room temp.

These were terrific and there was nothing left over from a dinner party for 8. Even those who were not fans of beans said how good they were. This is a keeper

This dish was great but I will definitely steam the green beans the next time I make this dish. Very easy and tasty!

These were the bomb at a recent dinner party. Had to give out the recipe that night. Also great that you can make ahead and finish up at last minute. Definitely a keeper.

This was tasty and refreshing at the same time. I did not use the vinegar at the end, just the lemon jiuce and not as much oil as called for. I did not refrigerate it either, it is good at room temp.

If you like cilantro you must try this recipe! This is an excellent, fresh, easy recipe. I make this at least once a week and toss all the ingredients together if I don't have time to marinade. Also, it is the first time I have ever rated a recipe.

Sounds pretty good but I'm wondering why it was included in Central/South American section. I am researching the foods of Ecuador but can't seem to find much. This recipe should be moved to the European section.
