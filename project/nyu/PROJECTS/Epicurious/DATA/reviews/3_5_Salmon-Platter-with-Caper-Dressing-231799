I served this dish for a my future daughter-in-law's bridal shower, and it was great. I grilled the salmon, put it on a bed of spinach in the center of a large platter, tossed all veggies but avocado in some dressing and arranged them around the salmon, added avocado last. Drizzled a bit of the dressing on the salmon & avocado slices. Extra dressing on the side. Perfect as a do-ahead dish, and the ladies seemed to enjoy the food greatly, in addition to the occasion.

This was yummy! Since salmon is an oily fish and avocado is equally oily I did not add any olive oil to the dressing. The lemon juice cut through the oil nicely. Substituted mirin for sugar. Served it with rice instead of potatoes.

I only made the caper sauce that we spooned over grilled sockeye salmon and it was delicious. Nice on a hot summer day. My sisters used the left over sauce as salad dressing the next day.

I thought this was a very nice dish. I don't know what Oregon was expecting from a dish titled "salmon platter". It's nice to have something fairly quick to put together for a snack or unexpected guests if the items are on hand. I too leave out the potato (just doesn't work for me). And for the record Oregon, I smoked my own salmon and baked my own bread ahead of time :) On that note, I'm off to "arrange" another "useless" recipe... Eat well everyone.

I know everyone can put salmon on a plate but this "recipe" is a suggestion for flavors that will compliment the salmon. I have done many salmon platters in my time but never put this combination together before. I made it for a party last week and everyone loved it.

Thanks for a recipe that even my cooking challenged husband can prepare when I need a break from the kitchen. He hasn't made it yet, but the ingredients are gathered and he'll be serving it soon. I'll keep you posted.

Thought this was an excellent "arrangement." Assembled the platter as an appetizer (skipped the potatoes) for Easter dinner and it went off amazingly. It was an "interactive" dish that everyone enjoyed. I liked the fact that it was uncomplicated and left me free to put together the rest of the meal.

Since we don't always have hours and hours to put on a nice meal , I appreciate these simple, elegant recipes. It impresses guests with out sweating it out in the kitchen for hours.

For those who think this is "just" an arrangement, please consider those of us who are starting out and learning to entertain. I'm glad Epicurious has ideas for all of us.

This recipe, or for those of you who prefer the word "arrangement", is really quite delightful. And by the way, since when did it become really cool to be a food snob?

I have been looking for a way to serve some smoked salmon. Thanks for reminding me of a nice way to do it!

As a caterer, I found the presentation simple. The ingredients were delicious for a brunch.

This is a very good main dish. By eliminating the potatoes, it makes a fine appetizer. For those who feel this is simply an "arrangement", smoke your own salmon for a greater challenge.

This happens to be a very good main dish. By leaving out the potatoes, you have an excellent appetizer. For those upset that this is an "arrangement", smoke your own salmon if you need more of a challenge.

Ridiculous to have this "arrangement" in a "recipe" file!

Speaking of useless, that's exactly what the "sour grapes" Oregonian's review is. While the recipe's not a world-shaker, sometimes a nice simple presentation suggestion is welcome and useful to many busy people. -a professional chef

This is not a recipe, but an "arrangement" Useless, and not up to Epicurius's standard
