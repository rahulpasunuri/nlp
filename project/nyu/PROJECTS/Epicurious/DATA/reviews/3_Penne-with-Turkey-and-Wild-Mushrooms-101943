I found this an easy and tasty recipe for mushroom lovers. I only used Crimini mushrooms and loved it. The sauce is a little thin but much thicker the next day.

A perfectly good recipe. I don't quite understand all the criticism about blandness, etc. I like very spicy Italian food, but not mushrooms. I did something a little different with the spices, using pepper-infused oil, a touch of jalapeno as well as about 1/2 the red pepper suggested. My suggestion would be to make sure you have top flight ingredients--de Cecco pasta, excellent Italian parmesan, good olive oil, tasty wine. Thie recipe can't hide inferior ingredients.

This recipe was great but not very spicy as is. I would use much more garlic and more more crushed red pepper. Also, I think the recipe would be perfect with 1/2 lb of pasta, keeping the other ingredients the same amount.

This simple dish was great. I bumped up the chili flake and also used an onion instead of a red pepper. I let the sauce simmer for about 10 Min before adding the pasta.

This was fine, but not great. I liked the broth like sauce which was lighter and a welcome change from the usual cream, or tomato based pasta suaces. If I made this again I would add some reconstitued dried wild mushrooms which would give the dish a little more 'depth'.

I made this recipe in the past and enjoyed it. This time, our local grocery store was out of ground turkey so I substituted hot turkey sausage and it turned out great! In fact, I liked it better than with the ground turkey and will always use turkey sausage going forward. Used a combination of shitakes and portabellas and fresh thyme from the garden- yum!

We really love this dish. I am lucky enough to have some excellent dried mushrooms from Italy and Poland, and I used them: added the soaking liquid and chopping the reconstituted mushrooms (in addition to the fresh). The serving broth is somewhat thin, but I liked it (and have eaten similar dishes in Italy). But the pasta quickly absorbs the "sauce" so that leftover pasta is plumper with no juice left in the bowl!

If you liked this, you will love Pasta with Smoked Turkey and Wild Mushrooms (this site). It's fabulous, with none of the sauce thickening problems that some reviewers have commented on.

I tried this last night and was not impressed. When I added the red pepper and thyme it completely engulfed the kitchen. Everyone was coughing and all the windows had to be opened. I followed the directiosn to a T, anyone else have this problem? That experience aside, the taste didn't wow me - reminded my husband of beef-a-roni.

We love this recipe and make it frequently. Great weeknight dish. Turkey sausage is very good, too. It's become an old standby in our house.

This is just like many other bland and boring recipes from this site. But, after some help, this could be improved. Adding chopped zucchini or spinach might boost the flavor. The watery, thin sauce is definitely a problem - reduce the chicken stock to 1/2 cup and reduce the wine to 1/3 cup. Or, make a corn starch mixture to thicken it up. I don't like that you have to use two pans to make the sauce either - average outcome not worth the extra mess! I would replace the green onion (not strong enough) with regular onion in the 1st stage of saute. I had to add quite a good dose of S&P to make this even a little tasty.

I substituted onions for bell pepper, ground beef for turkey, red wine for white wine and added sun-dried tomatoes. This was great!

To spice it up a bit more, I just added more crushed red pepper...this recipe makes a large quantity, and it freezes to make GREAT leftovers!! I've made this one several times, and my guests simply rave over it!

I am not sure what happened here. When I added the cheese, it melted and all stuck toghether! It had a really good taste and would like to try it again.

Great dish! I do not care for turkey, so I used Mornginstar Farms Soy Crumbles instead of the turkey, and it was fabulous. (Let me plug the Moringstar Farms soy products -- they are absolutely wonderful. I think they taste better than most commercial meats out there, except maybe organic meat.) It was spicy and not too heavy -- perfect for a summer evening.

What a great dish! My husband and I loved it, I'm sorry I didn't make a full recipe for the 2 of us. The sauce is thin but so full of flavor that we didn't mind.

This recipe is really 2 and a half forks. The sauce was a bit thin and could use more flavor. But when we added a can of chopped tomatoes and the puree to the leftovers, it was fabulous!!! I would make this again but probably add more spice or hot sauce and definitely always make it with the tomatoes!

This could serve probably twice as many people as noted. This was a wonderful dish with lots of zip.

My partner and I loved this dish, and it made great leftovers. We thought it had just the right amount of spice, and was rich without being too heavy. The turkey was a great substitute for ground beef. We're looking forward to making this again.

This was a very easy and healthy (except for the cheese) pasta dish. I was cooking for 2 so I halved the pasta, red pepper flakes, broth, cheese and wine and used 12 oz of the mushrooms. Great flavor! I like pasta with more 'stuff' in it. I have enough leftovers for another dinner. I served the pasta with a salad and bread.

This dish was good, easy to make, and fairly healthy. Didn't pack a big "punch" though in the flavor dept.

Delicious! Really, this deserves three and a half forks. I added a half a yellow bell pepper as well, and topped with fresh basil for color. However, I sauteed the bell peppers, garlic and spices separately from the turkey. That way the peppers weren't overcooked, it was perfect!!!! This recipe makes tons!

Easy dish to prepare and very delicious.Instead of wild mushrooms I used regular button mushrooms. I would definitely make this dish for a party.
