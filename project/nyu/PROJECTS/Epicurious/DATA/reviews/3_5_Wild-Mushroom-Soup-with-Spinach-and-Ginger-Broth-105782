A little soy sauce and a bit of sesame oil make this perfect, I think.

Adding lemongrass and a bit of soysauce helped add salt and depth. This was a great broth; but was little more than that. I will add potstickers or dumplings the next time around.

I was skeptical when I read the reviews so I used button mushrooms to avoid wasting the more expensive types. I added chopped fresh cilantro and a little bit of chopped tomato. It was delicious but I would not consider it filling enough for a main course.

This soup was easy to make, tasty and healthy. I doubled the amount of spinach to make the soup heartier. I found that the ginger flavor was really terrific the first day, but seemed to weaken alot on the second day. Any ideas on how to keep that ginger flavor?

Not worth the effort or expense. Taste was ok, but no one asked for seconds. I would not make this again.

This is a great 'light' soup. It tastes wonderful, is easy to make, has a terrific aroma and keeps. Not for an entree; however, wonderful for a soup starter. Not a chowder so don't expect a heavy soup.

The broth was flavorful, but I cannot say we were overly excited about this soup. Definitely add more mushrooms if you intend it as the meal.

This recipe was a huge success, and it tasted absolutely terrific! It has so much flavor, even though it's light. Even my friend who dislikes mushrooms liked this soup. The best part is that he ginger makes the whole house smell wonderful (we could even smell it faintly through the next day). My only advice is that one should make this as an appetizer or a side dish rather than a main course, because it wasn't incredibly filling. But it was definitely one of the best soups I've ever made.
