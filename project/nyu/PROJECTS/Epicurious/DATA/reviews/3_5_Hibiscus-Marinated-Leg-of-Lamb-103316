We still remember the first time we fixed this lamb 12 years ago. Loved it and still do. Pair it with a really good wine for a meal you'll remember. As another reviewer suggested, more garlic is a good thing. I have rubbed a garlic and salt paste on the meat before roasting.

My first Review! I made this for Easter Dinner in 2002. Most of the family said they didn't like lamb. Well after eating this recipe, they all changed their minds! The tea takes the lamby taste right out of the meat and tenderizes it with a flowery sweetness. I'm not going to disagree with everyone that rosemary and garlic are THE lamb flavours, but if ever you need to make a super-tender leg of lamb for people who aren't true lamb lovers, THIS is THE recipe to make, in my opinion. I actually didn't find pure hibiscus tea and used a mixture (also good luck finding organic). Don't think it matters. Truly exotic taste for the effort. Yum Yum Louise in Montreal

Tastes, good, but can be a little soggy because of the marinade. I would make it again though, but this time I would add more salt and pepper and rub it on the meat before cooking

This is absoloutely *fantastic*.. I took another reader's advice, and draped it with rosemary... as well as stuffing sliced garlic cloves into the lamb while it roasted. A huge hit; I'm so glad my first attempt at lamb turned out so well!

To the previous reviewer: The tea leaves are used in place of the hibiscus flowers. Add them to the boiling water in the beginning. The jelly is used at the very end once the marinade has been used to deglaze the roasting pan. You'll find this part in the very last paragraph of the recipe.

I can't rate this because I haven't made it yet. I'm a bit confused...when do you add the jelly and the tea leaves? I don't see it anywhere in the preparation...?

This is by far my most favorite wat to roast lamb. The only thing I add is rosemary just before I put it into the oven.

I also used a pork roast... it was "two forks" but the leftovers were GREAT in a BBQ sauce served on toasted onion buns! This marinade is very interesting....

This is one of my favorite lamb preperations. The meat is tender and marinade brings out the complex flavors of the meat.

The sauce was good, but the lamb was less tasty than it might have been with a simple treatment of olive oil, salt and pepper. In fact, on the cut sides, it was even a little mushy in texture.

I made this with a 5lb boneless pork loin rather than the lamb and it worked well. The meat was very tender.
