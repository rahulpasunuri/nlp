Delicious. My 3yr & 6yo could not get enough. I added some sauteed pearl onions and sesame seeds when I made it for a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe. ** Make sure to use unseasoned rice vinegar. If all you have is seasoned (has sugar added) then you will need to reduce the brown sugar. Enjoy!

Recipe was nice but it was too sweet. I will make it again but would only use a tsp of sugar instead of tbsp

I added ginger and garlic to mine besides some shallot. I increased the flavor by adding an additional 1/2 those of sesame oil. It definitely enhanced the flavor.

I agree with others this is OK. I got good comments from the family but it seemed to lack something. I am trying to figure our what would brighten the whole dish just that little bit that it seemed to need. It was good enough that I saved it to my recipe box to try again with some changes. Maybe add fresh cilantro? I'll let you know.

A good -- not great -- dish. Does not have BIG flavor. However, it was a refreshingly crunchy side dish for a picnic.

This recipe is great - I like to saute the snap peas from my garden in olive oil instead of boiling them. I omit the other peas, and just use the snap peas with the vinaigrette, and it tastes great.

This recipe is my favorite way to prepare the fresh snap peas from my garden. The recipe is delicious as written.

This is good. Not fantastic, but good (although the wife loves it). I substituted shelled edamame for peas because that was all I had on hand, & that was super tasty. Also added scallions and ginger because it seemed right.

Quick and easy and incredibly tasty. Both my sugar snap peas and english peas are bountiful in the garden this year, and this recipe is a perfect excuse to grow even more next year!

I made this with only sugar snap peas bc that is all I had (I used about 1 1/3 lbs). Also I added 1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds. That added really great dimension and it looks pretty too.

Very tasty. I messed up and failed to buy rice vinegar and used apple-cider vinegar instead, and it was still a huge hit.

I used farmer's market sugar snap peas and frozen sweet peas. The dressing was great. 1T of toasted sesame oil was a little strong, so I would reduce to 2 tsp next time. I might also add some fresh grated ginger root.

Super easy to make and very tasty. Our friends loved it too and wanted the recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

Terrific, will now put as part of regular rotation! I only did snap peas (didn't have shelled peas on hand) and swapped out the brown sugar for some splenda (for lower carb count) and it was delicious and so easy! Serve this with some soy-and- pepper roasted salmon... hello $18+ restaurant entree you can make at home!

The flavors in this recipe are perfect! I used toasted sesame oil and the flavor was a little strong, so next time I'll probably reduce the amount of sesame oil or try a lighter flavored sesame oil.

I loved this. It tasted so fresh (granted, I had just bought my peas at the farmer's market) and the dressing didn't overpower the peas.

Well balanced flavor, goes perfect with salmon glazed with honey, ginger, & soy.

Very good. Perhaps not quite as tasty as, but less work than this one: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107988 It's going in the file. Try it!

I doubled the sugar snap peas instead of using shelled peas-simple and delicious. My guests loved it!

Excellent easy recipe. Subtle flavors that taste great. I used frozen peas because I couldn't get fresh pea pods. Still great.

Delicious! easy!

I couldn't find regular peas, so I made this dish with just the snap peas. It was delicious. The dressing is tasty but does not overpower the fresh sweetness of the peas.

Didn't think this was so great

This is a very easy, quick, and great side dish- I made it to accompany the Seared Tuna with Wasabi Mayo and it was the perfect complement of sweet & crunchy to the spiciness of the tuna.

This was very easy to make and very light and refreshing. I made it for a dinner party and it was such a hit that it's been requested for a potluck party. I made it with both types of peas, just as suggested in the recipe.

Wow, this recipe is so flavorful. I didn't use fresh shelled peas--just used double the amount of sugar snap peas. I will make this again and again.

Excellent! Used all snow peas. Dressing would be good on any vegetable for an Asian meal.

These were easy and excellent! So fresh-tasting and spring-like - it's our new favorite side dish (had to use frozen, thawed peas because I couldn't find fresh ones).
