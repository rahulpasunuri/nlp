Made this for Christmas dinner, 2012. Delicious! I added a caramelized onion, since it seemed like a good idea--it was! It bubbled over & made a mess in the oven, so I'll try to remember to put something underneath to catch spills the next time.

This was a clear winner of all the food I cooked on Christmas day. It was spectacular. I couldn't find "Yukon Gold" potatoes at the store, so bought red-skinned and white "Jersey" sweet potatoes instead. That seemed to work fine. The baking dish was too shallow, however, and I did get lots of spillage in the oven.

Made this for Thansgiving. It's full of flavor and very easy to make. I did substitute chicken stock for the milk and finished with the cream.

Good recipe I made it twice. second time added a caramelized onion and that works. Can use other potato combinations. mess around try yams or sweet potatoes but add the onion the recipe needs the flavor.

Prepared this last night to serve with porkchops and buttered green beans. This was delicious. Savory with just a bit of sweetness from the yam. I was apprehensive that the yam would be overwhelming, but it wasn't at all. I halved the recipe and used 3/4 skim and 1/4 cream for main cooking and all cream for finishing. I will definitely make this again.

I loved the gratin, though I did make some changes. I used 1% milk and added a bay leaf and some juniper berries to the infusion. I also forwent the cream and used 3/4 of a small container of mascarpone whisked into the hot milk mixture before I poured it over. It was so velvety and rich, in the right way. Such a nice alternative to your everyday gratin.

I upped the garlic to two cloves and only used one teaspoon of salt and it was delicious. I didn't have thyme leaves so I used 1 tsp of ground thyme and it was a perfect swap. I didn't really weigh my potatoes either - I just used one large sweet potato and two big baking potatoes and it was the right amount to fill a 10-inch cast iron skillet. I used the same amount of liquid as the recipe calls for. Next time I'll use the lower fat varieties but this certainly was delicious!

DONT USE 1 TBSP OF SALT!!!! 1 tsp is already overkill. I used 2/3 tsp and found it too salty. I also used saffron & paprika instead of thyme, and it was quite tasty. Super velvety and creamy. AND I used 1% milk, 1 tbsp of butter, and a bit of half-and-half as drizzle. I'm a fan of full-cream desserts and soups, and this didn't need to be any creamier.

Good. Made it with 2% milk and half/half instead of whole milk and whipping cream; still very tasty, just not as rich. Like others, I upped the garlic. I also sauted some sliced crimini mushrooms, thinly chopped onion, and more garlic in butter until golden beforehand, then topped the potatoes with it before adding the milk. Added more complexity to the flavors.

Great recipe - I used soy milk instead of regular milk but did use half-and-half for the cream. I pureed the leftovers and left-over baked squash with more soy milk and vegetable broth, added some curry, and had great soup for lunch. I would definitely make this again!

Fabulous recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. I baked it a few hours ahead of time at home and wrapped the baking dish in towels to keep in the warmth. It traveled well and was still hot 3 hours after coming out of the oven! The sweet and savory combination works well. The only drawback is that it is REALLY rich with all the milk, cream, and butter.

I loved this recipe. It came out perfect. It can also be made for two. I just reduced all the ingredients to 1/4 of the original recipe. I still used the suggested cooking time. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Very good and easy to make. I would definitely make it again. I might use just Yukon Gold potatoes.

This was rich and flavorful and definitely matched the holiday move. However, something was off for us with the proportions and timing. We sliced the potatoes very thin using a food processor, and perhaps thinner than intended? It cooked faster than expected, so we took it out of the oven early. The sweet potatoes ended up somewhat disintegrated. And we had too much liquid left in the pan in the end, even though everything was cooked through and brown on top.

I really liked this. Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. A few modifications: I made a smaller portion, but used as much liquid as in recipe (1.5 cups skim milk + .5 cups cream). Used 3 cloves of garlic, fresh sage, and a bit more salt and pepper than recommended. Followed the advice of someone else below and layered yukon gold, then sweet, then another layer of yukon gold. Cooked uncovered entire time. YUMMY!

Great recipe with some mods. I cut the sweet potatoes altogether. I used Skim milk, added white extra sharp cheddar (about 1 cup). I layered the potatoes and cheese (two layers each). I held out the garlic and the nutmeg from the milk mixture and added it to the cream. I also upped the garlic to three cloves. Finally, I did not cover it at anytime during the cooking time. Was a beautiful, crunchy golden brown. Very well received. Will make again.

Made this with Christmas dinner and would never make again. Just was not a nice combination of flavors, bland appearance, and no one really liked it.

This was very enjoyable, though probably not my favorite potatos au gratin ever. I followed the recipe exactly & can't think of any changes that I would make to it.

Very impressive dish. My husband brought it to a work party and it was a huge hit. The one thing I will do differently next time is slice the potatoes a bit thicker to prevent them from falling apart when serving.

I loved it! Here were my mods that worked out perfectly for me. I also included some parmesan cheese and more garlic, thanks to others' suggestions. I used 2% milk, not whole milk - much healthier. One big difference is that I did NOT cover the dish at any point - this gave me a crispy, brown top, that looked better and, in my opinion, was the tastiest part of the whole dish. This one's going in the book and I will definitely bring it out next time I have company for dinner.

Like others, I upped the garlic and put in some parmesan. It was an excellent dish that went over well at the dinner party. I will make it again with some variations to the flavor to see where it can go.

I have made this recipe several times--using three cloves of garlic and grated parmesan adds a little more flavor!

I served this at a dinner party and had rave reviews. One guest has since requested the recipe for her own party. I agree, very calorie laden but certainly worth having once in a while (I used 2% milk and it was fine - mbut still used the whipping cream). sliced the potatoes on a mandolin to get them extra thin and quick. Easty to prepare and can be done a day ahead. Definitely use this again.

I've made this twice since it was published. The first time I mixed the layers with yams and golds. The second time I kept the golds on the top and bottom and yams in the center and sliced them all paper thin. The second method seemed to be better.

I made this for Thanksgiving. My husband and all of the kids loved it. The other adults liked it. I used less milk as suggested, and I did leave it to brown about 20 minutes longer than suggested. Would not make this everyday because its so fattening, but would make again for a special occasion.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was good -- not great, not particularly memorable, but solidly good. If I made it again I would make sure to use a shallow gratin dish or shallow baking pan, otherwise the milk only comes up half way in the 13x9x2" dish and cooks the bottom potatoes differently than the top potatoes which aren't simmering in the milk. The other thing I would do next time is to take off the foil much earlier so the top could brown to a nicer color.

Great recipe -- easy to make. 2 Cups of milk seemed to be too much. Would make again with less milk. Nice texture.

Tried this out before Thanksgiving to make sure it was a go. My husband, who isn't a vegetable guy, liked it quite well. I thought it was beautiful while not being too heavy on the yams. Will take it to the Thanksgiving feast as my contribution. I will make it ahead of time, up until the point where you add the heavy cream. I will do that at the host's house, and finish baking the casserole there. I did't have fresh Thyme so I put in 1 teaspoon of dry. Also, I happend to have an orange sitting there, so zested the rind and added it to the heavy cream and heated before finishing the casserole, as the recipe indicted. Was very good and very pretty.
