This is O.K. Husband likes it and will eat the rest. Did the whole thing according to recipe Except did like another reviewer did and halved the sugar and used 1/4 cup dark rum in the sauce. The sauce still turned out well and still very sweet. We both looked at each other, while eating it and both declared " It's kind of like eating a Cinnamon Bun in a bowl. Going to look for another recipe.

Delicious! I didn't have cinnamon challah, so I used plain challah and before I added the eggs to the custard, I spiced the milk/cream/sugar mixture with lots of cinnamon, a few dashes of ground cloves, 1/4 tsp of salt, and the zest of 1 orange. (I only used 1.5Cups of sugar, per other reviewers suggestions, and it was plenty sweet.) I then added the eggs and rum-soaked raisins (bring 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice, 1/4 cup rum, 1 Tbsp of sugar, and 1/2 cup of water to simmer, add raisins, and simmer for 20 minutes to plump.). Soaked the bread in a mixing bowl for 20 minutes, stirring every once in a while. Dumped mixture into a cooking-sprayed 7-quart Dutch Oven and baked as directed. Served it with the Spiced Rum sauce (with double the rum, a dash of salt, and some extra vanilla) and vanilla ice cream. All 11 dinner guests loved it!

I have made this half a dozen times and have varied it with success each time. Its my basic bread pudding recipe now. Last time added sliced apples on the botton and sliced almonds on top. I used good white bread instead of cinnamon. grate a bit of nutmeg in. some almond extract sometimes. sometimes some rum that I soak the raisins in. Have prepped overnight and also just hours before.

This recipe was good but not amazing for me. Maybe I messed something up, I'm not sure. My husband thought it was simply "OK". I followed the recipe exactly, cooked it even longer than stated but it was very runny in the middle and burning on the edges which was driving me crazy. It actually tasted better the next day when I reheated it. I will probably try it again but not sure what to change if I cook it much longer it will just burn on the edges.

The recipe is fantastic!! Everyone was fighting over the pudding. After reading the other reviews, the only modification I made was to cut back to the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and not the whole 2 cups. This was the perfect sweetness for me.

Brought this to a dinner party and it was a hit! Made it spontaneously, so had to use what was on hand. Recipe is very forgiving. Made the following substitutions: - Italian bread instead of cinnamon raisin - Used clear rum instead of spiced - Used 2 1/2 cups of 2% milk and one can of sweetened condensed milk. - used 1/2 cup less sugar - added raisins soaked in rum, as one of the reviewers suggested - added 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash each of allspice, ground clove, nutmeg

Great recipe! I've made it exactly as written, and it is so rich and fabulous. I've also adapted heavily - orange scented cranberies for raisins, Grand Marnier for rum, and added toasted pecans - this variation is also really tasty.

I have made this recipe about four times now. I only had bread pudding once before in my life before I attempted to make it. I must say that I have become a very popular cook in my rather large social circle, and everyone loves this recipe. I act like I have been doing it for years, but the truth is, I selected it because I had a loaf of raisin bread lying around and needed to do something with it. This is probably one of the easiest recipes ever to make. Wanna be a star? Make this!

Substituted egg nog for both the whole milk and whipping cream, reduced sugar to one cup and increased vanilla to one tablespoon. Soaked a very dense loaf of raisin bread for 5 hours in the egg nog mixture and turned the top pieces over exposing the marinaded sides just before baking it. Baked it for 65 minutes. The top came out golden brown and a bit crispy. Picture perfect. Also used the egg nog in place of whipping cream for the sauce. Everyone liked it including "experts" from New Orleans, but beware...the caloric count is outrageous.

THE BEST BREAD PUDDING EVER!!!! So easy to make and truly incredible. My husband said it is the best dessert he has ever tasted. He is literally looking over my shoulder as I type this chanting to "make it again!" I was a little hesitant of the spiced rum sauce because I despise desserts/sauces that taste like alcohol, but this was nothing of the sort. It tasted like warm caramel and was out of this world. If you are even considering this dessert, you should try it. you will not be unhappy.

This recipe is so quick and easy, and it never ceases to please everyone. It travels well, because it can be mixed and covered, then baked at your destination. This is the kind of desert you can't help having seconds of. Since we don't use golden raisins often, I usually just purchase cinnamon raisin bread and forgo the golden raisins.

Holy Moly! This was my first attempt at bread pudding and WOW! Tasted like I've been whipping it up for years. Easy, easy to make. Double the rum sauce and don't overcook it as it gets a little stretchy. Added a tsp or two of cinnamon to the egg-milk mix. Fantastico!

What a delicious recipe! I have always loved bread pudding, but this is the first time I've made it, and I'm so glad I found this recipe. I just used a good quality sweet french bread and added some cinnamon, and I used regular raisins. I also baked the pudding in a warm water bath and let it set up in the warm water for a few minutes after it came out of the oven. It didn't collapse and was nice and moist, but not at all runny.

I made this a few days ago on a bread pudding craving, and it was wonderful! A little runny on the bottom, but I've never made it before (maybe it's always like that?). But other than the liquid on the bottom, it was DELICIOUS! Too sweet to use with the sauce, which I thought tasted not enough like rum and too much like brown sugar (And I don't drink!). Will definitely be making this one again, probably with less sugar. It says 12 servings, but in my house it was more like three! We all loved it.

This was not only the best bread pudding I have ever made it was the best bread pudding i ever ate. I was skeptical about the sauce because when I tasted it it reminded me of Apple Pie which was not the taste I was hoping for but the sauce was actually amazing with the pudding and topped with a little whipped cream. WOW. Also, I didn't put it in the fridge for 2 hours because I didn't have time and it turned out great!

I have now made this recipe three times, and served it to at least 12 different people - they all love it!! My son, who never eats dessert came back for seconds! I have "tweaked" it a little, using ordinary rum rather than spiced, and adding a little cinnamon and nutmeg to perk up thye main dish. Once I also added some apple slices. I add raisins or currants - always marinated in rum!!!

Turned out so fabulous! My husband immediately wanted seconds. I used a metal pan instead of glass, so I cooked it for 50 minutes instead of 1 hr and 15 minutes (in a convection oven). And I only soaked the bread for 1 hr and 15 minutes. Moist and delicious, will definitely make this again.

I'd been looking for a good basic recipe for bread pudding (read: without lots of fiddly ingredients), and this one totally fit the bill. The basic bread pudding is hearty and comforting and not too sweet. It heats up as excellent "french toast" leftovers the next day (if anything's left, which is unlikely). But the rum sauce really makes this dish outstanding! My guest were fighting over the sauce pitcher! I halved the recipe for a small St. Patrick's Day dinner party--easy peasy and a huge hit. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this twice, and it is the one I will always make. I use cinnabon bread and this last time I forgot the vanilla - but it was fine without it. I skipped the rum sauce (it is VERY rich) and put ice cream on top. This is such a wonderful recipe, you will not be disappointed!

Fantastic! Made a double batch as we were feeding about 16, had plenty leftovers for people to take home (which they did). It was sooooo moist! I have a convection oven; it baked for only 45 min. which surprised me. The rum sauce was, oh so good! This is a keeper.

This recipe is wonderful- it's been my Christmas dessert for several years now and everyone loves it. Be sure to cook it long enough or it can be a bit sloppy in the middle.

This bread pudding is so delicious... I cut down the recipe and made only two individual bread puddings in ramekins using Hungarian Cinnamon Bread from the Farmer's Market.

This recipe was the winner in an informal bread pudding bake-off at work! The modifications I made were to decrease the sugar to 1.5 cups and to add 3/4 teas. of Penzey's cake spice to both the pudding and the sauce. I ended up baking it for about 1.5 hours. You won't be disappointed, it's very good.

Simply amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For those searching for an extraordinary finish to any meal with a simple recipe this is it. It received rave reviews by everyone at the dinner party I attended which I was responsible for preparing and bringing the desert. Even the non bread pudding eaters were very pleased with the dish. The Sara Lee Cinimon raisin bread suggestion works wonderfully and the rainins were just perfect (it looked like a lot of raisins while I was preparing the bread). I used the full amount of sugar listed in the recipe and had no complaints. This is a wonderful dish for transporting (with the sauce separate) as it holds its temperature well. The sauce held up very well thru preparing it the night before, refrigerating and reheating. A must try if you like bread pudding!!!!!!!!! The rum sauce I used was: 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup whipping cream 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar Pinch of salt 2 tablespoons dark rum (Makes about 1 cup): Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cream, sugar and salt. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Stir in rum. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat over low heat, stirring constantly.)

I own a restaurant and made this for dessert one evening. Absolutely rave reviews, continued compliments on best bread pudding customers had ever had. For a shortcut, I used Sara Lee cinnamon swirl bread for one batch and then Sara Lee Cinnamon Raisin for the other. Absolutely fabulous. Definitely must have the rum sauce, it makes the dish. I had some rum sauce left over so I used it as a caramel sauce and served it over spiced applesauce cake which was also wonderful.

Very easy and very good. I prefer a simple bread pudding, so omitted the raisins. Made it once, per the recipe, but my goodness was it SWEET! Too sweet for our house, actually. The second time I made it, less than a week later, I reduced the sugar in the pudding and in the sauce by half, and it was just right. Quality bread is a key ingredient. I used a basic ciabatta instead of the sweeter, softer cinnamon breads that were suggested. Great flavor, more toothsome.

Delicious and so very easy! The bread pudding is perfect by itself but overwhelming with the rum sauce. I used cinnamon raisin bread as suggested by a previous reviewer. I also added lots of pecans and 3/4 of a Granny Smith apple to balance out the sweetness. Will try it with a lemon sauce next.

It was great, he could only say that he absoultely loved it. The recipe makes a lot but sure enough, the next day it was finished. Next time I'll add pecans and one or two less eggs.

I'm tempted to say that I'd never make this again simply because I can't have it in my refrigerator without trying to eat some every hour on the hour. It's VERY good with the Cinnamon Swirl bread from Trader Joe's (don't use the whole loaf) and 1/2 c. less sugar. I also added toasted chopped pecans. I combined all the eggs, cream, etc. the night before, then assembled it the night of my dinner party. Be sure not to let the rum sauce boil as it becomes a hard glob w/ butter separated.

This dish was totally awesome. I've never made bread pudding, and made it for 40 people for the first time...a New Orleans jazz night. People said that it was the best they had ever tasted. Although I did use the delicious rum sauce on top of it, people said it was rich enough to hold up on its own without the sauce. It's an artery-clogging, blood-sugar raising sin of a dessert, but what a way to go!

Used bakery raisin bread with chunky, streusel-like topping, added packaged tropical fruit bits for a Caribbean dinner. Turned out very well. Lucky I've learned to check and stir bread puddings to prevent surface burning; this was actually done in under 30 minutes. Extremely well received with the spiced rum sauce; the accompanying spiced rum punch, including Grand Marnier, pineapple and orange juices, probably didn't hurt. I like to serve dessert sauces warm in a fondue pot to keep them from hardening. The presentation impresses, too.

I didn't like this recipe, although my boyfriend and his friends loved it. The recipe was very easy, but the ratio of custard to bread was too high in my opinion, so the bread was way too sloppy.

Wonderfully rich bread pudding. 2 cups of sugar is just a little to sweet for our tastes so I'll cut the sugar the next time I make it. As seems to be the normal for this site, I use the recipe as a springboard and include what I had in the pantry. I had no vanilla, so used almond instead; then thought "what the hey, I'll throw in some toasted almonds too". Was wonderful served warm with vanilla ice cream. I'll make it more than once over the holidays.

Bread pudding ranks among my favourite comfort foods and this version is beyond fabulous. I reduced the amount of bread slightly, as I like bread pudding decidedly custardy, and I added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg to the egg-milk mixture. Rich and and incredibly self indulgent, but they were definitely calories worth eating. Gorgeous! I may try it again, adding some sliced pears and ginger to the melange, just for variety. The spicy rum sauce (which I also added nutmeg to)is the perfect accompaniment and is so good, I suspect I would eat it poured over shredded cardboard.

ok....YUM! I'm making this for the THIRD time tonight because my dad doesn't have any teeth and this is apparently his favorite thing to eat that doesn't require him to put in his his silly fake ones. :) Anyhow...great recipe. More custard-ey than most bread puddings, but if that ain't yer thing...let it sit in the fridge overnight (post-bake) and try it again the next day. A more dense consistency, but still all moist and yummy. The spiced sauce is butt-rubbin' good and i did git a tad creative with it the second time around. i used Malibu rum (coconut flavored)instead and to compliment the change in the sauce, i added a layer of sliced bananies and some coconut in between the bread mix...(which i divided. duh.) so, go bake some. it's deeelish. and it's gittin' cold outside. and who cares about all the heavy cream. fat satisfies! :p
