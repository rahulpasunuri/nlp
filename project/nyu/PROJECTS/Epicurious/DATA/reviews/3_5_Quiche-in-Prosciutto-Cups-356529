Even with omitting the salt I found this way too salty. Tasty - but salty. Also my egg filling leaked out of my prosciutto cups. Not the end of the world but seemed to defeat the purpose.

I made this for Easter last year, and it has already received numerous requests for brunch this year. Like others, I omitted the olives, and it was wonderful. I also covered it with fresh Parmesan cheese.

Very popular! I used a combination of chive cheddar and sun dried tomatoes, and they turned out very well. Wrapping the prosciutto around the muffin tins took a little finesse, though.

This is an extremely salty dish, but fun to make for a brunch with friends.

These are brilliant! Fast, easy and pretty! I followed the recipe, but like so many others, ditched the olives and rosemary. I tested the recipe with a variety of flavors, modeled after quiche: mushrooms and scallions with parm.; pepper jack; and sun dried tomatoes with parm. All delicious. Will continue experimenting. These would be great for a brunch, and I suspect that they would hold up reasonably well (chilled) for a picnic. Way more fun than the standard egg fare.

I loved this recipe. I made it for a bridal tea and when I tested the recipe, I thought the brand of prosciutto I bought was too salty and the olives were not necessary. I also don't like rosemary with eggs and didn't here. Also, I learned that spraying the pan was really important. When I made it for the tea, I used a different brand of prociutto, eggs from my chickens, left out the salt and used chopped chives and just a little grated parmesan on top. Wow! The ladies loved this dish and were so happy that we made a recipe book as a party favor. Several have told me they have made it to raves. I lined the mini tins a day ahead and wrapped in plastic and filled and baked them on the day of the event without any problems.

I should have listed to the other reviews and not added any salt or the olives. Next time I would add hashbrowns to cut back on the saltiness. Still a fantastic idea.

I won't rate this recipe, as I did not follow it exactly as written. I liked the idea of mini-quiche in prosciutto, in theory, but the idea of black olives (not a huge fan) combined with rosemary turned me away at first. I came back to this to use up some left-over prosciutto and a little greek yogurt, and delightfully, the changes I made still turned out lovely little quiche. Rather than black olives, I substituted chopped roasted red pepper, and rather than rosemary, I used about a tablespoon (and then some) of chopped fresh basil. At the base of the prosciutto, before adding the egg mixture, I sprinkled a pinch of blended shredded cheese (I think it was parm, mozz, and pecorino). Altogether, I got 12 (not 8) quiche, and still cooked them for 12 minutes. So easy, I'll definitely be making this again.

So easy. They're a hit. Make sure to get high quality prosciutto sliced thin then cut each slice length-wise--makes the cup size manageable.

This is a little difficult to make an attractive appetizer. Must have thin prosciutto to fit in the cups, but it was a hit at our healthy dinner club.

Fantastic idea. I made this for the concierge lounge in the hotel that I work for. Changed it a little....I used ham instead of the prosciutto and omitted the olives and rosemary and added Swiss cheese..about 2 oz. It was fantastic and not as salty. The ham didn't crisp up as much as the prosciutto did but still held the quiche well. Will make again.

I just made this for the first time today - practicing for a bridal shower Saturday, they are a big hit among everyone I have enlisted to try them. I omitted the salt, which was an excellent tip, there is no need for it. Next time I will add a few more olives so that flavor is a tad more prominent. I really liked this, it was quick and easy and I will be using this often!

Delicious! Definitely omit the salt -- I eat a good amount of salt and this was way too much for me as is. Next time, will add a bit of cheese...

When using big muffin cups, did you have to dbl. the filling?

Rating: 4
Oh an for those with a hard time tearing apart the proscuitto, it's tricky. Just make sure the proscuitto is cold when you do it, the warmer it gets the harder it is to split without tearing it. I just use a steak knive to cut in half, then gently lift each side. If you tear it, its no biggie you can just try to layer it in the bottom of the muffin cup. The egg mix will hold it all together once you cook it.

These are fantastic and so easy to make. I am on South Beach and this recipe is perfect for that! I switch things up and don't use the black olives all the time. My favorite is with Rotel tomatoes and some sauteed mushrooms. But you can pretty much put anything in them that you want, just as you would a regular quiche. I definitely suggest omitting the salt. These are always a big hit for Sunday brunch at my house. 4 forks!!

YUMMM....made this for a brunch this morning for a group of ladies. So good, so easy. Two of them asked for the recipe.

Made this for Christmas eve. Did not add salt - good advice from other reviewers. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I, too, had a hard time not ripping the prosciutto - any tips? I made this a second time for a brunch. I added feta cheese, eliminated the rosemary and sprinkled a bit of aged cheddar on top. Very nice. Will make again.

With the exception of the trouble I experienced peeling away the prosciutto from the separating papers, this recipe was simple and delicious! Definitely no need to add salt as the prosciutto is already salty enough. We skipped the olives and added green onions and a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. Served with the Apple and Endive salad for a nice, light (but satisfying) meal. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Endive-and-Apple-Salad-351034

I made this using full size muffin cups and a whole piece of prosciutto, and it came out beautifully. The only thing that I had to change was the cooking time.

How easy! How excellent! I made these for two holiday parties and they were gone so fast. Everyone raved. I'll definitely be making them again.

We do cooking competitions at our house to help each of us learn new recipes. My 17 year old step daughter found this one and won the competition with it. She did mushrooms instead of olives and chopped them really small and cooked them off 1st so that they did not make it to liquidy. She made them for a family party later and 2 peopel have written us to request the recipe. Super easy.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a hit. Great for celiacs who can't have real quiche. I substituted the olives for sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. The rosemary is a must!

This recipe was very easy. The kids were really able to help which is always nice. Tasted great too. Kid approved! PS - took another reviewers advice and skipped the added salt.

This was disappointing. I made them twice and both times, the filling seeped through the prosciutto. I omitted the salt as others suggested which was just as well as they were very salty. Maybe you could fiddle with them but there are other appetizers on this site which were far better.

This is a simple and elegant appetizer. The extra salt in unnecessary but the rest of the ingredients are spot on. People will be impressed with the presentation and it will be the first item you will run out of at your party, so double the recipe.

The great thing about any quiche dish is that you can easily make it all your own with whatever you have on hand. I love this lowcal version with greek yogurt & egg whites! My family (guinea pigs) enjoyed them yesterday and I can't wait until I serve them to friends on NYE. I will omit the olives for a few and keep the salt in. For others I will have olives but no added salt. Chopped broccoli, asparagus, onions are just a few veggies I'm going to try one day, as well!

DO NOT ADD ANY SALT! THANKS to the everone's suggestions, to bump up the flavor a notch, I added a heaping 1/4t of Grey Poupon Dijon mustard and several dashes of hot sauce (I used Melinda's Habenero sauce because it's what we had onhand but, Tabasco or another hot sauce would do). I also sprinkled a little shredded cheddar cheese on top. Everyone loved them. Would definitely make again with these changes.

I made it per the recipe, it was good but not great. Too salty, rosemary and olives too strong. But, this is a great recipe to tweak. What I did to make it great: omit the rosemary, swap yogurt for milk, add spinach, add mozzarella (I noticed someone else suggesting parm cheese - bad idea; this dish is already so salty and parm would only add to the issue). Another idea is to crack an egg over veg so you get a nice yolk. Bon appetit!

My fiance and I both loved them. I should have looked at the reviews ahead of time to cut out the salt, but they were still tasty. I also used chopped sundried tomatoes instead of olives. Delicious and definitely one I would make again!

Way too salty and rosemary is very strong even though I only put about half. Trid it again with regular ham, les salty. Will make again and substitute rosemary with chive and puch it up with Dijon and some tabasco.

Proscuitto was crispy and held quiche well, but given the wonderful options that appear each year, not one I'll keep. Just not flavorful enough or exceptional. I wish I'd added more rosemary. I did add the olives, but even with the amount suggested, seemed bland.

This recipe has potential. The cups look good (though mine weren't as pretty as the picture), and it's simple to make. Definitely cut down or omit the salt. They were so salty that we didn't serve them (I doubled the recipe -- and the salt, of course -- so that might have been part of the issue. I think that the prosciutto would lend enough salt. I will definitely try them again with less/no salt. I like the idea of sharp cheddar or parmesan on the top.

I made this for a cocktail party, and they dissapeared before everything else at the table. Next time, I will no put salt at all, they were a little bet salty for my taste. Wonderful recipe!

Outstanding and really quite simple. My gf is on a diet and for 27 calories the prosciutto might as well be bacon. I added a few sprinkles of extra sharp cheddar to the top of each before cooking.

Fab, really enjoyed it. Easy too. Next time I'd skip the salt. It was salty enough with the olives. Also, for what it's worth. I used a regular muffin pan and it worked fine. I possbly used a bit more ham.

I made these as a last-minute addition to the hot appetizer selection for an open house, and they disappeared before they could get cold. I also ommitted the olives but otherwise stayed true to the instructions. Would definitely make again.

Quick, easy, rich, and satisfying. I omitted the olives and sprinkled some shredded parmesan on top. They took longer to cook than indicated. Made these for breakfast as a test run. Will definitely make these the next time I entertain.
