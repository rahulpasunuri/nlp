I made this yesterday for valentines day, my husband loved it but it was just ok for me. I expected a lot more from all the work you do with the tomatoes. Next time I'll try making this in the summer when tomatoes are in season. I served the sauce with lemon pepper flavored angel hair pasta which was refreshing.

delicious, easy but a little oily: i would cut down on the amount used.

Delicious and easy -- I thought the chili pepper gave a nice punch.

I hate to say, my husband, who LOVES 'sgetti, did not like this. I don't care for red sauce much, so I can't say much about it, but it did seem a bit bland. This may be a good basic recipe, but I don't think I will try it again.

Good Basic Starter for sauce. I agree with Phoenix - needs to be doubled for serving four.

If you like ample sauce on your spaghetti than this recipe doesn't serve 4.
