This is a great grilled shrimp recipe. I usually grill with shells on, but only had peeled shrimp in the freezer. They were still awesome. I also forgot to take the cocktail sauce to the party. While the sauce is good, it was not missed. I will try it with shells on and serving the sauce next time.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The one glaring note that stood out above the rest is the overwhelming taste of lemons! There was no balance in this dish at all. I will stick with my beer- and herb-poached shrimp from Pierre Franey's The Seafood Cookbook ... a thousand times better!

Fantastic! I used 2 lb of 16-20 ct prawns and grilled them about 3-4 min each side. They were very tender and moist. We're a casual bunch so everyone just stood around the bowl and peeled and dipped together. Messy but tasty! A few pointers: half the cocktail sauce recipe is plenty, using only bottled horseradish is a time saver and more likely to be in the pantry, and overnight brining works well if that is more convenient.

Excellent and simple! Made these for July 4th BBQ. I brined the shrimp four about 6 hours, then used bamboo skewers when grilling the shrimp. I would recommend peeling the shrimp before you add the oil/chive mixture (otherwise it's a mess for the guests to peel). All our guests agreed that we didn't need the cocktail sauce as the shrimp were tasty without it. Delicious!

I made this twice. The first time I forgot to use the olive oil, lemon and chives. It was pretty good, but I think it is much better with it, which I remembered to add the second time. I broiled the shrimp in the shells but removed the shells before putting them in the olive oil mixture. Then I stirred them to coat and drained the rest before serving to keep it a little less messy. I served a group of friends and they loved it.

I made this Saturday night for a birthday dinner for my husband. It was incredible and all of our guests loved it. The only change I made is that I left the shrimp in the brine overnight and drained it the next morning. I left it in a bowl in the refrigerator until we grilled it that afternoon.

These brined shrimp were perfect! Not sure if it was the brining or the cooking in the shell or the combination, but these are fantastic! Yes, you could easily make half the cocktail sauce and have plenty. Enjoy.

The brine is the key to making this a great dish. After cooking and then adding to the olive oil mixture gives it excellent flavor...just remember you can add all kinds of great herbs. Served this for a clients Sunday luncheon with a mix green salad of fresh spinach and watercress, sliced avocado, korean pear slices and my favorite go to dressing...Hendriksons sweet italian olive oil and vinegar dressing. This is a keeper and really very easy.

Easy and yummy, a go-to for grilling shrimp. I recommend the brining technique, and I was surprised that I really liked the cocktail sauce. Having only had commercial sauces, I thought I just didn't like cocktail sauce. I sometimes combine this with the New Orleans BBQ shrimp recipe from this site.

This is now my "go to" shrimp appetizer. It really is so good. I will never serve plain boiled shrimp again. Make sure you leave the shells on as I believe that the shells plus the brining keep these plump and moist. I find most grilled shrimp ends up being dried out. Not these!

I made this for my family at one of our summer get-togethers and everyone loved it. I served it as the appetizer course and even though it's a little work to "peel & eat" it was fun and not one left. I didn't have the 8-10 count so I used 2 bags of 16/20 count and that worked well. I love the chive/lemon dressing at the end. Yummy!

The shrimp took a LOT of work to peel and clean but it WAS worth it! I served these as an appetizer at a dinner party and there wasn't a single one left at the end. I made the following changes: #1. I didn't have shallots so I left those out of the cocktail sauce and didn't miss them #2. I used 4 tbls of bottled horseradish since it was easier than using 1/2 fresh and 1/2 bottled #3. I used water-soaked-wooden skewers to cook the shrimp on the grill and prevent losing any #4. I left the chives off the of shrimp in the final olive oil coating (mostly so that my dad wouldn't try to pick them off)

We absolutely could not get enough! Indeed, the brining adds terrific plumpness to the shrimp, and I particularly love the olive oil treatment at the end. The cocktail sauce was perfect as well. This one cannot be improved upon!

Fantastic! Made this for a dinner party and they went so fast - everyone loved them even the kids! I can not believe what great flavor the brining brings out in the shrimp. They were so meaty and delicious.

Easy and fabulous. As suggested by others, made half the cocktail sauce & had plenty.

These were excellent. Fast, easy - great flavor. Good for quick family meal and impressive enough for company. Did not make the sauce, only the brined shrimp. Served the shrimp with Watermelon Rind Chutney from this site. Was excellent with the shrimp. Will definitely make this again whenever I can find prawns.

This is fantastic. I can tell I will be eating this all summer long. I used a Chipotle hot sauce (Frontera) and the smokey flavor complimented the grilled shrimp well. Also used two bamboo skewers per 4 shrimp - makes the grilling much easier. Think I would shed a tear if I lost one into the coals

This is a fantasic recipe! I made it for my mother in-laws 79th b-day party, I doubled the brine and oil/chives to accommodate 4 lbs of tiger prawns and it worked beautifully. I do think the cooking time is shorter on a gas BBQ. And I did have a lot of cocktail sauce left over, mainly becausethe shrimp was SOOO Tasty on its own.

Made this with some fresh headon shrimp. Followed the recipe. They turned out fabulous - I do not recommend any change. I was not sure the cocktail sauce would go with the grilled shrimp but they were great together. The brining is the trick. The shrimp were moist and supple.

Loved this recipe. I had never thought to brine the shrimp and I must say it was perfect! My husband says it is a keeper.

This was a great recipe. I made the shrimp according to the recipe but served it with guacamole instead of the cocktail sauce. I did it as a first course for a dinner party and it got rave reviews from my guests.

Wow - made these for the annual Labor Day Picnic - and whoosh - they were gone!!! I was asked several times for the recipe and many thought they were lobster tails - what a delicious and fun dish. I will say we have way more cocktail sauce leftover than I expected, next time I would make half the recipe!

I made this yesterday and this dish is absolutely delicious. The brining of the shrimp made them so sweet and succulent. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.

Really great - company worthy. Used fresh oregano (tons in the garden) and basil instead of chives. Almost don't need the cocktail sauce at all. In fact, the brined shrimp on its own has such a great flavor the olive oil mixture isn't totally necessary. But having both the olive oil & cocktail sauce was great to have for dipping options. Will make again!

My husband has declared this "the best way to cook shrimp...ever". He grew up in coastal SC, and eaten his fair share of peel and eat shrimp, so his approval was a pretty big deal. We actually prefer medium sized shrimp over the really big ones, so I just reduced the time in the brine a bit and they were perfect. I also added some crumbled up bay leaves to the brine, and instead of using lemon, oil and chives to finish them, I used lemon, oil and Old Bay. I didn't have time to let the cocktail sauce sit for any longer than 45 minutes, but it was still very good and I look forward to using it on another batch of these soon. Frankly, I ate about half of mine with the sauce and half without, because I couldn't decide which way was tastier. My only regret was that I only made 1/4 of the recipe because I was just serving it as a starter for the two of us,

While I did not make the cocktail sauce, the brined shrimp was remarkable. I was searching for a flavorful recipe for grilled shrimp to serve with sesame noodles and this was perfect. The brining process made the shrimp succulent and tender, while the flavor imparted by the brine was mild. To better accompany the noodles, I tossed the shrimp with a mixture ginger, garlic, fresh cilantro and sesame oil prior to grilling and the results were amazing. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

Excellent appetizer. My guests raved about the dish and everyone asked for the recipe. The shrimp were incredibly plump and moist. Prep time was quick. I think I had the shrimp cleaned in about 15 minutes and since I was using 10-15 count shrimp I had closer to 40 shrimp to get ready. I definitely would make this dish again for an appetizer or even a weekend supper. It's substantial enough to be a full meal and besides the brine cooks so quickly. The cocktail sauce was also delicious. Will definitely make that again even if it's just for peel and eat shrimp.
