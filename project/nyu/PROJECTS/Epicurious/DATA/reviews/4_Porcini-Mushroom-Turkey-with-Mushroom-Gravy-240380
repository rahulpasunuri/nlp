Perhaps the finest Turkey and Gravy recipe I have had the pleasure to have tested. Many times Watson and I have been disappointed by over- indulgent descriptions bordering on the pompous but this one, my friends, this one is has the Queen's blessing. No finer a gravy have I made..... I might point out that it is important to have room temperature butter for a slightly hardened butter has a clumpy effect that then darkens the skin of even the most sturdy bird.... an obvious clue I should have seen coming! All in all this is a wonderful recipe and thoroughly recommended!

Pretty incredible! I cook a lot, and like to make a splash with my guests. I've made a lot of turkeys, and this one got the most favorable reviews of them all. People couldn't stop talking about the gravy all night. I did it pretty much by the book (exchanged shitakes for criminis), and even slightly overcooked the turkey itself (cooked at a friends house, and wasn't familiar enough with convection). For the gravy only added a little white truffle butter to enrich at the end (expensive, but worth it), and a splash of Calvados. Wow.

Absolutely a smash hit at Thanksgiving dinner last night - everyone is still raving about the rich flavor of the gravy and the moist quality of the turkey's white meat. Normally our family does not *do* gravy, as it's a salty, thick and generally flavorless mess; this gravy was amazing - the porcini mushrooms added such a richness. I replaced the crimini with bella mushrooms and used a muscato white wine (too sweet for table drinking wine, but perfect for adding a touch of sweetness to the gravy without overwhelming.)

Our best turkey ever! Amazing flavors. I did brine it (per Alton Browns recipe), used a fresh organic turkey, and added some aromatics to the cavity (apple, orange, onion, and crystallized ginger). I cooked it at 500 degrees for 30 minutes, then turned it down to 350 and cooked until my thermometer gave me 161 in the breast. Let it set for 30 minutes while finishing everything else. Every single person said it was the best, most moist turkey they have ever had.

I followed the recipe with a kosher turkey last yr and it turned out to be the one of the best tasting turkey we've tasted. I am planning on making this again this yr. Even my mother in law who isn't a big fan of eating ended up eating 2 plates of this turkey.

Made mushroom butter with 1 change: didn't have dried porcini. Instead, I chopped up 1 cup of fresh crimini mushrooms with the butter and herbs. The turkey was very moist and not overly-brown. The gravy was made with 1 change also, (didn't have the mushroom water and porcini), instead, I added 8oz sliced shiitake mushrooms to the crimini. The gravy was my favorite part......and just like someone said below: of course it's good - there is a whole cup of cream in it!

This turkey was a great centerpiece to our Thanksgiving dinner this year. The bird was perfectly moist and delectable. I forgot to purchase mint, but it wasn't missed. Also, this gravy is ridiculously good and will be the standard gravy used in any recipe for the rest of my life. This gravy is so good it converted non-gravy lovers.

Made this turkey this year (usually make the Ancho-chili turkey). THis one turned out beautifully - looks and taste! In the mushroom "butter", I actually made it with olive oil )about 1/2 cup) b/c I saw america's test kitchen recommended olive oil rather that butter for a turkey marinade/rub. I left out the mint in all parts as I'm not a fan of it and it was great without. I did the mushroom olive oil the night before, so it perhaps soaked in better to the meat?? I also made the gravy beforehand and did not sue any of the drippings b/c I wanted an easier time before dinner. the gravy was incredible - but what isn't with 1 cup of whipping cream in it??

I used this recipe for the second year in a row, and it is outstanding in every respect. I used a fresh turkey, and the bird came out totally moist and perfect! I doubled the gravy and had plenty for leftovers. It is THE BOMB! If you are a mushroom lover, this is the absolute, end-all gravy. Just to die for! The best turkey recipe I have ever done, and I will be doing it again. And AGAIN!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year to cook my 15lb organic turkey. Being a Turkey amateur, I followed this recipe to a T and found it very easy to follow and the overall result was fantastic, everyone loved it. The gravy took a little longer to make than I anticipated and it was lighter in color but the taste was great. Definitely would use this recipe again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious and everyone loved the gravy...I had 15 guests and really should have doubled or tripled the gravy recipe!! I made a 12lb turkey and followed the recipe exactly. The stock was easy and delicious and the mushroom butter really kept the turkey moist. Will definitely make this again next year

As others have said, the gravy is INSANELY good! I did the whole recipe, including the butter rub for the turkey, and it was delicious. I've used the seasoning-under-the-skin technique for years, and it is by far the key to a moist and juicy bird. I did baste the turkey a few times during the last hour to help browning a bit. The mushroom herb butter is very nicely flavored. And I can't say enough about the gravy - only that I wish there was more of it! Don't get me wrong - the recipe makes plenty. It's just that my family loved it so much, that all that was left after Thanksgiving dinner was a scant cup full! What can I say? We like everything on the plate slathered with this incredible sauce. This gravy is a MUST for mushroom lovers. Truly scrumptious!

I'll admit I didn't bother with all parts of this recipe, so really this review is only about the gravy. Wow, was it good! I've had many compliments on it from some pretty serious foodies (my sister-in-law gave it the thumbs up, which is truly the ultimate compliment!)I just roasted a turkey as I usually do, and added the gravy. It was fab!

I made this turkey last thanksgiving and it was awesome. The gravy was so flavorful and the turkey was very moist. I talked about changing the recipe this year to try something different and it was shot down!! Looks like I will be making this again.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving 2008. I bought a 20 lb bird, and had 17 guests. Most of the time I have tons of left over turkey. This time practically the entire bird was "gobbled" up. The gravy tastes like rich mushroom soup. Everyone is still talking about it. This one is a keeper. I would NOT change an ingredient!

This was amazingly delicious! The turkey was moist and delicious - and I even cooked it longer than the recipe, for I had a larger turkey than it called for. I did not put the porcini mushrooms in the butter mixture, but I did use them for the gravy - which was to die for! Though, my gravy color was lighter than in the picture - in any case it was sensational! Will definitely make again!

This is the last Thanksgiving turkey recipe I will ever need. The mushrooms were perfect, I made mushroom stuffing with sausage, and the gravy was devine. RAVE reviews including best turkey we have ever had.

We made this Turkey with a large group at Thanksgiving. Everyone LOVED it and it made converts of those who used to hate gravy. We loved it so much that we made it for just our family of 4 at Christmas three weeks later. It was easier and quicker the second time around and every bit as good. Makes for great left overs and wonderful Turkey pop pies. I think we have a new family tradition!

My husband & I made this recipe for Christmas--just the two of us, for two. What can I say? We were lonely for a turkey. Anyhow, it, along with the mushroom gravy, and three-mushroom dressing were WAY too much work for two people. Even though we prepped the dressing & stock for two days before, it was still 2 1/2 solid hours of work for 2 people to get this to the table, and we had to drop the veg & potatoes off the menu because we didn't have time to make them. We followed the recipe exactly and our 10 lb. turkey was overdone (180 degrees) after 1:40 minutes, so I definitely agree with others about the cooking time. If was still nice & moist though. Anyhow, we were so tired after spending the entire afternoon in the kitchen that we really didn't enjoy this turkey, gravy or dressing much Christmas evening. The good news, however, is that the same menu, with no work, tasted fabulous the next day! This recipe does change the flavor of the turkey, so be prepared for that. It is also a fabulous gravy that I'll do again. We enjoyed the dressing, but there are others we like better.

I brined my turkey for less than 24hrs. then cooked the turkey exactly as indicated by the recipe. My family loved it! With the gravy, I did the same amount of mushrooms but I used crimini, shitake and oyster, it was the best gravy I've ever had! Will do this again for x-mas!

We cooked an 18lb turkey on our bar-b-que rotisserie for 2 1/2 hours and the turkey was perfect - so I agree with everyone - reduce the cooking time! This turkey is perfect with the three-mushroom dressing with Prosciutto!

I cooked an 18 lb. turkey for almost 4 hours. The temperature reading was 180 when I took it out of the oven. Nonetheless, this turkey was very moist. I agree with a recent reviewer the cooking times should be reduced. Considering no basting and my overcooking the turkey, it was unbelievably moist. (Used an organic, free-range turkey.)

I love Mushrooms and found the gravy delicious however, I found that your cooking times are off by a lot - these trukey's cook faster than the time given, especially when you have had your oven going all day with other things prior to the turkey going in. It was a little dry which surprised me considering the amount of butter "under the skin" but still alvery good recipe I will try again.

This recipe was absolutely excellent. Each step worked as advertised and the overall result was top notch!

The turkey was okay. However, the gravy was probably one of the best gravies I've ever had- full of flavor, perfect silky texture. This may become our annual Thanksgiving dinner!

This turkey was delicious. I only added 3/4 of a stick of butter to all the rest of the butter ingredients and still had plenty to go all over my 18 lb bird. After letting in rest for an hour after cooking it just oozed juice when I cut it. I use fresh free range turkeys and I think that really makes a difference. The mushroom gravy was wonderful too.

This was probably our best turkey ever. My friend Richard and I are always anxious for the November issue. The 2006 issue was a disappintment, but 2007 more than made up. We stayed pretty true to recipe using an organic turkey(s). I've done 'under the skin' butters before and love the technique. We also used imported porcini from the Valtellina region of northern Italy region that have a very distinctive, almost smoky taste.

My friends and husband really love this recipe - the gravy that comes from the porcini mushrooms is delicious. Definitely try this recipe!

This was a disappointment for me. The flavors under the skin just didn't work and the turkey was drier than it should have been. I usually brine the turkey first, and didn't this time. The gravy, however, was FANTASTIC! I used shiitake mushrooms, but that was the only change I made. It was particularly good with Three-Mushroom Dressing with Prosciutto. The gravy and dressing will become staples.
