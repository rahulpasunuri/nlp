First, I knew I wasn't just going to add the onions/peppers/garlic/spices to the soup. I sauteed 'em up first. I used the recommended 7 cups of liquid: 3 water, 4 chicken stock. Bland. Salted, and reapplied the same amount of spices one more time. This flavored the sucker up. Threw in some cayene and it was good to go. Next time, I'll try using curry instead of turmeric. These are simple tweaks, just to kick up the flavor for those of us who need it. At its heart, it's a simple, healthy recipe that look less than 30 minutes to make. For dinner on a colda** rainy night in SF, how can you beat it? And cheap too!

This soup is delicious. I did saute the onions and garlic in olive and I used half chicken broth, but you need to try it. My husband who doesn't share my love of lentil soup was seduced by the aromas coming out of the kitchen. He ate this soup for lunch and dinner today.

Correction to advice offered on 1/29/10. I just read a recipe from The New York Times which says 1 lb. of red lentils fill 2 1/8 cups. This makes more sense to me.

To answer the recent question about cup vs. weight measurements (A Cook on 11/03/09), you need about a cup of red lentils to make this recipe. Use a search engine if you don't wish to invest in a small kitchen scale. You'll find that 1 lb. of red lentils yields 1 1/2 cups. There are other recipes for red lentil soup on this web site that use cup measurements; consulting them would help in answering your question. Weights are preferred by many cooks, especially bakers, since they are more exacting. Unfortunately, American book publishers continue to resist using them in cookbooks because they believe American home cooks would be intimidated by recipes that measure ingredients by weight rather than volume. FWIW I loved this recipe as is when I first tried it, but found the lack of fat boring the second time around. The recommendations for sautéing onions and spices, especially are good, though you should also try the recipe for red lentil soup with spiced oil.

I make this for a gingerbread-house- building party we do every year for the vegetarian entree. I use veggie stock, curry instead of tumeric, and saute the onion with the spices before adding to the soup. This NYE, I'm doing lite eats before we head to a party, so I am doing a chorizo and fennel in phyllo and this soup, so I'll add a little fennel with the onion when I saute it to tie the two dishes together.

I also sauteed the onion and spices separately , then added the lentils. Another addition of mine , was a finely diced red chili which added flavor. This is a wonderfully satisfying fall vegetarian dish.

Really boring dish. Waste of time and red lentils, and red lentils are cheap out here.

can someone please tell me how many cups there are in 3/4th of a lb of lentils? Seriously, why do they use weight measures here.

I made it exactly as written, and it was rather tasteless if healthy.

I loved this. The only reason why I didn't give it 4 forks is because I thought it needed more liquid. But oh my goodness, is this one a keeper! I had no idea lentils were so absorbing! (They were totally out of red lentils at the market, so I used green ones.) I also took the advice of a fellow reviewer and added curry during the sautee of vegetables. Mmm Mmm Mmm.

I've made this recipe since I found it in an old Gormet issue over 10 years ago. I make it all the time. I just made and froze 32oz containers of it using 2lbs lentils (I just double the ingredients and quadruple the garlic). I have lots of soups with oils and fats, but this is the one without, and I love it! Cold or hot, it always warms me.

We've made this soup twice now having bought red lentils and not really knowing what to do with them. The method is extremely easy as described or you can make some flavor-boosting modifications such as using chicken or vegetable stock on place of the water, sauteing veggies and spices in a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a skillet to give them some color and bring out the essential oils in the spices. Add the sauteed veggies to the lentils and stock and simmer for the recommended amount of time. I highly recommend for quick, filling, healthy lunches or warming fall/winter dinners served with some crusty bread and hummus. This is also great topped with some thick and creamy plain yogurt, a dollop of sour cream or a bit of goat cheese. Also, instead of cayenne, we use a squirt or two of Srracha Hot Sauce often found at Thai or Vietnamese restaurants - a little heat with a lot of great flavor.

light and satisfying! to enhance flavor i used chicken broth, sauted the onions and garlic and then added the spices for ~30 seconds to pull out their flavor, and then added it all to the lentils. i halved the liquid and served the lentils over rice with hummus on side. delicious.

This is excellent soup! I fried the onions and garlic in olive oil as was suggested - much tastier. I also used a trick I learned in India: frying the spices with the onions and garlic to release the flavor. I used curry instead of tumeric which added a lot more flavor. Yum.

I have made this with the suggested variations several times and it is always a winner. I saute 6 cloves of garlic and onions together in olive oil and use chicken stock rather than water. I also added a slurp of olive oil and give it a bit of a rough whizz with the hand blender, not so that it is smooth, but to incorporate everything a bit.

I've made this soup a number of times after having it at the house of a friend who likes quick, healthful recipes. Great for lunches. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because it's nothing to knock your socks off--it's just good and nothing wrong with that. I agree that chicken broth would increase flavor, though I wouldn't waste really good homemade stock on the recipe. Adding fat would increase the flavor others miss--see the review of 3/05/02 re sautéing onions. And YES! red lentils are supposed to disintegrate--more like split peas than nice Le Puy (French, green) or little beady black lentils.

I must defend this recipe! Some reviewers are saying that the lentils turn to mush if you "overcook" them...red lentils are supposed to do that! It's better to use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water, and I reduce the quantity of liquid and serve it over rice instead of as a soup. Make it all the time, great healthy recipe.

Easy to make butI would make it with modifications: sorry, but it needs sea salt and flavoured broth (though it cuts out sodium if not used--also added extra garlic. Must be careful as those red lentil turn easily to mush if overcooked. didn't have scallions so I sauteed (olive oil) thinly sliced brussels sprouts at the end of cooking time--yum!

i made a similar soup; it's a cross between this soup and the other carrot soups (carrot + ginger; carrot + lemon) on this site. i sauteed the onion for about 10-15 minutes, partially with the garlic, added the coriander and cumin (doubled both), fried them a bit, then added carrots, lentils and chicken broth. i pureed the soup after everything had cooked down, and stirred in lemon juice before serving. it's delicious, and quite healthy.

This was a excellent soup. I used fat free chicken broth, it gives a good flavor, and also very healthy.

I thought the flaver was okay, It just didn't have any body to it. Chicken broth instead of water might add some substance. The main thing it has going for it is how healthy it is for you. On to the next recipe...

Very healthy,low-cal, fresh tasting. Use veg. or chicken broth or olive oil to improve the taste.

I've been making this regularly (mostly in winter)since recipe was published. Shortcut - chop carrots and red pepper in food processor. Great enhancer is a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil drizzled over individual servings.
