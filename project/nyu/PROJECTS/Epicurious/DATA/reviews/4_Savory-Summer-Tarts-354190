This is a fantastic recipe to use when having a party. You can make ahead and freeze if you're pressed for time. I also made one giant tart, which also impressed my guests to no end.

These were really fantastic. All the fillings were good and my guests really enjoyed them for a light lunch with a salad. The pea filling, as well as the tomato filling, were just a tad on the bland side, so if you like you might want to sprinkle on some fresh herbs after they bake. (basil would be nice...) A few issues though... I used 4 inch tart pans and I barely had enough pastry dough. I had to roll it a little thinner than I would like and some of them leaked b/c of it. I also was a little short on the custard mixture. Next time I make these, I will 1.5x the dough and egg mixture. And I added a couple extra lumps of crabmeat to the crab ones (b/c we don't skimp on crab around here!) I should add that I used whole wheat pastry flour for the shells and they turned out beautifully.

Yummy! My favorite was the crab one. Tarragon just always goes SO WELL with seafood... And I love shallots. My boyfriend loved the tomato and goat cheese one. I couldnt find any haricots verts (green beans?) at my store, so I subbed asparagus for those. The goat cheese really brought that one together. The pancetta one was also really delish! I'd make them all again!
