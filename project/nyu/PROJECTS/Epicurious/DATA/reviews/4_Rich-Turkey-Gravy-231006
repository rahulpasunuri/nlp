I have been making this gravy, along with the Brown Turkey Stock, for years. It is delicious, beautifully brown, and has never failed to be perfect. I substitute a bottle of champagne for an equivalent amount of the stock and use the extra stock for the dressing. Definitely a winner.

I was happy with the flavour of this recipe but not the color. It seemed obvious, since I had made the Brown Turkey Sauce ahead of time, and was okay with its colour, that the gravy would be brown. Not so! My wife tells me I should have added soy sauce to darken it, but what chef wants to listen to his wife when dominating the kitchen? Otherwise, the brown unused sauce makes for a great soup the following morning, the consistency of the gravy was good (although the amount of roux seemed ovewhelming, it didn't turn out to be so), and the flavour was excellent. But as my wife says, add soya if you want a browner gravy!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it did not come out very well. I made it again for Xmas (thinking that I had done something wrong) and while the gravy tasted better this time, it was pale brown (despite the browning of the parts and making a dark roux) and quite thin. I'm now looking for a new recipe for gravy but will probably use some bits of this recipe: making the stock ahead of time (with a lot less water!) with browned parts and using the dark roux.

We can never have too much turkey gravy at my Thanksgiving table, so this recipe is perfect. I have been making it every year. Do not stint on making the brown stock, and you will be richly rewarded. I allow the gravy to boil at the end until it reaches the thickness I want. This also enriches the flavor.

Best gravy I've had in all my Thanksgiving meals. This has become my signature dish during Thanksgiving. I'm asked to make this gravy even when someone else is responsible for making the turkey. This makes a lot of gravy so I just freeze the leftovers to use for other meals. Found the gravy to be a little thin so I add cornstarch in addition to the roux for extra thick gravy. Making the stock a few days ahead of time is a really big time saver. The stock is so flavorful that after you add the pan drippings, there isn't much additional seasoning needed.

Wonderful gravy! I made the brown turkey stock a week ahead and froze it---definitely worth the trouble to brown the turkey parts to mahogany brown. The stock was so flavorful and so beautifully brown that I made lots and lots of gravy without fear of ending up with something pale and tasteless. Also, having the stock made well ahead made for less chaos the last half-hour before dinner. It was delicious just as written, but you could add anything you fancy.

Best gravy I have ever had! I made the brown turkey stock the day before, then whipped the gravy together after the bird came out. Deglazed with a cup of dry sherry. Delicious!
