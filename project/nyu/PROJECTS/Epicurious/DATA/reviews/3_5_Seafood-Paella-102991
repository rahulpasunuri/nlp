Terrible waste of ingredients and my time! I read the reviews so I was expecting soggy rice. I followed the recipe except: I browned up the rice in the pan hopefully giving it a crunch effect, Used slightly less liquid (ratio 2:1 liquid to rice) and Cooked longer than time but checked the rice after 30 minutes to make sure it wasn't drying out. This basically tasted like chicken and rice that I could have cooked in 1/2 the time.

@Andrew and Cook From Boston - There is NOTHING wrong with doctoring a recipe and then posting your results. This is called COOKING. We all start with a base and adjust to our tastes/allergies/available ingredients. If it's so important to you that there be reviews of the recipes as written and you don't see one written, do it yourself. :) Negative comments like yours are the only comments here that are not useful. I cooked this very close to the recipe but eliminated peas and the squid and added the tiny scallops and lobster claws. Was quite good.

Rating: 0
Did anyone make this recipe as is? Every single review I am reading has changed the ingredients in a major way. Like the other cook from Mass said, if you didn't make the recipe as listed, DON'T COMMENT. Make your own recipe and add comments to what you actually cooked, not something that is sorta like it. Kinda.

I honestly don't know how you can review this recipe having changed virtually everything about it. Why not try the recipe given and rate it...then, and only then, if you don't like it, doctor it and tell us how it compared. Any more than one or two changes makes it a totally new recipe! It's NOT helpful!

I did a few things different here, I used brown rice, substituted spicy sausage for bacon, skinless chicken thighs instead of a whole bird. I boiled the shrimp shells in the chicken stock along with the zest of one lemon then strained them out. I added grilled zucchini, tomatoes, green bell peppers, red and yellow sweet peppers, a green serrano pepper, a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, twice as much saffron and some cumin. i salted to taste after plating. In the future i will use chicken thighs with the skin on and also add more sea food, mussels, clams, lobster etc. depending on how much money i have on my EBT. in the words of my girl friend " your rice is banggin' papi"

I love this Paella, dependable and delicious. Makes a lot and the left overs are wonderful. I always add sausage, smoked, such as Italian and it adds to the flavor nicely.

Rating: 3
Very good flavor, but gave 3 forks as I made changes based on the reviews below. I added 1/4 more rice to prevent the rice from becoming mushy. Also, I did a 2:1 ratio with chicken stock and white wine. Next time, I will use chorizo sausage instead of the bacon. All in all, the dish was superb. One pot, when done in my dutch oven. Definitely a make again dish.

Amazing flavor. The purists would faint but I used regular short grain rice and Andouille sausage. As it's been said by numerous reviewers, unless you like dried rubbery shell fish, do not add it until last 10 minutes. Oh, and I made mine on the stove top, no need to heat up the kitchen. My dinner party guests eagerly asked for seconds.

I've made this recipe several times. It makes company think you spent the whole day in the kitchen. I've added chorizo, and I DO NOT put the seafood in with all the other ingredients. I put the shrimp and shellfish on top about 10 min. before the dish is done.

This was good and the leftovers froze well into another meal. I added chorizo and did not drain the grease well from it well enough. It added good flavor, but too much grease. This did not stop family from really enjoying it though.

One of the best paella recipes I've found. You will get excellent results if you follow the recipe directly or if you substitute any of the shellfish for other species. I've had great results doubling or trippling the the clams and muscles and using whole squid bodies as well

I used chicken drumsticks instead of a whole chicken (I'm a lazy cutter). I also added chorizos and made my own seafood stock (carrots, onions, celery browned with shrimp peel, deglazed with white wine, add 6 cups of water and let it simmer low and slow for 4 hours, then strain). My complaint is that I think the oven temperature is too high, as my rice was really soggy and over cooked.I also wanted a crusty bottom which didn't happen. but over all the flavours were excellent. I'd make again with some more tweaks.

Easy to make! I was surprised at how this simple recipe turned out so delicious. I made this for two and cut the recipe in half - we had plenty of food plus some leftovers! Definitely need a huge pan if you're not going to cut the recipe down. Used a cast-iron skillet and it worked beautifully. As one review stated, this does not yield a traditional, crunchy rice "crust" on the bottom, but it is delicious nonetheless - reminded me of what I have had in restaurants. Took previous reviews' suggestions and used aborio (risotto) rice, which was the perfect size and consistency. The seafood definitely does not need to be added until around 20 minutes are left on the oven clock - that was plenty of time for all our shrimp and mussels to cook perfectly - just make sure to push whatever you add down into the rice mixture so the seafood soaks up some of the great flavors. This recipe is extremely adaptable to any taste - we added more peas and substituted crab legs for the clams ... it was wonderful! I also put in some paprika - smoked or regular would both work - as most other paella recipes call for. Using chicken thighs instead of an entire chicken was inexpensive, quicker and excellent. And adding a little more saffron just made everything better. A sprinkle of salt also won't hurt. This recipe was particularly nice because you really can adapt it to any taste, such as adding more shrimp, rabbit like a traditional paella, veggies instead of meat, etc, or even adding in some fresh herbs and different spices to the chicken and beginning of the dish. I will definitely be making this again!! :)

This is very tasty and makes a lot of food. It overflowed in the oven a little despite a bigger pan than called for. We will make it again. Froze two family meals from it after eating a lot. My husband and kids liked it very much. Per other suggestions I added chorizo sausage. I am not sure I'd do it again even if it is more authentic. Chorizo sausage purchased in Texas is very greasy and even drained that added a greasy feel to the dish. On a second try I would also go with long grain and perhaps even converted rice to keep it more firm through cooking. The arboro rice I used was a little too soft for my liking. I kept the bacon on top which adds a nice flavor and doubled the seafood in it added at the end so it did not overcook per other suggestions.

Rating: 3
This paella was very tasty and easy to make. I did as someone suggested and didn't put the seafood in until 20 minutes before completed and it worked perfectly. The whole 45 mins would have overcooked the seafood. When I make this in the future I may cut down on the time baking as a whole, as I thought the rice came out a little too mushy for my taste. Also, having lived in Spain, my favorite part of the paella is the crunchy stuff on the bottom. This recipe does not allow for this-so if that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere! Despite that, I would still make it again- I liked it, my kids liked it-and it was fairly simple!

I really like this recipe a lot. However, I'm of Spanish descent and can't for the life of me us American bacon, so I substitute it with Spanish chorizo that I pick up from a specialty market. My friends and family absolutely love when I make this dish and I use it as my signature get together dish.

This was super easy to make even for a novice like me. Took advice from suggestions and added seafood for last 20 minutes of cooking. Used sweet chorizo in place of bacon, arborio rice and skinless chicken thighs. Increased saffron to 1 tsp and added half tsp of smoked paprika. One pot, Dutch Oven, start to finish. Was a fabulous New Year's Eve dinner. Will definitely make this again when entertaining.

Loved this recipe. Adapted it by using Chorizo instead of bacon. I also used a teaspoon of Spanish saffron and a teaspoon of Hungarian smoked paprika to flavor the dish. I added an extra 1/2 cup stock, a couple tablespoons of wine, baked it in a 5 quart covered sauteuse pan (similar to a paella pan)for the first 30 minutes without the clams, mussels, and shrimp....added the shellfish the last 15 to 20 minutes, and left it covered. Served it with a bit of olive oil drizzled over the individual plates. My family LOVED this dish!

I can't count how many times I've made this recipe. It's a great foundation and can adapt to changes in additions. I've made on a charcoal grill, a gas grill, and an oven. I've used a paella pan, an all-clad saute pan and an Emile Henri dutch oven--all with great results. The one way I've never done it is with the baking dish suggested. I try to use aborio or spanish paella rice. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs work great. There's a lot of seafood and chicken in this recipe and I would be prepared to cut back based on the size of your pan. The bacon gives it a great smokey flavor and is essential.Adding chorizo only elevates it so you can't go wrong with both. I prefer to use fresh red peppers and add them to the onions when sauteing

I substituted scallops for mussels (about 1/2 lb). This was great!

Nice shortcuts for this dish. However, I make the traditional "sofrito " - a sauteed mixture of olive oil, green and red peppers, onion and garlic, then add the rice, coating with above. I also use Knorr's (Spanish) fish stock or shellfish stock instead of clam juice. For seafood paella, I do not mix with meat, and I season with more salt - 1 tsp each for the stock and the sofrito - for flavor. I was born and reared in the Philippines - a former Spanich colony and can guarantee you there are many kinds of paella out there...It's like the old martini-on- a-desrt island joke - everyone will turn up to tell you how to make it! However, forget the advice about short-grained rice - long grain is fine. Just don't stir after you add the seafood/meats so that the grains can cook separately and not release the "glue."

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe base. I made some modifications and the timing and rice to liquid ratio needs to be perfected, but a good jumping off point for a fantastic, versatile, beautiful dinner perfect for company or large groups. I accidentally forgot the chicken, and so I added a tub of sliced mushrooms, also blanched asparagus, chopped into 2 inch pieces. I added a little salt, but honestly am not sure what level of spice the ones who thought it was bland were looking for. It had a great flavor. I couldn't find choirzo so I used the original's bacon. I also used roasted red peppers b/c that's what I had on hand. I also used 2 bunches of green onions instead of regular. I loved the stove top, then oven baked method.

Rating: 3
This turned out quite nicely. I've made paella according to more traditional recipes but I was quite please with how this turned out. While baking it isn't the norm, the rice turned out very evenly cooked and I liked how bits of it got a slight chew and crunch from being in the oven. I also substituted chorizo for the bacon (why would you use bacon??) and added some red peppers instead of the pimientos (couldn't find them.) I also cheated on the clam broth and instead added the shells of the peeled shrimp into the homemade chicken broth. Would definitely make again!

We used our Le Creuset 5 qt dutch oven for all prep from saute to oven finish. It was easy. We used Scallops, Prawns, Sea Bass, and Chicken, and chorizo in place of bacon. It was GREAT.

I don't have a problem with the different cooking method - it beats straddling two burners and if anyone is such a purist, stick to the recipe given by your abuela which no doubt is better. As for this recipe, the problem I had wasn't with the cooking method but rather the taste -- clearly 1/2 tsp of saffron is not enough. I used 1 tsp and wish I had used 3 tbsp. I also added a teaspoon of paprika, but even with all that, this dish still seemed to have insufficient "umph". Hence the two forks.

I had always thought that paella was extremely difficult to prepare. However, this recipe made paella EXTREMELY EASY and DELICIOUS. It is great for large dinner parties, I prepared 2 baking dishes with no effort. I only changed the cooking times for the mussels 15 min and the shrimp which I know take only 5 min. So just add them when the paella is almost ready. PRESENTATION: Chop some parsley leaves and sprinkle them over the baking dish or the plate.Makes it even MORE COLORFUL!

This was bland at best. At the end, had to add salt and some old bay seasoning to liven it up a bit. That led to cooking it an extra ten minutes resulting in overcooked shrimp and scallops. Though it's a relatively easy recipe, it was too much work for no payoff.

I gave this recipe a 4, with the caveat that the bacon is replaced with Spanish chorizo. I'm of Northern Spanish descent and couldn't imagine bacon in my paella. Otherwise, the recipe is a 10. I've also tried substituting white rice with long grain brown rice. It has to cook a little longer (another 20 minutes), but worth the wait.

On a shopping trip to a local Japanese market, I spotted blue crabs, shrimp, and clams and it dawned on me that today would have to be Paella Day. Mind you I'd never made paella before, but I'd been eyeing this recipe for a very very long time. The seafood items I bought that day weren't exactly the ones in this list, but it was about the same mass - 4 blue crab legs, about 20 clams, and 10 shrimp. I also realized I didn't have jarred pimientos, so I roasted my own bell peppers and added a few tbsp of canned tomato for juice. The results were absolutely positively fabulous. It was my first time, but the directions were clear and easy. The only thing I'd change next time would be to imbed the seafood ingredients more into the rice and juices so that they won't get as dry (though it wasn't really THAT dry this time).

I was really looking forward to making this dish - even bought a Paella pan - and I have to say it was a big disappointment. I'm used to cooking with seafood so only cooked it for about 10 minutes at the end and it was rubbery and overcooked. I think 45 minutes was too long for the rice to cook for as well. Thank heavens my guests were my grown children and their spouses - none of them liked it either. My husband and I had the leftovers the next evening and we still thought it was only so-so at best. I guess we aren't paella lovers.

This was an excellent recipe for someone that has never cooked with seafood before, I was slightly nervous after ordering fresh squid from the fisherman's wharf...but as it turns out seafood is not hard to handle. It was a big hit with my freinds who are afraid to cook with new ingredients. This is definitly a dish to impress, many, many friends (as it makes a lot). I followed the several reviews that suggested to add the seafood in the last 10-15 minutes of cooking. I would also do this with the chicken, fully cooking it seperately beforehand of course. The chicken, which never fully cooked in the mixture, also added extra liquid to the dish while baking (I don't have a traditional paella dish) and made the paella slightly gooey in the end. I used a 2" deep, 12" radius round baking pan and there was barely room for all the ingredients. As paella is one of my favorite dishes, and I plan on making this again and again, I will more than likely invest in a traditional paella pan!

This recipe was a family hit for Christmas dinner for two years in a row and by popular demand, the family insists on making this dish a traditional Christmas dinner. I added scallops to the dish. The only difficultly I had was the cooking time. since I made three times the serving, I probably should have simmered the rice on the stove top for about 30 minutes or until the rice was half cooked and it took almost 3 hours to cook in the oven. The seafood did not dry out since there was plenty of clam juice.

My son wanted to make paella for Christmas dinner. We used this recipe with advice from the comments. Wish we hadn't used arborio rice. I make great risotto, but it didn't work for us with the paella. Followed the advice of others, added the shellfish much later in the cooking. That was fine, although most of the mussels and clams were deceased. My fault. All the other fish & chicken & sausage were good. Everyone thought it was great, but I wasn't convinced. I will try again, but as we all know, don't try a new recipe for a holiday family dinner. Way too much stress! Still, I want to try it again.

I made this two weeks ago and it was such a hit I'm making it again tomorrow night (different guests!). The cooking time for the seafood was obviously too long so I cooked everything else as directed then the last ten minutes of cooking I threw the clams and mussles in a pot of hot white wine/garlic/lemon juice, then as they started to open tossed in the scallops (a must) and finished with the squid tentacles. When they were all at the just cooked stage I piled them on top of the oven baked dish. I can't imagine cooking the shellfish any other way. There wasn't a morsel left. As well I used arborio rice - try to get it if you can - it's more authentic.

Rating: 3
The best addition to this dish is to simmer down a head of fish, a cracked crab and some shellfish until you have a potent seafood broth, which will be used to hidrate the rice. Also, it is a sin not to pour a bit of Jerez (dry sherry) and extra virgin olive oil to each plate, as you serve them.

Making this for New Years' Eve dinner, I wanted an easy & delicious entree -- this recipe was that and more....My husband savored each forkful saying it was one of the best meals!

I made 1/2 the recipe but kept the saffron amount as directed -- it was perfect.

This is a great recipe! As previous writers have suggested, be sure to add the seafood during the last 15 minutes or it will be overcooked. We added chorizo and it was wonderful. We have eaten at Tio Pepe's many time and their paella is wonderful. I definitely recommend trying this reipe!

Easy and incredibly delicious! If I'm serving to company, I use fresh seafood. But for weeknights, I use frozen seafood (defrost 1st) instead and it still comes out great! It's also perfect for entertaining because it's oven baked so you don't have to babysit it.

Quite nice! Made without the bacon or chicken pieces, but did use chicken stock, and arborio rice. I thought the oven temperature would be too hot, but it seems to have been OK (used my big calphalon "everyday pan",, which has a lid and makes this a one-pan endeavor ) Since previous reviewers had lightly sauteed the seafood before adding for the last 15 mins, I just added mine for about 18 mins without sauteeing (hey, it's a Monday). Yes, there's a bit of liquid at the bottom when you start serving, but that's pretty authentic. Good recipe for Fri. eve entertaining, not much after-work hassle.

This is a wonderful paella recipe. I've made it a couple of times following the recipe exactly, but like it better with the following changes: arborio rice instead of long grain, a large can of whole tomatoes (crushed by hand before added), only add seafood for the last 10-15 minutes, and cook from start to finish in the same pan. I don't have a realy paella pan so I just use a large skillet that is oven safe. Delicious!

Made this for my sister for our monthly dinner. It turned out okay, but I think I wouldn't cook it as long, as the shellfish dried out too quickly,I also ran out of chicken stock and substituted more clam juice, which made it to clammy. In all it was very good, and I will make it again with modifications.

This was a simple, easy-to-prepare, and wonderful dish! I recently came back from Spain and must say, this sure brought me back there. As suggested earlier, I used prosciotto instead of bacon, reduced the amount of chicken and squid, but otherwise left it the same. To make everything easier, instead of using a pot then transferring it to a baking dish, I suggest cooking everything in a large pan. Delish!

I used this as a guideline and created a wonderful paella. I substituted chicken broth for the clam juice.

Excellent dish and I'm excited to try some of the variations other people suggested. If you have leftovers do NOT leave the lemon garnish in the paella. I don't cook very often so this may be common knowledge, but the lemon permeates the paella leaving a nasty aftertaste the next day.

This was a wonderfully easy method for paella. I added a pound of spicy linquica sausage cut in large chunks. This added a lot of good flavor. I cut back on the chicken by about a pound to make room for the sausage. I sauteed the sausage chunks along with the bacon. I took the advice of previous reviewers and put in more clams and mussels than the recipe called for and I was glad I did. I did not cook the shrimp and calamari with the rice because I did not want them to overcook and become tough. I did push the clams and mussels into the rice mixture before putting in the oven. These all cooked beautifully. I suggest littleneck clams as they are the perfect size. I lightlysauteed the shrimp & calamari together in a little olive oil...just a couple minutes, then added this on top of the paella mixture for the last 15 minutes, leaving the foil off.

This recipe was a big hit at our New Year's Day dinner. I had a friend over from Costa Rica who loved it (and has had some pretty authentic paella). We modified it a bit by doubling the amount of shellfish and adding chorizo and scallops. Adding the seafood at the last 15 minutes as others have done, therefore didn't work for us. We also put everything in a large pot on the stovetop instead of baking the dish. It is even better the next day and I can't wait to make it again.

I found this recipe while searching for Paella, and knew I had to try it - the first time I ever ate Paella was at Tio Pepe in Baltimore, almost 30 years ago! I took the advice of other reviewers and made some modifications. I used 4 skinless thighs and 2 whole skinless breasts, quartered. I doubled the garlic and saffron, used arborio rice, and 1 cup clam juice, 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. I chopped up a 10oz jar of fire-roasted pepper as opposed to pimiento (aren't they basically the same thing?) I added 1 lb sliced chorizo and used frozen thawed uncooked shrimp, 1 lb fresh sea scallops (which by the way absorbed the sauce beautifully), 12 clams and 18 mussels - glad I got the extra mussels because the color adds to the dish and most of my clams never opened. I simmered it all in a huge pot on the stove rather than baking in the oven, adding seafood for the last 15 minutes. It was served in a large yellow Dansk Paella dish that I have had for eons. The dish received rave reviews from my guests (9 of us total). Tio Pepe used to give us the leftovers in a swan-shaped aluminum foil bundle - mine is in a plastic container, barely enough left for lunch for 2 today! I have made Paella before but it never seemed this easy and certainly didn't taste any better. This dish is delicious, easy to make, and serves a crowd - definitely a repeat.

This was absolutely fantastic. I made a few adjustments like everyone else. Grocery Store in Maine didn't have Saffron so I used a prepackaged spanish saffron rice in the ethnic foods aisle.

Adjustments: add 3 links Italian sausage, sliced; add 3 links chorizo sausage, cut into diagonals (caution: chorizo is a hard sausage and burns easily); substitute boneless chicken thighs; add 1 red bell pepper, chopped; double garlic; substitute for crushed saffron treads = one packet Carmencita brand paella seasoning; use two 14 ounce cans of chicken broth. Use oversize (16") paella pan to accomodate. Instead of baking, cover and simmer (low intermittent) for 45 minutes. Leave seafood out until last 15 minutes of cooking. Let stand 10 minutes to allow rice to absorb fluids. Serve with sangria. Stunning results. Will be used as a signature dish.

A lovely dinner this made. I did make some modifications and reduced the size by about half. Changes made: used 1.5 c risotto rice with 3c chicken stock, 4 chorizo links, .5lb scallops, 1 whole chicken breast, 1lb shrimp, 2 whole roasted red peppers, .5lb bacon, 2 small onions. I followed the techniques and after assembly, baked the paella for about 45 minutes covered. I has to use frozen shrimp and scallops (fresh not avail) and added the the juice from both packages instead of clam juice (not avail). We had hlaf left over after feeding 4 people and it was even better hte next day. to reheat, I added about qtr cup water and reheated at 350 for 30 mins.

I have never made this before. Have eaten and enjoyed it. The reviews gave me courage to use fresh shrimp, scallops, crab legs, orange roughy and canned oysters and clams as well as healthy choice smoked sausage.

This was New Years Eve 2003 dinner - what a way to start the new Year.

Overall, this is a solid recipe but an ENORMOUS dish. It needs a larger pan than what was recommended and should be something that you can take from the oven to the table for serving! I recommend doubling the amount of saffron. If you add the seadfood from the beginning, as directed, it will be overcooked and tough. About 30 minutes into the the baking time, add the clams, squid and shrimp! Like many other reviewers, I too added other ingredients but then this is what paella is all about - using what you have available in the kitchen! Although some reviewers found it wet, that is how authentic paella should be served.

This dish was excellent! I took everyone's advice and cut back the liquid by 1/2 cup. That seemed just right. I also used Jasmine rice. I don't like squid so I left that out and added extra shrimp and clams for the kids. It's a great dish. It does just fit in the dish so you might want to try a little bigger dish.

excellent recipe! i substituted chorizo for the bacon. if you love paella, you'll enjoy this immensely! we didn't mind the 'wetness.' it had more of a risotto feel to it which we loved anyways!

This has become a favorite at our home, and a regular on our table. I agree, however, that it can be too wet, so I recommend reducing the chicken broth a bit. I omit the squid and mussels (hubby doesn't like them), and instead add cooked linguisa. For convenience, I used 2 cans (tuna-sized) of chopped clams. I also use 6 chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. It's a fabulous dish!!!!!

This was a good recipe but I used one bottle of clam juice instead of two, two chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, did not use squid, added seafood sausage, chopped clams and one sea bass filet. Threw cooked rice and remaining of ingredients in a Reynolds Hot Bag. Came out very nice and a good smorgasborg for a birthday dinner.

What can I use instead of the sliced bacon? I do not eat pork. I am dying to try this recipe...

I served this dish at a "Carmen" opera party -- perfect for the event. Next time I make it, I will only use one bottle (1 cup) clam juice -- the leftover rice was very "clammy" with 2 bottles. Of course, chicken stock will need to be increased to 2 cups. 3-1/2 cups liquid made the dish a little too wet. Since I couldn't find squid where I live, I added browned Italian sausage to the dish. It was a great addition and one I have had in other paella dishes. All in all, a delicious meal. This barely fits into a 15x10x2 glass pan -- I'd use a bigger one next time. Also, I would say this serves 10 or more depending on what else you serve.

My rice got a little mushy, so I would watch the time it spends in the oven closely. Had I caught it 5 minutes earlier I would have been happier. This recipe came out tasting like a nice Paella should, but I used Chorizo instead of bacon.

For all the work and prep this took I was disappointed. It was just OK. Didn't excite anyone.

The key to any good authentic tasting Spanish paella is the use of short-grain rice, such as risotto or Japanese. Long-grain rice has a completely different flavor. The second most important ingredient is the broth - make it strong and rich. And never cook the rice for more than 17 minutes. For any true paella aficionado, try the paella recipes in books by Penelope Casas.

This paella was fantastic! I used a spicy chorizo and left out the clams, and it still came out great. Would definitely make it again --delicious!

WE'LL SEE I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I TRULY BELIEVE WITH THE RIGHT WINE WHICH WE ENJOY A WHITE ZIN AND ALSO FRESH FRUIT PLUS SLICES OF FRENCH ROLL BREAD DEFINITELY ENHANCED THE TASTE OF IT AND ALSO SET THE MOOD AND BELIEVE ME DEFINITELY DO IT AGAIN....THANX

Great recipe. Coking in a paellera, the traditional metal paella pan makes this a great recipe. It can be done on the stove top, while moving the pan around, and then finished off in the oven for 15 minutes. If any is left the next day, wrap in foil, add a little water to moisten rice and reheat in 400F oven for 10 minutes.

Smoked Paprika, any spicy sausage (andouille, chorizo, linguica, etc), and diced pork butt roast is how I like my paella along with the seafood of course. You can't cook seafood for 45 minutes as this recipe calls for or it WILL be tough and dry. I usually sautee mine first and add at the last minute before serving and always cook my paella on stove-top uncovered - never as a casserole to avoid mushiness. Look for smoked paprika on the web - the only place I've found it. It REALLY makes a difference.

I substituted more shrimp, scallops and chicken since I'm not a huge fan. Not too shabby. Could have used some more salt/pepper. Used roasted red pepper instead of pimentos. My rice came out a bit too sticky, however, so I will cook it the way I do my Mexican rice: in a frying pan, heat a bit of vegetable oil and brown rice. Then add to broth and continue with the recipe.

the first time i ate this i loved it, the second time wasn't so great. The second time was much more mushy, and the seafood was very dried out as well as thhe white parts of the chicken. The flavor both times has been fine. prep is easy.

This was so yummy!! I had to substitute smoked sausage for the squid, and bought saffron rice rather than the rice and saffron threads (both subs were price issues), but it turned out fabulously! Makes a lot, though, so make sure you have about 6 people or so to eat it.

To the cook in Santa Rosa, Don't omit the bacon! Even if you just crisp some and use the bacon fat, it will add much more flavor than omitting the bacon entirely. Especially with the seafood aspect. This was my first attempt at paella, and it came out pretty nummy!

Rating: 3
If I could I would give this a 3+. Although the dish was excellent, it lacked something. Maybe could use more saffron. (I made mine without bacon and added bay scallops and calamari.) What about white wine? What does the Spanish restaurant have that I don't?

This paella is excellent and easier than other paella's I've made. I plan to substitute the clams with crawfish tails or scallops when I make it again. I will definitely make it again.

I am a spicy food person but I still enjoyed this. I left out the squid and shrimp and doubled the clams and mussels. Looking forward to trying it with shrimp and maybe scallops.

We are big paella fans and just loved this. I make it easy on myself by cooking it in a big electric frying pan. This gives finer control and prevents rice burning on the bottom. I also add a can of sliced green beans, seeded and peeled tomatoes and green peppers for colour. This is great for vegetarians if you add some salmon and halibut and cut out the bacon and chicken. I spent three weeks in Spain and didn't once have a decent paella like this. I also prefer to add the seafood close to the end of cooking.

this recipe totally fulfilled my craving for paella. even the most unadventurous palates in my household really enjoyed it.

This recipe is deliciosa! Even without the bacon it tasted great, my husband loved it! You can also buy the frozen seafood packages if fresh one is not available, althought the taste would not be the same (don't forget to add it just about 15 min. before the dish is ready, otherwise it will be overcooked!). Will definitely make it again!

BLAND AND NOT VERY EXCITING. THE SQUID TOOK TOO LONG TO COOK.

Rating: 4
I seldom cook but I had a great success! The preparation time was long because I cleaned the chicken(we use fresh chickens in Hong Kong)and the seafood thoroughly. I used scallops instead of clams and mussels. I also put in the Spanish sausage and bell peppers which added a bit of colours and taste. It worth all that work!Yum yum!

Great party recipe. Can be prepared up to the baking stage, then poped into the oven when guests arive without further attention. Wonderful flavor. (BTW, I'm also from Baltimore area.)

When in Spain it is mandatory to eat paella. We do, and we love it. I have tried many other recipes for paella, but none have been this good! While in spain, I purchased a set of paella pans, and used the largest to make this recipe - and, since it goes from stovetop to oven to tabletop, I used less pans, and it looks, feels, and tastes more authentic. I susbstituted baby squid for the regular squid (you don't have to cut them up, they shrink immediately upon hitting the heat). I also substituted some bottled roasted red peppers along with the pimiento, since I didn't have enough pimiento - it was great!

Several suggestions to make this even easier. I started the whole thing in oven proof casserole and didn't bother with the transfer to another dish. Also - adding the seafood at the beginning of the 45 minute high heat cooking time makes for something like "dehydrated" shrimp, etc at the end. I added mine 15 minutes into cooking time and they were still quite dry and chewy. Next time I will add them about 10 minutes before the 45 minutes is up. The chicken cooked for this length of time in this liquid was just terrific!

I modified this recipe a bit to meet my dietary restrictions (no bacon or chicken) and added scallops, so I'm not commenting on the exact recipe, but it was really, really good. And so beautiful! My boyfriend said it was the best paella he's ever had. I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent Dish. We are not so fortunate as to have access to fresh mussels. If you get frozen ones, rinse them well! We found several little pearls while chewing. I will add LOTS more garlic, salt and pepper next time, and increase the clam juice while decreasing the chicken broth. Definitely a hit.

This recipe should be simply called "Rice Casserole" But hey, nobody knows the difference anyway between true paella and her cousins anyway.

Sunday Night; My shift ended at 5; turns out everyone RSVP'd with a yes; 8 people and only one big paella pan. Well, I started preparing at around 6:30, and by 7:45, we were all sitting down to a visual and flavour feast! a total success.

This was an excellent meal. One of our guests had recently been to Spain and raved about the Paella he had there, he raved about this one even more. Easy to make and spectacular results.
