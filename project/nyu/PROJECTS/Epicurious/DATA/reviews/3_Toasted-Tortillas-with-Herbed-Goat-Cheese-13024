This is a great appetizer for getting your tastebuds going. The herbs ARE very powerful, so it shouldn't be eaten without some kind of refreshing beverage to go along with it. Perfect with a zingy white wine or crisp lager. Love to serve it. Always a hit.

Easy and good using our homegrown herbs. Next time I'll cut the salt and the pepper by about half. I think this could be an experiment-friendly recipe if one wanted to try using other herb mixes or even garlic.
