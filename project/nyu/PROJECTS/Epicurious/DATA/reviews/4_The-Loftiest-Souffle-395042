We made this with absolute beginners and had spectacular results! Great height, classic flavour. Couldn't be better.

What to make when one of one's children is "starving", and there's no time for a grocery run? I recommend this quick and easy souffle. I used the Swiss cheese I had on hand instead of Gruyere. If presentation is an issue (it wasn't in my case) rush the souffles to the table. They deflated rapidly, but were still very tasty.

This is the best souffle I've made in 35 years of making souffles. My original recipe (probablyl from an old Joy of Cooking) is almost identical except I've never used xanthan gum before; I'd definitely recommend buying some. I bought a bag of Bob's Red Mill brand locally in Dallas at Central Market. You can buy it online as well. It's pricey, about $10 for an 8 oz bag, but I figure at 1/4 t per souffle recipe, it's good for about 191 more souffles :). My recipe changes: I used a mix of leftover cheeses including cheddar and a Mexican blend, plus the parmesan cheese. I didn't have whole milk so I used 2% with an extra tablespoon of butter. I also used a medium souffle dish instead of 4 individual dishes. My family of 3 demolished it in no time.
