Following the other reviewers, I cut the potatoes down to 3/4 of a pound but kept everything else the same. Even then it was potatoes with some egg for flavor. As long as you are trying to make a potato dish, this is good. But it is not an egg dish.

This might be the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. And I have eaten a lot of things. some thoughts: -the cilantro browns easily. I might just sprinkle it on top next time instead of coking it in. -stiff peaks seems like a bit much to me. I had trouble getting my eggs to be "springy" the way the recipe described them. Too much air can really take away from the texture of the dish. Plus, I agree with smj182--I would add another egg or two next time. 2lbs is a lot of potatoes! But regardless, this dish is amazing. We couldn't stop eating it.

This was wonderful. We keep curry leaves in the freezer, they are quite distinctive and really difficult to find a substitute for, so worth searching for an Indian market. We have two family members that find cilantro very distasteful (sadly), so I did omit it.

Curry leaves have nothing to do with curry powder - they come from the curry tree, also called kadipatta or sweet neem. They are a bit hard to find fresh but worth it - you can pop a whole bunch in the freezer. Excellent flavors in this dish.

What are Curry Leaves? Curry is a SPICE made up of several different spices and they vary according to the origin of the recipe.

Hi, The list of ingredients used are absolutely correct. However the correct way would be to chop the potatoes into fine fingers and cook it from scratch. Boiling the potatoes removes their essential goodness.Pl do visit my recipe site at rodas-kitchen.blogspot.com

This was such a fun, different dish. I shortcut on a lot of ingrediants (mustard for the seeds, cumin powder for seeds, curry powder for leaves) and it was still great - I can't wait to make it "for real"! Although next time, I will double the eggs since we love them and felt the potatoes took over (that is just our taste). I served it with sausage and it was a very hearty, satisfying meal.

This was a very easy dish, and had a very authentic taste, look, and feel. I omitted the egg portion - I just didn't feel it was necessary, plus my dinner crowd was having their first experience with Indian food so I thought the simpler, the better. I also omitted the curry leaves and used regular mustard seeds instead of brown, and it seemed to workout just fine. In fact, it was quite interesting. Just make sure you have the lid to your pot handy when you throw those mustard seeds in, or you're going to lose most of them...they pop right out of the pot and I was amazed how something so small could fly so far... Actually I would probably turn the heat down for a few minutes before adding the cumin and mustard seeds cause they burned immediately. Anyway, the potatoes on their own were delicious, and I would most likely include them again in an Indian themed dinner! Maybe next time I'll even try the egg...
