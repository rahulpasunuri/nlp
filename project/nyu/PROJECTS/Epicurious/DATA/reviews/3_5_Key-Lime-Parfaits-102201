Preparing this as I speak. So far I find the Key lime mixture very good, using the real limes as I can't find bottled juice. Not sure on the crumb crust, but will know within the hour or two if this is a success.

Really very good, and very easy. Can be made the day before, too, as it holds up quite well in the fridge. A big hit!

I tried this and loved it and am wondering how to make it lo-fat for my family this weekend. I am trying to help them with their quest to lose weight. Can I use yougart? Any suggestions??

I've been making this recipe since 2003, and it has never failed. Super fast and easy - and I am very much an amateur. This last time made it while my guests were having dinner. This recipe is a must try if you like key lime, or parfait, or just dessert in general!

I love these parfaits and so does everyone I've ever made them for. Great summer dessert. I always double the graham cracker part. I've used low fat and fat free sweetened condensed milk both with excellent restuls. No one can tell the difference. Garnish with a strawberry. I keep 10 ounce clear plastic cups on hand now in case I want to make these.

Came out really good. Used actual key limes. Everyone loved it! Used low-fat whip cream instead, can't tell the difference!

This is very good and easy! I added cinnamon to the crumbs and decreased the sugar to 2 Tbls. The crumbs brown quickly, so be careful. I will definitely make this again.

Loved the graham cracker crumbs. Found the filling to be too rich and dense. And I don't care for the mouthfeel of the sweetened condensed milk. Here's a substitute cream I made and used the same crumbs. If anyone tries it I'd be interested in your thoughts. 3 blocks cream cheese, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1 c. sugar, 8 T. key lime juice, 1 1/2 T. Key Lime zest, 1 c. whipping cream. Whip cream cheese (room temp) until fluffy. Add rest of ingredients (except cream)until combined. Whip cream to soft peaks nad fold into cream cheese mixture. Pipe into glasses with layers of crumbs. Makes 16 servings.

I used regular limes as key limes were not available. It was good but needs adjustment. The mousse was a bit too tart and the crumbs were a bit too sweet. I'm going to make this again this weekend and will slightly reduce the lime juice,zest and sugar. I expect that this will result in a 4 fork rating

Rating: 3
Very tasty and impressive looking (even though it's easy to make). Using the suggestions from previous reviewers I cut the sugar in half and increased the crumbs. I will make this again.

Made these last night and thought they were delicious! Like others, I also used fat free milk. I had a little trouble with the crumbs in that they hardened into little clumps after I took them out of the pan. Not a problem, though, after I chopped them up a bit in the food processor. Saved one for today and it was still great! The filling thickens up in the fridge so don't worry if it seems a little too runny.

These were wonderful and packed with lots of lime flavor and tartness! I took other readers' advice and used fat free condensed milk, fresh key limes, doubled the crumb mixture and sprinkled some reserved crumb mixture on top of the parfaits just before serving. The crumb mixture does cook quickly so watch carefully. It didn't take very long for it to turn the "right" color and out of the pan fast to prevent further cooking/burning. Served in nice wine glasses. A real hit and would consider this a keeper for flavor, presentation and ease of preparation. YUMMY!

Wonderfully easy and tasty! Took other reveiwers suggestions : 1- added finely chopped pecans to crumb mixture 2-decreased sugar to 2 Tbls., and 3- doubled crumb mixture! Note, mousse served #8 parfait glasses, with no leftovers. This is so easy!

Made it for 4th of July -- husband called it "restaurant-quality". Like others, I think the cracker mix is a lttle sweet -- but I'll be making it again, with less sugar, and maybe a little zest mixed in.

Tasted OK. I think I would rather not use the condensed milk and make all from scratch. It would be tastier. I'll search for another recipe.

It's a little too sweet for me, so next time I might cut some of the sugar in the graham cracker mix. But I LOVED IT! And it's still good the next day!

Made this for New Yeaer's Eve dinner and wow a little bit goes a long way. Intended to use a store bought graham cracker pie crust but instead added blueberries. Also added a bit more lime juice and zest. Served the mixture in antique pudding cups garnished with a mixture of blueberries, strawberries and rasperries. It was a big hit and just the right amount after a big meal.

I can't count the number of times I've made this recipe! My husband loves key lime, so it's often a request ... and so easy to make. I've even made as a passing dessert for a cocktail party or shower--just use clear, 3oz plastic cups & serve on a chilled platter. The recipe makes 50 or 60 tiny parfaits!

I made this for a casual dinner party and it was a huge success. I have made it in a shortcut version with equally wonderful results. I place the filling in a pre-made graham cracker crust and freeze it. I take it out of the freezer during dinner, just to soften a bit and then garnished with whipped cream. Great to do a day or two before you entertain. Yum.

Yes I would do this again- adding a touch more lime juice. I used the nuts and cinnamom and also the egg white- a plus to this recipe.

I made this for a New Year's dinner. It was right after the holidays and I was tired of the traditional Christmas desserts. This hit the spot. I am going to make it tonight for dessert for a dinner party. I love it! For some reason it seems easier than pie, and with company it is nice to have dessert dished out ahead of time. I haven't made with bottled key limes, I used actual key limes, everyone says it makes all the difference? So I don't risk it! Great, light and refreshing!

Rating: 4
Deeelicious! Next time, I'm going to try to add some gently smashed raspberries in a couple of layers for color and extra pizzaz. First try the recipe as is, it works wonderfully. Also, since I am much to lazy to squeeze my own key limes, though there is no doubt that this is the tastiest way to get the flavor, I use the Williams Sonoma or Pottery Barn Key Lime juice. This really gives you a bang for your flavor and cuts back significantly on prep time. Well worth the seemingly steep cost of bottled juice.

Wow! I am a key-lime lover, and this recipe measure up wonderfully! The key lime mousse gets tangier as it refrigerates. I added a couple of tablespoons of minced toasted pecans and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon when the crumb mixture just before the crumbs were taken off the heat. The tartness of the lime and the crunchy sweetness of the crumb mixture complimented each other beautifully, and the presentation can be altered to suit any kitchen tools, whether you have a pastry bag, or a spoon; parfait glasses, or ramekins. A beautiful, tasty dessert!

Have made this recipe on several occassions, always to rave reviews. Forget the other reviews that offer shortcuts or suggest problems. Follow the recipe exactly as written. It always comes out perfect.

We loved this dessert! I did encounter two problems that are worth mentioning. I followed to the letter the directions for the butter/sugar/crumb mixture and found the time on the stove was too long. The butter separated and the mess turned to something resembling cooling lava. I had to start over and was much more successful by simply melting the butter, stirring in the sugar, and tossing in the crumbs until well coated and heated through. The second suggestion is to use glasses with a fairly wide mouth. I used tulip wine glasses and found it difficult to add the parfait without slopping on the sides. Squeezing and grating the fresh key limes was a time-consuming chore, but I'd do it again rather than using regular limes. In spite of the foregoing whining, I can't wait to make this again!

I successfully tripled the recipe to feed a hungry group of senior citizens! It was a hit. I also topped each with a maraschino cherry for a little added color. This dessert is really best served COLD, so much so that next time I am going to try freezing it for a few hours before serving.

One more suggestion on the "crust". I made my last Key Lime Pie with a scant cup of crushed pecans in the graham cracker crust with a generous teaspoon of cinnamon. I got rave reviews on the crust from someone who doesn't like "nuts in their food". I mixed the pecans & cinnamon with the crumbs prior to adding to the sugar/butter in this recipe. Made all the difference in the world... Also, try to use fresh keylimes. I just picked mine fresh off the tree for the first time and there's no comparison.

I made this for a BBQ last weekend and received rave reviews. I used 10 oz. clear plastic cups and doubled the amount of crumbs as another reviewer suggested. I liked having 2 solid layers of the crumb mixture instead of just a sprinkling. I added some extra fresh sweetened whipped cream to the tops. Piped it on with a star tip and garnished with a strawberry half. My husband ate leftovers the next day and said the texture was still good. Use a microplane to zest the limes and you won't get any chewy rind in your lime mousse.

Rating: 4
It was excellent as is...but...very, very, rich. We found that adding a bit of Hornito's tequilla to the mixture was a fantastic compliment to the lime flavor...you need a tequilla with a flavor...not the "Brand name" big bottle stuff, I think...However, it does change the texture...more creamy/liquid...so perhaps altering the amount of lime juice would be the key...

Rating: 3
Very easy and very yummy. I used regular limes from our tree and it was wonderful. Do not make it the night before, as the texture changes a little the next day. Also, I only ended up with enough for 5 glasses and had lots of graham cracker crumbs left.

This was so simple and good. A nice recipe for a last minute get together. Be careful when you mix in the crumbs. They brown very quickly. Remove mixture from pan asap so that it does not burn.

Rating: 3
The cookie mixture was delicious, next time I would increase the amount of sugar, butter and graham crackers in order to get two solid layers for all of the parfaits. I would have liked the lime mixture to be a bit more stiff - perhaps the solution would be to increase the percentage of whipped cream in relation to lime juice? In order to combat the chewy/bitterness of the lime peel I might simmer the condensed milk with the peel, then strain and cool and add to the cream in order to achieve a smooth pudding. This really tasted like a modified key lime tart, it was great!

A lovely easy dessert. However, I had neither graham crackers on hand nor chocolate wafers so I used grated chocolate. Very good!!

We made this last night for no special reason just because and it tasted great. We have not yet found graham crackers here in this small town in France so we used butter cookies. We just made them into crumbs and used that instead of the butter, sugar, graham cracker mixture. It was really good. Enjoy!!

Made this with fat free condensed milk. Excellent. I made it into 4 large parfaits, but since it is rather rich, next time I'll do 6. I also made it 7 hours ahead & it held up beautifully. I left my left overs in the fridge over night. The texture was not quite as fluffy--don't believe I would make the night before. Still tasted great, though.

A wonderful variation of key lime pie. I have my own key lime tree so the juice and grated peel were superb. I also used the non-fat sweetened condensed milk and only two tablespoons of sugar in the crust which is plenty. Although the crust did harden up a bit, I chopped it with a fork before sprinkling it in with my fingers! It was a big hit and so pretty!

This was sensational, and my guests devoured theirs! I made 4 large parfaits and every drop was delicious! Last time I made this I thought it was a little too sweet, and my graham crackers clumped a little, but overall I loved it! I made again last night and used the fat free sweetened condensed milk and it was much better! This time my graham crackers were fine. Definitely will make again!

Easy & delicious! I made this dessert for a gourmet cooking club dinner, and everyone liked it. I did make a major change, however. Since I was serving this dish to a particular group who considers presentation very important to the enjoyment of the dish, I thought that due to the pale color of key lime that the graham cracker layer would be dull if served in a clear glass dish, so I made the crumb layer from a chocolate crust receipt: 1/4 cup unsalted butter; 1 1/2 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped; 3/4 cup chocolate wafer cookie crumps. Melt butter & chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat until smooth. Mix in cookie crumbs. I took the martini glass suggestion and the contrast between the pale key lime and the dark crumbs looked great. The chocolate was a tasty compliment to the key lime.

Have made this dish two times now because it is soooo good and easy. I doubled the recipe the last time I made this - it served 8 people - generous portions, but they ate it all up!

This was amazing. I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and fat-free cool whip to make things a bit lighter. The flavor was not compromised. I actually served this in martini glasses, starting with the graham cracker crumbs as the base layer and ending with the key lime filling with a sprinkling of the graham crumbs as a garnish. I refrigerated the desserts for a few hours and it was perfect. Extremely rich and filling on its own though, so it may not be the best finale after a heavy meal.

Hi These were just great, a tangy,satisfying and yet light-in-texture dessert. Here is how I changed it. I didn't do the graham cracker thing at all but I did serve it with coconut macaroon cookies. I decorated the top of each parfait with a thin slice of lime. I used bottled key lime juice, and in addition to the grated lime rind I added one eight of a teaspoon of lime oil (natural, not artificial extract) which I happen to have. (Essential citrus oils can be purchased from King Arthur Flower Co as well as Williams Sonomo and they add a wonderful citrus kick, can even be substitued for freshly grated rind. A little goes a long way.) I also added one egg yolk to the basic recipe and folded in one stiffly-beaten egg white. The yolk added a very little firmness while the egg white lightened it. My results were very very limey, and everyone praised them as a wonderful end to a heavy holiday meal. Key lime pie without the crust.

I loved these parfaits and so did my guests. They were very easy to make and were nice and light following a Mexican meal. I used all of the recipe in four glasses and the parfaits were big, but everyone ate it all!

Key lime or lime,if key limes are in season; use them. Never use a bottled juice or key lime in a little green bottle,some people get strung out on names like designer lables. Trust me, 99% of fine dining establishment use plain, fresh pressed green limes. Congrulations BON'you dont hide behind labels. Pastry chef from Key West FL.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. My only recommendation is not cook the graham cracker crumbs as long because they do harden quickly. Half the time works for me.

It makes me crazy that a gourmet magazine, Bon Appetit, would put out a recipe with "lime" juice and call it a "Key Lime" parfait. Limes and key limes are NOT the same!!!! This may be delicious, but should be called Lime Parfait.Fresh key limes are hard to come by in most parts of the country and only available during a small window of time. They can be purchased in small green sqeeze bottles in gourmet departments however. True key lime juice would dramatically change the flavor and makeup of this recipe.

I highly recommend this recipe!I had to make this recipe for 18 people; every one of them loved it! The texture and taste is wonderful. The only thing I was worried about was the graham cracker part-it hardened very quickly and clumped. However, it tasted great with the key lime.

This dessert is super for dinner parties. It's delicious and easy. The sweetness of the condensed milk is perfectly balanced with the tartness of the lime. Next time, I'll make one and a half times the recipe because the portions seemed too small. Although I haven't tried this variation yet, I was thinking of freezing the mousse in a graham cracker crust as a frozen key lime pie. Just a thought.
