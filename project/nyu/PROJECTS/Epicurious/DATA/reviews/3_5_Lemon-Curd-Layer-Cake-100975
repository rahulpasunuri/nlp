Awesome cake! Loved how light and airy it is. This will be my go to recipe from now on. Used store bought curd and added lemon juice to store bought frosting to save time.

Haven't actually eaten it yet (aside from tasting the curd and icing, which are awesome). The cake part turned out well physically, too. I saw the other reviewers comments about the icing not setting up and decided to have faith in the recipe. Dumb. It tastes so so delicious but it looks really bad. Hopefully it'll set up by morning and taste okay all together...

I ONLY MADE THE CURD. I am always looking for an easy curd recipe. I used Meyer lemons and it turned out delicious and perfect. I was confused with the recipe, because i have never had to combine everything at the beginning and then turn on the heat, but that is what you do with this one. I whisked the whole time, setting the timer so I could tell how long it had been. Keep it at a medium heat, the sugars etc will gradually get really hot and it will indeed boil at about 12-14 minutes. This was the perfect consistency at that time, too. Pretty fool-proof! Enjoy.

I found a simple way to make the frosting set up. When you make the lemon curd use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch NOT 2 teaspoons. Then use extra heavy whipping cream and whip it stiff before blending in the lemon curd. This works so well I make half the curd recipe sometimes to make just the frosting and use it on a other cakes. It is a favorite among my friends and family.

Ordinarily this would receive 5 forks (1 extra), but the lemon curd recipe here doesn't work well at all. The "gelling" effect of acid with whipped cream isn't happening to create a stable frosting which is why there are so many problems with transporting this cake (even from the fridge to the table). Be sure to use only regular lemon juice (using frozen lemon juice from Minutemaid is perfectly acceptable)--but definitely not from meyer lemons which are much less acidic--and throw in 3 oz of chopped premium white chocolate to make sure this sets up. Double the butter, and decrease the amount of sugar by half (yes, half). This is one of those recipes where magic must have occurred in the Bon Appetit test kitchen for this to have worked for them. The recipe for the cake layers is perfection; the concept is gossamer, but the overall result is disastrous unless you somehow fortify the whipped cream with cornstarch (google starch stabilized whipped cream a la Rose Levy Beranbaum), or in the least alternative, a gelatin sheet. I'd make this again, but only with the necessary modifications that ensure an acceptable result. Finally, candied lemon slices are a better garnish than weepy fresh ones. cf.: Lemond curd recipe by Alice Medrich in Cocolat c 1990.

If you love lemon, this is the recipe for you! I have never made a egg white leavened type cake before, so was a bit hesitant at first; the cake came out tasting wonderful, however I realize now (not being experience with using egg whites)that I didn't beat the egg whites long enough and the cake didn't really rise as much as it should have. I plan to make this again for my friend's wedding shower! Delicious! Oh, and the curd...I had to resist eating it by the spoonful! yum.

I'm not sure what some of these people expected from this good recipe. The "frosting" is nothing more than a mousse and if you're traveling with it further than your dining table, you will absolutely need to fortify the whipped cream with gelatin, sacrificing SOME textural quality for stability. Scorched curd? How can you do that? Whisk it for the entire time over MEDIUM heat, that means on the low side. Damming the "frosting" around the edges of the layer is the thing to do to prevent slipping (then again, if you're savvy, you'll not have slippage to begin with). Above all, unless the ghost of James Beard has inhabited your body during the manufacture of this cake, DO NOT TAMPER with the ingredients. This isn't savory cooking where you can attempt to accommodate your personal tastes. Baking and pastry is about the synergy of the ingredients. One false move and it may not work. Don't like all the sugar? Don't make it! It's that simple. Same thing for the butter. Some of these comments are astounding, actually. I made this today and suggest you do the curd the night before and then make the mousse "frosting." Complete the cakes and by the time you've cleaned up you should be good to assemble. Using 3 skewers for travel is genius. Oh, and, since the recipe is silent about it, ALWAYS make sure your eggs are room temperature. To the people who thought the cake was too spongy (it's an egg-white leavened cake, sort of), use pound cake if you don't like the texture. Not for the uninitiated.

If you are looking for a cake with a super lemony-packed punch, this is your cake. It is really, really divine flavor-wise and texture-wise. It goes quite nicely with a glass of champagne, and is just divine in general. NOTE: Pay attention to the preparation time... it takes a long time to prepare the various portions of the recipe NOTE: like several other people said, the frosting itself doesn't hold its form for long. Keep this cake refrigerated and put back in fridge immediately upon slicing. It is scrumptious, but quickly becomes messy and gloppy if left sitting out too long.

I read the other reviews and shame on me, I didn't regard the notes on the frosting. It tasted great but did not hold up well. Actually, let's go back, the cake was ok, but the cooking time was too long. Definitely check it before the required time, I was gun-shy because I've never done an egg white-based cake before and over-cooked it. Still good, but not the "it" cake; kind of spongy. The curd and frosting tasted wonderful but the combination does not hold up. The whip cream frosting does not travel well (found out when the leaning tower of Pisa simply turned in to a wreck) and would be much more presentable if simply served at home. That said, make sure you have enough refrigerator room for the cake to keep cool so that the cake does not slide(I found that the whip cream frosting will hold only if cold,)otherwise, be prepared to manhandle it with spatulas, kebab sticks, or whatever else you have handy that will help you save face. I would like to try the cake again but maybe with 2 layers instead of 3 (not so top heavy) and at a decreased time for the cake. Good luck.

Wish I could give this 10 forks! I've made dozens of recipes from Epicurious and this was the best one EVER. Made it for a large party where many other people brought some gorgeous desserts, but this was the one that everyone raved about and inhaled. My only change was to use the Meyer lemon curd recipe from this site instead (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Meyer-Lemon-Curd-102744) and doubling that made exactly enough. Oh, and I sifted the dry ingredients. The texture of the cake was perfect, the Meyer lemon curd was phenomenal, and while I'm usually not a fan of whipped cream, no other frosting could have been so perfect for this light and delicate yet rich cake. It was surprisingly simple but it was quite different from any other cake recipe so it definitely takes a few reads before attempting. Made the curd Friday, the cake layers Saturday, the frosting Sunday morning, then frosted after lunch Sunday and served that afternoon. Each step was pretty quick and easy - didn't seem like a big deal when it was spread out that way. And it looked EXACTLY like the picture - so gorgeous!

This cake was truly wonderful! I made half as a test run for a friend's birthday party. Glad I did because it's the kind of cake I'd like to get practice making before making it for an event. I didn't end up using the whipped cream frosting, though, as I do fear it would likely not hold up for a long duration. The cake itself was tender and a great texture. I added about 1 T of chopped candied lemon peel, which I think added a nice flavor. I also used a bit less butter in the curd; I don't think it needed it. But, since I noticed some of the curd goes into the cake, I added 1 more tablespoon of oil to prevent dryness. One point to note is that you should really take care to read the whole recipe (several times!) as it's not a typical/straightforward cake recipe. Also, I didn't need to chill the curd for as long as 5 hours. Maybe 1 hour or so, but you could also spread it thinner and put it in the refrigerator/freezer for quicker chilling. Truly delicious!! Can't wait to make it for the actual birthday!

This is a wonderful cake. My grandson asked for lemon cake for his birthday, and I had been saving this recipe. It was a very hot day, so I had a little trouble with the whipped cream frosting slipping before I could get it to the refrigerator to chill, and then when we got down to the last few pieces. However, the taste made any trouble worthwhile! You shouldn't get any egg bits in your curd if you follow the directions and make sure you strip everything together well before starting to cook, and then use a wire whip and whip continuously for the listed time. Mine was perfect and did not scorch. The frosting and batter also went together well, and the cake is a classic sponge in texture -- a good foil for the rich filling and frosting. I learned many years ago that the secret to baking is to measure and follow directions exactly. Cooking is an art, but baking is at least 90 percent science!

Great cake. Have made it 3 times. 1st time with the whipped cream frosting and the cake did slip, but the last two times I made cream cheese frosting and only spread the lemon curd between the layers. In the last version I bought my lemon curd and used two 9" pans.

This recipe is great. I added the powder sugar to the whipping cream as someone else suggested and it worked great. Next time i would add less powder sugar to the icing, being that the lemon curd is so sweet. Also I strained the lemon curd to get out the little bits.

Wonderful cake- light, moist and lovely. I made it for a spring baby shower and had rave reviews. A couple of suggestions: use two 9" pans and cut to make four layers of cake. I then put 1/4 c. curd and 3/4 c. frosting inbetween each layer. Also, strain the curd after removing it from the heat to get rid of cooked egg bits. I also used heavy cream and whipped it with the sugar before folding it into the curd (whisk first to loosen). There was no need to refrigerate the frosting first, although I did make the cake a couple of hours ahead so it had some set time in the fridge. I travelled 45 min in stop n go traffic and had no trouble with slippage.

I made the cake layers from this recipe and the curd and frosting from this http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/107898. I didn't want to mess with a curd recipe that called for cornstarch... Overall, the cake layers came out really well. Very tender and moist and flavorful. My only problem was that I didn't fold the whites into the batter well enough and so had one pocket that didn't rise like the rest of the layer, creating a sunken hole.

This cake is fantastic and I have been making it for years. It is a family favorite. I have had problems with the frosting setting up but solved that problem by accident when I beat the powdered sugar with the whipping cream instead of the lemon curd. So now I do that and then fold in the lemon curd to the whipped cream mixture. I didn't even have to let it set in the refrigerator as recommended. All I can say, is anyone who has problems with this cake, isn't following the recipe correctly. It is divine!!!!

I love this recipe, and do some variations that seem to work well. Cream cheese substitutes the heavy cream giving the frosting more body and an extra smooth taste

A trick I use that keeps the whipped crem from running is to add a packet of Whip It! Its a special, no taste geleation powder specific for this problem. I mostly make cakes with whipped cream fillings or frosting and this stuff helps keeps it from becoming runny and grainy after sitting in room temp for a while. You can find this at almost any grocery store in the baking aisle.

As many reviews mentioned, the cake layers were a bit plain. The curd and the frosting were delicious though. Despite following other reviewers' suggestions to improve the consistency of the frosting, it was still far too liquidy. The cake was lopsided, the curd slid off the top and down one side and I could definetly not replicate the picture! I liked the idea of this cake, especially when we pick our lemons from our garden, and might try it again with a different frosting and more lemon flavor in the cakes.

The cake layers are delicious--so light and fluffy (definitely use cake flour and follow the instructions re combining the egg whites and batter). My curd did not burn, but I cooked it over med-low and whisked it constantly. My only complaint about this cake is that the whipped cream frosting seems to start to slip as soon as it is out of the fridge.

l have used this recipe over and over again . At my restaurant it was a staple and when it was not on the menu they begged me for it. My parents are celebrating their wedding anniversary and asked for this cake to be served.I found the texture to be light and airy the curd to be lemony, however it needs to be cooked in a bain marie to aviod burning and it doesn't hurt to add a little geletin to the whipping cream especially in the summer. Keep trying and use cake and pastry flour and sift!

I was so excited to try this cake after so many great reviews. I love lemon, and this cake sounded amazing. However, I was terribly disappointed. I found the cake to be INCREDIBLY dense- I believe one person referred to it as a 'stick to your ribs kind of cake'. Following the cooking instructions, the curd burned on the bottom and was unappealing. This was combined with a VERY buttery taste, rather than the tart lemon flavor I expected. Finally, I found the frosting to not have much lemon flavor, and added a great deal of both lemon juice and zest to make it worthwhile. Combined with the slippage mentioned by other reviewers, this cake was a mess. I will probably end up throwing the rest out- something that NEVER happens in my house.

Rating: 3
Forgot to add about only spreading the curd partway out between layers re the slippage problem, and also spread the frosting first and then the curd. Both were great hints, and no problems thus. But it looked uneven when cut into slices. But beautiful presentation whole. Also I traveled with this cake over an hour in vehicle and walking 4 blocks!!

This was a lot easier than I thought. I thought it was good, but 10 people raved about it so I guess it was great. It was out for over an hour before it was eaten, which may have made it not as great as it could have been - I'm sure it didn't help. It is VERY lemony (duh). It also took me much less time than I thought, and I was freaking out til the end. I started at 10:30 a.m. and it was all done by 6:15. I made the curd the way one reviewer recommended, adding the butter after thickening. Worked fine. By the way, 1 cup of lemon juice is about 4 lemons. This was a very spring-like cake. The frosting was NO problem and firmed up an hour earlier than it said (and the curd earlier than, also. Well, I was using my front porch as an auxilliary fridge and it was 40 degrees.) Oh, the whites never did beat until stiff. But that was okay. This was a great way to use up a dozen eggs! I still have 4 dozen left! I also did not pipe the frosting around the edge, but mounded it up, and it was like the yellow lemon curd was a bright yellow flower in the middle. I couldn't use the last lemon for garnish as it was rotten. OH - mine baked in only 20 minutes - almost OVERbaked, and I have a brand new stove. This was a beautiful cake. Very impressive.

Fabulous flavor and texture. This is a wonderful confection that I will make again. I made no changes this time - but will next. I followed directions exactly except that I froze the layers before frosting and I still had slop and slippage from the frosting and curd (and my curd did thicken). Here's what I might do next time - 1) just put curd between layers and don't add any curd to the whipped cream. Then just use sweetened whipped cream for exterior frosting. You would still use all of the ingredients and therefore maintain flavors, but it may help cake to not slip by removing the whipped cream from between layers and also by not adding curd to whipped cream. 2) OR make as directed and cut off wooden skewers and place three strategically in cake to keep cake stabilized. I put the skewers in this time - after the cake had slipped and slopped. Once I did that, the cream frosting seemed firm enough to stay in place. Despite problems with form, I will make again.

This was excellent. I made no changes, and I had none of the problems I see others here had (layers slipping, runny lemon curd, frosting not stiff enough). The only problem I had was the decoration on top slipping. I feel that if I had taken the instructions on how much of a border to leave around the lemon curd more seriously, I wouldn't have had this problem. It only slipped where it ended up being on top of lemon curd. I was able to patch it up satisfactorily.

This is the curd that would not boil! I have made the lemon curd in this recipe twice now, following the instructions exactly, and both times it has taken the curd over an hour to boil. I have made curds before, and don't understand what the problem is...medium heat, constant whisking...it's thicker, but not thick enough, and it's still not boiling. YIKES.

I followed the advice of previous reviewer(s) to make two 9" and split each in half. I don't care for a whip cream frosting AND because of all the issues with the cake sliding around, I instead made the white chocoloate buttercream from http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/108258 which is excellent. I made the curd as instructed on a Tues evening. I added poppyseeds to the cake which I made Wednesday. Made the frosting and assembled Thursday morning for dessert that evening. It turned out beautiful and tasty, everyone was MMMmmm'g. The cake was moist yet light. Because the buttercream hardens up in the fridge I had no issues with slippage. The curd was perfect, thick and tangy/sweet. Not only would I make this again, my family will insist on it. If you use the buttercream frosting recipe, be sure to pull the cake out to warm at room temperature about 3 hours before you plan on serving, otherwise the frosting is like a sheet of chocolate. This is really a fantastic cake and the four layer presentation with the curd and piping on top is impressive.

Delightful recipe!! My father grew up with a "lemon cheese" cake that his aunt used to make for him that is almost exactly like this. I am delighted to find such a great recipe. The only thing that I change is to add 2 tablespoons of lemon zest to the curd. MMM MMM MMM!!!

I have made this cake twice - both times a hit. The first time I added bottled lemon juice to the fresh squeezed. The cake disappeared in three days. The second time I just used the fresh squeezed and wow...what a difference...the lemon flavor was intense. The second cake was sweeter than the first one...the first time I baked it - it was light and airy - almost sponge cake but not as light. I am not sure what I did differently. I kept it in the refrigerator overnight to allow the curd to settle. Both times this cake was a hit. I am a chocolate lover and a lemon lover and given the choice between this and a chocolate cake, I'd chose this one.

the curd does taste good but it was leaking out the sides and ran off the top which made all the frosting puffs on top fall off. we sliced half the cake and then had to hold it together with a spatula to slice the rest since it was slipping off. it definetly didn't look like the pic but it did taste really good. the curd has so much flavor that you can't really taste the cake. i even had to throw some of the curd out because it was running off as soon as i put it on, i may make this as a big single layer cake. maybe put a ridge of frosting around the edges and then add the curd so it can't go anywhere. my cakes also sunk a lot in the middle. i turned them upside down to frost, maybe i shouldn't have and the frosting would have stayed.

I make this every single week. I adapted the recipe slightly by adding more sugar and a little more cornstarch to the curd, adding poppyseeds to the cake batter, and baking as cupcakes/muffins. They have become our breakfast staple. The texture is wonderful, and the lemony flavour is well-balanced. Yummy!

I had to make the curd twice because I overcooked it the first time. Take it off the heat as soon as it thickens and gets to the boiling point. But the final product was all it promised to be.

I thought that by incorporating everyone's suggestions that this cake would be divine. I added more lemon (meyer) to everything and layered the cake with lemon curd but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The best part of the cake was the curd and that wasn't even part of the recipe. The cake tasted good but it was way too dense for the style of cake. Everyone agreed that it should have been lighter/fluffier. Also, the frosting calls for too much sugar. I'll probably make this type of cake again but not with this recipe. If you do decide to make it- you have to add the curd, it makes the whole cake.

I was very disappointed in this one. The curd was great, the frosting was delicious but not firm enough for this cake. I added some vanilla pudding to stabalize it, but it still slipped.

Pretty good cake. I added a little more cornstarch to the curd since many reviewers complained about it running. I like the flavour and nice lemony tang this cake has.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. The cake is more of a sponge cake (not my favorite), and while I followed the directions closely and the cake looked great in the oven -- when I took the round out, they fell in the middle after cooling. The only benefit of this is that the lemon curd didn't run out the sides, but the cake was compressed and very underwhelming. Also, the lemon curd was tasty (despite what seems like an excessive number of eggs) but the cake itself lacked much of a lemony tang. There are a lot better cakes out there.

Scrumptious! With all the comments re:slippage, I swapped the whipped cream icing with the incredible ganache recipe that accompanies the Double Chocolate Layer Cake. Instead of regular chocolate, I used white chocolate and stirred in some of the lemon curd once it was chilled. This gave me the stability and lemon flavor that I wanted. The cake was finished with various berries on the top center and around the base. The cake is so rich that the berries were the perfect accompaniment.

I definitely had slippage issues with this cake. Next time I will either stabilize the whipped cream frosting or do a lemon cream cheese frosting. Also, my cake layers did not rise. Adding the sugar to the egg whites was the problem somehow. And it is DEFINITELY necessary to dam the layers with frosting or the curd seeps out and creates a mess.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. I did not find it as time-consuming as some of the others did: I made the curd 2 nights before serving, the icing the next morning, the cake in the afternoon and assembled the night before. It came out beautifully. I had no problems with slippage, perhaps because I put the icing first on each cake layer, piped a border around the edge and then put the curd in the middle. I think it's much easier to spread the curd on the icing than the other way around. My boyfriend loved this cake and I will certainly make it again!

Since my roommate loves all things lemon, I made this for her birthday. It was a huge hit - even the waitstaff at the restaurant tried it! I'm not a big fan of sugary frostings, so this creamy concoction was a nice change, and the lemon flavor really comes through overall.

Delicious! Cake is moist and tart. However, followed a previous reviewer's advice and used two 9" cake pans and then split the 2 cakes into 4 layers. As a result, I experienced no "slippage" problems with the finished cake. The recipe is time consuming. I suggest making the lemon curd and frosting the previous day. I would not make this cake in the summertime--too tricky with "melt-down" possibilties.

I also live in New Orleans and it is summertime, and I had no problems with the cake sliding. I did pipe a dam of icing in between each layer and put curd in the middle. It stayed put while I traveled. It is time consuming but worth the trouble. I will bake this cake again!

Made this for my wife's birthday. Everyone raved about the flavour. I thought it was pretty good, but it is a VERY time consuming recipe to make. I didn't seem to have any of the structural problems that others reported. The layers held up fine, and I didn't have any oozing or what not. When icing the whole thing, I did sneak it back into the fridge for an hour before doing the final "touch up" on the frosting. This is a great cake, but not for the impatient cooks out there.

I'm just rating the lemon curd -- very nice, tart but sweet. Since I'm not trying the whole cake, I can't speak to its necessity, assembly-wise, but you can omit the cornstarch. I also used a more common technique to make the curd -- add all but the butter, stir with a wooden spoon over *low* heat until curd thickens and coats the spoon like a custard. Turn off heat and add the butter piece by piece. It tood 12 minutes on the dot in a heavy pan.

This recipe gets four forks for taste and one fork for assembly instructions. This cake does not stack up, it is impossible and became one soupy mess! However, I came up with a clever solution, I stacked it in a trifle bowl and it looked beautiful as well as tasted incredibly good. Also forget the decorative topping, once again the frosting is too soupy for it to stand in peaks like this. I simply decorated the top with the lemon slices and it was a hit. Great recipe I would definately make it again, it's spectacular! but don't attempt stacking it as per the specified instructions.

My favorite lemon cake!! I have made this cake a few times, all with delicious results. However, I have noticed that as far as construction is concerned, you don't want to travel with it. (Make the cake and curd ahead, then if possible make the frosting and assemble at your location.) Also, I noticed that most of the people who had trouble with it sliding were from warm climates or made it in the summer. The one time I made it in May, it was a mess, although still a yummy mess.

Light, refreshing and delectable. This recipe needs no changes. The previous reviewer could avoid burning the curd by using a heavy saucepan (Calphalon is a good brand) and continually whisking it.

As a first-time lemon curd cook, I think the instructions for cooking the curd over medium heat is extremely problematic. If you want the curd to burn on the bottom of the saucepan and have whisked-in flecks of unsightly brown crud, then you should definitely follow the recipe's recommendation. Otherwise, cook your curd on low heat!!

This cake was good, but not the best lemon cake ever. The frosting and lemon curd were very tasty, but the cake came out kind of flat and chewy. It seemed like the layers didn't rise at all. I think that next time, I'll use the lemon curd and frosting with different cake layers. Another thing, it seems like the curd-frosting combo makes the layers too slidey. Maybe if you make a frosting dam around the oudside and then filled just the center of the layers?

After reading suggestions from other cooks, I also decided to use the cake from this recipe but use the frosting from the Lemon Layer Cake with Lemon Cream Frosting. It was a wonderful combination! I made it for my mother's 50 birthday party, and everyone thought it was fantastic. They are even still talk about it!

After reading the reviews and noting the assembly problems with this cake, I baked it in a rectangular 14 x 10 Pyrex pan, split it into two layers with a serrated knife, and reassembled the layers in the pan (adjusting the amounts of curd and frosting between the layers accordingly). The cake transported well for an office birthday. Cooled and filled, the cake rose just below the edge of the pan, so even with the whipped cream garnish and lemon slices, I was able to cover it snugly without ruining its presentation. A delicious change of pace from the usual buttercream birthday cake... This recipe is a keeper.

Elegant cake and very refreshing taste. Did not have any problems with cake sliding with the following changes: When making lemon curd only stir occasionally, until thickened. If you whisk it too often it will not thicken properly and will be too thin to hold up in the cake (even after refrigerating). Cake itself is a VERY plain sponge cake (a little to "spongy" as one reviewer wrote and bland). May try to find a more flavorful cake next time (however the lemon curd and whip cream compensate somewhat for the lack of cake flavor). I added only 1/2 to 3/4 cup of lemon curd to the frosting along with 2 T. dry instant vanilla pudding mix. When assembling the cake I topped each cake layer FIRST with the frosting, piped a border all around and THEN added the lemon curd in the middle. I had no problem assembling the cake and it all stayed in place without slipping. Personally I liked the three layers--more layers would have given it too strong of a lemon flavor. I'll definitely make this cake again.

I made this cake in a hurry, going against what all of the reviewers suggested. I made it in just a couple of hours. My suggestion to others would be not to refrigerate the curd in a bowl, but on a cookie sheet covered in the freezer. It really cuts down on the time it takes to make this cake. I also used pastry pride non dairy whipped topping insted of whipping cream.It just seemed to hard to get it right from what the other reviewers went through. This cake was really delicious and will be one I will make over and over.

This cake was delicious. But it definitely has structural problems. Despite stabilizing the icing with gelatin, making things ahead and keeping them ice cold, making a dam to hold in the curd, and using bamboo skewers to hold the cake together, the layers slid away from each other and the cake nearly toppled over. In retrospect, I'd be interested in how much gelatin people used (I used 1/2 t per cup whipping cream) and what the butterfat content of the cream was (for me, 33%). I also wonder why the layers have both curd and frosting. I suspect the layers would be more stable with one or the other. It sure did taste good though . . .

Every year for my friend's birthday we make each other a birthday cake. This friend is a great cook and we pride ourselves on spectacular cakes for this day! This cake is it! The lemon ranges from tart in the curd to suttle ans sweet in the frosting. Bring out the bowls and give yourself plenty of time, but its worth it! I also recommend stabilizing the frosting with the gelatin.

I just made this recipe for my father's 70th birthday and it was a huge hit. I would definitely make it again. I would definitely recommend stablizing the frosting with gelatin. According to the Pie and Pastry Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum, they recommend 1/2 - 1 tsp softened in 1 Tablespoon of water for approximately 1/2 c. of whipping cream. It's a definite must. Everything looked beautiful, until the whipped cream frosting started to droop down the sides. Otherwise, it was fabulous!!

I made this cake for my husband's grandmother's birthday and it was excellent. I followed the advice of adding some vanilla pudding to the whipping cream and when layering the curd, I pipped a border around each layer to stop the curd from leaking...this worked very well. I put on a "crumb" layer of icing and chilled the cake overnight and then added the top layer of icing and chilled for 5 hours, then added the top details and again chilled overnight. The cake travelled very well and everyone RAVED!!! Especially the Birthday Girl who doesn't enjoy rich and sweet desserts. A HIT THAT WILL BE MADE AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Very lemony! Excellent texture in the cake layers. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews and advice about the frosting, it nearly slid right off the cake it was so soft. Next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and stabilize the frosting.

Since everything that could go wrong probably did while I was trying to make this cake, I was pleasantly surprised that the mess I made was good enough to eat. But not good enough to try again. Undoubtably, the recipe was a little advanced for my nonexistent baking skills.

To simplify, I made a package white cake - adding the orange juice and lemon peel. That part turned out great! The "frosting" however was a disaster, turning the entire thing into a pile of goo. To save the situation, I cut it all up and made a trifle out of it, piping rosette "frosting" around the top. My guests loved it!

I have made this for 2 birthdays and my friends agree that it is sinful!Although i did prefer to stabalize the cream which made it firmer.To transport the cake to friends house i stuck 3 wooden skewers 1 inch from edge,this way it didn't slide during driving.

I have made this cake many times and it is always a crowd pleaser, and has become requested for birthdays.It is even better the 2nd day when the lemon curd has absorbed into the cake layers a bit. I usually have plenty of lemon curd left over for a small tart or with madelines, Yum!

I also had slippage problems the first time around. However the second time, I piped a "dam" of THICK frosting around the top of each layer and filled in with the lemond curd. The layers absolutely stayed in place and I now position all of my filled cakes this way.

I'm so glad I read the reviews first! It is time-consuming, and even using the advice here I found the layers tried to slip-slide away. Mine ended up a bit lopsided, but I made it look even with lots of frosting. With enough chilling before serving, it ended up looking wonderful! Lots of oohs and aaahs with this one. Excellent recipe.

Just what this recipe needs--another review--but I just wanted to add, that with a few of the changes that the previous reviewers have made, you can eliminate some of the slippage problems. This is delicious, VERY lemony, but somewhat time consuming. Start this cake a couple of days ahead. I made two, 9" cakes, splitting them when cool into 4 layers, then freezing them. I also added a couple of T. of the dry,instant vanilla pudding mix to the whipped cream. I increased the frosting ingredients to 1 c. powdered sugar and 3 c. whipped cream, but kept the curd to 1 1/4 c. I had plenty of frosting left over to pipe decorative borders. By chilling everything well, then, putting some wooden skewers in the cake, I had no problem with the cake slipping around, even taking it for an hour's ride over a very curvy road. I find these reviews very helpful and now print them out, along with the recipe.

I made this cake for a co-workers birthday. It was wonderful! I did make some changes as my friend wanted cream cheese frosting with the lemon cake. So I filled the layers with the leftover curd from the recipe and frosted the oustside with cream cheese frosting. I would definately make this again.

I looked at this recipe and decided it was too complicated. So what I did was make this cake recipe and use the frosting from the recipe for the "Lemon Layer Cake with Lemon Cream Frosting." The combo was delicious and it was far less complicated. I recommend it. Just be forewarned you have to make extra lemon curd.

I loved the frosting, and would definitely make it again. However, I will substitute a different cake recipe. I found the cake too spongy for my preferences.

Fabulous! It's very lemony, so watch out! I frosted it right before I ate it, and found that it was better after sitting the fridge overnight. The flavors mellowed somewhat and the cake became more moist; the parts that turned a bit crisp in the oven softened. I only made a half-batch to try but will definitely do the whole cake in the future.

I thought it was great, obviously only if you really like lemon. It was sweet and tart and had tons of great lemon flavor. I made all of the components the night before, then assembled on the morning of. It is true that the fosting slipped a lot, but hey, as my boyfriend (for who's birthday I made it) says "It all combines in your mouth anyhow!"

EXCELLENT! Everyone adored this cake. One woman was left speechless after having a slice. Only probs were with the frosting. Does anyone have any other ideas on how to firm up the frosting enough for transport?

This cake is excellent. I would recommend making the curd the day before. I used the 3 pans for the layer cake and this worked very well.

No contest! This is a definate must in the recipe file. Everyone loved it...and it looked wonderful too. I used 2, 9" pans and made it into four layers like one of the other reviews suggested. It turned out beautifully. In the future I would make the lemon curd and the frosting at least one day in advance. I found it way too much work for one day (unless you have nothing else to cook or bake). On the other hand-it was definately worth the effort.

I will mostly echo others in the review since all advice was right on the money. The cake is absolutely delicious but requires some time and patience. I needed to use the abundance of lemons in my backyard and decided to take this as my contribution to my family's Christmas dinner. This is a cake best served in the safety of your own home - transport it at your own risk! All comments about frosting slippage are very true. If you absolutely must take the cake elsewhere, I would recommend securing the layers with wooden skewers to avoid the near disaster I had. Once you've completed the cake and served it safely, you won't be disappointed! I will definitely make this again (for an at-home dinner party!).

Simply the finest cake I have made, and my guests agreed. Made the curd (it was easy) and cake (2 pans) a day ahead. Froze the cakes in the freezer overnight (try it!). Split the layers the next day (not easy, but no one will see the mistakes), increased the frosting by 50% (needed it), and added fresh blueberries to compliment the lemon flavor and add decoration. Awesome!

I am preparing this cake for the 3rd time. Its been served at numerous functions,and each time was a hit. I am pleased to read some different process's to remedy the frosting. I also had problems getting it to hold up. It was requested of me to make it for my daughters birthday cake. Yummmmmm Yummmmm Don't pass this up. Allow lots of prep time.

As an owner/operator of a small Bed and Breakfast in Central Maine I am always on the look-out for a new and tasty recipe. This one has certainly earned a spot in my favorite folder! After reading the reviews I was a little nervous about the cake sliding so I added 2 Tbls. of dry vanilla instant pudding to the cream during whipping. (I also used heavy cream.) I was able to frost the cake within a half hour! Such spectacular results....absolutely one of the most delicious tasting and beautifully presented cakes I have ever done.

This is a fantastic cake! I made this recipe exactly as described except made 4 layers, and it turned out perfect. I had no trouble with the frosting setting or the layers sliding or falling apart. The batter fits fine in two 9" pans without overflowing in the oven.

This cake produced very mixed feelings in me. It was delicious but it fell apart and was not overly beautiful half an hour after I finished it. I think it would be much better with the lemon curd recipe from Cooking Light May 2000 which tastes much better than this lemon curd. Definetly allow lots of time to refrigerate components because this cake falls apart if the frosting isn't very cold.

Rating: 4
Just have to put my two cents in! This is indeed a fabulous recipe. I made a horrible mistake and whipped the lemon curd into the cream rather than folding it in and could not get the mixture to thicken. I whipped up an additional two cups of cream and fold part of the liquid mixture into it. The lemon flavor was still strong in the whipped cream frosting even with my alteration, and I think the extra whip also served to stabelize it. I concur with the previous comment that if you allow plenty of time to make this cake so that all has a chance to chill properly it will turn out beautifully. I made mine with four layers--two layers baked and split into four. Everybody loved it!!

Rating: 3
The cake was very tasty but the frosting gave me some problems. I used gelatine as a stabalizer and it still slipped after the cake was frosted. The layers were too heavy for the filling so it oozed out a little. Next time I will make two layers and split them.

What a great cake to use up the Meyer lemons that were in our back yard last month! I used the "Whipit" powder for a cream stabilizer, made cake and curd the day before and didn't have any problems. I also made two layers and split them into 4. For those who can't get Meyer lemons (they're not grown for shipping commercially), substitute 1/3 of the amount with orange juice. Think you'll like that. What a nice change from all the lemon meringue/lemon cream pies.

I don't think this cake was that hard to make, it just needs to be done over a couple of days so you allow sufficient time for everything to cool and set up. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! and I can't wait to make it again.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and it received rave reviews. It was very time consuming but worth the effort for a special occasion. I did have trouble with the topping at first but I frosted only the top and finished the sides in the morning. It was much stiffer the next day. I would definitely make it again.

I made this cake last Easter for my boyfriend's family and now they think that I am a professional pastry chef. The curd was delicious and good enough to eat by itself. The final cake was beautiful and tasty, although it did take a lot of work to construct. The only warning I would give is that the whipped cream needs to be very stiff and the cake well-chilled after decorating. My whipped cream fell a bit and the layers were prone to sliding. All in all, it was worth the work for the "oooo's" and "ahhhhhs" I received.

The only thing that I would do differently is to make sure that the whipped cream was VERY stiff. The top layers put a lot of weight on the bottom layer and the whipped cream and lemon curd ooze out. But the cake was so delicious we didn't care!

I make an elegant desert each year for thanks giving, and tend choose things that are lighter as a counerpoint to the season & the meal. This cake was a fun challenge to make and definate winner if you love lemon as much as I do. I was not happy with the cake layers. They turned out very dense and coarse. I suspect the problem was more with the preparation than the recipie though so I am trying it again.

I made this recently for my son-in-law's birthday. It was a great success. When I make it again however, I would probably modify it as follows: - make 2 layers instead of 3, and split each layer into 2 - make about 1/3 or 1/2 more frosting and spread between the split layers. I was unsuccessful in getting a real firm frosting although I whipped the cream for a long time. Consequently I didn't even attempt any use of a pastry bag as I think it would have been wasted effort. Also, I cheated and used store-bought lemon curd - it still tasted good and saved some time.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday and it received rave reviews! I am planning on making it again for another friend's birthday (by request). It is very lemony, but if you substitute juice from Meyer lemons for at least 1/2 of the juice called for it will cut down on the tartness (that is what I did and the curd was very delicious).

This cake was a great success at a birthday party. It is quite a bit of work but worth it. I added fresh blueberries between the layers and a pile of blueberries on top. The icing is very soft and does not really hold its shape so using a pastry bag is not really necessary. A word of advice: the lemon curd is an ingredient in both the icing and cake so MUST be made 4 hours in advance of the rest (even though it is not included in the ingredient list for the cake and icing ), a fact that I noticed only when I was well into the middle of the cake making.

This cake was fabulous! I made the curd and layers a day ahead and they held up beautifully. I did find that the frosting slipped a bit, but putting it back in the fridge fixed that. It looked so great that it went for $350 at a family dessert auction. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday and it was a big hit. Personally I thought it was a little too lemony, but others seemed to think it was great! I did not have any problem with the frosting, but I used a Kitchenaid mixer and beat the whipping cream to within an inch of being butter. I think the secrets, along with beating well, are not to over handle the frosting and to keep it cold. I would return it to the refrigerator for a short while before going on to the next layer and did not have any problems with "slipping".

I took one reviewer's advice and used gelatin in the whipped cream -- the icing held up nicely!! The layers of cake are delicious on their own -- light and delicately flavored. The curd is also delicious on its own. I think the whipped cream could have done without the lemon flavor - it was just a bit of overkill (all that lemon flavor!). I would definitely make this cake again!

The cake was delicious, however I would recommend strongly to make sure that your cream is VERY cold. The whipped cream needs to be set in order to keep the cake from 'slipping'. I am planning to use a little gelatin the next time we make this cake to help the decorative edges stay set without wilting.

an instant hit and the best recipe I have ever gotten from Bon Appetit. Two of our children asked that this be their next birthday cake, and the finished it off for breakfast the next day!
