Wonderful. Some of the oysters did pop. We have made them several time.

Our oysters popped - in fact a couple exploded - so cover the grill. The fresh flavors of the salsa are nicely contrasted by the intensity of the sauce. First time oyster eaters went back for seconds. Delicious summer recipe. Easy yet elegant & unique.

Loved it. Some of my oysters "popped" and some didn't. What would the right temp be for a gas grill? 500 degrees?

One thing people have to remember is getting the grill nice and hot. If its not hot enough they wont "pop". Also in reguards to the siracha recommendations sorry its doesnt fit in with my taste. Siracha is very similar to tabasco sauce and I dislike the flavor it adds.

FORGET THE RED CHILE SAUCE. USE SIRACHA INSTEAD. YOU WILL BE PLESANTLY SURPRISED.

We grill oysters often, they never pop, some open slightly but oysters are not like clams or mussels. We do 7 minutes on hot coals on the grill and they are perfect.

Fabulous! Even guests that do not like oysters liked this. The sauces were easy to make and the combined flavors were delicious. My oysters didn't "pop" like we expected so we left them on the grill longer which overcooked some of the smaller ones, but everyone devoured those as well. This is a definite keeper.

We've made this recipe a few times now, and still haven't had the oysters pop open. Once we left them on longer and they were overcooked. Now, we just cook them for the appointed time and shuck 'em - they are absolutely fabulous cooked this way. Mmm...

We made the costly mistake of not having the grill quite hot enough for the first batch of oysters, so they did not just "pop" the way he claimed they should. The second try however, was excellent. The plump, juicy oysters with the accompaniments was amazing. I made the condiments as the recipe specified, and the oysters were Blue Point.
