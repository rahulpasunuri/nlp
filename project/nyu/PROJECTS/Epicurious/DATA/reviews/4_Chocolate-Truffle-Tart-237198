This simple preparation--which can be completed well in advance of serving it-- produces an elegant dessert, perfect for a small dinner party. It is rich so the eight-inch size is perfectly adequate for eight to ten people. I like serving it with fruit like raspberries and cream or even just a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance the richness a bit. The texture is good, although I agree with the reviewer who recommends adding a little espresso powder for some depth of flavor. This is a very reliable recipe for a popular dessert.

This is an incredible recipe. Try pairing it with a white chocolate cream sauce to go w/it: heat heavy whipping cream & white chocolate together until you get a creamy/icing like consistency. Warm white choc sauce in microwave slightly before serving, pour on botton of plate. Serve choc tart at room temp on top of sauce and add fresh strawberries on the side. I have made this many, many times.....it gets rave reviews!! By the way, both the choc tart and sauce can be frozen.

Used the Nabisco Famous wafers per the receipe and was pleasantly surprised 1) at how well and evenly they crumbed in the food processor; 2) that they were not at all greasy like many (most!) other cookies I have used for crusts in the past; 3) their great flavor. This tart got "Wows" from my guests on first bite. Will definitely make again.

Excellent. Served for Valentine's Day dinner party. A failsafe and easy recipe. My guests raved about this. Used Nabisco chocolate grahams. Served with whipped cream and strawberry garnish as previously suggested. I know there will be requests for this again.

This was an amazing recipe - with a little help. Just add lingonberries and whipped cream and this cake is kicked up by several notches.

This was super simple to make, no time at all. However, it was just okay, nothing spectacular that people asked me for the recipe. I wont make again, there are many other WOW chocolate recipes out there.

I made this for my Mom's birthday and it was wonderful - My 13 year old niece LOVED it and wanted to make it to enter it in a contest for one of her organizations...and she WON!!! It is now a huge family favorite.

Very good for chocolate lovers and simple to prepare. Served with raspberries mashed with a little sugar. I made this in a 9" springform and increased all the ingredients by 25%. I couldn't find the cookies and used chocolate graham crackers instead. I had to bake the crust almost double the stated time, maybe it was due to the cookie substitution? Make sure to let it warm up a little before serving or it will be hard to cut and won't taste as creamy.

I've made this many, many times now, and the only change I would make to it is adding a teaspoon of instant espresso powder. It really brings out the flavor of the chocolate.

excellent. if you dont have nabisco wafers on hand, oreos work just as well - just add a little less butter. delish!!!!

This is absolutely fantastic! If you're a chocolate lover, and of course you are or you wouldn't be looking at this recipe, then give this a try. Incredibly simple. Using quaility chocolate is a must. Fresh whipped cream with a few chocolate shavings make this decadent!

very nice, rich chocolate dessert that isn't too over the top. i used anna's swedish thin cookies (very popular in manhattan groceries) in various flavors (orange, cappucino), all to great effect. the only thing i'd change about this recipe is the 3/4 stick of butter used for the crust. it ended up being much too greasy. I SUGGEST CUTTING IT DOWN TO AT MOST 4 TBSP, you really don't need the excess fat for the crust.

This received rave reviews at a party I hosted. It is rich and creamy and easy to make. Even my husband, who doesn't like chocolate, loved this dessert. Unfortunately, I have to share the leftovers with him!

Delicious dessert! Smooth, creamy, definite crowd pleaser. Fresh berries would make it over-the-top!

I already gave this 4 forks after reading the recipe. I am making it for Easter and it can't be any less than a 4. Note to KimJSCP from Portland, OR--Nabisco has been making "Famous Chocolate Waffers" for years and they're still being made. They are addictive in their simplicity. I used to eat them by the box--not any more.

This was really wonderful, with a perfect balance of sweet and bitter! I followed the recipe exactly, except I increased the quantities by 25% to compensate for using a 9" pan. I used Trade Joe's Chocolatey Cats Cookies for People (I am assuming that by giving a count for the cookies, they meant Nilla Wafers, however, Nabisco no longer makes them in Chocolate) and I used a Belgian bittersweet chocolate from Trader Joe's with 60% cacao or less. I served it with crème fraîche and a blackberry sauce I made by cooking somewhat sour frozen berries with sugar until thickened.

I loved this dessert! Not only was it easy, it tasted great! Like some other users, I couldn't find the chocolate wafers so I used improvised with 7 of the 100-calorie packs of oreo chocolate wafers! A bit unusual, but it came out great. I also used Valrhona 61% cocoa bittersweet chocolate - yum!

Oh, I love the idea of using thin mints for the crust-- a minty twist for St. Patrick's Day-- as those Nabisco wafers can be pretty elusive. I found some in Palau, of all places, and followed the recipe exactly. This rich, melt-in- your-mouth truffle is worth every minute in the gym it will take to undo the damage!

Spectacular. Made it for a dinner party for 12. Used 9" springform and scaled recipe up by 1/3 (never too many truffles -- which is what this recipe is). Added 2Tbsp cognac. We like it bitter, so next time will use 72% cacao chocolate. Served with pomegranate gelato and blood orange gelato, using Gourmet 9/06 recipe (substituting half/half for cream and milk; the other was too fatty) and 2 cups pomegranate juice or blood orange puree.

I used Girl Scout Cookie Mints and 4 tablespoons butter. Crushed the whole box worth of cookies and used 3/4 for crust and rest for sprinkling on top. Fabulous!

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious. I couldn't find the Nabisco Famous crackers, so I used chocolate flavored graham crackers instead, and the crust turned out great. The filling was rich, smooth and delicious. Next time I will top with crème fraiche or whipped topping, as suggested in the previous review. The whole family loved it, I will definitely make again.

My neighbor made this for my husband and I when they had us over for a dinner party. I couldn't believe the heavenly rich chocolate flavor. I don't believe that I have ever had such a wonderful desert without being at a restaurant. I can't wait to make this for my chocolate loving friends!

It was deep, dark, and turned out beautifully -- looked just like the picture from the magazine. Served chilled, the consistency of my tart wasn't pudding-like, but much closer to a firm ganache. I used prepackaged Oreo crumbs for the base (never been able to find the wafers), and 62% cacao content bittersweet chocolate chips. I do have to admit that, while I like dark chocolate, this was rather too bitter for my taste (which is my own fault, having used the 62%). It's really rich: we sliced it into really thin slivers for serving. In retrospect, I think it needs to be accompanied by either some creme fraiche or a citrus-scented whipped cream, so that there's some sweetness and acidity to cut the tart's rich bitterness.

This was a pretty good dessert. I made it for my g/f for Valentine's Day and it had a simple, yet delectable taste and presentation. It was VERY, VERY rich, so that is something to take into consideration and forewarn your guests. I do not have an 8-inch springform pan, so I used a 9-inch and and did a calculation where I multiplied the ingredients by a factor of 1.25 to get roughly the same volume density (something to keep in mind for those without an 8-inch springform pan). I used Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chocolate bars, and the taste was maybe a touch too bitter for my tastes, but still very good. In the future I might experiment with other chocolate types. As far as cooking the dish, I had to cook mine for less than 20 minutes, so keep an eye on the timer. The recipe says to cool the recipe in the refrigerator after cooling on the rack. I would recommend taking it out of the fridge about 30-40 minutes before serving, since it was a little to hard directly out of the fridge. The texture of the dish was very dense and creamy--almost a cross between fudge, pudding, and brownies.

I didn't have the wafers, but I did have a store-bought chocolate cookie pie crust from the co-op, so I used that. It worked fine. I used a 4 oz. Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate bar and a 3.5 oz. bar of Lindt bittersweet. This is very rich -- just broaching too rich. Would be good with some raspberry sauce or something to cut it a bit. Very impressive, though, and relievingly easy in a temporary kitchen without my KitchenAid to whip things!

Luxury. As long and hard as I searched for the Nabisco chocolate wafer cookies, I couldn't find any. In truth, I couldn't find any non-creme-filled wafers, so I ended up buying (wait for it) Weight Watchers Oreo crisps. They worked surprisingly well.

Very easy and delicious, it looked just like the photo. I only had a 9 1/2 " springform and it turned out beautifully. Served with whipped cream and strawberries, it was a hit at my Book Club. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent, easy tart. Found the flavor to improve with age; would make the day before needed. Serve with raspberries or strawberries. A lovely dessert!

Easy and decadent -I made a heart stencil and used powdered sugar to dust on the hearts. A few raspberries on the side would be perfect.

I served this at a superbowl party and it was a big hit. Very chocolatey. Each bite tasted like a truffle. I couldn't find the 8" pan, so it was a little flat.

Made for a girls dinner party using Annie's chocolate wafers. Everyone said it was the best chocolate dessert they had ever had outside a restaurant. Easy to make.

We loved it. My husband said that it was restaurant quality. This has a very deep chocolate taste and is best served with a little whipped cream.
