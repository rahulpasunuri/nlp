Read the reviews and tweaked the recipe. 3 forks for as made, 4 forks for variations. My variations were simple: Added a cup of chopped toasted pecans with the cranberries, doubled the cranberries, used half of the olive oil, and did not have butternut squash to add so that was omitted. The flavors were so delicious! I will make this one time and again!

very good, however, you have to add toasted almonds to this dish, or at least a lot of nuts of some kind. it needs a crunch or it will be mushy and plain. the almonds made the dish. also, i used veg stock instead of water and i used 4 cups, not 3, of squash. used tart cherries, chopped, instead of cranberries because they are not sweetened. i added celery to the onions and carrot and some cayenne for heat. ground cinnamon is fine. this is a great dish.

I also cooked the rice and squash separately. The squash produces a lot of liquid! But the flavor was wonderful!

I prefer to use acorn squash, cut in half and roasted in the oven, upside down, until tender and caramelized. I prepare the rest of the recipe as written, minus squash, then fill the squash halves with the rice mixture. This dish is not as good the second day and does not freeze well.

Really good when made as a reviewer below suggested. I roasted the squash with onions, ginger, garlic, curry powder & cumin (no cooked carrots allowed in this family, I'm afraid). Boiled brown rice (& only rice) separately with cinnamon. Even my usually squash-avoiding husband liked it.

Umm.. someone forgot to account for the mass of water that butternut squash relinquishes when cooked.. I'm leaving it uncovered for the last eight minutes.

This pilaf turned out beautifully! I served with roasted pork loin for a lovely fall meal. It would also be great with turkey. I used a 7 quart Le Creuset, which helped make this dish a success.

Very nice blend of flavors, with the curry, cinnamon, ginger, and cranberries. The squash and apple work well with the rices. After the saute of the initial ingredients I cooked this in a rice cooker, and it came out perfect. This dish, like many, loses its zing as leftovers.

This is an excellent recipe, good hot or lukewarm. It holds well. I substituted garnet yams for the squash and thought it delicious.

There's an easy fix for this recipie - i make a variation of it all the time for holiday dinners. simply roast the butternut and onions (and apples, whatever) on a cookie sheet with curry, salt and a small amount of butter. Prepare the roasted veggies as you cook the rice separately, then fold the whole thing together at the end. The roasted butternut takes on a great glaze, remains firm enough to stand up on its own, and the flavors contrast nicely in the finished dish.

Well, I said that I would make this again but I will change it. We did not care for the texture of the squash in with this dish, I don't think that it added anything at all. Next time I will cook and serve the squash separately. The rest of the dish is quite tasty and a different mix of textures and ingredients.

With a few alterations, this dish can be graet. I used i part white rice to 1 part wild rice. I cooked the rice in chicken brith and added a bay leaf and one whole clove of garlic to the stock. When the rice is done, I added chopped scallions and the cranberries. A new favorite!

Not sure what I did wrong, but it was awful. We threw the whole thing out.

I cook a lot of rice and pilaf and this dish was awful - not enough rice, squash and apples were too mushy and spices were not exciting if you are used to eating East Indian food.

I was frightened at first by the mix of spices, but it turned out amazing! Nice contrast to the sweet items on the table at Thanksgiving like sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce. It was even good cold as I snuck into the kitchen late one night!

Unusual and delicious! I plan to serve it again with roast turkey.

I made this recipe for my family (they are vegans) for Christmas. I have never had such an amazing reaction! They loved it. We added cranberry sauce on top instead of cranberries. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

We served this at Christmas dinner with honey-baked ham - what a wonderful compliment. The pilaf took closer to an hour to absorb the rice. Used broth for half of the water and ground cinnamon instead of the stick. The flavors were very fall-like - perfect for the damp, cold weather.

This dish is wonderful. I first made it on Thanksgiving and now have made this recipe more than once. The first time I made it I had a lot of squash so added twice as much squash as the recipe called for without changing the amount of rice. This worked really well! I also used a mixture of rice called Wild Rice Blend with Texmati (white, brown, red, and wild rice). The whole dish can be cooked in a rice cooker.

Outstanding! Great mix of spices and texture. The heartiness of the rice with sweetness of the pumpkin/carrots and curry spice is creative and most delicious. We added some hatch chili peppers for more spice, but the recipe stands great on its own!

With all the different ingredients I thought the flavors might be overwhelming, but it turned out great! I would definitely make it again.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. The flavors blended very well and the aroma filled the house. I had lots of requests for the recipe. I will be adding this recipe to my list of dishes that I serve on Thanksgiving and throughout the year.

Our Thanksgiving guest list included some vegetarians, so we decided this was the prefect choice for dresssing. It was a hit; enjoyed by all and even rated recipe requests! We stuck close to the recipe except we steamed the squash for 10 minutes before it was sauted briefly in butter with a pinch of salt and a little cinnamon and nutmeg (along with the cranberries) then stired it in with the cooked rice mix. Definately on the "repeat" list of recipies!

I am a relatively new cook and follow recipes to a T. The flavors were great and everyone raved, however, visually everything was mush. The butternut squash basically disolved and did not stay beautifully cubed. Perhaps adding it later will help.
