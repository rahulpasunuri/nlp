Definitely not worth the time or effort! came out tasteless, without good texture. was too hard for a cake too!

This cake had great potential, bananas and chocolate - what could go wrong? It was chewy and doughy - like it needed something - oil or butter. And it could have used the spark of salt. I cut it up like biscotti and baked it a little longer - and I will eat it with my coffee. I hate to throw it out.

Not worth the ingredients or the time and unless you are serving VERY large pieces it does not deliver a serving of fruit. Texture was so so and the banana almost overwhelmed the chocolate.

I am new to baking and so am extra cautious in following each the recipe to the T, but it kind of disappointed. I made this for our wedding anniversary as a surprise for my hubby and unfortunately he appreciated only the health factor of the cake. The cake was very dense and did not rise well. Moreover, we all felt the sugar was less for the bite. My guess is that the whole-wheat flour may have made it rather extra dense. However, I still feel that with a little tweaking around someone more experienced with baking may be able to win it, not me :( Not sure if I will try this again.

This recipe was great -- quick, delicious and easy. I substituted sugar for the splenda and used only 1/2 cup of sugar in the cake and in the frosting. The cake was dense and delicious. I used whipping cream instead of the non-fat milk in the frosting which may have made the frosting a little richer. I will use this frosting recipe for other cakes as well from now on.

Very dense cake. I enjoyed it, but some of my friends said it "tasted healthy". Good for the individual who craves chocolate and wants to make a smart dessert decision. As stated in a previous review, I probably would not make this for guests.

Followed recipe exactly... So good! Will definitely make again. Very, very yummy!

I liked this! "It's a great way to use up ripe bananas" is not usually a factor when picking a chocolate cake recipe, but this fit the bill for that today. I found it a fun and tasty alternative to banana bread. I'd agree it's not very chocolate cakelike, more a cross between cake and a sweetbread. Not really sweet but sweet enough. I had no Splenda on hand so used 1 full c regular sugar. I left out the walnuts to make up for that and keep the calories in check. Sans icing, mine is about 175 cal/serving (12 servings) and with icing, again w/ straight sugar, only about 275/piece. Healthy, good alternative to regular cake. I'd make it again but maybe not for company unless the company is dieting. :-)

Well I made a few changes. First I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of using the all purpose. Then I used white and brown sugar-1/4 cup of each. When I was making the batter it was far too dry, so i added some milk to thin it out. Instead of using a pan i used muffin tins and the muffins were ready to be taken out of the oven in 25 minutes... The muffins were not sweet at all, but very nice texture. Would make again with a few changes, maybe add some chocolate chips

I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I used milk, and used sugar instead of Splenda and pecans instead of walnuts. The cake came out moist and dense. It was not too sweet but not bitter at all. I also used only 1/3 of the sugar in the frosting. Pretty tasty for how simple and quick it was.

My family agrees that it is worth making again. Consider that is a pretty healthy choice for a cake.

Not terrible, but definitely not good....tastes like bitter chocolate banana bread. Tried adding Kahlua, more splenda, and a touch of fat free half/half to the icing but couldn't ever reach the impressive point. Out of sheer last minute desperation, I served it to company, but ended up throwing most of the cake away. Not making again.

This recipe was a complete hit with everyone at the fourth of July party this year! The cake was very moist and extremely satisfying!
