I cooked the inside bits a little before adding the filling and it turned out deliciously. Used crushed rice chex and toasted hazelnuts as crust and filled with PB, jelly, and mashed bananas. Delish.

Fairly simple to make and tasted great. Also, it doesn't need a full cup of cornflakes. Will definitely make again!

I'm not the best cook so you'll have to take this with a grain of salt but the recipe really didn't work for me. Maybe I did something wrong but the middle was all soggy (not in a good way) and the flavour wasn't so great. Maybe it would be better with the granola and without the double layer!

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my dad for Father's Day and he hasn't stopped talking about it since. I used crushed up maple granola instead of cornflakes and I think it adds to the texture more than cornflakes would. A dollop of freshly whipped cream on top doesn't hurt either. I would also say that having two slices of bread isn't 100% necessary and makes it a bit cumbersome to eat, but that's just personal preference. Overall, the recipe is wonderful and I will continue to make it for my friends and family.

Would love this using brioche. To make a little tropical, add some shredded sweet coconut and fresh crushed and drained pineapple....

How does this get a 4 fork rating without any reviews? Epicurious, stop skewing the ratings!!!!!!
