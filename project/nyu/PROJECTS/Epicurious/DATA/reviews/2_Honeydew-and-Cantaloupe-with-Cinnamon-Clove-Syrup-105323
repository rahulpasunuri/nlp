While this ended up tasting pretty good, it was really not worth the time and effort. Reducing the sugar syrup in step one is time consuming, and when it gets close to being reduced enough, the syrup has a tendency to start foaming so you need to make this in a largish/deep pot. Once you've cooled the syrup and put it all together, it does taste good, but not overwhelmingly so. What makes this recipe a non repeater for me is that the leftover cantelope weeps copious amounts of liquid after an hour or so of letting it stand. So you can't make this the night before, or eat it the next day. Grr.
