As part of our Gourmet club menu - this did not go over especially well with the group. The flavors were a bit muddied.

I HAVE TRIED WITH MINT SAUCE, IT GOES QUITE WELL. IN THE RAITA PINCH OF SALT & SUGAR CAN BE ADDED.

This is delicious. It is a wonderful holiday meal especially with cranberry chutney and basmati rice.
