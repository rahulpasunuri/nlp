Nope, bad choice, it tastes not good, I wasted 4 lemons :(

I also just made the dressing. Found it lovely over a spinach salad just as is.

I only made the dressing and used it over a plain-vanilla greens+tomato+onion salad. I felt it would need more oil, so I added 2 TB canola oil to the recipe; also used the Microplan grater for the ginger with the usual outstanding results. A keeper!

I added some rice vinegar and some olive oil to the dressing as I found the lemon/sesame combo a little bit strong. Everyone at the dinner party asked for the recipe.

I had to make the won ton strips twice; the first time I followed the recipe and they were terribly dry. The second time I tossed them in oil before baking and they turned out the way I would have wanted them to. The salad dressing was very bitter - way too much ginger (should be 1 tsp rather than 1 tbsp ?)which was really disappointing! There are way too many good salad recipes out there to want to make this again.

Was looking for a sesame dressing for chinese chicken salad and found this recipe interesting because it had crisp won ton strips in it. The link doesn't take you to the recipe for the won ton strips so you'll have to do a separate search for "Crisp Won Ton Strips". That takes you to two recipes, one which uses the strips, and the other for the strips themselves. The recipe bakes the won ton wrappers, not fries, as suggested by one reviewer.

It is true that the link to " won ton strips " is pointing incorretly to an apple cake recipe. But that shouldn't hinder one from trying this recipe. Won Ton wrappers can be bought at most local grocery stores, and they can be cut into strips and fried. Or one may purchase canned Won Ton strips in the oriental food aisle.
