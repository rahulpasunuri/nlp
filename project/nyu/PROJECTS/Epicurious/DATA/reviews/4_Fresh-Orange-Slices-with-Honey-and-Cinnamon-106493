Really simple and good. Served with a homemade lemon ice cream. I didn't have any orange water, but it came out fine without it.

I made these for a second time with Navel oranges as I couldn't get Blood oranges before Christmas. Very tasty and refreshing, a good palate cleanser between the main course and dessert.

Excellent recipe. Last week I made a similar thing with oranges, with the addition of olive oil at serving time. What makes it great is that you can serve it as an appetizer, snack or dessert. Congrats!

I would make this again, but only if the oranges are really good all by themselves. The sauce, unfortunately, doesn't help bland oranges.

Super EZ recipe. I paired it with the choc pistachio torte - yum!

So easy to make!! I couldn't find orange flower water, so I used Triple Sec instead. I served it with a chocolate almond cake. It was a big hit at dessert!

Excellent. If you use a mandoline, I suggest picking very firm oranges and/or refrigerating them before slicing.

Very light and refreshing. The flavors are unusual and pleasant. The orange flower water is haunting and elegant. Served as dessert after a spicy dinner -- perfect choice. Good for those who don't want a heavy dessert, but would like something sweet to finish the meal. I already have plans to make it again!

I made this over the summer and loved it. I'd totally forgotten about it but came across is searching for something else. It was so light and delicious - a perfect summer ending.

This is a simple dish that was so refreshing. A great side dish or dessert. The almonds added A LOT! I tried slicing with a food processore. Okay, that was a mistake. The more you handle the oranges, the more they fall apart. Even though summer is not a time for this fruit, it really was good with a cook out. It would be great in the winter as well. Enjoy!
