Well, it did come out as bark. It was hard to make but it looks fabulous on top of our double chocolate layer cake. It is on epicurious to.

I couldn't get this recipe to work, either. I tried it at different temperatures and levels of hardnesses and with different tools. I think I'll take the other reviewer's advice and peel curls off a block of chocolate, instead.

Curls? What curls? It came out more like tree bark but nothing resembling curls. I made the recipie again with a touch of oil to hold the chocolate together and it didn't work. I used a metal spatula, knife, and other impliments with no success. Use a vegetable peeler on block chocolate - that works!
