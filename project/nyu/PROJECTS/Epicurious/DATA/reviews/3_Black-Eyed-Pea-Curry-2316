Needed modifications, but a great base recipe. I made it for 40 people and made the following additions/changes: 1.) started with dried black-eyed peas, soaked and drained. Way cheaper. 2.) Added some honey, raisins, cumin, garlic, coconut milk, peas and chopped collard greens. 3.) Served it with a side of Patak brand mango-chili chutney for optional spice. 4.) Definitely make the day before and let it sit overnight. Flavors are much better the next day.

I liked this recipe, even though I modified it to meet my spicy tastes. I used vegetable broth instead of water and doubled the curry. The tomatoes I added were canned/stewed tomatoes with a little jalapeno in them. Planning to serve over rice, and maybe adding a dollop of plain yogurt with the cilantro. Yummy!

I really didn't care for this dish and am unsure why it received such high reviews. I tried adding spinach, red pepper flakes and cumin and it was a bit better, but definitely wouldn't make this again.

I got fresh black-eyed peas from the market and needed a recipe... really liked this one; added some cinnamon which we thought was great. Make sure not to skip the cilantro - it really pulls it all together.

I rated this a solid 3 forks. I added a pinch of fennel seed powder, 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp of coriander seed powder. I also doubled the amount ginger and added 2 large minced garlic cloves to the saute. This definitely combatted the blandness. Adding a little water helped with the consistency as well.

This dish is fun because you can play around with it. I omitted the potato and added an extra 1/2 cup of tomato, a 10 oz package of frozen spinach, a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, salt, and an extra teaspoon of curry powder. I also added some water because I thought it was a little dry at first. It was delicious served over brown rice.

I thought this dish was really bland. I tried adding cayenne, garlic, spinach, anything! It just didn't work out.

I thought this was great! I used dried black eyed peas (soaked in cold water for 8 hours) and added some cayenne pepper for kick. you could easily add spinach or cauliflower or even chicken or tofu. really good!

This was very easy to prep and cook, yet had very complex flavors - particularly after it refrigerated overnight. If you have any onion-wary people in the house, you may want to trim down the amount you add. I doubled this recipe and served it over a black, nutty rice. Delicious!

Pretty good for a basic curry. Might want to add some cayenne for extra spice. Also good with garbanzos.

I was impressed with the dish...and it would be a good basis for any type of curry recipe. After you do it for the first time following the directions, you could augment the ingredients however you like
