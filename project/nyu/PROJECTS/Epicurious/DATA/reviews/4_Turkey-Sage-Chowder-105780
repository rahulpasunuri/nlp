We make this recipe a couple of times a year- Thanksgiving and Christmas. As many have noted (and the recipe encourages) we edit certain parts and add additional items. I find it works well with 2/3 fresh made turkey stock and 1/3 milk. Ignore the canned soup(it's just sugar, preservatives and cornstarch) and if you want that slightly glossy texture just add a bit of cornstarch. Our version this year is yummy with leeks, long cooked green beans and corn.

Like others, I don't particularly like to rate recipes if I've changed them, but this recipe is a great starting off point and I didn't deviate too far from the original. Instead of adding canned soup, I added some flour after sauteing the potatoes and onions and a little heavy cream to thicken it up. I also added some left over gravy (why not!?) and a couple of heaping tablespoons of creme fraiche because I had them in the fridge. Otherwise, I kept it pretty much the same. It was a great way to use up our thanksgiving leftovers.

I agree with those who have said that this is a good jumping off point for soup. The sage is wonderful doubled even tripled (my favorite spice). The bacon is not important. Omitting the can soup is almost a no brainer. We were going to substitute a rue but as the soup cooked it was obvious it was not important either. I did not make this recipe, I used it as a tool for making soup that had many of the same ingredients in it. I thought that I would make this soup but changed my mind while chopping onions. Additions corn (frozen), leeks (fresh), home made broth from thanksgiving bird, and much more turkey than was called for. I just hope I can reproduce this again.

Forget the turkey, add some corn, and go nuts on the sage. I turned this into a sage chowder, by piling in as much sage as I could find at the grocery store. Always a big hit.

I am a vegetarian and my hubby is a self-proclaimed turkey-hater, but as we had his family over for Thanksgiving, we made the traditional meal and had lots of leftovers. Times being what they are, i was not about to throw away perfectly good food, so made this recipe as written with the exception of using mashed potatoes instead of the condensed soup, and guess what? He loved it! Had it two dinners in a row! You won't be disappointed with this recipe

absolutely delicious. i doubled the amount of sage and added frozen corn and carrots. i later used the leftover chowder to make turkey pot pie.

This was just a starting point for me for a soup made from Thanksgiving leftovers. I simmered the carcass for several hours to get a good broth, so I used that instead of all the milk. To the 4 cups of turkey broth, I added a cup of chicken broth then only 1 cup of half and half. Instead of the canned soup concentrate, I used a cup of leftover mashed potatoes. I used the same amount of onions as the recipe called for, even though my liquid was a lot more. It was plenty. I decreased the bacon to two slices and even found that a bit overwhelming in the finished soup. I also added carrots and celery, since I always want to sneak vegetables into my family whenever possible. My family loved the final results.

I made this dish on a cold winter evening. We enjoyed it very much. I thought it was a good basic chowder, wholesome and smooth. I used smoked chicken instead of turkey, and it went well with the bacon. I also used more sage than is listed, and kept some of the leaves in larger pieces, adding texture and color.

Very tasty soup. I didn't have the cream soup so I used just milk. We also omitted the bacon and added a can of drained corn (and salt & white pepper). Very good. My whole family enjoyed it!

This was good. I used dried sage as I could not find fresh and added some fresh thyme leaves. I also thinned the soup a little with an additional cup of broth.

First, I want to apologize for rating a recipe that I did not follow exactly. I mean, it's really not the same dish, is it? I just want to pass along how GREAT this one is and how flexible! I used all dark meat (well trimmed) and a little less onion. I used 4 medium potatoes and 1 can of Cream of Chicken with Herbs (had it on hand). I also threw in about a cup of leftover mashed potatoes and used regular chicken broth instead of low sodium. I also was able to use up the leftover Half & Half (used instead of whole milk) and I used dried sage. I threw in some leftover Thanksgiving carrots also. THIS SOUP IS GREAT! What a great T-Day leftover recipe!! My only note to myself for next time is use only 1 tblsp. of the grease rather than two. But I still rate it a 4 forker!! My husband does not generally go for cream soups but he had two servings and wanted to know when I could make it again. YUMMY!

I am always a bit dismayed by those who substantially alter a recipe, then attempt to rate it. Tonight, I am one of them. I lacked the can of cream of potato soup, so I substituted extra potato, used half and half in leiu of the milk, and added bay leaf. I thought is was delicious, as did my fiance. This recipe is a delightful variation on a more traditional turkey soup, and a fine way to use up part of all that left-over turkey. We highly recommend this recipe - with variations of your choice!

Rating: 4
Delicious! As other reviewers have noted, a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving ingredients. I used the turkey broth I made from my leftover turkey and added corn. I used a tad more sage than called for because I plucked the leaves from my garden and didn't want to waste them, and 2 percent instead of whole milk. This makes a very thick chowder that will be perfect to heat up on a cold night.

fantastic, was surprised how nice this was. I used the whole can of potato soup (why not?) and also threw in a cup of corn (prev frozen). Otherwise perfect how it is written

I have made this a couple of times. The version today is great using prosciutto instead of bacon, fresh sage from my tiny garden, a can of creamed corn and 2% milk. Also used baby yukon gold potatoes, quartered, with skin left on. I agree with other reviewers that the canned soup is not necessary if using a pureed potatoe or other thickening ingredient but it's no "shame" to cook using what is available in your home and grocery. Cheers!

Yummy! Made my own turkey broth (I make it in the crock pot with the left-over carcass) and also used mashed potatoes (from Yukon gold potatoes) instead of mushroom soup. Added frozen corn. Good use of left over turkey and potatoes.

Follow these steps and i think you will find this to be one of the most delicious soups you have ever had. 1) go to gobblegobble.com and order a smoked turkey to be shipped to you. 2) eat it, but dont forget to save a few cups of meat for the chowder 3) make stock using the bones/carcass 4) proceed with recipe using the smoked turkey meat and stock instead of chicken broth. sooooo good.

This was delicious--I made it with Thanksgiving leftovers and liked it so much I made a second batch using Trader Joe's cooked chicken and then made a vegetarian version (I used leeks rather than onions for that version). It's quick, it's easy, it's delicious! (And to snarky Michaelnova in Sacramento--I think it's no sin to use an ingredient that comes in a can! Check out the Wall St Journal, 12/1/06, for an article about how the great chefs at the top restaurants use things like Gravy Master, catsup, and potato chips in their signature and expensive dishes)

say whuh? cream of potato soup? this is cooking? ok, everyone. i have a wonderful recipe for green bean cassarole. it's ... um... a can of green beans, and um... a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a few potato chips and a little cheddar cheese for a topping.... WONDERFUL! this is cooking? puh.... leez!

This was a good soup and a good way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey. To cut the fat, I used turkey bacon and 1 cup fat free milk and 1 cup fat free half and half instead of whole milk. I also used the entire can of cream of potato soup (didn't want to waste any) and 2 t. dried rubbed sage. Because fat free half and half tends to clump and turn stringy if cooked too long, I added it last and cooked just until heated through. Very tasty.

Decided to try this with the meat from a deli-rotisserie chicken. Other than that, I sautéd a sliced carrot and 1-1/2 ribs of celery prior to adding the onion, added 1/2 tablet of Maggi Picante Spicy Chicken Bouillon, and added some fresh mushroom slices at the very end of cooking (so that they didn't disintegrate). Otherwise I stuck to the basic recipe. It turned out VERY GOOD. In the past I have made this twice with turkey, and I don't remember it tasting any better that way than what I made tonight. DELISH, esp. with a spinach salad and baguette bread.

This was wonderful. I, too, used cream of mushroom soup. I omitted potato and added corn as well as more bacon than called for. Add in a few other spices for more depth of flavor - thyme and bay leaf is great in this. So, yes, I altered it quite a bit, but my husband & I absolutely loved the outcome!

The perfect solution to leftover turkey. I added some canned chipotle peppers for a little kick. Delicious! It didn't last long enough to freeze!

We love a great chowder, and this certainly is one! I followed the recipe rather closely for me, but with a few minor changes. (For those of you who have not yet learned to value the comments from others, perhaps in time you will.) I like the golden potatoes instead of russets for something like this, so I used them. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of potato, and I used the whole can, for goodness sake. Because I like a really thick chowder, I made a roux of 1 tablespoon each of flour and softened butter ... perfect! It's another cold winter night here in Chicago, so I am serving this with cornbread muffins! I'll freeze the rest, as I am confident it will be just right for Super Bowl Sunday!

This chowder went together very quickly using a cooked half turkey breast I picked up at the supermarket. I had most of the remaining ingredients on hand, but had to sub a can of condensed 98% fat free cream of celery soup for the potato soup as that's what was on hand. It came out great and we all loved it! It's my new 'what to do with leftover turkey' go-to!

This is 4 forks for a left over recipe. We used left over Tur-Duc-Ken and added andouille and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of potato and it was delicious. A nice change of flavors from the original meal.

This was a great usage of my Thanksgiving leftovers and other ingredients on-hand. Added a little bit of garlic and sliced celery. Also used 2 percent milk over whole. Other than that, followed the directions provided. I will make this again the next time I have turkey leftovers.

I left out the potato soup. I used leftovers from my smoked turkey. I made stock from the carcass and left over meat in the soup. Now that made it a 5 fork soup!!! I will make it again next year. I served with white cheddar cheese cornbread. OH my, too good!

This is a nice basic recipe that allows lots of room for experimentation. I omitted one piece of bacon and about 1/4 cup of the chicken stock; added a can of creamed corn and a few carrots. The result? A tasty, easy and excellent creamy soup! Yum.

This was a great meal with a salad and glass of wine. Great light flavor (I used leftover roast turkey with a pear glaze from Thanksgiving)and hearty texture. Although, it looked a little beige in comparison to the picture on the website (I forgot to get fresh sage and didn't notice that what looks like chopped red pepper in the picture wasn't on the ingrediant list).This was still a great way to use those turkey leftovers. Next time I'll use the turkey stock that I made instead of chicken brooth.

Incredible. A few extras make it divine: sausage (in addition to the bacon), a can of cream of mushroom (in addition to the potato), sliced crimini mushrooms, and a few cloves of garlic. I made this recipe with my additions for an office party, and it disapppeared in minutes!!

Great chowder recipe. I substituted smoked sausage for the bacon, used 1 can of cream of chicken instead of cream of potato, and added some leftover wild rice. It's a great way to use up leftovers without it tasting exactly like Thanksgiving dinner all over again.

A delicious way to use up leftover turkey. Didn't have any cream of potato soup on hand so substituted a can of cream of chicken soup and added some cooked potato chunks along with a cupful of leftover peas and carrots. My husband also thought it was great.

I have made this twice, and it was a big hit both times. It is being added as a staple to the post-Thanksgiving menu. The second time I made it I was forced to use roasted garlic chicken broth and cream of celery soup, and it still came out great.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to making this chowder. It was okay, but I was expecting much more given the reviews. It was sort of bland, maybe more sage would help. Overall, a disappointment.

Loved this - a great way to use up leftover turkey. I used baby red potatoes, unpeeled, almost all of the can of soup and about 1/2 cup more of both the broth and the milk. Also used about 1 1/2 teaspoons more of the fresh sage. Next time will try some veggies - corn, peas, carrots, etc. Definitely try it!

This was a wonderful recipe!! I made a few changes to it. I used bacon bits as well but also added some celery, corn, half pint heavy whipping cream, a few extra potatoes and the whole can of cream of potato soup. I couldn't find any fresh sage and ground sage worked just as well. Everyone love this chowder!!!

This chowder was incredible!!! I loved it so much that I am making it again tonight with the last of the turkey. It was a big hit at our house. I changed a couple things though...I used Real Bacon bits instead of fresh bacon (to save calories) and red new potatoes (to save time on peeling). I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this with my leftover turkey meat from yesterdays Thanksgiving dinner, and this soup is just delicious! It's a turkey chowder all right! The only thing I did different was to use mashed potatoes instead of condensed cream of potato soup. But I don't think it made much difference. This is a keeper!!
