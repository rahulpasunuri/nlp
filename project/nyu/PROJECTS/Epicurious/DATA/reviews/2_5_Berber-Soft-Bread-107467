So, I decided to make this recipe because I'm moving in five days, I'm on a budget, and I have a ton of flour left but not much else. It was good! I know some people said they didn't like it, but what did they expect? It's basically unleavened bread, and is cheap and easy. It felt really traditional and simple, which I really enjoyed. I made mine a little smaller, kind of like pancakes. I think you can eat them however you want... it might not be the right way, but I would even try this as pita-like sandwich bread. It was great with honey, though - just not too much!

I grew up in the South, so maybe I have a weakness for fried breakfasts, but I thought this was lovely. It's very simple, but it's so easy to make while completing other morning tasks. Taken with honey, it's delicious. Next time I'll try cooking it in less oil than recommended, and I would like to incorporate cinnamon, probably in the honey.

Although the recipe is very easy with very minimal preparation and ingredients, I still found it too much work for an end result being so bland.

This recipe was very disappointing. I made it for breakfast for my husband and I and felt that it wasn't worth the calories. I make homemade tortillas and thought the taste would be similar. We took one bite and threw the rest of the bread away.
