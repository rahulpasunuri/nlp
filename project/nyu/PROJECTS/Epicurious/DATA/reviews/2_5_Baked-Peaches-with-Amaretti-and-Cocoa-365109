I love the idea of this recipe, and the filling was very nice, but skinning peach halves perfectly while raw and pitting them is very fiddly work, not (in my opinion) worth the result. I adapted it to make a kind of peach crisp, with peach slices and the wine in the bottom of a pie pan, and tripling the topping recipe to layer on top of it all. Also, I added some sugar tot he topping-- the cocoa alone was pretty aggressive.
