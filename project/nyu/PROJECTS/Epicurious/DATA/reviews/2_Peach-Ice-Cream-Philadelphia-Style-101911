Tasted very icy. Was impossible to scoop out after frozen and broke into small pieces, not creamy at all. I would have preferred chunkier pieces of peach instead of total puree.

Not a pleasant experience...a fat overload suitable only for Ally McBeal

This ice cream, while tasty, was WAY too fatty -- like eating a stick of butter, literally. It coated the spoon and the inside of my mouth with a very unpleasant layer of tallow, making it impossible to taste anything. The excess fat also made it freeze rock-solid.

I followed this recipe exactly but it didn't turn out well. It was far too rich and had a waxy texture, like frozen sour cream.

The best recipe I have tried. Adjust sugar and vanilla according to variety of peach and ripness. Can also be used with other fruits. I use a Krupps freezer for one quart.
