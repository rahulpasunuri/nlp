I made this recipe verbatim. Ick! It was too dry. I had a bad feeling while I was dumping out the juices that had drained through the colander onto the plate after the assorted berries thawed. There are better crisp recipes available. I prefer the ones with brown sugar, oatmeal and nuts.

everyone loved this dessert. i made it with all blueberries and it turned out great. i used 3/4 cup of brown sugar for the berries instead of 1+1/4 cups. i also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I couldn't find 16 oz. bags of frozen berries so I used 4 12 oz. bags which added strawberries. This was delicious and was eaten with rave reviews from guests.

I think that doubling the amount of topping/filling would make this even better. I live in Anchorage (where Humpy's is located), and their version of this had a LOT more topping. Still delicious, and a great way to use wild berries.

I know that everybody thinks that this had too much sugar. May I remind you that this is a dessert? When was the last time you had a crisp that wasn't extremely sweet??? Loved it! Will DEFINATLY make it again!

I've made this dessert twice now and both times it has received rave reviews from all involved in eating it. The first time I didn't drain the berries and it did end up more of a random (but very delicious!) berry+crust sludge from the liquid the berries put out. The second time things were more recognizable. I did cut the sugar based on other comments here, and it turned out still quite sweet, but not offensively so. I will definitely make this again--it's easy and inexpensive (frozen berries at Trader Joe's are quite the steal) and after the glowing reviews I've had so far, I don't think I'll be allowed to bring any other desserts to various gatherings.

The frozen berries released way too much liquid and the crisp was runny. Tried it with fresh berries and came out much better. Need to reduce the sugar though.

I will agree with all of the other reviewers .... on one hand, it's delcious. On the other hand, after three bites, it seems you have consumed enough sugar for a week! It is way too sweet, even after I cut back the sugar in both the "crisp" and the "berries" mixtures. {Side note: it was good the next morning straight out of the refrigerator and cold with no ice cream or whipped topping.}

Taking the advice of the reviewer before me, I cut the sugar down to about 3/4 cup in the berry mixture and thought it was plenty sweet. The crisp itself didn't hold together as much as I'd hoped (servings looked like a big scoop of hot berries rather than having any real crust involved), but it tasted just fine.

Much too sweet for my taste. You can make a crisp/cobbler without so much sugar, even with frozen berries. May try it again with half the sugar in the berries. I needed a whole glass of water to wash out the sweet taste in my mouth. Crisp was good.

I adore this recipe - it's very easy to make and producse a delicious crisp. I made this for 8 friends and they raved about it: not too sweet, great crumble crust, etc. I was skeptical about buying frozen berries but it turned out well. I made this in the middle of summer and wouldn't bother to substitute fresh berries.
