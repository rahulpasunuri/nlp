I bake all the time and this recipe looks delish. Wrong. Not only was it stupidly time consuming, it just wasn't that good. The brownie is dry and boring, needs some coffee or something. The caramel was like caramel jelly....odd. It wasn't that flavorful either. THe pecans were flat. And the worst part.....they were too difficult to cut and get out of the pan and off the foil. THere are better brownie recipes on epicurious. This looked amazing and just fell totally short. Sorry.

I made this for the first time in August 2009 when the recipe was in the magazine. I took a few pictures of a cut piece and posted on Facebook. The comments were crazy and people raved about the presentation and how tasty it looked. I also brought these brownies to a potluck and everyone raved about them. This last weekend I was talking with a good friend who has eaten a lot of my cooking and baking over the years, and asked him what was the best dessert I've ever made. His answer? These Layered Brownies! His birthday is Saturday and I plan to suprise him with these brownies.

Great recipe and not difficult at all if you're used to working with caramel. One thing: these should absolutely not be tasted when cold, straight from the refrigerator. The flavors need a little time to develop and meld better when room temperature. I do agree with another reviewer - the caramel layer is delicious but almost completely obscured by the ganache. Next time, I'll double the amount of caramel used and drizzle the ganache over the top rather than pouring a complete layer.

A good solid dessert. A friend said it was the best thing she's had. Others were very happy with it but not blown away. I would make this again but I think I would use my usual brownie recipe as the base since I think this one was not as impressive.

Absolutely fabulous...you could substitue a store bought ice cream but the Cocoa Nib Ice Cream is delicious. It is a bit time consuming, but well worth the effort. My husband said it was in his top 5 of desserts!! Will definitely make these again!

I found that the white chocolate caramel middle layer was lost with all the chocolate. I used Felchlin white chocolate, and had to make the caramel twice...I would so prefer if temperatures were given instead of color indications for the caramel, the first one I made had a burnt edge to it. Also I didn't care for the slightly gummy quality the gelatin gave to the caramel. I agree with another reviewer..the picture was so good I wanted to eat it. Unfortunately the finished brownies didn't resemble the picture as much. The top ganache layer was very soft and I'm thinking perhaps I mismeasured the cream? Also, I didn't think I was going to enjoy crunchy nuts on top of brownies, but I found them to be really delicious, a nice contrast of textures.

These layered brownies are fantastic! They take a while to make since you have to let each layer chill/set before adding the next layer but they are well worth it. The only problem with the recipe is that the chocolate is measured in oz. Not a problem for me but has been for other people I have given the recipe to.

Wow! These are some amazingly good brownies! Everyone loved them, even those who don't typically want nuts in/on their brownies.

Were these brownies worth two days of cooking including the ice cream? Personally, not for me. I thought they were too sweet. But they were a hit at the party to which I brought them. I cut them into 16ths instead of 8ths because I couldn't imagine eating a whole 8th of the pan. Sugar overload.

These were amazing. I couldn't find pecans so I substituted walnuts and they worked out just fine. It's true, this is definitely for people with a high-tolerance for chocolate - it's intense, but worth it. I cut them into smaller pieces and brought them into work and one of my co-workers told me he would run someone over for one of the brownies...high praise!

I want to eat the picture, so I can only guess what the real thing will taste like.

OMG. Delicious. But intense and for super chocolate lovers only. Don't forget to toast the pecans because doing so gives the whole dessert a deep, smoky flavor. So good I need a cigarette after eating one.

Just fabulous. Don't skip the candied pecan step--they add a great crunch to the otherwise fudgy dessert. I wanted a thicker bar, so I made 1 1/2 recipe of the bottom and middle layers in the 8-inch pan. Only one recipe of the ganache needed. Served with mocha rum gelato. Dinner party raves.
