Another note, as a time saver, I shaped the patties with cheese the day before and stored in the fridge until the day of the event. Then I put them on a baking sheet, under broiler in the oven, thus having hot burgers all at once for my guests.

Did this over a year ago for a kid's party. Used the extra Worcestershire sauce, and also Hawaiian Sweet Rolls (Costco). The sweetness of the rolls worked well with the saltiness of the burger and Cheese. The kids ate it no problem, and the parents liked it too. A keeper for parties or get togethers and perfect size for children.

In Minneapolis, we call this a Juicy Lucy, though we don't have any place that serves it in slider form yet--as far as I know. If you like cheeseburgers, this is definitely the way to go!! No more of this on top of the burger stuff. Just be careful w/ that first bite... Molten cheese is dangerous on the tongue.

I'm not the worlds most patient chef and this was so simple and quick to make! I added Worcestershire Sauce to give the meat some extra seasoning and it turned out delicious! It was fun to eat as well!

This is a great quick meal or cocktail hour meal. I added 3 different types of cheese so that my guests could have variety and it was a hit. Also we made some crispy onions to top it off. Everyone loved them. Easy and good! Perfect summer food!
