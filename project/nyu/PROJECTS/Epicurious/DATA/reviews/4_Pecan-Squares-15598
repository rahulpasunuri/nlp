Everybody I make these for asks for the recipe. I make the topping exactly according to the recipe but use the "Shortbread base" from this website for the bottom. I love that I have a pecan pie bar recipe that does not call for corn syrup.

I found this recipe very easy to follow, although I do agree that the squares turned out a little hard to cut. I found it was better to break them into pieces rather than cut them. However, I will definately try them again, perhaps next time with the alterations. I still give it a thumbs up!

My attempt at these squares still came out tough and dry despite making the suggested changes (less honey, less cooking of caramel). My husband thought they were good but I won't be making them again.

I like this recipe, with modifications. First, I reduced the honey by 1/4 cup. Second, I reduced the caramel cooking time by 7 minutes. Then I noticed that the caramel/pecan layer really began to harden as it coolel so I drizzled 2 tbls. of light corn syrup over the top. It kept the layer chewy and delicious. The crust is great. Using high quality butter improved the crust flavor as well.

Oh my gosh these are soooo good. They were gone within 10 minutes of me putting them out. The only thing I might change next time is add less honey since the end product really tasted of honey and not caramel. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind in the leaset bit but I think if I only put a 1/2 cup honey it will be better. I also shortened the caramel cooking time. I found these hard to cut (spray with pam) because there were so many nuts so I used a utensil that I use to cut dough with and that worked great.

This definitely is a keeper. I made it for my house guests and everyone asks for a recipe. It tastes so good and is easy to make. Like the previous reviewer, I have found that reducing the caramel cooking time is a must if you want the pecan squares to be chewy. I also have to reduce the baking time, perhaps my oven is too hot.

These are great. I make them all time at home for my family. However, I hgave never been able to get them to come out of the pan neatly in squares. Maybe spraying the pan with non stick spray would help (I've made these sevral time but always seem to forget). Most importantly, I have found that reducing the caraml cooking time is a must since the full time called for in the recipe produce a caramel, once hardened, that is too candy like, and not chewy enough. Otherwise, I see myself continuing to make these for years. Don't take my three forks too seriously. It would have been a four- but I'm a perfectionist.

Since pecans are plentiful in Georgia, I am always looking for new recipes to use them. This one is great. Easy to make and easy to take. I make these squares often for the folks at the office and always for family get togethers. YUMMY!

Okay, okay, okay. I did not make the pecan squares. But, I did buy some at the bakery in Searsport, Maine, during a recent vacation. THEY ARE PHENOMENALLY GOOD. (So are many other of the bakery's products.) I am going to bake them at home now, since Searsport, Maine is a 12-hour trip from my house!!!
