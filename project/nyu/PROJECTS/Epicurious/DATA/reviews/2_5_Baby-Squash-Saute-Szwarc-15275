instead of the vermouth, sautee the zuchinni and squash with soy sauce, brown them a little first, then cover and let them cook through, throw in the soy sauce for a minute at the end and its soooo good

Not so exciting with baby yellow squash- even with vermouth and chervil it's too bland. Zucchini might be better.

Had no baby squash so sliced small yellow ones ,a nice change from my usual squash recipes.

great fresh presentation of zucchini during the winter. Easy to make, but should be served immediately.

substitute for vermouth for those who don't like either the taste or to cook with spirits? I use either chicken, vegetable or beef stock, depending on the recipe.
