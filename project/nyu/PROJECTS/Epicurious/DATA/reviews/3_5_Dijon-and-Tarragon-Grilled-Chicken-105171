Very good! This chicken has a lot of flavor.

Loved this marinade. Wonderful flavor. Only change to the recipe was to use combination of fresh and dried tarragon. The amount of marinade is perfect for a package of 6 chicken thighs. Instead of grilling, I baked the chicken, with the marinade in the oven which really made the chicken flavorable. The sauce was wonderful served with chicken. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite grilled chicken recipes. I use just chicken breast and marinade the chicken overnight. While grilling I baste the chicken with the left over marinade that I heat up first.

Great chicken for the grill, next time I am going to double the marinade serving size

Great easy summer recipe that allows me to enjoy time with guests. Works very well on boneless skinless breasts too.

This marinade was delightful on chicken thighs I baked in the oven. I served it with lemon garlic collards, sliced cucumber/tomato salad, and brown with wild rice.

Made this tonight for my husband and I. He thought it was very good, I thought it was ok. The 3 fork rating is from my husband. Would make it again for me, but not for myself.

Great marinade with chicken and pork! I probably use it more with pork than chicken. It keeps well in the freezer, because you don't need to use very much.

We love this recipe. Have used it time and again, and will continue to do so again. It's fresh, easy and comes out beautifully every time.

Loved the marinade!!! I used it to roast a whole chicken rather than grill the parts and it came out fantastic. Only thing I'll do differently next time is save a little bit of the marinade to pour over the meat after it is carved.

We love tarragon, but found that it can be overpowering if using the full 1/3 cup. We reduced it by half and found it delightful.

My wife does not usually like dishes with mustard, but she liked this one. Personally, I'd make up extra marinade to be able to keep basting during grilling for extra flavor and juiciness.

Rating: 3
Very very good! I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could. I was glad I doubled the recipe as others suggested. However, I only used about 2 Tbs of tarragon - while my husband loves tarragon, too much "lawn" in a dish is not appealing to him. It tasted great even without all the tarragon it called for.

A very good bbq chicken recipe with just enough of a twist that it stands out. I have to disagree with the suggestions this isn't for you if you don't like tarragon - I'm not mad about it myself but didn't find it overpowering at all. It's important to up the marinade and not overcook the exterior of the chicken.

I LOVE this recipe! It is now one of my summer signature dishes.. I first made in June of 2001.. and make it a couple of times every summer. Also... left overs are great too!

Doubled the sauce for 5-6 legs. Cook slowly to prevent burning. Lovely flavor. Couldn't stop eating. Yum! Do you think it would work well with pork?

Rating: 3
Just made this for dinner this evening and we both thought it was delicious. I love tarragon, so unlike some other reviewers, the amount didn't turn me off. I cooked about 6 chicken legs, so the amount of marinade was perfect, but for two chickens, I'd make more. I can see myself making this again and again throughout the summer.

A definite keeper! Must use fresh tarragon and I doubled all other ingredients. Made great grilled chicken wings!

Absolutely scrumptious. Tarragon is in a class by itself, of course. I had a friend for dinner and she said it was by far, the most delicious chicken recipe she had ever eaten. I'm preparing it again tonight. My secret is to use only breasts, tenderize into cutlets or butterfly. Grilling time is reduced and the flavor of the dijon, honey and tarragon makes the chicken just delectable.

I'd never cooked with Tarragon before making this...and I never will again. Maybe it's just my personal preference but I really dislike the flavor of this particular spice. If you do like Tarragon then disregard this review.

Don't marinate just cook VERY low and turn every five minutes basting. This is fantastic and easy.

I made this pretty much as written - I chopped up half a small shallot in the food processor with the rest of the marinade ingredients. Used bone-in thighs, which took about 30 minutes to grill (fyi). It wasn't bad, it just didn't do much for me. There was a pronounced tarragon flavor. I'm not a huge tarragon fan but I have nothing against it - I think I just prefer sharper flavors. If you like tarragon, try it, you will probably like it.

I used 4 chicken breasts, doubled the quantity of wine and added some salt before grilling. Delicious and simple to make. I got great feedback from the tasters. I had extra sauce since I used less chicken than the recipe called for and I thought the amount was perfect. So if you do use the right amount of chicken, you should double on the sauce.

Rating: 3
This dish was DELISH! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and substituted 1 TLB dried Tarragon for the fresh. I also grilled it in my cast iron grill pan and it came out great! I let it marinate overnight and it was so flavorful and juicy. Next time I think I'll add minced garlic to the marinade.

I made this to accompany the Lentil Salad with Tomatoes and Chevre and it was great. I didn't have any fresh tarragon, so I used herbes de Provence and it was wonderful. I used a mix of whole grain mustard and dijon, and also used boneless chicken breasts. Very, very tasty, especially cold the next day for lunch.

Tried this recipe two years ago to RAVE reviews, it's now a staple in our summer cooking list. Have to use excess sauce to baste and cannot overcook. Perfect with white wine spritzers and corn on the cob!!!! Definately a keeper~ We use chicken breasts instead of whole chickens.

Used the broiler. Came moist, juicy, and flavorful, but despite the 1/3 cup of fresh tarragon (right from the garden), it couldn't be detected. Still, if you have good quality fresh chicken, this will be good.

Tarragon & Chardonnay are a classic pairing and this dish is a wonderful way to enjoy it. I grilled using hardwood charcoal direct until browned and indirect to finish. 30 minutes in all, basting as called for in the recipe.

This chicken was succulent. I marinated it for 4 hours and then I roasted it in the marinade instead of grilling it. It was very moist and flavorful. Roast it at 375-400 degrees for about 30-40 minutes depending on your oven. Be sure to turn the chicken so both sides get brown. Then spoon the sauce over the chicken when you serve. Fantastic! We served it with a Puillly-Fuisee.

This was very good but I agree with others that the marinating didn't add much flavor. The basting did, but we had a tough time keeping the skin from burning even at the lowest temperature. We tried indirect cooking but it was taking forever. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks and couldn't find fresh tarragon so I used dried. I basted every ten minutes and the end result was still very good and tasty. I followed another cooks suggestion and boiled the marinade to use as a sauce over the cooked chicken, but I didn't care for it(too strong tasting as a sauce). I liked the taste of the marinade so I'll make again...just have to figure out how to avoid burning the skin. Maybe I'll try the oven instead of the grill.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I made it using only chicken breast. I had leftovers so I made sandwiches on grilled rolls with provlone cheese and and a little honey dijon mayonaise and some watercress. It was even better the next day.

I love this recipe, I'm so glad we have enough tarragon in our garden to keep this a regular on our menu! I love the tarragon and mustard and wine, it's divine. A great way to grille. Oh, and I just throw everything into a ziplock bag and let it marinate that way. Less cleanup! Once again, thanks, Epi. I love this site!

When I rated this recipe I was shocked to see only 79% would make it again; thought it would have been much higher. When we made it, did not have any fresh tarragon, so we used dried tarragon (aprrox half of what is called for in the receipe). Maybe this is the diffrence?

I had never cooked with tarragon before this dish. Now its one of my favorite herbs. Very tasty.

I liked this dish & I followed the advice of 1 of the cooks here by baking it in the oven at 350°, since I don't have a grill (thanks for posting that!). I used 3, skinless, bone-in breasts, which were slightly dry. Next time, I'll double the marinade so we'll have more delicious sauce to top them with. I also added a few pats of butter toward the end of cooking time & turned the oven up to broil to brown them for 5 mins. I've never used fresh tarragon however & I wasn't thrilled with it. It can get a bit bitter when it's cooked, as some people here have mentioned. I couldn't help thinking that dried tarragon might have tasted better. Next time, I'll use it. I also added 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the marinade because, after all, no recipe is complete without it! :-)

I found this recipe a bit strong on the tarragon, which I'm not used to using. Not too subtle at all. I baked it in the oven; perhaps it would be better grilled. It confirms I'm not too fond of tarragon.

It was delicious. Very easy to make, but it seems like you slaved over it! Be careful - if you burn the tarragon it will taste like licorice.

When the grill refused to light, I put the chicken and marinade in a non-stick pan, covered it and baked it in 300 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. Excellent - also the marinate and juice from the chicken is great over rice or pasta.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. My only change is that I add more fresh tarragon and don't chop some of it so fine. I always make sure to have enough for leftover wraps.

this recipe was wonderful! i noted the extreme reviews and and cut back the tarragon to 3 tablespoons of dried. a sudden thunderstorm hit and we opted for a sautee pan over the grill. i threw all the marinade in the pan and then added some stock at the end to extend the sauce - my guests were raving dispite the rain... also great w/ shrimp!

Very nice recipe. I substitued lemon juice for the wine and I think it enhanced the tarragon. I seered the chicken at the start and at the finish to add some crispiness, but cooed it indierstlt. Burned tarragon is not appealing!

We don't cook with tarragon very much. Either we did something wrong or it just didn't turn out the way we expected. I have to admit it tasted like black licorice chicken!

I had high hopes for this recipe, esp. given the reviews, but unfortunately, we were not impressed. I marinated the chicken pieces for 7 hours and basted basted basted during grilling, but found the taste to be far too subtle. It was actually quite bland.

Very simple and easy to make. I also used skinless/bonesless chicken breast and marinated overnight. I boiled the extra marinade and served it over the grilled chicken. It was delicious served over sauteed spinach!

I made it for a dinner party and was asked for the recipe a few times. We cooked it on the grill and basted it with the marinade alot. I think it's important that it is basted as frequently as you can, especially if you have a husband or wife who is willing to be out in the rain doing it.

I really enjoyed this recicpe. I thought that the combination of flavors were just right and the tarragon was perfectly matched with the chicken. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. It was very moist. Definetly a keeper in my book.

I used 8 chicken boneless breast pieces and was pleased with the results. The recipe was certainly easy to prepare. The marinade taste wasn't very strong, but my husband thought it allowed the taste of the chicken to come through better.

Not impressed. The marinade flavor barely came through. The chicken turned out moist because I only cooked it about 15 minutes. With the 37 minutes as suggested it would have ended up leather.

This marinade is fabulous not only on chicken, but on scallops and salmon on the grill as well! I don't usually care for tarragon because it tends to be overpowering, but this was just the right amount, and the frequent basting of the chicken gave it a wondeful glaze outside while keeping it moist inside. I have now made the marinade and am keeping it in reserve in the fridge for anytime I want to apply it! (And I have also planted tarragon in my garden!)
