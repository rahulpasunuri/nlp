This recipe is scrumptious. I didn't grill it though I just baked it and its one of my favorites. What a great combo of flavors. If you haven't tried it you should.

This was delicious. I used a mild green olive - Lucques which went perfectly. I used leg and thighs and grilled them on rather low for probably 40 min which was perfect. It would also be spectacular for spit roasted whole chicken.

A similar trick is to separate the skin from the meat on thighs and put a slice of citrus, orange or lemon with a whole sprig of rosemary between the meat and skin. Grill or bake. Remove the skin and toss the rosemary and citrus. Delicious!

Chopped all of the olives, rosemary and garlic w orange peel in processor. Then divided for stuffing and dressing. Roasted b/c didn't have any wood charcoal. We both loved it; will definitely grill to finish next time.

Made this and everyone loved it. I had bone in breasts, so I baked it first then finished it off on the grill. Guests demanded all leftovers and I got messages about how the chicken was used. Very moist and tender.

This was spectacular! I used olives when I stuffed the chicken and capers in the dressing. Everyone loved it! It was also really easy to "do ahead" and with company.

Good but not spectacular. I felt like the olive was a bit overpowering overall. I ended up adding more orange juice to get a bit more sweetness to the dressing.

I made this last night and the flavor is exceptional. I had skinless bonless breasts so just cut a pocket in them for the stuffing. This will be a great dish for entertaining
