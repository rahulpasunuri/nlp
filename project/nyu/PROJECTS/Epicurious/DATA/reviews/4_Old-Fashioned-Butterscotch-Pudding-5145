Of course this recipe is delicious. It has six egg yolks and two cups of cream! Best to serve it to your skinny friends! Delicious though lots of dirty dishes.

I adore this recipe and I've made is successfully at least five times before. Takes concentration but it was always perfect. But today it has curdled every time!!! I am on batch #3 and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong!!! Any suggestions? I'm totally at a loss...

This is wonderful stuff, although I agree with other reviews in that it didn't taste like butterscotch, more like a delightful creme caramel. I made it exactly as recipe was written. Served chilled with whipped cream. Got rave reviews. One person said it reminded him of the taste of a perfectly toasted marshmallow. It is labor intensive, but well worth it. Will be making it again this weekend!

Delicious for all the reasons previously stated. However, lots of time, effort and dirty dishes! It won't become part of our regular dessert rotation.

This was delicious but did not turn out like any butterscotch pudding I've ever had. The texture was amazingly smooth and silky - very rich. We will definitely make this one again.

This is fantastic! I aggree with the other reviewer that it tastes like creme brulee. It's worth the time and effort.

Loved this. I hate it when people do this, but I made a few changes. Didn't have time to let it cool before cooking, so I went directly from pot to ramekins. Baked them in a hot water bath for 35 minutes, then let cool for 15 minutes before refrigerating them. Ate them 4 hours later. Luscious. Didn't do the straining, either. More like a creme brulee consistency, but that may be because I might not have baked them long enough. Definitely would make again.

This was sooooooooooooo good! It tasted like creme brulee with the burnt sugar in the pudding instead of on top. I made a pecan crust and used this as a filling for a pie. It was good but the crust was almost a distraction from the intensity of the pudding. Next time I'll serve it plain.

This was just astonishingly tasty. I almost never give four forks for a recipe, but this deserves them.

This has no real resemblance to butterscotch pudding as I know it--more like a creme caramel. We loved it. The texture suffered a bit from not doing all the chilling required in the recipe, but it was still extra-yummy!

The richness of this pudding screamed for it to be made into a pie. Use a 9 inch unbaked shell. Cook at 425 for 20 mins, then 325 for another 40. It will be an addition to Thanksgiving dessert.
