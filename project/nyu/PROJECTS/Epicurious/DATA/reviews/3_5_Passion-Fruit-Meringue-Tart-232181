I too, upped the passion fruit puree and cut down on the sugar. Since we watch our weight, I tried leaving out the butter, and it is delicious! I'm sure the butter is good, but just can't afford all those calories. Guests love it. I make just the curd and serve it in ramekins topped with blackberries macerated with a little sweetened puree. Relatively healthy and wonderful! I have made it many times, always to raves.

I give this a 3.5 forks for flavor. This was my first tart so it was a lot of work. I used mango puree instead since this was a test run and I didn't want to waste passion fruit if it was a flop. Well, I must say flavor was good, a little overwhelmed by all the buttery taste but still delicious. The crust turned out ok, I guess! It was very buttery and flaky. It felt more like a cookie but combined with the curd tasted very good. Now the issues: When I cut a piece of the tart it crumble before I could transfer it to a plate. The curd has a "baby food" texture. Could anyone help and let me know what I am suppsed to look for, is the curd supposed to be more like a pudding/custard? what did I do wrong with the crust to be so falky that it crumbles when cuting it? I want to try the passion fruit version but need help with those issues.

I used A Cook from Chicago's modifications and thought this was fantastic. Omitted salt and cornstarch; it set up fine once refrigerated. Actually you can make this a lot easier on yourself by blending everything in a food processor for a few seconds, then cooking until thick and about 170 degrees. Turn off heat, add butter, and strain into a bowl. Easy peasy...

This could be fantastic, but I strongly suggest a couple of changes. When I made the curd the first time, it was too sweet and it did not have enough passion-fruit flavor. On my second attempt, I increased the amount of passion-fruit puree by slightly more than 1/3 cup to just over 1 cup. I also slightly decreased the sugar . . . just by a couple of tablespoons. These changes made all of the difference and the result was a fantastic tart. I also went for a more attractive look and used a star pastry tip to add the meringue to the tart, then added some toasted, unsweetened coconut before using the torch on the meringue.

Quite a bit of work, but worth the effort. It was delicious and the passion fruit makes it very unique. I thought there was a bit too much meringue on top though. Should do this again!

Truly fabulous! Worth hunting down the passion fruit (parcha maracuya) in a Spanish market.
