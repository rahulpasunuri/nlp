The turkey was 15 lbs. of perfection - following most of the recipe the bird came out looking as fabulous as the photo in this recipe and was moist and delicious. The only difference was instead of stuffing the bird with the Herbed bread stuffing it was stuffed with quartered lemon, onion and sage, rosemary and thyme. Added carrots, celery and more onion in the roasting pan. Baked the Herbed bread stuffing separately and included the ingredients listed on the main recipe page in addition to those listed on the separate recipe for the stuffing - that is key. Used fresh herbs in the stuffing, it was moist in the middle and nice and brown around the bottom, edges and top. BIG HIT. Lastly, the gravy was delicious - the longer you cook the roux the more brown the gravy. Family loved it - would do this again in a heartbeat.

To pslev8. I know that Kosher turkeys are moister than others, which may be why they used a kosher turkey. If you don't use a kosher turkey, you can soak it in brine. This is a good recipe for thanksgiving.

Nice recipe, but there's something really ironic about pouring butter all over a kosher turkey...if you are a kosher cook, butter and turkey wouldn't be on the same menu! Olive oil also works nicely and gives a nice even brown color to the skin.

I've made this three Thanksgivings in a row (we have Thanksgiving in October), and it's been great every time. It is a beautiful bird, and the gravy is wonderful -- not a big deal to make the broth while the turkey is roasting, and it adds a lot of flavor (though there is never enough gravy for any leftovers). I don't bother heating the roux -- just whisk the flour and fat together, and add that whisking in a stream to the juices + broth. Still thickens a bit (I don't like my gravy too thick), and makes life a lot easier. I do the stuffing separately, but I stuff the bird with carrots, celery, quartered lemons, thyme and rosemary. I also put carrots, onions, celery, thyme and rosemary in the base of the pan to add more flavor to the pan juices. Looking forward to next Thanksgiving!

The best turkey I ever made. Tender, moist and golden brown.

I only made the stuffing part of this recipe. The taste was very traditional stuffing, but I found it very wet. If only making the stuffing, i would probably cut the stock in half and use less butter too. Aside from the wetness (I cooked it a long time to crisp it up), the flavour was really very nice. Not exceptional, but good.

I like a traditional stuffing and this one fills the bill. I did add some mushrooms (for the moisture) and some hazel nuts (for some crunchiness). The turkey looked beautiful coming out of the oven and the reduced cooking time (or at least reduced from the recommended amount on the turkey wrapper) resulted in a moist, very tasty bird.

The turkey turned out very nice and the stuffing was good but not fantastic. I used all fresh herbs, more than doubling the quantity, but I still felt it needed more flavour. I also had trouble with the gravy. It's hard to skim off a quarter cup of the fat to use for the roux so my roux was quite dry, then when I added the stock in a quick stream, the gravy didn't thicken at all. Next time I might try a butter/flour roux, and usually when I make gravy I gradually add the hot stock so that it thickens.

Just a great traditional recipe - but please help me with the gravy! Maybe I'm a newbie, but when I mix the fat and the flour over low heat, it just turns into a gelatinous glob - what am I doing wrong????

This is not really a review, but a comment about using a kosher turkey. While succulent and flavorful, as it's already been 'brined', give yourself extra time to perform electrolysis on the bird. You'll need to pluck the pinfeathers with a needle-nosed pliers -- they will definitely be there.

This was fine, an easy, classic turkey preparation. I think the high-low temperature plan works well. I cook the bird without aluminum foil, but draped with cheesecloth dipped in the melted butter, removing cheesecloth for last 30 minutes. This gives a wonderful golden skin, with appetizing color and texture but not too crackling.

I wanted to go easy on Thanksgiving this year as I'm 9 months pregnant - this recipe was the answer! Very straight-forward, but sooo delicious! It yields a ton of stuffing (I usually run out) and the gravy was very tasty using the giblet stock. A classic Thanksgiving recipe!

My first Thanksgiving from scratch...with great results. I cheated and did the bird in an oven bag, but aside from that followed the recipe. The stuffing is great as is, but I am going to play with it next time. The fimily was impressed, which is the true measure...

Commenting on the gravy: great gravy recipe, and much easier to work with than others I've seen. A big hit at our Thanksgiving.
