Simple, quick, and the sauce has great flavor. I didn't know that you couldn't get champagne grapes this time of year so substituted Muscat. There bigger so I simmered the sauce a little longer. Also, I'm not sure why you need to dust the fish with flour. Simple sauteeing would require less oil and the fish is so delicate the flour almost detracts from the outcome.
