I made this tonight after tasting it at my daughter's home. She had modified the recipe. I followed the recipe, except that I had too little cucumber so added cantalope to make up the volume. I served it with lime flavored tortilla chips, but will buy shrimp to grill for next time. The flavors melded beautifully! I like the measurements ... 2 teaspoons of minced jalapeno is much better than telling me to use 1/2 of a jalapeno since they vary in size.

This is so refreshing and a great way to utilize leftover watermelon. We had with grilled burgers and was wonderful!

It is wonderful with salmon. It does not keep well. Use it all . Everyone loved it..

Fast, easy, and delicious. Had it with grilled chicken and again with burgers. Tried to save some for lunch, but it didn't store well...better to make right before serving.

Great hit with company. Double the amount, everyone was looking for more, and I didn't have any more!
