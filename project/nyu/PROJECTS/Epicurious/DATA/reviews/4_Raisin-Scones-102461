I had never made this recipe before, but I was experimenting with coconut oil (substituted for butter) and trying to use up some leftover heavy cream. I also ran out of all purpose flour, so I used one cup of wheat pastry flour. What a FANTASTIC scone!! Flakey and just sweet enough;-) I also only cooked them for 15 minutes... maybe the coconut oil cooked faster?? But perfect!

I JUST LOVE THESE. I ate 3 as soon as they were out of the oven and my husband ate 2. My husband is Belgian and has NEVER eaten a scone. He told me to rate this 4 stars. Definitely a keeper. I did notice my scones were done before 20 mins; done at 15 mins.

Great and easy recipe, used 2% milk since we didn't have any cream on hand. Scones turn out really nice and flaky, not dry at all. We will use this recipe again for sure!

I am a scone lover and have been making this recipe for at least 6 years. I substitute the raisins for fresh blueberries and usually leave out the lemon because it's never something I have on hand. It is the best recipe I have tried and I always get rave reviews. The crumb is light and tender and just sweet enough. For those reviewers who said it was a bit dry, they have have been over mixing the dough. You only want to mix until the ingredients are just combined that drop on the pan. Delicious!

I have tried many scone recipes...this one was great..you will get your hands doughy.. and I will use it again..the scone is light flaky and biscuit like with a soft pillowy center...I soaked my raisins to rehydrate them before baking.

I have made several scone recipes from this site and this one has it all. It's now my go-to scone recipe. Use it as a base and customize it however you like- in my case I add hazelnuts and dried cranberries.

Perfect! Good texture, good taste. This is now my go-to scone recipe. It's less work to divide dough into two chunks, roll each into a 3/4" circle, then cut into pie-like wedges. My first batch burned, so start watching them early. (We don't like raisins so I substituted chopped dried pear with a little minced crystallized ginger.)

I made these the first time years ago for a christmas tea i was hosting. I took a big chance by making something new, but the recipe sounded good. They turned out so great and are my go to scone recipe now. Sometimes I leave out the raisins, and sometimes I make a lemon glaze for them. They are always recieved well and people who are used to dry hard scones become converts.

An excellent scone recipe! I usually end up substituting milk for the cream and they're still fabulous. Instead of raisins, dried cherries and white chocolate transform these scones to perfection.

I have made several times now. Did not use whipping cream, I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 2% Balkan style yogurt and is delicious. Also made a few times with dried cranberries rather than raisins. Loved by guests and family.

The texture of the scones were good, but the "aftertaste" was a bit dry (if that makes any sense). But if you plan on using preserves or clotted cream, they're great.

I totally went a different way with this one since I didn't have lemon peel, or the flour it called for and used blueberry instead of raisin. I used a box of cake mix, plus about a half cup of regular cake flour, and about a half a cup of self rising flour...also just a tad bit of almond extract and fresh blueberries instead of raisins. Turned out to me more of a cake (surprise), but tasted wonderful and had an awsome little "crisp" of a crust on the top. Will half to get some flour and make it the right way.

This is by far the best scone recipe I've tried, and I've tested many on this site. Be sure not to overwork the dough and you will be rewarded with the lightest yet rich tasting scone ever.

Excellent light scones. I use golden raisins only and never omit or leave out grated lemon peel. Lemon is critical for the "these are fantastic" response.

I never really got into scones until recently because store bought ones are usually like sawdust. These are just the right texture and so easy to make that I can whip up a batch in no time. My husband enjoys them with his strawberry jelly and nods his approval at every bite. I also drop them onto the pan to bake, even less time consuming.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always wonderful. Try candied ginger, dried cherries, or dried cranberries for something different. Tasty!

Fabulous scone recipe! Light and delicately sweet! I used dried currants in place of the raisins but otherwise made no changes. The recipe is easy and quick with results that would seem much more complicated. Delicious w/ preserves and clotted cream. Clotted Cream or Devonshire Cream can usually be found at Cost Plus World Market stores, or if you happen to live in Oregon, at Zupans markets. If neither of these is an option, here is a home made recipe I tried today and found quite yummy: Whip 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream until starts to thicken. Add 1 rounded Tbsp. sour cream and sifted powdered sugar to taste. Continue to whip until thick and stiff peaks form. Enjoy, my guests sure did!

Very good and not too difficult to make. Just the right texture.

These scones were absolutely perfect in texture and taste. Instead of lemon, I used the grated rind of one whole orange. The perfumy orange essence with the raisins were an excellent combination. I had previously given up making scones because they were always dry and hard, but I will definitely make these again. I think the whipping cream is the secret!

These scones are perfect! I also didn't bother rolling the dough out, but just formed lumps on the baking sheet, saved time and clean up.

These scones were delicious and a breeze to make. I left out the vanilla because I forgot and I didn't add the zest b/c I don't like zest and they were great!! My dough was very sticky though and hard to roll. I just scooped up the dough into mounds and baked. I have made this recipe with chocolate chips and also with Craisins and they were great. I am going to try to substitute whole milk for cream for a lighter, less expensive version.

Rating: 3
These are excellent! I halved the recipe since I was just making them for me and my mom. I didn't bother to roll it out and cut them into circles-- I just pressed the dough out into a 3/4" high disk, put it on some parchment paper on a cookie sheet and baked for 20 minutes. Cut into wedges for serving. Perfect and delicious!

I've made scones before, but nothing ever like this. They were a hit! I cut back the lemon peel to 1/2 tablespoon, which seemed just right. I boiled water and plumped the raisens for about 5 minutes. I'll be making these again soon

First time making scones. Very easy to make and very flakey. I, also, soaked the raisins and used the Kitchen-Aid mixer (shaving the cold butter). Do not over mix, you will lose the flakiness. I quartered the batter and made 3/4" rounds of each quarter and cut into 6 triangles. Baked the same amount of time. They were perfect! Made a basket for a friend with clotted cream and Stonewall strawberry jam. Made a very nice hostess gift.

I had to come back to re-rate this scone. My first attempt was okay, but the second one turned out really great. The difference was using the Kitchenaid if you have it- turns out such a lighter, fluffy, and yummy scone. Amazing!

Rating: 4
Wow. I used to have a friend who made the "best" scones. Wrong! These are far better. Made two batches last night to give away for Christmas. Soaked the raisins for the first batch...excellent. Used craisins in the second and they were a bit dry but still had good flavor. I decreased the lemon just slightly and that worked well too. Drizzled a bit of confectioner icing on top after they cooled. Everyone loved them!

Rating: 3
Definitely delicious! My husband is a scone connoisseur, and he kept coming back for more. Very moist. I soaked the raisins per reviewer's suggestion, nice touch. Forgot to buy a lemon, so used 2/3 tbsp dried lemon peel, so scones weren't as lemony as other reviewers commented. These are more true to the British scones, as they're not as sweet as those in U.S. coffee shops. Couldn't find clotted cream, but did find British double cream & traditional strawberry preserves. Scones are great on their own and sublime with these toppings!

Rating: 3
Great recipe, but I agree the lemon is very strong. I made those a second time without lemon and I thought they were much better this way. At first I was also afraid because the dough was very sticky, but the scones turn out great, and you can even eat them without any topping.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I made it for an afternoon tea and everyone loved it. The recipe yielded more than 24 scones for me. They were tender and subtly sweet - excellent with clotted cream and preserves. One note: all ovens vary, so be sure to check on your scones at about the 10 minute mark (you should be doing this anyway to rotate your pan). Mine were getting close to being a perfect golden brown. I took the scones out at about 13 minutes and they were perfect. Also, the recipe doesn't specify it, but it always helps to soak your raisins in water (and drain them, of course) before using them. It greatly improves their texture.

Rating: 3
Very yummy scones... careful, the lemon rind is a nice touch, but potent, especially if you use a real lemon. I'd still use it, though. These were great with strawberry jam!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent scone recipe - the best I have ever tasted. Don't try to use milk instead of the whipping cream or they will turn out dry (I tried that and threw the batch out). Also, the golden raisens are key - make sure you don't substitutue all regular raisens.

I have gotten rave reviews about these scones. I have made them with golden and regular raisins, and then with blueberries and cranraisins. I brush the top with the egg mixture and sprinkle raw sugar on top. Everyone LOVES them. Thank you.

These are delicious - I used currants in place of raisins and the results were terrific. For the Australian cook - 1 stick of butter is the equivalent of 113 grams (a stick is the form in which butter is sold in the US).

These are the best scones. My 3 year old son loves them so much that I have to keep them frozen in the freezer to serve up. I bake up a big batch and they will keep for at least a month (if my son does not finish them off sooner). Twenty seconds in the microwave, and they taste freshly baked. I wanted to comment on Racine, WA's comment about the 2% milk. I think the 3rd egg is necessary if you decide to go with 2% milk. I was out of cream once and I used 2% milk with only 2 eggs, and the results were a disaster. The scone batter was too moist, and I had to add extra flour just to make it come together. The scones were leaden. I'll never make these again without cream.

These scones are not only excellent but easy. I mixed the dry ingredients with the butter in my food processor, then stirred in the wet. Even my kids enjoyed them. Not too sweet, not too dry,just perfect.

Wow. Yum. Moist, light and fluffy, just as advertised, not too sweet and not too bland. My new favorite scones recipe! I'm too lazy/busy to roll out and cut individual scones, so just heaped in 2 rounds on the bake sheet and scored into wedges--easy to cut off individually after they're baked, and the leftover scones don't dry out as quickly...

I thought these were very good. I used cranberries rather than raisins and I added a touch more cream to help the dough come together, but they were easy, relatively fast and very light and moist when done.

This recipe is a winner. I made a mistake by not reading the recipe closely enough and used all three eggs in recipe. I also did not have any cream so I used 2% milk instead. The scones were still excellent. For the topper, instead of the egg wash, brush tops liberally with cold water and cover with as much granulated white sugar as they will hold. I got a pretty, white crunchy sugar crust.

Absolutely the best raisin scones I've ever tasted! I served them to a friend who was trained as a chef in France and he said they were the greatest..moist and flavorful. I used all regular raisins, not golden.I'll make these again for sure.

This recipe was given to me over the phone by the Bon Bonerie in Cinti, Ohio. I was shocked they would not only share a fabulous scone recipe with me, but give me their source. I made them for the first time and although they did not raise as much and look as pretty as the ones in Cinti, they were still delicious. I put in baking soda vice b.powerder by mistake and wonder if that is why they did not raise as much. I can't wait to share them with my friends in the a.m.

I made this for a reception at church, and it got rave reviews, even though I messed up the recipe! I mistakingly added all three eggs, and had to incorporate more flour to make it workable. The lemons were from my own tree and that made it even more special. I can't wait to try again and make it the right way!!

This is good. I mucked with the recipe a little bit, adding spices (clove, cinnamon, allspice) a cup of chopped apples and baking soda instead of baking powder (I had been plagued by bitter scones with other recipes until I gave up and now use baking soda instead). The raw batter was SO good that by the time I had the scones in the oven I no longer had any interest in the baked results. However, I sampled them dutifully and can report that they are indeed good, even if they do not live up to the promise of the raw batter. Since most of you will be eating the cooked version, you will not be troubled by this.

These were very moist, not dry. I added blueberries instead of raisins. I also will add more sugar next time because for me they weren't quite sweet enough. I have grown accustomed to Starbuck's scones. I didn't roll them out, but just scooped a handful of dough, made a ball out of it, and then patted it down on the cookie sheet. Like one previous reviewer suggested, these bake better when they're smaller since my larger ones became too crispy on the outer edges before the insides cooked through.

These were so good. Why drive across town when I can make them in my own kitchen. They were moist and tasty. Next time I'll make the scones a little smaller...like the recipe calls for...Betcha can't eat just one!

Looked at all of the recipes for scones, and this one sounded like the most flavorful and moist. I HATE dry scones. Made this for a group of friends, and everyone raved. They lived up to all of the other reviews that I read. Used all golden raisins, and served them with a homemade lemon curd(which I also got from this website.) It was pure decadence, and I will make them again soon. By the way, I didn't cut them out, but divided the dough into two balls, rolled them out, and cut them into wedges like a pizza. Much quicker, and no need to gather the excess dough that occurs when you cut them out a biscuit cutter.

Terrific! The batter was fragrant and a pleasure to make. I added a bit of extra lemon zest, and used all currents rather than the raisin combination, and the result was divine. A terrific introduction to scone making for beginners, or just a delicious variation for experts.

These were not the best scones I have made. Lemon adds nice flavor. Note to future bakers of this recipe: Try to bake them same morning as serving them- they lose their freshness quickly.

Fantastic scones - I've only had better ones at Stonehenge and that may have been because they were so nice and warm and we were so wet and cold! I was out of regular raisins but had a 6 oz package of golden raisins and cherries. They were just right. I took the leftovers to work two days after baking and had two requests for recipes. Now any idea where I can get good clotted cream in Columbus??
