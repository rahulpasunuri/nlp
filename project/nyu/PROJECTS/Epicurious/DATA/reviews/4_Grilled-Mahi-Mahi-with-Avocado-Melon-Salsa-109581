I've made this recipe quite a few times. The combination of the Jamaican jerk seasoning and the cool avocado melon salsa is outstanding. If you or your guests want to tone down the heat, make your own combo of jerk seasoning with less cayenne. Last night I used a red snapper filet, seared the seasoned flesh-side in a hot skillet for about 2 minutes, then put it on a foil covered baking sheet, skin-side down and roasted at 425-degrees for 12 minutes. I tried a fruit salsa that my local seafood shop prepares - in addition to the ingredients here, they add mango and red bell pepper. Very good!

Tasty, easy, healthy and impressive enough for casual guest dinner.

I just loved the combination of the avocado and sweet melon with the onion and cilantro. The seasoning on the fish was perfect. Loved this very easy entree.

I fix this a few times every summer for my family, but I always use mango instead of cantaloupe. I usually don't worry about the lime peel, and I use Blackened Redfish Magic and cook the mahi mahi in a pan with olive oil. The jamaican jerk is way too hot for our tastes. My children love this recipe.

Delicious! Used yellowtail, couldn't find mahi mahi.

The salsa is an absolute must to tame the spicy heat of the jerk seasoning. The combination was awesome. I followed the recipe and used cantaloupe rather than substituting mango as others have suggested. It was worth the extra trip to the store to find cantaloupe. The texture and flavor work so well with the avocado. This recipe is a keeper - and special enough for a dinner party.

This was an easy recipe, everyone enjoyed it. But there weren't raves - something I need for four forks. This could be my fault in that I didn't follow the recipe completely. Instead of dredging the fish in the seasoning -I just sprinkled the seasoning on. Then 1/2 cup red onion in the salsa was too strong. (old onion?) So next time I will put the seasoning on stronger, and taste as I add the onion. It was good enough that there will be a next time!

Mahi-mahi was the perfect fish for this -- firm and steak-like, and it doesn't fall apart on the grill. I knew that would be good, but the salsa was the real surprise: you wouldn't think that canteloupe with onion and avocado would work, but somehow they do. I'd recommend getting high-quality jerk seasoning or making your own, though: the stuff I found in the supermarket was waaaaay too salty.

I lucked out when I went to the grocery, and got yellowfin for the price of Mahi Mahi, since they were all out (small town living has it's perks). Everything went together really well, and the only thing I would change is the lime juice. I felt three tablespoons was a little too much, and took away from the other flavors. Otherwise, this was a very delicious recipe, and such a great way to welcome summer.

I used mango and added more than 1 cup - also a bit of honey to sweeten it up a bit. I didn't realize how "hot" the jerk seasoning was and loaded the fish (fresh flounder) with it, which made the dish VERY spicy. However, the fish was very tender, and was quite delicious. I might warm up the salsa next time, but I'll definitely make it again. Nice presentation - would serve to guests that like spice.

Love it! I made my own Jamaican jerk seasoning. Fantastic!

We substituted Redfish (Red Drum) on the half-shell and it was excellent. We also reduced the amount of jerk seasoning by 1/2 and it had plenty of spice and flavor.

Try it with swordfish and you won't be disappointed. I've also used mango in place of the melon.

This dish is excellent. Usually, I just pan sear the mahi mahi rather than grill it and it is just as good. Fast, easy and delicious.

A taste of summer! A friend gave us mahi-mahi he caught in Mexico. I used mango instead of melon, and the salsa needed no salt or pepper. I served it a with coconut ginger rice mix.

I used Walkerswood jerk sauce and it had a wonderful full flavor. I quickly seared the fish in the wok and then baked in the oven for 15 minutes, but I should note my fish was thicker than what's noted in the recipe so your time could be shorter. I served it with avocado and mandarin oranges and it was a fantastic dish with wonderful contrasts. Highly recommended!

This is a perfect summer recipe if you like the contrast of the spicy jerk with the cool salsa. I have actually used this salsa with other recipes now, and it has become a favorite in my home and with guests!

Super quick and easy, I used pineapple instead of melon because the latter seemed like it would be bland-- it turned out awesome. Served over Israeli couscous.

I made this the first time for family and cut corners... used Costco's Mango Salsa and added avocado & used cajun seasoning and cooked in a frying pan - it was outstanding. I then made it for company and followed the recipe exactly and hated it. The salsa was tasteless. I'll make it again my way - the mango salsa was so much better than the recipe salsa.

I and my partner both LOVED this recipe. He doesn't usually care for fish, but thoroughly enjoyed this. Although it was just for the two of us I chose to make the full recipe of the salsa - it was the perfect amount because we just couldn't get enough! I served it on good quality rice with some grilled asparagus.

We just love this dish. I have made it a 1/2 a dozen times in the past 3 months. The leftover salsa (if you have any)is great the next day for a little Mom snack.

I made this on a grill pan, which wasn't as good as an actual grill. I also used Walkerswood jamaican jerk paste instead of dried seasoning as it has a lot more depth, and doubled the amount of lime zest in the salsa. It waseasy enough to cook for dinner for 12, and a big hit as well.

My husband and I both disliked the salsa. He loves mahi-mahi but didn't like this.

Loved the Hot-Spicy and cool fruit combo. Tons of flavor. Lose or go light on the salt. It hurts the dish. I didn't have lime juice .. used apple juice instead. Citrus would be better. A definite winner.

Made without substitution. Did not like it. The salsa did nothing for me. The fish was just sort of uninspired. To each their own.

This was a great dish and very easy to make. I used ahi tuna steaks because I couldn't get the mahi mahi. The salsa definitly made the recipe. I think it could be used on a variety of dishes.

This was a wonderful and an easy recipe. I have substituted mango and nectarines for the melon and it worked well too. I am making it for company this weekend.

The avocado-melon salsa was delicious. There were four of us for dinner and we all liked it. I like cilantro so thought it was perfect. My daughter would make it again, but with less cilantro. (I bought the Jamacian Jerk seasoning and used it on chicken instead of fish. It was good)

I made with halibut steaks, as it's in season. I think it could work with any firmer fish. I omitted the lime peel from the recipe as I thought the citrus flavor was strong just from the juice. Very very good!

like most salsa recipes, vary the proportions to your taste. this is a great one! the orange melon, green avocado and cilantro and purple onion look great together.

Great recipe. I had to substitute Grouper for the Mahi=Mahi but it was a wonderful company-worthy dinner. I served it with Coriander Rice and Grilled Vegetable Skewers from the same issue.
