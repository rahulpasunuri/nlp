This was the worst. After 3 people tried it and spit it out, I threw the whole batch out. I am sorry I purchased the paste the recipe asked for.

I have to agree with many of the other reviews: this recipe has very little flavor. But the chips are attractive and have a pleasant crunch, so they'll still be good with guac or salsa. Next time I'm going to try a few more spices to see if I can jack up the taste a bit.

I will start by saying that we do not eat anything with chili peppers. This recipe is excellent. I used a recipe for Red Achiote Paste that does not include peppers. Rather than brushing the tortillas with the mixture before cutting, I cut the tortillas and combined them and the rest of the ingredients into a zip lock bag and shook everything together before baking them. They are tasty, not hot, and were an excellent accompaniment to the Potato Stew recipe on this site.

I actually love this recipe idea, but as written it's pretty blah. Hard to taste the lime with that much oil, for one thing. Next time around, I increased the proportion of lime juice and substituted cumin for the achiote paste -- turned out great. I agree with other reviewers that the recipe generates enough for at least twice the number of chips suggested. And definitely cut the chips into strips (or wedges -- I used the smaller tortillas) before the oiling process!

I didn't think these were very good. I did not taste the lime at all even though I used the quantity indicated.

These were a hit at my supper club Mexican Night dinner. I omitted the anchiato paste due to serving other spicy dishes. Would definately make these again.

I entertained with a Mexican appetizer theme and these were wonderful. Such an interesting flavor to the chips sooooo much better than anything store bought. This did impress my guests. I felt the mixture made enough for many more triangles than stated.

These were great! I couldn't find the achiote paste so I substituted Larry Forgione's Adobo Sauce from American Spoon Foods and it was delicious.

Excellent and SO easy - goes great with "charred tomatillo gaucamole" in this database. If you can't find achiote paste...buy some annatto seeds, grind them in food grinder, put through a sieve, grind again; then mix with just a little water to make a paste. Next time I made add a little more salt.

I made these to serve with the Chipotle Salsa (in Epicurious database) and together they were a big hit. These chips are good on their own. I also recommend you cut them with a pizza cutter BEFORE putting them on the cookie sheet. Also, I could not find achiote paste so substitued chili powder - it tasted fine and added a little extra kick.

I would use a pizza cutter if I did this again. More triangles fit on the cookie sheet if you cut them first and then transfer them to the sheet. Very good but a bit time consuming.

Easy to make (except that you can't just run out and buy achiote paste in my neighborhood), and a wonderfully fresh taste. Works well with fresh salsas.
