My family all enjoyed this. I made the recipe as written, but think there is room to improve. I would try cutting the sugar and water down so it caramelizes more and then watching carefully while it cooks so it doesn't burn. The creme fraiche sauce is terrific. Consider layering apricots and creme sauce and apricots with thin slices of angel food cake in martini glass.

Good flavors all around, but the sauce is SO SWEET! The apricots I used were pretty tart, but even so, the sauce was overpowering. Like I said, the flavors were good, though...I'd use less sugar if I made it again. Or, this could make a really good base for a cobbler...something to balance out the sweetness. The creme fraiche was awesome. I would make it again, but with changes.

I made a half-recipe of this with peaches and it was WAY too sweet. Maybe it helps to make with apricots since they're a little tarter, though. I think the best thing about this is the honey-vanilla topping (I used plain Greek yogurt) -- in the future, I'd prefer to serve it over grilled or roasted peaches without any additional sugar.

Wow this was so good. Easy and quick to make. Perfect for a last minute dessert. Will impress both family and company. Served with vanilla ice cream. This is definitely a keeper!

THis recipe is easy and really good. I expected the apricots to be sweet, but they had a pretty good tartness to them. Don't skip the creme fraiche- it complements the apricots perfectly. There will be leftover juices in the baking dish- DO NOT toss them! Serve the apricots in bowl with the juices or save the juices and use them as a topping for ice cream. They're amazing!!
