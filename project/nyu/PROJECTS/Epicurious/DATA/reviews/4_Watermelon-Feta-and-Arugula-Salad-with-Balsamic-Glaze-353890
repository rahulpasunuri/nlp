This wasn't a bad salad by any means, but my expectations must have been way too high. I didn't know watermelon and feta was a "thing" until noticing a half-dozen or so recipes here on epi. So, I tried this one, and it hit somewhere in the middle for me. I wasn't blown away by the textural variances, or the combo of sweet/tangy/peppery. I'm glad to have tried it, but probably won't reach for it again. I really was expecting to be impressed with this unique combination, but was just "meh'd" by it instead.

Very good, light but flavorful, very summery. I used salad mix, honey-goat cheese crumbled, and sprinkled over a few chopped mint leaves. I also seasoned lightly with salt and pepper, but I wasn't using a salty cheese like feta. I made the balsamic glaze - a half cup medium quality balsamic with a pinch of sugar simmered down to about 3 Tbs.

I served this with grilled salmon and mango salsa last night for guests. I made the glaze earlier in the day and it "solidified" by the time I needed it, but I stirred in a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar and it was fine. I also added some shredded basil as per one reviewer. My guests loved it and went back for thirds!

Simple and easy. I added a little fresh basil and a single heirloom tomato (I was making it for 2, so reduced the quantities). Made this on recommendation from friends, and they were right. It's really good.

Used strawberries and the honey-infused goat cheese from Trader Joes. Oh my! This is delicious. Lunches just got a whole lot healthier and tasty.

This got rave reviews from my dinner guests. So simple to make. My balsamic took 8 or 9 minutes to reduce, and was delicious. I drizzled a little olive oil over everything also.

Delicious, so easy to make. I just added a little olive oil on top of the arugula. Great refreshing salad!

This recipe is awesome. I made it today (after watermelon season) with pretty flavorless fruit. The balsamic and feta made this bland watermelon taste great. I got rave reviews on this salad and can't wait to make it for a summer party next year.

This salad is a winner - the combination of flavours is great! I made the balsamic glaze and watched it like a hawk before it could turn into a sticky mess (after making it I can see how this could be a problem) - it worked out fine. I added Kalamata olives which went really well with the other ingredients.

I made this in a smaller quantity as a light lunch for myself and it was delicious. I drizzled a small amount of aged balsamic rather than making the glaze and thought it was great.

I had this at a Clark Lewis in Portland OR. They took a center round of a baby melon. Cut around the rind and cut it in small pieces, but left it in the rind (looked like you were getting a whole uncut slice). Then topped with feta, mint,and sliced kalamata olives. Refreshing summer salad.

Absolutely fantastic! Have taken to several events with rave reviews. I make the glaze myself and use seedless watermelon. Could make it simpler by purchasing prepared watermelon cubes.

This dish was delicious. I used just a little thinly sliced red onion as well. Refreshing and perfect for a summer's evening. Will make again and often.

A simple, wonderful recipe. My husband, who doesn't particularly like watermelon, raved over the combination of flavors. Can't wait to serve it at a party.

Made this today- very very refreshing. I added some thinly sliced vidalia onion, but I also think red onion would do nicely as well. When making the balsamic glaze watch it toward the end.. burned it the first time because I got distracted. My husband ate it without the feta and thought is wat very good. a littel sea salt and pepper helped as well. I think you could also do goat cheese for a lovely presentation and flavor as well.

Absolutely wonderful! Served at a dinner party and everyone loved it. The bitterness of the arugula and feta mixed perfectly with the sweetness of the watermelon. I ran out to Whole Foods today for more Balsamic glaze so I could have the leftovers for lunch. Easy, beautiful, and delicious

Loved this combination, and it is SO easy. Followed other suggestions and made my own balsamic glaze. Yum!

I'm sad summer is coming to an end, because if you get a sweet juicy watermelon from the local market and add it to the arugula, feta cheese and vinegar glaze, it makes for a great lunch salad! By precutting all the ingredients, it was easy to assemble before running out the door. A must for the summer season! For fall, maybe substitute mellon for pineapple and figs with a fig glaze!

The key to this recipe is definitely the freshness of the ingredients. I was worried the balsamic glaze wouldn't be enough to dress the salad, but it was perfect and the spicy arugula sweet watermelon and sour feta all joined together perfectly. Super easy and super delicious. I'm so glad I made this before the summer was over. I can't wait to make this again.

Rating: 4
Totally delicious. Perfect just the way the recipe states. I agree that the glaze should be added when you are about to serve. I was lucky to get very peppery arugula which added to the dish. Brought it to a BBQ and everyone loved it. Def a repeat.

This salad was extremely easy and a great refreshing salad for a summer BBQ. Overall I'd say it was a hit, but not everyone was a fan of the arugula, so next time I would just use mixed greens. I also think pine nuts would be a nice addition next time.

Delicious! I drizzled a little too much of the glaze over the watermelon, stick with the 2 Tablespoon portion. The tangy-sweetness of the glaze goes perfect with the refreshing-sweetness of the watermelon. Definitely gonna make again.

This is just about the best thing I've tasted in recent memory, and it is incredibly easy to make. Would not change a thing about it, and making the balsamic glaze yourself is easy, as well. My husband said "it tastes like summer".

Very tasty and refreshing! I used mixed greens and a fig balsamic vinagrette. Next time I am going to use a pomegranite balsamic glaze which Whole Foods carries as I have run out of the fig. Can't wait!

Looove this salad and have made it three times geared toward 4 people. I've opted to make my own glaze per the ingredient tip and have used store brand balsamic vinegar with great results. The only difference is that since the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons, I boiled 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar until reduce to 2 tablespoons - its hard to store a tablespoon of glaze and why waste 1/4 cup of vinegar? I have had no problem with consistency - maybe because I am not using expensive vinegar. I added some fresh chopped mint to the last salad - and I think I liked it better - either way it's great.

Wonderful! Hard to tell it's watermelon when it's all done. I did this for the 4th of July and everyone raved about it. Making it again to have with bbq ribs and sausages.

this is fantastic. this will be a go-to dish for me when hosting large parties because the prep is so minimal. my teenage nephew was able to throw it together during the party when the first batch ran out. the balsamic glaze is somewhat expensive, but totally worth having in your pantry.

This was wonderful! I used Fig infused balsamic vinegar with a bit of regular balsamic and reduced it. My husband and I both just looked at each other like, "wow, who would have thought this would work?'. Great summer salad!

I LOVED this salad. So delicious - a HUGE hit! I was skeptical that so few ingredients would meld into a wonderful flavor combo - but they totally did! As for the glaze - if you over-reduce it, just add in a teaspoon of water or 2 until it's the consistency that you like. Or if it thickens too much because it cooled down - just warm it in the microwave a few seconds at a time until it's pourable. Can't mess this one up!

Served with Buffalo Shrimp on the 4th of July. I was able to find the balsamic glaze at my local Target store!! There could not be an easier, more delicious salad to prepare!!

so easy, delicious and sophisticated--I made it on Friday night and decided to make it again Saturday since I had everything on-hand already. I made my own balsamic glaze and had to re-heat it in the oven to make it pourable but if that's the hardest thing about this recipe then I'm not complaining

A great summer time salad. Served with southern fried chicken. Big hit.

Fantastic, took it to a potluck and everyone raved about it, my local grocer was sold out of arugula so I used watercress instead. Next time arugula. Didn't have time to make a reduction but found balsamic glace at the store and it was perfect.

This was super easy and quick to make, but it didn't wow me at all. The picky kids didn't like it, but the adults cleaned their plates. Given the rave reviews, I must have done something wrong although I followed the recipe to the letter. If I made it again, I'd probably do it without the balsamic glaze -- the reduction from balsamic vinegar came out very gluey.

Agree with the other reviews that this is an absolutely fantastic and easy summer salad. I mixed the balsamic glaze (made per the easy directions) with the greens and then topped with the watermelon and feta around a mound of blueberries in the middle. Made for a picture-perfect July 4th dish. People were afraid to mess up the presentation, but were sure glad they did. Definitely a winner!

More detailed directions on the balsamic glaze would be helpful. I followed the directions and mine also turned into a hard candy substance. Disappointing, as some of the reviews were so good, I was looking forward to this one! Interesting combo - would be willing to try again.

Great salad! Wonderful flavors -- used creamy feta,next time will use the more salty feta -- but it was still wonderful. Also took the suggestion to add a little fresh mint. No problem reducing the balsamic vinegar. Perfect summertime salad. Is definitely a keeper.

This salad was okay but nothing special. Made it for 6 and no one particularly loved it. I like the way the arugula and feta tasted together but the watermelon just didn't seem to meld with the other flavors. Also, reducing 3/4 c. balsamic vinegar into 3 T turned it into a hard candy rather than a glaze. I'd just go down to 6 T.
