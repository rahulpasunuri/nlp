Made this last night. Easy enough, just need to make sure you time scallops as close to finishing the sabayon, otherwise its a luke-warm dish. Family enjoyed something a little different.

After reading reviews, I was skeptical but my husband heard roasted garlic and said go fo it. This was one of three entrees planned for a buffet on NYE for 18. It was wonderful and everyone loved it. The sauce was delicate enough to not overpower the scallops. I did make a few changes.....I added an extra head of roasted garlic and more lemon juice. As to the greens, I wilted the arugula and added spinich so it was an entree not salad. I had sabayon left and used for a mild white fish.....Delicious!

It was ok. Like others wrote, needs salt and pepper with the Sabayon. Still flavoring was not special. Not sure if I will make again.

Tried this last night and it worked a lot better than I expected. I have just learned to work with the type of make-shift double boiler used in this recipe, but the sauce turned out beautifully. Regarding some of the previous negative reviews...I took the introduction to the dish at face value when it said the disc had a "delicate" flavor and didn't expect much flavor. I was disappointed at first taste of the finished sauce, but kept tweaking the salt and pepper. That was the way to go as the addition of a little more of both REAL highlighted the flavor combo of the sauce. This one's a keeper.

this was the best scallop recipe i have used. i did this for a 12top dinner menu. and they loved it i did use alot of extra garlic, tarragon, chives and parsley. it was exceptional. i also dressed the arugula with salt, pepper and alittle olive oil. i would definately make this again.

My husband loves this dish enough that he will often decide to make it himself since I don't want to put forth the effort on the sabayon. However, I have to admit that it always delicious.

The roasted-garlic sabayon presented itself with a gorgeous, smooth flavor. This made for a delightful surprise dinner for a dear scallop-lover. I, however, had only a brief adoration of scallops in my youth; nonetheless, this certainly is one of my more enjoyable encounters with scallops. Did I mention the superb sabayon?

I am usually pretty good at adjusting a dish to make it better, but this dish was so bland that I couldn't add enough herbs or vermouth to save it. My guests weren't thrilled with it either. It also had a metallic taste. I will not make it again.

I made this for a Sunday appetizer while the main dish was cooking...I also used spinach for the base...everybody really liked and will make again soon

I made this dish the other night & it was absolutely delicious. I didn't have a large metal bowl, so I just put the Sabayon directly over the heat & watched it very carefully. Turned out great. I also used spinach instead of arugala & it was fine. I would serve this again in a heartbeat.

Noting the comments that the dish was bland, I doubled the garlic, lemon and splashed some extra vermouth. It was still too bland. I think the problem is that scallops have little flavor as it is, so the sauce needs to be outstanding. This sauce was OK, but somehow not quite there. Also, I substituted spring mix instead of arugula -- I didn't think this sauce worked well on the greens.

Great sauce - sauce is a keeper

We loved the sabayon sauce, and would recommend it for any seafood. Since I also love seared scallops this is a keeper for us.

It's a shame the lowest mark you can give is a one. This was a total waste of scallops - had no taste whatsoever.

We have made this dish three times. It is better with more lemon, tarragon and vermouth. Perfect lunch salad.

Try Wild Alaskan caught scallops from the Kodiak area. They tend to be larger, firmer, and low in mercury and other "undesirables." Alaskan Halibut cheeks are also a really good cheaper alternative. I doubled the garlic and herbs and thought it was a recipe worth repeating.

Not great, but very easy; however would not make again. The arugula needs a base coating of dressing on it, not just dollops of the sauce.

Tastes great, and is very easy to prepare. We like it with double the lemon juice...

I love scallops and I try new recipes for scallops often. I found this recipe to be good, but not exciting and not worth repeating.

Thought this recipe was ok, not great. Sauce seemed a little bland in the end, not nearly as "garlicy" as I expected. Nothing really wrong just not that interesting. I think there are better sauces for scallops out there.

I served this as a first course on Valentine's Day. It created an elegant presentation and received rave reviews. I would not change a thing about this recipe.

This was wonderful. We decided it would make a great first course also. Didn't do the Arugula made Coucous with toasted pine nuts. What a treat!

I have made this recipe twice, and had rave reviews. The roasted garlic sabayon is wonderful and very easy to do.
