For something so simple to prepare this recipe really delivers a lot of flavor. I made it with fresh arugula and heirloom tomatoes from the farmer's market. It was an absolutely delicious weeknight meal.

Well - here's what I think....I can't believe that no one has rated this recipe since last time....I love it....I did everything the same - except I used cod steaks - was fabulous!

I am a huge fan of this recipe! It meets all my requirements - healthy and fresh food that is quick to make, attractive on the plate, flavourful and can be cooked in small portions for one (or if I'm lucky - two!) It took more time to wash the blender and pan than to find and prepare this recipe. I did use lots of substitutions - yogurt instead of mayo, a lemon vinegarette instead of the lemon juice, and the baby greens salad mix instead of the specific greens called for in the recipe. The result was fantastic and I am looking forward to treating myself tomorrow night with the second leftover cod fillet!
