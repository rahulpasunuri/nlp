Phenomenal! My family loved it, I shared the recipe with my mom and sister. This is something my husband said he would request regularly!

Delicious! I wrapped the prosciutto the whole way around as suggested by reviewers. Also, the Braised lentil recipe makes way more than six servings! More like 10!!

Really good, easy, tasty & healthy! I've made this several times. I add more sauce - last night used fresh tomatoes from our garden & some fresh basil. Didn't have fontina or mozzarella, but did have some shredded monterrey jack which I put on top. I usually double the prosciutto since I buy very thin strips. Next time will actually wrap the chicken per some suggestions. I add chile pequin flakes to both chicken & lentils for a little zing - and might try Spanish smoked paprika too. This recipe can be played with, according to personal taste & ingredients on hand. It's a real keeper.

Wow, this dish was spectacular. But really, how can you go wrong with prosciutto wrapped chicken? The sauce was so delicious I was tempted to lick my plate. The spinach was a nice pop of color in the lentils, but I'm not sure if I'd include it next time.

The meat was flavorful and tender and the sauce was very good. Everyone cleaned the plates!

Excellent recipe. Followed others' suggestions and added some more zing to the sauce with some crushed garlic and Spanish hot paprika (pimenton de la vega, for that subtle smokiness). Next time I will use an entire can of diced tomatoes (just used 1/2). Also subbed mozzarella for the fontina. The lentils are great with it.

Made this tonight and it was very good. Followed recipe except for sub of mozzarella for fontina and already had lentils from last night's dinner. It was not difficult and a change of pace.

Not as flavorful as I'd hoped. Don't know why. The lentils were more interesting.

What an easy, yet well developed, flavourful dish. I made a few changes, based on what I had available to me: Lentile Vert for brown lentils, Braesole for proscuitto, Doux de Montagne for Fontina. They're all close enough that I feel safe in reviewing the recipe as written. I only cooked Two breasts with 1 cup of lentils and the full sauce recipe, and more sauce wouldn't have been unwelcome! As previously mentioned, the chicken stays nice and moist, and the lentil bed makes for a delicious, if rustic looking dish. Add some garlic to the mix, maybe some red pepper/chili flakes and I think it would be Four forks.

This was delicious and not difficult. I made it and put it aside for about one hour (baby was not ready to go to sleep) and it was still great. It was fun to assemble. Looking forward to leftovers!

Very good! I didn't change anything but had to use bacon instead of prosciutto (didn't have any). Italian flavors through and through.

4 forks for the chicken, but my husband really didn't like the combination of the chicken and lentils. Personally, I really enjoyed it, but he thought they didn't go well together. However, the chicken is fantastic. I used homemade chunky tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes and wrapped the chicken breasts in prosciutto, rather than using just one slice, as we really love prosciutto.

really good and simple! didn't use the prociutto since they didn't have it at my grocery store, but it still came out perfect. would perhaps add some garlic next time, but thats it!

This is a very good chicken dish. I doubled the sauce so that there was plenty. I found that when you put a dollop of sauce on the slices of fontina, that it just slides off during baking. I put the sauce on top after it comes out of the oven and sprinkle with the parmesan. I didn`t make the lentils, but served it instead with risotto. Delicious!

This is an awesome dish. Always gets rave reviews. I like to use fire-roasted tomatoes and finish with a drizzle of good truffle oil.

I never thought I'd say it, but it taste's like a restaurant! AWESOME! A must try! Juicy chicken breasts with the texture of the cheese. I've made it for my boyfriend twice and my sister and brother in law and they thought I bought it at a fine restaurant. A must try! AND EASY! You can do it in less than 40 minutes. No brain surgery required.

This looks impressive on the plate - and it's easy. It's delicious as is, but we prefer spicier food at my house, so I like to marinate the chicken first in some olive oil, garlic, red & black pepper & Italian herbs and jazz up the tomatoes a little with the same flavors. Yum.

This recipe is exceptional. I used all olive oil and provolone cheese. Still tasted great.

I add a pinch of red pepper flakes for the heat this dish needs. I also add a little chopped fresh oregano and instead of lentils I serve the chicken with a side of spagetti.

An OUSTANDING dish. I make this dish often. I do not change anything in the receipe, get all kinds of raves for this wonderful chicken dish.

Was looking for a recipe to use some prosciutto and stumbled on this one. It was really easy and tasted great. It will be a weekday staple for my family. It is elegant enough for company too. I substituted mozzarella for the fontina and it was fine. This one is a definite keeper!

I've made the chicken dish twice -- both times I followed the recipe closely, and both times the chicken was fantastic! For my "healthy friends" I cooked the lentil dish, which was a big hit. For my "not-so- adventursome" mother, I served a plain rice dish with the chicken, which went well too. This is my new, favorite chicken recipe.

This is wonderful -- seemed too simple to be as deeply flavorful as it is. I doubled the spinach in the lentils and it was perfect. I didn't tinker with anything else.

Restaurant quality if served with the lentils, the chicken would be good by itself but ascends to new flavor heights when combined with the lentils. I prepared the chicken in an iron skillet. I used fresh tomatoes and made the whole sauce recipe for two chicken breasts. I cooked some leftover lentils with leftover spinach for 30 minutes; I used the vegetables and seasonings prescribed and added lots of pepper. They were plesantly spicy and flavorful. Flanked with steamed broccoli and the lentils, the tomato sauced chicken looked beautiful on the plate. This is a keeper. Hubby loved it.

I cooked this recipe (sans lentils) for a friend's birthday and it was a big hit. I thought it was a great recipe, and although it is slightly time consuming it is not very difficult. Definitely will make it again sometime.

This is a dish I've made a couple of times when I want to do something that is sure to please guests (and make me look like a pro). This garners praise everytime and is pretty simple once you get all the ingredients. If you're not into spending the time on cooking raw lentils, I have substituted good canned lentils heated with butter, sauted onions, salt and pepper, some of the chicken stock from the recipe and stirred in fresh spinach about two minutes before serving.

excellent dish....but i'm puzzled...i found this under the world cup treats section for Croatia....why would you choose a dish from Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen with Italian Prosciutto, Italian tomaotes and Italian Fontina cheese? what about some Croatian dishes such as raznjici, cevapcici, burek or lignje?

Phenomenal. I was surprised at the depth of flavor from such simple ingredients. I used Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes. This has become a staple in our house, and one that our two preschool children especially love.

I didn't find this recipe time-consuming at all. Had it ready in just over 45 minutes. Loved the chicken; not sure I'd bother with the lentils again, though.

Fabulous dish. Proscuitto almost not needed (but a fine addition if easy to obtain). Will make again and again. The lentil dish accompaniment is perfect.

This was so good! A little time-consuming but well worth it! The lentils go great with the sauce. The mild fontina cheese goes well with the lentils too.

After cruising Epicurious for something to make with chicken for New Year's Day, I found this recipe. It was easier to make that I thought and the results were fantastic. The chicken and accompanying sauce was tender and moist and the braised lentils were a fantastic bouns (a dish I would make as a vegetarian main course with a couple of small changes). Excellent!

Rating: 3
Simple, tasty, yet elegant dinner, have made it twice. I buy 4 chicken breasts instead of 6 and the amount of sauce is just right this way. I love it with the lentils -- I used the French green lentils which hold their shape well -- and while subtle rather than spicy, the combination is great. Chicken turns out moist even after the time in the oven.

Very tasty....I doubled the receipt for the sauce and added two cloves of garlic and some fresh basil.

The sauce with the chicken was quite nice and the chicken was just fine. The lentils and spinach were pretty bland and unimpressive, however. I'll make this again, but with a different side dish.

I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE TWICE NOW WITH GREAT REVIEWS. I ALSO HAPPEN TO LOVE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING LIDIA COOKS. VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD CHEF. ALWAYS LETS THE INGREDIENTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I USUALLY ONLY USE RECIPES AS IDEAS, HOWEVER THIS ONE I FOLLOWED AND INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SAUCE JUST A LITTLE, USING BY EYE A LITTLE MORE WINE, STOCK,AND TOMATO. I DIDNT SERVER OVER THE LENTILS. I PREFERRED A VERY SIMPLE POTATOE GRATIN. SIMPLE LAYER THE SLICED POTATOES, THREE TIMES, EACH TIME SEASONING WITH SALT AND PEPPER, AND A TOUCH OF FRESH GARLIC. ADD HALF AND HALF TO THE TOP, DOT WITH BUTTER, LITTLE BREAD CRUMB. PUT A FRESH ROSEMARY SPRIG ON TOP AND BAKE FOR 375 UNTIL THE CREAM IS REDUCED AND A KNIFE GOES IN EASILY. YOU COULD ALWAYS ADD MORE LIQUID IF THE POTATOES ARE STILL HARD. THIS WORKS GREAT WITH THE CHICKEN DISH AND WINS EVERYTIME I MAKE IT. EVERYONE WILL BE WOWED.

This was a delicious recipe, pretty easy, good combination with the lentils, and I didn't change anything at all (as I usually do). ... I don't get why this is only 67% rated but...it was nice.

I found this recipe while looking for something easy and tasty on the occasion of my daughter bringing her boyfriend home to "meet the parents". It was yummy, and very well received. Not too much fuss, and very pleasing in all respects. I'll definitely make it again.

I LOVED it. Very easy. There were NO leftovers. I tripled the amount of sauce ingredients it asked for (wine, tomatoes, etc.) to get enough to go over pasta. Was told it is my "best chicken ever".

This recipe was very similar to chicken cordon bleu without the fuss and effort of stuffing the chicken breasts. It is easy and quick enough for a weeknight dinner. I did make a few modifications. I doubled the sauce ingredients and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a handful of chopped fresh basil to add some extra flavor. I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used a whole Jersey tomato so my sauce was chunky but good. Will make again

I chose to make this dish --the chicken and the lentils -- while searching for more chicken recipes to add to my general family repertoire. The recipe is fairly easy to make, took about 40 minutes prep & cook, seems nutritious, yet surprisingly did not deliver on flavor. I made the recipe exactly as described, right down to the Parmigiano-Reggiano, and was expecting more of a flavor punch, given the ingredients. Sorry, but I'll try other new chicken recipes and stick to my old standby's instead of making this one again.

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. I actually left out the procutto for dietary reasons and it was great. The lentil side dish was also very well recieved!
