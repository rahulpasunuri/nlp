This was a nice simple recipe if you're looking for a straight-forward cheesecake. However, I followed the cooking directions to a 'T', I even lengthened the cooking time by 15 minutes and it was still way underdone. Everyone raved about the flavor, but it was moosh in the middle. Some other reviewers did not seem to run into this problem, so I would recommend doing a test-run prior to a party or event. Otherwise, great, easy recipe.

This is THE best cheesecake EVER! I always use 1 pint of plain (or vanilla) 0% fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream to lower the fat content and it tastes just as delicious. I also make the following variation to turn this into an Amaretto Cheesecake: 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 4 eggs, 1Tbsp almond extract, 1/4 cup Amaretto liqueur, 1 pint of vanilla greek yogurt (instead of the sour cream). Bake for 40 mins then turn off oven and leave it for 1 hr. Meanwhile mix 1/2 cup sliced almonds with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water. Dissolve water/sugar and drop in almonds. Stir. Remove with a slotted spoon onto wax paper and separate.. let cool while cheesecake is in the oven. After 1 hour, open door and arrange candied/praline almonds around the edge and return to oven and bake on 350 for about 10 mins more until almonds are brown. Remove from oven and cool. I've made this several times to rave reviews.

unbelievable cheesecake! made it several times with different types of cookie crusts... but never deviated from this delish filling. and like one of the previous reviewers, my darling found it better than his mum's own too =P kudos to the author for sharing his fine recipe!

This recipe was so easy to follow (and cheap too!). I made a chocolate crust (with chocolate graham cracker crumbs) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. I've made this cheesecake three times now and my boyfriend says it's better than his mom's :)

This recipe deserves credit because it seems pretty foolproof. I haven't had much luck with cheesecakes in the past, but this is the first recipe that suggested undercooking it and leaving it in the oven for an hour.. that must be the key. I live at a high altitude, cooked it for a generous 40 minutes and refrigerated it for 18 hrs. I think it could have used 5 more minutes in the oven; the center was a bit underdone, but quite edible and I'd rather have had it like that than overcooked. There was nary a crack. It turns out to be a rather flat cake. You can see from the recipe that it isn't any sort of fancy variation on cheesecake; it's very basic. It wasn't the cheesecake of my dreams, but it's dead easy and seems pretty foolproof, so I'm sure I'll be making it again.

The cheesecake tasted heavenly! I followed it exactly, except for the crust recipe - I used digestie biscuits as we don't get graham crackers here. I had one problem - the crust was so hard and dense, it was impossible to cut through. Any ideas why that would happen?

Sooo good. Creamy, light, delicious. I followed the recipe only added some lemon juice. It didn't crack, was cooked perfectly. I let it sit in the fridge overnight. My boyfriend said it was the best cheesecake he'd ever had!

This cheesecake was greeeeaaaattt!!!!!! I didn't change a thing except that for the crust, I used 150g of digestive biscuit with 40g of melted butter. For the filling, I used 1 cup of light sour cream instead of 2 cups. Cooking time was not changed i.e 30 mins followed by 1 hr inside the off oven. I didn't open the oven at all until about 2 hrs later. The cake cooked perfectly! I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a great recipe! It is simple, the texture and the flavor are simple and true.If you were to have only one receipe for cheesecake, this one should be it. I have never had the top crack. Just follow the instructions, be sure to divide the sugar between the crust and the filling, and you will not go wrong.

Our daughter, who is very new to cooking (has yet to boil an egg) made this for her boyfriend's family cookout. Everyone loved it. The timing for baking stated in this recipe is perfect. Do not be tempted to cook longer. The cake will continue to cook while in the oven off and the door closed. The only change made was using a blender to mix ingredients rather than an electric mixer. We have also made the recipe with the addition of lemon zest to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.

...absolutely the BEST cheescake I've ever eaten. And..it appears that many others feel the same way...since I made the "mistake" of bringing one to my office for a pot- luck lunch. Now...I'm practically "threate ned" by co-workers to bring it in at least twice a year.

Sorry to ruin the good rating but the cheesecake i baked turned out disgusting! It looked and tasted like steamed egg. I followed the recipe exactly and used Mon Chou cream cheese. I am wondering if its due to the fact that I did not use Philadelphia cream cheese, that the cheesecake flopped? I live in Amsterdam and so far I can't find Philadelphia cream cheese for baking (those in a bar). Anyone knows if I can use the cream cheese in a tub? Help!

Made this last night and this morning had it for breakfast after setting overnight in the referigerator, delicious!! Perfect creamy light texture. Baked for 45 min and did not have problems with an unbaked center, however did have three cracks. I added approx 1 tsp lemon zest and 1/3 cup crushed pineapple (since I had some leftover). Perhaps that may have attributed to the cracking? After baking, initially had no cracks but while it was in the oven for the additional hour is when the cracking occured. Any suggestions? Also the recipe doesn't say whether to use hot or cold water. I assumed hot boiling water.

I have been making this cheesecake for many years and it is simply the best I've tasted. To me, a cheesecake is all about texture and this one is very creamy, and the crust is excellent. I used "Alex's berry topping" this last time, with strawberries, blueberries and Cointreau. I added a teaspoon of cornstarch as it seemed a bit runny without; very nice. Mine crack about 50% of the time; this is easily disguised with some berries. I cook mine for 35 minutes in a 9 inch springform, with the pan of water, and am religious about not opening the oven door before 1-1 1/2 hours after, and have had no problem with not cooking in the middle.

Simple. Easy. Tasty. Smooth and creamy texture. What more could you want in a cheesecake? Sometimes, simple, easy and tasty trumps complicated and complex. My cheesecake cracked, but I had no complaints when I layered blueberry syrup over it!

I used some previous reviewers' suggestion of baking for 40 minutes because the cake did not look done after 30. It set up beautifully and did not crack; however, I did not care for the texture. It just was not creamy and smooth enough for me. I probably should have baked it for 30 minutes after all.

It was a good cheesecake, but it was a bit mushy in the middle. I like a firm cheesecake, so it was an unattractive feature to me.

My wife made this cheesecake over the weekend and it was great. It might need a bit more time in the oven, or give it lots of time in the fridge - it was a mushy in the middle, tho my wife liked it that way... we used the crust from the Pumpkin Bourbon Cheesecake recipe, which is awesome. Any hints on how to keep it from sticking to the pan?? Also, Alex's berry topping is a must with this cheesecake! I loved it.

Rating: 4
Amazing recipe! Very easy to make. At the same time as the vanilla I added 1/2 cup Baileys, then I baked about 40 minutes (even though I used the 9" pan). It was creamy and delicious with a subtle Baileys flavor. Next time I'll probably use more Baileys (with more Baileys I'll bake a few minutes more). The secret is to let it cool overnight and then refregirate for 6 hours or more. A real keeper!

I submitted this recipe in 1992 and named it after my husband's uncle, who always made it for the holidays. When I told him it was published in Bon Appetit he got annoyed with me for sharing the "family recipe" so I asked him how he got it and he replied, "Oh, someone I worked with gave it to me!" It is still a family favorite in our house!

SOOOOO easy. Creamy. Rich. No more complicated recipes for me! Substituted a ginger snap crust. Made in two smaller springform pans lined with parchment. No topping needed. Addictive. Next time, will try with lemon juice instead of vanilla, or maybe minced/crystallized ginger.

Easy, Creamy, Dreamy... I always look for complicated recipes with lots of ingredients because I think that the more complicated, the better the recipe... wrong! This recipe is easy and it tastes like you slaved over the springform. I tried it with a crust compination of ginger snaps and vanilla wafers. Try it with any crust. A definate success. I tried it with an alternate topping. 1/2cup each: strawberries(sliced), blueberries(whole) and raspberries (whole), 1 Tbs. lemon zest, 1/4 cup sugar... simmer everything in a small saucepan for 20 mins, stirring occasionally... when done, add 3-4 Tbs. brandy or grand marnier liquor... then chill. Awesome. Let me know what you think of this topping!

Really easy with a great result. It's impossible to find graham crackers or graham cracker crumbs here in Belgium so I substituted by grinding up a very typical Belgian cookie called speculaas and using the crumbs as I would have the graham cracker crumbs. This worked perfectly and the taste was terrific. I took the cake to an ethnic potluck and there was nothing left except the two pieces I had promised my kids -- there's definitely a shortage of cheesecake here!

This cheesecake is not too heavy and very creamy!! The sour cream and the tablespoon of vanilla complement each other well. As an amature I stumbled on two shorefired pointers; first make sure batter is mixed well, second in 8 inch pan bake for 30 minutes leave unopened for 3 hrs bake for another 30 minutes.

EXECELLENT CHEESECAKE RECIPIE ... if you're looking for something EASY, QUICK, and a CREAMY cheesecake. I made no variations on the recipe and found it to be incredible. If you're looking for one of those heavy solid cheesecakes, find another recipie. This one is creamy and light. Yummy!!!!

This is a foolproof recipe. I used a smaller pan, added 1/4 cup extra sugar to crust and batter, and used light sour cream. Since the pan was smaller I cooked it for 50 minutes before shutting off the oven. After taking it out, I decided it wasn't done enough so I cooked it some more. Unfortunately, I cooked it A LOT more because I forgot about it (about 40 more minutes). When I finally took it out of the oven, it looked like a souffle - all puffed up. However, it deflated as it cooled and tasted just like a cheesecake should. It definitely tasted better on the second day (and the third and the fourth...)

Rating: 4
I found the recipe to be too tart & a little low in volume for a 9 inch pan, so I experimented with an extra 8 oz. of cream cheese & 1/4 cup of sugar. It came out great for me. I also followed the recommendations to bake if for 50 minutes.

Well, I seem to be in the minority here, but I thought it was just so-so. I am a true cheesecake lover and it just tasted more tangy (from sour cream) than rich and creamy like I like my cheesecakes. I served at a potluck and close to half was left over, which I think says something too. If you're searching for a serious NY cheesecake try the Lindy's New York Cheesecake recipe on the site, it's out of this world. Just my opinion. Recipe worked fine, but needed additional cooking time as others recommended.

Even after following the advice about baking an extra 5-10 minutes, my cake still just about collapsed the first time I cut it! I thought this would be my first and last attempt at cheesecake; however, after a day or so it looked and tasted fabulous! Next time I make it, I'm going to let it set for atleast a day. Oh, and I used the gingersnap crust described in another recipe - Yummy!

What a wonderful cheesecake! I'll definitely make it again. I served it with a choice of lemon curd or raspberries for the top, but it was most delicious on its own. Baked it for the recommended time but will increase that by 5 minutes next time - the very center was just slightly underdone. Thanks for a great recipe.

After reading some of the other comments, I decided to bake the cheesecake for 50 minutes instead of 30. The cheesecake cracked on top a little, but I was able to conceal it with a can of cherry pie filling. The texture was still smooth and creamy, not dry at all. However, next time I'll probably bake it for 40 minutes. I also added cinnamon to the crust which added a nice flavor. I've been making cheesecakes for a long time and this one is a keeper. It's incredibly easy to prepare and your guests will love it!

After putting it in the oven, I realized I had read the amount of sugar in the crust incorrectly as 1-1/4 cups. Combining that with 2-1/4 cups of graham & 1 stick of butter yielded an amazing crunchy caramel crust that everyone raved about.

My husband and I agree this is by far the best cheesecake recipe around! However, just remember after you pull it out of the oven to cool, don't remove the springform ring until the cake has cooled completely. Otherwise, you will find yourself needing to come up with a creative way to decorate /cover up what was once a beautiful, smooth top! Still tasted delicious, just wasn't very pretty :)

I'd been trying countless cheesecake recipes, and this one surprised me - the creamiest (no crack), smoothest and most delicious - not too sweet. Really great. Also turned out to be simple - few ingredients. I also bake some additional graham cracker 'stuff' in a separate pan, and sprinkle it on top to cover it when it's cooling. It's the best. My search is over.

Good recipe--simple to make and quite tasty!! Due to other's comments, I was afraid it wouldn't be cooked enough and I baked it for 50 minutes. That was about 5 minutes too long--45 minutes would probably be perfect. I never thought making a cheesecake would be so easy!!

I was a skeptic. I make a New York style cheesecake which takes a lot more work and usually gets good reviews, so I was something of a cynic before baking this recipe. I was looking for something easy and stunning to make for out of town guests - this hit the mark perfectly. I did bake it 40 minutes per the suggestions of others but would probably bake it 45 next time. We sliced fresh strawberries and piled them on top - it was the perfect compliment to a wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe with some variations. I made a brown-sugar shortbread crust that was baked prior to pouring in the filling.

This is a wonderful basic cheesecake recipe. I make it (doubled) in a deep 9x13 pan for school with an Oreo crumb crust--1 pkg. ground Oreos and 1/4-1/2 cup soft butter--(lightly on bottom, marbled through the middle and rest sprinkled on top) for my colleagues at the school where I teach (kids seem to love it too). It's nice made in a clear glass straight-sided souffle dish, no crumbs, but heavily buttered, and served with raspberries or strawberries or both.

After making the cheesecake exactly according to the recipe, i.e. baking it for 30 minutes and letting it stand in the oven for 1 hour,I found that the centre was so liquidy that I had no option but to bake it for an additional 10 minutes. The centre was still soft after the additional time and only started to firm up when it had been in the fridge for a couple of days. This cheesecake tastes good, but if I make it again, I will probably add 15 minutes to the cooking time. P.S. I have been making cheesecakes for over 20 years.
