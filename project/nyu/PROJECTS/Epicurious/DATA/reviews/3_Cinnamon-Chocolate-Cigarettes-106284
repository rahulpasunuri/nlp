These were delicious and pretty. Next time I might try vanilla beans. Not for beginners, but worth learning how to make.

This recipe was disastrous and 100% not worth the effort. The cookies stick to evreything and anything, including silpat and go from being rollable but raw to perfectly golden, crisp and tasty but brittle in a matter of seconds. I have a huge mess of crumbs and little sweet crepe-like things now. the only positive note is that this was an excuse to make the Death By Chocolate ganache recipe, which is very yummy indeed.

First of all, I loved this recipe and wouldn't change a thing. It's relatively easy, tastes wonderful and I would certainly make it again. Secondly, to the cook who started this nonsense about the name in the first place - you and others like you need to stop using this area as a soapbox. I don't think i'm alone in saying that those of us who read these reviews do so to gain valuable insite into the recipes themselves, period. If you have an unrelated issue with the recipe other than it's ingredients, instructions, etc. please write a letter to the editor but don't post those concerns here. This is not a chat room.

I thought these cookies were just delightful. Not too rich but has a good chocolate flavor. While I do not agree with the recipe's name, I feel that small narrow minded individuals are far more threatening to the world than a cookie recipe with the word cigarettes in it. Get a life!

Very easy to make. And to the lady who wrote the review about the name of this dessert. Lighten up !!!!!!!
