this is not a twist on a classic italian dish because it is using barley. traditionally (going way way back before there was rice in italy) risotto was made with barley. you might say it is the real thing.

Read the notes and I've made a lot of risotto. Sauteed mushrooms and onions together to slightly brown, removed about 3/4, added barley, cayenne pepper, about 1/2 tsp lemon zest, and garlic to remaining, sauteed a little more. Added 1/4 c. vermouth, stirred around, used a very rich turkey stock from Thanksgiving. When nearly done (1 c. stock to go), added the reserved mushrooms and onions. At the end, added 1/4 c. parmigiano reggiano with the parsley. It was a nice brown color due to the sauteeing and very full-flavored. Delicious! Will definitely make it again!

This recipe needs just a few adjustments. Be sure to add a 1/4 to a 1/2 a cup of white wine to the risotto to give it a more authentic risotto flavor. Also, I added some lemon zest and red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. add the lemon zest and some chopped up dino kale (stems removed) right at the end before you serve it. Do the things I mentioned above and this dish will knock your socks off!

I agree that this recipe needs to be spiced up a lit. I added more onions, 3 instead of 1 garlic, used the soaking liquid of dried mushrooms, added some white wine and just before serving 1 tbsp of butter and some parmigiano. this way it came out quiet nice.

I was disappointed. For the amount of time I put into this, I'd rather have used aborio rice. I normally love the texture of barley, but it just wasn't right for risotto.

Does the barley really turn out creamy like aborio rice? I would like to make this for a vegetarian dinner party but have reservations.If anyone who has made this could comment, it would be greatly appreciated.

this was good, but barley needs a LOT of extra flavour to be exceptional. I used mixed dried mushrooms-rehydrated with some of the rehydration broth instead of all chicken broth, also truffle oil while cooking and topped each serving with a pat of butter and more oil. The barley still needed some camembert cheese to really put this over the top. with a little tweaking, it's definitely worth making.

To make this Vegan I added safflower oil instead of butter and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I then served it in a roasted squash half. For the vegetarians - add parmesan. For the carnivores - add sausage, chicken bits or shrimp. I've made this a few times and I prefer the barley texture. Its easy, healthy and yummy. I'm going to try the suggestion of gently toasting the barley first. Add more mushrooms - makes it even better!

Also use the porcini liquid with the chicken stock for the risotto. It does take about an hour and 15 minutes but a great tasty treat with brisket for the holiday.

A great healthy recipe. Add more flavor by toasting the barley lightly before beginning. I also use about 2 cups of onions and carmelize them before adding to the barley. Adding an ounce of dried reconstituted porcini also adds great mushroom flavor.

This was delicious, cheap and healthy! What more could you ask for in a dish? I loved the hearty flavor from the mushrooms, garlic, bay leaf and thyme. Def. will make again

Tried this for the first time tonight. It lacked the richness I associate with traditional risotto. I added some parmesian cheese and stired in some hard butter at the end which helped. Will definitely try it again.

This recipe was very tedious to make and it didn't have a good taste. It may need different seasonings or something else added to it to help it along. I do love barley and mushrooms but not this recipe. Sorry

We were inspired to make this dish after eating barley risotto for the first time in Cape Town. Using barley instead of traditional risotto really makes this dish special.

I'll be quite honest and say I changed this recipe in several ways, but stuck to the heart of it with excellent results. I have made many a "real" risotto in my day, and while this isn't the same, it's an excellent much-healthier-than-white-rice substitute. The naysayers and risotto snobs are just silly and I suggest you ignore them. The barley adds interesting flavour and texture, and works very well with the mushrooms. You will almost certainly need more broth than is called for - it's always better to have more than you need than not enough. Definitely try this as a one dish meal. Unless you don't like barley or mushrooms, but if that's the case, why would you read this recipe?

This dish was a big hit in our house, I used cremini mushrooms and substituted olive oil for butter. Will definately make this again.

Excellent. I modified slightly since I am doing Weight Watchers. Instead of 2 tsp of butter, I added 1 tsp of olive oil and I used 1 tsp for the olive oil for the mushrooms. Next time I will double the recipe. My husband liked it very much and there are not many left overs. 1 cup, 3 points.

This is great! I followed the tip from Orange County cook to add broth to sautéed mushrooms and garlic. I also realized after starting that I didn't have enough barley so used 2/3 barley, 1/3 arborio. Served with braised fennel. Yummy!

LOVE this recipe. I have made it several times and have come up with a few minor changes that I like. First and foremost, I saute the mushrooms (various types, usually shitake, portabella and chanterelles) with the garlic and then add the chicken stock into the same pan. This way the stock takes on a stronger mushroom flavor. Yum! Then I add a bit of parmesan cheese to each serving. Adds the perfect finishing touch. If you do add cheese, remember to be light on the salt when you correct the seasonings at the end, as the cheese will add a salty flavor.

Different, but good. We love experimenting with new grains for side dishes. The barley's really good for you, too.

Loved this recipe although I must admit the one ingredient it lacks is parmesan cheese. I added about 1/4 of a cup at the end. I also suggest adding a package of assorted dried mushrooms to the chicken stock to give a stonger mushroom flavor.

Added (for this portion) about 1 tbsp. of curry, 1 tsp. of turmeric to add some interest. Came out great. Don't overcook it (50 mins may be too much).

I was a bit skeptical but the results were great. The term "risotto" has snob appeal, but if the purists object, then call it something else. The dish is what it is, and we enjoyed it. We used morels and a handful of domestic white mushrooms. And here's the kicker- I used my rice cooker and it worked! Easy and tasty, risotto or not.

This dish has a yield that goes way beyond what you put into it. Simple to make and tastes wonderful.

Ick!!! I like whole grains and mushrooms, but this was gross. Heated up the next day and it was still gross. Use your mushrooms for something else!

Sorry...but there is no comparison to risotto. Go for the real thing.

I skipped the preheating of the chicken stock and the results were still excellent. Great with a simple meat or chicken presentation because risotto has lots of personality.

While risotto can be tedious to make, this recipe is well worth the effort. It will become a new holiday favorite.

This is spectacular! Follow the recipe to the letter and you will be very well pleased. It goes extremely well with fish and poultry. Try it with your favorite roast chicken (skip the stuffing), and fresh green beans on the side. Served with a well-chilled Chardonnay, this might qualify you for a place on Mt. Rushmore.
