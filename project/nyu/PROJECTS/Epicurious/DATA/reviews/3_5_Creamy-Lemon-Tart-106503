This was good but not exceptional. Interesting texture. It is time consuming to make although it is not difficult. The no-bake lemon tart (also on epicurious) is much easier to make and just as tasty. Much better value for time with that other recipe.

This tart did not work for me. The custard finally thickened after about 40 min., but never set when I put it in the crust. It turned out like pudding on crust. Both the crust and custard tasted good, just not pleasant to serve.

I made this recipe for a dinner group with a Mediterranean theme all of us liked it however I doubled the filling and let it sit overnight chilled and added it to the tart shell about 3 hours before I was ready to serve it and it worked out great--I'll make it again doing the same thing. I used an 11 inch tart pan with a removeable bottom.

I love lemon tart and I have made many but this one is the best. I used the optional zest because I like a lemon dessert to be tart. The crust is very fragile and hard to work with so I just pressed it in the pan. When it's baked you can't tell the difference. I served with Lemoncello as suggested by the article and all of my guests cleaned their plates!

The crust and filling both have delicious flavors. The texture of the crust is perfect and the filling is true to it's name - creamy. I've searched high and low for a lemon tart and I've found it - no more searching. Note: I double the filling and it goes right to the top.

Everyone went nuts over this recipe. A bit labor intensive, but very good.

This is a fabulous recipe! The lemon is very fresh and tangy and the crust has just the right amounnt of sweet. I have made it for guests a number of times and always receive rave reviews.

Quite good and satisfies the lemon craving but I've had better lemon pie/tart recipes. The crust was a hassle with all its steps but had a nice taste and texture (like shortbread). The crust was also quite thick. The lemon filling was not too tart but not too sweet. It really didn't set properly until the second day and I cooked it until if was very thick. Good but not great.

Wow! This is one tart tart. Think I would have been better off with straight lemon curd and whipped cream.

Superb! Made it for Easter dinner and everyone loved it- even those who thought they had no room for dessert! Easy to make for such an impressive dessert.

The lemon filling in this tart is very good. However, I don't think it is suitable for a pie filling. It is too runny. It would be perfect for individual tartlets or spoon like jam on scones.

Delicious and easy! I increased the lemon peel a little and topped it with strawberries and blackberries. The contrast in flavors was great! It was tangy, but really really sweet.

I have made this tart on numerous occasions and it always impresses. To enhance the look and the tangy lemon taste I usually cover the lemon cream with fresh (or thawed frozen) raspberries. And the fact that this should be made the night before serving makes for easy entertaining!
