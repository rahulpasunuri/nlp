This was a hit! AND super easy. Used lowfat milk and manchego cheese - other than that followed recipe -

Oh, and used frozen corn which was absolutely fine - if you're busy don't bother with fresh

This is it! I'm an epic Thanksgiving cook - a good corn pudding has eluded me until this year. This was easy to make and gorgeous. The consistency was fluffy and moist (take it out of the oven while it still trembles a bit in the middle). I also as per other revues reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup which was good because I would not have wanted it any sweeter. I assembled the recipe an hour before we ate (had the corn puree made but didn't add the dry ingredients nor the egg and cheese until just before I popped it in the oven.

Great recipe. I used some buttermilk along with whole milk, since I had it. It took me 10 ears to get 2 lbs of corn kernels, but the ears were on the smaller end. I omitted the sugar, since the corn was sweet. The poblano on top is a nice touch, and wasn't too much work.

This has become a family favorite. My youngest nieces asks for this at every meal. Everyone takes seconds, including the pickiest eaters. It's a bit of extra work, and worth it for the results.

This is the best Torta de Elote I have made. I just wanted to mention for all the cooks who found there was too much sugar, the corn in Mexico is not sweet at all, not like the one in Canada and the USA, so it was a good idea to omit half the sugar asked for in the recipe.

Fantastic. As I learned part way through making this recipe that I didn't have a blender, I just stirred it all together and used 1/2 the sugar and threw in a piece of cooked chopped bacon and it was delicious. I would make this again - even without a blender - whole kernels and all!

Fantastic! I used fresh, home-grown corn and could have used much less sugar.

Super!!! A great way to use fresh corn when you're tired of chowders, salads and on-the-cob. Took about 5 ears to get to the 2 pounds of kernels. My corn was very milky, so added only 1/2 cup of whole milk and omitted the sugar because the corn was very sweet on its own. Cooked up beautifully. It's so light and fluffy, I wasn't sure it was done, but it was. Since I like savory flavors I think next time I will add some herbs, but it's still perfect the way it is.

Wonderful flavor. Made for kids so I omitted the peppers. Still very flavorful. Substituted wildflower honey for sugar.Quick and easy recipe.May cook a little longer next time. Would have liked a firmer center.

This was brilliant. I made it according to the recipe, but half only for four. Everyone raved and had seconds. You could easily use just half the sugar and still end up with a great dish. Perfect really.

Rating: 4
Delish! I made it with fresh corn that I cut off the cob. It never really got pureed in the food processor, even after a good 7 or 8 minutes, but it tasted absolutely fantastic! I did bake it about 5 minutes extra until it was golden. Everyone raved! The sangria recipe from Fonda San Miguel is great too, as is the actual restaurant in Austin.

Definitely a repeat. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup but next time I will leave it out altogether - the corn is sweet enough.

So yummy! I halved the recipe and cooked in round9 inch clay pot for same amount of time.

Really good! I wish i would have read reviews before i made it, it definitely did not need 1 cup of sugar. I put in about 3/4 cup and i still would have preferred less. I also threw poblano and red peppers in the food processor and folded them in, they added a lot more flavor instead of just topping with them. In addition to the peppers for topping i added cheese and breadcrumbs, and used twice as much cheese when folding it in. All in all, it was delicious and everyone loved it. i almost considered not beating the egg whites, but did and everyone loved the texture. And it looked like a souffle and have a nice crust. Another bit that i wish i would have read in advance: not rinsing the roasted poblanos, instead putting them in a bag and then removing the charred skin. I don't cook with them much and didn't realize how mild they get after rinsing. This recipe will probably become a regular!

I made this as directed and it is delicious. Next time I would use less sugar, though. 1/4 cup would be more than enough. This recipe seems flexible in that you could leave out the peppers and add something else (or nothing) if you wanted. This dish is very filling and can serve a lot of people. Any time I have to beat and fold in egg whites I consider it a pain, but for the taste and amount of servings you get, this dish is worth the little extra effort.

Made as prescribed except that I halved the recipe-which worked out just fine. Great flavor and consistency. It has a light pudding and souffle like consistency. Recommendations for next would be: reduce sugar by a tbl spoon and include just a pinch of cayenne to the corn. Otherwise-excellent and the leftovers did reheat quite well.

Halve the sugar and this is a perfect recipe! Goes so well with savory sides.

GREAT success! I made this at the last minute for Xmas dinner (my mom wanted a corn pudding). It was fantastic. I used less sugar per reviews, but only a bit less. I also didn't have whole milk, so instead, in grinding the corn, I used a little bit of skim milk and the rest was reduced fat sour cream. I also added shredded asiago cheese on top-- I think having sprinkled cheese on top is crucial because it creates a nice cheesy / crusty finish. Also, didn't have a red pepper or poblano chile, so used one jalapeno and a bit of pickled pepper (red and yellow) which worked out fine. It was a huge hit and super easy to make; also very adaptable to change. Will definitely make it again-- ASAP.

I would cut down on the sugar a lot. I made it with a little more than a 1/4 cup sugar and it was a tad too sweet. I also reduced butter to 4 T and it was yummy!

I made this for Christmas dinner last year as something different. I'd never had corn pudding before, so didn't know what to expect. It was ok, but I was slightly disappointed. I expected more, it was a bit bland, even with the green chiles. I've since tasted the corn pudding they serve at Fonda San Miguel, and it had a bit more flavor. I think I would add some cayenne to give it a kick if I make it again.

Where is the recipe for a corn souffle?

I live in Austin and get to enjoy Fonda San Miguel on a regular basis. I was so excited when the cookbook came out and included the corn pudding. All I can say is this recipe is always a big hit at dinner parties. I follow the recipe almost exactly, using frozen cut corn. The only change I make is that I use a bit less sugar. Frozen corn is often quite sweet unto itself. If you do not have the time to roast the poblano, you can get almost the same effect by simply slicing the poblano in long strips and sauteing quickly, skin-side down, in a very wee bit of oil. Use two forks to slip off the skin before placing the strips. However, if you have time, roasting the pepper is preferable; it adds flavor. I place the green and red strips on in alternating colors. Before trying out reviewers suggestions, I encourage you to follow this recipe to the letter so you can draw your own conclusions. And, if you come to Austin, be sure to make reservations for Sunday brunch at Fonda San Miguel. Outstanding!

This dish was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I used a cubanelle pepper instead of the poblano, as I couldn't find a poblano at my grocery, but otherwise followed the directions as written. Depending on the height of the dish you are cooking it in, you may need to add some time to the cooking. I used a 12" by 7" and it took about an hour to cook. But when it came out, it was worth it. It looked great on the dinner table, and tasted great as well. As stated in the recipe, the pudding/souffle will sink after 15-20 minutes out of the oven, so it is definitely important to take this out of the oven at the very last minute before serving.

Love it. I will be making this instead of cornbread from now on. Even though I loosely followed the recipe (Embarrassed to say but I only had canned corn and I was rushing so I missed the part about saving the egg whites. I threw one in at the end.) It remained a crowd pleaser. I only had some canned chipotles on hand so I chopped those up and made a little tree design on top. The flavors really soaked through the pudding. Great dish.

Very good and moist. Cut sugar in half. Can make in morning and refrigerate, then pop into oven. Serve hot!!

This dish is absolutely fabulous! Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The pudding turned out moist, delicious and lightly sweetened. This will definitely be a regular holiday side dish for us.

I made this tonight to go with steak chili, cutting the recipe in half for four. I used Monterey Jack cheese with jalapenos and substituted half and half for the milk. Results were well received. It was easy to make and presented nicely in a pottery casserole dish. Will definitely make it again.

Fantastic. Everyone loves this recipe! Used less sugar and pureed only half the corn (about 5 fresh ears of corn) then added the rest to the batter before baking. Also chopped the poblano and put it into the batter instead of as a garnish on top. Be careful not to burn out your food processor with this one!

Rating: 4
I've made this twice with a couple of variations and both were fantastic. In my latest batch I folded in fresh corn, a good bit of cayenne (to counterbalance the sweetness) and diced, roasted poblano. If you want to lighten the dish, I've found it works well when substituting Splenda for the sugars and a reduced fat cheese.

I served this today and was a little disappointed by it as it was rather bland. Some of my guests really liked it though.I think I would try it again, but would definitely punch up the flavors.

I first tasted this dish on vacation in San Diego. I have repeated the recipe 6 times. it has never failed. It's worth the effort to fold in the egg whites very gently. You won't be disappointed.

Excellent but way too sweet. As the corn is sweet, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup but next time, I will not use any sugar. Yummy!!!

WOW! This was so wonderful and I cannot wait to make this again. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and baked in an oval baking dish. Sine the dish was not as shallow as a 13x9, it took almost an hour and a half to fully cook through. I also assembled this dish in the morning, set the dish in the refridgerator and poped in the oven later in the day. It came out perfect!

Great stuff this! Halved the recipe (except for the cheese) and baked in 8'x8" pan as there were only two of us. Used shredded "Mexican mix cheese" as that's what I had on hand and added a bit of grated Parmesan. Husband raved about it and made me promise I'd make again soon - and often.

I just made this for the first time, and it is delicious. Light and fluffy, it was the perfect compliment to a spicy, pork dish. I did not find it too sweet, but corn sweetness varies so wildly. I always taste my corn before adding sugar to avoid adding too much or too little. I will definitely make this again.

I seldom give a recipe 4 forks, but this is exceptional. I used fresh corn and cut the recipe in half, and it worked fine. I think that adding ham or chicken to the pudding would make it a main dish.

absolutely fabulous...people have begged me to make this again. I didn't find it too sweet at all, but I suppose that is personal preference. Used frozen corn kernels (thawed) and it came out fine. I did make this once in advance of the party and it fell a bit, so now I make sure it is coming right out of the oven when guests arrive. A winner!

All we can say is...YUUUUUM!!! This was an enormous hit at our dinner party - it came out even better than I had dared to hope. It is also not *nearly* as hard as the recipe looks, so don't let that put you off. I can't give it a higher rating - this is now one of our staples for parties and has already been requested for our next gathering. You must try it!!

WOW!!!!!!! This was great. I used fresh frozen corn thawed and cut up some red peppers and folded in before baking. Next time I will use fresh off the cob corn with the red peppers.

I made this in an oval baker and topped it with extra cheese and a dusting of cayennne for a bit of kick. It had the entire group at "Hello" since it looked every bit as wonderful as it tasted. I even screwed up and forgot to defrost the kernels and it STILL came out great. (DO defrost them though for optimum texture)

This recipe was fantastic! I made it as a side dish for our Mexican-themed Christmas Eve dinner and every single bite was eaten. My guests all asked for the recipe. It was light and fluffy and delicately sweet - a wonderful balance to an otherwise spicy meal (pork chili verde and spicy beans). Highly recommended.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a big hit! I attempted another recipe given to me by a friend who claimed that she made the best Corn Pudding, and regretted it! It just did not compare to this one! I got her to try this recipe, and she tossed hers out! Next time, I will stick to what works!

Extremely easy and delicious; played to rave reviews by our Thanksgiving guests...I took a few liberties which I strongly recommend. Fold fresh white corn kernels, 1/2 of a red pepper, finely diced and 1/4 c. additional roasted poblano chile, diced into the mixture before baking. I also doubled the amount of cheese and used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk instead of all milk. Finally, be sure to add a bit of salt and freshly ground black pepper before baking. Sinfully delish!
