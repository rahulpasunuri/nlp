Love this! I added grilled shrimp, scallops, and veggies, and used a cheese blend of parmesean, asiago. I will use fresh diced tomatoes and herbs, only half what's called for (it was a little too tomatoey) for the next version.

Very disappointed. I followed the directions precisely because I don't normally cook in the microwave. I cook risotto frequently for my family and this was a stunning disappointment. The rice was still chewy after the fourteen minute cooking session in the microwave. I had to add additional broth to the rice and cook for an additional six minutes. The flavor was OK, but not terrific. I will make this again, but in a poele pan on the stove. I have to agree with the reviewer that balked at the idea of cooking risotto in the microwave. It wasn't awful or inedible, it just could have been so much better!!!

I don't know what these folks are talking about who rated this only 1 or 2 forks. The way I learned about this dish is that my late father had made it for dinner, but I hadn't been home. Late at night I was hungry and found the leftovers in the fridge. It was so good, so garlicky and delicious that I kept pulling it back out of the fridge to grab another forkful! Since then I've made it many times, and it always produces the same effect in me of wanting seconds and thirds, and I have to hold myself from eating too much of it.

This was really good. I was a doubter at the beginning - I am a risotto maker. But this came out really nicely. I used tomatoes from the garden instead of canned. I peeled them and them put them in the food processor to chop them up. It was pretty quick and so much easier than standing and stirring. I wouldn't make all risotto this way, but once in a while, it's yummy! I also used vegie stock and left the onions pretty chunky.

prefer the long cook method. it was lacking true risotto flavor.

Excellent. However, I modified the dish to cook in my dutch oven. I do not have use for a microwave and the dish was perfect using my trusty le cruset!

after adding the rice and cooking for the second 4 minute pass, i was confronted with a bowl of burnt onions, garlic and rice. the dish was ruined even though i'd followed the instructions correctly. perhaps my microwave oven cooks more intensely than the average but that hasn't been an issue in the past.

The reviewer that does not think arborio rice should be cooked in a microwave obviously does not understand how rice cooks. Risotto is one dish that is perfectly suited for preparation in the microwave, as Barbara Kafka explained many years back in the NY Times. I have been making her microwave risotto (and variations) for years to rave reviews. I also make risotto occasionally the traditional way and there is very little difference. The nice thing about microwaving, is that you don't have to stand over the stove the whole time stirring and you still get delicious results.

being the fool i am, i didn't realize it was for the microwave, so i followed the instructions on the stovetop instead (sans the "oven" part, which is when i figured it out). it's GOOD! i make it at least once a week, and throw in shrimp or sausage to make it a main dish.

Can't understand why one of these reviews considers it a waste of arborio rice. What a fool!! It's not like this is a BBQ recipe. The recipe's nice, I can say that having chosen to take a chance with my precious arborio stockpile.

Risotto in the MICROWAVE? Not a chance I'd waste the aborio.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare. I've made it with chicken and with beef broth and both were good. I'd recommend it to beginners, and people who want a good side dish without a lot of fuss.

The risotto had an odd texture from being made in the microwave. My boyfriend enjoyed it, but I do not think I'd make it again.

We just consumed this dish with friends and as a beginners risotto the results were impressive. We added basil and sage to the dish which gave it a great lift. We served it with al-dente green beans with garlic and butter. It served 4 of us with no leftovers.. We will be making this dish again.. might make double though.
