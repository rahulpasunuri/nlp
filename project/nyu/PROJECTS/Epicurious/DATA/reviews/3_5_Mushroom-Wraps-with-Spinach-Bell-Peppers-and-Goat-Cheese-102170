This was a delicious, easy dinner. I cooked the spinach with the mushrooms and tomatoes and added avocado. The mushroom/tomato mixture was even better the next day for lunch.

Excellent and very easy. I'm a vegetarian and it is difficult to find such good veg recipes.

Awesome! The cheese really makes this dish. Even my meat-loving boyfriend loved it! I halved the recipe and it was enough for 2 wraps each. I cooked down the liquid from the tomatoes 10 minutes longer than the recipe indicated, until the liquid was truly thick. I can see how cooking it down any less would result it a very wet and sloppy wrap. I also couldn't find any "Mexican style" stewed tomatoes so I used "original recipe" and sprinkled in a little chili pepper. I did not find it necessary to heat my tortillas, they were already very pliable. Very quick and easy to make. All the components could be prepared ahead of time and assembled when needed. Very versatile: any variety of peppers or greens could be used. I don't think I would use roasted peppers, however. The fresh bell peppers added nice crunch and texture.

I've been making this recipe for a few years, from the Epicurious site. I love these wraps! Sometimes I add a little brown sugar to the tomatoes, it's a great compliment to their spice and the sharpness of the goat cheese. Otherwise, I don't change a thing. I do use small tortillas, less filling for each, and then individually wrap them and freeze them for lunches. They taste great cold or reheated!

These were delicious. I substituted zucchini for the yellow peppers and added thinly sliced cucumber. I did not add the cilantro or plum tomatoes because I didn't have them. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the Mexican stewed tomatoes, again because that is what I had on hand. The goat cheese really makes these unusual and rich so don't substitute that. A big hit with my husband and his friend after several hours of surfing.

We really enjoyed these wraps. Of course made some changes - steamed the spinach and added to the filling at assembly time. Used red peppers, plentiful and cheap at this time of year, and grilled them. Wonderful with garden tomatoes!!

I have tried the recipe as is: but, I do not like the mushrooms sauteed with the Mexican style tomatoes...it seemed a bit too spicy, and was sloppy inside the wrap. Whenever I make this now, I prefer to grill some portabella mushrooms instead, slice them, and add them to the wrap along with some sweet oven roasted tomatoes. This blend of mushrooms and tomatoes, along with the creamy goat cheese, peppers and spinach is wonderful.

I have never been a mushroom lover, but dishes like this are changing my culinary attitued. I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese. As an added twist, I purchased tomato-basil tortillas. I suggest 12 inch tortillas to hold all of the filling.

Very tasty. Made them for a picnic, and they were perfect. Agree that there is too much filling. I ended up making 10 wraps from this recipe. Only used 1 can of tomato sauce and it was fine -- not too dry. Loved the cilantro. Added flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was light yet filling. I also didn't have any Cilantro but it was fine without it. Oh, and also didn't use the Tomatoes, husband doesn't like them too much! I also used Roasted Red Peppers instead of the yellow bell peppers and it was GREAT! Definitely recommend this one!

Very easy to prepare, and very filling. It's a good meal when you are in a rush.

Great light meal! I agree - less filling per tortilla and I can see where either goat cheese or feta would work. Don't leave out the cilantro.

Yummy, my husband doesn't like goat cheese so I used fetta cheese instead. Turned out great and healthy too!

We really liked this dish and I took the suggestions of others and used less filling. I also didn't have any cilantro but they still tasted great!

This is a quick and tasty lunch. The combination of ingredients was refreshing; however, it is basically a variation of a salad burrito. I do recommend it as is but might spice up the tomato/mushroom combination with some cumin in the future to suit my personal taste.

This recipe is a great mix of healthy ingredients and is easy to make. I do recommend using a smaller portion in each tortilla. I found the goat cheese to be a wonderful compliment to the vegetables.

I love the idea of this recipe because it's very simple,tasty,and filling for a meatless meal. I always have trouble incorporating vegetables into my diet so a recipe like this makes it easier. I will do some things differently next time I make this. I found it cumbersome to roll up the wraps with the amount of filling suggested. Next time I intend to use half as much filling in twice as many tortillas. That will make them easier to eat too. Personally, I didn't care for the Montrachet goat cheese either. It's a little overpowering. I'll try a different type of cheese or use a lot less of the Montrachet next time.
