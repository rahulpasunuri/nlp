Whoops! That review was for Grilled Asian Flank Steak, on this site, Delish!

I made this for a party of six for dinner. Everyone, including myself thought it was delicious. Even got a couple "awesomes." I did marinate it overnight, used regular cabbage for the slaw as that was on hand. Tasted wonderful. Really enjoyed it.

Easy to make (if you use jarred roasted peppers) with complex flavor results. The only thing I did differently was to add a squirt of lemon juice to counter balance the sweetness of the peppers. Next time, I'll use less sugar. Served with broiled fish over couscous.

Excellent! Not sure what this should taste like, as I once made a different Harissa recipe that was totally different. Note that I wasn't impressed with my first attempt, however; I can see that this latest receipe will be a standard condiment in my refrigerator. I used a dried red pepper instead of the crushed pepper and it worked nicely. Many other recipes use cumin and I'm pondering adding some to my next batch. Another thing I did was to only use one tablespoon of oil to reduce the calories. I assume the shelve life will be shortened but I think it will be consumed quickly.

Wow - what a fantastic sauce! I made this to go with the Moroccan-Style Vegetable Stew on this site. Substituted a jar of Trader Joe's Fire Roasted Piquillo Peppers for the fresh, agave for sugar, and cumin seeds for caraway since I was out. Sublime!

I made this sauce to go with the Shrimp Phyllo Purses recipe on this site (instead of the sauce included with that recipe). It went well together, but I didn't fall in love with the sauce on its own. No acid to balance the sweetness. Maybe next time I need a red pepper sauce I'll try it again and add a splash of red wine vinegar, to taste. I used fresh red peppers but honestly think jarred would have been just as good, and a lot easier.

I am addicted to this sauce. It is fantastic. I've used my own roasted peppers and I have used jarred peppers and - much to my surprise- I didn't find any difference. It is, I think, the toasted seeds and garlic that makes this sauce a winner. I serve it with grilled lamb chops, grilled/poached chicken, and even grilled shrimp. Try it!!

This sauce is a winner! I, too, used jarred red peppers due to others' recommendations: a 32-oz jar of Sclafani "Red Pepper Hulls" the whole quart, drained. Perfect! Easy! I also ground the toasted seeds and was glad. I hit the occasional whole one and found it annoying.

Thanks to the other reviews, after I toasted the coriander and caraway seed, I ground them in my spice grinder and then tossed them into the food processor. That helped avoid biting down onto whole spices, of which I am not a huge fan. Great with the Swiss Chard and Lima Bean soup, but sounds great for almost any foods.

Very tasty and healthy sauce. Because I'm not a huge fan of whole spices, after I toasted the coriander and caraway seeds, I used my spice grinder to fine grind them. A mortar and pestle would work as well.

The flavor was terrific (with tweaking), but we didn't like the texture of the seeds. They stayed very crunchy even after being pureed. Next time I will use more ground coriander and leave out the caraway (not one of my favorite flavors anyway). I also used canned roasted red peppers (thanks, reviewers) and added quite a bit more spice than the original recipe called for. I served the sauce with grilled potatoes and we liked it a lot. Next time will try it with chicken.

This was great! I need harissa for a recipe and couldn't get it in the store so I made this. It was way too much, so I just put it in a jar and used it for sandwiches. It stayed good for quite a while. Will definitely be making this one again.

What a great recipe. my husband said it's the best one he's ever had. Loved all the tips. Thanks.

Wow, this stuff is amazing! I also subbed pre-roasted red bell peppers, and since I wasn't sure how much to use, I used the entire jar, drained. It was the perfect amount. This tastes even better the next day.

I've always wanted to try harissa, but never had the opportunity until I tried this great recipe. Will definitely make this again! The only change I'll make will be to grind the caraway and coriander in a spice grinder first. It's just a personal preference--I'm not crazy about the flavor of coriander when I bite down on a larger piece of it.

After being in France where you find harissa everywhere in tubes (even the school cafeteria!), I was really annoyed not to be able to find it in any of my local markets. However, I'm glad its unavailability led me to this recipe. It has a depth and complexity of flavor that can't be matched by store-bought. Good-quality jarred roasted peppers work fine and make this fast and easy, but DON'T skip toasting the spices and garlic. I usually don't like caraway but it adds just the right note. Great in couscous, on chicken, and just about anything else you can think of.

I've seen recipes for this sauce before but always thought it was complicated. This one is very easy. I used jarred bell peppers too and it still came out wonderful. I'm looking forward to making a big batch of this and canning it to give as gifts. I can already see lots of uses for harissa (it was great w/the cinnamon chicken).

Spicy! Omitted the caraway seeds since I didn't have any...pretty tasty -- gave flavor to the Lima Bean/Chard soup...

Served this with the cinnamon-roasted chicken with harissa sauce, as suggested. Wow! This is great and nothing like the harissa sauce you buy in tubes and use with couscous. I cheated and used roasted peppers from the market - they were authentically flaked with black from the roasting and I don't think they hurt the end result (and saved me a lot of effort). In addition to marrying perfectly with the chicken, this would be great with lamb and even grilled fish.
