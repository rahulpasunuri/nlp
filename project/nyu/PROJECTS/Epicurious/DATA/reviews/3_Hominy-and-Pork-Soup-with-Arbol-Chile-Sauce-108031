I agree with the reviewer from Mexico - 3 cloves of garlic is nothing - you need at least 2-3 heads! And we usually use espinazo, or the pig's backbone, for flavor, along with pork leg chunks. I don't know where the allspice came from, and sesame seeds are usually used for thickening mole or pipian, not for this chile sauce. Using canned hominy instead of fresh nixtamal won't give you the best flavor - I've had both, and it's a totally different and BETTER dish if you use fresh nixtamal, in terms of taste AND texture.

My girlfriend is from Mexico, and her mom makes this all the time. However, she never uses sesame seeds or allspice (ew). She uses oregano and mexican basil. Also, she uses pork sholder for the meat. The reviewer who advised to soak the meat to remove the blood is right on the money. However, she uses canned hominy to save time. And, refuses to use the corn mix. I guess its a personal choice :))

We are a pazole loving family and this receipe surpases all of our favorites. I used frozen hominy rather than the canned and spare ribs for all the pork meat mainly because I don't like picking the bones out of the dish. Call it what you want, this dish was wonderful and a new house staple. I can't believe anyone who made this didn't give it their highest rating unless they were looking for something other than Mexican pazole. Change the name!

Cook from San Antonio Del Mar. I liked your critique. Now I want to try the real thing. Can I be so presumptious as to ask you to email "your" recipe to nelumvila@yahoo.com?

True pozole blanco is incredibly delicious! First of all..a pork head is traditionally used, not pigs' feet. I don't use either. I use ribs and boston butt (pork shoulder). Second, canned hominy is really not a good substitute for the real thing. I use dried hominy and use slaked lime to peel it, but packaged nixtamal will do. Third..3 cloves of garlic? Try three HEADS of garlic! The broth will have no flavor without it. Do NOT peel the garlic! Also, I serve the meat on the side, as is traditional. I also chill and degrease the broth first. The meat should be soaked in several changes of water for a couple of hours to remove the blood, then skimming is almost unnecessary. You don't BOIL the meat, you simmer it as for any other stock. If you're using nixtamal (found in Mexican groceries in bags in the deli section), boil that first until it flowers, then reduce the heat to a simmer, add the meat and heads of garlic (preferably wrapped in cheesecloth), a whole peeled onion and simmer for about 3-4 hours. Remove the meat, shred and reserve. The sauce doesn't have allspice in it, nor sesame seeds. I soak the chiles, then add a clove of the cooked garlic and a ladleful of the hominy and broth, then blend. Oregano should be on the side with the other veggies and the sauce. My friends claim that I make the world's best pozole.

Not so good.

In the desert southwest, where this recipe is prepared frequently, canned hominy would never be used. Instead, a fresher version called nextamal is used, which is basically corn kernals and lime. It's usually available in the refrigerated foods section of the supermarket. Also, I prefer to use oregano in place of allspice for the chili sauce.

Why would anyone eat pork in this way if they want to be healthy?

My ex- mother-in-law used to make pozole & this recipe is very close to what she made. She may not have been a professional chef, but she was a world-class cook, so you can have no better compliment! She used the neckbones in her recipe. MMMMMMM!!
