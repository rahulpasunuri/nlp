I made the chocolate almond and the coffee. The chocolate almond was pure heaven. The coffee one had a grainy, slightly gross texture, but I blame myself for not cooking it long enough.

I made the Zabaglione gelato hoping to achieve something close to the wonderful gelati I had in Italy. Neither I nor my husband liked it. Way too much Marsala flavor and the texture was a far cry from great Italian gelato.

I have made the coffee gelato a number of times and it always turns out great. FYI - It takes longer than 5 minutes for the mixture to thicken and boil.

I just made the zabaglione gelato portion of this recipe (I doubled the recipe) and it was a huge hit among my family! In the winter, I'll skip the freezing part of this recipe and just serve a nice, warm, comforting glass of zabaglione. Delicious, and very satisfying to make.

We just made the coffe gelato and it was excellent! It was so easy and the flavour and texture were perfect - creamy and smooth. Can't wait to try the other two members of the trio!
