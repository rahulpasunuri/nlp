Fantastic recipe. Cut down on the sugar and used apple juice to soak 4 cups of farfel, as suggested. Substituted dried cranberries for apricots and soaked raisins in rum overnight - gives it a fresh, complex taste.

@ mousepotato - We usually have kugels as a side dish, but I suppose if it were really sweet you can have it for dessert. Made this last year for Passover and everyone seemed to enjoy it. We will cut down on the sugar this year.

As suggested, I cut down on the sugar -- using 1/2 cup of brown sugar (per the recipe), and only 1/2 cup of the white sugar. I also used 7 matzohs, rather than 6. Everyone loved it, and several people wanted the recipe. It will be on my seder menu from now on!

This is delicious--and tastes very traditional. Two points, in addition to those above about reducing the sugar. 1) When soaking the matzoh in the water, just put the matzoh in a big bowl and add the water. But make sure to gently toss the matzoh periodically, or the bottom ones will disintegrate while the top ones are too dry. 2) You can use a 9x13 inch pan and it comes out perfect. Just the right height, I believe.

At two o-clock in the morning I was forced to remake another apple kugel for the 2nd Passover night. When I first read this recipe's ingredients, I thought that it would make a wonderful sweet kugel. Unfortunately after I finished the product I found the following. 1. Use matzoh farfel or break down the matzoh boards into small equally sized pieces. 2. Use only 5 eggs instead of the 8 eggs. You get a nice consistency when mixing the eggs with the matzoh and apple mixture. 3. Use 1/2 cup of sugar in the recipe. You have the sweetness of the brown sugar, the orange juice and the raisins. No need for 1 1/2 cup of sugar added to this mixture. 4. It is a matter of taste but I added some crushed almonds 5. I did not add 4 tablespoon of margerine on the top of the recipe. It browned beautifully without the fat on top of the kugel. Would I do this recipe again? The answer is NO!

Absolutely delicious, and a big seder hit! Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the granulated sugar to 3/4 cup, and it seemed perfect. This dish was great for taking to a seder at a friend's house, because it tasted good either hot or at room temperature.

Like most of the reviews, I used half the sugar and split by 1/2 white, the other half light brown (packed). Everyone wants this recipe and said it was by far, the best kugel they'd ever had! Thanks! (The kids loved too.)

I made creme brûlée for the first seder and had the whites of 8 eggs left over. Beat these into stiff peaks. Mixed the fruits, OJ, matzoh sugar and other ingredients with two whole eggs, then folded in the whites. The mixture was too heavy to be a real soufflé, but it did bake up into a nice puffy kugel - much lighter than usual. It was a big hit at a pot luck breakfast, but I agree with other reviewers that it might be too sweet for dinner. for dinner.

Does anyone know if this would be good with noodles instead of matzoh? I made it for Passover and it was incredible, but I'm hoping to make it with noodles for Yom Kippur. Any suggestions are appreciated!

This is the third passover that I have made this dish - by request since the first time I made it - and it is still fabulous especially with my modificiations! I always cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. This time, I had no yellow raisins so I just doubled the dried apricots. To make it just a tad healthier, I used 6 eggs and two egg whites and 4 tablespoons butter mixed with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil. I also added a bit of lemon zest and voilá, it was divine.

Very good. Used 1c dark brown sugar total as sugar per other recommendations to cut sugar. Ended up baking until butter was bubbling at the side (about 45 min.) at equivalent of 370 oven (I was short on time). Doubled recipe- Used 3/4c dried pears, cherries and apricots and was short by 2 eggs, but didn't seem to hurt it at all. Was a hit at the Seder.

This recipe was great! It was a huge hit at my seder and everyone asked for the recipe. Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cut brown and 1/2 cup white. I also might suggest adding another sheet of matzoh (7 instead of 6). I thought it was a bit fruity without enough matzoh. Overall, a GREAT dish that reheated well (I made 2 days ahead). It was great for breakfast too!

Definitely delicious, but really important to halve the sugar.

Rating: 0
This is a great dessert recipe for a seder. As a side dish with dinner, I would reduce the sugar by 1/2 or 3/4 at least. For a seder I suggest substituting other fruits in the kugel. Apples in charoset and kugel seem redundant.

Rating: 4
Made this for first night of Seder. I was a little skeptical after reading some of the comments on how sweet it is. It was exactly the way a kugel should taste. Ended up using dark brown sugar instead of light - totally fine. Everyone really liked it. Also used half dark raisins/half golden, made it look more interesting with the different colors and apricots. After pouring the warm water over the matzoh per recipe instructions, it soaked it up and did not need to be "squeezed."

Rating: 4
This is the 2nd year I've used this recipe and I alter it a bit. It fits perfectly in a 11 3/4 x 9 1/4 x 1.5 inch pan. I use 1/4 c. brown sugar with the apples, & 1/2 c. brown sugar with the egg mixture. I use 3.5-4 cups matzo farfel (and then you don't have to squeeze the liquid out--it just absorbs the cup of liquid--and I use apple juice instead of water to soak it). Usually I make one with apricots & raisins, and this year I did one with just apples and rum extract. Also, skipped the margarine for the top.

Excuse my ignorance, but I'm not Jewish, so please be understanding. Is this a dessert or a side dish? I've seen numerous kugel recipes and find that they can be one or the other, with sweet kugels being used as either a side dish or a dessert, where does this one fall?

I made the recipe as written, and it is tasty but really too sweet, with all the fruit plus the sugar. Will definitely reduce the sugar next time, to 1 c total rather than 2 c total, and just use all brown.

To get my kids involved in the meal, I had my 11-year old son assemble this dish after I prepped all the ingredients. We used 1/2 c of sugar as some reviewers recommended the first time we made it. The kids gobbled it up, although we all thought it could use a little bit more sugar. Second time we made it, we used 3/4 cup sugar and diced the apples a bit smaller so they would soften more during baking. The dish was even better. Everyone at the table, kids and adults, loved this dish. Even my son said, "I don't like keeping Passover, but I have to admit, this is gooood!"

The bar is set so low for Passover food, I was pleased this was so tasty. We've been eating it for breakfast. I used half pears and half apples, substituted dried cranberries for the apricots and used a total of 1 cup of brown sugar (no white sugar). My apples were not particularly tart, and it ended up plenty sweet. It certainly didn't need any more matzoh as far as I'm concerned.

this is absolutely delicious! i made it as indicated except i used 7 matzohs, and i reduced the sugar as others recommended. i actually only had 3/4 cup sugar left in my cupboard so that's what i used, but i think it would have been even better with the full 1 cup as others used. i sprinkled some sugar on top before i reheated it the 2nd day, and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. i will absolutely be making this again.

I think I found my new comfort food! Loved this dish. Could even be made for a Passover Brunch. It reminds me of a bread pudding with matzoh substituted for bread. Did half the dish with just apples (for the kids) and half with full ingredients. Everyone liked it!

What can I say that hasn't been said? I made this for my Passover seder in Beijing, China and it was the #1 favorite recipe of all of the guests. It's perfect as written, can be made a day in advance and served at room temperature. Perfect when you need the kitchen for other things on the day of the seder. And the best part? Afterwards, I found out my mother made the same recipe for her seder in New Jersey and got equally rave reviews!

This kugel got rave reviews at our seder tonight. When I finished putting it together I thought it looked a little light on the matzo and heavy on the fruit, so I added two more matzos and an extra splash of orange juice for moisture. I also replaced the apricots with cranberries. The white sugar I cut to a scant 1/2 cup. I'm sure 1/3 or maybe even 1/4 cup of sugar would work well - you get a lot of sweetness from the fruit. For margarine I put 6T on the kugel and used 2T for topping, and that was plenty. I'll make this again next year.

I made this for Passover and everyone agreed this is the best matzoh kugel ever! I also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and did not put butter on top. I actually made it a week in advance, baked it, covered it tightly with heavy duty foil, and froze it. I defrosted it the day before seder and baked it covered with foil for about 30 minutes until it was hot--it came out great, and it was a big help to be able to make it in advance. This will definitely be served at our seders from now on!

Rating: 4
I never made kugel in my life but decided to do this for a brunch and it was fabulous, if a bit on the sweet side. One downside is that the recipe does not say how to tell when the kugel is done. For me, it was when the butter started to bubble all around the outside. I wonder if anyone else found it extremely generous? I doubled the recipe and ended up needing two 2 & 1/2 quart casseroles and a 10 x 14" pan. I did inadvertently let the matzo get soft by trying to do too much at once, and actually liked it that way as it became more like bread pudding, especially in the round, deep casseroles.

My daughter made this for the first sedar onSaturday. It was absolutely fantastic; the best matzoh kugel ever. This kugel will be the only one we make for Passover. If there were more forks, I would give them.

This was terrific, with a few modifications. It calls for way too much sugar. I used a quarter cup with the apples and a half cup with the matzoh. I upped the number of matzoh and used oil instead of butter or margarine. I did not put any on the top, either. I used currants rather than raisins for some contrast. I served it with the pot roast with dates and oranges from this website and together they were a great Passover seder meal.

i made this for the seder 2 nights ago and it was quite delicious. the apricots really make the dish something special. as other reviews suggested, i cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup. even with that, the dish was quite sweet; more like a dessert than a kugel. next time i will try 1/4 cup white sugar. although i am seldom one to complain about too much butter...i will probably reduce the amount next time as there was literally melted butter oozing from the slices. that said, it was so yummy everyone raved and it will definitely be appearing at next year's seder!

Another rave review! This is every bit as good as the other reviews indicate. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, sprayed cooking spray on the top instead of dotting with butter, sliced the apples instead of chopping, and added 1 extra matzo and about 1/2 cup extra hot water as my matzos seemed too dry. So good it should be a year- round recipe, and leftovers made a great brunch the following day with some fruit. A keeper!

I made this for Passover last night and it was AMAZING. I have never liked Matzoh Kugel and was unhappy my task was to make one. I followed other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/2 - 3/4 cup white plus the brown and used one banana in place of an apple. I also used dried cranberries instead of the apricots. Delicious and I'm on the site this morning to email the recipe to my hostess and mother!

Rating: 4
I was completely surprised by how great this recipe is. I wanted to stick with just apples, so I cut the apricots and raisins and added two extra apples instead. I kept all the sugar as I figured the extra apples would need it. I also threw in an extra 1/4 cup or so of orange juice when I mixed everything together, as the matzah didn't all get soft. I made it at 10am, let it cool down, then threw it in the fridge since it was 6 hours until dinner. Someone accidentally threw it in the broiler when it was time to re-warm it; despite having to scrape off some burned top, it was amazing. This is my new Passover staple, and it's honestly so good that I'll probably make it on any old day as well.

Rating: 4
Have to add my kudos for this recipe as well. I followed the suggestion to cut the sugar, and was glad that I did since it was sweet-- a small piece goes a long way. I used the dried fruit I had in the house, so dried cherries, currants (most people don't like raisins, but do fine w/ currants), and apricots were my fruits-- looked very pretty to have some dark colors mixed in. I had no problem with the texture or consistancy since I also added the extra matzo as suggested-- wonderful and enjoyed by all. Made this ahead of time as a side to the veal stew w/ mushrooms on this site, and it was a great compliment to that dish. Added some steamed asparagus, and all in all, a very easy and delicious do-ahead meal.

Having never made this before, I made it yesterday in advance of Passover [just in case it was a flop]. My oh my... one of the most delicous kugels I have ever tasted! I followed others' suggestions & used 3 apples, 1 banana, cut white sugar to 1 cup & added an extra matzoh. Also cut the butter to 4 tbs which was plenty. I know this will be the hit of tomorrow night's seder [and will also replace the recipe i've been using for years]!

Followed this recipe exactly as it was my first time making it. I got tired of making the same old matzoh stuffing for the turkey every year. Needed a new side dish. This was the keeper for Sedar. It was great for flavor and better yet for making ahead. I served it differently than your other cooks. After making it in a pyrex, cooled it overnight, first night cutting out 8 squares (like a brownie recipe) and putting it back in a quiche dish. Put it in a 350 preheated oven for approximately one half hour and served it. Put the rest back in the fridge for another overnight for the second night of Passover. Equally wonderful and not a crumb left for leftovers. I never altered the recipe and did not find it too sweet.

First of all, thank God I read the previous reviews so that I knew to cut the sugar and butter content down. Thank you! I ended up making the following changes to the recipe: 1) I used 1/4 cup Splenda Brown sugar to coat the fresh fruit. 2) I added the zest and juice of 3 lemons to the fresh fruit. 3) I used 6 tablespoons of butter in total: 4 melted and 2 un the yop of the kugel before it went into the oven. 4) I used 3 Granny Smiths and 2 bananas, all sliced and peeled. 5) I used 1 cup of dried blueberries and 1 cup of dried nectarines hoping for more colour and flavour, and I was thrilled with the outcome. 6) I used 1/4 cup of Splenda instead of all the sugar. 7) I added 1/2 cup of sliced and toasted almonds sprinkled on top just prior to cutting and serving - for the crunch factor. The end result was that there was not a single crumb left over at last night's Seder and by 8AM today, I had already been called to share the recipe. It was 100% delicious. Thanks to all you Epicurious cooks!!

I have another suggestion given to me by my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook. When reading the recipe, she suggested separating the eggs, as she said it sounded like it could be on the heavy side. So I beat the whites until they were stiff, mixed the beaten yolks with the remaining ingredients, and folded in the beaten whites just before putting it into the oven. She also said not to peel the apples, as they would hold together better with the peeling on them. This was a huge hit at our seder, and I reheated the leftovers the next night and they were just as good.

This was an amazing addition to our seder meal. I made a few changes due to the comments in the reviews. Way too much sugar in the recipe so I used 1/2 c. brown and 1/2 c. white (my guess is that there was a typo in the quantity for the white sugar). Instead of 4 apples I used 2 apples and about 1 cup of dried granny smiths, I thouht this would help to keep it together. I also used dried cherries instead of the apricots and substituted egg beaters for the eggs. It was delicious and beautiful, cut up easily and was able to be plated.

I made this dish for my passover sedar and it was a hit! Even family members who don't like Kugel were raving about it. I personally thought it was too sweet even though I had reduced the white sugar (as suggested in previous reviews).

Having never actually tasted a kugel before making this recipe, I was a bit worried how this would be received, but everyone, jews and non seemed to love it (if taking large portions and seconds and thirds and leftovers is any indication!). Since I used dried apricots and dried cranberries, reducing the amount of sugar (to just 1 cup) was key as the dried fruit made the kugel super sweet. Even less sugar would have been fine, too. And I used 3 apples and one banana. I thinly sliced everything, which produced a kugel which stayed together very well, without crumbling at all (I tried the diced way, too... it kept breaking apart), and was 'prettier' in presentation.

Some modifications made it perfect - 3 granny smith apples, cut into large chunks, 2 bananas sliced, reduced white sugar to ~1/4 cup (based on all other reviews, didn't want it to be too sweet at all, so cut down drastically). also, probably used more matzoh than it called for, as there was no liquid to squeeze out after soaking it. consistency was fine for cutting - held together very well - could be easily sliced and served. so easy and absolutely delicious!

Best matzah kugel I've had. And was fine prepared 2 days in advance and rewarmed. It's very buttery, with the specified amount, so if you're trying to lighten the dish up, it would probably taste fine with half the butter or. I used 2 plums instead of the 3rd apple, and a mix of chopped dried peaches, plums, pluots and flame rasisns instead of the raisins and apricots (sold at Trader Joe's) - that gave it a pretty purple color.

I served this dish at Seder and It did not matter if I cut in squares or used a spoon to dish it out. It disappeared out of the dish so fast. I suggest chopping the apples by hand. Using a blender or other device will probably make the apples too small & that could be the cause of others experiencing loose or mushy kugel. This is a keeper in my family for Passover.

I was looking for a sweet kugel to make for Rosh Hashana. It needed to be parve so I substituted butter for margarine. Did not feel the need to use matzo so I substituted medium egg noodles (only needed about 1/2 package of cooked noodles.)

I made this twice for two seders this year, and it was definitely tasty but I do have one complaint--it did not hold together well for serving. I might not have soaked the matzoh long enough (although I did wait till it was quite soft), but I think the problem is more that the apples had no way to bind together. However, I had occassion to make it a third time for a Passover-style brunch buffet, and that time instead of 4 apples I used 1 diced apple and 3 ripe bananas sliced thin, with all other ingredients exactly the same as in the recipe. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I liked the taste even better because I love bananas, and the consistency was fabulous--just like a bread pudding. In fact, one of my guests suggested I serve a whiskey sauce with it the next time! :) It was so well bound together with the banana substitution that I could present it in neat little squares stacked up on a plate, instead of in a messy pile in a casserole dish. And even more of it was eaten. But if you crave apple pie during Passover, then the original recipe is the way to go--just make sure the matzoh is well soaked.

I was disappointed with the consistency of this kugel. It had so much fruit that the egg was not able to hold it together for cutting into squares...I had to serve it by the scoopful. I followed the suggestions for reducing the sugar to 1 cupful, which resulted in the right amount of sweetness. The flavor was very good overall.

My family loved this recipe, even my mother who generally dislikes anything sweet! I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, and nobody missed it. I'll make this again and again!

After reading all the excellent reviews, I decided to try this for our Passover Sedar. It was a big hit with everyone! I cut down the white sugar to 1 cup and the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Make sure to have 4 cups of tart apples,(even if you use more than 4). When preparing,I added the apple mixture, raisins and apricots to the soaked matzoh and tossed together; then beat the eggs, white sugar, salt, cinammon and melted butter together; then folded the egg mixture into the fruit/matzoh mixture. The results were delicious!!!

The whole family loved it at our seder. I had way too much food as usual, but at the end there was not a bite of kugel left. They all wanted the recipe. Next time I might try cranberries or dried cherries.

This is a first rate kugel! I made it as is, and it was gorgeous to look at and tasted delicious. A must-make for all future seders.

I read the reviews and used just 1/2-cup sugar. I also omitted the extra 4 Tablespoons of butter. What a phenomenal dish! Everyone raved about it and requested the recipe. I plan on making this delicious apple-matzoh kugel even what it's not Passover! A+ results!

This kugel was fabulous. Yes, it did take some time to make, and I made it exactly as the recipe indicated (all the sugar). It was delicious, even better the next day. One friend said he had given up ever finding a good kugel, until now. He even took some home. I would definitely make this again.

I cut the sugar by a little more than 1/3 and it was pretty good (on the sliding scale of Passover recipes.) The biggest problem is the presentation; with it's sickly grayish color and orange flecks, it was hard to convince some of the guests to try it. A few commented that it needed a topping of vanilla ice cream.

This is a delicious Passover recipe -- I followed the advice of other reviewers and halved both the brown and white sugars. Also halved the butter and used dark raisins. Then I halved the entire recipe and made it in an 8" square baking dish. Guests gobbled it up, bypassing Engel's Brownies from this site (awesome Passover brownies!). Will definitely make again!

Most of the comments about this recipe are correct, it is too, too sweet! I halved the sugar proportions and it still was too sweet, even for a dessert. I would reduce the sugar even more or even reduce the amount of raisins. I tried the recipe with farfel ( three cups) but the result was a little crumbly and did not hold together. However, a warmed small portion topped with vanilla icecream was very rich and yummy.

Made this last year and it has become a Passover Staple. Have shared the recipe with raves from all. Good hot or cold! Everyone would like it more often but I save it for the holiday.

This is a standard noodle pudding recipe adapted for matzoh. It's very good, but as previous writers have mentioned, cut the sugar in half.

I made this for desert at a Fiddler on the Roof theme party. It smelled great and tasted even better; everyone loved it. Now I'm looking for an excuse to make it again.

This was an amazing desert. It went over so well with the family that it will be a permanent staple at Passover. I've even had requests for it at other meals. THANK YOU!

I made this for Passover and everyone loved it. I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and used the dark raisins. I will make it next year. Use very tart apples to help cut the sweetness. Good for a crowd/brunch.

My mom made it for me last week and I really loved it! But eventough she put less sugat than said in the receipe, it was a bit too sweet for me. I will definitely make it again but with less sugar.

Although I've never liked kugel that much (except for noodle kugel) I thought I'd give this a try on Passover. It was wonderful! I will definitely be making this next year as well. Everyone I had over liked it as well as I did or even more. It was sweet but I didn't think it was too sweet.

Excellent!! I am one of those who really don't like kugel but this was delicious!! Definitely a recipe to keep for future Passovers! I omitted the butter at the end for the casserole topping, reduced the butter in the heart of the recipe to 5-6 Tablespoons, and reduced the white granulated sugar to about 3/4 cup. It was wonderful!

We thought this was wonderful, although a bit too rich and sweet. Will definitely make again with less butter and sugar. All attending the seder asked for the recipe.

This is a winner! My hubby *raved* about it and told me to pass it along to all the other foodies in the family. It is certainly a dessert kugel, and is richly flavored with the apples and butter. I did end up having to put foil over the top, so do check it at about 40 minutes. It makes a large amount, which is great for breakfast or lunch leftovers. This is so tasty, I think you'll be happy to add it to your Passover recipes.

I have had kugel a couple times before and never liked them (especially noodle kugel)so after seeing all the raves I decided to try this one. We all thought it was just okay, and my 'sweet tooth' son thought it was too sweet even with the sugar cut back. I give up on kugel.

Delicious! A great success which I'll be sure to repeat next Pessach.

I brought this to our family Seder. I received raves reviews. My Mom liked it better than kugels made with noodles! We will have it every Passover!

One word for this kugel "Yum!" I can not believe how good this is!! Everyone wanted the recipe. My sister called the next morning and was eating it for breakfast. My boyfriend called the next day and was eating it for dessert. I brought some to a friend's house and she was eating it cold. This is will be at EVERY Passover, every year from now on!

I'm not Jewish, but I made this dish for a potluck because several of my coworkers were observing Passover. We ate it for dessert and it was a tremendous hit. People even asked for the recipe! If you've never made kugel before, try this recipe. It's simple and delicious.

Outstanding, served at the Seder and everyone loved it.

I am on a diet, so I made some changes: I left out the butter and brown sugar, and used only 3/4 cups of white sugar (half of what it calls for). It came out great, you would never know it was a low-fat version. Chopped dates make a nice addition.

This kugel was delicious. I used 1 cup sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups called for in the recipe and it was perfect.

I've never made kugel before, so I didn't know what to expect. The 8 eggs kind of threw me for a loop. This was a big hit w/my husband's family on Passover. It was very easy to make, and tasted great. The apriocts and raisins (I used regular dark) made it better than the ordinary fare. I think I'll be asked to make this one again next year!

I almost didn't make this because time was running short, but it made the seder! With a table full of delicious food, everyone was raving about the kugel. You must make it, even if you aren't sure you have the time or energy. It's delicious!

How did you ever get hold of my grandmother's recipe? I have been making this Kugel for the last 70 years. ( I am 83 now.) It traveled well from Germany to the USA to Israel. My family would not be without it, ever!I serve it with fluffy lemon sauce.

One of the best Passover kugels my guests and I have ever tasted. Even people who didn't like apples loves this kugel. It's more like a dessert than a side dish. It will definitely become a standard fixture at Passover in our house.

This is a keeper! I made it 3 times during Passover. One guest copied the recipe and said she wouldn't wait til dinner -she would make it for breakfast! It was sweet, but played off the veal and roast vegetables beautifully.

I will make this every Passover until I die. This is a fantastic, delicious kugel.

Was good but a too sweet. I will make it next time with one cup sugar instead of 1.5 and also dark raisens would add more color. No reason for the salt so I will delete that next time. Also, can use matzoh farfel..3 cups = 6 matzohs,and much easier to make! One cup of apricots is a 7oz bag.My kids liked this alot , good dessert on Passover!
