Have made this many times. really great and so so simple. a couple of pointers for those not in the know. you dont need a nonstick pan, just use PAM and the olive oil and butter. salt the chicken sufficiently but not too much. use a fish spatula to transfer and flip the chicken, makes it so much easier. fresh sage leaves make the dish btw. be sure to have it finish in the oven at 300 for at least 10 minutes or you take the chance of it being too raw in the middle depending on how thin your breats were pounded to. dont alter the sauce, i didnt want to open a bottle of wine just for 2 tablespoons and tried to use rice wine. didnt work. so i skipped the sauce altogether and it was great anyway.

Very good and easy-didn't have fresh sage but dried worked fine-used low-salt broth but found it a little salty so would not salt the chicken before cooking-served with brown rice as I didn't have carrot orzo

Just ok.

Wow! This recipe was a delightful surprise to us - partly able to prepare in advance,easy, and truly delicious! We agree with previous reviews that the sauce should be doubled - actually we used 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice which made a wonderful and distinct flavor! We did warm the chicken in the sauce before serving it. We too served it with the Carrot Orzo and would do that again!

Loved this! Based on other reviews, I tripled the sauce ingredients and served over angel hair pasta. I would use a little less lemon pepper as I added that at the end. Made it a little too lemony but still delicious. Instead of trying to keep the meat warm, I added it back to the sauce for a few minutes. Hubby was alllllll happy!!!!!

I used multiple sage leaves on each pounded breast; two slices of prosciutto on each may have been a bit excessive; measured liberally on the sauce--still easy and delicious. This chicken got rave reviews!

I'm making this dish for the second time in two weeks. I made more sauce and added some additional sage to it and at the end the cooked orzo. Quick, easy and delicious.

The flavor of this was very good. One recommendation I would have is to use evenly sliced chicken cutlets. Mine were a little thick in the middle, and it was hard to keep the cooking time even. Fairly simple and nice flavor.

Made a slightly different version of this last night (from Cooking Light), using no flour on the chicken. Added a bit of minced garlic to the broth-lemon sauce, and it was fantastic! Served with angel hair pasta and an arugula-pear salad with balsamic vinnaigrette. A gourmet meal in under 30 minutes! Definitely a keeper.

I love chicken saltimboca. This recipe is so good and easy to make. My husband made this for New Year's Eve and we will definitely add this to our repertoire.

This recipe is a proverbial "keeper" with me. I love the fact that it looks like it takes a long time and really does not. I also like the contrast in tastes; sage, prosciutto, rosemary and lemon sauce. Subtle, but very satisfying. Great Fall dish.

Perfect quick dinner. My only problem was the wine/flour mixture - it seemed like was too much flour and it clumped up on me when I added it to the lemon juice/broth. However it was quickly fixed with the addition of more wine.

This was a great recipe that the whole family enjoyed! I omitted the salt due to the prosciutto and added more lemon and wine to the sauce - excellent!

I've made this easy dish a couple of times now. The first time exactly as it calls for. The second time I left out the salt and doubled the sauce at the end as suggested. I also paired it with the carrot orzo. A keeper!

Needs twice the sauce. I added mushrooms before the stock. I added no salt, but plenty of pepper. The carrot orzo recipe in Epicurious absolutely compliments this very well.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times now. It's great, using parma ham is a must, plus fresh sage from the garden. I double the lemon sauce and must make the carrot orzo to go with. The sweet from the carrot and tart from the lemon...mmmmm. It turns out every time.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. I ate every single bite. Although the salt isn't necessary, it wasn't too salty. I love the sauce and recommend making a bit more of it to drizzle over angel hair pasta with a garnish of toasted pine nuts. I couldn't find carrot orzo, so I improvised. I will be making this again this week. YUM!

I found the lemon complement the chicken, the sage and the prosciutto very well. I used regular orzo since I didn't have carrot orzo and it went great with the dish. I salted only the side without prosciutto.

I've made this several times and the family loves it. Agree with the other reviewers - you don't need to salt the chicken due to the prosciutto. Also add the lemon juice carefully, a little goes a long way.

A delicious recipe! Leave out the salt on the chicken, as the presciutto is indeed salty enough. I found the sauce 1 step too thick, so next time I will use a bit less flour for the thickening.

Rating: 3
Yum!! Served with the carrot orzo recipe on this site as recommended. It was a delicious combination, especially with the rosemary in the orzo recipe. Took someone's advise and added the lemon zest to the sauce. It was a nice addition. Use high quality prosciutto. It really makes the difference.

Forget the wine/flour and instead use beurre manie or flour straight to the drippings before the liquid. No need to salt the chicken beforehand. Meyer lemons would be killer!

Rating: 4
I made this as directed, except added the flour to the drippings, then added the other liquids. I also removed the whole herbs before serving(they were pretty large) because they were kind of strong. It was absolutely delicious alongside roasted asparagus and risotto. Some Chardonnay went down well with it, too.

Delicious! Beware of using too much salt because of the bite from the prosciutto and lemon. But pepper definitely adds depth.

Insanely wonderful

We are eager to do this one again. Served with brown rice (in chicken broth), broiled asparagus w/ balsamic vinegar/olive oil, and steamed carrots. I doubled sauce per other suggestions. I agree with other reviewers, would never make thickener by putting flour in wine. so I used some of the remaining flour from dusting and added water and used at end to thicken--I don't know how much, just added until it was our desired thickness. out of habit, I also sliced remaining lemon rind and added to pan for added flavor.

Easy to make! Served with a whole wheat penne in a meyer lemon cream sauce and steamed broccoli. If you have Meyer Lemons in your yard, make a theme dinner with this recipe as the anchor...delish! Ussed lemon olive oil and several sage leaves sandwiched between the pan and chicken, they brown up nice and add a needed earthy note, Just flip the chicken breast over and the sage leaves are browned and lovely on top ready to be served. Will make this again for a small dinner party...easy!

I am so glad I made this before I read the reviews; they might have dissuaded me from making a delicious dinner! I used packaged "thin sliced" chicken breasts, so I didn't even need to pound them thin. The chicken, sage, and prosiutto were excellent (although I made the mistake of salting the chicken too. I won't do that next time). I would definitely make this for company. But the sauce just didn't do it for me. First of all, why is the flour mixed with wine and added last? Normally I add flour first and then whisk in the liquid ingredients. My sauce was thick and a little bit lumpy. But mainly I didn't care for it because I didn't like the pairing of lemon with the prosciutto chicken. It doesn't go together well. I didn't make the orzo.

Tasty...although I also agree - no need for the flour. And, even without the sauce; tasty.

I thought this recipe is great. I rolled and cut coins or medallions and served with a rosemary pork loin fanned slices on plate.

We LOVED this dish. It is a bit salty, and so the carrot orzo balances it well. I doubled the lemon juice by accident, and just added more wine/flour mixture and broth - it was delicious and made a bit more sauce. I will double up the sauce again next time!

This has become a staple in my house. Even the kids love this one.(Although they call it chicken with bacon) I love the carrot orzo. This is easy to make and it's a hit when company comes over too.

I tripled this to serve a large family gathering. Everyone loved it. I followed recipe as written and thought the sauce was delicious - just enough tang to balance the proscuitto. Will definitely make many more times.

This was good-- surprised anyone thought it was bland. I used additional sage because the leaves were small and the flavor was great. I agree that more sauce is needed, however. Next time I'll double the sauce and omit the flour--no need for it to be so thick.

one of our favoriets.Sauce was just right. I could have added a little more wine. The carrot orzo was excellent. It had the consistency of risotto without all the good. AS we say in our house "Is a Keeper."

This is one of my favorites.. I modified it by adding garlic and capers and proportionally doubled the sauce since I love the sauce so much!

This was just about the easiest recipe ever to follow. It was quick, and delicious. The lemon sauce is not so delicious. We did not smother our chicken with it, but instead used just a small amount. I agree with some of the other reviews..you cannot go wrong with prosciutto. You don't need any more salt after that, btw. It would be far too salty. As for the carrot orzo. That didn't even sound good. We served ours with mashed potatoes, and that worked nicely!

I liked the sage, my husband thinks it should be omitted - but overall we enjoyed it. For best results, use good quality proscuitto.

It was good, and my sauce was brown. That's fine with me -- I too know how to cook. How could it be blah with salty prosciutto -- gotta season chicken breasts more than folks imagine I guess. Tried the fontina on one -- didn't improve it much.

This recipe is indeed quick and easy and tasty, too. I wasn't 100% sold on the lemon sauce. I think it tasted great, I just wasn't sure of the pairing with this particular dish. So I served it on the side just in case anyone didn't care for it. The chicken without the sauce is amazing.

The recipe was good. I agree that a slice of cheese on top made it better. The sauce is not light brown like the picture. (I know how to cook, it is not brown) Overall, it was tasty, but it didn't knock my socks off. If you have Proscuitto in the fridge, like I did, (that needs to be used)--go ahead and try it. Very good, not great. Good 3-forker.

Boring. The sauce was OK but the sage and proscuitto didn't add the flavor I expected because I love both those ingredients.

Delicious! As good as our favorite trattoria in the city. Definitely serve with the carrot orzo (link included at the bottom of recipe), as the sage in the chicken and rosemary in the orzo are a wonderful combination. My twists...used the juice of the whole lemon in the sauce as we like it zesty. Also used the lemon zest in the accompanying orzo to meld the flavors between the dishes.

Excelent weeknight meal. I pounded the chicken very thin and used lots of fresh sage. Also, I used red wine for the sauce, which turned a very pretty color. Served with steamed broccoli and rice.

Fantastic, quick and easy. My roommate and I both loved it, and I particularly loved the fact that it looked/tasted like something that took a ton of work, but was just as easy as can be to prepare. Made it with the accompanying orzo recipe and they were a perfect match for Sunday dinner.

Get the thin cutlets and this comes together in NO TIME- so good and easy, and goes great with the carrot orzo. To each cutlet I spread about a tbls. of a cheese mixture under the sage leaves (mayo/parm/mozz/garlic powder) and then put everything on top. I didnt make the lemon sauce and it didnt really need it so much flavor- great weeknight recipe!
