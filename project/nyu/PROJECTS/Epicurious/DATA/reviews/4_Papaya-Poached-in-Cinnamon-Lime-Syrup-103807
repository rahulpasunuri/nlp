Fabulous! Elegant! Easy! Delicious! What more can one say?

We enjoyed this but it was significantly improved by the addition of cracked pepper at the last moment. I also wonder how it would do with star anise added to the infusion but haven't tried it yet.

EXCELLENT! I just made this about 20 minutes ago, I'm writing the review while still licking the spoon. :) I used about 2/3 the amount of sugar it called for, I thought it was perfect and with the full amount of sugar it might be too sweet. I topped it with plain goat's milk greek-style yogurt, the cool tangy-ness was a great accompaniment. Topped with lime zest and demerera sugar...great recipe to use papaya!

This was surprisingly tasty and an excellent use of a less than ideal papaya. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, substituting falernum (an infused simple syrup of which I have entirely too much). This dish is very sweet and the papaya took on a candied flavor. The sweetness requires a counterpoint, like plain yogurt, sour cream, or maybe a slice of pound cake.

I make this dish regularly for a light but sweet ending. Usually serve with vanilla frozen yogurt with sauce poured over.

I actually used pineapple instead of papaya and my husband and I loved it so much that I canned some for winter enjoyment and Christmas gift-giving! So amazing over vanilla ice cream.

A delicious way to use a less-than-delicious papaya. It's easy, quick, and refreshing. One time lacking limes, I substituted lemon, and it was still great. Especially good after a spicy meal, alone or over vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream.

This was a delightful and light dessert. Use any leftovers for topping for waffles. YUM.

This was very good, but I would add more lime and more cinnamon. The papayas I used were not quite ripe enough, so it was a little bland.

I love papaya-only in Hawaii. I have always been disappointed eating them on the mainland, at thier best they are bland with very little hint of that wonderul tropical essence. This recipe was able to do what I thought was impossible- it coaxed that wonderful flavor out of what were otherwise bland papayas. I cooked them for half the time and cooled the syrup a little before pouring it on the papayas. I have never been a fan of poached fruit before (reminds me of canned fruit cocktail I ate as a child), but this recipe is a keeper

We live in Southeast Asia and are always looking for desserts that will compliment the food. This dish, seemingly so simple, was the hit of the evening. The guests were amazed that the often insipid papaya could taste so full-bodied, even sumptuous. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe: poaching the papaya for about half the time required and substituting creme fraiche for the sour cream called for. I also would be sure to advise readers to use ripe, but still firm papaya if you want the fruit to hold together.
