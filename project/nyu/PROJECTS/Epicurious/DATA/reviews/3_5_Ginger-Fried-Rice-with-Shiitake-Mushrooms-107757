Love this recipe. I always serve it with the Grilled apricot chicken wings. They appeared in the same issue of Gourmet a number of years back and it's a great pairing.I keep a big jar of dehydrated Shiitakes from Costco and I just rehydrate them an hour or so ahead of time. Makes this an easy pantry-type recipe

Love this recipe! Definitely make the crepes, it takes an extra minute but the effect in the end is worth it. The trick is to make sure the rice is COLD or it will get all mushy and stick to the pan. Also, don't use too high heat. And yes, add more ginger :)

I have made this recipe several times, and it always turns out wonderfully.

Much better than most restaurant's fried rice because you can limit the oil. My fried rice loving teen said it was better than anything he had eaten out. I used half shiitake and half baby button due to the high cost of shiitake's and it was still great.

It was alright, little too gingery, and deffinitally a bit too greasy for my tastes generally.

My husband and I loved this dish, I agree with some of the others, in that it needs alittle more ginger. Next time I make it, I am going to add alittle diced carrots.

This recipe was wonderful. When stir frying the rice I added a couple of tablespoons of margarine. (At Tsukasa, Vernon Hills IL they added margarine to there stir fried rice for flavor) and we also added sweet soy at the very end.

I'm Chinese myself and I loved this simple recipe! I third the motion for more ginger (more taste)! Lastly, the secret to browning the rice IS to let it stick to the pan so it burns a little. When it sticks, scrape the bottom of the pan as you're tossing the rice so that other flecks of rice get a chance at the bottom of the pan ;) You'll notice that the tossing motion will break up any chunks of browned rice as well.

This got raves at a dinner party. I tasted it after following the recipe, and added soy sauce while frying the rice and sliced pea pods. I scrambled the egg instead of making the crepes and slicing. I also added black pepper and used peanut oil instead of vegetable. Very good!

I made this with brown basmati rice, which i think is a lot like regular brown rice at twice the price. I had a little less than three cups of rice and i added probably a little more than one tablespoon of ginger, so the ginger taste was very good, especially the next day. I found it difficult to brown the rice without adding more oil. It would stick to the bottom of the pan, so i essentially stired the rice in and heated it through. I did add some peas.

I made it with brown rice to be a little healthier. I'll second the call for more ginger. The egg crepes were easy and quick - don't even think about omitting that! This was quick and easy and goes in the regular weeknight rotation for me.

Easy and tasty. Would have probably liked Tacoma's better though - not quite enough ginger! I tossed in some baby bok choy and peas because they were languishing in the fridge. Some pork or shrimp will go in next time to make this a one dish dinner.

3+1/2 forks. Very very good - and I'm not really a big fan of rice in general. Made enough for seconds - and can't wait to have them soon!(I did make the egg crepes b/c I had the time and liked the results). Wonderful!

Loved this recipe. Goes great with Salmon w/mustard maple sauce. Easy!

As the name describes, this is a fried rice dish. My suggestions: after making the eggs, add more oil to the pan, turn up the heat and then add diagonally sliced celery pieces to the pan and then salt, stir frying all the while. Then add in a small amount of cooked ham that has been small diced. At the end add in defrosted green peas with the scallions. A mushroom soy,(dark soy sauce not for everyone) will add to the flavors.

A Wonderful rice side dish, with a light and possibly week ginger flavor. I usually add soy sauce to the dish while cooking, as well as at the table to give it a bit of a kick, I am still playing with it to figure out how to give it a bit more of a kick. I usually have this with the cedar plank salmon also on this site(the best salmon ever). the two complement each other wonderfully. Enjoy!

This is a great fried rice dish to use up all that left over cold rice. The key here is to use peanut oil (sesame would probably work too) rather than vegatable oil in the first step. Also, don't be shy with the ginger - that's what gives it the flavor. I've made this 3x now, my boyfriend and I both love this one.

Easy and delicious. I'm vegetarian and made this for my carniverous boyfriend as part of a large veg meal. This dish turned out the best of all the I prepared that night. I will definately make this again. I had seconds and he had thirds.

I liked this, but my husband loved it. I think I overcooked it a bit, which I will watch for next time. I had to use button mushrooms, because I couldn't find shiitakes. I'm sure they would have added a little moisture and better flavor/texture. I made it w/the apricot chicken, which worked out well.

I really liked the ginger flavor but I felt that something else was needed. I drizzled some of the soy glaze I used for my salmon. Soy sauce is another option. It makes it taste a little more like traditional fried rice.

So delicious you have to make enough for double servings! To make it a bit healthier I combine brown and white rice (cooked separately). Awesome with the "salmon with soy honey and wasabi sauces".

I make this all the time to rave reviews. Instead of making egg crepes, though, I just add scrambled eggs because it's easier for me. My boyfriend hates mushrooms but still eats this with a smile. Great for potlucks!

Excellent. Used Jasmati white rice from scratch. Forget the "crepe" making, just add a beaten raw egg right before taking off the heat (before adding the scallion greens and sesame oil) and gently mix. Also used some white and brown crimini mushrooms...yum!

Really like this rice, used only sesame oil and omitted vegetable oil. Will make again, with an additional egg and little more salt. Maybe some black pepper. Simple to make, go ahead and make it and draw your own opinion.

Don't let my two forks fool you, this was a good choice for my menu. Served along with a seared tuna. This dish would fall short by itself, but it is a great complement to a strong main course. Added a bit of pork to a portion of it and it was great. My rice was cold, but had a high water content that increased the cooking time. Tasted even better the next day warmed up ! This is a good recipe to experiment with and extend onto (chicken, beef, seafood, etc)

This is very good, particularly accompanied by the soy glazed salmon on this site--the maple syrup/soy glaze adds a little zing to the salmon and the rice. Don't be deterred if you don't have "leftover" rice--we cooked the rice first and let it sit in the refrig until time to make it; it was fine. HOWEVER, you really don't have to make the fancy little egg crepes--just scramble the eggs and dice them to size for the rice. This is a fried rice that will accomodate most any veggie or meat or fish/seafood. It looks particularly pretty with the fresh shiitake mushrooms. It is suggested for 6 as a side dish--two of us ate the entire dish. A keeper.

Rating: 4
I was surprised by how delicious this was. My ginger was very fresh with a high water content so it sizzled and gave its flavor through the dish. The only change I made was to add the green onion a few minutes early to mellow its flavor. I used basmati rice because that is what I had. I might have used a bit more sesame oil than called for. I will definitely make it again.

I got all excited to make this, I was disappointed. I added chicken and had to add some teriyaki. It was very bland. Noone in the house liked it. I wouldn't make this again

Rating: 3
I also thought this rice was very good, another way to make rice and it will be great to add other things to it (veggies, chicken, shrimp). By the way...you need to use cold rice because hot rice/freshly noiled rice will get mushy when you fry it.

Wow. This is very fragrant and yummy. And you could get very creative with it - other veggies, etc. But I highly recommend it as is.

Another unique way to have rice, which is what attracted me. Cook from D.C. was right - this is open to a myriad of additions. I could see sauteed fresh asparagus or sliced sauteed red pepper added. I added a little teriyaki sauce and substitued portobellos for shitakes. Didn't mean to take away from the origin of the dish - found this was much more economical, and it was delicious

Like the other reviewers, I found this dish easy to prepare. It's rather bland, but that can be a plus. It is certainly a nice side dish to have in your repetoire, and it is most definitely not as greasy as any fried rice you would purchase at a Chinese restaurant, so it has it's health values. Normally, I would follow a recipe to the "t" for it's first preparation, and then allow for variation, but I could tell during the process that I would need to boost it. I added some diced baby bok choy that I had, as well as some petite brocoli florets. I also added some pieces of Chinese barbequed pork. You do not need to do the one egg in two batches. One cooking in a large pan will suffice. The beauty of this dish, in my estimation, is that you can add a bounty of things: meats/seafoods/vegetables to it and do it no harm.

Well Jeez, I've never commented on a dish before but by the looks of this one, it sounds like a doozie! I don't see why we have to use cold cooked rice though; my girlfriend and I really enjoy the sticky moisture of fresh rice. AH well, just one cook's opinion

I didn't have any leftover rice, so I cooked up some basmati rice and refrigerated it for 2.5 hours while I marinated the Chinese-style Roasted Chicken. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and only 1/4# of shiitake mushrooms. The smell of it cooking was absolutely divine! Tasted great, with a simple but good blend of flavors! Served with the chicken for a memorable meal.

can someone PLEASE just submit a review that gives me some information on the TASTE of this recipe and stop this ridiculous banter about how long rice can go in or out of the fidge before it kills you? This is not a website for analyzing the scientific results of spoiled food - has ANYONE even attempted to make this recipe or is everyone assuming that they cannot make it in case the rice spoils - judging by these reviews - no one should ever eat rice again - can we give it up here and focus on the taste????

The reviewer from S.F. commented that she leaves out her rice and it is a cultural thing. My husband is from Haiti. Everyday for 50 years his mother has cooked rice in the morning, left it out on the stove with the cover on, and the whole family ate it when she came home in the evening. Her mother before her did the same and no one has ever gotten food poisoning in their life. You all may have your scientific terminology and holier than thou attitudes, but cultures differ and you should respect that. I am American and I always refrigerate everything, but my husband has eaten meat and fish patties that have been left on the counter for days and has never gotten sick. He has done that his whole life. Remember, the reason Jews/Muslims don't eat pork is b/c 5,000 years ago, people ate undercooked pork and died. This would not happen today but the belief is there. Would you try to convince them to alter their reasoning. All I am saying is TOLERANCE people. like i always say on this site: "Food police need to stop the brutatlity!"

Rice does rot if left out and not in fridge. it gets spindled, smells, and tastes it. Can make you sick if you eat rotten left over rice. if you fry rotten rice,and eat it, you will know the next day it was rotten.

Actually the bacteria responsible for food poisoning due to fried rice is NOT Yersinia (you get Yersinia enterocolitica from pet feces-i.e. puppies). It's Bacillus Cereus. Sorry to correct you but as a third year medical student who loves to cook I couldn't resist.

Congratulations to all you safety-minded foodies. Yes, rice that is time/temperature abused will cause you to get a bacterial infection...it's called "Yersinosis". It will hit you 6 to 12 hours after eating rice that has fallen below the safety zone of 140 degrees for more than 4 hours. Reheating to proper temperature will usually fix the problem, but proper food handling and storage is always such an easy preventative, why take the chance?

Just for Brooklyn's information, the reason that cooked rice (or pasta) must be refigerated is the post-cooking water content. Water in food allows bacteria to breed and rapidly multiply. Refrigerations slows down this process but does not eliminate it. This is kind of basic food safety. Think about bread, etc.- it's dry... I agree that all readers should be respectful of others but I hate to think what else Brooklyn might be leaving out in their kitchen.

I was surprised to read the mean spirited comments left by some readers regarding the rice issue. Whether someone is wrong or right in this forum, one should always practice respect towards others...otherwise..we might think about changing the name to foodfight.com

Add some minced garlic with the ginger and some soy sauce at the end. If the rice is to hard or clumpy break it up! Or put it in a strainer and Briefly run it under hot water. Spin dry before using

Portland is right, and Brooklyn, your ignorant comments and advice could get someone sick. One can become ill from either cooked rice or pasta that is not refrigerated, and neither should be stored in the refrigerator for more than three days after cooking.

Well the way to store rice is to stick it in a container and put it into the fridge....then you won't get food poisoning and your rice will be firm...when you cook it take the container out a few minutes before cooking...

You should always refrigerate cooked rice - there's a high risk of food poisoning from it if you don't. Rinse it in cold water to cool it quickly, drain thoroughly, and put it in the fridge in a covered container.

Atlanta probably refrigerated the rice overnight, which is also a no-no and may account for the dissatisfaction with the rice's consistency. It is hard to convey cultural idiosyncracies in a recipe, such as, "cold rice, but not refrigerated, just make it and leave it covered until you're ready to use it the next day for fried rice."

Rating: 3
You always use cold, day-old rice for fried rice! Its texture is better. I add whatever leftover veggies are in the fridge... Also, you can start with white/yellow onions with the oil for more kick. And/or add soy, oyster, teriyaki, whatever sauce at the end as well. Anything goes...

The traditional fried rice is made with leftover rice. Freshly made rice are often too soft for pan frying and they become mushy. Leftover rice allows it to firm up for frying. I know my rice because I've been eating it every day for 30 plus years!!

This was a great recipe. I have made it at least 5x. I don't know what Atlanta was doing when they made this. I would make this again and again. It is so easy especially when you're in a rush.

This recipe is disgusting. The rice was hard and dried out. Why not use fresh rice and pan fry it?
