I used my regular bread and a very small quantity of milk. Still is was difficult to make meatballs. The taste is very good, I also add fresh basil to my sauce. It is a very week night meal.

I think the sauce is very good and would make again. I wouldn't change it, but may play with and spice up more. We did not like the turkey meatballs because lacked flavor and mouth-feel was too soft. Consider adding herbs. Or perhaps it was the bread, just too soft. Although followed directions, they did not pick up flavor of sauce except on the surface. Looking at other recipe on this site for spaghetti with turkey meatballs, will try those meatballs next time.

Sauce was good, but made a ton. Meatballs were really hard to work with. They barely held together during cooking. I had to cook in the oven so they didn't break during turning. In the end they were very moist and tasted quite good, but will use much less milk and bread next time.

Unless I did something waaay wrong, the yield is way higher than 8. I fed my family of 5 for two days and still had enough left over for 4 lunches. 8 lbs of tomatoes is A LOT of tomatoes. Also, I'm wondering about the choice of Italian bread, which was very difficult for me to find.
