Yummy, quick and simple. A friend made it for a Christmas potluck and I had to make it a few days later for my own family Christmas dinner.

I really enjoyed this dish with a few substitutions that I made. I baked pepper-crusted bacon and used that oil in place of olive oil. I also used a honey-dijon mustard, and topped with roasted slivered almonds, and crumbled bacon. This is a great light summer meal served with heirloom tomato gazpacho.

Very good. The pecans toasted in olive oil were delicious! I cooked the beans until just tender like the recipe suggested and the ice bath kept them crunchy and bright green even after getting tossed in the dressing. We had this with grilled chicken and sliced vine ripe tomatoes.

My family and friends love this recipe. I do substitute sliced toasted almonds for the pecans and have used elephant garlic in place of shallots. No matter how much I make, we never have any leftover so I don't know how well it keeps.

I love all the ingredients in this dish, but I thought they just didn't work together. Not bad and very easy, but there are lots of better g bean recipes that are also easy.

A tasty compliment to our thanksgiving meal. Nice change from ol'green bean casserole! Made as directed - wouldn't change a thing.

Served these at Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a huge hit. When I was making it, I was afraid that the tiny amount of dressing wasn't going to be enough, but it definitely was, even though I used a full pound of beans instead of the 3/4 the recipe calls for. The flavor of the mustard you use does have a large impact on the flavor of the dish, so use something that is flavorful. I used a green peppercorn dijon that I love for these kind of dishes. I did add a handful of pomegranate seeds to the dish for the color, but even without it, this dish was fabulous. I especially liked that it is served at room temperature, so I could make it hours before dinner, and not have to try to time one more dish. The recipe says it serves 2, but for us it'd more likely serve 4. We had 3 for dinner, and still had plenty of leftovers.

This dish was very good and easy to make. Interesting combination of ingredients yields a tangy fresh dish. Tasty with or without pecans if you're in a hurry. Will definitely make again.

This is a recipe that I will keep because we often love to eat green beans, but I am running out of ways to make them fun, yet still easy to prepare! This fits the bill...easy enough for a weeknight but can be fancy enough for a weekend nicer dinner too. Another keeper to add to my box!

I loved this recipe, I served it on Christmas day and the fact that you serve it at room temperture made getting everything on the table easier. The recipe is easy and delicious and leftovers keep nicely and still taste delicious

This dish was AWESOME!! I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. It was very, very good and easy for a big dinner since it can be served at room temperature. Hooray!!

I love this recipe. Great make ahead dish. I served it for Thanksgiving this year and got raves. The mustard and shallots give it a very unique taste. I also serve it with or without the cheese, depending on my guests. Almonds also work well.

This dish was delicious. Be careful not to overpower with too much blue cheese, but the combination of flavors is incredible. My guests raved and raved.

This was very average to me. The green beans just did not have any oomph. I ended up adding a homemade balsamic, garlic, vinegarette that I use for my fresh green salads to wake it up a bit. Of course, blue cheese is good on a tennis shoe so all was not lost! My favorite way to make green beans (fresh): french cut them, saute some bacon (a couple of pieces, add some chopped onion and a little garlic, add beans and cook on med-high so they carmelize...about 45 minutes. Delicious! A few toasted nuts of any kind are good on top too but not necessary. And, you must have Creole seasoning on them as well: Tony Chachere's in the green can is great on EVERYTHING!

This is an excellent side dish and makes green beans special. I did serve the blue cheese on the side because some of my guests didn't like it. The beans were great with or without the cheese. I will surely use this again and again.

Rating: 4
Classic. Easy to make. Nice to be able to make it ahead of time and just set on table since room temperature is the serving suggestion. This is my most requested vegetable side dish. This goes with chicken, beef, or pork. I always add a little more blue cheese than called for. Besides that, I don't change a thing.

This was delicious and very simple to make. Everyone loved it and I would definitely make it again.

I made this once before and loved it. This time I substituted pine nuts for the pecans, kept the preparation very simple. With the dressing, it was absolutely divine. Oh, I didn't have shallots so I used chives out of my garden instead, and it was GREAT!

These green beans were yummy. I didn't have a shallot so I used onion and a little garlic. The mixture of the blue cheese and toasted pecans is wonderful and it's so easy to make. A definate winner.

This is a great green bean recipe! I just crumbled blue cheese in to taste (which wasn't a lot, but enough to slightly flavor). We all loved it!

Totally wonderful! I made these on Xmas eve with Prime Rib and garlic mashed potatoes. They were outstanding. Everyone loved the flavors, especially the hint of pecan. Definitely a recipe for future dinners.

This dish is delicious! all my guests loved it - especially the smoothe cheese texture with the crunchy beans. the pecans really accentuate the bleu cheese. So quick and easy to make, but very flavorful and pretty too!!

The blend of toasted pecans and blue cheese is fantastic. This dish has gotten rave reviews all three times I've made it. This last time I crumbled some extra cheese for the blue cheese fans of the family. A definite winner.

Excellent combination of tastes and textures with the bonus of being able to make it ahead of time. One does need to be aware of the strength of the blue cheese they since some can be overwhelming. Will definitely make again, and again and . . . .

Wow! Made this with steak and corn/black bean salad. I'm now addicted to green beans!

OH MA GAWD! This dish was INCREDIBLE! Rave reviews at our dinner table. I wouldn't change a thing, which is saying something because I'm always tweaking & adjusting here and there. As another reviewer commented, I cannot imagine eating green beans any other way again. To those that hated it, they obviously have no taste, sorry.

I never knew green beans could taste so good. This recipe is fantastic! I don't know if I'll ever be able to prepare green beans any other way. I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese and I reduced the amount to suit my own personal taste. My roommate and I thought it was delicious. We were only disppointed that that the recipe makes only two servings. We would have loved seconds. I'll make this again soon!

Excellent--I've made it as is, or with increasing the mustard and adding a dash of sugar, and both are good. Sometimes I saute some chopped baby bella mushrooms in butter and add them with the pecans. Great side dish for any time of year.

Judging from the previous reviews, no one seems to be lukewarm about this recipe. We loved it! I found it a great do-ahead and we'll have it again often. Did use the tiny spring haricots verts which were very tender, and roquefort, which may have contributed to its success.

This dish was horrific. I had looked forward to making it because I love all the ingredients in it, but the result was bland. And the flavors did not blend together well at all. We tossed it.

I made this dish over the Memorial Day holiday, and my family raved. I tripled the recipe and added a container of blue cheese crumbles to the dressing and whisked to a smooth consistancy. I made the dish the nite before and marinated the green beens in the dressing without the nuts overnight. The next day I brought the dish to room temperature and added the nuts and extra blue chees crumbles before serving. I'm still filling requests for the recipe!

This is definitely a new way to make green beans. I am not a big blue cheese fan, but I really liked it. I did use less blue cheese than was called for. I doubled the dressing but would probably triple or quadruple it next time.

I made this dish over the holidays and thought it was delicious. I did, however, take note of previous reviews and quadrupled the sauce. I prepared the dish the night before, and served it the next day at room temp. The combination of flavors is excellent.

I liked this combination of flavours, but my partner found that they didn't meld together, though he likes all of them individually. I wouldn't make it for a large group, as I have found from past experience that many people do not like the strong flavour of blue cheese (I love it).

This recipe got rave reviews with my Christmas Dinner. I love how the beans were crisp and not mushy. I think it's better that night as opposed to leftovers, but I really enjoyed this recipe.

Based on the reviews, I made this dish for my Christmas dinner. I did not like it very much. some of my guests did, but not all. No one asked for the recipe. All I could taste was the bleu cheese. It overpowered the dressing, the beans, and the pecans. It was okay, but there are many other delicious ways to make green beans. I will not make this again.

This dish is wonderful. I could eat it as a meal, and can hardly wait for the next crop of fresh green beans! I do agree the dressing should be doubled.
