To the cook from Westlake Village: Get over yourself....This web site is for all levels of people interested in learning epicurean arts. Perhaps you feel you are above such simple and I might add satisfying dishes. This is a staple and I find it gratifying that Epicurious adds these types of recipes along with much more advanced ones. Thank you Epicurious....

I consider myself a pretty good cook and often attempt pretty complicated recipes, but sometimes it's refreshing to come upon a very simple, very easy, time-tested vegetable recipe that goes with anything and everything. Thank you, Epicurious, for including this in your files! They will become a staple for many meals to come...

When I serve green beans as a separate side dish, I always cook them this way. The recipe may seem simple, but it really is the best way to cook green beans. If you wish something a little more complex, garlic and/or lemon zest could be added to the butter, or try a little freshly grated nutmeg.

Hey, I thought it was about the food? If it tastes good, I think it is worthy and so do my dinner guests, many adults who still hate vegtables. I make this dish a lot for dinner parties and just quick suppers. I add a little finely chopped garlic to the butter than the beans. This is a good basic side dish for many different dishes. I make this dish a lot with some other variations as well.

This recipe is hardly Epicurious worthy. Pretty simple, nothing special.

Easy and yummy. I prepared the beans the day before I served them.
