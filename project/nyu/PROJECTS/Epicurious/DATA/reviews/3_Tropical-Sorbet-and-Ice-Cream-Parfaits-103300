Nothing spectacular - just a so-so combination of flavors. I even made my own ice cream and sorbet thinking that it would make for an excellent dessert but I don't think it made a difference.

This dessert goes very well with Thai food. The mango, pineapple, and sweetness serves as a great counter to the heat of many Thai foods.

This sauce is spectacular. It made these parfaits, and I also used it very successfully with panna cotta. Combining the sauce with vanilla ice cream and shredded coconut would make an ideal dessert.
