Fantastic. Use 2 small-medium onions instead of the rarely present shallots. Delish.

Excellent flavor to the chops! I would caution to really watch the glaze, mine burned, also the estimated cook time is about 5-7 minutes short.

Rating: 4
I substituted the shallots for chunky slices of red onion and added garlic during the sauce and frying. I also added a tiny bit of honey. My husband loved it and went back for seconds. WIN! I would definitely make this again. I pulled it off in 30 minutes. Great for busy moms :-)

Just great for an easy supper. The taste is outstanding, served with asparagus and french bread. A great light meal!

This is a really good recipe. Even my son who complains about most foods ate the whole thing. I didn't make any changes as other reviewers see to think that was best.

Rating: 4
Very good & easy indeed. Prepared it for a personal chef friend, et. al. & she promptly asked for the recipe. I used 1" chops, seared in the pan and finished off in the oven before returning to the reduced glaze. The pork was great....the shallots, absolutely outstanding! Apple, ginger chutney complimented it well.

Easy peasy lemon squeezy! Quick meal for during the week! Roasted brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes rounded out the meal!

I had some very lean pork chops, so was concerned because they can come out tasting quite dry if not cooked perfectly. They came out excellent! I did add an extra teaspoon of sugar, and used brown sugar. Very quick to make. But a huge hit in this household!

Lick the pan good. I agree that the added garlic tasted wonderful and added a more distinctive taste. This is one we will make over and over again - an instant favorite and so quick and easy. Company worthy.

This is one of my family's favorite meals! The recipe is perfect just as it is; if you are using a lesser quality balsamic vinegar, I would add a bit more sugar to taste. Be patient enough to let the sauce thicken before you add the chops back in. I use pork chops from a local grower, and they are melt-in-your-mouth tender. What an easy, delicious week-night meal!

I made this recipe last night for my family and it is OUTSTANDING. Use good balsamic vinegar and you do not have the change the recipe one bit. Excellent - will definitely make again!!!

I actually seasoned the chops in sage, thyme, all spice, paprika, and garlic to add some interesting flavors. And, instead of shallots, I used thinly sliced white onions...threw some sliced mushrooms into the glaze and bit more sugar and it was excellent.

I was looking for some thing different with a lot of flavor and this did the job!! I did not have any shallots of I cut a large red onion in to wedges and that worked. I added honey not sugar, thank you to who ever suggested the honey!

Rating: 4
If you had to add honey or sugar to this recipe, you're not buying quality balsamic vinegar. I buy Leonardo & Roberto's Gourmet Blends Traditional Balsamic Vinegar -- so thick it pours like a syrup & so tasty I drizzle it as a salad dressing alone. Keep trying balsamic vinegars till you find one yummy enough to eat on it's own!

Rating: 4
Very good and flavorful. I used 2 tbsp of sugar and added honey as well (as a previous writer suggested). The honey and the sugar helped to balance it out. I made it with rosemary mashed potatoes and a fresh green salad.

Rating: 4
Added 1 tbsp of pure maple syrup (based on others' comments that it was a bit sour as is-- I tend not to like a strong vinegar/acidic flavor) and it was delicious. Served with rosemary potatoes.

Rating: 3
I added about four garlic cloves to the shallot mixture. For the vinegar glaze, I reduced the amount of sugar to a small pinch (about 1/2 teaspoon) and added a generous pinch (1 full teaspoon) of ground rosemary. Delicious and super easy.

Rating: 4
Quick and simple. Caramelized shallots were very good. I used a good quality balsamic and added 1 extra teaspoon of sugar and the sauce turned out great! My grocery store only had 1.5 inch thick pork chops so I had to increase the cooking time. Next time will try thinner pork chops.

Rating: 3
Very easy and tasty, however, my glaze was rather runny. Next time I will use a better quality balsamic and maybe drain some of the juices from the pork when you remove it the first time.

Rating: 3
I use this type of vinegar reduced onions/shallots as a topping, by themselves, on many dishes (steak, hamburgers, pizza, etc.). I like to add Worchestershire sauce to the vinegar with and find that it helps smooth out the tang of the vinegar.

Rating: 4
Delicious!! It was a little too much twang the first day(still ooh and ahh worthy) but by the second the bite in the balsamic sauce had mellowed considerably. We served the leftover sauce with pan seared and roasted chicken which I preferred to the pork. The recipe lends itself easily to what you have on hand with a good balsamic as base. Will make again and again.

This was delicious and easy, just the way I like to cook. Done in little time, and just like the picture. A keeper, I'll definitely make again.

I have to agree with some of the reviews, it had alittle too much "bite" from the vinegar. I did add 1/4 of honey, a splash of soy sauce and one spring of Rosemary. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes. With the added ingredients, the pork chops were wonderful and very tender.

Easy to make. Great flavor! We added pears and a side of roasted red potatoes.

I thought it was delicious. Definitely would use a thicker cut of chop, but I enjoyed the flavor combo.

I paired this with roasted pears which were delicious with the balsamic glaze. I've seen this recipe where you can bake the pears, chops, and glaze in an iron skillet and it also comes out delicious. I agree that this works best with thicker chops.

This was very easy to make and mouth watering good. I make w/ thick pork chops so it took longer than instructed. Will make again for sure.

I hate to rate so low, but this wasn't all that great. I really hoped it would be, as I am looking for new ways to cook pork chops. I'll keep searching....

even though i am a big fan of balsamic vinegar, i thought this was much too strong. i may tweak it because the basic idea still appeals to me.

The wife would probably rate this 4 fork meal, but it wasn't exceptional to me. The shallots were very good in the balsamic glaze, but the chops were a little too tangy. We will try this again, but in the future I will use thick chops.

My FAVORITE! I use more balsamic and cook the chops a little longer. Also, I add garlic and serve always with roasted red potatoes with garlic, oliveoil, and sea salt. The balsamic glaze is delicious on the potatoes!!!!

Nice! Very Nice! Wonderful flavor! I used boneless chops and "Splenda" instead of sugar in the glaze. What a meal these made!

This was superb. I would NOT skip the shallots as they make the sauce perfect. I used boneless pork and I think it would be great with either.

Great, easy weeknight meal. I used boneless pork chops instead, which allowed me to get dinner on the table in 20 minutes. Fast and easy.

I loved this. I used a small handful of chopped sweet onion instead of shallots and added garlic. I also cut down the sugar to make a thinner glaze which worked well. I used thin chops which made this dish FAST. Great flavor and so easy!

We've made this several times with regular balsamic and loved it, but tried it last night with white balsamic--completely new level. Fruitier than the original.

Rating: 2
I made this with 1/2 Cherry Balsamic and 1/2 regular low grade balsamic and added a small sprig of Rosemarry in the reduction. One thing that was good was to use fresh cracked pepper for bursts of spice and I think I would try this again using some stock and less vinegar. I think it WAS overpowering to the pork but - if you like a lot of flavor, go for it. I used two chops with the same amount of sauce and the ratio was perfect. You really don't need extra sauce on top but just to glaze the meat is perfect.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor. I added a clove of garlic and used a large sweet onion rather than shallots. Next time I will double the sauce and add some red cabbage. Pork takes longer to cook than recipe indicates.

I thought this was very good. Made it for two without decreasing the glaze measurments and it was just enough. Served with cauliflower puree and steamed broccoli

The balsamic vinegar is way over-powering for this dish. Plus the dish is black-as-coal -- not appealing! I used inexpensive vinegar, maybe higher quality is the trick...

Rating: 4
I am now making this for the second time. It is a great fast and easy recipe. We were expecting it to be a little bit more vinegary last time so this time I am reducing the sugar to lessen the sweetness. This is now on our list of favorites. (Oh yeah I also add fresh garlic, b/c we love garlic)

Good weeknight recipe. I double the glaze for the 2 of us and it wasn't necessary. I used boneless loin chops about 3/4" thick and they turned out moist and tender with a lot of glaze flavor.

Made it and loved it. As others have stated, mushrooms would be a nice add-on. Pork needed a lot longer than the five, then three minutes suggested...maybe it was just my cut of meat.

Rating: 3
We cooked it down way to much but it was still good (perhaps because we enjoy balsamic vinegar). Next time, we are going to not cook it down so far as well as cut the shallots up a bit finer. Be careful if you have a properly strong vinegar - it can be overpowering but good.

We've made this recipie twice and loved it both times. The first time I used a sweet onion and the second time I had shallots. It tasted great both times. I used thick chops and they were juicy and delicious! This is definately a keeper for us. Delicious and very easy to make!

This was terrific! I agree with a previous reviewer that next time I'll double the glaze ingredients for more sauce at the end. Still, very yummy.

Glaze is great, but not enough, need to double the balsamic & shallot glaze. Also brined the chops before cooking which kept it very tender and juicy.

Excellent! I made this for dinner on Friday evening. It was very easy, inexpensive, and required only a few ingredients. I am not a cook, and this was the first time I had ever made pork chops. My boyfriend cleaned his plate. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Really easy to make and tasty result. I'll try the milk recommendation next time as the pork was a bit dry. I added some mushrooms and used red onion instead of shallots, which ended up working well I think, particularly the mushrooms! They were a perfect addition.

This was definitely a surprise last nite when I made it. The chops were so incredibly moist & rich with flavor. I'm keeping this recipe for my box & making it again. The only thing I subbed was the shallots, didn't have any so I used sweet onion finely chopped. I also paired this with some couscous made with chix stock from water & chix bouillon cube. I put a bit of olive oil, garlic powder, & herbs and everything tasted so good together. Try this you'll definitely like it.

I had salmon ready to prepare when I read the recipe, so I made it with that instead of the pork. I used white balsamic instead of regular balsamic. Otherwise I followed the preparation as directed. I served it with spinach with raisins and pinenuts as suggesed by a previous reviewer. Delicious!

This was yummy and easy. I did not have shallots on hand, but onions worked ok. I served with a spinach salad, mmmm. I second Emily from Redmond's comment on the milk marinade. It works fabulously for just about any pork chop recipe -- 1 c skim milk and 1 t salt.

Works well with chicken too.

Rating: 3
I haven't made this recipe, but regarding tender pork chops, if you marinate the porkchops in milk for 3-4 hours before cooking them, they tend to stay much more tender and juicy. Just let the excess drip off, pat them dry, and then proceed with the recipe. I use this when I pan sear chops with bread crumbs and they stay deliciously tender. I picked up the tip from the Pork Chops with Applesauce recipe on this site and it's great.

I made this about a week ago for my boyfriend and he loved it. The sauce is very delicious and the whole recipe is simple to prepare. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

I fixed this tonight just as written and thought it was great! I over-cooked the pork a bit and will need to watch that better next time - but there will definitely be a next time!

Edible, but never to repeat. It just goes to show everyone has different tastes. We love pork so I like to try a variety of ways to prepare, this did not make the grade. I think anything cooked this way will just have the overbearing taste of balsamic and sugar, nothing else. I have deleted this one from my box.

Not a keeper for me. After all the great reviews I was dissapointed. It was fine but nothing more.!

Rating: 4
Outstanding and super easy! I threw in rosemary (whole sprigs) when I added balsamic to the shallots. Also, I sprinkled chops with a little crumbled bleu cheese before serving. Great with mashed sweet potatoes. I'm convinced that those who complain of the chops being tough over-cooked them...

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Added a pat of butter as suggested by another review. I will now not add the shallots until the turn of the chops. Also I will try to add mushrooms with the shallots.

Rating: 0
After reviewing the recipe myself I went back and read the other reviews. I live in Iowa and can always get good pork. I used a thicker cut chop but didn't brine or do anything special with it and it turned out great. I think a dry, chewy pork chop is due to overcooking or maybe other areas in the US don't have the good quality, fresh pork I find here.

This was an amazing dish. The ingredients were easily accessible. (I live in anytown, Wisconsin and frequently have to order less common ingredients over the internet.) The pork was very moist and tender and the taste had a delicious edge. My family voted this a "keeper". Prep and cooking time on this dish is minimal.

This was perfect just the way it was written. Great chops (from Whole Foods) and wonderful glaze.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe and my chops weren't as tender as I would have hoped, so I would do that differently next time. 6 ounces of shallots are a lot to peel! Seemed kind of dirty to leave the root ends on, so I did the best I could and trimmed off the outermost section. Very good glaze! Maybe it would be good on boneless chicken?

Rating: 2
Like some of the others, I loved the sauce, but chops could have been more tender and moist. Might try mikey41's suggestion of brining first.

Rating: 3
This was good. Because I have such terrible luck with pork chops (they are never tender) I decided to sear and roast a pork tenderloin and make the sauce separately. Turned out great. the sauce is tangy and the shallots carmelize and are sweet when you bite into them. served with smashed new potatoes and steamed broccoli. would definitely make again.

Good flavor but my usual complaint about the lack of tender pork. Served with baked sweet potatoes and Spinach with Pine Nuts and Raisins from this site.

"Transfer pork with tongs to a plate and add vinegar, sugar, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to shallots in skillet." I found myself having to read this sentence over and over. I think there should have been a period after the word plate. It was confusing for a moment. Needless to say the recipe turned out spectacular...My family and I loved it.

This was a terrific week-night dish - quick and delicious. I doubled the amount of shallots, and added some herbes de provence to the mix as well as whisking in a pat of butter when finishing the sauce. Big hit with my husband.

Absolutely delicious! I highly urge all who try this in the future to brine the chops before cooking. Brining will ensure a moist, tender chop. This is an impressive dinner party (for four) wowser!

I modified this dish as I had no shallots. I quartered a sweet onion instead and used thick-cut boneless pork chops. My husband thoroughly enjoyed this dish and asked me to make it again. I served with petite green beans and buttered egg noodles. Found that the noodles and sauce mixed together were very delicious as well. Had the leftovers for lunch the next and it was even better.

This was an awesome recipe... although my deviation was boneless thick cut as I could not find bone in. The other variation was a 5 hour brine of water, salt, vinegar and a touch of maple syrup. This made for a juicy, tender chop.

I can't really give it four forks, because I didn't make the actual recipe. Not having shallots, I substituted small onions, and not having pork chops (it was a weeknight) I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. But I did everything else right, and it was wonderful. Maybe I'll do it the right way soon. I'll definately do it wrong again.

I didn't have shallots so minced some onion - ended up doing them first, removing and adding back once pork was done. Forgot to add them back at first and found they really added to the dish - don't leave them out!

This was a great weeknight dinner. The pork chops were easy and delcious. I served them with sweet potato oven fries and steamed asperagus tossed in vinegrette. There were no leftovers; Even my 11-year-old liked the pan sauce.

I have been making a similar dish for years. But I use apples and no shallots (I might add them next time) and I marinate the pork chops in the balsamic before. The apples get soft (like traditional apple sauce with pork) and the balsamic gets syrupy, so good!

An excellent dish!! Perfect for a fall/winter dinner party. I doubled the recipe and used a few more shallots due to my preferrence. I had to cook my chops more than 5 minutes as well and I used more S&P to really bring out the taste of the meat and shallot combo. I served it with buttered egg noodles and peas. Would absolutely make it again!!
