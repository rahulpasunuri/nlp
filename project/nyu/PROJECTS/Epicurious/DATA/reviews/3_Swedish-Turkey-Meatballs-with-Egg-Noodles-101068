These meatballs were excellent, completely different from familiar Italian flavors. The sauce is less successful; maybe keep the meatballs and find another sauce?

This was good...doubled the recipe for 5 adults. Now we have plenty of leftover sauce. I think it definitely needed the dill...adds a great flavor. I think it would be too bland without it. Only change was to use Marsala not sherry.

This recipe was a hit and a miss for us. The turkey meatballs recipe was easy to make and doubling the allspice and nutmeg was the right choice for our household. The sauce, however was a HUGE miss!! It sounded weird (corn starch, Worcestershire Sauce, and dill?!!!) but I made it anyway. The sauce was not to our liking and I tossed it in favor of making a quick sauce from Alton Brown's Swedish meatball sauce that actually includes cream. We'll keep the meatball recipe but toss the sauce.

I fried test meat ball and found that it did not have enough flavor so I double the allspice and pepper and added 1 & 1/2 times the salt and nutmeg (and I may have even added more than this.) I also added a couple tablespoons of worchestershire. I didn't want to add garlic or herbs because I was afraid it would start to taste more like an Italian meatball. I used a large serving fork to mix the meat and I believe it helped the meatballs to be tender. I too only made 40, 1+ inch meatballs from this recipe. The sauce did not come out the way I wanted it to. Because I used 93% lean turkey, I had to oil the pan and that led to little if any "brown scraps" to incorporate into the sauce. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth. So the sauce was missing that savory meatly flavor so I added a little butter and you know butter can fix anything! No one was the wiser. Because I made this for guests, I also was afaid to use the strong flavor of the dill so I didn't add it but next time I'll give it a try!

I make this recipe all the time but with several changes. First I add more nutmeg and allspice. I also add 1/8t clove. Use ground beef instead of turkey and omit worcestirshire sauce. At that point it's pretty much the traditional recipe.

The first time I made this I did the sauce and noodles. This time I still had plenty of Thanksgiving leftovers so I just made the meatballs and served them with a little cranberry sauce and my various vegetable courses. Light and lovely. I, too, found that the recipe makes a lot fewer meatballs than the recipe states. I even measured them!

this recipe featured in "Eating Light" and I've been making it for years, never for friends unless they are dieting and willing to exchange some flavor for calories. It is very healthy and tasty with the herbs, fresh spices and lingonberries. Total calories only 300 per serving. When you are counting calories, you are going to appreciate this dish even more.

This was a very good recipe. It's relatively easy, doesn't have a zillion ingredients, The meatballs freeze well, and my family will eat it. Also, it's not outrageously unhealthy. Very tasty and family friendly!

This recipe was awful! Seriously, it tasted like dog food with too much dill. I made it per the recipe except for I used dried dill (about 1 tsp.) and light sour cream instead of fat-free. The meatballs were mushy and horrible in the center, the gravy was thin and unappetizing, and the taste of dill overpowered the whole dish. I would definitely not waste my time or turkey making this again. Next time I want Swedish Meatballs, I'm going to Ikea!

I had ground turkey in the freezer, and just searched on that. I didn't have several key ingredients, so as usual, I just improvised. I had crusty Italian bread from last night instead of sandwich. I didn't have beef broth, but I did have chicken. I used nonfat plain yogurt (twice as much) instead of sour cream. I served over rice. So I'm not sure if it was exactly Swedish meatballs, but it was close. It was very tasty, however, quite salty. Given the salt content of any broth, I would be very conservative adding salt to the turkey. All in all, it was a success, and made plenty to freeze for one of those "aaackkk!" nights when you want to pull something from the freezer.

This is a good recipe that kids will love. Be sure to add a bit more Worcestershire sauce or do something else to add flavor to the sauce.

This recipe worked out exactly as I expected it to -- I used leftover rosemary bread for the meatballs and they were delicious. My only comment is that the recipe states that it makes more than I found it to.

Rating: 3
the meatballs were delicious and easy to make, and stayed fairly tender. i used half beef and half turkey, and added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic and maybe a tbsp of whole grain dijon mustard. the sauce was really good, but i'm personally not wild about either dill or worcestershire, so when i make it again i might play around with it. but even though those aren't my favorites, i still really liked it. i added some lemon juice and parsley at the end - it needed a little lightening up. i also added thin sliced mushrooms (sauteed) and doubled the recipe for maximum noodle enjoyment.

I have never made Swedish Meatballs (other than a package mix years ago). I liked this recipe. Regarding the reviewer who commented that the allspice and nutmeg combo didn't sound good-- it worked really well and I liked the combo. I did add some garlic, to the meatballs. Also, I happened to have some homemade cranberry sauce and I decided to try this as a topping (I thought it sounded strange at first). I was surprised how great all the combos worked. I would definitely make this again.

I made these for a party and people loved them! Followed advice and did 1/2 beef, 1/2 turkey and also added portabellas to saute with the onion. Made the night before and heated in the crockpot. I agree, one recipe does not even make 1/2 as many as stated! Great for parties!

Very Delicious. My husband is bragging about this to friends and family. i always cook extra and the left overs of this meal stayed fresh for over a week. I did read the reviews and followed some hints from others which made it even better.

I added worcestershire sauce to the meatballs and garlic, mushrooms, and mustard to the sauce and this recipe was superb. i've already made it twice this week!

I increase the sauce by at least half so there's enough to coat all the noodles too! And I know it adds fat but I like to use half turkey and half pork or veal, and also add the garlic/dijon recommended by other reviewers.

Great and easy recipe as is but thought addition of garlic and dijon to the meatballs was also very good. Used low sodium broth and couldn't tell the difference. One of my GF's fave dishes.

This was pretty darn good. I used plain bread crumbs from the can which seemed to work just fine. The sauce was very tasty, although I would have added some salt (i'm a bit of a salt freak). I passed on the dill (i hate it) and the cranberry stuff. I added some sauted portabello mushrooms which were deeeeeeeeeelicious! All in all, very good.

So good! Made for my new Swedish s-i-law and she loved it. I used a mix of ground turkey and pork, added parsely chopped garlic, coarse mustard and worcestershire sauce to the meatballs with lots of s & P. in the sauce I sauteed shallots, garlic and mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of beef. Also did a beurre maniee (?) with flour and butter instead of cornstarch. Served with buttered tagliatelle! DELICIOUS. Only thing I would do is make more sauce, we were a little low...

Rating: 4
excellent recipe! Served it at a camp out in the bush and have not all spices. Used Balsamic Vinegar reduction instead of Sherry and Worstershire sauce. Used flower mixed with butter to thicken instead of cornstarch and milk with lemon instead of sourcream. Still everything worked out just dandy. Used lots of nutmeg and dill. Will need to make much, much more the next time!

I will make these meatballs again but I will double the recipe because I only made 32 meatball, so either I did something wrong or your meatballs were very small.

Rating: 3
I took this dish to a potluck in my corck pot to keep it warm. I kept hearing "who made the meatballs?" I used a combination of turkey and lean hamburger. Because I ended up with extra meat, I used it all and had probably 100 meatballs. I adjusted with a little extra sauce. We thought they were very tasty.

Rating: 4
I was looking for something authentically Swedish and I think this was it. The only thing different I did was add some cream to the meat and sauce. I made these with game meat , so the cream kept them from being too dry. The meatballs were moist and tender. I served it with my homemade cranberry sauce spiked with cinammon sticks and orange peel. It was super. I will definitely make it again.

My entire family LOVES this recipe. I even make it in large quatities for a buffet and everyone loves it. It has become one of our winter supper favorites.

I used a heartier bread (potato bread)and added about 1/4 lb of ground beef since I was a little shy on the amount of ground turkey. I also added a teaspoon of dijon mustard and one finely minced clove of garlic to the meat mixture. My husband loved it but I still found this recipie a bit lacking in flavor. I will make this again but perhaps add some finely chopped cooked bacon.

Not exactly diet food, but lighter than regular swedish meatballs

Rating: 3
These were delicious. I used half of the meatballs with a half recipe of the sauce (added sauteed mushrooms and another tablespoon or two of the nonfat sour cream) and the other half in a marinara. Used whole wheat bread. I suspect the cooked meatballs would freeze well . . . that was the plan, but they got eaten up first!

This is a family favorite we have made many times since we saw that beautiful photo on the cover of Gourmet in 1998 (suitable for framing). Just following the recipe as printed has always turned out wonderfully. Great comfort food dinner, and if you can find the Lingonberry preserves (like we can, at Treasure Island) that tips it in as nicely as using a cranberry sauce. Others are right, it's more like 40, rather than 80 meatballs. I always hope for leftovers, since it makes for a nice lunch or second-night dinner.

Rating: 2
Prepared with lean ground beef, and approx. 1/2c. panko in place of bread crumbs. Definitely double the spices. Unnecessary to have separate bowls when you can mix altogether in one large one. Sauteed a combo of crimini, and white mushrooms along with the onions. Used additional tablespoon of sour cream at the end. Served with simple steamed broccoli. Nice for a change, but probably won't repeat.

This recipe will be a staple at my house. It's true you can't taste each individual ingredient but they blend together to make a flavor which is unmistakably Swedish meatballs. The Turkey makes a wonderful moist, soft meatball. I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble at any point. This gets 4 forks from me because it will satisfy the tastes of all the people in my life that just want good old fashioned home cooking, plus it feeds a ton of people. It is healthy and it is so inexpensive to make it's just knock me down ridiculous. Thank you for such an all around fabulous recipe.

Although I liked this recipe, I thought it was more of a stroganoff than a "swedish meatball" sauce...at least ones I've had before. I made with ground beef and omitted the nutmeg and allspice, added some red cayanne.

The turkey meatball stroganov is much flavorful than this recipe. The allspice & nutmeg mixed with turkey didn't do it for me.

Even with "dark meat" turkey, meatballs didn't give up enough drippings to flavor the sauce. I tried to jazz it up with some currant jelly and horseradish, but still rather bland.

I have made this twice now, and although it came out differently each time, it was always good. I don't care for all spice or nutmeg, I reduced some balsamic vinegar instead of sherry, yum! I also sauteed a mixture of mushrooms in...I don't care if they call it Swedish or not, it is just plain good!

This is for puckotina too: the emphasis is not on "Swedish Turkey" (which there are none as she pointed out) but on "Turkey Meatballs". The "Swedish" describes the way they meatballs are prepared and accompanied (the dill, the sauce with sour cream & the ligonberry preserves). Puckotina needs to loosen up a bit.

To Puckotina the Swede: If you are really from Sweden and know soooooo much about swedish meatballs, then why are you looking up recipes for them? Just to gripe about authenticity? I don't give a crap what you put in your meatballs in Sweden.

This recipe was okay, but I thought there was too much worchestire sauce - it seemed to overpower the nutmeg taste. Also, I'm all for a little low-cal low-fat dinner, but I needed more oil to brown the meatballs so they didn't stick to the pan. Overall, it wasn't too bad, but not a favorite.

I loved this dish, my husband on the other hand refused to eat it after he smelled the ground turkey browning. I didn`t notice any `off` smell but he did, I got him to taste a couple of the meatballs & he still didn`t like it, we don`t eat red meat so maybe it was all in his head. I have plenty in the freezer for me!

My husband was craving good old comfort food and this recipe sure did hit the spot!! I added a tiny bit more wooster but this dish was great. Worth the rolling of all the meatballs!

I like to replace the white bread with rye as the caraway seeds add a nice touch of flavor to the meatballs. A bit of fresh dill does not hurt. I agree with another reviewer that a bit of nutmeg in the sauce is welcome. All in all, if you make the meatballs in advance and freeze it is a very easy lowfat weekday meal.

Rating: 4
This was a very good dish with a lot of flavor. It does take a little work, but it's worth it. I doubled all the spices in the meatballs except for the allspice and doubled the sour cream in the sauce. I added a little nutmeg to the sauce as well. I did not get the 80 meatballs like it says you will get. I got more like 40 or so.

This was a good dish for a lowfat, low-cal, entree. I doubled the spices too- but I think it was a bit to much allspice,it gave a very overpowering flavor. Next time I will use the amount called for. I made this for my husband and I, and have lots of leftovers,which is good, but I don't think I would make it for company-not one of those dishes you get the oooohs and aaaahs over.

My family really liked this recipe, and I thought the cranberry sauce on top really made it! I was skeptical at first, but it works. I doubled the spices as suggested, but I made the sauce as the recipe indicated using low fat sour cream. One of the first times when my meatballs came out successfully, my traditional Italian ones are usually too mushy and stick to the pan, this is a great recipe for turkey! I will make this again, hubbie commented for than once how tasty it was!

Loved the meatballs but didn't care for the sauce with the egg noodles. I've made this a few times and the combination of spices really makes a bland pound of ground turkey very flavorful. Also, I have used about a pound of turkey and made a delicious meatloaf using the same spices. A great alternative to meat.

I make this recipe using turkey more often than the traditional mix of beef and pork. This dish works very well as a buffet item, it's impressive to guests since most people don't take the time to make their own meatballs. I double all of the spices, and I add salt and pepper to taste. Also, add the Worcestershire Sauce to taste. I also perfer regular sour cream in this recipe.

While I would not rate this dish as "company fare" it is a good everyday-type meal. I have just made it once so far and found it a bit bland. So, the next time I make it, I will try to spice it up a bit. Also I didn't get near the 80 turkey balls -- more like 45, but that really didn't matter.
