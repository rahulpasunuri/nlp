Delicious stuffing. After years of trying different recipes, this is finally a keeper! All my family loved this. Mine wasn't soggy, but I did leave it in the oven uncovered for longer than the recipe said.

Very easy. I found it crossed the line from moist to soggy. I actually rebaked it in a fresh pan to dry it out a bit. I would have added more bread and REALLY only drizzled the stock on. The veggies create a lot of moisture already.

Simply outstanding. I insist my husband make this every year at Thanksgiving.

Really yummy stuffing. The chestnuts add a really nice texture and sweetness. I think I'll keep looking for another recipe as it didn't have the creamy texture I was looking for.

YUM! This was the new hit of Thanksgiving, even for those who aren't stuffing fans. I used Minerve brand chestnuts (in a jar) and they worked just fine. Just another example of bacon making everything better (I used 2 extra pieces)! I made it the night before and cooked it the next day. This will definitely make a return appearance.

This truly is an ugly-muggly looking stuffing when it is done, but it has the flavor that transends it's lack of beauty! I love this stuffing recipe and think it is perfect. However, some of my family can't wrap their minds around bacon in the turkey stuffing! As En Vogue sings out.. "Free your mind and the rest will follow, be colorblind, dont be so shallow(before you read me you gotta learn how to see me).." So, ignore it's looks and savor the wonderful flavor!!

This is the best stuffing I have ever eaten, and all my guests agreed! It was a smash hit. It was easy to make, and the flavour combinations are divine. MAKE THIS!!

Absolutely wonderful! I actually followed the directions (only added a little extra liquid) and it came out delicious. Everyone had seconds. I used whole chestnuts and they were a lot of work but totally worth it.

Absolutely the best dressing I've ever tasted! Prepared it for Thanksgiving, my family loved it. Very moist and rich in flavor. (I used dry whole chestnuts in a jar which worked very well.)

I couldn't find chestnuts already prepared so it took a good bit of work and time to get them ready. It was worth it though. The flavors in this dish are great. Next time I will add more liquid.

I am making this again...for the 4th time! This is the best stuffing recipe, period. Delicious, I make it with the roast turkey with sage and sherried cider giblet gravy from the same issue (recipe is here). Definitely buy chestnuts already done. The first year I did the chestnuts myself and it was a pain in the you know what!

So delicious. I've made for several Thanksgivings now, always to rave reviews. I agree with other reviewers re the chestnuts. While I made it the first time with chestnuts that I shelled, I've made it every time since with the vacuum packed chestnuts. There is a difference in texture, but with everything else going on in this recipe, I don't think you miss it. Plus, if you're doing it for Thanksgiving, you should save yourself the hassle!

I have made this recipe since it first came out in 1996. It has become the one required dish on the Thanksgiving table. I have found that a good brand of chestnuts in a jar or vacuum-packed bag are just fine in this recipe, and are actually more reliable than buying fresh chestnuts.

I make this recipe every year. I love the sage fried in the bacon. I would definitely buy a jar of chestnuts - saves a lot of time and aggravation. My sister just requested the recipe to serve at her Thanksgiving this year. It is a very tasty recipe - you can't go wrong
