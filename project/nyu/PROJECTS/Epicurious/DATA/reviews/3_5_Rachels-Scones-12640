I made a few changes (but who doesn't on this site!), like substituting one cup of whole-wheat flour for AP, adding vanilla extract (1.5 tsp) and thick-cut oats (1/2 cup or so), and decreasing the currants (which was a mistake - I'd actually go up to a full cup next time). I also apparently can't read, and I added the full 1/4 cup + 2 tbs milk to the mix. Not a problem at all. The bigger problem is that I added the milk/egg/vanilla mixture before I crumbled in the butter. In the end, it didn't really matter. They turned out great!

I made these plain, using only butter, and adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the "dough". The texture was very good and the sugar I sprinkled on top gave the crust that little extra crunch I like. I would probably make them a bit thicker next time to get more of that soft, flaky interior and will definitely play around with adding blueberries or other fruit.

OK, I know I only rated this three forks - mostly because "a dish beyond compare" is pretty high praise. I made this recipe several times, and I, like some of the previous reviewers, vary my "add-ins". One year, when I was in college, I made several batches with different flavorings and gave them as a gift to my dad. They freeze easily and you can pop them in the toaster oven when you want to use them. I have made them with orange zest and brushed orange juice on top with a little cinnamon sugar, with chocolate chips inside, with currants inside, with a little bit of dried apples inside and cinnamon sugar on top, with walnuts...the list just goes on. This is a great recipe for beginning scone makers as you could drop them like biscuits or make a round and score it.

i made these for my friends but now that ive tried one, i might not share! They are everything I could ask for in a scone. I used all margerine instead of butter (its just what i had) and i put in craisins and walnuts. also i didn't do any of the pastry blender stuff, i just melted the margerine and dumped it in. worked fine. it was like making cookies, but for breakfast! I had to keep myself from eating the dough.

I make this with unsalted butter only - no margarine and decrease the oven temp to 400 and cook the scones for about 22 minutes. I also add slightly more sugar. I vary my additions - my family loves them with chocolate chips. This is a great basic scone recipe and if I've made it once since the first time I saw it, I've made it 50 times.

Simple and so easy. One bowl! I love it. Brilliant with chopped dried cranberries to replace the currants.

I soaked the raisens in warm water while I was making the dough (at the advise of a previous viewer) and they turned out wonderful. I had to take them out early - for a total baking time of approx. 10 minutes.

instead of currants, i use 1 cup of raisans. to eliminate 'dust' that comes from packaged raisans (and that you can taste in the finished product) and to ensure that they do not become hard in the baking process, i soak them in water for 10-20 min and drain them and repeat this 2-3 times before using them. i also divide the dough in two parts, shape them into rectangles and cut the scones into triangles--less clean-up. this makes 12 scones. i've made these scones this way a dozen time now, and they've been perfect each time.

I picked this recipe because I was looking for something I could make with what I had handy (no buttermilk or cream in the house), but I was very happy with the outcome. I halved the recipe for two people, used all butter, mixed it in the food processor, and then stirred in raisins and walnuts instead of currants. I also patted them by hand instead of rolling out and cutting. The raisins got a bit hard, as raisins will-- next time I might try walnuts and orange zest. Great texture.

I had some blackberries and over-ripe peaches that I wanted to use in this recipe. I mixed the cut up peaches into the batter and spooned mounds onto the cookie sheet since they made the batter very sticky. With the blackberries, since they are so fragile, I rolled out dough 1/4 inch thick, cut rounds, and placed some blackberries on top. Then I placed another 1/4 inch round on top and gently pinched the edges. Both versions turned out wonderfully!

A nice, classic scone. I left out the currants and used all butter. Topped them with homemade blackberry & lime jam. Yum! These would be even better with devonshire cream and jam.

A nice basic scone. Next timeI make it, I may doll it up a bit (this time I just made raisin scones). Used buttermilk, and all butter (instead of margine- who likes that stuff!)

I must have been half asleep when I made this, because I used 1/2 CUP of each kind of shortening (butter and margarine), rather than 1/2 STICK (1/4 C. each). Couldn't figure out why they didn't rise all that much. Funny thing is, they were still delicious - we each ate three of them! I brushed them with milk and sprinkled some granulated sugar on them before baking. I will definitely make these again, and I might even go so far as to use the correct amounts of shortening next time.

I wasn't completely taken with this recipe--it seemed a bit bland for my tastes. I have to admit I was comparing it with the Ginger Scone recipe and there is simply no comparison.

These are really nice scones. theyre light and flaky as a scone should be, the only criticism i have is theyre a bit flat. id maybe roll them out thicker, and bake them for longer on a slightly lower heat. aside from that theyre delicious.

I made these scones about 12 minutes ago and just tasted the first one- and it is pretty good- it's not amazing- and I was looking for amazing scones like the ones I used to have in france- I thought substituting buttermilk would make a difference but it didn't. They baked quickly too- in about 9 minutes- I used all butter and I used half refined sugar and half granulated brown sugar- and cranberries instead of currants- they flavor is good and the texture is good- but these are not as wow as I had thought they might be-- oh well- I'll keep looking for the perfect scone recipe...

I made these scones for brunch this A.M. and the family really liked them. The dough was very moist; I used plenty of bench flour but the results were great. I baked them for 14 minutes which was fine but next time I'll check them at 12 - 13 minutes. Very good!

These scones are quite easy! They make a great afternoon tea snack...good even without the currants.

I made these for a breakfast this morning and recieved rave reviews. I substituted dried cherries for the currants and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract in with the eggs. Wonderfully easy and delicious. I will definately make these again!

A Sunday brunch favourite with my husband and I. Instead of currants I've used barberries and sometimes whatever dried fruit/berries I've had around. I've also shaped them into the "classic" wedges. And used just butter instead of half butter half margarine. A perennial favourite!

Susannah - your recipe is wonderful. As an Andover native myself, your name is quite prominent...The scones were delicious...thank you for sharing it with us.

With adjustment, this has become my favorite scone recipe. I needed a bit of extra milk to get dough to form a ball. Also, had to reduce temp to 400 and bake for only 12 minutes. I used golden raisins (no currants on hand) and they were fab--flakey and rich--very classic.

You can't go wrong with this recipe! I've used half and half in place of milk and it turns out super everytime.

I loved this recipe! I'm a college student so my pantry is somewhat bare; consequently, I didn't have any currants. I omitted them and added some mandarin zest and about a tablespoon of orange juice and the scones were delicious! I also added a sprinkling of turbinado sugar and cinnamon to the top.

I loved this recipe it was incredibly light. What I did though was I ommited the currant and instead added some fresh mint and lavendar and that made it even more flavorful

I left out the currants and it still turned out delicious. I also prepped the ingredients ahead of time like another reviewer suggested and made them the following morning. It's a bit buttery for my taste however so next time I'll go easy on the butter.

I made this recipe for my three small step-sons and the 10-year-old said "I think I died and went to Deb's kitchen" Everyone loved these scones.

I also made these scones recently for a baby shower and they were excellent, served with homemade jam. I used all butter and left out the currants because I wanted a completely plain scone. These definitely fit my idea of a classic, plain, light scone. Not like the gigantic multiflavoured doorstoppers that poor scones seem to be morphing into.

These scones got rave reviews at a baby shower recently. Slightly lighter and flakier than the average scone. I omitted the currants and added chocolate chips. Everyone loved that!

My husband loves scones and he described these scones as perfect. I combined the dry ingredients a day ahead and made them fresh on a Sunday morning. Very easy; light and sweet.

I just love these scones. Easy to make and so delicious. I´ve just been to England and had scones at afternoon tea a few times, but none of the scones tasted as good as these. Love them. P.S.: I left out the currants as well.

Very quick and flaky. I made them for breakfast in less than 45 minutes. I left out the currants as I had none in the house. Perfect with plum jam.
