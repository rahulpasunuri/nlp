I have made these for years now and although they may discolor they never go bad. One way I use them often is to mash a piece with a fork to a paste then mash some butter with it and use it on cooked veggies. Try it!

Preservationist the development of conditions where harmful bacterial and fungal growth is highly inhibited if not made impossible. The high concentration of salt and acid preclude the growth of the nasties. The sterilization and thought scrubbing is to remove starter bugs. This is much higher in salt than commercial salt dried cod. In that case the low moisture content helps keep the baddies from growing and in this case the high acid and sugar content of lemon juice with the salt all help.

I have been making preserved lemons for years and have never had any problem with them going bad. With all the salt in them I thin it is almost impossible for them to go off. I sterilize the jars first, always. Then I keep them on the shelf, never in the fridge. I often have many jars on the go. I find the older they get, the better they are. After about a year they are so soft they turn to a paste when pressed with a knife. Perfect for adding to aioli!! I've never tried making them with spices before but will give it a go next time. It sounds delicious!

If you use salt with iodine in it, it will ferment the lemons. A kosher or sea salt is what should be used in this recipe (or in any canning that involves salt really).

In college I came across a copy of Ms. Wolfert's book. I made this preserved lemon recipe several times and never had any problems with the lemons going bad. I just followed the directions given in the recipe, including on sterilizing the jar. Maybe I just got lucky?

if the jars are not sealed in the conventional canning method (water bath, etc) how safe is the product? I worry about serving it to guests - how would I know if it has gone bad? Or is that even possible given the amount of salt? I have never seen a recipe that talks about the science of food safety for preserved lemons. I made them once, kept the jar refrigerated the whole time but only used them once or twice before panic set in and I threw them away. Any help would be appreciated.

I just need some help. After you've squished the lemons in the mason jar, do you just put on the lid and band or does it have to "pop", like when you can tomatoes?

I was very excited when I made this, however, when the time came to use the lemons (4 weeks later), it had fermented. Had to trash the whole thing. Not sure what happened since I followed the recipe exactly as indicated and made sure the jar was sealed.

A great way to use the ton of lemons from my lemon tree.

If anything edible is worth waiting 30 days for, this is it!
