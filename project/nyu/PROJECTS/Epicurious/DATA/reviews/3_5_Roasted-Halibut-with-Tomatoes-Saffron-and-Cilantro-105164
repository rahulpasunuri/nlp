This is such an easy dish to make and it comes out so tasty. I did add a bit more saffron as suggested by another chef and since my family likes the flavor it was needed. It did take about 20 minutes to cook the fish because of the thickness of the fillet. Definately a keeper and a receipe to make again and again. My family wanted to give it a 3 1/2 forks!

This recipe has become one of our standards when halibut is in season and the tomatoes are very fresh and local. We serve it with steamed fingerling potatoes - excellent!

Light and flavorful. Too much olive oil; get by with 1/3 C. Delish aroma and color but did not necessarily translate into flavor. The basil didn't really come through after baking in a hot oven. Also, it took about 20 minutes to cook; not 10 minutes. Would make it again with a few tweaks.

Based on the reviews, I was a little disappointed. I made it exactly as stated, and cooked it for the extra 8 minutes (it could have used an additional 12-15 minutes in my oven, I think). I did not think that the basil, cilantro and saffron flavors came through. Perhaps I should have sprinkled some extra herbs on just before serving, and increased the amount of saffron. However, it was very pretty on the plate.

I have made this delicious recipe many times. I like it better when it has mushrooms. It is great to make for entertaining as you can have it prepped in your baking dish and pop it in the oven while you visit. Don't cut back on the tomatoes, they add to the sauce. The better the tomato, the better the dish.

This was excellent. I used tilapia, red wine vinegar and a bit of garlic powder - followed the recipe otherwise. I reduced for just my husband and I but I would make again for a dinner party. Delicious!

Wonderful summer recipe! Fresh tomatoes from the garden, saffron, and fresh herbs all add up to a delightful meal. I served the meal with a rice pilaf and garden salad. Do not forget a good sour dough bread to mop up all the delicious juices with.

Fantastic! The saffron imparts such an unusual, yet simple flavor. I upped the herbs as well and used only grape tomatoes as I could not find yellows. Served with whole wheat orzo with lemon juice and olive oil. I would defintiely make this for a dinner group. Very easy and beautiful!

This recipe was really delicious and made the halibut so tender. Not to mention it smelt delicous! I served it with risotto and it was the perfect compliment.

WHAT a lovely dish! Fabulous. I used fresh vine-ripened tomatoes cubed large, and it was very, very nice. Heavied up on fresh herbs a bit, and it was great...not too heavy at all. Cook for an extra 8 minutes, but that's the only change to the method. As per another reviewer, serve with orzo and roasted asparagus. made for a truly great dinner. I tried this with a really great Chenin Blanc. What a fantastic pairing!

Used the recipe as a guide since I had a lot less fish. Guestimated all of the ingredients. Had to put the fish back in after 10 minutes because it was raw in the center (added 8 minutes). It was a very delicious and tender dish. Served it over linguini and will make it again.

This was one of the most delicious recipes and so easy to prepare!! I can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was great, although I used way more cilantro and basil than the recipe called for so it was much more herby. I also had to cook the fish for much longer than indicated. Nevertheless, it was an elegant meal, would definitely try it again.

Excellent recipe. I too cut down on the tomatoes, way down. And I had some mushrooms that needed to be used up and they turned out good too. I do think I will leave out the cilantro next time. I think it's a little out of place in the recipe.

I have made this several times. It is so easy and flavorful. Interesting wine suggestion from an earlier review. Instead of Chardonay we paired this with Orvieto Classico for the acidity, too.

Made this last night for husband and myself using a fine piece of fresh tuna - about 1.5 inches thick. Halved the tomatoes and followed the rest of the recipe for the herb/sauce mixture. Baked at 400 for 30 minutes and came out great. The herbs and tomatoes were a perfect combination and nicely picked up by the tuna. Next time I will bake only for 20 minutes - which I hope will result in pink the middle tuna.

This recipe is phenomenal! I have made it several times with heirloom tomatoes from my garden, it's a great recipe for the end-of-summer abundance. I serve it over cous cous for and elegant and simple pairing.

It takes a bit longer than 10 minutes. Great easy summer recipe, though sometimes people see saffron in a dish and want to make every other side dish "saffronized". Delicate flavors people and not overboard decadence. As a wannabe oneologist, I served this with savignon blanc which pairs much better with the tomato (pinot gris would work too)than chardonnay. Just because there is white meat involved doesn't always mean go with the chard. To sweet and not enough acidity to counterbalance the tomato/cilantro/vinegar thing going on. Citrus wine, not buttercream.

This recioe is easy and delicious. I used canned chopped tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes, and hve tried it with halibut and Chilean sea bass. Both came out excellently. The bass was done for a large group and it was a resounding success. Will make this over and over again.

Thanks to one of the early reviews I avoided the "boiled tomato flavor" problem by putting 1 tablespoon of the "green glop" on each piece of halibut (2) and tossing the rest of the dressing with tomatoes and roasting them 20 minutes at 400 before adding the halibut and a little white wine, this way the tomatoes are the best part. The halibut is very moist almost fluffy. I served this over saffron risotto. It was beautiful but the fish needs lots of s&p or it's too flavorless. I would double the dressing for 8 people.

Have made this several times. It is great and the saffron adds a great flavor. I used saffron powder instead of threads and used a little less than 1/8 tsp which was fine. There are too many red tomatoes. Don't think the plum add much. I would do 2 or three different colored tomatoes for the presentation.

This is a fabulous dish prepared with either Alaskan halibut or orange roughy. I use less fish (we're only two) with the full amount of the marinade/green glop called for in the recipe. I have increased slightly the amount of saffron and I am generous with the basil and the cilantro. I also add finely slivered slices of supersweet white onion around the perimeter of the pan. The fish takes a bit longer to cook than in the recipe, but always comes out super moist and flavorful (perhaps because I use the full amount of marinade for less fish). This is a very healthy way to prepare fish.

I made this with fewer tomatoes than it called for, so that might have changed things a bit... But the tomatoes I did use weren't a problem--they were wonderfully sweet and tasty--it was the flavorlessness of the fish that disappointed me. It looked lovely and I expected it to be bursting with yummy flavors from the marinade, but it wasn't. I might try it again, but would modify the dressing to give it more zip.

Can't really get all those tomatoes during winter. But this still worked well with canned tomatoes (1 lb for 1 lb of halibut), dried basil, and non-white balsamic vinegar.

Light, flavorful, and easy to prepare -- a real pleasure and well received by all. I agree with other comments about scaling back slightly on the tomatoes, favoring the mix of yellow and red cherries over the plum. Followed another reviewer's suggestion of Orzo & Asparagus as good complements, and was pleased with the results.

I made this dish for dinner guests and they loved it, it was a nice light meal. I used Tilapia instead of Halibut..I do not recommend the Tilapia because it does not stay together as well. Over all a nice dish.

Rating: 3
This has become a regular dish for us - a few changes to recommend - too many tomatoes as is - I negate the plum and do a cup or so of a red/yellow cherry mix - I add steamed aspargus (aldente) - serve over orzo - I'm not shy with the s&p either.

This was an excellent recipe for the halibut I had purchased. Had to use home-canned tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes but had fresh plum tomatoes available for the remainder of recipe. Served over jasmine rice. Had to use a spoon to make sure we didn't leave any juice behind.

Very nice summer dish which I paired with the Saffron Almond Rice. Nice flavors but not too complex. I cooked the fish an extra 5 minutes and it was perfect!

Basil is always great w/ tomatoes, and since it's in the suace too, i would try using some with the tomatoes too.

I substitued tilapia, and it was spellbinding. If there was a way to make the tomatoes a little tastier, I would give it a 4.

Yum -- very simple and lots of flavor. The tanginess of the dressing suits the halibut well. Even my fish-fearful boyfriend gobbled this one right up! I tried this because we were looking for low-fat entrees, but I would happily eat this again anytime whether we were watching our calories or not.

No, it isn't a show stopper. But it's quick, EASY and has pretty complex flavors for something you can whip up on a weeknight when you don't have much time. I've made it over and over...even for last minute company. A keeper/

This recipe was wonderfully easy, fresh and delicious. For two servings I used 3 large plum tomatoes and one yellow one, omitting the seeds. I'd never heard of white balsamic so used the usual Modena variety. Wonderful saffron flavor. My husband says it's a keeper. I think so too.

I was very disappointed, esp. after all the other great reviews. The dressing, while nice, didn't do much to make an impact on the halibut, which is somewhat bland and meaty as is. The color didn't absorb much, and the color and the taste were drowned out by what tasted like boiled tomatoes. The dressing might be nice on a sauteed or grilled halibut served over a tomato coulis, but this recipe as is didn't work at all for me.

I purchased halibut at Costco and was not sure how I was going to prepare it. I found this recipe but did not have all the ingredients on hand, so I improvised and it turned out great. I used canned chopped tomatoes, white grapes instead of red, shallots instead of green onions, parsley instead of cilantro. Yummy and easy!

This is a great (and easy) dinner party recipe. If you can't find the yellow tomatoes, don't worry. I just added a chopped big yellow tomatoes, but don't think it would have mattered if I just increased the amount of red tomato. The tomatoes need more roasting time before adding the fish.

This was excellent, easy and presentable. I used saffron powder instead of the threads and it was delicious. Very impressive for company. I prepared everything before company arrived and put it in the oven after apps. Enjoy.
