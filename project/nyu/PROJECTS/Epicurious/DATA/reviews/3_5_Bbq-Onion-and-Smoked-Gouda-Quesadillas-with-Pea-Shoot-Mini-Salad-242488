This recipe was very tasty and perfect for a filling yet light weekday dinner. Even my carnivore husband loved it and found it satisfying. Pea shoot salad added some zip.

I edited this recipe a bit and it was fantastic. First, to make it healthier and higher fiber, I used sprouted organic whole grain tortillas from Whole Foods. Since I'm a vegetarian, I also added Morning Star "chicken" strips, which are vegan. I cooked them with the onions. Everything was delicious, and quite healthy. I'd highly recommend trying it, especially if you're vegan/vegetarian and miss BBQ chicken!

Normally, I'm a big ol' carnivore....but these were VERY tasty. Nice change of pace.

Divine! Served this as an appetizer & my guests divoured it. I served the quesadillas over the bed of pea shoots & it looked really pretty. We ate them outside on a moderately humid eve & they turned soggy pretty fast. Otherwise, flavorful & will definitely serve again!

Easy enough for my husband to make and we loved the mixture of flavors and textures.

The smoked gouda makes this recipe a little too sweet for my taste. Will make again with a different cheese, and also with some peppers for more flavor and texture.

I added some shredded chicken and this was excellent. Loved it.

I only made the quesadillas, and they were really good. The cheese I used was perhaps a little too smokey, and I reduced the BBQ sauce (a good move!) The flavors blended very well, and I will probably make this again. It seems great for kids too.

I only made the quesadillas and they were quite nice and were fabulously easy to prepare. I went heavy on the onions (1.5 lbs), used plenty of cilantro and used a honey BBQ sauce. The extra onions helped to keep the quesadillas from merely being a big slice of cheese. Overall, tasty and easy.

Ah... the dramas in the review tab. Y'all should stop fussing and cook already!

Easy to make. I only made the quesadillas and used my George Foreman grill instead of heating them on the skillet and then baking them. The bbq, gouda, and cilantro made for an interesting flavor combination which I like -- but I don't think has mass appeal (so I won't be making this for guests).

Not Bad

Simple and Yummy! I had a fresh avocado so opted for an avocado spread instead of BBQ sauce.

I enjoyed this. Very simple and tasty. Great eaten outside on a beautiful day.

I hate it when a recipe calls for purchased barbecue sauce without giving us a clue as to what kind. Kansas City bbq is smokey, southern bbq is vinegary. St Louis style is sweet. I makes a difference!

Excellent recipe for a quick and filling snack. I used mature Gouda cheese which was fine. Highly recommend it.

the interplay of the flavors is impressive when considering the quickness and ease of the meal.

I only made the quesadillas, not the salad. The only change I made to the quesadillas was to make 5 rather than 4 of them (since I had a package of 10 tortillas). There was still plenty of filling to go around. They were good, but the smokey flavor from the combination of the BBQ sauce and the smoked cheese was a little overwhelming. I might try a milder BBQ sauce and maybe a less strongly flavored cheese, or just less cheese, if I make this again.
