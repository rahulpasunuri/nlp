This is such a great easy recipe for a side salad. I did a couple things differently by accident...I added a table spoon of dijon so added more honey then too. It was still a fantastic dressing that I would use for all sorts of things. My peppers were out of a jar which might have added to the tang...I also added crumbled goat cheese which added a very nice creamyness. I would also add fresh slices of red pepper and red onion...I think that would add a nice crunch/crispness.

Nice salad and very easy to make. I added garlic croutons (from TJ's) and they were too strong for the salad. A good light side salad.

This is a great, simple salad. And my husband, who does not normally like bell peppers, really liked them this way.

I used Trader Joe's frozen roasted peppers, heated them for about 8 minutes at 350 and peeled them. Very tasty and simple salad.

I love spinach and roasted red peppers, but with the honey-balsamic dressing, I found the whole thing too sweet for a dinner salad. Balsamic vinegar already has a sweetness to it, then with the honey...even when I added more Dijon - that didn't cut the sweetness. I added more salt, still too sweet. But the peppers and spinach were a nice combination.

I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have any balsamic. The salad was a hit and my husband begs me to make it.

I thought this salad was wonderful! I used half spinach and half mesclun greens for more color. Also added toasted pine nuts.

I made this because my husband loves spinach and roasted red peppers. He didn't like it and wouldn't even eat it. He usually eats everything I make. I thought it was just ok.

Yum. The dressing is good on other stuff, too.

Easy, gorgeous, and terrific. I used orange bell peppers instead of red, which gave the salad sweet overtones. I also marinated the roasted peppers in the dressing.

Very nice, basic dressing. Also nice with purple onion.I used romaine instead of spinach (too lazy to wash the latter) and it was still very good. Be sure to add the salt before the oil or else it won't dissolve properly.

I roasted the peppers in a foil lined baking dish and used the foil to tent and steam the peppers. Soooo easy and delicious!! I loved this salad, and I liked the fact I didn't have to use comercial dressing. A keeper!!

This salad was so easy to prepare and the colors were beautiful. I marinated the red peppers in the dressing for about an hour then tossed it all together. Yummy!

Really great, although it really needed the feta cheese. It added that needed zip. I Served it with some heavy bread along with some balsamic and olive oil for dipping. My guests loved it!

I warmed the dressing slightly and added toasted sliced almonds and goat cheese rolled in a thin coating of crushed black pepper. It tasted exactly like my favorite salad from my favorite restaurant (which they have now removed from their menu). Delicious.

I took the suggestion from the cook from Pittsburgh and added roasted eggplant, zucchini and feta cheese. I accidently marinated the veggies in the dressing overnight. When I realize this I drained the veggies, saving the dressing, and tossed them with the spinach. It turned out great anyways. There was enough dressing on the veggies that it got on the spinach

I added roasted/grilled eggplant, zucchini, fennel, and turnips to the roasted red and yellow peppers. I placed the spinach in the bottom of the bowl and pinwheeled the veggies around on top. In the middle I added a mound of feta cheese. It was the hit of the party. I was the only person to not have left-overs in their bowl!
