I rated this one a two just because I didn't thnk it was really special, although it's a great dish. I still would make it again - I'm sure of it. By the way, I've used this exact same technique with asparagus (peeled), and with green beans. Sometimes I add a lilttle lemon zest if I have it available - just to freshen it up, or as one reviewer suggested, a little parmesan. It's so easy my wife lets me make it :-)

I'm italian and when I make sicilan-style broccoli I boil as suggested and then instead of olive oil I saute the garlic in butter with fresh lemon juice (about half a lemon) and also red pepper flakes. Before I serve, I sprinkle the broccoli with fresh parmesean cheese. Reeeally good this way.

I found this dish was too bland for us. Maybe good for kids. I added thickly sliced mushrooms when sauteing the garlic, but had to add some seasoning salt at the end. Maybe try a few red pepper flakes? Overall, a good dish.

This is a delicious and so very easy recipe for broccoli! It also includes the very healthful olive oil and garlic, and I will serve it often, for family meals, but it's a great way to fix broccoli for company, too. You can count on James Beard for lovely ways to cook things!
