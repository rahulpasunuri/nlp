I just made the cinnamon ice cream as an accompaniment for apple pie. It was outstanding - the vanilla bean and cinnamon stick really infused the ice cream with an amazing flavor, and the consistency was also wonderful - very creamy and custard-like. Do note that as written, the recipe does not make a very large quantity - next time I will double it. Definitely a keeper!!!

I made just the cinnamon ice cream to go with pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. It was amazing! A new tradition has begun in my family.

I made the cinnamon ice cream and we thought it was fantastic. I was a little nervous about adding the hot cream mixture to the egg yolk mixture, but it went fine. Served it with warm brownies...everyone loved it. Recipe made enough for a small scoop for 10 people plus a little left over.

I threw in a little more powdered cocoa that required, and it made the ice cream too chocolatey, if there is such a thing. The tequila wasn't noticeable, but it kept the ice cream from freezing in the ice cream maker. I just put it in the freezer, but it never did get very hard.

I thought this dessert was very good, it was well recieved. The chocolate icecream has a consistancy similar to Godiva Chocolate Raspberry Truffle icecream-very good but the Cinnamon icecream is really exceptional and is well worth making on it's own-would be great with apple pie.

I only made the cinnamon ice cream --to go on apple pie. I didn't have rum, so I used Calvados. It was unbelievable.

I doubled this because I was making it for more people.. added a little more sugar ...it was wonderful! My husband said "maybe the best I've ever tasted!"
