Thanks for the recipe. I'd like to share another recipe using glazed chestnuts with scallops: http://www.histoiresucree.com/recipes/scallops.html Quite a treat!

Delicious! If "Sortilege" liqueur is too sweet to your taste, try the other option of mixing 1/2 C (not 1/4 C) whiskey w/1T maple syrup. Serve with a Leg of Lamb and a red Zinfandel from California. It's also a very nice option for Easter, or just to celebrate something.

This dish was quite lovely, easy to make and delicious. I used the frozen haricots verts from Trader Joes and cooked them the day before. I also made the chestnut mixture the day before. Everything went together quite easily on Christmas Day. I used the grade B maple syrup as it has a more pronounced maple flavor.

Sorry to disagree with the other cooks: although I followed the instructions to a tee, my family did not like the sweet taste of green beans (haricots verts - in French) and the chestnuts were just bland and starchy. All in all this recipe was BLAH. Save the maple syrup for some pancakes!

Really very simple, and a good dish to make in advance. I suppose I committed a faux pas by using steamed instead of roasted chestnuts, but no one complained, quite the opposite in fact.

totally excellent in every way, and a breeze to make to boot. I used more maple syrup than required, about 1 tbsp more, to make a truer glaze.. and I used reg. green beans sted haricots verts. Christmas dinner guests went nuts, and even I couldn't criticize myself. ps I am not a very experienced cook, so this is truly foolproof. oh -- b-grade maple syrup made a great difference!

great do-ahead recipe. I added 1/2 lb of thick cut slices bacon, sliced again into little 1/4 pieces, fried until crisp and added at end along with chestnuts.
