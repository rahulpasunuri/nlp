This is my go-to recipe for hummus. I like to double the chipotles, use just 1 teaspoon of cumin, add some lemon zest, and substitute roasted red peppers for the pimento. Yummy!

Rating: 3
This was pretty good, but it was much darker than in the picture -- and with the chipotles, I do not see how it could be anything but orange-ish. So it looked a little weird. Glad I used the chickpeas and garnish so people would know what it was.

Very good. If I'm not careful I'll eat the whole thing!! I added some red pepper flakes because I like it a bit more spicy but other than that it's awesome goodness :)

this was surprisingly good - and really easy. i probably tripled the chipotle and it still wasn't too hot. was a bit nervous about the pimientos - only added half the jar - but next time i'll probably add the whole 4 oz.

I love hummus, and this is one of my favorites. I didn't have any pimientos, but I added 1/2 avacado. It went great with the chipotle peppers, cilantro, and cumin. Next time I make this dish, I will have pimientos to add. I'm sure it makes the dip even more delicious.

Excellent recipie! I forgot the cilantro and it was still great! I served it with sliced cucumber and yellow and red bell pepper. I also made it as a traditional hummus w/o the chilies and added more garlic. I think 5-6 cloves. This one is a keeper.

I usually love smoky foods, but this smoky recipe just didn't do it for me. It just wasn't anything spectacular. I probably won't be making this again.

I give this a thumbs up. I've made it several times, always to great praise. I'm allergic to chick peas, so I use cannellini beans and I add extra chipotle and adobo to give it more kick. It is certainly a nice deviation from standard hummus.

Rating: 4
I have made this hummus several times and I have to say its probably my favorite. After craving the hummus at whole foods, I had decided it was time to make my own. I have always left out the pimentos and have used the lime over the lemon as others have suggested. Try with Lundberg's sea salt sesame rice chips. Fantastic.

Rating: 2
This recipe is good but not spectacular. Definitely a change from the standard hummus that everyone serves at gatherings. I triped the amount of chipotle I used, I could barely taste it when I made it according to the directions. It definitely has a kick now!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent alternative to the ubiquitous hummus! I added a little extra adobo sauce from the can of chipotle chiles to give it extra smokiness. Served it with plain pita chips and everyone loved it!

I just love this appetizer. It's always a hit when I serve it. I also like that it's no fat and no cholesterol. Plus this maakes it a safe dish to carry to a picnic. Lastly, I pride myself on cooking from scratch but I couldn't tell the difference when I used the store bought hummus.

Rating: 4
Halved the recipe, doubled the garlic and cumin and used lime juice as others suggested. No pimento. Half of the recipe was plenty. Fabulous flavour - I wasn't sure because I don't like 'smokey' flavour but it enhanced the overall flavour of the hummus without being overpowering. Will be deleting my other hummus recipe and using this from now on. Gave four forks for great result combined with simplicity and ability to make in advance.

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh! This is the most awesome hummus I have ever had. It is absolutely essential to make it from scratch, rather than using store bought hummus. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the cumin and garlic and used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I didn't bother with the pimento nor did I have a red pepper. I used more cilantro also. EXCELLENT!

I made this for a barbecue last week and it was a huge hit, very easy to make, delicious. Although I added a couple of extra chipotles for a little more heat.

Rating: 2
Warning - this recipe makes about 2 1/2 cups of hummus when all is said and done. I thought it was good and I enjoyed it, but my guests ignored it. I had lots left over which I spread on whole wheat tortillas with roasted veggies for lunch for the rest of the week. Still barely made a dent.

This was a great recipe. I made it for a birthday party and all of the guests loved it. I had several requests for the recipe. I used the liquid for the garbanzo beans instead of the water. I will make this recipe again

Rating: 3
This was a big hit at a summer party. I upped the garlic and didn't reserve any garbanzos, instead adding some toasted pine nuts. I made my own pita chips by splitting then spraying the pitas with olive oil, and sprinking them with garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, and sea salt.

This was my first try at making hummus, and my friends seemed to be pretty impressed! The cilantro is what makes this recipe, in my opinion. It gives it a super fresh taste. I served it with pita chips and carrots.

Made this for a graduation party and it was a hit - even for folks who don't usually like hummus. Omitted the cilantro and the pimientos. Doubled the garlic, but not roasted. Easy to make and a real winner.

I love this tasty recipe. I also use the bean broth instead of the water;lime instead of lemon; no pimentos; and extra garlic, chipoltles, cumin and cilantro. Great healthy snack.

Rating: 4
Obviously hummus with the addition of chipotle and pimento will not be "authentic". However, this is without doubt the best hummus I have ever had or made. I use bean liquid instead of water, add aditional garlic, double the cumin and serve with flatbread that has been brushed with garlic oil before toasting.

Rating: 3
Very good hummus. Next time, I will not use pimiento, since it gives it a decidedly American flavor, not authentic. I will also put in a lot more garlic and extra chipotles. Cilantro isn't necessary, either.

Rating: 4
This is one of the BEST hummus recipes! The only thing I do that isn't in the recipe is to toast and grind the cumin seeds as I feel it adds more of a smokey depth. I make pita chips with a cumin, paprika (hungarian), kosher salt, pepper and olive oil mixture then bake. Fabulous! Also wonderful with vegies.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful recipe. I caught my fiance eating it out of the container with a spoon! It's great with raw vegetables and also with whole wheat tortillas. You can put the cilantro in the food processor with everthing else, ditto the red peppers instead of adding them at the end. About storing chipotle peppers: I keep them in tightly covered plastic container in the fridge and they last forever. I've never had them go bad. I think the pepper has antibacterial qualities.

Rating: 3
I make this recipe all the time--it's great. I like to use flat-leaf parsley instead of cilantro, and sometimes I use both. I usually cut the recipe in half because the full recipe makes way too much for just me and my family. Roasted garlic makes a nice addition too.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added a little extra lemon juice and a little salt. I made pita chips to go with it. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I'd give this 3.5 forks - very tasty (and quick to put together!). Mine was pretty spicy(we like it that way), but I didn't really measure the chipotle - just guesstimated and tossed it in. Try this recipe!

I have made this many times and it is always a hit. I add more chipotles as we like it spicy and it also freezes quite well. It does make a lot for a small group. Very easy and I always have the ingredients on hand which is a bonus.

This was a definite hit at my party--people were raving about it. It's the kind of recipe you want to serve. I took another person's recommendation and reserved some of the water from the garbanzo beans, which intensified the flavor. The presentation is excellent as well, with the hummus speckled with the red of the pimentos and the green of the cilantro. Definite winner!

I made this dip as part of a New Year's Appitizer party and it went over really well. I made the recipe using a roasted red pepper as suggested, and accidently forgot the cilantro in the finish. It was wonderful served with homemade garlic-oil flavored pita chips. There were many appitizers to choose from on the table, but this was the only one that was finished!

Very good! Interesting choice of flavors for hummus.

Can't bring myself to rate 4 forks for a hummus recipe but I will DEFINITELY say that this is THE best hummus I've ever had. Loved the addition of chipotle in adobo. I roasted a red pepper and used it in place of pimientos. Sub'd roasted garlic for minced, and as suggested by an earlier reviewer I also replaced water with liquid from garbanzos. Added slightly more garlic infused olive oil then called for. I believe that this would be delicious spread on just about anything. Middle East/Latin fusion. LOVED IT!

Rating: 3
Oh, this was so yummy! Not wanting to bother with garlic bagel chips, I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and increased the cumin to 2t. Garnishing with cilantro leaves and extra pimientos made a very colorful presentation. I'm going to remember this recipe to bring to parties. [Notes from second time: I would avoid adding the water until everything except the pimientos have been pureed, and substitute the liquid from the canned chickpeas instead. I found the hummus was a little thin. Also, if you use pimientos in water instead of oil, you should reduce the water further, and possibly the lemon juice as well. For the garnish, layer the cilantro sprigs first, then the pimientos, and then the chickpeas. I would reserve only 2 T chickpeas, although this does of course depend on the shape of the containers you use.]

I substitute italian parsley for cilantro as I find the cilantro makes it taste soapy. Use the juice of a whole lemon and add extra garlic and chipotle and serve with pita bread.

It was really delicious, I upped the garlic and chipotle and used lime juice. I think the pimentos and cilantro made the dish look festive and more appealing than regular hummus. The bagel chips were a great addition and I plan to use them instead of pita for all my hummus recipes from now on. I'd like to use this recipe with fish tacos or mexican tortas (sandwich).

I love hummus and chipotles and the two put together sounded terrific. Unfortunately, it sounded better than it tasted. I didn't care much for it, and judging from the leftovers, the guests at the party to which I took it didn't care much for it either. Maybe I should try using purchased hummus instead of making it according to the recipe.

Actually, I bought garlic hummus and added the other ingredients, and toasted pita with cumin seeds. Turned out great...everyone raved.

I loved the spiciness of this recipe. It kind of reminded me of spicy refried beans. I served it to a couple of friends who are hummus fans, one of which is a vegetarian, and got rave reviews. I will definitely make this again. It's nice to have on hand for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I originally served it on toasted pita, but it works great rolled up in a flour tortilla too!

I hate to be the lone dissenting voice here but I was not wowed by this recipe. I've made hummus many times in the past from a few different recipes and this one just didn't compare with my regular one. And I'm not sure why, just can't put my finger on it. Don't misunderstand, my guests enjoyed it but it isn't a recipe that I will repeat. However, loved the garlic bagel chips as an accompaniment. I will definitely use those with my favorite hummus recipe.

This is a really tasty variation on hummus. I've made it many times, and each time I do, someone inevitable asks for the recipe. We like to serve it with oven-toasted pita bread--we cut whole wheat pita into cracker-sized pieces and put it in a 375 degree oven for 5-7 minutes.

Excellent hummus recipe. My husband LOVES roasted chipotles so this was right up his ally. I changed the recipe a bit. Didn't add the pimentos or the cilantro. Think both of those are nasty! The hummus was excellent without them...

It was even better the next day. I doubled the cumin. The bagel chips were OK but I really liked it with the super seedy crackers from the same company that makes the bagel crisps (Burns & Ricker) Crispini either sesame garlic or seeds & spices. Yummy

Saving leftover chipotles is easy. Place remains in a small container and add a thin layer of olive oil or vegetable over the chipotles. Put lid on and keep refrigerated. Chipotles will last a few months or longer this way.

Freezing chipotle peppers: Place a piece of plastic wrap on a plate. Place 1 pepper + a bit of sauce on plate until all are used. Cover with plastic wrap, freeze. When frozen solid, take them off of the plate & drop into a small plastic bag. Take what you need. Lasts forever!

Have not made this yet, but am definitely going to make it soon. This is in answer to how to keep chipotles...you can put them into a plastic dish and freeze them. Not sure how long they keep, but I'm sure it's as long as they stay good in the freezer.

For all of you that attempt on healthful munchin', this recipe is perfect! There's lots of flavor, without a lot of fuss (as long as you have a food processor). The chipotle chiles I found were manufactured by GOYA & I found it in a grocery with a large Hispanic section. I used four garlic cloves instead of one, and served this with sesame bagel chips as well as garlic chips. If you're not a fan of cilantro, leave it out, it'll still be good. It's a keeper!

Better than plain hummus, and worth the trouble of finding chipotles--they add a nice kick. Definitely serve with garlic bagel chips--pita isn't as good. One question--how to store remaining chipotles in adobo and how long do they keep?
