The dried tomatoes give this a sort of brown color after it's been through the processor, which isn't the most appetizing color. Also, there's a bit of tangy or sour flavor to it.

Took this to a party and everyone raved about it. I didn't have whipped cream cheese on hand so I used a brick of fat free cream cheese instead. Used a bit more basil, 3 whole garlic cloves and almost a 1/2 a cup of sun dried tomatoes. Served it with crackers and pita bread ... it disappeared before anything else

I made this recipe to serve with crackers, as an appetizer for unexpected guest. It was a hit. It was so easy, quick and flavorful. The recipe was made all in my mini processor. I only made one change due to lack of ingrediant in the house. I subbed low fat sour cream for the yogurt. It tasted great and my guest really liked the flavors. This is definitely a keeper recipe that I will be making frequently. I highly recommend to everyone.

I have made this spread for several different social occasions. I have been asked for the recipe every time! Definitely make it at least a day ahead of time to give the flavors time to blend.

I thought it was awful. The only ingredient that stood out was the yogart. I never even served it becasue my husband did not like it at all.

This was truly delicious!! I left out the sundried tomatoes since I don't like them, but the remaining ingredients were sublime. Subtle, delicate flavours. Don't leave out the pine-nuts, they absolutely make this dish! A keeper.

Blah! We didn't like this much at all; edible is the best I would describe it as. Didn't like the texture and thought the tomatoes tasted funny in this dip. Oh well, I usually do so well with recipes from this site that I can hardly complain about the odd dud. Sandra

I made this for a party where I was required to bring an appetizer. I put the spread on crostini I had made earlier that day by diagonally slicing a baguette into about 1/2" pieces, then lightly toasting them till slightly crisp. I quickly assembled the crostini at the party by spreading a bit of the feta mixture on top of each, and then garnished with a few extra toasted pine nuts and a small sprinkle of chiffonaded fresh basil leaves. It looked really pretty and was more practical to eat it this way as there wasn't really room to set it up as a dip-type dish. Everyone loved it, and unfortunately none was left for me take home to have on bagels the next morning! (Next time I'll make a bit extra just for that purpose!). This was easy, tasted great, and was just "different" enough to appeal to both the food adventurers and the plain food folk.

I printed this recipe out quite some time ago. I had forgotten about it until I was searching for something "different" for a family gathering. I served the spread with bagel chips and it was outta this world. It was a huge hit and will be a permanent part of future gathering.

Very EASY-to-make-spread!!!! I used more basil and sundried tomatoes, and sprinkled some on top of the dish. Looks divine and tastes that way, too!! Everyone asked what ingredients were in it.

This is a keeper!! I made this and my family loved it. I cheated and bought the feta with basil and sun dried tomato.

This was very good, served with crackers. I accidentally only bought half the amt of feta, but it actually turned out very well.

This recipe was so good, and incredibly easy. I loved it, my family loved it, our guests loved it. It was delicious and interesting enough to keep returning for more. I will absolutely make it again! I followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing -- except perhaps setting some aside so we could use it on bagels the next day. A true winner!

This recipe is awesome. I use sundried tomato spread in place of the oil packed sun dried tomatos. It's great on slices of French bread. Everytime I bring it somewhere people rave about it and have to have the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!! I made it for our Superbowl party and everyone just stood around the table and inhaled it. I've made it several times since then and it is always a big hit. And the leftovers (if there are any) go great on a bagel for lunch.

Every time I make this dip, people are begging me for the recipe. It disappears instantly. I used low fat cream cheese and non fat yogurt and it is still awesome!

People LOVE this dip. I was running late to a cocktail party and was asked to bring an hors d'oeuvre-- I whipped this up in about 10 minutes and served with pita chips. It disappeared. Instantly.

A definite crowd pleaser. It's quick and delicious, and can be made ahead of time. Try it as an appetizer served with assorted breads. It's sure to please.

This is a great, quick dip for raw vegetables or spread for crackers and breads. I "toasted" the nuts in the microwave to save time. (Just put them in a glass with a bit of butter and stir every minute until they're brown, about 3 minutes.) I actually didn't have the dried tomatoes, but it tasted great anyway.

This spread is versatile (crackers, bagels, veggies) and has great flavor. It's strong on the feta, but that's great if you like feta! I'm glad we could get this recipe!

For an interesting twist on this recipe, I served it as a sauce for Veil-Thin Pasta, which is filled with spinach and feta. (This pasta is commercially available at Costco). I thinned the spread with 8 tablespoons of boiling water from the pasta. Add one tablespoon at a time to temper the spread so it does not curdle. The sauce was exceptional and such a nice change from a typical Alfredo sauce.

A winner! Great with veggies, breadsticks, water crackers, on bagels, on a sandwich with roast turkey, etc. Very versatile and keeps a long time.

This recipe tastes great and is easy to make. It will be my appetizer on Thanksgiving this year. The consistency is better the second day. That's if you can save it until the next day. It's too good to put it in the refrigerator for a day!

Love this recipe. Made it for a wedding and it disappeared immediately! Doesn't look all that great, so I put it in a bread "bowl" the next time I served it (Like spinach dip). The tangy flavor is addictive! This recipe has become a "regular" at all parties/weddings/potlucks!

Yummy, yummy --and sooooo easy! This is even better the second day, after the flavors have had a chance to meld together... will definately make this again--

My family is addicted to this spread! It makes a wonderful appetizer served with Lavoosh Crackers for use at a casual dinner party. It's also very easy to make.

Very nice flavor. Excellent when spread on thinly sliced crusty french bread. This was a hit with my friends. I will bring this next time I need to bring an "appetizer to pass."

I thought this was good but not great. I agree that it seemed very salty, which probably had to do with the feta I used. I like the basic concept and ingredients, and think it has potential, but was not too excited by the results.

A little salty (I guess that will depend on the type of feta you use), but it was very easy to make and everyone loved it.

I've made this spread twice since the recipe debuted in the June 2000 issue. It has recieved rave reviews each time. It is very easy to make. I just throw everything in my food processor and it's good to go. I use extra garlic which gives it a great garlicky flavor. I also use extra sun dried tomatoes.The second time I made it, I used reduced-fat feta and it tasted great. I serve this with crackers or even toasted pita triangles. I think it would be good smeared on a turkey burger, too!
