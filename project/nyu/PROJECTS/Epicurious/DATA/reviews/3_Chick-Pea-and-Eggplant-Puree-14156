Why too much salt. Cut it to 1 teaspoon...

Intersting mixing of flavors. My partner is not an eggplant fan, and even he liked it. It is good for a dip, but has an odd, non-appealing color, but still good. Try it.

I skipped the salting/draining step; it's unnecessary unless using an old/bitter eggplant. HINT: Use Silpat to avoid sticking when roasting the eggplant without oil. I also used an entire can of chickpeas (1 1/2 cups) to avoid having leftover beans. Very tasty; used as a stuffing for fresh summer tomatoes. No extra salt necessary (canned beans already have sodium added). Fresh veggies, no oil, no sugar, no cooking necessary - great summer lunch!

The flavors in this puree were wonderful. I love the strong basil flavor. After stuffing this into the bell peppers I had plenty left over. I cut several corn tortillas into fourths, sprayed with non-fat olive oil and baked for about 5 minutes, then sprinkled with a little salt. Was a fabulous low-fat snack with substance. I agree that the salt in the recipe was intended for the eggplant and not the puree.

Chick-pea and eggplant mix together perfectly. I have made this dish and served it as a hummus-babaganush (sp?) a few times and I don't think that it is necessary to drain the eggplant for 30 minutes. I like to spray a fine mist of extra virgin olive oil onto the eggplant prior to broiling. I add salt to taste. I add tahini and extra virgin olive oil when combining the eggplant and chick peas.

This was very good. I didn't add the salt as called for, only to taste and it was perfect. we were hoping after having made the stuffed peppers that there would be some left over for hummus treats.

The chick peas and eggplant complement each other nicely. I believe that the 2 tbsp. of salt called for in the recipe were for sprinkling on the eggplant to draw out the moisture, and not to be added to the puree. I added only a tiny amount of salt to season.

I found that the puree was MUCH too salty! I will try it again with 2 tsp of salt instead of tablespoons.
