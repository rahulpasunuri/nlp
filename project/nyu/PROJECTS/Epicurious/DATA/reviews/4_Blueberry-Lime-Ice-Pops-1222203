These popsicles were incredible in taste and texture and so very easy. I used frozen wild blueberries and 1/3 cup sugar, which I still found to be too sweet. I didn't end up with enough liquid to fill the 8 pop molds I needed, so I added an equal amount of fat-free half and half to 4 of the pops, and those (blueberry cream pops) were equally delicious.

They were very good, but I would definitely cut down on the sugar next time around.

Fabulous! I made these as directed and wouldn't change a thing. They were super rich and flavorful. I am making them again tonight.
