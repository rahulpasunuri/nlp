This was a hit. It reminds you of pumpkin pie a bit. Maybe you could have just used Chinese 5 Spice and some peppercorns and gotten close to the same taste. It did take a little more time than the average pudding ice cream. No matter. Im a start from scratch kind of gal who enjoys the process. But.....finally.....it's time to buy that darn electric spice grinder. Anywho, really tasty. Will make again.

This Ice Cream is SOOOO Good. I did not expect to like it, but was willing to give it a try. I'll be making the caramel cakes this Wed. and will serve them together. Last night, 7 of us had samples. EVERYONE really liked it. The only thing I might do differently next time is reduce the cloves just a bit.
