So like others I only had boneless chicken breast. So I cooked the potatoes at 500 for 20 minutes with some red bell pepper chunks I had left over. I then turned down the oven to 350 and cooked the chicken. I also made a sauce with a little white wine, mustard, and tomato paste. Without the sauce I think that chicken would be very bland.

Easy weeknight meal. Added some onions to the bottom of the pan, then removed the chicken and potatoes when done and deglazed the pan with some chicken stock,white wine, and a little butter to make a nice sauce.

Leave the garlic cloves whole. This dish is quick, easy, delicious and for these reasons deserves a four fork rating.

Perhaps nothing fancy or company-worthy, but still a good dish. I made this with one thigh and one breast (both organic); supplemented the fresh rosemary with additional fresh sage and thyme. I also added carrots (baby carrots cut in half) to the roasting pan with about 20 or so minutes to go as I don't like my carrots too well cooked. It was good with some chardonnay and makes for a nice weeknight meal or anytime you want something simple and easy but tasty. With good quality ingredients a recipe this simple allows the true flavors to really shine.

Average. Agree -- no more than the sum of its parts. Even added extra herbs, garlic and olive oil as other readers suggested, still a merely passable dish.

The dish as is, was ok. After I took it out of the oven, I added some lemon juice and butter to liven it up

Easy to prepare, and delicious. As others said, a perfect week night meal. The only problem I had was the garlic burning (I ended up covering w/aluminum foil)--next time, I think I'll coat the chicken and garlic in oil as well to try to prevent this.

Based on the mixed reviews, I used the recipe just for the basic idea. I chopped up some fresh thyme, rosemary, flat parsley and 2 garlic cloves, made a paste with olive oil and smeared half (with salt & pepper) over 2 whole chicken legs. I tossed the rest of the garlic and herb paste with 2 peeled russets, cut into wedges, and some more olive oil, salt, and pepper (I think the problem with the recipe as written is there's not enough olive oil). Scattered the potatoes around the chicken in a pyrex baking dish, baked at 400 about 40 minutes, turning the potatoes halfway through. I did have to fight with the potatoes a bit to get them out at the end, but they were so crispy and delicious it was worth it. It was great!

I loved this recipe because it was easy, fast and yummola! I also used boneless, skinless chix breast, but I threw mine in a pot still frozen with half a chopped vidalia onion, an ungodly amount of minced garlic, and dried rosemary. I cooked it with the lid on until my husband took it out of the oven: onions were rich and carmelly, potatoes were not crisp, but had a pleasing texture and flavor.

We tried this recipe last night and if cooked properly it would be a delicious meal and I would probably give it a "4". However, I used skinless, boneless, chicken breasts, and par boiled the potatoes to assure doneness. I have found that par boiling the potatoes when making a dish like this or gratin potatoes that the pre cooking of the potatoe always assures doneness. I also took the suggestion of the cook from VA and lined the pan with tin foil to avoid difficult clean up. DON'T DO IT! Even though the dish contains some oil, at this temperature and cooking for 35 minutes, the potatoes stick to the foil and makes it almost impossible to get them off the foil. There is no way you can turn the potatoes to assure crispyness. I need to adjust the oven temperature because 35 minutes at 500 degrees makes the boneless chicken breasts totally over cooked. Next time I will start the potatoes at 500 degrees for perhaps 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees, add the chicken until it is done for 25 minutes or so. I think that may work. The flavors are wonderful. Of course, we love rosemary and we love garlic. So there you go!

Fast easy and you don't have to use a ton of different ingredients!

Terrific--it's become a weeknight standard. I skin the chicken before roasting add a chopped onion for a little more flavor.

We thought this was no more than the sum of its parts. Too many recipes out there to repeat this one.

Great week-night dinner. I used skinless, boneless breasts, marinaded in balsamic vinegrette (as recommended by a previous reviewer); baked at 450 for 30 minutes. Chicken was still a little dry but good anyway. Great rosemary flavor. Have to determine best time/temp combination for the boneless chicken. Clean-up also a snap - only the baking sheet to clean, and I'll probably use alumnum foil next time to eliminate that.

This tastes good when done, but it isn't fast. The recipe definitely takes longer than 45 minutes, due to the cooking time, even at the high heat. At the 20 minute mark, it was looking pretty pale. And, because of the high tempature, I needed to go in and flip the potatoes every 10 minutes, so that they wouldn't burn and so that they would crisp evenly. At the 1/2 way mark, I moved all the potatoes to the bottom, and moved the chicken on top and then covered the parts that were already browned with tin foil, and left the parts that weren't uncovered. Maybe it's just me, but I like to get my chicken an even golden brown. I liked the taste at the end, but this recipe needs some time and temp adjustments.

Very good! Added baby carrots, cooked for 40 minutes, turned out very well.

Rating: 4
The only problem I had was that it took a good hour to cook the chicken legs all the way through (used a meat thermometer) - so plan accordingly. Otherwise, the dish turned out great - and was a huge hit.

I found this recipe to be tasty but dry. I even marinated the chicken (skinless breasts) and it was still dry. Next time I'll use a non-stick pan and more oil or less cooking time.

This is a great worknight dish. Couldn't be easier. I used skinless thights which I marinated in a bottled marinade I had in the fridge. I'll though in some breasts next time. For skinless poultry I think a marinade is a must for moisture and flavor. This may become a quick weeknight staple.

Very easy to make and is still excellent! Good to make when you don't have a lot of time and want a good, healthy meal! If you're a "meat and potato" kind of person, you'll love this one!

Pretty Good. I wanted to add more flavor to the chicken, so... I made a Balsamic/Dijon Mustard Viniagrette to marinate the chicken. That was Fantastic! I also added onions with the potatoes. The flavor from the marinade slighly seeped into the potatoes and was a wonderful combination with the rosemary. Served the dish with fresh steamed vegies. Simple, easy and quick!

Good! Not great, but good. And you really don't get much simpler. . . I threw in half a bag of baby carrots w/ the potatoes, and added a little balsamic for extra moisture and drizzled some on the chicken. (I used skinless breasts.)

I took a chance on this recipe and my hunch was correct. Both my husband and I loved it. We especially like the crispy skin. It's easy to make and very tasty.

This dish is so easy and delicious that it is requested weekly! I tried it with some carrots thrown in and it worked great!

We changed the recipe somewhat, adding the juice of one lemon, and a bit more olive oil for flavour. We also used New Potatoes, instead of Yukon Gold. It came out well, especially given how easy it was. Perhaps it was a bit too simple/plain for a dinner party. But great for a quick "dîner à deux".

Looked too easy to be good-- but it came out great!! and my husband keeps requesting it. I added a little balsamic vinegar with the oil and it added a nice flavor.

I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs and added carrots along with the Yukon Gold potato - it was delicious!

I'm addicted. This is my type of "Quick" Meal - minimumn amount of prep work and it cooks in the oven, while you do other things - but you don't sacrifice taste in the end.

Very simple to make....great comfort food. It has become a staple in our house, especially in the summer months when there's fresh rosemary on hand. I also added leftover root vegetables with the potatoes (eg. carrots, onions)...delicious! Also great with skinless, boneless chicken thighs.
