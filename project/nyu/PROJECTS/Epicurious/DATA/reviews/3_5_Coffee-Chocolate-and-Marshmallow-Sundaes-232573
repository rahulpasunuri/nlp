Simple and quick! The flavors are lovely. I was surprised when the chocolate sauce became a sort of "magic shell" texture on the ice cream. Perhaps "fluff" is the wrong kind of marshmallow creme, or perhaps it is intentional?

I enjoyed this recipe. Its similar to the one on Best coffee recipe but it has nice twist.
