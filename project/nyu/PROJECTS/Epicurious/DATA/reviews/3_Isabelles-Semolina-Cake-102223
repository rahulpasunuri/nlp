They key is to cut back on the milk... the result is a more cake like with delicious caramel

If you are looking for a cake, don't make this. It is more like a flan. Very French. I baked it in a ring mold and when it was unmolded on the plate, put fresh blueberries in the center of the ring. Eat it the same day. Loved it...

This cake was horrible! More like a sponge than pudding or cake!
