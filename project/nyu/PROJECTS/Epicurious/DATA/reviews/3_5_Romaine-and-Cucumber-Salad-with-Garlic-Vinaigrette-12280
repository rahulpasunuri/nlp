I divided this recipe WAY down for 2 servings. For my 2 servings I used 1 Tbs. and 1/4 tsp. white wine vinegar, 1 large garlic clove mashed with 1/4 tsp. salt, 1-1/2 Tbs. olive oil, and 1/2 a cucumber. In lieu of romaine I used 3 cups (5-1/2 oz.) Ready-Pac Leafy Greens Blend. In the end I added a healthy sprinkle of garlic powder and black pepper. It made 2 large salads. Very, very good, even though it is SO simple. Hubby says to make this often. Do try it!!!

I loved the dressing but there's no way this dressing is enough for 2 heads of romaine. I used less than one head of romaine and it was perfect. Parmesan cheese is a nice addition as well. Very tasty!!

Easy, easy, easy. I cut it in half for 5 people and was surprised that the dressing covered the whole salad. It was delicious and soooo easy.

This was a good, no fuss salad. I used garlic wine vinegar. Next time, I would add additional ingredients to make it more interesting and colorful.

I really enjoyed this salad. It is a delightful salad with a robust garlic flavor. It is so simple to make and you can use ingredients you have at home. My boyfriend LOVED it too....and the vinaigrette is SO good as a bread dipping sauce.

My husband and I did eat the salad but I won't make it again. I have had better.

This is a very simple yet delicious salad and dressing. I did not use as much oil as it called for, and I used a combination of white wine vinegar and raspberry vinegar and everyone loved it. I also added more vinegar than called for.

In the words of my brother-in-law (an accomplished cook himself)- "this salad rocks!" The dressing is amazing! I have added parmesian regianno cheese and toasted sunflower seeds for the occasional variation.

I have made this salad on several occasions and it is always a hit. My friends and family love it! Goes very well with grilled lamb chops.

This is a must for all garlic lovers! It's simple to prepare and full of flavor! This is now my husband's favorite salad - we have to have it at least once a week!
