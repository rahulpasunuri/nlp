I've been looking for this recipe for 25 years. Some friends of mine had a small restaurant in Atlanta called George and this was the signature dessert. The restaurant closed and I lost track of the friends, but I never forgot this cake. It's amazing.

This cakes is time consuming to make, but well worth the time.
