This is a good, simple recipe. I made it to serve with chicken liver pate.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, but found they did not get the good syrupy glaze I expected. They were a little dry, but a hit nonetheless. When I made them the second time, I used Champagne and upped the amount of honey. I cooked them longer to really reduce the liquid and they were perfect!

I actually made this as a dessert, which I served warm with vanilla ice cream. It tasted lovely, but even though I let the figs cook and steep longer than the recipe called for, they didn't really soak up the syrup. So, the end result was dried figs (not poached or even glazed) stuffed with almonds in an aromatic syrup. All in all, probably better as an appetizer -- not goopy enough for dessert!
