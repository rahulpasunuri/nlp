This didn't work out well for me. I followed another cook's recommendation to replace half of the ricotta with mascarpone and the result was a soupy mess. The different components were tasty but it didn't come together as a dish for me.

This recipe was very well-received. I took the other reviewer's suggestions and added cinnamon to the Rhubarb. I also cut down on the amount of sugar to get more of the tart taste of the rhubarb. This recipe is definitely a keeper. The only change I would make would be to use more fruit.

People, you are missing a great recipe! Now is the time to get fresh rhubarb and make this wonderful dessert! You will get rave reviews! I have been making this since 2001 and it is always a must for a great spring dessert.

Just Wonderful! Watch that puff pastry in the oven though....the time seems a little long. I also put sliced strawberries and a can (drained) of pitted bing cherries in the rhubarb mixture. (I also put a little cinnamon in it.) This sauce was even better on pancakes! So you could possibly eliminate the rhubarb, I suppose. Also, don't put too much drizzle on the final product or it will get soggy. My guests just loved this dessert. Definitely a hit!

Found several of the reviews helpful..actually loved the end result. I would like to see the daimeter decreased. I added a little red food coloring to the end product for the rhubarb, to add color. also, I used marscarpone cheese and liked the addition of cinnamon. I broiled the tartlets w/ rhubarb and brn. sugar sprinkled on top, then served w/ ice cream/ VERY GOOD!

I have a question. I don't like rhubarb, could you use other types of fruit? Does anyone have an idea as to how much if possible.

Replace 1 cup of ricotta with 1 cup mascarpone and add a healthy pinch of cinnamon to rhubarb while it is cooking. The mascarpone will richen up the dish and the cinnamon does to rhubarb what it does to chocolate.
