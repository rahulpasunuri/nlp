I used whatever onions I had on hand and beef broth instead of chicken broth. Perhaps I was heavy-handed with the beef broth but it was French Onion Soup in a pan. Smelled and tasted great. A hit with my family

This is so good. My only complaint is that the melted cheese made the croutons turn into a solid mass as soon as the dish started to cool. I need to work out something where the cheese and croutons cooperate a little more with one another. If it hadn't been for that little glitch, I would have given the dish four forks.

This was a great side dish for the pork loin. prep was a little time consuming, but nice because it could be done all ahead of time. They smelled so great as they were cooking and the cheese and crouton topping was an excellent combination. Would be great with any onions is you don't want to buy all the different varieties. My favorite of the bunch was the sweet onion.

This recipe was a perfect pairing with the NY Strip Roast I made for a dinner party. The variety of onions was a perfect complement! Prep of the pearl onions was a little long, but after looking up a quick peel method I was on a roll. Nice for parties as many of the steps can be performed a day ahead.

The recipe is marginaly labor intensive, it took 45 minutes to prep. Well worth the effort. I feel you can use a varity of onions, that is the joy, mix and match. On the finish, I think and will try, using other liquids for moisture, a sherry or madera, would give it more depth, at this point that is conjecture, will let you know. GOOD STUFF.

Pearl onions are delicious and a always beautiful. For those that think the prep is too much I would say it is well worth it. The combination of flavors and texture were perfect. My 13 and 9 year old nieces loved it also. We served this for Thanksgiving dinner but I will make it again for a cocktail party on Saturday.

I thought this was pretty tasty..but I'm not sure if all my suffering prepping the onions was worth it. Maybe assign the cooking on this recipe to someone else. I can imagine this would be very tasty incorporated into french onion soup.
