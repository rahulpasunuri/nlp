This marinade was spectacular, especially when I cooked the chicken on the grill with hickory chips. The meat got a wonderful sweet smoky flavor and my guests loved it. The tamarind is a must and I did add a little more tamarind than suggested for an extra twang! I also suggest add some mango...

Disappointing. The many strong flavors, especially the molasses, overwhelmed the delicate tamarind. Even as generic BBQ sauce it was just ok--my husband supplemented the meal with his usual BBQ sauce.
