So, a nice pasta dish with a twist. I've tried with various fillings and, while this one is nice, it's a bit too much effort. The easiest replacement I've found is Nutella (which you can get in Europe, not sure about the US). IT's just a hazelnut chocolate spread. Mix about a cup, with a cup and a half of heavy cream until it's not so think (about the consistency of the actual filling in this recipe). I've also tried with jam, which is just as nice.

I spent several hours making and rolling out the dough and then putting the filling in and closing them up, and in the end I was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. I had a pasta machine, but not ravioli cutters. However, I used a cookie cutter to cut out circles and then sealed them after filling using the tines of a fork. The ravioli looked beautiful both before and after I cooked them, but with food I believe that taste is of the utmost importance. Upon biting into the first ravioli I regretted all the work that I put into it. Pasta has got to be one of the only kinds of food that I don't enjoy with chocolate, it's a cool idea but in praxis, its teerrible. The filling and the topping were good, I wish I had done like other people and not even messed with the pasta part, just eaten the pudding and the topping, maybe over the top of brownies?

I plan to make this for a special occasion but I will use pre-made won- ton wrappers. I appreciate the other tips in the reviews such as only making half the filling, etc., and will apply those as well.

I didn't even bother trying to make the dough. Instead, I served the filling cold in a dish, like a custard, with the warm sauce over the top. It's delicious this way. The first time I made this, I didn't temper the egg yolks with the hot milk and instead just added the egg mixture all at once to the hot milk. The eggs immediately scrambled. The texture was like cottage cheese.

Perhaps I'm not the most fantastic dough maker, but I do cook a fair amount, and I found this recipe difficult to present with grace. As one reviewer stated, the tools are very key. I have a pasta maker, but lack any sort of ravioli cutter, thus the morsels did not come out looking nicely uniform. What I DO love, however, is the filling! I had some left over, so I filled numerous frozen pastry tarts with the chocolate cream, and popped them in the oven. After cooling slightly, I added a dollop of whipping cream to top them off, and devoured! Very yummy.

I have made this a few times now. Yes, do cut the filling amount in half. The chocolate sauce is a pretty generous portion as well. These freeze very well. I would not try this without a pasta machine. I have made the dough exactly as in the recipe and I have made it in my KitchenAid with the dough hook attachment and both worked out perfectly so needless to say, I will let the machine do the work.

You need the tools to make this recipe work. Everything went well except for the ravioli part, which as it turns out is kind of important when making Chocolate RAVIOLIs!! It was my fault but you need a pasta maker to get it thin enough. I worked and worked still very doughy (sp?). I would make it again when I have time and the right tools. I agree with others about cream filling; you can cut it in half.

I confess I did not have a pasta machine so I rolled the dough as thin as possible...it still was a little more doughy than I would like but they were amazing. I halved the recipe (since it was only for two) and I have plenty of leftovers. I agree that there was alot of filling, but it's so yummy that I'm not too worried about using it up!

I love making ravioli and this recipe was very straightforward. However, I couldn't help notice when I read the recipe that the filling amount seemed alot for just 24 ravioli and I was right. You could make just half the filling amount and it would be enough, especially using only 1 teaspoon of filling. I used two teaspoons of filling and I stilled had plenty left over and it made more than 24 ravioli. I served mine with not just the chocolate sauce, but creme anglaise, fresh raspberries and raspberry coulis. The family loved them. It is very rich and four ravioli per person fills you up.
