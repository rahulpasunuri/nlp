Got raves. I doubled it except that I didn't double the ricotta (by mistake) but it turned out fabulous. Very easy but tastes great. A keeper!

This is an easy, very tasty, and versatile recipe. A great basic for everyone's recipe box. Tip: if you use no-boil noodles, as I do, then save a lot more than 2 TBSP sauce to top the last layer of noodles. Otherwise the top layer won't take in enough moisture in the oven, and will turn out underdone and crispy. I top the lasagna with several TBSP of sauce and cheese, making sure to cover the top layer thickly. Makes it a little more messy, but turns out great.

These are perfect for when you want lasange, but don't need to make a whole pan and reduces baking time. I am not accustomed to making lasagne with so little cheese, but I didn't miss it in these. I have made them several times as written, but next time I may try a spinach & artichoke filling or wild mushroom filling.

I like vegetables and pasta so it will be a winner for me.

Very good recipe. I really prefer this to those heavy bechamel versions. The only problem is that it tends a bit to fall apart. I changed the reciped a little as instead of bottled marinara sauce I used a fresh homemade marinara made with the recipe found on this site. It was really great. The second time I replaced the zucchini by red bell peppers as that was all I had and it also turned out great. Another great advantage of this recipe is that you can prepare it just for yourself as you can easily halve the proportions.

I made it with quick-cook (no boiling) noodles and it took even less time.

Easy to make, very tasty and it made enough to serve 4 with a salad. I make this every couple of weeks and vary the vegetables somewhat.

I also added mushrooms, spinach, and onions, although next time I will add more. I thought it was pretty good, my husband thought it was terrific. Easy to make, that's for sure. Definitely double or triple the recipe if you are feeding more than two.

Very easy to make; great last minute dish. I made it with spinach too, which worked well.
