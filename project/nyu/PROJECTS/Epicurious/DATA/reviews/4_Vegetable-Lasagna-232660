I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a big hit. It's very easy to put together; doesn't take a lot of time. Guests went back for 2nds and 3rds!

I had to make something quick and easy for a last-minute party. Took this recipe as inspiration and gave it my own twist. I tossed veggies with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper and roasted at 425'F for 30 mins. Used butternut squash, red bell pepper, mushrooms,and zucchini. Then layered with whole-wheat pasta, spinach, ready-made red sauce, sundried tomatos, and shredded Italian cheese mix (cheated a bit, I know). Turned out excellent - light and fresh. Everyone LOVED it! I've never seen a whole tray of lasagna disappear so quickly.

This did not turn out for me. The vegetables never cooked through despite cooking it much longer than the recommended 40 minutes.

Surprisingly easy to make and came out absolutely delicious. It was soupy though... I think because I added mushrooms and they gave off liquid along with the other veggies. Next time I'm going to sautee them first. Other adjustments: no red peppers, added sun dried tomatoes (just what I had on hand and they were delicious), red pepper flakes, the mushrooms, mozarella, and extra olives and garlic. Can't wait to make this again and try with different veggie combos... eggplant or spinach would be great additions.

This was delish! I had ricotta cheese on hand so I used that instead. I also used whole wheat lasagna to make it even more healthy. I added fresh and frozen spinach that was near the end of its shelf life. This is a great recipe when you have some veggies in your fridge that you need to use up! I make this over and over again..each time different veggies...but always tasty!

i was surprised at how much flavor this lasagna has. Instead of using goat cheese I used low fat cottage cheese (24 oz) and I also added fresh mushrooms and spinach leaves. It's great!

P.S. I didn't cook the vegetables and I used the no bake lasagna noodles too

One of my boys was having a vegetarian friend over so I made this and everyone loved it. My non-vegie boys asked if I would make this lasagna rather than the one with meat! I added a whole container of ricotta cheese to the goat cheese and add mozzerella on top with the parmesean. Yeah - we like chesse!

Excellent dish! My boyfriend is quite a foodie and was raving about this meal. Substitutions I made: fresh pasta in 2 varieties: tomato basil and spinach, which I layered alternatively. Use this! Go to your local Italian Market and start with fresh ingredients, it really makes the difference. Also used fresh, homemade pasta sauce, which obviated the need for add'l garlic. Skipped the black olives (would've been too salty) and also did NOT precook the veggies -- would've been way too soggy and would ruin the dish. The bottle of roasted red peppers was a wonderful addition. I added eggplant and zucchini and baby bella mushrooms but held the summer squash, there just wasn't room (and I had another dish in mind for that, anyway). For the cheese, I used a Goat Cheese Gouda blend, as regular goat cheese will not melt properly. I also augmented with a few small scoops of ricotta, and overall, found it to be just the right amount of cheese, with more veggies and the sauce.

I've made this recipe several times. My favorite version was using butternut squash, which I diced very small and roasted beforehand. I also made my own sauce and put mushrooms and fresh red pepper in it (and skipped bottle red pepper). Agree that you need to add more goat cheese. Very filling and a crowd pleaser.

Great recipe! The Thyme makes it tasty for sure. I made changes based on the comments I read. I used Rice noodles instead of wheat so it's lower in gluten. Instead of chopping and sautéing the veggies I just sliced them very thin and laid them in layers in between the noodles. I didn't pre-cook the noodles OR the veggies but I did cook the whole thing for 25 more minutes covered than the recipe said, checking at 15+ and 25+ with a knife. And for those who like cheese, I sliced mozzarella on top of the ricotta. Deelish!!!

This is exceptionally tasty, even if you use fresh basil instead of the dry (which I also add to the plate at the end!) I also mistakenly grabbed only 4 oz of goat cheese, but had some ricotta on hand. I blended the ricotta and goat cheese, and it worked splendidly. I left out the olives and used some mushrooms with the vegetables, for a slightly less salty recipe. Fantastic. I might try my own red sauce next time to really make it stand out and shine.

A very easy recipe to make and it tastes great. My husband doesn't like to eat anything without meat, but liked this dish. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the veggies first (plus added mushrooms), and also used some mozzarella cheese on each layer to fill in the gaps between the goat cheese. I used no- boil noodles with no problem. The goat cheese really makes the dish. Be sure to get a higher-quality goat cheese if you have the option. I found a cheaper harder package and a softer more expensive one at the store. I'm glad I purchased the softer and slightly pricier one.

This lasagna was amazing! I did make a few changes though. I used oven-ready lasagna noodles, cooked it in a 9x13 pan (made 12 decently big servings), and used ricotta instead of goat cheese. My deli had sliced goat cheese so I layered those in too. I also sauteed my veggies briefly just to soften them. I'm not sure the olives or fresh thyme were necessary, I didn't really taste them. But otherwise I wouldn't have changed a thing. A+!

Wow. You guys totally hit it right on the head. Too bad I read the reviews after I followed the recipe to the "T." There was hardly enough cheese to cover the vegie mixture which tasted extraordinary. I had way too many noodles left over and found my lasagna didn't have enough layers. I added cottage cheese to the cheese mixture just to stretch it. I would make this again for sure.

As a 26yo American in Paris working as a nanny, I can review this on several levels. As a 20's American, fairly easy- although I love to cook. As a person living in Europe, fairly easy to find all of the ingredients, and you are likely to have most on hand. If not, improvise as I did. I used dried thyme instead of fresh, made a quick sauce from a small jar of ricotta-based sauce (the small jars that pesto always comes in), a can of tomatoes and some tomato paste. I used the lasagna that you don't have to precook, and zucchini and eggplant. Simple prep, easy clean up, pretty healthy and everyone (including kids 3 & 5 y's/o) thought it was pretty good. I baked it for 30 minutes as the directions for my lasagna called for 20 min and this for 40. Oops, and I just realized I was supposed to cover with foil, which I didn't do. Anyway, definitely keeping the recipe for future use.

Excellent!!! I stuck to the menu, using butternut squash, uncooked lasasgne and adding ricotta to the cheese mixture and it turned out perfect! I also added a little mozza on top for the cheese lovers in my family. A big hit for even my Alberta born, meat loving husband! Really easy to prepare compared to traditional lasagna.

Excellent dish. Served at dinner party for 4, plenty of leftovers for 2nd and 3rd day which were excellent...the true test of a great italian dish. I substituted fresh moz and feta for the fat free cheese and came out nice and didn't sacrifice too much on the healthy front. I also used all fresh spices and herbs...will make again

This was a very flavorful and delicious lasagna. However, I did run into a few problems while making it. I used cooked the lasagna noodles which I think made the dish too watery. Also, I used an 8in by 7in baking dish which was too small. The dish was overflowing and I didn't even get to use all of the lasagna noodles. It still tasted GREAT and my husband loved it!! Does anyone have any useful tip for when I make this again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I changed because I could not find lowfat goat cheese, was that I substituted 7 ounces of goat cheese crumbles. This was absolutely delicious and a nice healthy was to enjoy lasagna. Definitely a real step up from regular lasagna!

I substitute fresh roasted red pepper from the grill rather than jarred, which to me are too oily. You can also substitute grilled eggplant for squash, or add it if you like. I mix the goat cheese with 1/2 small container of part skim ricotta cheese and substitute a large can of crushed tomoatoes for prepared sauce and am sure to add about a cup of red wine to the tomato sauce and simmer on the stove for 1/2 hour before putting in lasagna. It makes the lasagna much more rich in flavor and the veggies soak up the wine while baking! edit this note :

Although I often alter recipes I've never tried before, this time I followed the recipe pretty much to the T. The result was a wonderful, somewhat "gourmet" lasagna. A number of reviewers have suggested that the recipe does not call for enough cheese. I agree that if what you want is a cheesy lasagna, then you should add more goat cheese, ricotta, or even mozarella. Any variation like that would be delicious. But as is, the result is a firm lasagna, with a pleasing mix of crunchiness and creaminess. I did not saute the veggies first, and they cooked just perfectly - an "al dente" texture, but certainly not raw. The goat cheese did NOT spread, as the recipe calls for, partly because I had just taken it out of the fridge, and partly because the vegetables beneath the cheese layer totally prevented spreading. Instead I left the dollops in place, and while they didn't spread much as they melted, they did provide a creamy richness. The bottom line is that if you want something more like a traditional (American-style) lasagna, you will want to add more cheese. If you are looking for something a little different, a little more upscale, but still delicious (extra delicious accompanied by Pinot Noir) then follow the recipe without too many alterations. The main changes I made were that I added a bit more olives (an organic black olive packed in only water and sea salt) and topped with Asiago cheese. The addition of mushrooms and chopped kalamata olives would also have been delicious. Just be aware that if you make certain changes, like adding spinach, sauteed veggies, you do run the risk of a soupy lasagna, as some other reviewes discovered.

Not your ordinary lasagna. I followed other reviewers' advice (thank you!) and used goat cheese crumbles and 7 oz ricotta - this seemed about the right amount of cheese. I also sauteed the vegetables along with diced mushrooms and some chopped spinach. If you sautee the veggies, be sure to drain excess water! I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and did not boil first - they were fine. I would make this again for me or vegetarian friends.

i really enjoyed this recipe (all week long for my lunch!!) but i took the advice of others and sauteed the veggies before putting them in the lasagna. also, i just about doubled the goat cheese!! this recipe does NOT include enough cheese.

This was my first time making lasagna and it was delicious. I followed a lot of advice from other reviewers, such as using 7 oz of ricotta with the goat cheese (perfect!), sauteing the veggies with shallots and garlic before putting them in the lasagna, and leaving out the olives. I though I did pretty good dallops of the cheese, spacing them every inch or so. But, as another reviewer said, the cheese really doesn't melt at all. My only criticism would be that the lasagna was pretty "soupy" from the sauce. I think it was maybe because I boiled the noodles prior to placing in the pan. Oh well - still delicious!

I made this recipe for a group of vegetarians and meat eaters alike- all loved it! I DID make a few adjustments on the second time around which I think were worth the extra effort... Because the goat cheese is hard to spread I used 4oz of goat cheese crumbles, blended with about 7oz low fat ricotta. I also sauteed all of the vegetables and garlic along with some drained frozen spinach- I think it turned out much better with softer (and more) vegetables.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice variation to traditional lasagna and healthy at the same time. I ended up only using the goat cheese for the 1st layer b/c I ended up needing a lot more than what the recipe called for. It actually still turned out well b/c I did not like the taste of the gaot cheese anyway and used mostly mozzarella cheese when the goat cheese ran out. The only other thing that I would do differently would be to cut the zuchini and squash into much smaller pieces.

I quite enjoyed this recipe (with a few changes). I left out the olives and red pepper, and added spinach and shallots...yum! The goat cheese is a nice change from traditional lasagna.

I used Ricotta instead of goat cheese, perhaps that was an error. There was too much thyme in it. it was overpowering.

Rating: 3
This was very, very good even with my ready to bake rice lasagna noodles. I sauteed and seasoned the vegies with more oregano and basil before adding them to the lasagna. The only difficulty is that the goat cheese really doesn't spread nor does it melt during baking. So be sure your dollops are small and very spread out. Then the recipe is hard to beat!.

I made this dish because I was having a vegetarian friend over for dinner and I don't have many meatless recipes. I was a little scared because the goat cheese sounded odd, but it was really easy to make and my husband and guests raved about it. Even my friend's non vegetarian husband had 3rds!

I made this recipe twice. I first used the no-boil lasagna, and although it was ok, this recipe was much better with traditional boiled lasagna, which honestly does not take much longer to make. The recipe is absolutely delicious! I omitted the black olives, and used bella mushrooms with the zucchini, squash and red pepper. I also cut the suggested amount of garlic in half. I will make this dish again and again!

I also used no boil lasagna. Sauteeing the vegetables first is worth the effort and I nearly doubled the goat cheese. yummy.

Wow! What a great vegetarian meal. The dish was ridiculously quick to put together. I used the lasagna that does not require pre-cooking. My guests and my husband really liked it.
