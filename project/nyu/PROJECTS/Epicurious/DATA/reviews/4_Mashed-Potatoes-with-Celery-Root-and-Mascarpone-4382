Yep, it's as good as it sounds. This recipe halves easily if you're not looking to serve 10 people. The celery root came through just enough for me, and I went ahead and used russet potatoes. This recipe made me ask myself why I don't cook with celery root more often.

This was absolutely delicious. Made if for guests, who all asked for seconds.

Sorry-I had high hopes for this dish...had never used celery root before, but even the produce guy remarked what a great pairing it was with potatoes...unfortunately, they tasted like plain old mashed potatoes. Not worth the extra effort.

I used russet potatoes instead of yukon gold but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These were rich and creamy and everyone loved them.

I thought it was just ok. The mascarpone cheese didn't really add much flavour despite its mammoth calorie count. I would really just substitute it with just milk and butter. I tried adding garlic which I pounded to the potatoes. Gave it a sharp garlicy taste.

Made this for New Year's Eve to go with a dried fruit-stuffed pork roast. What a nice combination! Used a regular masher and it worked fine. Will absolutely make this again as it was so flavorful and creamy!

So good! Followed the recipe as written, except for the equipment - just a regular old masher for me, no mixer. These were a tasty, indulgent variation on standard mashed potatoes - the celery root was an awesome, delicate addition, and mascarpone, well, YUM.

These were so quick and easy to make, and so indulgent. My Thanksgiving guests ooohed and aaahed, and requested the recipe right away. I seasoned with white pepper. Great when you want a rich, comforting side.

Great recipe! I boiled the celery root and the potatoes separately to ensure the perfect tenderness for each, and then as another cook suggested put them both through a ricer. I stirred in the given amount of mascarpone and butter by hand, and salted and peppered to taste. Delicious!

I've made this every Thanksgiving since it was published, and most of the time, someone ends up cleaning up the serving dish and the mixing bowl with their spoon!

OK, I know it's annoying when someone changes like 8 things about a recipe and then raves about how great it was, but I have to share that this recipe inspired me to make a similar version using what I had on hand: everything was the same except I used a turnip instead of celery root and I used white horseradish instead of garlic. I was amazing. Light yet rich. The horseradish added some bite but was not overpowering (you can add to taste as you beat the mix). I paired it with braised short ribs.

Absolutely fabulous. I made this for the second year in a row for Thanksgiving and it was very well received by potato aficionados. The celeriac adds depth without overpowering, and the mascarpone cheese and butter makes them sinfully decadent and super smooth. Highly recommended.

My sister made this for Thanksgiving a and it was fantastic. I thought it needed some salt and she admitted she may have not used enough salt in the water. I think that would have done the trick. If you happen to have leftovers, you can make some nice croquettes out of this, or do as my Dad does, add an egg or two, some Romano cheese, and some mozzarella and bake in a greased baking dish.

Someone below gave this recipe only 2 stars/forks ... and then says they didn't follow the instructions when they made it! How silly that is! This is a full-on four-fork recipe when made the way it's described. Do it next time you make mashed 'taters!

I made this quite some time ago, around the holidays in fact, and recall it was superb. As stated, the Celeriac adds an interesting taste, and texture, and the mascarpone makes it oh so rich, yet not overly so. Will definitely make again, but probably when it's colder out.

I cut the butter in half for this recipe and it was still very cremy and delicious

Oh Lord, these are so good! If you reviewed the recipe and left out the Celery root, then your review is useless. The Celery root IS the recipe. Ever since I tried this recipe, I've added celery root to my mashed pototoes every time I make them, even if I don't have any mascarpone on hand. What a great flavor!

I cut the recipe in half (cut the butter by about 2/3) and added salt and pepper. I used a potato ricer instead of an electric mixer; it's easier and has a nice texture. Yum!

Best Mash I've made. I use a little more celery root than called for, and about half the butter. We like our mashed potatoes with a little texture, so toothsome bits of celery root were not a problem.

Really wonderful mashed potatoes. The celeriac gives it a little freshness. The cheese makes them so creamy. Everyone loved them.

Great recipe. Great flavor. It is really important taht you chop the celery root into smaller pieces if you want them to cook to the correct consistency with the potatoes. If you follow the recipe, these are great and not as heavy as usual mashed potatoes. My dinner guests always love them. As do the children.

don't scale back the celery root. great flavor as written, great without the marscapone if you want to cook on a whim and none is in the fridge. my inredibly picky five year old loved it as did the adults

I just made this for thanksgiving dinner, and my lesson learned was that I should have trusted the recipe more. I was afraid that the celeriac would be too overwhelming, so I cut back on it a little. Unfortunately, that just made this taste like regular old (albeit extra creamy and good) mashed potatoes. Also, I boiled the celeriac for at least 40 minutes before adding the potatoes to the boiling water but still they kept their texture too much when it came mashing time. I had little bits of darker white that I had to go through and mash with a fork. If I had used the full amount of celeriac the recipe called for, that would have been even more annoying.

These ultra smooth potatoes with the celery root flavour coming through are a big hit. Well worth trying and very easy.

This is my new favorite mashed potatoes recipe. My old recipe called for 1 cup (8oz) of pecorino romano cheese and 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) of garlic. The less gralic I have to mince the better! I confess I did not use the celery root but added 1 teaspoon of oregano. If you love mascarpone try the cheesecake recipe on this site.

Big hit. The mascarpone just makes it richer, but the celery root and addition of minced garlic at the end are what makes this recipe stand out.

I have made this every year since 1997 for Thanksgiving and always get rave reviews. I don't change anything about the recipe and it turns out perfectly. This is one that you should really try.

To save time I did not use celery root. Used mascarpone and lots of butter. Delicious and excellent as well the second day which I've never found the case to be with mashed potatoes.

This dish was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner - everyone loved it! People have offered up alternate methods of preparing this, however I found that if you just follow the directions, then it's very easy. Make sure your celery root is cubed to 1/2" size and your potatoes are cut to approx. 2" pieces. The potatoes can be rough sized, but it's important that your celery root is cubed to ensure even cooking. I can't stress this enough; make blocks, then planks, then sticks, then cubes - it's good knife skills practice! That way you can just boil everything in one pot and not have to mess with cooking the celery root by itself. I did make one change - I added minced chives. Yummy!

This was great! Even my husband who doesn't like "weird root vegetables" and outright hates celery liked this dish. I also added a few jerusalem artichokes, read somewhere (on this site) that potato, celery root and jerusalem artichoke is an authentic Country French combination. I cooked the celery root and artichoke separately until it was waaaaay cooked (falling apart), then pushed everything through a ricer to make sure the texture's smooth. Mixed in the marscapone (even omitted the butter!), and voila, a fantastic side to just about everything (especially Thanksgiving turkey!). Will definitely be a standard menu item for me.

Great recipe. I used a different technique. I boiled the potatoes whole and peeled hot. Less work. Less water in finished product. I chopped the celery root fine (actually, I sliced it through my mandolin first), and sauteed it in butter with the garlic - and I confess, I also added some finely chopped fennel. This cut the cooking time in half and I didn't have to overcook my potatoes to get the celery root done properly. Just before serving, I added my mashed potatoes back into the butter w/ vegetables, added the cheese and some hot evaporated milk (for texture) and voila. Yummy!

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.

This is absolutely one of the best recipes I have found on this site. I, too, had never worked with celery root, as one reviewer mentioned. I've now made this dozens of times and what I do is make sure to peel the celery root to the point where it resembles a peeled Idaho potato, i.e. totally white, dark spots gouged out with the sharp end of your peeler. If you follow the sizes specified for the potato and the celery root in the recipe, the potato and celery root should come out evenly cooked at the same time. BUT...you can also cook them separately and then mash them together after (the celery root is very, very dense and does need to be pretty soft). Anyway, I think the combination of tastes is incredible -- very sophisticated and yet subtle, a wonderful starch sidedish to almost anything -- and it has become a staple in my home.

Fantastic!! I made this recipe for Christmas Day and everyone raved. To the reviewer below, you need to cut the celery root smaller than the potatoes. I used 4# of potatoes, 2# of celery root and doubled the garlic and 13 people licked the bowl clean.

Maybe I did something wrong, I have not used celery root much, but I would defintiely leave it out next time. I like the marscarpone cheese, and Yukon gold potatoes are a must. But even though I boiled the vegetables until the potatoes were almost too soft, the celery root was still not, and I kept finding unpleasant woody strands of it in my bites.

Made this last fall to go with Herb roasted turkey with shiitake mushroom gravy. I substituted cream cheese for the mascarpone. It was very flavorful and creamy. Will make it again.
