First let me say that these salads are just as lovely as you imagine them to be. It's a pity there isn't a picture for this recipe. I was stuck using ramekins since my store ran out of pastry rings and they still looked lovely. (But keep in mind if you prepare the potato part ahead of time and don't remove it from the ramekin that you'll need to reheat it a bit in the oven before you broil it--mine were slightly cool on the bottom). I left out the tarragon and chervil when I made these for a luncheon as many people aren't partial to them. These aren't nearly as much work as they sound like. My guests' reviews were out of this world!

Excellent recipe! I've made this recipe for friends with great results, definitely a keeper. Reminds me of a potato and goat cheese salad I had at the Coquette Cafe in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You won't be dissapointed, although fresh chervil can be hard to find.

I used to go to Park Bistro regularly in New York and this was my favorite thing to order. This dish is amazing. It's also rather hearty, so it's best in fall/winter.

The perfect starter for an elegant dinner party. Popular with everyone! I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and had great results.
