I made this (in January in MN) without the summer veggies and it was delicious. Substituted grilled aspargus for the summer squashes, otherwise did everything the same. I also made my own pesto (i'm picky about it) and didn't include quite as much vinegar. Highly recommended.

I don't have a barbecue so simply did the veggies and shrimp (separately!) in the broiler. Worked fine although I'm sure purists will recoil. Fresh veggies are key however, don't make this in February. Overall I thought this was a terrific dish, light and refreshing. A perfect summer supper! And leftovers traveled well for bag lunch the next day. Will definitely be putting this recipe in the summer rotation.

Sauteed the vegetables and added mushrooms, garlic, and shallots rather than grilling; also used feta which added another element of salty flavor; really enjoyed this and will make again.

Delicious! I found the preparation instructions to be rather confusing, so I made my own bullet-form instructions for the next time (there will be one).

Rating: 3
Very simple... very delicious. I have a grill but opted to use a George Foreman grill to save time. Grilled the veggies for about 5-min. at 300 degrees F. followed by the shrimp for 3- to 4-min. There is not need to salt and pepper the shrimp afterward. The marinade has plenty of salt from the pesto. I suggest you cut down the cheese in half.

I followed others suggestions to broil the veggies & shrimp since I don't have a grill, as well as to leave out the mozzarella (both good calls).It is delicious, and a sprinkling of salt really brings out the flavors. I don't miss the cheese at all. I am eating my leftovers from yesterday now... The dish has more flavor at temp rather than cold so I microwaved 30 seconds to take out the chill.

Great recipe - a little more complicated with no grill (did the broiling recommended by others) but worth the effort. I added a little lemon juice and zest for some freshness.

This is a delicious recipe. It was delightful served warm. I used a good quality pesto and 3 Tbsp was sufficient. As recommended by other people I substituted the vinegar for a total of 2 Tbsp rice wine vinegar and did not use bococcini cheese. I used a small amount of macedonian feta cheese and lots of barbequed vegetables - red yellow and orange pepppers, zucchini and asparagus. The flavor of the barbeque is key to this wonderful recipe. This recipe is a keeper.

Yum!!! Made times 4, w/2 lb orzo! Added grilled shrimp and bay scallops (don't overcook!), increased vinegar and lime juice, made 'herb pesto' found on this site. May try with goat or feta cheese as mozzarella is somewhat flavorless.

I know it's December. I know this may not make me the best environmentalist, as none of the veggies I used are in season, but seriously, this was worth the guilt. I was craving something summery to lift my mood, and this really hit the spot. It's incredibly easy and tastes sooooo good. I broiled veggies until charred and then broiled the shrimp for about 4 mins. I used feta cheese and cherry tomatoes, and it was fantastic.

Great recipe! Everything about it was tasty and pleasing. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and broiled the veggies for 12-15 minutes and the shrimp for 3 minutes (probably could have gone a little less) and it was great! Warm or cold, this is one to put on the rotation.

I used the full amount of red wine vinegar. What a mistake! That, with the tart lime juice made this practically inedible. Way, way, way too sour. I did not add the cheese, maybe that is why the recipe seemed to make more like 3 or 4 (not 6 servings)? This was not good. In the future, will try a variation of it without lime juice or vinegar.

Just perfect for a simple meal on a hot summer day. very easy to make, as all the ingredients are chilled at the end (so you don't have to worry about precise timing). We added some fresh asparagus- yum. I substituted little grape tomatoes for some pop. Very, very satisfying.

A very nice summer side salad. I don't have a grill so I cooked the shrimp, zucchini and peppers under the broiler. 2-3 minutes for the shrimp and 10-15 minutes for the veggies. Turned out great.

Very delicious and a great summer recipe. I made a few changes. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used seasoned rice vinegar. Instead of shrimp I grilled two portabella mushrooms and sliced them. I didn't have Mozzarell so I mixed in some grated Parmesan cheese at the end. The final change I made was a small handfull of roasted slivered almonds. I only added the almonds for texture. Overall, this recipe was delicious!

I was looking for a vegetable dish I could make ahead of a ball game to make fixig dinner after the game go quicker and this was perfect. I didn't have shrimp and I used prepared roated peppers from Costco so I only had to grill the zucchini and cook the orzo. GREAT dish that everyone enjoyed. Doubled it so I can take leftovers into work. I'll try Shrimp next time because that would make my complete meal ahead of time!!

Total hit. I read a lot of the previous reviews and I decided to cut the vinegar in half and that worked out really well. I also added 2 ears of fresh grilled corn and omitted the mozarella. I sprinkled the finely cut basil on top of platter and the dish looked like it came out of a gourmet deli case. Perfect for a summer BBQ...

Rating: 4
This dish is delicious. I'm sometimes a lazy cook, so I substitute garbanzos for the shrimp (also a cost savings) and I sauté, rather than grill, the vegetables. I also leave out the mozzarella altogether (again, so expensive!) and put in feta instead, which I find more flavorful. With these simplifications, it's a great weeknight dish.

The perfect summer dish! I agree with earlier reviewers about using a little less acid in the vinaigrette; one tablespoon less vinegar did it for me. I also substituted feta for the mozz and added kalamatas. So delicious!

Great summer recipe. Exactly what I was looking for as I pondered the basil, zucchini and tomatoes on the vine in my garden. Didn't take long to make, including making homemade pesto, and the result was fresh and delicious. Served it with an inexpensive Trebbiano d'Abruuzo (white) and it hit the spot.

This is a wonderful recipe! I felt my pesto that I purchased was a little wimpy so I kicked it up a bit with more garlic and fresh basil and parmesan cheese.

Oops, hit submit too soon! Also wanted to mention that it makes a ton of food. Would make a lovely cummer BBQ dish. Also, I agree with the comment that it would be good with feta, but was very excited to make it with my first very own home-made mozzarella. Thank you Ricki Carroll!

This was great! Sorry, many people will hate this review because of all the changes, but...: I'm a kitchen-sink kind of cook, so added purple onion, a little marinated artichoke hearts, and garlic in the dressing. Substituted ditalini for orzo and a handful of cherry tomatoes, and most important, chicken for shrimp. One caveat: my husband and I agreed that grilling veggies & chicken really made the dish. I'll sometimes sautee for things like this, in winter or if I can't convince my honey to grill. Don't bother with this one.

I made this last night including a 1/2 recipe of "Classic Pesto" from this site. I substituted 9oz Brocollini and 1 cup Peas for the Zucchini and Peppers; zapped them in the microwave and tossed into the pasta. I think the vinaigrette could use less vinegar or lime, but I made as directed and it worked well on the shrimp. I added less of it to the whole pasta mix and instead tossed in the rest of the pesto and that suited me fine. Lots of great flavors and variety in this dish.

I tend to be annoyed by reviewers who make so many modifications the dish is unrecognizable, but I think I kept to the spirit of this recipe despite that I omitted the shrimp and peppers and used my pesto straight rather than creating a vinaigrette. It was delicious--the grilling of the squash is the main event here and really adds spunk. Will try with all the ingredients next time!

Really delicious! I did add extra pesto & basil, plus some asparagus and garlic. I also agree with the previous reviewer that more shrimp would be great! Made this for a dinner picnic with fresh berries in vanilla vodka, a lovely Rose wine, and lemon bars.

This is a great dish but, IMHO, it needs just a little modification. I add some kalamata olive slices and use a ball of fresh smoked mozzarella that I get at Whole Foods. Otherwise its just too bland for my taste. For simplicity, I cut up grape or cherry tomatoes. They hold up well, have a great tomato taste and are easy to find. There are never enough shrimp - start with at least a pound and a half. Im going to up it to almost 2 pounds this spring.

This was an excellent warm weather salad (as main course) or hearty side dish in the winter. The grilling of the vegetables adds a strong, hearty flavor, so much so that I paired it with a Syrah (Kokomo Syrah 2005) and it held up very nicely. I used grape tomatoes sliced in halves and quarters in lieu of heirloom because I had them on hand. I also ended up using stelletes (stars) pasta because it wasn't a bag of orzo that I thought I'd had in the cupboard, but no big deal. I would suggest a little more basil. A very solid dish.

Have made this twice. The first time I didn't have time to grill the shrimp, so made it with cooked shrimp marinated with the vinegrette and it worked just fine.

well, I made this this past weekend - everyone loved it, many asked for the recipe. I pretty much made the recipe as written, with one exception - I made my own pesto (I think store bought has a weird taste) and at the end when I was mixing the salad it did taste a bit bland, so I added a couple more spoonfuls of pesto until I was happy with the flavor.So I guess mine was more pesto than the vinegrette. I did like how the shrimp tasted after marinating in the vinegrette for 20 min or so. I cut the veggies before grilling and used skewers for them and the shrimp. I'll be making it again for another BBQ in a few weeks. As with everyone's comments about red wine vinegar with Lime juice and the cheese and fish debate - use you own taste as a guide - you know what you like.

This recipe is a keeper. I used my own homemade pesto but otherwise made the recipe as is. I'll try asparagus (grilled) next time. If I didn't want to grill the veggies or if I were pressed for time, I'd broil them in the oven. The texture and taste were very pleasing and the salad was also very pretty.

Made my own pesto, and used asparagus and summer squash (didn't have zucchini) - also had to roast the veggies thanks to a grill malfunction. Delicious, fresh, easy, nice Summer dish. Served it with a fun Stag's Leap Sauvignon Blanc ... Would definitely make again. Grown- ups and kids alike had seconds.

Wow! Lots of anxiety here. This is a nice recipe and lovely warm weather meal. Like Freshcape I was concerned by the combination of red wine vinegar and pesto so, I made the pesto sauce without it (did use it on the veggies tho) and tasted the sauce. I found it was good with just the lime and oil so, I left it at that. I will make this again - including the Mozz cheese :-).

I made this for an evening picnic to serve 4, and everyone enjoyed it--no leftovers, always a good sign. I followed this recipe to the letter except for roasting the veggies and shrimp (no grill). I am sure there is some 'grill taste' missing that would have added to the dish, but it was really good w/the oven roasting. Also used 8 oz. of fresh mozzarella perlini, thought it would be easier to mix in that way. It was!

SCRUMTIOUS! A MUST TRY! I used homemade pesto since I had an abudance of basil and I think that definately added a nice freshness to the dish. Would definately make again and again.

I have made this recipe twice now and think its fantastic, easy and fresh tasting. I highly recommend it - with or without the fresh mozzarella (but i prefer it with!). People who live by outdated "rules" of not mixing seafood and cheese, really limit their culinary experiences. I studied cooking in the Ligurian Region of Italy where Pesto (with pecorino and parmesan cheese) originated and as a coastal region seafood is a common ingredient in many of their dishes.

Nice change for summer salads; I added sweet onions to the grill and agree that it could accomodate any number of vegetable combinations. Used homemade pesto, so my vinaigrette had plenty of garlic. We liked the mozzarella, but might try with feta or parm next time. Marinated shrimp in shells just because we like the smokey flavor when grilling shrimp, then cut them into bitesize pcs for the salad. Plenty for dinner and great leftovers for next day's lunch.

What a fantastic dish for summer! The vinaigrette is full of flavor & the combination of the grilled shrimp and vegetables with it is perfect!

Great concept. Agree with the other reviewers who found it bland. I added extra garlic, finely chopped red onion about 1/2 c., a dash of cayenne, salt and pepper and a bit more red wine vinegar. Also, I recommend leaeving our the fresh mozzarella - it's just plain odd with it's bland creaminess. It also can be done mostly ahead of time. And the leftovers were great at work the next day.
