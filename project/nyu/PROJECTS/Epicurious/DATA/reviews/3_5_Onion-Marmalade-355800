I made this for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. Don't get too close to that vinegar when it's in the pot! It was a lot more red than the picture from the cranberries but well liked.

I've made it three times, the first two time exactly as written (delicious) and then today with a slight modification (also delicious). Instead of white wine vinegar, I used apple cider vinegar and an extra spoonful of dried cranberries. Great with stuffing, sides. It's definitely a condiment, since its flavor is so strong (in other words, don't expect a side dish). A hit with everyone who's tried it.

This is an amazingly simple, crowd pleasing relish. I made it the first time for some vegan friends who came to dinner and have made it a half-dozen times since. I've tried a few variations - reducing the oil slightly, varying the types of vinegar and adding more cranberries. All seemed to work fine - and I now make this recipe with slightly less oil and champagne vinegar. Total cooking time is higher than what the recipe says, but it's still not a lot of work, just a bit of time. I usually have it cooking in the background as I prepare other things.

I added a few more cranberries. This was a great hit with left-overs and sandwiches.

This looked fantastic in the magazine, and it's quick, so I whipped up a batch. It's good- tart and a little sweet- but the amount of mustard seeds and cranberry was small compared to the picture. It also took more time to reduce than the times in the recipe suggested. It was easy and tasty, though, so I'll probably make it again.
