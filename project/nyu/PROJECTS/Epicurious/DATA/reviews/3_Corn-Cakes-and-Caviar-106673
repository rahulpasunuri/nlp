I've made this several times as an appetizer. Love it.

excellent with the changes suggested of more corn meal than flour and don't puree all the corn. Nice and crunchy with a good strong corn taste and lighter than I thought they would be. A perfect platform for caviar and creme fraiche. Be sure you get them good and crisp!

This is GREAT! I would suggest you note the previous comments about adding more cornmeal and pepper... These are great!

I made this recipe and also followed the suggestions of the Cook from MD, and then added a bit more corn to it, and my guests liked it better the second time around. I also cut the corn cakes with cookie cutters for bite size and they are great for appetizers.

I made this using the modifications sugested by "A Cook from Reisterstown, MD" she was right! The corn cakes had a sweetness and texture that made a delicious foil for the caviar. You should change this recipe and follow her recipe. A caviar lover in Virginia Beach, VA

A couple of things...puree only half the corn and leave the rest whole; also, use 2/3 cup cornmeal and only 1/3 cup flour..it makes the difference between a corn cake with sweetness and crunch, and one that is heavy and blah. On elast thing - add a hit of cayenne...wow! Now they were incredible!
