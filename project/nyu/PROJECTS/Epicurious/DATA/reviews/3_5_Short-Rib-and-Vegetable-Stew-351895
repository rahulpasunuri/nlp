I would omit the hot red pepper paste and fish sauce. Substitute sugar(2 to 4 tablespoons to taste) for the molasses. During the last five minutes of cooking, turn the heat to high and reduce the cooking liquid until slightly thickened.

This is a great dish. I cooked the meat the day before so I could take off the fat easily. I used turnip instead of daikon and had no red dates, so will look for those, but the stew was flavorful and delicious.

Very good! Caveats: I halved the recipe, I used chantarelles instead of black mushrooms (couldn't find 'em), and garnished each bowl with the sesame oil rather than putting it in the pot. I also quartered the dates, which was a mistake, because then I couldn't really taste them. I would definitely make this again, particularly if I can actually find the mushrooms, since the chantarelles didn't really add anything to the dish. If done right, I can see this bumping up to a four, but my particular incarnation was a three. I was also missing my usual sous-chef, taster extraordinare.
