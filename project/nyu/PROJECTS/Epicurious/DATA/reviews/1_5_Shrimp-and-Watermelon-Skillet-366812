3 forks with these adjustments: prepared shrimp and shallots as directed, season and remove from heat. When cooled, toss in cucumber, watermelon, feta and herbs. I was intrigued with the ingredients but not the process and, after reading the 2 unfavorable reviews, it occurred to me that watermelon should not be cooked, at least not in this dish. I'm prone to experiment on my friends and they were ecstatic!

I cooked the watermellon much longer than directed to create the syrup. That worked, but I didn't like the texture of the watermelon or the very sweet taste.

Thought id give this dish a try but it was awful. Tasted like shrimpy-watermellon. the flavors didn't go well together and it was very watery. I would not make this again.
