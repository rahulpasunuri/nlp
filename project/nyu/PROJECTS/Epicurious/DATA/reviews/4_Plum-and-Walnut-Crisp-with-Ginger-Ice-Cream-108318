Made this last evening and absolutely loved it! While I agree that a little more of the topping would be nice, I am not sure I would double it. I think the issue is more the suggested pan size is a bit large (11x17). I baked it in my (10X13) oval Le Crueset, which I though was PLENTY big. I enjoyed the ginger ice cream, but agree that regular vanilla would be fine, or even whipped cream. Fantastic summer dessert!

This stuff is great! I first used Elephant Heart Plums (kind of obscure, but really delicious). I also prepared it with peaches and it was fantastic. I have been using pecans instead of walnuts and it works fine. i didn't even do the ice cream, just a little whipped cream. I'm making it again (3rd time in 2 weeks!)

I used lovely ripe Santa Rosa plums from my tree and the recipe came out bitter and sour. Disappointing.

Marvellous dessert, but there wasn't quite enough crumble to cover the baking dish, I'd recommend increasing the crumble recipe by 20%. And it was helpful to use a mixture of very ripe soft plums and harder plums to add texture.

Reed's, the company that makes those awesome ginger ales sold in 4-packs at Whole Foods, also makes some absolutely delicious ginger ice cream with a good amount of ginger flavor and bite. I highly recommend it's use in this recipe!

This crisp topping is outstanding! Like other reviewers, I skipped the ginger ice cream but I was heavy-handed on the ginger in the topping. Yummy!

Excellent. I used half of the sugar in the fruit part and I think it turned out better.

Superb. I followed the recipe to the letter. I would double the topping next time....

We loved it! I've made this three times now, doubling the crisp part and not bothering with the ginger ice cream. A fantastic recipe!

Very good, easy and pretty. Like other reveiwers I skipped making the ice cream, but added quite a bit of ginger to the crisp (some to the fruit and some to the topping) to add ooomph. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for a family meal and everyone raved! I used the fruit I had on hand: about 1/4 plums, 1/4 blueberries, and 1/2 nectarines (peeled)-- it was great! I also used half almonds and half walnuts, which was also really good. I will increase the crisp amount by half or even double it the next time I make it.

Everyone loved this! Make enough for leftovers because it's good warmed up the next day, too. The ginger ice cream was fun the 1st time but will just use vanilla in the future.

excellent recpe. I WOULD SUGGEST ANY IN SEASON FRIUT and any kind of your favorite nut. I have just finished 2 helpings, "burp", and just put whipped cream over it, didnt have time to do the ice cream, which I thing the original recipe was hi-lightinging. Thank you to the "owner" of the original.

Made it with hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and didn't bother with the ice cream, and it was just fantastic. Great balance of flavors. In fact, I've made it twice already, to rave reviews. Yet another perfect use for my annual plum bounty.

I didn't make the ice cream, but the plum crisp was amazing. It's hard to believe how such a simple recipe can be so delicious!--great pairing of sweet plums with crunchy walnuts. I definitely recommend this.
