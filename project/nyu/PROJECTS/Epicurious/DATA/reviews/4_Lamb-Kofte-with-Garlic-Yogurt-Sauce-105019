This is delicious, easy and impressive - a great combination when you are having guests for dinner. I found this worked perfectly well in an abbreviated version, without the complicated spices. I used bread, parsley, red onion and the correct amount of Turkish red pepper flakes and it was terrific! I also left out the skewers - as another reviewer said, this works if you shape the lamb into loaves. For the sauce, I would recommend making real cacik, but the garlic to yogurt proportions here are right.

Turned out great! I fry mine in olive oil (6 minutes) and keep warm in the oven. Also I use leftover bread that I have on hand, not wasting fresh bread. Of all the kofte recipes I have tried this is the first time that I got close to the wonderful kofte I have eaten in Turkey and abroad. For spice substitutions look in your spice cabinet for the baharat combinations. I put in fresh mint from my garden, roughly 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp of the following: coriander, paprika (or more, depending on what kind you use), cinnamon. Dash of nutmeg and dash of cloves. For the pepper flakes just use 1 tsp of standard red pepper flakes (more will be too spicy). Put dill in the yogurt sauce & warm it in a saucepan before serving it. It must sit and get flavorful at least half and hour, and do not undersalt. Serve it with rice and sliced tomatoes and cucumbers (or Middle Eastern chopped salad if you eat it regularly).

Great and delicious recipe. Something to make it better, though...when preparing the meatballs, add a little dash baking soda and a little sparkling water..mix well and let sit a while in fridge...(a few hours would be ideal)..but even 1/2 hour is sufficient. When the meatballs are cooked, they will be nice and puffy and suuuper moist and tasty.

This was very tasty when cooked on an outdoor grill, but I DON'T recommend you use a stove's broiler to cook them. They splattered like crazy and the grease & kofte caught fire while inside the broiler and the flames it spread to the rubber sealing stuff on the broiler/oven door! Very hard to remove a flaming pan from a gas stove and try and put it out! It was a scary near-disaster! So I took off one fork for Danger.

I discovered this recipe one day as I was browsing thru my Gourmet cookbook. I went online and ordered the spices and made it with ground lamb. I used the broiler to cook them, and served it with Jasmine rice. It was really super!! I have to admit that I just shaped them into round meatballs, and they were so good. I was surprised that they had a thin crust on the outside. In any other meatball, I would have assumed that there was egg added that caused that, but this recipe has no egg, so I'm not sure what does. They were definitely a dish I'll be wanting to show off to company.

I tried this dish, it was simple to make, and very good. I have had a dish similiar to this made by my brother-in-law, who is from Iran, which uses lamb and beef (or veal) with onion, tumeric and garlic. Also I found out from him that you can make the "kabobs" without the skewers just make long "loaves" of them.

I haven't made this version, but I find that just using fresh parley, cumin, salt, pepper and maybe some red pepper works just fine for making kofte. You might try a bit of Sultan brand harissa sauce - it would add some spice and is also authentically Turkish.

I was really excited when I found this receipe as I love kofte, but can anybody recommend some substitutions for the spices that they want us to buy from their partners?
