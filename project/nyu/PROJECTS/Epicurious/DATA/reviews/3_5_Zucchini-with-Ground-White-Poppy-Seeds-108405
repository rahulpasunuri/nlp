This is a very popular recipe from the state of Bengal in India. As it is a regional recipe , it is not well known in the west. But millions love it. But this version seems to have more influence as it uses kalonji which west bengalis do not usually use. But nevertheless, thank you for posting one of the regional beauties. It is my favorite.

This is a bad recipe. Poppy seeds are normally used to thicken up a stew or stirfry. The most I've seen it used is in Indian food..as a thickener. The amount in this recipe enormous. It comes out rather thick with absolutely no added value to the taste. Just say no to this one.
