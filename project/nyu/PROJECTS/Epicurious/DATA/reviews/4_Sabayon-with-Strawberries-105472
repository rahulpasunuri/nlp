Have now also tried Martinelli's sparkling apple juice and Tait Farms cherry shrub ( 4 tbsp diluted with seltzer to make 1 cup). Both yielding fine results and demonstrating the versatility of Sabayon as an accompaniment to variety of dishes.

A most excellent confection. Since I do not do wine under any circumstances I substitued Welch's white grape juice with stellar effect.

At L'Olivier in Serviers, France, the chef used sabayon sauce over very thinly sliced fresh peaches srranged in a spiral on a square plate. He sprinkled powdered sugar over all. I took pictures!

Great receipe to have in your collection. Made one change used prosseco instead of port or sherry used it for a b'day dessert. Prossecco was great subtle but just perfect

Did not really enjoy the flavor. The wine flavor was too much for me.

I love this recipe. First time trying and making it. Will make it again. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla extract using Marsala wine. My friends loved this dessert and was a hit at the dinner party

Wonderful flavor and texture, and lovely paired with strawberries. My only revervation is that even after cooking, the mousse tasted waaaaay to alchoholic; I'd prefer a hint rather than a full flavor that knocks you over. Otherwise, an elegant, easy dessert.

Truly a simple and delicious recipe! I made this for a celebration with my husband and we were both very pleased with the result. I took goblets and filled with freshly whipped cream, sherry sabayon and macerated strawberries & raspberries. It was not only a beautiful presentation but also a delicious way to end the meal.

Fantastic dessert. Easy(took just 15 minutes for non-glazed version) and relatively healty. I used port and strawberries but next time I will try mixed berries and marsala/ madeira. Really impressive.

Hello SLC! This dessert is MY favorite--from Market Street Grill in Salt Lake. My brother and I have been searching for the recipe since we make a yearly pilgrimages just to savor this tantalizing dessert together! I'm surprising him with this recipe for his special graduation celebration and he is going to die! This recipe is easy, straightforward. TWO TIPS: use mixed berries-- strawberries, golden raspberries, red raspberries, blueberries and blackberries--it makes for a beautiful & colorful presentation. Add small scoops of vanilla ice cream to blend with the creamy sauce.

A full, rich taste when made with port wine. I used a tawny Australian port. Served warm over raspberries, blackberries and blueberries.

Very simple but very good. The combination of the juice from the strawberries and Sabayon is excellent.

A great romantic desert, don't go to so much trouble Fix strawberrys and the custards+ whipped cream Ahead of time and serve cooled. Use Cooks Whipping cream {it is the best} and whips fast. Serve in your best stemware. Very impressive, single or married. you can't miss with this one.

I haven't made this recipe, but I know it to be good: one of my favorite restaurants in Salt Lake City serves a dessert of vanilla ice cream, warm sabayon, and tons of the largest and freshest mixed berries available. It's to die for!

I made this basic recipe with a good port and some fresh peaches that I cooked with a little sugar, water, cinnamon, nutmeg & a little more port :) Then I layered everything with slices of angelfood and let the flavors soak together for several hours. It was a hit in our cooking group.

Well said, Decatur. This site is consisently interesting if only in the way it spotlights the ignorance of so-called epicures.

Who are you? Jacques Pepin would not misspell anything having to do with cuisine. Sabayon is the FRENCH term for the italian "zabaglione." Oh, and one more thing, although you might call it a "basic" sabayon recipe, most of us would call it a CLASSIC.

It's a very basic recipe. Though mis-spelled. the proper spelling is :ZABAGLIONE.
