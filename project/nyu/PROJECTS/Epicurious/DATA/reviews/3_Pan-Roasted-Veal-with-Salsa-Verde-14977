This was easy and tasted great (not like anchovies). I bought my meat at whole foods and all was well. Since you have to retie the roast anyway, you can clean up the meat then.

I made this because I got a veal shoulder roast for $1.99/lb on special. The meat was bland and none of my family would touch the salsa verde. I made the salsa in a curved cutting board with a mezzaluna and I thought it was great but my family didn't like it.

The cooking method was good but this cut of meat is not the most tender and has a fair amount of grizzle and fat on the ends. Because it is rolled you don't know what you are getting into until you cut it after cooking. I purchased the roast from the meat counter at the local Publix Super Market, which probably was another mistake. This is a cut you would want your butcher to prepare for you so he could work at cleaning up the cut before rolling it. Meat had a very good taste and the addition of the Salsa Verde helped a lot.
