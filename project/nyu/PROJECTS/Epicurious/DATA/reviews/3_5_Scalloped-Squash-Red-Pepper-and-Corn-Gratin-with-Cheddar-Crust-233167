Way too much effort for a sub-par end product. I only baked it for 20 minutes and the veggies still turned to mush. Maybe would be better without sauteing the squash before baking. However, I won't make again.

I only had mild cheddar cheese so added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and also added a small can of chopped green chiles. These added a mild 'kick' to the casserole. Canadian Thanksgiving for 13 and only a dab of this was left after everyone had a spoonful in addition to all of the other side dishes. And everyone liked it a lot. I'll try this again with sharper cheese and hope it's a bit more flavorful.

I know people hate it when you totally change a recipe then complain that it wasn't good. In this case, i blew this recipe apart using several variations of suggestions from other reviewers and it was GREAT. First of all, I didn't have red bell pepper or zucchini. Here's what I did: Prepared cheese mix as directed but used six pepper spice and a lot of hot sauce. I sliced prepared polenta and put in the bottom of the dish then covered with frozen spinach. I combined chopped and prepared to direction yellow squash, and some other kind of small squash, onion, anaheim pepper and frozen corn. For the gratin, I used panko bread crumbs for the bread crumbs. Family asked WHAT IS THIS... I'm scared! and it was so delicious there was none left. Great way to clean out your refrigerator!

It was tasty enough, although I would definitely suggest using a very sharp cheese and some hot sauce. It was a fairly labor-intensive way to use up that yellow squash that I never know what to do with, but it made a good main course with some broccoli and fruit. I don't know if I'll try it again or not.

I used Cabot sharp cheddar and it made a nice sauce but I'll add more hot sauce & garlic next time. Squash was mushy after baking so long so I'll also cut the cook time as it looked done to me after 10 mins. The fresh bread crumb topping with the loads of butter made it quite yummy but definitely just a holiday treat (unless I attempted to lighten it up). Husband loved it!

Panko bread crumbs added lots of crunchy topping. Used medium tillamook cheddar. Added a touch of cayenne powder and tweaked the spices a bit. It was really good, next time I'm going to make it as a veggie lasagne, it's very rich and could have used the pasta. Excellent base recipe that you can use as the veggie drawer cleanout.

I've made this 3 years in a row. I have tweaked it a little to add flavor and I'm not allowed to come to Thanksgiving without it!

A delicious comfort-food side dish. As with all recipes, salt/pepper must be added if not written into the recipe. This takes care of the 'blandness' that others mentioned.

I agree with the other reviewers that the flavor is rather bland. I made the mistake of using Progresso Italian Breadcrumbs for the topping, and I would not suggest it. The texture of the topping was all wrong. Progresso does not blend well at all with the cheese and butter and it ended up a powdery disgusting mess. I may try it one more time using fresh breadcrumbs as suggested by other cooks. I will also add more herbs to punch up the flavor of the vegetables.

This sounded really good with the cheese sauce but it was quite bland. I doubled the hot pepper sauce! To prevent the runniness pour off any liquid that has accumulated if you prepare it ahead of time and bake before serving. I used a whole red pepper,more onions and garlic to add more flavor........

Bland. We make a gratin every year at Thanksgiving--usually one of the root vegetable gratins that have appeared in Gourmet and Bon Appetit over the years--and this one sounded good enough to try. We were all disappointed, mainly because the squash are so watery that they dilute whatever flavor's in the other ingredients. Make your family and friends happy this season and bake a root vegetable gratin instead.

This is a fabulous way to serve vegetables. It tastes even better the next day!

I am not even a big fan of squash and I can't wait to have this recipe again. It was very flavorful and a wonderful vegetable side or maincourse.

This made a nice addition to the Thanksgiving table. I didn't do anything to change the recipe (unusual for me) and the dish went well with the other highly spiced dishes at the table.

I doubled the recipe and used a bit more of the hot sauce. Two of my guests would not leave without the recipe and one insisted that I e-mail it!

This dish sounded very appealing when I read the recipe. It made a terrific presentation with the gratin crust and all the pretty vegetables. However, I thoughtit was very bland. Perhaps if I had added alot of extra hot sauce, cheese and salt, it would have had more punch. It was not a disaster. All the guests ate it but I just would bother making it again.

This was one of the too many side dishes I served for Thanksgiving dinner!! But I have to admit, I am glad I took the trouple to make it. I was wondering if it would go with everything else, but I wanted there to be enough for my vegetarian son. Everyone thought it was a winner and it went just fine. I will definately make it again where it can star in a more basic meal. Thanks Bon Appetit and Epicurious!!!!

I made this dish to take to a Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! It's more appealing to the eye once it's been served and the pretty colors are visible.

Being a Californian of Italian descent, re-planted in the Midwest, anything with rosemary gives me a sweet reminder of Thanksgiving dinners gone by. Being a latecomer to a large family where everyone brings a dish to the Thanksgiving meal, all of the meals' pillars were staked out by other family members long before I arrived. The trick? To find a dish no one else would bring, that would still taste like Thanksgiving to everyone. This dish is it. Enjoy it at home, or make it and take it. Everyone will love it. (And the vegetarians in the crowd will bless your name!)

I would omit the dollops of butter on top of the gratin (before you add the topping -- not really necessary for an already-rich dish). Definitely use fresh bread! The topping got the most raves.

I didn't actually make this recipe, but a friend of mine did and brought it to our cooking club meeting. She was concerned about it because she said she thought it looked too watery, but then we tasted it! It was really good! There was definetly a lot more flavor in it than most squash recipes, and I know it was just from the cheese. Even my sister who doesn't like squash said we should make it for Thanksgiving. So I will take a try at making this recipe soon.

This dish was a hit!!! The crunchy topping is a must, without it, the veggies are just pretty good. The cheese sauce also turned out nicely. I plan on making this recipe over and over again. Next time, I'll add some pureed roasted poblanos to the sauce.
