This was just ok. Not too spicy and i would have reserved more sauce/marinade to put on after

I took an earlier suggestion and added Dijon Mustard. I also halved the honey and hot pepper sauce. (I used Tabasco Sauce in this one)

Rating: 4
I added 3 cloves of ground garlic and 1 tsp of dijon mustard, marinated overnight, and made another batch for basting while it grilled. This was absolutely fabulous. My husband loves spice and I'm more on the mild side, but the flavors were so rich and pleasing. We're going to try it on pork as well. This is definitely a keeper and so very easy!

I marinated the chicken overnight, and after grilling it was incredibly juicy and delicious with just the right amount of heat for me (I'm a bit of a spice wimp!). We will definitely make this recipe again and expect that the chicken will be tasty with some grilled potato wedges and a crisp green salad.

I used this recipe as a marinade for chicken and smoked sausage. I let it for about two hours and then fired up the grill. After it was done I sliced everything up and put it in a jambalaya. I used Cholula as the hot sauce. The chicken and sausage was amazing and the jambalaya was excellent. Awesome recipe for anyone looking for chicken with a kick.

We did the version suggested upthread with an additional 3 tsp of dijon mustard and 2 garlic cloves, and it tasted delicious. We used half-chicken breasts as per the recipe, and found that both they and the onions took way less time on the grill than 10 minutes. I think we did 3 minutes for the onions, and maybe 7 for the chicken. Still, if we're ever cooking for a casual meal for a big crowd, this will be one of our go-to recipes, it was super easy with an interesting flavor.

almost forgot....also added fresh minced garlic and worcestershie sauce

This recipe is AWESOME! I doubled the amount of hot sauce, added some tabasco, and broiled the chicken on low ( 10 minutes each side) The chicken was juciy and had a good bite to it. Next time I will definately make extra for afterward to spoon on top.

Personally, I was quite disappointed with the final product. No *bite* and certainly would not consider *spicy*. Grilled onions were wonderful (prior to grilling, brushed with olive oil and lightly seasoned).

The chicken quite as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was still delicious. I especially loved the onions. Why have I never thought of grilling green onions before? It seems so obvious!

Really nice and easy dish. I broiled it as per earlier reviews and then sliced the chicken with an electric knife scattering the green onions on top and drizzling remaining marinade. It not only tasted great, but looked beautiful too!

Rating: 3
I cooked this chicken under the broiler, and it had a great flavour, not too hot but still enough spice to liven things up. Definitely make sure to reserve some marinade for drizzling. It added a great sweetness to the chicken and onions. Served with grilled tomatoes this makes a tasty and colourful dish!

I added a TBS of honey mustard and it was great! I have always made this recipe in the broiler, and just tonight I made it on the grill for the first (and last) time, and now understand all the lukewarm reviews. When broiled, the chicken absorbs the flavors and spiciness b/c it's sitting in the pan with the juices, but when grilled on the BBQ, the juices burn off leaving you with just a very hot-spicy but unflavorful chicken. Go for the broiler (and decrease the hot sauce if you're not into very spicy) and you'll love this one!

Very quick and easy, nice mix of sweet and spicy. Family loved it. Instead of green onions I quartered red onions and drizzled with the marinade before grilling with the chicken - they were lovely and carmelized.

This has become a staple in my menu planning. My kids love it and it's so fast and easy! Keep an eye on the grill because it's easy to overcook the chicken.

Not much flavor and it had a hard chewy crust. What's with the green onions?

This was a wonderful dish and SO EASY! The next time I make it I think I will kick it up a notch and add more pepper sauce and paprika, make more of the marinade, and marinade longer. Fabulous!

This dish was delicious and very easy to make. I did add the worcheshire sauce only because I like it. Very tasty dish.

Rating: 3
This came out just right, I did make a few changes to it. I added a tablespoon of worcestershire sause and a lil more hot sauce to make it spicy. It was a hit with my boyfriend... he especially loved the onions.

Rating: 3
In order to save on fat, I put a mere half teaspoon of oil in the sauce. I added 1 heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and 3 teaspoons dijon, and my dinner party went nuts over it! My friend joined me in the kitchen to make a second helping!! The addition of the dijon was a mistake, and to balance, I added the garlic. This was the best cooking "mistake" i've ever made. I'll definately make this recipe again. This has become my (picky-eater) husband's new favorite!

Eh, it was okay. It would have been better if our grill had not reached 1000 degrees and burnt the nice marinade into char-wood.

This was very easy and I almost always have these ingredients on hand which makes it even easier! My husband and both enjoyed this recipe, it didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it was a just a nice, pleasant dinner. Those are sometimes underrated.

I found this recipe excellent. My wife is allergic to tomatoes, so almost no barbeque sauces will work for her. I tried this on chicken pieces and on baby back ribs and both were very good. It was just spicy enough, and we will use it again.

The chicken was juicy and flavorful and super easy. I used 1/2 molasses and 1/2 honey and cut the oil by 1/2 tbsp. This one's a keeper.

Great recipe. Easy to make on week night after work and still impress your guest.

This dish has been a staple for my family and friends all summer long; haven't met a person yet who doesn't love it! I let it marinade much longer (a couple of hours) to let the flavors really develop. My two kids love it!!

I have made this dish several times and I think that the secret lies in the type of hot sauce used. I use a Thai hot sauce-it gives the chicken just the right amount of kick.

This was very spicy but otherwise totally flavorless.

I used this on chicken legs, w/most of the skin removed, and adjusted the cooking times accordingly. Served w/a fast blue-cheese yogurt dipping sauce and a great spinach & fruit salad, this is a wonderful summer meal. Nice, buffalo-wing-like flavor.

I picked this recipe for its simplicity, and it turned out quite well. The spice of the chicken is really determined by the kind of hot pepper sauce used. I didn't make any substitutions and was pleased with the results. Great for a busy weeknight meal.

I really enjoy spicy food and also thought this recipe was bland and not worth the time.

Rating: 1
This wasn't worth even the minimal effort to me. I love spicy food, but this was bland. I even marinated the chicken for much longer than called for, yet it was still very bland. I'll stick with my quick and easy standy marinade of balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and fresh crushed black pepper!

I prepared this recipe as directed and couldn't get enough. The green onions were perfect. The only way to make better would be to double or triple the amount of green onions, or add mushrooms, other vegetables. A real hit!

Rating: 3
Excellent super-easy recipe! You can't go wrong with this one. I replaced the honey with molasses as suggested by one of the previous cooks, and everyone loved it! Will definitely make it over and over again!

Rating: 3
Very nice taste, however, it's better when you lose the honey and replace with half the amount of molasses. Serve with roasted peppers, zuk's, and mushrooms. Coat with olive oil and seasoning salt, grill as long as the meat.

I think this recipe is fabulous! It caught my eye in the slide-show and I decided to be bold and serve it at a 45 person family party. Yes- that's right- I increased the recipe by 43 servings- eyeing it mostly, but it was a complete hit. I'll remember it always.

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe. It takes just minutes to prepare (which is rare with a marinade) and it comes out great on our indoor electric grill. It has become a weekly stand by. The grilled onions on the side are perfect!

This recipe is excellent! The reserved marinade is the key--we couldn't seem to get enough of it. Try placing the green onions on an upper rack of a gas grill. They came out perfectly sweet and delicious.

Rating: 3
My husband and I make this recipe a lot. IT's very summery and looks like barbeque when served on a platter. We use Tabasco, and it's hot enough for us, especially with the reserved marinade drizzled over the cooked pieces. The green onions burned on the grill-- we don't bother with those anymore.

Rating: 3
I was concerned when I read comments that it wasn't spicy,but I used Tabasco Pepper sauce and it was spicy enough for us. I made a second recipe with ketchup instead of pepper sauce for the kids and that went over well too.

The chicken was very bland. It was definetly not spicy or flavorful enough. It tasted like plain grilled chicken. Certainly not worth the effort of chopping up green onions. Next time, I'll just put some store bought sauce on top of the chicken breasts and save myself some time.

Rating: 3
This is an easy, low effort, great tasting dish. I add more hot sauce to the marinade too. I serve it with corn muffins (made from a mix) with jalepenos thrown in and some cole slaw. I served this at a barbeque and actually ran out-something that has never happened before - people loved it!

Rating: 3
Although it isn't very spicy, the flavors are good and it's easy--a bonus for the weeknight cook! It looks like you spent a lot of time, and it is a change from basic chicken dishes. Beware: the sauce can burn very easily on the grill.

Excellent....simple to prepare. I used a mustard based hot sauce which rounded the taste off well. Served with steamed vegs and a garlic mashed potato, and people were plenty full enough!! Will become a simple mid-week staple.

My boyfriend and his family loved this recipe. The grilled green onions are fun. The second time I made it, I substitued creole seasoning for the paprika and it was great!

Would definitely make again because it's very quick and easy. Doesn't necessarily have to be cooked on a grill (could be done stove top). Not as spicy as it seems. The extra marinade was very tasty on some rice.

Made it last night and really liked it. Next time I will add more hot sauce to spice it up even more. It was easy and quick - a great dish for the weekdays! Will definitely make it often!

This dish was just so-so. I really didn't think it was anything special. If you are looking for something spicy and "good". Try the Fiery Skewered Shrimp.
