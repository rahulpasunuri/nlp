Following other reviewers, I subbed half the flour for whole wheat, scraped the sugar and salt, grated in an apple, used 1/4 c oil, added some vanilla, used 1 c milk and 1/2 c vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk and skipped the currents (my two year olds won't eat them). In the end still very tasty but also a bit more healthy.

I used all the substitutions suggested, applesauce in place of oil, one cup skim milk, half cup nonfat yogurt, whole wheat flour and they turned out famtastic, super easy, quick and delicious! the boyfriend loved them for dinner :) will make again!

These pancakes make a great, quick, healthy breakfast and are a great way to use up some of that extra zucchini. I also didn't add any sugar, but replaced some oil with applesauce to sweeten them a bit. Also, doubled the spices to flavor the pancakes well and added lots of zucchini. With syrup, they were plenty sweet and a really nice change from the everyday pancake. Recommended!

Excellent. Used dried cranberries instead of currants. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour. Substituted 1/2 nonfat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 skim milk for the buttermilk.

Easy, good. Used whole wheat flour and carrots (lots of carrots). Next time would omit the sugar and the oil

Loved it! I used carrots and raisins instead. I found the yogurt substitution made the batter very thick, so the second time I used all milk with just a spoonful of yogurt mixed in. So good!!

Really enjoyed, changed a little. Used non-fat yogurt and a little milk instead of buttermilk and added dried citrus rind. Works well with fresh orange juice.
