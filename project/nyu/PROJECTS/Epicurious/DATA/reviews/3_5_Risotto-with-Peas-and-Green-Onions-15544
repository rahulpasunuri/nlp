This was delicious. I used low fat/canola oil butter and fresh peas, added a little proscuitto at the end.

Easy to make and really tasty. I found it took more like 25 or 30 minutes for the rice to really soften up.

Impressive and easy risotto dish. Great combinations of flavors-although I may cut back on the peas by 1/4 cup or more next time. Creamy and rich with the parmesan. Everyone enjoyed.

Very good. Served it with panfried chicken breast with oregano-garlic butter (also from this site) and mushrooms sauteed in white wine.

I tweaked the recipe. Added a big clove of mashed garlic to the first step. Used half the butter and added two teaspoons chopped fresh thyme at the end of the cooking process. Basil toward the end would be nice. A very simple side dish.

I have used this recipe without fail so many times now - have altered it and made a wild mushroom and truffle oil risotto ( just omitted the peas and onions) - and also for a wonderful butternut squash risotto - baked the squash first - then cut into small squares - used cumin as the flavouring agent. It's forgiving as well - done too soon - add more butter (sorry butter police:) ..) or stock or wine - just keep it moist.

I thought this dish was not bad, but not great - I'd say it was a little on the bland side. Next time I make risotto, I'll make it with onions and asparagus...

I wanted to reduce the fat and followed the advice of other reviewers that decreased the butter with no problem. I used only 1 tablespoon of butter, instead of 3, and it was just fine. Found this recipe to quite easy and very good. Will definetly make again.

In spite of adding mushrooms, garlic and artichoke hearts to this dish, it was fairly bland and boring.

This was a very easy and delicious risotto recipe. I used some minced shallot with the green onions and also added some crumbled, cooked bacon. Accompanied by a big salad and some crusty bread, this makes a great, quick weeknight meal.

This was a wonderful easy recipe. I used long grain white rice because that was on hand. I did saute some crimini mushrooms which were a great addition to the risotto.

This is an easy side dish that goes with many different main courses. I reduced the amount of butter in the recipe to 2 tsp.

Very good. Would taste before adding salt as the rice holds the saltiness of the parmesan. Also added green onions towards end so they would maintain a fresher color and flavor.

Very easy way to make risotto and pretty healthy. 2 T. of butter is plenty - I added prosciutto and served as a weeknight main course.

This is an excellent and elegant side dish for any entree. My guests are always pleased with its creamy consistancy and rich flavor. I have also reduced the butter with great success.
