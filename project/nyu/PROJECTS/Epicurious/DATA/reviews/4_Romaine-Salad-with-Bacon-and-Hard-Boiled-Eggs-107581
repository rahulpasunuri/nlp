This hit the spot! Simple and i had most of it on hand. I had o use red spring onions instead of shallots.and skipped the extra olive oil. I will probably make it again tomorrow.

When I made this last night, it was delicious, even though I took a lot of liberties. Used bagged romaine salad, sweet red onion instead of shallot, and Oscar Mayer real bacon bits instead of frying bacon. Will make this many times!!

This is a wonderful salad. I have prepared it several times for large dinner gatherings. Every thing can be made ahead of time. As for the dressing...just reheat when ready to serve. Yum!

My family really enjoyed this simple salad. At first I thought that there was too little dressing for all the lettuce but after you toss it in well it is just the right amount. Very good flavor for minimal effort.
