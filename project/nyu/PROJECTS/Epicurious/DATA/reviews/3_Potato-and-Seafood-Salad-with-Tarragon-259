3 out of the 6 reviewers don't like tarragon and think they can make a valid review of this recipe. Why dont you just make another recipe?????

I've made this a few times, always decreasing the tarragon, as I am not a tarragon lover. I agree, dill would be nice, will try that next time. I've made entire garden party menu 2 different times (different guests) and received rave reviews, as it is a beautiful presentation when laid out.

Great "classy" potatoe salad. I added dill instead of taragon and loved the outcome. I'll be making this one again!

Instead of white potatoes, I used Yukon Gold. It is always requested at family functions. Unfortunately for me, there is never any left overs, so i always make a double batch

This was basically jazzed-up potato salad, and not so good at that. I think next time I want seafood salad, I will use a better potato salad recipe and add the seafood.

This is a good potato salad, but I'm not a big fan of tarragon. I think I will try it with dill next time. You can also vary the seafood -- smoked salmon is delicious in this salad. Use fat-free sour cream and low-fat mayo. It makes no difference to the outcome.

Since I like Cajun food so much I used Cajun seafood seasonings in the potatoes and to cook the seafood.Yummie!!!
