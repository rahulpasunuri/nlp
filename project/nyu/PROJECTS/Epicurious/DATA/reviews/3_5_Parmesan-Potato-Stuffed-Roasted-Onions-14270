I love making this recipe for special occasions. (It definitely needs SALT.) I've made several variations of this recipe over the years by adding roasted garlic, thyme, or rosemary with the potato filling, and even changed the type of cheese. It's a lovely & delicious presentation that always wows my guests and family.

Yes, this recipe is alot of work but, is well worth it. Terrific taste and WOW factor. Also works well as a basic mashed potato recipe without stuffing onions.

This recipe was terrible. It took WAY too much work & time, and turned out mushy. Looked like little pots of gruel. My husband & I sang songs from "Oliver" during dinner.

This makes for an impressive presentation. I also eliminated the pan deglazing with the wine, water and cream. Try using 1/2 parsnips and 1/2 potatoes and mash together before adding onions. Out of this world.

I agree with many of the other reviews. The recipe takes more time than it is really worth. You could simply do everything else and not stuff the onions and serve the potatoes as is and the result would be just fine.

wonderful recipe but a bit of work is involved! i used whole milk instead of heavy cream and skipped the scaping of the oil droppings the second time I made it because it's quite messy. a very impressive side dish for a special occasion. we also added some fresh basil leaves. we've made this 3 times...usually 3 days ahead. cover and store in fridge...pop in oven 25 min's prior to dinner! yum!

Terrific, and takes more time than work. I agree re: adding the sauteed onions, next time would still add 1/2 but not all. Definitely not an entree but makes a great hearty side with more flash than regular mashed potatoes. Looks fantastic on the plate. Vidalia onions worked GREAT.

Obviously, it is a very onion-centric recipe, however, I don't know how necessary it is to add the sauteed onions to the mashed potatoes. Being baked in the onions themselves adds enough flavor. This also was not the most filling of entrees. It was good, but not exceptional.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and it's a lot of work, but worth the effort. I've substituted regular potatoes, to no ill effect. The onions, however, must be mild ones.
