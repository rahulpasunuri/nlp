I have been making this recipe for many years and it is always a favorite. Many have asked for the recipe or will specifically ask if I will bring it when attending a potluck. I make the recipe as written with the exception of the fresh herbs. If I don't have them on hand, dried works just fine. Four Forks +.

I make this several times a year for work or church events and it is always a hit. Super easy and really impressive. The fresh herbs are a must and the walnuts need to be roasted.

I am surprised that there is so much variability on the popularity of this recipe. I have made it at least a dozen times for a party appetizer and everyone always wants the recipe. I do roast the walnuts and use more walnuts at the end than the recipe calls for so it is a little more crunchy. I also tend to use a little more mustard than the recipe calls for.

I don't have a food processor, so I mixed all ingredients by hand with a potato masher.... little chunky but still tastes awesome. It is a vert salty taste, so I agree, plain crackers or flatbread is best

This is one of my favorite additions to a cheese tray! You do have to rinse the olives well, but you don't have to buy super expensive olives to make it work - the basic black whole olives in cans from Costco work fine for me. I use fresh thyme, oregano and sage, and usually substitute toasted pecans for the walnuts. Love it every time.

I've been making a double or triple recipe of this for every party I've had or attended since this was first published in 2001! Use a great olive oil, and rinse the olives to remove excess brine. You can use dried herbs and also mix olive types. But I mostly stick to the recipe because it is such a hit!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I made it for a Christmas party. I doubled the recipe and there was not a bit left. I was asked for the recipe at least half a dozen times.

The pungent taste of kalamatas did not please me, so I added 4 oz of cream cheese. It tasted much better.

The walnuts added a nice, nutty flavor to a traditional olive tapenade. We enjoyed it very much.

This is an outstanding olive tapenade. I am frequently asked to make it for family gatherings. The saltiness balancess nicely with baguette or a water cracker. Goes together very easily. It's just delicious!

This was fantastic! I agree that you have to like Olives...which we do!!! My husband actually likes this on his sandwiches instead of mayo! And it is fantastic for wine lovers as it pairs perfectly with Zin!

I have lost count of how many times I've made this recipe. Wouldn't change a thing! I've made it for dinners, baby showers, house warmings, you name it. Everyone expects it now. Make sure you always serve it with bread...crackers can be a bit too salty for this spread

Easy and fabulous, a huge hit.

This spread was so-so, I really think there are better ways to use those olives, like a simple traditional tapenade. I didn't love this and neither did my guests.

This is a great crowd pleaser. We had a family party over the weekend for which I did the appetizers. Even the picky eaters liked it. I did add a few sundried tomatoes to it as I did when I made it before. Several people asked for the recipe. So easy to make and keeps well.

first of all i agree with the cook from colorado; don't give this recipe a bad rating if you don't like olives in the first place. recipes are not meant to make the main ingredient taste like something it is not. anyway, this is an extremely easy, fresh and delicious recipe. perfect way to mix up dips/spreads at a gathering. will make again.

I've made this three times as written. Some found the color unappetizing and kept asking what it was (with crinkled noses) but those who love the bold flavor of kalamatas couldn't stop eating it. I like a thin spread on crostini. I've seen a few coworkers really pile it on. This is so good and good for you. I could eat it all day. If you want to impress food lovers at your next party, try this.

My wife and I have served this at so many winter gatherings over the last three years. Served with warm toasted bread or crackers this spread is delicious. You need to like olives to like this dish, but the salt, oregano and thyme are a terrific flavor compliment to the toasted walnuts. It has been very popular at our parties.

I found this recipe to be so awful that I trashed it. Not even my husband, who is a human garbage disposal, would eat it. This spread was very salty, and the color looked very unappetizing.

Made a day in advance and it tasted great for the party, everyone raved about it, and the extras were still good two days later.

Wonderful. My guest totally enjoyed it. Even the ones who do not like black olives. I have made it serveral times since and each time I have received more and more request for the recipe. Highly recommend.

This is a wonderful spread. I've made it several times and everyone raves. Use good quality olives and don't skip toasting the walnuts! If you like kalamata olives, I couldn't imagine not loving this recipe.

I served several unusual dips at a recent party and this dip got all the rave. It was easy to make, had a great taste and was a crowd pleaser. You can also use this dip on sandwiches to add a little zing. I agree with the other review - if you don't like the taste of the salty brine of the olives, you will not like this dip. I LOVED it!

Yum, yum, yum. The little baguette slices were snatched up more quickly than I could replace them. Luckily I had sneaked a few the night before. I just threw everything into the food processor together and it was wonderful - I left it pretty chunky. Next time I'll rinse the olives briefly because it was REALLY salty. But no one seemed to mind!

This is one of the simplest and freshest-tasting spreads I've made, and everyone we know likes it. I make select few dishes more than once, but this one is on my "keep" list!

hello, excuse me, but if you don't like kalamata olives don't try this recipe! I, for one, like greek olives but it's an aquired taste and not for picky eaters. my point is, don't blame the recipe or give it a bad rating if the main ingrediant is something you don't like on it's own!

this stuff his horrible! the kalamata olives tasted no different than the little green ones with pimentos. the brine taste was overpowering. i guess if you like little green olives then you'd love this. but no thanks for me.

I use pecans instead of walnuts. They are easy to find in these here parts.

Call me wierd but I did not care for this with the type of olives called for. I will make it again but use regular olives and see how that tastes.

I agree with jeaniesa@earthlink.com - add more of the fresh herbs to balance out the olives. Most of my guests asked for the recipe!

This spread is fantastic! You just must use good olives! I was "craving" this recently, but only had a can of black olives in the cabinet. Tried it, yuck! Good quality olives make all the difference! I toasted the walnuts in the toaster oven for just a few minutes, and then threw everything into the food processor. Quick and easy!

This spread is excellent. Made it for friends and they loved it. I cut back on the amounts for the herbs since I was using dry rather than fresh. Would use the full amount next time.

This was excellent! Toasting the nuts was a pain, but it was worth it in the long run. I agree with the reviewer Jeanieas, who suggested increasing the fresh herbs. I will probably increase them by half next time.

Good tapenade recipe! It makes a lot so I split in half and added chopped artichoke hearts to one half and served both with baguette slices. The half with artichoke was less salty. I did not use fresh herbs but don't think that made a difference to the flavor since it sat overnight.

i'm slowly graduating from dishwasher to exec. chef in my own kitchen, and this recipe was exhilerating. i was overjoyed to see that it made no mention of peas. . . i love you kitten.

Beware, this stuff is addictive. Liked it better than any tapanade (with anchovies) and I have never met an anchovy I didn't like. The secret ingredient is the toasted walnuts. May I have more please.

Great flavor! I tried the dried herbs in a pinch and it still had good flavor.

Very good! A bit salty...I added some pepper to tone down the briny taste. I love the texture of the toasted walnuts. It makes a yummy sandwich spread on pumpernickel bread with sliced fresh tomatoes.

Delicious and so easy! And it tastes just fine with dried herbs if that's what you have on hand. I made it for an Oscar party and thought I should have probably halved it. Today I'm eating the leftovers and cursing the fact that there's not more!

this sounds like a wonderful recipe but my wife says to leave out the walnuts and put in chopped tomatoes.

Simple to make and well received. The toasted nuts make the difference. I like to toast them ahead but mix in at the last minute to keep the crunch.

This is a quick recipe to make and so far everyone who has tasted it asked for it. I used dried herbs instead of the fresh ones. It still came out yummy!!

I made this for a recent dinner party and it was a big hit! Served champagne with it. Don't know if this was an appropriate match but my guests liked it.

I have made this appetizer twice. The first time I followed the instructions exactly. The second time I used two rounded teaspoons of fresh thyme, sage, and oregano. The olives tend to overpower the herbs, so doubling them was a good idea. I added extra cayenne pepper for more of a bite.
