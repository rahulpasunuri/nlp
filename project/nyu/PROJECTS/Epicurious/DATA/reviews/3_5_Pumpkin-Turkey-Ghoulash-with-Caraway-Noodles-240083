This recipe was delicious! My husband and I loved it (and ate way too many servings), but I made a few changes to suit our preferences. I used chicken thighs rather than of turkey thighs, mushrooms instead of potatoes, and whole wheat fettuccine noodles in place of egg noodles. Since we were not "carbo-loading" in preparation for a marathon, I couldn't bring myself to mix potatoes and noodles, so I only used 2 cups of chicken broth so that the main part of the dish would not need a thickening agent. My husband and I have decided that this recipe should be part of our regular rotation of meals during the fall and winter months. I have two words for the cost-conscuous consumer: bulk spices. This recipe can be inexpensive, but only if you purchase paprika in bulk.

I substituted chicken thighs like many others and thought this was good for a stormy Oct. night. I replaced use of the plastic bag with a good old fashioned bowl, as it's better for the environment! I don't eat dairy, but whisked in about a cup of Tofutti milk-free sour cream (love that stuff!) at the end and it turned out thick and creamy. Added peas for some green in the mix. I loved the caraway seed noodles and will probably make them alone as a side dish in the future. Next time I will replace some potato with butternut squash and carrots.

We loved this dish, very flavorful comfort food. Used chicken thighs and portabello mushrooms in place of potatoes as many of the other reviewers. The potatoes would have probably thickened the ghoulash, so instead after it was done simmering we made a rue to add to the dish and that did the trick. I have never made a dish with such a large amount of paprika, loved the flavor but both my husband and I experienced a high level of nervous energy a short time after eating this dish, a bit of research turned up that paprika is a natural stimulant.

I thought it was very good, even though I used chicken thighs because I couldn't find turkey. I left out the potatoes, and used a few different kinds of mushrooms. I also added more pumpkin then it called for. I liked the clean-up, only one pot!

Very tasty. But I used leftover boston butt instead of turkey and sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. Didn't have enough paprika so added some chili powder. Will make again

very good. i used ground turkey from whole foods. i also eliminated the potatoes - too much starch. i may omit the noodles next time and keep the potatoes to make it more like a stew.

Made this according to the recipe and it was good, but didn't like the potato. Husband agreed that it was starch-on-starch considering the noodles. 9-year-old son liked it. Might try quartered sauteed mushrooms instead of potato next time, as one finds in some other goulash recipes.

For once I followed a recipe almost exactly. (The only change I made was that I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne to the sweet paprika because I didn't have any hot paprika on hand.) I thought it was excellent and my dinner companion had seconds. I would definitely make this again, and if I couldn't get turkey thighs (as there were none in the case the butcher cut me some), I'd use chicken thighs.

This was excellent! Perfect for a cold night. Really easy and only gets 2 pots dirty...so it makes for an easy night! Definitely will make this again.

Made this vegetarian by using two packages of seitan in place of the turkey & used homemade veg stock. Everyone really liked it, even the carnivores.

This wasn't bad, but I feel like it was missing something. I used chicken thighs and Spanish paprika. I might try this again and omit the potato and serve with rice instead of noodles.

This a great recipe the only thing I changed was that I use chicken thighs because I can not find turkey and I eliminated the potatoes because of the noodles

Good but too strong on the caraway, made it a little odd-tasting.

Just pulled some from the freezer and served as an easy dinner. My husband requested I go back, find the recipe and "file" it to make again. Deep flavor and very satisfying.

The mixture of pumpkin and paprika was delicious. I did not have turkey thighs so I used 2 1/2 pounds of boneless chicken thighs instead. Also, instead of the caraway noodles I used rice. Very tasty -- especially when eaten a couple of days later.

I made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and it was fabulous. I'm normally not a huge caraway seed person, but found the flavor complexity enjoyable in this recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I made this when the recipe last year for Halloween. Great way to start the kids off. The adults loved it too. Everyone wanted the recipe. I used turkey london broil instead of the thighs. Makes it much faster to put together. I also added frozen thin green beans for added nutrition. I left out the caraway seeds because I didn't think it would go over well with the kids (2yr olds) This will be my Halloween tradition for many years to come.

A good idea, but the recipe could use some tweaking. I made this for a dinner party and my guests and I agreed the caraway seeds were a bit of a distraction from the hearty stew. Perhaps if I had used a smaller amount than the recipe called for, they might have been a nice complement to the other flavors instead of overpowering them. Perhaps even adding a pinch of cinnamon would give the recipe that little something that's missing to tie in all of the flavors.

Pumpkin & paprika?!? I'm glad I tried it! I used 2/3 hot and 1/3 sweet paprika (Szeged)so it was quite spicy. All I had on hand were chicken drumsticks, but they worked just fine. I also added a red bell pepper, a carrot, and reduced the onion a bit. To finish it off, I topped each bowl with a dusting of dried dill and sea salt. Delicious! :)

Easpecially fantastic on a cold night. I'm sure using a better paprika than the ones I used (a Hungarian hot mixed with the regular supermarket stuff) would make this even better. Its the kind of homey thing that just really suits on some nights, and it is fairly easy to put together too. I just used skinless chicken thighs.

I used turkey cutlets and added some smoked paprika. It was a hit!

My colleague made this for a pumpkin potluck. It stole the show! Her trick was using smoked paprika from Spain with absolutely amazing results.The smokiness added a mystery and rich layer to the dish that may otherwise be absent. I also loved the noodles with caraway seeds. Can't wait to make myself.

This was a delicious dinner! I used sweet potatoes and yams in place of potatoes for more flavor and nutrition. My husband suggested adding some ginger to add more flavor as well! Will definitely make this again!

I found this to be very good. My only problem was that I couln't find turkey thighs. I had to use boneless chicken thighs, about 2 1/2 lbs.

I subbed red chili powder for the paprika and it was spicy, but great. Carrots are the perfect addition. Otherwise, yummy!
