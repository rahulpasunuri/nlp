This recipe was delicious! I used much less olive oil and cooked the garlic for a little bit before adding the prosciutto and herbs. I also cooked the spinach in batches so they were all cooked at different levels. The gorgonzola is a must and a wonderful addition. Definitely don't add too much salt, but be generous with the pepper. Enjoy!

Made this with fresh linguine and it was tasty, not transcendent. The presentation seems unnecessary, unless you're serving for guests, otherwise it's a nice mid-week treat.

Cut down oil and amount of prosciutto. Also suggest not cooking the proscuitto but just cutting it into pieces and tossing it in at end. Otherwise quite a good dish. Will make again.

Although this does not make my list of all time favorite pasta recipes, I rate it as 3 stars because it is so quick and easy to make and certainly tastes good. I used baby spinach and simply tossed it with the hot pasta until it wilted, making it even easier.

I made this as a side dish to chicken for a dinner party. Everyone loved it! I used bow tie pasta, cooked all the spinach rather than reserve some of it, and reduced the amount of olive oil by at least half.

We thought this recipe was awful. It was the only time we put the food down the disposal before we finished eating. The taste of the gorgonzola ruined the dish (and we like gorgonzola.)

Very good recipe. It had an excellent flavor. Quick and easy for a mid week meal. I recommend cutting some of the oil and doubling the basil.

Delicious! I made this for my parents who were on vacation for a week. They were very impressed and also very grateful. I added some cherry tomatoes and also used much less olive oil. It would have been great the next day, but I nuked it which was NOT the best idea.

I have made this dish often, but I substitute shrimp for the prosciutto. I buy cooked shrimp and saute them in the garlic, oil and oregano for about 3 minutes. I remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and saute the spinach in the same pan until it begins to wilt. I have served it to guest and it got rave reviews.

Again, as others mentioned: not so much oil is needed. Also instead of using the spinach raw that was added to pasta, I wilted it in the saute pan with garlic, prosciutto, etc.

After reading the reveiws, I cut the oil and the cheese in half. I also used penne pasta in lieu of linguine and it worked just as well. Try this cold the next day, it makes a great lunch.

Use high-grade prosciutto and you'll enjoy this recipe much more that I did.

Great, easy and fast dish. I think the next time I will add tomatoes or black olives to add some zest.

Too salty for our tastes. I never add salt to my cooking, so we are not used to a lot of salt. Definitely had to cut back on the oil. I couldn't believe that much oil for this recipe! The dish was not awful, but not our favorite either.

A delicious and easy recipe! I did cut down on the oil and cheese, and like everyone says, quality products are a must, and also omit the extra salt.

Rating: 4
I agree with the other reviewers about cutting back on the olive oil and the cheese. Delicious dish!

we both loved this recipe, I also cut back on th e oil and cheese, it really seemed excessive just in the reading, Can't imagine that much oil for 1 lb of pasta , and although i love gorgonzola it also seemed that that much would overwhelm. The best proscuitto is a must.

Quality ingredients make all the difference here.We use imported Italian prosciutto which has just the right flavor. Fresh pasta is also a nice plus.Frozen spinach would probably not work although in a pinch well drained frozen spinach could be tried.Also I used all the oil and used extra-virgin as well which enhances the blending of flavors.Freshly grated cheeses will also enhance the flavor and presentation.

This dish was wonderful and easy to prepare. I was tempted to cook all the spinach as one cook suggested, but was glad I didn't. The fresh spinach as a base adds a nice balance. Other cooks suggested cutting back on the oil. This is a must! I used about 1/4 cup of oil in the entire cooking process and would have easily been happier with the 2 teaspoon amount one cook suggested. No additional salt necessary. Choose your prosciutto carefully. Quality matters here (low salt would have been my preferred option as well.) A few minor modifications and you've got yourself a great pasta dish. Wonderful for quick weekday preparation, impressive enough to wow company. Yum!

Have made it 3 or 4 times and always by cutting the oil down substantially. (I used only a Tbsp to saute the proscuitto and other ingredients) and another 1.5 Tbsp to toss the pasta. I also cut down on the gorgonzola. 1/2 pound of cheese is a lot--especially when a strong cheese like gorgonzola can stand up with just 1/2 to 1 ounce per person. Made it all times this way--no one knew what was missing and have given out my modified recipe twice.

This is a great dish. I made it and my husband couldn't stop talking about it. He says it's his favorite pasta dish now and he loves good food. It was easy to prepare and makes a lot of food. It has a strong gorgonzola flavor which requires you to be a strong cheese lover for this meal. Do not oversalt this dish - the prosciutto supplies all the necessary salt. I put all of the spinach in the pasta instead of garnishing with the remainder. We love it!

I made this as a side dish for my family and everyone could not stop raving about it. One person said it was the most delicious pasta recipe she has ever had. I used 1/4 c. olive oil instead of the 3/4 c. and it worked out just fine.

This is really rich and delicious! Made it with bacon when we were out of prosciutto, doesn't quite cut it - too fatty. Great served with a simple green salad with mustard vinaigrette - was also great served with beer instead of wine! Everyone I've made this for loves it - have never yet had one scrap left over.

I've made this recipe twice and have been very pleased both times. My boyfriend loves it. I had trouble toasting the pine nuts without burning a few, but all in all a great recipe!

This is a GREAT dish and fairly simple to make. We don't reserve any of the spinach to arrange on the plates, but instead just toss all of it with the pasta. We like to use bow tie pasta instead of linguine because it's easier to toss. We've made this about six times and everyone we've made it for loved it!
