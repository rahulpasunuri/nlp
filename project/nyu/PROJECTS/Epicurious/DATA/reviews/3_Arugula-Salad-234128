I added some fresh ground pepper and sprinkled with parmesan cheese slivers. Wonderfully light salad with the robust nutty flavour of arugula. Easy Easy Easy

Yes, it's really that simple. If you want to dress this up a bit, throw some thin shavings of good parmesan on top.

I lived in Brazil for a short time and got hooked on Arugula there. They make an absolutely wonderful salad there ... which includes onions, olive oil, and salt. Does anybody out there know how to make this marvelous salad?

To the cook in England- Yes, arugula is also called rocket lettuce.

Is arugula what we in England call rocket?

Don't forget the salt!!! Arugula salad with any combination of fruits, vegetables and dressings of your choice is great! Use it in place of lettuce for any salad. This recipe is pretty bland but its a great introduction to arugula if you have never tried it before.

This is the way we eat our fresh greens in Italy every day. Try substitute vinegar, balsamic if you like, for lemon juice. My mother used to blend vinegar and salt in a spoon, mixing well with a fork until the salt dissolved, then toss the salad, and only then add the oil. If you dress the salad with oil before adding salt and vinegar, they will slip away from the leaves and the flavours won't be as harmonised.

Yes, I'd make it again, but I'd probably add a few things. The best arugula salad I've ever made includes the above and some Belgian endive, sliced longways with the center stalk making each slice a crisp, exotic flowery looking thing, thin sliced red onion to taste, and a handful of walnut pieces thrown in at the end. Also, I toss the greens and onions with olive oil and salt first, then I add the lemon juice and toss again, and last, throw on the walnuts. That's it. I think the contrasting flavors make it a simply incredible salad. Here's a tip. For really peppery, flavorful arugula, stay away from packaged "baby" arugula. It tends to be bland and sometimes almost tastes like baby spinach...bunched arugula is much more highly flavored, and the leaves have a more interesting shape, too!

Not such a fan of the clams, but for a 100% plain arugula salad dressing, I think it's far more interesting to blend the lemon, oil and zest with a shallot, a small garlic clove, a zip of red wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar, and about 2tbsp of labaneh (tangy middle eastern white cheese). A little bit of sugar to balance the acidity of the lemon and bitterness of good arugula goes a long way, imho.

Simply the BEST for arugula. I was so surprised - the peppery goodness shines in this simple and elegant preparation.
