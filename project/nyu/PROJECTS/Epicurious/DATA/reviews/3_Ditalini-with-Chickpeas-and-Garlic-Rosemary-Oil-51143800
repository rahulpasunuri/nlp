This is the WORST RECIPE ever. Should have known when recipe calls for 3 cups of WATER? Absolutely tasteless. No amount of extra seasoning helped. I have a fab recipe for "thunder and lightning" that uses chickpeas, pasta, garlic, broth, black pepper and Parmesan. And it is phenomenal. I tasted this recipe throughout and it is truly awful. Don't waste your time and ingredients on it. I would like to give negative stars, but not possible :(

This is just a comment on the recipe ditalini with chickpeas - one person threw it in the trash. If it wasn't burned or otherwise made inedible - less liked leftovers can be often turned into soup. I just keep with waste not want not. Unless spoiled/unsafe too eat no food should go in the trash.

I loved this recipe. I added about 1/2 TBSP additional tomato paste and about 1/2 TBSP red pepper flakes. The rosemary-garlic oil is vital to the recipe's flavor, so don't skip it.

Soo bland. Waste of time. I'm going to add sausages to it tomorrow so I don't throw it away. It's even bland in color too.

After reading the comments, I considered not making this, even though it looked so good in the magazine. In fact, I did a bit of research on pasta e ceci and noted that the recipes all were fundamentally the same, except that many took it to the soup level or " minestra." In spite of the reviews, I had to make this and knew it would never go into the trash because if I didn't like the sauce portion (pre-pasta), it could always be totally pureed and turned into a hummus or after the addition of the pasta, it could be turned into a soup, with the addition of chicken stock. No need to worry. This was delicious and I made this as printed, but did throw in about a half dozen cherry tomatoes. BTW, I only made half the recipe due to the comments, so you can double the cherry tomatoes if you like. It was lovely peasant fare, full of nuanced flavor, with the garlic and rosemary. Yes, I would definitely make it again because it is super easy and would make a lovely small plate pasta course before an entree or a great vegetarian main.

I don't love the rosemary in the olive oil, just garlic will do. The flavors are even better the next day. I didn't add all the water that the recipe called for, it just seemed like it was going to dilute the flavor. It turned out to be a good call. I would make again.

I agree that this recipe needs doctoring, so I feel a little wrong giving it 3 forks, but with minor doctoring, it's really good and unusual! I also like that it's a little healthy because the chickpeas add protein to an otherwise carby dish. I increased the veggie and parsley and tomato paste amounts that go into this based on the other reviewer's comment on not enough sauce, but left the chickpea amount the same. I felt there was plenty of sauce when I did that. I used a bigger size pasta than ditalini, and if I do that again, I would puree all the sauce instead of just part of it. What the recipe really needs, though, is acid! A generous squeeze of lemon juice on the pasta when serving makes this delicious. Without it I agree it would be land.

Made as directed, my family and I found this recipe quite bland and unsatisfying. Too much pasta to other ingredients, and not enough flavor. I could doctor this substantially, but then it wouldn't be the same recipe. Don't bother with this at all. Our leftovers went to the trash.
