Wow. I've used a package sauce in the past that provided a passable dish, but today i went through the trouble to use this recipe. The flavor is outrageous. Like i've had at very good Chinese restaurants. I used the classic ground pork instead of beef, and just used white wine in place of the rice wine, and used Thai hot chilies in place of the Chinese chili spice. Excellent.

This is a reliable recipe and the outcome was delicious. My bean paste was too salty so I used a salt-free bouillon and was told the result was not too salty.

Made this thinking I was using the other Ma-Po Tofu recipe on this site, which I've made before. They're both delicious--it's close, but I think the other one is slightly better. Regardless, I'll make them both again. Absolutely addictive, and it's even better the next day.

OMG yum! Watched the video and simply HAD to make it right away. Prepared it along with one of my Chinese classmates (she supplied some of the ingredients and the wok) and we couldn't get enough of it! She said it was one of the best Sichuan dishes she's ever had, and being from China that means a lot! Didn't change the recipe much, only diff. was that I used more hot chili oil since I didnt have hot chili bean paste, a little scallion instead of chinese leek (couldn't find that at 99 Ranch) and used normal fresh-cracked pepper instead of Sichuan peppercorns. But, I'm going to try and find those soon - I can only imagine how they would taste here. Give it a try. It looks like a lot of ingredients, but if you just line up and cut it all up in advance its really quick and easy.

I have to agree with other reviewers. Although I cut back to half the amount of soy sauce and 1/3 less oyster sauce, it was still too salty. I used non salted chicken stock as well. Comparing to Iron Chef Chen's mapo tofu, this one was below it. I also added some water to make the recipe more saucy.

Great dish. Layers of heat flavors that make it unique. Agree with the reviews that cite too much salt and cut back on the soya sauce.

I used Hoisin sauce instead of oyster sauce, only light soy sauce, and quadrupled the ground meat. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was very tasty, and not too salty.

This is an excellent recipe from Chef Cheng. To cut down the level of saltiness, adjust the amount of hot bean sauce and black bean sauce, use 'reduced salt soya sauce, cut out the use of the dark soya sauce altogether (and even the light one if necessary). The black bean and hot bean sauce will compensate for these two ingredients. Enjoy!

Of course, you need to adjust the amount of the hot bean sauce to the amount of meat, avoid using the dark soya sauce, and/or use 'reduced salt soya sauce' to cut down on the saltiness. You may wish to cut down entirely on the soya sauce if you use oyster sauce. HOwever, this is an excellent recipe by Chef Cheng.

TOO SALTY!!! This was unbelievably salty. It tasted like pure paste rather than a sauce. I'll try the other recipe next time.

I loved this recipe. I used chili flakes for the asian chili powder because that is what I had on hand. It was very spicy but I can handle the heat. I realised after finishing the dish that I forgot to add the soy sauce, which I think you could omitt because the dish has plenty of salt from the black bean and hot bean paste. Had this with sticky rice. Next time I think I will serve this on a bed of Napa cabbage. Absolutley delicious!!!

Because there were several exotic ingredients in this recipe, I omited them. I'm sure that if I had used all the proper ingredients, it would be a four-fork rating. The hot bean paste is the key to this dish (I found a Ma-Po Tofu recipe on the product jar that had fewer ingredients), and I will use it in more of the Asian dishes I prepare. I served it with brown rice and lettuce leaves, which helped with the heat. Spicy!
