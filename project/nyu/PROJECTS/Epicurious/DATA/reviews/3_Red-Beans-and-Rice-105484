I looked at several red bean/rice recipes and liked the combination of ingredients in this one the best, and wasn't disappointed. I did add some bay leaves and thyme and that boosted the flavor; will try adding a little brown sugar and salt next time. An excellent one-dish winter meal, perfect to celebrate Mardi Gras!

I really liked this. I left out the hot sauce namely because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my kids. I also sprinkled some cheddar cheese over the top along with the sour cream. My husband and kids didn't like it as much as I did so it will be something I make and keep in the fridge to warm up for lunches.

Just made this, with one major modification and a few minor ones: the first is that instead of tomato sauce, I used something my father made which my mom thinks is too sour (she said it was a jam or something but the taste, colour and texture tells me it's applesauce with barberries blended in) which I think is mostly sweet, which really changes the taste of the dish (it's quite sweet but nice, used it because it's late, I'm tired, and I was too lazy to find a can of tomato sauce, which probably would have been boring anyway). As usual I added an extra clove of garlic (I have recently started doing this with every recipe I use because you can never taste it anyway and usually it takes a long time for me to use up the garlic that comes in packages of three. Besides, everyone should eat more garlic). I was scared of the chili powder bit (I don't mind spice but my husband has a lower tolerance for it than I do) so this is what I did: I used the 1 teaspoon of paprika and 1 teaspoon cayenne (what's chili powder anyway?!), then, going on another user's suggestion, I added one teaspoon of cumin and another of oregano. I didn't add water but used the cooking liquid from beans that I had cooked (didn't have enough so ended up adding a 19 ounce can of beans anyway). I also used a hot sauce that my dad made which is basically pure peppers (not tabasco which is mostly vinegar I think). The end result is a tasty, if unusual, dish (btw the "applesauce" I have is probably closest in flavour to plum sauce). Quick easy weeknight dish.

CHILI POWDER? Red Beans & Rice is a Southern American classic, not a Mexican or Southwestern dish. Look elsewhere for an authentic recipe!

Great recipe, worthy of 3 forks ("delicious". My only changes were to leave out the green pepper (didn't have one), and use 1/2 tsp smoked hot paprika to replace half of the "regular" paprika. I didn't think it was bland at all - it did need some salt to bring out the flavors since the chili powder I used was salt-free Medium-Hot Chili Powder from Penzey's. I love rice & beans, and this recipe was no exception.

I made this exactly as written and it was just SO BLAND. I can understand why many reviewers opted to add meat and additional spices. This recipe requires a lot of modifications to be palatable.

Very easy and oh-so-satisfying. I recommend adding about a pound of diced, browned andouille sausage for extra yum-factor.

yeah right this is not even it. you are missing so many spices and that chili powder is not it - you are not making chili - bleh its a start but your gotta werkonit

This was pretty darn good, and quick to make too. It is really satisfying for a veggie dish, but I missed the "smokey" flavor I was craving. Not a huge chipotle fan so I may try some liquid smoke next time. Added celery and red wine vinegar at the end.

I thought this was pretty good. I used chipotle tabasco sauce. I liked it better when I added a bit of sugar to it, but that may have to do with the quality of my tomato sauce (generic canned pureed toms). This was a very quick meal and went well with some pepper jack-cornbread.

This is a solid red bean recipe. I started with dry beans which I think taste better and are very economical but do make this take longer. I used 1 pound of dry beans. Added juice of 1 lime and a few dashes of worschestire sauce. Ate it over baked potatos b/c that's what we had, but will eat leftovers over rice. Yum but not stellar enough for 4 stars.

This was good, healthy, easy. However, it makes sense if it doesn't work for you -- there's several variables that could change the end product for anyone: "chili powder" means different things to different people. I've also found that different brands of beans have very different flavors and salt contents. The moral of the story? Taste it and season as appropriate. Does it need "something" but it seems spicy enough, salty enough? Try adding a capful of vinegar.

I think this is great as a basic dish. As the intro says, use what you have on hand. I was out of tomato sauce, so substituted 1cup canned, petite-diced tomatoes. To add the smoky flavor of sausage or ham, I added some diced, vegetarian "bacon" after the tomatoes had liquified. For an extra dimension, I add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce, then, just before serving, some chopped, fresh parsley. Delicious, satisfying, and a healthy alternative to my meatier version!

I thought this a tasty recipe as is and even better the second time when I tried the chipotle version. I also upped the spices the second time...and in response to the cook from London, no, you cannot smack anyone for adjusting a recipe to his/her own taste. The fact that an original recipe is vegetarian does not sanctify it or make it holy. How many recipes have you modified with tofu or the like to make them vegetarian?

Easy recipe. Added a cup of diced celery with the onion, and substituted 1/2 of the paprika with smoked paprika to get that smoky flavor.

I was actually ecstatic after making this recipe. I really loved it. My family recently went vegetarian, and we are having a very hard time finding satisfying meals, that we all like, we dont find the food to be "weird" etc. To the point that I almost just broke down and bought meat today. Instead, I tried this recipe, I don't even like Kidney beans, and I was really pleasantly surprised to find this was really very good. I didnt miss meat! (and I suspect alot of the lesser reveiws may be coming from folks who really do like meat - I think for vegetarians this is a satisfying meal, and for meat eaters, a nice side)

i gave it 3 forks because it was quick and easy. it's missing something though... not sure what. it makes a good base recipe to experiment with.

I will probably make this again and again, as it's dead quick and easy, and super-healthy. I made several changes and the end result was delicious: I replaced the regular tomato sauce with store-bought spicy tomato sauce and used more of it; I skipped the chili powder altogether but added a good amount of oregano and cumin powder; I used red peppers instead of green and I used basmati rice; finally, and this is what I think made the big difference, I skipped the hot sauce and added nearly half a teaspoon of good-quality chipotle chile powder. Not really the original recipe, but yum.

Can I just smack everyone who suggested adding chicken or sausage as a way to improve a recipe described as a "VEGETARIAN Classic"?

Rating: 3
I added sausage as well and cooked my rice in chicken stock rather than water. I loved it.

Taking heed of some other people who found the dish bland, I made the following changes: 1. Used Barilla jarred tomato sauce. Start with a tasty sauce, get a tasty result. 2. Added three tablespoons chicken boullion powder. 3. Added some chopped jalapeno peppers. 4. Added large red pepper. 5. LOTS of dashes of hot sauce. 6. 1 medium carrot, diced 7. 1 cup of cooked, browned chicken pieces Deeeeelish. Would definitely make again -- low glycemic recipe that's tasty and nutritious.

This would be much better with sausage added.

Didn't taste like red beans and rice like they make in the south. Maybe because there was no meat.

Something was definately missing from this recipe. For all the heat of the chipotle chilies it was rather bland.

This was delicious, and one of the few red beans and rice recipes i could find that didn't have meat in it. i used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of the tomatoe sauce. the chipotle chili gives it a nice spicy kick. my meat-eating family loved it as well.

Excellent! Not jaw-droppingly fabulous, but a great dish for everyday dinner (and for lunch the next day.)

I made this last night, my husband and I loved it. I added 1/2 lb. of sweet Italian sausage and traded one can of kidney beans for 1 can of great northern beans. Served over white jasmine rice. Great for week night fare. Will make it again and again.

I thought this was very good. We're not vegetarian, so I added crumbled sausage to it, which made it all the tastier - but I know I'd enjoy it meatless, as well.

We made a few changes. Added cumin, oregano, corriander, garlic and onion powder, and about another cup to a cup and a half of water. We also substituted red peppers for the green, and 5.5 oz of tomato paste instead of sauce. Still, even with all the spices, it was still lacking one, identifyable flavour or taste.

I love this recipe and it has become a staple in our house. I was looking for vegetarian dishes that my husband would like and he went nuts over this one. The sour cream makes it even better!

very good dish i used all goya products which adds some spice of its own.

Super-quick and tasty, just nothing to write home about. Using the food processor allowed to make the whole dish in the time it took my husband to shower, but the peppers ended up a little too mushy.
