So easy--so good. And in about the time it takes to make preservative laden frozen fries from a bag. Next time I will add some smoked paprika when I toss the potatoes with the garlic and oil.

Fantastic fries....I made them as a side for a dinner party for the kids, but the adults gobbled them up. Made as written, but baked longer than 30 minutes to get some extra crunch. Will definitely make a again.

No need for a deep fryer. I have made these many times over. They are delicious, especially with freshly made mayo for dipping!

These were delicious. I made them with the coffee rub burger also on this site. They turned out delicious and crispy, tossing in olive oil and garlic at the end was crucial to the flavor. I didn't have time to use fresh garlic so I used minced in a jar but will use fresh next time as that will have more of that good garlicky flavor

So quick to make... Loved this recipe. I added store bought 'garlic butter' to the recipe and melted it. I always make these now

Just as good as the real thing, and probably a little healthier. I had great results cutting the potatoes thicker and roasting them on my gas grill. The house smelled like the ballpark - it was awesome!

Delicious! Baking the fries at the high temperature really does make them nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. You won't miss the fryer. Now any time an idea for a starch is needed, my husband pipes up and says, "garlic fries!"

Very easy to put together, the tossing was a challenge after taking them out of the oven, found that if you get them crispy, it is easier to toss. Give yourself plenty of time, takes longer that the 30 minutes. The flavors were awesome.

My daughters and I loved these fries! I made them tonight with our tilapia, and they were quick, easy, and delicious. I used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh, and it worked just fine. Next time I'll plan ahead better and get fresh - I'll definitely be making these again soon for the rest of the family!

Very simple recipe with endless variations. I cooked mine on the grill like a good Texan. Placed on the grill when I fired up the BBQue--by the time the grill's temp was ready for the meat, the garlic fries were almost done.

A great tasting alternative to the fried in oil variety. Exceptional garlic taste with decent crunch. Try it with truffle salt and you'll add a whole new dimension to the flavor.

Excellent. Great taste, would go well with steaks, burgers, etc.. Nice to know they are lighter on the calories then fries.

Haven't tried to make these yet but plan to. They do sound yummy and simple to make. But I think the name should be changed to Gilroy Garlic Fries. As in Gilroy, California (70 miles from SF), the home of the annual Garlic Festival and fries like these are served there every year. YUMMY!
