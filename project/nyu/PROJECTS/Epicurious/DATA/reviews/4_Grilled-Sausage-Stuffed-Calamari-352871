I used Aidell's garlic & artichoke sausages (casing removed but kept the sausage shape. Piece of cake to stuff. So I didn't use the spicing, but everything else was as written, except I always use panko breadcrumbs. I followed the cook who seared and baked them, which I think is better for large squid (more danger of charring). YUMMY! One of those..experiments that I wished I had a dinner party to enjoy. Hubby & I were thrilled and will add this to our favorites.

Wonderful recipe. Easy to stuff by rolling a tube of sausage and sliding it inside. The sausage really does puff up and fill the cavity.

Perfect! No problems stuffing the squid when I used the method of rolling a tube a bit smaller than the squid. It does puff up and fill the cavity completely. I grilled it on a cast iron grill that sits over my gas burners as it was a cold 2 degrees the night I made it. Everybody loved it. I can see great ideas for presentation, even perhaps making coins of the slices of stuffed squid. I served mine along with a mushroom ragout and some mini heirloom tomatoes. Very nice! Will absolutely do again!

I upped the fennel to 1 tsp and used mortar pestle and 1/2 tsp paprika (used smoked, since I had it) Also dash salt and red pepper flake My pork was hand ground tenderloin ends and my bread crumbs were homebaked french bread (kept in freezer) I only used 1/2 cup crumbs and enough milk to soften. No reason to use whole milk--2% or 1% should have no effect--it's stuffing. My squid was pretty small but mixed the stuffing, put in sturdy zipbag and squeezed thru small corner cut. Worked like a charm to stuff. No mess/fuss. Will try again w/maybe more of Asian twist and dipping sauce. The comment about basting sausage from inside is silly. You'd really need a lot of fatty sausage and no crumbs to do that. The stuffing absorbs the fat and makes "basting" from within moot. Promising recipe to tinker with and improve.

Excellent! Just follow the advice of other reviewers and double the fennel and garlic. Cook a tiny bit of the stuffing in a small skillet to check the seasoning before stuffing the squid. Also, rolling the stuffing is a great tip. I didn't have any trouble. I think the pastry bag would just add more mess.

I made this tonight and have to give the idea four forks. Its a great taste treat. I experienced problems stuffing the calamari and wish I had read all the reviews before I started cooking. My Calamari were sweet little ones and almost impossible to fill using the spoon method suggested.After nine attempts, I gave up and opted for another method. I placed tin foil on the grill -the calamari and left over sausage were cooked separately - at a point I put the calamari directly on the grill and ensured there was sufficient olive oil for their baking on the grill.. I also grilled a few green onions at the same time. The final plate had a bed of Italian sausage based upon the ideas here with Calamari hosting an almost perfect pairing of foods.The grilled onions made the presentation quite interesting.. Next time, I'll get the big calamari

Made this recipe last night for my friends and it was a HUGE hit! Instead of grilling, I pan seared and finished off in the oven at 350F for about 10 minutes. Before throwing in the oven , I deglazed the pan with some Sherry and threw some shallots in there. Let the pan sit for a few minutes once you remove from the oven; don't be afraid to undercook. My friends helped me stuff the squid, so we took turns and everyone had fun. I definitely recommend this dish if you want to try something different!

I was really excited about this recipe- what can get better than sausage stuffed squid? I was disappointed. It was just okay. I would rather grill squid and sausage separately and get good grill marks on both of them. I probably won't make this again...

I've fixed this dish twice now for dinner parties--as a first course--both times it was a huge hit--even among folks who wrinkle their noses at the idea of eating squid. The second time round--I seriously ramped up the spices in the sausage--doubled the fennel, added sage and crushed red pepper. One suggestion to the previous reviewer--who had trouble stuffing the sausage into the squid tubes: Take a bit of the sausage and roll it in your palms--the way kids make tubes out of clay-until it is about the length of the squid tube--with a point at one end--and just slightly smaller than the squid--then drop it into the squid. (I discovered that method the first time I fixed the dish--when a storm knocked out power in my area and I found myself stuffing squid in the dark.) Two other notes--don't overstuff the squid (the sausage seems to plump up in cooking) and definitely close the open ends with toothpicks--the end result is prettier.

Very tasty, sweet and amazingly tender...but OMG, what a pain to stuff! I bought the small squid as recommended, but got the fresh ones and cleaned them myself, super easy and well worth it to have fresh not previously frozen squid. I then proceeded to try to stuff them...that was not happening easily and I know my way around a kitchen and can cook blindfolded. One of my dinner guests suggested next time that I use a pastry bag with super large tip...think he is onto something. I will try them again using his idea.
