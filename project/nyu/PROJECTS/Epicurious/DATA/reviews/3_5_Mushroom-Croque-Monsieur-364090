Made it without the mushrooms. Very good!

This recipe was good but not stellar and not rememberable. When I saw the picture I couldn't wait to try it. I don't mind recipes that take a lot of steps - but for the effort that this required the results weren't worth it for me. For those making it I would recommend the following - under "toast" the bread at first. I had it perfectly toasted and then when I went into bake it the edges burnt. It took longer than stated to bake. I would also recommend more ham. The flavor of the ham gets lost amongst the strong flavor of the parm and the gruyere.

I don't think a panini maker would work, as the top layer isn't bread, but more sauce and cheese. It would be a mess.

I couldn't help but wonder if this sandwich would do well in a panini maker?

This was really delicious. I grated all the cheese and just distributed it evenly - I don't think slicing some of it makes a difference. I'm not sure it's necessary to broil the bread first; because you flip it over and bake the sandwiches broiled side down, the bottom of my sandwiches ended up very brown (but not burnt). Would probably skip the broiling next time and just put the bread on the baking sheet buttered side down.

Made this tonight for dinner- swoon. The mushrooms are a great twist on the classic and we added enough spice in the mornay to give the whole thing a good kick. It's super rich, and not a sandwich you should eat every day- not if you want to fit in your jeans anyway -but it was perfect for a low key Sunday dinner.

I made this last night, and ir's my family's new favorite - YUM!! I was in a huge hurry, and got the sandwiches in the oven in 20 min, and dinner was ready 30 min after I started. We'll be coming back to this one often!
