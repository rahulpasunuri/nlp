We tried this at Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. We love cranberries and over the past 40 years have tried many versions, cooked, uncooked, heavily spiced and plain. Hands down, we agree this is our favorite. It seems so simple, but really wowed us. We are making it again today with a brisket meal, not changing anything about the recipe except no parsley (although it looks better with).

This recipe turned out very fresh and surprisingly delicate. Actually that was my biggest problem with - it couldn't really hold its own at the Thanksgiving table. I really like that it call for any orange and the lemon and apple gave it a bright clean taste. If I made it again for another large or heavy meal I would add some cinnamon and nutmeg to make it a little more complicated.

When it comes to cranberry sauce, I was the one strange person who actually preferred the stuff from a can. However, this recipe has changed my mind completely on cranberries. The fact that you don't cook them completely changes the consistency, and provides a bit of freshness to the Thanksgiving plate that is definitely needed. I love the sweet and tart aspects playing against each other. It's also a fairly healthy side that is great as leftovers too. Definitely a keeper if you're not into the standard gelatinous, heavily spiced sauces that are so common around the holidays.

I thought this was tasty and tangy. I served it the day I made it (about 8 hours post-blend), and had it for leftovers the next day as well. I didn't notice a change in taste, maybe a litte more sour. I think it might be better with one more apple; none of my guests could taste the apple.

I loved this recipe and the longer it sat the better it got. I would make this recipe 3-4 days in advance.

P.S. I concur: taste improves as it ages. I tasted it right out of the Cuisinart and was worried, but 4 hours later it was already better and continued to improve over the next several days. I served it 3 days later, and it was fantastic.

Fantastic, super easy, different. You really do want to eat this like a salad and lots of people told me they normally don't like cranberry sauce, but loved this.

Really yummy, bright flavor. It definitely needs to sit overnight. Totally recommended.

I didn't have parsley so I didn't use it. Nonetheless, this was the star of the Thanksgiving day feast, and that's saying a lot, given that all the other dishes were a hit. My boyfriend raved about this relish, and here it is only three days later and I have to make another batch to go along with the dwindling leftovers! This is such a vibrant, fresh take on cranberry relish, literally. I'll never cook the berries again. In this dish, they snap, aided by the equally fresh apple. (I used Honeycrisp, FWIW). Bravo!

This was easy to make and tasty. I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I toasted some chopped walnuts and added those instead of parsley.

what a great alternative to canned cranberry sauce and lumpy, tasteless gravy! i added a peeled whole navel orange and the rind to the mix and the sweetness really balanced the cranberry's tartness. oh, and i made it the day before, which really helped merge the tastes. it was even better two days later on leftover day!

Love this! Fresh tasting sauce with just the right amount of sweetness to balance the tart berries.

I have been trying to wean my family off canned cranberry sauce for years. Last Thanksgiving I made this relish and nearly succeeded. The relish wasn't just a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner, but it went well with our Bratwurst on Black Friday. I'm on here to get my ingredient list together to start making it for this Thanksgiving. And I'll have to disagree with cashmere07, this goes great with Turkey. Mine turned out tart, but I wouldn't say it was sour at all. If anything, it was sweet and tart. I would serve this with any poultry or pork dish unless the dish was prepared with a glaze that would be a mis- match for these flavor combinations.

Easy, fresh tasting. We left out the parsley but will try it with next time.

This recipe is perfect as is. Add a bit more parsley to up the interesting herbal freshness.

Most definitely will do this one again. Vibrant flavor and a crowd pleaser.

This is an okay recipe but not with turkey. Sour and tart. I think the apples overpower the cranberry flavor. Would probably be good with vanilla yogurt. Definitely move on.

Great relish - used 2 Granny Smith apples - everyone raved - even those who do not eat cranberries! Very fresh tasting.
