This recipe has become a summer time tradition for us. I use chicken breasts instead of thighs, and we add vidalia onion and sweet bell peppers. I omit the bacon and add feta cheese to the pita bread. It is always a big hit! I'm sure I will continue to make it again and again.

The marinade IS wonderful since it really flavors the chicken after half an hour. In an attempt to cut calories, I omitted bacon but used Creamy Dill Dressing from this site. I also did not make kebabs but sliced chicken breasts horizontally to make them cook fast,fit in the pita better, and have better exposure to the marinade. I think the sandwiches would be too dry with just the poultry and mushroom mixture with or without bacon. Thanks to reviewers who alerted me to use a dressing. If you are out of cucumber, tomato, and other types of bread, this recipe will serve you well.

I made this for a party and it was a big hit. I took the suggestions and made the dill sauce. I also served it with flat bread instead of pita bread (flat bread is delicious and more moist). The mushrooms were incredible.

THIS WAS OK. I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT RECIPE FOR GRILLED CHICKEN SO I TRIED 2, WHICH I FOUND ON EPICURIOUS. THE CHICKEN WITH RED ONION AND MINT, WAS SO MUCH BETTER, SERVED WITH A CUCUMBER AND DILL SAUCE,YOU MUST TRY IT!

Loved the marinade...it was delicious! The chicken thighs were a bit fatty. We'd probably make it again with chicken breasts. And the cucumber-dill sauce was delicious with it. I will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! I make "creamy dill dressing" to serve with this and skip the bacon - the marinade had enough flavor on its own. I also just use the marinade for plain grilled chicken. This is one of the best chicken marinades ever!

I plan to serve this with Epicurious's Cucumber-Dill sauce (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=5754), chopped lettuce and tomatoes, tabouleh and hummus (both store bought). Sounds great!

In case of rain, you can easily do this under the broiler in the oven!

It was very good. We served it to friends and all of us enjoyed it. One improvement could be a cucumber sauce when serving.

This was a really fun dish to prepare -- my vegetarian friend skipped the meat, but enjoyed adding a variety of other veggies along with the sauce. If you don't have metal skewers, soak some bamboo ones (easily found in most grocery stores) in water for a few hours.
