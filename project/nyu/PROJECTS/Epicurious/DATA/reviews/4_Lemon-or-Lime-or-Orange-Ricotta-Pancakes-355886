I made these following the recipe exactly and while they smelled absolutely fantastic while cooking, the resulting flavor was underwhelming comparatively. Don't get me wrong, these pancakes are good, but for the additional effort and ingredients, I didn't find them appreciably better than my normal pancakes. I really was looking forward to these, but in the end, I don't think I'll bother next time.

Made with Bisquit and lemon zest. This was delicious and easy. Served with fresh berries summer berries and maple syrup it was especially lovely. Children and adults liked equally.

I love this easy recipe. I just use 2 recipes of boxed (Aunt Jemima Buttermilk, in my case) grocery store batter, in order to reach 3 cups. I've found that the pancakes are even more delectable if all your typically cold ingredients -- milk, eggs & ricotta --are at room temperature when you mix.

great recipe, astonishingly easy--made with whole grain egg-free pancake mix, and had little hope for it since i don't love the mix but didn't have eggs. These turned out great. Think they'd be even better with blueberries or raspberries, but were fantastic without them. Family loved them

YUM! Made the recipe as suggested with a traditional batter from scratch. The pancakes were perfect with maple syrup but will try them later with, perhaps, a fruity syrup or fruit preserves. There was only one problem -- I ate too many! This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! We loved them. We used "Best Recipe's" pancake batter and added a few drops of lemon extract to the wet ingredients before mixing it with the dry. Also, don't skip the blueberries. They work great with all the lemon.

It was pretty good. I used my regular pancake receipe and added some left over ricotta to it. no citrus zest, since it was for my toddlers, but I did add the juice of half a lime as I usually do to my milk for pancakes. Very light. Definately will make again and will add blueberries and zest for the adults.

These pancakes tasted delicious and I am not even sure I made the recipe the way I should have. I did not make the regular pancake mix with milk and eggs. I just put the ricotta in to the pancake mix. It seemed a little dry, so I added half and half with a little lemon juice since I didn't have any zest. They came out rich and flavorful!
