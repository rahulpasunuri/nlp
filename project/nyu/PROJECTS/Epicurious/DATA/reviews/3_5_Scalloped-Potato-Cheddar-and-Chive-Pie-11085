I make this recipe at least once a year and it is a huge hit with my family. I do add a bit more cheese, but you can never have too much! The only suggestion Ihave is that I add some of egg mixture to each layer as I go. I found that I couldn't get all of it to soak in from the top without overflowing. Great dish!

Delicious and easy. I used a 9" store bought pie crust, cut the ingredients by about 1/3, and did 3 layers (not 5). After 40 min baking, I poked a knife in the pie and it still had liquid at the bottom, so I poked some holes with a fork so the steam could escape better, turned up the heat a little, and cooked it about 15 min longer until I could hear it sizzling and it was not liquidy anymore. (Might just be due to our oven temp being off.) Turned out great and will definitely make it again.

After resting the pie for 10 minutes, I cut into it. Lots of water collected on bottom of pan. What did I do wrong? Flavor was very good.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I only did two layers of the fillings, as that was all I had room for. I used leftover frozen green onions (diced), pre-shredded cheddar, pre-frozen pie crust from WF, and hand sliced red potatoes. It could have used bacon (what couldn't?) but was a hit paired with a big salad, with great leftover potential. Will definitely make again!

Yum Yum Yum I made this for my fiance first (because I wanted to make it to for our family's annual Xmas Eve dinner). Total hit! I added grilled sweet sausages to make it a main course.I am clueless about making crusts so I used a good brand frozen pie crust and you wouldn't know the difference. Fantastic-I will make this for brunch in the fututre too. This recipe can be a base for so many different variations. Winner.

I've seen it time and time again. Why do people cut back on these recipes and then complain about the finished product?? Everyone has their own opinions but try the recipe in full first and then make the modifications. Remember when you delete something from a recipe you need to try and make it up with something else..ie: substiting half and half for full fat cream.

I would have just given this recipe 2 forks, but in fairness, I used skim milk, and only 1 cup of cheese. I know, I know... my own fault. Still, the texture was fine, but it wasn't quite rich enough without the extra cheese. I was happy with some addition I made, though... dried fines herbes, cracked black pepper, carrots, celery, mushrooms. I cut back a little on the potatoes to make room for the extra veggies, and also used a deep dish pie pan. Used a frozen pie crust, which was fine, but when I have more time, I'd like to try it with a homemade crust. All in all, it made a quite reasonable side dish served with chicken sausage for a simple winter supper.

I took the easy road and made this with a store-bought frozen deep-dish pie crust. It worked great but you can only do three layers. Therefore, cut back ingredients to: 1 lb. potatoes, 1 cup cheese, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup HALF & HALF (not milk) and 3/4 cup sour cream. Same amount of chives. Trim edge of pie crust with foil while baking for 45 minutes. Great dish!

Quite delicious and filling! I was a little leery of the combination of a crust starch and potato starch in one dish, but thought this was great! A nice change from cheesy scalloped potatoes (and tidier on the plate). Think you might be able to cheat and use prepared pastry for a quick meal. Might be good with sausage or bacon. I also used green onions.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch and even my guest who claimed not to like quiche said it was delicious. I made a yeasted tart dough flavored with a bit of lemon zest instead of the pate brisee in this recipe since I hate rolling out dough. The flavor was great; don't skimp on the chives!

I have made this several times, and at least 2 guests leave with the recipe.

This is is now a well loved family tradition liked by all. I make it every Christmas Day for breakfast. Sometimes sub green onions for chives.
