I was looking for a quick and easy appetizer/hors d'ouevres to bring to a BBQ and stumbled upon this. I have to say this was WAY more of a pain than it appears and the return was not worth it. This took a lot of time and was messy! Hollowing out the tomatoes took a lot of time and filling them in with the mayo mixture was messy. I ended up putting the mayo mix in a ziploc bag and cutting a very small hole in the corner to pipe it in. I sort of got the technique down eventually but again this simply wasn't worth it.
