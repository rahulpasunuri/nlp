This is a good one. The combination of flavors was ideal to my palette. The soft Polenta with leeks was delish too.

The porcini sauce and leek polenta were necessary additions to this recipe. The cooking method for the Cornish hens left them lackluster. Overall my boyfriend and I enjoyed the dish, but sadly I won't use this recipe again.

This recipe was fantastic. I was a little hesitant to make it because the sauce sounded a little too tomatoey for the hens, but I did not find it to be that way in the end at all. The mushrooms, sage, tomatoes, and drippings made a very robust and flavorful sauce that paired extremely well with the chicken and the polenta. The only thing that I did outside of the recipe was to simmer the sauce for an hour and a half. 30 minutes just didn't seem long enough for a sauce, and I wouldn't do a thing differently next time.

This is an incredible taste sensation. The armoas remind me of being in my Nonna's kitchen. The Tomato-Porcini Sauce flavors are authentic. Deliziosi!

I've made this recipe several times, including with friends who are "beginner" cooks. It is always wonderful. Recommend you use homemade broth for the recipe, including in the polenta. It really boosts the flavors.

Wow. The whole "Italian Fireside" menu is fantastic! It's easy to make even though it takes a bit. I couldn't think of a thing to change after I ate it. I'll definitely break out these recipes for company. They're awe-inducing.

This was an tasty meal, but...and I can't believe I am saying this-it tasted just like roast chicken with tomato sauce to me. The polenta recipe is great, but I followed the hen recipe to a T and was not that impressed.

delicious/complex flavors. sauce w/polenta was incredible. i recommend mincing mushrooms vs. chopping coarsely to avoid rubbery texture..

This dish was awesome..... beautiful presentation and the taste was fabulous! Added the garlic to the inside of the hen as others suggested! Loved the sauce, used it with other dishes as well. Definately have to present it with the polenta with leeks. Great combination.

Excellent. We have made this recipe for many dinner parties and always a huge hit. I must of made this about 8 times since it first came out in the magazine. Love it. The combination is wonderful. You will love it too. I would give it 7 forks. Enjoy

Good way to prepare the hens; I prepared them as directed and they were perfectly cooked. Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the sauce which was perhaps too "tomato-y": the tomatoes overpowered everything else in the sauce, which renders this to be rather like Chicken Cacciotore, game-hen style.

DELICIOUS! I'm a "terrible cook" but can't even mess this one up. I have made this receipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks. My husband just loves it. The only modifications I've made were to include a garlic clove in each hen (as another suggested) and to roast 2 hens at 425 degrees for approx 45-50mins. Hens are so moist this way and skin is just slightly crispy. I will be making this again very soon. It is TOO easy.

made it without the sauce on the BBQ for a simple elegant supper. served with pear/blue cheese/pecan salad and a baked brie with champagne grapes for an appetizer. Loved it

i made this on the bbq without the sauce and the cornish hens done this way were wonderful. I had a pear/bluecheese/pecan salad with it and a grilled brie with champagne grapes as an appetizer. A simple but elegant and tasty dinner for our long weekend.

While I am tempted to try other cornish game hen recipes, I almost always prepare this one because the results are truly de-lish. It is equally appropriate for serving on china to guests or casually eaten while sitting cross-legged in front of the fireplace. I also recommend making the soft polenta with leeks as an accompaniment.

For once, I didnt change a thing and we really loved this dish. Polenta and porcinis-rustic eating at its best. Simple, elegant, and comforting. What else is there?

ALL I CAN SAY IS EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!

I split the game hens in half and baked them in a shallow jelly roll pan on a bed of sliced lemon and chopped sage instead of a rack. They cooked in 35 minutes and browned beautifully. I strained the drippings into the sauce and added a bit of Italian peppers in olive oil for some kick. Served them with Polenta Triangles with Walnuts & Rosemary (also on this site and a good make ahead dish) and roasted asparagus. It was a huge success.

This is a great recipe and it has a colorful presentation which looks awesome on black plates. I had never really cared for polenta but this recipe is rich and flavorful. The combination is a real winner both in the taste department and presentation.

This was a wonderful alternative to turkey for my thanksgiving dinner. I was a little concerned about the polenta since I had never made it before, but it paired very well with the sauce. I found that roasting the hens on a rack resulted in a lot of smoke billowing from my oven because the drippings burnt to the bottom of the pan. I ended up transferring them to a rackless pan with a bit of broth in the bottom. This also provided some liquid to baste them with. I think that I will try this recipe with a different type of mushroom next time-- both my husband and I found that the porcinis were a bit strong and had a rather unpleasant odour. Perhaps this would yield a 4 fork rating.

I have made this dish for guests several times and always get compliments. It is a great combination and tastes delicious. I always think of this first when planning a comfort food dinner.

Yes, a lovely presentation. I don't know about serving it for a formal dinner, as these hens deserve to be attacked with fingers, requiring lots of napkins. I was concerned that my sauce wouldn't turn out (short on porcinis) and I took a few liberties with it. But in the end, all was well. Next time though I'd follow the sauce recipe to the letter. A hen roasted at 450 degrees for 50 minutes should certainly brown beautifully. For those who had a problem, they should have their ovens calibrated or buy an oven thermometer. Also, I think the birds should be roasted on a flat surface with no sides to allow maximum browning. I used my oven broiler pan. Along with the sage and lemon, I tucked a piece of garlic in the hens - didn't hurt. I, too, didn't use the pan drippings for the sauce, but that was because I didn't want to envision the clean-up job I'd have this morning. Perhaps fresh rosemary would be a good alternative to the sage, used in judicious amounts. My polenta was the 5-minute variety and was just fine. I've reviewed it under that recipe. Finally, this was a very pretty dinner and tasted great.

Very nice dish. I used a can of Del Monte Fresh Cut Diced Tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano. I served it with polenta.

I first made this the day I received my Bon Appetit in the mail and it's been a staple in our menu since then. Like others, I love the presentation and the sauce and the polenta are a terrific combination!

Outstanding recipe! Presentation is fantastic. Second time I made it I replaced the hens with boneless chicken breasts stuffed with procuitto and sage and rolled and baked. I sliced the rolled chicken breasts and fanned out on top of the sauce and ploenta for a wonderful presentation.

I didn't think there was anything special about the dish including the sauce. Hens took less time to cook and were not brown, put under broiler to give them color. Polenta was tasty, but too coarse.

I made this recipe last winter and now I'm back to make it again. It isjust fabulous. The presentation is outstanding. The taste is terrific. One of my favorite (non-barbeque) fancy dinners.

What a wonderful dish! It was so easy but looks and tastes like you slaved in the kitchen for hours. I used a whole ounce of mushrooms (combining Suilus with Porcini) and it still had the perfect balance of flavors. I actually used Boletus Edulus (our local wild version of France's Porcini). The cooking time was perfect. The birds were cooked but still juicy and beautifully browned. The polenta was the perfect compliment.

My Nona made the best polenta ever..this is definitely a match. The sauce is reminiscent of hers..she always used porcini mushrooms. Recently made this for my in-laws and they are hooked!! I use fresh grated Parmesean or Romano Cheese. Polenta stays creamy. This is a real keeper!

I deglazed the pan drippings with white wine which added a wonderful dimension and depth to the sauce. It was an excellent dish. I found it took much longer to roast than the recipe indicated.

I also chose not to add the pan juices. The dish turned out great. My guests loved it. I followed the recipe exactly when cooking the hens and they came out perfectly cooked and looking like the cover of a magazine. Since my husband doesn't care for polenta, I served it with risotto. It was a huge hit and it really didn't require that much effort.

What a beautiful and delicious dish! I prepared it for Mother's Day last year and it was a hit! The polenta was a perfect accompaniment to the rich sauce. I served it with a fresh green salad and finished the meal with a lemon tart. I highly recommend this special occasion dish!

I have used this recipe, with the polenta, several times. We have belonged to a gourmet dinner group for more than 20 years. They are a tough group to please. They raved about this dish! I have served it to guests since then. Each time I have roast and then split the hens and served half of a 22 oz. hen per serving. I agree with other reviewers, delete the pan drippings thereby reducing the fat in a very rich dish. Add a salad of wild greens and winter pear and a fruit dessert. Truly memorable!

It was yummy! I suggest leaving the porcini mushrooms in faily large pieces to really get the flavor in each bite. Also, we are not big polenta fans in my house, so I tried Garlic and olive oil couscous. It got rave reviews.

Fabulous blend of flavors. I too did not have much luck w/ getting the juices from the hens, but found that they weren't really needed. The strong flavor from the Porcini's was nicely balanced by the polenta. My husband loved it!

The cornish hens took more time to cook than prescribed in the recipe. At 450 degrees they took approximately 1 1/2 hours. Otherwise, the simplicity of preparation belies the complexity of the sauce.

I enjoyed making this dish, and was so proud when it looked exactly like the cover page,plus it was delicious along with the polenta and porcini mushroom sauce. P.S. I agree with the Chicago cook re: not adding pan juices to sauce, it just adds fat and is not necessary for flavor

Rating: 4
Excellent company dish. The hens make a beautiful presentation atop the polenta. Porcini mushroom flavor strong and is well balanced by the creamy polenta. Be sure to use good parmesian cheese. Add water to roasting pan so drippings don't smoke. Both times I tried this my hens didn't give much juice; sauce tastes fine w/o gravy and has less fat.

I tried this dish with chicken and loved the combination of seasonings and sauce. I also made the soft polenta with leeks and didn't like that as much. I refrigerated remaining polenta and panfried it to serve with the leftovers the next day. It didn't hold together well, but I much preferred the texture.
