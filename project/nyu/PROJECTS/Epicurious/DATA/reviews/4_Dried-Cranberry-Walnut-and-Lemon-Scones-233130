Good but too sweet. My family and I really liked the recipe, but I will definitely cut down on sugar. They are very sweet like cookies.

Substituted orange juice and orange zest for the lemon juice and lemon zest in this recipe. This is a scheduled "must bake" at least once a month and always have some in the freezer.

These were fabulous, light fluffy with a crunchy crust from the glaze. I used another combo, pistachio and dried peach which turned out great. They were a bit too sweet for my taste so will cut the sugar a bit next time. On the cream issue, used a full 200ml.

First time making scones - I've only seen it on TV. Advice for the novice: I couldn't tell whether the dough "looked dry" or not. I could pick some up and squeeze it into a clump, but still looked really dry and had trouble holding shape when transferring to baking sheet. Made one batch with that much moisture, and added additional 1/2 & 1/2 to second batch, which held together much better. Second batch tastes better. Don't be afraid to add more than the 1/2 C of liquid, I think by the time I added more and more liquid to batch two, the liquid was probably (proportionately) double the amount called for in recipe. I added glaze 1/2 way through baking as other reviewers suggested, which kept the sugar from burning and smoking on the baking sheet. Hope this long note helps someone. :-)

Made these for my husband's "birthday breakfast" and we both loved them. I did not add the cranberries or walnuts; the subtle taste of lemon was sublime. I only used half the sugar called for.

These are a family favorite for every holiday. I've made them with a variety of dried fruits, and they're always delicious. I've substituted soy milk, for a family member who's lactose intolerant and they're still delicious!

A very tasty scone recipe! I took the reviewers' recommendations and put lots of glaze on top, which was delicious. Just be careful if you do this that you don't let too much drip down the sides and onto the pan (unless you like the flavor of burnt sugar on the underside of the scone)!

This has to be one of the best scones ive ever tasted. My husband usually is not a fan of scones but he loves this particular one. I agree with all the others about adding more lemon glaze. i You must try this at least once, iam very happy with it.

I forgot to mention - I did not have half and half so I substituted heavy cream and a touch of skim milk instead. I used a tablespoon over the 1/2 cup called for.

Great scone recipe - the taste reminded me of shortbread. Dense and with the perfect balance between the tart lemon, cranberries and creamy walnut flavors. I took many reviewers' suggestions and backed off the sugar - used 1/4 less. I also doubled the glaze recipe and I'm glad I did as I used almost all of it. All in all delicious - a keeper at my house. I can't wait to try this with dried cherries, orange and almonds! Yum!

I've made a lot of scone recipes and these definitely take the cake! I substituted half the flour with whole wheat pastry flour and used heavy cream instead of half and half for a little extra richness. It seemed a shame to put anything, even butter on them, they were so delicious right out of the oven. The glaze is an absolute must! I will definitely make this often and with lots of variations.

As many others have already stated - This recipe worked wonderfully. Extra lemon doesn't hurt, and reducing the sugar is a very good idea. I tried it with just 1/2 cup of sugar and they were plenty sweet. Very tasty.

I loved the flavor of these scones (they deserve a 4 there) but, they didn't rise at all. In fact, they spread out more like kind of fat cookies. Took way longer to get golden too. What I did wrong was... used cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2 (it needed to be used up)and squished them on one big cookie sheet instead of leaving the 2 in. between. It was almost like there was too much fat (!) in them from the frozen butter/possibly the cream. Huge smoky mess in my oven 1/2 way through baking. Not sure if that's what it was as multiple people had the same problem. Might try them once more (correctly) and with brand new baking powder...that's the only thing I can think might help. Any ideas?

I loved the idea of this combination of ingredients but I should have picked up on the fact that there was more than 1 cup of sugar in it though, AND sweetened cranberries. These scones, when made according to the recipe, are like eating candy and, in my opinion, excessively sweet. Cut the sugar by half and you might have something palatable.

I love these scones. I cut down on the sugar by about 1/8 of a cup and find that the level of sweetness is just right. Here's a solution to the sticking debate. A silicon baking sheet works perfectly. Enjoy, all!

I'm surprised I have any of these left today. I made this recipe yesterday using orange zest/juice vs. lemon. I shaped the scones in miniature 2" rounds and froze all but 2 for use later this month for a brunch. The remaining two were baked off as a "test". Poor husband never got a chance to sample as I gobbled them up before they were even remotely cooled. The orange was an inspired addition. This is a keeper.

making scones was a first for me! These are truly so easy and delicious. I made them for a camping trip as an easy breakfast. I did use the trick of freezing the butter for a bit, but still diced it. I used my fingers and a fork, and that's it! And I didn't toast the walnuts because I was lazy, and I don't feel it made a huge difference. I also followed another reviewers advice of brushing the glaze on ten minutes into the baking and it worked perfectly. They looked just like the picture! They would also make a lovely gift.

After an earlier comment, I went back and made these with dates and used orange instead of lemon. It worked wonderfully. I also learned that if you really dice the cold butter, it works in a lot easier, but I will try the grated butter next time. And I can't imagine these sticking on parchment. I've tried it without and had a terrible time with the glaze burning to the tin. I staunchly recommend the parchment.

Light fluffy yummy scones! I altered the recipe a bit to make them a bit healthier and for what I had on hand and they came out great. I used 1/2 of the sugar, replaced 1 c of the white flour with wheat flour, 1/2 c. of smart balance butter instead of 3/4 c of regular, increased the lemon peel to 1 1/2 T, used pistachios instead of walnuts (that's what I had on hand) and used 1% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. As for process, I pulsed all of the dough ingredients in a food processor, and then moved everything to a bowl where I proceeded to add in the rest. I also followed other reviewers suggestions by making the dough into 3" discs instead of wedges. Super easy, relatively healthy and I'm already looking forward to breakfast tomorrow!

Made this according to the recipe. Nice buttery texture, good comination and compliment of lemon, cranberry and walnuts. One problem though...these did stick to the parchment paper. I baked the remaining ones without it.

These were EXCELLENT!! And in my own way - I made them my own. I only had dried mixed berries - w/cranberries, I grated the butter (idea from another scone recipe) and I doubled the grated lemon ( I actually used my own Meyer Lemon from my own potted tree!!). The only thing was during mixing I got company & got distracted & made them a bit too wet & they took about 10 min longer to bake ( my bad) BUT they are wonderful.Oh! Yes... I added a bit of nutmeg.

I don't know whether anyone else has suggested it, but freezing and then grating the butter works really well in most recipies that require cutting in chilled butter. This is a delicious and light scone recipe.

Rating: 4
These are absolutely the best scones I've ever tasted; I love them and get many compliments when I make them for people. The first few times I made them I did have a problem with the glaze oozing down the sizes and burning to the paper, but I finally learned to glaze them after they've been in the oven about 10 minutes. The glaze soaks in and doesn't run off onto the pan to burn. Like one of the other readers, I make them into 3" discs instead of wedges; one recipe will give me 18-20 scones. Someone asked about using your hands instead of a pastry blender, and I use both; I start with the big chunks of cold butter by hand and then blend to a meal with the pastry whisk. And to the reviewer from Saudi Arabia who can't find cranberries, I would highly recommend chopped dates instead. Hmm. In fact I think I may try that on my own!

Fantastic Scone recipe, and great foundation for alternate flavors. Based on other reviews, I used 3/4 cup sugar and almost 1 full cup of fat free half and half. The lemon flavor is super and the lemon glaze is a must - don't skip! With the alterations, scones are perfect!!

I made these scones to bring to my in- laws house on Christmas morning and everyone raved about them. I had a several requests to make them again for Boxing Day breakfast and again they were eaten up in no time. They are a little sweeter than the scones I have made in the past but we all have a sweet tooth and thought they were fabulous. This recipe is probably my favourite so far. The cranberry, walnut and lemon combo is perfect. And don't foget the lemon glaze!! I wouldn't change a thing.

these scones were awesome. however, i became so preoccupied with other cook's worries of too much sugar . . . and forgot to add sugar! let me back up to say that i pulsed the dough in my food proc. first, then as i was preparing to cut into triangles, i realized about the missing sugar. so i measured about 3/4 c sugar and kneaded it into the already blended dough. then i molded, cut and chilled the dough for about an hour. the scones rose beautifully, were NOT too lemony and the amount of sugar was perfect -- not too sweet. all's well that ends well.

a little technique tip: i find it easier to divide dough into 12, pick up with lightly-floured hands and shape into round disks. Flatten to about 1-inch thickness. Finished scones measure about 3 to 3.5 inches across. Beautiful, homey treats for breakfast or brunch.

I consider myself a scone expert and was immediately drawn to review this recipe. Traditional scones do not call for nearly this much sugar - they should be almost biscuit-like in sweetness. I use the Dried Cherry Scone recipe on Epicurious' website as my standard recipe and alter the fruit/nut combo. For those of you watching calories and/or sugar, you can adapt this recipe by replacing the half & half with fat free buttermilk & you can also cut the butter in half and replace with applesauce, to no ill effects. I even replace half the white flour with whole wheat. Sugar should be no more than a quarter cup in a recipe of this size.

To a cook from Silicon Valley: you are clearly mistaken about the butterfat content in half & half- it is a blend of cream and whole milk containing between 10.5% and 18% butterfat. Whole milk has 3.5% butterfat and cream has a minimum of 18% butterfat. Check out the culinary Q & A section on www.foodtv.com

I love scones and this recipe has two of my favorite flavors: lemon and cranberry. However, I will be substituting skim milk for the half and half. With the amount of fat (butter) called for in the recipe, the butterfat in cream will not be missed. By the way, half and half is a diary product sold in the USA. It has 3% butterfat while whole milk contains 3.5% butterfat. I suspect that whole milk in The Netherlands has an equal or greater percentage of butterfat. For a complete guide to milk terminology and acceptable substitutes (both US and Europe) use this link: http://www.foodsubs.com/Dairyoth.html
