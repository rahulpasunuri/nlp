These were the hit of the dinner. It was a lot of work and next time I would do them a day in advance. I was short of green onions and I used cooked shrimp, so I didn't cook as long. I couldn't find bean threads so used rice noodles. I covered the phyllo with damp paper towel and that helped the tearing. I used the extra cut off pieces to patch if I got a hole. Presentation was excellent and the flavor was wonderful. The sauce makes it all come together. I served these as a starter before serving braised chicken with dates and Moroccan spices with couscous, all from this site.

Because the soup I served before this dish was too much like the Tomato Chermoula Sauce, I instead made the red pepper "Harissa Sauce" recipe from this site (Sept 2002, Bon Apetit). It went really well for anyone interested in an alternative. The purses were good, but too much trouble for me. I guess I'm just not good with phyllo because I had several break apart on me and none of them really looked pretty like the picture. The filling was tasty and I can see adapting it for something else.

TIP: Cut more purses than you think you'll need, as I had lots of filling left over. Also, a real timesaver is to use a rolling pizza cutter to cut the fillo circles. I cut around my 8" plate through 40 sheets of fillo with one easy pass.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't find this dish to be so great for all the trouble making it. It does make an attractive presentation but taste was a little disappointing.

I served this dish at our X-mas party last year. Everyone raved. This year when the RSVP's came in, many people said they would not come unless I made the shrimp purses. Not only were the delicious, but looked very beautiful.

Very impressive and fairly easy. Don't be intimidated by the use of phyllo dough. This is simple. The only hard/time consuming part is the sauce, which is also super-tasty. One patron said, "Can I have [more of] this sauce with everything?". A great start to an Italian supper.

Made these as a starter for Christmas Eve dinner (followed by main course of boulliabaise) and they were terrific and well received. Very festive and looked like little presents. Made the day before and froze them. Worked fine.
