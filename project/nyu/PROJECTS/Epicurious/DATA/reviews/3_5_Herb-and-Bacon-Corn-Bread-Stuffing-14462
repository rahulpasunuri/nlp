This stuffing was a big hit at my Christmas dinner. I used the loaf recipe that accompanies it. I only changed one thing: the amount of broth and eggs. I used 2.5 cups instead of the 1 cup and added 1 egg. Despite these additions, the stuffing was still a bit dry. Next time I'll use around 3 cups, which seems to be popular amongst other cornbread stuffings. Flavour wise, this stuffing is great. Some other reviewers reported a lack of flavour but I didn't experience that. I used fresh thyme, sage, and marjoram (0.5 cup packed) and I infused the bacon fat with these herbs. Definitely give this recipe a try but make sure you use more liquid than the recipe calls for or you'll get an incredibly dry stuffing.

I made this to go alongside a mini-turducken. It was fantastic. I used Buttery Cornbread (this site) and I used leeks instead of onions (can't eat onions) and red bell pepper instead of celery (didn't have any celery in the house) and fresh herbs from my garden (Lemon Thyme, Sage and Marjoram). I baked it in a couple of mini-round cocottes and it came out perfectly and was so very pretty with the red pepper and green herbs against the yellow cornbread.

Absolute BEST stuffing ever! I have to make 2 trays of it for Thanksgiving because everyone piles it onto their plates. Have made it for years now and each year at the Thanksgiving table I ask if I should "change it up" and try a different stuffing next time, and the response of every person at the table is "NO!". The recipe is great as is, but I have modified just a bit over the years replacing 1/2 lb of onions with Shallot instead, and I use Maple bacon!! For the fresh herbs I use Thyme, Sage, and Rosemary. A truly delicious side dish!!

Always a hit and a must for each Thanksgiving. I do usually add additional broth and for those who thought it was lacking on flavor, it probably just needed additional salt and pepper. Enjoy!

this was just so-so. added extra broth as others suggested but still found to be dry. Also surprisingly bland. Won't be using again.

I have made this every year since 2000 and my family considers it a must for Thanksgiving! I have never strayed from the recipe except to buy store bought cornbread and it's wonderful. I have never noticed it being dry but that could be because I use gravy on most of my Thanksgiving plate! Enjoy

it was good. a bit dry, I have added more broth as I reheated it and it improves the texture. I used energee GF cornbread and just let it go stale for a couple of days before using. My son in law threw out the giblets, so I just used chicken stock and turkey fat from the roasting pan. good flavors.

Add 1 to 2 beaten eggs to help hold it together. Texture and flavor are great.

My family loved this stuffing and it will become a tradition! It is worth making your own cornbread. I took another reviews advice when making the corn bread and cut the sugar in half and added a little more milk.

I found it to be really lacking in flavor - which is so surprising based on the amount of bacon, herbs and the raving reviews.

We all just loved this recipe. Made the cornbread from this website and used fresh rosemary, thyme and sage. Added a bit more broth than called for but not much. Will definately make it again!

I would have given 4 forks, but I cahnged the recipe somewhat. But this was terrifc and everyone loved it. I omitted the meat, though, so used some butter and broth to saute the veggies. I used the web site corn bread recipe - it's a good, easy, basic recipe - but instead of baking the cubes for 20 minutes, I cut the bread up the day before, mixed it with half the spices, finely ground in a coffee grinder, plus some salt and pepper, and let it sit out to dry. I did use home made stock, not this recipe, just water and broth (mostly water) with cut up onion and celery, fresh herbs, salt, pepper, and the giblets from the turkey, which I simmered all day. I also did not add any more fat to the dressing, just more of the broth. Using the homemade stock helped with the richness of flavor, just broth probably would not be as good.

I made this stuffing for the first time. It is just so good. I did add a litle more chicken stock and I used used 4 slices prosciutto along with the bacon. My herbs were rosemary(crushed in the mill, along with thyme and sage. Baked for the 30 minutes then uncovered and baked 20 minutes. It was nicely browned. This will be added to my my favorites

This stuffing is the best! I have made it every year since the '97 issue. Kid you not- I get a few phone calls from family members each year making sure the stuffing will be on the table! I agree, more bacon and chicken broth is good to add. I always use fresh herbs.

I had steaks out for dinner and some slightly dry cornbread, so I actually used this stuffing in rolled steaks and it was pretty tasty. I added proscuitto as well as the bacon for a little extra flavor and salt. I think I will try the stuffing for Thanksgiving this year.

I've made this every year since 1997 at the request of the large family. I double or triple the broth. I use bakery-made cornbread to save time and it works very well. Prefer the fresh herbs but the dried works well...Add a bit more for a little extra flavor.

I've made this before. I forgot the sugar in the cornbread recipe tonight. Absolute HEAVEN. Omit the sugar. Fabulous savory corn taste without tasting like it's cornbread that's been made into stuffing.

Based on a friend's recommendation, I made this last year for the first Thanksgiving dinner I hosted for my family. Everybody raved and requested it again this year. It's really easy to make -- and even easier if you use a cornbread mix (I like Marie Callender's) and pre-chopped celery and onions. Lavender adds a nice touch as well.

I made this recipe for the first time about five years ago using leftover corn bread. Since then, I get requests for this dish months in advance every year! This is by far the best stuffing recipe I have ever made.

Didn't care for this recipe. It was way too salty and just didn't wow anyone.

This recipe was one of the best-tasting things on our Thanksgiving table, but it's very high in saturated fats. The 1 1/2-hour bake time may rule out this recipe in most kitchens. Luckily, my sister was able to cook her turkey in a separate turkey roaster.

Excellent recipe. A welcome change from the more bland bread-based stuffings -- quite flavorful and hearty. However, I did go a bit heavier on the bacon, onions, celery and broth for extra flavor/moisture.

Not impressive. I'll try a different recipe next time. If you do make it, definately add more bacon.

Have been making this recipe every year, my families favorite, also recommend doubling the broth, otherwise a little dry. Also we use maple flavored bacon, adds just a little sweet flavor.

Love cornbread? Who doesnt. Now try it in what will be the best stuffing you ever had. Everything works with this recipe. Everyone at our thanksgiving table thought this stuffing was incredible and got several requests for the recipe. I used two cups of chicken soup as recommended and kept covered. I then added some turkey drippings and kept uncovered for a little bit. Next time I would definelty use 1 1/2 pounds bacon. I also used dry herbs. A must for anyone who likes cornbread or stuffing.

This is probably my favorite stuffing recipe so far. It is easy to make and the ingredients blend to make a wonderfully rich, sweet taste.

VERY good! To save time I used 2 boxes of corn bread mix. This gave it a sweeter taste than I prefer but still delicious! This goes great with the Brown Sugar Cured Turkey and Wild Mushroom Shallot Gravy on this site.

My family BEGS for this since the first Thanksgiving I made it. I pulled the recipe out again today to be sure I had everything...a surefire winner!

My guest said it was the best she ever had! I substituted 10 oz of chopped proscuitto for the bacon. I also halved the amount of sugar called for in the corn bread recipe. I heeded the suggestion of another reviewer and added extra broth. I would make it again, but might consider using a corn bread mix to save time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a winner. I used 1 and 1/2 lbs. of bacon and 2 cups of broth. I kept it covered all the way through cooking in the oven to prevent it from drying out. It was moist and delicious. Bacon gave it a nice flavor.

I made the stuffing using the Marie Callendar's cornbread mix, it turned out really well. My only complaint is that this recipe isn't quick, plan on 2-3 hours if you are making the bread from scratch. I also agree with the others that more chicken broth is needed.

I have been making this recipe every Thanksgiving since I first saw it in the November 1997 Gourmet. I was never a big fan of stuffing until I found this recipe. It is simply the best stuffing I have ever had and my wife and her family like it too!

A big hit with the crowd as well as the cook. Made it ahead of time and it was great. Many requests for the recipe. Also used the corn bread recipe and turkey recipe from same edition and Sherried Sweet Potatoes and Apples (Gourmet, Nov. 1990). First time this group liked sweet potatoes!
