So easy and delicious. My only change was using fresh thyme instead of dried. Read more: http://deepdomesticthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/03/scallops-provencale.html

This is fabulous! The scallops caramelize as they brown and leave a delicate sweetness in the pan. For that reason, I wouldn't use flour. My scallops had a lovely brown crust without it. When I took the foil off the platter, there was a pool of browned juices that melded with the tomatoes wonderfully. I got this recipe from the Gourmet Cookbook, which doubles everything and uses all fresh herbs. It's a real keeper.

Delicious and definitely a recipe to keep; everyone loved it. Followed recommendations of other reviewers and deglazed the pan with white wine and added in capers. Perfect use of a late summer heirloom tomato. Thought dredging through flour would muddle the bright fresh flavors, so didnt do. Had over rice with a nice Riesling.

This was a nice fresh dish -- very simple and easy to prepare. I tossed a Campari red tomato and an heirloom yellow with sliced zuchini and Parmesan cheese. Served with warmed rosemary focaccia on the side.

Correction, did NOT use flour, trying to abstain. Just dry the scallops with paper towels first. I got a good sear that way. Recommend serving in a bowl with either polenta or the garlic toasts as mentioned below.

This is fast, easy, and healthy. I did dredge in flour, just made sure the scallops were patted dry and the skillet was hot. Next time I will serve over polenta or grits, as juice from the scallops and tomatoes is really good!

i was able to get excellent heirloom cherry tomatoes and lemon basil from the farmer's market, which i subbed in this recipe. also used fantastic scallops from same market - i took others' suggestions and dredged the scallops in seasoned flour as well as deglazing the pan, and the scallops got a beautiful golden crust. the juices released from the cherry tomatoes mixed with the deglazed liquid and that sauce itself was amazing soaked into the scallops, and the actual tomatoes almost overpowered that combo and the subtle sweetness of the scallops, so we kind of ate them in separate bites - i think the cherry tomatoes might have been a little over the top - a nice big heirloom would have been a bit mellower. altogether, fantastic ingredients, easy prep and beautiful dish i will make variations of many more times i am sure.

What a delicious summer treat with ripe tomato and fresh basil from the Farmer's Market. I even got the scallops and garlic there. I read the previous reviews and floured the scallops before cooking, and added mushrooms to the sauce. Will make this alot.

I forgot to say that I also added a couple of teaspoons of capers along with the herbs and tomatoes. This dish is great!

This recipe was phenominal with a few modifications. I dredged the scallops in a herb de Provence flour mixture before searing in Williams-Sonoma lemon drizzling oil. After searing, I just added the garlic directly to the pan and sauteed until golden. I then added homegrown tomatoes flavored with Fleur de Sel and my garden fresh thyme,marjoram, and basil and cooked until the herbs were wilted. Served along baby yukon potatoes in a parsley butter sauce and sauteed bok choy, argula, zucchini and shitake veggie combo. Really delicious and healthy.

If fresh tomatoes aren't avalible, Hunt's Petite diced tomatoes in a can are an exceptional substitute. Also, I have served with parmesan cous cous as a perfect pairing

did not want to spend $3 on dead basil, so at the end i put 3 tablespoons of homemade pesto instead and it was terrific.

Simple, quick, and delicious. I doubled the tomato, deglazed the pan with white wine, used herbs de provence instead of straight thyme, and served with thick garlic toasts.

This was very good and so simple! I cut the oil quite a bit... just used the left over from the scallops while it was still hot. Would definitely make this again.

Excellent, easy -- strong, simple flavors that go together very well. Like other posters, I used a beautiful heirloom tomato, and it made the difference. The dish looked stunning as well. In cooking the scallops, don't move them until you're ready to turn them over; this keeps them from sticking.

Very tasty and simple to prepare, instead the thyme used cilantro,which releases a wonderful aroma, and perfectly combines with any seafood.

Simple and easy. Used fresh basil and thyme from the garden and a great farmstand heirloom tomato. Served over arugula with lemon, salt and olive oil salad from this site.

I used a number of sprigs of fresh thyme, omitted the basil, diced about two and a half really ripe heirloom tomatoes, dregged the scallops in flour, added a tablespoon or two of butter to the tomatoes as they cooked, and the results served over fresh homemade pasta were sensational.

Just got up from the table after eating this for the first time. I was a little sceptical that something so simple could produce such good results but was I wrong! It was simply delicious. I was fortunate to have on hand 2 large very ripe tomatoes and I used twice as much garlic since we love it so much. Did the de-glazing as recommended and forgot the basil until after I served it. Frankly, would leave out next time as I think it competed too much with with the thyme, which I love. Really excellent.

What a great dish and so easy to prepare. The flavors brought images of summertime to our minds and were perfect to kick off spring 2005. The only thing I did a little differently was to add most of the basil to the tomato mixture while cooking and just sprinkled the remainder on top of the finished dish. We'll definitely be having this one again.

Very complimentary and light; could ratchet up the taste a bit, though, so I'll work on that one. Serve over angel hair with bits of farmer cheese for a dinner that will make you feel fresh and healthy.

I made this receipe when there are no good tomatoes to be had in Pittsburg. I used 2 cans of Muir Glenn diced tomatoes, one I drained and one I used with the juice. I did deglaze the pan with wine as suggested and from there I followed the receipe as written. I am sure this will be all the more delicious with fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden but this was a real winters treat. I have also made this with half scallops and half shrimp and I like the mix the best.

Excellent dish and so easy to prepare! I made it exactly according to the recipe the first time and now add a little lemon. It's also very attractive.

I love this dish, it's so easy and delicious! I've made it twice. Each time I added 1 cup dry white wine, and some fresh lemon juice. I've also used fresh parley and chopped fresh leeks. This dish can be served with baguette slices to dip in the sauce. Wostershire sauce is also a nice addition!!

Very tasty and very easy. I thought it needed a few drops of lemon juice to add a little extra acid, but my husband thought it was great as-is. Served it with pasta and sauteed spinach.

Awesome! I also deglazed the pan with white wine and tripled the sauce and served over linguine. It was great but could have generously served 3 and easily 4 people.

This dish looks impressive and is fairly easy to make, do add one extra tomato and cook the basil for 30 seconds as well as add some fresh at the end. Yummy!

I sauted onions with the garlic, added white whine, spinach, and used a couple handfuls of grape tomatoes( which made the dish pretty, don't leave out)Next time I will double everything except the scallops. A pound of scallops for two people was too much. I didn't have basil, but scattered diced green onion on top. Placed this dish on top of garlic and olive oil cous cous. This was a beautiful, healthy dish. My boyfriend and I loved it. Don't forget to double the sauce, and we loved the spinach.

Wonderful! I doubled the sauce, deglazed the pan, and served it over angle hair pasta with a little bit of feta crumbled on top. Perfect for a light, healthier dinner! Ingredients were fresh and everything blended splendidly!

Tasted great. My Boyfriend loved it. Definitely double the sauce and deglaze the pan after you remove the scallops. I used vermouth instead of white wine to deglaze pan. Gave it a nice flavor.

This is a great weeknight meal. Always looking for new ways to prepare scallops and this will become a standard. I only had grape tomatoes and very little basil and it was still wicked good. Served over egg noodles (again, that's all I had in the house) but would love to try with cous cous. Will definatly make again.

Excellent! I, also, deglazed the pan with a touch of dry white wine (thanks to reviewer who suggested this). The flavor is delicate, but well-seasoned. I had quite large scallops so had to do them about a minute and a half, each side. Careful! Don't overcook scallops!

I added thinly sliced sweet onions which I carmalized with balsamic vinegar before browning the scallops. I also added chopped spinach with the tomato. I served it all over linquini. What a wonderful meal! I will serve this many times.

This is SO good. I made it with yellow tomatoes and their sweetness was a perfect compliment to the saltiness of the scallops.

Loved this recipe. Thought it was restaurant quality and oh so easy to make. Served it with the Persian Rice recipe on the site -- which was a lovely combo. Gave my neighbor a little portion which was EXCELLENT for an appetizer. She gushed. Just make sure you have excellent scallops and a good tomato and you're golden.

Excellent and SIMPLE recipe!! I also cooked a minced shallot with the garlic and stirred in basil with the tomato mixture while it cooked as well as garnishing it with basil. I had some feta cheese on hand and sprinkled that on top of the dish too and it was amazing!

I thought this recoipe was extremely tasty, as did my husband. The only changes that I made were using two plum tomatoes instead of one regular and deglazing the pan that I seared the scallops in with some white wine. The flavor that the herbs added was wonderful. I served the scallops over angel hair pasta that I tossed with a good olive oil. Next time around (which will probably be soon!), I will double the tomato mixture for additional sauce. Definitely a keeper!

Elegance from simplicity...this is a splendid recipe, and a cinch to make. I used two roma tomatoes instead of only one as called for. I also deglazed the skillet with about 1/2 cup white wine after removing the scallops. Excellent served over wide egg noodles.
