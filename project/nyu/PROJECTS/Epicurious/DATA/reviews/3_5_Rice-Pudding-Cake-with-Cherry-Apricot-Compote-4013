Just a note - It's called "flourless" in but it's not safe for celiacs if you add the breadcrumbs (which obviously contain wheat). So leave them out if you're aiming for gluten-free.

Exceptional, easy, versatile recipe ! I did this twice: once with lemon zest [quite a bit] as the only flavoring, put into the rice along with the sugar; the second time with saffron. Served cold with raspberry sauce first, and rose sorbet second. I'd say that the pairing of cake and sauce flavors makes this interesting and very versatile. Plums are getting in season, so next might be a version with resins and honey plums as garnish. Quite likely, many more to come...

I used candied ginger in the cake as I did not have candied orange. I thought the cake was very good although I have a rice pudding recipe that is amazing so I think I would make that instead.

Five or six years ago, a Florentine friend who owns a local caffe asked me to make a dessert to accompany a "big lunch" we were preparing for friends. He mentioned a childhood favorite rice pudding, so I found this recipe and made it for him in advance to see if it was anything like he remembered. I did not use the compote. His eyes welled with tears of joy when he took the first bite, saying that it brought back his childhood. After that, I made it for him once a week for several years. He was invited to a potluck for Alice Waters' birthday one year, and asked me if I would make it for him to take. But he ended up taking a pickled anchovy dish instead because he said he would have felt guilty bringing something he didn't make himself. I was flattered that he thought this was an offering fit for my gastronomic goddess, and mildly disappointed when his integrity prevailed. He has just sold the caffe, so I'm bringing this to the farewell fete tomorrow. Good quality candied orange peel is critical. If you can't find it, substitute something else, or leave it out...

I omitted the almonds, as they gave the cake an odd texture, and substituted chopped craisins. Yum! The compote was very good, but needed thickening with cornstarch, and more cooking to vaporize the alcohol in the wine. Definitely would make again!

We used a high-quality store-bought cherry compote and our guests seemed to like the compote more than the cake itself... The taste of the cake is very good but the consistency is a bit dry. If we made it again, we'd cook it less and serve it as a pudding rather than a cake. We used a combination of candied ginger and candied orange peel and thought the combination of flavors was tasty. We used ground nuts rather than bread crumbs to coat the cake pan and it worked fine.

We all loved this! I made it exactly as stated and it was a refreshing end to an Italian feast. Yes, even though the base is rice, the flavorings kept it fresh tasting. Since apricots and fresh cherries are unavailable this time of year, I used frozen peaches and Morelli cherries from a jar for the compote. It tasted just fine. Will definitely make this again.

Great dessert. I too could not find the candied orange but used candied ginger and it was wonderful. Instead of breadcrumbs, I used crumbled graham crackers to line the pan. You definitely need to make the compote with it. The cake doesn't make it alone. But the compote is great.

This is similar to my grandmother's recipe. She was born in Reggio Emelia, Italy. The only difference is thar she also used 1C of finelly chopped citron in the torta and 1 C of almonds. I make this for Christmas and Easter. and love it.

I thought this cake was extraordinary. Very easy, light and not too sweet. I made another compote from this site, with figs, cherries, and apricots, and it was perfect. This is very similar to a Patricia Wells recipe, except that the cooking time in hers is half as long. I compromised -- cooked it about 45 minutes, and it seemed just right: lightly browned and moist.

I couldn't find the candied orange, so opted for raisins instead, as per another reviewer. The result was fantastic, and can't imagine the dish without raisins. I doubled the sauce recipe, but that wasn't necessary. Serve in a bowl with tons of the compote. A real winner!

I loved this but found it to be very time consuming - the rice pudding requires constant attention. I don't care for orange peel, so I used raisins. Next time, I will use dried cherries or dried apricots instead of the of the peel to complement the compote, which is also excellent. Easy on the almond extract - the amount listed is perfect but any more might be overwhelming.

I've made this recipe 3 times. I used non-fat milk and loved it. Also made it without almonds and used water chestnuts (my friend is allergic to nuts) and came out excellent. MAKE sure rice is lukewarm before mixing with eggs. On compote, I used Dried Fruit, excellent, but let it stand before using, you will get better flavor.
