Easy, health and gotta love the relish. Made exactly as written. Only change would be to make more of the relish, cause that's what makes it!

Really good - really easy! I used thin sliced chicken breasts and marinated them in a plastic bag for 4 hours with a store bought creamy balsalmic dressing. I added red onion and some chopped cucumber to the relish...I also used basil rather than mint. Tossed some arugula with olive oil and lemon juice and had a wonderful and easy meal!

I made this recipe for a few friends and everyone enjoyed it. I used basil instead of mint just my preference. The next time I try it I will marinade the chicken perhaps in similar ingredients found in the relish like the red wine vinegar, olive oil and garlic.

My husband and I loved this recipe, which I made with no changes. My surprise was that I liked the mint, not my favorite herb. But I had a planter of mint given as a gift and growing out of bounds, so I wanted to use some of it. Buttered noodles are a great accompaniment. The relish can go over both the noodles and the chicken and are great together. Served with a spinach salad for a very enjoyable dinner.

This dish is amazing. Super fresh flavors and extremely easy. We've made it several times not and it's always a hit.

We love this recipe, only I exchanged basil for the mint. It's so easy, and with garden tomatoes and the feta, it can't be beat.

Really great. Had basil on hand, so used that for the salsa. Will be a staple in our house. Light, healthy, fresh.

This recipe rocks! So easy to make, and super-tasty. I used reduced-fat Feta to make it lighter, and it was still delicious. Try it over fresh arugula -- the peppery, dryish greens complement the other ingredients perfectly.

Wonderful. I make a similar Greek style relish for lamb sausages and it rocks. Add some red onion for an extra kick. Loved the mint -- as did my significant other who usually snarls at fresh herbs. Oh, and some roasted peppers to the mix never hurts.

We loved this. Used mozzarella instead of feta, and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vin. (both, because that's all that was avail. at the time) and it was also delicious!! My husband, a picky eater (when I cook), LOVED it. Great recipe. Also, my barbecued boneless breasts never turned out so good as tonight becauseyou had the Perfect grilling instructions for a novice griller. THANKS

This recipe was easy, and I am always looking for new ways to use chicken breasts. My husband is a picky eater and does not like olives. I simply made up the tomatoes and feta mixture and then split it in half. I then added the olives to my half.

This was so easy and yes it was as surprisingly good as the others here say. I too swapped mint for some red onion and a little chopped cilantro and it was great. It was quick and tasty. I decided to serve the grilled chicken breasts on a bed of green salad and topped it with the relish. Healthy like.

Very good. I couldn't find fresh mint so subbed garden basil and used very sweet garden cherry tomatoes, didn't chop. Great flavor!

I'm shocked at the yumminess of this recipe. I was worried the chicken would be bland, but is was full of favor. I agree with everything commented already: tomato relish is delish, leftovers can stand on their own, and my kids inhaled the meal. It's a keeper AND it's fast!

I can't praise this recipe enough. It is incredibly easy & fast AND it tastes great.

i made it with tapas bar olive from the grocery --- a variety of olive flavors combined with the mint punched up the greek/medi vibe. yum.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is a great for during the week. My son loves the relish; what a great way to get him to eat tomatoes and olives. This is a big family favorite.

Wonderful! I breaded the chicken and cooked in a pan on the stove. For the relish I used a few cherry tomatoes, but as it's December (and tomatoes are not at their best!) I added about 1/2 C canned petite diced tomatoes. I heated the relish and at the last minute added the cheese. Even my non-olive loving husband lover it! I even caught him eating the relish all by itself.

this was a really great recipe, so tasty. But It's december and instead of having the cold relish as a topping, what I did is I cooked the chicken on high on each side for 2 minutes, then I turned the heat down to 2 or 3, and scooped the relish on top. the olive oil (and I used the suggestion of olive juice which was perfect) made the chicken so moist, and the relish was perfect on top. served on top of rice, made it perfect. The family said that it was the best thing I've made in awhile haha.

This recipe had an amazing flavor! However, what I'd do is add about 1/8 cup of the olive juice from the jar of olives along with the olives for an even more amazing flavor in the relish sauce! It makes a big difference! Overall though the taste was exceptional! I make this all the time! It's healthy, light, and a great summer meal when cherry tomatoes are in season here in Jersey!!

Substituted heirloom toms and it was great. The juiciness of the tomatoes and the savory of olives and feta took basic grilled chicken to a whole 'nother place. Won't make grilled chix again without some kind of relish, and this will top the list.

Lovely; stumbled on this looking for way to use up a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes. Nice presentation; would add some onion next time for the crunch. This is so easy and fast it will be in regular rotation! Sandra McNally

This is my new favorite way to eat grilled chicken. I kept the mint, and I added chopped onion - can't imagine it any other way now! I think the mint compliments all of the other ingredients perfectly. Very light, healthy, and fresh, but most of all, it's a delicious recipe.

This is an excellent relish that is good with the chicken, but is better as a cold pasta salad. I added the red onions and subtracted the mint. I have now made this one of my staples for something quick.

3.5 Very good. I enjoyed the mint, and I followed another reviewer's advice and added ~ 1/2 cup chopped red onion. Next time I'll probably add less olive oil to the relish, which I think would make an excellent recipe for bruschetta, especially with the additon of a little chopped garlic.

3.5 - Yes this will be my 2nd time within a couple of months. I try not to make the same thing twice but keep looking for new recipes every night. But I think it's very good, and it's easy. Less prep the better

This is a very fresh-tasting, easy, light summer meal that was a hit with my husband. I think the mint is actually a nice complement to the nutty flavor of the feta. I served the chicken and relish atop a bed of buttered egg noodles to round out the meal.

This recipe is a definite keeper! I made it for my in-laws, and they raved about it and wanted the recipe. I used the left-over ingredients and made more relish the next day as a side dish with our brats. I added vidalia onions, too, for crunch.

Great, fast, easy grilled chicken recipe. Good standby as written!

I agree. The mint is not the way to go. Substitute with a little thyme or nothing at all and this recipe becomes a 3 or 4 fork treat. I'll often just make the relish and serve as an appetizer.

This is an excellent recipe, it is fast, simple and a lot of flavor. My wife love it.

Perhaps my taste is developed enough but this recipe didn't quite satisfy me. The Kalamata olive and the mint seemed to be fighting each other rather than complimenting each other. Also, it's worth mention that black olives taste similar to Kalamata olives, in case your cooking some where that doesn't have a very good olive selection or you don't want to spend the money.

This is what summer should be. Simple, flavorful and an absolute treat! I slice the chicken breasts lenthwise prior to grilling. They cook faster and don't dry out.

Good with grilled lamb too, rub or marinate your lamb with a bit of garlic before grilling... Use a bit less than a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. I also add chopped cucumber.

Really easy to make, and my four year old daughter even ate it. The fresh mint is the key for me, because it lightens the dish and makes it a more appropriate for spring. Loved it! And it's quick...

Great recipe, easy, fast and delicious. I didn't want to take the time to use the grill, so I just cooked on stovetop in a grill pan so it still had nice grill marks. I enjoy the blend of flavors in the relish.
