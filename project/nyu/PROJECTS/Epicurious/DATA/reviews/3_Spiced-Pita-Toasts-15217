Used lavash instead of pita bread and made this on a humid, thunderstormy day. Had no problem keeping the crisps crisp; they stayed crisp overnight and the next day as well. Tasty and crunchy.

very disappointed... the toasts were a little bitter, and by 4 hours after I made them they lost their crispness and by the next day, despite being kept in airtight container they were very stale. easy enough to buy pita crisps to dip...

Made these for a cooking club class along with an excellent hummus recipe with parsley oil and pine nuts.

It amazed me how something so simple and easy to prepare could have such flavor output. And there are infinite variations depending on the type of pita bread you use and the spices you choose. Although the smokiness of the fresh cumin adds a lot.

I have made these pita toasts several times. They have become a staple in my house for when I have company over. They are extremely easy to make, taste wonderful, and are always a hit with my guests.
