I wanted this to be amazing, but it was just ok. First attempt at making a souffle though and we live at altitude so it can make baking times tricky. Found it to be a tad too eggy, and not as light as I would have liked. Again, this may be due to my inexperience in cooking souffles. Followed recipe exactly as written, and I thought the white chocolate cream was great!

This recipe was SO easy, and it was my first souffle, so I was thrilled that it worked, and they looked beautiful. Just sort of bland, flavor-wise. I could just be more of a pot de creme person than a souffle person. My husband thought they were meh, didn't even finish his. I wouldn't go that far, I would eat a chocolate paper towel if one existed. But I made the recipe as printed and they did turn out perfect.

These souffles were delicious and so easy to make. The coffee and brandy add a wonderful depth of flavor. Served with vanilla ice cream and raspberries and all the guests raved.

I must have made these souffles at least a dozen times. It's easier than it looks. Everyone will be impressed and their sweet tooth will be satisfied.

This was the first time I made a souffle, and it came out awesome! I used Cointreau instead of brandy, and I also doubled the recipe to make LOTS. It was soo good with Bernard Callebaut chocolate...

Really great souffle. It came out crispy on top and moist in the middle. Some chocolate souffles are heavy, but with only about 1 oz of chocolate in each one it is great. I substituted 2 of the ounces of semisweet chocolate for 2oz milk chocolate to sweeten the recipe. Also instead of brandy I used 2T Grand Mariner since orange is so delightful with chocolate. To the cream topping I also added orange zest.

Yummy & very easy to make! I made this souffle exactly as outlined in the recipe. Wonderful rich, chocolate flavor! You dont' even need the sauce! I may make this again tonight. It's always impressive to tell someone that you have made a "souffle"

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I have never made a souffle before and it went perfectly. I made two modifications to the recipe. First, I used a mix of bittersweet (3 ounces) and semisweet (2 ounces) Lindt chocolate. Also, I dissolved the espresso and melted the chocolate in a double boiler rather than in a saucepan. As another reviewer mentioned, the chocolate base can be made the day before. I actually made the entire base, split it in two (by weight) and made two souffles on the first day (beat 2 eggwhites with half the sugar) and the other two the next day. On the second day, I took the base out of the fridge for a couple of hours but still had to microwave it for 15 seconds to make it soft enough to fold into the whites. The souffles rose perfectly on both days. I did not make the white chocolate sauce, though. Instead, I did a quick "creme anglaise" by melting some vanilla ice cream and adding some Grand Marnier. Spoon into the warm souffles and enjoy!

This was my first attempt at any kind of souffle, and it went surprisingly well. I accidentally made it too far in advance and had to let it sit for three hours but it didn't seem to do much damage...although I'm looking forward to seeing how much better it will be next time when it can go straight into the oven. Also, served it with whipped cream as white chocolate is hard to find here and still, it was excellent. Next time will for sure try to get my hands on some white chocolate as it sounds amazing! This is a definite keeper!

I always make this soufflé in winter, and in summer I replace the cream with Ciao Bella's coconut ice cream. It is delicious and very easy to make. Great for small dinner parties.

This was delicious and impressive! I would have never tried this recipe if it weren't for all the positive reviews about how easy it was to make. They're right....it's a piece of cake and you end up the super hero chef!

Delightful, Delicious and extremely simple. Plus this recipe can certainly be made a day ahead prior to baking. Found it actually served six. Poor husband had to suffer and eat 2.

Cut the recipie in 1/2, and it turned out great. After reading some of the reviews, I didn't bother with the white chocolat cream, used whipped cream instead. Will make again for sure!!!!

Excellent!! I too would not make the sauce again. Very lumpy. I ended up serving them with whipped cream instead. They were wonderful!!

A definite keeper. Easy and oh so divine. I wouldn't make the White Chocolate Cream again (it's about 2 forks because it's just sweet with no character). The souffles are wondeful with whipped cream.

This recipe is EASY and DELICIOUS! If you have ever been intimidated by making a souffle - DONT BE! Give this a try, even my dh though these were better than the ones we got at Le Chateau in Salem, NY. I have made this twice, both times using Kahula instead of brandy. Also, the second time I used regular ol' store brand semi-sweet chocolate chips and it was just as good if not better than my 'gourmet' chocolate. And finally, you CAN make these the day before and fill the souffle dishes and keep them in the refigerator. I put them on the counter to warm up while my oven came up to temperature. Either way,Cook these babies for 13 1/2 to 14 minutes (no longer!) and they will be puffy and perfect. I admit I was not impressed with the creme angeleise I made for the first batch; I thought the sweetened whipped cream was a better accompaniment on my second go-round. Try it, you're gonna love it!

These are delicious! We liked the white chocolate cream, but probably wouldn't make it again. I made the chocolate base the day before & kept it in the refrigerator. I didn't leave enough time for it to come to room temp, so I carefully microwaved the mixture on defrost for about twenty seconds. It turned out perfectly. I didn't have any brandy, so I used rum instead. My husband, who doesn't like coffee or rum, loved them! I served them with whipped cream sweetened with powdered sugar & a bit of rum. Mmm!

This was so incredibly easy and turned out perfectly! My guests were so impressed when I put these in front of them. I believe that I actually used cappucino powder and it didn't effect the outcome at all. I would highly recommend this recipe!

I cooked this for 14 minutes to the second- it was perfect!I served it with Gourmet's caramel sauce (from another souffle recipe)simply crosshatching the top with the sauce..I loved it and so did my guests.I prepared it about 45 mins before baking.

I prefered using Kalua instead of brandy. It definitely needed a creme anglaise or sauce with it,but it was easy and delicious.

This was my first souffle and I was astounded how easy it was (with a Kitchen Aid Mixer) and how impressive the completed dish was. I make it all the time now and everyone loves it.

I've made this recipe several times now and every time it produces flawless results. Guests are amazed and impressed! If anything, double the white chocolate sauce amount, because it is never enough. This recipe doubles easily. Don't be intimidated by souffles..they are easy and make for the perfect ending to an elegant meal!!!
