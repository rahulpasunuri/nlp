I love these scones. My sisters are always begging me to make them. They have a wonderfully tender texture and perfect flavor.

A fabulous recipe for almond-poppy seed scones can be found 1st Travelers Choice Internet Cookcook on http://www.virtualcities.com/ons/ar/z/arz69012.htm. I make these all the time and receive rave reviews. My husband says that they remind him of sugar cookies!

I left out the poppy seeds, reduced the almond extract by 1/2 tsp. and reversed the proportions for the shortening (1/4 cup) and butter (1/2 cup) - - more butter is always better - - and I thought they turned out well. I also brushed with beaten egg white and topped with sliced almonds. Next time I'll form the dough into a circle and cut the wedges - - forming it into a rectangle requires too much handling of the dough.

The first time I made these I ate two and then indvidually wrapped the remainder and froze them to have every day with tea for a snack. I didn't share them with my family until I made them a second time. They loved them too. It's the unique texture, reminicient of a light, home-made pie crust, that gets me. Not only are they the best scones with tea or coffee, they are very easy to make as long as you keep some Crisco around.

My all time favorite. If you come from a European background like me and like almond flavoring these are great. Especially with raspberry jam.

I agree with the previous cook--these lacked flavor. Also, they were not as moist and melt in your mouth as some that I've made. I made a almond powdered sugar glaze to drizzle over hoping to impart some additional flavor but it didn't help much. If I were going to make again (though I'm not planning), I'd made one large circle and cut it into 8ths. I highly recommend the chocolate chip toffee scone recipe found on this site (I know, that has nothing to do with this recipe!).

I found this so bland I thought I'd left out something and rechecked the recipe. I didn't leave anything out so I don't know what happened. Based on other reviews, I must be very picky about my scones.

Quick and easy recipe that is delicious! I also made it with lemon extract instead of almond one time. Just as good. Make extras! They go fast!

Great to take along for an early morning hike. I make hem by cutting them in 8 pieces only. Otherwise, they turn out too crumbly.
