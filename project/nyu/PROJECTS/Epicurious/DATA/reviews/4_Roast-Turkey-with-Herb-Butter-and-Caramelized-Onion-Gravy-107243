I had this gravy for the first time on Thanksgiving, and absolutely loved it! Everyone at the dinner table was raving. I got the recipe, and made it the very next day...so good. Honestly, I think I could have it every day and not tire of it! For those who thought the balsamic was too much... Try substituting 1/2 of the balsamic with red wine vinegar.

Rating: 4
I've been making this every year since it was first published, and my family won't let me change it! The only thing I've changed is omitting the balsamic from the gravy - we had it that way the first few years, but I'm the only one who truly loves balsamic, so I left it out one year, and the rest of the family liked it much better that way. I will say if you use a high quality balsamic, it will taste less vinegar-like. Either way, this recipe is a classic!

This is my 2nd time with this recipe, but I think it's time to retire the gravy for thanksgiving. Most guests reaction was that it is just too off-classic. The vinegar is too prominent (similar to a German sauerbraten gravy) and the onion slices too unwieldy (I used an immersion blender with good results). I needed additional roux to thicken the gravy. One guest also commented that the rosemary flavor was too strong. The herb-buttered turkey & drippings were amazing.

I am one of many who have made this every Thanksgiving since it appeared-my family will not let me make turkey and gravy any other way. The only slight change Imake is less rosemary as that is not a family favorite.

My go-to gravy recipe. I do make the base well in advance and freeze it. I've made it with Vidalias but it's too sweet then, so I would recommend regular onions.

This is the best turkey recipe I have ever made, bar none. I ahve been making Turkey recipes from the 2002 edition of Bon Appetit for the last 8 years and all are good but this is the best. The Herb butter and Carmelized Gravy are divine. I have frozen the gravy and used it months later and it was just as delicious. All guests rave and ask for more. DO NOT use the same named recipe from 1999, the gravy doesn't even come close in the depth and complexity of flavor. A MUST MAKE!!

Rating: 3
This makes a really delicious turkey and has been my go-to recipe for the past 3 years. The gravy, however, tastes way too much of balsamic vinegar, so i now use that amount of chicken or turkey stock instead and leave out the vinegar altogether. Personally, i think that makes it much, much better.

It is the day before Thanksgiving and we are invited to friends for dinner tomorrow. But, I will also be cooking a bird at home so I can take my son's favorite turkey gravy for the dinner. This recipe produces a gravy with such depth and flavor - it is the one dish my family requests when turkey is being served. No more plain giblet gravy for this crew.

I loved this gravy, a sweet & sour kind of thing. I used vidalias and with the sugar and balsamic and the very slow carmelization it was great. I've done turkey this way several times and it always turns out moist and flavorful.

This is the only turkey recipe i have used for the last 4 turkey dinners. Everyone raves about this recipe! I do substitute the balsamic vinegar in the gravy with chicken/turkey stock, as i found the vinegar taste was way too strong... and it gives me the best gravy! very very good.

I made this for Thanksgiving. The turkey was wonderful! I only had a 13 lb. bird so I used 2 onions and less balsamic vinegar. The gravy was decent but it was way sweeter than I expected (or liked) from a gravy. I will be sticking with giblet gravy in the future.

Although I thought this might be a nice change, my guests prefer my old savory giblet gravy more. I used more herbs in the turkey--parsley, and sage as well as rosemary and thyme (all fresh). Added a very nice taste to the bird.

I made this for a recent holiday dinner. I used dried spices instead of fresh and cut down a little on the rosemary as I have family members who don't like it. The turkey was ok and very moist. I used a fresh turkey and I had a little difficulty separating the skin in order to rub in the butter. Following recommendations from other reviewers, I added some chopped garlic to the butter. I also put some onion and celery on the turkey (a must in our house)! The gravy was wonderful. The balsamic vinegar was an interesting addition and added a lot of flavor. I did cut down by half the amount of vinegar as I thought it would be a bit too much, and i'm glad I did. I think that next time i'll use a tiny bit less. To sum it up, my guests and family loved the turkey and the gravy (even the rosemary and vinegar haters!!) and i'll be making this again.

Rating: 4
I was concerned the turkey might come out dry as I used a fresh bird but it came out moist and delicious. Be careful if you're using fresh rosemary in the pan as well as in the gravy recipe as I think it overpowered the gravy flavor. Will definitely try this again, however.

I made this for a very fussy group. I didn't change a thing and It was quite the hit! The gravy is fantastic. I have already forwarded it to everyone who was at Thanksgiving. This was the best turkey I ever made and it has already been requested for next year.

My turkey came out great, though no one really noticed the herbs adding any flavor to it. But it was moist and perfect, beautiful too! My only problem was that the gravy did not thicken like my usual pan gravy does but it tasted delicious! Big hit this T-giving! I'll give it another try to try and get the gravy thicker next time.

Fantastic gravy and bird! I made this last year and my sister in law is asking me to champion the gravy again this year. Everyone said it was the best they had ever had! The fresh herbs and the bite of the balsamic vinegar is so flavorful. Do make the base for the gravy the night before. It makes the day of so much easier.

Just made this for Easter dinner/a birthday dinner for my mom, and it was a *huge* hit. The gravy was, as other reviewers have said, rich and delicious, and the turkey came out very moist. My mother in law can't have any salt in her diet, so I didn't salt the turkey or add any to the gravy, but with the richness of the herbs and the gravy, it wasn't missed at all. Highly recommend this recipe!

WOW! Best gravy I have ever had in my entire life. It was the hit of the T-day meal. I should have made a triple batch. I just made the gravy, not the turkey. Used just the turkey drippings. I made the base 2 nights prior and reheated it in a sauce pan before finishing it. The bonus is the smell the cooking onions give your house. What an incredible dish! I followed recipe to the T but next time I will make a lot more. The gravy was the first thing gone at our table.

Rating: 4
This is the BEST turkey I have ever made. Since I found it in 2002, I have made it every Thanksgiving. My family requests it each year. It is work, but worth it for a once a year treat. I would highly recommend preparing the gravy base and the turkey the night before or you will not have enough time the morning of. Also, I have had a very hard time keeping the "pretty" herbs on the top of the turkey during the cooking of the turkey as they fall off when I baste it. Enjoy :o)

This recipe was delicious. The gravy was so unique & special - so many different layers of flavor, absolutely fantastic. The turkey was so moist & flavorful. My husband and my brother both said that it was the best turkey they've ever had. I have to agree, but the gravy was jaw dropping-ly good - simply fantastic. We used a smaller turkey, so it cooked a lot faster & we didn't end up with a ton of pan drippings. Therefore, I added more liquid to fill out the gravy - some water, some chicken broth. It ended up being just a little salty, which I suspect was from the chicken broth. I will use this recipe again and again. I did do the gravy base prep as well as prepping the bird the night before, which I highly reccomend, saved a lot of time on Thanksgiving day (lots of herb chopping).

This was the star at Thanksgiving yesterday!!!! The Turkey was moist, flavorful and delightful... but that gravy! Wow. If you are looking for a show stopping, flavor packed gravy... look no farther. I knew it must be good from all the rave reviews I read, but truly, this was the most unique and tasty gravy I've ever had. One caveat, I used red onions instead of yellow or white, because I wanted to punch up the color and I always love a caramelized balsamic red onion.... It probably made the recipe a tad on the sweeter end, but I highly recommend it!!!

I have made this recipe for either Christmas or Thanksgiving 5 years running. It is always a big hit. I don't bother with the gravy base, I use the drippings and it works extremely well. Also, I let the rosemary, thyme and onions sit in the bottom of the pan in the drippings and brown before I add any stock. Also, I add about 2 Tbs finely chopped onion and 1 tsp fresh garlic to the butter herb mix. Makes the turkey itself taste a bit richer (very helpful if you have a wild bird and it tastes a little gamey). This is a fabulous, rich recipe. Excellent if you are like me, and hate a bland turkey.

Rating: 4
The turkey was fine, the gravy was fabulous! I made one important change, though -- after pouring off the turkey drippings, I finished the gravy in the turkey pan over two stove burners. Add the flour to the pan and stir, making a roux. Then add the onion gravy base, de-fatted drippings and you absolutely have to add more chicken stock to thin it. Let it simmer for a while. This gravy is now the standard by which all other turkey gravies are measured! A huge hit with everyone. I'll try it with beef stock next time I make a roast.

We rarely give 4 forks but this was wonderous. This was my first turkey and it turned out perfect (well, we also brined it and started it out at 450F then down to 375F as recommended elsewhere, and left it in the oven with oven off and door ajar for its 30 min resting time - these tips seemed to work out well). But as for this recipe, the flavors were superb - classic yet very flavorful, the gravy amazing and very rich, yet simple to prepare. We did however need to add a little broth to thin it out as it was too thick to pour at first. The only other thing we did differently was to put some sage leaves under the turkey skin as I cannot imagine turkey without sage. Don't hesitate to try this - you (or your guests) WON'T be disappointed!!

Had not ever roasted a Turkey so turned to the ratings system and choose from there. Seasons are opp to USA etc. down here so had a mid-winter Christmas dinner and the turkey was the star. Moist and well flavoured, made a separate gravy for my English wife and passed both around. Served with roast potatoes, yams and pumpkin. Had to print off two copies of the recipe to hand out before the guests left.

The gravy is absolutely out of this world, I made a breast and did not have as much juice, so I bumped up the liquid with some white wine. The turkey was deliciously moist and everybody raved that it is the best turkey they've ever had.

Didn't make the gravy, but the herbed butter kept my turkey very moist - which was important since it was free range and had very little fat at the end of the day - adding the broth to the pan was critical.

Very tasty bird. I did brine it first for about 12 hours in a basic brine solution - it was so juicy. The gravy was fabulous as well - different, a bit more sophisticated, but very satisfying. I cut back on the butter in the gravy quite a bit though.

This gravy was a flop. The ingredients seemed to make ones mouth water until you make it. The amount of balsamic was way too overwhelming.

I made a 1/2 recipe of the gravy base this year in order to try to stretch the amount of gravy I usually get from my roast turkey breast. It was a huge success and I will do this every year. It added richness and extra flavor and color to my gravy. You can add the mixture a tablespoonful at a time until you have enough, or it is rich enough to your liking. I was being overly careful so as not to ruin my already very decent gravy if we didn't like it, but I can assure you, there wasn't a problem! I did ease back a wee bit on the balsamic vinegar though.

Absolutely amazing. This was truly beyond compare. I couldn't belive how weel this turned out, we made two other gravy's just in case, and they never left the kitchen... this made our Thanksgiving. Be sure to really labour over the onions, I spent at least forty+ minutes on just carmelizing them and it was well worth it. I highly recommend this recipe.

I made it last night for Thanksgiving. Absolutely delicious. I took a couple of shortcuts. I ground the hazelnuts in a coffee/spice grinder to save time, and I omitted the white wine from the gravy because I didn't feel like opening a bottle (just added extra stock to compensate for the liquid difference). Also, I used bottled savory instead of summer savory because I couldn't find it in the stores. I also stuffed the turkey with homemade stuffing (very simple, just fried up some onions, bacon & proscuitto with white bread and chicken stock to moisten). I also added a sprig of rosemary inside the turkey. Instead of using canned broth, I made my own chicken broth (very easy, just boil soup bones with thyme, chicken bouillon cube). I cut down on the butter, using just one stick of unsalted organic butter in total with an 11lb turkey.

I have made this in the past after making a brined turkey which sometimes creates pan dripings not suitable for a gravy. I would either just use a good quality low salt chicken broth or if you are so motivated before hand get some turkey legs and make a stock. As far as quantityo liquid, just add enough to create the consistancy that pleases you. You can always add more liquid if it is too thick which is better than making it too thin and needing to thicken it at the end.

HELP! I would love to make this gravy on Thanksgiving, but somebody else is making the turkey. I just wanted to get an idea of how much "pan drippings" and/or "turkey stock" needs to be added to the gravy base to get the right consistency. Thanks so much to anybody who can help!

Not only was the aroma of roast turkey inebriating for the 3 hrs mine was cooking...but it tasted fabulous!

The turkey was flavorful, juicy and delicious (although I cooked it at 325 degrees, as recommended on the turkey packaging, rather than 350 degrees). The gravy was out of this world.

I ordered a pre-cooked turkey dinner that came with gravy and side dishes. I made the carmelized onion gravy base to add to the purchased gravy b/c I had some doubts about how good purchased gravy would be. I am SO glad I did!

I alspo made this for thanksgiving and it was superb!!! The turkey was moist and the seasoned butter gave it a wonderful flavor (I bought a kosher turkey as they are brined as part of the process which give a much moister bird and saves me the trouble of doing it myself). The gravy was a smash...shared some leftove gravy with a neighbor and she came back asking for more!!! I made the gravy alone a week or so later, roasting turkey legs, breast and backs, basting with some stock, then, when the meat was done, I added to the chicken stock and simmered for another hour or so on top of the stove. I also threw in a handful of green peppercorns as well which went well with the balsamic vinegar....when my neighbor found out I'd made more she begged me for some!!! I now have several containers of frozen gravy which I will use on roast chicken, or grilled turkey cutlets....my neighbor even sauted some veal and topped with the gravy....excellent recipe.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. The turkey was tender and the gravy was out of this world. Making the gravy base a day ahead, although a lot of work, really made it easier on Thanksgiving day.

Made this for Thanksgiving using a 21 lb. bird, and it was a big hit with everyone. I only used two sweet onions for the gravy base, and that was plenty for us. Added extra chicken broth when reducing the gravy. Turned out wonderful, and very moist. Will definitely make again.

This was our Thanksgiving bird this year, and while it was good and certainly worth doing again, I doubt I'll choose it for another Thanksgiving. It just doesn't have the "star quality" Thanksgiving deserves, at least in my book. Also, it was kind of a pain to have to nuke the butter in order to get it to mix with the lemon juice, then wait for the mixture to congeal, only to discover that it was WAY more butter than needed to baste the bird. (Used it for shrimp a few days later, not one to waste...)The gravy was very good, though. I think it would be great for pot roast or brisket! Next year, I'll try the honey-brined turkey everyone is raving about. Cheers!

This was a wonderful easy recipe. The carmelized onion gravy is excellent. I used sweet mayan onions for the onion base. They created a nice change to the typical turkey mashed potato, gravy tradition. The turkey was succlulent even though we had to cook it an hour more than what the recipe calls for.

Made this turkey for thanksgiving dinner along with the recommended leek and wild mushroom stuffing also from this issue. Since there were only 4 of us, I halved each recipie for a 10 lb. turkey which worked very well. As mentioned before I loved that much could be done ahead. Not the recipie I would insist on for every thanksgiving from now on but very good nonetheless.

This was my 8th Thanksgiving meal, and the last time I'll look for a gravy recipe! Loved the make ahead option. I have 9 month old twins, so this was a bonus! Added more stock to have more gravy.

I am an experienced cook and I just wished I had stuck to my tried and true wonderful turkey and gravy recipes. I think the carmalized onions would have made a good gravy base without the vinegar or the honey. All I could taste was the balsamic vinegar, and for me the honey made it taste too sweet. Ifeel like my dinner would have been far better had I just not tried something new. I had hoped it would be a fabulous change from my usual, but it was only so-so. Sorry I couldn't agree with the rest of you!
