Great basic recipe. I would definitely consider making this every week. I calculated weight watcher points and one serving is only seven points.

I thought these were delicious and fresh but fiance thought bland. I really liked the chicken marinade though I took some other reviewers advice and added paprika and cumin which I think made a huge difference. She thought it would have been better if I'd marinaded the veggies as well. Maybe next time? Either way, I think it was a great quick and easy weeknight dish.

Quick and easy, great flavor. I paired Pinot Bianco from Castello di Amorosa winery and it was great. Dinner in the back yard and the wine was a hit, also.

Just finished making and eating this: awesome and simple! I cannot believe how delicious this is. Sauteeing the chicken in the same pan you used for the onions and peppers without cleaning it in between is essential for the wonderful carmelization and integration of flavors. Yum!

I have been making this recipe for years. The method is key: you flavor the pan and oil first with the peppers and onions and jalenpeno, then infuse the chicken by searing it in the same pan, then mix everything together. There's no need for icky additional spices. Fajitas are supposed to be simple and not seasoned the way you might think in McCormicks flavor packets. I have yet to make this for anyone who complained about the taste.

I really liked this recipe. I'm not a big fan of spicy food, so I just left the marinade as is and added a pinch of hot pepper flakes to the onions as they were cooking. I also think it's better to marinate the chicken a bit longer than an hour - the flavor is better. All in all, a great fajita recipe that I will use again.

This was an excellent and simple meal. I added cumin and paprika to the chicken marinade.

This was good but not great. I wish I had taken other reviewer's advice and added more spices beyond salt and pepper. I don't know what that other reviewer was saying about baking the chicken...then again I think they just wanted to write their own recipe in here. I marinaded the chicken for just over 30 minutes, and would try a little longer if I made it again. Would give it 2.5 forks if possible.

Rating: 4
Outstanding classic fajita flavor. The only change I would make is to saute the onions and peppers at the same time to avoid burning the onions.

This is a great base for a fajita marinade but it definitely needs some seasoning. We added to this a 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin, ancho chili powder and red pepper and it came out great.

This would be a great dish if it had a little more flavor and spice to it. Instead of baking the chicken as it says. What I did was boiled full boneless chicken breasts (about 10-20 min, depending on how thick the breasts were) In the mean time I sauteed the peppers, onions and garlic. After the chicken is done, I shred it by hand, pealing piece by piece. After the chicken is fully shredded I put it in the pan with the vegetables. I put about 1/4 cup of low-sodium reduced fat chicken stock in the pan with the chicken and vegetables, I let it cook down a bit, but still have plenty of juice left so I can make a rue sauce using some of the extra juice in the pan. I take some of the juice out of the pan and a little bit of flour mix it up to make it thick instead of watery, (by doing this it holds in the flavor and you aren't eating a watered down fajita.) After mixing the flour and the extra juice I'm ready to throw it back in the pan and mix it around. Don't let it cook to much longer, it should be close to ready at this point, also you might have to play around with the juice and flour, don't be afraid to experiment. While it is cooking I add cumin spice to the mix, as well as chopped habanero peppers. Depending on your sensitivity to hot/spicy foods, I also add either red pepper flakes or chili powder. A pinch of each gives this dish a nice kick.

Excellent - very healthy and easy. I used wheat tortillas and it was a great, guilt-free meal. NOTE- the leftovers (not much) were even better!

A bit of a letdown - the citrus makes the chicken juicy, but if not for the cilantro, there wouldn't be much taste to it. Still, with all the right fix-ins (guac, sour cream, salsa, cheese), you're guaranteed a good meal.

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I give the recipe 3.5 forks and highly recommend the following modifications: (1) add a lot more spices to the marinade, such as cayenne pepper, freshly ground black pepper, cumin, an extra garlic clove and chopped cilantro; (2) cut the chicken into strips and marinate for at least 4 hours; (3) when you saute the veggies, add some worchestire sauce and spices to them; and (4) serve with sour cream, salsa, guacamole and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Also, this recipe only served 2 people, granted my fiance is a big eater. You may want to double it if you are serving over three people.

Very good basic recipe for fajitas. I also recommend adding a few extra spices to the marinade to kick up the flavor. I used cumin, and would have used some crushed red pepper if my children weren't eating it. Cutting up the chicken before marinade cuts about 20 min off of total prep/cook time.

At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to try these. Fajitas on the stovetop? Everyone in Texas knows to grill fajita meat, right! Well, I decided to try it anyway, and we loved them. I agree with many others about additional spices and flavorings. We love cilantro, cumin, chili powder, fresh (not pickled) diced jalapenos and added lots to the marinade. But oregano? No can do. Also, we cut the chicken and let it marinate overnight. These ended up being very tender and better than the chicken fajitas in many TexMex restaurants. Now if I can only find restaurant style tortillas in the grocery store... One more thing, if you have lots of time, make Rick Bayless's Green Poblano Rice recipe and Frijoles Borrachos (both found on this site) for a full and yummy meal.

Rating: 2
I added a little of all the suggested additions--tabasco, cumin, oregano, etc--and still thought this dish was just OK. While the marinade smelled delicious, only the lime flavor permeated into the meat. Maybe I needed to add more of each ingredient, but I wouldn't bother to make it again.

My boyfriend loves this. We make this once a week and assemble few extra wraps for the next day. According to the previous raters, I added some chili sauce, oregano, thyme, worchestire, and soy sauce to the marinade to give it an extra kick. As I said above, the next day it makes a perfect lunch on the run.

This fajitas recipe was delicious! I spiced it up, as some reviewers sugested, with a bit of oregano, cayenne, paprika, thyme and garlic powder. This has to be the best fajita recipe I have ever tried. I ended up eating the left-overs for breakfast and dinner the next day...

Very good! Usually I don't bother to comment, but this time...you have to make it. Simple, delicious, even cold it is a treat. Nice discovery is bell peper+ red onion. If you top roman lettuce and wallnut (or cedar nut) salad with it, that's the most fantastic texture, crispy salad to accompany every fish or poultry dish. Special thanxs to marinade- easy and sooo good for chicken.

We enjoyed this version of fajitas, with a few changes. I added one jalepeno pepper, chopped. Mixed all marinade ingredients in food processor. Marinated for about 4 hours, and grilled chicken, peppers, and onions. Cut up peppers and onions after grilling. Very good.

Four forks because it can be very simple and it can be very good. Simple: add 2 tsp cumin and white onion [rather than red] to the marindade (skip bell peppers, etc.), wait 10 min., grill/fry. For very good, add to the marinade 2 tsp cumin, 2 thinly sliced red chili peppers, bell peppers and onion. Marinade 1 day. The only consistent change is to add the onion/bell peppers/cumin/red peppers, etc. to the marinade -- substantially improves everything. Of course, I like it spicy.

Wonderful meal. I've tried a lot of Epicurious's recipes, and this is the one that my family has liked the most so far. I doubled the recipe, added chili powder and cumin to the marinade, and marinaded the chicken for four hours, which gave it a very strong, penetrating lime taste, but that seemed to work well for this recipe. My husband and five children inhaled this meal. A family member had snacked on tortillas earlier in the day, and at dinnertime I didn't have as many tortillas as I'd originally planned, so I left one chicken breast whole and ate the meal (marinaded chicken breast, sauteed peppers, Spanish rice, and salad) without tortillas. I thought that it was wonderful that way, too.

Delicious and easy to make. I actually cut up the chicken before marinating and I feel it gave the chicken more flavor. Also added a bit of cayenne to give a little kick and accompanied by Epicurious recipe for "Guacamole." Family raved!

A cook from "the South" wrote, "The cook from VA should try heading towards Texas and the border before issuing uninformed judgements." I dunno about the VA cook, but I was raised in the heart of the largest Mexican population in the U.S., and I'm glad I don't exhibit such regional snobbery. This is a great recipe, and I've even marinated the chicken overnight with good results. Oh--and I call them "fajitas," and my Mexican friends don't seem to mind.

My family really enjoys the fajita mixes. I added ground cumin and oregano to the marinade and used 1 Tbls. of oil in the mix. I just spray oil from a misto can as needed to cook. I've used the same recipe for 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 lbs. pork sirloin cut in thin strips. With the pork I add 1/4 cup of orange juice to the marinade. I marinate this for at least 4 hours. Most of the time we eat this as a burrito with refried black or pinto beans included.

I only used 2 tsps of oil to saute the onions and peppers. I added garlic, fresh cilantro & a pinch of cayenne to the onions and peppers, & cooked them coverd until they were really soft.

I may be only 19 years old, but I found this recipe could use a few extra touches. I found if you are a little more generous with the oil and if you split the chicken breasts by twos and marinate in small ziploc bags, the flavor seems to lock in a little more (and you are able to periodically flip the bags as they marinate). Also, I don't pay much attention to the exact measurements of the recipe. I just dump everything in. After marinating, I grill the chicken outside on a grill as opposed to the indoor skillet. This helps TREMENDOUSLY. My boyfriend said they were better than any restaurant fajitas and that he would take them over going out any day!

This was an easy recipe to follow and the results were fantastic. My husband and son are usually very picky, but even they loved it. I added some oregano, paprika and thyme to the marinade, and substituted lemon juice for lime, just b/c I didn't have any lime. It still came out delicious. I will definitely make this on a regular basis. A healthy, light and really good meal.

This is the chicken fajita recipe I use over and over again. My family loves it and it comes out great every time. I grill the chicken and then slice it before serving. Sometimes I grill steak with it too, and have chicken and beef fajitas together. The marinade is great and I use it even when I'm not making fajitas, but want grilled chicken with some kind of cold sauce in the summer. I've served it for dinner parties and it was a big hit. Easy and delicious, what more could you want? I've added lots of other condiments as well, guacamole, salsa, cheese, try you own variations and use this as a base.

The cook from VA wouldn't have the first clue what a good Mexican restaurant is, much less know what a good fajita tastes like. The cook from VA should try heading towards Texas and the border before issuing uninformed judgements. Regardless of what they call the tacos for the benefit of the masses, they are still just tacos. A fajita is still just beef.

The cook from "the south" apparently hasn't ventured into any Mexican restaurant since 1986. In much the same way that "kleenex" has come to mean any brand of facial tissue, "fajitas" with numerous varieties of meat are on menus everywhere. These were very tasty and easy to prepare, and I'll definitely make them again (lower-fat than the beef version, too).
