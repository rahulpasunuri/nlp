This was tasty, though I'm not sure I was over the moon about it. I'd make it again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I don't think I'd actively seek it out. I DID really like the viniagrette (left out the mayo) as well as the contrast of textures. I threw in some thinly sliced red onion and that added a nice dimension.

I left out the mayo in the dressing and it was still delicious. I like the combination of the vinegars. I used a Fig Balsamic. Very yummy.

I made this salad for a dinner party and added some sliced red onion which gave it a great flavor. Everyone loved this salad. I got rave reviews over this one. Several people asked for the recipe. This is definately a keeper.

I thought this was a delicious salad that was a bit different than your normal salad. An great accompaniment to the broiled salmon with avocado and lime relish in the Bon Appetit Every Night Cooking cookbook.
