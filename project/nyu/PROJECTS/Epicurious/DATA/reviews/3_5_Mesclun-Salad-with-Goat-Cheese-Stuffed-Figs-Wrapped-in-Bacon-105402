This is hands down the best bacon-wrapped fig/cheese recipe i have tried! However - you have to be crazy to throw out the removed flesh! Use it to make a killer dressing invloving good balsamic, port and soaked dried figs.

Every time I've served this both as an appetizer and as a salad it has been to rave reviews. I too have substituted gorgonzola sucessfully. And, it's great with pears instead of figs!

Four forks are simply not enough if you like figs. Truly lovely dish and the kids love it too. Surely a keeper.

Just great! Have varied recipe with dates in place of figs, and gorgonzola in place of goat cheese, and it's lovely every time.

This is a great recipe. I also use gorgonzola in place of the goat cheese sometimes for a little extra kick.

This was a wonderful use of the abundant figs we are receiving at this time of year. I used proscuitto instead of bacon and that shortened the process as it was not necessary to pre-cook the meat. Even my picky teenager loved it!

My girlfriend served this salad last weekend for us and I just loved it. Very interesting combination! I will definately do again.

I enjoyed this recipe but next time I would skip the lettuce & just serve the figs hot as an appetizer. I also was unable to get fresh figs so I used sun-dried. I cut them in half I put a good slice of goat cheese in the middle & then wrapped them in bacon. The rub on the outside of the bacon almost carmelized it. Very good!

I made this with the bacon and without, broiling the halves with the brown sugar mix on top. I preferred the later version, as the bacon over powered the mild flavor of the fig. I'll definitely make this again. It was fast, easy and made an elegant presentation.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and look forward to making the others from the outstanding "Fig" story in the August issue.

You're real funny, Mobile, but we've all heard that joke before!

I loved this salad, but didn't have all the necessary ingrediants at home when I tried and ended up substituting a few things: instead of mesclun, I used romaine - instead of goat cheese, I used parmigian - instead of figs, I used croutons - instead of bacon, I used anchovies. The resultant salad was delicious, but reminded me a little of a Caesar salad.

Nice recepie. On a weekday id skip the whole bacon-thing, and just broil the halved figs, stuffed with the goatcheese. For a cool saladdressing i would blend the scooped out fig-flesh with a red wine vinegar, and than add some nut oil or so. Take care, Jerome, Rio Brazil.
