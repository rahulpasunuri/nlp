I was not impressed with these. They were bland and boring and did not have good texture. I have made a lot biscuits in my day and these don't make the cut.

These have become a Thanksgiving staple. They are heavenly. Very easy to make. I've tried making them in advance, but far prefer their freshness cooked just in advance of the meal.

These are good. My changes were: - I halved the recipe. One egg halved, yes, I beat it & added about 1/2 t.milk, then used half into the mixture; - I used Half-n-Half, because that's what I had; - I used salted butter, because that's what I had. With these alterations, the biscuits were flaky, very tasty, and a touch too salty. So if you're halving, use a touch less salt or use unsalted butter - my suggestion.

These biscuits were super easy to make and the dough was great to work with. They smell great while baking too, will definitely make again!

I have to admit I did not quite make these biscuits correctly. I had a fussy baby at my heels and was working quickly, and I somehow misread the directions for rolling out. I rolled them about half as thin as the recipe called for. Consequently, they came out thin and a little more crackery than they were supposed to, but they were still fantastically delicious! They're definitely flakey biscuits, not fluffy. I made them for a holiday dinner at which a pork roast was served, and the thyme/pepper combo complimented the meat perfectly. These were also simple to make (just read the directions, ha). They even tasted great the next day. In fact, I think rolling them thin like I did would make them a fabulous base for a canape! I'll definitely be trying these again to experience the proper texture.

These are the perfect biscuits I've been looking for. Delicious! I used cream instead of whole milk because that's what I had on hand. I love the combination of black pepper and thyme but because I was out of thyme I added just a 1/4 tsp of ground coriander for a different effect. Like the other reviewer, I ended up with more than 16 2" biscuits: 28, in fact.

These biscuits were awesome! I changed the recipe some the second time that I made them because I wanted a specific flavor combination to compliment a meal: 2 c. flour, 1T baking soda, 1t salt and 1 1/2 sticks butter blended in an electric stand mixer until resembled coarse corn meal. Add 1/2 tsp black pepper and 3/4 c. sharp white cheddar. Add 1 large egg and 1/2 cup heavy cream and mix until just combined. Awesome with seafood!

I make these each year at Thanksgiving. I usually make them ahead and freeze them which works very well. They are always a big hit, and a nice alternative to a regular dinner bread.

Made these exactly as described and they were a big hit at Thanksgiving this year. The thyme complements a traditional stuffing & gravy well.

My husband, (not the family cook) made these on Thanksgiving, to help me out. Very good, even my extrememly picking nephew loved them, and this kid doesn't even eat mashed potatoes! His mom even brought his own white rolls becuase he won't eat anything else, well he ate these and loved them!

Very tasty. Perhaps I rolled a bit thinner than .5", but not much and obtained 36 2" biscuits. Made ahead and then reheated. Wonderfully light and easy to make. Next time I may try with basil or oregano instead of thyme.
