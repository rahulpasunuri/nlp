I had the hardest time with this dough, and I'm not sure why. I have made many tart/pie doughs and this one did NOT come together as written. It took a ton of kneading to get it into a ball, then when I tried to roll it out it fell apart. I patched it back together but when I tried to move it to the pan it crumbled into a million pieces again. I ended up just pressing it into the pan like a crumb crust, which actually worked ok. But the finished tart was really tough to cut. Maybe adding more ice water would have done it.

A reply to the question from "A Cook from Southern California" (allbeit 2 1/2 yrs later!) I followed a link from another recipe that asked for this crust recipe. This would lead me to believe that the recipe that requires this crust recipe will tell you how hot to bake it at and for how long. I.e. the recipe I was looking at, Cranberry Walnut Tart, says to bake at the 425 for 15 that she did end up doing. I would imagine other recipes would alert you of any changes.

I made this and loved it but was a little put off by the lack of cooking temp and time. I did the standard 425 for 15 minutes and all was well, but does anyone have other suggestions?

This is a great pastry recipe, I've always been a bit scared of pastry but this was simple. I followed the advice of another recipe for the kneading with the heel of your hand, and made sure not to overdo it. I made a tart with roasted pears and cranberries, but it was the pastry that made it so good...

Excellent! Just like Mark Bittman's (How To Cook Everything). Only change I make is to add the egg yolk - then the water one tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together. In humid Florida, the water quantity can vary over a tablespoon and half.
