3.5 forks. Very tasty; a new Easter tradition. I left out the tomatoes and added a tiny bit more wasabi paste based on the reviews. The final result was palatable for all, so I could see adding more chile or a few drops of hot sauce depending on your crowd. The kick seemed to be coming from the wasabi. I had a lot of filling leftover and the eggs were packed full.

I made this for a neighborhood Chili Cook Off and they are fantastic and were gone in a minute. People raved about them. The veggies need to be very finely chopped/minced and the avocado very small dice. Reviews said it needed more wasabi so I used about 2 teaspoons and I think it was a tad too much. I tested it after 1 teaspoon and you could hardly taste it. I used Canola FF Mayo. I had about 2/3 cup leftover filling and it was good with tortilla chips.

Made to directions and took advise of other cooks and doubled the wasabi. I think it's the quality of the wasabi. My batch was bland also. I expected more kick. I added a pinch of sesame oil and tobasco (in lieu of jalepeno). Next time I'll drop the sesame and get a different brand of wasabi then use about 1/8 cup of wasabi. This would be good on cucumber slices also.

Yummy, even without the tomato and scallion. I am making these for a Halloween party and calling them "Bedeviled Eggs". As others have noted, you can up the amount of wasabi for more kick.

I've made these twice now (adding a little extra wasabi) and they were a huge hit both times! Definitely a fun twist, but still very easy.

AWFUL!!! AWFUL!!!!AWFUL!!!!!. I always use recipes from this site and almost always love them but this one is gross. Flavors don't go together and the look is disgusting. Don't know who anyone could make these in advance because the avocado causes them to get a really disgusting greyish tint if not eaten quickly.

These were very good, I made them for a meeting last night and, before I knew it, they were gone. I will make these again for Easter, the grandkids will love them!

These were crazy good at Easter and will make them again. They definitely stole the show. I didn't know that everyone would like them otherwise I wouldn't have bothered with making classic deviled eggs...I did add more spicy ingredients to make them hotter/spicier.

I am getting ready to make these for the third time and we love this recipe as is... maybe it'll be even better if I add more wasabi and serrano as others have done. Even people who don't like classic deviled eggs go crazy over these!

I am not a deviled egg fan at all, so I was apprehensive at first. I figured it would be a recipe I would make for everyone except me. Boy was I wrong! They came out great and even I loved it! I will use this recipe again and again. One note, if making day ahead, squeeze some extra lime juice on top of each egg to keep the color from turning brown.

these were great, as is, but love the idea of doubling the wasabi and serrano.

Doubled the wasabi and peppers--we like hot here in Texas. Turned out great!

I also found these to be a little bland. I was expecting a real kick but they hust weren't that spicy.

These were such a great twist on deviled eggs. I didn't have the pepper, so I doubled (at least) the wasabi to make the spice a little more intense.

Bland and boring. There are a lot of spicy ingredients here, yet even when I upped the quantity of horseradish, there still was such bland flavor. Maybe I didn't add enough salt. Nonetheless, the labor required for these just wasn't worth it.

I loved this different version. I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of canned chipotle (smoked jalapeño) for the serrano and added 1/4 cup roasted red pepper. Very yummy!

I was worried when I saw the list of ingredients, but they work very well together! Made these for a baby shower of 60 people. Definitely no complaints - but some good seated humor over thier color!

These were great but i thought perhaps a little tweeking was in order, i added a cup of wasabi, removed the advocado, and added more hot peppers, it was amazing, in ten minutes a tray of 36 were gone.

Not a big fan of deviled eggs but these were delicious. My guests loved them too! Easy to make and they'll become a staple of my party fare.

I had both regular deviled eggs and these at my easter party and these were definitely the favourites although everyone ate the deviled eggs as well. The mixture of normal deviled eggs and these made for a pretty presentation.

I made this when asked to bring deviled eggs to a party. I hate deviled eggs but couldn't get enough of these, they'll be a staple every Easter

This was a nice twist on regular deviled eggs. Next time I would use more wasabi and more serano pepper-we like it spicy. But our guests thought the eggs were very good!
