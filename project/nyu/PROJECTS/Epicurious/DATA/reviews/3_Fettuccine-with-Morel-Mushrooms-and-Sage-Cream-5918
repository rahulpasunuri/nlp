I made this with 2oz fresh morels, 4 oz fresh wild mushroom mix, white wine instead of red, and added parmigiano-reggiano at the end. Delicious gourmet vegetarian dish.

Absolutely delicious! I used 1tb of olive oil AND 1tb of butter rather than 2tbs of olive oil. I used 8oz of fresh morels instead of dried and sauteed them with the onion till they'd given up their liquid before proceeding with the recipe, serving it with generous portion of Parmesan cheese. Really really good, satisfying, comfort food. There was a hint of color with the red onions and the fresh sage in my version, so complaints about ugliness are unwarranted imho. Will definitely make again!

Definitely a good dish as-is, but needs a bit of zing to step it up. My sauce was a nice brownish color, but I would've reduced it a bit more and added some parmesan to the sauce along with more salt and pepper.

Delicious. I used fresh morels and served over soft polenta instead of pasta.

I thought this was easy and tasty. I served it as a first course for four, followed by a salad with vinaigrette, and then fish. I didn't have dried morels, so I substituted dried woodland mushrooms. The sauce was more of a toasty brown than gray for me. I used homemade fettucine.

If you like gray pasta sauce, this dish is perfect. The sauce is ugly - thankfully I wasn't making it for a dinner party. I agree with the other reviewer about dumping a lot of salt (I added freshly grated parmesan cheese too) to add some flavor.

NASTY! I thought this sounded good, however, it was not pretty on the plate, and it was lackluster in the taste department. Needed alot more salt. Possibly omit the red wine.
