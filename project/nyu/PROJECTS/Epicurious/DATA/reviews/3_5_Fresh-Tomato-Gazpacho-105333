This recipe is great, though there is a bit too much vinegar for my taste. I used white wine vinegar which I think is better, and next time I'll probably use half the amount. Otherwise, fantastic recipe. Don't forget to add a pinch of salt...

I followed this recipe almost exactly (I let the mixture sit for 3 hours instead of 1 because I had to go do something.) It was delicious! We have so many tomatoes from the garden, I'll be making this again.

Really yummy! I doubled the garlic and used V8 juice instead of water to give it more flavor. My whole family loved it.

yummmm... the perfect classic gazpacho. It would probably be great with a little green pepper or jalapeno added for a little heat, but is perfectly delish as is.

I don't know what it was about this gazpacho but it came out awful. The sherry vinegar (which normally I love with anything tomato-based) was strong enough to make me choke. I ended up tossing the soup. I'm going to stick with the gazpacho recipe I love that's also on Epi--Andalusian Gazpacho.

Wow. This is awesome. Followed recipe plus added fresh jalapeno. Amazing.

Followed the recipe to the letter. The bread I used was a homemade half-white sourdough. Absolutely delicious and oh so refreshing. I think to serve I'll pop a bottle of Tabasco on the table. Am serving it tonight with some chicken legs marinated in marjoram, garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper and olive oil. Can't wait!

Really good! I made it with tomatoes and a cucumber (not English) right out of the garden. I didn't add quite as much water because the tomatoes surrendered a lot of liquid during preparation. Freshly ground black pepper and salt were added individually at the table. What I really liked was that the spices were more in added complexity rather than heat. Excellent.

Quite good - I added 1/4 cup of lime juice, a little tabasco sauce, and used red wine vinegar instead of sherry - all changes worked just fine.

Because raw onion doesn't agree with us, I cooked the onion, giving a sweeter flavor, and a good contrast to the vinegar. I used only about a 1/5 cup of vinegar and wished I'd used less: add it by spoonfuls! Peeled and pureed the tomatoes, peeled the peppers, and only processed about 1/2 of the soup. Our tomatoes had very little juice, so I added a little water when pureeing the bread as a last step. Couldn't taste the paprika; and should it be hot or sweet paprika? I think this recipe would also work without the vinegar and bread as a delightful fresh tomato soup.

Used only 1/2 cup onion, per previous suggestions. Served with garnish of chopped cucumber, onion, red & green bell pepper, and hard boiled egg.

Way too much onion. I reduced the 1 cup that was called for to maybe 3/4 cup and still found that was too much. Worth another attempt though.

This recipe was AWESOME! I went to Jamaica and had gazpacho everyday, and had the craving. I only used half the bread, soaked it as suggested by a previous reviewer, and did not add any additional water when pureeing. It definitely did not need the extra water. Also, I wanted a 'chunkier' gazpacho so I only strained half of it. Make sure if you do not strain it, to peel your tomatoes and peppers first.

Love, love, love! I left out the bread, decreased the amount of onion like another reviewer recommended, and increased the vinegar a touch. Freakin' fabulous. Cold, tomatoey, perfect.

My husband loves gazpacho. Had it everywhere in spain. This recipe is pretty comparable and tastes great.

An excellent gazpacho recipe. BUT cut the bread and vinegar in half. Leave out the water when pureeing. The vegetables may be watery, and then you won't need to add extra water. Add the water only if the soup is too thick. Soak the bread in water for 1/2 minute, and then squeeze it dry before pureeing it with the vegetables. If you peel the pepper with a vegetable peeler, and pass the tomatoes through a food mill, you won't need to strain the soup and the texture will be more interesting. No need to chop the vegetables if you are going to puree them. Just cut them in small pieces. Red wine vinegar is just as good as sherry vinegar. The paprika is supperfluous. Can be garinshed with small whole fresh basil leaves. Use plum tomatoes if possible. They're meatier and have less water.

Everyone LOVED this gazpacho! The only tomatoes available the day I made it were Roma variety. I was concerned that the flavor might be too strong but I was pleasantly surprised, it was delicious. Couldn't find sherry vinegar, so had to use red wine vinegar - I don't think it affected the final outcome at all. Wonderful soup!

This is a FANTASTIC gazpacho recipe... VERY authentic!!! I use a little less bread and onion, and don't do the final straining! I make this ALL the time now! PS - get VERY fresh, sweet tomatoes for the best results... I always get htem from the Farmer's Market

Colorado on 6/19 - no, gazpacho is not always crunchy so if you don't know, don't criticise. This is a wonderful recipe and tastes refreshing. One of my favourites!

I used to make this dish but added sliced black olives. This is a favorite summer dish.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times now, most recently for my boyfriend's birthday party, and it has never failed to impress. Also, one sip and I instantly feel revived and ready to go. My only adjustments have been to use 1/2 yellow and 1/2 red tomatoes, increase the cucumber to 2 regular (not english, but from the farmer's market), and cut down on the bread. Yum!

Excellent! For once, a gazpacho that is not chunky, but thin, smooth & flavorful as I remember having in Spain.

This Gazpacho is very reminiscent of the kind I ate when I lived in Barcelona. Traditionaly gazpacho is very smooth in texture with no chunks. I garnished with very finely diced cucumbers. Serve with toasted crusty peasant bread rubbed with a tomato, sprinkled with coarse salt and drizzled with olive oil for an authentic spanish dish.

This soup is delicious. I usually add an extra garlic clove and garnish with some diced red onion and fresh basil. Also, I put it through a food mill for the final straining and it comes out really smooth. I love it in a glass for breakfast!

This is a very uncomplicated, traditional Spanish style (no chunks) gazpacho. I followed the recipe closely, subsituting only one ingredient. I used three parts red wine vinegar mixed w/ one part sherry, instead of sherry vinegar. The overall result was a flavorfull, smooth and extremely refreshing soup. Everyone who tried it declared it fantastic!

The flavors were rather average and the whole thing lacked punch. Also, isn't gazpacho supposed to have more crunchy things in it? I won't be making this recipe again.

Very very good. Fun to make, too!

I thought this was a good soup, with a couple of modifications. First, I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used half white wine, half red wine vinegars, which worked out fine. Also, I used less bread than called for. And lastly, I didn't go through the final straining. After pureeing, I just added about a cup of chopped cucumber - I think the coarse texture is one of the appealing things about this type of soup. All in all, it's a very fresh, fun, easy soup, and very satisfying to prepare with all the chopping of fresh, colorful veggies!

Great soup. Couple of tid-bits: 1. I used sourdough bread instead of normal french bread. Bad idea!!! Please do not use any other bread other than the good old french/italian campesino bread. If you like thin gazpachos, use 3 cups of bread and not 4. 2. Taste the tomato before deciding on amount of Sherry Vinegar. If you use young tomatoes that are not very ripe, you could use less vinegar. All in all, delicious.

This is my favorite gazpacho recipes. I make it with only a few exceptions. I use maybe two cups of bread, not four. I omit the cumin. And I add back in a handful or two of cucumber, green bell pepper and red onion after the soup has been pureed, to add some crunch. The sherry vinegar is important, try not to substitute.

I loved this soup. I served it with grilled turkey burgers and fresh succotash for a perfect summer dinner. It was a little hard to puree as the bread soaked up the liquid and I ran out of water. I used the finished soup instead of adding more water to finish the puree. I was worried it would become to watery if I used more water. The soup had great color. I used sliced scallion as garnish.
