I made this with three 1-lb bone-in chicken breasts, and made 1/3 of the marinade. It was super-easy, and the chicken was golden-brown and gorgeous. I reduced (maybe over-reduced?) the marinade and it was so salty that, while I thought the chicken tasted fine, the reduced marinade was far too salty to eat. I couldn't eat at all. I think next time I will simply discard the marinade and not reduce it.

I had doubts over this one but I have to admit it's an excellent marinade. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated overnight. Lovely rich flavor!

This was an easy, but super tasty marinade. I only had 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, so I made 1/3 of the marinade. My family loved it!

The chicken was juicy and very flavorful I made the recipe with chicken legs and cut the recipe by 2/3. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and I still found the chicken salty. If you love Asian cuisine, definitely give this a try.

Way to salty!

Very tastey, lots of flavor I used the recipe as is except I used it on baby-back ribs and marinaded them overnight. Baked on rack on low temp. for 2 hours then kicked the temp up to 400 for last 60 min. turning over half way through. The family licked the bones clean. Even my picky-son.

Pretty good, although based on the reviews I have to admit I was expecting a bit more flavor. It ended being kind of ...soy saucy. I made a last minute decision to cut the roasted chicken, throw it in with some veggies and use the reduced sauce to make a stir-fry - which was pretty tasty. Maybe add some ginger next time, or orange, as another review suggested.

Made this with chicken breasts on the grill and then used the sauce for vegetable stir fry. It was very salty; I'd either use low sodium soy next time, or cut it with chicken stock. I think also I'd add the juice of half of an orange.

definitely a winner. I made this for new years eve, and everyone asked for the recipe. It has become one of our staples. I boil the marinade then put in a container for next time.

Terrific - and simple! Everyone loved it. I even tried it with boneless breasts and it was great. If you use boneless, skinless chicken, be sure not to overcook.

My husband's self imposed dietary restrictions limit what I can make. Recently, he suggested "fusion" food so I tried this and he really like it, a lot. By mistake, I used low sodium soy sauce and I was glad I did because it did not need any more "sodium." It was just right. It's got a lot of cumin kick so decrease if necessary. I reduced the recipe by two thirds and it still worked well, although the cooking time was significantly less given that I didn't have to change pan positions.

Delicious. I made it for three, so I used 8 thighs and cut the marinade by 1/4. Worked perfectly, and I boiled down the marinade to pour over rice.

This was an excellent recipe - which I wasn't sure about at the beginning. I only had two drumsticks and two thighs so I halved the marinade. The cooking time was perfect and I ended up with very juicy, just cooked chicken. I wasn't crazy about the marinade reduction - too sticky and sweet for me, but my husband loved it. Next time I'm going to grill the chicken as I think the marinade will char wonderfully on the chicken skin. I think you could get away with putting the chicken in the marinade in the am before you go to work and then cooking it when you get home in the evening. I'm definitely making this again!

I have made this a couple of times because it is so easy and very tasty. My husband and son love it too. Although I cut the recipe in half and cook less chicken.

I made this for a crowd of 20+ this weekend (including both adults and teens). It was a hit with everyone. Highly recommended!

Yum! Flavor was fantastic. So easy to make. Made this with chicken thighs only...had it with baked sweet potato and steamed veggies. Love, love, loved it!

Great way to spice up baked chicken. The flavors were delicious. The recipe appears much more complicated than it really is. I halved the sauce- marinated 3 lg bone- in breasts for an hour, then baked on middle rack the whole time turning once. Drizzling the sauce over chicken, wild rice and asparagus at end. Lime is a nice touch as well. Outstanding meal.

I wasn't sure how well cumin would go with soy sauce but it turned out to be a great combination.

This is so good. I made it for company and they all want the recipe. I use it as a marinade for boneless, skinless chicken that we do on the bbq - it is super moist and the smoky taste is a hit!

I used only chicken thighs and cut the marinade recipe into about a third for a light supper for my husband and me. I tossed them on the grill and cooked them and served with rice and grilled pineapple. It was a great summer dinner. The chicken has wonderful flavor.

A very tasty, easy meal. The chicken marinated longer than suggested because of a last minute scheduling snafu. Will definitely make this again.

Really easy and super recipe. I cooked it on a grill in an aluminum disposable pan. It's just delicious and so easy!!

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made - fabulous.

I made this recipe over charcoal instead of in the oven and it was wonderful. You have to be careful when searing the chicken on the grill because of the sugar content. Keep it moving until crisp then finish over indirect heat. I've made it twice now and we love it.

Not crazy about this myself, but my son loved it.
