Great dessert. Tasty. Lots of complements. Very easy. Substituted chocolate chocolate chip cookies for the wafers and 2 oz of unsweetened baking choc for the chips.

I enjoyed this pie. It was very rich but wonderful during the summer time following some grilling.

Despite all the not-so-stellar reviews, went ahead and made it. I rate it 2 and a half forks (not quite 3). I enjoyed eating it, it was perfect for the event I was serving it at, but I don't think it was that special. Given all the comments in these reviews, I made the following changes: used oreas (some without the filling) for the crust; omitted the sugar; used 1/2 cup creme fraiche; used 2/3 of the can of sweetened condensed milk. The result? It was the perfect blend of sweetness and tartness, it cut through with a little effort, and the filling held up even though it wasn't as solid as, for example, a cheesecake.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit! The only change I made was a little less sugar for the crust. The filling thickened fine, the flavors were great, the whole thing was delicious. and it held up nicely for leftovers

This was EXCELLENT. The only thing I added were about 5 oreos to the crust. It came out perfect...served at a party and EVERYONE loved it...even non dessert eaters! It's so easy to make I made it for work too! I would definately make this again1

Taking a tip from all the previous reviews, I changed this recipe in the following ways: 1. Softened 1 packet of gelatin in the 1/4 cup of lemon juice; 2. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 3/4 cup of the sweetened condensed milk; 3. Added 1/2 tsp of almond extract; 4. Used a 12-oz. bag of frozen raspberries. When the first three ingredients were all whipped together with my immersion blender, I tossed in a 12-oz. package of frozen raspberries. Because the raspberries were frozen, they chilled the mixture instantly, and it set up well. I poured the raspberry filling into a purchased oreo cookie pie crust, and put the pie in the fridge. I believe the cloying taste of the sweetened condensed milk was obliterated by using only 3/4 of a cup, plus the addition of the almond extract, heavy cream, and the entire 12-oz. bag of frozen raspberries. The pie filling tasted great, and I can't wait until it really firms up, so we can have it for dessert.

This was horrible and a waste of money on ingredients. It was so sweet, we ended up tossing the entire thing. If I had it to do over, I would use unsweetened condensed milk and less butter to the crust so it would not stick like wax to the pie pan. A far nicer medium is cream cheese and whipping cream for this type of pie/torte.

Was pressed for time, so I used a store-bought premade chocolate pie crust. It still tasted wonderful and was enjoyed by all. Now they want the recipe!

I made this pie for a 4th of July BBQ. Realized I didn't have lemons and used fresh lime juice and zest instead. Added a dollop more of creme fraiche than called for. Also used a very low sugar plain chocolate kid's snack cookie for the crust (1 measured cup after processing into crumbs). It turned out great! I was even asked for the recipe. You do have to press hard to get through the crust, but I'd think if you omit the melted chocolate aspect you'd end up with a soggy crust. The lime juice, I think, really perked up the raspberry flavor and downplayed the sweetness of the dish overall. My filling set up just fine, even through a half-hour car drive after being in the fridge for only an hour (it was then in the fridge for about 3 hours after that before serving). I will definitely make this again, probably with the lime juice too as it turned out so tasty!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it wasn't that spectacular. The elements don't work together well. There are much better uses for such delcious ingredients.

Couldn't find creme fraiche so used thick sour cream but don't think that explains the entire failure. The filling didn't set up even after 6 hours, it would have never cut and stayed together. It also was syrupy sweet, though you could taste the lemon. So I wound up whipping a pint of cream and folding in. I might try it again with creme fraiche to see if it really makes a difference, but I think I would still prefer to lighten it with whipped cream or add some liquer to cut the gooey sweet taste.

I served this at a dinner party after Lobster Paella and everyone FINISHED their plate. One guest even had triples! If you think this is too sweet you must suck on lemons for snacks. I followed the recipes exactly, only added a bit more raspberries, as I had a lot that were going mushy. Had no trouble getting it out of the pie plate, and it cut and served beautifully--even the first slice. Mine chilled about 6 hours before cutting. Making it again tomorrow.

More like 3 1/2 forks, but closer to 4 than 3. I'm so surprised at some of the comments for this recipe! With the addition of the lemon juice I don't know how this could be considered too sweet! It does not hold super well, but that doesn't hurt the taste, and it holds well enough to serve. I have not been able to find chocolate wafer cookies, so I use Nilla wafers with the chocolate chips. Have also used strawberries in place of raspberries. Just delicious!

This recipe was delicious as is (very rich), but then I changed it a bit and I thought it was even better. I made a plain crust, chopped the bittersweet chocolate and included that in the cream and then crumbled some of the chocolate wafers over the top. Yum!

Way too sweet, the filling was not firm enough, maybe a frozen pie would have been better. Tough getting crust out.

This was so easy to make! Everyone loved it. A great Summer dessert. Followed the recipe exactly, but would agree with another cook who suggested to serve it without the crust as another option.

This was an amazing pie. I doubled the recipe and made in a spring form pan - no problem with sticking but it did take a sharp knife to cut right through. Used 3 pints of raspberries. this filling was perfect mix of sweet and sour. It was easy, will make it again.

Wouldn't make it again, although I did like how the crust came out and might well pirate that for another recipe. The filling was too sweet, cloyingly so. Might be improved by a layer of very lightly sweetened whipped cream on the top, but I think I'd just search for another recipe instead. Kind of a disappointment

This pie turned out nicely thanks to all of the advice below. I skipped the extra chocolate in the crust and used a little bit of gelatin to firm up the filling. The lemon plus creme fraiche added a nice little sour punch. Perfect for a summer get together.

I say forget the crust and serve, firm or not, as a creamy berry dessert. Looks great in a fancy glass or just spooned into a bowl.

for the most part i liked this recipe. i added more raspberries on top just because i love them. i found the sweetened condensed milk made the bites that didn't have a raspberry too sweet and syrupy, but as long as there was enough fruit, it had a very nice flavor. the crust was really tasty...i used oreos, but i was too lazy to remove the filling, and i think that softened it up a bit, too. it was still on the hard side, but it was manageable. the pie self-destructed very quickly once out of the fridge, so make sure to keep it chilled up until the last minute. it definitely wouldn't work to carry to a picnic.

Wow! That's a traffic grouping of taste. I lined my pie pan with parchment paper and I didn't have any trouble getting the slices out. I also did not have any trouble getting the filling to set, in fact it was set good enough to cut in an hour and a half.

We found this much better on the THIRD NIGHT after it had been made. Somehow the flavors seemed to meld after aging and the result was much more appealing than night one or two. If it had tasted as good on the first night, I doubt there would have been any leftovers for the following evenings.

This made for a lovely presentation.A very refreshing dessert--the lemon and raspberry flavors worked well together. Famous Chocolate Wafers are great to have in your pantry. I plan to make this pie over and over.

I made this with strawberries because the local strawberries here in Ventura County are extraordinary. I added some vanilla to the crust and it added some depth of flavor. The lemony filling was great. I used lemons from my backyard. Here in Ventura County one of my favorite scents is when I'm driving by lemon tree fields and strawberry fields. The smell is intoxicating. The filling tasted like that smell and pared perfectly with the dark chocolate crust. Yummy.

I am so mad about how this turned out. The crust was glued to the pie plate and the filling did not set up. I could not serve it. I gave it two forks because it did taste great, but only for immediate family. :)

I used a premade chocolate crust (easy and still yummy). I had no problems with the recipe only that when I tried to eat it the same night (it had chilled for about 2 hours) it was still pretty runny, however overnight it's fine! I also left out the lemon zest. It's very tasty!

I made the pie exactly as written and served it to a group of friends. They all loved it. I did not find it too lemony but do agree that the pie was hard to cut. I also don't see the need to add the additional chocolate to the crust. Next time I will add sugar and butter as one typically does to a crust, but I will serve it again. This is a winner.

I substituted sour cream for the creme fraiche, and that may have been my problem. It didn't really set. But the taste was great. Not too lemony and very refreshing. I really liked the crust.

Several things that have previously been mentioned as flaws to this recipe were easily corrected. I did not add chocolate to the crust. Instead, used the wafers, small amt sugar and 4 T butter, mixed and pressed into pie plate. For the filling, to counter the negative feedback of not setting up, I incorporated about a 1/3 cup of gelatin mixture that had been mixed with hot water and allowed to dissolve and cool. (1 cup hot water w/one package of gelatin, mix and then use 1/3 cup of cooled syrup, add to creme fraiche and condensed milk and raspberries. I omitted the lemon and added raspberry liquor. I am always disgusted with people who do not make the recipe as written for the most part, but wanted people to get an idea of how to correct this recipe and have a beautiful dessert that looks and tastes great! (Add whipping cream to top just before serving and fresh raspberries. Enjoy

Easy, fast, tasty and perfect for berry season. Nevertheless i thought the filling was a bit heavy on the condensed milk (thus the 3 forks). Next time i will add more creme fraiche or fold in some whipped cream to lighten up just a bit. Also, it took my pie closer to 3 hours to firm up.

This is very similar to a pie my grand-mother and mother made. The only difference is they made it with a regular baked pie crust. The filling was the same except they used strawberries (they used the lemon juice, but no grated peel or cre'me fraiche in theirs). The lemon juice is what thickens the filling. (We never noticed a pronounced taste of lemon, so perhaps it is the peel that is giving it the strong taste of lemon.) The strawberry pie was then topped with fresh whipped cream and was such a treat in the summer time.

I did this last weekend for a First Day of Summer BBQ and it was amazing! The crust was not too sweet, the filling not too heavy - everyone raved! Even my mom who is anti-chocolate and raspberries loved it! Just the right amount of lemon to give it summery lift...so refreshing.

I thought the balance between the lemon and raspberry was actually quite nice, however the crust was impossible to cut and the pie did not firm up as well as I thought it would. Basically we all ended up with a plate full of chocolate crumble and custard, tasted delicious, but not really a pie.

Way too lemony as recipe is written. Next time I'll omit the lemon entirely and add some plain gelatin to set the filling. The crust is a bit thick, but I think the chocolate would work nicely with a purer raspberry flavor in the filling.

I did not like this recipe at all! I agree with the previous reviewer who found that the lemon and raspberry flavors were at odds. My filling also did not firm up well enough. I served it at a BBQ, and 5 minutes after hitting the dessert table it had begun to melt! What use is a cold pie if it cannot withstand a few moments outdoors at the pool? I agree that the crust itself was lovely. I will probably use it again with a different filling - key lime would be delicious in a chocolate crust.

Interestingly, I agree with most of what the below reviewer said, but I think this recipe was fantastic! First of all, it's very very easy to make. It is VERY lemony - moreso than Raspberry-y, but it's delicious. I thought the lemon + chocolate went together quite well. The crust is very hard, but TRULY delicious. I would use this crust for any no-bake pie filling, just don't expect to be able to use plastic cutlery or paper plates. If you cover the thing in raspberries (as you're directed) the raspberries, lemon, and chocolate all go very nicely together. I also made a third of this sauce recipe - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Raspberry-Sauce-12119 - and drizzled it over the cut slices. Perfect!

This recipe was very disappointing. The crust was stiff and hard to cut, and the filling was strong on lemon and light on raspberry. The chocolate and raspberry flavors did not meld, but rather it was like two separate desserts - a thick chocolate cookie with a light raspberry filling sitting on top.

This turned out great. I hesitantly subed sour cream for creme fraiche and it worked out great. also changed out raspberries for strawberries and a couple other changes but nothing that changed the concept of the recipe. Very nice and refreshing.
