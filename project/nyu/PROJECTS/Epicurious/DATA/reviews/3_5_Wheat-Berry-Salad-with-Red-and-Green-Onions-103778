This is great - I add currants, and I love the idea of adding avocado. I've also tried it with small cubed fresh tomato, but both avocado and tomato will reduce the shelf-life, which is considerable.

I added some ripe diced avocado. Delicious.

I don't know what went wrong for me. I suspect it was the green onions - they were fresh, but extremely nasty and bitter. I need to make this again to see. I'd even make it without the green onions, because the rest of the flavors seem to be in harmony.

This recipe has become a summer staple at our house. Even my -not so fond of salads-husband likes it.

A delicious side dish. Not the big "wow" of the menu, but an excellent salad/side.

This salad is absolutely delicious. I used only 4 tablespoons of a good extra virgin olive oil in the interest of lowering fat calories. This salad can be served room temperature or chilled.

This is a terrific salad. I think that the secret is to cut the vegetables to the same size as the wheat berries- tiny!

Very good and different summer salad. I served it with cold "grilled tequila-lime chicken" that was featured with it in the magazine. The only head-scratcher I had was wheat berries come in hard and soft...I ended up buying the soft and the recipe turned out fine. It also served up well as leftovers 2 days later. I'll definitely make it again, but will add 15 minutes more to the simmer time of the wheat berries. This recipe is an excellent for making a day or so before serving, just wait until the last minute to toss on the dressing.

One of the best, of course I am partial to wheat berries and will tr them any way I can. A delight for lunch or a light dinner. Thank you.

A keeper recipe! I added some chopped jicima to the salad for some extra crunch.

Treated everyone at work, it made a great lite dish for the summer. Very simple to make. May add a bit more vinegar next time, since I really enjoy the tang.
