Will make again, but add some onions/garlic. I halved the oil. Didn't want those veggies swimming and they did not get stuck to the pan. Only stirred once, midway through.

Made this dish with 3 med. white skinned potatoes (left the skin on) and one large yam. Threw in a half dozen smallish garlic cloves. Used dried ground sage, baked for time and temp specified and it came out great! Love the simplicity of the olive oil on vegetables. One thing I forgot though, was to make sure I cut the yam pieces slightly bigger than the potato pieces because they tend to cook faster and end up a bit more mushy. Lined with foil for quick clean up, tossed them around halfway through.

This turned out great! Rather than tossing in the oil, I sprayed the potatoes with olive oil from a mister...I feel like it would have been a bit greasy otherwise.

This recipe is so easy, pretty darn healthy and really yummy. We served it at a Thanksgiving dinner party, and everyone raved. I was sort of surprised it was a big hit, as there were other more traditional dishes (stuffing, creamed corn), but everyone had a second helping of this dish. Also, not hard to make and it is an easy dish to time when making a large meal because of its simplicity. Also, I did not change a thing (other than adding a little more salt). You could, however, all other veggies and it would be fine.

This is my 'go to' for a starch dish. I also add granny smith apples. Nice surprise.

EXCELLENT! There were no leftovers. I used two large sweet potatoes and two medium golden potatoes. Left the skin on one of the golden potatoes but peeled the others. Followed the directions except cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (1/2 inch cubes) and lessened the salt; I just sprinkled sea salt over it in the bowl and then again on the pan. It was bomb.

I made just half this recipe, leaving the skin on redskins. I used some lovely Hawaiian Pink Sea Salt instead of Kosher but made no other changes. There were no leftovers.

I tripled the recipe for family Thanksgiving and it was the only dish with no leftovers! Used two scant TBS of plain salt for the entire batch. Easy to make, and everybody loved it - what could be better.

I made this recipe with both types of potatoes, 1/2 tbsp of salt as per other reviewers, 1/4 of oil, and fresh sage. It was delicious! Loved the taste of sage on the potatoes, it gave it a more refined flavour. It was so good that I don't think I'd risk the recipe by trying it with dry sage. Great change from the usual rosemary and thyme I'm used to add to the roasted vegetables. This is a new favourite~

I used this recipe for a dinner party I was having. I used red potatoes but left the skins on, with the peeled sweet potatoes. I precut the potatoes and put them in a gallon ziplock bag along with the oil, salt and sage for a few hours so that I could prep them in advance. They were super easy and everyone enjoyed them! The leftovers were also great for hashbrowns the next morning!!

Made these last Christmas as an easy side to a prime rib roast...absolutely festive and delicious. The next day used the leftovers for home fries...they were even more amazing!

Solid and easy side dish. Very tasty, and did I mention easy.

A perfect way to mix up the ordinary sweet potato purée with brown sugar on top. I replaced the tan-skinned sweet potatoes with the traditional orange-fleshed ones and it worked out fine. Also, I cut the chunks a little bit smaller and the cooked a lot faster. In fact, I probably should've stirred them a bit more, but in any case, they got a nice brown crispiness to them. Will be making them again, as the only winter produce in this area is sweet potatoes.

Used only sweet potatoes, and dried sage. A family that really doesn't like sweet potatoes, loved! these. Hardest part is peeling the potatoes. I used 1 teaspoon kosher salt and it was perfect. Sage adds a little flavor, but I will be experimenting with other herbs in the future...thyme, rosemary, majoram....A keeper recipe.

Great recipe but do cut back salt. I sprinkled with salt and used the roasted potatoes to puree and add to a lentil soup. Was very good.

I do this often, sometimes mixing in carrots and various spices. Salt substitute, like Mortons Lite, will help. I will try doing this on the grill outdoors to add a bit of smoky flavor.

Very good and easy to throw together. I only used sweet potatoes when I made this. I used less salt because I am on a low sodium diet... also used dried sage and it worked out just fine. It's my husband's favorite way to eat sweet potatoes. Yum!!

Overall a good recipe that my family liked, but it's way too much salt. I didn't have fresh sage so I used a combination of dried sage and chopped fresh Italian parsley. That was good. When I make it again I would cut the salt at least in half.

This is a good everyday recipe for sweet potatoes, which I'm usually hard pressed to find a use for when we get them in our CSA box. The sage ended up as little frizzles in with the potatoes, and it didn't seem to add much to the taste of the potatoes. Still, the potatoes were good and went well with a roast chicken and greens.

Yum! This is a keeper. I've made it twice. My husband is not a great lover of sweet potatoes (hates the candied versions) but likes these. I want to try with the skins left on, which would make it even simpler.

Simple and delicious, really can't go wrong with this. Had pumpkin soup along with it, a nice taste of autumn.
