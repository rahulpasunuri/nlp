My wife loves this dish! This simple-and-tasty recipe can be further streamlined by using unsweetened coconut and then skipping Step 1 (coconut soaking and baking).

Made this exactly as the recipe stated. Both my husband and I loved it. Definately you need the fresh lime. We made it again for the kids and they we wowed. Served with couscous, green beens and a salad. This receipe is a keeper.

I really wanted to like this! Unfortunately, the coconut overwhelms the delicate flavor of the scallops so I can't recommend it. I'll stick with a simple seared scallop preparation because, really, it doesn't get any better than that, and perhaps experiment with dipping sauces.

We thought this was good. Instead of the lime we used some Sweet Red Chili dipping sauce (found in the Thai section at the grocery)

We thought this was delightful - I would cut back the coconut to just one cup, though, and a half pound of scallops is plenty for two. Don't skip the lime wedge. It's rich so a very simple accompaniment will do - we had broccolini with toasted sesame seeds and plain basmati rice.

Honestly, this is one of the worst combinations I have had. I have had coconut prawns before and found them to be quite good. Scallops are too rich to be complimented by the coconut - will definitely try something else next time.

I thought this tasted terrible. Maybe i made it wrong but i don't think so...

Excellent dish. Quick and easy to prepare. These were nice hot but I preferred to eat them cold. Made them, refrigerated the majority and ate them cold over a couple of days. I would recommend increasing the spice if you like spicy food. The lime didn't add anything to this dish for me. A number of sauces would seem to compliment this dish better. Enjoy.

This was remarkable simple to make and FAST! My husband loved it and so did one of my kids-I did make a batch with fewer spices for them.

Served this dish as an appetizer for a dinner party and it went over well. The key is having fresh scallops.

Much better with shrimp. I use a raspberry chipolte sauce for 'dipping' serve with a salad of mixed greens, hearts of palm, black olives and radishes with an avocado dressing.

I substituted the sweetened flaked coconut with coconut milk and teaspoon of raw honey. Came out funderful. It's a keeper!!!

This is a very good dinner for an icy New England winter. The coconut adds great flavor and texture. It's helpful to have a solid technique for coating and frying.
