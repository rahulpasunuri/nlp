Looks like I'm the spoiler here for enthusiastic reviews. Tried the dumplings the first time. Love all things cornmeal and so like masa harina. But the dumplings sort of dissovled into the broth adn were a gummy mess. (And I have a fair amount of dumpling,,making experience in past life ;-) ) Time two made without dumplings but sauce was too thin without them - the bleeding masa harina acts as thickener. So used a little buerre manie at final stage to thicken up to the right consistency. Good flavors in sauce. But you will DEFINITELY want to make this a day ahead to be able to remove fat, as we did. Even with well trimmed lamb shoulder, the dish has a lot of fat. Making a day ahead and letting the fat solidify to remove it is esssential. A good enough recipe but with so many recipes and so little time, this did not make the "keeper" file. PS - Served this with cornmeal biscuits instead of the dumplings.

Fantastic! One of the best recipes I have ever made! Few changes - I bought veal shoulder instead of lamb by accident. Also I toned the spiciness down to suit my palette and used fresh peppers from the market: halved and roasted 3 sweet cubanelle peppers and one hot banana pepper. Then made the puree, seeds and all. As recommended below, I cooked with bacon fat. Deglazed the pan with wine. Be warned - it takes a long time to make this. Next time I am going to try doubling the recipe.

So delicious. One of the better chili recipes I've used. The lard is a must, especially in the dumplings (which, by the way, are fantastic themselves). You can swap in pork shoulder for the lamb easily, which I have done.

I LOVE spicy food, but people should know that New Mexico chilies can be quite hot. The recipe calls for "mild" chilies, but you never know what you'll get. The chipotle chilies are also very spicy, so unless you (and potential guests) like it hot, skip this recipe. One potential compromise is to remove the seeds before soaking, etc.

One of the nicest lamb recipes I have made. Loved by the whole family.

Fabulous! This is my no-fail, go-to, crowd pleaser. Great with lamb shoulder or pork shoulder. Spice can be adjusted from very mild to nuclear. I short-cut the pepper cooking step by putting the water and chilis in a Pyrex pitcher in the microwave for 8-10 minutes. Don't skip the dumplings: they are culinary marvels all on their own. Like another reviewer, I use bacon grease instead of lard, because that's what I have on hand (Mama rasied me right :-)).

This was fabulous, beans or not. I'm a big fan of anything involving cornmeal anyway, but never really liked lamb. This dish easily won me over. Outstanding.

To the Texas cook...Yes we all mostly love your beanless bowl of red, but we also like the evolution of food and taste. Like Duke Ellington once said about about music, to paraphras, If it sounds good, it is good, the same is true about food, If it tastes good, it is good.

This is a wonderful chili...all about the flavor of the peppers and made rich and substantial by the lamb and corn dumplings. No one will ever even notice that there are no beans to muck it up. Simple and very tasty.

I am in the process of making this for the second time in 2 weeks. Not sure how many servings it makes; but it only feeds 6 people. I substituted bacon grease (the god of frying fats if olive oil is the goddess) for lard. It only takes a tablespoon full. My grocery store never has much lamb and most of it is $13/lb chops. Using blade and shoulder chops, deboning but including the bones in the cooking process, works very well. Another money saver:up to 1/3 of the lamb can be ground lamb "blobs"(no need to roll little balls). Make it at least a day ahead so you can remove the fat and bones before reheating and finishing. Call this anything you wish but everyone wants the recipe.

to Vancouver, I'm from Texas and we think beans in chili is a travesty.

Stange, a chili recipe with no beans. Shouldn't it be called a stew then?
