This soup is amazing! We eat it over wild rice. It sounds strange but it really works with the rice imparting a lovely earthy flavor that complements the mushrooms beautifully. I don't care for viscous soups so I only use 1/2 tsp of corn starch. I ALWAYS wish I had doubled or tripled this recipe - just can't get enough!

Followed the recipe exactly except I wasn't convinced it would be spicy enough so I added 6 dried chiles to the mix. It would have been the right amount for stir fry, but in a soup all of the spicy works its way out of the pepper and it was a bit too much. Next time I will use 2 or 3. You can find all of this stuff at an asian grocery if you are patient. Any decent asian market will have a whole aisle of dried veggies. And you will spend A LOT less for these things at the asian market than in the international foods section at Wegmans. Dried Black Mushrooms are just shiitakes. They are not particularly black. You could certainly use fresh shiitakes instead, the texture and flavor are just a bit different. "Tree Ear" mushrooms are the same as "Wood Ear" mushrooms or "Black Fungus". They rehydrate to those big dark flat strips you're familiar with in H&S soup that you might have thought was seaweed. Yeah it's kinda confusing. I had to stare a while before I was able to find the correct mushrooms packaged small enough that my pantry wouldn't end up looking like I was prepping for Woodstock. The lily buds should be near the mushrooms. Good luck!

This is a definite keeper to make again and again. I used dense homemade chicken stock which added to the complexity. I think I will try some shiitake mushrooms next time and cut back on some of the bamboo shoots. The tip of soaking the bamboo shoots is great to reduce bitterness! This is better than any hot and sour soup I've had since the seventies in St. Louis.

Fantastic. I used dried shitakes and the lily buds and chopped them up in the food processor. I also chopped the bamboo shoots this way. Perfect recipe and very well received. I added a just a bit more white pepper and a bit more broth, but otherwise, kept it the same.

Fantastic flavor. Though it's not traditional, I added vegetables (bok choi, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower) to make this soup a main course,

I've been searching the west coast for good hot and sour soup, the kind that's almost ubiquitous in NYC. Luckily, I can abandon the frustrating (and fruitless) hunt because I now have THE recipe. Although it took me a couple of tries to find the dried lily buds, I succeeded yesterday and hurried home to make the soup. Oh. My. God. This is *it*! I added a bit more white pepper than the 1-1/2 tsp, but other than that, made it exactly as written. Really, really a great recipe.

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is really excellent and quite simple to make despite the long ingredient list. I made this recipe exactly as directed with no substitutions. However, I found that the amount of tree ear mushrooms was WAY too much, I ended up having to add extra broth at the end because there wasn't enough. Also, the dried lily buds that I have are probably not the sort meant for this recipe, but I don't know enough about lily buds to know what I should have used instead.

Rating: 4
I lacked the lily buds and subbed trader joe's red argentinian shrimp for the pork, but otherwise did this just as written. Okay, I added a quarter cup of balsalmic vinegar and another quarter cup of fish sauce, but that's it, I swear. This was without a doubt the most delicious soup base I've ever had. Put shoes in it and it would taste awesome. Do yourself and your family a big favor and make this soup. Make a double recipe. Triple. I had to have my wife tie me down so I wouldn't go back for a third bowl!!

This is by far the best hot and sour soup you'll ever taste. I've made it as directed for the past five years. Each time I receive accolades. Most of the "exotic" ingredients can be found in any Chinese market. I found and do use the dried lilly buds and the Bridges soy sauce. It does make a difference in the flavor of the broth. This is nothing like the gloppy mess that can be had at some "Chinese" restaurants. Lots of prep work, but it comes together very nicely.

Great recipe. Made vegetarian and it was delicious. Can control the heat by controlling the white pepper. Only had ground on hand so used 3/4 tsp. and it had just the right heat without being inedible. Definitely a make-again.

What can I say - absolutely delicious! Will make this again and again and again. Pretty much followed the recipe. Added extra red-wine vinegar to give the sour it needed and used only black mushrooms because I couldn't find the tree ear. This was not a problem - tasted great.

My love for Hot & Sour soup has driven me to try several recipes none of them even resembled the real thing. This one is it. Perfect. Just one thing any restaurant versions have tried have been very spicy hot. This recipe does not call for any spices (or I have missed something). I added sweet chili oil and this was just like any I had tried. This one will be made over and overy again.

This is better than most restaurants hot and sour soups very close to my favorite First Hunan Chef Wong in Pleasanton. Followed the directions exactly except I used wood ear fresh mushrooms, dried lily flowers and I could not find the dried black mushrooms so I used dried black fungus. Could be the same ingredients with different names. Realy good.

This was fabulous. I pretty much followed it exactly except I had to omit the lily buds due to not being able to find them. I went to an Asian market - but in all honesty I don't think they really knew what I was looking for. Maybe if I found an Asian name for them??? Anyway it turned out delicious. I did use homemade chicken broth which had NO salt added - and the soup was plenty salty enough without adding any extra. Now that I have all the ingedients this will be a cinch to make again.

I haven't read all reviews, nor have i finished the soup, but I'm wondering if there is a point in the cooking that could happen and then sit for a period, reheating and finishing with the egg, seasoning, and final touches.

I was debating between this recipe and another one featured in the Food Network website and went with this one after reading everyone's review and the big blue ribbon on top. Absolutely outstanding! Because of some dietary restrictions and less access to some of the Chinese ingredients, I needed to alter the recipe a bit.I replaced the pork loin with chicken breast, used all soy sauce ingredients in dark, used enoki mushroom (no access to ear or black mushrooms), and ran out of peanut oil replaced it with olive oil. I don't have a wok that is big enough, so used my cast-iron soup pot instead and worked wonderfully fine. I found that altering this recipe, too, only involved one soaking time for the lily buds. This had cut down the cooking time considerably to only 30 minutes. Will absolutely make this again! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Made this recipe for a soup get-together and everyone absolutely loved it. It is delicious. I made it exactly like the recipe described except for the cilantro since I knew one person attending did not like it. Next time will omit the pork and just add more mushrooms and tofu for I am not much of a meat eater.

I've now made this recipe twice in a VEGETARIAN version, and love the results. No pork; low-salt vegetable stock (Better than Boullion), twice as much tofu. I added 1 T grated ginger to the mushroom saute. Also added seaweed (kombu) in the same amount as the lily buds. The soup can stand additional hot flavor, which could be chili oil, Szechuan pepper, or red chili.

I tripled this recipe for our New Year's Eve party - 22 people. Everyone made one Chinese dish. This soup got the most raves from the guests. It was delicious. I was able to get all the incredients from a local Asian store. I did stop about three Asian shoppers to make sure I was buying the right ingredients. A lot of work but very much worth it.

Rating: 4
I made this as closely as I could to the recipe, though couldn't find wood ear mushrooms or lily buds at our biggest Asian market (like 2000 sq ft.). It tasted just great, and better than I've had in restaurants with all the fresh ingredients. After adding the cornstarch, it didn't thicken as much as I've had in restaurants, but that was OK with me. I was dubious that the small amounts of vinegar would make it sour enough, or that the white pepper would make it hot enough, but it came out pretty similarly to what I've had in restaurants in both respects. There is a fair amount of prep, but it comes together pretty quickly in the wok. I'd definitely make this again.

This is good. We didn't have the dried mushrooms, but fresh mushrooms substituted well. Next time I would use chili oil to make it 'hot' instead of white pepper. I also added some garlic chili paste to make it spicy, and it was delish!

I'd had good hot and soup soup before, but never anything as complexly flavored or unexpectedly fresh-tasting (hell, most of the ingredients are from a can or a bag) as this. First, my modifications: I substituted balsamic for the red wine vinegar, I used Japanese soy sauce in place of the Chinese light, and I used more than a cup of the mushroom soaking liquid since I wanted more broth and it seemed a shame to waste. I was unclear as to whether the listed black mushroom quantity referred to whole mushrooms or slices; since my dried shiitakes are large and sliced, I used about 15 pieces. (I might use more next time.) And finally, since I have no wok, I cooked in a Dutch oven. Otherwise, I followed the recipe precisely, and the resulting soup was delicate, many-textured and delicious -- although not that hot or sour. I will definitely make it again, perhaps using fresh crimini mushrooms instead of pork (even though it was great); I'll definitely keep the bamboo shoots, tofu and egg. And don't skip the cilantro! It adds way more than you'd expect to the character of the soup, as does the white pepper.

Rating: 4
I can't believe how authentic and easy this was, even with all the modifications I made. I used what I had on hand, which ended up making it vegetarian: dried shiitakes and no pork, but fresh white button mushrooms instead; veg broth instead of chicken. The rest I made as is, but had no green onion and cilantro for garnish. It wasn't quite as hot or sour as I'd like but those are very easily adjusted, as others have mentioned. I will absolutely make this again.

This is the closest Hot Sour Soup recipe to perfect I have found. You may have a hard time finding some of the ingredients unless you have a chinese or international market close by. I make no changes and instead offer chili paste to the family if they want it hotter. It is easy for them to add a dash of salt, vinegar or sesame oil to taste. I did try chicken once instead of pork and would not do it again. Can't beat the pork. I also tried seafood and again the pork is better. The white pepper is a must but don't put it on the table unless you know how hot this stuff is. This might be my very favorite recipe on this site. Thanks a lot!

I finally found a recipe that tastes similar to my favorite chinese restaurant's version of hot-and-sour soup! What I did different: I omitted the dark soy sauce and lily buds (couldn't find these), and I didn't use cilantro or mushrooms (I'm not a fan of them). After adding the rice vinegar and red-wine vinegar, I thought the soup tasted a bit bland - so I added 2-3 tablespoons of regular white vinegar (and the level of "sourness" was perfect). Next time I make this, I think I'll use more cornstarch (perhaps 1 tablespoon extra) to thicken the soup a bit more. Also, I think I'll just use 1 egg.

A recipe that truly needs no modification. I could not find lily buds so I added a few crunchy bean sprouts just for texture. Make double the recipe and freeze some because people are going to want more! Recipe also work fine if you want to do a seafood version and use shrimp/prawns

I actually made this with veg seitan instead of pork, enoki and shitake mushrooms and it was delicious! It wasn't glutinous like the type you get in restaurants and the flavours were light and tongue tingling. Definitely double the vinegar mixture.

I *love* hot and sour soup and this one did not disappoint. I use dried shiitakes and black fungus, the lily buds are essential for us, they are so aromatic and delicious. I cooked the pork and vegetables in the wok using sesame oil not peanut oil. When it was time to add the broth, I transferred everything to a large pot because the wok wasn't big enough to handle all the vegetables and broth. As others have mentioned, I skipped the cilantro. I used a mixture of red wine and rice vinegars and doubled the amount. I doubled the white pepper as well. At the very end I added shredded carrot, simmered for only a minute or so. Excellent. Everyone loved it except for my ultra-picky mac-n-cheese and hotdog-loving 11-year old, but even he tried it and said it wasn't too terrible, a small miracle in itself. This is a keeper.

Delicious. I have been eating hot and sour soup a lot lately at various Chinese restaurants, liking it so much that I wanted to be able to eat it at home. This is a little different that what I have been eating, but it is great. The only downsides are the difficulty finding the ingredients and the fact that my wife won't eat it.

Amazing. Brough the Pearl River Soy Sauce home in my luggage from NYC to Missouri along with the dried mushrooms! Didn't have the lilly buds. Skipped the cilantro (not in this soup!). Otherwise made it as directed. Have all your ingredients soaked, set up and ready and this goes together quickly! Also the flavor was better letting this sit overnight and ate the next day. Marvelous!! A real nice SOUP not a gelatinous glob like you get at some Chinese places.

This is a great recipe! We live in asia but we missed good ole American Hot & Sour soup. I substituted chinese black vinegar for the red wine and rice vinegars, and added a few more splashes of it since we like it extra sour. We also added thai chili paste and vietnamese chili sauce for added heat. Served it over fresh noodles and blanched bean sprouts and added freshly chopped scallions and cilantro for some extra flavor and garnish. Delicious!

Very good. I made it vegetarian by leaving out the pork. I also didn't feel like hunting down the ingredients so I simplified it. Used 4 oz fresh shitake and 10 oz of chopped portabello. I sauteed the mushrooms with 3 cloves of minced garlic and the bamboo shoots. Added about 6 cups of broth bc I used the whole package of tofu. Followed the rest of the recipe as is except that I added about 6 tbls of rice vinegar since I had more broth (didn't bother to use red wine vinegar and I thought it would be better to keep it all Asian). I kept the soy sauce and sesame oil amount the same as the recipe.

This was very good the 2nd time I made it WITHOUT the cilantro. Cilantro is not authentic to this dish, and frankly it was just the wrong taste. My dinner guest was Chinese, and I noticed when I was doing dishes that she had picked the cilantro out and put it on the plate that was under the soup bowl. I had tried it because I thought the limey- ness of the cilantro might contribute well to the sour ingredients. Cilantro has been overused, both in quantities and indiscriminate additions to dishes it isn't called for, and this is definitely an example of that trend. I found the red wine & rice vinegars fine substitutes for black vinegar, which I didn't have on hand.

This recipe is phenomenal and always a hit. I have had so many people ask for the recipe. It is also sooo easy. Because we like stronger flavors, I have been known to increase the red wine vinegar-rice vinegar-soy sauce combination and add a considerable amount of white pepper which has much more of a kick than I ever imagined (the first time I made it). If you don't have the inclination to soak the black mushrooms, you can cut corners by simply sauteeing sliced shitake mushrooms, but then you miss out on the additional flavor of the mushroom water that is used with the corn starch. One time, in lieu of the pork, I used shrimp ... because that's what I had on hand ... it was very nice.

This is fairly authentic and delicious. I live and work in Chinatown East. There are many things that can be substituted if you are in an area that does not carry many of the ingredients. Dark soy for soy. Dried mushrooms for baby bella. Lily buds not necessary. White pepper for 1/2 (or more) tsp Red pepper flake. Sesame oil for 1/2-1 tbsp sesame seed lightly browned. All can be cooked in a pan, preferrably Teflon, WOK not necessary. Go easy w/ corn starch excess, soup should be liquid, not gelatinous. Enjoy

It is very rare for my husband to make comments on the many recipes I have tried from this site, but, he really voiced his opinion on this recipe, he loved it!!! He said that this was a keeper. I made some slight changes, per some of the other reviews, used the Chinese black vinegar with the rice vinegar (included the amount of the rice vinegar to make a little more sour), added some chile paste, didn't use the pork (added more tofu) and used shitake mushrooms (that was all I had on hand). I will make this dish again.

Great, but I prefer to add the cornstarch to the pork and as long as you're shopping for exotic ingredients, I recommend using Chinese black vinegar instead of the the other two vinegars in the recipe. The lilly buds are a great, authentic touch that I find only in the best Chinese restaurants (or when I cook at home :-)

This is a wonderful soup: and I was fortunate to find all the ingredients at my local Chinese-owned market. When I mentioned I was making Hot and Sour Soup, Asian store clerks and Asian customers alike rushed to help me choose just the right ingredients. It was a real community effort, and with help like that; authentic! I learned a lot. This is one of the best soups I have ever made or eaten...I wonder if I should offer my help to the local Chinese restaurants? This recipe is right up there with my favorite Chinese places dishes! Thank you.

We have made this a few times. We like it a little more sour (4Tbsp Rice vinegar and 3Tbsp Red Wine vinegar) and a little more spicey (add 1tsp red chili flakes). Also, because of availability, we use only shiitakes and a few regular mushrooms to make it go a little further.

This recipe turned out great. However, I did not have time to find the Lily bulbs before cooking the soup. I also added some rehydrated shitaki because I love them and tgey just added a great flavor. I also cut the white pepper by half ... and it was still good, just not too spicy.

Wow! This was so incredible. It was difficult to find the ingredients, and somewhat of a pain, but well worth it. Plus, I think the second time around will be much easier. I had a very difficult time finding the dried lily buds, which a friend finally found for me at a philipino market under the name lily flower. I used CHICKEN sliced very thin and it was great (indistinguishable from pork). Have fun and enjoy!

This soup was incredible. Better than most restaurant versions, and I live in a Chinese food mecca, so that's saying something.

I love this soup! It's a little work, and needs the right ingredients to be authentic, but it's a winner. I assumed that dried black mushrooms were dried shitakes, which I used.
