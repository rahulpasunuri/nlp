I substituted chopped walnuts for the other nuts and otherwise followed the directions explicitly -- won't make it again. It's impossible to "stuff" the celery, or to use a celery stick because there's nothing to hold it together. I was asked what was in it, but I'm afraid it wasn't because my guests liked it -- it's a strange combination. Perhaps a couple of days in the fridge would help? Doubt it.

If you like blue cheese, this is a keeper. The sweet and salty tastes blend together perfectly with the spices. I serve it in endive leaves which makes a very pretty presentation. I have made this many times and it is my most frequently asked for recipe.

I used this to stuf veggies. It's not very spicy and too strong for me - a little goes a long way
