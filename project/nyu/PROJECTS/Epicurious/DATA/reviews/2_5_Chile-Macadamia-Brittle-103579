I had really high hopes for this recipe, but I felt slightly let down. I did use the modifications suggested by the user from Seattle, and I'd suggest that anyone attempting this recipie do the same, with one exception; don't double the pepper flakes! I did and mine turned out so spicy that no one wanted a second piece, even though I'd brought it to a Mexican Fiesta.

Slightly time consuming. Be patient....it is tasty and adds a wonderful flair to a dessert.

The recipe had problems, but I have made many brittles and could see that it called for too much H20 or not enough sugar. I doubled the sugar and added 1/2 C of corn syrup. The syrup got to hard-crack stage in about 25 minutes, I added the nuts & chile (also doubled) and it turned out great. Nice clear, pale gold brittle. Don't let the nuts stay in the syrup too long; mine started to brown. It is really a great unique taste.

Like the cook in Minnetonka, my brittle foamed up when I added the nuts, then looked foamy and ugly when it cooled. I don't know what I did wrong, but am not going to try this recipe again. Macadamia nuts are too good to be wasted.

I made this with Pecans instead of Macadamia nuts and it was very good. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of crushed chiles, and it was the perfect spiciness.

I don't know what I did wrong (twice) but this was a disaster both times. I'm guessing it was because I used dry roasted macadamia nuts. When I poured them into the brittle it foamed up just like I'd dumped baking soda in peanut brittle. The whole mess ended up looking like..never mind.

Man, this is good! I have always been a fan of the sweet-hot spicy combination of flavors, and this is it! Make sure you cook the caramel long enough (before addding the nuts), that it will solidify as it cools. I didn't, and so just stuck the baking sheet with brittle on it in the oven at 400 degrees F. until it started bubbling, pulled it out, rearranged the nuts evenly and let it cool. THEN it was brittle. Great with banana sorbet and dark rum caramel sauce (these recipes also in the Epicurious files). Would make a fantastic Christmas gift, in a little jar or box, for a spicy foods fan.
