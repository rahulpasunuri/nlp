I read all the reviews, but still didn't fully appreciate the amount of time it takes to do all the steps. The results were very good, although I would make some modifications the next time I make it. First, I'm not sure the lentils added a whole lot to the taste, so if I was pressed for ingredients or time, I wouldn't necessarily bother with them. Second, it says to strain the sauce and I will try it without straining out the onions and omit the pearl onions instead. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added the porcini's (diced) to the roasted vegetables and it was excellent. Luckily my husband does the clean-up after I cook, so it was his job to clean up the many pots and pans that this dish left behind...

I was going to add 2 acorn squash, cubed, but at the last minute, mixed the squash in with the potatoes (TBS butter, 1/4 c. milk, 2 TBS thyme) for the topping. I used 1/2 the potatoes to account for the squash. Tasty! The squash was light yellow when cooked, so it makes the topping look golden without having to dot it with butter.

This recipe is not rated as highly as it should be. First of all, it does not have to be as labor intensive as some reviewers have claimed. The sauce simmers for a while but does not demand constant attention, and the other steps are simple and none too time-consuming. I roasted and mashed my potatoes and simmered my lentils the day before- this demanded approximately 20 minutes of hands-on work. Everything else came together quickly, and start to finish on the day of serving I had dinner in less than two hours and for several days. I subbed sweet for yukon gold potatoes and thought it worked beautifully. I also did not add as much broth as called for, and instead pureed the solids and added a few tablespoons to thicken the broth. This not only saved time but actually added more flavour. Overall an excellent recipe and combination of flavors with a few adjustments that I will be making again.

Best vegetable shepherd's pie I've ever made. It does take a lot of prep time, but if you do it all the day before, it comes together easily. I will definitely make this again.

That much work should get a pop but it doesn't. It's very ordinary. Lentils du puy are very nutty and hold their shape. Wouldn't substitute. Used about a cup of dried wild mushrooms for the mushroom reduction. Very tasty. What's to gain from 2 kinds of potatoes and how was it improved by ricing them? Good thing I have a lot of pots and a skivy at my house.

I halved the recipe to feed four with two servings left over. It was a lot of work, but I was very happy with the results. It was quite good and very satisfying. Made the recipe as written, preparing it in stages over two days. Much tastier than other veggie shepherd's pies I have tried previously.

This recipe is ridiculous. It makes way more than the baking dish could hold. The preparation time was days. It was good, but not good enough to warrant the effort and the cost (of dried mushrooms).

10 servings per the magazine

This was very good but not great. Perhaps it is great for a vegetarian type meal. This took soooooo long and used soooooooo many pots, pans, bowls that I would not make again. It might be a labor of love for a vegetarian friend or family member but I won't go there again.

I agree with the Cook from Detroit. The directions are not organized. Read and re-read it. I would however, add more lentils, not omit. I am not a vegetarian, but made this for a friend out on leave. This made a 2 1/2 qt for her and a 1 1/2 qt for me. She froze half and we only ate only 1/2. Huge! My vegetarian friend was very pleased, and so it was worth the effort. If you have vegetarian guests or you are one, go for it. I would prep one day and finish the next.

How many servings? And I had a problem with ricing my potatoes after baking and some of them possibly overbaked. And I ended up with way more potatoes than would fit on top of the final product. Also how many servings is this claiming to be? And how do you shop for 12 cups chopped veggies. I am clearly not advanced enough for this recipe. I didn't mind the sound of a veggie Shepherd's Pie. It sounded really lovely but it has taken me 3 days after work in the kitchen to get to the final oven bake.

As a vegan I do usually refer to my "shepherd's pie" as gardener's pie. In this case I'd have to call it the mushroom hunter's pie. : ) To optimize time and make this dish less expensive and much less messy i do it as left-overs after i've made lentil loaf (meat loaf) and mashed potatoes using mushroom gravy. Double the amount of potatoes, and gravy you need for meatloaf and simply save the leftovers. I even make my gravy in the slow cooker while working or otherwise engaged. Serve with a side of roasted sliced carrots and save some of those for the pie as well. Makes a delicious left-over redux and saves loads of time. Now the only thing you need to do before you bake is make your lentils (I save extras from my lentil loaf...)which do not require pre-soaking and saute the onions, throw in a couple bags of mixed vegs. It only looks complicated, it's really easy and delish! Always part of my winter-meal rotation!

Strictly speaking shepherd's pie IS made from lamb or mutton. Traditionally it was made from the leftover roast from the shepherd's wife's kitchen and originated in the UK. And what do shepherds eat? Why, lamb or mutton, of course! A potato topped beef based pie is called cottage pie. I know of no name for a potato topped vegetable pie. I suggest gardener's pie!

to MCRumph any readers he/she has confused: shepard's pie refers to the topping of mashed potatoes, as opposed to a traditional savory pie (usually called a pot pie in the U.S.) that would be topped with a pie crust or a cobbler with biscuit topping or a crumble -- you will find vegetable forms of these traditionally meat pies at every pub in the U.K. (a much more veg-friendly part of the world), the veg shepard's pie a particular favorite because it is easily gluten-free as well (also a universal offering throughout the U.K.). The title "shepard" does not necessarily signify there is a sheep inside...

I would have given this recipe full stars in terms of flavour and end result, but the method instructions were very convoluted, not in an organized order, and I had to make a lot of changes there. This is definitely not a recipe you want to make when you need a quick weeknight meal, lol. But the results are soooooo worth it. In terms of changes, I would make the mashed potatoes and roast the veggies the day before, then do the sauce the next day and assemble and bake. The sauce is KEY to this recipe and has an amazing, smokey, meaty depth of flavour, surprising for a vegetarian recipe. One thing I could not bring myself to do was "discard the solids" after cooking down the sauce. I paid over $5 for the one ounce of dried porcini mushrooms and I realize the soaking liquid is the biggest key to the depth of flavour in the sauce, but still..I could not throw out those porcinis. So, instead of dirtying yet another pan and strainer (this recipe will trash your kitchen, let me tell you, lol), I used a slotted strainer-type spoon to remove the solids, then picked out the porcinis, diced them up and added them to the roasted veggie mixture. The only other thing that puzzles me about this recipe is the French lentils. I love lentils, in any way, shape, or form, but with all the texture and depth of flavour in this dish, they seemed sort of irrelevant, other than adding more fibre. I will make this recipe again, and try it without the lentils (one less step!). Cheers!

What I have a problem with isn't the ingredients, but the name. If it's a Shepherd's Pie, shouldn't it have, perforce, either lamb or mutton in it? Look at it this way: the difference between a martini and a gibson was that the former had olives and the latter cocktail onions. That was the only difference but they had two completely different names. Apparently people are no longer so creative, imaginative, inventive as they used to be.

How many servings does this prepare? I'd like to know for the Nutrition information that's given per serving, but no serving count.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious!! I am wondering if the review who indicated the porcinis added no flavor did not use the soaking liquid. I felt this added tremendous flavor. I did think it needed additional salt. I served it to a meat eater who did NOT believe there was no meat included. This recipe is a keeper!

Oh I also sauteed the mushrooms instead of tossing them in raw. It deepened the flavor.

I'm not going to rate because I didn't follow the recipe to a T. I only read the first reviewers comments and was really afraid if I followed the recipe it would be bland. It is a hugely time consuming recipe and makes TONS of leftovers so bland would have been a disaster. Ok so first I needed it to be vegan so I substituted coconut milk with some veg bouillon for the milk and butter. That was a great sub, delicious! Then instead of using dried porcini's I used in season foraged Ohio puffballs. I cooked the puffballs with the lentils which make them taste really meaty. I didn't use frozen pearl onions because I hate them and there was enough filling without it. I also didn't reduce the liquid in the sauce by half because I think there wouldn't have been enough for all of the veg. As it was it could have used more. Next time I'll double that. I also used about 4 Tbls of miso paste. I really wanted that umami flavor you get from a fall beef stew. I chopped the rosemary into the veg instead of just laying a spring in there and then fishing it out. that didn't make sense to me. I got more flavor out of having it mixed in. So in the end it took HOURS to make but if you have vegans coming and want to make something hearty and special I would give this one a try.

This was delicious-could be for a vegetarian main or side. Perfect for dinner with a slice of rye bread on chilly fall evenings or a dinner party (which is what I made it for). I added close to 1/2 cup of herbs- thyme, sage and parsley-and used both miso and tamari. It is quite time consuming, but I made all the components the day before as suggested in the recipe and all I had to do the next day was assemble and bake, so great when preparing for guests.

If you are not making a large casserole, this recipe can easily be halved to fit a regular casserole dish. Each section can be made in advance- together they make for a great comfort food (vegetarian or not!)

Awful and time consuming. Extremely bland. Porcini liquid does NOTHING to enhance the flavor. And meat lovers will in no way find this dish appetizing. I would like these 3 hours of my life back.
