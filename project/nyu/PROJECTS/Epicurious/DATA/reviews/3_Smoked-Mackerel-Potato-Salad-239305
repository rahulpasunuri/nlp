I am always looking for ways to use smoked mackerel, which I adore, and was tired of kedgeree and West African greens. I never eat traditional potato salad 'cuz I hate mayo and its gloppy white cousins, but this sounded clean, plus I had all the ingredients on hand (used a bag of miniature purple, red and yellow potatoes that didn't even need chopping). Talk about fast and flavorful!
