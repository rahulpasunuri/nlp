This cake is easy and delicious!...and beautiful. I doubled the spices and added clove and nutmeg. The frosting is not my favorite, but everything together tastes really great.

This cake is so delicious. The cake is moist and flavorful, and the frosting is rich and complements the cake perfectly. The molasses in the frosting adds a little bite that keeps the flavor from being overly sweet. This has been a real winner both times I've made it. It is definitely a keeper. My changes: The second time I made it, I added a little nutmeg and clove (just a sprinkle of each) to up the spice of the cake. I left out the raisins in the cake and the walnuts on the frosting. I don't care for those textures in cakes. A future idea is to sub a little pureed pumpkin for 1/2 the apple butter.

This cake was easy to make and DELICIOUS! Although apple butter is not found in New Zealand, as mentioned by a reviewer, there is a product called 'rinse appelstroop' by Timson which is a Dutch product and available in the imported goods section of most supermakets here. This is the make or break ingredient of this cake recipe and I understand that someone might rate the recipe as ordinary if the ingredient is substituted with mere apple sauce. My family is not big on raisins in baking, so this was omitted, but I don't believe the flavor suffered for the lack of it. Yum!

While this wasn't the most fabulous cake I'd ever made, it was still very good, especially considering how incredibly easy it was. I didn't feel like bothering to make a layer cake, so I just made a sheet cake - it was the perfect amount of batter for a 9 x 13 pan, just needed to bake it for 30 minutes total. I doubled the spices and added some ground cloves as well. And apple butter doesn't exist in New Zealand, so I used ordinary applesauce, and it still came out perfect. I don't like cream cheese frostings so I just made an ordinary buttercream with the molasses, and since it was a sheet cake I only needed about 1/3 of the frosting recipe given. All in all a very very easy and delicious cake, which I would definitely make again. Not a special cake for guests, but perfect for having around the house for an everyday dessert or snack.

I made this for Thanksgiving, skipped the raisins, and used an excellent penuche icing recipe instead of the one supplied, and WOW! I keep thinking about making it again just out of pure greed. This makes a very moist and springy in texture spice cake, a real winner of a cake recipe. And it was just as fantastic for four or so days I carved away at the leftovers of it in the fridge.

I've made this cake several times. It's very easy and has come out perfect each time. I never seem to have apple butter, so I've used chutney instead. Yummy with a little bite. I don't like it sweet so the chutney works out great. I also make regular cream cheese frosting with only 1/2 the sugar called for. Always a hit!

Wonderful, moist cake. Would use less than half the sugar called for, though, since the apple butter added quite a bit of sugar already. I made these into cupcakes and did not frost them. Delicious!

I decided that this cake can stand alone without frosting and Caramel. I, for one, don't want the extra calories that come with a pound and half of cream cheese. So I baked it in a buttered tube pan for 55 minutes at 350 degrees, then TURNED THE OVEN OFF and let it set for an additional 15 minutes. Or simply add additional cooking time @ 350 degrees. I substituted cranberries soaked in apple rum for the raisins, then mixed the rum with 2+ Tbls. of butter and sugar and heated the mixture in the microwave. After removing the cake and while still warm, I brushed the glaze onto the cake with a pastry brush. Guests loved it. They all thought it would have been over-kill to add frosting to such a delicious cake. As this cake gets better with age, I would also recommend making this cake a day ahead so it has even more time to mellow.

Oh my. I made this for a gathering of my Arabian Horse Club and they couldn't get enough of it. Quite rich, moist and tasty. I did a couple things differently -- I used butter instead of oil, upped the spices a bit and used a little bit more molasses in the cake than the recipe called for. With the toasted walnuts on the side and the caramel drizzled on the top, it was as beautiful as it was rich and tasty.

This cake is still cooling on my table so I can't actually say how good it is - but the batter was delicious and so is the frosting, so it must be good! I just had to write in my modifications: one reviewer said that it wasn't very spicy, and I LOVE spice, so I added a little extra of both the cinnamon and the allspice. When I went to make the caramel sauce it turned out completely dry! It didn't even closely resemble caramel sauce.... upon looking up some other recipes I decided that it needed more cream, so I added another dose, heated it up and perfecto! It's beautiful :)

I made these for a birthday party and they were really yummy and disappeared quickly! Moist and delicious version of spice cake that was delicious as cupcakes. Only used half the frosting.

I've made this twice - for my roommates and for my cousins for Xmas. Both times the cake was really fast to make, and I would say that while mild and not the most exotic cake, it's still quite good. The first time I added a layer of mandarin oranges in between two (of four - I split each layer) layers, and added orange oil to the frosting. The second time I added orange zest to the frosting and that seemed to do just as well.

This is a wonderful, easy cake. I added 1/4 sour cream to the cake and substituted real maple syrup for the molasses. It was extremely moist - people were helping themselves to seconds-thirds and fourths!! I substituted the frosting for the "Orange Cream Cheese Frosting" on this site.

This recipe is awesome. First of all, this was one of the easiest, fastest cakes I've made in a long time. Second of all, the presentation is lovely- the caramel sauce drizzled on top of the frosting is a beautiful effect. Thirdly, and most importantly, the taste did not disapoint and the texture was perfect. I followed the recipe except that I made a different caramel recipe, and I halved the frosting. Probably 2/3 of the frosting recipe would be the ideal amount.

I love the cake. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. I couldn't find any apple butter so i used regular butter and it still tasted wonderful. I was itching to make a cake with molasses and i found a great recipe. thanks

I've made this cake a number of times, and each time it gets rave reviews. Great recipe. Great holiday cake.

I was very enthusiastic about making this because I adore spice cake. It turned out absolutely terrible. I must admit, however, that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I thought that 3 packages of cream cheese seemed excessive for the icing, so I cut it back to 1, leaving all the other proportions the same. Even with just 1 package, it was disgustingly rich. The caramel sauce was gritty, and the spice cake itself was just not what I was expecting (it wasn't very spicy). It is with great disappointment that I am throwing the remaining 3/4 of the cake into the garbage...

This worked out well for my husband's birthday party. He had been asking for Spice Cake for awhile, his mother used to make it for him when he was a kid. This recipe worked out fabulous. It was easy to make, and everyone loved it. I felt like a gourmet cook!

I made this for my daughter's second birthday party and it was a big hit. Served with homemade brown sugar ice cream, the combination was irresistible. A perfect cake for a chilly day.

Absolutely wonderful. I would probably add a little less molasses to the frosting next time, ad I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, they were a little too sweet. I'd stick to the raisins.

I liked this cake a lot. I served it with a caramel icing which was terrific. It makes a wonderful fall dessert and I would definitely make it again.

I just made this cake for a Halloween party, and it was a fabulous hit! I tinted the frosting a pale orange and made a Jack-O'-Lantern face out of a cut-up Hershey bar and some green sugar. The cake is moist, spicy, very luscious, and really is perfect for autumn.

Wonderful cake, I have made it several times and it is always a welcome addition to a potluck, or a birthday party.
