Love that the eggplant is baked - not fried: Healthier and much neater for clean-up. I did sweat the eggplant for about 30 minutes. Made the recipe a day ahead of time - then added the sauce and parmesan cheese when I was ready to bake for serving........it was a homerun! Also during the eggplant slice coating and baking process I made double the amount of slices and then froze some of the breaded baked slice for another day. Especially nice since they thawed out so quickly when I decided to use them.

By the way... A few reviewers have mentioned frying the eggplant slices, and I must say, I think the baking is an essential part of this recipe. I am not one to shy away from upping the ante on a dish for the sake of flavor (my husband is a professional chef and butter and cream are two of my favorite words). However, the baking dries out the eggplant in a way that frying in oil would not. What I usually dislike about eggplant is the soft, soggy texture, and there is none of that when you bake the slices as directed. As an added bonus, it's a healthier dish (though, with all the cheese I'm not sure that is anyone's first concern). Incidentally ,I also subbed Panko for the fresh bread crumbs with no issue, and reserved a little of the shredded mozzarella to top the dish along with the grated Parmesan (always freshly grated Parmesiano Reggiano).

Neither my husband nor I are huge fans of eggplant, but we had one that came in our food co-op basket and decided to try this recipe. It is delicious! We took the extra step of salting and drying out the eggplant slices on paper towels before breading. With all the steps, the eggplant dries out and cooks up in such a way that you could almost think it was pasta. I always have homemade marinara in my freezer so we used that as opposed to jarred. We only had one eggplant so we halved the recipe, but it still made quite a bit more rolls than the two of us needed, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and individually wrapped half of them in plastic (after rolling but before topping & baking) and stored them in the freezer in a freezer bag. A few weeks later they made a great and fast weeknight meal. I just popped them into a dish - this time with a homemade meat sauce from my freezer - topped with shredded mozzarella and baked in the toaster oven until brown and bubbly. Just as good the second time around! This is a keeper!

I made this dish for my family last night and was surprised by haw simple it was. Between the three of us I was able to make enough for us and save the leftovers for 3 more servings in the refrigerator to bake at a later date. It's great severed over capellini. It is also really simple to modify the filling so you can add veggies or anything else that goes well with eggplant.

Love this recipe, but marinara sauce from a jar? Really? With 2 cloves of chopped garlic sauteed in olive oil, a can of San Marzano tomatoes & a splash of white wine, in about 5 minutes I had fresh sauce simmering away while I prepared everything else (use a small saute pan and it cooks even faster). Added fresh basil to sauce about 5 minutes before eggplant was ready to go in oven, and the sauce was perfect. Also halved Ricotta & made up difference with Marscapone. Used Ian's Italian Panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh, and added a nice flavor. Served with a small side of angel hair pasta and extra sauce. Yum.

This is a recipe that will take some time, but it is well worth it! I tend to have a heavy hand with the filling and the basil, so I've used more than the recipe stated I think. The fried eggplant in olive oil is one of the layers of flavor, so I can't recommend skipping it, but many have and like the outcome of it being dryer. I generally buy Italian Bread at the bakery and let it get stale for my breadcrumbs, but after reading the reviews, I might give some Italian Panko a try for a crispier lighter texture. This recipe is wonderful.

Pretty good, I tried to buy the "male" eggplant by looking at the bottom dimple (round supposedly = male, oval or a dash = female). Not sure if this is true or not but wanted one with fewer seeds. Both had seeds:( After baking them till golden brown, we had to use what we had in the house so, we smeared a mixture of mascarpone cheese, parmesean, parsley, basil, salt, pepper and a dash of garlic powder on top of it and topped it off with some jarred RAO's marinara. The crispiness of the eggplant, the creaminess of the mascarpone was so yummy! The one thing I don't like about eggplant parm is that it's so mushy. We sometimes make fried eggplant breaded the same way in this recipe, but I think I'm going to bake it from now on...LOVE THAT CRISPNESS:)

I made this recipe, except that I did not use fresh breadcrumbs. I used Progresso Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and added the dry cheese as per the recipe. I then used some tin foil lined baking sheets and baked the eggplant slices. I was concerned I might be sacrificing some flavor by not frying the slices, but they turned out fairly crispy and a little dried out. (which was good). I rolled the slices and baked as per the recipe. I used my own homemade sauce. Turned out great! The baking of the eggplant did not make the rolls soggy, as frying the slices has done in the past. The rolls were firm and everybody loved it. Will definitely make again. Not hard to make, but time consuming and makes quite a mess in the kitchen!

Awesome recipe. This was a lot of work, but well worth the effort. I failed with the fresh breadcrumbs (my food processer could not get them fine enough) so resorted to traditional but that was not a problem. I used lowfat mozz and ricotta with good results. The meal looked and tasted great. We are looking forward to the leftovers!

Fabulous. It's worth using fresh ingredients. We used Italian panko breadcrumbs which made it particularly crispy.

Pretty easy to make, although it takes a long time, but worth the effort. Tastes good as leftovers as well! Will make again for a special occasion as the labor intensive preparation time and the heavy calories do not seem worth an everyday meal.

I was thrilled that this dish not only tasted great the first and second nights (my cousin loved it, too) but it also froze and reheated beautifully, too. This is important when you live alone and want to be able cook in bulk to save money and time. I used part-skim ricotta and mozzarella, and it worked fine. I think next time I'll use less parm - it just seems unnecessarily heavy and salty, especially as added to the sauce on top and the amount added to the filling. I had some old bread that I had made but it wasn't enough so I had to supplement with an additional 1 cup of Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs; this worked fine. I loved that I didn't have to fry the eggplant! I'm not good at frying, and who needs extra fat? I was not sure that the fresh basil (expensive for me) would add much, but it really did make a difference. I think three cups of sauce (I used store-bought sweet basil marinara) is not quite enough; I would have liked a bit more.

I had to learn how to make this when my local italian restaurant took it off their menu! anyway -what I do is salt the eggplant slices a little, rinse it, then coat in an eggwash, dip in Progresso bread crumbs, fry in a little olive oil to get it nice an soft and crispy. Then mix up ricotta, 1/2 cup spinich, a little nutmeg, parmesan, mozzerella and a beaten egg soemtimes add a little toasted pine nuts too.... spread it in the crispy eggplant slices, roll it up - put a little sauce on top with more parmasen and mozzarella - bake it and let it sit for an hour. YUMMMY.

I cut the eggplant strips in half after baking them. Then I filled them and cut them in half again. With a toothpick in each little piece I put a spoonful of sauce over over it and baked til the cheese was melted and warm. Big,big hit at Happy Hour. Excellent appetizer and a filling one at that!

Of the many 4 fork recipes I make, my husband LOVES this one. I'm not a huge eggplant fan, but it really is delish--I admit. It's time consuming, with the fresh breadcrumbs and grating cheeses and such, but really special for someone who appreciates it. I always use a fresh marinara from the local Italian shop (saves me a few steps) and it's awesome. Worth the work for eggplant fans. . .

I like to use part-skim mozzarella and it tastes the same. Also, using store bought breadcrumbs and bottled pasta sauce is a good way to cut down on the price of making this dish. It makes some of the best leftovers I have ever had, and I always make enough so that I can take it to school with me for lunch for a couple of days. However, it is really high in calories and fat.

This is delicious. I agree with another person that it is restaurant quality. Baking the eggplant works out great and except for an oil spray on the cookie sheet, there is no sauteeing so no extra oil. The only things I would change are to put mozzarella cheese on the top because it looks better and to cook at 450 degrees for 20 minutes so the cheese on the top browns. My vegetarian daughter LOVES this. I use a homemade marinara sauce and it is over the top!

Very good. The ricotta needs to drain 24 hours or at least overnight. I also salt (kosher) the eggplant for 40 minutes then rinse and pat completely dry before dipping in the flour/egg/breadcrumbs. Fresh breadcrumbs and homemade sauce make all the difference. This is a great dish to make ahead of time to let the flavors blend.

Very good. Even my eggplant-hating boyfriend said it was delicious! I made it as directed except that I rolled up some prosciutto with the cheeses. It tasted even better the next day.

Delicious! After reading the reviews I wish I had made my own breadcrumbs, but just didn't have the time. I also used Asian eggplants because that's all that we had in the house- they were too small to make rolls with, so I just layered the slices in a baking dish- came out great. Will make again.

I love this recipe with a small variation - I hammer some chicken fillet very fine and roll this in as well. I then wrap the roll in plain pastry sheet before baking. These additions give it a bit more substance

I had previously fried and frozen rounds of eggplant, so I just layered them in a casserole with the cheese mixture and sauce. Turned out lovely, but I do think the "rollatini" would make a nicer presentation and will try that next time.

This is good, not "a dish beyond compare," but I would certainly make it again. It easily serves 8 and can be made ahead for company, which is nice. I used Rayo's marinara sauce and that gave it an especially good flavor.

Both husband and I loved this! I was in a hurry so I shamefully admit I used store bought Progresso bread crumbs and store bought marinara sauce and I added a package of frozen, drained chopped spinach. it was still absolutely fabulous! And I also took a former reviewers advice and didn't bother rolling, instead I made it "sandwich-log style" - one layer of eggplant, a layer of the spinach, a layer of the cheese mixture, and topped it with another eggplant, the sauce and sprinkled cheese. We could only eat one "log" - it is filling ! - That and a small salad makes a great meal. We both have lunch for tomorrow and I froze the rest so hope it freezes well. Absolutely will make again, and will try with fresh ingredients and rolling for that special dinner.

To Nikkiphx: I am just wondering how you make your sauce. I will share mine with you, if you will do likewise. I am always trying to improve upon all of my cooking techniques and recipes. I have not made this, but plan on it soon (maybe even tonight) and put 4 forks so that I didn't stray anyone looking from trying it.

I've made this a few times, all to rave reviews. I use my own sauce and NEVER scimp on the fresh breadcrumbs. Delicious!

This was a true restaurant quality dish! I used some homemade sauce that I always keep on hand as I have never found a store-bought version that can hold a candle to it. The only other change I made was to stack the slices of eggplant with the filling in between and on top instead of rolling it up inside. My slices were a little too thick to roll, but stacking them worked out beautifully. Using fresh breadcrumbs is a must and I love how crisp it was without having to fry it. This one is a definite keeper!

Great dish. I use my own sauce with a few shortcuts. I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and I season the flour instead of each individual eggplant slice. I also use my food processor to finely grate the parmesan cheese, leave only what will be used in the filling, add the basil & pulse a few times then mix in the rest of the filling ingredients. My italian husband goes nuts for this. I didn't even think I liked eggplant before this. Yum! It is a regular in our house now.

This recipe was perfect. I used all the ingredients as described and everyone loved it. Next time I will try part-skim mozzarella and ricotta. It is filling! As others mentioned, make sure that you don't overcook the eggplant. It can dry out quickly.

After reading all of the rave reviews, I was a bit disappointed in this one. Sorry to be the one dissenting vote, however, I felt this had way too much breading on it. The filling was very good and an unusual twist, so I would probably try it again, but without any breading. You still need to bake the eggplant in order to be able to roll and stuff, but it would make for a lighter dish. Thanks to all the cooks out there for submitting reviews...it's a big help in deciding whether or not to try a recipe and/or make revisions. Love this website!

My family loved this recipe. Even my hubby who is terribly frightened of eggplant. I was talking to my sister on the phone when making it, so ended up slicing the eggplant into rounds rather than lengthwise strips because I wasn't paying attention to the recipe. Worked out great though. Just breaded & baked the rounds as instructed, then layered them in the oiled pan, topped with sauce, then cheese, eggplant rounds, sauce, then parmesan. Really good - even better the 2nd day.

This was absolutely fabulous. Great for vegetarians. Non vegetarians will never miss the meat. Would work well as an appetizer, just go easy on the cheese. These are very filling. I'd like to make a bunch at once and freeze it. Anyone know if it freezes well?

I really enjoyed this recipe. Be careful not to slice the eggplant too thin (I experitmented with some thinner slices for my husband who does not care for eggplant) b/c the bread coating will overpower the flavor of the eggplant. I loved the filling, and used the left over filling as a topping for non-fried green tomatoes (slice green tomatoes, use same bread coating as instucted in this recipe and bake, top baked tomatoes with cheese filling and cover with marinara, heat and serve). Yum, I will definately make this again.

I actually was just looking for a recipe for eggplant parmesan, where the eggplant wasn't fried. The recipe was perfect, oven baked gave it a great crispy outside with out all the oil. Maybe I will try the rest of the recipe someday

This is a fantastic recipe! It was a huge hit at a recent potluck. Even the people who don't normally like eggplant really were surprised by how good this was. The flavors just came together wonderfully! It was soo good, I am sure I will make it again. Cooking Tips: Allow 2 hours for this recipe (start to finish). I only did about 12 eggplant rolls since that's all that would fit in the pan. I had a good amount of leftover cheese filling, but it was really tasty when I used the leftovers in a lasagna.

This recipe is excellent!! I would highly reccomend it. It has become a new favorite in my house. It was fairly easy to make. There were nothing left over by the end of the night. I added a little pecorino Romano to my sauce. I think it is best when you use a homemade sauce with it.

This is an amazingly simple and scrumptious recipe! I made it lower in fat by using skim milk instead of egg to bread the eggplant strips and stuffed it with part-skim ricotta and mozzarella. I also added some strained spinach to the ricotta before speading it on the baked eggplant - for the healthful benefits and the added taste. In addition, I used my own sauce; to which I added soy meat crumbles, mushrooms and sauteed garlic. I served it over angelhair pasta and topped it with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan. Simply amazing..!!

Delicious. I substitued cream cheese for the ricotta ( because I cant't get that here) and I made a homemade sauce with a good amount of red wine and some brown sugar - everyone loved it. The sweeter sauce was a nice compliment. I also found that if you grill eggplant with oil and balsamic vinegar and then roll with the cold cheese filling, it is a nice appetizer with a different taste and the cold cheese goes nicely with the hot eggplant.

I made this for guests (& their children), expecting the kids would eat only pasta, but this dish was a big hit with everyone. My 9-year-old turned up her nose when she saw me making eggplant, but after one required bite, had many helpings; two 5-year-olds also really enjoyed it, as did all the adults. I realized too late that I'd overlooked the word "lengthwise" in cutting eggplant, so they didn't roll tightly but were still very tasty and the cheese held them together. A little expensive--$5 worth of parmesan alone and a few bucks for a tiny amount of fresh basil in winter; what we had dried from our garden would probably have been fine. But any dish that satisfies adults and their kids this well is a gem in my book. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe has become a standby in my house - it's elegant but very easy and DELICIOUS!...I find that you don't need to bake the eggplant as long as is listed (10-15 minutes is fine) and they actually hold their shape better if they're still a little stiff. I've made this with un-breaded eggplant once or twice and it came out great.

I made this exactly as listed and it was wonderful! The previous review listed a problem with the eggplant sticking. I had just the opposite. I sprayed my sheets with cooking spray and when I removed the sheets to turn over the eggplant slices, they were sliding all over. In the end, the eggplant slices were so crispy yet pliable enough to roll easily. I started munching on some extra slices. Be careful, once you start tasting, it's hard to stop! What a wonderful vegetarian meal.

This recipe was good. It took a little while to make since it requires fresh breadcrumbs, some chopping and mixing, and the eggplant are baked for 30 minutes, followed by the rollatini. The part that was most problematic was that the eggplant stuck to the baking sheet first when I tried to turn them over, and then when I removed them to fill them. It was easy to roll the eggplant slices, and it came out looking very nice. I used farmer cheese rather than ricotta, only because that's what I had on hand. I also sprinkled Parmesan, not mozzarella, over the rollatini. This recipe has a nice taste, and would be a great vegetarian dish to make for a dinner party or buffet.

My husband and I absolutely loved this! I used the remains of a rosemary-garlic loaf for the breadcrumbs and it was delicious.
