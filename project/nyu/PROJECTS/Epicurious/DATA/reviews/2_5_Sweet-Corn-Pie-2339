I omitted the green onion and celery leaves, and opted to season with dry seasonings: Onion powder, Greek Seasoning, Garlic powder and black pepper. I also used whole milk, decreasing to 1 cup. I was able to make a very smooth egg/ cheese mix using a hand mixer, and overall the pie was good, but not amazing. My husband's gripe was that there was too much crust - perhaps just the bottom crust would suffice...

We found this more liking to an egg pie with some corn in it. The flavor of the corn was lost in this very bland-tasting recipe. The presentation was nice and with some modifications could potentially be a real winner.

I made this recipe several times with rave reviews. My family has requested it for Thanksgiving this year and an alternative to plain old corn. It's so easy,makes a great presentation and tastes great!

This was a uniquely delicious dish. I made it for a dinner party and the recipe was requested by at least 3 guests.
