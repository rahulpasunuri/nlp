I made the pesto and served it with canned tomato soup. It was very yummy! My husband loved it, and he doesn't usually like tomato soup.

This tasted like lightly seasoned tomato sauce from a can. Not interesting and unfortunately, not something I'd make again.

Disappointing recipe. Good ingredients were used but it tasted like a deconstructed tomato sauce. Did not use cream or vodka.

Not the worst tomato soup, but not the best. I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit too salty. I halved the recipe and it was more than enough for a dinner. The pesto is nice, and you don't even need to add the cheese.

Loved this!! I served it hot with toasted bread that I brushed with olive oil and broiled with a bit of mozzarella. Easy on the lemon juice, I felt one tablespoon was a bit too much lemon. But I did use the vodka!!

This is our new favorite tomato soup recipe. I've found there are really only two kinds of tomato soups: healthier, dairy-free ones that basically taste like eating pasta sauce and very unhealthy ones drenched in cream, cheese and/or butter. This is neither! Didn't bother to core the tomatoes and didn't scoop out all the seeds (I think they're the yummiest part). Just cut the tops off the tomatoes and scooped the juciest bits so they wouldn't be swimming in the oven. Covered pan with olive oil and roasted the tomatoes cut-side-down. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. We couldn't even wait for it to cool it smelled so good. I'll be interested to see how it is for lunch 1.5 days later. Since it's winter i'll probably heat it up. Didn't do the pesto, but i've never met a pesto i didn't like.

This is a great tomato soup recipe, but I prefer it hot and have now made it four times in the past 2 months. I've also made this pesto and put in pretty jars to give to friends as gifts. I saved some calories and took out the cream, but obviously cream can only make this delicious soup better.

I come from a long-line of foodies, and I have made this several times. It is consistently a favorite. I also omit the cream, it doesn't need it. This is also my go-to for pesto as well. I've made large batches of the pesto and given to friends in pretty jars, a really unique and colorful host/hostess gift. So good, I absolutely recommend making this recipe.

My husband raved about it and bragged about it to a friend. We had it hot the first night and leftovers cold the next day; it was great both ways although possibly better cold (as intended).

I forgot to add that I also used a lump of goat cheese to give it some creaminess (instead of the cream).

really tasty. I omitted the cream because I knew I'd be making this to accompany grilled cheese. Also used regular basil pesto. oh, and I ate it hot, not cold. So, a few changes :) But this was super delicious and I'll be eating it for a few days. Highly recommended.

GOOD good GOOD ... but .. the Tbl of salt is a bit salty. The first batch I made, I ended up having to puree in a roasted butternut squash to cut the saltiness (which actually turned out incredible, added a bit more body and texture, so from now on, I'm going to start with 1/2 the salt the recipe calls for, and always add butternut squash because it was so good). I didnt prepare the arugula pesto, instead used basil from the garden and pureed into the batch. This is so good, that I went back to our local farm stand, bought 30 lbs of tomotoes, and am making 8 more batches for the freezer :) Make this soup with a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich ! Yum !

Definitely a keeper. A nice chunky soup. Great Flavor.Easy to make. What's not to like??? I used a mixture of summer fresh heirloom tomatoes. Perfect!

I love this recipe. Had dinner party and served the chilled tomato soup with pesto with grilled shrimp and crusty bread. Rave reviews- the vodka gives it a nice kick. The next night had leftover soup with grilled cheese sandwiches. This cold soup is a nice option for comfort food when its so hot in the south

This is super easy and very flavorful. The vodka is a must as it adds nice dimension. I read dunncarter's review about the salt and the since the writer seemed to know what he/she was talking about, I added the full TBLS of salt which, in my opinion should have been halfed. (This is a preference thing...) The grocery store was out of arugula so I used basil from the garden for the pesto which worked great!

I made 1/2 recipie. Substituted 14 oz canned roasted tomatoes with roasted red peppers. Gave it the snap I was looking for. Also chilled the bowls i served it in- great on a really hot day! Made it the day before I served it. A splash of good Vodka kicks it up.

Wonderful flavor even without the cream. For some reason (probably bc the tomatoes don't cook for very long or thanks to the canned ones) the soup is not too acidic, as tomato soups can get, which is a wonderful thing! The pesto is great, too. Really enjoyed this variation on the traditional.

This soup delivers exceptional results for the amount of effort required. We used it to start a multi-course dinner after a hot day and both the temperature and taste were a refreshing entry to the meal. I did make a few notes. How many fresh tomatoes to use could be tricky to interpret. I ended up with equal parts canned and "fresh tomato flesh" in the blender and it worked out great. Therefore, keep in mind when purchasing tomatoes that the core and seeds will be removed. the arugula pesto is a nice twist. Before the Parmesan is added, the taste is overpowering and I was afraid that I wouldn't like the end result. After addition of the cheese and dilution in the soup, however, its a real winner

This soup was phenomenal. The vodka adds a very nice tang and the arugula is a must for the pesto. Follow the recipe precisely (INCLUDING THE FULL ONE TABLESPOON OF KOSHER SALT) and you'll have yourself an amazing little bowl of wonder. Now, let's address the salt issue some reviewers are flabbergasted about: the recipe calls for kosher salt. Good chefs and most foodies know that because kosher grains occupy more volume (for equal weight), the volume of kosher salt should be increased in any given recipe. Twice as much kosher salt (by volume) to replace table salt serves as a rough estimate. Go ahead with the full tablespoon - the creator of this fantastic soup recipe knows what she's talking about. ;)

This is the second time I made this soup. This time around, I served warm and it was just as good. Bought expensive "farmers market" tomatoes. Did not make a difference. By accident, I added fire tomatoes with chilies in it. Nice mistake! The pesto is to die for. I TBS must be a typo. Salt to taste is always the way I go.

Loved this soup. Going to make it again for my roommates. Didn't make it with the pesto, bit it was still delicious. I also live near a grocery store with very little variety, so I couldn't find fire roasted tomatoes. I look forward to the day with I can make it with them with as good as this recipe is now without them!

Pretty sure the author goofed -- a whole tablespoon of salt would be WAY too much for this soup. Add to taste only, mine came out to around 1 tsp. I loved this recipe. Roasted tomatoes are novel and bring a great consistency that canned tomatoes can't. Can't wait to try with grilled fresh tomatoes next summer. Arugula pesto is bitter, nutty, herbal and yummy, it makes the soup sing. It's well worth getting out your food processor. I served with grilled cheese sandwiches on rustic Italian. Oh, and I subbed greek yogurt for the cream, something that wouldn't have worked in a traditional tomato soup but was great in this.

Loved this recipe. For the Pesto, I added an extra clove of garlic and used 3/4 cup of parmesan instead of 1/2 cup. Also added freshly ground black pepper.

This soup was a huge hit, I recommend being diligent about taking out all of the seeds during the "core" process. Had a good suggestion from a friend to put the pesto in a squeeze bottle to make the nice pattern otherwise it's a little clumpy and hard to make pretty. Tried it with and without the cream and pesto and it works great all ways. We paired it with a nice Syrah and it cut our savory wild rice stuffed chicken breast really well. It's a nice alternative to gazpacho. I will definitely make this over and over!!

This soup is so delicious. The arugula pesto is the best part, don't skip it!

I was looking for a simple tomato soup recipe to use for the gorgeous tomatoes at my local summertime farmers market - jackpot! I added some sauteed chopped garlic to the cooked tomatoes before blending and didn't make the pesto, but I loved it. Plus, my add-salt-and-pepper-to-everything fiance didn't add a single thing :)

Very good! Made the soup and pesto per the recipe, but increased the amount of arugula in pesto.

Very easy and tasty. I did not do the pesto but it was still delish!!

Absolutely delicious! Made both the pesto and the soup and they were a perfect match together. Followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is especially great since most of the recipe requires no hot electronics to be on so it is perfect to make on a hot summer day. Served the soup with some grilled shrimp and it was a perfect meal!

Wanted a light, virtually no-cook dinner on this hot summer night. Made the pesto only, reducing the olive oil and parmesan cheese by half, and served over boxed organic tomato soup. Good.
