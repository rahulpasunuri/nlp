Pleasantly surprised! Salmon was delicious -hot night so we grilled it rather than what the recipe said but we used the basil and salt/pepper. Tomatillo makes lots of extra, but it is very good, will definitely make again!

Didn't think the tomatillo went together with salmon as well as, say, chicken. The two were tasty on their own, the flavors just didn't meld so well.

Excellent. I omitted any heat and instead used two chili rellenos. We first tried it with chicken and it was good, but the following night had it as written with salmon and it was amazing. My 4-year-old loves the sauce with both chicken and salmon. We can't get enough and will be making this for guests in the near future.

I loved this. First dinner I made in a long while that I just swooned over. I expected the "coulis" to be like tomatillo salsa, but it wasn't. It was more concentrated and richer. Was delicious over the salmon and the garlicky rice I served with it. Don't know how anyone could say the sauce has no flavor, since it's full of roasted tomatillos, poblanos and garlic, plus fresh lime and cilantro. Yum!

This is an overall stellar recipe. The tomatillo coulis for this recipe is fantastic. I use it for several other mexican dishes, especially chicken enchiladas.

I know I'm in the minority, but I thought this recipe was very so so. I added more garlic and red pepper flakes in an attempt to make it taste like something!! I won't waste my time again.

The tomatillo-chile pepper sauce is sensational. I now prepare it in a double batch and use it with many other entrees (pork loin, plain old chicken breasts, etc). I process all but 1/2 poblano until I see how hot it's running, add that at the end if needed. The sauce keeps well for at least a week in fridge and can be warmed gently in the microwave. It also makes a great dip with corn chips. I skin the salmon fillets, skip the peppercorns, serve with sauce under and julienned basil sprinkled over. Last night I used some of my stash to go with Epicurious #102662, spiced pork tenderloin. Great improvement!

the tomatillo sauce was wonderful, i searved it on the side with the salmon, and on the other half of the plate i werved the salad. it made a wonderful presentation and we could each add the sauce to our own taste.
