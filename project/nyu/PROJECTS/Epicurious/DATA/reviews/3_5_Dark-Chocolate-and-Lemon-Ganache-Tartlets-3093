I made this as written for a dinner party. Every one loved it. I liked it a lot. What I really liked about it is that it looks impressive and can be made ahead of time. Not even any slicing or serving. Just served it with a few berries. The ganache was a little firm. I would have liked it a bit softer/creamier. Either let it warm to room temp or next time I might add a little lemon juice(as suggested) or a bit more heavy cream. Very rich dessert. Home made crust is a must. The crust was delicious.

I am a big chocolate lover and so is my boyfriend, we were looking for something chocolatey, fruity and easy! This was the best combination. Of course, we did change the recipe a bit... We used a no-bake pie shell and made it into one big tart. 30 min. from start to finish, tops. There was nothing to bake- highly underated! Then we tripled the creme and doubled the chocolate. We grated 2 lemon zests but felt that although very chocolatey and delicious, it was missing some "umph" so we added the juice of one of the lemons. And that was it. When we tasted it after that we knew we had reached perfection. It was very thick and rich. I suggest serving with some juicy fruit or for next time add some fresh fruit into the ganache- that's what I'm going to do.

My girlfriend and I were invited to a pie aprty and decided to give this one a try. We (unfortunately) forgo the special crust and used a store-bought one, we think that cost us first prize. We tripled the recipe, using 16 oz. semiswweet chocolate and 4 oz. of unsweetened. We also found that the lemon wasn't noticable enough so we added around a 1/4 cup of lemon juice in addition to the zest. It tastes wonderful. Very rich, but not over the top too rich like a fudge or mousse can be. I think it could use something like a berry garnish, something light and not so sweet to set it off. Anyhoo, yum- go for it!

I used 16 oz chocolate and I'm glad I did. The tartlettes were still a tad underfull. The crispy pastry and the subtle lemon with the dark chocolate was delicious. Easy to make!

This dessert makes a great finish to a hearty meal and never disappoints. It's especially favored by chocolate lovers but has been enjoyed by all, One warning...each tartlet is so rich that we have found that it is rarely finished by a single person!
