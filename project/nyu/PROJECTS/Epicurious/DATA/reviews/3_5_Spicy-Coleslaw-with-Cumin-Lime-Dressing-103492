I follow the dressing and salting modifications recommended by A Cook from Corvalis, OR. As a result, this is my go-to recipe for a stand-out cole slaw. I love it, love it, love it.

I am surprised to agree with the reviewers who rated this recipe mediocre. I had higher hopes, too. Maybe lime juice is just not acid enough to really macerate bagged slaw cabbage, which is surely less fresh than a head of cabbage (although my bag was several days before the expire date). I wonder if all the negative reviews used bagged slaw? I even added one lime zest trying to boost the favor. The slaw rested for at least three hours at room temp before I served. Substituted parsley for cilantro. Can't believe how common this soapy- tasting herb has become. Yech.

Made with purple cabbage to top my fish tacos! Yum Yum Yum. So good with toasted corn tortillas, guacamole, and grilled cod.

Like many I used bagged cabbage, more cilantro and cumin. The final addition was a finely chopped jalapeño that adds a little more zing.

Love all of these tastes but added more cumin, more fresh cilantro and left out the garlic. I also about a 1/4 cup of a bottled honey mustard salad dressing to make it a bit more creamy.And added some lime zest. Might be good with a Greek yogurt? This is a recipe I will play with some more, especially when serving India food.

I didn't care for this. I agree with the previous poster about the it not being assertive enough. I found it rather bland and apparently mu guests did too as many didn't even finish what was on their plates.

I don't like mayonnaise so I gave this a try. It makes a cleansing side dish to a feisty entree, but if the entree isn't assertive this salad offers little support.

This coleslaw rocks! And so healthy. This is a first 4 fork rating for me. I even left out the onion and cilantro, not a huge fan. Otherwise made as is with great results. Excellent on a salad or with something on the grill.

I made some slight modifications to the recipe by combining it with a similar salad from Cooks Illustrated. As the others said, don't bother cooking the carrots. CI recommended mixing 1t salt with the shredded cabbage and allowing it to sit out and wilt for 1 to 4 hours before rinsing it with cold water and refrigerating. My alteration to the dressing: 2T fresh lime juice 2T olive oil 2T rice vinegar 1T honey 1t lime zest 1t cumin 1 clove garlic, minced freshly ground black pepper to taste pinch of cayenne(i had to substitute curry powder, which wasn't spicy but was delicious) It was good to let the salad sit so the flavors could blend for about half an hour before eating. Everyone at the BBQ loved it and some were even putting it on their hamburgers.

This is the most delicious cole slaw I've ever had. The only change I made was to use red cabbage because I prefer the flavor and it makes it a beautiful colorful salad. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious! I did make some minor changes. First, didn't bother blanching the carrots, seemed like that would make them mushy and I like crunchy coleslaw. Also reduced the number of onions. I made a 1/2 batch and only used 1/4 onion, so if making a full batch I will probably only use a half of a small onion. It would be way too overpowering. I also cheated and used bagged cabbage and carrots- way easier. All in all, it was wonderful, light and refreshing. I am planning on making it again to use on my lime cilantro fajitas, and will use the dressing on salads, as it was quick and delicious. One other note- this is not for anyone who does not care for the tartness of lime. It has the definite zing, but for me, that was what made it especially great! You may wonder why I only gave it three forks; I agree with others when saying "how can you give a recipe four forks when you made changes?"

This is an awesome slaw recipe! I didn't bother blanching the carrots and it was great. I also added a little more cumin and cilantro. It's easy to make ahead, keeping the dressing separate form the rest of the ingredients and then just toss together when ready to serve. I always get lots of compliments on this recipe-nice alternative to the creamy version!

A nice variation from more typical coleslaw. Not tremendously spicy -- just a hint of hot. The lime in the dressing is quite refreshing. Note that this is much better when first made than as leftovers, so plan accordingly.

I love this light and crunchy cole slaw. I too used a bag of shredded coleslaw mix and then just added the rest of the ingredients. With a little dab of Dave's insanity sauce this is one fabulous coleslaw! It was wonderful with my shrimp and andouille cakes.

Bleccchhhh. Don't waste your time on this. Even after kicking up the cumin and adding a little sugar to take the edge off the lime juice, this was so bland it wasn't worth the effort. Waste of a good $1.50 red bell pepper and three carrots. I at least bought shredded cabbage so that work was avoided, but what a waste! Don't bother with this one - I think it's unsalvageable. And am absolutely amazed at the glowing responses. Different strokes, I guess.................:-(

Very good. I used pre shredded cabbage from the store. It was by far the favorite at a 7/4/04 picnic. Next time I'm doubling the hot pepper sauce.

I love this slaw! I have served it with smoked brisket sandwiches, fish tacos and people can't get enough of it. The flavors are fantastic, but I add a little sugar to take the edge off the lime juice. I could eat the whole recipe!

I was a bit iffy with this recipe, especially after I had mixed the lime juice and olive oil together. There didn't seem to be too much flavor. But as soon as I mixed it all together, it was AWESOME! My guests love the flavors of this salad. It was truly a hit. It's light and flavorful. I would definitely make this again!!!

This is perfect for a Spring/Summer salad. The lime and cilantro flavors are refreshing. Great with salmon or cold sesame noodles.

:-) I didn't expect it to be as sgood as it was. Very tasty. The salad was nice and crunchy, and unlike another cook, I love the flavors of lime and cilantro. I plan on making the dressing for regular salads also. Definitely a keeper.

Prepare yourself. If you don't love the flavors of lime and cilantro then your won't like this recipe. I tried mayonaise and still couldnt cut it. Sorry, my first epicurious failure.

I've made this about 5 times, and it always is a hit. Don't bother boiling the carrots -- a nice, clever, colorful alternative is to peel the carrots, then use the peeler to get long strips of paper-thin carrot. Blends nicely with the rest of the sliced veggies. I also mince the onions so they blend in flavor-wise better; and I use 4 cups of green cabbage and 2 cups of red cabbage for over-the-top color. Add a little more tabasco and ground black pepper to the dressing, and viola: It's like a fireworks show on the plate AND in your mouth!

A major hit among adults AND teenagers...I also shredded the carrots, added salt and kicked it up a notch with more hot sauce and cumin. I've made this several times and it has disappeared quickly.

This is so delicious (at least the way I made it)! I don't like bell peppers so I omitted them as well as the carrots, substituted green onions for the red onions, and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil. It was very easy to toss together. This is great if you love cilantro. Mmmmmmm! I can't stop eating this!

This is simple to prepare and has outstanding flavor. It is equally as good on salad greens as it is on coleslaw. So far, everyone who we've served this to has raved. Can't understand those who thought it was bland. We do add salt to our dressing. Maybe that would make a difference.

Rating: 1
I have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers - the dressing was quite bland. Also, I sliced the onions 'thinly' but they should be paper thin. The onion flavor really stood out from the rest of the veggies. The slaw was very colorful and appealing too bad about the flavor.

I have served this at several parties and everyone asks for the recipe!!! Easy, good and healthy!

A great slaw recipe and always a hit! I just grate the raw carrots instead of precooking. You can also buy the bagged slaw mix which already has carrots. My sister adds about a tsp. of mayonnaise to the dressing.

Rating: 3
Good slaw. I added a little honey to the dressing. I think the negative comments might be due to folks being used to heavier slaw recipes. This one is very different, and tasty!

a huge hit - served it on top of sirlon burgers

I have made this several times to rave reviews and am astounded by the negative comments! The entire meal; slaw, basmati and corn salad, marinated tri-tip and cherry tomato relish have all be enjoyed by gourmands from 10 - 70!

What a disappointment and waste of good ingredients. While the salad was quite pretty the dressing was a huge disappointment. It lacked something in flavor...bland and boring. Most everything I make from this site has turned out to be a 4-fork rating...but not this salad :(

The cumin-lime dressing is a classic - works well even if you don't have all the salad ingredients on hand. I've done it with just cabbage, onion, and peppers, but it's prettier with the carrots and cilantro.

The dressing was oily and bland. I doubled the seasonings and it was still tasteless.

Even my kids liked this one as written. I think that the barely cooked carrots are very good, but I would definitely just grate them if time was short. This slaw is great with the Tri-tip Roast with Tequilla Marinade and Cherry Tomato Relish.

I really liked this and was surprised at the more negative reviews. My husband and I loved the tangy not creamy dressing and I also cheated once and used bagged coleslaw/carrot mix and put in the other ingredients and it was still great.

Super clean, light, and easy. I've never understood the need to have "goopy" coleslaw. No need to cook carrots. Tastes great next day too. Goes great with the crab cakes with chipotle sauce on this website. A definite repeat.

Too acidic for both of us. Needed perhaps something creamy? Aside from that, I agree cooking the carrots is make work. I grated mine.

Great tart, complex, garlicky salad! When I first made this, I made it again 4 nights running. I did not cook the carrots first, seemed silly. I just cut them into very small dice. I also found that with a little leftover dressing saved in frige, you have the basis for the next batch -- Just add a little more oil. Also, to save calories I only used half the oil. Seemed to be just as delicious. My boyfriend and I are vegetarians and we serve this with falafel pitas, or grains with Middle East flavorings and veggies.
