Excellent! Plan ahead and prepare what you can ahead. Making the sauce ahead allows the flavors to enfuse the sauce. For those of you who wish to thicken the sauce, I might suggest potato starch instead of corn starch or 1/2 teaspoon of flour well mixed with butter to form a chick pea-sized ball. These won't leave the taste of cornstarch in your sauce and have less risk of lumping your sauce. I followed the instructions amost to a T and it turned out perfectly. As I didnt hve any port, I used sherry. The salt brining was a surprise! It didn't make the meat too salty and it was THE most tender meat I have EVER enjoyed. I will serve it with a yorkshire pudding next time. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Loved this recipe and it was a hit with guests. I added a little corn starch mixed with water to the sauce to give it a thicker consistency. It worked well.

My 3.25 lb tender too 55 min. to reach 130, which was a good pick center and quite moist and tasty. Didn't use this marinade and brining method--tenderloin doesn't need to be any more tender and I have to watch salt intake. This Port Sauce is SuPERB and highly recommend it and it's quite easy to make. It took me about 26 min. to boil it down to 1.5 cups using my highest rate stainless saucepan.

We made this for xmas dinner and it was excellent!! Based on some reviews, I thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch. The guys still said they would like it thicker - more like gravy.

Rating: 4
I didn't make the sauce but the directions for cooking the beef was right on and the meat was sublime! Salting didn't seem to make the meat saltier after being cooked. I bought a prime tenderloin from Costco ($90.00 for about 6 lbs. - took a while to trim all the fat and ended up with only about 4 lbs. of meat but still worth buying). Cooked the meat exactly half an hour and it was perfectly medium rare. Couldn't believe how tender and flavorful it was. There was enough for four people and another whole meal the next night. Served with Bearnaise sauce. To die for!

Sorry, while the Port sauce was truly phenomenal, some of the directions for roasting the meat were a little off to me. IMHO, it should have directed to wipe the meat of much of the salt, before proceeding to oil prior to roasting, and the timing was way off....our roast was only 3.5 lbs. and even @ 140 degrees was more like RARE then med-rare. TOO SALTY/TOO RAW!

This was absolutely amazing. Followed the recipe exactly and turned out perfectly. Made a 6 lb roast for 10 adults, had barely any leftovers. Thank goodness there were some it was to die for! Will most definitely make again. Easy, too.

This was so delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated.(but used boxed beef stock) While the gravy was thin, it was well enjoyed by all. It complimented the meat so very well. I even was only able to cure the meat for twelve hours and it tasted great. Can't wait to make it again for next Christmas! My father-in-law said this was one of the best Christmas meals he's ever eaten. Thanks, Epi!

Amazing, and foolproof! Of course, the secret to this entree is the quality of your tenderloin. I was entertaining while making this for Xmas Eve dinner, and lost track of how I was altering the proportions in the sauce. Definitely put in too much port and not enough broth (I used a demi-glace instead). Regardless, all the guests were swooning. Considering it was my first attempt at this recipe, I couldn't be happier. So easy, and relatively quick. This will be our go-to centerpiece every Christmas Eve meal from now on. Served with mustard horseradish roast potatoes as someone else recommended. A nice CA Petit Syrah was a winning partner.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe, and so easy. The texture of the beef prepared this way is outstanding - very tender in the center with a nice seared crust. Our guests raved. I bought a whole tenderloin and trimmed it myself - which is not for the faint of heart,but is completely doable if you take your time (there are some good youtube tutorials). By trimming yourself you can leave more of the fat on the tenderloin than a butcher would for steaks, which is better for roasting.

I have made this recipe multiple times for guests, and it always receive rave reviews. If you are desirous of a "gravy", then you will need to thicken the sauce. I have also experimented with using Tarragon instead of the rosemary in the sauce, and find it has a better flavour. The meat cooks fairly quickly at the temperature, so use a meat thermometer or it could quickly become overcooked and dry. I also use multicoloured peppercorns on the meat, just for aesthetic purposes.

I've been making beef tenderloin for Christmas Eve for years,marinating overnight, searing, then roasting. This preparation is truly amazing. After the 36 hours in the refrigerator, I made a few incisions and inserted garlic slivers into the beef, as it came to room temperature. The salt, garlic, olive oil and fresh cracked pepper were enough to make such a flavorful tenderloin. This will now be my default method for cooking tenderloin, and possibly other cuts of beef as well.

I made this for a dinner party for ten. Used a 6.5 pound tenderloin which was the perfect size for the group, no leftovers. The meat took about 40 minutes to cook to a internal temperature of 135 which was a perfect medium rare after resting for 15 minutes. I would highly recommend using a meat thermometer and to keep a eye on the meat while it is in the oven. Cooks very quickly at this high temperature so stay on top of it. The only disappointment for me was the sauce. Nice flavor but never really thickened. I even purchased some veal demi glace to add and while it improved the flavor it still retained its watery texture. Only 3 forks for me because of the sauce.

This is absolutely fantastic. I've been making for Christmas dinner for past 5 years. If I didn't there would be mutiny of the chef. Do the brine for 36 hours. My 4.25#er cooked in 32 minutes and was perfect after resting. I serve with the port sauce, horseradish potatoes gratin and various versions of green verts. Leftovers are perfect for the next day when my kitchen is closed. Enjoy!

I made this for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews from all my guests. Both the meat and the sauce were delectable. Making the stock involves little effort and is well worth it. My finished sauce was not thick but pretty much as shown in the photo. This is a sauce, not a gravy. The beef preparation was unusual but it worked beautifully; the meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. This will be my go to recipe for special dinners.

Rating: 4
Post Script to my original review. I do recommend removing the roast from the oven maybe 15 minutes sooner than instructed as the meat will continue cooking for a while. I simply cut some slices for the guests that preferred well-cooked and returned them to the oven for just a few minutes until the pink was gone. The sauce was thin like an au jus sauce, but was preferred over a thinker sauce for this particular dish.

This recipe is a winner and a keeper. This will be the third New Year's Eve dinner with this recipe,which always gets rave reviews from my guests, including one guest who is a caterer. The only thing I did differently was to use store-bought beef stock, which I doubt made any difference. Otherwise, I pretty much stuck with the original recipe. I think the dry brining is what makes this spectacular.

The meat was, of course, tender and delicious. The two forks is because the roasting time was WAY off, unless my oven is completely out of whack. (I do have a separate oven thermometer) It took my 3 lb roast over and hour to achieve what my instant-read thermo called 135 (in 3 different places). But even after resting, the meat was bloody-rare! This was fine for one half the table, not so much for the rest. And of course the rest of the meal was warmed over. So. Sigh. Oh, and I thought the sauce with stock from a box was fine.But yes, not thick.

The reviews are great, I will try this. I want to cook it on a gas grill without tying it so I can do the middle medium rare and the end well done. High heat? Open lid or closed? How long?

Made for a dinner party (have done this for Christmas before as well). Did not have time for the full 36 hours of salt brining, but did it for about 4 hours. Sauce is not good with purchased beef stock, it reduces but never thickens. Would probably skip the sauce and do something else. Not sure if the 4 stars is for the recipe or a cut of meat that is over $100 which is hard to ruin.

This will be my standard beef tenderloin recipe from now on. I do have to say that I only had a 3 pound tenderloin and on the advise of a family member pulled it out of the oven at 110 degrees. After resting it was perfectly medium rare. If I had let it go until 125 it would have been way too overcooked! I made the port sauce with homemade beef stock from a prior epicurious recipe. It was phenomenal.

This is a big statement but it is true: this was probably the best beef I have ever eaten. I made this for a Xmas dinner and everyone went crazy for it. This is a special recipe and one I only use for special occasions as it requires a lot of steps...make beef stock,make port sauce, reduce port sauce, etc. But the sauce can be made ahead. You also have to have foresight with this recipe. The salting step is key here, but it needs to be done at least a day ahead. The meat is so flavorful and melts in your mouth. All in all an incredible recipe! I highly recommend it for special occasions when you are willing to spend the time (and money!)

Rating: 4
Picture perfect recipe. I had my butcher prepare the meat with string for me. The brining was an interesting process. The roast baked perfectly with little effort on my part. The sauce seemed a bit runny, as I would have liked to thicken it. Both the steak and sauce were very peppery in flavor, which I love. I sauteed some button mushrooms on the side to serve on top. Perfect amount for all. Would make again!

Rating: 3
To add to the previous review as well: I took it out at 124F and it cooked up quite a bit afterward. If you like medium rare, but lean towards rare with other types of steaks, I'd recommend taking it out a couple of minutes before that point (120-122F) to be safe. The sauce really saved the dish that would have otherwise been a bit bland for me (I'm of course comparing the tenderloin with some of my other favourite cuts of beef - ribeye, etc.) I paired it with mashed potatoes (gravy..) and grilled asparagus. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Great little dish. Very easy for entertaining larger parties. The sauce takes a bit more time than quoted - about 35-45 minutes to reduce down. I think the problem many people are facing might be due to the lack of collagen in their broth. I used some marrow bones, so it thickened up quite nicely. Without doing it from scratch and without marrow, I can see the sauce being a bit watery. I also added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce, because I like the earthiness of the 'shrooms.

this was absolutely amazing and the best red meat dish i have ever made. i was nervous to make it for christmas eve since i had never made a beef tenderloin before, but i followed the recipe exactly (including salting the beef 36 hours in advance) and it turned out absolutely perfect. my husband and i kept raving over it and saying it tasted like something from a restaurant (a good restaurant!). the only thing i forgot to do was strain the sauce before pouring it.. but that only affects presentation, not flavor. i did splurge on an expensive piece of meat from the best butcher in town but it was so worth it... i will ABSOLUTELY make this again.

I have made this roast four times in as many months. You can get one for a great price and trim and tie it yourself or have your local store or butcher do it for a bit more. Angus rules if you can get it. I have done this with Port sauce, Madeira sauce, Mushroom sauce and no sauce at all. I found that pulling at 130 degrees to rest works out well. Perfection! I do rub it with oil then brown it in a pan before roasting. An addition of fresh pepper, thyme, or garlic works well. This dry aging method is the way to go.

This has become my "go to" method for preparing roast beef tenderloin. I was skeptical the first time I tried the dry brining, but am a confirmed believer now. Using a convection roast oven setting, it has a beautiful crust outside and moist, fork-tender rare to medicum rare interior. Unbelievable!

This beef ternderloin was awesome. A super big hit at Xmas Day dinner. The brining really tenderized the beef. The beef part of the recipe was super easy - the sauce was more work. I doubled it for 8 people (and cooked a 7 lb tenderloin), and had very little leftovers. Looking forward to having it again.

Rating: 4
I'm a former vegetarian who has never made a roast before, let alone attempted tenderloin. In one word: AMAZING. I couldn't believe the flavor and tenderness for such little prep work (the butcher at the farmer's market did the trimming & tying for me). The meat required no knife, and was literally falling apart as we cut it. Deliciously med-rare, and fed 8 people with still enough leftovers for four delicious sandwiches.

Rating: 4
I literally had phone calls the day after Christmas raving about the meat and sauce. Tips: I doubled the port sauce ingredients, only exception was I used 6 cups of stock made from Better than Bullion in place of homemade. Sauce took 40 minutes to reduce and reach desired consistency, and came out to under 2 cups! Bought a 7 lb full tenderloin and trimmed it up after watching online videos and saved $40 on meat! Cut trimmed tenderloin in half (I know, a sin) because some like med rare and others medium-medium well. Rested for 30 min. Off the chart good. Would give it 10 forks if I could!

This was the best Christmas dinner I've had in a long time. The sauce was amazing. It did take quite a while to reduce, so allow time for this. If you choose to use a storebought beef stock, make sure it's good quality--run of the mill canned stuff won't do.

In response to the person who asked how much beef stock to use, I had the same question. Figuring that when the recipe was first printed, someone had to have asked the question, I went to page 15 of the reviews. The answer is 3 to 4 cups.

I have made this for Christmas day for the last 2 years and always a big hit. One addition is that I add mushrooms to the sauce...portobello, shitakke and white...all sliced very thin.

This was my first time cooking a beef tenderloin. I served it at Christmas Dinner for 12. I had a 6lb tenderloin and there were NO leftovers. I think that speaks for itself! I had a thermometer in it while cooking and took it out at 140. Perfectly done with a little pink. It did take an hour - but I had a larger piece of beef. I made both the port sauce as well as a horseradish sauce from this site. My guests all preferred the horseradish sauce and it was 10x easier to make. The port sauce was ok but nothing fantastic. This tenderloin was requested again for next Christmas!

Wonderful recipe! I only brined for a few hours and yet it was excellent. (Hard to go wrong with tenderloin). The au jus had excellent flavor, I added a little flour to the onion before the liquid just to give it some substance, don't want it to be gravy. The thinner the juice, the harder to keep warm at the table. I also sauteed some shiitakes and criminis and put in separate serving bowl. Very tasty!

Perhaps the quality of my tenderloin was not great, but this came out dry even though we served it medium rare. I think the salt gave the meat an odd briny flavour as well. I was also disappointed in the sauce which was too watery even though I reduced it to the proportions indicated and whisked in the butter etc. Worst bit was that I also made the effort of preparing the homemade stock and spent hours in anticipation of a fantastic sauce! There is another recipe on this site called "Rib Eye Steaks in Red Wine Sauce" which makes a very quick deglazed wine sauce which I will go back to...

This was awesome, initially is seemed as if it would be time consuming, but it proved me wrong. By preparing the tenderloin the day prior then making the sauce the next day, I had a easy and elegant after work treat for my family that made great sandwiches that weekend - the sauce filled the kitchen with a wonderful aroma. I would definately make again.

This is a fabulous dish. As many have commented before me, this is now my top rated beef dish. The flavor of the beef is exquisite. I followed the recipe with the exception of putting the beef into a hot (425 deg) oven for the first 15 minutes then decreased the temperature to 375 for the balance of time (as was suggested by another reviewer). My guests liked their beef more well done so I ended up having to convect roast for an additional 30 minutes. Then I tented for 30 minutes. I believe that is key to ensure the juices stay in the roast. Even though it was on the well done side, my guests were cutting it with their forks. One additional note... I will definitely make more of the sauce. It was delicious--a lovely smooth sauce with complex flavors.

This was absolutely phenomenal. This was the first time making a beef tenderloin, and I have to say I was a bit nervous about "experimenting" on such an expensive piece of beef. This was very easy to make, I followed the recipe as written, with the added step of searing the beef in a frying pan just before putting it in the oven. I cooked until it was about 140 degrees and it was a perfect medium to medium-rare, with just enough well done on the ends for my brother in law. :) Honestly, everyone at the table couldn't stop saying how good it was, and one of my guests went as far to say that it was *the* best meat he's ever eaten. What a success! I could not be happier and will be making this for years to come. I truly believe the salting made a huge difference. I served it with roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary and a salad with roasted beets, julienned apples and crumbled goat cheese. Delicous!

This recipe was a complete success! I dry brined for 24 hours and cooked the tenderloin until it was 125'F for a perfect medium rare in the centre. I added sugar to the sauce and used a mixture of concord maneshevitz and marsala instead of the port and the sauce was so good we used it on the quinoa we made to go with it.

Awesome. I made a 5.5# roast for a bunch of well-done eaters. I cooked it until a little over 160 and let it rest for 15 mins. Everyone raved. It was totally well done and tender as butter. People asked what I had done. I didn't feel as though I wasted an expensive piece of meat by cooking it so long; it was tender and flavorful. At first I thought the thin sauce was disappointing (even after adding corn starch), but when we ate it, we didn't want anything heavier than an au jus to overpower the fantastic beef. I only aged for 24hrs - next time I'm going for 36!

Dry-brining the meat is a must and produces outstanding results. I used more salt than the recipe recommended. (I just lightly but evenly salted the entire surface of the meat.) Will definitely be using this technique again in the future.

I've made this for Christmas both in '08 and in '09. As others suggested, I seared it on all sides in the roasting pan to brown it first. I roasted it at 425 for the entire time, until it was about 130 degrees (maybe a bit more) at thickest part. The sauce was also good. I used the pan drippings for gravy, adding the port wine stock (which I'd made with a meaty beef shank bone)and some add'l water (used Wondra for thickening). Approx. 5# roast is plenty for 5-6 people and still gives generous leftovers. One note to self for next year -- use a bit less kosher salt for brining. I think the brining really improves the meat's texture/flavor, but I got a bit aggressive with quantity this year, and it tasted a bit salty, esp. on the outside and end bits.

Rating: 4
Awesome. I didn't change a thing other than cooking a tad longer for my wife who won't eat it medium rare. Don't be afraid to double the sauce as it is delicious and once your guests try it they may want more! I only had about 12-ish hours of pre-salting, but the results were still awesome. I did not make the stock from scratch but I used Better than Bouillon which I use all the time and which is a great product.

This was easy and delicious. I started 2 days ahead, salting the beef and making the stock. Cooked the port sauce the next day, for a couple of hours. Preparation on Christmas day was easy and meat and sauce were delicious, I didn't feel it needed to be thikened. Served with White cheddar potatoes augratin and brussels sprout hash. No more prime rib for me!

Unfortunately I overcooked the beef - took it out at 145 rose to 151 which was perfect for my British guests. The saving grace was the sauce. I doubled the sauce ingr. added all the homemade beef stock and simmered it for over an hour. It was wonderful. I could have just drunk the sauce. Also, next time I think I'll let the meat rest for more than 15 minutes. Too much juice was wasted.

This is a really great, foolproof recipe for a huge cut of beef. I used a 6# tenderloin and roasted in my convection oven. Had to leave it in about 40 mins for rare. The brining is a must and produced an excellent crust. The sauce really wasn't worth the work. Took forever to reduce and the flavor was just OK. I will definately make again but will forego the sauce!

Great and easy -- I used a 3.3 pound tenderloin and halved the sauce recipe. Baking time still about 40 minutes. I made the sauce a day ahead, which worked out perfectly. However, it does not get thick and I added about 1 tsp. constarch mixed with 1 tsp water as it simmered for about 1 minute to give it a slightly thicker consistency then swirled in the butter. Everyone loved the sauce.

Made this for Christmas dinner 2009. Turned out wonderful!! Had a 5.0lb tenderloin. Trimmed off quite a bit. Cooked at 450 degrees for first 15 minutes, then at 375 degrees for about 25 more minutes. Internal temp was 145 when I took it out. Let it rest for about 30 minutes. I did cover with foil after the first 15 minutes. It was GREAT!!! Could not ask for a better piece of meat. It was perfectly cooked to medium. Also, I followed another review and added 1 TBS of cornstarch to 1TBS of butter and added to the sauce to thicken just before serving, and it turned out fantastic! Everyone LOVED it! Made it with Dijon roasted potatoes and green bean casserole. Going to be making this over and over!!!

Delicious....a great little xmas dinner for two. Used only a third of the whole beef tenderloin (center cut) and froze remainder. Beef was extremely tender. Marinated for 2 days in olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme and pepper. Spent about an hour making the reduction / sauce before even putting meat in oven. Doubled amount of shallots, added duck fat, used cognac and tawny port and boxed beef stock (was just fine) finished with more butter. Convection roasted at 500 for about 10 minutes and then reduced to 200 for remainder until meat thermometer read 110. Then let sit another 15 minutes for a perfect rare to medium rare. Got 5 thick pieces from this smaller cut. The sauce is also divine on top of the mashed potatoes we served alongside.

This is the 3rd time I've made this wonderful recipe and it's the only way I'll ever make roast tenderloin again. Everyone whom I have served it to raves about it! I always make the port sauce too, but it really must be simmered much, much longer than the instructions call for. This time, I whisked in 4 T. butter and about 1/8 cup heavy cream at the very end. It was sublime! Lastly, this time I carmelized shallots, then added sliced baby bella mushrooms, another 2 or 3 Tablespoons butter, about 1/2 cup of the beef stock, salt and pepper and a couple dashes of worcheshire sauce. I cooked them down until the liquid was almost evaporated, and served it over the sliced beef. Scrumptious!!!!!

awesome!! definately salt the beef in advance. it looks a little knarly after 30 hrs in the fridge but very good! make sure if you are spending the $$$ on this cut of meat that you don't overcook it. a couple of things, i seared the tenderloin in the roasting pan prior to putting in the oven. second, i like my sauce a little thicker and after reading some of the other reviews i combined 1 tbsp of softened butter and 1 tbsp of flour and then wisked that into the sauce at the end. perfect consistency.

I made this with grass fed beef and sea salt. I used just slightly less sea salt than what was called for in the recipe (more like 1.5 teaspoons). It was delicious - cooked perfectly. I found the sauce to be a little lacking - a bit sweet and thin, even though I cooked it down for an additional 1/2 hr or so longer than the recipe called for. Overall, the salting is a technique I will use again and again.

I made this for Christmas last year for 16 people using two tenderloins. I was scared to put the salt on, but followed the recipe and it was fantastic!!!! The port sauce was quite good and people went back for 2nds and 3rds. I made the horseradish mashed potatoes and they went beautifully. We served a Bordeaux - excellent. I will be doing this again this year! -Oh, and it's quick and easy. The port sauce I made the day before and finished it up the day of. It does take a bit longer to reduce so plan ahead.

made this for company, salting the meat definitely a plus, great flavor and nice crust to the meat. I cooked a 5+lb roast and cooking time was about 80 mins. Sauce very simple and did not take all day, make the homemade broth if you have time, gave the sauce a great french country flavor.

Made this dish over the weekend for guests. It was fantastic! I left it in a little longer until medium (we prefer a little less pink). Everyone enjoyed it very well. Didn't try the sauce, meat was perfect on it's own. Next time I will make the sauce. Definately going into my recipe book.

Maybe it was the very expensive cut of meat, but this turned out very well. I agree with everyone else: must brine. Imperative for the dish. I also agree with other reviewers that the sauce is pretty thin and I thickened it prior to serving. Aside from that, this is a simple, straightforward dish that will produce good results. I left mine in the oven for a few minutes longer because it was not reaching the right temperature in the allotted time. Delish.

Everyone was right -- this is an amazing recipe. Simple, elegant and a real wow. I auctioned off a dinner at my house for my favorite charity and wanted it to be very special. I followed a lot of the suggestions: bought the meat at Costco, tied it myself, seared it before hand, got a high end beef stock and simmered the stock longer than 20 min. to reduce it. Wow. The guests are still raving.

Great recipe, absolutely loved this. Been playing with some variations on it as well, but careful if you decide to dry brine with different salts. If you don't use the one specified in the recipe, you may get surprised. A Chardonnay cask smoked fleur de sel works very well if done for a shorter period of time - about 12 hours. A fine grained salt *not* be used. The sauce is phenomenal, but requires care and attention. If your experienced with sauces, go hard. If it's a first time, give it a trial run. Definitely adding this one to my own repertoire. Beautiful dish, my wife and her friends loved it.

Am I wrong here? Isn't it the diameter of the tenderloin that drives the cooking time rather than the total weight. A 3" diameter piece should take the same time whether it's 8 pounds or 3. It IS a great dinner for important company and/or spouses, but we don't want to overcook it.

I figured all the positive reviews couldn't be wrong - and they weren't! Served a dinner party of ten and it had rave reviews. The reduction was fantastic and the simplicity of the beef paired with the sauce was a winner. This will be a go to in the future.

We served this for New Year's Eve dinner to our Supper Club, and would highly recommend it. Must start preparation at least 24 hours in advance, as the beef and sauce get better with time. Garnish the plate with sprigs of rosemary to enhance presentation.

This is a follow up from my review last year 12/20/07. This year I made this recipe for a NYE dinner party and it was FANTASTIC! I roasted the meat at 425 for 20 minutes and then turned the oven down to 350 to finish cooking. It took a little more than an hour and I had about 10 lbs of tenderloin. I used a temperature probe and roasted until it registered 145 degrees and it was a perfect medium. Pink and juicy and not too bloody. There were some more well done pieces on the small ends. I purchased my beef tenderloin from Costco --a great price at $10/lb but did find it needed a great deal of trimming. I took off about 2 lbs. in trimmings. Also, about the port sauce, it does take awhile to reduce down (45-1 hour) and it didn't quite thicken too much... still a bit runny. But none the less, delicious!

Wow. This recipe was a winner. I cooked for 22 people so more than doubled it and have gotten rave reviews. Several of the people are extremely, extremely picky eaters and they loved the meat and the sauce. This is definitely a keeper.

Rating: 2
After all the rave reviews I was really disappointed with this recipe. Despite efforts to thicken the sauce it was simply too juicy, and although it was tasty, it didn't wow me. I also found that the brining made the meat quite salty. I used rib eye roast and overall the meat was tasty but this wasn't a keeper for me.

I made this recipe for our last two Christmas dinners - I have to say - I used a smaller cut 3.5 pounds (than last time) and the beef was fork tender. I wasn't too happy with the sauce last time (thought it too thin) so I added a beef gray mix by Knorr and everyone raved about the meal. (Sauce looked real pretty.) I followed all to the letter less adding the gravy mix to the port sauce - I also baked the meat about 40 to 45 minutes when the meat thermometer was inserted in the thickest part read 150 degrees - it was still pink enough for my guest who like their meat rare. It's a tradition in my house from here going forward.

Made this for Christmas and it was excellent! Of course it helps to buy top quality beef from a good butcher. I substituted a high quality beef base for the homemade stock. I made the sauce ahead and rewarmed it when the meat was done. I also sauteed up a mushroom mixture with more port and cognac and served it on top. This was the easiest gourmet Christmas entree I have ever made and beats out most of the others I have made on taste also.

I made this for Christmas Dinner and everyone enjoyed it. The dry brine really adds flavor to the beef. I roasted to an internal temp of 125, which continues to cook during the resting time - resulting in a nice medium rare. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth perfect. The sauce was a nice compliment. Great recipe!

This is the perfect holiday roast. You brine 1 1/2 days prior (do not cover in the refrig)and make the port sauce the day before. It can't be easier for something that is this tender and yummy. A HUGE hit with our family. I served it with horseradish au gratin potatoes and the flavors compliment one another. NOTE: I did not make the beef stock from scratch. I purchased two cartons of organic broth, sauted onions first, then added stock and rosemary spring and broth and let it simmer down.

I wasn't able to try the brining process due to time constraints -- it sounds wonderful. I'm eager to try that next time. And yes, there will be a next time. The Port sauce is FANTASTIC. All my guests loved it! My roast took longer to cook even though it was only 3.5 pounds. I needed 40 minutes at 425 - and even then much of the roast was way too rare, even for those of us who love rare meat. I had to pop several slices under the broiler for a few minutes...

My guests ate every bite. I was nervous about the brining process but the flavor and tenderness of the beef was perfect. The port sauce was a nice compliment to the beef. Will definitely make this again.

I did not make the sauce but did dry brine/salt the meat. As a method of seasoning, it was wonderful! After salting overnight, I covered the the tenderloin in 2-3 Tbls unsalted butter and some pepper. Roasted at 500* for 20 minutes, let rest tightly covered with foil for 20 minutes more (for rare) then sliced. Moist, flavourful and delicious. Next time I think I might even try the sauce! :)

This recipe was very tasty and the sauce was easy to make a a major hit with my company. I didn't have brandy or cognac so I substituted Jamison's Irish whiskey and it worked fine. And yes I had to simmer longer to achieve the reduction noted in the recipe. Would definitely make again.

Wonderful - and easy. This will be my go-to recipe for company beef. It was so tender you didn't need a knife, and was a pretty foolproof approach to an expensive cut of meat. We loved the sauce. Used Emeril's beef stock and good tawny port, and simmered longer than called for - but otherwise followed the recipe. I would never add thickener. It is so flavorful, elegant and a great compliment to the meat. Made it the day before and reheated it, which was much easier than making gravy out of pan juices at serving time. We made the mashed potatoes with caramelized shallots described on this site, which was great with the sauce too. My husband cooked the tenderloins outside on the gas grill. We used two 4.5 lb tenderloins from Costco for 15 people, and had almost no leftovers. I smashed juniper berries along with the pepper, but don't think it really added anything in terms of flavor - although I can imagine it would be fun to experiment with different flavors in the rub. But why monkey with a good thing. I will probably just make it as described.

This was wonderful - and easy. The sauce was great. I simmered it longer than the recipe called for. Made it the day before and re-heated it while the mashed potatoes were cooking (used the shallot mashed potato recipe on this site). Used Emeril stock and a good quality port. I loved the thinner consistency - as compared to a gravy, this was elegant, flavorful but subtle pairing with the beef. Will definitely do again. For the meat, I used two 4.5lb. tenderloins from Costco to serve 15 and there was little left over. So tender you didn't need a knife. Husband cooked them outside on the gas grill. I added crushed juniper berries to the crushed pepper, but don't think I really tasted them. All in all, this will be my go-to recipe for a truly elegant beef presentation.

The best beef tenderloin that I have ever had! It got rave reviews for Christmas Eve dinner. I did not tie it because I cut off the small end of the loin (did not need that much). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce is wonderful, and the flavor of the meat is outstanding!

Outstanding - have made it twice and both times a COMPLETE success. Just make sure you have COARSE Kosher Salt not just Kosher Salt - it makes a big difference. To the previous reviewer, put the salted roast in the refrig UNcovered - no plastic or anything. Regarding the sauce, a number of reviewers have said it is on the runnier side which it is, but it blends beautifully with the meat juices!

This is such an EASY recipe- I highly suggest it to anyone entertaining- especially if you have your hands full doing other things. I made the sauce a day ahead and it made my life so much easier! Everyone raved- the outside of my tenderloin browned up nicely- but I found that the dry brine was VERY important in order for this take place. I salted mine 36 hours prior to roasting. Everyone loved it- there were no leftovers- I'm making it again for Christmas!

I've made this twice, and it got rave reviews from family and guests both times. The recipe is very easy and foolproof! Both times I started the roasting with 5 minutes at 475, then lowered the temp to 400 for the rest of the time. This resulted in a delicious crust and the meat was still medium rare in the middle, with some medium at the ends for those who don't like it so red. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Thanks to everyone who used the exact ingredients to make this dish. I can't see how you can review a recipe if you did not even use the correct main ingredients. It just doesn't make sense to me. Thanks for the tips on the broth and searing. I can't find demi-glace here, so I will use organic beef broth.

Even with the dry brining I did not get a browning. The roast took twice as long to cook and the 125 temp was not an indicator that worked; it was way too rare to eat at that temp. The port sauce was delicious.

Tying it keeps its shape and the slices are uniform. Three ties is enough. I made it to practice for Christmas and it is good, I think though that I will do what a previous cook said and sear it in the pan before putting it in the oven, as it did not have a crust on the outside. While it was good, it will be better with a crust and will be more appealing looking too. Two days I plan on keeping my in the fridge.

I fixed this beef tenderloin for a group of 15. I purchased my meat at Costco and tied it myself. It was fabulous, a definite repeat for another dinner party! Everyone raved about the meat and the sauce. I also thickened the sauce before I served it. I had a 7.5 lb. roast and cooked it about 1 hour, then tented and it was perfect. I did triple the sauce and it was outstanding. I used tawny Port and Wolfgang Puck beef stock.

In answer to the questions about how much beef stock to add to the sauce...according to the recipe, the beef stock recipe makes 3 to 4 cups. The sauce recipe indicates you should "all of the beef stock..." When I made it last year, there was about 3 cups of stock, and I added all of it to the sauce.

Rating: 3
The sauce is so simple and wonderful! The homemade stock makes the difference between good and divine - well worth the time. I recommend adding a few marrow bones for an extra rich flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the roasting method. I followed all instructions, but after 30 min in the oven, the outside of my roast had no crust at all. Next time I will first pan-sear the roast in a heavy skillet and then transfer to a 375 degree oven and cook to 120 degrees. I am also considering trying the sauce with a standing rib roast.

I am the one who asked about making it the day before - no need to. This is the most amazing beef dish I have ever had for, taste, ease of prep, presentation you name it. And, I am not much of a beef eater but I couldn`t stop eating this one. Okay, brine up to two days is fine, that is what I did. I left it out of the fridge 3 hours sitting on the counter in a cool kitchen. I cooked it a bit longer as I do not care for rare - to 140 degrees and it was still very red. The port sauce while good, was a little too sweet for me, perhaps I will use a different port next time. I waited 20 minutes to slice into 1/2 inch slices and it was still very warm. You could not get anything as easy and as elegant as this dish. Mind you it is pricey, but because it is quite rich (all meat no fat) a little goes a long way. Costco is your best bet and the fact that our local culinary school purchases their meat from Costco says something. If you are buying from Costco, purchase the one that is trimmed and all the same thickness, it is shorter in length. Dry aging and salting are the key to the flavor.

I made this dish for Christmas last year and everyone loved it. As far as cooking the meat goes, there could not be an easier preparation. Virtually idiot proof! I did make the sauce twice. I felt the first time it was too peppery, but I'm a perfectionist when it comes to that stuff. I'll be making it again this year and the fact that this dish is so easy to make gives you the opportunity to get more creative with your side dishes.

If you are reading this and you have made this dish before maybe you can answer my question: I want no hassle on Xmas Day so, could this dish be prepared the day before and sliced when cold then put in the gravy to heat up the next day. I don`t want to mess up this expensive cut. Anyone?

I made this last night for guests and it was fabulous! I cooked it until my meat thermometer read 120 degrees, removed from oven, tented with foil, and the temp rose to 140. Perfectly done! The ends provided enough medium for those who like it more done. The sauce was divine- used 3 1/2 cups purchased beef stock. Mixed half a cup with a little cornstarch and added it at the end to thicken sauce.

I gave this four stars, although it didn't come out wonderful. However, this was mostly due to my choice of meat. I used a cheaper rump roast and the difficulty in chewing through the tough meat made it hard to appreciate this recipe. I will definitely make this again but with a better cut of meat next time.

I also used a rump roast to save cost. And a bit of flour to thicken the sauce as advised by a reviewer. Everything came out great. The sauce is delicious and the recipe simple to make. Will definitely make it again and often. Everyone liked it so far, can't wait to have my girlfriend try it.

I made this for my husband's birthday. It was wonderful. Very tender and juicy meat even though I only started the salt rub about 6 hrs before we cooked it. The sauce was excellent...I did add 1 tbsp of basalmic vinegar when I was reheating it, but otherwise followed the recipe as given.

This recipe is delicious. I made it for my beau and he had two servings and then took the rest home! It was very easy to make and the dry brining made all the difference. Since it was only the two of us, I cooked a 1.5 lb cut and it took less than an hour. I definitely will make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit for all ages. I used a rump roast instead of tenderloin to save cost. I made around 9lbs and made the same amount of sauce and there was lots left. The sauce is very flavorful without being rich in any way. For the rump roast, I still brined the meat, but then cooked on low temp for 3 hours, then cranked up the broiler to crust the exterior for about 30 minutes each side.

I made this for my dinner club for a Valentine's dinner and it was simple and delicious (if you make the sauce in advance)! For the stock, I used a small veal/beef demi glaze and Whole Foods purchased beef stock. I would recommend doubling the sauce, and freezing in small amounts, for future roasts.

This is fantastic! I ordered a tenderloin of more than 5 lbs. for Christmas dinner and did the brining. Then the day before 5 of our guests announced they couldn't come. I cut off half the roast and sliced them into individual steaks and froze them for later use. They are by far the best tenderloins ever -- incredibly tender and flavorful. While I love the roast itself, the steaks are even better. I agree about the sauce being thin. It has a great flavor and aroma but does need some thickening.

This is delicious! I let the meat brine for 22 hours and stuffed the tenderloin with pan roasted sliced garlic for the last eight hours. Roasting the garlic mellows its flavor. (roast the whole cloves with the skin on in a dry pan over medium-high heat until dark spots appear. Skin and slice, removing any burnt spots). Also, to mellow and enrich the flavor of the rub, I combined the cracked pepper and oil and simmered it over medium-low heat until the pepper was aromatic (6-10 mins) and then rubbed it over the meat. I used 3TBS of pepper and 3TBS of oil for abut 4.5 lbs of meat. For the sauce I used 3 1/2 cups of Kithcen Basics boxed beef stock (not broth) and the sauce turned out great, although the sauce took about an hour to reduce and the cognac took about 4-5 minutes to evaporate. The meat was tender and delicious. I served with roast broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and smashed red potatoes, accompanied by 2002 BV Tapestry and 2001 Robert Craig Mt. Veeder Cab. The meal was a runaway hit!

This was wonderful. I used a 1.3 lb. piece of tenderloin. I rubbed it with salt and let it sit for 2 hours, then rinsed it off before rubbing with oil and pepper. I agree with a lot of people that have said the sauce is too thin, even though it is too thin, it was delicious and smelled fantastic. I will be making this again definitely, I will probably try to thicken the sauce with a little flour.

OMG! This was amazing! I don't usually feel that way about red meat, but this was extremely tender and absolutely beautiful. I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!

I know that a lot of people rated this recipe, but I just want to add how good and easy it is. i served it for our New Year dinner and it was a hit. The meat could not have been more tender. I made the sauce with purchased beef broth (Wolgang Puck broths are very good) and I reduced it for almost one hour and it was extremely good. The quality of the Port is also very important here. I could not believe how easy it was to prepare. The brining makes the meat even more tender and flavourful.

The tenderloin turned out very well, but there is no way that 4 lbs will feed ten people! You will need at least 5 lbs. We were not thrilled by the port sauce; what do we do with the second 2 tbsp of butter? I served the beef with mustard-roasted potatoes and green beans with sage and pancetta for New Years Eve, and everyone loved it.

I had a 7 pound tenderloin roast - made the sauce ahead of time. I found the sauce to be very good though perhaps I would like liked to thicken it. The port I used was unfiltered and left a residue in the bottom of my sauce pan. I also doubled the recipe, used canned beef broth (low sodium) due to the size of the meat. The beef was a little more on the rare side for some of my guest at Christmas but like other's I cooked it a little longer at 375 - Overall a very good presentation. The salt process was really a plus and the only thing I had to do was bake the meat & warm the sauce to accompany the rest of the meal.

This was fantastic!! The meat was soooo tender it was unbelievable. I did have to tweak the sauce a little. I added a little more congac and used Organic Beef broth. For cooking the roast, I had an 8 pound tenderloin, started it at 425 for 20 minutes, then lowered the temp to 375 and cooked for 50 minutes. I trusted my meat thermometer and it was right on.

I am right there with you dwsnyder! I followed the recipe - even the scary brining thing - with much success.

Filet roast turned out great, but you could take it out at 25 minute rather than 30. Port reduction did not work for me. The beef broth was not flavorful, and did not reduce even after 3 hours. It left the sauce runny when I added 3 cups of broth. I would not recommend the sauce. I'd suggest just reducing a bottle of port wine and adding some cream and butter at the end of reduction.

Looks like a lot of people have made this in the last few days ! I made this last night (Christmas 2007) and was delighted with the results (as were the other 9 folks at dinner). I used a perfectly trimmed six pound tenderloin. 'Brined' it for about 30 hours and roasted it for 42 minutes. jamiephil - Don't even think about cooking this beautiful piece of meat for 30 minutes/pound ! Mine would have taken 3 hours !!!. If you need to think in terms of minutes per pound think more like between 6 and 8 minutes per pound. Served it with the sauce (it does take longer than 20 minutes but worth every second !), rosemary/garlic mashed potatoes, onion port marmalade (from Gourmet, October 2007), green beans w/slivered almonds, home-made rolls, and the chocolate-whiskey truffles souffles (from Bon Appetite - September 1997 used Chambord instead of whiskey and skipped the caramel sauce). Great dinner. This recipe is definitley a 'keeper' !

I made this last night and was very happy with the results. I used a 6lb organic tenderloin which was beautifully trimmed by a great butcher. In addition to salting it for about 30 hours, I rubbed some chopped garlic all over the meat and left on for approx 8 hours before cooking. Make sure you remove as much of the garlic before putting it in the oven or it can become quite bitter. There was so little fat in the meat and the juices were so well contained inside that the roasting pas was smoking every few minutes that a drop hit the botttom (lot of smoke in the oven - good fan though). Would adding some water to the bottom of the pan affect the meat (i.e. steam??) In any case, a great simple recipe

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was spectacular! I made the recipe precisely as provided. As others have noted, the port sauce definitely takes far longer than 20 minutes to reduce properly. Don't rush it...it takes around 45 minutes or so, but is well worth the time and effort. Everyone raved about the juiciness of the meat as well as the flavor. This one's a keeper!

To jamiephil... 30 min per pound or so. If you have a meat thermometer, use the temp in the recipe, to ensure the correct level of doneness. I've never tried the pre-salt (dry brine), so I can't offer much personal advice one way or the other on that. Good luck!

Does anyone know if the recipe should be cooked for 30 minutes total or 30 min/pound?? The directions on the meat I bought (I substituted a strip loin roast) said 30/pound... I wasn't should if the salt pre-cooked it a little or something?

I agree, this recipe is delicious. However I must comment on the roasting temperature of 425 for the entire cook time. I was pretty surprised that the recipe called for this high of temperature the entire time. Needless to say about 1/2 way through the cooking time, I opened the oven to have smoke billowing out and my smoke alarm going off in front of my guests. It was just TOO hot and some of the juices were beginning to smoke. I then adjusted the oven temperature down to 375 and cooked until medium rare. I would recommend putting the tenderloin in for 15-20 minutes at 425 to seal in the juices and then drop the temperature to 375 to avoid the embarrassment of "burning" such a beautiful piece of meat! (FYI - I was cooking in Roast Mode in a Bosch Range)

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was a huge success. Not only was the meal great, the "24 hours before" prep work meant that all I had to do was stick it in the oven the day of my dinner. On the question about beef stock, I also used beef stock from a can instead of making my own and it turned out fantastic. I did add some onions to the stock for a bit before adding the stock into the sauce. I saved the onions (and the other solids from the sauce) and used them as a base under the roast so that it wouldn't dry out in the oven.

This was a hit at my family holiday dinner! the sauce was easy and very good. I used boxed beef broth and it was fine.

This sauce is a keeper! Didn't have time for the whole tenderloin dry brine part so I used individual filets. Salted with coarse kosher salt & pepper & cooked in pan on the stove top. After preparing the sauce as directed (I found it took longer to reduce than 20 min., almost an hour, however I may have been using a smaller pan than recommended) after straining I added about a quarter cup heavy cream then used the sauce to deglaze the pan used to cook the steaks. DELICIOUS everyone licked their plates. I made the full amount of the sauce for 4 steaks & it wasn't too much.

Served the whole menu to guests last night. The meat was moist and flavorful. Rave reviews on everything-- potatoes, green beans and mushroom ragout. Dessert a little disappointing--needed more ginger, I think.

For those of us too lazy to make our own beef stock, should I just substitue 3-4 cups of canned? I know it won't be the same, but will be a "make or break" difference? Just wondering if there is anyone out there who used canned stock, and how much.

For those questioning the volume of the beef stock, click on the Simple Homemade BeefStock recipe link. It will make approximately 3-4 cups of beef stock, and if you scroll down to the preparation instruction for the sauce, it says to use all of the beef stock. I followed the recipe and it tasted good!

To answer the questions about the amount of beef stock, the linked Beef Stock recipe makes 3-4 cups so I would think that is the amount of stock the Sauce Recipe calls for.

Have a question! How much beef stock is one supposed to use? Unless I am blind; didn't see a measurement.

I made this yesterday and the whole family loved it. Instead of using an oven, I seared it over a very hot fire of lump coal and oak wood for just a minute or two per side. Then I cooked it with indirect heat in the covered grill for about an hour at 400f until it hit medium rare temperature. It was flavorable and the texture out of this world! The port sauce was perfectly paired with the meat and by that I mean it added to the dish, not covering it up or overwhelming it.
