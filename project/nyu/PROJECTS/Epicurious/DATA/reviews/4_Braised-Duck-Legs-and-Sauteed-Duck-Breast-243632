I made this last winter and loved it so much I bought 3 more ducks the next time I went to the supermarket. I'm making it again tomorrow. My husband didn't care for the parsnips but he doesn't know what's good (except maybe for me)so we won't listem to him. He ate everything else without complaint. It was well worth the time. Thank you.

My husband requested duck for dinner. I've never cooked duck so I came to this website for advice/recipes. This was awesome! I followed the recipe to the letter,I plan on making it again & again.

I made this meal for our Christmas dinner this year. I do like that it uses the entire duck and provides a variety of ways to prepare and present it. My variations were minor. Picking up on an idea from another reviewer, I did prepare the stock in my crock pot. It only took me 15 minutes or so to deconstruct the duck and get the ingredients into the crock pot before heading to work. The rest I did as the recipe directed (except I had forgotten to pick up ginger root at the store, so I used some ginger powder). I also made a port wine reduction to serve with the breast meat and added a potato rosti (another Epicurious.com recipe. I used the fat skimmed from the stock for this). The meal got rave reviews from my family and I would definitely make it again. It wasn't as difficult or time consuming as I originally thought from reading the recipe. Pre-prep, as the recipe notes discuss, are a definite plus!

For 2 people, this can make 2 dinners and soup for lunch. First dinner was braised duck legs w/carrots (subbed for parsnips) and mashed potatoes. Fabulous duck and carrots! Second dinner (made fresh 2 days later) was duck breast, asparagus and rice made w/duck broth. Although breasts were very good, I personally like the following breast recipe better; breasts are brushed w/lemon, honey and coriander - yummy! Duck Breasts with Coriander, Endive, and Sweet-and-Sour Orange Sauce (this web site). Forget the orange sauce and endive. This prep takes an overnight, but easy and worth it for flavor. I cut up the duck a day in advance so that ALL fat and carcass and vegetables could be put in crock pot overnight. If you are careful when cutting up duck, you can get 2 thighs, 2 legs, and 2 wing dings. Next day, strained broth discarding vegetables, saving any duck meat for soup. Chill broth til fat layer solidifies. Remove fat and save. It adds exceptional flavor when used for frying. Use broth for this recipe, added to rice, and/or for soup. Another cost and time saver: put clean vegetable discards such as carrot and potato peels, celery, garlic, parsley, green beans, zucchini and onion in a plastic bag in the freezer. When ready to make broth, just pull out and add to broth. Cook in crock pot overnight, strain and discard vegetables.

Made this for Christmas dinner. I concur with previous reviewers who raved about the duck breast and the parsnips. After the braising, the parsnips and broth are indeed velvety. I do not have similar praise for the duck legs. They were a bit chewy and bland. The wing meat had better flavor - perhaps they were more immersed in the broth? The breasts were fantastic, though. I'd make this again if I had a duck carcass from which to make the broth, and the breast of the duck. Or maybe find another use for the limbs altogether. Would give 3.5 stars if it were an option.

This took me an entire day to prepare but was entirely worth it! This dish made my husband fall in love with me all over again.

We made this for Easter Dinner. It takes every bit of 3 1/2 hours. We followed the directions, and it was served with roasted carrots with Balsamic vinegar. The parsnips were awesome. We will make this again. It is easy make and simply delicious. Everyone loved it, including my 11 year old and my 16 year old sons.

I like this recipe because it's simple enough, there's no dog and pony show with lots of fruit. Duck needs sweetness and earthyness, Bravo!

Outstanding! This was my first try at cooking duck and it was wonderful. The parsnips are excellent. I went by the book on this recipe and everything was perfect. The parsnips may be one of the best veggie dishes I have ever had. This recipe is going in the "keeper" pile.

Breast meat was perfect. The parsnips and a rice that I made with extra stock were wonderful. The limbs were okay. In the future I will reserve the legs for confit and make a sugo from the wings, cook the vegies in a little less broth and prepare the breasts exactly the same. One more note: I trimmed the breasts of additional fat leaving a nicely shaped skin and when sauted it crisped up very pleasingly. They are wonderful and the best thing about this recipe.

My first piece of advice: if you're not practiced at chopping up birds, ask your butcher to do the work for you (or watch a how-to video before you head for your knives). Other than my ducks breasts looking slightly mangled, this recipe was fantastic in every respect. The parsnips were positively to die for. I never thought I would say that about parsnips, and to be honest I think the duck stock had a lot to do with it, but to die for all the same. I did forget to add the lemon juice, so when I took the legs out of the oven I just squeezed some lemon in a stirred it around. This was a real treat; I can't wait to make it again!

This was excellent! The braised meat was tender and the breast crispy. I'd suggest rendering the fat and crisping up the skin on the latter a little longer than recommended. Just do it until the skin is very crisp. And I used high heat on the other side to sear the meat side of the breast. I'd also suggest reducing a few cups of the braising liquid down to 2 tbsps or so with which you could sauce the breast, since it's otherwise unflavored.

I made this as part of a total duck meal. I had duck breasts, a whole duck and prepared duck confit. The directions for cutting up the duck were great and since we had extra duck breasts, we braised the breasts as well. It was wonderful!
