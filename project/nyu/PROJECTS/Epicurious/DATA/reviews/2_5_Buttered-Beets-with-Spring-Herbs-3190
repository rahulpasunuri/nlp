A good, basic beet recipe. The fresh herbs enliven the dish.

The fresh herbs make this beet recipe a keeper. I only cooked 1/3rd of the beets called for in the recipe, but used the called for amounts of all of the rest of the ingredients. The beets were excellent. I also cooked the greens by cutting them into half to one inch pieces and cutting the stems into one to two inch pieces. I used about two tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, added a teaspoon of freshly chopped ginger and sauted them for about 10 minutes, stirring often until tender. No leftovers.
