These smell like they should be good... but they're not. These are right up there with cocktail weenies and cheese in a can. Just gross.

I love this recipe, and it seems totally open to some creative alterations. I used some sort of Gruyere in one layer and another goat milk cheese in another instead of cheddar, and one of the layers was a thin spread of onion confit. I did bake them for longer than the recipe called for, and they were not overdone. I could tell that undercooking would lead to the sogginess others have noted.

My 9 yr old son loves these and asks to make them with me whenever we are having family friends over. Instead of the separate thyme and sage, I use the bottled Italian Seasoning along with the pepper.

For those who complained that it lacked something, it did! The original published recipe used more cheese, coated the final roll out with egg wash and sprinkled it lightly with coarse salt just before baking. We have made this several times as an hors d'oeuvre.

Guess I'll be the voice of dissent, but these did absolutely nothing for me or my guests. I used really good aged white cheddar and while they looked pretty, they were in dire need of something else. Also, too much sage in my opinion. They were almost bitter. I made them to go with the chowder, which was great, and received rave reviews, but no one wanted more of these. I won't be making these again.

I know others didn't like this but I'm not a baker and I managed to do this pretty well. There were delicious and I will make them again.

Mine were a disaster - the cheese melted out of the sticks and stuck them hopelessly to the waxed paper I used. I'm sure it is partially my fault. Even the ones I salvaged, though, tasted stale by the next day. Not worth the trouble - I'm deleting this one from my recipe box.

These were pretty tasty. When I realized I did not have dried sage, I substituted dried rosemary. Agree with other reviewers that these do start to soften not long after making them. I would reccomend serving shortly after removing from oven.

Delicious. A bit time intensive to make but definitely worth it. The flavor and texture were delicious. Served with the salad course.

These were a little harder to prepare than I thought (I'm not good with rolling out dough) and they must be eaten the same day or they get soft. With that said, I would make them again because they were tasty and guests loved them.

Mmm! These are delicious! And very easy. In fact, I can't think of an easier recipe except for cheez whiz on a triscuit.

Good recipe. I added about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the recipe and the flavor was great. Rave reviews from guests. My first time working with puff pastry and it was pretty simple. The only difficulty was twisting the sticks and trying to get them to stay twisted. After twisting them, I froze them. Baked at 425 for 10 minutes later and they turned out fine.

These took longer to make then I thought - but were very good. They taste better when eaten the same day.

I thought these were easy and turned out great. While I was twisting them, I thought they weren't going to turn out or look anything like the photo (in the mag), but they turned out terrific. Of course I added a little extra cheddar. Nummy!

Unlike the cook from NY, we loved this and it was dead easy. Took less than 10 minutes to make and produced long lovely crispy and delicious cheeze twists that were gone in minutes. Had to make another batch to go with the Lobster/Corn Chowder for Xmas dinner. Don't know what happened to my friend in NY but this was flawless in Toronto and three batches this week have disappeared in minutes among a great pile of gourmet eaters! We'll be making lots more of this one.
