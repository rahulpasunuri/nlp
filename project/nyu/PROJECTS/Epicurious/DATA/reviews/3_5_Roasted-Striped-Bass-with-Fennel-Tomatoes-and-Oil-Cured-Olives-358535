Loved this. Added some thinly sliced potatoes and carrots and used Spigola fish instead (3 small ones).

I dont usually make striped bass, but wanted to try something new. I did a loose interpretation of this recipe, and it was wonderful. I basically used whatever vegetables I had in the house that would lend themselves to roasting brussel sprouts, red cabbage, heirloom tomatoes, and red onions. I roasted them at 400 for about 20 minutes. I then pan fried the fish as per the recipe, then added the olives, then placed it on top of the roast veggies for another 10 minutes. Not only was it fabulous, it was beautiful looking with a sprig of rosemary. I cant wait to make it for guests. So easy!

I made this dish with a large striper that we caught in Martha's Vineyard. I had to fillet the fish and cut into portions and then adjust the cooking time due to smaller pieces. Absolutely delicious. I will be making this again and again. I served it with a broiled garlic bread at the end which was a perfect vehicle for left over juices.

Great recipe. I used smaller pieces, put everything together at one time, and roasted at 400 for ~15 minutes.

Enjoy your dried-out fish!

Oh, how I like these smart aleks, who are slow on the uptake and write reviews without trying to cook it. You can get striped bass that is 1 1/2 Lb. You have to cook 4 pounds of fish with so many vegetables for 50 minutes. And if you don't like Italian style cooking, do not eat or even read the recipe, not talking to be so arrogant and write "smart" reviews.

I enjoy reading and trying out recipes cuz they provide new ideas than what i usually would combine 4a main ingredient. This recipe is refreshingly different than what i usually enjoy my striped bass with. Certainly the idea is elegant, i wouldn't cook any seafood 4that long of period of time, if marinated, seasoned already, whole fish is ALWAYS better than just its fillets in my findings, BBQing is sooo fun and yummy... don't leave the fire to burn'm obviously. Bon'!

I love striped bass, but this recipe is perplexing because stripers have to be 28 inches long in order to keep them--they have to be 36 inches for commercial fishermen! Where does one find a whole striped bass that weighs only a pound? Furthermore, striped bass are not at all easy to scale, so why not just fillet the fish and then back the skinless fillets like I did.
