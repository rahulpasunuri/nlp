I found this recipe while looking for ways to use chia seeds (and found this is the only one on epicurious!)... It's the first intentionally vegan pastry/dessert recipe that I have made (I have eaten vegan cakes before and more likely than not have made sweets that did not contain egg or dairy). Anyway, it was long ago that I found it and the ingredient list seemed intimidating, but today I decided to make it, having most things on hand and substituting others: I don't think the (organic) pastry flour I have is whole-wheat. For the rice syrup, I used a pre-blended organic rice-and-maple syrup (I scoffed at this before when I found it at my mother's house) and I replaced the erythritol with sucanat, a minimally-processed fair-trade organic sugar product, which I have not baked with before but decided by taste is not too sweet. When I melted it it did give off a molasses-y smell, which I like. To my dismay I found I only had half an orange, so I added the rind of a lime, and the juice of two limes (only had one lemon), and used some home-made "vanilla sugar" in place of the vanilla extract (cut some vanilla beans vertically and leave them in a jar with some sugar--mine was white--for a few months). Finally, I used coconut-flavoured almond milk (not unsweetened). The reviews for this recipe were incredibly unhelpful as they only gave one fork but only commented on the fact that this is apparently not a low-carb recipe (which I don't give the slightest about). I used the lesser amount of the milk, and the batter was a runny consistency. It fit perfectly into a 12-unit mini muffin pan and a 6-unit regular muffin pan. They came out perfectly and everyone (six of us) ate them up. The sweetness was low to my taste. My husband suggested adding raisins next time (which suggests there should be a next time) and my sister-in-law said they were great.

Yeah, I agree with previous reviewer. 1.5 C pastry flour? The whole wheat helps, but still... 1/2 C Semolina flour? Syrup? Orange juice?

At almost 9 carbs per *mini* muffin, I certainly would NOT consider this a low carb recipe at all.
