We have prepared this many times, it has evolved into heirloom or grape tomatoes and heavier on the balsamic and we really enjoy it with Snapper, Halibut, Filet,Usually add bernaise or hollandaise. We like

A good basic fish dish. I used cod instead of snapper and also bumped up the balsamic (by accident, mind you!).Perhaps because of the extra balsamic I didn't find this bland... just nicely flavouered. I would like to try it with chicken breasts like one of the earlier reviewers.

Very easy to prepare but quite bland overall... I would look for tastier ways to prepare snapper.

Printed this recipe out to make a couple days ago...and then forgot to buy the fish so I used chicken breast instead. Also used fresh basil in place of the tarragon. Found really nice tomatoes at the organic farmstand - they had lots of flavor and really made this a winner.

I gave this a thumbs down review and checked to find that my reviewed had been removed from the "reviews," after a few days. Earlier positive reveiws were not removed. What gives?

I also used tilapia instead of snapper. I used a mixture of grape and plum tomatoes, and fresh tarragon instead of dried. I thought it was very tasty and would be an easy dish to prepare for guests.

Very easy preparation but not very flavorful. The leek/tomato mixture was very bland. I would not make this recipe again.

Delicious! I prepared this recipe with tilapia instead of red snapper, and the sweetness of the fish played off well with the mildly tangy tomato-leek mixture. Amazingly simple to make without hard-to-find ingredients.
