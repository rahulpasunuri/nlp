I just made these (totally WONDERFUL) and it occurred to me that if one does not use actual cane brown sugar the recipe would be a disaster. Check to be certain your sugar is the real deal. Often time store brand brown sugar is white sugar with molasses.

These were a lovely addition to our holiday tray'o'sweets. I added a little water to get the coating to stick. Good tip! I don't usually like spicy things, but this did need a little more hot sauce. I wonder if the sugar, salt, and water could benefit from a little melting head start on the stovetop...

I was very excited to find this recipe, but I had the same problem with the sugar not melting. But fear not! This recipe was saved by adding 2 tablespoons of water into the pan to dissolve the sugar, and letting it cook until the majority of the liquid had gone away. I then added about 2 tablespoons of butter on top of the nuts (as per other candied nut recipes) and sprinkled with some turbinado sugar for texture. They dry a little sticky, but have a delicious flavor. I will make this again, but will add more hot sauce and add water to the mixture before it goes in the oven.

I've made these and loved them -- didn't have any trouble with the brown sugar, but I did keep the nuts hot as suggested in the recipe. That's the only thing I can figure out that might be causing a problem for others. The only thing I won't do again is use unskinned hazelnuts -- I used what I had and didn't feel like blanching them, and as a result, the skins were a bit of a mess. But overall the recipe was very good, sweet-savory, and I loved them. I will definitely make it again and again.

I have made a lot of nut recipes and this one is my favorite. We served them at two different parties and everyone raved about them. One of my best party recipes. I will use this again and again.

They taste just like the ones at the Farm! My friends and I are so happy we don't need to go to the restaurant when we need a fix now!

I love these! I've had them at The Farm, and from friends who make them. They're a perfect Northwest gift. I didn't have any trouble with the sugar melting. Perhaps check you're using the dark brown, and it's really important that the oven is at 350, and you stir every 5 minutes quickly, without removing them from the oven. I like mine with more hot sauce! (just a few shakes). These make a great holiday hostess gift: something different than cookies or chocolates.

Ugh! As with the others the brown sugar never melted. I finally removed the nuts with a slotted spoon and melted the sugar in a saucepan with a bit of butter. But then the coating hardens up so fast you can't get a nice even coating. Not a good recioe.

I didn't have the issue with them being too sticky--I was able to keep them separate. Myself and my guests thought they were delicious and unusual (in a good way!) Great with champagne.

Same trouble as everyone else had. The sugar never melted, even though I was careful not to pull the pan out too far. A waste of $9 worth of hazelnuts

Thius worked a treat I tried it at our restaurant and had 10 requests for the recipe

I had the same experience as most of the reviewers. It seemed like something was wrong with this recipe. The brown sugar never really melted after longer than the suggested time. So, I increased the heat, watched closely and the brown sugar turned into a burned tasting mess. I'll probably have to throw the pan away!

I loved these! The brown sugar melts into a sort of sludgy, brown paste and maybe others have expected it to melt more like white sugar. The nuts look goopy and not very appealing when you take then out of the oven but after they cool and are broken apart, it was fine. Also, I didn't bother with taking the skins off of the hazelnuts. Rave reviews from my party guests.

Horrible! By the time the brown sugar had melted enough to form a glaze, the rosemary had burned and left it tasting very bitter. Like the previous reviewer, I had to throw it out.

Blegh. These were just plain gross. I made them as an appetizer for a dinner party but decided they were too disgusting to serve, and threw out the whole batch.

This recipe just didn't seem to work. The brown sugar (from a fresh box) never really melted and thus didn't coat the nuts. I even baked for an additional 5-10 minutes. Maybe if you add a little oil to the brown sugar before mixing in the nuts???

This is cheating, I haven't made the nuts but I have had them in the restaurant. They are absolutely wonderful if served slightly warm and freshly made. If they sit and are cool, they're still quite good but not quite as impressive.
