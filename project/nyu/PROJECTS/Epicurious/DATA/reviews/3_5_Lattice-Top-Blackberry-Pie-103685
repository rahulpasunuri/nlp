Doubled the tapioca, eliminated the water. Tried grinding tapioca in food processor, but it didn't really do much to change the texture, so I stirred the filling pretty thoroughly prior to letting it rest AND I let it rest in a warm place outdoors. I figured, those berries being right out of the fridge would be too cold to really saturate the tapioca. Anyway, it worked--not runny at all, and no visible pieces of tapioca in the finished pie! FABULOUS FLAVOR! I used an all butter crust and it remained crispy underneath despite all the juicy berries. I used 2 1/2 times the recipe for a 12" deep dish pie.

Tasted great. Could perhaps have a little less sugar. The pie was very watery. Maybe the pie needs to cool much longer. Also, the crust browns very quickly. For other pies, I put the foil on the edges initially and would suggest others do for this pie as well. In addition, the top browned too quickly.

Pie turned out beautiful. I prefer tapioca as my thickener because it works well without distracting from the taste of the fruit. Before using it, I grind it so that it isn't visible and I'm thinking it might prevent it from getting hard when it is close to the surface of a lattice top. Also, I added a touch of nutmeg and substituted lime for lemon, as a matter of preference, like I do with all of my pies (except apple). Perfecto!

Wonderful & easy. I didn't know the tapioca would be visible after cooking, so my only suggestion is to make sure the tapioca is all covered up or it will get hard. Probably everyone else knew that.

Made with mulberries and strawberries combined. 1C sugar plenty. Had issues with the pastry so didn't do the lattice. Husband loved it - he never compliments anything so it must be good!

Blackberry soup en croute! Perhaps my berries (big, fat, ripe, glorious berries) were just too juicy... but the filling was terribly runny. If I try it again I'll eliminate the water, up the cornstarch and add some flour. Seems criminal to drain off any of that gorgeous juice.

Just a delicious pie. Deep dish, I added 2 extra cups of blackberries and could have added 2 more. Let cool and chill before serving - it is best when completely set. Will make over and over again!

Hello lover! That is some good pie. Mostly followed the recipe (added a Tbs of flour to the berries before filling the pie). The filling was the perfect combination of berry gooey, not gummy at all.

I used fresh blackberries and after making the pie per instructions the first time, the second time I made it added the extra tapioca and drained the berries even more after they sat for 20 minutes. Pie is easy and delicious!

I made my own pie crust and screwed it up so I didn't have enough for the lattice top, but this still turned out delicious, I just covered the pie top with aluminum foil before popping it in the oven. I was also baking at a friend's house and didn't have a cookie sheet to put under the pie, just baked in my Pyrex pie dish directly on the oven rack. I didn't use even as much as the minimum sugar called for because it seemed like a LOT when I was tossing the berries (I sliced in a few strawberries with the blackberries for variety), but the sweetness came out perfect. This was easy and delicious, got rave reviews and disappeared really quickly, I will definitely be making it again!

Made just the way it was stated. I also cooked the bottom crust in the oven prior before adding the filling. Father in-law stated it was the best black bery pie he has ever had. I used fresh blackberries from the farm. it had a bit too much liquid i thought. i would add a little bit more tapioca. loved it myself. no complaints!

Have made this pie many times, I always increase the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and substitute a tablespoon of flour for the tapioca.

I used fresh blackberries that were fairly sweet, so used just over a cup of sugar. I substituted 1/4 flour for the cornstarch and tapioca and left out the water. My family, not big blackberry lovers, loved this pie. It was not runny in the least and I plan to make it again whenever I can find good, fresh blackberries.

I used frozen berries, and ended up having to scoop a ton of juice out of the pie shell so it wouldn't over flow. My lattice also kept freezing and cracking every time it touched the filling so I scrapped the idea and made some pastry rings that I just laid on the top for décor. Baked up nice and firm, not at all runny. So good!

Very good, used the full amount of sugar and hour and ten minutes baking time.

I made this pie again, this time with freshly picked berries from the Cascades in WA. I doubled the tapioca amount as I did last month, but found that it seemed to make the pie a little too firm. Not that it didn't still disappear in record-time. Possibly doubling the amount of tapioca is perfect for frozen/thawed berries, but it's too much for fresh berries? I also picked up a box of pie dough from Pillsbury, 2 pie crusts are packaged rolled up. I used one for the bottom crust, the other for a full top crust (with 5 slits), it was SO easy.

I made this last night and it was excellent. I added an extra tablespoon of tapioca as suggested by the other cooks.

My boyfriend and I picked wild blackberries in southern Oregon a few weeks ago and this was my first-ever attempt at making a blackberry pie. My only shortcut was to use frozen pie shells and rather than doing a lattice, I did a full crust top. I was true to the recipe except I added an additional TBSP of tapioca since my berries weren't totally thawed. At 35 minutes I had to cover the pie crust edges, the pie took exactly one hour to bake. I cooled it for 5 hours on a cooling rack. It turned out perfect, golden crust on top, firm, not runny at all. We took it with us to a dinner party last night and served it a la mode - it was scrumptous, but not a speck remained for leftovers, my boyfriend was broken-hearted. A real keeper!

Best blackberry pie I've had. It was even better than the pies at Knott's Berry Farm! The only thing is I believe it called for fresh blackberries, and I just used frozen and it tasted great. Also I think fresh lemon juice made it a bit more tart than if you would have used bottled. But it still tasted great!

I liked the flavor of this pie, but found the butter and water to be unnecessary, and only used 1 TB lemon juice, since my berries were pretty tart. The cornstarch remained slightly gritty and the juices didn't really thicken that much; I'd leave out the cornstarch next time and use more tapioca.

This is such a wonderful pie! I've made this recipe over 5 times and it's never been less than flawless. This has become my dad's favorite desert

I used my 1/2 frozen wild Oregon blackberries and a Pillsbury refigerated pie crust, not laticed. I cooked the pie longer than the recipe said to or until the pie bubbled and the filling looked thick. 400 degrees must be the temperature secret for the store bought crust. It was wonderful and flaky. Made 2 recipes, but ended up with 3 pies because I use smaller pans that I got from Marie Callenders. Didn't have an extra pie pan so I put one in a cake pan. Didn't have a problem getting it out of the pan.

Great pie! I used 2 Tbs of tapioca and didn't change anything else and it was the best dessert at Thanksgiving. I did use frozen berries (from our summer garden) and the pie took almost an hour and 45 minutes to cook (I covered the top with foil after the first 45 minutes and it didn't burn). If using frozen berries again, I might let them thaw first.

Wow! This pie was amazing. I was concerned about it based on the reviews and they had it all wrong. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was incredible. There were no issues with it being too runny and I was concerned as I added the two tablespoons of water, it was absolutely incredible. The blackberries are delicious and at a great price this time of year! I will make this again and again

Wow. I, too was scared to try this one, but it turned out really well both times I've made it and my guests have raved both times as well. I brushed the bottom and sides of the bottom crust with egg white and had no spillage/soak through whatsoever. Instead of the tapioca, I added 1/4 c flour suggested by a previous reviewer. The pie held together great, not soggy/too runny AT ALL. I tend to shy away from baking, and therefore did not attempt the crust after someone said it wasn't that great, so I cheated with store bought and did not do a lattice crust, just a regular double-crust pie with a couple of decorative slits cut in for air. I can't say enough about this pie. This recipe, with modifications is a keeper.

Needs some modifications, but a great start to the perfect blackberry pie. With all of the user complaints of being too soupy, I was hesitant to try this recipe. First off, I left out the extra butter and water, since more liquid is the last thing this pie needs (besides, with a freshly made butter crust, you still get a great flavor). The cornstarch and tapioca combination made sense, so I stuck with it. Left out the lemon juice, since the berries have a natural tartness if not oversweetened in the preparation -- instead I added a few tablespoons of brandy, which was well worth the experiment!! Let the pie cool for about 5 hours for a firm, juicy, delicious taste.

I made this last sunday when the grandchildren rushed with a bowl of wild blackberries they picked at the end of the road. I didn't have any tapiocca so I used another 1/4 cup of flour Before placing the pie in the oven I soaked a strip of 1 1/2 inch wide cloth with milk and placed it on the edge of the crust...half on the pie and half folded down around the glass dish. My Grandmother taught that to me in the forties...It keeps a berry pie from running over. This pie turned out perfect...the children loved it.

Followed recipe exactly, using the flour to thicken. My family raved and I think it was one of the very BEST berry pies I've ever made. Not too sweet, not too tart. Served with vanila ice cream. Will definately make again, confidently.K

We got the berries from the garden and had to delay the preparation one day. Many of the berries grew grey hair and had to be thrown out. With only 2/3rds of the berries left it was the perfect amount as it still bubbled over. The presentation was a hit then when the pie went into the mouths everyone loved it. There won't be any leftovers!

I read the earlier reviews where critics complained of a runny pie. I have always had that problem when using cornstarch as a thickener for fruit pies. I followed the recipe exactly except for the substitution of 1/4 cup flour for the cornstarch. I also made my own favorite pie crust. It was a superior pie, delicious to the last bite! The comment was made that it would probably win a ribbon at the county fair. I'm sure having Northwest blackberries was a big plus for the recipe :-)

The pie filling was bitter and tangy. My berries were a little on the tart side but i added plenty of sugar to compensate for this, and the pie was still to tart. I possibly used too much lemon? Used my pasty crust, so no opinions there. Waste of berries.

This pie was absolutely wonderful! I have had nothing but raves from anyone who has had a piece. One word of advise, be sure to line your baking sheet with foil for easier clean-up. The filling did overflow and made a mess of my baking sheet!

terrific pie flavor. You really have to judge the sweetness (or tartness) of your berries to guess how much sugar to put in. great consistancy. I used "the best ever pie crust" from Colorado Cache cookbook.

I've been looking for recipes to use blackberries from my backyard and this one is very tasty and easy to make. I used the filling - not the dough recipe and cut leaf shapes with a cookie cutter to use as crust instead of lattice. Served it with fresh cinnamon, nutmeg and brandy whipped cream. mmmmm. My father and husband fought over who was going to finish my plate when I was too full! A sure sign that this one's a keeper!

I only used the filling portion of this recipe (not the crust) and it turned out great. In the past I've had problems with blackberry pie recipes resulting in pie that is either too runny, or too firm. This was just right and tasted great as well.

I loved the blackberry filling for this pie. I like blackberry pie to be tart, so I only used 1 cup of sugar. Next time I make this, however, I will not use the pastry dough recipe that is linked to this site. It was the worst dough I have ever made. It was so crumbly that I had to put the ball of dough into the middle of the pie dish and flatten it out with my hand! Don't ask me how I managed to put the top crust on! All in all, I recommend the pie filling, but I will use another dough recipe next time.
