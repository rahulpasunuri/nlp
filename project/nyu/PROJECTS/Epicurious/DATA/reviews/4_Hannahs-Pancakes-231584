This is a great recipe! We made these this morning for the first time and loved them. I've tried a few recipes before but struggled to find a keeper until now. These are far superior to the usual pancakes we tend to get in the UK (and in the rest of Europe). GET ON IT PEOPLE!

Light and fluffy pancakes. I liked that I generally always have all the ingredients on hand for this pancake. It requires more work having to separate the eggs and whisk the egg whites but that extra step makes a big difference in the lightness of the pancakes, so it's worth it.

This is a great pancake recipe worth the little extra effort it requires. I add m&m's into the batter for my daughters, and a dash of cinnamon and a bit of vanilla along the way. These pancakes freeze beautifully and far outshine the frozen brands at the supermarket when they're defrosted. They're a great breakfast whether there's just out of the skillet or out of the toaster!

My family loved these. I prefer waffles to pancakes, so I also tried it as waffle batter. Makes *awesome* waffles: crispy on the outside, moist and nicely eggy on the inside, and they don't go cold as fast as regular waffles. Yum!

These pancakes have good flavour, but I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to mine - it's a habit - every pancake needs vanilla ;)

I love a buttermilk pancake, but if you don't have buttermilk on hand, this is a great option.

I'm not usually a huge fan of pancakes. I find most, even buttermilk pancakes, a bit bland and dull. My family, however, loves them, so I thought I'd try this recipe and see if it made a big difference. It did. Fantastic results. Well worth the extra effort of beating the egg whites. With the melted butter in the batter, I wondered if it would make good waffles, too, so I tried that, and those came out very well too. I'll definitely be making these again!

I made these this morning and would actually rate them 3.5 forks. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I added about 1 tsp. vanilla and a few healthy dashes of cinnamon. Also, I hand-whipped the egg whites due to lack of a mixer. (Ouch!) They were very good, but not exceptional, hence 3.5 forks. I think additional spice, fruits, or nuts would make them a 4 fork recipe.

I had never tried whipping my egg whites and it works fantastically! Note, though, that the batter is really eggy - as mentioned numerous times below. I would say eggy to the point of making the recipe less tasty in flavor than most I've tried. I would try using one less egg yolk, maybe adding a touch of vanilla.

Good basic recipe. I have played with the recipe--great as-is, but if you are pressed for time, only use two unseparated eggs, beaten. Just throw the milk and eggs into the dry ingredients, whisk until smooth, etc.

I absolutely love this recipe, the pancakes came out just perfect. they were fluffy and very tasty. I added a little bit of vanilla with the mild and egg yolk to get rid of the egginess. Definitely will be making these again and again

Very tasty. I've tried several different recipes for plain pancakes and this beats them all. Yes, don't over-fold the egg whites so the batter stays fluffy. I also used two bowls, pouring the dry ingredients into the wet. Living in Australia, I also used pastry flour to match the makeup of all-purpose flour with slight changes to baking powder and salt. Also, I didn't press the pancakes while on the griddle so they stayed light and fluffy. I will try adding a tsp of vanilla next time as suggested and use slightly less egg yolk.

Rating: 3
Pancakes taste great. But really folks, if you're cooking a quick Sunday breakfast do you truly feel like beating egg whites?

Rating: 3
Tasty pancakes. They do have a crepe-y texture instead of the traditional cake-y one. I'll make them again, since I like the thicker, fluffier cakes. I'll also try this recipe in my waffle iron. I hate the recipe takes 3 bowls to make. (Who wants to wash more dishes on a Sunday morning) Instead, I made the pancakes backwards - beat eggs first with the clean beaters, mixed milk, yolks and butter in clean 2nd mixing bowl, and finally added dry ingredients directly into the wet. One less bowl and beater help.

Great pancake recipe. Altered the recipe a bit to accommodate my thanksgiving leftovers. Roasted and chopped pecans to add to the batter. Served them with a roasted pear puree and fresh honeycomb. Delicious. (Oh...and tossed some fresh strawberries with the leftover cranberry sauce and served on the side)

I made these for my boyfriend this weekend since he had never had pancakes made from scratch and my usual recipe wasn't on hand. Wonderfully light and fluffy (made 1/2 the recipe, followed instructions exactly), with a great consistency for pouring the batter. The only complaint was that there weren't enough! Will definitely make the full batch next time.

Rating: 3
After reading other reviews I opted to add less eggs. I used 2 yolks and 3 whites. I also added vanilla. The taste was good, but not as fluffy as I was expecting, and kinda rubbery! Although the weather I think had something to do with it. Hate to say it, but Bisquick is hard to beat:)

Rating: 3
I agree with the others that say this is a bit "eggy." I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderfully light and fluffy. I think that next time I will add vanilla and possibly use one less egg. Still, they were pretty good and I think some tweaking can make these extremely yummy on those days I feel like making pancakes from scratch.

I was able to prep and make these in under 30 minutes, which is a plus. They turned out really fluffy and light. I used skim milk instead, which makes it slightly lighter but it's hardly noticeable. They were slightly sweet from the 1 TB sugar, which I thought was perfect. I ate them without any syrup even. Maybe next time I'll try incorporating fruit or savory ingredients.

We have been making this recipe for over a year now and love it. They turn out extremely fluffy. We like it plain but add chocolate chips or top it with apples every so often. It always turns out perfect. Our 3 year old loves this Sunday ritual.

These were okay but for us nothing to write home about. Not sure why we did not get the fluffiness that other reviewers achieved, but they were definitely pretty flat. Tasted fine, just not really wowed by them. Followed recipe EXCEPT we only had skim milk not whole and we also added a tablespoon of vanilla as some reviewers suggested. We definitely spent the time to whip the egg whites, but our pancakes did not achieve ultimate fluff.

I liked these pancakes, but they weren't the best I've ever had. Beating and folding in the egg whites definitely made a difference. They were fluffy and moist. The texture was great. I thought the flavor was wanting just a bit. They were good, just not really exciting. I think I just prefer the taste of buttermilk. But, since I didn't have any on hand, these were more than adequate! The recipe is great; I think it's just my personal taste that prefers something a little different. I'd make them again in a pinch.

There were plenty left over to freeze for later.

These pancakes worked very well dispite the fact that my darling husband who made them for breakfast didn't actually read the recipe, and just threw all of the ingrediants together at once. I assume they will be even better next time! And a tad of vanilla seems like it would be great.

Really liked these, even though they took a little long to prepare. My batter ended up a little thick, so added a touch of water at the end, and the consistency was much better. Overall, they were a little bit "plain" though, so next time I will definitely add some vanilla extract, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Good potential to be great!

These pancakes are super fluffy! The flavor could have been more. I was surprised there was no vanilla in the batter. Fortunately, I was planning to turn them into banana chocolate chip pancakes anyhow. And my boyfriend absolutely LOVED them. I mashed up 2 bananas, and might have added a 3rd if I had one. This recipe makes A LOT. So I will probably halve it next time for 2 people.

This recipe works great using Spelt instead of regular flour (for those with wheat allergies). It can be hard to find recipes that work when using a wheat subsitute, but this turned out a treat!!

Rating: 3
these were quite good and i don't agree that they're just the same as a regular recipe with unseparated eggs. make sure you beat the egg whites until they really are stiff, work quickly but with a light hand to fold the whites thoroughly into the batter and make them immediately so the batter doesn't deflate. i made a half batch, added blueberries to some and chocolate chips to others and left some plain -- a three year old and seven year old, both picky eaters, loved them all.

I made a half batch and it turned out great. Nice and light. I also experimented and added cocoa, ext. teaspon of suger, 1/4 an over ripe banana and some mini chocolate chips to about 2/3 cup batter - tasted great! Good basic recipe that can be tweaked as cooks desire.

I am sorry the previous reviewer did not get the results he or she expected. My results were wonderful! Very light, fluffy pancakes with good flavor. I will certainly make these again!!

I love fluffy pancakes, but these pancakes were not fluffy. The picture that accompanies the recipe does not show fluffy pancakes. They tasted no different than regular pancakes made from scratch or even a boxed mix. Don't waste your time with the egg whites and folding...it didn't make a difference.

Okay I didn't follow the recipe. I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and water instead of milk. Very light and like a pancake should be which can be hard to get with whole wheat. Turns out to be a good recipe for me.

I make a similar pancake recipe at least once a week for my 3 & 8 year old, but Hannah's version makes too big a portion. So for those who need only a couple of pancakes try sifting dry ingredients 1 tsp baking powder 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar 3/4 cup flour 1/8 tsp salt. Separate 1 egg beat white until fluffy. Add yolk to wet mixture 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 sour cream 1 Tbsp melted butter. Mix wet & dry then fold batter into egg whites.

I have been making waffles for 50 years using a recipe from Better Homes and Gardens that required separated eggs with the whites beaten and folded into the batter. I use an old top of the stove waffle maker from the early 1900's It is a tradition to come to Grandma's on Christmas morning for waffles. I have never tried using the recipe with pancakes, but now I will. A stainless steel coffee scoop is 1/8 of a cup or 2 tablespoons) (half of 1/4 measure)
