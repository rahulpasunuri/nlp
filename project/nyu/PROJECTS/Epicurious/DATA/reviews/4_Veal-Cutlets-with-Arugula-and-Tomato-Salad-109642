clever and easy. I used pankow and regular bread crumbs and used far less olive oil. Did not have the basil, but otherwise followed the directions. An elegant version of a flipped steak salad. Kasha pilaf worked well as accompaniment

This was another great Epicurian choice. Easy to assemble, easy to cook and another wonderful meal. Used panco instead of homemade crumbs.

Family really enjoyed this quick & easy dish. I used grapeseed oil for frying and was very crisp with minimal clean up.

This was easy delicious and easy to prepare. I followed my standard veal preparation so the coating adheres (flour/egg/breadcrumbs. An tasty way to get my husband to eat some greens!

To assist those who say that the breadcrumb falls off the veal subsequent to frying, I have the simple solution! Prior to dipping the veal in the egg mixyure, LIGHTLY cover each piece of veal with white flour. Once covered in flour, dip the veal in the egg, followed by the breadcrumb. Ok, now I did make some changes to the recipe. First, I used 4 veal chops (de-boned, fat trimmed, and on the small side - about 1.5 pounds in total) instead of cutlets, and pounded them to 1/4 inch in thickness, and did not add the additional salt called for on the cutlets. I also substituted in ready-made bread crumbs (reduced amount to 1.25 cups), and added Romano cheese (1/2 cup) to the breadcrumbs instead of Parmigiano. Additionaly, I added 2 tablespoons of Romano cheese, 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the egg mixture. Also, I reduced the amount of arugula to 7 ounces (I still had some salad mixture left over) and let the entire salad mixture sit for 1 hour. Lastly, I fried the chops in 1/4 cup of olive oil, versus vegitable oil. WELL, this dish came out great, and the chops were so tender. This is a restaurant quality dish that would impress even the harshest critics. Good luck!

The arugula salad on top of the veal was AMAZING. I let the dressing with the onions in it sit for a while so the flavors were really well infused. The bread crumbs didn't stick to my veal very well (used french bread) but it still tasted great. I agree with the other reviewer that it wasn't the speediest recipe I've ever dealt with. It definitely took a good hour and a half.

Used thin sliced chicken breast instead of veal, and dried breadcrumbs - delicious! Every bite should have a bit of salad and cutlet, mmm...

Only substitution I made was to use parmesan breadcrumbs. Quite simple and very tasty!

Loved this dish. The combination of tomato, onion and arugula made a wonderful compliment for the veal.

I agree with another reviewer that the bread crumb step wasn't really worth the trouble -- Panko would do nicely. The arugula, fresh basil, and vinaigrette combine brilliantly with the delicate veal. Even the arugula hater at my house gave this recipe a big thumb's up.

This was my first time making veal at home.. I order it in restaurants.. This was a very easy way to make a special veal meal.. For 2 or company

I prepared as written and it was fast and delicious. Very refreshing -- don't forget the basil.

Very easy and quick except for the time to make breadcrumbs. Next time I will just use Panko. I used shallots instead of red onion and used chicken breast instead of veal, because of my kids. I will definatly make again. Perfect for a summer dinner party

This is one of my husband's new favorite recipes. The cooking time is too long though - after pounding the veal to 1/8" - 6 minutes really dries the meat out and starts burning the breadcrumbs. 4 to 4 1/2 minutes total is all that is needed for frying time. The vinaigrette is just delicious w/the arugula.
