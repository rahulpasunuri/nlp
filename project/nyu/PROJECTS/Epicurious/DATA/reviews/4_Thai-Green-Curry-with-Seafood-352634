I'm a big Green Curry fan, but I found the curry too hot and overpowering. Next time I'll cut it in 1/2 (3 TBSP.) I also needed a little Mirin to bring the sweetness up. But I'll use the recipe again with these modifications.

Really, really delicious. Using authentic curry paste, 3 T. was enough for us, heat-wise, but I think you could use the full 6 if you wanted it really hot. I added a few tsp. ginger along with the garlic and 2 tsp. sugar with the lime/fish sauce.

This recipe is worth too try...your guests will think you got it from a Thai resturant...excellent!

Btw, the recipe didn't say to dice the Thai chiles or do anything with the lime leaves... we diced - almost to a mince - the chiles and made a chifffonade of the lime leaves, which by the way are kind of key to the recipe.

Dish was EXCEPTIONAL (but with our modifications)!!! First, there was just the two of us, so we halved the recipe. Then, in lieu of just one Thai chile (with the recipe halved), we added six. Hubby isn't a fan of mussels, so we subbed almost a half pound of Chilean sea bass. Having said all of this, we both agreed we'd make it again and would give it five forks if we could. Hubby thinks this is one of the better Thai chile dishes we've had.

Loved it! Could have been hotter for us. Made it pretty much per the recipe. I don't think all curry pastes have the same heat; have to add to taste. Will definitely make it again!

I made this largely as directed - including all the curry paste and a few jalapenos and didn't find it too hot at all -- although I had a whole rockfish that I cut up into pieces instead of the shrimp and mussels and did the lime juice/zest substitute since I didn't have the kaffir leaves. Served it over jasmine rice. Very good if not quite as good as I've gotten in good Thai restaurants. You can use pretty much any seafood and still have a great outcome. I will try it with salmon filets or haddock next time.

Excellent as written. Used Mae Ploy Green Curry.

I love spicy food, but 6 tbsp green curry paste is just diabolic. I used half and it was still too hot for some.

So excellent! Used yellow Mae ploy yellow curry paste instead of green and one one chili pepper to dial down the heat.

Good but extremely hot & spicy, and I used a 1/4 of what the recipe called for of the green curry paste.

Excellent recipe. The taste reminds me of my six years in Thailand. We cut back on the Thai green curry paste and chiles to suit our palate.

We loved it but, it was too hot for us. Next time I will only add 3 TBS of curry paste.

We made this last night for a big group of people, and everyone raved about it. The spice level was VERY high, but luckily we had a group of spice lovers. We skipped the scallops, and it was delicious with just mussels and shrimp. We also made a vegetarian version with tofu and that got great reviews too. I will definitely save this recipe, however I may adjust the spice level in the future depending on who we plan to share the meal with!

I loved this too! Just wanted to add my comments on the spice level, because it's the hardest thing to judge. Like a prior reviewer, I used Maesri brand green curry paste (Montrealers, you can get it from Kim Phat grocery). We had guests, so we cut back to 1/2 can (~3 tbsp) of the curry paste, and only one red chili. The final result was a comfortable "Canadian" level of heat, but definitely not a "Thai" level of heat. I would crank it up a notch next time. If you like pickled jalapeno peppers on your nachos, the half spice will be a little too mild for you. If you like Vindaloo curry, this will be WAY too mild for you. Final note, I used only shrimp and some some fried tofu, skipped the mussels and scallops. Really delicious!

this was fabulous! I made the recipe to the tee, and added a mango (cubed) at the end for the perfect finish. will make this again for sure

This is an amazing recipe. I used clams instead of mussels and omitted the water and added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock in place of the water. After I took all the vegetables and seafood from the pot, I added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce before adding it to the plate. Paired with brown rice mixed with brown butter and chopped cashews. Excellent!

Just enjoyed this in a bowl out on our balcony watching the Edinburgh Festival closing fireworks. It's a lovely warmer for outside. I got a curry paste recipe not mentioned here from http://thaifood.about.com/od/thaicurrypasterecipes/r/greencurrypaste.htm which is really the guts of a thai green curry recipe. In short, though, this is a great foundation on which you can riff a little, based on what you have available. Things not to forget: coriander by the truckload, kafir lime leaves, good spring onions (green onions)...

This was delicious! The blending of flavors in this was perfect. I found it had lots of heat - a little lip numbing at first, but then again, I used the Maesri Green Curry Paste from the Asian market instead of an Americanized curry. One can is 4 oz and I used the entire can as it equaled about 6 Tbsp. I probably will use 1/2 to 3/4 can next time. Instead of the red chilies,I used no-heat red jalapeno. Still, it was too hot for some of my guests, but I loved it! I skipped the lime leaves as my Asian store was out of them. It will seem watery if you're expecting a chowder consistency, but I didn't find it too watery as when the rice is added it gives it good substance.

Amazing! As a young chef of twelve years old, I've made this recipe multipal times! Everybody I cooked it for loved it. Some even said that this would be something you would get at the world's top Thai resteraunt. They said it would cost a thousand times more than it did to actually make it based on taste alone! It's easy and fun to make, and relatively easy on your wallet! If I could only cook one thing for the rest of my life, this would be it!!!

I made a typographical error in my previous comment. 9 Tbsp. green curry paste, not 9 tsp.

I made this for the first time last night, exactly as specified in the recipe. We like the dish very much, but had two comments. My son (a seafood expert) thought the cooking method excellent, but we think it's too bland and we think there is too much watery liquid. Next time I'll reduce or eliminate the water (I'll add the coconut milk first and see how much more liquid is needed), increase the green curry paste to nine teaspoons, increase fish sauce to 1 1/2 or 2 tablespoons, add minced fresh ginger with the garlic, add six minced Thai chilis instead of two,and add more cilantro, lime and basil. I used Thai Kitchen green curry paste because it was available in my local market; this may be somewhat more bland than pastes available in Asian grocery stores. (Despite what you may think, we get excellent fresh fish and seafood here in the Twin Cities; the scallops and mussels I used were top-notch.)

Nice flavorful dish, but I'd add ginger next time.

Ok, I am giving this four forks because what flavour I could taste was fantastic but WOW! Holy hot with all 6 T of curry paste. I am a bit wimpy when it comes to heat but my husband loves hot curry and his eyes were tearing. Maybe it's the type of curry paste? I found my way down to the local Asian market and bought the most authentic looking stuff I could find (English was the fine print) maybe that's it... Anyway, my advice is, start low and add. But for flavour, all the forks I can give it.

This is fantastic, and absolutely if you are using Thai Kitchen green curry paste then 6 T is not too much- it is perfect. I could only find green Thai chiles and used 3 whole and 1 diced and the heat was just right. Substituted chinese eggplant for the carrots, and used 1 lb wild halibut instead of the shell fish. One caveat: try to have everything ready in advance of putting it together as the bok choy can quickly turn from beautiful bright green to murky olive-colored if overcooked. Found I needed to add a bit more fish sauce, a little brown sugar and some lime juice in the end for balance. Great recipe!

I added all the curry paste and I found it rather bland. It was lacking the heat that green curry traditionally has. I think that next time I might chop the hot peppers so the curry absorbs the flavor. I'd also recommend not chopping the basil and cilantro too finely. I found the general texture was a bit gritty because everything was chopped so finely.

For some reason, I listened to all the reviewers about not adding in all of the green curry paste. DON'T LISTEN TO THIS! This recipe NEEDS all of the green curry paste to make it taste like a curry. If it is too spicy, then don't add in the two red Thai chiles. Just add in one, or none at all. This is a great authentic flavor in a pinch! It is faster than takeout!

Potential. We used half the curry paste and it was so spicy we couldn't pick up any of the other flavors. As presented in the magazine, it was a waste of expensive fresh ingredients because the curry bombed everything else.

It was a great recipe, I only used 2 teaspoon of curry paste, it was hot enough for my family, everyone liked it I will try it again.

Thanks, cooks, for various suggestions. I, too, added lots of fresh ginger and basil, as well as lime zest and juice. I also used Thai red curry paste, which I prefer, and one green serrano pepper. This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious. I skipped the scallops.

I also cut the amount of curry paste in half (Thai Kitchen) and there was plenty of heat. I added one tablespoon of finely minced ginger with the green onion mixture and 2 chopped plum tomaatoes with the basil and cilantro. Served with jasmione rice and a lime wedge. Delicious!

This has WONDERFUL flavor. I used shrimp and mussels but left the scallops out (my son is allergic to them). Only used half the green curry paste and it was just the right amount of "punch".The dish is beautiful and delicious. Even my 9-year-old son asked if I could make this again sometime! I definitely will.

Great flavor. Used chicken instead of seafood and it was fantastic. Have to disagree with one review in the fact that the paste does have chilis in it which gives it the heat. I also found it too hot with 6tbl of the paste. I cut it in half and it was perfect.

This was excellent. I'll definitely make it again. I used the full amount of curry paste, practically doubled the cilantro and basil, and used the alternate lime juice/zest instead of kafir lime leaves. I also used one red chile instead of 2 and it had just the right amount of spiciness. (It's not the curry paste that makes it hot!) I also added some mushrooms and bell pepper and only used the shrimp. The flavor is fantastic!

This was fabulous. Next time I would cut back on the curry paste, it was extremely spicy. But the flavor was excellent. Fortunately my sister has a Kaffir lime plant, not sure I could have found the leaves otherwise.

Loved the flavor but it was too hot. I only used 2 tbs curry paste. I cook with it often and thought 6 tbs would be too hot. I use the Thai Kitchen brand. Maybe it is hotter than other brands.

This is just delicious! I had to use lime juice as I couldn't find the kaffir leaves. We had it with jasmine rice. Fantastic!
