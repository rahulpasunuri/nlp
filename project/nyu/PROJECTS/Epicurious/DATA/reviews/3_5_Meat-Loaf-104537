I really wanted to love this meat loaf. I followed the recipe exactly, only adding a Tablespoon of Worcestershire as suggested by other reviewers. I had it in the oven and went online to look up the internal temperature of a properly cooked meat loaf. This led me to an article that quoted Alton Brown on the joys of meat loafing. Alton says that all-beef meatloaves tend to be more coarse and livery-tasting than loaves made from a mixture of meats and I gotta agree. Sadly, mine came out just this side of nasty. Edible with ketchup, but then it just becomes a vehicle for a condiment. I won't be making this one again (sigh.)

This is the one. Moist, tender and tastes like meatloaf used to taste before we started messing with everything. And I apologize, but it did need a splash of Lee & Perrins. That was the only thing I changed. For me, less is more when it comes to meatloaf because the more complicated the recipe, the less I liked the results. Less is more when it comes to comfort food. So if you want a meatloaf that is super easy, fast and so yummy, try this.

Like others, I was suspicious of the simplicity of the recipe- the ingredients as well as the prep. And it was awesome! I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and added a few scallions and some Worcestershire sauce. Cooked it free form and it got a great crust. The fact that it was only beef made it super convenient, too.

Good basic recipe. Does need spicing up but since the recipe is so simple you can spice up a lot of different ways. Very moist. Served with a mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.

This was good. As with most, I added onion & Worst sauce. Once done I sliced and served with beef gravy. Next time I will serve with mashed potatoes.

I have tried many meatloaf recipes and this is my family's favorite. I do use the meatloaf veal/pork/beef combo instead of just beef as it gives it more flavor. Also, I splash some Worcestershire sauce in there. Other than that, no changes! Simple and hearty.

Loved this! I added 1/4 c. of chopped onion and 3 tsp. of Worcestershire as well. The simple recipe is deceiving. It was moist and packed with flavor. Unfortunately, there were no leftovers...I'll have to double the recipe next time!

I'm 2 weeks into an 8 week summer rental, so trying to keep buying ingredients to a minimum -- this was perfect as all ingredients on hand, plus some of the extras others have mentioned. Moist, and as tasty as you can make it!

OVERALL THE BEST MEATLOAF EVER. A REAL MEATEATERS DISH. A GREAT RECIPE..A CLASSIC

Rating: 4
I doubled this recipe as we love meatloaf sandwiches. I added half of a finely diced large yellow onion, Worcestershire sauce , 4 cloves of minced garlic, and seasoned bread crumbs. What I learned about this recipe is that it is a fine base to mix and match any additives you want in your meatloaf. The loaf is solid and very flavorful. This would be the meatloaf recipe to use if you wanted to stuff the meatloaf with things like cheese and mushrooms. This is a must make dish and a certain crowd pleaser.

Well,yes, it's just meatloaf, but I've been looking for a recipe that: 1)needs only beef; 2) doesn't call for more expensive or difficult-to-get ingredients than meatloaf is worth; and 3) is reliably moist without needing sauce. This does all that! Added a tbsp or so of finely chopped onion and one of Worcestshire, basted with bbq sauce for last 15 mins.

There is something to be said for simplicity... I have made it using organic ground beef as well as ground buffalo and both were amazing. The only thing I changed was I added minced onion and used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. It was so moist and delicous! My one year old daughter loves it as well.....Great basic recipie.

Love it! I've been playing around with meatloaf forever trying to get it just right. Adding this, that and the other thing. And this is the perfect one. So simple! My friends didn't believe there were so few ingrediants.

Hands-down the best meatloaf I have ever had. Family loves it. Thanks to the previous reviewers for my modification ideas: add about 2 tblsp. each of worcestershire and barbecue sauce to the mix, use fresh bread crumbs, make a free-form loaf in the pan to allow some fat and moisture to cook out, use barbecue sauce (thick, sweet, spicy type) on top, added during last 30 minutes of cooking.

Apologies to all who gave this dish top ratings. Come on you guys this is just your very basic meatloaf recipe and just about anything added improves it including lowly catsup. It is not a dish beyond compare. It is easy to prepare however.

I thought by looking at this recipe that it wouldn't be great, but with all the good reviews I decided to try it since I was looking for something easy, and simple and I was short on ingredients. It was really very good. I followed it exactly except that I added maybe a couple of tablespoons of Worcestershire. I also just did a free form loaf on a pan because I like more crispy edges, and instead of tomato sauce, I used a BBQ sauce on top - just spread it on for the last 10 minutes. My husband and I both really liked it. We had it with mashed potatoes and baked beans and it was a really good comfort food supper. Will always use this recipe for the base, and try adding different things.

This meat loaf is fabulous - very moist and delicious - and served with chili sauce makes the perfect dish.

Easy, basic, kids can't get enough of this, and I can 'hide' grated carrot, onion and capsicum in it. A great start and then have fun adding.

This is a classic. I agree with the previous poster that the beauty of the dish is in its simplicity and purity of flavor. I generally double the recipe and use Japanese panko bread crumbs, grind the pepper very coarse and add just a dash of Worcestershire. I usually enjoy using really bold flavors and spices, but this American-Zen classic is a must in any cook's repertoire. Comfort food at its finest.

Blecky! Moist, but very bland. We didn't even keep the leftovers. My husband covered his in hot sauce to add some spice. Not worth the effort to tweak this dish. The quest for meatloaf recipes continues...

Made this recipe, was a little suspicious of its simplicity, whether it would be bland or not - it wasn't bland at all, it was great. I added onions, which made it more interesting, but that was all I changed. Made brown gravy with mushrooms, but the meatloaf was so moist, we didn't use on anything byt the mashed potatoes. Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

I added garlic and onions to this recipe,I think if I had only added onions and no garlic it would have tasted better.

It's not often that my husband asks for a repeat of a recipe but this is definately one of his favorites. We've made lots of meatloaf recipes in the past but this one beats the others by far. Hubby also enjoys rating the recipes at the dinner table during our meal. Excellent served with mashed potatoes and green beans.
