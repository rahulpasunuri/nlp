Wonderful crust; grape filling was inedibly, sickeningly sweet!

Oh, this was delicious. The crust was one of the standout parts--so good.

This recipe created one of my better crusts, but I found that the grape topping was too sweet! It was cloyingly sweet and too strongly flavored like grape jelly. I would suggest coming up with a different glaze recipe maybe by adding more lemon juice to cut through the sweet, or using something other than grape jelly. I used your average type of grape jelly available at the store, and that is all I tasted....only missing the peanut butter. The presentation, however, was very nice! I did serve it with the Stilton which I did agree was a good combination, but even a Stilton could not tame the sweetness of this tart. Good luck with a solution!

Loved it! Made it as an alternative to the traditional heavy T-day offerings. It was delicious and so refreshing! Didn't cook the grapes and the glaze reduced just fine. Halved the recipe with no problems at all.

I will make this again. This recipe halves nicely. I cooked the grapes with the sugar mixture for the last 30 minutes. I didn't have the problem with grapes rolling around that another reviewer mentioned because the grapes cooked down ever so slightly. It took closer to 1.5 hours for the filling to reduce adequately, though. Delicious. Don't skimp on the Stilton,.

Unique & Easy. I added a bit of extra cinnamon & ginger to the crust, as well as some nutmeg. It helps to balance the sweet filling. Blue cheese was a lovely touch. As far as the port mixture reduction - just give it plenty of time and bring it down to the suggested volume. Then allow it to cool - most of the thickening will happen as it cools. I really enjoyed this one!

This turned out beautifully. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but I found that while I WAS able to get the jelly-and-port mixture to reduce, it took far longer than the recipe indicated. Still, it did eventually reduce. I took the time and let it get down to the indicated volume instead of just going with what I had after the recommended time. The thickness of the mixture did in fact end up being enough to hold the tarts together. After it cooled, it got very tacky in texture. Alas, I neglected to bring the Stilton to the potluck where I was serving the tarts! I think it would have been a beautiful addition, too. But the tarts got rave reviews in spite of that omission, and I would love to make them again sometime. Maybe during the summer. A lovely dessert to look at that's light but rich in flavour.

I had one problem, and maybe people can help me out. I reduced the port/jelly mixture, and it never got sticky enough to hold the grapes together. I used blackberry jam and port, what went wrong?

This was great. I doubled the pecans in the crust for a nuttier flavor. I was skeptical about raw grapes for dessert, but turned out to be a good, light dessert.

This was EXCELLENT! Both visually appealing and delicious! I used concord and red grapes, made individual tarts and passed stilton cheese for grating if desired. Nothing but raves all around! Definately a keeper!

I'm the world's worst baker and even I pulled this off. The crust did give me some grief--I was watching in in the oven and the sides started slipping down, the bottom puffed up, making a flat tart! I pulled it out halfway through baking and used a spoon to press the sides back up and flatten it out. It worked great so obviously this crust can take some abuse! The crust was amazing, the grapes were great and the presentation was awesome. I have leftovers sitting in my fridge now 4 days later and it still tastes and looks great. So I wouldn't worry about assembling in advance like the recipe says. I'll be making this again.

I'll try making this dish again simply because I am sure it can be better than what I came up with. I couldn't find red seedless grapes, so I ended up using smaller white seedless grapes. These may have been too sweet, and rolled all over the place like peas when serving, even though the glaze was sticky. I also used a regular tart mold, since I don't have one with removable sides, and I didn't like the finished look. Because the tart was too sweet, serving it with Stilton was too much for my tastebuds; unsweetened whipped cream was the better choice.

I have now made this 4 times and it's fantastic! I love it as a dessert and the last time I made it I served it as an appetizer with a riesling and cambozola cheese. Got raves from a Delfina chef who was at the party. I added a little nutmeg to the crust and sliced the grapes in half to make them easier to eat. The last time I made it, I did it in tartlet pans so each person had a single serving. Much easier to eat. One final note: I have used the glaze to top poached pears and it's a winner there, too.

i have now made this recipe three times -- in less than one month -- and haven't once had the problem the others experienced with the crust. it's much more flavorful than regular tart pastry, and adds a nice textural difference from the grapes. i've tried the recipe with whipped cream, and it's not close to the boost the tart gets from the stilton (and not just bleu, but good quality stilton, which is the cheese most recommended with port).

This is a wonderful dessert, but I truly believe something is missing from the tart recipe, like some sort of "binding agent" (egg or egg white). When I filled the tart shells with the port-glazed grapes, the middle of the shells "disintegrated" and I wound up with a sticky mish-mash of crust and grapes that tasted great but was a disaster to serve. Thank goodness my Thanksgiving guests were easy going and went with the flow. I served the tart with Stilton and that was lovely! It created a nice counterbalance to the sweetness of the grapes. I, too, had to trash the first set of tarts because they cooked too fast in my oven. The middle cooked much faster than the edges, and I was successful with the second batch by cooking them at a lower temperature. Next time, I plan to use a different recipe for the tart shell that won't fall apart once the warm liquid from the glaze hits it.

I agree about the filling/crust difference. I didn't think the flavour of the crust was worth the trouble. The filling was quite good - my family ate all the leftovers rather quickly. I didn't try the cheese, but I don't think I'd make this again. I love fruit-based desserts and have others that are better.

THe filling was a four, the crust a two. I ended up trashing the first shells (too thick and cookie like) and subsituting the recipe for sweet tarlet shells. This was lighter and crisper and complimented the grapes wonderfully. The cheese was what put this dessert over the top. A few shavings of roquefort. Wow!!
