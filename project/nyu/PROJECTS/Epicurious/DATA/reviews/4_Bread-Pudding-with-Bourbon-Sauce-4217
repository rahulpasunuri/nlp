The bourbon sauce is crazy addictive. I'm not a big sweet person and the sauce makes me re-think my position on sugar. Such a simple comforting dish, but with complex flavors that make this such a keeper. I made it for Christmas dessert and everyone raved about it. Love.

Gorgeous - use croissants instead of bread and you will make many, many friends with this dessert. For a change, I put some cream cheese or marscapone in the custard and use good quality maple syrup instead of sugar. Top with soft whipped cream, finely chopped pecan or walnut praline, and a drizzle of syrup. It made a pregnant lady cry - in a good way!

I first made this in 1997 and have made it consistently ever since. ONe guest I served it to said, "If this dessert was made in South America, it would be kidnapped and held for ransom!" I like the bourbon sauce so much, I like to double it.

Excellent. 11 ozs. Italian bread with the crust and 1/2 cup more cream. This is the best homemade bread pudding I have ever had.

I weighed out 12 ounces of bread (one and a half baguettes). It was WAY too much bread for the liquid. Followed the instructions exactly and the top was dried/crunchy. We had to toss the entire top as it just didn't work. I also didn't think that the recipe made enough sauce...I'd easily double or triple the sauce. I also didn't like the idea of using a loaf pan as it's near impossible to cut out neat slices...better to use a shorter pan, nonstick or butter the pan for easier removal or, better yet, bake in individual serving dishes to avoid this mess altogether. I'd make again with these changes.

I tried this recipe twice and failed both times. Way too much bread and not enough milk/eggs. I give up and won't do this one again.

This is a great recipe! I use golden raisins and double the sauce. I never trim the crusts because I think it gets too mushy otherwise. This is a Christmas staple at our house.

Pretty good, but I found the whipping cream unnecessary.

I really liked this recipe. I added chocolate chips just because I love chocolate and it turned out great, although I didn't really care for the sauce, I liked it better without.

YUM. did not drain the rasins after soaking, i just added everything:) soaked both the bread and rasins for 8 hours. next time i will do what others have suggested and make more of the milk mixture. i made the sauce, everyone but me liked it!

I thought it was good. It was a little dry for my taste and I added about atwo tablespoons of bourbon to the sauce at the very end after it had finished cooking to cut the sweetness. Overall, I would use this recipe again. I would just add a bit more of the milk, cream, egg combination.

Sorry - wrong recipe!

I love bread pudding and have made many versions, this is THE BEST! I made it as printed with the following adjustments: added 1/2 cup pecans, doubled the vanilla, doubled the cinnimon, used Grand Marnier to soak raisins & added 3 tsps of the soaking liquid to the egg mixture, had fresh french loaf so sliced it and left the slices on the counter overnight to dry. I baked it on convection and it took 8 minutes less than written. It was HEAVEN!!!!

OUtstanding recipe, and very easy. I made it largely as written, except for doubling the recipe (perfect for 9x13 pan). I did add about 4 tbs of the bourbon from the raisins to the pudding, and the rest of the bourbon from soaking was the perfect amount for the sauce. Had a little trouble with the sauce separating as it cooled, but didn't have a double boiler, which may have been the problem. Next time would add a pinch of salt to pudding and sauce.

I've made this a few times and always add more bourbon. To me, the sauce comes out too sweet as written. Last time I made it, i ended up brushing straight bourbon directly onto the bread pudding itself, then added the sauce. Tasty!

Totally fabulious bread pudding. However I have a few changes ... add the 1/3 cup of brandy you used to soak the raisins to the egg mixture (it gives it a wonderful flavor & kick). Skip the sauce alltogeather. I found the sauce so so ... and enjoyed the pudding much more served with fresh whipped cream.

Divine! I used very stale french baguette, crumbled with crust on. In place of 1/2 c sugar, used previous reviewer's suggestion of marmalade. Let the very stale bread soak in the egg mixture for 2 hours in the fridge. Added cherries soaked in Grand Marnier, reserving liqueur for sauce. SO YUMMY! Hope I can duplicate it sometime.

This is agreat desert - right up there with the brownie recipe from Julia Child's book on Baking. After making this recipe several times, I've made 3 changes: I use one whole challah bread, crust removed. I add 2 tablespoons of bourbon to the pudding. I make twice as much bourbon sauce, and add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the sauce.

This is a fast recipe. My husband asked for more. I changed the sauce to a white chocolate sauce since we had a couple of people who dont use alcohol.

Wow! This is a great recipe, and I thought I didn't like bread pudding. I made a few changes to the recipe. Since we're not fond of raisins, I used blueberries instead. They were a great suggestion. Also, since I had no whole milk, I added 1/2 cup of skim milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1/2 cup 1/2 & 1/2. The othe thing I thought I would mention is that I took the crust off of one very large French bread, as well as 1/2 of a French bread. It only yielded about 1/2 the weight required in the recipe. The pudding was still delicious.:-)

amazing. i used wild blueberries instead of raisins and it was fantastic. i added more liquid as it looked as if it would turn out a bit dry and it was perfect. the best bread pudding ever.

Simple and yummy. Used whole milk rather than whipped cream.Added about 3 oz. more bread-felt like mom's was more this texture... Next time...orange marmalade instead of some of the sugar and maybe some orange zest. Stay tuned!

Has anyone tried doubling or tripling this recipe? I want to make it for an office party of 40 some people so I'd like to make a really big pan of it. Any suggestions?

Great easy recipe and tastes wonderful! Soak the bread for an hour or two--you get better resulting bread pudding--per Emeril.

This recipe was simply heaven. I used a firm stale baguette and cut it into cubes. Didn't bother to trim the crust. It baked up golden and crisp at the top. The texture was what bread pudding should be smooth and comforting. I didn't have bourbon, so I used rum. Soaked the raisins in the warmed rum for ~30 minutes. Drained the raisins and reserved the rum for the sauce. I was worried about the bread being so hard, but i let it sit in the egg mixture for 30 minutes just to make sure it soaked up the liquid. The bread pudding came out perfectly.

I modified it a little bit. I soaked the raisens in tequila. Instead of milk I used half&half. I left out the vanilla and cinnamon and substituted the zest of one orange and 2 or 3 ounces of gran marnier. Great with a vanilla sauce or an orange sauce.

Incredible! I tried it with no sauce at first, and it was very good, not too sweet, not too heavy. Then I tried it with the sauce, it was amazing!! I used milk instead of butter for the sauce, and it turned out well.

I use this as a base for all my bread puddings. Experiment with other dried fruits or well drained fruit cocktail. Use other breads, even brownies! Vary sauce with Grand Marnier, Frangelico, etc. Great starting point.

I made this pudding for an office Mardi Gras party and it was delicious. I did use non-fat milk and it didn't seem to make a difference. The bourbon sauce was fantastic, but next time I would double it.

The definitive bread pudding. Just like New Orleans. We probably will never try any other bread pudding recipe as this is just the recipe we were looking for.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. Bread Pudding is my husbands favorite but he never cared for mine particularly until now. His comment was "You've finally hit it; New Orleans quality." I soaked the raisins for 2 hours and doubled the sauce. An excellent recipe

This is a wonderful recipe. I like the fact that it has less eggs than other bread puddings, labeled "bread and butter" puddings. You don't need 8 eggs, this recipe is just right. I used Sunmaid currants instead of raisins, just a personal preference. Also the bourbon sauce is delicious, my husband loves it. I've made this recipe 3 times already. It's so comforting. Also, I used rum once in the sauce when i ran out of bourbon and it was just as good! Thumbs up!!!!

My fiance is a bread pudding afficianado, and he loved this when I fixed it for Valentine's Day Dinner. We're not big fans of raisins, so I omitted them. The brandy was not as strong, then, but still great. This was so easy... I'd make it again without question.
