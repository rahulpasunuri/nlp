Amazing. I made this twice in one week for two different sets of dinner guests; it was a hit! I did have to triple the marinade for one pound of shrimp. There was just no way the amount the recipe called for was going to cover evenly.

Only made the marinade in order to make shrimp fajitas, but the shrimp were excellent. I'd like a little chile flavor in addition to the flavors of this marinade, but the original recipe has serranos so that should not be a factor when the whole recipe is made.

The marinade for the shrimp is devine. Being unfamiliar with different peppers, I did not realize the power of a Sorrano pepper and for other novices: BE WARNED - THEY'RE HOT! One of my guests got the hiccups, another spat out her mouthful of food. Milk had to be served to all at the table. I would make this again, add mushrooms on the skewers and omit the Sorrano peppers. Sure provided entertainment at dinner though!
