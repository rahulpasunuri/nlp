Beautiful dessert! Not too hard to make. The only reason I don't give it four forks is because I feel that the candied cranberries are too sugary! It was like eating spoonfuls of sugar! I would use half the sugar next time to candy the cranberries, otherwise a very tasty dessert combining a favorite fall seasonal fruit with chocolate! Oh, I used chambord instead of the creme de cassis and it was delicious.

Wonderful and looks impressive. Made this for Christmas 2 years ago to rave reviews. I was afraid it would look better than it tasted, but the rich chocolate really balanced out the tart cranberries. Even a few very picky eaters enjoyed it.

This is very, very rich but quite addictive and hard to stop eating.

I washed, frosted and then froze the cranberries prior to baking as recommended by other reviewers. I also used more cranberries (2 12 oz pkgs) to really cover the tart. This recipe is beautiful and delicious and will always be on the table at the holidays.

I made this twice during the holidays. My extended family loved it as did my friends when I made it for a winter baby shower. The tartness of the cranberries work well with the dark chocolate. Easy and nummy!

This combination is so gorgeous! I have now made this tart 4 times, and just learned to perfect it. I did try the wash/sugar/freeze method and it was ok. I wash/sugar the cranberries and stick them in at 400 degrees for only 6 minutes. The cooking time suggested is way too long and my berries pop. As soon as I take them out of the oven, I stick them in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes. They come out looking like little sparkling jewels! Beautiful everytime, I highly recommend this technique.

Excellent Thanksgiving dessert. I also added a 2-3 second extra pour of heavy cream & substituted Chambord (because that's what I had.) Used the wash/sugar/freeze method for fresh cranberries--thanks!

This is a beautiful holiday dessert. I used the rinse/sugar/freeze/bake method as other users described and it came out exactly as the picture. The crust is incredible and I have adopted it for other tarts. It almost tastes like shortbread. This dessert always "WOW"'s people!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous! I did add about 3-4 Tblsp. more cream to the chocolate ganache (since others said it was a bit hard to cut when cold) which made it perfect...still firm but easy to cut. I also used 1 1/2 bags of fresh cranberries and used the rinse/sugar/freeze/bake method as earlier reviewers suggested, and they turned out beautiful (thanks to that reviewer). Served with lightly sweetened whipped cream...so festive and delicious!

Every time I make this tart I get rave reviews. I've made it so many times now I could probably do it in my sleep. I sometimes sprinkle a little extra sugar on top of the cranberries after adding them to the tart so they look "frosted".

This was a huge hit. I was very careful to capture every last drop of cranberry syrup, and wish I hadn't been; too late, I realized that the syrup was overflowing the crust and dripping stickiness everywhere! The tart was still beautiful and held together fine (in fact, it held to the bottom of my fridge very well) but it made it hard to detach the bottom of the pan. I also found the chilled chocolate hard to cut through; I think that, when I make this again, I'll put it on a warmed plate for serving so that the chocolate will soften just a bit.

So good, so easy, and so beautiful! My berries were quite lovely, but I do like South Dakota's wash/freeze suggestion. This is a great dish for holiday entertaining, especially since so much can be done in advance. I also only used one bag (12 oz) of berries, and though it wasn't stingy, I would have been happy to pile up more, also because then it didn't really fill up the crust since the crust was even taller than my tart pan (per instructions). The chocolate filling was delicious - I mixed unsweetened, milk, and semisweet to use up bits that I had around, and it was wonderful, and pastry was very easy to work with. Garnished with some springs of holly and it was a hit.

I, too, had trouble with the cranberries looking like the picture so I experimented and found this method of preparing them to work. Wash cranberries and toss them in the sugar while they are wet. Spread on foil lined jelly roll pan and freeze until firm. Bake at 375 degrees 10 minutes. Perfect, red, round berries!

This is a great holiday recipe, pretty easy to make and looks so festive. I've made it twice and will make it again for this holiday. I only used one bag of cranberries, 1 1/2 bags were too much. I also cannot get the cranberries to come out as nice as they are pictured, but they still look like little jewels.

Beautiful presentation. I made these mini tartlettes for a large function. They were tremendous. I didn't have the Creme de Cassis so I substituted Gran Marnier. A great idea for the holidays.

I've made this twice since I first saw it in 1999. It is quick, lovely and tastes superb! It is in my 'tried and true' box of recipes - I love it!

I made this several years ago for a December baby shower at work. Everyone flipped out over it. I liked it, but wasn't as crazy about the cranberry-chocolate combo as everyone else was. This was one of the most beautiful things that ever came out of my kitchen! I garnished it with a single small sprig of fresh rosemary.

Very rich. A nice combination of flavors - the dark rich chocolate with the sweet/tart cranberries. The presentation is also beautiful except my cranberries did not turn out anywhere near as nicely as the one pictured in the magazine. I used fresh cranberries (not frozen). Perhaps they did not need as much cooking time because they got fairly mushy and did not retain their nice round shape.

I made this recipe during the Thanksgiving holiday this year. My entire family loved it. It was a great alternative to pumpkin pie.

I make this every Christmas and it is always a big hit. I use a Christms tree shaped tart pan and it always looks great.

A new family Thanksgiving tradition! The tartness of the cranberries and the rich, sweetness of the chocolate are a delicious combination. This is best served with a dollop of whipped cream. For variety, I substituted frozen cherries; it was tasty, but not nearly as interesting as the cranberries. A deceivingly simple, yet elegant dessert. I've already made it again!

This is a nice tart, however, I thought there was too much chocalate and this took away from the cranberries. So I think I would not make it again because the balance is not there.

A beautiful dessert-mine came out just like the photo. My dad actually wanted less chocolate, more cranberries, but I thought it was a perfect combination just as it was. A very nice end to my Christmas day dinner, especially when served with some whipped cream.

I made this last year for a holiday bake sale and have been asked to make more this year!!! This is an easy recipe that looks elegant and festive.

If you're making this dessert for chocolate lovers, consider halving the cranberries and shaving chocolate over the top. I personally found the recipe to be somewhat cloying with all those tart berries. The crust was perfect, though, and I'll make this dessert again.

Great recipe! I ended up making it about a half dozen times last holiday season. To save time, I recommend using a purchased chocolate graham pie shell instead of making the dough from scratch. Saves some time, and actually improves the overall taste, in my opinion

Tasted great, a wonderful sweet-sour dessert, but the cranberries on top ended up more like cranberry sauce, and I didn't overcook them. Not as pretty as the picture, but delicious.

This came out great. The cranberries added just the right tartness to compliment the bitter chocolate.

It was a beautiful dessert and tasty too. You can make it with regular crust to save time
