I made this for Thanksgiving and again for a dinner party, and it doubled as a delicious table decoration in both instances. I would be a bit cautious about the type of pumpkin you use - of the two times I made, it, the sugar pie pumpkin worked out much better than the larger variety. Also - word to the wise - use your common sense with the amount of salt (i.e more salt if you're using Emmenthal; less if you're using Gruyere or Cheddar)... Oh, and use allllllll the cream (it'll bake off into pure deliciousness).... :)

This was delicious! I have tried various other main courses for vegetarian friends and family at big meals and had not yet found a dish that did not end up feeling like a side note to the meat. This was not the case here and this dish got rave reviews from everyone at the table, including the carnivores. I used a kabocha squash, as some other reviews indicated, and it was great. For the stuffing I basically stuck to the recipe with addition of some walnuts and while it tasted great, I will add extra bread in the future as it seems to get lost in the rest of the ingredients. However, the best thing about this is how versatile it is. I will definitely make this again, and can't wait to try bread alternatives such as rice or quinoa. Bottom line, if you are looking for a hearty vegetarian main course that doesn't feel somehow less than a meat main does, this is the recipe for you.

I had a small pumpkin that was still good after Thanksgiving and when I found this recipe I tried it and it was outstanding. I think you could do this with an acorn squash as well.

I love this recipe: unique, versatile, beautiful presentation and delicious. I made 2 pumpkins for Thanksgiving dinner. I baked the pumpkins in pyrex pie plates and was able to serve directly from the pie plates. The only thing that I would change would be to trim the parchment paper in a prettier fashion - maybe scallop the edges. I used the sourdough apple stuffing from this website and layered it with a white cheddar cheese that was studded with cranberries. What a fun recipe - I'll make again and again. I want to try it with rice next.

This was an excellent recipe! I customized my stuffing for a gluten-free, vegetarian version: about 1 cup of cooked wild rice blend, some caramelized shallots, about 3/4 cup shredded young kale leaves, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 chopped apple, chopped herbs (4 sage leaves and a sprig of rosemary plus three pinches freshly dried thyme). I used half Gruyere and half seaside smoked cheddar from Whole Foods. My carnival squash was stuffed too full to accommodate the cap, so I cooked it in a Le Creuset bell pepper-shaped iron casserole with the lid on for all but the last 20 minutes of cooking. One of the BEST dishes I've ever eaten. Perfect meatless Thanksgiving entree.

Have Dorie's book and first tried this recipe from it. This is a huge hit with my family and with friends, including children. Looks elegant and tastes wonderful. One of the great things about the cold month of November is that pumpkins are in season & make a great excuse to enjoy this recipe again and again.

Were the pumpkins you used Pie pumpkins or ones that are typically carved up as jack-o-lanterns? I have not tried this recipe yet but I have read the other reviews and I think that a pie pumpkin is the best choice as it's naturally sweeter and has more flavor.

It seems as if I'm the only person in the world who didn't love this recipe! I hate to be the naysayer, but after following the recipe exactly, I filled two different types of pumpkin that I received in my CSA and I didn't care for either. While the stuffing was good (although incredibly rich) the pumpkin flesh was bitter and boring. For me, I prefer pumpkin that has been pureed, seasoned, or curried, but just eating globs of it from the shell was very blah. Even the rich stuffing didn't make the pumpkin flesh exciting. Perhaps I had two pumpkins that were too bitter or under-ripe?

I made this yesterday exactly as written, doubling the stuffing ingredients for two small pumpkins. I own Dorie's newest cookbook, "Around My French Table", where this recipe originated; I was hoping that it would give me an idea of how accurate her recipes are. It worked perfectly and it was a resounding hit amongst all six of us. Two hours cooking time was right on. With a green vegetable, it's a wonderful fall dinner!

I was wondering if anyone has every tried this where you would eat it cold (or cooled)? I am looking for a recipe for my work pot luck and would love to try this!

I have made this several times with different ingredients, based on Dorie's suggestions. By far, the family favorite is with cooked (left-over) brown rice and more bacon (6 cooked slices at least). I don't salt the pumpkin at all, since the bacon is salty enough. I also use a really good white cheddar for the cheese, and lots of black pepper. Try using different kinds of pumkin. Our farmer's market is loaded with all kinds, and the growers are great about making suggestions for which kind of pumpkin to try.

I made this many times in a pumpkin but in late winter early spring, cooked it in a heart-shaped Staub La Cocotte. The first couple of times it came out oily (the pumpkin flesh absorbs the oil). This time it worked perfectly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. For cooking in the Staub La Cocotte: 4 slices cooked bacon, chopped; 1/2# gruyere; 1/2# stale cranberry walnut bread; 1/3 c dried cherries; 2 large garlic cloves, minced; 3 c choppped arugula; 1/2 large onion, diced; salt and pepper to taste. Combine in large bowl until mixed well. Pack into La Cocotte. Mix 1/2 c heavy cream with 2 pinches nutmeg and pour evenly over mixture. Cover and place in oven. Cook for 45 minutes.

Our favorite holiday recipe. I really like it with the gruyere cheese. We swapped out the ham for turkey,turkey sausage, and non meat laternatives in the past.

I love that this recipe is so versatile (or forgiving!). Have made it different ways, a couple of times according to this recipe, once doing ham and frozen peas instead of the bacon and scallions (much milder taste), and once, in a fit of creativity, stuffing the pumpkin with apples and raisins along with the bread and cream--added cinnamon. Got a sweet rather than savory result that everyone loved at this past thanksgiving.

This recipe forces me to change my slothful ways when it comes to reviewing recipes. This spectacular dish was different each time I've made it, but they've all been very good and each was quite the showstopper. I can't recommend it enough and have shared the link with almost everyone who has enjoyed it our table.

This recipe definitely lived up to all the hype. Wow! I made this for Thanksgiving and used a kabocha squash because I couldn't find a pumpkin big enough to feed everyone at the table. The squash was about 7 pounds, so I basically doubled the recipe (and added extra bacon, garlic, thyme, and cream for good measure). When hollowing out your gourd, don't throw the scraps away! I mixed my shards of kabocha with the filling, and it made for a very hearty, earthy stuffing. Sooooooo good. It took about 3 hours to cook, but was worth the wait. The end result was not only delicious, it was a feast for the eyes (and it filled my house with a very holiday-like, mouth-watering aroma)! I will definitely try more variations (love the risotto idea) and can't wait to have this on my Christmas dinner table. Thanks again, Epicurious!

I made this for a pot luck and it was a hit. I used a jarahdale squash (beautiful!), which was pretty big. I also stuffed it with wild rice with sauteed leeks, onions, and mushrooms (and of course the gruyere and cream). So I guess I'm not really reviewing this recipe. My squash was big so it took 2 hours to cook and because I was in a hurry I kept increasing the temp. I think next time I might try seasoning the inside of the squash a little more (maple sryup?) but it was fine how it was. I served it in slices like the picture and it was a great presentation.

Can I make this 5 forks? I used a package of long grain and wild rice just barely undercooked. To that I added sauteed shallots and mushrooms, 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage, browned and drained, and minced thyme. I cubed Gruyere cheese (but would like to try Fontina next time) and used the cream as directed. Everyone raved. What a wonderful versatile recipe.

I made this pretty much as written for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a huge hit. I used a 3.5lb sugar pie pumpkin and stuffed it with a whole wheat country bread, gruyere, garlic, bacon, chives, and thyme. I baked it for 90 minutes at 375 (it was sharing oven space with another dish), and it came out beautifully. I can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely delicious! Just made this for a "pre-Halloween" dinner. The first pumpkin was pretty close to the recipe, no bread but maybe 1.5-2 cups of basmati rice. Did more like 1/2 lb of good aged cheddar and gruyere mix, bacon, mild italian sausage plus everything else it called for in pumpkin. Cooked for slightly under 2 hours and it was wonderful. I did it on a cookie sheet and had no issues transporting to a serving plate for the table. Cut like an onion so it opened up and the presentation was great. Will be doing this again, modifying of course to try new things! I also did an absolutely amazing dessert pumpkin-- 2 apples, cut up cinnamon rolls, heavy cream, pumpkin rubbed with brown sugar and butter on the inside, then cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves mixed in with the other ingredients and stuffed. Sooo good served with vanilla ice cream and with my sweet tooth I think I liked it better than the main course pumpkin. Yum!

A hit with guests. Very comforting food - I made mine with homemade croutons from seeded sourdough, kale, swiss and local farm cheese, basil and thyme. Wasn't much room in there despite the size. Loved the flavor from the seeds from the bread. I used a 6 pound pumpkin, which yielded 4 small servings and plenty of leftover pumpkin to make soup with! Had to add more liquid during cooking to prevent drying.

Entered a contest with the ingredient being pumpkin, placed 4th. The dish was good, but not unbelievably amazing. I used crispy maple bacon. Cooked garlic to a light brown in the bacon grease too. All 3 cheeses mentioned hoping for more flavor. It was just missing something. Next time I think I'll add a bit more salt to the pumpkin before cooking and probably cook it longer too.

I made this to celebrate the fall equinox. We made it with farro (cooked in chicken stock for extra flavor), a hard goat cheese, lemon zest, kale, basil, heavy cream, and bacon. It was absolutely delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Tonight I made it again for Canadian Thanksgiving, but this time stuffed inside of a halved red kuri squash, and the grain in the stuffing was a brown rice medley from Trader Joe's. Wonderful. I like the nuttiness and texture of using chewy rices. This should be on everyone's Thanksgiving menu. I love how versatile it is, too.

Okay I have to make this, it sounds too good. What about the switching of brown rice for the bread though. Do I have to precook the rice? Unlike white rice, brown takes a while... will it be cooked by the time the 2 hrs is up? Thinking if I precook it will turn to mush? HHMMM.....????

I've made this recipe twice. Both times the flavors were amazing. My husband did not care for the recipe the first time, though, because he found it too mushy and messy. The second time, I did not add as much cream/milk so that all of the ingredients retained their form and were less mushy. The second time I used stale cranberry-raisin-walnut bread, gruyere and piave (piave does not melt like gruyere, so there were nice cubes of softened piave in the mix), bacon, shallots that I carmalized in the bacon fat, and arugula. I used half heavy cream, half 2% milk. It was terrific.

Oh, a keeper ... and then some!! Have made it 3 times, once for practice (when we absolutely gloated over it!) and twice for company dinners. Once it was the main meal with "Christmas sausage" (locally produced organic sausage made with dried cranberries and lots of holiday herbs in it) in the stuffing, another time an extremely fancy vegetarian (but definitely not vegan!) option alongside a baked ham. Each time it's been extraordinarily wonderful. The best thing is varying it each time according to your goals for the meal or whatever's on hand. Keep trying new options (the reviews have fabulous suggestions!). This will make a family heirloom recipe for many, many folks.

My husband and I heard this piece on NPR and were very curious because it sounds so different and tasty. So I made it last night and it is unbelievably delicious! I used an organic pumpkin from my CSA share. Used brown rice instead of bread, added carmelized onion, a chopped apple, sauteed beet greens I had in the freezer, a combination of cheeses I had in the fridge (swiss, cheddar jack and asiago I think)and evaporated skim milk in place of cream. I didn't measure the amount but it was not runny or goopy at all. Also used about 4 slices of bacon from my half pig. My pumpkin was just under 3 lb.and we ate the whole thing. You MUST make this - it is outstanding! Luckily I have one more pumpkin from my share, because I'm curious to play with the ingredients again. Then I will try it using a kabocha squash. SCRUMPTIOUS.

This recipe is fantastic and so easily varied to taste. I have made this twice now -- once with a pumpkin and once with a kabocha squash -- and included most of the listed ingredients. Today I used vegetarian bacon and added mixed mushrooms, celery, and toasted sliced almonds, as well as rosemary, sage, shallots, and chives. The celery and sliced almonds added a great crunch, and the herbs really enhanced the flavor. Simply delicious!!

I used a "potimarron" which is like a mini-pumpkin with a sweeter, nuttier flavour. I sautéed some bacon simultaneously with an onion to save time, used brown rice instead of bread, aged Comté cheese, Golden Delicious apple and walnuts and some dried thyme (besides salting and peppering the pumpkin first). I didn't want the extra fat from the cream and didn't think it would be necessary. It wasn't. Forgot the garlic but it was still delish without it. The prep was easy and quick, the only hard thing about this recipe is being patient while it cooks. After a full hour at 180°C, fantastic, filling comfort food. I read the recent review about too much liquid, I definitely didn't have that problem but maybe leaving out the cream helped.

Fabulous!! Left bacon out for vegetarian dinner and used shredded cheddar and a little romano cheese. I added sauteed onions, dried cranberries, and some chopped walnuts. Was short on time, so I cranked up the oven to 450 for 30 minutes and then back down to 350 for 45 minutes and 3 stuffed, small pie pumpkins were done perfectly!! Delish!!

I've made this recipe 3 times.. PROCEED WITH CAUTION! the first two times, I made it with squash, first a buttercup squash, and the second tima a kubota squash.. both turned out wonderfully. However, I was anxious to try it with a pumpkin, so I did, with disastrous results. The pumpkin exhuded so much liquid I ended up with a soupy mess after the allotted time; I currently have the scooped out contents in the oven in a lasagna pan in the hopes I can cook out the liquid and salvage it.. though it would seem it'll end up a huge waste of food. I'll make this again, but not with a pumpkin!

Time intensive, but so worth it! I made this recipe with rice, sweet Italian sausage, kale, fresh roasted chestnuts and walnuts, and diced macintosh apples, and it can certainly take all those delicious ingredients! Next time I think I will also add shitake mushroom, and double the amount of sausage and kale I used. I definitely like the kale over the spinach as it's a heartier green that adds a nice bit of crunch even though it's cooked. I didn't serve to present as I really just wanted to try this out, but I think if I do, I will try and find individually sized gourds to serve it in. I also salted, peppered and nutmegged the inside of the pumpkin before stuffing and added a lot more cream than the recipe calls for. I was a bit concerned at the end of the 2 hours because even though I had taken the cap off for the last 20 minutes, it still looked like a soup inside my pumpkin, but the liquid either evaporated or was taken in by the rice as it cooled. Had TONS left over (as it was just me eating it) and the leftovers for lunch today are just as good. A hearty, delicious meal!

Incredible presentation! Used left over cornbread dressing, some chopped scallions and about a quarter pound of Jimmy Dean sausage. Otherwise followed the recipe. Presented on a serving platter and got Oohs and Awes from all. Sliced with a carving knife into six pieces and let it fall apart like a flower. Served 4 adults and 2 big kids with a tiny bit left over. Next time I will make extra stuffing and add it into the middle after it is sliced.

This was a great Turkey Day Veggie substitute that I made with a few changes. Salt and Peppered the inside of the pumpkin. Used stale Rosemary bread that I had on hand. Omitted the bacon. Used Gruyere, Provolone, and Swiss. Instead of chives, added fresh sage, rosemary, and thyme. Added fresh about 1/4 c. fresh green beans, 1/8c. fresh celery, handful of roasted chopped walnuts, and a handful of dried cherries. Sliced into quarters and placed the pumpkin cap in the center in glass pie pans. Cooking directions were right on, and my little pumpkins were the belle of the ball in flavor and display.

This is fabulous. I tried it before Thanksgiving and then made three of them for the holiday. (they all fit in a large roasting pan) Everyone went back for seconds and thirds and all wanted the recipe. I made it without the bacon for the vegetarians in the crowd and I combined a sharp cheddar with gruyere. I'm sure it's great with bacon but it is not necessary at all. I also combined sourdough bread with a chewy durum bread...you really can't go wrong with this recipe....and, it's beautiful!

I set off to make it exactly as written, but then added much more cream than the amount called for. (Next time I might drizzle on the cream before loading up the pumpkin.)

I made this as part of an early Thanksgiving dinner for my family and it wowed! I used stale rosemary focaccia for the bread cubes, chunks of smoked gruyere cheese (I know other people have said they used smoked gouda and it was way too smoky, the smoked gruyere was fabulous but I did not use bacon), sauteed onions and mushrooms, and the cream, nutmeg, and salt and pepper as called for in the original recipe. I did use extra cream and half and half to ensure it would be moist enough. This turned out so well, I can't wait to try other variations. It looked so beautiful coming out of the oven. I baked it in a pie pan and just sliced it after it was baked. The slices fell down with the filling and everyone scooped up the portion they wanted. It was so scrumptious, I definitely recommend trying this!!!

this is fabulous. I did not want to do a "test run" on my beautiful cinderella pumpkin, so I used a smaller pie pumpkin that was half the size. This was a little too much filling for that guy. I added Kale and a harvest blend of wild rice and lentils (I don't like mushy bread). I also added some fresh oyster and chanterelle mushrooms with a blend of gruyere and swiss cheeses. The flavor was to DIE!.... but, it was way too packed to cook all the rice all the way through, with not enough liquid, so I removed the stuffing, added some stock, and baked that for a little longer on its own... next time, I will have a bigger pumpkin and will add a little more liquid to help the rice cook. Simply delicious! my favorite way to eat pumpkin. YUM

Even non-squash lovers liked this dish! I substituted butternut for the pumpkin and added apples, sausage and maple syrup to the recipe. FANTASTIC! Before adding stuffing, roast for 20 minutes with butter and a lite drizzle of maple syrup. Add stuffing and cream in layers to prevent squash from drying out. I will definately be making this dish again.

I knew I was on a good path when I saw this on Epicurious, then heard about it on NPR while on my way to the market for ingredients! I made this for two with half a pumpkin to spare. This really is plenty for 4 people. I used Gruyere and Rosemary Asiago with amazing results. I also chose the cookie sheet option for the presentation. It is a very rich and flavorful meal and I was immediately enamored of the idea of stuffing pumpkins and winter squashes. I am currently experimenting with quinoa, kale, beans, and cheese for a hearty, but perhaps healthier, meal option. I anticipate success! YUM!!

I made this last night using brown rice, spinach and gruyere, which added a suble smokiness to the dish even though I didn't add any meat. It was amazing! I used the cookie sheet option, which worked really well and makes for a very nice presentation.

Plus, if you like to experiment, the possibilities for this dish are endless!

first time I've ever reviewed, just to say this is a great recipe, mainly because it's so flexible. I made stuffing with three-blend rice, lightly sauteed chard and onion, garlic, gruyere and bacon (which I'd omit next time) and fat-free half & half. Amazingly awesome, and even the 12 yo boy, although initially suspicious, loved it. I've made stuffed acorn squash for years and it's a mainstay, but this is definitely a step up.

This receipe was hearty, tasteful and very visually appealing. I stuck pretty true to this recipe, but think my pumpkin was much larger than 3 pounds so I had to bump up all ingredients. This would be great with any addtions, cranberries, apples, nuts, celery, onion...as others have said, you can't go wrong here. I think you can get away with milk instead of whole cream as well, I used only a pint of cream and had to use skim milk to moisten the rest it was fine.

Please do not make the mistake of using smoked Gouda... in my haste and annoyance at the lack of organization of the cheese at the store I was add, I grabbed the first "G" cheese I found - a smoked gouda vs gruyere. Since everyone seemed to agree that it's hard to go wrong with this recipe and another reviewer stated using gouda, I decided I might as well try it... what a waste of what seems like a decent recipe and a beautiful long island cheese pumpkin! All I could taste was this horrible smokey flavor... I don't feel I'm able to review the other aspects of the recipe (other than I added slightly more liquid) b/c all I could focus on was the horrible taste which was entirely my fault in cheese selection. Be warned.

Dorie Greenspan, you are a goddess!! Made this recipe with pumpkin for pre-trick-or-treating - BIG hit (mostly with the Husband). Made it again the next Friday for a dinner party, but used a buttercup (not butternut) squash and it was just as delicious. First time I stuck to her recipe exactly, second time I used hot Italian sausage, provolone and added sage. 'Around My French Table' is on my Christmas list, but I think Santa may have to make an early trip this year!

Perhaps I am silly and did something wrong, but I just don't see what all the buzz is about with this recipe! At best, it's a souped up side dish.

And it took so long to make it, I'm not really willing to give it another shot and run the risk of having the same results. Two thumbs down!

I had a large Long Island Cheese pumpkin that I wanted to use so I made extra filling using the following additions/substitutions: I used whole wheat baguette, left out the bacon (sounded heavy and I wanted to go veggie), and included a bunch of mustard greens. I used scallions, no chives or thyme, fresh nutmeg. I loved the addition of the greens which cut the richness of the cream to some extent. Both my husband (a major bacon lover) and I felt the absence of bacon was a good thing because this is not a light dish. I would definitely make this again and agree with other reviewers that there are so many ways you could play around with the filling. I just had leftovers which were delish!

It was fantastic! I replaced the bacon with a mixture of sauteed portobello and button mushrooms.

Yummy. I actually made this without the cheese & it was awesome. I added celery, fresh sage & artichoke hearts & substituted sausage for the bacon. Awesome!! I made it again with the cheese & I think I liked it better without.

Wow, I just finished my second helping. I like many others adjusted the recipe to facilitate what I had available, as I live in a small town. I did splurge and purchased the Gruyere and it complimented the recipe. I used a Mahagany brown rice, fresh spinach, diced ham, sauted onion, dried chives and thyme, golder raisins, and reduced the cream. I found my version to be moist. Also, my pumpkin which I cooked on a cookie sheet would have been very easily plated. Can't wait till I use this recipe for a dinner party. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with alternative ingredients, as I feel this recipe is extremely flexible and versatile

most excellent! I made this recipe pretty much as written with the exception of using a buttercup squash instead of a pumpkin (couldnt find any suitable pumpkins), and I used a tsp of dried thyme instead of fresh. I used a mixed Gruyere, Fontina & sharp cheddar. baked it in a glass pie pan with no issues.. straight from oven to table, parchment unnecessary, and the presentation factor still intact. The squash being a bit smaller, took a tad less time to bake. With it's deep green shell and bright orange flesh, I dare say it was prettier than a pumpkin would have been. I'm not a fan of stuffing, but what's not to like about cheese and bacon? very tasty and quite beautiful. Will make this instead of stuffing for Thanksgiving!

I made this for Halloween. What a beautiful dish! I omitted the bread and added ground turkey, mushrooms, onion and apple. It made the dish a bit more hearty and was a hit.

Excellent recipe. Had a 4 lb pumpkin (thanks to the reviewer who clarified about pie pumpkins) and served with a big salad. Stuffed it with white rice, bacon, a mix of aged white cheddar and gruyere, red onion, thyme, DELISH! Even the 2 guests who don't like squash/sweet vegetables loved it. A VERY handy recipe to toss in the oven & gives you plenty of time to shower & get ready.

Impressive and delicious! It's a great way to incorporate whatever you have in the fridge. I made a variation with arborio rice, apple, walnuts, rosemary, and a combo of Swiss and sharp cheddar cheeses. The 1/3 cup cream was sufficient for me, but I probably got added moisture from the apple. I also slightly undercooked the rice so that it could soak up excess moisture

Very good! Used baby swiss instead of gruyere. Read the other reviews and agree that it was a bit dry, added some more cream before baking. Going to make this for Thanksgiving.

Very good, and definitely open to endless variation. Will make again - ours could have used a little more moisture, I might add a little broth next time.

This was really good. I didn't have any stale bread, so I lightly toasted an italian soft roll (about the size of a baguette). No bacon or green onions, so I used pancetta and 1/2 a red onion - and then deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of white wine. Used smoked gouda (to make up for the smoky flavor that the bacon would have added) and some chopped kale for color. Delish! I'm already thinking about what I will do next time I make this. I think I'll go the rice route.

This is an excellent recipe! I made a veggie version of it and cut out the bacon. I also used whole wheat bread with walnuts, which gave each bite a nice little bit of crunch.

Did not have day old bread, substituted stuffing mix, no gruyere , but had parano and gouda on hand. Used 1/2 stuffing and 1/2 cooked brown rice. Added dried cranberries, roasted chestnuts, and some dried ginger flakes.. it needed at least another 1/3 cup of cream and had to bake another 1/2 hour. I agee with the cook who likened it to risotto..but the best I ever tasted! YUMMO!

Trying this tomorrow. The Gruyere was not in the budget, so I bought a good quality Fontina instead. Going to try it with day old baguette, sage sausage, bit of onion, celery, thyme etc. Does anyone have any thoughts on the Fontina instead of the Gruyere?

Most interesting recipe I've come across in a long time. So simple, flexible and an impressive presentation. i filled mine with bread, cheddar, mozzarella, collard greens and chorizo sausage. I'm already planning on doing this again and filling it with Thanksgiving leftovers!

Has anyone tried this as an appetizer? Or think it will work? I am thinking of scooping it out into a glass dish and toast the top in the oven. And, serve with a sliced baguette. Would that work?

Apex, you can see from my review on 10/18 that I used individual pumpkins (1 1/2 lbs. each, baked for 90 min) and it turned out well. No dried out filling. Good luck.

Haven't made this yet - the forks are based on two things: combination of recipe ingredients as written and the versatility of this dish. I am considering making this for a dinner party for 6, using individual mini-pie pumpkins and serving it on pretty plates topped with paper leaves. I'm just wondering if the small pumpkins will mean a dried out filling before the pumpkins are fully cooked since you can't put as much filling inside them. I will likely experiment with one before I make 6!

try some beef or chicken broth along with oatmeal or barley. onions and garlic of course with tyme and bay, linguica sausage or perhaps spanish chorizo. now i'm wondering how a roasted beet might go ala borcht.

I can't wait to try this! To Drippin, no -- you definitely do not want to use jack o'lantern pumpkins -- they are not bred for flavor but for size so they taste pretty icky. Most grocery stores now carry pie pumpkins, and that's what you will want to use. Better yet, try your local farmers market!

Can I use any kind of pumpkin - like the plain old ones sold in the large bin at the grocery store that most people put out as decorations for Halloween?

This recipe demands you to be inspired. I happened to have a 3lb pumpkin sitting around (what are the chances) but I basically just used what I had in the kitchen for the filling. 1c cooked and seasoned brown rice, lots of parmesan, chopped fresh kale, chopped pepperoni, minced garlic and a little heavy cream fit perfectly inside. Since I didn't really have to worry about cooking my stuffing, I baked on 375 for an hour and the pumpkin was soft, attractive and delicious! The rice was creamy, the kale and garlic were nicely cooked, and the whole thing really did look and taste great! Better yet prep time was quick and easy. Looking forward to playing around with this recipe, next time maybe more cheese and I will better salt the inside of the pumpkin. I'm a fan.

Each year for Octoberfest I bake this on cookie sheet and everyone raves about it! My variation include sauteing 2 yellow onions w/12 oz mushrooms and add3 oz truffle paste. Add that mixture to 3 cups mascarpone, 12 oz Emmenthaller 4 oz Parmesan and 3 eggs. I use 8 slices of day old bread tossed w/ butter until crisp. I layer the cheese/mushroom mixture then the bread crumbs and repeat. Don't worry if the stuffing doesn't fill the cavity---it all works out. Bake on 375 for 11/2hrs. Perfect every time! and a beautiful deep orange color--a perfect centerpiece.

This was delicious and pretty filling. I'd be happy with it as a main course; it's festive and very flavorful. I used crisp bacon, some Rembrandt gouda, red onion that I sauteed in a bit of bacon grease, some fresh chopped garlic and rosemary, and lots of dried thyme and black pepper. Instead of cream, I used fat-free half&half (I know!), because that's what I had on hand. The whole thing was aromatic, rich-tasting, and very yummy. I bet it would be wonderful with a sage sausage in place of the bacon! I just had this as a weeknight supper, but it would be delicious with a good fall salad, a glass of wine, and some apple crisp for dessert. Who needs a turkey indeed?

This is delicious! The flavor of the gruyere cheese and the pumpkin compliment each other wonderfully, and the scallions and thyme add a special touch. This recipe is a great reason to splurge on the cheese; the nice gruyere I bought from Whole Foods really stood out. A couple recommendations: rub the inside of the pumpkin with kosher salt before you stuff it so that the flesh will have more flavor. Toasting the bread with a bit of olive oil is also a nice touch. I did find that the pumpkin needed another half hour in the oven to become truly tender, but that may be because I had a larger one than the recipe called for. Go ahead and fill the pumpkin all the way to the brim - the cheese cubes melt as it cooks, so it will be less full when it is done. If you end up with leftover pumpkin at the end of the night, you can puree it with a little chicken stock or butter and use it like canned pumpkin.

I thought this was absolutely delicious and the possibilities are endless. I used cooked farro instead of rice, baby spinach, gruyere, chicken sausage, lots of pepper a good sprinkling of salt and what ever else Dorie suggested and it was so good. The pumpkin stayed intact too which made for an impressive presentation. A wonderful Fall dish that I am sure I will still be experimenting with in the Winter.

This dish just blew us away -- it was utterly delicious, besides being a festive and creative seasonal dish. I used bread, bacon and white cheddar cheese in my filling, and I threw in half a chopped Granny Smith Apple and 1/4 c. chopped walnuts. It made two big servings (my fiance and I pigged out) with a bit left over for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be making this again over the holidays.

This has some real possibilities; I love the concept. Mine turned out pretty good but would need some tinkering to be great--a little bland so definitely more herbs, maybe some cooked spinach. I'd say the adventurous cook who is willing to experiment and possibly flop could be well-rewarded here. I used the cooked rice/cooked bulk Italian sausage variation (about 1 cup rice, 1/2 lb. sausage) and baked in individual 1 1/2 lb. pumpkins for about 90 minutes. Served with a salad of mixed greens with pomegranate seeds, goat cheese, and the pumpkin seeds I'd scooped out and toasted in the oven. Made an apple/almond paste galette with whipped cream for dessert and it was an interesting fall meal. Looking forward to experimenting further and trying the original bread recipe.

Sweet pumpkin was unavailable so I used an acorn squash, halved lengthwise and stuffed with the ingredients listed. The stuffed squash halves were placed in a glass baking dish, covered with foil and baked until aromatic. Removed the foil, baked slightly longer and served to a man who is not a squash eater...He is now. This is a great recipe that lends itself to improvisation.

This is definitely a keeper. Husband has declared this to be one of his all time favorite dishes, and guests couldn't stop eating it. Used rice and sausage as suggested instead of bread and bacon. Used a just over 3lbs sugar pumpkin. It took almost exactly 2hrs to bake (pumpkin was completely stuffed). Baked in a cake pan with handles that made it easy to serve and clean up.Will be making this again SOON, trying out all sorts of variations.
