I used this idea and replaced the egg salad filling with boursin or seasoned goat cheese/cream cheese mixture. It holds together much better. Slice quite thin as it's pretty rich with the cheese filling. Fun for a New Year's Eve snack.

Interesting egg salad recipe

I would actually give it a 2 1/2. It was pretty good, and the presentation was great, but I think next time I'll try adding some fresh basil leaves. It just needs a little something...

Very tasty, but not at all Japanese. I found that refrigerating for about 90 mins. set them up enough to make cutting easy. May I recommend at least calling them Mamemaki (bean rolls)? Negi means onion, so these really are not negimaki in any way.

These were amazing. A little difficult to make initially but once I got the hang of it, it went well. I made two types; one with the Prosciutto and one with smoked ham. The smoked ham received rave reviews from my family. This is a quite a tony Hors d'Oeuvre and I would make it over and over. I used more egg then called for and it is a bit messy but worth the effort.

Awful - wouldn't not hold together, made a huge eggsalady mess when I tried to cut it. Just awful. good thing I had a lot of other appetizers for my party. very disappointing.

Very easy to make - however I definitely should have used more of the egg mixture than the recommended one tablespoon over and under the beans - the end product was not mind-blowing, but a respectable dish to serve.

While tasty, I think the effort outweighs the time spent putting this together. If I were to make it again, I would not cook the haricots verts as they are tender enough raw.

excellent- very easy to make and my guest loved them. def. make the night before so the rolls setup (easier to cut).
