In addition to my previous note, here is one of many links with Corvina information: http://www.bombolinis.com/corvina.htm

I was stationed in Panama for several years and grew to love Corvina prepared in all its many ways. I was in charge of a food service facility and had many cooks working for me. Before that, I was the Director of the Navy's cooking school. Of course, my most important duty was to prevent food borne illnesses. Ceviche is not normally served in military galleys, but the many cooks I knew were experienced in its preparation. From them, I learned that ceviche is "cooked" in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before serving. Always. Although I have not used this recipe yet, I will this weekend. By this note, I am stressing food safety.

I agree 100% with previous reviewers regarding letting fish marinade. Would not serve immediately as the directions suggest. With that said, I made this dish with Florida Cobina as the fish and left out the aji paste. I marinaded the fish, celery, red onion and cilantro for three hours, and then stirred in cubes of ripe avocado prior to serving. It was exceptional!

This recipe doesn't make sense. Cerviche needs hours. This makes it seem as if you can just put the fish in the marinade and serve it. I would think this is more than a culinary issue, it seems to me it's a health issue as well.

Just a note about safety. I would never try this recipe because it is basically sushi and I can not get sashimi grade Corvina. I have seen a lot of ceviche recipes, made it and eaten it in many restaurants. Never once was I given raw fish that had been stirred in lime juice and served immediately. The acid needs hours and hours to chemically "cook" the fish. Don't try this unless you are ok with food poisoning.
