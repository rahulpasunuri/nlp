Made these for a dinner party and they were gobbled up as soon as they came out of the pan. I didn't think they were that spectacular, but never underestimate the power of a fried vegetable! I wouldn't make this for a dinner party again, though, since it takes a good bit of time to fry each batch. At least I would make them ahead of time.

The fritters alone don't have huge flavor but the combination with the dressing and lettuce make them delicious. The batter is supposed to be really thick. When you put them in the pan, press down to flatten them out into a pancake shape. Definitely use a nonstick pan and cook on medium high, and be sure they are very crisp before trying to turn them. These are a bit labor intensive but do get rave reviews.

I guess I'm really thankful for all of those cooks who came before and wrote reviews. I more or less eye-balled the beer to get it to the consistency I needed to achieve a cohesive fritter. I made sure the oil was definitely hot enough, and ended up with lovely fritters that were the hit of the party. And yes the Green Goddess is amazing.

The dressing is amazing! I will use it for many other things. The fritters had a good taste, but not the best consistency, as other reviews mention.

I wrote a long review and then the stupid Westin ad popped up over my text and I couldn't close it. So I will summarize: Dressing: good Fritters: tasted good, frustrating execution. They just need an egg and probably less cheese so that they will stay together better. I'd also recommend frying at a hotter temperature with an oil that does better with heat like canola or grapeseed. Medium heat frying=greasy soggy fritters. Better yet, just make the dressing and find a better fritter recipe.

I agree with a previous reviewer. This was an oily mess that just couldn't stay together. What a waste of good ingredients!

Made this recipe last night for the family. Daughter and I liked the dressing and thought it would be good on cucumbers and perhaps on salmon. Not that impressed with the fritters. Not sure why anyone else's were thin! 1/4 cup beer with 6.5 TABLESPOONS of flour made something akin to wallpaper paste! After adding the cheese and the zucchini the better was still too thick to actually stir. Maybe it was because we did not have goat cheese, so used soft herb cheese? Think the herb cheese added a lot of flavor but perhaps is drier than goat cheese would be. Added about a quarter cup of the zucchini water back in to make it even close to a batter. Needless to say they did not fall apart. The fritters were too salty for our taste (perhaps again the herb cheese fault? ) Anyway, I will continue to search for the perfect zucchini fritter recipe.

I made this for supper tonight and my husband and I finished the whole thing! I used spinach instead of mache because that's what I had on hand and it was divine! Make sure you use a non-stick pan - my first batch stuck so I switched to Teflon and no more problems. This a definitely a keeper!

The fritters did not hold together well and were a greasy mess. I wanted to try them because they did not have eggs but I much prefer the zucchini patties with feta that is found on this site. The sauce was wonderful though and could be used a dip for a veggie appetizer or in place of mayo on a grilled veggie sandwich.

By far the best zucchini fritters I have ever made. Light and crunchy. I will definately make these again!

Really enjoyed this - was in a rush so halved the fritters (for 2 - too much) and didn't squeeze the zucchini - just dried it on paper towels. Despite these actions it was delicious - oh but next time I would put in a second anchovie (or even the small can)

"Bum" Appetit - These were bland, and looked like road-killed frogs. At least we got a good laugh out of them but had to fix something else for our lunch.

we really enjoyed! we had to add more flour to get thick enough to hold and it is important to cook on both sides longer than you probably would with something similar, it might be the cheese, but they will fall apart even if one side is not really fried.

The flavor of the fritters was okay but the texture was rather goupy. Dressing was a little overpowering for the fritters.

I made the fritters as directed and the first batch was a mess. Turned out the pan needed to be non-stick as I do not have cast iron... The rest of the batches came out perfectly and the recipe was a huge hit. The Green Goddess is the best we've had - delicious! I'm not an anchovy fan, but followed the directions. Glad I did. You'd never know the extra zing was anchovy. Will make again!

Easy and wonderful fritters. Used a soft herb cheese because that is what I had.

After a couple of tries(wasn't wearing my glasses), I did add a little extra beer(Spotted Cow) and just a bit more flour, these were very good. I did use grape seed oil with the olive oil in case I needed to raise the heat. Also used greek yogurt for the sauce. Turned out great. Will make again as I have many more zucchini in the garden.

I followed the recipe as written and my husband and I found them to be mushy and tasteless.

I made an extra large batch with some giant zucchini fresh from the market, so I had to eyeball the amounts for the batter, I think I added a bit more flour... Mine didn't look like the picture, I made them thinner, and definitely it was better once the pans had been going, used hardly any oil vs the first ones were definitely greasy. But they were really tasty. For the dressing I would next time put a little less vinegar, maybe some lemon, and definitely use yogourt or nonfat sourcream for at least half so that it would taste less like mayo. But everyone loved it.

We really liked these fritters. I loved the beer batter, and the flavor came through very well. I don't think I added the full amount of goat cheese, instead I just eyeballed it. Substituted yogurt for the mayo, left out the anchovy, and added a little lime juice to the dressing, which we really enjoyed.

These are just ok - there are better recipes for zucchini fritters. If I make this recipe again, I would omit the beer and add one egg instead. Also could use some parsely and lemon zest to up the flavor.

Great recipe. Only substitution was using feta instead of chevre because we had it already.

I liked them a little smaller, maybe tablespoon-full sized, and next time I will go with a little less cheese. Served them with a little ranch on the side. Still, we enjoyed them, even my 19 year old son who wasn't sure about the idea went back 3 times.

I actually followed the recipe. I wish I had instead followed my instincts. The proportions were all wrong, and I ended up with a gloppy, greasy mess. Does Bon Appetit actually test their recipes before printing them? Maybe that's how they save enough money to stay in business, unlike the far superior Gourmet.

I actually made these bigger, and grilled them on my electric grill for zucchini burgers. I added a little more flour, chopped parsley, and used a lot less goat cheese (about half the amount suggested here). They were delicious!
