A real keeper Substituted thyme for rosemary and eliminated broth as there was plenty of liquid to sauté

zesty, fresh and savory. I would make this again!

These beans are exquisite - so different and so delicious. It's possible to cut the butter down substantially (1/2) without losing much flavor or effect, as long as one cooks down the sauce/broth to a thick coating on the beans (which means boiling the beans less at the start to avoid overcooking them). Really amazing.

OH MY GOSH! I could eat these all day - where has this recipe been all my life. I will make again and again - but with less butter (and I LOVE butter). The orange and lemon add a refreshing flavor and the rosemary just ties it all together. FABULOUS!

Such a nice change of pace from the standard green bean casserole we have every T-giving. The gremolata smelled divine! The sauce did not thicken like I hoped it did and I probably overcooked the beans, in the future, I don't even think I'll parboil (I steamed) or steam at all beforehand, they cook enough just in the sauce while keeping them warm and covered before dinner is served. I too used half the butter and a little extra orange concentrate.

I have made this recipe several times and always gotten great compliments. If you are in a hurry, just steam the beans, toss them with some butter and 1/3 cup of fresh orange juice and toss in the herbs and mix. Tastes wonderful and we will include it in our Thaksgiving feast!

This is my standard green bean recipie, and everyone loves it. Very simple, fresh-tasting, and a nice change. No need to use all that butter, it does just fine with half.

This turned out great! I used the zest and juice from 3 small oranges (2xbatch), and added chicken base to the mix instead of concentrate. Also, I blanched the beans ahead, made the glaze, and then poured it on top. This was much easier, and reheats really well too. I too used 1/2 the butter, and no one missed it.

Really a wonderful, different method of making green beans. I followed the advice of the reviewer below and cut wayyyy down on the butter--it was not missed at all. The orange gave it a fresh, clean flavor, and with a little tweaking (like leaving out the rosemary) this could compliment just about any cuisine.

I use veggie broth, roasted garlic and less butter with great results. It is easy and much of it can be prepared in advance. There is never any left - it is a standard at our home and a nice clean, crisp and healthy addition to a holiday meal..

Nice, unassuming accompaniment to thanksgiving turkey. I placed the beans around the turkey, for a nice visual foil.. beautiful color. The recipe was a very nice subtle clean citrus punch to the heaviness of my other side dishes. I would recommend making more of the gremolata all around and reserving more for the garnish. The chicken stock mellowed the orange and lemon juice out more than I would have preferred, so I would definitely add more of the juice next time.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving. It was just ok. Not worth the hassle of something that needs to be made last minute.

THe gremolata sauce was very thin despite simmering it and it just wasn't that special of a dish. Everyone ate it but nobody went for seconds at Thanksgiving.

the gremolata on this dish is fantastic. My only complaint is that there seemed to be too much liquid for the dish but that is easily adjusted. A wonderful flavor and fragrance. will definitely make again.

I loved the fresh crispness of the green beans and although all the chopping was annoying, the gremolata was excellent. I would make this dish to accompany any sort of roast or chop, and it did make a great Thanksgiving sidedish.

This was a hit this past Thanksgiving. The citrus flavors really added a nice change to the usual fare. I made extra gremolata just in case it ended up too mild. I did not fully heat through the beans when stirring with the sauce. I didn't want overcooked beans. Allowing the sauce to thicken on it's own allows you to drizzle it over the beans for a nice presentation.

We just made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and it was a complete hit! It was very easy and very good. I will be making it again at Christmas, and as a slight change will use haricot verts.

A very nice alternative from the traditional "Thanksgiving" green beans...very citrus-y flavored, and it tastes best when you undercook the green beans just a tad to lock in the crunch!

I must say that I tend to be a minimalist about vegetables; so consider this when hearing that I think this recipe is overdone. Next time I might just try it with olive oil and the zest--basically I wouldn't do this recipe.

I made this last Thanksgiving, and again recently for a formal standing rib roast dinner. Both times everyone loved it! It's great for Thanksgiving, because you can do most of it ahead of time. Also it's so colorful and fresh.. a great side to balance the richness of the standard Thanksgiving sides.

We've made this recipe numerous times and it is one of the BEST vege recipe we've ever had.

Great green bean dish. My kids (who aren't big veggie fans) loved it and asked for the recipe. What is surprising is how simple the dish but how elegant the presentation and the flavors? Outstanding.

This dish was a perfect compliment to our Thanksgiving meal. The combination of orange peel, lemon peel, parsley and garlic melded well with the green beans. This was the only dish we ran out of - so I'll make more next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year for 11 people. I had one person tell me they loved it and no one else commented. I noticed that 8 people ate their serving and 4 people tasted it but left the rest on their plate. I love citrus, so I personally loved it. My boyfriend didn't like it even though green beans are one of his favorite - he thought it tasted too much like lemon. I took the advice from previous reviewers and cooked the beans 3 minutes in the first step and they were just right. I also cooked them 4 hours in advance and chilled them in the refigerator. Worked out perfectly.

Made these a couple weeks ago and am making them again today for Thanksgiving. Deliciously different. Served them up at room temp and they were still fab.

Whenever I make this recipe I get multiple requests for the recipe. The kids gobble up beans that are normally cast aside and ask for more!

If I could give 3.5 forks, i would. An interesting combination of flavors that paired wonderfully with rib-eye. I plan to make these for Thanksgiving. I agree with the reviewer who suggested slightly less cooking time for the beans in the first step.

I loved this recipe and so did my guests. But next time I would not cook the beans so much before the final step. Maybe steam for 2 minutes.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved! We all like it so much, I'm making it for Easter as well. Not only do the green beans taste good, but the bright orange and yellow of the gremolata against the green make it pretty to look at! This one's a keeper!

My brother's girlfriend made this for Thanksgiving at our place, and it was a real winner. At first I thought the orange would get in the way of all the other strong tastes of the day, but in fact it complemented them and yet stood out on its own. Very good! I'm making it tomorrow to go with a standing rib roast.

Made this for Thanksgiving - a big hit! Even my son, who will never allow anything green to pass his lips, came back for seconds! I used turkey broth (from cooking the giblets & neck) left over from the basting liquid instead of canned stock (I think you could probably even use a bouillion cube in a pinch). I'll be making this again.

A WONDERFUL new tradition that will be added to our Thanksgiving menu. We all loved the fresh new taste. I prepared it the day before with my nephew who now claims ownership of the recipe! Very easy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and earned some rave reviews. I wanted to avoid the "green bean casserole" and thought that this was an excellent option. My only comment is that it was a little "summer-ish" for my menu, meaning that I found the flavors more suited to a "warmer weather" type of meal. I have already shared the receipe with three of my dinner attendees, so I guess it was enjoyed!

Rating: 3
Very, very good. My family asked me to make it again just 2 days after Thanksgiving. I used the small, tender green beans the "haricot vert" which I found in the frozen section. Who could argue with lemon, rosemary and garlic...what a great combination!

Rating: 1
This dish was easy to prepare, but I wasn't very impressed with it. To be fair, others at dinner thought the dish was pretty good. It may just be that green beans are not my favorites and that I've decided that I really don't like green beans. At least it was better than having the green bean mushroom soup casserole.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone LOVED it. In fact, my father actually saved the sauce to bring home! I think I added to much lemon juice, I would use a little less. I also think I used the wrong type of Rosemary (I used the tough stuff) but it worked out fine because I made this the night before and the Rosemary had time to soften. Try this recipe, it's quick and a fun dish.
