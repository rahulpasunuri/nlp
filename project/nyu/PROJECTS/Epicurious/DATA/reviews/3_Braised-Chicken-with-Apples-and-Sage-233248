A lovely weeknight recipe for Fall. Easy to make. One suggestion: add walnuts in the last two minutes. They provide a great texture contrast to the softened apple. Fresh sage makes a difference in this dish -- dried would be nice, but it will lose a bit in the process.

So awesome. I used regular chicken breasts and thighs, boneless and skinless, and its still amazing.

This was a hit last night. I could see where it might benefit from a little tweaking. I had to substitute dried sage for fresh. I happened to have homemade chicken stock on hand; so I am sure that altered the flavor profile from the original recipe. (my chx stock had celery cinnamon and sage)

This is one of our staple dinners in the colder months. I always add some apple cider to the sauce, and just before serving I add some heavy cream. It's delicious!

My husband and I really enjoyed this healthy recipe with some small tweaks that we learned from other reviewers. Out of our two young, picky were not huge fans; one liked the chicken only, the other didn't like either the chicken or apples, so parents of young kids, you are taking a risk, but I would go for it. My tweaks were to reduce the chicken (and skinless breasts), up the apple to three large galas, 1/2 tsp of cardamom, 1/4 cayenne, apple cide vinegar, lemon zest to brighten at the end - and more shallot than called for.

Made this recipe'close' to 'as written'. I added an extra Tbls. of brown sugar & I only used '6' chicken theighs. I tasted the sauce and thought it was not bad as written with the extra sugar. I was curious to see how the addition of 3 Tbls. heavy cream at the very end as suggested by some of the other reviewers would taste so I added some cream to the sauce. The cream added a nice creaminess to the texture but it dulled down the appearance of the sauce a little making it look cloudy. I would give this a 'good' and not a 'great'. I may make this again in a pinch because I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. My husband agreed it was 'ok / good' but not great. It seems like a lot of the people who recently tried this recipe, including myself {guilty!},have felt compelled to 'tweak' it a tiny bit.

I made this dish and followed the other reviewers suggestions by adding about 2 tbsp of sage, a 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and 2 tbsp of cream at the end- delicious. As to the philosophical purpose of reviews an the use of 4 forks, I find the reviews incredibly useful and one of my favorite attributes of Epicurious over other cooking sites. I can tweak a dish to my liking using the knowledge of other cooks, so I do not find it annoying but extremely helpful in producing a meal of my liking. If I didn't want the network of other cooks' inputs, I'd read a cookbook. My respectful opinion.

Am I the only one annoyed by those who review a dish only after they have changed up most of the ingredients in the recipe, and then give themselves a 4-star rating? (See jennaddenda from Milwaukee below) Seriously, while the new recipe may in fact be delicious, the review is of no help to those who wish to try a new recipe based on the merit of the original ingredients.

Perfect for a mid-week, winter meal. For two, I used only a leg/thigh each & one apple, but kept sauce amount the same. Out of cider vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar with a splash of Calvados - worked great. Only one shallot in the fridge, so I used it along with a fat elephant garlic. I served it with the cabbage recipe (from the same issue of the magazine) - quick and tasty.

I altered this recipe a great deal due to the fact that I was serving it with the Fingerling Potatoes and Oyster Mushrooms recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Fingerling-Potatoes-with-Oyster-Mushrooms-235160. First, I substituted molasses for the brown sugar. I also substituted mushroom stock for the chicken stock, which, by turns means that I substituted sherry vinegar for the apple cider vinegar. I braised it up until the last 5 minutes, at which point I stuck the whole skillet in the oven to broil on high so that the skin would crisp and the sugars would caramelize a bit. Result = awesome.

Just tried this recipe last night, but took the review that said there was too much chicken to heart: I used four chicken breasts instead, but followed the other quantities to a tee. It was delicious and easy; there was a perfect amount of apples and flavor. The husband and I loved it, and we'll definitely be using it in the future.

I agree with most of the comments here. This is quite tasty, very easy but just a bit bland. I should have taken some of the advice of others and added a few more herbs.

Rating: 3
Really liked this recipe, but that's probably because I used ~4x as much sage as they recommended! The combination of the sage and apples is fantastic. Used lady apples for a bit more tartness than the recommended gala. Would likely be good with pork as well.

My family liked the sage/brown sugar/butter flavors- the apples got kind of mushy by the end of cooking though. The chicken w Dijon mustard braise (also on Epicurious) still reigns supreme in our house.

I agree, it was a bit bland, but delicious. Finiky kids, though, seem to like it a lot. Next time I make it for me I'm going to make some modifications as well. I also invented a cocktail that goes beautifully with this recipie... I think I'll call it, the Spurr. ha ha. Take a teaspoon of fresh chopped sage and muddle it up with 1/2 a teaspoon of brown sugar, let it sit in a little more than a shot of cold grey goose for about 20min, flame it for 30 sec. Then get some of that "dry soda" - lavender flavor, and add as much as desired. Throw it all in a shaker with ice strain it and shake it til done. It's beautiful and a clean finish. If anyone tries it I'd love to hear what you think.

This recipe is a perfect family pleaser especially during apple picking season. The sauce which I doubled was a tad sweet so I added about 1 tbsp of cardamon and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. My family of 4 young children and one grateful but picky husband was thrilled. Fast and easy and loved by all. What more could you want?

Rating: 3
I took other reviewers's suggestions and made some modifications. I doubled the sauce quantity, added some apple cider, and used different apples (we went apple picking and dumped them all into one bag... who knows what they were). Near the end, I added some heavy cream to give it a little more oomph. Delicious!

I think as written it is a very bland recipe. I added fresh thyme, a little mustard powder, a bit of riesling and minced garlic to the dish and it was still lacking in flavor. If I do this again, I would add a bit of bacon, which always helps a recipe. Also, I didn't try to brown the apples, instead I put them in when adding the broth; I was afraid they might get too mushy if added with the onions and garlic. There was nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either. My 10 year old son, however, loved it.

Rating: 4
I think the general complaint about no taste is because it calls for so much chicken. I made this for my husband and myself using only 3 pieces of chicken and keeping everything else the same, and with that much apple and sauce available to the dish, it was absolutely delicious. I didn't have to worry about reducing the sauce down to a particular thickness. I'll definitely make it again, but I can see how it wouldn't go far enough with 8 pieces. I served it with a crunchy, whole grain rice and it was amazing!

Granted I am breaking in a new All-Clad braising pan, but I didn't get the chicken golden enough, and the apples were too mushy (I used pink ladies, a good substitute for gala I think). The chicken WAS very moist and tender, but the sauce was more sweet than anything else. I will probably try something different next time for chicken...

Rating: 2
This recipe was OK, but I don't think Galas were a good choice. The apples ended up tasting like chicken stock without much distict apple flavor. Will only make again if I can figure out some modifications.

I used Pink ladies intead of Galas. The tartiness gives it a slight sharper note and improves the sauce dramaticly. Ive made this recipe 3 times perfore. Delicious

DELICIOUS! I have been on epicurious for eight years and never felt passionate enough about a dish to rate it. This recipe is so, so, so delicious -- warm and fragrant and healing tasting. It makes you feel great all over. I've made it three times since discovering it and always make it with 2 boneless chicken breasts (instead of the thighs) with everything else the same. Serve with steamed rice. This gives you tons of delicious apples and sauce to spread around. Quick, easy, scrumptious -- a total keeper!

I made this for my 9.5 month pregnant sister (sage is supposed to speed things along). This was quick and easy and delicious- the key is the fresh sage and to really speed the recipe up, I sub. a can of All-Fruit (less sugar, more apple) apple pie filling for the apple and spices. This takes care of the "not enough topping" issue others had. I also added fresh garlic- 1 tbs. and a handfull of currants for anti-oxident power. Served over steamed brown and wild rice.

I made this when my family came over for dinner, and everyone enjoyed it. Not too difficult, and the chicken was very moist, but it wasn't anything to really rave about.

3 1/2 forks! I thought this might be too sweet, but it turned out to be a perfectly delicious, quick and simple chicken dish that even my very picky 11yr old liked. Great for a weeknight, though I'd have no problem making it for a casual fall/winter dinner party. Used boneless, skinless thighs and adjusted cooking time accordingly, which put it on the table in half the time. Also used dried sage because it's what I had on hand. Love the idea from another reviewer who suggests lemon zest and apple liqueur, will try next time- and there will be a next time!

This had a delicious flavor but I found the sauce a little thin. I would probably add a little Calvados and cook it down to intensify the apple flavor. A little chopped parsley and lemon zest to brighten it up a bit before serving. A nice homey dish.

A fantastic fall weeknight dish. Used boneless skinless thighs which cooked very quickly in the pan. Fresh sage from my mom's garden made the dish. My toddler gobbled it up!

I've had this dish twice now, and both times its been a knockout! I agree with other posters that there isn't enough topping for 8 pieces of chicken... The second time I had this, we used two thigh-drumstick legs, and I felt like I could have had a little more topping, but that may be because its so good! We split it between two people, with baguette and syrah, for a good hearty meal. I would recommend doubling the topping/sauce or using half as much chicken, but otherwise this is an easy, delicious dish!

Rating: 3
This was delicious but is not nearly enough sauce for 8 chicken thighs. Even very small ones. I will make it again but I would double the liquid ingredients, keeping the apple and shallot the same. Boneless, skinless thighs worked fine though... shortening up the cooking time just a bit. Served with simple rice, a green salad and a Chardonnay ... it was really good. It would also work nicely with about 4 pork chops.

I just made this recipe for my husband, and although it was easy enough to make, it was just so-so. Not much taste at all.

I caramelized some onions instead of using scallions and used three apples (one Royal Gala and two Golden Delicious) instead of two- delicious! Also, I only made four chicken thighs; I can't imagine how the same amount of sauce would have been enough for twice the amount of chicken. We were literally licking the plates clean - definitely a keeper!

Just grabbed the December Gourmet for an idea for dinner - we had all the stuff in the house including weeks-old Macintoshes and bone-in chicken breast. Well! I normally don't go for this type of combination, figuring boring & bland, but both my husband & I were pleasantly surprised. Will definitely make it again on a snowy winter night.

Delicious - Used skinless chicken for lower fat recipe and served over orzo prepared with with 1 tbsp butter, salt and pepper. Very nice and tasty! Great for a cold winter night.

Because I have to cook with no salt and no animal fat, I use other ways to get lots of flavour in my food, and this was a good starting recipe. Using skinless thighs, I omitted the salt rub and the butter and increased the olive oil, used more green onions instead of shallots, more cider vinegar and lots more sage. I used three Northern Spy apples and cooked all as directed, just added a final quick reduction of the sauce at the end. Delicious!!

Added a little extra garlic and shallots and used chicken breasts. My family loved it (including picky teenagers)!

I will try this again, as it's fast and easy. Kind of blah with the gala apples but could profit from (a) more apples or (b) apples with more punch, like granny smith.

Hmm. Sauce was really thin, and by the time it reduced to a servable consistency, the apples were just mush. It smelled great cooking, but wasn't that exciting to eat.
