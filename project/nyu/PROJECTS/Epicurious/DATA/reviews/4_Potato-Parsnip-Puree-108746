Excellent! Made this the day before. Used a food processor instead of potato ricer and it worked great. Reheated in the microwave after bringing the dish to room temperature. Served with roasted beef tenderloin and it was delicious. Great recipe.

This is fabulous. I've made it often and have learned that I must double the recipe to avoid disdainful glances from guests who want more.

Put this on my shepherd's pie with maple creamed corn...yummy!

Yummy. The parsnips add a subtle nutty flavor that paired nicely with our sweet - hot salmon

Divine!!! I love this. And I do not like parsnips at all (had a bunch from a CSA). My husband and I decided that there is no reason to ever make mashed potatoes without parsnips ever again.

I have never cooked parsnips before. This recipe came out excellent. I halved it, that's the only modification. At first when I cut the parsnips they smelled strongly of paint of some other chemical. But after cooking it went away. I used the food mill and the texture is excellent. It gives the potatoes a subtly different flavor, kind of sweet and nutty. Definitely a nice change from plain old potatoes.

I think I converted a few former parsnip-haters with these! They were creamy and rich and delicious. I steeped a sprig of fresh rosemary in the butter/cream mixture for a few minutes. I think the hint of rosemary complemented the parsnips nicely.

Easy & delicious. Used potato masher instead of a food mill with great results. Also used 1/2 the cream called for.

I made this to use up some goods from my CSA with a few minor tweaks (1/2 and 1/2 and SmartBalance). It probably would have tasted richer with full fat cream and butter, so I also made a ramp, garlic, parsley, and green onion puree to jazz up the dish. It was super tasty with steak and quite easy to make. Yum!

I have not eaten parsnips since i was a child, which I thought were awful. This changed my perpception and was a very refreshing.I would however suggest reducing the cream down to half for more body. It was also too salty for my taste after omitting one teaspoon of salt. Maybe try half the salt nex time, and add a little grated nutmeg.

Another keeper for the recipe file; it worked nicely with a roast duck dinner as the flavors melded well. This is also a very rich side dish -- a little goes a long way! Although I didn't have a ricer or mill, I cooked all the veggies throughly, then mashed them up before adding the butter/cream. It'll be a bit lumpy, but still tasty. (Or perhaps I'll try the mixer next time around...)

This is a very nice, flavorful recipe, and a good change from the typical garlic potatoes that have become so popular. I used a food mill rather then a ricer, and the texture was great. Reheating in the micro worked just fine.

Very good, and quick enough for a weeknight. I made a variation with sweet potatoes instead of the Yukon gold potatoes and it was also good. If the parsnips are large, it would be better to cut out their tough cores before cooking them so you don't have to pick them out of the mashed veggies later.

I made this as a change from a traditional mashed potato dish. I was a little skeptical but made the dish anyway because of its ease to prepare. Well, was I surprised! The flavor was wonderful. Suttle but flavorful. A hit with my family and friends. I will make it again this year. They cleaned it out last year with someone even taking some home. I never saw that happen with a regular mashed potato dish---not even with cheese!

I served this with the tenderloin with bacon port sauce (from this website) just because I happened to have a bunch of parsnips and felt like doing mashed potatoes a little differently. I had invited friends, and the first thing the husband told me was his wife hates parsnips. Great. Well, she did not hate this recipe! She took seconds and thirds and kept raving about it, and so did everybody else. Delicious! And easy to make. Highly recommended.
