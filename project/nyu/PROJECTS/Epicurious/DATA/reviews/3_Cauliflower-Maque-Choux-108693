I served this dish for Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments on it. I think it's a novel way to serve cauliflower. I did substitute whole kernal corn for the white hominy and didn't add any ham.

Bad, bad, bad. Who's idea was it?

This dish had a very bad texture and a very non-harmonic blend of ingredients.

Terrible. If anyone in Louisiana cooked up this dish they would be sent packing to North Carolina.
