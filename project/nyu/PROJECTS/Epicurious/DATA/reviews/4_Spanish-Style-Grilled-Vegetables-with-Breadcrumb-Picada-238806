The parsley vinegarette and breadcrumbs picada made these grilled veggies stand out as a side dish or main course. So many uses for the leftovers; we used it as filling for crepes the next evening. Delicious!

This is a delicious and healthy summer recipe. I have now served it three times to guests and each group has devoured it and followed with lavish compliments. You can make it in advance and serve at room temperature on a hot night or any night, which is another advantage of the dish. It provides a nice side dish that isn't as high in carbs as many others.

Amazing recipe, both in taste and texture, which looks great on the table. Balsamic works as good sub. Definitely try the trick given by a reviewer on the grilled vegetables/Harrisa recipe: "It's also a nifty idea to score the peppers, eggplant and zucchini with a pairing knife in a fine cross-hatch pattern with an incision about 1/8 in deep prior to grilling. For both the eggplant and the zucchini I recommend (after scoring and slicing) to use a buttermilk bath. Just take a quart or so of buttermilk in a bowl and using a slotted spoon, first bathe the veggies in the buttermilk and then transfer to a sieve or strainer. This should be done several times, and can be quite enjoyable - bathe, rinse... bathe, rinse. This will bring out the flavors of the veggies and help with texture as well."

Have made this twice and will make it one of my standard summer barbeque side dishes. I use my own dried and finely ground breadcrumbs. They work for me. The parsley sauce is exceptional. I blend it down to a slurry and allow it to sit for a few hours prior to serving, to allow the flavours to meld.

Excellent, beautiful dish worthy of company. Made exactly as written except reduced everything b/c of the number of veggies I had. Really lovely, very tasty.

Great way to serve summer veggies. I grilled them in the house and they were still good. Great for a party because the veggies can be grilled early in the day. I drizzled the dressing and picada on right before serving. Beautiful and delicious!

I grill veggies a lot and have never gone the extra step of adding a vinegarette or bread crumbs. Now won't make them with out it. Fabulous.

So tasty and so easy. Had lots of farmer's market veggies and this was a perfect way to use them up. Love love love the panko crumbs. Dished it up with fish and mashed potatoes.

Very good and very easy. The breadcrumb picada adds an awesome crunch to the veggies and the herb dressings lends a more sharp, precise taste. Personally don't really care for eggplant, so won't use that next time but will add more peppers and zucchini and other vegetables instead.

I'm fond of one big platter of grilled food to bring to the patio table. These vegetables with grilled fish and the picada strewn over all is wonderful.

Absolutely delicious - the crunch and heat of the panko contrasts nicely with the softness of the grilled veggies and the tang of the balsamic. I also like to use portobello mushroom caps, which soak up the dressing really well. Makes for an excellent, impressive, visually pleasing vegetarian entree.

This is really tasty. The little extras (bread crumbs/balsamic) really make this dish much better than your plain grilled vegetables.

I was trying to "one-up" my sister-in-law with an easy and elegant presentation of grilled vegies, and this recipe did it. Delicious and our guests were impressed. This one's in my recipe box.

I made it as directed, except passed the breadcrumbs and drizzle for guests to put on themselves. My husband has never liked eggplant and really liked this recipe and in fact asked me to make for friends again.

I found this to be a nice change from plain old grilled veggies.

A keeper--excellent as is but could substitute veggies according to what is in the refrig. The flavors worked well together!!

We LOVED this recipe!! The sweetness of the veggies, the tartness of the vinegar and the crunch of the panko were perfect! Definitely a "do-over!"
