Used this as a broth base for cooking marinated meats for a fondue party. It was rich and delicious, much better than a straight bouillon, and I don't do oil for fondue). Will definitely make again as the regular soup.

Yum, yum, yum! Just moved from a city with great Vietnamese food to a city with none within 100 miles. I used Thai Kitchen fish sauce and Dynasty mai fun rice noodles because they were all I could find, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Even my mom, who had never had Vietnamese food before, loved it. Will definitely be making often in the future!

I was so excited to try this soup and after all that time, I found it faily lack-luster. Followed the recipe exactly and was left with fairly flavorless soup.

Great recipe! I love Vietnamese food, and pho is one of my favorites. This was my first attempt at actually preparing a Vietnamese dish, but it turned out perfectly. I've done it twice already and plan to make it one of our regular recipes.

I made the beef broth today using my slow cooker. I halved the recipe (to feed two) and cooked it on low for 10 hours. It was absolutely delicious! I have abandoned my local pho restaurant in favor of this recipe. Thanks Epicurious!

Good but not great and certainly not worth all the effort (not to mention the mess) it took to put together. The anise-flavor I love was missing from this. I wish I'd saved all the time I spent shopping, cooking and cleaning for this dish and just gone to my local Vietnamese restaurant and ordered theirs--it's better.

Life is funny... I was looking for a pho recipe because MY favorite Vietnamese restaurant hasn't reopened as of yet (we must have the same favorite place) when I found this little gem. Excellent. A must try.

I simplified this mightily and it still was delicious. I had huge beef bones simmering and wanted to make soup. Here's how I simplified: Browned bones before adding water, simmered them for 5 hours then added cinnamon, peppercorns and fresh ginger and simmered another hour. Put cooked rice noodles in soup bowls, added very finely sliced red onion, basil, cilantro, fresh squeezed lime, very thins slices of jalapeno pepper. Poured simmering broth through strainer into soup bowls. Added salt and sriracha sauce. Pretty tasty and very easy!

This was wonderful. I've been missing my favorite Vietnamese resturant since they haven't opend back up yet and decided to try and make my own pho and it tasted very similar to theirs. I added cilantro, basil, bean sprouts, chili-garlic sauce, sliced jalepanos, and onions and it was truely wonderful.

This is the recipe that my mother uses and she is from the Saigon area. Of course, true Vietnamese cooks never measure anything but go solely on taste. That's how I cook all of the traditional Vietnamese meals my Mom taught me. This is about as close to the real thing as you'll get to authentic Pho. This sounds so good I think I'll go make a batch in the slow cooker right now. Note to cooks, dumping out the water from the first boil may seem like a wasted step, but its essential if you want a clear broth true to traditional preparation. I also like to add Sirachi chili sauce, hoisin sauce, a squeeze of lime and herbs like thai basil and mint to mine.
