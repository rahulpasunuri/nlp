Fantastic. More work than the typical roast, but worthwhile. I used an actual pot roast instead of short ribs and ended up removing all the liquid from the roast, made a roux in the dutch oven and slowly added the liquid back. I'll absolutely make this again.

OMG! this was fabulous. I took one reviewers advice and puree the veggies and added back to the liquid in the pot before reducing. THAT really made the gravy. I had a combination of short ribs and chuck strips(?) and they both came out moist, so tender and the flavor is fantastic. I probably wouldn't make the roasted carrots and caramelized onions again as they just didn't add much and I love caramelized onions. Also, 1/4-inch thick it too much. Thinner would be better for the onions.

This is not Pot Roast! Seared Short Ribs are not a Chuck or Pot Roast!

I had never used short ribs in pot roast and unfortunately that was only good part of dish - the short ribs were most and tender but the overall flavor was much too bland for my taste. Not sure what I could have done to spice it up a bit - another short rib recipe calls for sherry wine vinegar and balsamic and that may have given it a punch. I love pot roasts and briskets but will go back to my other recipes unless I can think of a way to make this with more pizazz!

Absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare. Thank you wonrknplay2 for the instant mashed potatoes idea to thicken the juices. I used 1 cup instant mashed potato flakes and it worked like a charm without adding any fat to the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe--delicious and easy. I made with a 6 lb top round roast which I roasted for 4 hours, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly including the roasted vegetables at the end. I also roasted some potatoes with garlic and oregano and they were a great addition. My daughter unexpectedly brought home some of her teenage friends and fortunately we had plenty of food to feed them. The girls raved! This pleased everyone and I think this will become my go-to pot roast recipe!

This has become a regular dish at our house... the family LOVES this! Quick and easy to prepair.. pull it out of the oven and it's ready to go!

For those who are having a hard time thickening the sauce at the end, I have found that adding dried mashed potato flakes ( boxed ) thickens the sauce brilliantly! I personally never use boxed mashed potatoes for anything other than as a thickening agent. Hope this helps =)

Used beef chuck roast instead of the short ribs, which is a decent alternative. Red wine and a touch of sweetness from port actually quite nice. Added some thyme into the mix which provided great flavor. I just wish there was instructions on how to thicken and flavor the gravy at the end. If following the recipe, the liquid is a little too fluid for my liking in a pot roast.

too much trouble for a holiday and it really wasn't as tasty as we all thought it should be - - comment from daughter - your brisket tastes better than this.

I have made this three times now to rave reviews. On the third take I got wise and skipped peeling the carrots and celery to save time. They get strained out anyway.

This pot roast was so delicious, and it filled the house with such an aroma! I used much less oil than suggested to brown the meat. I was also very tempted to add other herbs, it seemed too simple to end up more than average, but the reviews here on Epicurious convinced me to go with the recipe as-is and the flavor was just superb. I pushed the browned pieces of meat down into the vegetable mixture a bit, cooked the dish for about three hours. The meat was perfectly tender and moist. Like many others, I did not discard the vegetables (my guests were looking over my shoulder in the kitchen and insisted I leave them in). I halved the recipe, but only used about three cups of broth (which 3/4 covered the meat), and the sauce amount and consistency were perfect--it had reduced in the covered pot. I added parsnips and turnips to roast with the carrots and also some peeled and sliced yam about halfway through the roasting period. One of my guests actually took her spoon to the serving dish at the end of the meal! This is definitely my new pot roast recipe.

The taste and tenderness are phenomenal. Everyone at my Hanukkah table asked for seconds. I also had way too much broth/liquid. I used a slow cooker, set on low for 8 hours. I took meat out after 7 1/2 hours and it was perfect. Use red wine instead of sherry. This recipe was high maintenance, and clean up was a drag, but it was worth the compliments on the dish!

This was my first pot roast so I followed the recipe scrupulously. I think that the next time I'll use far less broth. The roast would have been overcooked had I left it in the full time and if I had not used an instant read thermometer 3/4s into the braising. I took it out at medium rare and it continued to cook while I tented it and tended to the sides. Not a total successful experience but one to build upon.

Used this recipe to make a pot roast. Very good flavor. Did not use 1/2 c oil. I used 2 cups beef stock with the chicken broth. At the end I also added 1 tsp. Kitchen Bouquet to give the sauce a little more richness. Yum!

This dish has amazing flavour. I made this using a rump roast,and followed others suggestion to keep the vegetables at the end of the cooking therefore peeled the garlic. I made a roux to thicken 1/2 the pot liquid and once cooked through added all the vegetbles back in, basically ending up with a delicious vegetable stew. This I served with boiled potatoes along side the meat, roasted veg and the other 1/2 of the pot roast broth.

Let me just say that this was the best roast I have ever had and I don't cook very well! I used a pork roast instead of the short ribs. I added parsnips and potatoes to the mix like others suggested. I did not use Spanish onions as others had said they were too sweet. I kept the veggies from the roasting and thickened the sauce with butter and flour. I roasted the carrots and parsnips and caramelized the onions which were yummy. My husband and sister were looking for more as was I. I highly recommend this recipe!

Loved this recipe. I thickened the gravy with flour and left all the stew veggies in. Skipped the carmelized onions/carrots, and served over mashed potatoes. I halved the recipe, and it was enought for two people with leftovers. Perfect for a cold fall day.

OMG.... there are no words.... :-) Really, really delicious. Just definitely try to de-fat the ribs, and to skim off the fat after oooking; otherwise it is alittle greasy (and cleaning up the pan a few hours later is disgusting). But, totally worth it.

I rate at 2.5 forks - somewhere better than Good, but not quite Delicious. While I had more than enough liquid, the top of my pot roast was dry while the submerged portion was moist. The entire dish felt greasy, even with trimmed meat. The family loved the carrots and onions. I've made several different pot roast recipes, and my favorite is still Nach Waxman's Brisket in New Basics Cookbook since the tomato-based sauce tastes heartier. Yes, I'm extending cuts of meat - these are short ribs, I made a pot roast, and I recommended a brisket.

I tried this receipe last week. loved it. I followed it to the end, except I did not remove the vegetables..I removed the juice and saved it for soup (which I made the next day). I made a mushroom/gravy sauce and poured it over the meat... I used the the left overs and the juice the next day for beef barley soup...was the best.

Great recipe! Did this with a in-bone, beef arm roast 3.5lbs. I halved the rest of the recipe except for the sherry. Had to add some flour at the end to thicken the sauce. More than enough for 3 people.

This was a great recipe. I did follow the suggestion of using red wine (Las Rocas Garnacha) and I substituted parsnips for half of my carrots for the roasting. I also made a gravy from the juices as well as boiling down the leftover juices to make a sauce. I think they were both amazing. I prefer the traditional gravy for the potatoes I boiled. I used olive oil instead of the vegetable/canola oils and I caramelized the onions with butter instead of oil. Delicious!

I read a review of this restaurant, chef Tracht and this recipe in the Wall Street Journal. I followed the recipe as written in this article. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12381 9733281561707.html The meal was every bit as good if not better than represented in the article. I purchased my rib roast from Sam's Club (you need to call ahead to order this cut) and denuded it myself. The original weight was 4.6 lbs and the remaining meat was just enough for four people. I had made the roast ahead of time and cooled it to remove congealed fat, but this was not necessary as I had removed most of the fat when trimming and next time I will serve it directly without taking this step. One thing is for sure, there will be a next time, maybe even this week!!

Never made a pot roast before. Very tasty! Used wine instead of sherry because that's what I had on hand, and didn't make the carmelized vegetables. Some other reviewers said there was a lot of "juice" in the pot, but mine simmered way way down. Not sure why.

This is a fabulous recipe and totally malleable. I bought Angus Boneless English Roast on sale (instead of short ribs) and followed the first steps of the recipe in order to brown the meat, simmer the sherry, and saute the veggies (in some added olive oil). I wanted to prepare this in a slow cooker and transferred the meat to the crock pot, poured the sherry over it, added organic free range chicken broth, and then added the vegetables once they were done. I cooked it for eight hours on high while I was at work and came home to a glorious smell in the whole house. I tasted the pot roast, which practically melted it my mouth, and it's as good as it smells. I didn't even bother making the roasted veggies, because it's already chock full of them. I'm serving it for dinner tonight over mashed potatoes with a glass of red wine and arugula salad with pears and gorgonzola. Yummy! A perfect meal for a working mom to make on a cold winter's night!

the BEST pot roast i have ever made and the deep rich smell while it's coking is such a winter treat, be sure to have some nice crusty bread/rolls for dipping

Great recipe with one exception... DO NOT DISCARD THOSE VEGETBLES after straining the cooking juices! After skimming the fat, puree those veggies and add back to the liquid to thicken and flavor. This makes a delicious "gravy/sauce". There will be a lot of it left over however, so freeze it for something wonderful later. Make this at least one day in advance to develop flavors

Made this when my butcher had boneless beef short ribs on sale for $1.99/lb. All I can say is WOW!!! Great the first time around, left overs were even better. The extra "juice" leftover went to good use in Beef Barley Soup. Sandwiches made with the leftover meat were in incredible! After sharing leftovers with my mom and sister, it is now requested that i purchase 3Xs the ribs, when they go on sale! We all plan on making this again. Side note: also freezes really well.

No one in our house really likes pot roast except my husband. He kept asking for it so based on the rave reviews I made this. I've finally found a pot roast recipe we all like. I also added potatoes to the roast carrots and the carmelized onions were a nice touch.

This was really good! I roasted potatoes along with the carrots but was happy with the veggies with the pot roast. I actually like the traditional "pot roast" veggies. Next time I'll probably skip the roasted carrots and caramelized onions and just add more veggies to cook with the pot roast. I'd recommend this recipe. Will make again!

I ordered boneless short ribs from my butcher. He told me they were $5.99/lb. so I was happy to order 5 pounds. When I picked them up, it was $48.00 and he said the $5.99 was for the "bone-in price" so nearly $9.50 for him taking out the bones! You can leave the bones in and get an even richer gravy and the meat just falls off the bones. Or you can use country-style ribs with no bones. Either way, TO DIE FOR! Delicious and don't skip the roasted carrots and onions; huge hit. The meat melts in your mouth. Make sure you use sherry as the slight acidity cuts the richness of the dish. Keeper!

OK, so last night I made this pot roast. I did a couple things a little differently. I substituted red wine for the sherry since I didn't have any. I added potatoes during the last hour of cooking, and I did the whole thing in a roasting pan since I don't own a dutch oven. My family loved it. I left out the carmelized onions and roasted carrots mainly because I just forgot but I'll do those next time, and I thickened the gravy with a roux and everyone was practically licking their plates. This is definitely a keeper.

I've made many pot roasts. This is by far the best I've ever made. My husband and his father loved it... especially praised the caramelized onions and roasted carrots. So nice that all the vegetables came out tender, not over cooked like traditional pot roasts. My search for the perfect pot roast recipe is over. p.s. Couldn't find the boneless short ribs... my butcher said it's the same meat as their "pot roast" cut into bite sized pieces. Worked for me!

We loved this. I used less fat to brown the roastas another cook suggested, and omitted the garlic. (We are not fans of garlic.) 8 cups of chicken broth was too much. I will definitely make this again, however I will use regular cooking onions instead of Spanish; we just found them too sweet. I roasted some parsnips and potatoes along with the carrots and this made a wonderful comfort-food dinner for a cool night.

I'd really love to make this recipe, but do those who have made it think that the 1/2 cup of oil is really needed? That is an awful lot of oil to add to a meat dish, from a health point of view!!

So, so, so good! I made this recipe for the first night of Hanukkah using brisket instead of short ribs. I cut the pot roast part of the recipe in half but made the whole amount of vegetables. Both turned out incredibly well. We will be having this again!

Excellent! This was easy and quite tasty. I needed to be just a little more patient with the carmelization of the onions but that's about it.
