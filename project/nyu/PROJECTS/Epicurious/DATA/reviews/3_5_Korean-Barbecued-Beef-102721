Yum - absolutely loved it. Perfectly balanced and really hit the spot. Wouldn't change a thing.

hmmm. concept is great. didn't like the marinade. the rice wine vinegar gave a strange off taste to the meat for me. Could be that my dissatisfaction was in part due to the fact that my broiler doesn't really char, but that was really secondary to the marinade issue. wouldn't make this marinade again, but will make version of beef wrapped in lettuce in the future.

This was a delicious marinade, a great way to make skirt steak super tender. I served the beef as Asian "tacos" on grilled flour tortillas, topped with a red cabbage and mango slaw, fresh jalepenos and fresh cilantro. I will definately make this again.

I loved this recipe, but I'm giving it only 3 forks because it's not really Korean Barbecue. I only made the marinade and used it on thinly sliced flank steak. Since I only needed a small amount, I didn't measure any of the ingredients; I just made it "to taste." I also added a splash of lime juice, omitted the scallion, and used Tabasco instead of Asian chili sauce. Since I don't have a grill, I stir-fried the beef, along with thinly-sliced white onion and bell pepper. As a stir-fry, it was really excellent. I made this to go along with "Mango, Jicama and Corn Salad" from epicurious and some baked tortilla chips (whole wheat tortillas cut into squares, brushed with oil and sprinkled with salt and Chinese Five-Spice, baked in the oven at 400 degrees until crispy). I will definitely make this again, perhaps serving it in the lettuce leaves as well.

I found this recipe and tried it for kicks since it was so different from a real Korean barbecued beef. And I should know because I am Korean and grew up eating, cooking, learning and practically breathing Korean food. The recipe is fresh and tasteful and I'd serve it to my friends gladly but I wouldn't call it Korean because it's more fusion Korean than authentic. Koreans don't really use mangoes, apples and limes in their food because they're not native plants so it wouldn't make sense for then to be part of this recipe (although apples are locally grown in Korea). Instead, they use Asian pears as sweeteners and meat tenderizers. Also, Korean food isn't based on strong flavors. It's about milder, complex flavors. It's very customizable with dipping sauces and added sauces (such as soy sauce based dips for Korean pancakes and added chili pepper paste for bibimbap) and that's what so great about Korean food. If you really want something spicy, add chili pepper flakes into the meat marinade and let the meat soak for one hour (it's a hit with my heat-loving friends) or eat it with kimchi.

Have made this a few times; tonight grilled the beef and served as main course for four; what an easy summer company meal...served with Bangkok salad from this site, garlic bread and a good malbec.....British Columbian peaches and cherries for dessert...perfecto...!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish although I think the meat would have been better if it would have been prepared on the grill, not to mention more true to real Korean BBQ. I didn't made the mangos but did make the apple slices and thought they were yummy with the dish.

My family used to live in Arizona and our Wonderful neighbor lady was Korean. She gave us the receipe for Korean Marinade and the apple and mangoes were not in it. But the toasted sesame seeds are very important! Very good on pork or chicken or hamburgers too!!!! I LOVE this and it always reminds me of Kim our former neighbor!

Lets make this a four-forker, eh? LEAVE OUT the apples, mangos, lime and rice vinegar- the first 3 are NOT very authentic! say yes to Asian pears, mashed up, keep all the lovely juice, too.. the meat is VERY important, as well- you can go to the nearest Asian supermarket and purchase all kinds of cuts of meat that are not only sliced really thin, but are easy to thaw in a day. Short ribs are great, and sirloin- it'll be sliced anywhere around the thickness of regular foamcore. or cardboard. but far from the taste of them! if you cant find the meat, try to go to your butcher and ask for fresh short ribs, as thick as a 1/4 inch thick at the most. Marianade that sh**! Grilling or broiling is beautiful! If you do the meat that is really "chopped up" in consistency, take some foil, wrap around one of those grilling surfaces so it doesnt slip around, or one of those flat, colander-like pieces, puncture surface with a knife every two inches by two inches and now you can grill it! the short ribs fit nicely in rows to make for organized grilling. Julienned red pepper is pretty as a garnish. And real red pepper paste from the Asian/Oriental market is recommended, too. Sriacha works great, too. Ssorry to talk everyone's ear off, but it really IS THAT IMPORTANT!!!

Absolutely a keeper! Used shirachi for heat on the fruit - fantastic! First thing to go at our BBQ.

Loved it! I grilled the beef and added mint to the apple/mango combo as the flavours were a bit more thai/vietnamese to me. I am going to serve it at my husbands 40th b-day party party with mojitos. I agree that it could use more of a kick but it really is lovely as is, as well.

this was my favorite. it tasted so good, except i cooked it a little longer.maybe 10 min. but thats just because i dont like my meat that raw.& i marinated it 15-20 min longer. but still very good

This turned out good, but I would have preferred it to be spicier, similar to a thai beef salad in a lettuce cup. I would add more chili sauce and spice it up a bit next time. Would also be good with chicken!

I don't really see what's so Korean about it considering my friend is Korean and thinks the ingredients are odd for a traditional Korean dish... but this came out real good and made the whole place smell wonderfully.

I made this for my son's class presentation on Korea. It was excellent. I used thinly cut stir fry beef (cut into slivers) and sweet/sour chili sauce for the children. All was gone!

Have made this several times now, always to good reviews. Since mangos are hard to come by up in the north woods, I've always skipped the mango and replaced it with an extra apple or, as one reviewer suggested, an Asian pear. (Don't ask why we can sometimes get those!) Excellent in an Asian appetizer buffet.

This was so good I fixed it 2 nights in a row! I discovered that I liked it at room temperature, dipped in the marinade, and we didn't have enough for much in the way of leftovers. I think this would be great as an appetizer, served on toothpicks with a cube of mango and/or apple, with the marinade and hot sauce for dipping. Bravo!

This dish was made for a luncheon of 25 women and was devoured and loved by all. Marinated overnight and substituted asian pears for gala apples--more asian appeal. Could have been spicier--just crank up the chili sauce. Yummy!

Last time I checked sesame oils don't have racial classifications, just culinary. Asian sesame oil is pressed from toasted sesames (stronger flavored) versus Middle Eastern/Mediterranean sesame oils which are pressed from raw sesames (lighter).

Rating: 3
Okay, so this recipe is a little racist (what's the difference between "Asian" sesame oil and regular sesame oil). Anyway, the marinade is actually pretty accurate. I'm not sure about the rest of the presenation though. What's up with apples, mangoes and lime juice? These items are rarely used in Korean cooking.

Served this for an Asian theme party and it was the first thing to go. I broiled the beef, which took a bit longer than in the recipe, perhaps bc I used thicker flank steak. Added a red bell pepper to the salsa per other reviewer's comments- combo of fruit and chili sauce was outstanding. Did not wrap as ther were 50+ guests- just let them wrap themselves. Outstanding combo of flavors.

I used flank steak since I can never find skirt steak. I pierced the steak with a fork and let it marinate for 6-8 hours, overnight would probably be even better. I also added some lime juice to the marinade. We grilled the meat and it was very tender and delicious. Finally, I used julienned red pepper instead of apples per another reviewer's suggestion and it was a great combination with the mango. Non-fruit or vegie eating son loved it.

I uses a flank steak, it's what I had, sliced thin while partially frozen, and marinated it for about 5-6 hours. It was so tender cut it with a fork. I skewered them on bamboo and grill them, and the just served with the fruit salsa on the side. I will do the lettuce wrap thing next time, but I just had too many guest to even try that! My Korean friend said that while not truly authentic, it was very good, and did remind him of the food his mom makes. That worked for me!

This dish by any other name is still a definite keeper. I have made it many times and my famly loves it. I have used different types of chili sauces each time to vary the degree of hotness for my guests.

I used this marinade last night for an Asian-themed barbeque. I added lime juice as one writer had suggested, and let rib steaks marinate for about 5 hours - they were fantastic - everyone asked for the recipe. They had a good bite to them, but they weren't so hot that the women couldn't enjoy them. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

A recent Cooking Light issue has a recipe for Bulgogi. We have had authentic Bulgogi at several Korean restaurants and found this recipe to be very similar. Check out the Cooking Light website and you should be able to find it. There are also recipe for kimchi.

This is a great recipe. I have made it many times. Usually, I just make the BBQ beef, and serve it with the lettuce separately. It is a great hit with family and friends!

WOW! Made these for our Oscar party - they were wonderful. Used small Boston lettuce leaves for the first 20 or so, but when I ran out of room on the platters, just arranged the rest of the lettuce, beef and fruit so the guests could make their own lettuce wraps. The arranged ones were beautiful and everybody exclaimed over how good they were. The do-it-yourself didn't work as planned - the guys liked the beef so much that the lettuce and fruit was ignored. I would either make the beef again, and serve it as an entree, or make all of the individual lettuce wraps. I actually thought the fruit added a lot of visual interest, though it wasn't strictly necessary or authentic.

Also great as a salad. Just mix it all in a bowl.

This was VERY good, though my Korean guests puzzled a bit at the authenticity of it. Authentic or not, everyone agreed that it was darn tastey. The meat came out a little tough, but I'm sure that was my problem for two reasons: 1.) I used flank steak 2.) My dull knife couldn't slice thinly enough (yes, it makes a difference--the marinade didn't fully perforate the meat even after a full nights' marinating) and, 3.) being allergic, I couldn't used kiwi. The next time around I will use a very sharp knife and slice the beef into extremely thin pancakes BEFORE marinating them. Delicious

Since this was one dish for a 4th of July buffet, I skipped the Bibb lettuce leaves and layered fruit and meat in a buffet tray. This was the absolute hit of the party. Meat was tender and flavorful, and the fruit was visually appealing and a nice flavor contrast to the meat. Wow! A huge success. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Quite good, but the mango bit made me a bit iffy on whether it would taste good or not. I wasn't too excited about it as I'd much rather just eat it the traditional way--wrapped in a lettuce leaf with a little bit of hot pepper paste--with some rice.

My guests loved this dish! I used the tiny heart leaves filled with beef/fruit to pass as an appetizer and placed the larger leaves at the buffet table. I doubled the recipe for 30 people. Not a piece left. I couldn't find skirt steak so I used sirloin....which worked fine. This marinade is fabulous!

This was a delicious dish!! I couldn't keep my husband from eating the beef while I was trying to assemble it! I had entirely too much fruit mixture left over. I served these at a cocktail party for 25 people. It was a BIG hit, but the guests had a hard time eating it while standing upi and mingling. I am making this again for a evening baby shower coming up. I can't wait YUM!!

This is a quirky spin on the Korean BBQ recipe. Traditionally, pear and apple slices were mixed directly into the meat marinade to further add sweetness and tenderness to the meat. Such fruits were then discarded. Perhaps in the past, fruits were used in place of sugar because they were more affordable. In any case, the best way to enjoy a Korean BBQ is to wrap your meat in (red)lettuce leaves, top it with a dollop of hot Korean chili paste before throwing the whole thing into your mouth. You then end your meal the Korean way by having that bowl of fresh fruit!

loved the marinade and the beef- not so crazy about the mango apple toppings wraped in lettuce. My family went straight for the beef and left the toppings alone.

Have made this dish twice and both were equally superb. The second time, instead of making the boats, I tossed all the ingredients and served as a salad. Either way, the guests loved it!

This recipe was spectacular...i prepared the marinate, fruit and lettuce cups the day before, and grilled the meat the morning of my cocktail party...very easy! my guests were thoroghly impressed by the presentation, and amazed at the delicious combination of flavors...definitely a MUST for any cocktail party (or even as an appetizer for a dinner party)

Wonderful recipe. Made it last weekend and making it again this weekend! Will become a standard beef preparation method in our house, for sure.

Delicious and easy. Can be served with beef at room temperature, so it's also an excellent prepare-ahead hors d'oeuvre. I diverged from the recipe when topping the beef: mango matchsticks and finely julienned red pepper (tossed with chili sauce and lime)and a flawless sprig of cilantro. Also let guests pour on a demitasse spoonful of reserved marinade. I loved watching guests' faces as they experienced the evolving flavors and textures. Going right to the top of my hors d'oeuvre short list.
