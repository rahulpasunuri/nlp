3 forks just because i did change the recipe slightly. I did really enjoy this though. the hint of orange and the walnuts made this different and delicious. I used slightly less sugar in the rhubarb portion of the recipe. As I had no oranges for zest, I used a very small amount of orange extract. Perfect.

This was delicious. The orange and cinnamon went nicely with the rhubarb, it was a bit different than some rhubarb crisps, but it still tasted like rhubarb, and was still a bit tart like rhubarb should be. changes I made: -2 L rectangular glass baking dish -baked rhubarb 15 min, then 20 min with streusel. 15 min might have been better - the streusel started to disappear into the rhubarb. -I cut the sugar by 25% -1 1/2 recipes of streusel (2 would have been great) -substituted sweetened flake coconut for walnuts

Loved the rhubarb, with 1/2c sugar and 8oz of strawberries. The streusel, though, is a streusel -- without the consistency of a crisp. I would use a topping from another recipe next time.

My guests liked this better than I did. I did not care for the streusel that much. I love sweet and tart things and thought that the streusel detracted. Looking for a better version for rhubarb. To be fair everyone else seemed to think it was very good.

Followed recipe exactly. Family liked it. I found it a bit bland for the tart, sweet I expect from rhubarb.

Wow! This is fantastic! I baked it in a 9x9 glass dish, and the rhubarb took longer than ten minutes to soften. I too reduced the sugar by a little bit. I didn't have quite enough rhubarb so after the rhubarb cooked I added enough strawberries to make up the difference. Don't omit the cinnamon or the orange zest, as they are part of why this is so wonderful. I served this with vanilla bean ice cream. A perfect way to enjoy fresh summer ingredients!

This was great with vanilla Bean Ice Cream! Will use this recipe again. I was taking it to work so I sort of doubled the rhubarb part and tripled the crisp part. I put it in a 9 x 13 glass dish. I forgot to make the adjustment in the oven temperature for the glass dish. In the Rhubarb I didn't quite double the sugar. Instead I used a mounding 1 cup of raw sugar. For the crisp I tripled the recipe. It ended up being a lot so I didn't quite use all of that. I toasted the walnuts and chopped them several times with the food chopper so were fairly small. Might leave those a little bigger next time. I had dark brown sugar instead of golden so I used part brown and part white sugar. I think I used about 1 3/4 cup sugar total in the crisp part. I also added about 1 1/4 cup of oats.

This tasted amazing and required little effort, which is always my favorite kind of recipe! I love rhubarb but am not a fan of fruit pies in general, so this was perfect. I did add a few strawberries and chopped apple pieces, but the overall rhubarb flavor was still great.

Rating: 3
Very good! Made with the season's first rhubarb, the amount of sugar stated was fine...the fruit was still tart,as it should be. Did double the streusel...which made a very generous amount. Suggest 1 1/2 times would be about right. As opposed to store baked strawberry rhubarb pie, which is always too sweet and more corn starch than fruit, this honors rhubarb and lets the fruit shine.

I made this with rhubarb I had cut and frozen last summer and it was delicious. I made double the topping, but as I had only 5 ramekins, it was a little too much topping. Was surprised to find that adding the full amount of sugar actually was very sweet, and if you're making extra topping you can easily cut the sugar in the main rhubarb mix. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe to a "T" & loved it! Especially loved the orange flavor w/ the rhubarb. It was the perfect portion size as I made it for my husband & I, & I didn't want to make a huge 9 x 13 pan like my mother's recipe. Very yummy!

Not nearly enough topping. Taste good, but topping sunk into rhubarb mixture when baking.

I'd never had rhubarb before, but it was one of the best desserts I've EVER made. Followed others' advice- less sugar, more topping, 8 x 8 dish, thin layer of strawberries. Awesome!

Rating: 4
Delicious. I made this with reduced sugar, as others recommended and was glad I did. I didn't have enough rhubarb so I used some red wine poached pears to fill it out and that was great. I also added oats to the topping and used whole wheat flour -- was fantastic. I will make it frequently!

I used the topping from "cranberry-apple crisp with oatmeal streusel topping" and added a pint of strawberries, sliced, after the rhubarb baked. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Delicious with vanilla ice cream. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and eliminated the cinnamon. Almonds are good for the topping as well. I've combined the rhubarb with both strawberries and with apricots. It's very good with strawberries.

I love rhubarb pie but decided to try this crisp. Easier and quicker to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the streusel but not the sugar. Glad I did. Next time I will aslo add a little oatmeal to the topping. I would also decrease the amount of sugar slightly in the rhubarb mixture. I thought it was too sweet but my guests loved it and couldn't stop with one generous serving!. I think the cinnamon and orange are great complements to the rhubarb. Doesn't replace my love for rhubarrb pie but definitely worth making again.

I added jumbo (coarse) oatmeal or oats to the 'crsip' mixture which I thought worked well. I also halved the amount of sugar in the rhubarb mixture - it was very tart and tangy but yummy. You can pre-prepare everything and pre-bake the rhubarb mixture and then add the 'crisp' and have it ready to bake while you fisnishing dinner. Delish.

Rating: 2
Followed recipe as listed except didn't have enough rhubarb (I used 3 1/2 cups). Most likely beneficial, as many previous reviewers noted limited topping. Toping to rhubarb filling ratio seemed good. I used the indicated amount of sugar and it did not seem overly sweet like other reviewers had said. Overall, ok but not a "keeper."

Absolutely fabulous! The walnuts make this recipe just that much better. By far my favorite rhubarb recipe, in fact, it's really the only rhubarb recipe I make anymore. I do not put in the orange or cinnamon (not my favorite flavors with rhubarb) and add either vanilla extract (homemade) or a third of a vanilla bean, scraped.

I used a single glass pie plate and didn't have enough rhubarb filling or streusel to coat the top of the crisp. The result was too runny which may be because I cut back on the flour in the crisp.

Rating: 3
This was quite nice. I've made it several times now. When I couldn't get fresh rhubarb I used frozen -- it worked alright but much nicer flavour with fresh, obviously. I also used toasted pecans rather than walnuts, and mixed in some strawberries as well.

Rating: 3
Mmm...I've never cooked rhubarb before, so it was all new to me. Used an 8x8 instead of ramekins, worked fine. I would use less sugar (others have suggested 2/3 the total amount) and more nuts next time. Also, one of my rhubarb stalks felt too spongy, so I replaced it with about 1/2 c. strawberries. Tasted great!

I love this recipe and have made it several times over the years. I can't consistently get good rhubarb - unless my grandmother sends it to me - but I was delighted to find it recently at a great price. My 5 yr old daughter adores this crisp, and it inspired me to plant some in my garden! I generally add a bit more orange zest, which really makes it unique. I'm going to venture and try the buttermilk ice cream this weekend for friends.

I needed a quick dessert for a sunday night dinner and this perfectly fit the bill. I could make it with ingredients I had on hand and it took only minutes to put together. I halved the rhubarb but made the full recipe for the topping. It was great.

My husband, who professed his dislike for all things rhubarb, LOVED this dish. In the rhubarb mixture, I used Splenda baking sugar (which is 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar), omitted the butter, substituted the orange rind with 1/4 tsp. orange oil, and replaced the cinnamon with cardamom. To the topping, I added 1/3 c. quick oats. I baked the whole thing according to the recipe, using a buttered 8 x 11 baking dish. Delicious!

Rating: 1
I took the comments from others into account. Since I had about 1/2 the amount of rhubarb I halved this part and made a full topping recipe using a 7x11 inch pan. The topping was about enough. The orange peel offered a nice flavor to the rhubarb, but overall, it was way too sweet and I probably won't make this again.

Rating: 3
This was a huge hit. To feed ten people with leftovers, I doubled the rhubarb mixture, tripled the crisp (including the sugar, since I was making it for people who had never had rhubarb before, so wanted something sweet), and cooked it in a 9-by-13 pan. Delicious!

Rating: 4
OH MY GOD!!!! This was absolutly delish. I didn't have quite enough fresh rhubarb so added about 2 c sliced strawberries and an extra tbsp of flour. Doubled the topping with pecans instead oof walnuts. Talk about fab. I took it to a crab dinner and that was all we had. Crab and rhubarb crisp. This one is definately going in my recipe box :}

I like my rhubarb "straight up" so I thought the cinnamon did not compliment the rhubarb like it does w' apples. I also didn't like the walnuts in it. Based on some of the previous comments I was expecting this to taste like "rhubarb pie w/o the work." It was tasty, just don't expect it to taste like pie and leave out the cinnamon.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews from everyone. I also used a 9x13 glass dish and doubled the streusel (but not the sugar)and used pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I think I'll triple the streusel, though - it was a little skimpy in the big dish. A definite keeper.

Really good recipe! Quick to make and tasty. I used a 9x13 glass pan instead of individual ramekins and it worked just fine. Served it with the Buttermilk Ice Cream which was a perfect compliment.

Fabulous recipe--can't stop making (or eating) it. All the taste of rhubarb pie without the extra work of the pastry. I make it in a round casserole, skip the two-stage part of the baking process, just bake approx. 35 min. until the juice is bubbling on top. Perfect every time!

Excellent. Very good, easy and quick to make.I uses rhubarb and strawberries, very delicious. Raspberries would be excellent too. I used vanilla bean ice cream. awesome

Rating: 4
This is a great rhubarb recipe. I too doubled the streusel but left the sugar amount at 2/3 cup - perfect. I made it in an oval casserol dish, following another cooks recommendation for baking the rhubarb for 20-30 mins. Next time I might add some raspberries (which I also have a surplus of in the garden).

Great recipe...Kids begged for thirds. Served it with Devonshire cream. Doubled the streusel as advised.

Rating: 4
I took the other reviewer's advice and doubled the recipe for the crisp, except for the sugar, I left that amount the same. It turned out great! I also made it in a 9x13 pan instead of the ramikens. I baked the rhubarb for 20 - 30 minutes instead of 10, then added the crisp part and baked for another 20 minutes. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
I should have listened to the other reviews. I didn't cut back on the sugar and I thought it was too much in the fruit. My husband, however, who has a huge sweet tooth loved it! Definitely double the crisp recipe like other reviewer suggested -it needs it. I also used pecans did not have walnuts. Very delicious. Would have made the ice cream but I do not have a maker. I ate it without any ice cream, but I think it would have been even better served with it. Very good!!

I have not made the rhubarb crisp recipe yet (but I plan to do so soon), but the buttermilk ice cream recipe from from the October 2002 issue of Bon Appetit (also in this database) with a fruit compote is very good. It still calls for 6 egg yolks but the liquid is increased by 50%. It also calls for a vanilla bean and a touch of chili powder. I might consider deleting the chili powder when I make it again for the crisp.

Rating: 3
I've tried a lot of fruit recipes for rhubarb pies, tarts, crisps, etc, but this is the best one yet! The crisp was pretty good too but there wasn't enough. Next time I think I will double the crisp recipe.

Rating: 4
I reduced the sugar in the topping by 50%, but left it as is in the rhubarb. It was excellent. The crisps are great. Due to time constraints we used commercial vanilla ice cream and it was a wonderful combination. I'll definitely make this again. I was raised on rhubarb pie, but this may be my new favorite rhubarb dessert.

Rating: 3
I made only the crisps. They turned out well but I think I would use less sugar in both the fruit and the topping. Will make again.

Rating: 3
The crisps were out of this world. Will definitely make again and again. The ice cream was another story. Six egg yolks must be a mistake. We could only eat a scoop the size of a melon ball it was SO RICH - and I love rich desserts! I'll tone down the ice cream recipe and try again because the flavor was terrific. Anyone else think it was way too rich?
