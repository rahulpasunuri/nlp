Is it really necessary to use a food review forum to push your political views?

Oh boy!!! My favorite kind of recipe. LOW effort and HIGH reward. Kids loved a slushy dessert, that was *almost* as healthy as that 64 billion ounce frozen alien shaving cream you can get at the local seven-11. Super fun and super fast. I will certainly make this when I have a great melon again! Love it! I think I will serve it in shot glasses as an apertif at my next party, perhaps with some sort of chili element, as I think it would play great as a foil to something spicy. So refreshing and simple and hip, what more could you ask for, well, there are a lot ot things I am hoping for, I guess, like seeing Obama elected, but ok, ok, I will try to just enjoy my adult slushie, and hopefully you will too.

Delicious, easy and very quick -- a terrific dessert for last minute or casual company.

really easy to make, and somehow, tasted more like a cantaloupe than an actual cantaloupe

Simple and tasty. All the "special" things you need are a blender and the time it takes to freeze (well, and a cantaloupe). This will taste pretty much like the cantaloupe does, so use a ripe one. The texture/temperature is why you make this instead of just eating cantaloupe. Even if you don't like it, you'll still have half the cantaloupe left to eat ;-)

Scrumptious and innovative way to serve cantaloupe - company worthy. Lovely presentation and refreshing flavour. To cooks from Paris and CT: Why is it necessary to split hairs about the origin of this melon? All North American cooks know what a cantaloupe is even though it may be correctly termed a musk melon. And, I am sure those cooks outside N.A. will be able to figure it out. After all, there is a food dictionary on this site that is only a click away should anyone be confused.

To Cook from CT: check your facts. The "real" Canteloupe is a small blue-veined melon from Armenia (mostly). And "musk" melon is a collective term for several melons, including what we call canteloupes (and honeydew).

Quick, easy, refreshing, elegant and very delicious! I served in large martini glasses, garnished with mint sprigs and drizzled a splash of melon liqueur over for a little added zing. To cook Atenawise: Did you make this recipe? There is only 1/4 cup of sugar for 4 people, about 2-1/4 teaspoons each serving. Hardly the exhorbitant amount you seem to suggest. Yes, it would be simpler just to eat a wedge of cold cantaloupe, but then you would be missing out on the enjoyment the lovely icy/slushy texture this granita provides. Depending on the sweetness/ripeness of the melon, sugar could be reduced to suit one's taste.

just so all you cooks know- the 'cantaloupe' is a melon grown in france and is illegal to import to the USA. Therfore the american term 'cantaloupe' refers to the musk melon, a sweet soft melon distict for its smooth bright orange fruit and contrasting textured green rind.

This is a luscious granita. It has a thicker, slightly syrupy texture compared with watermelon granita.

I made this with half cantelouple and half honeydew (needed to eat them up!). It was very light and refreshing; I'll definitely make this dessert again.

What a wonderful alternative to those sugar filled grocery store options and easy too. I am diabetic and this recipe, with a quick exchange sugar for splenda, is a great treat. Bonus the kids love it too.

After my husband and I ate a wonderful grilled Salmon dinner, this was the perfect dessert for an end to a hot night in the Arizona desert!

This is fabulous. It is the easiest way to get an authentic taste of Italy at home. Those of us in hot climates appreciate the most flavorful ways to stay cool. The sugar is "to taste" so add as much or as little as you like!

Made with a sweet, ripe cantaloupe this very easy recipe is sweet-tooth satisfying on a hot summer night.

This caught my eye because I have a newborn and am religiously following the South Beach diet, but still have a hankering for sweets at night. This was yummy made with bulk Splenda to make it South Beach appropriate. I am sure it is even better with sugar! This may become a staple at our house this summer. I am going to try it with other fruits as well - I think raspberries next!

I would never understand why should I fill myself and family with sugar, when it is much simpler to eat the cantaloupe as it is.

This is a wonderfully light dessert- perfect for summer! It's really easy and my entire family loved it.
