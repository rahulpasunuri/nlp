My Irish grandmother used to make scones like these. This is the best raisin scone recipe I have found. Traditionally they are not meant to be sweet. These are butter and jam scones not coffee house scones.The dough is much more dry. Throw in an egg if you'd like a wetter dough. I roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick and slice into triangles. When they're baked they should be very flaky. The top should break away form the bottom without having to use a knife. Butter and jam. Yum!

Very moist and tender!! I made these exactly as directed except for the raisins. I don't like raisins and I'm tired of cranberries. So instead I added finely chopped dried pears (the moist chewey kind, NOT the freeze-dried crispy kind) and minced candied ginger. The best scone recipe I've tried!

I've made these scones now for every bunch of nurses I've worked with (I'm a nurse myself now, but these really helped me get on the good side of the nurses I worked with throughout my education.) I find it easy to alter this recipe for myself (substituting 1/2 whole wheat flour) or to doctor it up with orange zezt and cranberries for delicicious alternatives (those went over like CRAZY!) I cut them into small triangles and also either press them into sugar or glaze them with confectioner's sugar icing for a real coup de grace. Also, I ad about 1/4 c sugar to the mix.

As long as you don't make them too small or cook them too long (they become too dry and crumbly) this recipe is a must!! Absolutely delicious, you can't not have these with clotted cream and strawberry jam!

I have made this for the nurses on my unit (I'm a student nurse) and let me tell you how fast they went! (F A S T!) The fact that they are not too sweet was very appreciated by a staff that is usually thanked in donuts. I did change the way I cut them out (as I was living in a dorm with no cooking stuff and didn't have anything to cut them with) I rolled them out and cut them into triangles, then pat them in sugar and baked them. When out of the oven, I drizzled them with confectioner's sugar and a little rice milk mixed into a frosting (not too much, just zig-zagged along the top) and the nurses would NOT believe I made them (they thought I had purchased them and was joking) They asked me to make these several times and a few of them asked for the recipe, which I was glad to print out from epicurious! If you're looking for a not-too-sweet treat, this is a good one :)

I've been making these ever since the recipe was published and they are my family's favorites. So I was suprised to see all the negative reviews...we are at high altitude, maybe that makes a difference. Plus we prefer our scones not too sweet. Love these! Excellent with the lemon curd if you do want a sweet touch.

This recipe is too bland, it would taste alot better with say 1/2 c sugar.

Too much baking powder in recipe. Predominant taste. Will not make it again.

Agree that these are very English tasting. Always wanted a recipe to try at home. Would like them a little sweeter. Maybe I'll brush with milk and sprinkle sugar on top next time. If you got tough results, follow the advice given by others here--don't handle the dough so much. The ingredients should just hold together. Same goes for when you make Irish Soda Bread. Don't let the word bread fool you into kneading too much.

Dry and dull.

For all those who say that their scones came out dry, you handled them too much. You should work them just enough to make them hold together, and scones aren't known for being moist.

Simply dreadful. After tasting these scones I went back to the recipe to double check that I did not mess it up. These scones turned out dry and tough. It seemed as though some combination of less flour, more milk or more butter was needed

I added 2 tsp of brown sugar for the right touch of sweetness to my taste. Used my food processor on pulse and did small batches to incorporate the butter; after adding the milk I handled the dough as little as possible, kneading it only until the dough held together. Too much handling creates gluten and the baked results are tough instead of light. Next time I'll try it with the buttermilk instead of sweet milk.

This recipe was a disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of 3 Tbsp of sugar. The dough was too dry and it's clear that more milk, or less flour, is called for. The resulting scones were tough. I can't believe these were actually test-baked in Gourmet's kitchen.

I didn't like the lack of sugar. Mine ended up tasting like a biscuit.

Lovely, light recipe & a very English taste. Liked the lack of sugar....raisin scones don't really need it. I substituted low fat buttermilk for half the milk. This adds a little English North Country authenticity to the taste.
