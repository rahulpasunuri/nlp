Wasn't crazy about so much frisee, next time I will make it with a mixture of lettuce. Great flavor. Disagree with earlier revue, I definately tasted the saffron.

well i cant wait to be the first to review!! this meal was extremely simple and flavorful although i couldnt taste ANY saffron , and for the price, its just as well to leave it out. the thyme and (hungarian hot) paprika did just fine for flavor. i did change a few things, for my own pleasure. i ran out of fresh thyme to dredge chicken so it didnt go on before cooking. i also have a passion for wilted spinach salad and thought it would be different idea to heat the dressing before drizzling on the salad. i used a combo of spinach and arugula that my supermarket has in pre-mixed bags. next time i would toss hot dressing on salad mix to incorporate flavors better..i would also cut down on the shallots if you dont have a strong tummy..i was plagued all night with heartburn, but it was worth it.
