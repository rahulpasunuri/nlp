Not bad -- but not wonderful either. I expected it to be more of a spinach gratin with the semolina acting as a binder, but it turned out be more of a doughy pasta with a little spinach added. Plan to keep looking for a good spinach gratin.

Had this last night and both my husband and I like it. It had good flavor. I did add a little more spinach and parmesan than called for. You could even double the nutmeg because it doesn't come through at all. I have never used semolina flour before and wondered if it really needed to cook for 5 minutes. Mine was really thick and bubbly in about 1 minute. It couldn't have gotten any thicker. I'm just not quite sure what the final texture was supposed to like. The gratin was set and browned and the best part was around the crusty edges.

We were counting on a winner having read all the reviews. However, it was a disappointment. It was bland and floury. Perhaps needs more cheese and spinach.

This is a good recipe and an innovative idea. I think readers need to use their imaginations and adapt recipes to their own tastes. I have made this with asparagus as well as other greens (chard, kale etc) and other spicy additions could be made (onions, garlic). It makes a great breakfast !

I loved this! I am surprised by the other reviews. I thought the flavor and texture was really nice and a great alternative to creamed spinach. I am making it again for Thanksgiving!

The gratin was easy to make, but I found it dull and lifeless. I wouldn't bother again. There are much more interesting gratins in the world.

I tripled the recipe for a large group. It is delicious, but I wonder if I did something wrong. It was quite heavy and didn't rise much.

Very easy to make, good with the pork medallions from the same menu.
