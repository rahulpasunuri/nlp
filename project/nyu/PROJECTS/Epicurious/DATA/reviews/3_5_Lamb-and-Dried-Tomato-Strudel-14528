Very good. I omitted the olives and used boneless leg of lamb cut up into 1/2" cubes (in place of ground lamb). I made it for our "Lamb Jam" party last night, which was a lamb themed party where we asked guests to bring a lamb dish (amongst other things). Everyone at the party voted it as the best lamb dish of all. I was somewhat intimidated by the instructions because they were hard for me to picture, but once I started making it, it was easy. I made the lamb filling a couple of days prior to assembling the strudels.

very delicious even without the olives-have served this for both an appetizer and dinner

I made this for a party, and put the filling into small phyllo roll-ups so it became finger food! I would use fewer olives next time. With the olives, it was quite salty, so I omitted any added salt. I used fresh rosemary. If you make these as individual packets, the oven temperature can be lowered to 375.

I didn't have enough olives on hand and used capers instead. They worked fine, but the dish still needed salt. i make 2 strudels for 4 and it was very filling. I also used a Misto spray for the oil and it worked fine.

The recipe is quite easy and very flavorful. I would recommend adapting the recipe by reducing the amount of olives because it overpowers the flavors of the mushrooms. Also, we tried preparing the phyllo sheets as the recipe calls, and we also tried preparing them using a cooking spray, and the difference was negligible. Using a cooking spray really simplifies the layering process.

Turn out REALLY good. I made strudel dough instead of using frozen phyllo sheets. Serve with sour cream or yogurt with shredded cucumbers to keep the Greek flavor.

This was SO good. We rarely eat lamb, don't think any other filling would provide the incredible flavor. We also doubled the spices and added some oregano and some additional mozzarella. Try it!

This was definitely a great tasting dish. I have been looking for new ways to cook lamb, and this was really different. I did alter the recipie a bit. I added a a tsp of salt, 2 tbls of lemon juice and two tbls of organo. I doubled the remaining spices & cut the shrooms coursely to help texture. Butter makes the filo better!

This was a real hit when we made it for a party. It multiplies well, and lends itself toward variations. we made several varieties. Some of our guests couldn't eat cheese, so we just left them out. Some were allergic to mushrooms, and it was delicious without them. We did make two significant variations. We used puff pastry, which we all thought turned out better than the fila would have. Also, we used small chunks of lamb instead of ground. We thought it would give the dish more substance.

This is a great do-ahead and easy entree for company. For presentation purposes, I made one large strudel and served the strudel slices spiraled around a heaping mound of "Minted Couscous w/Currants & Pine Nuts" (also on Epicurious). My guests thought I slaved all day and this dish tastes as good as it looks! My jar of dried tomatoes in oil worked fine as I rinsed the oil from them under hot tap water, thus eliminating the whole soaking step. I also did not use the full 1 1/2 C of Feta, instead about a cup. This is a keeper.

I'm surprised to be the first to review this recipe having originally found it on this site two years ago. Everyone I make it for loves it, and it also inspired me for a base on which to make the most incredible lamb mince ever.
