I really like the flavor of the dressing, but it seems a little thin for me. I've made it twice now (I thought I messed something up the first time, but no.) I wish I knew how to thicken it up because it tastes soo good, but it just runs off the salad like milk.

this dressing is great! i serve it with sauteed salmon on mache or arugula greens, and it's a real hit!

Fabulous and easy. Also refreshing --this will be nice to enjoy this summer. I figure this whole cup or so of dressing is only 4 Weight Watcher points. Added some grape tomatoes for color and chives to the dressing, just because I had them. Dee-lish!

I'd still give it three forks, even without the few additions I made which were: a large pinch of dried onion, 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley, and a few drops of cider vinegar. This dressing is a nice change from the usual oil and vinegar, and certainly superior to store bought Ranch dressing. I served it on a regular tossed salad rather than the greens suggested.

The salad is good, but the dressing is extra special. I use non-fat buttermilk and low calorie mayonnaise and use fresh herbs from the garden. A real winner!
