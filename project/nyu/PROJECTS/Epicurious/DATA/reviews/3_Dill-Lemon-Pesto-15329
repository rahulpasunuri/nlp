I thought this was pretty good. Used the only bread I had, a crusty whole grain, only two very small slices, and added a clove of garlic. Did not squeeze the liquid out of the bread, because it was quite stale. Fine on grilled salmon, and a couple of my guests also put it on roasted broccoli and said it worked well with that, too.

I used a leftover sourdough baguette, twice as much lemon juice, no sugar, and a little less olive oil (extra light). It was rich, creamy, bright and refreshing. I'll never go back to a traditional tartar again. All the flavor and none of the guilt.

I liked the flavor, but would cut back a little on the bread next time -- it was a bit thick.

I am a very big fan of homemade pestos. This recipe had little to offer in the way of flavor. If I were to make again, I would follow my Basil Pesto recipe, substituting the dill for the basil. I thought this recipe could use some garlic.

I used this pesto on grilled salmon. It was okay. I thought it was too strong for my taste, so I mixed it with a little bit of low fat sour cream, and I actually added a little more lemon juice to it. I really like a strong lemon taste with salmon. I liked the results much better. It made for a nice, cool, summer meal. It was very easy and quick, but I don't think I'll make it again unless I have the ingredients and am in a pinch.

I really enjoyed this, although in the future I'll use a touch less lemon. I've used this on or with everything from a lamp chop to an ocean perch filet...and it's awesome!! Try it...you'll love it!

I actually used this on chicken - It was amazing! I marinated the chicken in white wine, dijon mustard,a bit of olive oil, and white wine vinegar, and then baked it. However, I left the parsley out of the pesto. This dish got rave reviews. I am making this again soon.
