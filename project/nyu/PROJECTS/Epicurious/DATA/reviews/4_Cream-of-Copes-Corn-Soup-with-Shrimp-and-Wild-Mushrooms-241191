Cooked this up one saturday for guest who are known for their own dinner parties. Knew they liked southwest so took a chance on this recipe. Did not have toasted corn, so roasted in oven. Added some cooked bacon and subbed creme fraiche with 1/2 whipping cream nd 1/2 sour cream. Was very good and presented very well . srved with corn bread. Danny

Very easy with incredible taste. Served with crabmeat and bacon this time, will try shrimp and muschrooms next. Also great as a creamy "sipping soup" to use as a small course in a complex meal. Ordered Cope's Corn on line, will definitely try to find it in a local store now. This is a restaurant quality keeper!

I was disappointed in this. Mushrooms overwhelmed the taste of the soup base and the shrimp. It was just a cream of mushroom soup with shrimp. Not sure it was worth the effort.
