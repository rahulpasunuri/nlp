Yeah, definitely needs to be brought to room temp before serving to bring out all of the delicious flavours here. Soo tasty that I'm not sure what to use the leftover oil for. I might just make some bread and dip in!

Have made at least a dozen times now for dinner parties/book club and am always pleased. I omit fennel seed (don't like it), use more dried red pepper, think it tastes better at room tempurature but keeps FOREVER in the fridge. Yum.

Needs additional lemon juice about 1 tsp. Looks great when served.
