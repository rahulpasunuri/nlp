Excellent and easy dessert. I halved the cream, sugar and eggs for a test run as I didn't want to make too much if we didn't like it - I ended up making it again the next day for company - it's that good! Even though I halved the liquid ingredients, I kept the vanilla, cinnamon and instant coffee powder the same. I didn't do the ground coffee bean to save time straining so keeping the 2 tsp. instant was a perfect replacement. Very good coffee flavor and creaminess was not an issue with regular individual ramekins and 45-55 min. bake time. Bruleed with a torch and raw sugar just before serving.

Exceptional! Best creme brulee I've ever had and I've had them all over! Conscious of a previous reviewer who felt it was overcooked, I pulled mine at 45 minutes when they were still a wee jiggly and they were perfection. Super creamy with a deep coffee flavor. I did not have espresso beans so used my regular medium roast coffee ground coarse and the instant coffee. I also didn't stretch this over two days per the instructions but just cooled and chilled and brulee'd with a blowtorch and the whole thing from start to stomach was about 5 hours.

Simply delicious and highly recommended! Please note the additional 8 tsp. sugar is to brulee on top, not to mix in. To A Cook from Media who found it not as creamy as a classic recipe, try playing with the baking time and/or ramekin type. A couple minutes fewer in the oven or a deeper ramekin may give you the consistency you're looking for.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. I also made classic vanilla creme brulee to offer a choice. The flavor on the coffee creme brulee was very nice but it lacked the creaminess of the classic creme brulee. While everyone enjoyed the coffee creme brulee (everyone tried both), the classic vanilla was the unanimously preferred choice between the two. I'll make the coffee style again and try to figure out how to make it creamier.

I have made this several times. It has been described by a friend as "crazy good". Highly recommended.

I realize my previous posting may not have been clear. I reduced the amount of sugar by 8 teaspoons, or about 1/6 a cup.

I've tried several variations of this recipe and had the most success with it by nixing the additional 8 teaspoons of sugar, substituting two tablespoons of coarsely ground espresso beans for 1 tablespoon of finely ground espresso beans, and exchanging the instant espresso powder for two generous shots of espresso.

Made half a recipe, but otherwise followed exactly as described. It was a hit. Would definitely make again.

Love this recipe! Have been making it for a couple years. This time, I made 1/2 recipe with splenda for my husband's birthday (at his request), and 1/2 recipe w/ sugar for me and the kids. I haven't cooked much w/ splenda, but for this recipe, the texture of the splenda version was not as creamy. It still tasted great and he was very happy., but the sugar version was much creamier - - absolutely perfect. So just in case you were wondering whether you could do splenda here, I'd say don't unless you absolutely must.

I tried this recipe out for a special Valentine's day dinner this was the dessert I served. My main dish also from this site Jamie's Oliver's Steak, Guinness and Cheese pot pie. Because the entree was quite rich I halved this recipe and made 7 servings instead of 4. Also of course reducing the cooking time from 55 minutes to about 40 minutes. This is a lovely dessert all the flavors come through. I served this with those pirroute (sp) cookies light wafer filled with dark chocolate. I will make this again.

Amazing! I was the host of my girl's monthly dinner party this month and this was a hit. I only used a cheese cloth to remove the grinds and it worked perfecly.

I followed the recipe exactly, however whenever the method called for a fine straining, I added an extra step of putting it through a cheese cloth as well. This extra step removed any of the coarsely ground espresso beans that the seive didn't catch.

Fantastic. Everything you want in a brulee but the coffee flavor kicks it up a notch. I brulee'd it under my broiler but next time will use my husband's propane blowtorch as I think it will help carmelize more evenly. Instead of espresso beans or coffee powder, which I didn't have I used a Seattle's Best decaf coffee 'filter pack' - the kind you get from hotels. I soaked in the cream liquid for about 1/2 hour as called for - perfect! My 10 & 7 y.o kids LOVED this. The 10 y.o wants it for her bday!

This is out of this world. Mine are chilling right now for dinner tonight. I did sample one of my extras just after I carmelized the sugar with my torch...excellent!!! I will make this recipe again for sure. I also found that it was a bit dark when I pulled it from the oven and was nervous that I had burned it. Nope, it is on the darker side. Like a nice latte color. I could not find the expresso powder so used nescafe coffee powder. The vanilla bean and cinnamon stick add a flavor that extract or ground could not. I highly reccomend making this dessert!!!!!!!

Coffee and creme brulee, what could be better? My only hesitation with this is that the creme brulee was rather dark, possibly because I let it steep quite a bit longer than called for. Also, although I used a fine mesh chinois, it would have had fewer flecks of coffee if I had used cheesecloth, too. That said, the taste was fabulous. I used regular sugar and a torch and wished I had brought some raspberries. A great dinner party dessert.

A lovely recipe, uncomplicated and easy. I was worried about using the coffee, but the combination of the espresso powder and beans creates a really lovely smooth coffee flavour. The texture was somewhat different than I usually get with creme brulee. It was almost puddinglike, but perhaps I didn't let it set long enough. I garnished with mint and a few rasperries. The berries were great and worked well with the custard.

Fantastic. Out of this world. Followed recipe exactly and could not have been happier with the results, but halved for 4. Excellent flavor and texture and very simple to put together. Top on my list of 'company' desserts.

Better than you can imagine. Did not add the coffee beans but did everything else. Have made this several times since!

This is so easy and I quartered the recipe and got three and 1/2 desserts from this (used the traditional oval -fluted shaped ramekin). Made in the AM, no problem with it coming out ok for that night's dinner.

I found this recipe about two years ago and I've been making it ever since. Friends ask for it for every occasion! I frequently omit the coffee and just have vanilla creme brulee.

This was very easy to make and delicious. I strained mine through several thicknesses of cheesecloth inside a strainer and that worked very well. I tried doing the top using the broiler method and only had moderate success with that. I will try a creme brulee torch next time.

This recipe was amazingly simple, and delicious as well. I made it once for fun and it was so good my family wanted me to make it for their friends. Easy even for the novice chef!

This was smooth, rich and had sumptuous body. The contrast in textures (the sweet, crisp top and the creamy custard) was heavenly. I used good vanilla extract and only the instant espresso, though I did add a little more to make up for the ground beans I had omitted. My dinner companions were humming with delight.

Unlike some flavored creme brulee recipes, this one maintains the classic creaminess and texture of the classic. The coffee flavoring is just right - not too strong but it is definately there. We made it in the morning and put it in the fridge and then brulee'd right before serving. That way we didn't have to tie up the oven while we were making dinner.
