This really tasted like authentic Bolognese, and I followed the advice of a previous reviewer by first adding the dairy, let it simmer, then adding the tomatoes. I also added a great deal of tomato paste to increase the tomato presence, and about doubled the wine. I would suggest you not bother with the celery and carrots, they add nothing.

3 forks when I followed the recipe. 4 forks after I changed the following: 1) followed others' advice by putting the milk (I used milk) in with the meats, 2) increased the garlic by 50%, 3) added a can of tomato paste for thickness, 4) added a full container of chicken broth and let it slow cook down, & 5) put 1/2T of oregano powder (didn't have any fresh). I also seasoned the pot with a few slices of pancetta in the beginning and then removed it. Not sure if that added very much.

Perfect! I took the advice of a previous review and added the milk half way through browning the meat and vegetables, rather than adding it with the tomatoes.

i took a stab at this for the first time and it turned out great. my portions were eyeballed and based on constant tastings. and i personally am a spicy addict so i went heavy on the crushed red peppers and i even added some cayenne for that extra lingering fire after each bite. i was a little uncertain of the crushed tomatoes at first in my saucepan as i felt that the volume would over take my 1lb. of elbow mac, but it worked out great. i wish i remembered to add some fontina and parm but i was so hungry i made haste and burnt the roof of my mouth.

I used fat free half and half and added right after browning the meat, let simmer for 5 minutes, then added the wine and let simmer for an additional 5 minutes. I then added Muir Glen Whole Tomatoes and mashed with a fork, and added one can of tomato sauce to thicken it up a bit. I browned spicy Italian sausage since my husband and I love spicy foods, used fresh basil and balsamic as opposed to the canned version that came with those ingredients, and dried oregano as I didn't have any fresh. I also let it boil off all the excess liquid (I had the time to let it simmer an additional hour). All in all it was delicious!

While many elements of this recipe are good, the whole point of a Bolognese sauce is to simmer the meat in milk to bring out the natural sweetness of the beef, not make a pink sauce after the fact by adding the milk in with the tomatoes. My modest modifications were to saute the beef and vegetables until cooked through (salt added), but not browned. Then I added the milk with a tiny splash of cream and simmered over a low heat until the surrounding liquid was clear, about 10 minutes. I next added the wine and simmered until the liquid was again clear, probably another 15 minutes. Then I added the herbs and tomatoes and simmered over low heat until the sauce thickened. I usually make a large batch of Bolognese the old-fashioned way, which takes about 18 hours to cook properly. This is a great and quick substitute when you have the craving but not the time. I added a tablespoon or so of basil (grocer's tube) right before serving. A good compromise.

Good recipe. Used only ground lean beef, and dried herbs (oregano, thyme, laurel) + prepared arrabiatta sauce, 1tbs of balsamic, and extra dried red chilies !!! Also used rice milk instead of half-and-half. Better let it simmer about 15-30 min longer. Came out great !

A few substitutions: veggie ground instead of meat, sherry instead of red wine, plain soy milk instead of half and half, plain diced tomatoes instead of the herbed ones. It was still pretty good (believe it or not!). Way filling comfort food.

This is an excellent, easy to make sauce. I only used 1 lb. of ground beef in the sauce, and I mixed it with a spinach/mozzarella ravioli. I highly recommend this sauce.

I was very dissppointed with this recipe. Cutting the veggies coarsely is way too chunky. The sauce had very little flavor. Will not make this one again.

A very tasty quick bolognese, and good for a weeknight meal. I made a few changes to suit what was on hand: ground turkey rather than meatloaf mix; white wine instead of red (boosted with homemade red wine vinegar); regular diced tomatoes instead of the froofy ones noted in the recipe; dried oregano plus some fresh parsley and thyme; and instead of whole milk I used homemade yogurt (stabilized with a little cornstarch so it wouldn't break in the sauce). A lot of subs, but all in the spirit of the original recipe. The only outright additions I made were to include a slug of dry marsala wine (to give a little of the depth that goes missing when you use turkey instead of meatloaf mix), a healthy dose of red pepper flakes (because we're partial to a spicy bolognese), and some rough-chopped arugula tossed in with the pasta and sauce (included because we had a ton in our garden). We tossed the sauce with TJ's sprouted wheat paparadelle, which was great because the rough texture of the pasta grabbed the sauce quite well. Overall, quite easy and tasty, and it's simple to successfully adapt the recipe to whatever's in your pantry and fridge.

Exceptional because it was so easy and was exactly what it purports to be--quick and uncomplicated. This is true comfort food. We used ground venison. I added two tablespoons of chevre on top when serving, along with fresh basil for color. Served with large bowl of penne and crusty bread. Carb heaven. I also did not use the special diced tomatoes, but instead just added basil and basalmic to recipe. Used milk instead of half and half, and came out fine.

This recipe was delicious and much quicker than my traditional Ragu (which needs to cook for 4 hours). I did let this cook a little longer than the recipe directs and then used my potato masher to crush the chopped canned tomatoes. Got a nice thick sauce that way.

This was great but only AFTER I added additional tomatoes, tomato paste, and red wine. Started with hand crushing a 28oz can of whole tomatoes then added a small can of diced and a can of tomato paste. Also added fresh basil, red pepper, and extra wine. Next time will use a mix spicy italian sausage and lean ground chuck for the meat.

I followed the recipe exactly and found this to be a delicious and quick sauce. I think the fresh oregano really adds a nice flavor, so try to get your hands on the fresh variety. Hunts brand makes the diced tomatoes called for in the recipe, which is what I used. I also used a very nice red wine - Pinor Noir - and had a glass of the same wine with my meal. This one is definitely going into my permanent recipe box. Yummy!

Very tasty. Mad once with ground lamb & really enjoyed it.

Delivers on the promise of Quick & good. If possible, let it simmer a little longer. Good weekday supper, and my 2 year old (toughest food critic on the planet) loved it.

Something was missing from this recipe for me. It needed pepper or something.

This recipe is a very tasty and easy bolognese ragu. I couldn't find the tomates with balsamic vinegar, so I added some. Iused only ground beef, and instead of the oregano used basil.

I don't know if I'm qualified to comment on the recipe, since I didn't follow it completely. I left out the onion and garlic because I'm a nursing mother with a sensitive-stomached child. For the same reason, I substituted non-dairy creamer for the half and half. I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I threw in a can of tomato sauce and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some dried basil and olive oil. I don't like oregano, so I left it out. Nevertheless, the result was delicious!! It was good over rice, which is how I had it, as my baby doesn't allow me to eat wheat products either.

I have made this recipe a few times and I have always found it to be yummy. It's super simple to make. I have actually never used the tomatoes called for in the recipe. I just buy the tomatoes with basil in them, and then I add some balsamic vinegar, and I don't bother with the olive oil. In fact, I made this last night and used completely plain crushed tomatoes. I also didn't have fresh oregano, so I threw in a little dried and some dried marjoram, and some fresh basil. I haven't had problems with soupiness, but if you do, you should just let it simmer for awhile longer until it's the desired consistency.

Super simple. Great Flavors. Perfect for mid-week-after-work dinner...brings a nice gourmet feel to a midweek meal.

I haven't made this because I couldn't find the tomatoes -- I read the labels on the tomatoes I could find - they had high fructose corn syrup! I don't want that in my ragu.

Rating: 3
I didn't have the soupiness problem--maybe because I left the celery out. Also, I used very lean beef. I thought this was just great, used my own spices and balsamic. Something about this recipe is better than my plain old sauce, but I can't figure out what...

To avoid the "soupiness" make sure to drain the juices from the browned meat and only put in enough water from the tomatoes to mate everything. If you've got more time, let it sit for longer and steam off the water. Otherwise, pretty good for a quick Bolognese fix, when that's what your girlfriend really wants! Guten Appetite

While it tastes delicious, it doesn't really look like a traditional sauce. (as my girlfriend pointed out: "it looks like soup") I think with a little tweeking this could be Superb! -Cheers
