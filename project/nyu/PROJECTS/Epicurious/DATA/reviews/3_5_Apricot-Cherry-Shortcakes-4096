This was absolutely wonderful and easy to make. Now is the perfect time to prepare this dish, since both apricots and cherries are in season. The shortcakes are delicious while being relatively low in fat. I wouldn't change a thing. If you feel sinful, a dollop of whipped cream would be lovely, I'm sure.
