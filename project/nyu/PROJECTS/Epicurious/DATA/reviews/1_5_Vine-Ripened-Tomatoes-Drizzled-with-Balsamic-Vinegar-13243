Why would anyone want to overwhelm the delicate flavor of vine-ripened tomatoes with vinegar?

While this is simple as it is...I make this with sliced red onion & crumbled feta cheese & people love it! Vine ripened tomatoes in the summer are a great yet simple dish.

I hope you didn't pay for this "recipe" - 2 ingredients: tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. The salt and pepper don't really count (and it doesn't include the salt as an ingredient so why count the black pepper???) This is how you eat tomatoes if you are in the garden - just bring out a bottle of balsamic - or standing up in the kitchen. I agree with the other reviewer: you ARE joking, right???

Very simple recipe. Perfect for a summer weeknight when you have excess tomatoes from the garden and not a lot of time to prepare an appetizer.

There are too many other ways to make a fabulous tomato and balsamic vinegar recipe. This is a joke, right? Who could not make this recipe better?
