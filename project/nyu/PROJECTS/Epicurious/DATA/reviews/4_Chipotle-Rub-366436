This is terrific on the Tri-tip Steak with Chipotle Rub. We'll definitely use it again. Just don't be tempted to take a whiff of the ground chipotles as I did. Yikes! After many sneezes and lots of nose blowing, I recovered. Stupid, stupid, stupid:-)!!!

This is a variation of my own rub. I use two ghost peppers, as I like the heat. I also add a teaspoon of achiote seeds for color and that particular flavor and use coconut suger rather than brown. I double up on the cumin . my favorite spice. To maximize the flavor, do NOT make ahead. Toasting the seeds in a skillet just before grinding is the way to go here.

I made this rub with a sirloin (didn't have tri-tip) and grilled it for Father's Day - HUGE success!!! It had a delicious, smoky flavor and good spice, but not too hot or strong - even our very picky 9 year old loved it :) This rub will definitely be a summer staple in our house!
