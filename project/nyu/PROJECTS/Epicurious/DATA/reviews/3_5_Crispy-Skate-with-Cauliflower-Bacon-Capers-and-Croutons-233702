This is a keeper. The cauliflower with bacon, lemon and capers is a classic combo and all ingredients are necessary. I made this with the sole but I think skate would be excellent.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year, and it was delicious! I halved the bacon and still found it to be unnecessary, which is why I gave the recipe 3 forks instead of 4. Otherwise I followed the recipe closely. Unfortunately, fresh thyme was unavailable at 2 stores on Christmas Eve, so I had to substitute with dried. The skate was very light and flavorful. My husband loved it too. I will definitely be making this again!

Love it! The rice & wheat coating fried up light and crispy. Cauliflower side was nice addition and made a complete meal. To save time I roasted the cauliflower in the oven for 20 min with olive oil ahead of time. Next fried the fish (used dover instead of skate). Lastly, combined all the cauliflower ingredients together with a dab of the bacon oil in a skillet, sauteed, and served with fish.

everybody seems to be offended by the bacon... it does make the dish very different to omit it. i used pancetta once - also great, and also fatty, and i used prosciutto once - and i prefer it to bacon - less fatty, and i usually have it on hand (this will ruffle the feathers the folk who think capers are exotic - and how DO you keep a kitchen w/out capers?) anyway - to cut down on the fat you can drain the liquid drippings and just add olive oil to the pan. or... for those opposed to pork altogether you can put a drop of smoke seasoning in olive oil and it's almost as good. almost. because my son is a vegetarian i've learned to get around the bacon - that usually works. i've done this recipe all these ways - my only gripe with the recipe is canola oil. i use olive. and--- - my family loves it.

This is one my husbands and mine favorite dishes, as we can easily scarf the whole thing down everytime. The thyme is essential, make the dish. We usually use Dover Sole instead of Skate, since Skate is usually harder to find. I think the flavors compliment each other perfectly...it's like an upgraded version of comfort food :-).

Tasty! The bacon is unnecessary, and I used olive oil instead of canola. I'll definitely make it again.

Help. I tried to follow this recipe but the skate wing would quickly curl up after touching the pan. I haven't had this issue with sole, so I wonder if anyone can help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. I did some online searches and found that some folks cook the wing with the "bone" (cartilage) in but this recipe calls for "boned".

I didn't make the fish, but the cauliflower was an excellent side dish. This may be my favorite way to make cauliflower. I substituted olive oil for the bacon and it turned out well, plus it saved time and was one less ingredient to buy. I cooked the cauliflower for about 12 minutes to get it to the texture I like - next time will try the suggestion to steam it first.

I made this for our anniversary dinner ( I had skate on a previous celebratory evening and thought it to be one of the best meals of my life.) This fell short. It was like fried fish with vegetables that did not compliment the flavors. We ate what we could and the rest went in the trash.....Oh well, there's always next year..... Thank goodness we're going to one of our favorite restaurants on Saturday night.

Wondra flour is a good substitute for the rice flour. Wondra fries up lighter and crispier than all purpose flour. Fast, easy, delicious.

Tasty recipe!I roasted the cauliflower first before adding it to a little bacon grease. I also used dover sole.

Using simple flour was just fine. I did steam cook the cauliflowers a while since I like them cooked through but still crunchy. I didn't include tomatoes since my husband does not like them but the cauliflowers turned out delicious with carrots for color. Omitted bacon.

Exceptionally good. The cauliflower is fine made with olive oil instead of bacon, and the Cream of Wheat gives a crispy, smooth crust to the fish.

I've made this dish twice, and loved it both times! I have to admit, going out and buying Cream of Wheat and rice flour (and then never using them again) sounded like a waste, so I just used regular flour. Also, my boyfriend doesn't need more bacon in his diet so I reduced the bacon to 2 pieces and really couldn't see the need to use more than that.

This is a suggestion to the cook from Norway. A good substitute for Cream of Wheat would be Farina. Cream of Wheat is a brand name.

Made this tonight and it is definitely one I will make again. Not living in a city, it was tough to find a fish market with Skate Wings but all were willing to order. Found one that had it delivered same day. I would change nothing in the recipe, glad it was just for 2 people as I wanted to test it out before serving to guests. Easy to increase portions. Must serve with a nice fresh green veggie, my suggestion is grilled pea pods or asparagus.

Note to DC - thanks for the tip! I've been meaning to make the pilgrimage down to the pier. It's well over an hour's drive each way, though, so it's hard to get over the idea of driving hours to buy groceries when other places where I've lived I was able to walk to the market. DC residents loves to poke fun at us Frederick hicks. ;-) We've been trying to get a decent grocery down town Frederick for years. By the way, it was the old Fresh Fields in Rockville that had the skate sans cartilage.

This isn't a review but note to cook in DC area: Maybe you need to get out of Safeway's a little more? (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Try the pier. They have skate WITH cart.

I used to live in the Brittany region of France and often made skate wings (aile de raie) the same way Mi's (from Parker, CO) French grandmother did. It was so easy to make and came out great every time. Not only is skate delicious, but because there are no bones in the wing, only cartilage, it is easy to eat as well. The description of this recipe says that skate is quite common on the East coast. Well, maybe it is in NYC. I've only seen it once at a suburban DC gourmet store, in the 14 years I've lived here. The skate wing, however, had already been removed from its cartilage. According to the fishmonger, it arrived at the store that way. I decided to try it anyway, but without the supporting cartilage, it was extremely difficult to handle. Without the cartilage, it cooked quicker and was difficult to turn. So be forewarned that skate without its cartilage will cook differently.

Wish these dishes were more internationally friendly...in Norway we can't get Cream of Wheat and I shudder to think about even LOOKING for rice flour.

Maybe I just had some bad skate. It looked fresh enough but following the directions exactly, we ended up with tasteless mushy fish which was as advertised, crispy on the outside but blah on the inside. The cauliflower, caper, crouton part was tasty and quite different but two thumbs down on the skate.

My husbnd has always wanted to try Skate fish but never able to find a recipe that turned him on. He did this recipe last Friday and all of us were so excited by the flavor and appetite appeal. He will definitely do this more often. The cauliflower was such a delicious accompaniment to the fish. Whoever developed this recipe did such a terrific job. Just loved it.

I would be interested in hearing a review of this dish and what the nutritional information would be. Seems very high in fat as you cook everything in the bacon fat. Wouldn't that just make it taste very greasy? Anyway, I can say that Skate is a great fish, especially for the non-fishys.
