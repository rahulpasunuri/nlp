I made this with six turkey legs (no thighs). I followed the recipe with these changes: Added basil and thyme to the flour. Used red wine instead of white because that was what I had. I added halved mushrooms and the end of a jar of marinated artichoke salad (olives, red bell peppers). Poured in half a box of Pomi pure tomatoes. Loosely covered the casserole with foil and baked it about 1 1/2 hours, then when we were ready to eat I put the gremolata on top. We had this with plain rigatoni and steamed asparagus. It was pretty good as well as very attractive, and would make an excellent company dinner as well as bargain-priced (turkey thighs were $1.49 a pound).

okay, so I doctored the recipe...I added proscuitto, garlic, carrots, and cremini mushrooms. I also added a couple bay leaves, some thyme, and cayenne pepper. Served with buttered egg noodles and chives. The result? The sauce was delicious, but the turkey was still bland and a little dry. The gremolata did not do it for me either. I guess I won't be making turkey again.

My family loved this. Followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the orange zest from the gremolata and stirring about 1T lemon juice into the gravy immediately before serving. Traditional osso bucco is served over risotto... we made buttermilk mashed potatoes. Absolutely delicious. Will make this often. If you have one, a lidded roasting pan is easier than covering the pan tightly with foil.

Great dish, nice and tasty. Served it with quinoa. Per some previous reviews: added garlic and carrots, used fresh tomatoes and anchovy paste instead of fillets. All great. Don't skip the gremolata. Def a keeper.

Great recipe. I added the garlic and fresh tomatoes as another reviewer had suggested and used olives instead of the anchovies, since I didn't have anchovies in the house. I also cooked it for 1 hour, covered, and for a further 15 mins uncovered. Easy and tasty and a nice change from chicken.

I first made this dish when it appeared in Gourmet, 2007. I misplaced my copy and have been searching for the receipe. I LOVE this dish! It's delicious and a marvelous "comfort" dish for a bitter winter evening.

This was just fabulous. All the lusciousness of Osso Bucco without the veal guilt! And you cannot skip the gremolata.

Tried this recipe last night, as I *love* turkey thighs. I've never had ossobuco, so I don't know if it really tastes like ossobuco, but YOWZA, was this good. I didn't have anchovies, so used about five, inch and half long squirts of anchovy paste. I also used 1 large and 1 small tomato instead of canned and chopped up about 3 good sized cloves of garlic and 1 carrot to add the the braising liquid. When it first came out of the oven, I thought it was only so-so. But then I added a little more anchovy paste, a squirt of lemon, a splash of white wine, a dash of salt and Voila! It sprang to life. Do NOT omit the gremolata - this gave the dish it's crowning, electrifying finish. I served it over mashed potatoes to rave reviews. It was so good our brains fell right out....

This picture seems to be of veal and not turkey legs.
