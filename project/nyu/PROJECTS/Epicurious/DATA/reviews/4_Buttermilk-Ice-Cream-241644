Delicious indeed. I'm not sure if 'heavy whipping cream' is heavy cream, whipping cream, or something else, so I mixed some heavy (double) and light (single) creams together, and was short of buttermilk, so had to use some yoghurt! I forgot the lemon juice, but the ice cream still tasted of buttermilk, Mmmm, mmmM! Creamy and tangy, as it should be, perfect to pair with apple pie, or on it's own with some salted caramel sauce :)

Oh wow, was this good! If you like the usual sweet ice creams, this might be surprisingly tart for you. It tasted like sour cream ice cream. Fantastic. We will make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the addition of a little meyer lemon zest. The texture is great. The flavor is nicely tart and refreshing. As another reviewer said, unlike many homemade ice cream recipes, this keeps a very creamy texture. I served it with mixed berries (blackberries, raspberries and tayberries from my garden) that I macerated in a little raspberry liquer and sugar. Really good!! I will definitely add it to my favorites list!!

This reminds me of the light yellow ice cream inside BirdEye's Artic Roll that I loved as a kid. I think it will taste even more like it with more sugar, so I will add an extra 1/4 to 1/2 Cup sugar next time. This ice cream has the creamy texture of ice cream, but it also has the tartness of frozen yogurt. Unlike other ice cream that gets hard, this one stays nice and soft even after being frozen for several days. However, it also melts faster. My hubby said it tastes like spoiled milk and he is not into it. It is really easy to make creme fraiche at home using heavy whipping cream and buttermilk (look online for recipes).

I paired this with the spiced peach pie with buttermilk crust and it was perfect!

This produced a perfect texture. I also added vanilla and the result tasted like a creamy cheesecake ice cream.

YUM! It's like a more decadent pinnkberry yogurt. Very tangy. This is good on it's own but would be great over something very sweet - like a fruit crumble. The creme fraiche is a great addition.

Exquisitely simple and delicious recipe! It produced the finest creamy texture I've ever gotten out of my ice cream machine. I added a heavy teaspoon of vanilla and used homemade creme fraiche, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very delicate cheesecake-sort of flavor with hints of sour cream and citrus. Would be excellent paired with fresh berries. A sophisticated ice cream that will impress your friends---if you don't tell them how easy it is to make. A real winner!

Made this yesterday and it's fantastic. I can't wait to eat it again today! Really great texture. Tastes very much like cheesecake. Yum!!! It's great to make this after having done a souffle...great way to use up those extra yolks.

This ice cream is really great - not sweet - refreshing - I made it with the cornmeal cake - great dessert!
