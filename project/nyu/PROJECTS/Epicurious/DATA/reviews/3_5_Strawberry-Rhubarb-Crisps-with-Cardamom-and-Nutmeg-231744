Based on others' reviews, I excused myself from running to the store to buy the orange juice I did not have and made the recipe without it (used lemon zest). IMO, it was too dry. Needs the juice. I also upped topping ingredients proportionately to use a full stick of butter because I like lots of topping. I love the cardamom/nutmeg combo here.

I've made this many times and each time has been delicious. As noted by another reviewer, the recipe accommodates substitutions well. I usually make it with just rhubarb, though have mixed rhubarb and nectarines or strawberries. I also usually cut back on the sugar (to 1/3-1/2 cup) and sometimes add instead orange marmalade. Sometimes add some lemon juice, too, especially if the non-rhubarb fruit is very sweet. I have found that 1.5 times the topping is the right amount. Also, I add much more cardamom and nutmeg to both filling and topping and substitute walnuts for almonds. Don't be tempted to add or substitute cinnamon for either of these spices; the nutmeg and cardamom are what make this crisp special.

read all reviews, enjoyed the OJ controversey, then made as directed w/exception of substituting ground coriander for ground cardomom (no cardomom) and adding some chopped pecans to topping - Awesome, delicious and beautiful. proportion of crisp to fruit was perfect as written - we baked in a deep dish pyrex pan that's 9" square at the top and flutes down.

I used a touch too much cardamom but it still turned out great. I used leftovers to make a milkshake that was to die for!

the nice thing about this recipe is that it accommodates substititions very well... i used apple cider instead of orange juice, grapefruit zest instead of orange zest, and walnuts instead of almonds in the topping...in other words, what i had on hand. aside from ending up with far too much liquid (i was short on rhubarb), i'd say that this is a lovely, comforting and humble dessert. not much of a looker, persay, but something i could easily polish off by myself due to the deliciousness of it. the topping, by the way, tastes like oatmeal cookies. YUM.

This was not a keeper. The orange flavor totally overwhelmed the strawberry and rhubarb flavor. The topping was good though. The cardamom and nutmeg also didn't work with the rhubarb and strawberry in my opinion. There's a great Wolfgang Puck recipe floating out there on the internet for this kind of crisp; next time I'll search it out.

Agreed - delicious!! Don't omit the OJ, but do cut down the sugar in with the fruit. Made it in one high rim 9" pyrex and turned out perfect - with bubbling fruit and perfect syrup! Lipsmacking!

I made this for a spring brunch and it was a hit. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the amount of crisp and cut down slightly on the amount of sugar in the rhubarb-strawberry mixture.

I disagree about skipping the OJ. I used the full juice and zest called for, and found that the orange brought out the cardamom in a way that the zest along wouldn't do. I also baked it in a single dish, and so increased the streusel by adding 2T more butter (for a full stick), 1/2c. all-purpose flour and 1/2t baking powder, and increased the salt by 1/2t. LOVED THIS RECIPE!

My goodness - this was awesome! I used 4 1.5cup ramekins and therefore I found that the original amount of topping was enough. I did however reduce the amount of rhubarb to 450g (1pound) as that was all I had in my bunch and it was the perfect amount - it gave a nice thick syrup without being runny (I omitted the OJ as others suggested)and it allowed the sweetness of the strawberry and fragrance of the orange rind to come through - I think 1kg of rhubarb would over power it and then you would definitely have to add more topping. great crisp, plan to make it again.

I thought this recipe was absolutely perfect. I was tempted to substitute some of the nutmeg for cinnamon, as others suggested, but I decided to stick to the recipe and am glad I did. The cardamom flavor was strong enough to notice, but not overpowering. I halved the recipe, since I just made it for me and my husband, and baked it in a loaf pan in the toaster oven for about half an hour. I plan to make it for my friend's going away party this weekend!

I am SO glad I listened to the advice of the cook who recommended skipping the orange juice. It was liquid-y enough withe the rhubarb and I found the orange flavor was just perfect without it. I used fresh orange zest and I actually added an extra half teaspoon orange zest to make up for the OJ. It tastes great and between the cardamom, orange, rhubarb and the crumble, it has a lot of subtle and complex flavors.

this is a wonderful summer time dessert that is can be made with 60% splenda to reduce carbs and tastes just as great.

This was delicious. I used a large baking dish and it was done in about 45 minutes. I left out the OJ, rhubarb is juicy enough on its own. Added cinnamon to the fruit and topping.

I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, fresh orange juice and orange zest and it came out fabulous. I baked it in a single casserole dish for ease.

Wonderful way to usher in spring. Next time I will cut the sugar in the filling in half (ya never know w/Rhubarb, but as with most fruit pies/crisps, it can be okay to scale back on the sugar). Also made it in one pyrex dish. The amount of topping was perfect. It *did* render quite a bit of juice-- not sure if that was b/c I used a big dish instead of indiv. portions.

Delicious. I used grated lemon and grapefruit rinds instead of orange, and just a little water instead of OJ. I used about 3 cups chopped rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries for this amount of topping. I'll definitely make it again!!

Yum. I made it twice. I didn't have oranges so I used juice from canned mandarin oranges. Worked fine. In one recipe, I actually put in the mandarin oranges. Surprisingly good. Be sure to smell the aroma of the cardamom before you put it in the recipe. Heavenly. (I ground mine from seed.)

Everyone gobbled this up, even though, based on comments below and the lack of rhubarb in my local grocery stores, I made many changes: I substituted ripe pears for the rhubarb (and on a second occasion, a pint of cranberries for the greater volume of strawberries); cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup (a little more when I used the cranberries instead of strawberries); replaced the orange juice with 1/4 lemon juice and the orange peel with lemon peel. I did NOT, as suggested by some reviewers, double the topping. Served it with a nice lowfat plain yogurt (Stonyfield Farms). Everyone loved it, both times. The cardomon and nutmeg is a nice combination, and a pleasant change from the expected cinnamon.

this has amazing potential, however the orange is simply to overpowering. if you love the flavor of rhubarb then omit the orange alltogether, if you only like rhubarb then reduce the orange by 1/2. i also doubled the topping and substituted cinamon for the nutmeg. everyone loved it but said too much orange.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. And you do need to double the topping, as other reviewers suggested. The combination of the orange juice and zest provided strong orange after taste that I didn't like. Next time I'll stick to a traditional rhubarb custard crisp.

Funny thing....while I was researching this recipe, a new review popped up: seemed that another cook wanted to make this dish the same day I did! So, the recipe is great, and the reviews are right on! I doubled the topping (glad I did), added cinnamon and lemon juice to the fruit, and threw in some chopped pecans into the topping as well. The fresh strawberries from the local farm shined like the seasonal wonder that they are.

Made it exactly according to recipe only I used French onion soup bowls and it was fabulous. Made it again in aluminum tart pans (about the same size as the soup bowls) for a picnic and worked out perfectly. They keep welll in the fridge too after they have been cooked. Had it for breakfast mmm!

Very good! Made this for my husband's birthday and received "Honey, this is exceptional!" I took others' suggestions to double the topping. Also, I used cinnamon in place of the nutmeg for the filling, but still used nutmeg in the topping. The cardamom and almonds are nice additions. Tasty!

The rhubarb stayed way too crunchy for my taste and the filling was too juicy. I usually use a tablespoon of tapioca as thickener in my crips, but I followed this recipe as written. Should've cooked the rhubarb down a bit beforehand and replaced the flour with tapioca.

This is a delicious crisp. I have made it many times. I double topping and fruit and make in a 9 x 13 pan - crisp topping very adaptable to other fruit combos too.

Great summer dessert! We made it in a 9x13 baking dish and doubled the topping. Loved the almonds with the oatmeal and the tartness of the rhubarb.

I used some fresh seasonal rhubarb in this and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for the topping and it was absolutely exceptional. The cardamom really gave this a unique flavour. Serve it warm with ice cream.

Cut down the rhubarb (didn't have enough) and sugar, upped the strawberries. Substituted walnut meal (thank you Trader Joes!) for almonds and cinnamon for cardamon. Made enough ramekins for breakfast consumption too. Served with vanilla ice cream. A great summer dessert. Not a problem to monkey with the portions. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This was very tasty and easy to put together. As I didn't have enough rhubarb I added some extra strawberries and some sliced pears. We will definitely be making this again!

Made this exactly according to the recipe except in an 8x8 glass pan. Turned out perfectly! The tartness of the rhubarb came through, balanced nicely by the sweetness of the sugar and strawberries. Dinner guests loved it.

I thought 5 cups was too much rhubarb (compared to 2 cups strawberries) so I used 4 cups rhubarb and 3 1/2 c strawberries. Served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum!
