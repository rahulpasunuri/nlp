Use whatever berries you have that are fresh! I make the tart and spread the mascarpone ahead of time and then put the berries on just before serving. That way, if I have leftovers, there's no soggy crust.

Fantastic result with little effort. I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1 tbsp. Amaretto to the filling. I used the prescribed berries in the same quantities, but as I had blackcurrant jam, I used that instead of marmalade, and I already had cassis on hand. I prepared everything the night before (as expected, the raspberries gave off a lot of juice overnight), but kept the berries in a separate container until I was ready to serve, and assembled then. Looks gorgeous, tastes wonderful. Had three requests for the recipe almost immediately. I did use my standard pate sucree recipe for the shell, but it is very similar to the one given.

I served this tonight, and it was so beautiful and absolutely delicious. I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the filling, which gave it the oomph of flavor that it needed. I also used Chambord for the liquor, which was excellent.

This tart was amazingly good! I made it for the crowd I feed at the barn, and it was devoured quickly... always a sign that it's a hit :) I used what I had in the house, so it was frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I thawed them, drained all the juice off into the saucepan to simmer with the marmalade. I didn't have berry liqueur, but had Midori, so I used that... and reduced it all to 3 Tbsp. It was beautiful when I first put the berries on, but it soon bled on the mascarpone, and didn't look as pretty. Next time I will add the berries just prior to serving. The mascarpone cream was delicious with the berries! definitely will do again! (next time with fresh berries)

This is the best tart in the universe!! I have made it several times over the years and always had absolutely rave reviews from foodie friends. I highly recommend it. I prefer to use cassis and a mix of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. YUM.

Great recipe! I added some lime zest to the cream filling and it was heavenly.

Absolutely delicious. I made this with strawberries (large ones, but I sliced them thinly), blueberries and raspberries. I think you could use any combination of whatever is in season. Also, instead of dark berry liqueur and orange marmalade, I used peach liqueur and peach preserves. On the advice of another reviewer, I just used a silicone brush to spread on top and I think this works better than pre-mixing it. The tart keeps better and it looks better too. Also on the advice of another reviewer, I dusted with confectioner's sugar and it made this tart look very elegant. Don't forget to calculate in the time for the tart shell to cool...I almost did! Everyone devoured this- there was barely any left!

I have made this recipe for years and it is a simple and tasty dessert. I have always gotten rave reviews. Use whatever fresh fruit is available but it is hard to beat the berries when they are in season.

I think I am in the minority here, but I liked this better chilled (my husband did too) I thought it was very good for such a simple recipe, it took almost no time at all to put together. I used only strawberries and blueberries, and used apple juice concentrate and blackberry jam for the fruit instead of the alcohol (made it for a pregnant friend) The tart looked beautiful when I served it, but again I thought it was better the next day when I ate the leftovers chilled.

This is one of my favorite summer deserts and I often get requests for this tart. One thing I have noticed though is that you need to be careful about what type of mascarpone you use. Many of the domestic versions taste like blotting paper. The mascarpone imported from Italy is wonderful, though twice the price and not always easy to find. In a pinch, I have mixed the two types together with adequate results.

Rating: 3
I agree with previous reviewers that the mascarpone cream just wasn't what I was looking for (which I why I gave it 3 forks). I added the zest of one lemon and 1 teaspoon lemon extract to the mascarpone, and it greatly improved the blandness and added some zing. Also, instead of mixing the berries with the marmalade and liquer, I used a silicone pastry brush and brushed the top of the tart with a little bit of the mixture. This gave it a beautiful sheen without adding a lot of the syupy sweetness. And it held up in the longer in the fridge.

This is the BEST dessert ever! I first made it when it was on the cover of the magazine and it's been a constant in my house ever since. It looks fantastic when served at parties and it's always a hit.

This tart was a hit with my family!! I made it for the first time and served it with Thanksgiving dinner. I read the reviews and the fact that others said it was not sweet actually appealed to me (although I did add vanilla to the mascarpone cream as others suggested). This was so simple to prepare & had an elegant presentation. I will definately be making this again and again.

I was really excited to make this tart considering the rave reviews but I was so disappointed with the results. The mascarpone cream was bland and dull- even the berries didn't seem to liven it up. It needed some lemon juice or some other flavouring to give it a bit of a zing.

I made this with the frozen puff pastry tarts and it was excellent, next time I will try the original sweet pastry dough tart, only because I had a lot of the berries left over, this is definitely a keeper, Delicious!

A fantastic tart that makes the very best of the summer's freshest berries. I often will make it with a crumb crust instead of a tart crust and it's just as delicious. One of my favourites! Ivonne www.creampuffsinvenice.ca

This was an excellent dessert and easy to make. I followed the suggestions of other users and added lemon zest and vanilla to the cheese also a tiny pinch of salt. To make this even easier I used individual frozen puff pastry shells. They worked perfectly. I was lucky to find fresh sweet blackberries at the farmer's market which made this dish all the more tasty. I used what I had at home, apricot preserves(pinch of salt) and Frambois(raspberry liquor). I dusted it with powdered sugar and tiny lime zest strips.

To the cook from nowhere in particular: One of the rules on reviews is that you actually have to MAKE the recipe BEFORE you dump on it! If you had, you would have known exactly how much time it took to prepare prior to your guest arriving. As for the tart itself, I have in fact made it several times and have been well rewarded. Easy to prepare in advance of guests.

I feel like the odd cook out, given all the gushing praise about this, but I don't think it was all that great. The best thing I can say about the mascarpone-based filling was that it was easy. But it was also pretty tasteless. At a minimum, it needs vanilla, as others have mentioned. I am not convinced that it is an improvement over classic pastry cream, and indeed, I think it doesn't measure up. I did the math; assembling it two hours ahead of time means I would be in the kitchen fooling with this well after my dinner guests arrived. That, for me, is a recipe for a bad party.

The tarts were easy to make and the mascarpone cream was a hit. I made my version less sweet by skipping the marmalade and brushing the tops of the berries with a light sugar glaze right before serving.

This has become one of my favorite desserts. The mascarpone cream is the perfect match for the fresh berries. I wouldn't add a thing, the filling should be subtle, emphesizing the berries piled high on top of it.

I served this dish for a small dinner party and it was a huge hit. I followed the other readers suggestions and added vanilla and lemon zest to the mascarpone. I also used the red currant jelly instead of the marmalade. It certainly made for a pretty color for the glaze. And really, putting crust making aside, the rest of the recipe is "easy as pie."

Rating: 4
Loved this tart. Easy and delicious. I made the tart shell and the filling the day before. I left the filling out at room temp for about an hour before assembling the tart to make it easier to spread. I added the fruit at the last minute. Totally eliminated the jam as it just adds too much sweetness. This is a personal preference. The filling with berries will be my new standard dessert this summer when it is just too hot to make the crust.

Delish! Tart-making has become my new hobby. I made this for Easter dinner / my dad's birthday, and it dissapeared. I did add lemon zest and a splash of vanilla like other reviewers suggested, and I definitly think the lemon especially took it to a different level of tastiness. As for the berries on top, I wasn't sure how to arrange them, so I laid them in a single-layer pattern around the outer part, and piled the rest of the berries in the inner part. In terms of difficulty, I'm 19 and this was my second tart (my first was the french apple-almond) and I found it to be no prob and exquisitely yummy. Now go make this recipe! :o)

This was really great! Instead of making the pastry dough, I bought sugar cookie dough pre-made and rolled it out. It worked out pretty good, especially when in a time crunch. The berries were perfect. Instead of measuring out the 1 cup of blackberries, blueberries and raspberries, I just bought the pre-packaged small containers, poured them into a measuring cup, and made up the difference (if any) with extra strawberries. Everyone loved this and wants the recipe.

Rating: 4
The turned out great! Served it after an Italian themed dinner party, and everyone was stuffed but they made sure they had dessert! The recipe did make more fruit than the tart will hold, but it will be good on ice cream today! Also - I would slice the strawberries rather than quartering them if they are large, it will be difficult to slice and serve otherwise.

Rating: 3
I love this tart, but would change the glaze the next time. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used a little vanilla and lemon zest in the cheese. A WONDERFUL and easy change from the more difficult custard that doesn't always set firmly enough to suit. And really delish. You might also use a Kirsch flavoring in the cheese. The crust was also easy and excellent, I thought. Next time, though, I'll use Julia Child's glaze (her strawberry tart recipe), which I think uses red current jelly and Kirsch.

Great tart. The cheese filling was not too sweet, and just tangy enough to highlight the sweetness of the berries. I didn't have berry liquer or apricot preserves, so I substituted orange liquer & mixed berry preserves. I would make again for a special occassion, the cost of berries in my area make it a pricey dessert!

Simply divine! I served this at a recent gathering and everyone raved about it. One person exclaimed it was the best tart he'd ever tasted! The crust behaved fairly well, but did shrink slightly on the sides. I baked it the night before and it was delicious and buttery the next day. I would use the crust recipe again for other tarts as well. The marscapone filling was really tasty, a great match for the crust and berries! The key really is the berries. If you have spendid fresh berries this recipe will certainly dazzle everyone. Also, I made it ahead a few hours and the liquid from the berries leaked right out of the marscapone dam and the crust was fairly wet. Still tasted great, but would likely assemble right before serving. Certainly you can fill the pie with the marscapone and then spoon in the berries just prior to serving. Will make this delight again soon!

Made this for a dessert buffet - I was really apprehensive, since it was my first tart ever. Turned out to be the easiest and most beautiful thing on the table. I made this, a flourless chocolate cake from bon appetit, tiramisu, and the blueberry-lemon layer cake from this site, and people absolutely refused to believe I had made this myself. I can't recommend this highly enough, though I do suggest making it as close to serving time as possible - the juices from the berries do tend to seep out over the marscapone.

Rating: 4
Very good dessert--very pretty, especially for company. I used Brandy and apricot preserves. My only complaint is that after about 45 mins. in the car (not hot), the juice from the berries started leaking through the crust. It still tasted great, though, but keep cold and refrigerated until just before serving.

This tart is beautiful, delicious (creamy, refreshing) and very simple to make. The recipe makes too much pastry dough for a 9-inch tart. I used my own pate sucree recipe the 2nd time I made this, and found it to be better. I vary the berries to what is seasonal and most reasonably priced at the time, and we still like it very much.

The only problem with this recipe was I only made one. My family ate it so fast, I was lucky to get a piece for myself. The mascarpone is so yummy! The crust was easy and delicous. I'm making it again for a dinner party this weekend, but will make six tartlets instead. This was quite an expensive dish considering it's winter and raspberries are $5/half pint! But worth every penny.

this dessert was marvelous. we couldn't find any mascarpone cheese in the store so we used cream cheese and added a little lemon juice - and it turned out great.

This tart tastes devine and looks gorgeous! Have made this recipe twice this summer to rave reviews! Second time was better because I took care to roll the dough evenly to 1/8 inch which keeps it fork-tender. Cutting and serving was easier the second time when I assembled it between the entree and dessert courses and did not bring to room temperature (coolness did not affect the delicious taste).

This was fabulous! I used blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, apricot jam, and brandy. Only mishap - I was in a hurry and thought the recipie said to put the glaze on the berries after it was on the tart - I was wrong, but most of the berries didn't have glaze on them. It was still delicious! I also added vanilla to the cream mixture. This was very easy and suprisingly very refreshing and light (not in fat grams or calories though!) Oh well...it is definately worth it!
