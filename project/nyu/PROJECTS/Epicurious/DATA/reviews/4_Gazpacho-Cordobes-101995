I've been using this recipe for years and I love it, as does everyone I serve it to. It's more work than the standard raw gazpacho you see around, but it's worth it. Roasting the tomatoes and peppers brings out a rich depth to the gazpacho and that tarragon adds a hint of sweetness that is delectable. Since I found this recipe I've never used another for gazpacho.

This was fabulous gazpacho. I didn't use quite as much bread and added a total of five tablespoons of vinegar. I also used an immersion blender with good results. I added triple the amount of tarragon also. I can't imagine a better gazpacho anywhere!

Was just checking this recipe on epicurious as I haven't made it since last summer and I was surprised to find I had not rated it or wrote a review. I make it all the time and it's absolutely the best. It's as good or better than any I have ever had - even in Spain. This time I plan to take the Cook from Madrid's advice and make it without the bread and drizzle the olive oil in while pureeing to thicken it without the extra calories. You'll wish that you had doubled the recipe, so do.

look no further - this is the recipe! It IS a lot of work (I skip the food mill though) but well worth it. My husband loves gazpacho but we couldn't find a recipe that was quite right. This one is the keeper! He won't order it in a restaurant anymore because he knows it won't be as good as this one! A summer staple around here.

This recipe tastes exactly like the delicious gazpacho that I enjoyed in Andulasia. I've tried many different recipes and this seems most like the real thing. It must be the roasted red peppers, roasted tomato and the absence of onion.

Leave yourself a lot of time to prepare this, especially if you're making a larger order. I tripled the recipe and it served 10 people easily, but I had to roast the vegetables in shifts. I used seedless English cucumbers instead of Kirbies and they were fine. This really is a delicious gazpacho.

Made this with a mix of our garden tomatoes and some really good plum tomatoes from the farmer's market. I added a piece of jalapeno, minced, and did not soak the bread in water, just in the tomato mixture. I also opted for cilantro instead of tarragon. Also, I didn't use a food mill, just served it as blended in the food processor. It was really good and I'll be making another batch soon.

Best.Gazpacho.Ever. I never liked gazpacho till I tried this recipe. I make some changes, like I also roast a hot pepper (jalapeno or serrano) and add that in, use cilantro instead of tarragon, and like other reviewers don't use the food mill (I don't even know what this is). Previous reviewer had a good tip about soaking the bread in tomato juice. I also recom. putting the tomatoes and peppers from the oven right into ice- cold water - they cool down faster and are easier to peel (I think). Great warm-weather dish. I serve with pureed avocado (pureed with serranos and lime juice) and blue tortilla chips.

Best recipe I have made for gazpacho. I made it one time as written, and one time subbing 6 cloves of roasted garlic for the raw garlic and adding smoked paprika. Both were super yummy. I could not really taste the tarragon. Served with homemade croutons, a must in my experience. Used balsmaic, as it was all that I had. Soaked the break chunks in tomato juice I had from making homemade sundried tomatos instead of water. Might try with slightly little less oil and bread and some heat next time. Really great though!

Out of necessity I used an immersion blender, didn't use a food mill, and used a small loaf of not-so-crusty whole spelt bread instead of following the recipe verbatim, and it was incredible. I don't know if it was roasting the vegetables, or leaving it overnight, or using so much bread, but the flavour was marvellous, with no obnoxious acidity.

One of my very favorite soups. Sometimes I cut down on the red bells And often I add an extra tbsp vinegar. Alittle vinegar changes the taste a lot.

Very very yummy. I'm not a huge gazpacho fan generally, but this is one of the tastiest cold soups I've had. Roasting the tomatoes and leaving it overnight really makes a difference. I tried to blend some of it up only an hour after I'd made it and it was too acidic. The next day it was noticeably better. I had seconds. I used about half the amount of bread as previous reviews suggested and it was perfect.

I already made this recipe 5 times this summer and got the ovations! Few things to make it easy: 1. DO grill at least tomatoes, it really makes a difference. Cut them in half and with gloves on just peel the skin in one movement. Peppers are little bit harder, but worth it. 2. Do ALL the steps in one single bowl, possibly the same one that you will serve it in. 3.Use just 2 cloves of garlic,or it will overpower the rest. I roasted all the garlic with vegetables. 4. Any bread is good, Italian or baguette. It can get too dense, so keep some extra tomatoes if you want it more liquid. 5.Tarragon sounded weird first, but it adds a little kick. If you don't like it-add basil. 6. I used hand-held immersion mixer. Easier to control the thickness and easier to clean. 7. DO add 1/2 cup of very good olive oil, it makes it much tastier. 8. This gazpacho is good even warm. Enjoy!

I did not put this through a food mill and I'm really glad I didn't. The flavor was delicious but I didn't care for the texture. I like gazpacho to be a little chunkier...I don't know where I came up with this preference, but there's no way around it. For those who like it smooth, this tastes great! I might try it again but this time, emulsifying the liquids, bread, and garlic in the food processor and finely chop the solids by hand, to add at the end.

I thought this was really good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not let it chill for the total time recommended and I skipped the food mill step. It was a bit thicker than I thought it would be, but maybe my bread slices were too big. It was fine, but just thicker than any other gazpacho I have had. Unfortunately, my boyfriend did not like this at all. I'm not really sure why; It may have been the blended up texture - he couldn't really put his finger on it. I think it's just him though - I thought it was great. I might make this again for my family, but not just for the two of us.

I made a double batch with tomatoes and peppers that had been tossed on a grill with some hickory chips for awhile, then I added cucumber, garlic, and a handful of sliced basil (I completely forgot the vinegar and oil). I put it through a food mill and realized that I wouldn't have quite enough for a group of 13, so I made a second single batch in the oven and included the vinegar and oil. The first batch might have been a bit too smoky on its own (though perhaps the missing oil and vinegar would have tempered that), and the second batch was a tad bland, but combined they were perfect. I topped with chives and "shoestring" tortilla crisps, made by cutting a corn tortilla into strips as thinly as possible, then frying in oil for a minute or so, then dusting with salt (ground for a few seconds in a spice grinder so it would adhere well to the crisps). I agree with others who are tired of the "salsa soup" version of gazpacho. This is something I'll make all summer.

Rating: 4
This is "the" gazpacho recipe! The roasting of the tomatoes and pepper in the oven is key. Do not char the pepper on the stove top as it makes them bitter. I like to top it with chopped scallions, avocado, hard boiled egg or capers or all four!

I have also never been a fan of gazpacho, but this is great! It is a bit labor intensive to peel all the vegetables, though. I also used balsamic vinegar, and I skipped the tarragon because I'm not a fan of its liquorish taste (I instead used that as a garnish, along with chopped cucumbers, as another reviewer suggested --great idea!). I also just served bread on the side. I doubled the recipe, and I was, at first, appalled at putting in a cup of oil, but once the soup is blended, it does not look or taste oily.

Being Spanish, having lived in Spain all my life and being fond of cooking, I can tell you that this is the closest recipe to Spanish gazpacho I have ever read or tasted. Every single time abroad it was as if eating salsa with the wrong spices, this taking me to spices, let me say adding basil to this dish makes it less authentic (because noyone in Spain would do so), if you enjoy it that way, just enjoy! Another tip, I have never used tarragon either, but it does seem to work OK. We are not spicy in Spain as another reviewer commented, therefore, we don't use hot sauce, nor pepper in this dish. The only spice I have seen used on gazpacho is cumin, but just a little bit (and this is unusual). And some acceptable tweaks, ommit the bread and just puree for a little while longer with the olive oil drizzling slowly (healthier and creamier) and you may substitute some of the red bell pepper for some green one. And lastly, way too much garlic (1/2 or 3/4 would be fine) and please DO NOT ROAST the vegetables, this is supposed to be a fresh healthy vegetable soup (no cooking is called for) and it would also save you the time and trouble. You can make this in 5 mins (as everybody does here) just by coarsely breaking (not even chopping) all vegetables (no peeling or seeding), pureeing for a while in the blender with the rest of ingredients and then sieving the whole thing in batches. Try it, you will be surprised at the simplicity!

I will add my vote of approval for this recipe and concur that it is the best gazpacho I've ever had. I prefer it a little chunky so only pulsed the food processor and skipped the food mill.

Excellent. Converted a non-gazpacho lover on the spot. I used fresh red basil from my own garden rather than tarragon. I used my own home grown tomatos and some peppers from a friend's garden. Don't over process it. Skip the food mill. Let it have it's texture. The best gazpacho I have ever had.

This is a fantastic gazpacho. I served it with some small cubes of cucumber as garnish. I used SunGold cherry tomatoes from our garden and fire roasted red bell peppers (Mozzetta brand)from the store,white balsamic vinegar, fresh home-grown basil, and for the bread, used a 4 oz ciabatta loaf. As suggested by others, I roasted two large garlic cloves (purple garlic) along with the tomatoes, and soaked the bread in the roasting juices. There was no need to use a food mill as the skins from this type of tomato are quite thin. This produced a beautiful orange-gold soup that was perfectly balanced in flavor and a wonderful texture.

With fresh ingredients, this is unbelieveably good. Well worth the work involved (which is substantial).

This has to be my favourite version of gazpacho. Like another reviewer, I have substituted basil for the tarragon with excellent results.

This is superb. The only gazpacho recipe I have found that even approximates the marvelous soup in Spain. I have tried to modify it, but with little success. You can reduce the amount of bread. Peeling the roasted peppers and tomatoes is a real pain (literally sometimes), but essential. Very timeconsuming but worth every minute.

Excellent. Will replace the gazpacho I usually prepare. Used fresh basil, as somebody suggested (I grow it by my kitchen window). Wasn't messier to prepare than the usual recipe. Loved it!

This is the best and most unique gazpacho I've ever tasted! Of course, I had to make a few minor adjustments, such as adding 2 roasted Hatch chilis for a little heat (spice), used cilantro and fresh basil instead of tarragon, soaked the bread in some juice from tomatoes instead of water, and saved out a bit of the chopped cucumber for chunky texture. Made it 3 hours before eating, it was fabulous! Seeded tomatoes and peppers as I went so didn't need the final step of food mill. As others said, this was much more work than other gazpacho recipes, but worth every second.

I've been a gazpacho fan for years, and this is, by far, the best recipe I've ever tried. I worried my tomatoes weren't ripe enough, and I didn't really have very good bread. I also didn't have time to chill it 8 hours. Nonetheless, it was exceptional. Can't wait to make it again with better tomatoes and bread. Yes, it requires some prep time and lots of bowls, but it's definitely worth it.

This was a wonderful gazpacho! We grilled the red peppers and tomatoes with wood chips instead of cooking in the oven. This added a wonderful smoked flavor. I made it once with fresh garlic minced into the soup and another time with jarred pre-peeled...no surprise, the fresh garlic added a much better flavor.

I just returned from Spain where I had gazpacho. This one iwas far better. It's a lot of work, roasting & chopping, but well worth the effort. My guests were effusive in their praise. This will be a definite Summer "keeper" Try a pale sherry with i, it complements the rich flavour.

This is the first good gazpacho recipe I've seen online or in a publication. As a vegan, I loved and craved the rich and creamy gazpacho I had in the bars of seville. This version is great, but I also make a simple one in the summer from veggies: 2 whole tomatos (not peeled or seeded), peeled and seeded cucumber, 2 small or 1 large red pepper all pureed in the blender. Add some hot pepper and some sherry vinegar. Add around 1/4 of bread crumbs (homemade, not soaked in water). Finish with salt and pepper, and add olive oil to taste with blender running so the mixture emulsifies and becomes creamy. I sometimes mix in a spoonful or two of basil or arugula pesto for garnish. Yum!

While I usually like roasted veggies, I was concerned that in this dish roasting would take away from the "fresh" taste. I was wrong. This is delicious and the cucumbers keep it tasting fresh. I took the advice of another reviewer and soaked the bread in the saved tomato & pepper juices -- good thing, I fear that adding water would have thinned this beautiful, thick, creamy soup. I did food mill as recipe instructs,but I'm not sure the bit of stuff strained made much difference to the already smooth texture.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. Roasting the vegetables makes all the difference and brings out the incredible ripe flavours of the tomatoes and peppers. I used 5 garlics, substituted fresh basil for tarragon, and used 1/5 cup of sherry vinegar, and 1/2 cup of Spanish dry sherry. Does improve with each day. My friends loved it so much, that I am making more today to use for dinner party tomorrow.

I've been in Spain for 15 years, and this is almost exactly the recipe I use. I had never added tarragon, which was nice, and generally like a little cumin. Being a vinegar lover, I also like to try out different kinds. Balsamic makes a more elegant soup, and I've discovered that a little splash of raspberry vinegar gives it a sweet/tangy kick.

This recipe takes a good amount of time, and the oven-roasting is mildly annoying in the heat of summer, but the result is truly fabulous. I've made this soup several times at dinner parties, to great raves each time.

I am happy to have found a gazpacho recipe that does not end up tasting like salsa or like V-8. I am happy, too, that others are fervently discussing its authenticity while I am quietly lapping up every drop. I added three cloves of garlic, but threw them (before peeling) into the pan with the roasting tomatoes. I soaked the bread cubes in the pan juices from the roasted tomatoes instead of in water. I strained the tomato seeds out as I was peeling them, rather than go through the food mill step. I like a little texture anyway.

Rating: 4
This is an extremely easy dish that I make all through out summer. I have had friends over that rave about this gazpacho and request it each year! One word of advise. 4 cloves of garlic is not necessary for this recipe. In fact, it overwhelms the soup to the point that you cannot taste the other vegetables. 2 cloves is sufficient. The garlic flavor bleeds into the sauce after a few hours and is something that intially can tast perfectly seasoned and then an hour later taste completely like garlic. Still overall a fabulous soup.

having lived in andalucia, i have to disagree with the reviewer from san francisco. a salmorejo is a soup made with pureed tomatoes and garlic, with the addition of crumbled hard boiled egg and slices (or "daditos") of jamon serrano. the salmorejo does not contain cucumber or onion. also, i have never seen it with eggplant either, but rather spread (he is right about it having a thick consistency) on hearty bread almost like a openfaced sandwich.

Having lived in Spain off and on again over the last 35 years, I was a bit surprised to see this dish with roasted tomatoes and peppers. The gazpacho recipe that our cooked learned from the cook of Juan Belmonte is all fresh ingredients which are chopped up, salted and refrigerated overnight before pureeing the next day. All vegetables are seeded and peeled before hand.

quite a good gazpacho cordobes. in spain this is calld salmorejo....which is what i know it by. having spent a great deal of time in cordoba i can say this has areltively authntic feel. my one gripe would be the roasting of the vegetables...but as many know gazpacho recipes in spain are as numerous as the leaves on the trees. from andalucia to la mancha to extredmadura you'll encounter one form completely different from the other. here you'll really taste the delicacy of andalucia's moorish and gypsy heritage coupled with its robust bullfighter spirit. salmorejo is known for its thick,cosistency...food of bullfighters.(remember cordoba was the birthplace of manolete) this is one element you want to be quite aware of for a true salmorejo. thincker than a cream but just a slight less that a spread. tapas bars in cordoba you'll more often than not be given a bowl of salmorejo topped with wafer thin slices of fried aubergine and either sliced pieces of fried bread or paper thin slices of serrano ham. add these if you want that added authenticity. further essentials are: the best quality tomatoes you can get your hands on. there's no comprimise here. poor tomatoes euals a terrible gazpacho. a very good quality olive oil...use a very fruity spanish or greek brand. as the previous reviewer noted, gazpacho(in any of its regional incarnations) is not at all to be firey. spaniards are not known for their love of spicy food. (this is essential when cooking the cuisine of espana) a common miscoception for most americans is that spanish and mexican food are easily interchangible when it comes to spices and everyday dishes...this simply is not so.

I had gazpacho before traveling to Spain and thought I knew what it was all about - but I didn't! There are as many "authentic" gazpacho recipes as there are cooks in Andalusia. My favorite gazpacho has substance to it (I like cream soups, too) which this recipe has. The bread gives it body. Gazpacho should not be firey. It should taste like a pureed fresh salad. This recipe is everything I want in gazpacho.
