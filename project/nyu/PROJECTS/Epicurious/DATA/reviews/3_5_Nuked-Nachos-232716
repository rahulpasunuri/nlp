Nachos aren't exactly a high-concept food, so the fact that this recipe calls for one ingredient from a can is not such a big deal. At any rate, it does the job when you're in the mood for meat-free nachos without having to head to the local Mexican place. Following ofdouglas's advice, I mixed the ingredients before microwaving, and use lime-flavored chips. If you want more work to do, you can always chop up vegetables and make your own salsa, or brown some ground beef and add it in. But it doesn't really need it.

because the sign of a great recipe is that "everything comes from a can or a bag"

I used more salsa and less cheese, as well as some cumin and tabasco. Also, I blended the ingredients together in a bowl before nuking. I say keep the chips separate if you're using a microwave.

To the scoffers - get over yourselves. Does everything that tastes good actually have to be hard to make or require ingredients you can't get at a basic grocery store? Remember that it probably wasn't pate de foie gras that got you interested in cooking.

Not bad for having the guys over for the game; this is actually sort-of nutritious. But please, can we teach our children how to actually cook before sending them out into the world?

The presentation is nice (I used a large clear glass platter) -- it was a hit at my block party with adults and kids alike. I didn't have cilantro, so I substituted some chopped black olives for color. It was great to have something I could make very quickly from ingredients already in my house!

I don't know which is worse- that people needed a recipe to melt cheese on their nachos or that they took the time to write in and comment on it as if this was superior to all of the other nacho recipes out there.

This is a great recipe for Nachos, I decided to spice it up with some strips of steak marinated in a tequila and lime marinade it was great.

For minimum effort and minimal expense, and maximum results, 4 forks. I doubled the recipe in anticipation, wise choice. For even less work, just use 1 layer per ingredient.
