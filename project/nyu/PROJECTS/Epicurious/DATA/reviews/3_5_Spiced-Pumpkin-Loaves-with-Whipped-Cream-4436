Underwhelmed, esp. after reviews. Minimal spice. Can't tell there is pumpkin in the bread. Mostly the brown sugar

Fine, but underwhelming. I took the advice here and lowered the sugar amount, which is definitely a good idea.

This is a wonderful fall dessert! People said they would buy it if they could. I halved the recipe for one loaf, and was generous on the pumpkin. Did not serve it with whipped cream, but it was still delicious.

Made this a few years ago. Just made it again for a baby shower and it was just as delicious. Instead of making a regular loaf, I used the baby loaf pans and they were like little cakes. Yummy!

Delicious and easy. I did use less sugar (2/3 c) and reduced oil to 1/2 c and put in a whole big can of pumpkin. Also used almond flour (1c); whole wheat flour (1c) and unbleached white (2c). Since I had the 8.5 size loaf pans, I filled them 2/3 full (2 of them) and cooked them in a convection oven on 325 for one hour. Put the remainder in tiny heartshaped pans and cooked 15-20 minutes. Also used creamcheese frosting as a glaze on top. Yumm.

Halved the recipe to make 1 loaf, but was still generous with spices, nuts and fruit. Didn't serve with cream this time, but will the next. Nice and easy for casual fall entertaining.

FOllowed suggestion of 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, everything else as on recipe-loaves came out very dense, heavy and looked like not cooked in the middle. Had to throw out the whole thing! What do you think went wrong?

My family loves this recipe. It's a great addition to a holiday gift basket.

This was a huge hit at a post-Thanksgiving dinner (had to use up all that leftover pumpkin puree!). I took the applesauce advice, which I think is a good idea. I don't like pecans, so I substituted the same volume of dried currants, and that worked out to perfection. This doesn't even require the whipped cream!

This is excellent bread, although I did think it was a little too sweet. However, I took the bread to work and everyone loved it! I'll definitely make this one again.

This was an easy recipe, I recommend it for beginners such as myself! It came out great. The only changes I made was that I accidentally forgot the ginger and used a bunt-cake pan instead of two loaf pans. Everyone loved it!

WOW-this baby really rises.Looks great,tastes great. I personally like a few more nuts (used walnuts) so will increase that next time. The applesauce sounds like a great idea, thanks. I made only 1 loaf and had to cook it for the full time. Definately use the foil. keeprer!

This pumpkin bread is just wonderful! Moist, spicey and yummy. Please note its important to cover the loaf w/ foil for baking and use proper pan size. I did it first in smaller pans w/out covering --its makes a difference. I omitted the raisins and the whip cream--and still it was terrific!

I made this last night and brought some to work. Everyone loved it. I made it with half whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of veg oil and it tastes wonderful. Very dense even though it rose well, very flavorful. I agree with more pecans, maybe a half a cup and just a tad more pumpkin and applesauce.

Whoa! Excellent recipe...would definitely make it again. Next time, I'll add more pecans and add a cup of apple sauce, which will allow me to cut the vegetable oil in half and completely drop the cup of sugar.

I made this recipe for the first time over this past weekend and brought it to my in-laws for a post - dinner sweet. It was delicious, and everyone raved!! I liked the fact that the cake was quite moist and that the spices were subtle but perfectly balanced with the pumpkin flavor. I omitted the raisins because I did not have any on hand, but the pecans added a nice texture and subtle flavor. The bread also has a lovely appearance - a tall rise and deep orange color...perfect for the autumn harvest or anytime.

The best pumpkin bread I've made to date. I've made it several times for Thanksgiving and Christmas and we're always fighting for the last piece. Excellent, even without the whipped cream (In fact, I've never tried it with the cream).
