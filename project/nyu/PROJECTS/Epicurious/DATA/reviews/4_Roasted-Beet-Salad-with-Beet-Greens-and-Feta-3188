To be fair, I used this more as a base of an idea than anything else. The other reviewers inspired me so I used just a splash of olive oil, omitted capers (as didn't have any) and substituted pine nuts for feta. So I can't really review but the idea is fabulous and easy and I love not dumping all of those beautiful leaves!

It was a hot day, and I put the beets (washed and trimmed) to cook directly on the grill, heated to med-low. They cooked for about 90 minutes, and they were incredibly delicious. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. Maybe a few more capers next time... This is a keeper.

I've always wanted to try a beet greens salad and I'm so glad I finally did! This was incredibly yummy and easy to make. I subbed balsamic vinegar and just drizzled in with olive oil. That seems like a lot of oil - I probably used about 2 T instead. Also used gorgonzola instead of feta because that's what we had. Threw in a handful of pinenuts for added texture and color. Very tasty!

Fabulously delicious and so easy!!! I roasted gold and red 3" beets at 375ºF drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkling of salt & pepper. No need to peel; these came out very tender. I didn't have anymore red wine vinegar, so I subbed fresh lime juice. What makes this salad satisfying and sublime is the combination of the feta, capers and garlic with the beets and their greens. So good. A keeper.

This is a summer staple in our family once beets hit the farmer's market. But, with a twist. We make the recipe as noted and mix it in with a pound of pasta. Voila. A main course that dazzles.

This was very easy and very tasty. I used boiled beats and added a small splash of balsamic and pine nuts to the finished dish. I did not cook the greens, because I did not have much. I simply rinsed, cut the stems out, chopped them, and then tossed with the dressing. I served the beets on top of the greens. Made this for brunch, and it disappeared.

This salad was delicious, made with fresh beets from the farmers market. I did not have feta but did add sliced fennel and onions. The capers did add a wonderful flavor and enhanced the beets. I like the dark green of the greens which added color contrast and lots of vitamins. yum

This is a great salad! I added an orange, as suggested in other recipes, and it made the salad really pretty. The citrus flavor was very subdued and not too sweet at all. I left out the capers. I wrapped the beets in aluminum foil and roasted them at 400 degrees, then peeled them when they were cool.

Rating: 4
Delicious; I subbed an equal amount of roasted garlic for fresh, which was milder. The dressing lacked punch, so I added a bit of minced lemon peel and juice. The capers were a great flavor booster. Feta was good; next time, I'll use blue cheese, because I like sharp flavors. I used beets I had roasted and refrigerated several days earlier. I had accidentally slightly undercooked them, so they were firm and very slightly crunchy -- delicious!

This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and thought that the capers really added complexity.

Just excellent! So simple and elegant, and very tasty. I omitted the capers and used golden beets, which I had on hand. Actually also used the leftover greens which had been sauteed and eaten a few days before. Wonderful salad!

You've gotta love beets to like this recipe. Luckily, I *love* beets. This salad is wonderful and so healthy. It's pretty mild considering the strong flavors that go into it. And the leftovers serve very nicely.

I followed the suggestion of some of the other cooks and substituted toasted pignolis for capers. This was really delicious and even my picky husband ate it happily. My only complaint is that it was so, so garlicky that I felt like I reeked after I ate it. I'm making it tonight with pink beets and will be reducing the amount of garlic.

I substituted toasted pine nuts for the capers. It was really good, but super garlicky. I would make it again, but with small cloves of garlic.

Although I am a huge beet fan I was in a pickle as to what to do with the quantity of beets and their greens I get from my CSA. This recipe cures my beet cravings while using the greens as well. (I too cut down on the garlic.)

This was a great, light meal that worked on a hot day. I added toasted pine nuts and it turned out delicious! I am making this again tonight, with a balsamic, thyme and mustard dressing. I like the recommendation to add golden beets with the red. I bet that would be beautiful (and less red).

Rating: 4
This recipe was great! I did change a bit, boiled some kale for 10 minutes then added it into the greens. No capers, but it still turned out fabulous. I tossed everything together so the feta was hot pink! I had two guys that "do not eat beets" practically licking the plate!

Wonderful! I have made this several times and all my guests, beet lovers and beet non-lovers alike return for seconds and thirds. There are never any leftovers. Everyone wants the recipe! The only difficulty is there often is not enough beet greens for proper proportions to the beets. I've substituted red chard when necessary.

I love a good beet salad and this is quite nice! Thankfully the CSA I belong to left the beet greens on. The greens soak up the dressing very well so I'd recommend chopping it finely. I almost always double garlic in recipes (since I love it!) but because this is raw it gave the dish quite a bite! Next time I'll comply with the recipe directions (bad chef...slaps own hand...bad chef). Enjoy!

Made this with wilted kale, as my beets were also "topless" :) I microwaved the beets for about 20 minutes in a covered dish with water, which left them peelable, but crunchy. This was healthy, easy, and tasty!

This salad was simple and elegant and packed with flavor. It looked like something that could be served at a 5 star restaurant and was a great alternative to a traditional green salad. The dressing was the right ratio of vinegar to oil. Instead of capers, I used sliced green olives on the top which was very pretty. (I don't happen to be fond of capers)

I have been using this recipe for three beet seasons. It is absolutely scrumptious! This year, we planted beets in the garden and are still reaping the pleasures in October! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone had seconds. The more feta, the better. Toss it while it's hot! With fresh bread, it's a meal in itself!

My mother fed me canned beets as a child so no wonder I avoided beets as an adult, but these fresh roas ted beets are to die for(figuratively speaking) We just loved this recipe. I wrapped the beets in tinfoil and baked them which makes the skins easy to remove. The beets were even better the second day!

Rating: 0
I think wrapping whole unpeeled beets in foil and then baking is much easier than the method listed here. After roasting beets, the skins slide right off. I used balsamic vinegar and a mix of red and yellow beets. Stems can also be used, just need to cook a little longer (put in pan first). Goat cheese is a great substitution. Simple and delicious dish!

great summer salad. i had fresh beets from the farmer's market (no beet greens) so i used spinach instead. i also added some red onions that i carmelized w/balsamic vinegar to the salad.

Rating: 4
We love this recipe, but have found that, when available, golden beets appear to consistently have a greater quantity of greens (which are also less bitter) than red beet greens. Making the recipe with red beets always requires that I supplement the beet greens with another green. Despite the current plethora of beet salads being touted in restaurants, I have not yet tasted one that surpassed the simplicity and overall flavor of this one.

Rating: 3
Love this dish and people who claim they don't like beets have eaten this dish. Try using kale if you need more beet greens-some farmers markets will sell them to you, too, but in a pinch, kale will work. Add goat cheese just before you serve it and make sure that the greens are well drained, otherwise it gets soggy.

We had bought fresh beets/greens and goat's milk feta at the local farmers market. It made a wonderful salad and the feta was mild. I didn't think it needed all the dressing to make the salad full of flavor. Will be making this again!

This is the second summer I've used this recipe. Everytime I come across fresh beets with greens, I pick them up and whip up this fantastic salad. The combination of flavours is superb: sweet and tart! The feta adds that extra little kick. Not only is it delicious...it's absolutely healthful!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorites. I make it several times over the summer when beets are new and fresh. I often use different varieties of beets, including yellow and striped. The one problem I ALWAYS have with it is not enough greens with a bunch of beets. Does anyone buy beet greens separately?

Can we really say these beets are roasted, when there was water in the pan? I really didn't see much difference between these and steamed beets. But I like beets and beet greens, so I liked this salad. And it's beautiful to look at. If I make it again, I'll really roast the beets.

I have boiled beets before but never roasted them. Now I am a roasted beet convert. Roasting makes the skin come off in a snap! I was able to peel the beets with my bare hands. This dish was very tasty. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the greens. They were a very welcomed addition. Reminded me of spinach with a heartier texture. I didn't have capers so I used celery root. And unfortunatly I didn't have any feta. Next time I would love to add some. True, this is a little messy due to the fact that everything turns pink during preparation, but all the pink comes off very easily. I enjoyed the contrast between the sweetness of the beets and the tanginess of the vinaigarette. For me this recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is FABULOUS! Use the salted capers instead of the pickled ones, it adds a great flavour. I have used both goat and cow feta, and really preferred the goat to the cow. I have made this countless times and love it more every time I make it -- as do my guests.

Steamed the beets, saved a lot on time, don't think it compromised the flavor at all. Didn't have capers on hand (gasp!), but the feta gave it enough salt/tang. My husband, a major beet hater, enjoyed this because "the beets didn't taste like dirt" (obviously didn't marry him for his culinary finesse). Will make for Xmas; perfect colors!

I discovered this recipe online about two weeks ago and have already made it twice. I've always liked beets, but this preparation is, by far, the tastiest I've ever had.

I thought I didn't like beets but was willing to give them another try when they came in my organic fruits and veggies box. Apparently I don't like canned beets, but fresh beets are delicious.

Another 3.5--I don't think I've ever cooked anything at home that was "a dish beyond compare. I served this as a first course at a dinner party featuring grilled lamb. Using my husband's great-grandmother's 150 year old china I arranged the sald on individual plates. The plates are white with a dark blue pattern and the colors were gorgeous! I roasted and marinated the beets the day before and they were great. I also sprinkled some toasted chopped walnuts on each serveing. One caution; for optimum presentation, maintain color contrast by sprinkling the feta at the last possible second as it will turn pink very quickly from the beets.
