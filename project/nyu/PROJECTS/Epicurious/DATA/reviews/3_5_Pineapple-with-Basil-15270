What a simple and refreshing salad. This was such a hit at our potluck. Amazing what a few good, fresh ingredients can do. I can't wait to make it again.

I didn't like this at all and I'm a pretty adventurous eater - it may be that it's Winter and not pineapple nor basil season...will try again in Summer.

This is very good and as stated below - delicious with vanilla ice cream. An unexpected but yummy combination. Do try it.

I made this for my s.o.'s 45th surprise birthday party, as he doesn't like cake icing. this was a huge hit with everyone and no one could believe that basil was the "secret" ingredient. I added fresh strawberries and blueberries to the pineapple for color and variety and spooned it over slices of lemon pound cake with ice cream. WOW!

I have made this for years and each time it is a big hit with guests and so easy!

I didn't actually try this dish, but I often toss pineapple with lemon juice and sliced Japanese shiso leaves, which is also delicious and unique. I highly recommend trying it if you can find the shiso. Looking forward to trying the basil too!

I too was hesitant at first because it sounded "odd". Being an adventurous eater and seeing how quick and easy it was, I made it for a summer bbq. The theme was "Simply Exotic" and the pineapple was the perfect ending. I also made the Coconut milk ice cream from this site and store bought pound cake. After "daring" my friends to try the pineapple, I watched everything disappear. The only one who didn't touch it was my husband - his palate is a real challenge. Oh well, more for me.

Amazing! Great alone or on cake or with ice cream or in a cocktail. Will never think of basil as merely savory again.

I was looking for something different to use up the copious amounts of basil we get from our CSA, and I found this. Its great by itself or over pound cake. We also enjoy it with Pimms - fill a tall glass with the chilled pineapple basil mixture, fill a third full with Pimms No 1, and top off with cold gingerale.

I made this for my boyfriends' birthday party. He does not care for cakes with icing, so I tried this out on him and 30 or so of his closest friends. This was fantastic combined with other seasonal fruit and served over lemon pound cake, with the syrup drizzled over the cake to further moisten it. That and some ice cream and it was a huge hit! Everyone thought the herb was mint and couldn't believe it was basil.

Surprisingly delicious combination and a very refreshing side dish. A keeper.

Very easy to make. The first bites are good, but after that it starts getting to be too much. My husband did not like it at all. If I were to make it again, I would possible serve one pineapple ring along side something else. Just so you don't get overwhelmed with the taste.

This is fantastic.. simple.. easy.. and it's always been a hit when I make it.

I served this as a luncheon side-dish with spicy grilled cheese sandwiches and it was a hit. I made the sandwiches with sour-dough bread spread with a little pureed chipotle chili, thinly sliced Jack cheese, tomatoes, very thinly sliced onion and a little cilantro. The pineapple, with purple basil from my garden, made a very refreshing contrast.

I found this to be wonderful and fresh. I added romaine lettuce, red onion, used fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, and fennel root. Chilled and then added tomatoes before serving. Served it with beef marinated in sauce baked. Would recommend this to anyone.

I liked it but my Ohio neighbors were hesitant to even try! It was one of the items I made for a Mexican themed party (found it because of the reference to it in the Mexican Brownie reviews. Quick and easy to make and if you are willing to try things beyond the "normal" combinations you might even like it

Tasty and simple. Would try it again, maybe with a slice of almond or pound cake. It's so acidic, it needs something to go with it.

I have to admit I was skeptical about this combination but previous reviews persuaded me to try it (with vanilla ice cream on hand just in case the guests didn't like it). It was a hit! Fantastic combination! and tasted great topped with vanilla ice cream, too!

This is tasty by itself, but when served with the Coconut Pudding with Tropical fruit recipe, it is out of this world! I substituted lime juice for the lemon and used this recipe instead of the tropical fruit. Superb!

I was combing the site looking for something to do with the first fresh pineapple I ever bought. A fine choice! Two warnings: don't scrimp on the basil, and be careful, the tartness of the pineapple and lemon together hurt my tongue!!! At any rate, a nice blend of flavors. Too simple NOT to try.

I love recipes such as this one. So easy but different...intriguing. Basil goes very well with pineapple and I imagine it might go well with many other tart/acidic fruits as well.

It was surprising how delicious this simple dish was. The basil and pineapple were a great combination, and it took barely any time to make.
