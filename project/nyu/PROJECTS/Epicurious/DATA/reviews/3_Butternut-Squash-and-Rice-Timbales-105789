I doubled the recipe. Considering the ingredients, I was very surprised when this turned out bland. The other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem, so maybe this just wasn't for me. It made a very nice presentaion, but it needed something more.

This is a wonderful dish! For an even more healthful twist, I used brown rice. Very easy to prepare and delicious. I easily a meal in itself.
