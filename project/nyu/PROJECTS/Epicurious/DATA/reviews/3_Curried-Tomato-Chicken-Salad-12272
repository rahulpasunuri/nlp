This was tasty, but it needs something a little more, like sweet potatoes or some dried fruit. I also used tomato soup instead of juice and it turned out great. Will make it again.

I used tomato soup instead of tomato juice and added a 1/4 cup of raisins to add the sweetness that other users commented worked out well for them. Definitely like it better hot than cold- makes for a good weeknight meal over brown rice.

I thought this was great- simple to make and tasty. I used real tomatoes with their juice rather than canned juice and omitted the yogurt. I served it room temp and everyone enjoyed it. Will definately make it again.

This dish seems much better suited to serving hot than chilled, so I served it hot over rice. I added more of the chutney. It was quite good and rather unusual. My husband liked it. Incidentally, I did saute the curry powder with the onions.

Very good dish, but all of the curried salads on this site leave out a very important step: cooking the curry powder for about a minute with the sauteed onions. If you are making a dressing that doesn't require cooking, the curry powder needs to be heated in a dry skillet over moderate heat until fragrant. This step eliminates the grittiness that curry powder has without cooking, making the dish much more pleasant. Seedless red grapes, quartered, make a nice addition. The yogurt makes this smooth and cooling.

I make this all the time. Sometimes I leave out the yogurt and serve it hot, or add cream or coconut milk and serve it hot w/ cous cous. Very easy and popular.

Wonderful and healthy. I used chopped tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, sauted them briefly with the onion. Substituted apricot jam for the chutney and used champagne vinegar. Everyone asked for the recipe - usually a sign of success.

I had all the ingredients at home except the chutney, so after reading Gemma's review I decided to try jam instead. What I ended up using was orange/pineapple/cherry marmalade and it tasted surprisingly good. I used leftover chicken and that made it extremely fast too. Good thing I halved the recipe for 2 people or we would have stuffed ourselves!

Although I have not made this it sounds very much like Coronation Chicken which was a dish invented for the Coronation of Queen Victoria. It is now a very popular English Summer Salad Dish, which is often used at weddings and large formal events. The difference is that Coronation Chicken has apricot jam in it to give it a little sweetness.
