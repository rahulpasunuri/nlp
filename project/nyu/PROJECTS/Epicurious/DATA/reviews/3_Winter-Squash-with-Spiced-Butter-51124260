Followed the recipe and steamed the squash - even thought I know it would probably be better roasted. BIG MISTAKE. If you make this recipe, do as the others who have reviewed it have done and roast the squash. It is not good steamed. The pomegranate seeds are wonderful with the squash - do not omit them.

I made this dish for a TG dinner with friends, including 2 chefs. Everybody loved it, especially the chefs! This dish was fun to make, although I also roasted the squash rather than boil it. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I roasted butternut, kabocha and acorn squash, all at 400 for 30 minutes. All came out perfect - it couldn't have been easier. I chose to grind and zest most of the spices, some of which I bought fresh. It made a difference and it was fun, too!

I made this for TG with a few tweaks. I roasted the squash which was brushed with olive oil and butter mixture. However I made the butter mixture the day before and found it bitter, as the lime was too overpowering, so I melted some of the butter mixture and mixed in some maple syrup to sweeten it up before I brushed it on the squash. I then served it with the rest of the butter/maple syrup drizzled on top then added the pomegranates at the end. Beautiful. I just wish there was more meat on the squash rinds :)

The spice butter is delicious. I'm sorry to review a recipe where I didn't follow instructions. I roasted the squash with the spice butter. It seemed bland given there are so many spices. The next day however, it was very flavorful. I used freshly ground cardamom. That flavor really pops. I will try it again by applying the spice butter after I roast the squash. I just couldnt boil the squash when roasting is so yummy.
