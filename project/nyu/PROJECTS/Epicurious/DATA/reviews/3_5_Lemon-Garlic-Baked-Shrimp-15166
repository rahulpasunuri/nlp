for ease and simplicity this would merit 3 1/2 stars...i had fishmonger shell the fish for me for a tip and used my mini processor for the parsley so i think prep took about 4min.be careful to check on garlic and also shrimp to prevent being overdone. my garlic took less than 4 min. and my shrimp about 5-6 min. due to being less than jumbo. i always find that shrimp is always done before recipes say. it continues to cook in pan when you remove from oven. i will double the garlic, add the butter and red pepper flakes as others have suggested next time. there are other delicious recipes for baked shrimp but this is quickest and showcases the fresh ingredients. enjoy.

I think this tasted fine, but the cooking times seemed to be a little off. I tried baking the garlic for 5 minutes and succeeded in setting off every smoke detector in my house and turning the garlic to charcoal. The second time went better. Paired it with an Epi recipe for "Couscous with Fresh Cilantro and Lemon Juice"

I've made this recipe many times. Simple and delicious, everyone loves it. I add a little white wine and serve with a salad and crusty bread.

Definitely use no more than half the olive oil, and add a little extra garlic for additional flavor. Delicious.

I thought this recipe was awful. No taste & the shrimp came out rubbery. I ate about 3 shrimp & had to throw the rest out. Luckily I made a great salad to go with it so my husband & I ended up eating the salad & bread for dinner. What a waste!

so simple and delish!! used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, sprinkled with parmesan cheese. oregano would be a good sub if you don't have parsley. one of my boyfriend's "new favorites."

It may be hard to believe I would give such a simple dish a four forks rating, but it really is one of the best ways to prepare shrimp. How can you go wrong with lemon, garlic, and olive oil? SIMPLY excellent.

I made this receipe, as noted, using 1/2 butter, 1/2 oil and, folks, it was AMAZING. I tossed the shrimp with some linguine, purple onion, zucchini and grape tomatoes - - sprinkled with a bit of fresh parmesan cheese and used the leftover butter/garlic for the "sauce". My supper club loved it!

I can't believe it, I have finally found a recipe on Epicurious that I didn't like! I found this to be bland (I used alot of garlic, sub 1/2 butter for 1/2 the olive oil) then followed recipe as stated. The shrimp came out poached, not flavored as I thought they would. I think I really prefer this type of dish done in a saute pan where I am able to cook shrimp, remove from pan and then deglaze with wine and lemon. Won't make again.

A wonderful dish, easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. I add a bay leaf, a little white wine, finely chopped shallots, and sweet, colorful mini peppers that I get at Whole Foods - sliced into very thin rings for added flavor and a beautiful presentation.

A very easy, quick, and delicious dish. I have made it several times--used half butter/half olive oil like suggested. Great recipe if you are just learning to cook.

Rating: 4
Simply fantastic! I also followed previous suggestions and used half butter and half olive oil and extra garlic. I have served this both over crusty bread and tossed with lemon-pepper linguine and I am not sure yet which is my favorite. I will certainly be making this again.

Excellent weekday meal. Followed all of previous reviewers' helpful hints: less oil, add butter, bake parsley with main ingredients, way more garlic, add hot pepper flakes and serve tossed with lemon-pepper linguine. Also sprinkled end result with parmesan. Chardonnay and crusty Italian loaf made for a fabulous dinner.

This is incredibly simple recipe and really tasty. Great for a weeknight meal. I served it with bread and baked squash...perfect. Definitely making this again.

Extremely simple and quite tasty. I wondered why I hadn't thought of it myself. I will definitely make this again.

Actually would give this dish 3.5 forks. Took other cooks' suggestions and added crushed red pepper flakes, and tossed the shrimp in capellini... soooo yummy! A definite keeper. Will try again using 1/2 parsley 1/2 fresh oregano...

I added some crushed red pepper with the shrimp and tossed the shrimp with fresh pasta... to die for.

Didn't have any parsley. Used dried oregano, dried red pepper flakes, and garlic (and lemon). Delish! This recipe is more of a technique - you can experiment with fresh herbs and spices (within reason). make sure to mop up the sauce with crusty bread.

Good, quick and easy!

It was a light and easy dish, which was good. I doubled the recipe and did not use enough garlic (I will not make that mistake next time). There was four of us for dinner, so I cooked a steak which made for a great shrimp/steak combo...!

This was a light, tasty easy dish. Perfect for summertime, or when you are in a hurry. I served it over rice, but it would be good over pasta, too.

I stir-fried the whole thing instead of baking, browning the garlic first, and served over rice. I didn't have parsley on hand and used green onions instead. Very nice.

This recipe was fabulous. The most tender shrimp I have ever had. I would cut the amount of parsley in 1/2 next time. I put in part of it when the shrimp went in. We thought it tasted better with some of it cooked. I only used 2T. of olive oil. That was plenty.

I thought this was really yummy. I had half a pound of shrimp and only used 1 tbl of oil and about half that much butter. I also used less parsley and tossed it all in before cooking; the shrimp were perfect after only four minutes. Very quick and light.

This dish was so good --great flavor! I added about 1/2 tablespoon more of the lemon juice so the dish wasn't as greasy as some people experienced. I served it to my boyfriend and my brother and they both loved it. Didn't have pasta or mash potatoes with this, just warm crusty bread --it was YUMMY!

If you like lemon and garlic, this is a wonderful and fresh tasting way to cook shrimp. And a really crispy crunchy bread to go with it is great. Tonight I'm gonna try it with some garlic smashed potatoes and sesame soy baby green beans.

My boyfriend and I stayed in last New Year's Eve, and I made this as our main dish. In all honesty, if this was our only dish, we would have been disappointed. It was really rather greasy. I have made it since using less oil and more lemon juice, and it turns out quite nicely. Pretty easy also.

I've made this a few times now, and while I like it and find it tremendously easy, I couldn't say I love it. I think maybe substituting half the olive oil with butter (while less healthy) would give it a bit more body and make it seem less greasy.

This was excellent! I added parsley like the other reviewer recommended. Served over rice and ate the whole thing!!

Rating: 3
This is delicious and very easy. We love garlic, and so I added 5 cloves instead of just the three. Also, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked half of the parsley with the shrimp, with very good results. I served it over fresh garlic and parsley-flavored linguini and with plenty of bread. Yum!

Rating: 3
This is super-easy to prepare and tastes great. I took the other reviewer's advice and cooked half of the parsley with the shrimp (curly, didn't have any flat-leaf). It only needed to cook three minutes per side. Served it over basmati rice and my husband practically licked his plate. A great quick meal.

Absolutely declicious and extremely easy!

I LOVE this dish. I make it all the time and it is my husband to be's favorite. I usually serve it over pasta with warm bread and every last drop is gone!

I mixed in 1/2 the parsley with the shrimp before I baked it, and then sprinkled the other 1/2 on before serving. The raw parsley was too stiff, especially chopped coarse; the baked parsley was cooked just enough to take that rawness out and blend it with the dish. I recommend this revision to the dish; otherwise it was very good served over Texmati rice.
