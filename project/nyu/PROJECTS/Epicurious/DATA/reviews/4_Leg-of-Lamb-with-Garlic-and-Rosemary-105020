my new go to recipe! I double the paste as I like a really salty crust and it was perfect. I had a huge boneless leg, so I wanted a lot of seasoning. The sauce is incredible; I cut it a bit with chicken stock and it was rich and wonderful. Great all around.

I did this over charcoal wnit was wonderful. Direct hear 450* until nicely seared. Then indirect heat at 350* until center reached 135*. Used only 1/2 the mustard recommended. Very,very good

Good advice to cook for 20 at 400, and then reduce to 350 for 20 minutes per pound.Used the Dijon mustard as suggested and it was outstanding.

Wow, loved this recipe. I halved the amount of meat and used 6 cloves of garlic and double the rosemary. Would definitely make this again. Recommend doubling the red wine to make more sauce.

This is a traditional recipe. Odd that it is labeled Medeterenean,( I can't even spell it right)since my mother cooked leg of lamb this way, and her mother was 1/2 Scottish who taught her. But none the less it is a simple great recipe. Some times I make slits in the lamb and stick pieces of garlic inside them. I tried it with dijon, and it doesn't really make a difference. I use a little more salt too.

Used CostCo. 3.5-4# leg, 1 T. Dijon mustard, fresh thyme (3 sprigs), 1 T. olive oil, 6 garlic cloves, 3/4 T. kosher salt (suggest using even less!), and rest of recipe as written. Meat was delicious (sauce was salty). Great leftovers (steam to reheat for yummy lamb-wiches)!

Absolutely Fantastic, though I did things a bit differently. Made Christmas day and was a huge hit! So scrumptious. Let me tell you what I did: Bought Costco's boneless leg of lamb. Night before: Removed string and rinsed with cold water, then patted dry. I doubled paste/rub recipe (except 1- 1/2 T only of the salt). Rubbed paste all over inside AND out. Just snugly rolled lamb up and did not bother re-tying it up. Placed lamb in lightly oiled roasting pan and let sit overnight. Pulled out in morn. and let sit out at room temp for 30 minutes while oven pre-heated. I then roasted in oven for 1 hr. 45 minutes-ish. Because I was taking this dish to my sister's house for Christmas and we weren't going to eat for an hour or so after getting there, I did all cooking at home and then transported ( 45 minute drive) it in my large crockpot that I turned onto low once we got there for approx 1 hour or so before serving. Carved into slices and then Poured the reheated, piping hot, deglazed au-jus over top just before serving. Oh my Word!! It was fabulous!

I made the leg of lamb yesterday and followed the tips about oven temp, oil on lamb before marinate paste, and 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard. Then marinated it for five hours...it was absolutely brillant! The meat was succulent and delicious... I also degreased the juices from the lamb by putting the juice in a saucepan and adding two ice cubes (after it cooled a little) and the fat coagulated which I removed before adding the red wine. very very delicious!

Excellent recipe and very easy. I used a 4.5 lb boneless leg of lamb from Costco (imported from Australia), removed most of the fat, rubbed olive oil over entire roast before covering with the paste. Per other reviewers, I added Dijon mustard to the paste. Marinated for 1/2 hour. I made extra paste, added a little wine and beef broth, then poured sauce over meat and sliced yukon gold potatoes before roasting in convection oven for 25 minutes for medium-rare. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

Easy and simple recipe for a family gathering. Found fresh lamb from a local ethnic market that was amazingly good and much better than the lamb from Costco which I usually used. The butcher made a boneless leg of lamb roast for me from a full leg and then gave me all the bones too for a great soup/stew later.

Great recipe! I come from a sheep farm in NZ and I can assure you that the lamb is not "mass-produced"! They run free and eat grass all year round. They are practically wild as they don't see humans that often. All in all, they have a very good life until they are turned into roasts! :)

AMAAAAZING sauce. I made 3 times the sauce and used it as a marinade for leg of lamb. Marinate for about 30 minutes and then broil it in the oven with a lot of onions and sliced potatoes and all the sauce for 15 min. at 450, then bring down to 350 and cook as appropriate to taste and size of lamb. DELICIOUS! =D

This is a very good recipe. Have made it several times and will be making it today. I disagree with those that claim NZ lamb is not very good. I have used both a local domestic lamb and the NZ lamb. I have not found much of a difference in flavor. Just because something is fresh and local does not make it superior. Experiment with your sources and make your own determination. Above all, enjoy the food.

Great simple, flavorful recipe. - And New Zealand lamb is wonderful. It's not 'mass produced' as someone mentioned, like spam or something. Lamb is just New Zealand's largest export. Like any meat you buy, evaluate the cut before you buy it. And hey, if you get the chance, have lamb while you're in NZ. Can't beat it.

Great, used the dijon mustard with the garlic and rosemary plus the vinegar. Used locally grown leg bone in. Let it marinate in the fridge for as long as you can (I did it for 4 hours both times) Great. 4 forks if you use all the reviews (not mine).

I am marinating a leg of lamb as I type this and came on here to print out the cooking specifics. I'm so disappointed to read about the difference b/t NZ and U.S. lamb! (Of course, because mine is of the NZ variety.) I'm apprehensive now as to what dinner will be like tonight, and I got my husband's hopes up so I'm crossing my fingers. I will keep this info in mind for future reference, but I do not want to throw away a 5 lb. lamb leg over it...is it that big of a difference?

Rating: 4
So, I'm a very career oriented new wife trying to learn to cook a bit more........as others, I rubbed entire leg (leg roast from costco) with olive oil before adding paste. I also added some stone ground Dijon mustard to the herb paste. As suggested by other posts, I cooked at higher temp for 15 mins, then backed down My first attempt at this sort of meal was an amazing success. My husband and sister loved it. The leftovers were plenty and were cut into chunks, reheated and added to spinach salads for rest of week!

I had never made leg of lamb before. My leg was a bit over 5 pounds. However, I used the proportions of ingredients for the larger leg. I rubbed it with olive oil first, then added about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the "paste," rubbed the "paste" over the lamb and let it sit several hours in the fridge before baking. Also poured a bit of apple cider vinegard over all to seal in juices. It was AWESOME! It did require more than an hour to cook to get it to the right temperature. Bumped up oven to 375 and baked for another 20 or so minutes. Thanks for a great recipe that made a great easter dinner!

Totally delicious. First time I cooked lamb and it was a total hit! Thanks. Some answers to silly questions I had to ask a friend since I'm not a chef: Fat side up, leave string on until done cooking. If you want to add potatoes, slice them, place around the lamb - not under it, and cover with some of the lamb fat and broth.

For those of you who are looking for a recipe to cook your first leg of lamb -- this is it! Cooked a 5 lb. leg with the same amount of rub in this recipe. Thank you Montreal Cook review 1/2/06, followed your suggestion and rubbed the lamb with olive oil prior to the rub. I wrapped the lamb in plastic wrap and let it take in the flavors in the frig a couple of hours prior to roasting. (Don't forget to let the lamb sit in room temperature for a 1/2 hour prior to roasting.) Montreal, also followed your suggestion of 425 degrees for the 1st 15 minutes and 375 degrees up to 160. This made the outside very crisp and the inside juicy. Served it at a dinner party, presentation is great and the guests really enjoyed it.

I made this with a small leg of lamb (4lbs) but used same amount of garlic & rosemary, which it needed. Before rubbing on the paste, I rubbed the lamb generously with olive oil and 1/2 lemon. The roast should be kick started at 425 degrees for 1st 15 minutes, then reduced to 375. I cooked it to 145 degrees, let it rest 15 minutes to 160 degrees. It was as we like it in my family, pink, and very juicy.

I am making this recipe for the second time in two weeks. I agree about the New Zealand Lamb- is cheap but does not compare to locally bred and butchered lamb. Let's face it- mass produced anything is suspect! This recipe is simple and delicious. I found I needed a little more rub to cover the entire leg. I used 1.5 times the amount called for. It did come out rather pink- I ended up cooking it an extra 10 minutes or so.

The difference between New Zealand lamb and domestic is that New Zealand is open range, grass fed... domestic is feed lot and grain fed, just like domestic cow. It's too bad our taste buds have been trained towards mass, unhealthy production

Excellent flavor. American lamb is a must, though, for a four fork result. Have tried with New Zealand with disappointing results (agree with previous poster that New Zealand lamb is gamey - which is all that Costco carries ). Take the time and locate a source for American lamb - the difference is like night and day.

My family thought this was wonderful!! I took the advice of using less salt and should have used olive oil to make the paste cover better, however the flavor was wonderful anyway. I pierced the meat quite a bit and let it sit about 2 hours. Loved the wine au jus!

Turned out good, Disagree with Denver reader on 2 counts, First marinade was very acceptable, second, New Zealand lamb is far from the best,New Zealand lamb is actually " known" for its gamey taste , so stay away.I recommend going to a Greek town butcher, and purchase you lamb there, you will not be disapointed

Listen to the sage advice of past reviewers -REDUCE the salt. Since I incorporated many of their excellent tips - coated lamb w/ dijon mustard to make paste adhere better; added olive oil; used entire head of garlic- I thought I didn't need to lessen the salt. I'll try again when I get my tastebuds back.

This is my favorite new way to make leg of lamb. Turned out very juicy and tasy for Easter dinner.

Rating: 2
This marinade/rub was good, but not great. I wouldn't use it again. A really good leg of lamb doesn't need much to make it taste good, and this marinade/rub wasn't good enough to outshine a simple preparation with olive oil, salt, and pepper. On the flip side, since the flavors weren't very strong, this marinade/rub would not have made a so-so leg of lamb taste better. Thankfully we had a great leg of lamb, so the meal was good regardless. If your cut of lamb isn't that tasty, find a more flavorful preparation to use, and if you've got a great piece of meat, just stick to olive oil, salt, and pepper. (For any Denver cooks out there, Whole Foods' New Zealand lamb is the best lamb we've had outside of New Zealand.)

Simple, excellent recipe - perfect for Easter. I had a bigger leg of lamb (almost 11lbs) and a group that preferred more well done. Cooked for 3 hours, still had a slight hint of pink and very juicy still. Served with Yellow Pepper Risotto (searched here) and asparagus. Wine au jus was great too. Would definintely repeat.

Oh! I forgot to mention the salt. After reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned about over-salting, so I used half the amount of kosher salt (which is the same saltiness as regular salt) and it was perfect. (Didn't have sea salt.)

Rating: 4
Yum! Turned out very good, but you should be aware that the lamb is VERY pink-as in almost red-when taken out at 130 degrees. It did not finish cooking enough for us while resting the 20 min., so after slicing I put the serving platter in the hot oven for a few minutes. This finished it up enough so that we had a dark pink medium rare, medium and 2 well done end pieces. Perfect for my crowd! I did not make the sauce as time was short and I had next to no juices from the lamb.

This is a fantastic version of a classic recipe. I usually put whole garlic cloves into the lamb with rosemary. However mashing the garlic and the salt & herbs made a wonderful intense flavour. I used a lot of dried rosemary and a little fresh thyme (due to availability) and also a little olive oil to help make the paste. It turned out wonderful and the gravy though small in amount was big in flavour.

After many unsuccessful attempts to roast the perfect leg of lamb, acceptable for company, this recipe was a true success!!! Used a 3.5 lb boneless leg, and followed temp instructions as others suggested...took it out at 130 degrees, and let it raise to 140. It was perfectly cooked, on the medium rare side. Also, crushed the garlic, and added dijon mustard and about 1 tsp of olive oil to the marinade/paste. It was excellent! This will be a standard for beef and pork roasts upcoming!

Wonderful! I used more garlic, more sea salt and more rosemary. Let the lamb marinate in fridge over night.

My first attempt to make leg of lamb was a huge success and all of my guests raved!

To the cook with the deglazing problems: whwnever you deglaze you should always pur off any excess fat first - its the tasty brown bits you're going for, not the fat (so the butter you added just made MORE fat!). That would have solved your problem. Then once the sauce was smooth, you can round it out at the very end with a little butter (also called "mounting"). Another note: whenever you want to add a thickener like cornstarch, you should make a smooth paste first by mixing a small ampount with COLD water. Then add to the pan.

This is the most fabulous recipe for lamb! I too spread the meat with dijon mustard before adding rosemary, etc. Used a boneless leg...and rather than preparing in the oven, I barbecued it over mesquite. The flavor was incredible, and friends who informed me they don't eat lamb...oops...had seconds and were licking their plates. Thanks for another winner!

A simple and satisfying dish. I made a variation for my Mediterranean-born boyfriend, using two lamb shanks instead of a leg and adjusting the seasonings accordingly. Also, I reduced the oven temperature to 275 degrees and increased the roasting time to 2-1/2 hours for more tender meat. The results were superb, and the recipe is so simple, my sweetie--who doesn't cook much--is going to try his hand at it. My only disppointment was the sauce. When I tried deglazing the pan as the recipe instructed, the fat and the wine remained stubbornly separated. I tried adding 2 Tbs butter...didn't help. Then added 2 Tbs flour, which produced what looked like chocolate cake batter with grease floating on top. Ick! What went wrong?

This was one of those simple recipes that surprised WAY MUCH to the upside! I doubled the garlic-rosemary-seasalt crust to cover the entire leg, and it was not only not too salty but just right. The pan drippings made an incomparable gravy. My wife and I agree that this is THE lamb recipe for us.

The best leg of lamb I ever made! The 130 degree temp is truly for "Rare". I cooked it between 135 and 140 because I prefer Medium doneness. It was still pretty rare towards the bone, but it was outstanding. I roasted some sweet onions coated with olive oil and a little salt and pepper along with the roast. I also used a little dijon mustard for the paste as some suggested. For the gravy I used some beef broth and wine and reduced it with the pan drippings then finished it with some butter off the heat.

I made this with a 3 lb boneless leg of lamb roast. I added a little dijon as well as some olive oil to the coating to help it stick.I used at least twice as much fresh rosemary, using some to cover the red new potatoes I roasted with the lamb. I pre-heated the oven to 400 degrees F, then turned it down to 300 degrees when I put the lamb in. It cooked in about 90 minutes to 140 degrees, then I took it out and kept the potatoes in for another 20 - 25 minutes to crisp. The lamb was very moist and tender, and totally delicious. Steamed asparagus and a nice merlot that I used to make the gravy was awesome. Will definitely make this dish again!

I had never made lamb in my life and this dish was not only simple to prepare but simply fabulous to eat. I followed the advice given by other reviewers and put a very thin layer of dijon on the meat to help the rosemary garlic preparation adhere. I also roasted potatoes and shallots with the lamb and sprinkled rosemary over them too. Everything was infused with a lovely rosemary flavour. How to you spell scrumpdilyicious?

Simply amazing. Very flavorful. Served it for Easter dinner, and everyone had 3 servings - threw potatoes around it to roast with the extra rosemary and salt, left them in when the roast was settling - nice and crispy (basted potatoes with the pan juices periodically).Take it out when the therm. reads 130 - it is perfect. It was very easy and quite impressive. The best lamb recipe I've ever had.

This receipe was extremely easy to make, especially for a lamb dish. I & my guests loved the rosemary-garlic crust, but I added 2 tbsp of Dijon mustard before coating the lamb leg. Luckily I had some fresh rosemary growing outside, so its flavor fresh. Because it tasted so good, I think that next time I will butterfly the leg, rub the rosemary paste on both inside and outside surfaces and then roll up before cooking. Also, I tested with a thermometer after 2 hours and it read 130' C, but the juices were still very red, so I left it in the oven for another 1/2 hour. I should have trusted the recipe and not continued cooking, as it will continue to cook after it was removed from the oven.

I made this recipe for easter dinner, for 11 people (also served roast beef). You can't ask for more: It was simple to follow, and the end result was a hit (everyone finished the lamb, but there was left over roast beef). I'm fairly new at roasts and cooking for larger groups, and it took a bit longer than the specified time (I took it out when the thermometer hit 130F). I was worried it would be dry, as there were little droppings in the beginning, but by the end all was perfect.

Yum Yum!I did make some adjustments though - I added shallots and a bit more rosemary and spread a very thin layer of dijon on the lamb so that the crust would stick. I also added more wine and rosemary to the gravy to make additional for potatoes.... Did I say yum???

We doubled the recipe for a Ridvan celebration and everyone went crazy! We cooked the lamb in a bag and used the drippings instead of the beef broth or wine. The sauce was wonderful on the side with saffron rice. Fabulous recipe for ANY special event!!
