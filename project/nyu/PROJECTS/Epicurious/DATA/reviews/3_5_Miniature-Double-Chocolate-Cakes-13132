made this with my daughter for her to take to school for Halloween cook off. We had seen comments of not so chocolaty, se we went with 5 ox of semi sweet and were overly generous with the mini morsels and then we undercooked them to keep them moist. great recipe. My daughter used white food coloring to create little ghosts with red eyes and mouth, very cute. Big hit at school. I would make this again in a flash.

Very delicious and straightforward and I shall definitely make them again. I did, however, find them very rich indeed. Both times I made them they were more like mini brownies. As they are so rich, I plan to carry on making them, just in small portions, eg mini (or even micro) cupcake cups.

I've made these many times, and although they aren't the most spectacular chocolate dessert you'll ever taste, they do serve a great purpose. This is a great recipe to have on hand when you need a quick and easy chocolate fix. Great to take along on picnics, potlucks, etc. Fast, easy and good-tasting. Everybody likes them.

These were fantastic for a quick treat. I made in in a regular cupcake/ muffin pan and got 11 out of the recipe. I added more chocolate to the batter, but did not put the mini choc chips on the top. They have a consistency/taste between that of a brownie and that of a regular choc. cake. Very good quick treat - served with ice cream for dessert.

So very yummy and easy! The difference, however, between yummy and "holy moly" is about 2 minutes in the oven. Mine were a bit burnt...but who turns down chocolate, right?

These are easy to make, and they're REALLY GOOD. I like the fact that they're not overwhelmingly sweet or chocolatey. People love them.

Made this for many pot-luck dinner parties. Ususally served it with a rum sauce and fresh berries. I think I'm going to leave off the mini-chips next time.

Perfect chocolate delight in a hurry, my family loved it. Will definitely make again, and again.

This was easy and delicious. I made it to bring to a friend who just had a baby. It is just enough of something sweet, but not too heavy or sugary. I will definitely make again.

I was craving chocolate cake, but didn't want to spend 2 hours making it. This recipe is very easy, and you can make it all with one pot and three utensils! I ate two right off the cooling rack, and had to leave the kitchen so there are enough for dinner. It's not very fudgy or chocolate-y, but I like that it's not too sweet and perfectly sized. Will definitely make again.

I used 4 oz. of Sharffen Berger and the Sharffen Berger nibs instead of the mini chocolate chips. They turned out fab and were devoured, definitely not too sweet.

These were so easy, I will definitely make them again, especially for parties. I used 4 oz Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate and the chocolate flavor was a still a bit light (I'm guessing that's because of the 3 eggs), but I thought that was OK (though I might try Sharffen Berger next time).

This is the second time I've made this tiny cakes. This time I increased the chocolate to 4 oz. to up the chocolate flavor. They all disappeared within minutes of me setting them out for guests.

Everyone loved these and they were so easy to make.I used the best quality chocolate I could find (Scharfenberger).

Everyone at work raved about these! I doubled the recipe and got 24 regular sized "cupcakes." Then my husband and our neighbor ate ten of them. Not too chocolatey, but very good.

These were very easy to make, but not very chocolatey. They look great and taste ok, but I wouldn't make them again.. I was looking for something with more intense chocolate flavor.

This was so easy and the results were delicious. I used a 3.5 oz bar of Lindt chocolate in the batter and 3 oz. of Baker's semi-sweet, cut up, for the topping and the cakes were very chocolatey. Also, I used a regular-sized muffin tin, baking them for 20 minutes, and the yield was 10 "cupcakes".

I have made these many many times and have always had rave reviews. People always ask for the recipe, which I hate to give! I was surprised they were so good because they are so easy and inexpensive.

^This is extremely easy and divine when looking for a chocolate recipe, everyone loves it. I used semi sweet chocolate instead of bitter-sweet and cut the sugar by half.

My friends loved this recipe. I melted some of the mini chips with an ounce of the bittersweet and a little of the butter, drizzled it on top of the powdered sugar and served with whipped cream. Yum!

Very good stuff, especially for chocolate lovers. I did not find bittersweet chocolate so I used semi-sweet and the cakes came out great. Highly recommend them!

These were great! Excellent texture, not too sweet, not excessively choclate-y, and just the right size for snacking. My 12 year old niece says: "DELICIOUS, I highly recommend them"--and she could make them by herself!

If I could give half forks, I would give this a 2.5.... I thought they were good, but not something to get excited about. I was hoping for more chocolate flavor and a darker color in the cake. But still a very good (and easy!) recipe.

Excellent! I brought them into the office and everybody has raved about them and requested the recipe. Super easy and just scrumptious!

Instead of muffin tins, I filled 4 individual souffle dishes and served over a raspberry sauce (push raspberries through sieve, discard solids, mix juice with sugar and rum) with fresh raspberries on top. Was both an elegant and delicious combination for serving company.

This recipe is part of my every day repetoire. It is simple and delicious. Not too sweet, so it is perfect for a casual adult meal. It's a great recipe to have on hand.

These little cakes are great! They're moist and fudgy. Fill a generous 3/4 full and be sure to grease the rim of the muffin cup too. They disappear fast!
