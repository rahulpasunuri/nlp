Really not difficult to make. Wondeerful flavor and presentation. I used skim millk and it was still outstanding. I served it with split and grilled fresh figs. Outstanding!

I've made this twice and it was a hit on both occasions. It may seem labor-intensive but really isn't too bad. Fresh berries are a must--I had to do frozen the last time and I felt it wasn't nearly as good.
