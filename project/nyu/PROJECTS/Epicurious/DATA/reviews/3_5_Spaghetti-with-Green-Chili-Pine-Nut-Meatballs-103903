There were a couple of things I really liked about this recipe: no onions in the tomato sauce, and no frying of meatballs! After cooking the sauce, I pureed it with a stick blender. I eliminated the green bell pepper from the meatballs and added 2 four-ounce cans of chopped green chili (rinsed). I also used pecans instead of pine nuts, and I ground them after toasting. Somebody said to keep the elements of the meatballs small so they would stay together better. Yes!

Loved it. Sub'd jalapenos for the green peppers and also made the meatballs with ground turkey for a lower fat version. I actually liked the lighter texture of the turkey. They held together fine. The sauce was especially tasty. A real winner.

Every time I make this recipe everybody loves it. I adjust it slightly by putting in fresh diced jalapenos and eliminating the bell peppers - never been a fan of cooked bell peppers' bitterness - and it feeds about 4 -6 hungry peeps. They are generally amazed at how rich and delicious the sauce in particular is. Also I must recommend dicing all ingredients as small as possible, so that the balls actually stay together when cooking.

I have to agree that originally, this recipe wasn't great. Didn't pack a huge punch, nor did it make a whole lot of meatballs. I didn't make the sauce, but I did make the meatballs. I doubled the recipe and replaced the chilis with real chopped jalepenos, increasing the proportion of those to the green peppers. HUGE success. The fennel seed really makes them reminiscent of sausages. With or without sauce-- you can even adjust to be low-carb if you need-- these are flavorful and stand out meatballs. IF you use the right chili peppers!

This recipe may be good for someone who cannot cook...but let me tell you...BLAND, BLAND, BLAND...Anytime store bought spaghetti sauce is better than homemade...throw the recipe away and save some money and time. The meatballs are pretty sad too...never again!!!

Not only was this the best meatball recipe ever back when it was published, but my husband loves it, and we even made it for a company dinner at our house. And the guests raved and even had seconds!

This is our favorite spaghetti recipe. The meatballs sometimes fall apart, but that makes the sauce that much better.

I was a little disappointed with how this dish turned out. After reading the reviews I was expecting more flavorful meatballs. I followed the recipe faithfully (although i added some chopped basil to the meatball mix) and didnt find this any better than my usual spaghetti and meatball recipe. The pine nuts were nice but no one noticed the green chilis. Perhaps they weren't spicy enough.

Great twist to otherwise plain recipe. The chili and pinenuts really added great flavor to this dish! My guests all loved it.

Whoa, those are fantastic meatballs!!!! Very flavorful. I fried them in a frying pan to brown them nicely then baked them low in the oven for about 1/2 hr. The tomato sauce is very plain but next time I would throw some fresh basil in to spruce it up.

This is a little different and really good. I think it elevates sphaghetti and meatballs from everyday fare to a special occasion (entertaining) dish. The first time I made it I made the meatballs, the second time I used the meat mixture as a filling for ravioli. Very yummy. I used twice the amount of pine nuts ( why not?). The meat still held together and it added that much more pine nut flavour. This one is going into my recipe box.
