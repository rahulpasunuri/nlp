These are delicious! I didn't have apple jelly so I added a diced apple and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. I didn't use currants. I also substituted Splenda for two of the tablespoons of sugar and added 1 tablespoon of dark brown sugar. They are quite sweet. I will probably reduce the sugar to 2 Tbs the next time (using 1 Tbs. Splenda and 1 Tbs. brown sugar). I also substituted about 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour for part of the flour. They turned out great!

I loved the cornmeal addition (although I could take or leave the currants). The kids prefer our standard (Alice Berner's mom's pancakes, from Susan Hermann Loomis' Farmhouse cookbook), and I'll continue to do those more often, but these are a nice change. I used coarse stone ground cornmeal, because I love the crunch in breakfast dishes, but a fine meal would make this more like a traditional pancake.

I keep all of my issues of gourmet and looking back at this one I stumbled upon this great recipe that sounded so light and I decided to make it one morning..All I can say is that I love it and is so light and fluffy, if you follow any recipe carefully everything will come out just like the picture. I also have subtituted with dried cranberries which I find very delicious and for the apple jelly I've used in the syrup I have used peach jelly and added a bit more juice.

I first made this recipe when it came out in the Gourmet Magazine - and it's become a staple in my house. I've never made the apple-cinnamon syrup - we just use regular maple syrup - and it's the yummiest. Quick, easy, and everybody loves it.

Really tasty; interesting flavors. The apple cinnamon syrup was great and just a small amount was plenty. If you have leftovers, i would recommend bringing them back to room temperature before cooking.

My husband, who hates pancakes, requested I make this based on the photo in the magazine. He loved them, and so did I. They are fluffy, with a very pleasant corn muffin texture. The syrup isn't really worth the effort if you don't have the ingredients around the house. I think maple syrup or honey are just as tasty.
