Made this last night. Delicious. Will add to the "regular" rotation. Followed exactly although I used spicy thai chili powder, that I had on hand, which made it very hot! I had never really made a tofu based recipe before. Wow. Spouse and myself both had seconds.

I made this as listed except I had to substitute black peppercorns for the Sichuan variety because the two local Asian Markets did not carry them. My family found it to be very spicy, I will probably cut back on the chile powder next time, but everyone loved it. A definite keeper.

Excellent! Guests at an important business luncheon scraped their plates (served with chinese chicken salad, also on this site as well as cold sichuan sesame noodles). The only thing I altered was to use low sodium soy sauce. This is a great, simple, over-the-top for flavor recipe.

Made the recipe without any oil and minus the pork. It was healthy and great. Will make again.

This dish is amazing and so easy. The secret is the sichuan pepper. It won't be the same without it.
