the roasted oysters are tasty & tender plus so much easier than shucking them

What's not to like? This technique of roasting oysters and sausages on the grill is an annual tradition of ours and will not disappoint. Roasting oysters brings out their delicious briny flavor. Squeeze a lemon and eat up!

I haven't made this recipe yet; but there's nothing that seems "Yuck" about it other than the reviewer below must not like seafood, sausages or dark beer.
