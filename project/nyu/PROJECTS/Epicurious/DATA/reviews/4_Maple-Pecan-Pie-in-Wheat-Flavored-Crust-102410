This is one of the best nut pies I've ever had, everything is very balanced in flavor. I made another version of a wheat pie crust and I really recommend a wheat crust with this recipe. I didn't think it was too sweet as other reviewers did. I didn't know how they could think so maybe it was the type of syrup they used? The only thing I changed was I added a bit more nuts which I toasted. Please toast the nuts. The maple syrup was a tad smoky which was a perfect compliment. I used a Grade A Amber Pure Maple. Everyone loved it. I made four pies for Thanksgiving and this was a big hit and the first one gone.

I made this to mixed reviews this thanksgiving. Most really liked the whole wheat crust, the slight maple flavor and that it was less sweet than the typical pecan pie, but my dad missed the typical sweeter pecan pie. I used two cups of pecans in the pie and of course decorated the top of the pie with pecan halves. No one thought this pie was too sweet.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and I could have eaten the entire pie by myself. this was hands down the best pecan pie I have ever eaten.

Yum! Yum!I found that it took about 12 minutes longer to cook but they may be partially because I used 2 1/2 cups pecans. Also, I used a pre-maid gluten free crust from Whole Foods and was very pleased with the crust.

This was delicious! It was definitely very sweet. I made it as-is. Paired with some vanilla bean ice cream it was a crowd favorite at Christmas. It even impressed my best friend's mom who, as a Texan, "knows a thing or two about pecan pie."

I made this for my boyfriend last year. We are now engaged. Not a coincidence. ;-) (I did not make the wheat crust and simply used a store-bought crust.)

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! A huge hit. However, I used 4 cups of pecans instead of 1.5- I would not have liked it nearly as much with only a cup and a half of pecans.

This pecan pie is amazing. it tastes like melty butterscotch candies. I added 3 tablespoons of bourbon, as suggested by other reviewers. It really balanced the sweetness of the maple, sugar and corn syrup.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic! I'm baking it again this week for Thanksgiving.

Every time I make this everyone wants the recipe. People can't figure out what or why it's different but they rave. Mostly people say it's not as sweet as regular pecan pie. I just made a 'regular' crust but would like to try the whole wheat one at some point.

Excellent recipe - worked 1st time (with addition of 1 extra yolk and more pecans in the filling)! Using same ingredients made 2 variations today: baked individual pies in cupcake tray (baking time 35min) AND baked individual pots of this gooey yumminess in ban marie (35mins) (minus the crust)

This was a very great pie. I made for a birthday party and everyone loved it. My one complaint was that it was a bit too sweet which often becomes the case when blending every different kind of sugary substance into one buttery pecan substance. I would recommend adding about a spoonful of brandy net time to cut some of the sweetness.

Rating: 4
Great and super easy. I did a store-bought crust because I have an unhealthy relationship with pastry that involves too much cursing. Doubled the recipe and made two pies, but ran out of maple syrup - instead of getting 1.5c that was necessary, I ended up with 1 1/4c maple syrup, and decided to add 1/4c bourbon as a steal from another recipe - awesomeness. Even better after it has rested for a day (which happens when you make two).

The search for the perfect pecan pie is over! Great pie! Wonderful crust! I made the following changes: 1. used Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup. 2. Added 3 tablespoons rum. 3. chopped the nuts. The crust is easy and flaky; does not get soggy at all. the whole wheat flavor goes very well with the sweet pie.

Rating: 4
Superb! Very easy and even more delicious. Everyone loved it. I used half a cup of whole wheat flour in the crust (because I am a big whole wheat fan) and it turned out amazing. I also added a few extra pecans on the top to make a pretty pattern. I plan on making this every year for Thanksgiving!

I agree, this is the best Pecan Pie that I have ever had. I followed the recipe. I am not an accomplished pie maker. In fact it may have been a few decades since I've made one. But this was easy. Everyone loved it.

Really yummy! I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and substituted brown rice syrup (Found at Henry's) for corn syrup. I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of cutting it with all purpose. The pie came out delicious! The whole wheat crust balanced out the sweetness of the filling. One of the best pecan pies I have ever had.

This is a great recipe, however, I substitute brown rice syrup for corn syrup. For those of you who think it is too sweet, try to find brown rice syrup. Since I live in a food desert, I can't find a source this year, so I don't actually know what I will do to make my favorite dessert!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. I didn't make any changes from the recipe, except I did add a teaspoon of maple extract to the filling, and I used chopped pecans instead of whole pecans. I was requested to make this pie again for Christmas. This recipe is a keeper! This will be my only pecan pie recipe from now on. The filling was sweet, just right, not overly gooey-sweet like some other recipes. I also really liked the wheat crust - it came out really well and complemented the pie very nicely.

I have made other pecan pies, and this was the best. I used only a scant measure for the corn syrup -- so simply omitted some of what was called for -- and it turned out great. I used the whole wheat crust recipe, which I had never tried before, and quite liked it. It was very easy to work with and rolled out so easily! We all enjoyed this pie for our Christmas dinner.

I used the old fashioned buttermilk pie crust recipe from this site. The pie itself was amazingly good! I never liked pecan pie, including the last one I made. This however made me a convert. I did use at least 2 cups pecans. The rest of the flavoring I followed. The maple syrup makes this so good. I cannot common on the wheat crust, but I know that if you use the buttermilk one, you need to prebake. I did not, so the bottom of my crust raised up while baking so a pie cross section revealed that pie filling was underneath the pie crust. This did not affect the taste. I am about to make this again for Christmas. Yum!

My first time making a pie crust from scratch and it went very well! I much prefer using butter to shortening and the crust was delicious and flaky. I also enjoyed the slight maple flavor as an update to classic pecan.

Rating: 4
WELL....My family LOVED the recipe. I took a couple variations, though. Instead of an entire pie, I use this recipe to make mini pecan bites. It was like a bite-size pie. The crust recipe got a double helping of butter to make it flakier. The whole wheat flavor was a really nice touch to balance out the sweetness of a pecan pie. Next time, I'm thinking I will double the recipe of the filling and the crust so that I can attempt to make a crockenbouche-esque stack with spun sugar....mmmmm. Happy cooking, everyone!

I thought it was too sweet but my family didn't. We did not like the crust but it was a beautiful looking pie. Next time I'd use a mixture of whole and chopped pecans as I found they did not have the crunch that I like; I've found the the combination of size helps with the toasting while they cook. Also I'd cook it longer than I did as the inside was a bit runny (I baked it longer than recipe called for but less than what was required, I guess).

Thanksgiving 2009: great success. added about 1/2-1 cup more pecans and used extra-;arge eggs. Everyone raved and it was almost finished.

This is definitely a keeper. My husband remarked on the aroma while the pie was still in the oven. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I may have cooked the filling a bit longer than instructed but that worked out great and this pie set up a lot better than others I have made, because of that. Also, I think freezing the crust helps to keep it from over browning without having to use foil. As others said the maple kept it from the cloying sweetness of other recipes.

Rating: 4
I used chopped pecans with this recipe and it was a big hit for Thanksgiving. (Which is great since the other pie I made was NOT HOT.) The whole wheat pie dough was also the best I've ever worked with. It was so pliable and easy to work with. It looked amazing and it was great that I didn't have to double it, like I have had to do with other crusts, just to get a single layer. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around.

This was terrific--best pecan pie I have had. I am a little embarrassed to say it, because this is the first I have actually made myself, but I proceeded on the basis of the reviews on this site and they didn't let me down. It was easier than I feared. Flavor is fuller than usual, probably because of the maple/brown sugar combo. I used a tablespoon of brandy, too, as some suggested. The wheat crust worked well for me--added some contrast to the rich filling.

This was very tasty, but I tried cutting into it too early and the filling never set, it kinda ruined the pie. The crust was awesome though.

Delicious. The wheat-flavored crust was a nice compliment to the sweet filling. A wonderful use of maple syrup!

Making a pecan pie is a bit disturbing, because you have to see the big mass of gooey sugars and fats that go into it. It does not look appealing. But once it's baked and that sweet maple and toasted pecan smell fills the house, the first impression is over-ridden. I'll definitely make it again next Thanksgiving. We all agreed it was the best we'd had, and it will become a holiday staple.

Excellent, I made two, we ate one at dinner and the other one 'disapeared' by morning. I liked the crust, it enhanced the filling,keeping it from tasting too sweet.

Everyone loved this pie. The maple really balanced the usual sweetness of pecan pie. I cheated and used a refrigerated pie crust; I'm sure homemade would be better. Next time I might add even more pecans.

This was the best pie recipe ever. I'm not a baker, and was suprised to find that everyone in the house loved it. It wasn't as sweet as all other recipes I've tried. I added a little more nuts (1/2 cup) than asked for - was well worth it!

Best pecan pie ever. The only change I made was to add 2 T of Maker's Mark Bourbon after blending the sugars and before cooling. Got rave reviews.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner - switched out a regular Pillsbury crust for the wheat one - because Pecan Pie is my boyfriend's favorite. He said this was the best he's ever tasted and everyone came back for 2nd's and 3rd's. It really was delicious. I've been told I need to make this once a week now :)

I made this for dessert on Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from my family. I used a regular homemade crisco crust and added 1 tbsp of bourbon to the filling. We ate it while it was still warm but next time I would refrigerate before serving to give the filling time to firm up a little more. I am already planning to bake it again!

I've always been a big fan of pecan pie and wanted to try to make one for Thanksgiving this year. This was a big hit across the board. It is very sweet, but I added some bourbon and that cut some of the sugar nicely. I used a store-bought crust and sprinkled brown sugar on top before sliding it into the oven for a nice crisp surface. It also took longer than the listed time, but I think altitude is the cause of that. Suffice to say, if you're cooking over 6500 feet, keep it in the oven between 60-80 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Great! I served this after Thanksgiving dinner to a few pecan pie lovers and they raved about it. Easy to make: this was my first pecan pie. I made no changes (except used an average roll-out crust) and it was fantastic!! I'll make it again for my next dinner party.

This is the most flavorful pecan pie that I have made or eaten. It is sweet but not so sweet that you can't eat it...like most pecan pies. I used a medium amber maple syrup like other reviewers suggested. I will definitely make again!

Used a different crust ("best ever", which was good but a bit bland), so I'll review the filling only. Added 1/4 cup bourbon, 1tsp lemon zest and a little heat- 1/2 tsp. cayenne. Better, but just too sweet for me. If you like a sweet pie, try this...it did come out of the oven looking just like the photo!

A follow-up to my previous review - this time I used regular brown sugar, amber maple syrup and honey. I was 1/4 cup short of maple syrup, so I turned to a good wildflower honey to make up the difference, and used 3 tbsp. of rum. Another great pie was the result. I brought it to work, and it was gone before 1:00 pm. A great recipe, though I still haven't tried the wheat crust. However, as I plan to make this pie many more times, I daresay I'll have the opportunity in future.

This is rich (like all pecan pies) but not too sweet. I did not have light brown sugar, so used regular dark brown sugar, with no problems. I also used amber maple syrup, which I think is key - light maple syrup's flavour isn't strong enough for baking. I also added 1 1/2 tbsp. of brandy to the filling (whisked it in with the eggs and vanilla) - I would have used bourbon if I had it on hand. I would urge others to try this addition as well. The alcohol burns off, and the flavour of the spirit just works to support the flavours of the pie, to delicious effect. My pie baked in precisely 55 minutes, and set perfectly. I used my own crust recipe, will probably try the wheat crust next time - and there will be a next time. Sweet, buttery, nutty goodness, and so easy to make!

This is the most incredible pecan pie recipe EVER. Even better the next day. I was afraid that the maple syrup was too untraditional, but no. I used Pillsbury Crust and added 1 Tbsp Maker's Mark bourbon to the filling. My Kentucky born sister in law went wild for this pie.

I really loved this pie! I made this for Thanksgiving and turned a once-pecan-pie-hater into a maple-pecan-pie-lover. I didn't bother with the wheat-flavored crust (I was making several other pies, so I stuck with my basic pie crust recipe). This will be a part of my holiday baking repertory from now on!

What a great pecan pie. I love the maple flavor, it really differentiates this pie, adds a richness and complexity you don't get from straight corn syrup.

This will be my new standard pecan pie recipe. I used real grade A maple syrup, and everyone loved this pie. I did cheat and used a store-bought crust. The result has a great, subtle flavor; it's not cloyingly sweet like pecan pies made with only corn syrup. Even my father said, "That's good pie." If you knew my dad - well, that's a HUGE compliment.

Did anyone have any trouble with this pie being runny? It was truly delicious, and I was able to split it among ramekins and make it a "crumble", but it didn't set at all, despite my taking it out of the oven when the sides were puffy and the center appeared set...I used half hazelnuts and half pecans...any chance this was the problem?

Rating: 4
I made this pie to take to a Thanksgiving dinner last fall, and everyone enjoyed it (particularly my Canadian hosts!). Since I had some maple sugar (from Québec) on hand, I substituted that for the golden brown sugar in order to heighten the maple flavor. For ease of cutting, I chose to use pecan pieces rather than pecan halves.

Rating: 3
I was surprised that the maple flavor wasn't that strong for this pie--that could have been the syrup I used though. I would make this again, but maybe use some maple extract to boost the maple. I didn't make the wheat flavored crust, just used a plain pastry crust. Overall this was well received :)

the wheat crust works really well with this recipe. i've never made crust using an egg yolk before, but i think it made the dough come together more easily. i might try it with a pumpkin pie next time. the maple syrup helps to control the usual sticky sweetness of pecan pie. definitely the best i've made
