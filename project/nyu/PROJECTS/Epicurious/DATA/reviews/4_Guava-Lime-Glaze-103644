I can't find Guava Nectar anywhere. Was this not available after 2000?! Are there any substitutes?

I used a orange, passion fruit, guava mix for this. Absolutely wonderful. Saving the leftovers to use on a pineapple chicken recipe.

Terrific marinade. I'll be sure to use it on other things that were suggested. I didn't want to toss the rest and I should have trusted my gut (and my stomach).

I combined the juice of one lime and one kiwi, mixed it and poured 1/3 in with the glaze. It was sublime.

This was well worth the effort! I liked this recipe so much, that I substitute pineapple juice for the guava juice and prepare as normal to use as a dipping sauce for coconut shrimp.

Excellant marinade. I marinade whole pork tenderloins in this and then grilled them. Heated leftover marinade and used as a suce on sliced tenderloin. Would work well with chicken as well.

This is one of my favorite shrimp recipes! Very easy and impresses company. I've made it several times.

Absolutely delicious! Guava nectar was buried too deep in my pantry so substituted "Splash" Tropical (the new diet variety, sweetened by Splenda, so I could safely heat it.) Also used raspberry vinegar (out of RWV); nice substitution! Whether for shrimp or roasted/ grilled fruits, will definitely make again!

Great summer time item. Basted on grilled fruits is wonderful. I also use it on a variety of other seafood besides shrimp. Any juices work well depending on taste. Apricot nectar is a good choice if guava is not available.
