Made exactly as directed (except mixed up my own mustard and mayo) and these sandwiches were FABULOUS. Unusual but classic comfort food. Be sure to use caraway rye; the extra flavor takes it into the stratosphere. A huge hit.

Yum. Bought broccolini at the greenmarket this morning. Was tired of just steaming it. So tried this. Made my own dijon mayo with some lemon juice, light mayo, and coarse dijon mustard. Loved the cheddar/broccolini and crunchy bread. This was a great quick dinner.

Awesome, the whole family loved it including picky toddlers and veggie-sniffing husband. I used regular broccoli because I couldn't find broccolini and mixed up my own dijonnaise. Delicious, fast and easy. Definitely one to add to the recipe box.

Wondeful! I sauted the broccolini with onion & garlic in some EVOO and made my own dijon-mayo as well as homemade rye bread. This was so good. Great flavor from so few ingredients. Would be wonderful for lunch company. These ingredients go very well with apple and pear so slices of both made a wonderful side. I've also made a salad of apple, rasins and carrot. Potato/apple/pancetta salad is wonderful here as well as a simple fruit salad. Classic fries or potato wedges are also nice sides. Adding the fruit, you can be sure you have all the food groups covered :-)

We make this regularly, usually with the addition of sauteed, sliced portabellos underneath the broccolini. Adds additional texture, substance, and flavor. It's equally good without though. Highly recommended for an easy, quick, and delicious meal. FYI, Trader Joe's usually has the broccolini.

My husband wanted a snack, and this was perfect! It took me 10 minutes start to clean-up, including mixing my own mustard-mayonaise. The red onion adds a nice tang. Broccolini is one of my new favorite veggies. It has a richer flavor than broccoli. Tastes great on this sandwich! For those new to broccolini, try simply sauteeing it with olive oil and half cloves of garlic. Yum!
