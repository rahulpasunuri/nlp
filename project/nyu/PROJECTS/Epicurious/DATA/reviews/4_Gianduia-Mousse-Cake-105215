This is an absolutely fabulous cake. I made it (for the first time) and won first place in (very competitive) culinary club's competition. In my version, I used all dark Belgian chocolate (no milk chocolate), and I cut out my own design to use as a stencil, decorating the top with powdered sugar. (As easy as folding paper and cutting out a snowflake!) This one is a keeper!

I made this the first time the year it came out, in Gourmet magazine. It quickly became on of my favorite desserts. Like other reviewers, I make it with the whole jar of Nutella. I also top it with very lightly sweetened whipped cream with a tiny splash of almond extract and raspberry chambord. The flavors help cut the denseness of the cake beautifully.

Very successful dessert - made it for passover (with um another 5 desserts...) and it was the most popular. I made it in a 9 inch pan and used some of the batter in mini silicon muffin pans - they came out softer and fluffier while the cake came out dense like a truffle. i used callebaut semi-sweet and lindt milk and nearly the whole jar of nutella as one of the reviewers suggested. couldn't find hazelnut butter at fairway in NY so made it myself. skinning the roasted hazelnuts was easy just taking a handful of warm nuts and rubbing them my hands. anyway it gets a quadruple YUM from my family and guests.

Holy cow, this may have been my favorite dessert ever. Made it pretty much as the recipe said, but substituted Rapunzel organic chocolate hazelnut spread for the Nutella (available at our local natural food store and at Whole Foods - MUCH more hazelnutty and nicer texture than Nutella). I also added 1/4 tsp salt. While it doesn't need more chocolate, glazing it makes it look a whole lot better - fancy bakery presentation rather than looking like a giant round brownie. I cut it into 16 pieces and even as a chocoholic I thought they were way too big - I won't be eating again for 3 days. Everyone at the party raved and raved about this dessert. Not too difficult either.

I was worried about the length of cooking time and how long I left it in the oven afterwards, but no need. The top was crispy like a brownie, and the inside was moist and decadent. It went over really well with a small group of ladies along with some raspberry coulis and whipped cream. It's not a cheap cake to make at all, but worth it if you're trying to impress and endear yourself to chocolate fans forever. Oh, and I used Callebaut chocolate and pre-made dry-roasted hazelnut butter.

I make this cake about once a year from the cut-out, laminated magazine recipe. Best thing about it is that slices can be individually wrapped and frozen. After about 20 sec in the microwave, they become just as warm and gooey as when it first comes out of the oven. Use regular butter in place of the hazelnut butter with litter difference.

I've made this as written, and also by substituting all dark chocolate for the milk, and subbing almond butter for the hazelnut butter - delicious either way.

I love this recipe and make it for special occasions. I have made it 4-5 days ahead and have also frozen it and it's always been good. My cousin's husband, who grew up in Northern Italy, loves this cake as well. I have made it and shipped it to him for bdays apparently tasting amazing still on the other end. One could not go wrong making this as it has turned out great every time!

Have been making this for years. Great for those who are gluten intolerant. You can whirl sugar in the food processor for a super fine version and I have substituted readily available peanut butter for a quicker and an equally delicious cake!

To save time, make the hazlenut butter in advance and (GENTLY) rewarm it in the microwave before adding to chocolate mixture.

Have made this cake many times. It's very simple and foolproof if you follow the recipe EXACTLY (think of it as a FORMULA). The cooled cake (still in the pan) freezes well in a foil wrap. To avoid condensation, be sure not to unwrap cake until it is fully defrosted. For that "died and went to heaven" experience try it with a double ganache coating, raspberry sauce, and a whipped cream "chaser." This is not a pricey cake--note the cost per serving.

This was amazing- but not very "mousse"-like, more truffle-like. A few things to make this easier: use all semi-sweet chocolate,also use regular sugar with no ill-effects, don't measure the nutella- just add the whole jar as it is nearly the whole jar and then you don't dirty another utensil! I made the hazelnut butter easily in the blender but with just slightly more oil than called for. Also, melted chocolate in my heavy bottomed Le Creuset pot instead of a double boiler. Hard to cut nicely (even when cold) but next time I will cut the softened cake with dental floss. Amazing! You will not regret this! It makes alot though- we froze half the cake so we didn't chocolate overdose!

Amazing cake, but sooo rich. I couldn't manage to eat more than a sliver, and I made the cake for just 3 of us! I guess we'll be eating a lot of cake this week. If you like Nutella, you will LOVE this!

This is an AMAZING cake! I've tried several flour-less chocolate cakes before, all of which were almost too rich, but the hazelnut butter complements the mixture of bittersweet and milk chocolate in such a way that you won't be able to stop eating this. Accompanied with fresh fruit (I recommend light fruits like mangos, plums, nectarines, etc.) and you can't get a better, more sophisticated dessert.

We used the Scharffen Bergen bittersweet chocolate and everything worked really well. This was excellent and will be made many more times.

Oops! Do not make the mistake I did and use a 9-in. pan. That would explain the incredibly messy--but wonderfully delicious--warm chocolate-hazelnut mudslide that I scraped off the springform base and into a bowl last night. A lesson in reading your recipe carefully, I suppose. Will try again sometime for a very special occasion. Does dirty a lot of dishes and add up price-wise.

It's time consuming to make (because of the hazelnut butter) and only for those who love hazelnut/choclate combination - for those who have the time and love the combo, it's divine. I have served it twice to crowds of 14+ and there was plenty to go around both times - it's that rich.

This is beyond decadent, but is soooo good and worth the calories. A huge hit with all my guests.

This is a wonderful cake. I made my own hazelnut butter and followed the directions exactly, changing nothing (for a change.) I think it is the best and everyone loved it.

I've made this torte several times. I recently made one for each of my aunts for Christmas, and froze them so that they can serve the torte next time they have a dinner party. Every time I make this cake it is a total hit. It's not difficult and if you can find whole hazelnuts at a good price (the bulk section of the grocery store) and the nutella at Cost Co, its not too expensive and is totally worth every penny (and calorie).

I have made this recipe many times now. It is very easy and requires little active time. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't love it. It is great for large parties. Serves lots because it is so rich. I think it is best at room temp but can be tricky to cut nicely at this temp. I have cut it chilled and placed the pieces on the dessert plates to come to room temp while dinner is served. Works great. Can't believe some people find cost an issue. Try buying a cake like this!

Made this cake for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from the in-laws! Not a single piece left over. Well worth the effort!

I loved this recipe -- extremely dense and moist, a choc-o-holics DREAM! I made it for people at work and they have not stopped talking about it. One note, when wrapping in aluminum foil be certain to use the "wide" variety heavy duty foil. I overlapped mine underneath the pan and it did leak a little bit around the seam. I thought it was ruined -- but I got lucky (this time). Once cool, I turned my cake out onto a plate and covered it with a bittersweet chocolate glaze (6T heavy cream, 6T corn syrup and 8 oz. chocolate) TO DIE FOR!

Although my friends really liked this cake, I wouldn't make it again. The cake was very easy to make and the flavor was very pleasant, but for the cost of the ingredients (I don't have a food processor so I purchased hazelnut butter) I was expecting something much more impressive. In the future I'll just add some hazelnut flavor to my basic flourless chocolate cake since the texture was the same and the flavor remarkably similar. Also, a crust formed on the top of the cake that I didn't care for -- it was dry and too sweet, and remininded me of the freeze-dried ice cream at a science museum.

Absolutely worth the effort. This is a fabulous recipe. Make sure you have the whipped cream on the side, though, to cut the richness a little (for the chocolate lightweights at your table).

My husband made this and served it the night he proposed to me. I don't know if it was the moonlight shining on the lake, or the incredible chocolate hazelnut confection, but I said yes. In all honesty, this was the most perfect dessert I have ever tasted! A little bit of heaven.

I just made this for an all girls' luncheon and everyone loved it! I thought I had messed up when I took the cake out of the oven after 1 hour and 10 minutes of baking and then sitting in the oven for another 40 minutes because the crust was very hard. Of course it was even harder after I refrigerated it overnight. But after letting it sit at room temperature for about an hour, it started to soften. Very rich and delicious!

This cake is wonderful. Each guest that I served this cake to, loved it. It is like eating a wonderful Baci chocolate as the blending of the chocolates and hazelnut butter is wonderful. It stands alone wonderfully without whipped cream as well.

This is a fabulous cake. I have made it several times when I want something to really make an impression. It needs the whipped cream. It's really rich. After the first time, it's not too difficult to make either.

This is a terrific recipe -- one that I make over and over for special gatherings. I want to share that once I folded two pieces of narrow heavy duty foil together (the wide was not available) and they leaked. I ended up with a big soggy mess, although it still tasted fine.

A very very rich chocolate cake. You have to eat it with whipped cream (not Cool whip) and some fruit.

Hint: Try using parchment paper fastened by a rubber band, thats definately will keep the water out of the pan. This was an excellent cake, came out nice and moist. I would recommend it to anyone

This was a delicious cake that made a big splash at a supper club gathering. The directions were perfect, the texture very moist and rich. I substituted regular butter for the hazelnut butter, and it was still wonderful, but the hazelnut flavor was overpowered by the chocolate.

I found this cake extremely easy (and I made it with two kids still in diapers!!!!) AND delicious. Rave reviews each time I've served it. It came to me recommended and I've recommended it to my sister -- and I'm making it AGAIN for my chocoholic husband's birthday. To solve the foil problem: I use regular foil. To make it waterproof, I ROLL two pieces together along the long sides. That covers the pan quite well. My sister did the same thing without a problem. To solve the hazelnut butter problem: It's simple to make if you follow the recipe!! There is a LINK to the HAZELNUT BUTTER recipe. Soooo easy. Just toss the nuts in the blender with oil. That's it! To my mind, this is the perfect recipe in that it's MUCHO flavor impact with LITTLE effort.

This is foolproof and very easy. I vary it by serving with toasted hazelnut mousse or the tangerine mousse from the double chocolate cake recipe.

Taste tests are in and it's a winner! Deeply gianduia-flavoured, slightly lighter than a gianduia cheesecake, and exceedingly rich. I cut it into 16 pieces; I dare anyone to eat 2 pieces at a sitting. I covered the cake with a thin layer of Nutella, and cut it into pieces with a hot knife (tried dental floss cutting the cold cake- too difficult- might have worked well on slightly warm or r.temp. cake), and placed a toasted, skinned hazelnut on each piece, then put a little curl of Nutella on the top of each nut using a knife with some Nutella on it. This cake should satisy fans of gianduia. It does take a fair bit of work, about an hour and a half to make plus cooking and decorating time; if willing, you will enjoy your just desserts!

This is very good, and guests liked it, but it is a lot of work. I couldn't find hazelnut butter anywhere and used almond butter instead. I frosted it with nutella, which worked better than I would have expected. Tip: they're serious about using heavy foil. I tried to double normal foil and it was a mess. I tested for water-tightness in the sink first, and suggest you do the same. All in all, there are other recipes that don't take every bowl in the kitchen, but turn out nearly as well. I may make this again for my hazelnut-crazy boyfriend, but otherwise, will stick to other tortes.

I made this cake numerous times when the recipe first appeared in the February 1998 issue of Gourmet magazine. I moved to Europe in April 2000 and was unable to bring my entire 10 year collection of Gourmet magazines with me. Not to worry, I thought: I can get the recipe off the web! Needlesstosay, I was crushed when I could not find it until just recently. Thanks Gourmet for making the recipe available to the world via the net. The cake is delicious and I encourage everyone to try it. Nutella is all the rage in Europe and this cake will be a big hit with all who love hazlenuts and chocolate.
