sesame oil is in preparation, but I don't see it in the ingredients?

this is not a real recipe for the famous Korean dish. there are lots of secret recipes but the basic one should include: garlic, ginger, scallions, onion, carrots. mushrooms are great. don't forget the ginger. grated asian pears work the best to tenderize and bring sweetness, but i've also tried kiwis and peaches which also work well. but don't use too much, the meat will become crumbly. use the sesame oil sparingly too. you only need a little.

Not only do you need the above (although you can skip the asian pear juice), but my mom (who is Korean) always uses a bit of gohjeejahng (spicy bean paste), BROWN sugar, and a bit more sesame oil. Tastes even better if you mix in julienned carrots and fresh bean sprouts, but that's personal taste.

you need more ingredients than just soy sauce and sugar to make proper bulgogi (=boolgogi) when marinating, add onions, scallions, little bits of asian pear (or asian pear juice)for the sweetness, carrots, and a little bit of sesame oil.
