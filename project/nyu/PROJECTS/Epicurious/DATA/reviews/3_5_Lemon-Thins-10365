Super easy. Hubby said "there's a problem with these cookies ... they're too small!" and he professes not to like lemon! I used 1-1/2 tsp lemon extract, otherwise as written. Watch them closely as another reviewer suggested - they go from puffed to browned in a heartbeat. Cooled beautifully crisp and delicate, seem sophisticated for such an easy recipe. I did not bother with chilling the dough or forming a log. I used a melon baller to drop teaspoonfuls onto the pan, then flattened slightly with heel of hand.

I really, really love these and will make them for guests in the future. I doubled the zest and used all butter - and they turned out like gourmet cookies. Just the right amount of sweet for the intense lemony tang.

I made these for my boyfriend yesterday. He's English, big on "Tea time" and I couldn't stop him storming in the kitchen shouting "Where are they?". Used all butter (less 1 tbsp), refigerated, rolled into 1 tsp balls and flattened with the bottom of a glass dipped in lemon juice. non stick pans tends to make high fat cookies greasy so I used a normal cookie sheet lightly dusted with flour. Timing is important, not in the oven long enough will result in chewy biscuits. A little longer and they will burn. They are about done when the cookie collasp. I didn't have lemon extract, which was a pity but I increased the lemon zest. Better than store bough ones and there's only half the batch left(only because I intervened fast enough by serving dinner)

I made this as suggested with butter and 2 tsps lemon extract. They turned out like greasy, lemony, crunchy crackers. Yuck! I suggest not wasting your time or money making these.

I first made this recipe from the Gourmet Best Desserts cookbook that I have at home. The recipe in the book is slightly different and calls for the addition of candied lemon peel. They are hands down one of my favorite cookies and I found the dough very easy to form into logs. I have also made these substituting orange extract, zest, and candied orange peel; also very good.

I didn't roll the cookies, I scooped them with a very small scoop. I also sprinkled a little lemon zest on top. Guests loved them.

Anyone having trouble cutting the dough may try unflavored dental floss. Start by placing it underneath, wrap around and pull through the dough.

These are good (just because I love lemon) but aren't anything extraordinary. They are, however a big hit with my toddler son. I used prior suggestions and used 2 tsp lemon extract and all butter. The lemon is just right that way - I can't imagine these with only a 1/2 tsp.

Really nice to have something different! I used 2t extract but still wouldn't have minded more lemon -- maybe an essential oil??? I too had difficulty with the dough and resorted to just making balls. The first tray looked way too plain though so the next I dipped the top of the ball in those large-sized sugar pieces used in Scandinavian pastry (sorry, don't know what they're called nor unfortunately, where to get more) and this made them VERY pretty and VERY worth repeating. OH: if you haven't invested in a microplane yet, this is the recipe to do it for, you'll be amazed as the light airy zest.

Excellent. Used all butter and 2 times as much lemon extract. Was a real hit at Christmas family gathering. Thin, crisp, and refreshing cookie.

This is a great recipe and has drawn rave reviews when I've served them at parties. Two very important things to keep in mind. First, buy LOTS of lemons.... 1 1/2 Tbs of zest requires quite a few lemons. Secondly, freeze the dough. Makes it a lot easier to work with. Come summertime, I'm going to make a batch using lime juice and zest and see how they go with margueritas.

Greasy results that were unservable (luckily I had mocha brownies and orange spice pumpkin pie from this site as back-up!)I measured carefully creamed, baked and UGH--brown edges, pale white middles and greasy greasy greasy. Plus 2 hrs chilling is not enough. Maybe if I'd chilled overnight. But I'll never do this again! The batter was good, but the cookies dreadful.

The flavor of these cookies is great if you use the 2t of lemon extract, but the dough was so difficult to work with! It kept crumbling as I tried to slice it thin. I finally figured out that I had to keep cleaning my knife after every slice. Cookies are great but I don't know if they are worth the frustration!

Excellent receipe. The dough was pretty sticky even after refridgeration, however not impossible to work with. The cookies were thin, crispy enough and gently lemon flavored. This is a perfect cookie for summertime and I will add this to my receipe box.

These cookies are delicious! I made the first batch as recommended by other reviewers ( all butter, extra lemon extract, no rolling, etc.)and was very pleased with the results. However, my husband is not a lemon-lover so I made a second batch using fresh orange juice, orange zest, etc. Although the flavor was not as intense as the lemon variety, I thought they were a good alternative.

This is a GREAT recipe if you love lemon. I always double it now when I make it. Wonderful!!!

Way too given to an abundance of chocolate and desperate to vary the annual holiday cookie assortment (though "too much chocolate" is an oxymoron), I made these incorporating previous suggestions of all-butter, no rolling and two tsp. of the lemon extract. I loved them, but more importantly, so did the people to whom they were given. Lemon in a box of Christmas cookies struck them as a refreshing, unexpected surprise. The only thing I'll do differently next time is throw in the rest of the grated zest from the lemons (I had about 1 tsp. extra) because I hate the waste and I'm sure they wouldn't have hurt the cookie. I wonder if the recipe would work with a light sprinkling of chopped pecans....

Absolutely Famtastic!!! I took the advice to use in 2 tsp lemon extract, otherwise same. It is really hard to handle though. Put it in a sealable plastic container in the refrigerator for about an hour then formed it into two logs. Put it back for a couple of more hours. It was still soft but workable. Though cookies are not professional looking-- so delish who cares.

These cookies are so tasty! They remind me of the lemon cookies from Crabtree and Evelyn - but better! I was trying to get a jump on my Christmas baking so I thought I'd made up the batter, roll and freeze. I sliced off 6 cookies and baked them just so I could taste the finished product. After tasting them my husband insisted I bake the rest of the roll. Crisp, great lemon flavor and not too sweet. Yum!

My family and friends love these! I made the recipe using some of the suggestions below: I used all butter rather than part shortening, part butter; increased the amount of lemon extract to 2 teaspoons; and didn't bother with the log, electing instead to chill the mixture in the refrigerator for an hour and then make marble-sized balls with my hands, which I then pressed onto a cookie sheet until they were about the size of thick quarters. (I got about 28 cookies per sheet.) I served them with green tea ice cream at a dinner party and got rave reviews from everyone, along with multiple requests for the recipe.

These were wonderful, and gone before I had a chance to take them to the office. I took other reviewers advise, butter instead of shortening, and a lot more lemon - I love lemon. Didn't bother with rolling it into a log, just stuck the bowl in the refrig to chill, and made little mounds on the cookie sheet. I'm going to triple the receipe next time so I'll have some the next day.

I made these with my eight year old this morning. They were all gone by lunch time. I used butter instead of shortning and 2 tsps of lemon extract. The rolling up into waxed paper was a mess, so I put the room temperature dough into a disposable pastry bag with the end snipped off and piped quarter sized "balls" on to parchment lined cookie sheets, then I chilled the dough (cookie sheets and all) for about ten minutes before baking.We will make these again for sure. My daughter wanted to go to the store for more lemons as soon as she ate the last cookie!!!

I used 2 tsp. extract to bring out the lemon flavor, and that's the saving grace of these cookies. The dough was really soft and creamy. Even after 4 hours of chilling, it never firmed up. Doesn't matter in the end, because the cookies spread out pretty evenly on their own in the oven. Could probably skip forming it into a log and just refrigerate the mixing bowl and then scoop the dough onto the baking sheet drop-cookie style. Can't deny that the cookies are thin, crispy, sweet, and tart (the confectioner's sugar really adds a great dimension), but they just don't wow me like I hoped they would.

I made these cookies this afternoon and they turned out very well and very thin. I used 2tsp of the lemon extract, used unsalted butter instead of the shortening and baked them on silpat liners and they turned out wonderfully. They are very lemony and tart and not too sweet.

Excellent. With the "add more lemon extract" suggestion from reviewers, this recipe is just what I was looking for: a crisp, lemony, delicious cookie.

I didn't know what to expect since the previous reviews varied so much, but I thought these were fairly good. I added extra extract (1.5 tsp) and used unsalted butter instead of the shortening. I tested them out on friends and they loved them!

I was looking for a thin and very lemony cookie, i loved the way this came out but i wanted it extra lemony so i added 2-3 times more of the extract... would make again ********

They were ok. I substituted the lemon extract for extra zest for a more real lemon taste. But they spread too much during baking. I don't think I'll make them again unless someone asks especially for them.

They didn't taste lemony at all -- they were more like sugar cookies, which is fine except that's not what I wanted to make!

I made these for dear friends in Arizona as a hostess gift for staying at their house. Keebler/Sunshine used to make "Lemon Coolers," but they are no longer available. After I searched every local supermarket, I decided to find a "substitute" on the net...They were quite a big hit and now his wife has to make them for him because he loved them so much!

Don't like at all. Maybe if you use fresh unsalted butter in place of the shortening...
