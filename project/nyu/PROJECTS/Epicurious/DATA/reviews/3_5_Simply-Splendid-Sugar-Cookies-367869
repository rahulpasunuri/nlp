I used this recipe to make spritz cookies. It was simple, easy, and tasty. You've gotta like crispy cookies in order to like them though. And cut down on the baking time...the brown quickly.

I sucked it up and tried making the cookies again, and found some adjustments that made an easier-to-handle dough and softer cookie. Cooling the dough in the refrigerator for an hour helped immensely with the stickiness problem. If you're in between batches in the oven, I suggest placing the dough in the refrigerator during that time also to prevent sticking in the later batches. Instead of rolling the cookies in the sugar and then pressing them, I pressed the cookies then added the sugar... I'm not sure it makes a huge difference, but I found it a quicker easier process and maybe slightly more healthy with less sugar? I also adjusted the temperature on the oven to 365 and cooked for 9 minutes--the cookies were still a little crispy when they cooled, but much better. Next time I'll probably add a tad more butter and cook for 8 minutes for a softer end product.

To preface, I've never made sugar cookies before. I really like them, but I like them to be soft, and these ended up crispy (I know, cook them for less time, but it's too late for that now. I'm also not sure that cooking for less time would solve that problem, I feel like they might just be undercooked). Like other reviewers, I also found the dough to be WAY too sticky, and nowhere does the recipe indicate that for the normal/ball method, should one refrigerate the dough. The texture, the whole wheat, the ease, everything else was great. I just prefer a softer cookie, and thought the process of forming the cookies was cumbersome because of the stickiness of the dough.

I made this recipe two different ways about a week ago or so. I followed the recipe exactly but exchanged one of the tsps of Vanilla with a Rum extract for a little more complexity. The first batch I rolled out after it had chilled between two large pieces of wax paper and used it with Christmas cut-outs for decorating later. The second batch I made as the recipe calls and rolled little balls. However, instead of sugar sprinkles I mixed cinnamon and sugar and dipped them into that mixture right before baking. Both were delicious but I prefer the second preparation a bit more. I'm making them again today for a Christmas party I'm having later. Great recipe and smells AMAZING when it's baking! For those that claim the dough is too sticky, if you chill it properly before baking (as you are supposed to with almost all cookie dough recipes) you shouldn't have an issue.

These cookies were pretty easy to make. The dough was sticky, yet easy to handle. I did not press them. Baked them in ball shape and they came out beautifully. The problem is that they turned out to be pretty bland. I decided that I don't like egg white in cookies. I know it makes them light and airy but also gives them an unpleasent smell, despite the generous amount of vanila extract. Next time I will try without the egg whites.

These are great! I used only all-purpose flour, and flattened them with my hand because the dough stuck to the bottom of the glass.

Delicious cookies! This was an easy recipe. I admit I failed to have white wheat on hand and used only all-purpose flour. It was not at all sticky, and the resulting cookies are delish! My kids love them.

We really loved this cookie recipe, even my picky husband!! it was so light and refreshing compared to my grandma's lard-filled cookies! This will be a Christmas staple for my family now!

I think this is a lovely, easy recipe! It's fun for the kids to roll the balls and decorate the cookies. Also, doubles as a "butter" cookie if you don't roll in sugar. I mixed whole wheat pastry flour and regular all purpose flour. I had no issues with the dough, sticky or otherwise.

This dough is super sticky not even the flour will make it go away :(

I really love the texture that the whole wheat gives these cookies, which is why I worked at this recipe until I got a good result. The biggest hurtle is that they're fairly dry. I added an extra half stick of butter on my last batch, and that seemed to be the best amount (for drop cookies). I also baked them at 360 and took them out before they were done, letting them firm up outside the oven. When I bake from online recipes I usually halve the sugar, but you'll need the full amount with these cookies. Overall, the texture of the whole wheat makes these worthwhile.

My granddaughter, who is 9, and I have made a number of different sugar cookie recipes. We found this dough to be easy to handle, tender, and quite tasty. We floured our hands so the balls would be easy to roll. We will use this dough to make rolled out & cut Christmas cookies soon.
