This had a phenomenal taste. It went very quickly at work. I would add corn syrup to the topping as well, since I had trouble with crystallization. But it was stunning and delicious. Making it again for a Christmas party this weekend.

This recipe is great! I would add some corn syrup to the caramel recipe. I have made this 7 times and each time I get requests to make it again. I even had a friend order one to go back with her to New York. I also used Bushmills Irish whiskey. Always a winner.

Bravo! Excellent cheesecake with an even better sauce! I cut back a bit on the sugar in the cake, and used a little less cream in the sauce, just to firm it up a little (you can always add more cream later if the sauce is too thick, but it's hard to go the other way). Cheesecake has good texture, but I baked it in a water bath to keep it creamy.

THIS IS AWESOME CHEESECAKE! I have made so many and this one is a favorite! The filling is so ultra creamy and the caramel is the best I have ever made! Ignore the poor reviews, they must have made errors, cause it is superb!

Made this for a baking contest and although it sounds good, it was definitely NOT one of the best entries. Topping is EXTREMELY sweet, and not worth the effort.

I followed the recipe exactly -- and got a cheesecake swimming in butterscotch soup! I do not know what went wrong, but the buttersctoch topping refused to firm up at all. The cheesecake alone was good, but nothing to rave about.

This is grand cheesecake! And I don't think I've ever made -- or tasted, for that matter -- better caramel sauce and I dearly love caramel sauce. One caveat: Don't beat the cheesecake batter too long. You'll incorporate too much air into it and your cheesecake will rise too high in the oven, then you'll have trouble getting all the wonderful toppings on it. I sliced off the top of my cheesecake after it baked and proceeded from there. This is a beautiful and absolutely delicious creation. I'll make it often and the caramel sauce I'll make VERY often!

Best cheescake ever!I made 8 of them for a party in 1993 and have been making it ever since. My friends lust for it and it is always the hit of the party.

This cheesecake is not your average cheesecake. I served it for a dinner party a few months ago and my friends still rave about it. It's wonderful!

Best cheesecake I've ever made. And I've made MANY. It has an extremely reach flavour. The shortbread crust is perfect. Now I include it in most of other cheesecakes. I have made it again and again. The darker the topping, the better. When it reaches the bitterness prior to burning, it adds an unexpected body to the whole mixture of flavours. But it burns easily, so one has to be very attent... It's a very convincing cheesecake.

I have made this twice and it was spectacular both times. Everyone has asked me to make it again. I'd highly recommend it!!!
