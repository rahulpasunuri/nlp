Not crazy about the texture of the crystalized ginger, so I think it would be better left out. And next time i'm going to swirl in a rum caramel sauce for a "Dark and Stormy" style ice cream.

I would recommend reducing either the candied ginger or the ginger root (or both). The flavor was very strong. But the texture of this recipe was ideal. I will use it as my standard ice cream base recipe.

Wonderful! Tasted just enough of ginger with 1/4 cup and no candied ginger. Great smooth texture - used 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup skim milk.

Loved it! Made some changes, added fresh vanilla bean and eliminated a few steps with amazing results! Shared with friends and is a huge hit. http://www.7thavenuecook.blogspot.com/

Fantastic! I left out the candied ginger, because I like my ice cream's smooth. The texture of this ice cream held up really well even after setting in the freezer (sometimes home-made ice creams become icy if you don't eat them straight from the mixer.) I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe, although i did vary it quite a bit. I used slightly less ginger than called for, and i used 2 c. heavy cream and 1c. whole milk in stead of what was specified. In addition. instead of the crystalized ginger, I added about 1/2 c. crushed up "ginger-os" (by newman's own). Delicious.

Excellent recipe! Like most others, I used a bit more ginger root and a bit less crystalized ginger. It came out tasting wonderful, but perhaps a bit strong for those who don't like ginger as much. I had never chopped crystalized ginger before, so it took a few tries to get it right. I tried using a greased knife on a greased cutting board, but it took too long and was too coarse. I ended up freezing the ginger for about 20 minutes then running it through a nut chopper. The end result was perfectly chopped crystalized ginger which didn't stick together much. I chopped it right before mixing it in.

Give me an A, give me an Wesome. What does it spell, AWESOME, which is exactly what this ice cream is. You should crystallize your own ginger, surprisingly easy.

I plan on making this on the weekend. At the Whole Foods Market, I found a 7 oz. can of "Crystallized Ginger Chips" from Australia for $3.99.The largest piece in the can is the size of a chocolate chip.

Served with a ginger cake and the ice cream stole the show!

I also increased the fresh ginger to 1/2 cup. After bringing the half & half/ginger/sugar mixture almost to a boil, I took it off the heat, covered it, and let it steep for about an hour before mixing with the eggs and reheating. My thought here was to infuse the custard with even more ginger flavor. I tasted it before freezing and decided against adding the crystallized ginger because the flavor was already great! This is a lovely ice cream.

We made this as directed and were more than pleased with the results. You have to like ginger to like this ice cream. All of our guests we quite wild about it, too. We did use a themometer on the second batch and at 170 the custard was perfect. Came out a bit thicker when we we just eyeballed it on the back of spoon. Turn up heat gradually if temp isn't reached in a few minutes.

Gee, everyone else liked the recipe, but my husband and I (both ginger lovers) didn't particularly. I followed the recipe exactly. 1) Like another cook, I couldn't get the mixture to 170 degrees--155 was as close as I could get. Finally it almost curdled, so I continued on. 2) Finely chopping crystallized ginger is not easy--kind of like chopping dates. Everything sticks to the knife and pieces stick together. 3)ginger and the ultra-creaminess of the custard did not go well together in our estimation.

I made a few alterations, but I think I stayed true to the recipe (I upped the fresh ginger to about 1/2 cup and didn't use any crystalized ginger. I also substituted 1 c skim & 1 c heavy cream for the 2 cups of half and half. And I reduced the amount of vanilla to 1/4 tsp. Ok, so maybe a lot of alterations here). But the end result is fabulous!

This ice cream was GREAT!! I used a little over 1/3 cup of fresh ginger and used the crysalized ginger as a topping instead of mixing it into the ice cream. I served it with broiled pineapple and the sweetness of the fruit complemented the spicyness of the ginger (and let me tell you, mine was extra spicy - just the way I like it!)

I made this this weekend and it was fabulous. I used the stated amount of fresh ginger and close to the stated amount of crystallized ginger. It was very rich and perfectly gingery for my tastes!

Really delicious. And, while I used the full 1/2 cup of crystallized ginger, I agree that it could be reduced--depends on your taste. I went a little crazy and served this with an Italian pandoro and caramel sauce--heavenly.

I give it 4 forks, but with a BIG caveat, which is that for once I actually followed the recipe exactly, and came to grief for my trouble. The recipe says cook the custard to 170 degrees. Experience would indicate that this should have taken at most 10 minutes. Twenty minutes of stirring (and the liquid evaporating), and the temperature was still hovering around the 100 degree mark. My instinct told me that coating the spoon would have been sufficient, and despairing of it ever reaching its temperature goal, I finally took it off the stove. The ice cream was amazing. But all that cooking meant that instead of a quart of the lovely stuff, I only had a pint to show for all that work.

Awesome dessert! Flavorful and smooth, a big hit at a dinner party! Increased fresh ginger to about 1/3 cup and served the cryatallized ginger as a topping (looks pretty and guests appreciated adjusting their own ginger potentcy). Served with fresh mango but the ice cream was the star!

Ginger lover applaudes!!!! I followed the recipe exactly (well maybe I used a lil more fresh and crystalized ginger)...thought it was delish! Very creamy!

This was outstanding. I agree with all the prior reviewers' recommendations to decrease the amount of crystallized and to add more of the freshly grated ginger. I would not add more than 1/4 cup of the crystallized stuff next time, but will DEFINITELY make this again.

Terrific! Followed the suggestions and used less crystallized ginger and more of the fresh stuff --good advice. It came out deliciously gingery and slightly "piquante."

This ice cream had a great, authentic taste! Just like what I have enjoyed in Japanese restaurants! I did substitute whole milk in for some of the half and half as I normally buy heavy cream and milk for my ice cream recipes and it came out great. Didn't have crystallized ginger at the time, but I do now! So I am anxious to try it again. Oh and we topped it with nectarines soaked in a little maple sugar and amaretto - heavenly!

We loved this!! Though I used what I had on hand for the milk (H&H and whole milk) this was a creamy concoction subtly flavored with ginger, just what I was hoping for. It's a keeper!! I skipped the crystallized ginger -- it's often harsh.

Flavor was exactly what I wanted. Served it with the broiled pineapple (epicurious recipe also). It was a hit and would do it again. Also, I did not add the candied ginger to the ice cream but chopped it up and sprinkled it on top.

I think I overloaded the candied ginger, and the result was a bit much on the ginger effect (that tickle in the back of the throat and nose). I'll make it again, but probably follow the other reviewer who boosted the grated fresh ginger and held back on the crystals. This would be great with a caramel ripple, but serving caramel sauce over the top is just as good.

Holy Cow, this ice cream was great! I put in a tad more of the grated ginger and a tad less of the crystalized ginger. I plan on serving it topped with mango with brandy and mandrarino. I can't wait!

Rich and gingery -- the combo of fresh and crystallized gingers is certainly a winner! I also made it a few days in advance of my dinner party to accompany a warm fruit tart, and my guests were thrilled by both homemade treats.

A GREAT ice cream for ginger lovers! I ommitted the vanilla the second time and it was perfect. Also great as a topping for pumpkin or apple pie. I also did not make it in pie form - simply ice cream. Delicious!
