It's great to have a soup recipe that is just classic and delicious--and easy. Like other reviewers, I added extra veggies/bacon. I spiced this version up a bit with some pimenton, black pepper, and a hit of cumin.

Never a lentil fan, I have now made this recipe several times, adapting quantities down slightly so that the soup is very fresh, for two. I use back bacon, and leeks instead of onions. And if I have one in the fridge, I add a section of orange pepper to the pot for fun! Super taste!

hey - now they've forgotten to include the bacon in the ingredients! (all I do is keep coming back to this recipe to see what's missing next - I've got to get a job...)

This soup rocks! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the onions, carrots, celery and garlic. I also added 1.5 tsp of cumin before adding the broth. I've made this soup with 4 slices of bacon but this last time I used 8 slices (we're bacon monsters) and it was fabulous. Hoping that it will freeze well. A keeper!!

i've made this soup twice, each time with good results. used 1-2 bacon slices and roasted vegetable stock, and pureed about half the soup. an easy soup with a great taste.

This soup tasted delicious. I followed other reviewer's advice and added more carrots, bacon and onions. I turned half of the soup through my food mill which gave the soup a good consistency. I added goats cheese as a garnish which I would highly recommend. This soup will be a staple for us this winter.

This is a great, easy lentil soup recipe. I didn't puree any of it and added considerably more onion, celery and carrot, plus diced potatoes. It's foolproof and is a great meal to bring to work.

Since I didn't have any bacon (and didn't feel like going to the store just to buy some), I made the soup with olive oil and then added bacon bits to each bowl when serving. I also doubled all the veggies except the carrots and added a red pepper that was in danger of going bad if I didn't use it. I think the red pepper added something extra because every time I heat up the soup leftovers for lunch, the aroma is amazing. I did use the thyme and the bayleaf, but instead of the parsley or chives, I added about half a teaspoon of herbes de provence, which was a good addition. All in all, the soup is delicious, although i do have to say that I prefer the other version that I sometimes make (with smoked sausage). p.s. I didn't use broth, rather opting out for water and some boullion cubes.

Love this simple recipe. The only lentil soup I make now. As suggested by previous reviewers, I double the carrots, celery, onion, garlic and bacon. I don't puree the soup and add a nice splash of balsamic at the end.

Didn't use any bacon, just some olive oil to cook the vegetables and it was delicious. Very easy to make, very tasty.

Easy to prepare and delicious. We are vegetarians and substitued parmesan rind for the bacon.

Delicious! Made this in a regular saucepan, with a little oil for the onions, carrots, garlic (and don't forget the!) celery. Perfect for a week's worth of lunches.

This recipe is really good I used italian sausage instead of bacon and doubled all of the veggies and herbs. I didnt have carrots but I didnt miss them, plus I added some cayenne pepper to add some heat. My family said this is a KEEPER

I thought this was a great basic recipe that was even better after pumping it up by (a) adopting reviewers' suggestions of increasing the bacon (I sauteed the bacon pieces before the veggies and spooned off all but 1 T of fat) and doubling the veggies, and (b) adding in 1.5 t cumin and a pinch of cayenne when adding the lentils, broth, etc. I also used a combo of chicken and beef broth. Very earthy, very tasty!

I am a fan of lentils, bacon, AND soup.. but this soup was not tasty at all. Per others' recommendations, I used 4 pieces of bacon (cooked separately) and cooked the veggies in a little bit of the left over bacon fat. The soup still tasted blah and looked like brown mush. Usually I can get past the appearance of lentils if they taste good.. but this one just didn't have anything to offer.

Rating: 3
Outstanding! I used turkey bacon to lower the fat, also used my stick blender to puree right in the pot. It needed extra stock to thin it a bit, but what a hearty soup. My husband and I have been enjoying the leftovers all week.

I really enjoyes this soup, but I did make some modifications. First I doubled everything. I used my own homemade soup stock using a recipe from Alton Brown (foodtv.com). I have a hand held stick blender, so I used that to puree the entire soup right in the pot. Great soup, I'll make it again, but I'll add even more garlic next time.

This soup is awesome! I added one plum tomatoe, sliced and diced, used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. SO good. i also added some thyme and rosemary to give the flavors some more intensity. even better on the second and third day. I will definitely make this soup again.

i would only rate this 4 forks with the addition of kale. a bit of sausage was also a nice touch, and more carrots than called for (about a pound). this has become a winter regular. yum!

This recipe tastes excellent. I threw in two Turkish bay leaves, and about 5 thyme sprigs, pureed with a giraffe right in the pot. Very flavordul. Used red lentils.

Terrific! And simple to make! I adapted...like everyone else. I browned 4 pieces of bacon, used mostly beef broth with a little chicken broth. And then used my immersion blender to pureed only part of the soup. The carrots which were left in chunks gave it a spark of color which helped the visual appeal! This is a keeper!

Very tasty and love the smoky flavor of the bacon.

This one was a big hit with everyone...including the kids! I too, used a bit more bacon than called for (3 slices). Just an FYI...the written portion of the recipe doesn't tell you to add the celery (obviously added when you add the onion and carrot etc).

Really great and simple. Added more bacon (4 slices and cooked first). Used 4 cups beef broth and 3 chicken broth (b/c I had beef broth). Thinned with 1 cup chicken broth after puree. The scallions are a tasty touch at the end.

Very good; wife says it's the best lentil soup she's every had. I used 3/4 lb cubed ham steak instead of bacon and lifted the idea of adding 1/2 lb de-stemmed spinach 15 minutes before the cooking was done from another Epicurious lentil recipe.

By far the best lentil soup I've ever tasted. I followed the others' advice and added more bacon. I couldn't imagine using any less than 4 slices! I used a thick cut maple smoked bacon & it was divine! Next time I will cook the bacon first & use the grease to cook the vegetables after. The bacon did end up a bit limp. I ended up using 4 cans of chicken broth and 3 cups lentils - really thick and hearty.

Great soup! This is my first time making lentil soup and I like a real thick and hearty soup, so I made a few changes. I used 4 pieces of bacon (trimmed the fat on 2 strips), used 6 cups of chicken broth and 16oz (1 lb.) of dried lentils. When soup was done, I used the 7th cup of broth to thin the soup to my desired consistency. So thick, tasty and filling!

Very nummy! Perhaps I should have know this, but I didn't cook the bacon prior to adding it to the soup. It did cook through, but I prefer my bacon crispy to add texture to the soup. I too upped the bacon to four slices, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The color is a little off-putting (much like baby food), but the taste is devine.

Delicious and hearty and wonderful for a cold day. We couldn't keep it in the house for long. A great meal when served with rosemary bread and a salad. I changed it a little... added four extra slices of bacon and put in extra broth. Also, added celery salt and extra parsley. Definitely will be a wintertime staple in my kitchen!

Best lentil soup ever!! I usually don't like lentil soup but I added an extra 4 slices of bacon and used the organic red lentils along with organic regular I think that makes a huge difference!! It is awesome.

Rating: 4
Fabulous...but then I changed lots of items! I sauteed carrot, garlic, onion, dried thyme, and thick slab peppered bacon, added my turkey stock from Thanksgiving turkey, and a can of black beans. Pureed 3/4 of it. It was a huge hit. Very easy recipe with great results. Served it Curried Turkey Mango Salad (found on this site).

I made this with meatless SmartBacon and used a combination of red and green lentils. I simmered it for more than 45 min, but the green lentils still weren't tender -- probably because they were not-quite-new. At any rate, I thought it was tasty with some hearty bread as an accompaniment.

This was a delicious lentil soup. I left out the bacon, and sauteed the veggies in a bit of olive oil instead. I also added a touch of cumin near the end. It turned out really well. A very healthy dish without the bacon. I'll definately make this again!

Tasty and filling--a good soup for a chilly autumn day. I agree with the reviewer who thought the color was terrible, so I might try this recipe using green or red lentils next time to see if this makes a difference.

I didn't use any bacon, but the soup turned out well regardless. It was surprisingly tasty, considering the simple ingredients and lack of oil (or anything else fatty). I would definitely make it again.

This soup is so good, even my bean-hating family loves it! It's perfect for a simple weeknight dinner, and the left-overs (if there are any!) are great for lunches.
