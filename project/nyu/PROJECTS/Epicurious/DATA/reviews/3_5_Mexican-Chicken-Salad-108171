Made this for my hubby and I last night and it was a refreshing and light dinner. Based on other reviews I made a few modifications. I added chipotle peppers and ground, roasted cumin to the dressing mixture. I added black beans, corn, and radishes to the salad. I did use sour cream for the dressing and it came out really thick. I had trouble blending the dressing and will try out the yogurt next time. I used a rotisserie chicken rather than making my own chicken. I thought this was really easy to make and love that it's non-cook.

The dressing is cool and refreshing - but I felt it needed something extra. I only added more salt/pepper and 2 T. olive oil and it was better. It's not out-of-this-world good, but it's good.

This was very bland as written. So I made tons of changes and additions just so my family would eat it. To the dressing I add to the blender about 5 roasted green chilis and about 1/4 teas. cayenne pepper. I also roasted a small head of garlic and use that instead of raw. Do not use all the lime juice or it will be way to tart. To the salad I added chopped orange bell pepper, diced tomato, black beans and a bag of thawed frozen corn. Tossed it all together and served on a bed of romaine lettuce. It was good when it was all said and done but a lot more work to make it taste good.

I made the dressing as written and it was way too tart. So I added an extra avocado and about 2T of olive oil. True, it's a bit bland so add more garlic, onion and chile to the chicken mixture. I tried carrots, as one reviewer suggested, but they overpowered the flavors with their sweetness.

This was really good. I definetly recommend trying it. Never had jicama before but it was great in the salad.

This was a great dinner but I made many changes. The chicken I used was leftover grilled chicken breast that I cubed. I added corn and black beans as other recommended and it added a lot. I used yogurt instead of sour cream and added the cilantro to the dressing. I also accidentally purchased a poblano chili instead of a Serrano and added that to the blender for the dressing as well. I added peeled and seeded cucumber and forgot the nuts. I served it on a bed of mixed greens. It was a filling, flavorful and wonderful dinner. I bet it will be even better tomorrow as leftovers.

I made this vegetarian by omitting the chicken and adding corn, black beans, a little shredded jack cheese and one extra diced avocado. Also substituted non-fat plain yogurt for sour cream. Turned out AWESOME!!! Serve with thick corn chips or by itself.

I've been making this for years, and with some adjustments it's always a big hit. I always use a store-bought rotisserie chicken, so the meat is extremely tender and moist. Also, I always add more vegetables (carrots, and often radishes, or anything else I have on hand, cut into matchsticks, too).

In part due to the shaky reviews, I only made this dressing to go with my own salad, and even then with two revisions: non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream and added about a tablespoon of adobe (from canned chipotles) for spice. That said, this was maybe the best salad i ever had, with very little fat. So good!

This dressing is amazing, although about half the lime is enough. Also, Instead of using the suggested jicama salad, I used romain, red peppers, red onion, cherry tomatos and corn. This salad is my new favorite!

I'd have given this 2.5 forks if I could. I really liked it and it was a nice alternative to regular chicken salad. I also didn't use all the dressing--I just kept it to the side for use as needed. I think this would have been great with tortilla chips.

To make this easy I used canned white chicken drained.I 1/2 the dressing recipe. I added 1/4 c. guacamole, 1 Tbl. red onion chopped, 2 Tb. tomato chopped. 2 cooked 1/2 cob on the corn corn removed. 1 Pkg of Sazon Goya seasoning. This is a Mexican seasoning that adds lots of flavor and is a staple in Mexican cooking. Made a difference in the dressing flavor. Not bland. Very yummy kids loved this.

As we were eating this salad for dinner last night, my husband politely asked, "So, what do you think?" I replied, "I think it's missing something." His response: "Yeah, like EVERYTHING." This was the most blah, bland salad I've ever made. The jicama, which has nice crunch but not much flavor, is too prevalent (and I followed the recipe exactly). The dressing was nice, but it's creaminess would have been more suited to taming wild chile flavors (not hiding the barely-there flavors of jicama and grilled chicken). If I ever were to make this again, which I will not, I would add lots of fresh corn, chopped red bell pepper, red onion, etc. and cut WAY back on the jicama (and I actually like jicama). Don't waste your time...

Start with a small amount of sauce and add it to taste as it can overcome the other ingredients.

Incredible. Substituted fresh corn for jicama (what the heck is jicama anyway?) and it added a great bite and color. Didn't need all the dressing so reserved some and used it for dip for tortilla chips. The dressing has a wonderful layered flavor of spicy, sweet, and tangy. Quickly prepared the chicken by frying in a bit of oil with the lid on the pan and then shredding with a fork.

This recipe is an excellent use of left over grilled chicken. The dressing requires a very ripe avocado or as stated by a previous reviewer it can be blan. My inclination was to "tweek" the dressing to add more flavor, but resisted, and when pared with the grilled chicken it was superb. We added left over grilled corn and some black beans. Why stop with just jicama?

Quite tasty! I made it to take to a potluck at our church and it would seem that the Methodist are not a very adventurous bunch! However, that was just fine with my husband and I because we really enjoyed it leftover. I can't think of anything I would change about it.

Easy and delicious. We set record high temperatures for April 26 in Southern California today. This cool dish was the perfect quick dinner to cope with the summer-like warmth. I used left-over creme fraiche instead of sour cream, and a few dashes of Tabasco sauce instead of serrano chile. I wanted a little more crunch, so I hand-crushed a few tortilla chips over each serving. This salad is a keeper.

Yum! This was quick, easy & yummy - we used leftover grilled chicken breasts, and making this was a snap. Great for a summer dinner - light, filling & refreshing. We also used the leftover sauce for other uses afterwards, and it was especially good on fajitas.

Here's what I did with this recipe. I couldn't get a jicama due to seasonal reasons so I made a more traditional salad, however added the serreno pepper and cilantro to the dressing. This made for a wonderful sauce that I saw uses for on burrito's. I made an omelette this morning and used the remainder of the dressing on the top. It was fantastic!!

This was fair, nothing special. Don't skimp on the avocado, it's about the only thing that gives this much flavor.

This is quite good, but not extraordinary. My husband thought it needed grapes and I agree it needs something. We got it made in no time. We only used 2/3 of the dressing.

This was a great salad. It took about an hour to prepare, with two of us working. We made the dressing in the CuisineArt mini-chop, rather than the blender. It left a few chucks of avocado, but otherwise was very smooth. The chunks were nice, actually!! I grilled the chicken breasts after flattening them and coating with olive oil, chopped garlic, salt, and a bit of ancho chili powder. A fairly easy week night dinner. Sure beats take-out chicken.
