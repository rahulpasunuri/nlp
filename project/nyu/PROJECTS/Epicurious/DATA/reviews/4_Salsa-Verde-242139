I left out the chicken broth and added fresh parsley, cilantro and oregano. It was delicious! Three jalapenos with seeds made it fabulously hot too, despite charring them. It was wonderful over poached eggs and grilled bread with green beans and tomatoes...perfect spring brunch!

In the winter I broil the veggies in the oven. Sometimes I add a green pepper or anaheim or even banana pepper or two. Sometimes I use broth and others I omit it. I usually add a little lime zest/extra juice and chopped cilantro right after I turn off the heat to brighten up the flavor. Always super delish!

Outstanding! Grilling the vegetables really brings out the flavours. This recipe is better than any other I have tasted. I even freeze this to have on hand. If I do this, I might add fresh lime or cilantro to perk it up. But, often it is still great, as is. I even add this to soups, along with a dollop of sour cream. Also, I have run it through the mini food processor with avocado, as a dressing for salads.

This was delicious. I left out the chicken broth because I didn't think it needed it (seemed like a strange addition.) This is not just delicious, it is phenomenal. As jilllion put it, "Make it. You'll be glad you did." My family suffers from allergies to raw garlic and onions so this recipe hit the spot. It's incredibly easy to make with a gas grill, skewers, and a blender. When the veggies cooled down, I just tossed the tomatillos whole into the blender, along with seeded jalapenos, and everything else. How much easier can it get? I did also simmer this down over low heat. Yum, yum, yum. We fought over the "leftovers" (there weren't any to be had!)

I have a few problems with this recipe 1) It is prety thin, I used 2/3 cup chicken broth and let it cook for 20 mins, and I still had to add corn starch. I'd reccomend 1/4 cup 2) I used 3 serrano chiles, and it was very hot. maybe because my sauce was thinker, the taste came through more. 3) These instructions say to blend all the vegetables together. I find that blending the roasted garlic, peppers, and tomatillos is best, and just chopping and adding the onions and cilantro. This give it more color contrast and varied flavor 4) Forget using 2 TBSP lime juice. Juice half or all of the lime.

Very good, but time consuming. I would make it the day before if you are in a hurry. I cut the recipe in half and had only bought 1 tomatillo instead of 1 pound and it still tasted great. I cooked on an indoor grill pan and it worked fine.

This was wonderful, although I will admit that I used canned tomatillos (and didnt grill them).

Absolutely delicious salsa verde that is as good as any I had in 6 years in San Diego. Grilling the veggies adds a depth of flavor and don't be afraid to use any other green chili in it.
