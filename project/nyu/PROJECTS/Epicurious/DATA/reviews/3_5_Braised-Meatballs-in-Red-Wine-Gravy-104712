This is a staple in our household. My variation on the recipe includes the trifecta of meatball meat: beef, pork and veal. The combination of these meats makes an absolutely delicious meatball. If you don't have summer savory, use sage - a bit more forceful in flavor, but no less delicous. This is an easy, elegant dinner for family or for entertaining. I just love this recipe!

I loved the texture of the meatballs so much that the next time I turned it into a meatloaf which in turn made wonderful sandwiches. The gravy is also excellent. Served with Mashed Potatoes with Spinach and Cheese.

Very important to make sure you use a good red wine when making this recipe. The flavor of the wine is front and center and if you use a cheap cooking wine that you don't particularly like the taste of, it will affect how the flavor of the gravy turns out. If you are short on time, you can substitute frozen meatballs instead of making your own. The first time we made this, it was perfect! The second time we made this, we used a different wine which really impacted the flavor of the gravy. So I used sun-dried tomato paste instead of regular tomato paste, add red pepper flakes to taste, and used some Bisto (British Brown Gravy Mix) to round the flavor out. Just delicious!! We had pasta with the meatballs but you could use mashed potatoes or polenta instead. We also like to put the meatballs and gravy on a bed of lettuce and spinach.

I have reviewed this recipe and just made it again after a couple of years. Make sure you use a wine you like and do not cheap out. I used a new (cheap) pinot noir and have to say it really effected the flavor. I usually use Yellowtail Shiraz. Also I thicken it as well with flour/water combo because I do not think the gravy thickens that much on own.

question: can we freeze the meatballs?

Rating: 4
Since first discovering this recipe a couple months ago, I have made these at least three or four times. They work as an appetizer everyone can pick from, or as a satisfying main dish with some seasoned mashed potatoes and a vegetable. A friend described them lovingly as "winey and salty," and my father tried them at Thanksgiving and insisted they make another appearance at Christmas. The baking aspect can be time-consuming because the recipe makes quite a few balls, but it is worth the patience.

This is one terrific recipe. The only change I made in it, and I think this is important, was to divide the meat into half beef, and half ground pork. My family always begs me to make these for family celebrations. The kids, as well as the adults just love them!

I have made these meatballs many times. A party classic. I do agree they can be time consuming in preparation. I have cut some corners if I do not have the time by actually buying premade meatballs. I slow cook them all day in the red wine gravy sauce. I use a Shiraz for the sauce and I also thicken the sauce with flour. They are delicious and perfect for parties.

I love meatballs. I make Swedish meatballs and Italian meatballs. This one is just a rich delight. I havent made it in years but I had to thaw about the amount of meat called for so I searched this out. It is peculiar using a food processor, and cooking in the oven but it certainly changes the texture, flavor and makes it special. I found that the frying in pan to be difficult at medium high so thats about the only change I have made (ok I left out the Summer Savory too!): I kept an eye on it switching from medium to low. My husband who was born and raised in Sweden ate a ton and declared these to be the best he has ever had. It is a difficult and time consuming recipe and one should expect to wash a ton of dishes, hands frequently, pans, and implements as you go.

I served these at a party and everyone seemed to enjoy them. Not an item people raved about, but all the meatballs were eaten. The only change I made was to use a mixture of pork, veal, and beef. Processing the mixture in the food processor provided a great texture, making shaping the meatballs a breeze. I also loved the technique of baking them first and then browning. It was easy and allowed the meatballs to cook perfectly. I did have to simmer my sauce much longer than indicated to get it to thicken.

Rating: 4
Very nice. I substituted 1 1/3 wheat germ for the bread and just mixed in the milk with the meat. I also used 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 ground pork plus 1 tsp unflavored gelatine. The gelatin binds the liquid and keeps the meatballs moist. A great recipe.

This is an all-time favortie recipe for my entire family. The only change I made and think it really adds, is to use half beef and half ground pork. The processing really makes the meatballs so very tender. Just wonderful!

I don't know. Made this one as directed, except for subbed ground turkey for half the beef, and added a pinch of fennel seed to the meatball mix (which imparted a desirable Italian-sausage effect, very nice). But still, there was something... cafeteria-ish about this one. It might be just the thing for getting a kid to try something new, though.

Rating: 0
Wonderful recipe! As others have commented, the gravy is sublime. The only alterations I made were to substitute thyme leaves for the summer savory, and to skip the processing step. I just wasn't brave enough to pulverize the meat mixture to that level. I served the meatballs with mashed potatoes, and all turned out beautifully. We enjoyed the meal with candlelight and a glass of red wine. My husband loved it!

Amazing! I made the meatballs with ground turkey, and used a $7 bottle of red California wine. The meatballs were so moist and juicy, amazing. They were devoured by my boyfriend, only to hear the next day that he prefers crispier meatballs. Either way, this dish is decadent and ...a lot of work.

I tried this recipe last night, needed comfort food to compensate for the miserable winter we are having in this part of Canada. I stuck to the recipe exactly (which is unusual for me!) as I wanted to know how this meal would taste. It is alot of work but well worth it. Processing the meatballs definitely changed the texture and taste from regular meatballs, my husband and I really liked this style. Next time I will add garlic to the meatballs and probably add the baked bits from baking dish to the sauce. I used a good quality red wine from the Burgundy region. I made a rice dish using baby spinach and grated Pecorino cheese, sort of a fast risotto! I would definitely serve this to guests and keep this as a staple comfort food.

Rating: 4
I love this dish - it is a lot of work but it is worth it. This time I added 8 oz sliced mushrooms and sauteed them after I browned the meatballs but before I put them all back in. Excellent. I also served them tonight with wide egg noodles (with butter, chopped italian parsley and s&p). Excellent. Fabulous.

This one is amazing. I love cooking with wine and this was right up my way. I made the mashed potatoes with it, which I am sorry to say I regret. The cheese was horrible, maybe with a different less pugnent cheese it would have been awesome. The cheese ruined the meal for me and kitchen stunk for a week. Meatball made up for it though. Everyone that taste this loves it.

I know this is horrible, but I used frozen meatballs we had leftover from a cocktail party. I made the gravy for a change of taste and WOW! I can't wait to make the meatballs next time! My husband and father raved about the flavor. My only complaint is that the gravy was a little runnier than I expect gravy to be...although, this could be due to the fact that my meatballs were a (lazy) short-cut.

Have been wanting to make this for awhile and finally did. Yuh-um. We loved it. Made it with the potato recipe as well.

The meatball recipe alone is great and can be used with different sauces, the last being a raspberry chipotle. I've used a teriyaki sauce, a marinara and will try them again with a mango habenero sauce. I cook them completely in the oven-no flour or frying.

Delicious. A great make-ahead dish. After finishing the dish, I found that the sauce was a bit too winey for my children, so I removed about 1 1/2 cups of it, replaced it with more beef broth, and re-thickened it with a beurre manie. It turned out fabulous. However, if I was only serving adults, the full wine flavored gravy would be great. Great comfort dish when served with the mashed potatoes.

I did use a good Australian Merlot for the sauce. I served this dish with some hot buttered egg noodles. It turned out wonderful and would not hesitate to make this dish again in the future, as I know it will be requested again by my husband.

Wonderful! The meatballs were "melt in your mouth" and the sauce was sooooo rich. I followed the directions and cooked the meatballs in the oven and then browned in skillet. But, I made a few ingredient changes per other reviews. I used 1 lb ground sirloin and 1 lb ground pork, subbed ground thyme for the savory, added 2 garlic gloves and about 1/2 cup grated parmensan cheese to the meatballs. For the gravy I used a Ravenswood Zin, low sodium beef broth and added 2 more minced garlic cloves. Served over mashed potatoes and my 2,6 and 8 year children gobbled it up as well. There was enough sauce leftover to freeze and use on potatoes some other time. Will most certainly make again.

Great recipe! My husband thinks they are the best meatballs he's ever had, and loves the gravy. I use thyme instead of savory, and a good quality dry red wine. The gravy makes this dish! I will make and then put in a crock pot to keep warm for a while. I've also frozen half and reheated in a crockpot. It's not as good as freshly made, by any means, but for a no cook meal for my husband, it works fine.

I thought that these were the best meatballs I've ever had.

Didn't have to change the gravy recipe - it was perfect, and tasted so good with mashed potatoes. Will definitely make these again...what a fabulous recipe!

Rating: 2
Skimping on the rating because I just made these last night and haven't served to company yet. But regarding some reviewer's comments that the gravy was bad, this gravy has so much wine in it that if you use a poor quality wine or a wine that isn't dry, the gravy could easily be lousy. I used the pervasive Australian Shiraz from Trader Joe's, probably about 8 dollars a bottle. Not high end, but make sure you use an at least marginally decent red wine. The meatballs taste wonderful.

Rating: 4
Sooooo good! I was skeptical about the method but after making this recipe several times, I decided the reason the recipe specifies baking the meatballs first is that processing the meat mixture results in a very tender meatball that is susceptible to breaking during sauteeing. Baking the meatballs prior to browning seems to give them more structure. I used a sieve to dust the meatballs with flour, turning them with a spatula to coat them evenly. I found the flavor of this dish was enhanced when I prepared the meatballs the day before I planned to eat them, refrigerating them overnight in the gravy. This meal is particularly delicious prepared with the Mashed Potatoes with Spinach and Cheese. Oh, yum!

Meatballs were great. Gravy was awful. I ended up throwing away the gravy and making an oriental sauce to go with it.

I thought this was a delicious dish and it was praised by the family. I saw the benefit in the baking and can't imagine the meal would have been as good if I hadn't baked the meatballs first. The only subsitution I made was thyme for savory as I didn't have any savory. I will definately make this again. I didn't rate it a 4 as I like to leave room in the ratings.

Rating: 1
I thought this lacked body and flavour. Maybe I didn't have the right wine, although it was a quality Beaujolais. And why on earth should you bake the meatballs first for half an hour and then sauté them? I didn't see that at all, so I skipped the baking and sautéed them right away. Yet I'm going to try it again because it wasn't awful.

This recipe was okay, I wish I would of read further reviews. I would not bother to bake the meatballs, I would just fry them like another viewer suggested. I also would not roll them in flour, it added a weird texture to the meatball. If not for these few things I would of rated it a 3+. Flavor was good!!

Excellent!! I made this for a dinner party and everyone (even my friends picky kids) said these were the best meatballs they ever had. I actually made the meatballs and fried the outside of them the night before. I poured about 1/3 cup of the red wine (cabernet)into the pan to get all of the meat juice and refrigerated everything over night. The next day I mixed the wine/fat mix with the rest of the wine called for in the recipe and the tomato paste, boiled the mixture as per the recipe and added the broth. I then put this mix along with the meatballs into a crockpot and cooked on high for a couple of hours. Meatballs were tender and gravy was savory. I removed the meatballs first, thickened the sauce and then served altogether. This gave me time to prepare what I needed. Could also be cooked on low for longer.

Upon making this dish several times I have an answer for those who get a tomatoe tasting sauce or a just so so dish. When the meatballs are baked there is none of the great flavor bits on the bottom of the pan to add flavor to the sauce. My family's responce to the baked version was "what did you do wrong to these meatballs?" Not only was the flavor remarkably better when fried, but the texture was better with the crisp outside to the meat. This can be perfect comfort food. To the reviewer that asked what wine to use, we used a cab with great results. This one's a keeper!

This was excellent, I doubled the recipe for guests and wanted to be sure to have some leftovers...I think there were three left over. Changes: skipped frying step due to lack of time and added just a little cornstarch to gravy. Word of advice: resist the temptation to add garlic or other herbs to the sauce; the subtle beefy winey-ness with the meatballs is too good to mess with.

Okay, I gave the gravy 4 forks!! I used premade (Italian-style Meatballs from Costco). I made the gravy adding flour to thicken then added the meatballs and simmered them for about 30 minutes to absord the flavor of the gravy. The results were/are excellent. I served the meatballs with Creamed Mashed Potatoes with Spinach (Gourmet 11/2001) and Asparagus Salad with Roasted Peppers & Goat Cheese from Food & Wine. Wonderful company worthy menu bordering on classic comfort food.

The overall concept of the meatballs is very good. However, why do we bake the meatballs? Also, why do we have to flour them. Just, saute the meatballs and cook in the sauce, that's what my Italian grandmother used to do. Cook the sauce down, it will make a fantastic sauce!!

My 2 cooking partners and I made this as part of a meatball series over a few weeks (We also recommend the Mexican Meatball stew from a Bon Appetit.) The sauce and the meatballs were really yummy.

While this was good, it really just tasted like meatloaf but in a different form and more difficult to make. The gravy was good, however, and I may consider making the gravy the next time I make meatloaf, but I doubt I'll make the meatballs again. I agree that there is some trouble with the amount of bread/milk and the consistency after processing makes me think it is better off just mixed by hand. Get the onions REALLY FINE (one reviewer recommended grating).

I thought this recipe was a lot of work, however it was excellent. I don't understand why you have to 'blenderize' all the meat or why you have to pre-bake it. That's the xtra work. I will just brown the meatballs after I form them next time. I did use turkey instead of beef and I added 3 tblsp of heavy whipping cream to the gravy at the end. This blended and really smoothed out the flavors.

I made this recipe exactly as written, served it with rice pilaf. The meatballs are excellent - my boys ate them up! The tomato-wine gravy was not as big a hit. My husband & I thought it was OK but the boys wouldn't touch it. When I suggested not making the gravy, though, the boys complained that the meatballs wouldn't taste the same without being cooked in it. Maybe cutting the wine back to 1C. as previously suggested would help.

Fabulous recipie. Delicious. The only modification that I made was I had venison in the freezer to use. Very good because it wasn't a TOMATO sauce, it was a red wine sauce. I also made it with the mashed potatoes. Excellent combo. I would definitely make it again perhaps with beef or even a combo of beef/turkey.

I too thought the sauce was missing something. I added crushed garlic, pepper and extra tomato paste. Still a bit to much wine. Next time I will reduce it to one cup. I have never processed my meatball mixture before, and I have to say the texture was wonderful. I also love the bake then fry method. The meatballs came out perfectly round! Good recipe, but not as great as I thought it was going to be. I would make this again, but with some modifications.

Rating: 3
Outstanding! My only complaint is that I had a hard time not eating all of them. I modified recipe a bit to reduce the fat. I eliminated the olive oil and butter by not frying the meatballs. They browned well enough in the convection oven. I mixed 1/3 cup of flour into the red wine and tomato paste to help thicken the sauce. It turned out wonderful. This can be a nice family meal or an elegant meal for guests.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but somewhat time-consuming. I would suggest making sure that your bread is totally submerged in the milk, so that it becomes very soft, and heeding the advice to use not-so-lean beef. I had no red wine in the house, so I substituted port, which gave the sauce a pleasant sweetness. I will, however, try it with the correct ingredient next time. Served this with the spinach and cheese mashed potatoes from the same issue, and the two recipes worked well together.

These are even better on the second day!

I really liked this recipe; it was a little salty, though. Because I had no summer savory on hand, I used oregano and less pepper. They came out soft, as meatballs should be; otherwise, they would be little hamburgers. My guests loved it. "Mmmmm" was their reaction.

After reading the reviews of other cooks on this one, I decreased the bread slightly and increased the tomato paste slightly and they were very , very good. The spinach mashed potoaoes went wonderfully with them. Great comfort food.

I made this recipe and very much enjoyed it, but agreed with others that it could have been even better. I pulled back on the amount of bread which I think helped the meatballs be more like meatballs as opposed to round meatloafs. I cooked them in the skillet about 10 to 15 minutes, which gave them more a crisp outer edge. After removing the meatballs, I sauted half a shallot (diced) and garlic clove (diced). Then added the meatballs and wine mixture. I doubled the paste, which helped to thiken the sauce. After adding the beef broth, I simmered for 20 to 25 minutes (add broth if gets too thick). I also cut this recipe in half. My family and I thought the results were fabulous. I will definitely make this dish again. Excellent.

I liked this dish a lot. I followed the recipe as written and found the sauce to be well-flavored. I thought the red wine, beef stock and tomato paste had enough zip on their own.

I agree with other reviewers that the sauce needed something. Maybe less wine. Meatballs were very good, though. My family liked the dish, but not as much as the leftover meatballs the next day in sandwiches. Now that was great!

My husband and I really loved this dish. I would suggest cutting the bread into smaller pieces before putting it in the food processor. Will definately make again.

i liked this a lot, and my meat-and-potatoes friends *loved* it, although i was worried because the reviews seemed so mixed. i skipped the step of frying the already-baked meatballs in a skillet, they were so tasty already i didn't think they needed a butter-bath to improve them. i cut by nearly half the beef broth the recipe calls for, so the gravy was thickier and wine-ier.

I have already made these meatballs twice. I added 4 cloves of minced garlic to the meat mixture and that kicked it up. Served them with garlic mashed potatoes - yummy! I have other meatball recipes that I also make, and this one will be a keeper too!

I agree with others who have said that this dish was missing something. The meatballs were tasty but the sauce was bland. Some addtional tomato paste helped. It was also far better the next day.

My family liked the gravy. This was great with mashed potatoes and a green salad. We'll make it again!

This recipe took quite a bit of tweaking. I found the gravy bland so added garlic and sauted mushrooms. The meatballs had too much bread in them, I'm going to cut it down to a half or third of the amount called for. Also added some worcestershire sauce to the gravy, about a teaspoon.

More like meat loaf balls. Too much bread filling. Sauce was mediocre.

This was not something I would make again. The sauce just tasted like salty beef broth. There are so many wonderful recipes I have tried and saved but this one doesn't make the cut.

My husband made this for dinner and I didn't believe him when he said he mixed the ingredients in a food processor until I read the receipe in the magazine. The meatballs were flavorful and light much like my Mom used to make. I made them and gave the dish a mediterranean twist by substituting 1 tsp ground roasted cumin seeds for the summer savory and served them over orzo.
