Have made this with both white and brown rice, both delicious. The brown, of course, takes longer and requires about an extra 1/2 cup of liquid. Great with any roasted meats, especially chicken.

Great recipe! Just enough of a change from regular rice to be a big winner. Great flavor, smells great too! Served with oven roasted salmon fillets. Perfect side.

Very quick and simple to make, great for a weeknight meal. This pilaf tasted great! It had a really delicious, subtle flavor - perfect with some baked chicken. And it made the whole house smell so good!

It reminds me of the rice I used to get at my favorite Turkish restaurant. Perfect with a plain roasted chicken, and super-easy. I'd rather make this than open a box or packet of some side grain.

Delish and so easy! Comes together in 10 minutes. Giving it a 3 b/c I just can't bring myself to describe any rice dish as exceptional:)

Strange. Maybe this would be best with Indian food. It did not work with a crab quiche.

A very good, simple side dish. The flavour is subtle and would go with just about anything.

Unsed brown rice instead, which made it cook longer, but it was just fine.

A great quick side dish to compliment many different meals.

More of a 2+ fork rating, but gets the extra 1/2 fork for how easy it is! A great alternative to plain rice, and a perfect way to use bay leaves (which tend to lurk in my cupboard).
