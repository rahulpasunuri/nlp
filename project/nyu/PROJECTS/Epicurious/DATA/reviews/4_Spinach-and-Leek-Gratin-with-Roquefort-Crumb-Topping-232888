To a cook from Baltimore: this recipe calls for bags of spinach, which I always assume means fresh spinach, and which makes perfect sense with the recipe's instructions. Also, it does say to season with salt and pepper. But i'm with you on the bowl issue. No need to use a bowl unless you are saving the liquid for further use, which isn't the case here.

Although you need lots of spinach for this - it is worth it - I would also recommend more leeks (I used two and should have used three.) I could not find Dijon horseradish mustard so used Annie's brand and was ok though perhaps the actual Dijon would have been better. I also used a generic blue cheese instead of Roquefort to save on cost and it was fine but next time I would use more. Everyone at Easter dinner loved it and wanted recipe. Only wish I had made more to have had leftover!

Wow! This was beyond great - but of course, with all those calories it should be! Used panko successfully. I couldn't find horseradish Dijon, so I just added a touch of horseradish to regular Dijon. I think it may be important to use Roquefort. The blue cheese flavor was actually soft & mild. Perhaps a different blue cheese would have been stronger.

As one dinner guest said, 5-star! It WAS excellent and great with a "cure the winter blues" pot roast. Can't wait to experiment with my own garden chard & shallots. The horseradish dijon gives another subtle layer of flavor. Will also prepare in individual ramekins next time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I made a few minor changes: a little less butter, regular Dijon mustard, twice the leeks, and only half a cup of regular blue cheese. It was very easy and very good. We had it with grilled rib-eyes, baked potatoes, and pumpkin beer to wash it down. Very nice meal!

Love this recipe! Though I'm not usually much for bread crumb toppings, I tried it with panko with great results. I have made it with fresh spinach, chard from my garden, and have also substituted zucchini for a portion of the spinach. (Shred it with a box grater and then saute it briefly over med-high heat in a little butter or olive oil until it wilts and gives up its excess moisture.) Like other reviewers, I found it easiest to combine the Roquefort with the spinach rather than using it as part of the topping. Also, the recipe is very forgiving. I have made this with Roquefort but also with generic blue from TJs and with Dijon mustard as well as other mustards I found in the refrigerator. Always good and everyone likes it.

This was delicious, but I have some problems with the recipe. First--there is no way that 1 8-ounce leek can produce 3 cups of anything. I didn't notice the 3 cups part when I was making my grocery list, so my gratin wasn't very leek-y. I think it would have been good that way, so I'll try it next time. Second--the way that it tells you to defrost the spinach is completely stupid, and it takes way more that 3 minutes per batch. I'll go back to the way I've always done it--put the frozen spinach in a colander and run hot water over it. It has to be squeezed out, anyway, so what's the difference? And why would you put the colander over a bowl? Just to get something else dirty? And who has a non-stick pot? A pan, maybe... Also, the recipe never mentions salt and pepper, which is essential. It's rather common sense to add it, but when it's not in the recipe, it makes it easy to forget. Finally, it will take more than 10 minutes to adequately bake this gratin. Having said all that, I do have to say that this was quite yummy, and worked very well with steak.

I love this dish, but have enhanced it by adding some sliced portobellos and shitake mushrooms. I've layered the spinach, leek, mushroom cream mixture first and then added a bed of polenta circles (purchase tubes of polenta at Trader Joe's) and pushed them down into the mixture and then topped with bread crumbs. I have often made this up the day ahead of time, let it come to room temperature and baked it for about 50 minutes and it is fabulous.

I also use gorgonzola in this recipe. Added dash nutmeg and salt/pepper. Reading the other reviews I like the panko idea, might give that a try tonight. Thanks!

Just made this with a few changes...didn't have any leeks so I used green onion, used frozen spinach, and panko breadcrumbs...it was great! I'll make this one again, and again.

To MsKitchenWench: the recommended cheese for the recipe is in its title: Roquefort is completely different from both Maytag and Danish Blue. It totally MAKES the dish!!!!

Rating: 0
The aroma of spinach and leeks was wonderful! The Danish bleu we used seemd to overpower the dish -- will look for the Maytag. This is a perfect side dish for rib roast. Do not overcook the spinach by blanching, that would be a shame.

What an easy delicious recipe! Great vegetable addition to the Thanksgiving table. To save time, I opted for used 2 boxes of frozen spinach that I thawed and also added slightly more cream than the recipe called for. Other than, I followed it as written (but opted to keep the crusts on the bread crumbs). I have a feeling it will be making another appearance at Xmas dinner as well since everyone loved it!

Really delicious. I substituted gorgonzola and stilton cheeses for the roquefort, because I prefer their flavor I also increased the recipe to serve more people. Next time I would use even more spinach and more leek in proportion to the toppings.

I thought this was fabulous! I used the Gorgonzola as well, but with a big casserole-sized dish, I liked the amount of breadcrumbs. They really make a nice contrast in texture. Served this with the Roast Prime Rib with Pink & Green Peppercorns & Red Wine Pan Sauce, and my foodie friends were practically swooning. This dish now is also an annual favorite at Thanksgiving -- WAY better than the green bean casserole!

Great dish! I cut the spinach in half and threw in about 4 diced skinned boneless chicken thighs. Seared the chicken in a hot pan to just under done and combined it with the spinach and leek mixture. We ate it as dinner and my 11 month old tore it up! Will definately put it in my keepers! also replaced the Blue with Feta and used panko instead of traditional bread crumbs.... great combo

This was tastey, but too much bread crumb topping. Will cut back on the amount of bread crumbs next time.

This was a hit at Christmas dinner. I used two bunches of medium sized leeks to increase it,added a couple more tablespoons of cream,but used the same quantities of everything else and it was perfect.

An excellent accompaniment to a Christmas Prime Rib dinner. I ended up with leftover roquefort from my container, so I just added it to the cream/spinach/leek mixture in the pan. It added a little extra flavor and creaminess, but would have been fabulous per recipe instructions as well.

Delicious! Easy to make and smells fantastic while cooking. I made this for a potluck and got several compliments. I used half and half instead of whipping cream and regular old blue cheese but the flavor was excellent. I think I would add a bit more mustard next time.

A wonderful side dish! Very easy and tasty. I did not rate it at four forks, due to the slight modifications: I should have used less than 2 cups of bread crumbs. I also substituted the Roquefort for Gorgonzola.

I was surprised by how tasty this was! We bought Danish blue cheese since it was only being mixed in with the breadcrumbs and it worked fine. The spinach-leek mixture was delicious, and I agree with other reviewers about cutting down on the breadcrumbs by at least 1 cup - the amount given in the recipe is way too much.

I made this dish to accompany stuffed chicken and it complemented it quite well. With my local grocery store not selling roquefort cheese, I had to substitute. While I know that Brie cheese has none of that blue cheese flavor that would complement the mustard flavor, it worked quite well. Also, coming from one who generally doesn't not like mustard tast or flavor, I didn't mind it in this dish at all. Shouldn't the recipe have said the blanch the spinach in boiling water, not just wilt it in a pan?

I really liked the dish. The roquefort cheese was very strong. Next time, I will try a more milder blue cheese like Maytag or Gorgonzola.

This was very good. I made the recipe as written. Didn't need all the breadcrumbs. But it was delicious.

Crowd pleaser - the vegetarians requested the recipe. Substituted "Health Nut" bread, crusts and all, and freshly grated Romano in the topping for heartier gratin. Also, I did the spinach/leek mixture earlier and refrigerated, then added the topping and baked for 5-10 minutes longer to time with the other dishes being served.

Very good--even a spinach hater will love this recipe. I would have rated it "four forks"-- my husband a spinach purist gave it a "three". I suggest cooking the leek longer and at a lower temperature to prevent burning. I also substituted English Stilton which was yummy. The mustard is the key ingredient in the wonderful flavor of this dish. I used 11 oz spinach and cut the rest of ingredients in half which resulted in a generous portion for two people. Using 3 oz cream with 11 oz spinach was perfect. Also, I didn't need all the breadcrumb topping.
