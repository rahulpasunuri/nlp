We made these last year and I have been waiting all year to have the leftovers necessary to do them again. Really delicious.

Delicious use of Thanksgiving leftovers. I will make it again soon. Only one note - it takes a long time for these to cool down to the point of acceptable temperature for consumption.

Made these for Thanksgiving this year. We had 40 people and enough food for 100. This was the hit of the party. made 40 and they were gobbled (no pun intended) up in no time. Will definitely make them again.
