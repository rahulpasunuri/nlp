This was VERY lemony. It had good flavors, but the lemon definitely was overpowering. If I was going to make it again I do not think that I would add the lemon peel

this is a great simple recipe, not as exciting as others on this site but everyone I've made it for really loves it and it has become a staple of mine since it makes a great, tasty meal for someone who has very little time, very little money, and a very basic kitchen at school.

lemony yes, but that isn't enough to save this dish from being bland. Would not make again.

The chicken breast were moist and flavorful. I did marinat the breasts in lemon juice for about 15 minutes and dipped them in egg before breading. I was generous with the lemon zest in the breading. I loved the lemon flavor. This is a great week-night recipe.

I made this along with the suggested creamed spinach for a very picky boyfriend and it got a pretty good review. I agree that there are more exciting recipes out there, but this one has the benefit of being good without being too risky. Next time I think I will dip the chicken in egg instead of rinsing with water, as we both like a lot of breading.

Very easy, and good recipe. After reading the previous reviews, I decided to marinate the chicken in pure lemon juice. I also altered the recipe by baking the chicken instead of pan frying to cut down on the fat. I misted the chicken with a little olive oil before baking and the results were very good. Nice lemon flavor, and the thyme seemed to compliment it very well.

A really nice and easy recipe, this will be my new way of preparing breaded chicken cutlets.

I will try this again and hope for a better outcome. It was pretty good. I forgot the lemon slices and should have salted the chicken beforehand. Maybe marinate in lemon juice to intensify the lemon flavor. The breading was brown before the chicken was done, so I put in 400 degree oven for 5 mins or so while cleaning up (the oven was already hot from baking squash). Chicken was tender and moist even though I had trouble pounding it flat enough.

Nothing to rave about. It seemed to be lacking in flavor and I actually used the juice from the lemon during the cooking process.

The chicken was very light and tasted great. So quick and easy to make. I grounded the fresh thyme and lemon grind to a powder texture and use extra virgin olive oil. I also triple the recipe! I will make this one again!

Nothing to write home about. I found this dish rather ordinary and uninteresting. And the lemon and thyme flavors didn't really seem to go together for some reason. There are so many interesting chicken dishes, I won't be making this one again.

This was a real disappointment. Maybe it was the Thyme but the flavor was too strong. I'm not used to seeing half-full plates at the end of a meal in my house but tonight that was the case with this sour, bitter chicken dish.

It was like a little taste of heaven. A great side dish is rice soaked in chicken noddle broth.

This was very easy and very tasty. A great summer work-night dish.

Extremely easy and very tasty. A great quick option for a flavorful meal after a long day at work. I added extra lemon peel.

Shrug. My wife and I liked it just fine, but there are so many other great recipes on this website, I won't be rushing to make this one again any time soon. It's easy, so it has that going for it, but I wasn't exactly overwhelmed.

Yum.

I soaked the chicken breasts in salted water first, then did use lemon juice before coating them. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs as that is what I usually have on hand.

Was really good, but definitely use lemon wedges on the final product. Adds another dash of good flavor.

I squeezed fresh lemon juice on the chicken breasts instead of rinsing them in water. Without the lemon wedges I think it would be a pretty bland dish, but if you love lots of lemon, it's reaally good!

Overall, this was a good one. I found when I doubled this recipe, there was too many breadcrumbs left, so I would increase this only to 1/2 cup when doubling. Had a nice lemon taste!

Very easy and quick. I would suggest adding more lemon zest to the mixture since it was a bit bland to my taste. I also recommend serving with lemon slices.
