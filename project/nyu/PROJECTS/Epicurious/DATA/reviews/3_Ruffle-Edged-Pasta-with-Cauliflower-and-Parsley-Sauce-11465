Quick, healthy, and easy. Four forks if you make some of the changes suggested by other reviewers: a bit of garlic, anchovy, and/or red pepper flakes sauteed in the olive oil. I made this with just 1/2 lb of whole wheat pasta and it was a good proportion of pasta to veggies. I liked this with stuffed green olives as in the original recipe - nice bright flavor and the red pimento added some color.

Whole family loved this. Roasted the cauliflower instead of steaming - giving it more depth of flavor. Definitely used less oil and tossed in red pepper flakes, as suggested by many reviewers. Would be good with crushed, toasted walnuts also.

I can't believe I can't post my awesome photo of this awesome dish here. Your loss. I changed up the pimiento olives for kalamata and added garlic and saffron. Was fantastic.

I added garlic and 2 anchovies, which I mashed and sauteed together before adding it to the parsley puree. I also added hot pepper flakes. The idea for these three added ingredients came from a similar recipe in a Marcella Hazen cookbook. I reduced the olive oil by half and used green noodles. It was beautiful and delicious. The parsley puree was excellent!

I agree with some of the posts, the recipe needs a little tweeking-- but is very good. I too added crushed red peppers, garlic and an anchovy-- Italians throw anchovies in sauces all the time--adds flavor and a bit of saltiness, which is why people thought the need to add kalamata olives but green ones worked very well. This recipe is a keeper. Definitely cut back on the oil.

I cut this recipe out of Gourmet way back when. It's a delicious and healthy weeknight dinner. I like it with whole wheat pasta

I agree with the addition of calamata olives. Just want to add that frozen cauliflower works just fine. I chose the one day out of the year to make this when there was no fresh cauliflower to be found, so had to use frozen and it was great.

Tasty, and a super quick way to use up that cauliflower you bought that's about to go bad. My family ate it up.

Basically, what you're making is a parsley pesto without the garlic and parmesan cheese. To add some zing to this recipe just add the garlic and parmesan, as well as pine nuts or walnuts when mixing up the parsley and oil, or just use the pesto of your choice instead. I agree with another reviewer. I think kalmata olives would be a better choice for olives, and I would definitely sprinkle on parmesan cheese when serving. This is one of those recipes where you can easily adapt and improvize to make it really work.

While this is not the most exciting pasta I've ever had, it certaianly is fast, easy and inexpensive. It does need a little spicing up, red pepper flakes , a little garlic and lots of good cheese. I also think if I do it again I'd use Kalamata olives as opposed to stuffed green olives.

I've made it several times, to rave reviews from family and guests alike. I am planning on making this again this weekend, and was double-checking my memory on quantities when I saw the negative reviews--what a surprise! It takes very little imagination or effort to turn this recipe into a real winner. Add a healthy dose of garlic (4-6 cloves) and crushed red chili peppers, and pass a good fresh parmesan or pecorino at the table. This is a wonderful summertime dish that can be made ahead and served at room temperature--easy and healthy.

I made this after I saw the appetizing-looking photo in Gourmet Magazine. It was extremely bland and disappointing. I think we threw out most of it too.

cook from bayside - thats just not fair! Just throw in all the parsley stalks and all, I love this recipe, i think it's a good example of a few ingredients used well to make something really good. But halve the oil.

This was a terrible recipe. No wonder no one has reviewed it yet. The olives just did not seem to go with the rest of the ingredients. It was like a pesto sauce but it was missing the elements that make a pesto sauce flavorful, like garlic and nuts. I wasted my time taking parsley leaves off of their stems and cutting olives, only to end up throwing the whole mess down the food grinder. I sincerely believe that the editors did not test this one before they printed it in their magazine. Don't try it.
