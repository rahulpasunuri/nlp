Both the recipe AND the picture show the crabmeat folded into the creme fraiche mixture. If a reviewer (ex: "A Cook from Carbondale") gives a recipe a low rating, when they haven't followed the recipe as written, then the review is misleading. Changing the amount of salt can be a matter of taste preference, whereas changing the technique and then writing a negative review is an entirely different matter -- just my opinion of course.

Ooh, I forgot! If you're gluten-insensitive, rice flour works just fine in this recipe.

I didn't do the creme fraiche-crab thing; instead I made these fritters to accompany Baked Shrimp in Chipotle Sauce, also from epicurious. 1/8 tsp salt sounded bland to me, so I used half a teaspoon instead; I also used scallions instead of red onion for ease of chopping, and skipped the red pepper. With the shrimp and a celery root/jicama/pear remoulade on a bed of baby Red Oak lettuce, this was one of the best dinners I've ever made. Highly recommend.

This recipe is delicious! Corny corn corn corrrnz in my doo doo. I omitted the red bell pepper, and used seeded Anaheim chilies. I used a total of 3/8 of a tsp of salt instead of 1/8. Also, I added 1/8 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. It was soooo good. Also, it is totally worth it to make home made creme fraiche. Essentially 1T of buttermilk (which you'll have around anyways for the fritters) to every 1C of Heavy whipping cream. Super num numz. I made 1/2 of my fritter batch with crab fraiche and 1/2 without. I felt both were delicious.

A great summer appetizer!--very fresh and flavorful with a few tweaks, like adding salt and a bit more cayenne pepper to the crab/creme fraiche mixture.

I Agree they were a bit bland, more salt, and I served them with smked salmon and sour cream. Better than crab.

If it tastes bland, check the crab. Fresh crab tastes entirely different from canned crab.

Not worth the time. They just do not have any taste. Served them as first course at the table. Did not mix the crabmeat with creme fraiche, but placed it on top like the picture.

This is delicious and easy to make. I tried the batter before frying and it needed a little bit of salt and pepper. It was so good I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. I am making it again tonight!

I totally agree with the person who said the fritters were bland, so I added another 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt (3/8 teaspoon total) and that perked the flavor right up. They were easy to make in quantity, easy to re-heat and a huge hit at every party I've brought them to. Other modifications: I never have buttermilk on hand, so I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream instead of the 1/2 cup buttermilk. Instead of using the sour cream with the crab (and I almost never have creme fraiche on hand) I used about 4 tablespoons of heavy cream with a tablespoon of red wine vinegar. And to the people who write the recipes at Gourmet: Instead of telling me how many people it will serve, for these kinds of individual hors d'oeuvres, can you just tell us about how many pieces a recipe makes? I got about 2 dozen pieces.

I tried these out today, to see if I would serve them for Thanksgiving. After trying them, I decided against it. They were okay, but just kind of bland.

I made these for a dinner party. The fritters are very good, especially when warm. Easy to make. The crab was good but the fritters were just as tasty alone. I'd make these again.

We liked these a lot. They were a nice way to make use of the last of the fresh corn of the season, although I would not hesitate to use frozen. They went beautifully with the pinot gris, but they are equally tasty with champagne or prosecco.

This was just okay. I liked the fritters, very fresh tasting. the crab just seemed like an odd topping. I used fresh dungeoness crab and creme freche so I know that was not the problem. I think they would be better with something else, I just don't know what.
