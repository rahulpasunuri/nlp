This was very tasty but following the recipe resulted in a burnt crust and burnt fruit edges. If I make this again, I would under bake the crust slightly then turn the oven down to 350 to bake the assembled takt and begin checking at 45-50 minutes. The recipe says to bake for 75 minutes which was way too long in my oven (which is accurate according to my laser temperature probe).

We loved this tart. Almond is hardly ever too strong for me so I added more almond flavor to frangipane. I did not make the crust and used boxed crusts to save time and as a result there was a little shrinkage. I will definitely make the crust from the recipe next time! The tart browned beautifully and is as attractive as it is delicious.

Tart was beautiful and v tasty, but think the addition of the almond extract made the frangipane too overwhelming. Could not taste the nectarines v well becuase of it, so next time, I'll make it w/out the extract. Crust was lovely, easy to work with and held up well for 1 day, but not longer than that.
