Quick and easy! I halved the recipe so I filled up one large baking sheet. I wish I had used more shallots since they shriveled up so much. Will definitely make again.

Definitely a recipe to keep in the repertoire. I just threw the shallots and potatoes into the oven together to save time and I thought it was great. Makes a lot, so after my dinner party for 4, I had leftovers for two for a couple of days after, which is always good.

This is a very good recipe. I was concerned that the sage would be too strong but it was not. The shallots are great! Don't be afraid to use large shallots because they shriveled up. I put the potatoes and shallots in the oven at the same time and the total roasting time was about 30 minutes.

I thought at first that it went a little overboard on the shallots, but they were awesome. I loved the sage in this dish. Even though there's quite a bit of sage in it, it comes through as a very subtle flavor, not anything overbearing. I like my roasted potatoes really browned on at least one side, so I hiked the temp up to 400 and it worked nicely. I think I'll make this for the family's Easter brunch this year.

First had this at a dinner party at a friends and have made it several times since. I will be making it again for a dinner party soon. When I don't have a lot of time and it's my family I boil the red skins,make the sage shallot butter,toss and serve. Still really good.

The flavor of the spices diminished during the baking process so next time I would double the mixture and put 3/4 on before baking and the rest on the last 15 minutes.

I really loved this recipe, the flavors are wonderful. Make sure you don't buy small new potatoes as they will shrink too much. Next time I'll opt for larger red potatoes and cut them as suggested.

The potatoes and shallots were great! Loved them! I also used the kosher salt which I prefer. Would definitely make this again. I would even have this as a meal in itself on the nights I prefer not to have meat. With a great salad I would be in heaven!

The sage butter enhanced the flavor of the potatoes beautifully. I agree with the previous reviewer that indicated 4 minutes is too long to allow the butter to cook- I simmered it maybe 2-3 minutes and plenty of the sage flavor soaked in. I did find that the potatoes (I used heirloom red-gold variety) were not browning enough at 375 so I upped the temp to 400 and they finally got the crispy golden crust I was looking for. I also used a dash of olive oil and sprinked with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper before raosting. Delicious!

The roasted shallots are incredible. I've made this several times and the sage and butter will burn so watch the time. I have always cooked it less than the 4 min recommended.

A delicious side dish. I like the suggestion of using kosher salt and will do that next time. We used baby red potatoes cut in half and accidentally put the shallots in with the potatoes at the start. As we used big shallots they held up pretty well. Super easy and impressive enough for guests.

I sprinked the potatoes with kosher salt before baking to give them a light, salty crust. The dish turned out great, even though I didn't have enough shallots. A key to this recipe is cutting the shallots into large enough pieces that they can survive the roasting. I tried to "stretch" the shallots by cutting them smaller, which was a huge mistake. Next time I make this, I'll make sure there are plenty of shallots first!

Used Yukon Gold potatoes, and it was still delicious. Excellent with lamb.

Very good flavor, but nothing new and fantastic here. A great basic potato dish. Would make again, but with olive oil instead of butter.

The new potatoes are above average, but not groundbreaking. The sage provides a nice balance for lighter meats like chicken or seafood. Use plenty of shallots.

substitute basil for the sage, it is also very good...also, saute' 2 med portabello mushrooms, diced into chunky pieces & saute w/ butter & either the sage or basil...
