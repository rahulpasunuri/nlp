I also added more horseradish, substituted ground,toasted dry sweet corn for bread crumbs, and added a little crushed garlic. It made a nice crust and complements the salmon.

I didn't have salmon, so I used a can of tuna fish. Also, I can't drink alcohol, so I used white grape juice. The breadcrumbs were stale, so I used crumbled Fruit Loops. Miracle Whip, not butter. Also no horseradish so I used crushed radishes. The broiler wasn't working so I nuked it. Not bad, but you won't see me serving this again.

Very delicious! I, too added more horseradish, and also omitted the scallion. I sprinkled garlic powder on the steaks along with the salt and pepper, and it turned out great. Would definitely make again!

After I added the breadcrumbs, I drizzled honey over it to add some sweetness. This tastes delicious!

I prefer a salmon fillet instead. The best way is to use a 2 inch diameter ring .After you mold the fillet on the ring ,you can spread a horseradisf batter on top and place to the heated pan with butter.Then, flip and broil the other side to two minutes max.

If I make this again, I'll use salmon fillets instead. I probably won't make it again, though, as it's rather plain.

Proceed at your own risk, followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of a little xtra horseradish thank goodness I didn't serve it to company. My apologies to the salmon Vile!!!

This is a good recipe, but I decided to kick it up a bit. I used cornbread crumbs, 2 T strong stone ground mustard, 2 cloves of garlic, the butter, scallion, and a few tablespoons of wine for the crumb. I made it more moist than dry. It did very well. I also used Pinot Grigio for a better flavor, and only enough to come up about 1/4 on the steaks. This added a more complex layering of flavors, and left the salmon with a buttery flavor. Definately worth making again. And try a good Italian Pinot Grigio.

We eat a lot of salmon, and are always anxious to try a new recipe. After reading all the reviews, I bought a fillet, cut it into 4 pieces, and baked it at 375 for 15 minutes, brushing each piece with white wine. Then I added the crust mixture and broiled for 3 minutes. I used dried Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing Mix as the bread crumbs, crushing the larger pieces - also, as suggested added more butter and more horseradish. Everyone loved it - we'll even add more horseradish next time!

With the other reviews in mind, I added a clove of crushed garlic, 1.5 t of mustard, and the juice of a lemon. It made more of a crust to the salmon. It was excellent!

This dish was quick and easy to prepare, but the end result wasn't the wiz-bang I expected. I even kicked it up with extra horseradish, some garlic, and parsely, but my spouse and I weren't particularly moved.

I agree that more horseradish would give it an added kick. I also used salmon fillets instead of steaks, and the recipe turned out fine. Very tender--a nice change from the usual. I will definitely make this again!

Not the best way to broil salmon steaks. After I scraped the crust off it was still needing some more flavor. I used mustard, and in the future I will seek another recipe.

I prepared the salmon with an extra tblsp. butter--delicious! Made the salmon very soft and tender. My dinner companion thought a bit more horseradish would give it a kick. I had about 1/4 cup left over breadcrumb mixture. Try mixing the leftover mixture w/ melted butter as a sauce.

Fantastic. Followed the recipe exactly. Everybody loved it. This says it all from one of my gues; "I don't even like samon and I love this."

I made this dish for Passover and substituted matzah meal for breadcrumbs .. it was fantastic! No need to use salmon steaks, filets work nicely. Oh, and be sure to use the white horseradish (not the purple stuff with beets - it was much better).

This was very easy & delicious, very flavorful. My guests were impressed. Even more so when I shared the simple recipe.

I made a variation of this that was wonderful. First, freshly made toasted breadcrumbs are a must. Instead of using horseradish, I 'painted' the salmon with a tablespoon of horseradish mustard (a little more would have been good). SO raved all night and asked for this preparation to be made again soon.

Yuk!!!!! What a waste of a good salmon fillet. I had to scrape the crust off. It was, however, easy to make as the recipe says, and the presentation was nice. I'm not quite sure what everyone else on this site ws eating, but it tasted like horseradish-flavored dirt... (My boyfriend thought it was OK, but nothing special.)

I use salmon filets rather than steaks which I have the butcher debone and skin for me. This makes the dish even easier to prepare. If you don't have any white wine, try substituting dry vermouth. It's delicious!

As a chef in a four half star restaurant I am always on the lookout for new dishes. What I look for must be unusual and simple to prepare. This dish is both that, and delicious to boot ! I served it on sticky rice cakes with wilted Bok Choy ! yum.....

This is a very simple recipe, but explodes with flavor. Try adding fresh parsley to the bread crumb mixture, and using an earthy Pinot instead of dry white wine! I did find that you need additional cooking time. Try baking the salmon an additional 5-7 minutes @ 400F to ensure doneness.
