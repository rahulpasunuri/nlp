I've made this recipe three times, which says it all. We've decided to make a different dessert this year for Christmas, but it'll be the first time in four years we've gone without it; I regret the decision already and Christmas isn't until tomorrow! The plastic most definitely DOES melt; after picking tiny threads of melted plastic out of the pudding the first year, in subsquent years I tied a tent of buttered parchment paper over the pudding w/ kitchen twine, and it worked beautifully. Would anyone who's used plastic and NOT melted it please share your secret with the rest of us?

I made this dessert in advance, and it looked beautiful when it came out of the oven -- light, puffy and golden. I followed the instructions to the letter for re-steaming the pudding the next day, but they didn't work. After 45 minutes, the pudding was still cold in the middle, and after an hour, the pudding was warm, but it wasn't light and puffy like it was after the first steaming. It ended up just tasting like average leftover bread pudding. I'll most likely try this recipe again because it looked pretty amazing when it first came out of the oven, but I strongly recommend NOT making it in advance.

I was concerned about the plastic wrap melting but used it anyway because the reviews said it would not. For some reason it did melt. Since it was our Christmas dessert we cut off the top and ate it anyway. If I make it again I will use foil instead of plastic wrap.

I've made it two years in a row. It's gotten rave reviews both times.

I made this for Christmas dinner but substituted apples for the prunes and made a rum butter sauce instead. The plastic wrap doesn't melt. The key is to use large, fresh croissants and let it stand about 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. It freezes well too!

I steamed this pudding for two and a half hours, and when I turned it out the next day for Christmas dessert (after-resteaming it), I found that the pudding had never completely cooked through. The whole thing was a soggy, runny mess. I'm giving this 2 forks because the batter tasted really good, but I was dissappointed.

For someone fairly new to cooking, I was surprised at how easy the recipe was to make. I did not put the plastic wrap on top of the pudding, as it says in the recipe, as I was worried it would melt; I used foil instead. Everything turned out really well...it was the hit of the party!
