A very interesting dish. Yet the flavors were too strong for my family.

Delicious and easy! And the ingredients are usually stocked in the kitchen.

Don't forget to put this in a colorful deep dish or platter. The deep red of ripe tomatoes gives a great presentation. The recipe is not unlike other good vinaigrette recipes, but the capers are a great touch.

I used grape tomatoes sliced in half vertically and it was wonderful!

What a great find...a salad that can be made a day ahead and just wait in the fridge till almost serving time. Served this with linguine wih white clam sauce, a good combination in my book. It was enjoyed by all at the table.

Absolutely fabulous! A real winner at dinner parties! I make it over and over and it's always a hit!

I agree with the reviewers below that suggest marinating this for 24 hours before serving. I halved the batch and tried one half after marinating for 4-6 hours and the second half a day later. The latter was far superior. On the second day, I cut up the Italian bread we had left over and tossed it with the tomatoes for a bread salad. It was delicious. While I did not use red onions, I will try them next time as I think they will add a little more kick than the regular onions. A keeper.

I made & served the same day. Wasn't too impressed. There was a small container left. Found it a few days later. Tasted it---it was sooo good! Next time I'll let marinate 1 full day in fridge & take out to serve at room temp. I also added sliced English cukes. Lots of dressing to sop up with crusty bread.

This is wonderful in summer, or winter with hot sourdough, or other hot crusty bread. Sometimes I make the marinade and just put in two cans of well drained black olives. Super after two or three hours! Have gotten many compliments on both applications.

This one our family's favorites - easy to make - fresh tasting.

I always double this recipe. Usually I also marinate cucumbers with the tomatoes. We think it is a superb recipe. 'Wish capers weren't so expensive because I rely upon this a lot.

This is one of the nicest, fresh salads I have made. Everybody loves it on bruschetta with a grating of parmesan. I use good red wine vinegar such as Forum brand Cab Sav from Spain, and fresh basil. Only with the ripest tomatoes. Use cherry toms if the big ones aren't nice. SUPERB!

Wonderfully simple, fresh salad. No doubt best in the summertime when tomatoes are fresh. I used a fresh basil chiffonade in place of the dried and I opted for Texas Sweet Onions. Serve with lots of fresh baked bread for those sauce-soppers in your crowd!
