Perfect side dish for Asian ribs. Subbed pickled ginger for fresh and added white sesame seeds at end.

it's pretty clear from the ingredients list you shouldn't expect something great. i would advise against serving this when you want to impress. it's cabbage, not enhanced really. fine to throw together quick to have with, i don't know, rice and beans or whatever your quick go-to food is.

I did change this a bit but the results were awesome! I melted 1 T butter and sauteed the ginger. I added 3 T chicken broth and tossed in shredded cabbage and green onions. I drizzled 1 t of sesame oil which was plenty!Peppered, lightly salted to taste and tossed until wilted. SO good!

A nice side dish to go with a spicy or heavily flavored main dish. I served with hoisin-marinaed pork chops (on this site). I used slightly less sesame oil because a little goes a long way for me on that. I cut the recipe in half and used 1 t. sesame oil. I didn't think it was too oily. I used peanut oil for the vegetable oil and I added toasted sesame seeds at the end.

Great Recipe. Some reviewers mention this being too oily. I think that perhaps they used a smaller cabbage. The cabbage heads at my local grocer were small and averaged 1.5 lbs. I upped the amount to 2.5 and added 1 tsp sesame oil and it came out great, not oily at all. I made this as a side for my own kalua pork recipe and it was perfect.

Delish! Such an easy side for any white meat dish with an asian flair. I always sprinkle a few teaspoons of white sesame seeds before it's served.

not sure why people call this one healthy...way too oily for me and I even cut down on the oil! It reminded me of the oil coated veggie dishes you see at the chinese buffets.

This was a very good side dish. Very healthy, easy and tasty. This would be great served with tuna steak pan seared in sesame oil.

Raisins, Cape Cod? Eeew. This dish is simple and tasty. We enjoyed it with a little rice vinegar & Eden Shake on top (only change) with some fish and quinoa/roasted veg.

Goes great with the Hawiian pork, the cabbage off set the saltiness of the pork dish to enhance both flavors

My hubbie and I LOVE this and have it often. When I stirfry the first half of the cabbage, I really let it sit over high heat so it gets brown-carmelized in spots, to really bring out flavor. I also use 1 bunch of green onions per 1 cabbage. When I'm lazy I use ground ginger instead of fresh, just sprinkling it liberally on the first half, and it turns out just as good. Finally, I use sesame oil infused with red chilis, and then a little salt and a lot of black pepper, and it's wonderful.

This was very bland as made following the recipe. I added a fair amount of ginger, sesame oil, raisins, and it was still bland. Maybe garlic would have helped. I wouldn't recommend.

Yummy! Let's face it folks...cabbage is bland to begin with and either you like it or you don't. I kicked it up a but with a little extra ginger and sesame oil. Depending on what I serve it with (since I am not making the pork again) I might add some garlic next time. I only cooked a 1/2 batch so it all went into the pot at once. I cooked it so it still had a little crunch left to it...about 3 - 4 minutes

Bland and oily. Not worth a repeat.

Not sure why others liked this so much. Maybe I missed something or messed it up. Not that exciting. I would not serve it with the outstanding Hawaiian pork.

I substituted white cabbage and grated carrots for the green cabbage and it was very tasty. I started with sauteing a chopped shallot and some garlic.

This was absolutely delicious and worked well into the South Beach diet.

Fantastic accompaniment for spicy-sweet dishes. My husband and I love it. This is also delicious tossed with some udon noodles or fried with rice for a different side or snack.

This was so good. My husband rarely touches cabbage and he ate seconds of this. It is simple and quick. I will make this again and again.

I make a version of this, adding golden raisins. They add color to the dish and lend just the right amount of sweetness.

This is an easy and tasty dish that goes great with kal-bi style food.

This goes great with the HAWAIIAN-STYLE BRAISED PORK. Go light on the ginger if you're not a big fan, but this meal if fabulous just as the recipe suggests. Enjoy!

Surprise! I loved this cabbage side dish and so did my husband. It has zing and is a great accompaniment for a spicy pork dish. I made the Baked Pork Ribs with Hoisin Barbecue Sauce, which I highly recommend also.

Very nice side dish with an Asian taste. Really peps up a boring head of white cabbage (which is what I used). I didn't have any fresh ginger in the house and so had to use powdered, but with fresh I'm sure the outcome is at least 50% better, and it was really good with powdered! Quite crunchy.
