I made this for Easter dinner with a glazed ham, and it was a perfect match. I wouldn't change a thing. It did take quite a bit longer to bake than the recipe suggests. I just went on instinct.

Funny, I'm in here looking for recipes that have fat due to chemo and surgery! Best wishes to you and your son

Looking for soft, high calorie food for my son, recovering from a bone marrow transplant. I made this in six small custard cups for him, subbed 1 cup mexican blend cheese for parm, also added 1 cup dried milk solids for protein. I thought it was excellent, and light tasting, despite the fat. I think it would benefit by addition of some minced garlic with grits cooking. I left out the tabasco, but would add if I made it another time.
