Great recipe! Used Sprouted Red Rice Quinoa blend from Costco, smoked turkey from the deli (chunked) and substituted nonfat Greek yogurt for sour cream. This came together very easily. Can't wait to serve at my next gathering.

I've made this twice, once for a bridal shower. It makes far more than 12 servings, so beware. You'll be eating leftovers for days! I preferred to toss the meat and rice mixture with the dressing and mound that in the center of the platter with the lettuce around the perimeter. One way I cut back on fat was to substitute fat-free greek- style yogurt for the sour cream. I made life simple by buying smoked turkey at the deli in a large chunk and then cubing it for the salad. I would cut the amount of chicken or turkey by half. There is no need to cook the wild rice until the water is absorbed. Just drain it after the recommended cooking time (check to see that the rice is chewable!). No need to toss it with the oil/vinegar mixture if you are mixing it all together with the dressing. Also, use cilantro, not coriander as this term refers to the seed, at least in this part of the world.

This dish allowed me to reconsider the fact that I dislike curry. It is wonderful! The combination of flavors is very nice. The changes I made were to use 1 box Uncle Ben's Wild Rice Mix, 2-3 cups chicken, all of the sauce (less the water called for in the recipe). Since I do not like coriander, I opted for fresh chopped flat leaf parsley. Still a winner. More raisins make it even better. I could not find mache so used arugula. The only thing that I think could improve this is adding a little bit of a hot curry powder, depending of course, upon your heat tolerance.

This is a great recipe! We used orzo instead of wild rice. We added extra sour cream. We couldn't find mango until the last minute, so we diced it and threw it in. Still delicious. It was a huge hit at the shower.

Delicious! I used white instead of wild rice and poached chicken in Indian spices instead of using smoked. I also substituted dried apricots for raisins. Easy and tasty!

The flavor combinations in this dish were really interesting. I altered it a bit, but not so much that it was far from the recipe as written. For the dressing, I only used 1/4 c. olive oil, substituted fresh mango for the chutney, and used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I had to add some water to get the right consistency, but it was delicious and we didn't miss the additional fat and calories! For the rice mixture, I used Quorn veggie chicken tenders (b/c I'm vegetarian) and chopped up some dried apricots instead of raisins. Served with a salad of fresh herbs and baby greens, it made a fantastic dinner and even better lunches from the leftovers.

Delicious- Please read the instructions on wild rice and how to cook it. It takes a lot of water, boil it, and check it periodically until tender then drain it. Do not make wild rice mush.

Excellent as written. Cook from Atlanta, do the rest of us a favor and don't rate a recipe low because you made a mistake with it. Common sense.

I overcooked the wild rice waiting for all the water to absorb! I usually would start over again except I didn't want to throw away $8 worth of wild rice...plus I had 30+ people coming over for dinner that evening! It turned out okay, but not great. Most people couldn't even tell that it was wild rice! If I ever make it again, I'll make sure to use less water!

I'm a personal chef in san francisco and have by request made this recipe over and over! i'm addicted at home too, and so are my house-mates! as recommended in other reviews, lose the smoked chicken. i chop chicken into bite size pieces then poach it in chicken broth spiked with some curry, garam masala, and garlic. when done cooking, i drain it then pour some of the broth back over it to keep it moist while it cools. i never have enough time to wait for everything to cool entirely before mixing- it even tastes great warm! if mache lettuce is unavailable (i searched everywhere for it- whole foods, andronico's, bi-rite, etc, and eventually found it surprisingly enough at trader joes!), watercress goes well with it too! neither greens are absolutely necessary, but nice.

I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil because the grape seed oil is lighter. I will use less water in cooking the wild rice next time. My family really enjoyed this recipe -- and I got another way to use leftovers of smoked turkey.

Great recipe for summer! I made a few changes to the original.I poached chicken breasts for 30 minutes in a water, chicken broth and spice mixture and then put them in an ice bath so they would chill quickly for dinner. I also added toasted almond slices, sliced red grapes and cut the fat a little cutting down the oil to 1/4 cup and substituting sour cream with yougurt. One of my favorite recipes!! :-)

I would make again but the recipe calls for WAY too much chicken. I would use half the amount of chicken and would vary by using regular chicken breasts. The smoked is good but not worth the effort of finding.

I have made this several times for potlucks and everytime I am asked several times for the recipe. I add taosted hazelnuts or pecans and I sometimes add chopped dried apricots or cherries. I usually use smoked turkey instead of the harder to find smoked chicken. I chop the turkey and add to the rice mixture and I don't use the mache. This is a great recipe.

Salad was so easy to make and was delicious. I made it for a baby shower and everyone raved about it. I used regular chicken breasts since I couldn't find any smoked chicken.
