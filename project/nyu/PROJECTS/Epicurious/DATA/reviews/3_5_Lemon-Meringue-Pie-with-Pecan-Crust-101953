This pie was awesome. It came out perfect. I made some minor changes. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and increase lemon juice by 1/4 cup and reduced water by the same amount. The crust is very good as well.

This is the best lemon meringue pie I ever had and it got rave reviews from my toughest critics - my urban, restaurant savvy kids. I eat gluten free and this was easy to convert.

This recipe was delicious and rendered a beautiful pie. Even my husband, who isn't much of a meringue fan, enjoyed it. Per other reviews, I reduced the water to 1 1/4 cup, increased lemon juice to 3/4 cup and decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cup. With those modifications, the lemon filling was perfect!

This is the best lemon meringue pie ever, and I have tried many different recipes -- I make it exactly as written and would not change a thing. It is sweet and tart -- but not too tart (some recipes I've tried are so tart they're actually downright sour). My children have always said they hate lemon pie -- but they LOVE this one, and so does everybody else.

I was so excited to make this pie - it looked beautiful but was just plain yucky! It was wayyyyyyyy to sweet, the meringue was mushy - I ended up throwing it out. Not pleased at all.

My neighbor made this pie for Thanksgiving and was lucky enough to have a taste. The best lemon pie I have ever had. My question is to A Cook from Mexico. You mentioned that freezing the pie was a good idea. I would like to be able to freeze the leftover pie filling for later use. Will this affect the taste and/or texture of the filling itself? I plan to fill individual tart crust shells with filling only so I can take them out as needed. Is this feasible?

I would love to submit my photo as the representative one for this recipe, just perfect looking! Tasted wonderful, too. Some of you (my husband's family) who prefer cloyingly sweet pies might be turned off by the tartness in this, but my family loved it! I ended up pressing in the crust since I had trouble holding it together to lay it into the pie plate, but no harm done to the tenderness. This is my go-to lemon meringue pie, so easy too.

This was a good pie and my guests who often say no to dessert all had a slice (well my husband only had a bit of mine). Very tsaty pie. The pie did 'weep' a bit and the crust did not firm up enough - bake a little longer at the outset as the pie browns with merignue in just a few minutes - not hte 20 minutes as instructed.

I also took previous reviewers' advice and used1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/4 cups water, and 3/4 cups lemon. The filling was tart and delicious - a great contrast to the sweet, crunchy crust. I made this the day before and refrigerated overnight, and it was still great.

This pie was not soggy at all, very tang, and the pecan crust made it so much better! I followed advice of others and reduced the water to 1 1/4 cup, increased lemon juice to 3/4 cup and decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cup. I will use this recipe from now on!

After reading the reviews and suggestions I made this pie with limes- lemons are hard to get in Mexico. The lime were just fine-sweet & tart. I also altered the ingredients a little as suggested and it came out GREAT! I will make this again and my test run is already gone (in 2 days.)

Everyone loved it, it was perfect. I didn't change anything. I use this crust recipe in some of my other pies now too.

Excellent and easy! I followed advice of others and reduced the water to 1 1/4 cup, increased lemon juice to 3/4 cup and decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cup. Cooked on stove until THICK. Baked as directed. Not runny - kept perfectly in the fridge for a day (that's all it lasted!). Perfect tang too!

I took others advice and increased the lemon juice. I used one cup of juice and one cup of water. I also used a little less sugar, 1 1/2 cups. It turned out perfect, lemony and tart. The crust is really great too, I will make this again.

This pie would have been really good but the custard was waaay too sweet. Next time I make it, I'll cut down on the sugar.

Yum! Like other reviewers, I like my pie tart, so I increased the lemon juice by 1/4 cup (and adjusted the water accordingly) and decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. Delicious!

On Feb 27 I had the whole family over for my first annual Pie Night. Each adult got to pick a pie, and I made it for them to share and take the rest home. There were 8 pies. I had never made a lemon meringe pie before and tried this recipe. I gave it a trial run because the woman who requested lemon meringue is a chef. It turned out great.....and a week later when I made the pie for Pie Night, I added a light layer of cookie crumbs onto the lemon filling. It was a real success and the chef just loved it. Now I have no fear of lemon meringue and hope to make it often.

This recipe was yummy. I got great reviews from the entire crowd. They loved the pecan crust. I also reduced the sugar (but for me that's standard in all recipes) and I increased the lemon juice. I recommend tasting it and seeing if it's tangy enough for you. Of course it was beautiful. Meringue always looks impressive. Not out of this world, but definitely I'd do it again.

I cut back on the sugar too because I like a little pucker in my lemon desserts. Made the crust in a food processor; was quicker than beating. Everything turned out fabulous flavor-wise, but I did have problems with the filling weeping. The texture of the filling was great though, not runny or rubbery. Will try a layer of cake or cookie crumbs to help with the weeping problem next time.

Can someone explain why a liquid appears between the filling and meringue? Did I bake it too long?

By far the BEST lemon pie I've ever made. I've easily made this pie a dozen times or more and I've never had problems with weeping. One thing that both me and my mother have noticed is that the filling is intensely sweet when the pie is first made, however the next day it isn't nearly as sweet. This isn't a complaint though, its great both ways.

I have made this pie quite often - it is one of the best lemon meringue pie recipes I've tried. I agree that it should be served within six hours so that it maintains its texture, etc.

This was definitely the best lemon meringue pie I've ever made. The filling was so smooth -- just the right texture. It is really, really sweet, though, so next time, I'll cut down a bit on the sugar.

I've made this pie twice. The first time I took the filling off the fire as soon as it started to boil. The result was a runny filling. The second time I let it boil and thicken more. Perfect! A big hit with everyone. Even the "failed" first attempt tasted good. Runny but yummy.

This pie was absolutely amazing. This is the best recipe for lemon meringe pie I have ever come across. The crust was fabulous with the pecans. I would however use a little less sugar next time in the filling. Delicious!!

I've made this pie a few times. It is very good but like a previous reviewer noted, the filling does weep and the crust gets soggy, as a result. I will try arrowroot next time instead of cornstarch and see if that helps.

I have been making this recipe ever since I bought the magazine in 1999. Rave reviews from all who have tasted.

this pie was remarkably easy to make and the crust came together beautifully. the contrast between the crisp, tender, crumbly crust and the soft meringue and lemon filling is wonderful! my only complaint is my one complaint with all lemon meringues...the filling weeps!!! and the crust consequently gets soggy!!! anyone know how to avoid this? my only solution would be to replace the lemon filling with a lemon curd...but that ups the fat content considerably. other than that...i can't wait to use this crust for other recipes.

There are so many reasons why I love this pie! The curd is subtle and sweet that is perfect with the pecan crust. Anyone in my opinion would be mad not to like it! And if they don't like it then they probably made it wrong!!!!

I had never tried lemon meringue and was surprised how easy this was. The crust was a little tricky to roll out since it is so sticky. One of the reviewers below suggested putting the rolled-out crust in the freezer for 5 minutes before putting it in the pan, which I did (the second time). It was definitely the way to go. But great lemon flavor, not too sweet. Rave reviews at the picnic!

Very tasty lemony pie! The crust takes alot of time, but is completely worth it. My family loved it, and so did I!!

What prompted me to try this recipe was the crust. It did require a little extra work and time to chill, then freeze, but the results were nice. I enjoyed the "crunch" that the pecans provided. I think that this crust would be awesome for an apple pie topped with cheddar cheese. I also reduced the sugar for the filling to 1.5 cups to make it less sweet but in doing so the filling turned out to be a bit "gluey, and gloppy". Increasing the liquids should remedy that. Good but not GREAT.

Even the kids at the BBQ loved this pie. My husband, who doesn't like lemon meringue, loved it. The best part was the very lemony flavor with the salty crust. Ymmm. I will definately make this again.

I made this pie for Mother's Day. We served about 5 different desserts and this one was the favorite. The crust is just delicious and the filling was so lemony. I got many requests to make another one in the near future.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but am looking forward to giving it a go. I just wanted to make a comment to "the cook from Westlake Village, CA": I think I know the failed lemon meringue pie recipe you're referring to. I also tried this recipe by a woman named "Martha" and it was awful - a very soupy pie that wouldn't hold together. I'm sure this recipe from Bon Appetite is going to be much better.

I did this pie for my husband this weekend. He liked it very much and I liked too. The crust is delicious and I think I will use it for other recipes. I have one suggestion: freeze the lemon meringue pie.

The filling was good, but I too wasn't impressed with the crust match-up. It would have been a great crust for a pumpkin or apple pie, but was a bit heavy for lemon meringue. I prefer consistent lightness-- if the pie is meant to melt in your mouth, the crust should not add crunch!

I made this recipe last summer, inspired by the production of lemons from our tree; my husband and I both loved it! I thought the crust was delicious --the nuts in it added a nice texture against the creamy pie filling and airy topping! It all came out perfect! I've just tried a different lemon meringue pie recipe (from a well-known female's cookbook), and was very dissapointed -- the filling did not stay intact and didn't taste as good. I'm making the Bon Appetit recipe from now on for Lemon Meringue Pie. I never realized how tricky lemon meringue pie could be, but you don't have to worry with this recipe!

I made this pie with the following variations: a graham cracker crust and whipped cream (sweetened with confectioners' sugar) on top instead of meringue. My boyfriend and I loved it!

Per the previous reviews, I cut the sugar 1/4c and added another 2T of lemon juice and the filling came out perfect. I wasn't as fond of the crust, it seemed a little heavy, but I may have overworked it.

This recipe called for too much sugar. I prefer a more tart lemon filling. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup and add more lemon juice.

Flavor was great but presentation was somewhat lacking. I would use more egg whites to achieve a larger volume of meringue. I prefer a lemon meringue pie that's quite high with great eye-appeal. Crust was wonderful and I will definitely use it for other pies.

The recipe was excellent and much easier to make than the lemon pie recipe in one of the spring magazines a year ago. The only adjustment that I made to the recipe was to cut the sugar in the filling. It gave the pie pucker power which my family liked.
